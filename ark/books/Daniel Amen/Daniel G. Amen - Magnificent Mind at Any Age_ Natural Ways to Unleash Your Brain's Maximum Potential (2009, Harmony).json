We see small children and the elderly and everyone in between. Peoplecome to see us because we use sophisticated brain imaging technology to help usunderstand and treat our patients, plus we use natural treatments wheneverpossible. It is through the lens of our imaging work that I discovered that whenI improve how your brain functions, not only do I help you overcome problemssuch as attention deficit disorder (ADD), anxiety, depression, addictions, andanger, I also help you be more thoughtful, creative, energetic, focused, andeffective.After looking at nearly fifty thousand scans, it is clear to me that a balancedbrain is the foundation for a life that is happier, healthier, wealthier, andwiser. That is the promise of this book: if you really understand how to developand take care of your brain, your life will be better no matter what your age.One question people often ask me is whether the mind is separate from the brain.The answer is clearly no. The mind and the brain are completely dependent oneach other. Just think with me about Alzheimer’s disease, which is clearly abrain illness. Images 1.1 and 1.2 depict two brain single photon emissioncomputed tomography (SPECT) scans. These are the scans we do in our clinics.SPECT is called a functional scan, because it shows how the brain works; itmeasures blood flow and activity patterns. Image 1.1 is of a healthy person. Itshows full, even, symmetrical activity. Image 1.2 shows a woman who hasAlzheimer’s disease. The holes indicate very low activity in several importantareas of her brain.image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_005_r1.jpg]Image 1.1: Healthy BrainFull, even, symmetrical activityimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_006_r1.jpg]Image 1.2: Alzheimer’s DiseaseDeterioration back half of brainDo people with Alzheimer’s disease lose their minds? Yes, they do as the diseaseprogresses. When you lose brain tissue you lose your memory and your ability tothink clearly.image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_007_r1.jpg]Image 1.3: Soldier’s Brain DamageNotice damage in the front of the brain.Now let’s consider brain trauma. Image 1.3 depicts a soldier’s brain that wasdamaged in an explosion in Iraq. He was discharged from the army within a yearof the accident because he kept getting into fights with other soldiers,something that did not happen before the injury. Does brain damage affect aperson’s ability to get along with others? Of course it does! Damage the brainand you damage the mind and most everything else in your life.image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_008_r1.jpg]Image 1.4: ADD Before TreatmentDecreased frontal lobe activityimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_009_r1.jpg]Image 1.5: ADD After TreatmentImproved frontal lobe activityBut what if we improve the brain? Does that improve the mind? Here’s an example.Jenny, age sixty-two, came to see us for dyslexia and ADD. She had suffered herwhole life, underachieved at school and at work, and felt defective and stupid.She had been divorced twice and was estranged from her children. I had treatedher son for ADD, and he subsequently reached out to her. With the properdiagnosis and treatment she was able to feel much better and was able to makepeace with her children. (See Images 1.4 and 1.5.)A balanced brain is the foundation for a magnificent mind. Here is a recentletter I received from the mother of one of my patients. (with permission)Dear Dr. Amen,I am the mother of Dale B. who was treated at the Amen Clinic approximately 8years ago. Dale was 17 and in trouble with the law. He was brought to the clinicin shackles. After evaluation and treatment, Dale was able to be gainfullyemployed for 1 year in retail sales. He then joined the Army where he excelled.Dale immediately became an Army Ranger. Dale was able to make a success of hislife because of the treatment he received at the Amen Clinics. Dale was killedin action in Iraq on 3/18/06 just 3 days before his 24th birthday. We take greatcomfort in knowing Dale died a Hero. I thought you might be interested in thepart you played in this Hero’s life. Dale was buried at Arlington Cemetery withgreat honor.Thank you,Laura B.Proud Mother of Sgt. Dale B.Helping to unchain a young man from the shackles of failure to become adecorated war hero is a humbling experience. Even though Dale’s death was verysad, he died on his own terms, doing something he loved. The details of Dale’sstory are unique, but the essence is not. I have received many, many lettersthanking me for changing someone’s brain and changing his or her life.Most people have the completely wrong idea about accomplishment and about whatholds people back from realizing their dreams. The majority of people, like mebefore I began this work, take a commonsense approach. This is the same approachespoused by most self-help gurus, business executives, and head coaches whowrite “how I won the championship” books. Try harder, they say, be your ownperson, visualize your success, work longer, take responsibility, stopcomplaining, change your attitude, and do not let anyone get in your way. Withdiligent devotion, you can be anything you want in life. If you are notsuccessful, then you are lazy, willful, or need an attitude adjustment. Look atme. If I can do it, you can too.The problem with this approach is that it simply doesn’t work for many peoplewho sincerely try to incorporate it into their lives. It often backfires. Theharder many people try, the worse their brains, abilities, and behaviors get. Nodoubt the tough love, kick-in-the-butt approach works for some, but it leavescountless others feeling demoralized, disconnected, hopeless, and unworthy.How effective do you think I would have been with seventeen-year-old Dale B.when he came to our clinic in shackles if I chewed him out and told him to tryharder, just like all the other adults in his life had already done? Not veryeffective. What we did was completely different.A magnificent mind starts with a healthy brain. For you to realize your dreamsin any area of your life, requires your brain must work right. Your braincontrols everything you do: how you think, how you feel, how you act, and howwell you get along with other people. When the brain works right, you workright. When your brain is troubled, you have trouble in your life.Before we did anything with Dale we understood the context of his life, listenedto how he thought and took sophisticated images of how his brain worked. It wasclear from the scans and his behavior that Dale suffered from a brain that wasout of balance. As we optimized the three-pound supercomputer between his earshe was able to mature, gain self-control, and claim a more effective life. Withunderstanding and a balanced brain, he was able to develop the abilities to livea hero’s life, serving his country and making his parents proud beyond words.With an unbalanced brain, he likely would have remained ashamed of himself, adisappointment to his family and a drain on society.The first key to a magnificent mind is a balanced brain. With a balanced brainwe are able to learn from our own experiences and from other people to make ourown lives the best they can be. The first step in investigating failure is tounderstand the brain. An unbalanced brain causes its owner immeasurable trouble,including difficulties learning, being distracted and impulsive, and making thesame mistakes again and again.The Secret Behind Why Some Achieve Their Dreams and Others Don’tWith an unbalanced brain most self-help or societal strategies to improvebehavior do not work. Consider prison. Clearly, it is an extreme and costlyattempt to modify behavior. Yet the recidivism rate is 60–70 percent within fiveyears. Few people ever consider looking at the brain in helping people whosebehavior is so bad they end up in jail. In a 2007 study that my colleagues and Ipublished in the Journal of Neuropsychiatry, we found that murderers hadsignificantly lower overall activity in their brains compared with a healthygroup, especially when they performed a concentration task. These findings wereespecially prominent in the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain that actsas the supervisor, inhibiting impulses and difficult behavior. We will neverimprove bad behavior until we balance the underlying organ that drives it.Or consider marital therapy. According to a 2005 New York Times article, twoyears after ending counseling, 25 percent of couples were worse off than whenthey started, and after four years up to 38 percent were divorced. Very fewmarital therapists ever consider looking at the brain in trying to help failingrelationships, and that is a mistake. Consider the following example.In 2006 I gave a lecture to one thousand people at Skyline Church in San Diego.The next year I was invited back. As often happens when I speak at a place forthe second time, a number of people approach me as I walk into the lecture hallor sanctuary with their SPECT scans. My lecture motivated them to come to one ofour clinics to have their own brain evaluated. On this occasion, athirty-five-year-old man, Todd, came up to me to show me his scan (see Image1.6). The scan shows a swiss cheese appearance, indicating seriously low overallactivity, the same pattern we often see in our drug or alcohol abusers. As Ilooked at the scan, Todd said, “You think I am a drug addict, don’t you?”image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_010_r1.jpg]Image 1.6: Todd’s BrainSwiss cheese or toxic appearance“The thought had crossed my mind,” I replied.“I have never used drugs,” Todd said. “And I don’t drink. Before I came to yourclinic I used to paint cars in my garage, without much ventilation. I don’t dothat anymore.”“That is the sign of intelligent life,” I replied. “New information causes youto change your behavior.”He went on to tell me that he and his wife had been in marital therapy forseveral years without any benefit. After his visit to the clinic in NewportBeach he started to live a brain-healthy life. He began taking a multiplevitamin and fish oil and the other brain-healthy supplements we recommended, andhe improved his eating and exercise habits. The difference, he said, had beenlife changing. After his brain was better, he was able to be a better husband. Iwonder how many marriages are suffering because one partner has a brain problemthat no one is aware of. How do you do marital therapy with this brain? It willnever work, until you help heal the brain first.In every walk of life a magnificent mind is tied to brain function, but becausewe never directly look at the brain and rarely think about its impact on our ownlives, we often miss this most important puzzle piece in trying to realize ourdreams.The Ideas of ChangeOver the past three decades my primary work has been as a psychiatrist and brainimaging specialist. I became a psychiatrist to study human behavior to learn howand why people develop magnificent minds. I started imaging the brain eighteenyears ago because I realized after nine years of being a psychiatrist that I wasmissing important information to help my patients. To really help people change,I discovered that I must understand and optimize the organ of change, the brain,in individual patients.Shortly after beginning my brain imaging work with people hospitalized forpsychiatric problems, a series of ideas started to percolate in my own brain.Over the next few years, the ideas crystallized and have become part of almosteverything I have done since.A magnificent mind starts with a balanced brain.Failure is often the result of a brain gone wrong.Not everyone has the same brain function.Optimize the brain and you dramatically increase a person’s abilities.Use every option available to balance the brain, including natural supplements,diet, exercise, thinking strategies, and if needed, medication.Teach people skills; do not just give them pills.I ordered my first brain SPECT study on psychiatric patients in the spring of1991. I was using the study to help understand the underlying brain problems ofmy patients to better target their treatment. At the time, I had a very busypsychiatric practice. I was treating people in my private clinic and those inthe hospital where I was the director of the dual-diagnosis program for patientswho had substance abuse and psychiatric problems. I was excited about SPECTbecause it helped me be a better doctor. It helped me be more effective inhelping my patients. Even though SPECT scans are of tremendous value inunderstanding individual brains, you do not need a scan to benefit from thisbook. By studying tens of thousands of scans I have developed a checklist (seechapter 3) to help people predict what their scan might look like if they couldget one. The checklist will help you understand your brain’s specific needs andguide you on ways to help it.Magnificent Mind at Any Age is ultimately about understanding how the brain isinvolved in the day-to-day operations of your life no matter what your age andgiving you specific strategies to optimize it naturally. The book will help youunlock your abilities in work, school, and relationships, and bring you closerto your own potential for accomplishment, connection, and happiness."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_011_r1.jpg]A Magnificent Mind Starts with a Healthy Brainimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]ESSENTIAL STRATEGIESBrains run the world. They run the stock market and the local market. They runhuge corporations and the mom-and-pop shop down the street. Brains run churches,banks, hotels, tennis clubs, dry cleaners, professional basketball teams,Internet dating services, and universities. Brains run marriages, choirs,homeowner associations, and terrorist groups. Your brain runs you and issignificantly involved in running your family. Yet even though the brain isinvolved with everything we do at work and at home, we rarely think about orhonor the brain. There is no formal education about the brain in MBA programs,no brain-training programs at church, no brain exercises in customer service ormanagement programs, and no real practical education about the brain in school.The lack of brain education is a huge mistake, because success in all we dostarts with a healthy brain.The characteristics of a magnificent mind include personal responsibility, cleargoals, good attention, consistent effort, effective social skills, impulsecontrol, motivation, integrity, and creativity. Yet few people realize that allof these are brain functions. A healthy brain makes these characteristics easierto incorporate in your life, while a damaged or struggling brain makes thesemuch harder. Taking great care of your brain is essential to a magnificent mind.Here is an example.In one of the graduate psychology courses I taught I asked for volunteers forour healthy brain study. By the year 2000, we had amassed tens of thousands ofSPECT scans for clinical reasons, such as attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, autism, Alzheimer’s disease, brain trauma,marital strife, and violence. To further our research efforts, we needed tobuild a large normal database to compare our clinical studies. I solicitednormal people wherever I went. Surprisingly, they were not that easy to find.Christy, one of my favorite students, came up after class very excited. Shesaid, “You have to scan my eighty-two-year-old grandmother, Anna. She is one ofthe most normal people I know. You will love her.” On Christy’s advice and withher grandmother’s agreement, we screened Anna and indeed found her to be healthy(see Image 2.1). She met all of the criteria for the study: she had not sufferedfrom psychiatric illness at any point in her life; there was no history ofsubstance abuse, brain injuries, or first-degree relatives with psychiatricillness; and she was not on any medications. Anna had been married forfifty-eight years and was a loving wife, mother, and grandmother. She had asharp, curious mind and was active in her church and community. She had solidrelationships that spanned many years. Anna never drank alcohol, never smoked,and tried to eat healthy. She has one of the healthiest brains I had ever seen,out of nearly fifty thousand! Her brain fit her life.image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_012_r1.jpg]Image 2.1: Anna’s Eighty-Two-Year-Old Healthy Brain SPECT ScanFull, even, symmetrical activityThe First Steps to a Healthier BrainMost of us are never taught about how important the brain is, so we go throughlife thinking about everything (weight, skin care, finances, children, Internetdating, vacations, careers, sports) but this critically important organ. I livein Newport Beach, California, the heart of Orange County. We have often beencalled the plastic society because we have more plastic walking around ourstreets and beaches than almost any other place in the world. I often say thatwe care more about our faces, our boobs, our bellies, and our butts than we doour brain. How stupid is that? When you really want to change, the place tostart is with your brain. In the rest of this chapter I will tell you the firstsix things you should do to improve your brain health.1. PROTECT YOUR AMAZING BUT FRAGILE BRAINThe brain is the most complicated organ in the universe. It is estimated thatthe brain has one hundred billion nerve cells and more connections in it thanthere are stars in the universe. Even though the brain consists of only about 2percent of your body’s weight, it uses about 25 percent of the calories youconsume. If you take a piece of brain tissue the size of a grain of sand, itcontains a hundred thousand neurons and a billion connections all communicatingwith one another. If you are not thoughtful, the brain loses an average ofeighty-five thousand brain cells a day, or one per second. Information in thebrain travels at the speed of 268 miles per hour, unless of course you aredrunk, which really slows things down. The brain is the organ of loving,learning, behaving, intelligence, personality, character, belief, and knowing.The brain is also very soft and it is housed in a really hard skull. Most peoplethink of the brain as firm, fixed, and rubbery. Yet that is not how it is insideyour skull. That is how it is once it is fixed in formaldehyde on thepathologist’s table. Inside your skull the brain is comprised of 80 percentwater and is the consistency of soft butter or custard, somewhere between eggwhites and Jell-O. In Another Day in the Frontal Lobe, neurosurgeon KatrinaFirlik describes the brain “like tofu, the soft kind, which when caught insuction during surgery slurps into the tube.”Your soft tofulike brain is housed in a really hard skull that has many ridges.These ridges damage the brain during trauma, so why would you ever let a childhit a soccer ball with their heads, play tackle football (even with helmets),skateboard, or snowboard or ski without helmets? Unless you didn’t like them,why would you buy your teenagers a motorcycle or take them four-wheeling in thedesert? From a neuroscientist’s point of view, these are dangerous activitiesthat could grievously injure the brain. Sports like boxing, football, motocross,and cage fighting are simply not worth the risk. The brain loves physicalactivity and it is better to think about safer brain sports such as tennis,table tennis, track and field (although not pole vaulting), and basketball.A 2007 study by John Adams and colleagues at the University of CincinnatiCollege of Medicine found that hitting a soccer ball with one’s head may belinked to long-term brain injury and memory problems later in life. Researchersfound evidence of reduced gray matter in the brains of male college soccerplayers, compared with young men who had never played.The single most important thing I have learned from looking at tens of thousandsof scans is that mild traumatic brain injuries change people’s whole lives (bydamaging their brain) and no one knows it. The brain-injured person oftensubsequent to the injury suffers from emotional, behavioral, or cognitiveproblems that may lead him to a psychiatrist or psychologist, who typicallynever looks at the brain. Problems that are physically based are oftenconsidered psychological. If you never look at the brain, you will likely misswhat many researchers have called the silent epidemic. There are two millionreported new brain injury cases every year, and millions of others that gounnoticed.When I first started the imaging work, I saw a lot of brain injury patterns onscans. When I asked patients about a history of head injuries they denied them.When I pressed, a whole new world opened up. I found out that people oftenforgot significant injuries. I had to ask them three, four, even ten times. Manypeople forget or they did not realize that they have had a serious brain injury.You would be amazed by how many people after repeatedly saying no to thisquestion suddenly get an “aha” look on their face and say, “Why yes, I fell outof a second-story window at age seven.” Or they tell us they went through thewindshield of a car headfirst, had concussions playing football or soccer, orfell down a flight of stairs. Not all brain injuries, even serious ones, willcause damage—there is an interaction between genetic vulnerability and trauma.Moreover, the brain is buffered by the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes it.Still, damage can occur more than most know.So many of the troubled people we see at the Amen Clinics have had a braininjury (or two or three). Damaging your brain may limit or impair your abilityto be successful in any area of your life. People who have experienced headinjuries have a higher incidence of drug abuse, alcoholism, mood problems,divorce, domestic violence, arrests, financial problems, and every other type oftrouble that leads to failure. Be smart. If you want to be your best, protectyour soft brain.2. DO A BETTER JOB OF TAKING CARE OF YOUNGER BRAINSMost people think that we become adults when we turn eighteen years old. That isa societal definition, but it is not true from a brain science perspective. Theprefrontal cortex, the part of our brain that makes us most human (forethought,judgment, impulse control, learning from our mistakes—the stuff of maturity),does not finish developing until we are about twenty-five years old. Theinsurance industry knew this long before neuroscientists, as twenty-five is theage when your car insurance rates go down because you become a more thoughtfuldriver.As the brain matures, nerve cells become wrapped in a white, fatty substancecalled myelin (a process known as myelinization). Like wrapping copper wireswith insulation, myelin protects and helps nerve cells work up to ten times moreefficiently. Myelinization starts from the back part of the brain and worksforward. The occipital lobes, involved with vision, myelinate within the firstfew months of life, so we can see more detail. It is not until we are much olderthat the prefrontal cortex becomes myelinated. Current research, including ours,suggests it is at about age twenty-five. From a study we did at the AmenClinics, involving more than sixty-three hundred patient scans, we found thatthe activity in the prefrontal cortex does not become stable until we are in ourmidtwenties.Why is this so important? Since the brain is not finished developing until weare in our midtwenties, we should be doing a much better job protecting ourteenage and young adult brains. Too often parents give up on their teenagers anddo not supervise what they eat, allow them to get little sleep, don’t getterribly upset about early drinking or marijuana use, and permit them to drivein unsafe vehicles. We allow our kids to go away to college too soon, where theyengage in brain-destroying behaviors, such as heavy drinking, nonstop violentvideo games, Internet gambling, and pornography, and we are ready to toss themout of the house when they are eighteen, if they irritate us. I know my threeadult children (ages thirty-one, twenty-six, and twenty-one) have much betterjudgment now than they did at age eighteen. I can certainly say the same thingabout my own behavior. Once this brain research was released, the Supreme Courtbanned executing murderers who committed their crimes when they were teenagers.Take this concept a step further. Parents spend billions of dollars each yeartrying to help their children be successful. We spend money on private schools,summer camps, and lessons of all sorts, including martial arts, athletics,music, and dance. We spend time tutoring them or hiring tutors for them. Withall the time and effort spent on helping them be their best, we should notforget the most important organ that actually tells the body how to hit the golfshot, remembers the karate kata, hears the prosody of music, and improvises inmodern dance. Spending time and money on youth brain health is one of thesmartest investments in your child’s, teenager’s, and young adult’s future. Somesimple things to do for children and teens is to teach them about the importanceof their brain, how to take care of it, protect it, feed it properly, get enoughsleep, avoid toxic substances such as drugs or alcohol, and share the majorconcepts with them from this book and another of my books, Making a Good BrainGreat. Once properly educated, I find children and teens are much better attaking care of their own brains.3. BOOST BLOOD FLOWBlood is especially important to the brain. Even though the brain is composed ofonly 2 percent of the body’s weight, it uses 20 percent of the body’s blood flowand oxygen supply. Blood flow to the brain is rarely thought about as importantby the general public, unless a disaster strikes, such as a stroke or ananeurysm. Yet good blood flow is absolutely essential to the brain’s health.This is one reason I favor brain SPECT as our primary imaging study. Itspecifically looks at blood flow patterns in the brain.Blood brings oxygen, sugar, vitamins, and other nutrients to the brain and takesaway carbon dioxide and other toxic waste products. Anything that limits bloodflow prematurely ages all of your body’s organs. Consider the skin of smokers.Most people can tell if someone is a smoker by looking at his or her skin. Asmoker’s skin is more likely to be deeply wrinkled and even perhaps tinged witha yellow or gray color. Why? Nicotine in cigarettes is a powerful constrictor ofblood flow to every organ in the body, including the skin and the brain.Deprived of vital nutrients, the smoker’s body will look and the brain willthink older than they are.Unless you actively do something to change it, blood flow throughout your bodydecreases over time, especially to the brain. Blood vessels become droopy andblood pressure rises, limiting blood supply. To stay young of heart and mind, itis essential to understand the factors that limit blood flow and eliminate them.Improving blood flow is the fountain of youth.Whatever is good for your heart is good for your brain. Since I wrote Sex on theBrain, I also realized that whatever is good for your heart is good for yourbrain is also good for your genitals. Blood flow to your genitals is essentialfor both men and women to have healthy, passionate, satisfying sex lives. Didyou know that 40 percent of forty-year-olds have erectile (blood flow)dysfunction? And 70 percent of seventy-year-olds have erectile dysfunction too?No wonder commercials for Cialis, Levitra, and Viagra are everywhere. Thestartling statistics for erectile dysfunction are an indication that heart andbrain problems are also much more common than most people think.Here is a partial list of factors that limit or disrupt blood flow.• Stress. The overflow of the stress chemical adrenaline constricts blood flowto many areas of the body.• Caffeine. This substance directly constricts blood flow to the brain, disruptssleep, and is involved in dehydration.• Nicotine. This substance constricts blood flow everywhere.• Dehydration. The brain is 80 percent water. Anything that dehydrates you makesit harder to think. I once did a scan of a famous bodybuilder. His brainresembled that of a drug addict’s, but he vehemently denied it. Then I learnedthat he significantly dehydrates himself before photo shoots to look leaner forthe camera, and he had one of these photo shoots the day after his first scan.When he was adequately hydrated the following week, his brain looked much better(see Images 2.2 and 2.3).• Artery disease/heart disease. Both directly limit blood flow.• Diabetes. A small blood vessel disease, diabetes limits blood flow, makesblood vessels brittle, and prevents the healing of damaged tissue.• Environmental toxins. These toxins poison blood vessels.• Lack of sleep. People who get less than six hours a sleep at night have loweroverall blood flow to the brain.• Lack of exercise. In addition to weakening the heart pump, too little exerciseallows blood vessels to become droopy and less efficient.• Drug or alcohol abuse. These substances are directly toxic to the vascularsystem. Drugs or alcohol cause a toxic swiss cheese appearance on scans from theoverall decreased blood flow.To increase healthy blood flow throughout your body and brain, you need to getenough sleep; drink plenty of water; avoid substances that dehydrate you, suchas caffeine and alcohol; stop any medications or bad habits (like smoking) thatmay be constricting blood flow; and consider taking supplements such as fishoil, gingko, ginseng, and L-arginine that boost blood flow. Probably the mostimportant thing to do is to eliminate any toxins and to exercise.image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_013_r1.jpg]Image 2.2: Bodybuilder’sDehydrated Brainimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_014_r1.jpg]Image 2.3: Bodybuilder’sAdequately Hydrated Brain4. INCREASE YOUR BRAIN’S RESERVEHave you ever wondered why certain stresses or injuries affect some people andnot others? I have. I have wondered why some people get depressed after losing aparent while others, although sad, keep going; why some people, after a minorhead injury, seem to really be affected, while others don’t; or why some peoplecan work many hours straight, while others are completely spent after a shortperiod of time. Several years ago, after looking at many thousands of brainscans, I started to think about the concept of brain reserve. Brain reserve isthe cushion, margin, or extra neurons that we have, to deal with unexpectedevents or insults. The more reserve we have, the more stresses or injuries wecan handle. The less reserve, the more vulnerable we are.When we are conceived, we all start with the same reserve. Many things can erodeit; many things can boost it. For example, if your mother smoked, drank muchalcohol, or was under constant stress when she was pregnant with you, shedecreased your brain’s reserve. If she took fish oil, listened to classicalmusic, and meditated every day, it is likely she increased your reserve. If youfell down a flight of stairs at age three, were exposed to chronic stress froman alcoholic mother or father during childhood, were sexually molested as achild or teenager, drank too much alcohol or used drugs, you decreased orlimited your brain’s reserve. On the other hand, if you were fed a healthy diet,took fish oil, were raised by loving, consistent parents, and were exposed tomany different kinds of learning, your brain’s reserve was likely increased.Anything that harms brain function starts to erode your brain’s reserve. Hereare some factors known to decrease brain reserve.• Prenatal or birth injuries• Brain injuries• Excessive alcohol• Drug abuse• Negative thinking• Poor diet• Environmental toxins• Chronic stress• Lack of sleep / sleep apnea• Smoking• Excessive caffeine• Too much television or violent video games• Lack of exerciseLikewise, maintaining a brain healthy life will increase your reserve orhardiness to deal with pending stresses or trouble. I always want to beincreasing my brain reserve, so I can deal with the crises that inevitably willcome my way. Here are a number of ways to do it.• Make positive social connections.• Engage in new learning.• Maintain a healthy diet.• Take a daily multiple vitamin.• Take a fish oil supplement.• Learn music.• Exercise regularly.• Dance (of course, without drinking).• Engage in positive thinking.• Express gratitude.• Meditate.If you wish to stay healthy during stressful times, you need adequate brainreserve. Start working today to add more neurons to your life.5. MAINTAIN THE BRAIN’S HARDWAREYour brain not only has to grow, develop, and mature, it has to repair itself onan ongoing basis. It is not like a car that can be taken into the mechanic whenit needs a tune-up or a part replaced. Your brain has mechanisms to repair thedamage as a result of the normal wear and tear of life. The hardware has to bemaintained in order for the brain to consistently function at its best.It is still commonly believed that we are born with all the brain cells we willever have. Because of this notion, scientists considered brain damageirreversible and neurological disease unstoppable. In stunning research withinthe last decade, investigators demonstrated that adult human brains generate newcells after all. Since then, scientists have been furiously studying theimplications that has accelerated research in this area.Neurogenesis means birth, but the birth cycle is begun by death. Let’s say yougo to a New Year’s Eve party and have a little too much champagne. You come homeand sleep it off. By the time you awake, several hundred thousand neurons havedied from alcohol toxicity. Somehow, the number of neurons in your brain has tobe brought back up to normal. Neurogenesis is the process that develops andmaintains the functional capacity of brain circuits by replacing neurons thatare killed or damaged. The very act of the neurons’dying triggers certain growthfactors in the brain to stimulate the formation of new neurons. But neurogenesisdoesn’t know when to stop; left on its own it will continue creating new neuronsuntil the brain explodes. The brain has to regulate itself so that just theright numbers of neurons are maintained. When the number generated reaches acertain level, cell death is triggered, which miraculously brings the numberback down. Yet once again, this death mechanism does not know when to stopkilling, and thus new neuron formation is triggered again. This process allowsthe brain cell growth to stay within a certain range, so that the circuits canalways function well—at least under normal conditions.Think of this repair process as the brain’s governor, whose main job is togovern the population. It must maintain the right balance or all hell will breakloose. Aging occurs when more cells die than are made. Cancer occurs when cellsoverproliferate. Encouraging brain health encourages neurogenesis.6. YOUR ABILITY TO CONTROL YOUR LIFE IS DIRECTLY TIED TO THE HEALTH OF YOURBRAINMost people have a black or white conception of free will. That was my thoughtbefore I started my work with brain imaging. Growing up Roman Catholic I had theidea that we could all equally decide to do good or bad. It was a simpledecision that led to heaven or hell, and we all had the same ability to choose,unless of course someone was mentally retarded or had another brain illness,such as Alzheimer’s disease or schizophrenia, that took away their self-control.After looking at tens of thousands of brains in my own patients I have come torealize the free will is really a very gray concept. I think most of us haveabout 85 percent free will, until you drink a six-pack of Bud Lite, which dropsfree will to about 50 percent. But what if someone, through disease or damage,starts with 50 percent free will? That same six-pack of Bud Lite could cause adisaster in their lives.In the first several years of scanning the brain, criminal attorneys heard aboutmy work and sent us people to scan who had done some really awful things. Mostof the time, though not always, these people had really bad brain function. Itbecame clear that the health of the brain was related to decision making.In one very sad case from Healdsburg, a city about an hour north of SanFrancisco, a sixteen-year-old boy, Jose, senselessly attacked another teenager,Dillon, because of the color of the sweater he wore. Referred to as the RedSweater Case, the city was outraged. Jose had been “hotboxing” before he losthis temper. A group of teenagers, including Jose, were inside a VW Beetle withthe windows rolled up, smoking joints. Being in a closed space with multiplepeople smoking increases the concentration of marijuana in the body, thus theterm hotboxing. Shortly afterward, Jose saw Dillon walking his dog across thestreet. Dillon was wearing a red sweater. Jose, a wannabe gang member whosecolor was red, confronted Dillon and asked him what color he claimed. Dillonsaid he didn’t claim any color and started to walk off. Jose said, “Wronganswer,” and senselessly beat him nearly to death. Dillon was in a coma forthree weeks and ended up with serious brain damage.As part of developing a defense, Jose’s attorney sent him for neuropsychologicaltesting, which revealed probable damage to his prefrontal cortex, the part ofthe brain involved in judgment, empathy, planning, and impulse control. Theneuropsychologist suggested the attorney contact me to scan Jose’s brain. TheSPECT study was very abnormal. Jose had severe decreased activity in hisprefrontal cortex and temporal lobes (implicated in learning disabilities andviolence) and increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, which is thebrain’s “gear shifter,” causing him to be rigid and inflexible and to fixate onnegative thoughts (see Image 2.4).Clearly, Jose had an abnormal brain. He had suffered several brain injuries inthe past, including being beaten unconscious by a heavy chain, and he hadexperienced severe emotional trauma. His mother was murdered when he was eightyears old and he had witnessed much violence. Even when he was not smokingmarijuana, Jose suffered with a vulnerable brain. Put him in the wrongsituation, under the influences of something that diminishes brain functionfurther, even marijuana, and he is likely to explode.image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_015_r1.jpg]Image 2.4: Jose’s BrainArrows are pointing to the prefrontal cortex (top) and temporal lobe.I received a lot of criticism for testifying at Jose’s trial, even threateningphone calls to my office. People said I was providing a high-tech excuse for badbehavior. But the truth was that Jose did not have full access to his own brain,the organ that controls behavior. It didn’t mean that he didn’t do the crime. Hedid. It didn’t mean he was not responsible for it. He was. What it does mean isthat the jury should take into consideration that he was literally not dealingwith a complete set of brain cells and they should send him to a place where hecould get appropriate treatment. Odds are, whatever the sentence, he will gohome at some point. He will be less likely to reoffend, if his brain was helped.In fact, the jury did use imaging information for mitigation. Rather thanreceiving twenty-five years, which the prosecution wanted, the jury sentencedhim to eleven years, recommending he go to a place that would provide Jose withtreatment.Why is it that some people explode in certain situations and others do not? Ithink we must consider the vulnerability of the brain. The better our brainswork, the less likely we are to do bad or stupid things."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_016_r1.jpg]Brain Envyimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]ELIMINATE THE DAILY HABITS THAT HOLD YOU BACKBad habits are like chains that are too light to feel until they are too heavyto carry.—WARREN BUFFETTLucy, a well-respected scientist and entrepreneur in her early fifties fromBoston, came to see me after selling her company. Even though she wasfinancially set for life, there was so much stress associated with the sale thatshe had trouble sleeping, was racked with anxiety, and had obsessive tendenciesthat she thought she had left behind in her twenties. As part of our evaluationwe performed a set of brain SPECT scans. Her husband, Arnie, came along and alsogot scanned, in his mind, to support his wife. He was just curious. I looked ather brain and saw the trouble I had expected and recommended a course oftreatment. When I looked at Arnie’s fifty-six-year-old brain, it looked like hewas eighty (see Image 3.1). I asked him what he was doing to hurt his brain.“Nothing, Dr. Amen,” he said with a look of disbelief.“Really?” I said, feeling a little confused as to why his brain looked so bad.“How much do you drink?”“Oh, not very much,” he replied.“What’s not very much?” I asked. Through the years I have learned to always askthis follow-up, clarifying question.“Oh, maybe I have three or four drinks a day.”image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_017_r1.jpg]Image 3.1: Arnie’s Brain“Every day?” I said.“Yeah, every day. But it’s never a problem. I never get drunk. I have nevergotten into trouble with it,” Arnie said with anxiety.“Why do you drink every day?” I asked.“Since my daughter went off to college I have this empty nest thing going on.The time I used to spend with her, I now spend at a local pub, seeing myfriends. It’s a social time, kind of like the show Cheers.”“Well, you are poisoning yourself,” I said. “You’re fifty-six and your brainlooks like it’s eighty. If you keep this up, pretty soon your brain is going tolook a lot worse, and with that comes trouble with everything in your life.”Arnie was shocked that his brain looked as bad as it did. As we talked, I couldsee he was beginning to develop “brain envy.” After learning about his brain, itwas clear he wanted his to function better. I gave him a very specific brainhealthy plan that included abstinence from alcohol, regular exercise, mentalexercise, vitamins, supplements, and fish oil. Four months later he wrote mesaying that he mentally felt like he was twenty years old. His energy and memorywere better, and he felt smarter and more articulate. His work as a businessconsultant had also improved, and he started writing a book about his work,something he had wanted to do five years earlier but could never find the timeor motivation.Personally Confronted with Bad Brain HabitsOver the years I have personally had ten brain SPECT studies, beginning at agethirty-seven when we first started to do scans. Looking back, my early scansshowed a toxic, scalloped appearance that was definitely not consistent withgreat brain function (see Image 3.2). My last scan, at age fifty-two, lookedhealthier and much younger than my scan fifteen years earlier, even though scansusually become significantly less active with age (see Image 3.3). Why? In theintervening years, I developed “brain envy” and wanted a better brain. As Ilearned about brain health, I put into practice what I preached to my patientsand readers.All of my life I have been someone who rarely drank alcohol and never used anillegal drug. Then why did my brain not look great? Before I understood aboutbrain health, I had many bad brain habits. I ate lots of fast food, lived ondiet sodas filled with aspartame, often would get by on four to five hours ofsleep at night, worked like a nut, didn’t exercise with any regularity, and wasliving in a marriage filled with chronic conflict and stress.Your daily habits and routines, as we will see, are either hurting or helpingyour brain. In this chapter we will look at one of the major obstacles to yoursuccess—your behavior each day. This chapter begins with a “Bad Brain HabitQuiz” to show you your strengths and weaknesses. Then we will explore fourteenbad brain habits that span all age groups and finish the chapter by consideringbad brain habits across the life span as they relate specifically to childhood,adolescence, early adulthood, middle age, and the elderly.image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_018_r1.jpg]Image 3.2: My Scan at Age Thirty-Sevenimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_019_r1.jpg]Image 3.3: My Scan at Age Fifty-TwoNotice there is less bumpiness or scalloping on the scan at age fifty-two.As you read about these bad habits, I can hear some of you thinking, much likemy patients or the teenagers who took our high school course “Making a GoodBrain Great” have said, “How am I going to have any fun, if I have to watcheverything I do every day?” My usual response is that you have much more funwith a healthy brain than with one that is out of sync. A healthy brain is morethoughtful, playful, insightful, romantic, productive, and wealthier. Do youthink you will have more fun if you can stay in a great relationship, keep ameaningful job, save your money to spend it on planned, fun activities, and beable to think well into your later years, as opposed to four-wheeling in thedesert (rife for brain injuries), being drunk or high, or living with chronicanger?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------BAD BRAIN HABIT QUIZPlease rate each question on a scale of 0 to 4.01234NANeverRarelyOccasionallyFrequentlyVery FrequentlyNot Applicable____ 1.

Every cell in your body, including brain cells,make themselves new every five months. Some cells, like those that make up yourskin, regenerate every thirty days. Eating a healthy, balanced diet provides thenutrients and fuel to drive optimal brain function. Your diet makes a bigdifference in how you feel. Yet so many of us are diet disasters. Obesity anddiabetes are at epidemic proportions. Both of these problems are directlyrelated to diet and are risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease. What you eat on adaily basis helps or hurts your brain.How are your eating habits? Do you skip breakfast? Do you grab two doughnuts inthe morning on the way to work, with the large coffee filled with flavored creamand sugar? Or do you think you are being smart by saving the calories from thesugar and using aspartame? Do you grab a diet soda and think that all you aregetting is sweet, bubbly water? Do you allow yourself to get so hungry that yougorge at lunch or dinner? Do you keep candy in your desk at work or easy to getat in the cabinets? Do you plan your meals or only think about them when you arehungry? Are you a sucker for supersizing meals? Do you gorge late at night?The best brain diets include the following.• Lots of pure water. The brain is 80 percent water.• Few calories. Obesity is bad for your brain, as fat stores toxic materials andobesity doubles the risk for Alzheimer’s disease.• Lean protein. Fish, chicken, lean pork, and beef, for example, all help buildneurons.• Complex, low glycemic carbohydrates. These include whole grains, fruits, andvegetables.• Healthy fats. Fish, avocados, and raw nuts all maintain nerve cell membranesand myelin.•. Lots of dietary antioxidants, such as blueberries. I often tell my patientsto eat from the rainbow (food with many different colors, although this does notmean Skittles). See my book Making a Good Brain Great for more suggestions for abrain healthy diet.2. LACK OF EXERCISENo matter what your age, being a physical slug is bad for your brain, even ifyou are spending all of your time doing New York Times crossword puzzles. Thebrain needs physical exercise. Without it, the brain struggles. Exercise boostsblood flow to the brain, which helps supply oxygen, glucose, and nutrients andtakes away toxic substances. Anything that limits blood flow results in pooreroxygenation, glucose delivery, and nutrient deficiencies. If the deep areas ofthe brain are starved of healthy blood flow you will have problems withcoordination and processing complex thoughts. Exercise also increasesbrain-derived neurotrophic factor, a chemical that helps with neurogenesis. Whenwe lose more cells than we make, aging occurs. In laboratory rats, researchshows that exercise generates new brain cells in the prefrontal cortex (judgmentand thoughtfulness) and temporal lobes (memory), which survive for about fourweeks and then die off unless they are stimulated. If you stimulate these newneurons through mental or social interaction, they connect to other neurons andenhance learning. This is why people who only work out at the gym are not assmart as people who work out at the gym and then go to the library. At everyage, exercise helps keep the brain healthy. Without it, we become fatter, lessintelligent, and definitely not happier.The best exercises combine aerobic elements, which means you get your heart rateup, with some form of coordination movement. Coordination movements activate thecerebellum, at the back bottom part of the brain, and enhances thinking,cognitive flexibility, and processing speed. Dancing is a perfect exercise,especially learning new steps, but if you drink when you dance that completelyruins the benefit. The other perfect brain exercise is table tennis. It is greatfor your cerebellum, because you have to get your eyes, your hands, and yourfeet all to work together at the same time, while you are thinking about thespins on the ball. I think of table tennis as aerobic chess. And it involvesvery few brain injuries. In 1999 I played in the U.S. National Table TennisTournament with hundreds of other people and there was not one brain injury.According to a new brain imaging study from Japan, table tennis helps balanceyour brain. Researchers studied a group of patients before and after playingtable tennis and showed increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, thethoughtful part of your brain, and the cerebellum, just after playing for tenminutes. More table tennis, less football and boxing!3. RISKING BRAIN TRAUMAEven though I discussed this earlier, it bears repeating. Brain injuries canhave a devastating impact on your life, no matter what your age. I have hadpatients who fell down a flight of stairs at age three, fell out of asecond-story window at seven, and fell off the roof in middle age. I’ve hadother patients suffer severe skateboarding accidents in their early teens,snowboarding accidents in their later teens, and four-wheeling accidents asyoung adults. I’ve had elderly patients who experienced bad falls. All of theseinjuries have the potential to damage the brain and compromise your abilitiesand happiness. Does your day-to-day behavior increase or decrease the risk ofbrain injuries?• Do you speed in your car or text-message on your phone while driving?• Do you head soccer balls? This has been shown to damage the front tips of yourtemporal lobes (potentially affecting memory, language, and emotional control).• Do you play tackle football? In a study from Virginia Tech, high schoolfootball players get hit in the head an average of thirty to fifty times a game,sometimes with the force of a severe car accident.• Do you ride bikes, skateboard, ski, sled, or snowboard without helmets thatfit snugly? A helmet that fits is much more protective than one that doesn’t.Bike riding is the number one cause of brain injuries in children and teens.• Do you go four-wheeling, off-roading, with all-terrain vehicles, Jet Skiing,or boat racing?• Do you drink alcohol? This increases your risk of a brain injury from a motorvehicle accident, falls, or making someone else mad enough at you to give you abrain injury.• Are you taking medications or drugs that make you unsteady on your feet ordecrease your reaction time, increasing your risk of injury?• Do you drive without your seat belt buckled or while talking on a cell phone?• Do you box or play extreme sports that place you at increased risk?There are many more daily habits that increase your risk of injury. Rememberthat your brain is soft and your skull is hard. Respect and protect your brain.4. CHRONIC STRESSChronic or severe stress, stemming from family conflict, financial hardships,health problems, or environmental challenges, can affect all age groups. Whenstress becomes unremitting, it hurts the brain. In a series of studies reportedin the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology, researchers looked at the effects oflong-term exposure to stress hormones, especially cortisol, on the brainfunction of older adults, young adults, and children. In the first study,researchers measured levels of cortisol in a group of older adults over a periodof three to six years. They found that older adults with continuously highlevels of cortisol performed worse on memory tests than older adults withmoderate or low cortisol levels. In addition, older adults with long-termexposure to high cortisol levels also had, on average, a 14 percent smallerhippocampus, the area of the temporal lobes involved with memory. In tests withyoung adults, researchers found that short, temporary increases in cortisolnegatively affected their thinking and memory skills. But these impairments wereonly temporary. Another study with young children and teenagers from differentsocioeconomic classes showed that children with lower socioeconomic status hadhigher average stress hormone levels than the other children. Taken togetherthese studies show that chronic stress impairs the brain function for people ofall ages.High cortisol levels not only shrink the hippocampus, but they also make you fatby disrupting several hormones involved in appetite control. In addition, dailystress increases blood pressure, disrupts sleep patterns, and increases negativethinking patterns, all of which hurt brain function. Having techniques tocounteract stress, such as daily relaxation, meditation, prayer, or exercise,can have a positive effect on how your mind works.5. NEGATIVE THINKING, CHRONIC WORRY, OR ANGERThinking is a habit. Negative, worried, or angry thinking is a bad habit thatresults from a lack of “thoughtful” education. Most people think that thoughtsjust happen. We are not taught to question or correct the negative words orimages that run wild in our heads. Yet these awful thoughts are often at thecore of anxiety and depressive disorders, relationship and work problems, andthey have a real, measurable, negative biological impact on brain function.Our brain and body respond to every thought we have. At all ages, includingyoung children, the quality of our thoughts is either helping us or hurting us.Positive, happy, hopeful thoughts release chemicals that help you feel good;negative, worried, or angry thoughts release a completely different set ofchemicals that make you feel bad and erode the functioning of your brain.Depression, often the result of rampant, unquestioned negative thoughts, doublesthe risk for Alzheimer’s disease, increases your risk for substance abuse toself-medicate the bad feelings, and pushes other people away, increasingisolation and loneliness.6. POOR SLEEPDo you go to bed late and get up early? Do you toss and turn, look at the clock,wonder when morning will come, or become disgusted with yourself that you haveno power to turn your mind off? Sleep is essential to healthy brain function.People who get fewer than six hours a night have decreased blood flow to thebrain, and they have trouble thinking clearly during the day. Sleep problems arerampant in our society. According to the National Institutes of Health, 30percent of the population has chronic sleep problems and 10 percent are affectedby symptoms of sleep deprivation during the day. The prescriptions for sleepmedications, such as Ambien and Lunesta, have skyrocketed in the past decade. Weare in the midst of an insomnia epidemic. In 1900, Americans, on average, gotnine hours of sleep a night. In 2008, we got only an average of six hours ofsleep at night. Our brains were not designed to have a 33 percent decrease insleep in such a short period of time. The advent of the lightbulb is the likelycause of the change.Shift workers, those suffering from jet lag, teens who have their sleepschedules off-kilter, and those suffering from sleep apnea are all at risk forpoorer brain function. Those who are sleep deprived score poorer on memory andmath tests, have lower grades in school, and are at much greater risk fordriving accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration, drowsiness and fatigue cause more than one hundred thousandtraffic accidents each year and young drivers are at the wheel in more than halfthe crashes. Sleep deprivation is also associated with depression and attentiondeficit disorders. Recently, sleep apnea (snoring loudly, breath holding whensleeping, and tiredness during the day) has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease.Sleep is involved in rejuvenating the brain. Without it, people can becomepsychotic. When I was the chief of Community Mental Health at Fort Irwin in theMojave Desert we saw a number of soldiers who started to hear voices and becameparanoid after being sleep deprived for up to three days in a row. Fort Irwin ishome to the National Training Center, which teaches soldiers desert warfare.Troops spent days at a time in war games without much sleep. Mental healthcasualties were always high during those periods of time.Try to get seven to eight hours of sleep at night, more for children and teens.Practice good sleep habits, such as avoiding much caffeine or nicotine. Also, donot use alcohol as a sleep aid, as it will wear off and cause you to rebound andwake up in the middle of the night; avoid exercise before bed; and learnrelaxation techniques to calm your mind.7. CIGARETTE SMOKENicotine prematurely ages the brain. Nicotine, found in cigarettes, cigars,chewing tobacco, and nicotine patches, tablets, and gums, causes blood vesselsto constrict, lessening blood flow to vital organs. Smokers experience moreproblems with impotence because of low blood flow to sexual organs. Nicotineconstricts blood flow to the skin, making smokers look older than they are.Nicotine also constricts blood flow to the brain, depriving the brain of thenutrients it needs, and eventually causing overall lowered activity. If thissubstance is so bad, then why do people use it? In the short run, nicotine, likealcohol and other drugs of abuse, makes many people feel better. It stimulatesthe release of several brain neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, whichimproves your reaction time and your ability to pay attention. It alsostimulates dopamine, which acts on the pleasure centers of the brain, andglutamate, which is involved in learning and memory (although high glutamatelevels cause programmed cell death and is associated with causing Alzheimer’sdisease). No wonder people use nicotine and have trouble quitting. But if youwant a healthy brain, do what you can to stay away from it.Secondhand smoke is harmful to everyone, especially developing minds. Motherswho smoke during pregnancy are more likely to have children who have behavioraland learning problems. Additionally, secondhand smoke increases asthma,infections, and cancer. Smoking is a very bad brain habit.8. EXCESSIVE CAFFEINEFound in coffee, tea, dark sodas, chocolate, and pep pills, caffeine constrictsblood flow to the brain and many other organs. A little caffeine a day is not aproblem, but more than a cup or two of coffee a day can be trouble. Caffeinedoes four bad things to the brain. First, it dehydrates it, and anything thatdehydrates the brain causes us to have problems thinking. Second, it interfereswith sleep. Caffeine blocks adenosine, a chemical that tells us to go to sleep.By blocking adenosine, we can get by with less sleep. But as we have seen, sleepis essential for healthy brain function. No wonder so many people need a cup ofcoffee in the morning to get going. They are treating their sleep-deprivationsymptoms. Third, caffeine also constricts blood flow to the brain, causingpremature aging. Lastly, caffeine is addictive. Many people have significantwithdrawal symptoms, such as headaches and tiredness, when they try to stop.Less caffeine is better.9. ASPARTAME AND MSGMany people drink diet sodas by the gallons, thinking that they are drinkingnothing more than sweet water. I have had my share of diet drinks in my life,but when I read about the negative effects of aspartame, I became concerned.From the age of thirty I started to have arthritis in my hands and knees. When Istopped the aspartame, my joints no longer hurt. I have also had many patientsreport feeling better after stopping the intake of artificial sweeteners. Theirheadaches went away, they could think more clearly, joint pain improved, memoryimproved, and surprisingly, some even lost weight. My sense is that it alsodepends on our own genetic makeup. Some people seem to have no problems withartificial sweeteners, while others have terrible reactions to them. Less isbetter.Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is another problem for many. Personally, I getheadaches when it is in something I eat. But it is nothing like the reaction ofone of my patients. This man came to see us from the Midwest. He had attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and some anxiety and depressive symptoms.In his history, he told us he became violent when exposed to any MSG. As part ofhis evaluation we scanned him; at his request, we did an additional scan on MSG.The MSG scan showed a significant left temporal lobe deficit, which is oftenassociated with violence or rage reactions. I told him he had a choice to stayaway from MSG or take medication to protect his temporal lobes. To my surprisehe decided to take the medication just in case. When asked why, he said that ifhe lost his temper one more time his wife would leave him and you never knowwhat has MSG in it. When possible, hold the MSG.10. EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINSMost people do not wish to think they are being poisoned or poisoning themselveson a daily basis, but the frightening fact is that they may be. Painting withoutappropriate ventilation, visiting nail or hair salons too often, breathing ingas fumes as you fill up your car, using pesticides, and even remodeling yourhome have been implicated in brain damage. Understanding the sources of braintoxins can help you avoid them.Breathing paint fumes and other solvents, such as hair and nail products, arebrain toxins to approach with care. As a group, indoor painters have some of thehighest levels of brain damage I have seen. I once evaluated a famous moviedirector whose scan showed a toxic appearance. On questioning, it was clear hehad been exposed to high levels of paint fumes on many of the sets he had workedon. Getting proper ventilation was one of the keys to helping him heal. In myconversation with him, he told me the painters were the nuttiest people he everworked with. He said they often got into fights on the sets for little or noreason and were the most unreliable. “Even the women act crazy,” he said. Nowonder, if they are exposed to chemicals that hurt the viability of braintissue. A recent study reported that hair-dressers had a higher than normal riskfor Alzheimer’s disease. When you go into a hair or nail salon, they often reekwith fumes. If you get your hair or nails done only go to shops that have greatventilation.11. EXCESSIVE TVNo matter what your age, watching too much TV, playing too many video games, orspending too much time on the computer is bad for your brain. Our brains werenot developed or evolved for the rapid change in technology that is affecting ustoday.Parents hoping to give their children an edge by using infant educationalvideos, such as Brainy Baby and Baby Einsteins, are actually holding them back,according to a report in the Journal of Pediatrics. For every hour a day thatbabies eight to sixteen months old were shown the videos they knew six to eightfewer words than other children. Parents are spending hundreds of millions ofdollars on these videos. “Unfortunately, it’s all money down the tubes,”according to one of the study’s authors, Dr. Dimitri Christakis, a professor ofpediatrics at the University of Washington in Seattle. Christakis and hiscolleagues surveyed a thousand parents in Washington and Minnesota anddetermined their babies’ vocabularies using a set of ninety common baby words,including mommy, nose, and choo-choo. The researchers found that 32 percent ofthe babies were shown the videos and 17 percent of those were shown them formore than an hour a day. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends notelevision at all for children younger than twenty-four months.Another study published in the Journal of Pediatrics reported that for everyhour a day children watch TV there is a 10 percent increased chance of thembeing diagnosed with ADHD. This means that if the child watches five hours a dayshe has a 50 percent chance of being diagnosed with ADHD. According to theAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, children spend an averageof three to four hours a day watching TV.In other studies, increased television watching in childhood put people at riskfor brain problems as adults. Dr. R. J. Hancox and colleagues from theDepartment of Preventive and Social Medicine in Dunedin, New Zealand, assessedapproximately one thousand children born in 1972–1973 at regular intervals up toage twenty-six. They found that there was a significant association betweenhigher body-mass indices, lower physical fitness, increased cigarette smoking,and raised serum cholesterol (all affect the brain). These are all factors thatare involved in brain illnesses, such as strokes or Alzheimer’s disease. In yetanother study adults who watched two or more hours a day of TV had asignificantly higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Watching TV is usually a “nobrain” activity, and less is better.12. EXCESSIVE VIDEO GAMESAs a father of four children and a child psychiatrist, I have thought a lotabout video games over the past twenty years. At first, I found them great funto play. But soon thereafter, I started to worry. Action video games have beenstudied using brain imaging techniques that look at blood flow and activitypatterns. Video games have been found to work in an area of the brain called thebasal ganglia, one of the pleasure centers in the brain. In fact, this is thesame part of the brain that lights up when researchers inject a person withcocaine. My experience with patients and one of my own children is that theytend to get hooked on the games and play so much that their school work, jobperformance, and social time can deteriorate, a bit like the effect of a drug.Some children and adults actually do get hooked on them.There is also scientific literature that reports video games may increaseseizure frequency in people who are sensitive to them. You may remember theseizure scare on December 16, 1997, when the Japanese cartoon Pocket Monster(Pokémon) showed an explosion of red, white, and yellow lights that triggered730 Japanese children to go to the hospital with new onset seizures. Thecondition is called photosensitive seizures (seizures triggered by light). Ioften think video games trigger subclinical seizures in vulnerable kids andadults, causing behavior or learning problems.Two studies from the University of Missouri examined the effects of violentvideo games (a significant percentage of video games) on aggression. One studyfound that violent real-life simulation video game play was positively relatedto aggressive behavior and delinquency. The more people played, the more troublethey seemed to have. Academic performance deteriorated with increased time spentplaying video games. In the second study, laboratory exposure to a graphicallyviolent video game increased aggressive thoughts and behavior. The results fromboth studies suggest that exposure to violent video games will increaseaggressive behavior in both the short term (e.g., laboratory aggression) and thelong term (e.g., delinquency). In a comprehensive review of other studies it wasfound time and again that exposure to violent video games is significantlylinked to increases in aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, aggressivefeelings, and cardiovascular arousal and to decreases in helping behavior; noneof this is good for overall brain health.13. EXCESSIVE COMPUTER OR CELL PHONE TIMEComputers, e-mails, the Internet, instant messaging (IMing) and cell phones aretaking over our lives, and not always to good effect. Some people, like me, getwell over a hundred e-mails a day. Some teens are IMing up to fifteen people ata time. According to a recent study, the distractions of constant e-mails, textmessages, and voice mail are a greater threat to IQ and concentration than issmoking marijuana.Drowsiness, tiredness, and an increasing inability to focus reached “startling”levels in the trials of eleven hundred people, who also demonstrated thate-mails in particular have an addictive, druglike quality. Research subjects’minds were all over the place as they faced new questions and challenges everytime an e-mail dropped into their in-box. Productivity at work was damaged andthe effect on staff who could not resist trying to juggle new messages withexisting work was the equivalent, over the course of a day, to the loss of anight’s sleep.“This is a very real and widespread phenomenon,” said Glenn Wilson, apsychologist from King’s College, London University, who carried out eightyclinical trials for the marketing research firm TNS, which were commissioned bythe information technology company Hewlett-Packard. The average IQ loss wasmeasured at 10 points, more than double the 4-point mean fall found in studiesof cannabis users. The most damage was done, according to the survey, by thealmost complete lack of discipline in handling e-mails. Dr. Wilson and hiscolleagues found a compulsion to reply to each new message, leading to constantchanges of direction, which inevitably tired and slowed down the brain.Constantly checking e-mails, IMs, voice mails, and the Internet is stressful,but it is also addictive as one is always waiting for the next good e-mail, IM,or voice message to hit, like waiting for the next blackjack in the card game21. The anticipation of something good keeps us checking something routinely. Italso distracts us from staying focused on the person or task at hand. Checkingthese messaging systems is an important way to communicate, but it is better toset aside specific times each day to work on them and leave them alone the restof the time.14. MORE THAN A LITTLE ALCOHOLContrary to popular belief, red wine, except in small quantities, is not ahealth food. In my experience as a brain imaging physician, alcohol is directlytoxic to brain function. The SPECT scans of people who consume more than threealcoholic beverages a week look toxic. Alcohol lowers overall blood flow andactivity in the brain, which is why alcohol calms anxiety and disinhibitspeople, but over time it negatively affects memory and judgment.Alcohol affects the brain by reducing nerve cell firing; it blocks oxygen fromgetting into the cell’s energy centers; and it reduces the effectiveness of manydifferent types of neurotransmitters, especially those involved in learning andremembering. Alcohol is a double-edged sword, depending on the quantity ofintake. Large amounts of it—four or more glasses of wine or the equivalent inhard liquor on a daily basis—increase the risk of dementia. However, it has beenfound that small amounts—a glass of wine once a week or once a month but notdaily—may reduce the risk. The reduced risk seems to be related to the fact thatalcohol and cholesterol compete with each other and sometimes it is good foralcohol to win. Small amounts of alcohol compete with high-density lipoprotein(HDL), the good cholesterol, which actually removes the harmful types ofcholesterol. When a person drinks a little alcohol, HDL is not allowed to bindto the cell membrane, so it is forced back into the bloodstream where it lowerslow-density lipoprotein and other harmful cholesterols. This reduces theperson’s risk of heart disease, atherosclerosis, and strokes, all of which areknown causes for dementia. On the other hand, researchers from Johns HopkinsUniversity found that even moderate alcohol consumption (about fourteen drinks aweek) has been correlated with brain shrinkage. When it comes to the brain, sizematters! My advice is that small amounts of alcohol after age twenty-five isokay, but don’t push it. Why wait until you’re twenty-five to drink? Asdiscussed earlier, the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex, is not fullydeveloped until age twenty-five. Why start poisoning it before it has had achance to fully develop?You might wonder why I put alcohol as a potential problem affecting all agegroups. If a parent has a problem with alcohol, it definitely affects the wholefamily, including the children. Parents who drink regularly tend to be lessavailable for their children and less able to see their needs.Bad Brain Habits of ChildrenBad brain habits seen in children include all of those mentioned above and more.Whenever you “give in to get along” by submitting to a child’s demands forunhealthy foods, you perpetuate a brewing disaster. Poor brain healthy foodsencourage difficult behavior, which only makes parents less able to providehealthy meals. As my friend the nutritionist Dr. J. J. Virgin says, “Exposureequals preference. What you feed children is what they will eat throughout theirlives.”A study from the department of psychology at England’s University of Southamptonresearchers confirmed what many people have suspected: food dyes and additivesare bad for children’s brains. Over three one-week periods, three hundredthree-to nine-year-old children were randomly assigned to consume one of threefruit drinks daily: one contained the amount of dye and sodium benzoatetypically found in a British child’s diet, a second drink had a lowerconcentration of the additives, and a third was additive-free. All the childrenspent a week drinking each of the three mixtures, which looked and tasted alike.During each weeklong period, teachers and parents rated such qualities asrestlessness, lack of concentration, fidgeting, and talking or interrupting toomuch. Researchers found that within an hour children were significantly morehyperactive when drinking the stuff containing additives. Stay away from dyesand food additives. Read the food labels!In general, I have found another disturbing trend over the past twenty-fiveyears. Parents are giving in more and more to difficult behavior. If a child hasa habit of whining or crying to get his or her way and the parents give in tosuch behavior, they have taught the child’s brain to whine and cry, making himmore vulnerable to mood and emotional problems later on. The two words I likebest in effective parenting are firm and kind. Children need love, attention,and affection, but they also need rules and discipline for their brain todevelop properly.Another way to develop a bad brain habit with children is by allowing them toendlessly argue with parents. When you allow children to chronically oppose orargue with you, you actually encourage their brains to be less flexible. Whenthe brain area called the anterior cingulate gyrus works too hard, owing to adeficit in the neurotransmitter serotonin, people get stuck on negative oroppositional thoughts and behaviors. Behavior therapy has been shown to helpcalm down this part of the brain. Stopping argumentative behavior actually helpsthe brain work better. One of the best ways to do this is to directly deal withthe behavior. On the bulletin board in our five-year-old’s room is a set ofseven family rules. One of the rules is “No arguing with parents. As yourparents, we want to hear your opinion. More than twice constitutes arguing.”This way, no arguing is the expectation, and cooperation is encouraged. If Chloeargues, there is a consequence. When she cooperates, there are smiles andrewards.Another concern for children is watching the same movie over and over. Once achild has seen a movie, there is little suspense or thought about what happensnext. Repetitive watching turns out to be a no-brain activity.Never reading to a child is a bad brain habit. Children need new learning toexpand their brains and they learn best in an enriched environment. The moreactive parents and caregivers are in encouraging reading and education, the morechildren will see learning as a lifelong value. New learning throughout life isthought to be a major preventive factor for Alzheimer’s disease.Children often are filled with negative or frightening thoughts that they neverlearn how to challenge. Children need education in correcting the bad thoughtsthat go through their heads. I once taught a class for third-graders called “Howto Think.” I was shocked by the number of distorted negative, hurtful, scarythoughts that frightened and depressed the kids. By age eight they are able tounderstand and correct negative thought patterns. Negative thinking can be avery bad brain habit and needs to be corrected as early as possible. It is easyto do this by teaching them about ANTs (automatic negative thoughts) andANTeaters, discussed in chapter 12.Bad Brain Habits of TeenagersTypical teenagers have many bad brain habits. Typically, they watch too much TV,play too many hours of video games, are on the computer into the wee hours ofthe morning, IM others to the distraction of all else, engage in high-risksports, are often sleep deprived, get into motor vehicle accidents, and haveterrible diets. No wonder suicide is the second-leading cause of death in thisage group. We must do better at taking care of the teenage brain. I think manyparents and school administrators prematurely abdicate the role of supervisingthis group, feeling helpless to have a real impact. Yet I have found throughteaching our high school course, “Making a Good Brain Great,” which is now usedin over thirty-four states and seven countries, that these kids are amenable toeducation and informed influence. In my mind, lack of guidance for teens is avery bad brain habit.Teens do best when their parents know where they are, who they are with, andwhat they are doing. Teens do best when they know their parents check on them.You need to be your teen’s prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain thatprovides supervision, judgment, and impulse control), until they can properlymonitor themselves. The prefrontal cortex does not fully develop until we aretwenty-five years old, so even supervising young adults is appropriate.Besides those bad habits listed above (diet, head injuries, lack of sleep,excessive caffeine, etc.), we now need to include drinking and drug use, whichare especially problematic to developing brains. I am ever amazed at how muchour teens drink and how many drugs they consume. Significant alcohol and druguse may arrest development. If people start drinking moderately or more duringadolescence, when they stop, say, in their midtwenties, they are often still atthe same emotional level as when they started.Many teens also feel invincible. Risky behaviors, such as driving fast in therain, jumping off rock cliffs into the ocean, or head banging in mosh pits, arenothing more than fun, until something terrible happens.A bad habit that teenage girls often engage in is nonstop drama. It is great tohave friends to talk about the ups and downs of teen life. Yet new researchsuggests that when girls talk on and on about the same problems, such as home orboyfriend troubles, it actually makes them feel worse.Teens who have the habit of hanging out with other teens or young adults who dodrugs, fight, or are involved in other dangerous activities are also at higherrisk for brain damage that will diminish their chances for success. Who youspend time with matters, as we often become like the significant people in ourlives.Bad Brain Habits of Young AdultsAs we leave our parents’ home and supervision to go off to college or live onour own, the bad brain habits tend to flare. There is often increased drug oralcohol usage; less sleep; poorer diets; and the stress of doing things otherpeople used to do for us, such as paying bills, grocery shopping, and planningvacations.One of the unique stresses of this age group is that you are trying to becompetent and successful on your own, which adds a burden of stress not seenbefore. Money worries are commonplace. Learning how to navigate intimaterelationships can be challenging, as your brain is starting to interact withanother brain on a deep level. Children may make their first appearance intoyour life, which, in my personal experience, dramatically increased my sense ofresponsibility and stress. No longer could I just be so focused on my own funand happiness, I had another little life to look after.Bad Brain Habits of Middle Adults (Age 30–65)Middle age is a breeding ground for stress and bad brain habits. Being theremyself, I can relate. We often work too hard, taking care of children and ourown parents; have trouble sleeping; wake up feeling tired; start the day withtwo cups of coffee; finish the day with red wine (erroneously thinking it ishealth food); and worry about jobs, finances, teenagers, and myriad otherissues. We are the world’s caretakers and often get little respect for keepingeverything going.If we add getting your hair or nails done too often (the exposure to these toxicchemicals has been associated with increased Alzheimer’s disease and bladdercancer), taking sleeping pills at night, not getting enough sex (sexualfrequency has been associated with health and longevity) or being in a distantor stressful marriage, not getting adequate exercise, carrying around fiftyextra pounds, focusing on our failures, you have the prescription for anxietypills and forgetfulness. No wonder we start to look old.Bad Brain Habits of Older Adults (> Age 65)By this stage of life people have accumulated many or most of the bad habitsdescribed above. I once had an eighty-four-year-old patient whose daughterbought her a poker video game. She really enjoyed the game and played more thanfour hours a day. Her family noticed that she started to have trouble sleepingand was becoming more anxious and irritable. When she stopped playing, she wentback to her normal, happy, sleeping, relaxed self.A lack of exercise is now at its peak, as aches and pains start to creep in.Taking fish oil on a daily basis can significantly help joints feel more limberand less painful. Television watching is as high or higher than at any otherstage, which is very troubling, as those who watch the most TV have the highestincidence of Alzheimer’s disease.Focusing on disappointments in the past is a common trait in the elderly, and itcan be very harmful to mood and health. A lack of new learning causes the brainto become tired. To keep the brain young throughout life it must be challenged.Social isolation is also very common as friends and siblings die at everincreasing rates. Being involved with social activities is important to brainhealth.I have treated many elderly patients who have taken up new hobbies. I love thisfor them, except when they take up painting and do not have good ventilation.The elderly brain is potentially very vulnerable to toxicity.Dietary deficiencies are common, as many elderly live alone and are morereticent to cook for only one person. In addition, dehydration is common, asthey may not be getting enough fluids, or they are taking diuretics to lowertheir blood pressure. In addition, many elderly are seeing multiple doctors andtaking multiple medications every day, without having a personal physician whooversees everything a patient takes. I have seen truly awful brain functionassociated with myriad medications.Once you learn to love your brain and eliminate the bad brain habits thatdestroy your best chances for success, you are ready to use your brain to itsfullest potential to reach your dreams."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_020_r1.jpg]Hidden Short Circuits May Be Ruining Your Lifeimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]LEARN HOW TO IDENTIFY AND CORRECT YOUR VULNERABLE AREASWhen Edward came to the Amen Clinic he was driving a truck for a living. He hadjust split from his second wife, felt sad and extremely anxious, and was havingsuicidal thoughts. He frequently had the urge to drive his truck off a bridge orover a cliff. When I went to the waiting room to greet Edward for the first timeI saw him drawing in an artist’s sketchbook. When I asked, he hesitantly showedme his picture. It was amazing. I thought that he must have been a trainedprofessional artist, yet it was not mentioned in the background information Ihad just read about him.Edward’s clinical evaluation and brain scans revealed he suffered fromdepression, anxiety, and ADHD. All of his adult life he had struggled to keepjobs and was a never-ending source of frustration to his romantic partners. Hewas sick of feeling bad and now motivated to get help. With treatment, whichentailed a combination of dietary changes, exercise, nutritional supplements,medication, and targeted mind exercises, he began to heal.Edward had always wanted to be an artist. His teachers told him that he wasgifted from the time he was in grade school. Yet he was never able to followthrough and finish the projects he started. As his treatment began to take hold,he started completing art pieces. He was able to sell several paintings in alocal gallery. Over the next year the demand for his work increased and he wasable to quit working for the trucking company to focus on his art full time.Three years after I first met Edward he sold a painting for more than a hundredthousand dollars. Many people think they cannot afford to get help. Yet livingwith an untreated or ineffectively treated psychiatric illness is much moreexpensive than spending money on the help you need.The shocking statistic is that 49 percent of the U.S. population at some pointin their lives will suffer from a psychiatric disorder. Anxiety disorders,depression, substance abuse, and ADHD are the most common. Twenty-nine percentof the population will have two distinct disorders, and 17 percent, like Edward,will have three. Having one or more of these illnesses can certainly interferewith your ability to be successful at work and in your relationships, and theyrob many people of their ability to feel happy and content. They also rob manypeople of their lives, as suicide claims nearly one million people every yearworldwide.Our brain imaging work has taught me that these problems are frequently theresult of short circuits in the brain that can be repaired or ameliorated. Thesad truth is that most people never avail themselves of appropriate treatmenteither because of ignorance, fear, shame, or guilt. This chapter will explorehow these short circuits interfere with success.I love being a psychiatrist but hate the words psychiatry, psychiatric,psychiatrist, and mental disorder. To the general population these words conjureup notions of crazy, weird, unusual, weak will, character problems, and somehownot being authentic or real. When I first told my father that I wanted to be apsychiatrist, he was clearly disappointed and asked me why I didn’t want to be areal doctor. Yet these problems are real, cause real suffering, have a realbiological basis in brain dysfunction, and occur commonly in people most wouldconsider normal.We Are All Vulnerable, Even MeGiven how common these illnesses are, almost all of us are vulnerable to them atsome point in our lives. I know some of you are thinking, not me, I will nevergo through depression or anxiety, I will never have a problem with drugs oralcohol. I used to be like that too. I treated people who had problems, but Iwas too strong, too together, to suffer like my patients. Wrong! Several yearsago I lost someone important to me. For nearly nine months I suffered fromextreme anxiety, had crushing chest pain, couldn’t sleep, and had terriblethoughts running through my mind. The anxiety affected my work andrelationships. It hurt, more than I could have imagined. Ultimately, that periodin my life made me stronger and I am grateful for it. I learned more emotionalmanagement skills for myself and my patients and met some incredibly wonderful,helpful people, and it significantly increased the empathy I had for people whosuffer.Untreated or ineffectively treated brain problems or psychiatric problems,whatever we call them, limit a person’s ability to be successful. Of course,this is not always true, as many people who suffer from these illnesses arehighly successful. Think of people such as Ernest Hemingway (depression),Vincent van Gogh (psychosis), John Madden (fear of flying), Jane Fonda(bulimia), Brooke Shields (postpartum depression), and Howard Hughes(obsessive-compulsive disorder), to name a few. All of these people suffered.Still, even for these people, their illnesses disrupted their lives and limitedtheir abilities. Getting the proper treatment decreases suffering and increaseseffectiveness.A Completely New Way of Looking at FailureWesley was the leader of a research work group at a large university. He broughtin millions of dollars of grant money each year. Yet his department wasinefficient and had a high turnover rate. Most people who worked with himthought he was a narcissistic jerk, including his boss, with whom he wasconstantly at odds. His boss once asked him if he failed kindergarten, “becausehe never learned to share.” Wesley had temper outbursts and very poor socialskills. Eventually, he was fired for his difficult behavior after he publiclychallenged his boss in front of the university chancellor.J. D. was the CEO of a multimillion-dollar food service organization. Normally areasonable guy, J. D. blew up during a staff meeting at Vince, his trusted vicepresident who had been close to him for several years. Vince was so embarrassedby the tirade that he walked out of the meeting. J. D. had to spend severalhours convincing him not to quit his job. Their relationship was never quite thesame again. J. D. had periodic temper outbursts for little to no reason, butthis was the first one that happened at this job. He had tormented his familywith these outbursts for several years.Cherie was the office manager of a large law practice. Despite being hardworkingand efficient, she was fired for being inflexible and rude to clients and thelaw partners. She had been counseled several times before her termination. Shehad significant trouble with change and believed that the way things had been inthe past is the way they should always be. Her children all left home beforethey turned eighteen. They just needed some space where they could have theirown minds and be themselves.Bill was the general manager of a department store chain. After ten years ofservice he was fired for stealing from the business. His wife had left him threeyears earlier because of infidelity.Danny was a manager of a local grocery store. He was fired after he was caughtby the owner having sex with one of the cashiers in the manager’s office.Sima was a clerk in a large cell phone store. She was smart, warm, and caring.Her customers and co-workers liked her. Yet she would go through extendedperiods where she would be late to work, call in sick, and look sad anddisheveled. Her unpredictable behavior led to her termination, whichsignificantly upset the morale at the store and left them shorthanded.Terry was a pharmacy manager for a local drugstore chain. He worked for a bosswho was angry and inconsistent. He was afraid of his boss. Terry felt so anxiousthat he began to suffer from headaches and gastrointestinal problems and startedto miss work. Terry never felt as though he could confront his manager or goabove his head to the regional manager. After a year of inconsistent workproduction, Terry was fired.Barbara, age sixty-two, was a high school English teacher. The students andfaculty had loved her for many years. In the past four years, however, she wasgrowing more and more forgetful, irritable, and unreliable. She seemedunmotivated, which was a marked change in her personality. After being counseledseveral times, which had no impact on her behavior, she was terminated. Herhusband was beside himself. His wife had become a completely different person.What do all of these people have in common? Brain troubles mislabeled as badbehavior, leading to failure. Wesley and J. D. had a problem in a part of thebrain called the temporal lobe, causing temper outbursts and poor social skills.Cherie was seriously inflexible, caused by too much activity in a part of thebrain called the anterior cingulate gyrus (known as the brain’s gear shifter).Bill and Danny had problems with the prefrontal cortex (called the brain’sexecutive center) and exhibited impulse control problems (stealing and havingsex with employees). Sima suffered from periods of severe depression, likelycaused by too much activity in her deep limbic system. Terry suffered withsevere anxiety and situational stress, where his basal ganglia worked overtime.Barbara had Alzheimer’s disease, causing her temporal lobes to deteriorate at arapid pace. All of these people had skill and all had been previously promoted.Yet because of their brain problems, they exhibited intolerable behavior thatcost them their jobs and stressed their families. Not once did their supervisorsor family members give the brain one thought. Most of these people had treatableproblems that could have saved their businesses and families large sums ofmoney, heartache, and time.To know when your brain is in trouble, it is important to have a basicunderstanding of how your brain works, including its strengths and weaknesses.In the rest of this chapter I will introduce you to six areas of the brain thatare most intimately involved with success and failure. I will show you whatthese areas do and what happens when things go wrong. These brain areas willalso be referred to a number of times throughout the book.Before I describe these systems, take the following brain system quiz to seewhere you stand. I realize that not everyone is able to get a brain scan, so Ihave developed a checklist to help predict areas of strength and weakness. Aword of caution is in order. Self-report checklists have advantages andlimitations. On the one hand, they are quick, inexpensive, and easy to score. Onthe other hand, people filling them out may portray themselves in a way theywant to be perceived, resulting in self-report bias. For example, some peopleexaggerate their experience and mark all of the symptoms as frequent, in essencesaying, “I’m glad to have a real problem so that I can get help, be sick, orhave an excuse for the troubles I have.” Others are in total denial. They do notwant to see any personal flaws and they do not check any symptoms assignificantly problematic, in essence saying, “I’m okay. There’s nothing wrongwith me. Leave me alone.” Not all self-report bias is intentional. People maygenuinely have difficulty recognizing problems and expressing how they feel.Sometimes family members or friends are better at evaluating a loved one’s levelof functioning than a person evaluating himself. They may have noticed thingsthat their loved one hasn’t. Quizzes of any sort should never be used as theonly assessment tool. They are simply catalysts to help you think, ask betterquestions, and get more evaluation if needed.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------AMEN CLINIC BRIEF BRAIN SYSTEM QUESTIONNAIREPlease rate yourself on each of the symptoms listed below using the followingscale.

The front half of the brain integrates this information, analyzes it,decides what to do, then plans and executes the decision. All of these areas areinvolved with your successes and struggles in life. We’ll look specifically atthe functions of six brain systems involved with work, loving, and learning,including the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, deep limbic system,basal ganglia, temporal lobes, and the cerebellum. In addition, there will be abrief discussion about the problems associated with each area along with somestrategies to help them heal.Prefrontal CortexWhenever we discuss humans, the first area of the brain that we have to exploreis the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It is largest in human beings than any otheranimal by far. It is the part of your brain that makes you human. It is 30percent of the human brain, 11 percent of the chimpanzee brain, 7 percent of thedog’s brain, and only 3 percent of the cat’s brain. Cats have no forethought andvery little impulse control. My cat, Annabelle, lives totally in the moment. Shedoesn’t think about the past or worry about the future. She also doesn’t learnfrom mistakes and will drink out of the toilet, no matter how many times she hasbeen told no.The PFC is called the executive brain, because it acts in our head like the bossat work. When it is low in activity, it is as if the boss is gone, so there islittle to no supervision and nothing gets done. When the PFC works too hard, itis as if the boss is micromanaging everyone, and people are left with anxietyand worry. The PFC helps us make decisions and keep us on track toward ourgoals. I also call it the Jiminy Cricket part of the brain. Jiminy Cricket wasPinocchio’s conscience, that still, small voice in his head that helped himdecide between right and wrong. Your PFC helps keep your behavior in check.Comedian Dudley Moore once said, “The best car safety device is a rearviewmirror with a cop in it.” The PFC acts like the cop in your head.Problems with the PFC result in a “Jiminy Cricket deficiency syndrome” with adiminished conscience, poor judgment, impulsivity, short attention span,disorganization, trouble learning from experience, confusion, poor timemanagement, and lack of empathy. Low activity in this part of the brain is oftendue to a deficiency in the neurotransmitter dopamine, and increasing it throughsupplements or medications is often helpful.Joanimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_022_r1.jpg]Image 4.1ADD.

They were performed onthree consecutive days. The first scan shows her untreated brain. In the secondone, auricular acupressure beads were placed on both of her ears, resulting insome improvement. The third scan was done after Joan had been placed onAdderall, a stimulant medication, which dramatically improved her brain. Thesescans demonstrate that you can improve how your brain functions and change yourlife. With a better brain for Joan came a much better life, even though she wasin her sixties when she was first scanned. One of the most exciting things aboutthis scan series is that an innocuous treatment such as acupressure beads made apositive difference. Our imaging work has taught me to have more respect foralternative treatments, and even though they do not always work as robustly asmedications, I have found these treatments can be used successfully in mild tomoderate cases and used as additive treatments to help people use lessmedication.image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_024_r1.jpg]Image 4.3Treatment with AdderallHere is a quick summary of the PFC.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PREFRONTAL CORTEX (PFC) SUMMARY(The Supervising Boss in Your Head)PFC FunctionsLow PFC ProblemsFocusShort attention spanForethoughtLacks clear goals or forward thinkingImpulse controlImpulsivityOrganizationDisorganizationPlanning, goal settingProcrastinationJudgmentPoor judgmentEmpathyLack of empathyEmotional controlFailing to give close attention to detailInsightLack of insightLearning from mistakesTrouble learning from mistakesEasily distractedDiagnostic Problems Associated with Low PFC ActivityADHDSome types of depressionBrain traumaDementia, associated with bad judgmentSchizophreniaAntisocial personalityConduct disordersWays to Balance Low PFCOrganizational help, coachingIntense aerobic exercise (boosts blood flow)Goal setting / planning exercisesHigher protein dietStimulating supplements: L-tyrosine, DL-phenylalanine, L-theanine, orS-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe) help boost dopamine or norepinephrine in the brain(see chapters 6, 7, and 8 for details on natural treatments; try only one at atime and discuss these supplements with your health care professionals too). Stimulating medications (if appropriate): Adderall, Dexedrine, Ritalin,Concerta, Focalin, Wellbutrin, Strattera, or Provigil. We do not give stimulantsto people with schizophrenia. Obviously, any medication recommendations need tobe discussed with your doctor. These are just general suggestions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anterior Cingulate GyrusThe anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) helps you feel settled, relaxed, andflexible. It runs lengthwise through the deep parts of the frontal lobes and isthe brain’s major switching station. I think of it as the brain’s gear shifter;it greases human behavior and allows us to be flexible, adaptable, and to changeas change is needed. This part of the brain is involved in helping shiftattention from idea to idea and seeing the options in your life. The term thatbest relates to the ACG is cognitive flexibility. When there is too muchactivity in the ACG, usually owing to lower serotonin levels, people becomeunable to shift their attention and become rigid, cognitively inflexible,overfocused, anxious, and oppositional. They may also hold grudges and get stuckon past hurts. Along with shifting attention, cooperation is also influenced bythis part of the brain. When the ACG works in an effective manner it is easy toshift into cooperative modes of behavior. When it works too hard, people havedifficulty shifting attention and get stuck in ineffective behavior patterns,where they may be uncooperative or difficult and stuck in their own mind-set.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ANTERIOR CINGULATE GYRUS (ACG) SUMMARY(The Brain’s Gear Shifter)ACG FunctionsExcessive ACG Activity ProblemsCognitive flexibilityPreoccupation with negative thoughts or behaviorsCooperationWorriesMoving from idea to ideaGrudge holdingSeeing optionsObsessions/compulsionsGoing with the flowInflexiblity, may appear selfishSeeing errorsTendency to be oppositional/argumentativeTendency to become upset when things do not go your wayTendency to become upset when things are out of placeIntense dislike for changeTendency to say no without thinkingSeeing too many errorsDiagnostic Problems Associated with Excessive ACG ActivityObsessive-compulsive disorderEating disordersPremenstrual tension syndrome, some typesChronic pain (stuck on pain)Post-traumatic stress disorderOppositional defiant disorderDifficult temperamentsTourette’s syndrome(need to have one’s own way)Ways to Calm Excessive ACG ActivityIntense aerobic exerciseDistractionRelationship counseling, anger managementLower protein / complex carbs dietACG supplements: 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), St. John’s wort, or inositol helpboost serotonin to the brain (see chapters 6, 7, and 8 for details on naturaltreatments; try only one at a time and discuss these with your health careprofessionals too) ACG medications (if appropriate): selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs) (Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Prozac, Luvox), Effexor, atypical antipsychoticsin refractory cases (Risperdal, Zyprexa, or Geodon)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Deep Limbic SystemThe deep limbic system (DLS) lies near the center of the brain. About the sizeof a walnut, this part of the brain is involved in setting a person’s emotionaltone. When the DLS is less active, there is generally a positive, more hopefulstate of mind. When it is heated up, or overactive, negativity can take over.Because of this emotional shading, the DLS provides the filter through which youinterpret the events of the day; it tags or colors events, depending on theemotional state of mind. The DLS also affects motivation and drive. It helps getyou going in the morning and encourages you to move throughout the day.Overactivity in this area is associated with lowered motivation and drive, whichis often seen in depression. The DLS is intimately involved with bonding andsocial connectedness. This capacity to bond plays a significant role in the toneand quality of our moods. The DLS also directly processes the sense of smell.Because your sense of smell goes directly to the deep limbic system, it is easyto see why smells can have such a powerful impact on our feeling states.The problems in the DLS are associated with depression and negativity along withlow motivation, libido, and energy. Because sufferers feel hopeless about theoutcome, they have little willpower to follow through with tasks. High activityin the DLS may be due to deficiencies in the neurotransmitters norepinephrine,dopamine, or serotonin, and increasing these chemicals through supplements ormedications may be helpful. Here is a quick summary of the DLS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DEEP LIMBIC SYSTEM (DLS) SUMMARY(The Mood and Bonding Center)DLS Functions ExcessiveDLS Activity ProblemsMood controlDepression, sadnessCharged memoriesFocused on the negative, irritabilityModulates motivationLow motivation and energySets emotional toneNegativity, blame, guiltBondingSocial disconnections/isolationSense of smellLow self-esteemLibidoLow libidoDecreased interest in things that are usually funFeelings of worthlessness or helplessnessFeeling dissatisfied or boredDiagnostic Problems Associated with Excessive DLS ActivityDepressionCyclic mood disordersPain syndromesWays to Balance High DLS ActivityIntense aerobic exerciseCognitive-behavioral strategies to deal with automatic negative thoughtsBalanced diet, such as the one described by Barry Sears in The Zone Diet DLS supplements: DL-phenylalanine, SAMe, or L-tyrosine (see chapters 6, 7, and 8for details on natural treatments; try only one at a time and discuss these withyour health care professionals too) DLS medications (if appropriate): antidepressants (Wellbutrin, Effexor, orCymbalta), SSRIs (if high ACG also present), anticonvulsants or lithium forcyclic mood changes--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Basal GangliaThe basal ganglia (BG) are the large structures toward the center of the brainthat surround the deep limbic system. The BG are involved with integratingfeelings, thoughts, and movement, which is why you jump when you get excited orfreeze when you are scared. The BG help to shift and smooth motor behavior. Whenactivity in this area is low, as in Parkinson’s disease, people can developtremors and problems with movement (writing, walking, jumping, etc.). In ourclinic we have noticed that the BG are involved with setting the body’s idle oranxiety level. When the BG work too hard, people tend to struggle with anxietyand physical stress symptoms, such as headaches, intestinal problems, and muscletension. High BG activity is also associated with conflict avoidant behavior.Anything that reminds them of a worry (such as confronting an employee who isnot doing a good job) produces anxiety, and high BG people tend to avoid it,because it makes them feel uncomfortable. People with high BG activity also havetrouble relaxing and tend to overwork. When the BG are low in activity, peopletend to have problems with motivation, attention, and moving their livesforward. In addition, the BG are involved with feelings of pleasure and ecstasy.Cocaine works in this part of the brain. High activity in this part of the brainis often due to a deficiency in the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric, orGABA, and increasing it through supplements or medications is often helpful.Here is a quick summary of the BG.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------BASAL GANGLIA (BG) SUMMARY(The Anxiety Center)BG FunctionsExcessive BG Activity ProblemsIntegration of feelings, thoughts, and movementHigh anxiety levelsRegulator of the body’s idlePanicSmooth movementHypervigilanceMotivation modulatorMuscle tensionPleasure mediatorConflict avoidancePredicting the worstExcessive fear of being judged by othersTendency to freeze in anxiety situationsShy or timid appearanceBites fingernails or picks skinExcessive motivation, inability to stop workingDiagnostic Problems Associated with Excessive BG ActivityAnxiety disordersWorkaholismPhysical stress symptomsInsecurity(headaches, stomachaches)Ways to Calm High BG ActivityCognitive therapy to quell the bad thoughtsHypnosis, meditationRelaxation trainingRelaxing musicAssertiveness trainingLimiting caffeine and alcohol intakeBG supplements: GABA, kava kava, or valerian root (see chapters 6, 7, and 8 fordetails on natural treatments; try only one at a time and discuss these withyour health care professionals too) BG medications (if appropriate): antianxiety medications such as benzodiazepines(low dose, short time), Buspar, anticonvulsants, blood pressure medications suchas propranolol--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Temporal LobesThe temporal lobes (TLs), underneath your temples and behind your eyes, areinvolved with language (hearing and reading), reading social cues, short-termmemory, getting memories into long-term storage, processing music and tone ofvoice, and mood stability. They also help with recognizing objects by sight andnaming them. It is called the “what pathway” in the brain, as it is involvedwith recognition and naming objects and faces. In addition, the TLs, especiallyon the right side, have been implicated in spiritual experience and insight.Experiments that stimulate the right temporal lobe have demonstrated increasedreligious or spiritual experiences, such as feeling God’s presence.Trouble in the TLs leads to both short-and long-term memory problems, readingdifficulties, trouble finding the right words in conversation, trouble readingsocial cues, mood instability, and sometimes religious or moral preoccupation orperhaps a lack of spiritual sensitivity. The TLs, especially on the left side,have been associated with temper problems. Abnormal (high or low) activity inthis part of the brain is often due to a deficiency in the neurotransmitterGABA, and balancing it through supplements or medications is often helpful.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------TEMPORAL LOBES (TLS) SUMMARY(Memory and Mood Stability)TL FunctionsTL ProblemsUnderstanding and use of languageLanguage problems, dyslexiaMemoryMemory problemsRetrieval of wordsTrouble finding the right wordReadingMood instabilityRecognize words and objectsAnxiety for little or no reasonEmotional stabilityHeadaches or abdominal pain, hard to diagnoseReading faces and social cuesTrouble reading facial expressions or social cuesRhythmDark, evil, awful, or hopeless thoughtsTemper controlAggression, toward self or othersSpiritual experienceLearning problemsIllusions (shadows, visual or auditory distortions)An overfocusing on religious ideasDiagnostic Problems Associated with Abnormal TL ActivityHead injuryDissociationAnxietyTemporal epilepsyAmnesiaSerious depression with dark or suicidal thoughtsReligiosityDyslexiaWays to Balanced the TLsAnger managementIncreased protein dietTL supplements: GABA or valerian to calm TLs if needed; for memory, considergingko biloba, huperzine, or phosphatidylserine (see chapters 6, 7, and 8 fordetails on natural treatments; try only one at a time and discuss these withyour health care professionals too).TL medications (if appropriate): antiseizure medications for mood instabilityand temper problems (Depakote, Neurontin, Tegretol, or Lamictal),memory-enhancing medications for more serious memory problems (Namenda, Aricept,Exelon, or Reminyl)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CerebellumThe cerebellum, at the back bottom part of the brain, is called the littlebrain. Even though it represents only 10 percent of the brain’s volume, ithouses 50 percent of the brain’s neurons. It has long been known that thecerebellum is involved with motor coordination, posture, and how we walk. Onlyrecently has it become clear that the cerebellum is also involved withprocessing speed, like clock speed on a computer, which may be the reason it hasso many neurons. It is also involved in thought coordination or how quickly youcan make cognitive and emotional adjustments. The cerebellum helps you quicklymake physical adjustments, such as while you are playing a sport, as well ashelping you make emotional adjustments in stressful or novel situations. Whenthere are problems in the cerebellum, people tend to struggle not only withphysical coordination, but they also tend to get easily confused. Our researchhas found that low cerebellar activity is also associated with poor handwriting(coordination); problems maintaining an organized work area; being sensitive tolight, noise, touch, or clothing (such as tags); and being clumsy or accidentprone. The cerebellum has been found low in activity in autism, ADD, andlearning disabilities.Given that the cerebellum is the major coordination center in the brain,coordination exercises, such as sports and music, are some of the majorstrategies to keep the brain tuned to work at its best. At this point there isun-certainty about the neurotransmitter deficiency in this part of the brain, sowe do not know what supplements or medications may be helpful.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------CEREBELLUM (CB) SUMMARY(Coordination and Processing Speed)CB FunctionsLow CB Activity ProblemsMotor controlCoordination problemPosture, gaitSlowed thinkingExecutive function, connects to PFCSlowed speechSpeed of cognitive integrationPoor handwritingTrouble learning routinesDisorganizationSensitivity to noise or touchTendency to be clumsy or accident proneLight sensitivityDiagnostic Problems Associated with Poor CB ActivityTraumaAlcohol abuseAutism, Asperger’s syndromeSome forms of ADHDCoordination problemsSensory integration problemsWays to Balance Low CB ActivityPrevention of brain injuryCessation of alcohol use and avoidance of other toxic exposureJugglingCoordination exercises, such as dancing or table tennisCB supplements and medications: unknown at this time--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Knowing the part of your brain that needs help is a shortcut to optimizing thebrain in the fastest, most efficient way possible. You will notice under eachbrain section that there are a number of interventions to help people heal.There are myriad ways to optimize the brain, including dietary interventions,physical and mental exercises, targeted behavioral exercises, supplements, andmedications. One treatment doesn’t fit everyone. My hope in providing theseoptions is for you to start a conversation with your health care professionalsso that you can better tailor or target the treatment to the brain systems thatneed help."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_025_r1.jpg]If You Were My Family, How Would I Treat You?image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]THE FOUR CIRCLES OF HEALTH AND HEALING AND WHY YOU SHOULD CONSIDER NATURALTREATMENTSOne question I always ask myself when treating patients is, what would Iprescribe if this were my mother, my wife, or my children? How would I treatthem? More and more I find myself recommending natural or alternative treatmentsfor my patients because this is exactly what I would do for myself or the peopleI love. I am not opposed to medication, but I want people to use all of thetools that are available to them, especially the ones that are less expensiveand have fewer side effects. Although I am not opposed to medication whenneeded, unlike so many of my colleagues, I see them as options of later resort,not first resort. My bent since medical school has been to use naturaltreatments and to teach patients skills, not just give them pills.When I first started brain imaging work in 1991, I thought my tendency towardnatural solutions might change in favor of medications, as most of the problemswe treated were clearly considered biological; we could see the brainabnormalities on scans. What I didn’t know at the time, but have been excited tolearn since, is that many natural treatments, even certain types ofpsychotherapy, meditation, and nutritional supplements, can improve brainfunction.In this chapter I will update you on the latest thinking on treating commonmental health issues using natural treatments. I will also tell you when I woulduse them and when medications may be necessary. I will explain the approach weuse at the Amen Clinics in diagnosing and treating the common problems that cometo our clinics, including ADD, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, memoryproblems, insomnia, and brain injuries. In addition I will give a summary boxfor each natural treatment, stating the current scientific evidence for its use.Before I turn to natural treatments, I want to share an important way to thinkabout diagnosis and treatment of brain-related problems. At the Amen Clinics weuse a biological-psychological-social-spiritual model in evaluating and treatingthe brain. I call these the four circles of optimal health (see Figure 5.1).image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_026_r1.jpg]Figure 5.1: The Four Circles of Optimal HealthThe Biological CircleThe first circle of health, illness, and healing is the biological or physicalaspects of the brain, how it functions moment by moment. For the brain tooperate at peak efficiency, its machinery (cells, connections, chemicals,energy, and blood flow) needs to physically work right. As mentioned earlier,the brain is like a supercomputer, having both hardware and software. Think ofthe term biology akin to the hardware of a computer. Contained within thebiological circle are such factors as genetics, overall physical health,nutrition, exercise, and environmental issues (e.g., physical stress, toxins,and sleep). When the brain is healthy, all of these factors work together in apositive way to maximize our success. Illness strikes the brain when potentiallyany of these factors become disrupted or out of sync. When we do not get enoughsleep, there is overall lower blood flow to the brain, which disrupts thinking,memory, and concentration. When there is an injury it hurts the machinery of thebrain and we may struggle with depression, memory, and temper problems. When weeat a high-sugar meal, our blood sugar often rebounds low and we feel stupid andsluggish.As an example, here are some of the biological factors associated withdepression. It’s first important to look at the family history. We know there isoften a genetic link to depression and it tends to run in families, especiallywhere there is alcohol abuse. It’s also important to evaluate patients from amedical point of view, as there are a number of illnesses that can causedepression. These include thyroid disease, infectious illnesses, cancer, andcertain forms of anemia. A heart attack or stroke also leave a person vulnerableto depression. Periods of dramatic hormonal shifts (postpartum or menopausal)often precipitate problems with depression. Additionally, certain medicationscan cause depression. Most notable among these are birth control pills, certainblood pressure or cardiac medications, steroids, and chronic pain controlmedicines. In evaluating depression, it’s essential to take a good alcohol anddrug abuse history. Chronic alcohol or marijuana use often causes depression,while amphetamine or cocaine withdrawal is often accompanied by serious suicidalthoughts.Healing occurs by bringing these biological factors back into balance, bygetting good sleep, protecting ourselves from brain injuries, treating anymedical illnesses, avoiding toxins such as drugs, eating a healthy, balanceddiet, getting plenty of exercise, taking a fish oil tablet and a multiplevitamin, and taking targeted supplements or even medication if needed.The Psychological CirclePsychological factors fall into the second circle of health, illness, andrecovery. This circle includes how we think and how we talk to ourselves, therunning dialogue that goes on in our minds, plus our self-concept, overallupbringing, and significant developmental events. Being raised in a reasonablyhappy home, getting positive messages growing up and liking ourselves, ourbodies, height, and abilities all contribute to psychological health. When anyof these areas struggle we are more likely to have mental problems. If, in ourminds, we perceive ourselves as short, ugly, or less able than our peers, thentrouble starts to brew. If our thinking patterns are excessively negative,harsh, or critical, they will have a negative impact on our moods and anxietylevels.Going back to our example of depression, psychological factors that contributeto it include major losses, such as the death of a loved one, breakup of aromantic relationship and loss of a job, self-esteem, status, health, orpurpose; multiple childhood traumas, such as physical or sexual abuse; negativethinking that erodes self-esteem and drives down the mood; and learnedhelplessness, the belief that no matter what you do things won’t change. Thiscomes from being exposed to environments where you are continually frustratedfrom reaching your needs or goals.Healing our thoughts and hurts from the past are essential to wellness andoptimal mental health.The Social CircleThe social circle of health, illness, and recovery emphasizes the current eventsin our lives. When we are in good relationships, experience good health, have ajob we love and enough money, our brain tends to do much better than when any ofthese areas are stressed. Stress negatively impacts brain function and dealingwith difficult events makes us more vulnerable to illness. Depression is oftentriggered by current stressful life events, such as marital problems, familydysfunction, financial difficulties, health problems, or work-related struggles.Optimizing your present life, including relationships, work, financialsituation, and health, improves brain health. Decreasing the daily stresses inyour life also improves brain function, so having daily stress managementtechniques are important to overall brain health.The Spiritual CircleMany people have a spiritual side, where life takes on deeper meaning than justthe everyday tasks of living. Having a deep sense of purpose, a connection to ahigher power, and a connection to past generations and the future of our planetallow us to reach beyond ourselves to say our lives mattered. Many people gothrough spiritual crises, not knowing why their life has meaning, which setsthem up for depression or substance abuse. Morality, connection, values, and aspiritual connection to others and the universe is critical for many people tofeel a sense of wholeness and connection.BIOLOGICAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL-SOCIAL-SPIRITUAL SUMMARYBiological—Genetic tendencies, nutrition, exercise, neurotransmitter health,blood flow and oxygenation, sleep, overall physical healthPsychological—Thinking patterns, self-concept, upbringing, and developmentSocial—Current life opportunities and stresses, which includes relationships,finances, and workSpiritual—Deeper life meaning, which includes a sense of purpose and connectionwith a higher power and the past and futureCAUSES OF MENTAL ILLNESSESBiological—Genetic vulnerabilities, dietary deficiencies, poor exercise,neurotransmitter deficiencies, trauma, infection, toxicity, oxygen deprivation,lack of sleep, allergies, dehydration, physical illnesses (e.g., thyroiddisease, diabetes, or heart disease)Psychological—Negative thinking patterns, poor self-concept, stressfulupbringing and developmentSocial—Current life stresses, which includes relationships, finances, work, andlegal issuesSpiritual—Lack of personal meaning or purpose, a feeling of hopelessness,helplessness, or worthlessnessTREATING MENTAL ILLNESSES AND OPTIMIZING OUR LIVESBiological—Healthy diet, adequate exercise and sleep, avoiding toxic substances,replenishing neurotransmitters, healthy supplements, medications whenappropriate, novel treatments (e.g., acupuncture, hyperbaric oxygen treatment),protecting the brain from injuryPsychological—Optimizing a person’s psychology through correcting negativethinking patterns, healing past traumatic wounds, and improving self-conceptSocial—Strengthening a person’s ability to deal with stress (stress managementtechniques) and enhancing social relationshipsSpiritual—Discovering a deeper sense of purpose and connectionWhy Consider Natural Treatments?What are the pros and cons of using natural treatments to maintain health andprevent and treat illness? There are significant advantages of naturaltreatments, as well as a few downsides or controversies you need to know about.The most significant benefit to using natural treatments is that thesestrategies are geared toward preventing illness rather than just treating it.Preventing problems is dramatically more cost effective than treating problemsthat have occurred. Engaging in natural strategies helps build an attitude ofprevention and hopefully leads to a healthier lifestyle overall. Waiting untilyou have an illness, such as a stroke or Alzheimer’s disease, is always moreexpensive than spending time, effort, and money to prevent it. In addition tousing natural methods for prevention, they are often very effective for mild tomoderate problems and have fewer side effects than most pharmaceuticals.Compliance tends to be higher for these products, which means that people aremore likely to take them over the long run. Generally, natural strategies areless expensive than pharmaceutical alternatives. In addition, you never have totell an insurance company that you have taken them. As awful as it is, takingprescription medication for brain problems, or even to enhance brain health, canaffect a person’s insurability. This is true for medications that treat anxiety,depression, bipolar disorder, ADD, and many other problems. I know manypatients, colleagues, and friends who have been denied medical or life insurancebecause of the medications they were taking. If there are natural alternatives,it is worth considering.The natural supplement picture is not all rosy, and some of the disadvantageshave to be considered. Even though natural supplements are generally lessexpensive than medications, you may pay more out of pocket because they are notcovered by insurance. In addition, many people are unaware that naturalsupplements can have side effects. Just because it is natural does not mean itis innocuous. For example, St. John’s wort, one of my favorite naturalantidepressants, which works like a mild form of Prozac in the brain, can causesun sensitivity and can deactivate the effectiveness of other medications suchas birth control pills or antiviral drugs.One of the major issues of concern regarding natural products is the lack ofstandardization and quality control. Rigid quality control is not required forthese products and there are many variables in the manufacturing process.Variables associated with plant-based supplements, for example, include age,ripeness when harvested, growing environment, and storage conditions. Thetherapeutic and toxic components of the supplement may vary considerably. Therealso may be issues with contamination. Different components of each herb canexhibit different pharmacologic effects. It is critical to get brands you trustthat have been tested and shown to be reliable. Another disadvantage is thatpeople get a lot of their advice about supplements from the clerk at the grocerystore, who may not have accurate information. I often send patients towww.consumerlab.com [http://www.consumerlab.com], which is an independentlaboratory that posts tests of quality control on the Web.Even when looking at the cons of natural supplements, in my mind, they are worthserious consideration. We can be targeted and thoughtful in our recommendations,and we can find dedicated companies that produce high-quality products. Itamazes me how many physicians have a knee-jerk negative reaction to naturalsupplements despite the large amounts of research on them. I teach the course onsupplements to the psychiatric residents at the University of California–Irvine.I have noticed that many of the residents start with a negative attitude aboutthem. Invariably one of the residents will say there is not enough research onthem and that they do not really contain the ingredients on the labels. At theend of the course, when they learn about the extensive research and good-qualitycompanies, many of the young psychiatrists are excited about the possibility ofusing supplements to help their patients and many even start to take the ones Idiscuss below. I have enough personal experience prescribing pharmaceuticalswith side effects that I believe patients deserve to know about naturalalternatives. Let me give you an example of how effective natural treatments canbe.The president of a local college came to see me with her teenage daughter,Jennifer, who was depressed, angry, and did poorly in school. Her pediatricianhad tried her on Prozac but she experienced bad side effects. The mother heardthat I used natural treatments. After scanning Jennifer and seeing that thefront part of her brain worked too hard, I put her on St. John’s wort, an herbalantidepressant that settles down brain function, along with fish oil and aspecially formulated multiple vitamin. Within three weeks Jennifer’s behaviordramatically improved, as did her schoolwork. When I did a follow-up scan, thehyperactivity in the front part of her brain had also calmed down.Natural treatments can change the brain. But whether we are using naturaltreatments or medication to help balance the brain, it is critical for us toknow the individual pattern of each person. As we will see, not everyone with amood disorder or ADD will have the same brain. I have described seven differenttypes of anxiety and depression and six different types of ADD. There are alsodifferent types of autism and memory problems. One size does not fit everyone.Each person is different and needs an individualized plan based on their ownunique brain. I will discuss this in length in the coming chapters.NATURAL TREATMENTS: ADVANTAGES1. Often effective for mild to moderate problems.2. Less expensive than most medications.3. Usually significantly fewer side effects (although not no side effects)4. Geared to both prevent and treat illness5. Never have to tell an insurance company you are taking them; psychiatricmedications can decrease insurability6. Compliance generally higher as they usually have fewer side effects7. Many backed by solid research suggesting their effectivenessNATURAL TREATMENTS: DISADVANTAGES1. Possible side effects (as with all medications)2. Not covered by insurance, may entail high out-of-pocket expenses3. Usually fewer studies because drug companies cannot obtain patents on naturaltreatments so they are less lucrative4. Less standardization and quality control than is performed on pharmaceuticals5. Consultant may be the seventeen-year-old clerk at the grocery storeNatural Strategies That Apply to Us AllTo keep your brain balanced, there are certain natural treatments that apply tous all. These include a healthy diet, exercising, killing the negative thoughtsthat steal our happiness, goal setting, stress management techniques (e.g.,meditating), and taking a multiple vitamin and fish oil supplement daily. Iaddress most of these issues in other chapters of the book, except for multiplevitamins and fish oil.Multiple VitaminsBecause of our poor diets, I recommend that all of my patients take ahigh-quality 100 percent multiple vitamin every day. Over the last twenty years,our understanding of the benefits of vitamins has rapidly advanced, and it nowappears that people who get enough vitamins may be able to help prevent suchcommon chronic illnesses as cancer, heart disease, dementia, and osteoporosis,according to Drs. Robert Fletcher and Kathleen Fairfield of Harvard University,who wrote the guidelines for vitamins published in the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association (JAMA) in 2002. The last time JAMA made a comprehensivereview of vitamins, about twenty years before, it concluded that people ofnormal health shouldn’t take multivitamins because they were a waste of time andmoney. People can get all the nutrients they need from their diet, JAMA advised,adding that only pregnant women and chronically sick people may need certainvitamins. That was at a time when knowledge about vitamins was just beginning toexpand. The role that low levels of folate, or folic acid, play in neural tubedefects, for instance, was not known, nor was its role as a major risk factorfor heart disease. Ninety-one percent of Americans do not eat at least fivehelpings of fruits and vegetables a day, the recommended minimum amount believedto provide sufficient essential nutrients. Humans do not make their ownvitamins, except for some vitamin D, so they must get them from an outsidesource to prevent problems.Omega-3 Fatty Acid SupplementsFish oils, also known as marine oils, are fats found in fish, particularlycold-water fish, and other marine life, including phytoplankton and krill. Theseoils are rich sources of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, also calledomega-3 fatty acids. The two most studied fish oils are eicosapentaenoic acid(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is a vital component of cellmembranes, especially those in the brain and retina. Supplemental fish oils havebeen shown to have many positive effects on the body. They lower triglyceridelevels and have anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic, immune-enhancing, andnerve-cell-stabilizing properties. In addition, they also help maintain normalblood flow as they lower the body’s ability to form clots. DHA is vital fornormal brain development for the fetus and infant and for the maintenance ofnormal brain function throughout life. DHA appears to be a major factor in howfluid or flexible brain cell membranes are. This could play a major role in themaintenance of how we think and feel. Fish oils appear to have mood-stabilizingproperties when used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. On SPECT scans,bipolar disorder shows overall increased activity in the brain, and EPA and DHAtend to calm or dampen these overactive brain signals.A four-month double-blind, placebo-controlled study of thirty subjects withbipolar disorder compared the effects of fish oil supplements with placebo.Fourteen subjects received 9.6 grams daily of fish oil consisting of 6.2 gramsof EPA and 3.4 grams of DHA, and sixteen subjects received olive oil as aplacebo. This study showed improvement in the short-term course of the disorderwith fish oil supplementation. Among those taking fish oils, longer periods ofremission were observed in nearly every outcome category, and the results werestatistically significant. Mild gastrointestinal side effects were reported inthe fish oil group.In a landmark study published in the journal Lancet, researchers examined theeffect of dietary fish oil and vitamin E supplementation on death and disease inover eleven thousand subjects who had suffered a heart attack within threemonths of entering the trial. The trial lasted for forty-two months. The mostsignificant result of this trial was the reduction in risk for overall andsudden cardiac death, which it is believed was due to the antiarrhythmic effectof the fish oil. The study suggests that up to twenty lives per one thousandpost–heart attack patients could be saved by consuming daily doses of less than1 gram of EPA and DHA.An analysis of seventeen studies with fish oil indicates that supplementationwith 3 or more grams of fish oil daily can lead to clinically relevant bloodpressure reductions in individuals with untreated hypertension, although it didnot lower blood pressure in those who were normal. An analysis of another groupof studies on the effect of fish oils following coronary angioplasty indicatesthat subjects who had undergone successful angioplasty had a significantly lowerrate (13.9 percent) of recurrent problems when given 4–5 grams daily of mixturesof EPA and DHA for three months to one year following the angioplasty. What’sgood for your heart is also good for your brain.There are many other physical benefits of fish oil supplements. Daily use offish oil of at least 3 grams of EPA and DHA mixtures for a period of twelveweeks or longer has been found to reduce the number of tender joints and amountof morning stiffness in people with rheumatoid arthritis, to the extent thatthey were reported to have lowered or discontinued use of nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs or other antirheumatic drugs. The supplements appearedto be well tolerated in these individuals, and no serious side effects werereported.Because of the possible anticlotting effect of fish oil supplements,hemophiliacs and those taking warfarin (Coumadin) should exercise caution intheir use. Fish oil supplements should be stopped before any surgical procedure.Diabetics who take fish oil supplements should be monitored by their physicians.There have been no reports of serious adverse events in those taking fish oilsupplements, even up to 15 grams daily for prolonged periods of time. The sideeffects that have been reported include mild gastrointestinal upsets such asnausea and diarrhea; halitosis; burping; and fishy-smelling breath, skin, andeven urine. The blood-thinning effects can cause occasional nosebleeds and easybruising.The typical dosage of fish oil is 1–3 grams a day for prevention and 4–6 grams aday to treat illness. High-quality fish oil can be taken by pregnant women andhas been shown to help the moods of those women prone to bipolar disorder."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_027_r1.jpg]Natural Ways to Healimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDERADD and ADHD are essentially the same thing. Because at least half the peoplewho have this disorder are not hyperactive, I prefer the term ADD.I often tell people that I know more about ADD than I want to know. My son,Antony, was diagnosed with ADD when he was twelve years old. His room used tofollow the second law of physics, meaning that things went from order todisorder. I used to ask him if he planned to have his room that messy. Moreover,his handwriting was a mess, and a half an hour of homework used to take himthree hours to do with his mother’s yelling at him to sit down and get it done.On the surface, Breanne, my oldest daughter, was the perfect child. She wasalways easy, always sweet, her room was always clean, and her homework alwaysdone. If I only had Breanne, I would have been a terrible child psychiatrist. Iwould have thought Breanne was so wonderful because I was such a good dad. If Isaw your child acting up in the grocery store, I would have thought to myself,“Give me your child for a week and I will straighten him out and then teach youhow to be a good parent.” Well, God knew I was like that, so God gave meKaitlyn.Hyperactive from before birth. We thought Kaitlyn was going to be a boy, becausethe lore is that the more active babies are inside their mother’s womb, the morelikely they are to be boys. Well, she wasn’t. Trying to hold Kaitlyn when shewas a year old was like trying to hold a live salmon.I had a spiritual crisis because of this child. Many Catholic churches allowyoung children to sit with their parents at mass. It was no fun with Kaitlyn,because she was the worst behaved child at church, which was not onlyembarrassing, but it was bad for business. I treated half the children in thecongregation and if my child was the worst one, people would lose confidence inme. So after a while I stopped going to church.Have you ever seen children on little yellow leashes in the mall? After havingKaitlyn, I became a firm believer in little yellow leashes because she wasalways trying to get away. But my problem was that I wrote a column in the localnewspaper where I lived, and whenever I went to the mall people recognized meand said things like “Hey, you are Dr. Amen, I loved your column.” I just couldnot deal with “Hey, you’re Dr. Amen, why is your child on a leash?” So what Iused to do with Kaitlyn was put her in her stroller and tie her shoelacestogether so she couldn’t get out. Now, I am not proud of that, but when you havea hyperactive child you do things just to survive.When Katie was three years old, I went back to church but left her at home. Iwent to pray for a healing. I believe in healings. At the time I knew that 30percent of three-year-olds look hyperactive, but only 5–10 percent offour-year-olds are hyperactive. So the first time you can really diagnose ADDwith confidence is when the patient is four years old. I lit candles at churchand even put an extra fifty dollars in the offering, trying to bribe God. Iwrote to the pope and asked him to send a blessed picture that I could put byher bed. But he must have had an ADD secretary because no one wrote me back. Atthe age of four, I brought Kaitlyn to a colleague who diagnosed her with ADD.The hallmark symptoms of ADD are short attention span, distractibility,disorganization, procrastination, and poor internal supervision. Some people arehyperactive like Kaitlyn, but many are not.Short attention span is the key symptom of ADD, but it is not short attentionspan for everything. People with ADD have trouble with regular, routine everydayattention—the kind of attention that makes life work, such as getting yourhomework done, paying bills on time, doing your expense report at work, orlistening to your spouse. For activities and events that are new, novel, highlystimulating, interesting, or frightening, people with ADD can pay attention justfine. It is as though they need stimulation in order to pay attention, which iswhy they ride motorcycles, go to scary movies, engage in high-risk activities,and tend to be conflict seeking in their relationships. Many people with ADDplay this game I call “let’s have a problem.” If they are upset, they can focusand may even overfocus on the problem. This trait often fools people, evendoctors, because if you can pay attention to things you love, but not mostthings, then people do not think you have ADD; they just think you are lazy.Distractibility is another common symptom. Most of us can block out things we donot need to think about, but this is not the case for people with ADD. Ifsomeone drops a pencil three rows over, their attention immediately goes to thepencil. People with ADD also tend to feel everything. They hate tags and theirclothes have to be just right or they get upset. They are often sensitive totouch and may need white noise at night to sleep; otherwise they hear everythingin the house. Distractibility often affects a woman’s ability to have an orgasm.What does an orgasm require? Attention! You have to pay attention to the feelinglong enough to make it happen. After properly treating ADD, many people’s sexlives get much better.Many people with ADD are disorganized. Their rooms, desks, and book-bags areoften a mess and they tend to be late. You can tell the ADD people at workbecause they are always ten minutes late and usually show up with a big cup ofcoffee in their hands. Many people with ADD self-medicate with stimulants, suchas caffeine and nicotine.Many people with ADD also have what I call poor internal supervision. They don’tthink before they say things and they don’t think before they do things, whichgets them into lots of hot water. Many people with ADD have trouble withlong-term goals. The moment is what matters to them, not five moments from nowor ten moments from now, but now. They wait till the last minute to get thingsdone and have trouble saving for retirement. They also take what I call a crisismanagement approach to life. It seems as though their life goes from one crisisto the next.For many people with ADD, the harder they try the worse it gets. On brain SPECTstudies we see that the brain is usually normal at rest, but when the patienttries to concentrate there is decreased activity in the front part of the brain(see Images 6.1 and 6.2). Stimulant medications seem to help because theyprevent this shutdown from occurring so people can concentrate. This is likeputting your foot on the gas pedal and the car goes slower.There are many myths and misconceptions about ADD. Here are just a few.The first myth is that ADD is a fad or something new. Yet it has been describedin the medical literature for well over a hundred years. It is true not as manypeople were diagnosed with ADD fifty years ago, but they existed and they werepunished more in school or just labeled as bad or lazy kids.The second myth is that everyone outgrows ADD by the time they hit puberty.About half the people who have it as children will have symptoms as adults, evenolder adults. I have treated many three-or four-generation families with ADD. Inone of my favorite families I treated the six-year-old son, the mother, thegrandfather, and the ninety-four-year-old great-grandmother. When thegreat-grandmother came in my office, I asked her why she was there. She said, “Iwant to finish the newspaper. I have never been able to finish the paper.” Ontreatment a month later she came back into my office with a big smile and toldme she had read her first book.ADD Scansimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_028_r1.jpg]Image 6.1ADD at restimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_029_r1.jpg]Image 6.2ADD with concentration (note the deactivation)The third myth is that ADD is only a minor problem. Yet 35 percent of thesechildren left untreated never finish high school. According to one study 52percent of untreated ADD teens and adults will abuse drugs or alcohol. Andaccording to another study 43 percent of untreated aggressive hyperactive boyswill be arrested for a felony by the time they are sixteen. Seventy-five percentof people with untreated ADD have interpersonal problems. Why? In my lectures Ioften ask the audience, “How many of you are married?” Most of the audienceraise their hands. I continue, “Is it helpful for you to say everything youthink in your marriage?” The audience laughs. “Of course not,” I continue.“Relationships require tact. They require forethought. But when you have lowactivity in the front part of your brain, as most people with ADD do, you oftensay the first thing that comes into your mind, which hurts other people’sfeelings.”I often say the brain is a sneaky organ. We all have weird, crazy, stupidthoughts that no one should ever hear. It is the front part of our brain thatprotects us from saying those stupid thoughts out loud. It acts as the brain’sbrake. I was once at a conference with one of my friends who has ADD and a braininjury. Two obese women were sitting in front of us talking about their weightproblems. One woman said to the other, “I don’t know why I am so fat. I eat likea bird.” My friend looked at me and said loud enough for everyone around us tohear, “Yeah, like a condor.” I looked at my friend in total embarrassment.Horrified, my friend put her hand over her mouth and said, “Oh my God, did thatthought get out?” I nodded yes as the women moved away from us in disgust.The last myth is that ADD is a disorder mostly of males. Some studies indicatethat girls have ADD nearly as much as boys, but they are not diagnosed because,unlike Kaitlyn, most of them are not hyperactive. They frequently suffer withADD symptoms and never get anywhere near their potential. They are passed off aslazy or not that smart.Even though Breanne, my oldest daughter, was the perfect child, the truth is Inever thought she was very smart. It embarrasses me to say that, but that washow I felt. I had to teach her simple things over and over and she did not learnher times tables until she was in fifth grade. I had her tested by a colleaguein the third grade who basically told me the same thing, that she wasn’t thatsmart. She didn’t say it that way, but I could read between the lines. But thepsychologist said Breanne would be okay because she worked so hard. In fact, ineighth grade Breanne won a presidential scholar award, not for academics but foreffort. In tenth grade, however, things started to fall apart. She was in acollege prep school and stayed up every night until one or two o’clock in themorning to get her homework done. Then one night, while studying biology, shecame to me in tears and said she thought she could never be as smart as herfriends. It broke my heart. The next day I pulled up her original scan, takenwhen she was eight years old. When I first started to do scans in 1991, Iscanned everyone I knew. I had scanned my three kids, my mother, even myself. Atthe time I only had the experience of someone who had seen fifty scans. Now,seven years later, I had seen thousands of scans. With experienced eyes I washorrified with what I saw. Breanne had low overall activity, especially in thefront part of her brain.I came home that night and told Breanne what I saw and told her I wanted to geta new scan. Because of the injection with the procedure, she protested, “I don’twant a scan, Dad. All you think about are scans.” But I am a child psychiatrist.I know how to get my way with kids. I felt this was very important and so Iasked her what it would take to get a scan. She told me she wanted a telephoneline in her room. I started to think that maybe she was smarter than I thought.Her new SPECT study was virtually identical to the one seven years earlier. Icried when I saw it.The next night on a low dose of medication I rescanned her, and her brainnormalized. Breanne’s learning struggles had nothing to do with herintelligence. The low activity in her brain was limiting the access she had toher own brain. I put her on a low dose of medicine along with some supplements.A few days later she said that learning was much easier for her. She startedbringing home A’s on her tests, which had never happened before. When she wentto biology, she said she understood concepts for the first time. Usually a shychild in class, she started raising her hand and even participated in debates.At dinner one night she winked at me and said, “I kicked butt in a debatetoday.” This was not the same child I knew. Four months after her scan, she gotstraight A’s for the first time in her life. She repeated the feat all the waythrough high school and most of college. She has a completely differentperception of herself—one that fits her reality of being smart, competent, andable to look forward to a bright future.When you effectively treat someone with ADD you can change their whole lives.Then why are medications like Ritalin so controversial? Because although theywork for some people with ADD, they can make other people much worse. Until Istarted doing scans I did not know why. What I found out from imaging was thatADD was not one thing, it was at least six different things, and giving everyonethe same treatment helped some people but created disasters in others.Here is a brief description of the six types and treatments.Type 1: Classic ADDPrimary ADD symptoms plus hyperactivity, restlessness, and impulsivity. On SPECTscans we see decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex, especially withconcentration. Usually diagnosed early and effectively treated with stimulantmedications (e.g., Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin, Dexedrine, Strattera, orProvigil), fish oil, exercise, and a higher protein, lower simple carbohydratediet. Supplement alternatives to medication include L-tyrosine,DL-phenylalanine, L-theanine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and grape seed extract (seeChapter 6).Type 2: Inattentive ADDPrimary ADD symptoms plus low energy and motivation, spaciness, and internalpreoccupation. On SPECT scans we see decreased activity in the prefrontal cortexand cerebellum, especially with concentration. Type 2 is diagnosed later inlife, if at all. It is more common in girls. These are quiet kids and adults,often labeled lazy, unmotivated, and not that smart. It is also effectivelytreated with stimulant medications (e.g., Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin,Dexedrine, Strattera, or Provigil), fish oil, exercise, and a higher protein,lower simple carbohydrate diet. Supplement alternatives to medication includeL-tyrosine, DL-phenylalanine, L-theanine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and grape seedextract (see Chapter 6).Type 3: Overfocused ADDPrimary ADD symptoms plus cognitive inflexibility, trouble shifting attention,preoccupation with negative thoughts or behaviors, worrying, grudge holding,argumentative and oppositional behaviors, and a need for sameness. Often seen infamilies with alcoholism, addiction problems, or obsessive-compulsivetendencies. On SPECT scans we see decreased activity in the prefrontal cortexwith concentration plus increased anterior cingulate activity. Stimulants, bythemselves, usually make this type worse; people become more focused on thethings that bother them. Effectively treated with the antidepressant Effexor, ora combination of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; e.g., Prozac)and a stimulant, fish oil, exercise, and a higher carbohydrate diet. Supplementalternatives to medication include a combination of a stimulating supplement,such as L-tyrosine with a serotonin-boosting supplement such as5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and St. John’s wort (see Chapter 6).Type 4: Temporal Lobe ADDPrimary ADD symptoms plus a short fuse, tendency to misinterpret comments,periods of anxiety, headaches or abdominal pain, history of head injury, familyhistory of rages, dark thoughts, memory problems, and a struggle with reading.Often seen in families with learning or temper problems. On SPECT scans we seedecreased activity in the prefrontal cortex with concentration and decreasedtemporal lobe activity. Stimulants, by themselves, usually make people with thistype more irritable. Effectively treated with a combination of antiseizuremedications (such as Neurontin) and stimulants, fish oil, exercise, and a higherprotein diet. Supplement alternatives to medication include a combination of astimulating supplement, such as L-tyrosine with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)to help stabilize moods or gingko, phosphatidylserine, or huperzine to help withlearning and memory (see Chapter 6).Type 5: Limbic ADDPrimary ADD symptoms plus chronic mild sadness, negativity, low energy, lowself-esteem, irritability, social isolation, poor appetite, and sleep patterns.On SPECT scans we see decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex at rest andwith concentration and increased deep limbic activity. Stimulants, bythemselves, usually cause problems with rebound or cause depressive symptoms.Effectively treated with the antidepressant Wellbutrin or the supplementS-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe) plus fish oil, exercise, and a balanced diet.Supplement alternatives to medication include SAMe, L-tyrosine, orDL-phenylalanine.Type 6: Ring of Fire ADDPrimary ADD symptoms plus extreme moodiness, anger outbursts, oppositional,inflexibility, fast thoughts, excessive talking, and extreme sensitivity tosounds and lights. I named it Ring of Fire after the intense ring ofoveractivity that I saw in the brains of affected people. This type is usuallymade much worse with stimulants if used alone. I usually start with a supplementcombination called Neurolink, which contains GABA, 5-HTP, and L-tyrosine.Sometimes a stimulant may also be needed. Medication alternatives includeanticonvulsants (e.g., Neurontin) and an SSRI medication, the use of the novelantipsychotic medications (e.g., Risperdal or Zyprexa) plus fish oil, exercise,and a balanced diet. Knowing your type is essential to getting the right help for yourself. If thesedescriptions are not clear enough, consider picking up my book Healing ADD ortaking our ADD Type Test at www.amenclinics.com [http://www.Amenclinics.com].Common Treatments for All TypesThere are many treatments common to all people with ADD. Here are the mostimportant ones to start with today.1. Take a 100 percent multiple vitamin every day. Studies have reported thatthey help people with learning and help prevent chronic illness. No matter whattype of ADD you or your child has, take a 100 percent vitamin and mineralsupplement a day. When I was in medical school the professor who taught ourcourse in nutrition said that if people eat a balanced diet they do not needvitamin or mineral supplements. I have seen that balanced diets are a thing ofthe past for many of our “fast-food families.” In my experience, ADD families inparticular have problems with planning and tend to eat out much more frequentlythan non-ADD families. Protect yourself and your child by taking a 100 percentvitamin and mineral supplement. In a 1988 study published in the British journalLancet, ninety children between the ages of twelve and thirteen were dividedinto three groups. One group took no tablet, one group took a typical multiplevitamin and mineral tablet, and the last group took a tablet that looked andtasted just like the vitamin and mineral tablet yet contained no vitamins orminerals. The results of this well-controlled study was that the group who tookthe vitamin and mineral tablet had a significant increase in nonverbalintelligence, while the other two groups showed no difference at all. Thesubclinical vitamin and mineral deficiency may have been contributing to thesestudents performing below their abilities.2. Omega-3 fatty acids have been found to be helpful in children with ADD. Thereare three double-blind studies suggesting their value, plus people with ADD havebeen found to have low levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their blood. Omega-3fatty acids have two major components: epicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) anddocosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA tends to be stimulating while DHA tends to besedating (personal communication with Joe Hibbeln at the National Institutes ofHealth in 2007). For Types 1 and 2 I recommend the EPA component of fish oil(NeuroEPA from Amen Clinics) and for the other types a combination of EPA andDHA (NeurOmega). For adults I recommend taking 2,000–4,000 milligrams a day and1,000–2,000 milligrams for children. An easy form for children to take isCoromega.3. Eliminate caffeine and nicotine. They both interfere with sleep and decreasethe effectiveness of other treatments.4. Intense aerobic exercise daily for thirty to forty-five minutes. Kids shouldengage in a safe exercise like long, fast walks (no brain injuries, please).5. Turn off the television and video games, or limit them to no more than thirtyminutes a day. This may be hard for kids and teens, but it can make a hugedifference.6. Food is a drug. Most people with ADD do best with a higher protein, lowersimple carbohydrate diet. In a 2008 study from Holland, researchers found thatputting children on a restricted elimination diet reduced ADD symptoms by morethan 50 percent in 73 percent of children, which is basically the sameeffectiveness of stimulant medication without any of the side effects.Elimination diets are not easy to do. Basically, during the study the childrencould only eat rice, turkey, lamb, vegetables, fruits, margarine, vegetable oil,tea, pear juice, and water. But the results were stunning. Elimination diets maybe a place to start; by gradually adding back other foods you will be able tosee what items may be causing the abnormal behaviors. Working with anutritionist may make a big difference. In this study the researchers also foundthat the children’s moods and oppositional behaviors were also improved. Peoplewith Type 3 do better with more carbohydrates in their diet. Types 5 and 6 seemto do better with more balanced diets, like the Zone Diet described by BarrySears.7. In dealing with kids, employees, and even spouses with ADD, no yelling! Manypeople with ADD seek conflict or excitement as a means of stimulation. They canbe masters at making other people mad or angry. Do not lose your temper withthem. If they get you to explode, their unconscious, low energy prefrontalcortex lights up and likes it. Never let your anger be their medication. Theycan get addicted to it.Natural Supplement Strategies for Each TypeIn this section I will reexamine each ADD type and provide more details aboutthe supplements that I have seen to have clinical benefit. I’ll give you therationale and dosage protocols that I suggest to my patients. If you decide touse these supplements instead of medication, as many people do, make sure youkeep tabs on their effectiveness. I only want my patients to take something thatis clearly beneficial to them. I also want them to take medication if thesupplements are not effective. Many parents say that they want to try thenatural supplements before they try medication. I’m not opposed to that, but Iworry that if the supplements are not fully effective that they will not pursuemore effective treatments, as people with ADD are masterful at procrastination.Follow through to find what works for yourself or your child. Be open to newideas and persist until you get the best brain and life functioning. Of thedifferent options, try them in the order I list and initially try them one at atime unless I note differently. Please be sure to discuss these options withyour health care professionals.TYPE 1: CLASSIC ADD AND TYPE 2: INATTENTIVE ADDSupplement alternatives for Type 1 and 2 include L-tyrosine, DL-phenylalanine,acetyl-L-carnitine, L-theanine, or grape seed extract. These types seem to bedue to deficiencies of the neurotransmitter dopamine.L-TYROSINEA search of the medical literature on L-tyrosine found eighteen studies thatapply to mental health and learning involving approximately 503 patients. Of theeighteen studies, eleven are positive and seven are negative. In my experience,L-tyrosine can have a mild positive effect on Types 1 and 2 ADD.I frequently prescribe the amino acid L-tyrosine in doses of 500 milligrams to1,500 milligrams two to three times a day for adults and 100 milligrams to 500milligrams two to three times a day for children under age ten. L-tyrosine isthe amino acid building block for dopamine, the neurotransmitter implicated inADD. It is reported to increase the level of phenylethylamine, a mild stimulantthat is found in high concentrations in chocolate. Many of my patients havereported that it is helpful for them. It is softer in its effect, butnonetheless they notice a positive effect. Because of absorption patterns, Irecommend that they take it on an empty stomach (a half hour before meals or anhour after meals). I have not seen any side effects with L-tyrosine, except formild weight loss. If it is given by itself to Type 3 ADD patients, it tends toincrease the intensity of overfocused symptoms. Patients with a history of maniashould exercise caution with the use of L-tyrosine because the energizingproperties of this compound may trigger a manic episode.L-tyrosine is also the amino acid building block for epinephrine andnorepinephrine. L-tyrosine has been reported to help boost energy levels, mood,focus, and metabolism. L-tyrosine may increase motivation and improveconcentration. Research suggests that L-tyrosine acts to help the body adapt andcope with stress. Taken ahead of time, L-tyrosine allows some people to avoidtypical bodily reactions and feelings from stressful situations like surgery,emotional upset, and sleep deprivation. L-tyrosine appears to be a successfuladdition to conventional treatment for cocaine and nicotine withdrawal.L-tyrosine levels are also low in some depressed patients. A number of studiesconducted in the 1970s showed encouraging results regarding the use ofL-tyrosine to ease symptoms of depression, especially when used together withthe supplement 5-HTP.Phil, age sixteen, had been treated for Type 1 ADD for several years. He wastaking Ritalin, which would work for a while and then seem to wear off. Theup-and-down effectiveness of the medication frustrated him. He tried Adderall,but it seemed to have the same effect. I stopped the stimulant medications, puthim on 1,000 milligrams of L-tyrosine three times a day, was firm about dietaryguidelines, and encouraged Phil to walk fast for an hour five times a week.Within a week, he said he felt better. He has maintained the regimen for fouryears now.DL-PHENYLALANINEA search of the medical literature on DL-phenylalanine found four studies thatapply to mental health and learning involving approximately ninety-threepatients. Of the four studies, all are positive. In my experience,DL-phenylalanine can have a mild positive effect.DL-phenylalanine is an essential amino acid, which means that it is essential tohuman health but is not manufactured in the body, so it must be obtained fromfood or supplements. The body converts DL-phenylalanine into L-tyrosine, anotheramino acid essential for making proteins, certain brain chemicals, and thyroidhormones. Symptoms of DL-phenylalanine deficiency include confusion, lack ofenergy and decreased alertness, memory, and appetite. A number of studies shownorepinephrine and epinephrine (adrenaline) to be low in patients withdepression. The antidepressants imipramine and desipramine work in part byincreasing norepinephrine in the brain. Theoretically, when more precursor isavailable, more neurotransmitters will be made. Therefore it makes sense that byboosting DL-phenylalanine we can increase norepinephrine and have a positiveimpact on concentration and mood. In fact, in a number of studiesDL-phenylalanine has been found to be helpful for depression, energy, and paincontrol. I have used it for twenty years as an antidepressant in children,teens, and adults. It is milder in its effect than prescribed antidepressants,but it also causes significantly less side effects. People who havephenylketonuria, commonly known as PKU, should not take DL-phenylalanine,because they do not have the enzyme that metabolizes it. The recommended dose is400 milligrams three times a day on an empty stomach for adults and 200milligrams three times daily for children.ACETYL-L-CARNITINEA search of the medical literature on acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) found twenty-sixstudies that apply to mental health and learning involving approximatelytwenty-one hundred patients. Of the twenty-six studies, twenty-three arepositive and three are negative. In my experience, ALC can have a mild positiveeffect.ALC is a nutrient that has been reported to improve mental focus, enhanceenergy, and slow aging. Research has shown that ALC increases levels ofneurotransmitters needed for memory, focus and learning, and repairs the damagedone to brain cells caused by stress and poor nutrition. About 95 percent ofenergy production in your cells occurs in the mitochondria. Many diseases ofaging are increasingly being referred to as “mitochondrial disorders.” ALC hasbeen shown to help increase energy production in the mitochondria.From Italy comes a fascinating study about the use of ALC for ADHD and Fragile Xsyndrome. It is a treatment we should consider for ADHD children and adults.Fragile X syndrome is the most common hereditary form of mental retardation.Many children with Fragile X syndrome also suffer from ADHD, which complicatessocial relationships at home and at school. Although stimulant medication suchas Ritalin is often effective, it also causes side effects such as increasedirritability, decreased verbalization, and social withdrawal. A previous studyshowed that ALC significantly reduced hyperactive behavior in Fragile X syndromeboys with ADHD who were treated with it for one year without causing adverseside effects. The same authors have now conducted a randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled multicenter study to determine the effectiveness of ALC in alarger group. Led by M. Giulia Torrioli and Giovanni Neri of the UniversitàCattolica in Rome, the study involved fifty-one boys between six and twelveyears old with Fragile X syndrome and ADHD who were treated in one of eightcenters in Italy, France, and Spain. Each patient followed the treatment fortwelve months, which involved 500 milligrams of ALC or a placebo given twicedaily. Patients were evaluated by a team of child neuropsychiatrists andpsychologists at the start of the study, after one month, six months, and twelvemonths. The effects of the drug and placebo were evaluated using a set ofneuropsychological tests to assess behavior. Those treated with ALC demonstratedreduced hyperactive behavior and increased attention. No side effects wereexhibited, confirming that ALC is a safe alternative to stimulants. The patientstreated with the placebo also showed reduced hyperactive behavior, although notnearly to the extent as the ALC-treated patients. The patients treated with ALCalso had significantly improved social ability compared with the placebo-treatedgroup. The authors proposed that ALC be recommended as a treatment of ADHD inFragile X syndrome children, since it effectively reduces hyperactive behaviorand improves social abilities without adverse side effects. They also suggestthat these results may be applicable to children with autism, who also do noteasily tolerate stimulants.Some people report feeling an increase in mental energy and focus within twentyminutes, which is why you should not take it too late in the day, as it may giveyou insomnia. Even though ALC is not a stimulant, it seems to naturally increaseenergy in the brain. Over thirty studies show that ALC slows or preventsage-related decline in mental function. In one study, 1.5 grams a day of ALCgiven to 236 older adults for forty-five days significantly increased theeffectiveness of performance on all the measures of cognitive functioning,memory performance, and constructional thinking. Twenty adults given 1.5 gramsof ALC experienced reversal of many of the signs of brain aging. Alcoholics withcognitive impairment have also benefited from ALC. ALC is potentially valuablein helping depression. One hundred sixty patients who had suffered from a strokea year or more ago were given 1.5 grams of ALC a day for eight weeks. This ledto increased speed of recovery, as well as improved mood and attention span. Atotal of over 600 patients with Alzheimer’s disease have been studied in overtwenty years of research, demonstrating that ALC benefits patients withdementia.Because of lack of long-term safety studies, ALC is not advised for pregnantwomen or nursing mothers. Mild gastrointestinal symptoms may occur in thosetaking ALC, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.Increased agitation has been reported in some with Alzheimer’s disease whentaking oral ALC. In those with seizure disorders, an increase in seizurefrequency has been reported in some taking ALC.You should consider ALC if you suffer with tiredness, mental fatigue, memoryloss, or attentional problems. The typical dose is 500–1,500 milligrams a day.L-THEANINEA search of the medical literature on L-theanine found six studies that apply tomental health and learning involving approximately eighty-five patients. Of thesix studies, all showed some positive effect. In my experience, L-theanine canhave a mild positive effect.L-theanine is an amino acid mainly found naturally in the green tea plant.L-theanine is the predominant amino acid in green tea and makes up 50 percent ofthe total free amino acids in the plant. L-theanine is considered the maincomponent responsible for the taste of green tea. It is marketed in Japan as anutritional supplement for mood modulation. L-theanine may also have activity inmodulating the metabolism of cancer chemotherapeutic agents and amelioratingtheir side effects.L-theanine has been shown to penetrate the brain and produce significantincreases in the neurotransmitters serotonin and/or dopamine concentrations.These findings led to recent studies investigating the possibility thatL-theanine might enhance learning ability, induce relaxation, and relieveemotional stress. Memory and learning ability were said to be improved in youngmale Wistar rats given 180 milligrams of L-theanine daily for four months. Humanperformance was assessed using a test for learning ability and passive andactive avoidance tests for memory. The mental effects of L-theanine were testedin a small group of volunteers divided into “high-anxiety” and “low-anxiety”groups. The volunteers were females ages 18–22. Their level of anxiety wasassessed by a manifest anxiety scale. Subjects received water, 50 milligrams ofL-theanine, or 200 milligrams of L-theanine solution once a week. Brain waveswere measured 60 minutes after administration. The 200-milligram dose (dissolvedin 100 milliliters of water) resulted in significantly greater production ofalpha waves than was observed in subjects receiving water. The effect wasdose-dependent. The researchers regarded the significantly increased productionof alpha-brain wave activity as an index of increased relaxation.Pregnant women and nursing mothers should avoid L-theanine supplements. Use ofL-theanine supplements concomitantly with cancer chemotherapeutic agents must bedone under medical supervision. There are no known adverse reactions.L-theanine supplements are available for the promotion of relaxation andmodulation of mood. Doses used are between 50 and 200 milligrams, as necessary.L-theanine is available in some green tea preparations. The amino acidconstitutes between 1 percent and 2 percent of the dry weight of green tealeaves.GRAPE SEED /PINE BARK EXTRACT (PYCNOGENOL)A search of the medical literature on Pycnogenol found five studies that applyto ADD involving more than a hundred patients. Of the five studies, four showedsome positive effect. In my experience Pycnogenol can have a mild positiveeffect.Grape seed or pine bark extract has also shown some mild benefit for Type 1 andType 2 ADD. Grape seed or pine bark extract are proanthocyanidin compounds.These compounds have been found to increase blood flow and they act assuperantioxidants, twenty to fifty times as powerful as vitamin E. There areseveral published studies with grape seed or pine bark extract in ADD and anumber of published case reports.Here is an example from Slovakia. Sixty-one children were supplemented with 1milligram per kilogram per day of Pycnogenol or placebo over a period of fourweeks in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients wereexamined at start of trial, one month after treatment, and 1 month after end oftreatment period by standard questionnaires. Results show that one-monthPycnogenol administration caused a significant reduction of hyperactivity,improved attention and visual-motoric coordination and concentration of childrenwith ADD. In the placebo group no positive effects were found. One month aftertermination of Pycnogenol administration a relapse of symptoms was noted. Theauthors concluded that “the results point to an option to use Pycnogenol as anatural supplement to relieve ADHD symptoms of children.”There is a body of medical literature that reports these compounds are veryhelpful for people with varicose veins. If you have ADD and varicose veins, thengrape seed or pine bark extract may be for you.Crystal, age forty-eight, came to the clinic for symptoms of ADD. Her whole lifeshe had been restless, inattentive, easily distracted, terribly disorganized,and impulsive. After her third child she also developed terrible varicose veins,which I had noticed in the initial interview. When we talked about treatmentoptions for her classic Type 1 ADD she said that she wanted to try the grapeseed extract. Then she would see about other options. After three weeks shenoticed that she felt better, had more energy, and her legs looked and feltbetter. Eventually we added L-tyrosine to give her more help with focus, but theregimen has worked well for her over the past several years.TYPE 3: OVERFOCUSED ADDThis type of ADD seems likely due to a relative deficiency of both serotonin anddopamine. In this type I use something to enhance serotonin such as St. John’sWort or 5-HTP plus something to enhance dopamine such as L-Tyrosine.ST. JOHN’S WORTA search of the medical literature on St. John’s wort found thirty-two studiesthat apply to mental health and learning involving approximately one thousandpatients. Of the thirty-two studies, thirty were positive and two were negative.In my experience, St. John’s wort can have a significantly positive effect onmild to moderate depression and overfocused ADD when combined with L-tyrosine.A high number of studies support the usage of St. John’s wort as an effectivetreatment for minor to moderate cases of major depression. St. John’s wort hasalso been shown to be better tolerated by individuals than prescriptionmedication, with less side effects. In addition, randomized, double-blindstudies have shown St. John’s wort to be equally as effective as antidepressantprescription medications (e.g., citalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline,and imipramine).I have seen that a combination of St. John’s wort and L-tyrosine is often veryhelpful. St. John’s wort comes from the flowers of the Saint-John’s-wort plant(wort is Old English for “plant”). It got its name from the fact that it bloomsaround June 24, the feast day of St. John the Baptist, and the red ring aroundthe flowers when crushed looks like blood, the blood of the beheaded John theBaptist. St. John’s wort seems to increase serotonin availability in the brain.The starting dosage of St. John’s wort is 300 milligrams a day for children, 300milligrams twice a day for teens, and 600 milligrams in the morning and 300milligrams at night for adults. Sometimes I’ll go as high as 1,800 milligrams inadults. The bottle should say that it contains 0.3 percent hypericin, which isbelieved to be the active ingredient of St. John’s wort. I have done a number ofbefore-and-after SPECT studies with St. John’s wort. It clearly decreasescingulate gyrus hyperactivity for many patients. It also helps with moodinessand trouble shifting attention. Unfortunately, I have also seen it decreaseprefrontal cortex activity. One of the women in the study said, “I’m happier,but I’m dingier.” When cingulate symptoms are present with ADD symptoms, it’simportant to use St. John’s wort with a stimulating substance like L-tyrosine ora stimulant such as Adderall.It has been reported that St. John’s wort increases sun sensitivity (you couldget sunburned more easily) and may decrease the effectiveness of birth controlpills and antiviral medications. Also, don’t use it if temporal lobe symptomsare present, without first stabilizing the temporal lobes.Elaine, age sixteen, had always been a worrier. She also had problems with angerat home. If things did not go her way she would explode at her parents or at heryounger sister. As a student she was a perfectionist, which caused her to spendexcessive time on assignments. Her mother, a school principal, brought her to myclinic after she heard me lecture. She told me that she was sure Elaine had Type3 ADD, causing her to overfocus. Her SPECT study showed marked increasedactivity in her anterior cingulate gyrus. She also had mild decreased activityin her prefrontal cortex. I placed her on St. John’s wort, 600 milligrams in themorning and 300 milligrams at night. I also had her take 500 milligrams ofL-tyrosine two to three times a day. Within a month Elaine was much better. Shewas more relaxed, less reactive, and did much better in her classes. She saidthat studying was easy because she no longer felt the need to have everythingjust so. She still wanted to excel, but didn’t have to copy pages over three andfour times until things were perfect.5-HTPA search of the medical literature on 5-HTP found twenty-five studies that applyto mental health and learning involving approximately one thousand patients. Ofthe twenty-five studies, twenty-one were positive and four were negative. In myexperience, 5-HTP can have a significantly positive effect on anxiety, worry andsleep, and overfocused ADD when combined with L-tyrosine.5-HTP is a step closer in the serotonin production pathway. It is also morewidely available than L-tryptophan and it is more easily taken up in the brain.Seventy percent is taken up into the brain, as opposed to only 3 percent ofL-tryptophan. 5-HTP is about five to ten times more powerful than L-tryptophan.A number of double-blind studies have shown that 5-HTP is as effective asantidepressant medication. It boosts serotonin levels in the brain and helps tocalm cingulate gyrus hyperactivity (greasing the cingulate, if you will, to helpwith shifting of attention). The dose of 5-HTP for adults is 50–300 milligrams aday. Children should start at half dose. Take 5-HTP and L-tryptophan on an emptystomach. The most common side effect of 5-HTP is an upset stomach. It is usuallyvery mild. Start slowly and work your way up slowly.TYPE 4: TEMPORAL LOBE ADDTemporal lobe ADD is a combination of temporal lobe dysfunction and poorprefrontal cortex activity. Strategies geared toward temporal lobe stabilizationand enhancement have proven valuable for this ADD type. From a medicationstandpoint, I have seen antiseizure (also called anticonvulsant) medications bethe most helpful. One of the mechanisms by these medications works by enhancingthe amino acid GABA.GABAA search of the medical literature on GABA found only one study that applies tomental health and learning. GABA is a major neurotransmitter widely distributedthroughout the brain. Because too much excitation in the brain can lead toirritability, restlessness, insomnia, seizures, and movement disorders, it mustbe balanced with inhibition. GABA—the most important inhibitory neurotransmitterin the brain—provides this inhibition, acting like a brake during times ofrunaway activity. Medications for anxiety, such as Valium and anticonvulsants,stimulate GABA receptors and induce relaxation. Either low GABA levels ordecreased GABA function in the brain is associated with several psychiatric andneurological disorders, including anxiety, depression, insomnia, and epilepsy.Studies indicate GABA can improve relaxation and enhance sleep. GABA isavailable as dietary supplements in the United States.The mechanisms of most antiseizure drugs involve direct or indirect GABAenhancement. The drugs act in a variety of ways by increasing GABA availability.The ketogenic diet, employed in particular for treatment of childhood epilepsy,is theorized to work via a GABA mechanism. Ketosis increases brain metabolism ofacetate, which is converted to glutamine by glial cells. Glutamine is then takenup by GABA neurons and converted to GABA. Electroencephalogram tracings inhealthy human subjects on a ketogenic diet yielded patterns consistent withincreased GABA activity. Research indicates oral GABA supplementation may bebeneficial for epilepsy. Several animal and clinical studies have examined theeffect of a combination of GABA and phosphatidylserine (PS) in the treatment ofvarious types of seizure disorders. A pilot study of forty-two subjects withdrug-resistant epilepsy (ten with absence seizures [periods of spaciness]) founda combination of increasing doses of GABA (1,500–2,500 milligrams daily) and PS(300–500 milligrams daily)—in separate capsules—resulted in a significant,dose-dependent decrease in absence seizures, but not in simple or complexpartial seizures.I have seen GABA have a calming effect on people who struggle with temper,irritability, and anxiety (all of which may be temporal lobe symptoms). Thedoses of GABA range from 250 milligrams–750 milligrams twice a day for adults,half that for children.Many people with temporal lobe ADD suffer from memory problems. I have found anumber of natural substances helpful to enhance memory, including gingko biloba,PS, and huperzine A. These are discussed in chapter 8.TYPE 5: LIMBIC ADDLimbic ADD has many symptoms of mild depression, including negativity, sadness,feelings of hopelessness, and an overabundance of automatic negative thoughts.Frequently I have seen stimulants make people who have this type of ADD morenegative and moody. The supplements that seem to help this type of ADD best areSAMe, DL-phenylalanine, or L-tyrosine. DL-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine weredescribed earlier.SAMEA search of the medical literature on SAMe found forty-nine studies that applyto mental health, learning, and pain involving more than a thousand patients. Ofthe forty-nine studies, thirty-eight were positive and eleven were negative. Inmy experience, SAMe can have a significantly positive effect on mood, pain,energy, and focus.SAMe is involved with the production of many important brain compounds,including neurotransmitters. It donates “methyl” groups to these compounds sothat they can function properly. Normally, the brain manufactures all the SAMeit needs from the amino acid methionine. In depression, however, this synthesishas been found to be impaired. Supplementing the diet with SAMe has been foundto increase the neurotransmitters involved with depression and improve cellmembrane fluidity. SAMe is one of the best natural antidepressants; a number ofrecent studies have shown that it is as effective as antidepressant medication.SAMe has also been found helpful for people who suffer from fibromyalgia, achronic muscle pain disorder. Fibromyalgia and ADD run commonly together. Ithink the chronic stress associated with ADD is in part responsible for themuscle pain. People who have bipolar disorder or manic-depressive illness orType 6 (Ring of Fire) ADD should not take SAMe. There have been a number ofreported cases of SAMe causing manic or hypomanic episodes (excessively up orhappy moods, extreme impulsivity in sexuality or spending money, pressuredspeech, or decreased need for sleep). I think these reports highlight that SAMeis an effective antidepressant, as all of the prescription antidepressants havethat capability as well.In one study from UCLA, Walid Shekim and colleagues used oral SAMe in a sampleof well-diagnosed adults with ADHD, in a four-week open trial to establish SAMeeffectiveness and safety and in a nine-week, double-blind, placebo-controlledcrossover trial. Preliminary data from the open trial reveal that 75 percent(six out of eight male) patients improve on it. The two who did not improve hadnot improved on the methylphenidate trial. Improvement ranged from moderate tomarked, with minimal and transient side effects that did not interfere withfunctioning.The dosage of SAMe is between 200 milligrams and 400 milligrams two to fourtimes a day, half that for children. Nature’s Made is a good brand and is soldat Costco, lowering the cost significantly.TYPE 6: RING OF FIRE ADDType 6 ADD is often associated with intense ADD symptoms, such as intensehyperactivity and distractibility, severe impulsiveness, hypersensitivity to theenvironment, pressured speech, and cyclic mood changes. I think that this typeof ADD may be related to bipolar disorder. Stimulants, by themselves, tend tomake it worse. At the Amen Clinics we use the supplement Neurolink andhigh-quality fish oil. Neurolink is a combination of GABA, 5-HTP, inositol, andL-tyrosine. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and may help to calmoveractive areas, 5-HTP and inositol act to increase serotonin availability andmay help increase mood and flexibility, while L-tyrosine is the amino acidbuilding block for dopamine and may help with focus and motivation. I usuallystart with two capsules twice a day for three weeks, then increase to threecapsules twice a day for three weeks, then if needed go to four capsules twice aday. Patience is needed as it often takes several weeks for it to be effective.In addition to Neurolink, we also use high-quality fish oil, which has beenfound to be helpful in mood disorders and to calm hyperactive brain function. Werecommend 2,000–4,000 milligrams a day of NeurOmega from the Amen Clinics orCoromega. For more severe clinical presentations, I recommend fish oil plus ananticonvulsant medication or atypical antipsychotic to start and often anantidepressant after mood stabilization is obtained.Cody came to see me from Georgia. He had all of the symptoms of ADD, but when hewas placed on Ritalin he became more obsessive, couldn’t sleep, and bit hisfingernails until they bled. His scan did not show the typical ADD pattern butshowed that he had too much activity in his brain. He needed something to calmhis brain down, not stimulate it. On Neurolink, a natural supplement we producethat contains GABA, 5-HTP, and L-tyrosine, he did much better.Through the years I have treated many pilots with ADD who cannot take medicineand keep their Federal Aviation Administration licenses, which seems a bitbackward to me. I want my pilot to be able to concentrate and really don’t wanthim to be distracted or conflict seeking when he is flying the plane. Butbecause of the regulations pilots need natural treatments in order to keep theirjobs. Many people, although not everyone, can find success with naturaltreatments for ADD."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_030_r1.jpg]Natural Ways to Healimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIONIn this chapter I am going to continue our discussion about the common brainproblems that can interfere with having a magnificent mind. I will discussanxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. According to the National Institutesof Health nearly seventy-five million Americans, or one in four of us, willsuffer from one of these disorders at some point in our lives.Many famous people throughout history have struggled with anxiety anddepression, including Mark Twain, Ernest Hemingway, J. K. Rowling, and PrincessDiana. It is no secret that Abraham Lincoln suffered from periods of severedepression, including suicidal thoughts. In 1836 he told a friend that therewere times he was “so overcome with depression that he never dare carry a knifein his pocket.” It’s possible that Lincoln inherited the tendency for depressionfrom his mother, whom he described as melancholy with “eyes as pools ofsadness.” Or it may have been the result of a severe brain injury he had when hewas twelve years old. Brain injuries often predispose people to mood disorders.Without effective medication or natural supplements to rely on, Lincoln usedlaughter as a form of self-medication. If his friends could get him to laughwith a funny story or have him tell one of his humorous anecdotes, Lincoln’smood would begin to brighten. On the election night of 1864 Lincoln was verynervous and tense, anticipating a bad outcome. He read a book of humor to calmhis nerves. When a member of his cabinet saw what Lincoln was reading, he leftthe White House in disgust, thinking that the president did not understand theseriousness of the evening. Apparently, Lincoln understood what modern-daydoctors are now just discovering—laughter is healing.Even now, many people think that anxiety and depression are the result of a badattitude or a weak will. If only you tried harder, the bad feelings would goaway. Yet these disorders are often the result of a brain that is out ofbalance, just like diabetes is a disorder of insulin. Seeing these as medicalproblems rather than moral problems enables people to get the help they need.One common misconception is that anxiety and depression are separate problems.They actually run together nearly 70 percent of the time. Through our brainimaging work I have described seven different types of anxiety and depression,and knowing which type you have is critical to getting the right help. Shortly,I will tell you about all of the types, but first I want to share with you thetreatments I recommend for all types.Treatments for All Types of Anxiety and DepressionI recommend a general five-step approach for treating anxiety and depression.First, it is important to rule out a medical cause of anxiety or depression.Thyroid abnormalities, anemia, sleep apnea, brain injuries, and certainmedications can all cause these problems. Getting a physical exam is one of thefirst, most important steps in dealing with these issues. One of my best friendsfrom college came to see me because she was feeling overwhelmed and depressed.When I scanned her, she had severe overall low activity in her brain. Her brainlooked like she was a drug addict. But I had known her for many years and knewthat was not the case. Her blood work indicated a severe vitamin B12 deficiency,causing her to be very anemic. Treating her medical problem helped her mood andher brain.Second, exercise helps all of the types. Exercise boosts blood flow and helpsbring nutrients to the brain. In one head-to-head study comparing exercise withZoloft, one of our effective antidepressants, they were equally effective aftertwelve weeks and exercise was actually more effective after ten months.Third, I recommend that all of my patients take a multiple vitamin and fish oilsupplement every day. Why? People who are depressed often do not eat balanceddiets and vitamins can provide essential nutrients, such as vitamin D, that havebeen found to be low in many depressed patients. Vitamin D is made in our skinfrom sun exposure, but because we are exercising less outdoors and usingsunscreen when we do, many people even in sunny climates have vitamin Ddeficiencies. Taking a supplement or walking in the sun every day for twentyminutes without sunscreen may be good for you.Fish oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which have been found to be low in peoplesuffering from depression, ADD, Alzheimer’s disease, and in those who havesuicidal thoughts. A search of the medical literature on omega-3 fatty acidsfound twelve studies that apply to mood enhancement. Of the twelve studies, tenwere positive and two were negative. I think omega-3 fatty acids are anessential component to the treatment of depression. As I mentioned in the lastchapter, omega-3 fatty acids have two major components: eicosapentaenoic acid(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA tends to be stimulating while DHAtends to be sedating. For unfocused anxiety and depression, I recommend the EPAcomponent of fish oil (NeuroEPA from Amen Clinics) and for the other types acombination of EPA and DHA (NeurOmega). For adults I recommend taking2,000–4,000 milligrams a day and 1,000–2,000 milligrams for children. An easyform for children to take is Coromega.Fourth, people with anxiety and depression are often filled with automaticnegative thoughts, or ANTs. These are the thoughts that automatically come intoyour mind and ruin your day. For many people, learning how to correct thesenegative thought patterns have been found to be as effective as antidepressantmedication, without any side effects. There will be more on this techniquelater.Fifth, natural supplements or medication can be very helpful. My bias usually isto start with natural supplements, while others prefer to start with medication.Either way, it is critical to know the type of anxiety or depression you have soyou can get the right help. If these descriptions are not clear enough, considerpicking up my book Healing Anxiety and Depression or taking the Brain Systemstest at www.amenclinics.com [http://www.Amenclinics.com].7 Types of Anxiety and DepressionType 1: Pure AnxietyAnxiety is the main issue. People with this type suffer from feeling anxious,tense, and nervous. They live with a sense that something bad is about to happenand often have physical feelings of anxiety, such as headaches, stomachaches,and heart palpitations. People with “pure anxiety” tend to avoid anything thatmakes them nervous, such as new places, and they are not good with conflict andtend to avoid it like the plague. I often say people with this type have way toomany “fortune-telling” ANTs. They are masterful at predicting the worst and lookto the future with fear.Here’s an example: Gary had gone to his doctor for back pain. When the doctorexamined him he found a tender spot over his kidneys. He told Gary he wanted toorder a kidney x-ray. That is when Gary’s thoughts ran wild.“The doctor is going to find out I have cancer,” he thought. Notice the littleleap in logic! But his thoughts didn’t stop there. “I’m going to have to havechemotherapy. I’m going to vomit my guts out, lose all my hair, be in atremendous amount of pain, and then I’m going to die!” All in about thirtyseconds. Then in a panic Gary said to the doctor, “I can’t have that x-ray.”“Why?” the doctor asked. “I need this x-ray, so I can figure out—”Gary said, “No, you don’t understand! I can’t have the x-ray!”That is when the doctor found my number and referred Gary to me.As Gary told me this story, I knew that he suffered with a panic disorder. Garywas a master at predicting the worst, which was driving his panic symptoms. Intreating Gary, I used deep relaxation and taught him to correct the ANTs thatwere feeding his anxiety. After two sessions I went with Gary to have the kidneyx-ray. I hypnotized him to be calm during the procedure, and he did well untilthe technician came back into the room with a worried look on his face and askedGary what side his pain was on. Gary grabbed his chest and looked at me as if tosay, “I knew you were lying to me! I am going to die.” I patted him on the legand said, “Look Gary, before you die, let me take a look at the x-ray.” Gary hada big kidney stone, which can be terribly painful, but kidney stones usuallydon’t kill anyone! Gary’s anxiety was ruining his life.In treating pure anxiety, I teach my patients deep relaxation techniques and howto correct the negative thoughts that cause their suffering. In addition,certain supplements such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), vitamin B6,L-glutamine, valerian, or kava kava may be helpful. I don’t much like thetypical antianxiety medications, like Xanax, because on scans the effects lookvery similar to those of alcohol, plus they can be addictive and affect memory.Type 2: Pure DepressionSadness is the main symptom. People with this type also struggle with lowenergy, sleep and appetite problems, and they may have little interest and getlittle pleasure in things that are usually fun. Their ANTs are different fromthe fortune-telling ANTs of Type 1 patients and tend to be more focused onfeeling hopeless, helpless, worthless, and guilty. For this type I like thenatural supplement S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe), which has been found to behelpful for depression and pain, or I prescribe the antidepressant Wellbutrin.Type 3: Mixed Anxiety and DepressionA combination of both anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms, which is muchmore common than the pure types alone, calls for a combination of Types 1 and 2treatments.Type 4: Overfocused Anxiety and DepressionPeople with this type have anxiety or depression, and they get stuck on negativethoughts or behaviors. When this type is combined with anxiety, people get stuckon fearful thoughts. When it is combined with sadness, people get stuck ondepressing thoughts. Obsessive-compulsive disorder occurs when people get stuckon obsessions or compulsive behaviors. With phobias, people get stuck on a fear,such as snakes. With post-traumatic stress disorder, people get stuck onsomething bad that happened in the past. Overfocused anxiety and depression isalso associated with people who tend to worry, hold grudges, are rigid, and tendto be oppositional or argumentative. I have noticed that this type occurs morefrequently in children or grandchildren of alcoholics.In treating Type 4, it is important to boost serotonin, an important moodchemical in the brain. Supplements that do this include 5-hydroxytryptophan(5-HTP), L-tryptophan, and inositol, and there are currently six medicationsthat do it as well: Prozac, Zoloft, Celexa, Paxil, Luvox, and Lexapro.Type 5: Temporal Lobe Anxiety and DepressionThe temporal lobes are underneath your temples and behind your eyes. They arevery important to learning, memory, and emotional control. When there areproblems in this part of the brain, people struggle with temper outbursts;memory problems; mood instability; and sometimes dark, evil, or frighteningthoughts. People with this type tend to misinterpret comments as negative whenthey are not and they have trouble reading social cues. This type is commonafter a brain injury.The supplements used to treat this type include GABA and fish oil. Anantiseizure medication can also be helpful for this type. When there are memoryissues present, I may use the supplements gingko, phosphatidylserine, orhuperzine, or if they are severe I may use the medications Aricept or Namenda.Type 6: Cyclic Anxiety and DepressionMood cycles, sometimes mild, sometimes severe, is the typical symptom. Theclassic cyclic mood disorder is called bipolar disorder; people’s moods swingbetween two poles, from depression to mania. It affects nearly 3 percent ofAmericans in any given year and seems to have been increasing over the last fewdecades. Mania is the opposite of depression. During a manic episode, peopleneed less sleep, often have racing thoughts, and feel pressure to keep talking.They also may be irritable and very impulsive. People with bipolar disorder canbecome hypersexual, hyperreligious, or spend large amounts of money they do nothave. One of my first patients with this disorder spent thirty thousand dollarsthe family did not have and she had no idea how she would tell her husband.Sometimes bipolar disorder is mistaken for ADD. The distinction between the twois critical, however, because if you give people with bipolar disorder stimulantmedications you can make them much worse. Like ADD and other forms of anxietyand depression, there are degrees and types of bipolar disorder. Some peoplesuffer with mild mood swings while others have trouble staying out of hospitalsor jails. For severe bipolar disorder medication is usually important. I havenot found natural supplements to be as effective to fully treat this illness.Having said that, I give all of my bipolar patients fish oil in addition tomedication, as researchers from Harvard found it helpful to decrease mood swingsand relapse.Type 7: Unfocused Anxiety and DepressionPeople suffering from this type exhibit very low energy, trouble thinking, andfeeling as though they are in a fog. Rather than worry, they tend to havetrouble holding on to thoughts and often have memory problems. In treating Type7, it is important to find out why the brain is so underactive, treat anyproblems that might be present, and then find ways to stimulate the brain. Thebest supplement for this type is SAMe, and Wellbutrin is the bestantidepressant.Matilda was brought to our clinic by her family after she nearly burned down herhouse by forgetting something on the stove. Her family was at their wits’ end.At age sixty-nine Matilda had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and hadbeen getting worse. She had also lost her driver’s license because she had beenin four minor accidents. Five of her six children thought she should be in afacility for her own safety. One of her daughters, however, had heard about meand brought her for more testing. “One more try,” she told me. “You are our lasthope.” When I first met Matilda I thought she had Alzheimer’s disease too, butthe results of her scan suggested otherwise. She had good activity in the areasusually affected by Alzheimer’s. Her scan was more consistent with depression.Sometimes in the elderly it can be hard to distinguish Alzheimer’s disease fromdepression. Based on her scan I put Matilda on the antidepressant Wellbutrin.Within three weeks Matilda came out of the fog she had been in. Her memory wasbetter and she became more talkative. After a month she asked if I would writethe DMV to help her get her driver’s license back. I told her, “Matilda, I driveon the same highways you drive. I need you to take your medicine and do theother things we discussed. If in six months you are still better and your scanis better, then I will write the DMV.”Six months later she remained better, her scan had improved, and I wrote theDMV!Natural Supplement Strategies for Each TypeIn this section I will reexamine each type of anxiety and depression and providemore details about the supplements that I have seen to have clinical benefit.I’ll give you the rationale and dosage protocols that I suggest to my patients.Some of these I have discussed in the last chapter and will refer you there ifthe information is repeated. As I mentioned in chapter 6, if you decide to usethese supplements instead of medication, as many people do, make sure you keeptabs on their effectiveness and inform your health care professional about whatyou are taking. I only want my patients to take something that is clearlybeneficial to them. I also want them to take medication if the supplements arenot effective. Many patients say that they want to try the natural supplementsbefore they try medication. That’s okay, but if the supplements are not fullyeffective, they should pursue more effective treatments, including medication.Anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder can be potentially very harmful whenleft untreated or inappropriately treated. Follow through to find out what worksbest for yourself or your child.TYPE 1: PURE ANXIETYFor this type of anxiety, GABA, B6, L-glutamine, kava kava, or valerian may behelpful. I discussed GABA in the last chapter but include more information hereas well.GABAA search of the medical literature on GABA supplementation found only twostudies for anxiety and depression. Of the two studies, both were positive. Inmy experience, GABA can have a calming effect on anxiety and irritability, andcan help with sleep.GABA is an amino acid that also functions as a neurotransmitter in the brain.GABA is reported in the herbal literature to work in much the same way as theantianxiety drugs and the anticonvulsants. It helps stabilize nerve cells bydecreasing their tendency to fire erratically or excessively. This means it mayhave a calming effect for people who struggle with temper, irritability, andanxiety, whether these symptoms relate to anxiety or to temporal lobedisturbance. Natural therapies that produce relaxation also act, at least inpart, by enhancing GABA levels. A controlled pilot study found brain GABA levelswere significantly increased after a single sixty-minute yoga session comparedwith a sixty-minute reading session.The effect of orally administrated GABA on relaxation and immunity during stresshas been studied in humans. One study evaluated the effect of GABA intake on thebrain wave patterns of thirteen subjects. Electroencephalograms were obtainedafter three tests on each volunteer as follows: water as only intake, GABA, orL-theanine. After sixty minutes, GABA significantly increased alpha waves(calming brain waves) and decreased beta waves compared with water orL-theanine. These findings suggest that GABA not only induces relaxation butalso reduces anxiety. In another study evaluating the effect of GABA on anxietyand immunity, eight people who were afraid of heights were divided into twogroups (placebo and GABA). All acrophobics were crossing a suspended bridge as away to induce stress. Immune response was measured by sampling immunoglobulin A(IgA) levels in their saliva while crossing the bridge. The placebo group showedmarked decreases of their IgA levels, while the GABA group showed significantlyhigher levels. The authors of this study concluded that GABA could workeffectively as a natural relaxant and its effects could be seen within one hourof its administration to induce relaxation and diminish anxiety. Moreover, GABAadministration could enhance immunity under stress conditions.GABA can be taken as a supplement in doses ranging from 250 milligrams–1,500milligrams daily for adults and from 125 milligrams–750 milligrams daily forchildren. For best effect, GABA should be taken in two to three divided doses.VITAMIN B6 AND L-GLUTAMINEVitamin B6 supports the action of the enzymes that convert the amino acidL-glutamine to GABA in the brain. Anxious people may not have enough L-glutamineor they may have vitamin B6 deficiencies, which render them deficient in thebuilding blocks necessary for GABA production. GABA is one of theamino-acid-based neurotransmitters with inhibitory properties and decreases therate of nerve cell firing. The recommended dose is 500 milligrams of L-glutaminethree to four times daily between meals and 50–100 milligrams of vitamin B6twice daily. A cautionary note: excessive doses of vitamin B6 may cause nervedamage that is usually reversible when vitamin B6 is stopped.KAVA KAVAA search of the medical literature on kava kava supplementation found seventeenstudies for anxiety and insomnia on approximately fourteen hundred patients. Ofthe seventeen studies, fifteen were positive. In my experience kava kava canhave a calming effect on anxiety and irritability and can also help with sleep.Several years ago I went through a painful time of grief, where for the firsttime in my life I experienced panic attacks and trouble sleeping. Of all thesupplements I tried, kava kava helped me the most. Kava kava is recommended bysome alternative medicine practitioners to calm anxiety, promote healthy sleep,and reduce the physical and emotional effects of stress. Kava kava is thought towork by enhancing the production of GABA in the brain. It comes from the root ofa South Pacific pepper tree and is commonly used as a social and ceremonialdrink in the Pacific Islands. The herb is so widely used that it is thought tobe, in part, responsible for the laid-back lifestyle of the islands. My patientshave reported the following relief after taking kava kava: being relaxed withoutfeeling drugged; having less muscle tension; and feeling a sense of peace andcontentment, increased sociability, and initial alertness followed by a feelingof drowsiness. Do not take kava kava if you are going to drive.Kava kava is not the type of supplement, like fish oil, that you should takeevery day. At most, use it for three weeks and then take a week off. Kava kavause on a daily basis may harm the liver. Kava kava has known interactions withalcohol; barbiturates; monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants;benzodiazepines; other tranquilizers and sleeping pills; anticoagulants;antiplatelet agents including aspirin, antipsychotics, and drugs used fortreating Parkinson’s disease; and drugs that suppress the central nervoussystem. Kava kava can exacerbate Parkinson’s disease and increase muscleweakness and twitching. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should not takekava kava.Standardized dosage is 150–300 milligrams, one to three times daily as neededfor anxiety or nervousness, standardized to contain 30–70 percent kavalactones.Most clinical trials have used the German kava kava extract WS 1490. It may takefour weeks before you notice improvement. Kava kava should not be taken for morethan three months without a two-week rest period.VALERIANA search of the medical literature on valerian supplementation found ten studiesfor anxiety and insomnia. Of the ten studies, six were positive and four werenegative. In my experience, valerian can be a useful sleep aid.Many patients find valerian to be remarkably helpful as a sleeping aid. It is awell-recognized herb with antianxiety properties that is used as a mildtranquilizer, sedative, and muscle relaxant. There are about 150 species ofvalerian widely distributed in temperate regions of the world. The activeingredient is found in a foul-smelling oil produced in the root of the plant.The Roman physician Galen wrote about the virtues of valerian, it has beenassociated with the term all heal in medical literature of the Middle Ages, andit is also used in Chinese and Indian medicine. It was used in the United Statesprior to the development of modern pharmaceuticals. This centuries-old treatmentfor insomnia has also been helpful for symptoms of nervousness, stress,increased emotional reactivity, pain, and agitation, and it also appears todecrease seizure frequency for epileptic patients. Valerian seems to work byenhancing the activity of the calming neurotransmitter, GABA. Studies have shownvalerian to be helpful for many types of anxiety disorders and for people withperformance anxiety and those who get stressed in daily situations like traffic.Valerian is available in capsules, tablets, liquids, tinctures, extracts, andteas. Most extracts are standardized to 0.8 percent valeric acids. Unlikeprescription tranquilizers, valerian has a much lower potential for addictionand has been used to help people who are trying to decrease their use ofprescription tranquilizers or sleeping pills. (Anyone using prescriptionsleeping pills or tranquilizers should decrease or stop their use only under thesupervision of a physician.) Sometimes valerian can cause nervousness ordrowsiness, so make sure you know how your body reacts to it before you drive ordo other activities that require sustained attention. Do not take valerian withalcohol, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines. Valerian is not recommended for useduring pregnancy or breast-feeding. The recommended dose of valerian is 150–450milligrams in capsules or teas.TYPE 2: PURE DEPRESSIONI use SAMe, which was discussed in chapter 6 (see Chapter 6).TYPE 3: MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIONI use a combination of the treatments in Types 1 and 2. So I may use SAMe(Chapter 6) plus GABA (see Chapter 6).TYPE 4: OVERFOCUSED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIONI use supplements that boost serotonin availability in the brain, such as St.John’s wort (see Chapter 6), 5-HTP (see Chapter 6), or inositol.INOSITOLA search of the medical literature on inositol supplementation found sixteenstudies for a wide range of problems, including depression, obsessive-compulsivedisorder, panic disorder, ADHD, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, binge-eatingdisorder, schizophrenia, and antidepressant augmentation. The results suggestthat inositol has therapeutic effects in the spectrum of illness responsive toserotonin-enhancing medication, including depression, panic disorder, andobsessive-compulsive disorder and is not beneficial in schizophrenia,Alzheimer’s ADHD, or autism.Inositol is a natural biochemical found normally in the human brain. Somescientists think it is a member of the B vitamin family. It is reported to helpneurons more efficiently use the neurotransmitter serotonin. In a well-designedstudy of thirteen patients who suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder, 18grams of inositol compared with placebo significantly reduced symptoms. Spinalfluid inositol has been reported to be low in depression. Another well-designedstudy of 12 grams of inositol in twenty-eight depressed patients showedimpressive improvement when compared with sugar pills. Since manyantidepressants are effective in patients with panic disorder, twenty-onepatients with this severe anxiety disorder were given 12 grams on inositol perday for four weeks. Compared with placebo, inositol was more effective withminimal side effects. Studies on inositol were not effective for all conditions.For example, it did not help schizophrenia, ADD, or Alzheimer’s disease. By itsactions and the conditions it helps, inositol seems to act like mild Prozac,though with fewer of the side effects. Think of trying it if you are a worrier,have trouble letting go of negative thoughts, tend to be rigid or inflexible, orhold grudges. The dose is up to 18 grams a day.Do not take St. John’s wort, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, or inositol with prescribedantidepressants, unless under the close supervision of your physician.TYPE 5: TEMPORAL LOBE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIONThe supplements used to treat this type include GABA (see Chapter 6) and fishoil, discussed in the last chapter (see this chapter). A higher protein, lowercarbohydrate diet may also be helpful. Eight studies from Johns Hopkinsresearchers found that a ketogenic diet (very low carb) significantly reducedseizure frequencies in children with epilepsy. Many physicians believe thatsugar is both pro-inflammatory and pro-epileptic. This kind of diet is worth atry for this type.TYPE 6: CYCLIC ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIONAs I said for severe bipolar disorder, I often think that medication isimportant. Having stated that, many of my patients do not want to take lithium,anticonvulsant medication, or antipsychotic medication. One dentist I treatedhad clear bipolar disorder, where he didn’t need to sleep; had racing thoughts;and became hypersexual, hyperreligious, and spent vast sums amount of money hedidn’t have. He felt terrible on lithium and wanted to try natural treatmentsexclusively. To my surprise he responded to high-dose fish oil at 10 grams aday. I think all of my bipolar patients should take fish oil. In addition I alsothink some bipolar patients may benefit from a ketogenic diet, as it hasantiseizure qualities and we use anticonvulsants to treat bipolar disorder.Another type of cyclic anxiety and depression is seasonal affective disorder, orwinter blues. Prozac has been found in some studies to be effective; in otherstudies, bright light therapy has been found to be even more effective, as hasvitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D deficiencies are becoming more commonacross North America. It is associated with both depression and pain syndromes.Vitamin D is made in our skin from sun exposure, but because we exercise lessoutdoors and use sunscreen, many people even in sunny climates are deficient invitamin D. I recommend that my patients test their 25-hydroxy vitamin D levelsand, if found to be low, take a vitamin D3 supplement or walk in the sun everyday for at least twenty minutes without sunscreen.TYPE 7: UNFOCUSED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIONThe supplement for Type 7 is SAMe (see Chapter 6). This type is associated withoverall low activity in the brain. Another natural treatment I may recommend ifthere has been an infection, brain trauma, or environmental toxic exposure ishyperbaric oxygen treatment, which has been found on SPECT scans to boostoverall blood flow to the brain.Knowing the type of anxiety and depression you have is critical to getting thebest help. One treatment does not fit everyone and I have found thistype-specific approach to be the most clinically effective way to think aboutand treat anxiety and depression."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_031_r1.jpg]Natural Ways to Healimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]MEMORY DISORDERS, INSOMNIA, AND PAINIn this chapter I will discuss natural treatments for memory problems andinsomnia, two very common causes that impair a magnificent mind. These disordersare increasing at alarming rates. Alzheimer’s disease is expected to triple by2050, and nearly sixty million Americans have significant sleep problems.Memory ProblemsMemory problems are typically considered an issue for the elderly. In myexperience as both a child and adult psychiatrist, however, I have seen memoryproblems across the life span. They commonly appear in children with learningdisorders, in teens who are using marijuana, adults with depression andsubstance abuse problems, and in the cognitive decline that occurs with agingand many forms of dementia. Memory is housed in a number of different areas ofthe brain, especially the prefrontal cortex, which is thought to be involvedwith short-term memory, and the hippocampus in the temporal lobes, which arestructures critical to getting memories into long-term storage. In assessingmemory problems it is important to consider the following.• Medical causes, such as low thyroid or B12 deficiencies• Medications that interfere with memory such as antianxiety medicines likeXanax or painkillers like OxyContin• Brain illnesses, such as depression or ADD• Early stages of Alzheimer’s disease• Excessive stress (stress hormones have been found to kill cells in thehippocampus)• Lack of sleep, sleep apnea• Postanesthesia (some people react negative to general anesthesia and complainof subsequent memory problems)• Environmental toxins, such as finishing furniture or painting your car in aclosed garage• Drug and alcohol abuseOf course, the first step in enhancing memory is to fix any of the problemslisted above if possible. There are a number of important supplements that havebeen shown to be helpful in enhancing memory, including gingko biloba,phosphatidylserine, vinpocetine, and huperzine A. Medications that have beenfound to help memory include Namenda, Aricept, Exelon, and Reminyl.GINGKO BILOBAThe prettiest brains I have seen are those on gingko. Gingko biloba, from theChinese gingko tree, is a powerful antioxidant that is best known for itsability to enhance circulation, memory, and concentration. The best-studied formof gingko biloba is a special extract called EGB 761. It will be best if this isthe form you use. EGB 761 has been studied in blood vessel disease, clottingdisorders, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. A comparison in 2000 of all thepublished, placebo-controlled studies longer than six months for the gingkobiloba extract EGB 761 versus Cognex, Aricept, and Exelon showed they all hadsimilar benefits for mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease patients.The most widely publicized study in the United States of gingko biloba was doneby Dr. P. L. Le Bars and colleagues from the New York Institute for MedicalResearch, which appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association in1997. EGB 761 was used to assess the efficacy and safety in Alzheimer’s diseaseand vascular dementia. This fifty-two-week multicenter study was conducted withpatients who had mild to severe symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned totreatment with EGB 761 (120 milligrams a day) or placebo. Progress was monitoredat twelve, twenty-six, and fifty-two weeks, and 202 patients finished the study.At the end of the study the authors concluded that EGB was safe and appearscapable of stabilizing and, in a substantial number of cases, improving thecognitive performance and the social functioning of demented patients for sixmonths to one year. Although modest, the changes induced by EGB were objectivelymeasured and were of sufficient magnitude to be recognized by the caregivers.Consider taking gingko if you are at risk for memory problems or stroke orsuffer from low energy or decreased concentration. The usual effective dose is60 to 120 milligrams twice a day. There is a small risk of bleeding in the body,and the dosages of other blood thinning agents being taken may sometimes need tobe reduced.PHOSPHATIDYLSERINEPhosphatidylserine (PS) is a naturally occurring nutrient that is found in foodssuch as fish, green leafy vegetables, soy products, and rice. PS is a componentof cell membranes. There are reports of the potential of PS to help improveage-related declines in memory, learning, verbal skills, and concentration.Positron emission tomography studies of patients who have taken PS show that itproduces a general increase in metabolic activity in the brain. In the largestmulticenter study to date of phosphatidylserine and Alzheimer’s disease, 142subjects ages 40–80 were given 200 milligrams of PS per day or placebo over athree-month period. Those treated with PS exhibited improvement on several itemson the scales normally used to assess Alzheimer’s status. The differencesbetween placebo and experimental groups were small but statisticallysignificant. Effective doses of PS have been reported to be 300 milligrams perday. The types of symptoms that have improved in placebo-controlled studies ofcognitive impairment or dementia include loss of interest, reduced activities,social isolation, anxiety, memory, concentration, and recall. Milder stages ofimpairment tend to respond to PS better than more severe stages. With regard todepression in elderly individuals, Dr. M. Maggioni and colleagues studied theeffects of oral PS (300 milligrams per day) versus placebo and noted significantimprovements in mood, memory, and motivation after thirty days of PS treatment.The typical dose of PS is 100–300 milligrams a day.VINPOCETINEVinpocetine has been shown in a number of studies to help memory, especially forpeople who are at risk for heart disease or stroke. It also helps lower highhomocysteine levels, which are also dangerous to your heart and brain.Vinpocetine is derived from an extract of the common periwinkle plant (Vincaminor) and is used in Europe, Japan, and Mexico as a pharmaceutical agent forthe treatment of blood vessel disease in the brain and cognitive disorders. Inthe United States it is available as a dietary supplement. It is sometimescalled a nootropic, meaning “cognition enhancer,” from the Greek noos for“mind.” Vinpocetine selectively widens arteries and capillaries, increasingblood flow to the brain. It also combats accumulation of platelets in the blood,improving circulation. Because of these properties, vinpocetine was first usedin the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders and acute memory loss owing tolate-life dementia. But it also has a beneficial effect upon memory problemsassociated with normal aging.There is evidence that vinpocetine may be useful for a wide variety of brainproblems. A 1976 study found that vinpocetine immediately increased circulationin fifty people with abnormal blood flow. After one month of taking moderatedoses of vinpocetine, patients showed improvement on memorization tests. After aprolonged period of vinpocetine treatment, cognitive impairment diminishedsignificantly or disappeared altogether in many of the patients. A 1987 study ofelderly patients with chronic cerebral dysfunction found patients who tookvinpocetine performed better on psychological evaluations after the ninety-daytrial period than did those who received a placebo. More recent studies haveshown that vinpocetine reduces neural damage and protects against oxidativedamage from harmful beta-amyloid buildup. In a multicenter, double-blind,placebo-controlled study lasting sixteen weeks, 203 patients described as havingmild to moderate memory problems, including primary dementia, were treated withvarying doses of vinpocetine or placebo. Significant improvement was achieved inthe vinpocetine-treated group as measured by “global improvement” and cognitiveperformance scales. Three 10-milligram doses daily were as effective or moreeffective than three 20-milligram doses daily. Similarly good results were foundin another double-blind clinical trial testing vinpocetine versus placebo inelderly patients with blood vessel and central nervous system degenerativedisorders. Some preliminary research suggests that vinpocetine may also havesome protective effects in both sight and hearing.Reported adverse reactions include nausea, dizziness, insomnia, drowsiness, drymouth, transient hypotension, transient fast heart rate, pressure headaches, andfacial flushing. Slight reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressurewith prolonged use of vinpocetine have been reported, as well as slightreductions in blood sugar levels.The usual dosage is 10 milligrams a day.HUPERZINE AHuperzine A is a remarkable compound that has been studied in China for nearlytwenty years. It appears to work by increasing the availability ofacetylcholine, a major memory neurotransmitter in the brain, and preventing celldamage from excitotoxins. It has been shown to be effective in improvingpatients who suffered with cognitive impairment from several different types ofdementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. Huperzine A hasalso been shown effective to help learning and memory in teenagers. Researchersdivided thirty-four pairs of junior high school students complaining of memoryproblems into a huperzine A and placebo control group. The huperzine A group wasgiven two 50-microgram capsules of huperzine A twice a day, while the placebogroup was given two capsules of placebo (starch and lactose inside) twice a dayfor four weeks. At the end of trial, the huperzine A group’s memory abilitieswere significantly superior to that of the placebo group.The usual dosage is 50–100 micrograms twice a day.InsomniaSleep plays an important role in the formation of memory and normal learningactivities. Sleep problems disrupt your energy; interfere with performance atwork or school; negatively impact relationships; and compound the symptoms ofADD, anxiety, and depression. People may suffer from trouble falling asleep,frequent awakenings during the night, or waking up too early and having troublegetting back to sleep. Sleep disorders can occur transiently in response to astress, be a chronic problem, or occur in cycles. These patterns are sometimeshelpful in diagnosing the underlying problem. For example, people who haveperiods where they do not need more than a few hours of sleep at night combinedwith increased energy levels and mood may indicate the presence of bipolarillness. People who have early morning awakenings and morning fatigue withbetter energy as the day goes on may have a form of depression.Insomnia is one of the most common complaints in medical practices. The numberof adults in America affected may exceed sixty million. Patients have manydifferent opinions about what constitutes insomnia and many people who believethey are not sleeping enough are discovered to be sleeping more than the averageperson when evaluated by a sleep laboratory. Others who complain of insomniadon’t realize that they are unintentionally doing something that disrupts theirnatural sleep cycle. For example, they may be drinking caffeine, eating sugarlate in the day, drinking alcohol or smoking, taking naps during the day,exercising vigorously late in the evening, or staying up very late into theevening, all of which disrupt sleep cycles. Untreated medical and psychiatricillnesses and some medications also disturb sleep.Transient insomnia is something that we all have experienced. Some of the mostcommon causes of transient insomnia are jet lag, minor stress or excitement,shift work, and trying to sleep in a new environment. This kind of acuteinsomnia usually goes away on its own or when the stress is resolved. Herbalteas; self-relaxation; and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, evening exercise at leastfour hours before bedtime also help.Chronic insomnia is more difficult to diagnose and to treat. By far, the mostcommon reason people develop chronic insomnia is another underlying conditionthat disturbs their sleep cycle. Doctors have to spend time trying to sort outwhether or not a patient has secondary insomnia and, if so, what is causing it.Here is a list of some of the conditions that may cause chronic insomnia:• Medications. Many medications, including asthma medications, anti-histamines,cough medicines, anticonvulsants, and many others, disturb sleep.• Caffeine. Coffee, tea, chocolate, and some herbal preparations containcaffeine and will disrupt sleep.• Alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana. Although these compounds initially promotesleep for some people, as they wear off, they have the reverse effect.• Restless legs syndrome. This jerking motion of the legs or pedaling motion candrive a person’s bed partner crazy (as well as the person who has it).• Pregnancy, PMS, menopause, and perimenopause. During many of these hormonaltransition times, a woman’s sleep cycle may be disrupted every few minutes.• Thyroid conditions. Too much thyroid activity can cause people to feel revvedtoo high.• Congestive heart failure. This can cause trouble breathing.• Chronic pain conditions. Pain can keep a person awake.• Untreated or undertreated psychiatric conditions. Conditions such asobsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or anxiety will disrupt sleeppatterns if left untreated.• Alzheimer’s disease. Dementia patients often “sundown” or rev up at night andwander.• Chronic gastrointestinal problems. Reflux causes pain and discomfort.• Benign prostatic hypertrophy. This condition causes many trips to the bathroomat night, disrupting a full night’s sleep.• Snoring and sleep apnea, which are more common in men than in women, canadversely affect both bed partners’ sleep.After all other reasons for insomnia have been ruled out or excluded a patientcan be diagnosed with primary insomnia. A doctor may also decide to send herpatient to a sleep disorders laboratory for observation of their sleep cycle.Sleep labs are able to monitor patients with overnight polysomnography and othertests that provide information about a patient’s heart rate, breathing rate,oxygen levels, leg movements, brain waves, and eye movements during their sleepcycle. The results of these tests help make the diagnosis of sleep apnea,insomnia, and restless legs syndrome.TREATMENTAcute or transient insomnia usually responds to the practice of good sleephabits (see the section Steps to Get a Good Night’s Sleep Naturally on Chapter8). Sometimes the practice of good sleep habits is not enough, as may be thecase for some shift workers who are unable to reset their sleep cycles on demandor for people experiencing grief reactions and who may suffer from insomnia fora few weeks to a few months during the acute grief phase. People who arehospitalized are another example of those for whom the practice of good sleephabits is not enough. In these and other cases, I prescribe supplements, such asvalerian, kava kava, melatonin, or medication, such as Ambien, Lunesta, orDesyrel on a short-term basis. Chronic insomnia requires a complex approach totreatment. Any underlying cause of chronic insomnia must be identified andtreated. It is most often caused by other underlying conditions, and of these,depression and anxiety, substance abuse, psychological stress, and medicationside effects top the list.Patients who have difficulty getting to sleep frequently complain that thoughtskeep them up at night. Sometimes they are anxious and therefore worry at nightor obsess about problems. Other times, people say they feel fine but just can’tturn off their mind and quit thinking. Nighttime thinkers often benefit from atechnique called imagery distraction. Imagery distraction is an elaborate andinteresting mental image developed and focused on at bedtime in order todistract the insomniac from the other thoughts that keep them awake. Patientswho practice this technique fall asleep more quickly and easily than those whodon’t. Self-hypnosis and other relaxation techniques such as progressiverelaxation, deep breathing, and meditation also help.Natural interventions may be helpful for either acute or chronic insomnia. Forsome people, 400–900 milligrams of valerian root improves sleep. It also hasmild anxiety-reducing and muscle-relaxing effects. Results of severaldouble-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving valerian for the treatment ofinsomnia showed that patients report improvement in the quality of their sleepand a decrease in the length of time it took for them to fall asleep when theyused valerian. The benefits appeared to increase after several days of use.Higher doses of valerian were associated with reports of morning sedation.MELATONINMelatonin is a hormone made in the brain that helps regulate other hormones andmaintains the body’s sleep cycle. Darkness stimulates the production ofmelatonin while light decreases its activity. Exposure to too much light in theevening or too little light during the day can disrupt the production ofmelatonin. Jet lag, shift work, and poor vision are some of the conditions thatcan disrupt melatonin production. Some researchers think that being exposed tolow-frequency electromagnetic fields (from common household appliances) maydisrupt melatonin levels. Melatonin is involved in the production of femalehormones and influences menstrual cycles. Researchers also consider melatoninlevels to be involved in aging. Children have the highest levels of melatonin,which diminish with age. The lower levels of melatonin may help explain whyolder adults generally need less sleep. Melatonin is a strong antioxidant, andthere is some evidence that it may help strengthen the immune system.Research suggests that taking melatonin may help sleep patterns in shift workersor those with poor vision. One study found that melatonin helps prevent jet lag,particularly in people who cross five or more time zones. Melatonin is moreeffective than placebo in decreasing the time required to fall asleep,increasing the number of hours sleeping and improving alertness. Melatonin maybe helpful for children with learning disabilities who suffer from insomnia. Onestudy of postmenopausal women found that melatonin improved depression andanxiety. Studies of people with depression and panic disorder have shown lowlevels of melatonin. People who suffer winter blues or seasonal affectivedisorder also have lower than normal melatonin levels. Melatonin causes a surgein the neurotransmitter serotonin, which may help explain why it is helpful inboth sleep and depression. Although taking melatonin does not help the primarysymptoms of ADD, it does seem to help the sleep disturbances common in thesechildren.The best approach for dosing melatonin is to begin with very low doses. Inchildren start with 0.3 milligrams per day, always at bedtime, and raise itslowly. In adults start with 1 milligram an hour before bedtime. You canincrease it to 6 milligrams.Steps to Get a Good Night’s Sleep Naturally• Get stimulants out of your system well before bedtime. If you take a stimulantfor ADD or any other condition, try to take your last dose by early afternoon soit wears off before bedtime. Sometimes people with hyperactivity actuallybenefit from a stimulant before bedtime to calm them down so they can sleep.Stimulating antidepressants like Wellbutrin may need to be taken before 4 P.M.as well. Nicotine should be eliminated and caffeine should not be consumed forsix to eight hours before bedtime. Caffeine is found in many foods includingteas, coffee, and chocolate.• Don’t take naps! This is one of the biggest mistakes people with insomniamake. They feel tired during the day, take naps, and thereby compound theirnighttime sleep cycle disruption.• Exercise during the day is very beneficial for insomnia. However, it should beat least four hours before bedtime. Vigorous exercise late in the evening oftenenergizes people and keeps them awake.• Alcohol, pain medication, and marijuana also disrupt sleep. These compoundsmay cause initial drowsiness, but as the body metabolizes them, they interruptsleep. Avoid trying to fall asleep using these drugs.• Plan for transition time. Almost everyone needs time to relax and unwindbefore going to sleep. Put aside busy or intense work and focus on calmingactivities before lying down.• Don’t use your bed for anything other than sexual activity or sleeping. If youcan’t sleep and are not engaged in sexual or sensual contact with your partner,get out of bed. Do not work, watch TV, read, write, or lie around awake in bed.• Move the clock. Clock watching and trying too hard to go to sleep will causemore anxiety and aggravate your problem.• Establish a regular sleeping schedule and stay on it, even on weekends.Changing sleep patterns by staying up too late or oversleeping on weekends isenough to trigger cycle disruptions in sensitive people.• Pay attention to your environment. Your bedroom should be comfortable. Controlthe temperature and light.• Reading might help you fall asleep but don’t read anything too exciting,scary, or anxiety provoking. This applies to TV watching as well.• A mixture of warm milk, a tablespoon of vanilla (not imitation vanilla, thereal stuff), and a tablespoon of sugar can be very helpful. This increasesserotonin to your brain and helps you sleep.• If sugar makes you jittery, gives you an energy boost, or if you have ADD, youneed to avoid it beginning in the afternoon. You should avoid starches as well,as they turn to sugar after you eat them.• Sound therapy can induce a very peaceful mood and help relaxation. Some peoplelike nature sounds; others prefer soft music, wind chimes, or even fans. Ourclinic makes a sleep tape with a special sound machine that produces sound wavesat the same frequency as a sleeping brain. The tape is played at bedtime andhelps the brain “tune in” to a brain wave sleep state, which encourages apeaceful sleep.• Sexual activity releases many natural hormones, releases muscle tension, andboosts people’s sense of well-being. People with healthy sex lives usually sleepbetter.• Meditation, massage, and warm baths are also very relaxing.I also help my patients using hypnosis and teaching them self-hypnosis. When Iwas an intern at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., manyof my patients wanted sleeping pills. As you can imagine, it was hard to sleepin a busy, noisy medical center. Before I gave them sleeping pills, however, Iasked if I could hypnotize them first to see if that would help. Almost all ofthem agreed. My first professional papers came from using hypnosis for sleep.One of my patients, a decorated World War II hero, had advanced Parkinson’sdisease, and in a hypnotic trance his tremor went away. When I told my attendingneurologist about it the next morning, he thought I was crazy. So I repeated theexercise in front of him and it became my first professional paper. When I didthis for an army chaplain who was in the hospital with a heart arrhythmia, hisheart rhythm normalized. When I told my attending cardiologist about whathappened the next morning, he thought I was nuts, so I repeated the exercise infront of him and it became my second professional paper. Hypnosis andself-hypnosis are very powerful tools to help gain mastery over your own mindand can be helpful for sleep and other things as well. You can obtain a hypnoticaudiotape from the Amen Clinics’ website or go to a trained hypnotherapist. Sleep is critical. Use the techniques listed here to help. Be persistent. If onetechnique doesn’t work for you, don’t give up. Try others.PainPain is one of the most difficult and debilitating symptoms that people suffer.Chronic pain affects everything in a negative way, such as sleep, mood, memory,and concentration. Our scans have taught me that the use of chronic painmedications, such as Vicodin or OxyContin, is harmful to brain function.Long-term use of these medications makes the brain look like people who drinktoo much.Looking at these scans caused me to develop an interest in alternativetreatments for pain that did not leave a toxic effect, such as fish oil,acupuncture, music therapy, and hypnosis.From a psychiatrist’s standpoint, I have also learned that pain and depressiontend to go hand in hand. And that using some antidepressant medications, such asCymbalta, or antidepressant natural supplements, such as SAMe, can be veryhelpful for some pain syndromes.Another issue that came up through looking at scans is that sometimes a person’sbrain can get stuck on the pain.Sam was admitted to the hospital after a suicide attempt. He was a policeofficer who had been in a car accident chasing a criminal. He had six backsurgeries and was tired of living in pain. When I scanned his brain I found toomuch activity in the front part of his brain. This is the same pattern we oftensee with people who have obsessive-compulsive disorder or people who get stuckon negative thoughts or negative behaviors. Based on the scan I put him on thesupplement 5-HTP that boosts serotonin to calm down this part of the brain, inaddition to fish oil. A month later he told me that he felt much better. “Istill hurt,” he said, “but I don’t think about the pain all the time.”Again, there are many natural ways to help the brain. Of course, you should talkto your doctor. If he or she does not know much about natural supplements, asmany of us were never taught about them in school, sometimes a naturopath, anutritionist, or a chiropractor may have information to help you.One other thought on pain: try getting rid of all of the artificial sweetenersin your diet. When I was thirty-seven I had arthritis. My knees, hands, andfingers hurt a lot. I had trouble getting up off the floor after sitting for awhile. As part of developing a brain-healthy life, I got rid of the diet sodas.Within a month, my pain went away. I don’t think artificial sweeteners do thatto everyone, but if you hurt, it might be something to consider."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_032_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_033_r1.jpg]Ignite Your Passionimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]LIGHT UP THE BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT DRIVE SUCCESSPassion, it lies in all of us, sleeping…waiting…and though unwanted…unbidden…itwill stir…open its jaws and howl. It speaks to us…guides us…passion rules usall, and we obey. What other choice do we have? Passion is the source of ourfinest moments. The joy of love…the clarity of hatred…and the ecstasy of grief.It hurts sometimes more than we can bear. If we could live without passion maybewe’d know some kind of peace…but we would be hollow…Empty rooms shuttered and dank. Without passion we’d be truly dead.—JOSH WHEDON, American screenwriter and producerPassionate living is the soul of success and the hallmark of a magnificent mind.Without passion, little of consequence happens. Passion sparks the chemicalfactories deep in the brain, lighting the emotional fires that turn us on. Weknow when we have passion, because it drives us to love, care, want, need,crave, have to have, suffer, and create. Passion is the force behind themomentum of our lives, which can be loving or hateful, money driven orcharitable, magnanimous or grudging. Passion can provide the stimulus forbecoming a candidate for Congress or an admired gardener. Passion causes us towork a hundred hours a week building a business or it can keep us studying intoour thirties to become a trauma surgeon. Passion may motivate some to travelhundreds or even thousands of miles each week to be in the arms of a new love orit may push others to train relentlessly for the Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii.Passion gives meaning and purpose to our lives. A magnificent mind requiresdirected passion, whether in raising healthy children, making a marriageamazing, thriving in your profession, or excelling at a hobby.In the Merriam-Webster’s dictionary the first definition of passion is tosuffer. Do you love what you do so much so that you are willing to suffer forit? If so, you have passion. I love the brain SPECT imaging work that we do atthe Amen Clinics. It is clearly one of my passions, lasting more than eighteenyears. It grabbed my attention from the moment I ordered the first scan. Ourwork has given me tremendous joy, but I have also taken consistent, long-termgrief from some of my colleagues for doing it. In the early years I was calledeverything from a snake oil salesman, quack, huckster, and a fraud. In 1997,after a complaint filed by one of my colleagues, I was investigated by theCalifornia Medical Board for a year for doing the imaging work in my clinic. Ifyou do anything outside the standard of care in the medical community, the boardcan take away your license to practice medicine. Psychiatrists doing brainimaging work at the time was new and not part of the standard of care.Ultimately the medical board absolved me, and for a while I became one of itsconsultants, but it was one of the most anxiety-filled, emotionally painfulyears of my life. But it was my passion for the work that helped me stay thecourse, even in times of turmoil. Soon, it will be grounds for malpractice notto order brain scans in complex psychiatric cases. If I did not have passion forthe imaging work, I would have given up the idea at the first sign of trouble orcriticism. That would have left me as a mediocre doctor, allowing the opinionsof others to run my practice and my life. Changing paradigms require passion.Where does true passion originate? Is it in the brain, mind, society, spirit, ora combination? Why do some people have it, pushing the limits of their lives,while others are stuck in a rut of boredom and mediocrity, allowing others todirect their lives? Why does passion often get out of control and ruin lives?Can Parkinson’s disease, ADHD, and addictions teach us anything about passion?Are there brain-based secrets to boosting passionate living? This chapter willexplore these questions and help you develop the passion that feeds amagnificent mind.Understanding the Seeds of PassionAs mentioned earlier, one of the most helpful concepts I learned in medicalschool was to always evaluate patients from abiological-psychological-social-spiritual perspective. In this model, we look atthe underlying biology or physiology, psychology or mind-set, social situationor group setting, and the deeper spiritual meaning of patients’ lives. Byexamining each of these areas you are less likely to miss important information,plus as a physician, you are not just eliminating symptoms or treating diseasestates, but you are nurturing and healing whole people.It is essential in understanding passion and motivation to take abiological-psychological-social-spiritual approach and look at issues related tomind (psychology), social situation (the present moment and the groups we livein), spirit (our conscience, inner sense of knowing, and deepest sense ofmeaning and purpose), and biology (the physical functioning of the brain).The Mind of PassionThe mind of passion is often influenced by significant past life events, such asthe following.• Having a mother who loved to read to you, so you developed a passion for books• Having grown up in poverty and hating it so much that you developed a passionfor security and money• Having a lot of men give you attention for the way your body looked, so youdeveloped a passion for working out (and maybe a subsequent eating disorder, anexample of passion gone wrong)• Having a parent be struck with Alzheimer’s disease, so you developed a passionto prevent the illness in yourself and those you love• Meeting a partner who unconsciously reminds you of a beloved parent, so youdevelop a passion for the relationship• Having a child die of cancer, so you subsequently develop a passion to raisemoney for cancer researchThere are many ways our past experiences influence our passions and drivestoday, from the relationships we had with our parents, coaches, teachers, andfriends growing up, to the experiences we had with the sports we played or thehobbies we pursued, to our earliest sexual turn-ons, to our biggest fears andgreatest joys. The factors that turned us on or off during our formative yearscontinue to pervade and influence our lives. Significant emotional eventsimprinted memory traces that change the brain. If powerful enough, they canstill influence your thoughts and feelings. For example, when I was in sixthgrade, I performed my first comedic scene as a young Yiddish mother trying toget her toddler to eat a bowl of soup. The class laughed at just the rightmoments. At the end of my routine I had a warm, glowing feeling inside. Itprimed the pump for my desire to perform in front of others, which in turnencouraged me to be on the speech team in college, which in turn, primed mefurther to love presenting to groups today. As I was writing this book, I wasinvited to speak in front of nine thousand people in Monterrey, Mexico, at theWorld Conference of Spirituality, Knowledge and Integral Health in a huge arena.The experience lit up the same brain circuits primed in sixth grade.Below is an account from one of my patients that shows how life experience candrive passion. Roger, a successful businessman, helped start a nonprofit agencythat funds SPECT scans, evaluations, and treatment for people who cannot affordit, especially those who have ADD. Roger and the agency he helped to start,Recovery Assistance Foundation, have changed the lives of hundreds of people.One of my passions is to help people with ADD. It originates from my lifeexperiences, values, and compassion for those who are suffering when help isavailable. It began with our hyperactive son who was diagnosed in the firstgrade with ADD and treated with Ritalin, which was a godsend for helping withhis focusing and impulse control problems. We were assured that he would outgrowthis problem in his teen years when medication was discontinued.In the early 1990s articles appeared that stated that ADD can be a life longcondition. This led us on a search for more information, and more important, thediscovery of an expert, Dr. Daniel Amen of the Amen Clinic. We were surprised tolearn that not only was our son still afflicted but the rest of the family,including me, had the inherited disorder as well. With proper treatment, I foundinstant help for my lack of concentration, mood swings, habit of interruptingothers, and verbal raging that had gone on for years. The entire family began tounderstand just how much we were affected to our detriment in our personal livesand relationships. With appropriate counsel and treatment we began to functionand feel like “normal” people. Understanding how much we had struggled with areal handicap, rather than a character defect, led to new feelings ofself-worth. The total effect was life changing!Going from suffering to a solution turned me into an evangelist for finding away to get help for people who needed it. Working together with Gaylen and LindaBronson, we started Recovery Assistance Foundation, which has now changed thelives of hundreds of people.The Social Context of PassionPassion also occurs in the context of the present moment or the current socialsituation or group you find yourself in. For example, if you have recentlyfallen in love, most things in life revolve around your new relationship. Newlove, as we will see, is as powerful as cocaine. If, on the other hand, you haverecently split up from your significant other, your passion may be about movingon, Internet dating, or if you are ill fated, hating your ex or getting backtogether with him though you know he doesn’t want you anymore. If you havechildren a certain age, the passions may revolve around their activities orhelping them get a great education. After retirement you may develop a passionfor travel. If struck by an illness, passion may be focused on survival.Passions are influenced not only by our past lives but also by the issues andpeople we face right now, our current relationships, stresses, and physical andemotional health issues. The speaking opportunity in Mexico gave me the passionto learn at least some Spanish to prepare for my lecture.The Spirituality of PassionOur spiritual beliefs are intimately involved with passion. Your beliefs in ahigher power, how you see yourself in the universe, your level of conscience,your overall sense of meaning and purpose, all contribute to the passions youdevelop. New evidence is emerging that the brain is hardwired for God.When I was asked to speak in Mexico by psychiatrist Jose Castillo Ruiz, one ofthe conference organizers, he told me that I could not talk about sex. He hadread and used several of my books in his clinical practice, including HealingADD and Healing the Hardware of the Soul. My book Sex on the Brain had beenrecently published and I was in the middle of a publicity tour when he invitedme to speak at the conference, so I wanted to talk about it in my lecture.“We are a very Catholic, conservative country,” he insisted. “Better to stick tosafer topics.” He was very clear. Stay away from sexual topics and controversy.At noon on the day of the conference, I gave my lecture in the Monterrey Arena,to thousands of people, on my book Healing the Hardware of the Soul. Just monthsbefore Beyoncé, Gwen Stefani, and Andrea Bocelli had been on the same stage. Iwas inspired by the opportunity. It was the largest group I had ever spoken tolive. My conference hosts were wonderful. Beforehand everyone kept asking me ifI wasn’t going to be nervous speaking in front of so many people. “No,” Ireplied, “when you love your work, the passion overrides anxiety.” I did havethem, however, help me with my Spanish. I started my lecture by saying inSpanish, “Queridos amigos mios. Viva Monterrey,” to a large cheer from theaudience. “My dear friends, hail Monterrey.” My lecture was great fun and wellreceived. I behaved myself and did not talk about sex.Late in the afternoon I was on a panel with a psychiatrist from Harvard and fourreligious mystics from around the world. They were from the Catholic, Jewish,and Islamic faiths. I had no idea ahead of time what questions we would beasked. Dr. Castillo Ruiz told me not to worry, that they would be asking usquestions from the audience. Being seated onstage at a long table in front ofthousands of people with the arena darkened and the bright lights flooding ourfaces was a strangely isolating experience. I felt alone with my thoughts.The first question was about the feeling of mysticism and spiritual experience.I would go last. The mystics all talked about the ecstasy of mysticalexperience. Three of the religious men compared it to sexual experiences. Onesaid that the Song of Solomon, an erotic love story, was the holiest book in theBible. I started to get nervous. The door to talk about spirituality, sexuality,and the brain was wide open. Did I dare go through it? A priest from Spain,Father Santiago Guerra, talked about St. John of the Cross, a Carmelitereligious mystic from his country in the sixteenth century, who wrote religiouspoetry detailing his mystical experiences in a highly sexualized way.Upon my flowering breastwhich I kept wholly for him alone,there he lay sleeping,and I caressing him…When the breeze blew from the turret,as I parted his hair,it wounded my neckwith its gentle hand,suspending all my senses.I abandoned and forgot myself,laying my face on my Beloved;all things ceased;I went out from myself,leaving my cares.—St. John of the Cross from The Dark Night of the SoulAs it got near my turn, I wrote several notes. Then I looked at Dr. CastilloRuiz, who was engrossed in the dialogue. I knew he did not expect me to remainsilent. When it was my turn, the moderator asked me if there was a neuroscienceconnection to spiritual experience.Hesitantly I started, “According to some researchers, the right side of thebrain, especially the area of the temporal lobe, underneath your temple andbehind your eyes”—with my right hand I pointed to that area on my head—“has beenimplicated in spiritual experience. Michael Persinger, a research psychologistfrom Laurentian University in Canada, noted that when he gave low voltelectrical stimulation to this area people had religious or spiritualexperiences. They often felt the presence of God or a supernatural being in theroom.” I made eye contact with Dr. Castillo Ruiz, who was sitting in the frontrow. He smiled at me when our eyes met. Safe so far. “Okay,” I thought tomyself. “Here goes.”“Religious experience and sexual experience, just like the type discussed by mymystic colleagues, occur in the same general area of the brain.” Dr. CastilloRuiz now looked nervous.“In a fascinating study from Finland, using brain SPECT technology to look atblood flow and activity patterns, the same study we use in our clinics, theoutside of the right temporal lobe also lights up when women have orgasms, whenthey are brought to sexual ecstasy. Every other part of their brain decreased inactivity during orgasm. It was only the right temporal lobe, or ‘God area,’ thatlit up. In my new book, Sex on the Brain, I theorized that sexual ecstasy, infact, can be a spiritual experience. Haven’t you ever wondered”—here I pausedfor a few seconds—“why she cries ‘Oh God, oh God’ when you make her happy? Ihave wondered. Why doesn’t she cry, ‘Oh Daniel, oh Daniel,’ when I am the onedoing all the work?”As I was talking, my words were being simultaneously translated into Spanish. Iwondered if the audience would understand the meaning of what I was saying. Thena moment later as I heard the translator chuckling in my ear, the arena roaredwith laughter. Dr. Castillo Ruiz laughed as well and also looked relieved.“Great lovers,” I continued, “often use similar techniques as religious leadersto induce a state of romantic ecstasy, such as music, candles, poetry, andcommunion. Passionate loving is a godly experience. Spirituality and sexualityand the brain are tied together with passion. Great lovers induce mysticalexperiences.” The connection between spirituality and sexuality may be one ofthe reasons we see so many religious leaders get themselves into trouble withsexual issues. If similar areas of the brain are involved, it takes healthyfunctioning of the brain’s supervisor, prefrontal cortex, to keep impulses incheck.I have seen religious passion dramatically change people’s lives in a positiveway. When I was nineteen years old I became involved with Teen Challenge, aChristian group whose mission was to help drug addicts. Started on the streetsof New York City by Assembly of God minister David Wilkerson, he dealt with thehomeless, prostitutes, and criminals who were addicted to hard-core drugs likecocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine. I witnessed many drug addicts completelychange after they gave their lives to Christ. They began to heal by making aspiritual commitment, becoming part of a church, and reading and applying theBible to their lives. The passion of their beliefs overtook their drive to usedrugs.If, like me, you grew up in a deeply religious home, you often define passionoutside of yourself, as making a positive difference in the world. This can leadyou to serve others, or it can leave you in an emotional bind, deeply conflictedand ambivalent, especially if you are not honest with yourself about what youtruly love and want. Many people have a passion to serve God and make a positivedifference in life, while at the same time they have a burning desire forconnection and sexual gratification. Lying to yourself about your passions canget you into trouble. It is better to be honest about your passions andmotivations and find healthy ways to satisfy them, rather than repress them somuch they come out in unhealthy ways.The Brain of PassionUltimately, passion is felt, processed, and directed in the brain. We arehardwired for passion. There are neural circuits that, when activated, move usoff the sofa toward our psychological, social, and spiritual goals. It isimportant to understand four brain systems that work together to form thepassion and motivation circuit in the brain. Three have been discussed before:• Prefrontal cortex (PFC)—Helps with judgment, impulse control, and supervisingand controlling our passions• Deep limbic system (DLS)—Involved with mood, emotional tone, and emotionalmemory• Basal ganglia (BG)—Integrate feeling and movement, also involved with driveand pleasure• Ventral tegmental area (VTA)—Produces the neurotransmitter dopamine, which isinvolved with saliency or how important something is to do. When something ishighly salient we must do it.Dopamine is the chemical activated by passion and love. Love is a drug and worksin the same place in the brain as cocaine, the BG. A study by anthropologist Dr.Helen Fisher demonstrated dopamine’s connection to new love. Her research grouprecruited forty subjects who had just fallen in love—twenty who stayed in loveand the other half who had recently split up. She put these people into an MRItube with a photo of their sweetheart and one of an acquaintance. Each subjectlooked at the sweetheart photo for thirty seconds, then, after a distractiontask, at the acquaintance photo for another thirty seconds. They switched backand forth for twelve minutes. The result was a picture of a passionate brain.There was increased activity in the right VTA. This is the part of the brainwhere dopamine cells project into other areas of the brain, including the BG,part of the brain’s system for reward and motivation and the limbic system,involved with emotion. The sweetheart photos, but not the acquaintance photos,caused this to happen.Psychiatrist Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse,performed studies in which she tagged cocaine with a radioactive isotope to seewhere it worked in the brain. It lit up the BG, part of this reward circuit.Interestingly, the ADHD drug Ritalin did the same thing. The reason cocaine isaddictive and Ritalin typically is not is that cocaine has greater power and isin and out of the brain quickly, causing people to want more. Ritalin has aweaker response that lasts longer. Yet both cocaine and Ritalin increasemotivation. Cocaine may increase motivation for sex, while Ritalin oftenincreases motivation to get your homework finished.In a healthy brain, there is good emotional control by a competent PFC but alsoplenty of emotion, drive, and saliency from the DLS to get things done. Figure9.1 shows a healthy passion circuit. Healthy dopamine levels can drive passion,especially in the context of good activity in the PFC, which acts as the reinsso you do not get out of control. Low levels of dopamine are associated withcertain problems that rob us of motivation, such as Parkinson’s disease, orcause erratic inspiration, such as in ADHD. Addictions occur when passioncircuits take over control. These conditions are very instructive in our searchfor understanding the brain’s role in passion and how to modulate it.image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_034_r1.jpg]Figure 9.1: Healthy Passion CircuitThe Passion Thief: Parkinson’s DiseaseFirst described by the English physician James Parkinson in the early 1800s,Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive disease that is linked to adestruction of the dopamine-producing cells in a part of the BG known as thesubstantia nigra. Initially, Parkinson’s disease is a movement disordercharacterized by a resting tremor, muscle rigidity, slowness, impaired balance,and a shuffling gait. As it progresses, the face becomes unable to expressemotion and people often become depressed and unmotivated.Several years ago I received a call from one of my childhood friends. Hisfather, Carl, had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s and was experiencingpersonality changes. The family was very concerned about him. Until hisretirement, Carl was an accomplished, active, talkative, kind man. Now, all hewanted to do was stay home. He had no motivation and wanted his wife tocompletely wait on him while he watched television all day long. He particularlyliked scary movies, Jerry Springer, and Dr. Phil, which shocked his family. WhenI asked him about these shows, his emotionless face came to life, his eyes litup, and his smile became broad. He liked the fighting and the drama. They wereexciting to him. They made him feel alive. Parkinson’s disease took this sweet,considerate, brilliant man and turned him into a complete stranger to hisfamily. These were shows he would never have watched before. Now, he thrived onwatching people throw chairs, loved learning about siblings who were having sexwith each other, and enjoyed watching Dr. Phil chew people out for not choosingthe right behavior.There is more to the dopamine story. In a sad twist of fate, several of themedications used to treat Parkinson’s disease by increasing dopamineavailability in the brain, including Mirapex and Requip, have come under firefor increasing pleasure or reward sensations too much, causing people to haveaffairs or start compulsive gambling. Dr. Max Wells alleged in court that hismedication caused a gambling addiction that made him a habitual high roller atLas Vegas casinos where he lost $7 million by late 2005 and another $7 millionby January of 2006. Dr. Wells had originally been taking Mirapex for hisParkinson’s, but when he noticed his occasional recreational gambling had becomemore serious, he told his doctor that he thought that drug might be the cause.His doctor changed his medication to Requip and increased the dosage. AlthoughWells then began running up massive gambling losses, amassing some $1.2 millionin debts, his wife remained unaware of the problem since she was not presentwhen the losses occurred. When Dr. Wells finally told his wife about the losses,the problem was brought to the attention of his physician. As soon as Requip wasstopped, so did the compulsive gambling. The behavior changes seen in someParkinson’s disease patients whose therapy includes dopamine boosters can bewide ranging. On the mild side, some start buying lottery tickets and nothingmore. Others, however, have been known to develop serious obsessive-compulsivedisorders as well as aggressive sexual impulses, overeating, medication abuse,or pathological gambling. A balance of dopamine is best; too little and there isno motivation, too much and we can go nuts.Erratic Inspiration: ADHDParkinson’s disease usually occurs after the age of fifty. An example of a lowdopamine state that starts early in life and often persists into adulthood isADHD. First described by English physician George Still in 1902, ADHD ischaracterized by short attention span, distractibility, disorganization,procrastination, and poor internal supervision or judgment. It is often,although not always, accompanied by hyperactivity and impulsivity. Dopamine geneabnormalities are common in ADHD and medications that increase dopamineavailability in the brain, such as stimulants like Ritalin or Adderall, are usedto treat it. In addition, ADHD is associated with low activity in the prefrontalcortex. Low dopamine levels are associated with low PFC activity as well. Whenthe VTA does not produce enough dopamine, it cannot drive the BG-PFC circuitinto appropriate action.The hallmark symptom of ADHD is difficulty paying attention. But interestingly,people with ADHD do not have trouble paying attention to everything. Theystruggle with regular, routine, everyday attention, such as for schoolwork,homework, paperwork, or chores, the stuff that makes life work. They die inboring lectures and are pained by long meetings, and traditional church servicesseem like they go on forever. However, for events that are new, novel, highlystimulating, interesting, frightening, passionate, or filled with love, peoplewith ADHD can often pay attention just fine. These areas have their ownintrinsic dopamine. Again, love is a drug. This phenomenon often fools parents,physicians, and bosses.An ADHD teenager may be struggling in school getting mostly C’s, D’s, or F’s,while in one or two classes he is thriving. A parent, seeing the erratic grades,often makes the wrong assumption and gets upset at the teen, saying, “I know youare smart. Look at the A in history. You are just lazy in your other classes.”Yet if the teen loved history or his history teacher, the love supplied thedopamine for his increased performance. He needs love or excitement to payattention.Likewise, many physicians make the same fundamental mistake in diagnosing ADHD.They ask parents if children have the attention span to watch TV or play videogames. Some children with severe ADHD can watch TV or play video games for sixhours straight. When the parents say yes, the physician dismisses the diagnosis.When considering ADHD in teens or adults, doctors ask if they can pay attention.Almost all say yes. The insightful ones will say, “Yes, if I am interested!” Thephysician will then dismiss the idea of an ADHD diagnosis even when flagrantproblems are present. It is critical to ask about specific attention forregular, routine everyday tasks and to ask those around the ADHD person. Youoften get a very different answer.At work, employees who have ADHD often pose a frustrating challenge forsupervisors. Many people with ADHD are bright, social, and insightful. Theyoften excel at sales or creative jobs. Yet when asked to do simple paperwork orcomplete a project on time, the ADHD employee struggles. Unknowing, supervisorssee the behavior problems as willful and insubordinate and often terminatepotentially great employees.Many people with ADHD are conflict or excitement seeking. Without enoughdopamine to boost their brains, they use external stimuli, such as fighting withsiblings, parents, or lovers; stirring up trouble at work; going to scary moviesor to strip clubs; engaging in serial Internet dating; exposing themselves torisky sexual practices; or edgy driving to light up their lives. I once treatedan ADHD man who was a professional race-car driver. He said he never felt morealive than when he was on the starting line of a race.I often see this pattern in teenage girls with ADHD who come to one of myclinics after a suicide attempt from feeling devastated over the loss of aromantic relationship. The next week they often feel better because someone newhas shown interest in them. The following week they may be even better stillbecause they have hooked up with the new guy. Then the trouble begins. The nextweek there is often fighting and turmoil in the new relationship. And thefollowing week she is often devastated because they broke up. Yet the next weekshe may have a new guy on her radar, so she feels better, and the cycle startsagain. Whether the behavior is luring, hooking up, fighting, or breaking up, theeffect on the brain is the same. There is drama and stimulation. When thepattern is uncovered and people become aware (in Sigmund Freud’s language,making the unconscious conscious), healing can start, as long as appropriatestimulation is given to the PFC with proper treatment.Passion Circuits Out of Control: AddictionsAddictive disorders also teach us about passion and motivation. These disorderscause people to feel and act out of control. They work on the same circuitry inthe brain as love but in a very destructive way. The drugs or behaviors thatlight the passion circuits are strangely reinforcing and grab a person by thethroat, whether it is alcohol, drugs, sex, gambling, or eating. Robert DowneyJr., who struggled with a prolonged, severe drug addiction, once said it waslike having a loaded gun to your head, demanding you to stop, then doing itanyway, despite the consequences. You would rather risk death than to be withoutthe high.According to Minneapolis sex addictionologist Mark Laaser, Ph.D., “the arousaltemplate” underlies many addictions. In this model it is important to understandthe first addictive experience. Cocaine addicts often say they are,unsuccessfully, chasing their first high. Gambling addicts usually have one bigwin that flips the switch and the chase for the next big win is on. Sex addictsoften have a powerful first experience that they start pursuing with greatenergy and motivation. If the experience was unusual they may even develop afetish or paraphilia.When low activity in the PFC accompanies a powerful arousal template, peoplelose control over their behaviors. Low activity in the PFC can be from a braininjury, ADHD, environmental toxin, or sedating substance such as alcohol. Figure9.2 demonstrates what happens during an addiction.Love is a drug, whether it appears in the form of a specific history teacher,Jerry Springer, Dr. Phil, alcohol, cocaine, women’s running shoes, or horrormovies. When someone who struggles with low dopamine levels is in a job orrelationship they love, they have fewer problems at work. I have even seen ADHDpeople need less medication for jobs they are passionate about, rather than jobsthat bore them. I often tell my ADHD patients to choose professions they love,rather than ones they think will make them a lot of money, as they will be morelikely to be successful. Love for God can help break an addiction, as we sawwith Teen Challenge. In the context of a healthy PFC, the secret to passion isto do what you love. How do you find what you love? What are the steps todiscovering your passions?Maximum Fun: Lighting the Passion Circuits in a Healthy WayOn the crystal clear, breezy shores of Lake Tahoe in early August, my nephewMatt married his high school sweetheart, Charly. They were in their earlytwenties, finishing their last years of college and starting a life togetherthey hoped would last forever. As the upbeat ceremony finished, rather than playthe traditional wedding recessional song, Matt and Charly walked out of theservice to the theme music from Rocky. Matt was the champion. He got the girl ofhis dreams. Later, as I sat with my family at the reception, looking out at thedeep blue lake as the sun sparkled diamonds of light on the water, Dusty, thebest man, got up to give a toast. He read from his notes. He said all of theusual things best men say at weddings. Then he turned to Matt and said, “Youonce told me that you start each morning by thinking of the maximum amount offun you can have that day, then spend the next sixteen or so hours making ithappen. I have never forgotten what you said. Maximum fun. You live your lifejust that way. I know being married to Charly will be maximum fun.”image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_035_r1.jpg]Figure 9.2: Addicted Passion CircuitIn this diagram you see the PFC is weak, so it has little control over unbridledpassions that drive behaviors. Addiction actually changes the brain in anegative way, making it harder to apply the brakes to harmful behaviors. In thenon-addicted brain, the PFC is constantly assessing the value of incominginformation and the appropriateness of the planned response, applying inhibitorycontrol as needed. In the addicted brain, this control circuit becomes impairedthrough drug abuse and loses much of its inhibitory power over the circuits thatdrive response to stimuli deemed salient.In a healthy way, what has given you maximum fun? What do you love? What is yourpassion? What do you want? What must you have? What will you travel the world tofind? What will you die for? In your past, what has raised your dopamine levelsand moved you forward? After having a healthy brain, especially the PFC,learning how to activate your passion circuits is the next step in achieving amagnificent mind. You activate these circuits with intense emotion, with love.To activate your passion circuits it is important to know what has turned you onin the past. This will help you understand the arousal templates that alreadyexist in your brain. In addition, knowing what currently turns you on allows youto gauge your present level of passion and imagine what will turn you on in thefuture.For each area of your life—relationships; work; finances; and physical,emotional, intellectual, and spiritual health—list at least three to fiveinstances, general or specific, in which you were turned on, excited, or feltmaximum fun in your past and present life. Also, write about what you thinkwould give you those same feelings in the future. This will help you see thepassion templates that are already present in your brain and help you developnew ones for the future. Be honest about things like sex and recreation, butalso go deeper to see what has had meaning and purpose for you as well. At therisk of too much exposure, here is my list for relationships.RELATIONSHIPSPast:1. Falling in love, kissing my first love for hours2. Being part of a big family, family gatherings, playing together3. Competing at tennis, table tennis, basketball, anythingPresent:1. Being in love, making love, being close, talking for hours2. Being a parent, encouraging, teaching, protecting, helping3. Cultivating friendships from all over the globe, being helpful to those Ilove4. Being part of a big family, family gatherings, playing togetherFuture:1. Being in love, physical and emotional closeness and connection2. Being a parent and grandparent, encouraging, teaching, protecting, helping3. Being part of a big family, family gatherings, playing together4. Having friends all over the globe, finding mutual support and caringThe first time I did this exercise, it was clear to me that my passions areabout being connected, sexual, playful, and helpful, where I am a lifelonglearner and living a life that matters to make this planet a better place. Asyou search for the match to light the passion circuits in your brain, it isessential to specifically define what success means to you. My goals are likelynot your goals, and your goals will not be someone else’s. Success is a personaldefinition, and it may change over time as you go through different stages oflife. Specifically, how do you define success? This is of critical importance,because as we will see, your brain tends to make happen what it focuses on."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_036_r1.jpg]Make Your Own Miraclesimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]USE YOUR BRAIN TO DEFINE YOUR DREAMS AND MAKE THEM A REALITYIf you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you.If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you.Whatever good things we build end up building us.—JIM ROHN, author and motivational speakerYour brain is the most powerful organ in the universe. It has the ability todirect your life in a positive way or create a living hell. To harness yourbrain’s power it needs direction and vision. It needs a blueprint. You are morelikely to be successful on your own terms if you define success clearly,specifically, in writing, with detail.As the passion circuits supply the emotional fuel for your life, the prefrontalcortex (PFC) is the steering wheel and the brakes. The PFC has been called theexecutive brain and is the chief executive officer (CEO) of your life. Like agreat CEO, the PFC adds direction and helps you stay the course, despitewhatever obstacles are put in your path. When the PFC is healthy, we arethoughtful, goal directed, focused, exhibit good judgment, and can control ourimpulses. When it is low in activity we tend to get distracted, scattered, andfollow the whims of the moment rather than our goals. We also have troublecontrolling our passions, which may get us accused of sexual harassment, in debtfrom a spending frenzy, or a drunk-driving arrest. When the PFC works too hard,we micromanage our lives and get little accomplished. One simple way to help thePFC manage our lives better is to have clear, passionate, written goals—goalsthat sustain and motivate.How Do You Define Success?Given that this book is about optimizing the brain to be your best in life, itis important to have a clear definition of what success means to you. Mostpeople want to be successful without knowing exactly what that means. Whenpushed to define success, most equate it with happiness, wealth, recognition,independence, friendships, achievement, or inner peace—all vague concepts. Evenmost dictionaries define success in ways that have little specific meaning:common phrases used are“a favorable result; the gaining of wealth, fame, etc.;or a successful person or thing.”Does this mean that success is ambiguous? Notat all. It simply means that it is a very personal thing and needs to be definedin the context of individual lives. What may be one person’s success might beanother person’s failure. Defining success depends on many factors. Here areseveral to consider.1. DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE OF LIFESuccess for a seventeen-year-old is often having enough money for a car, makingthe sports team, and having a date on most Friday nights. For someone in hisearly twenties it may mean having maximum fun. A person in his thirties maymeasure success by being on the right career track, having a home and a mortgagehe can afford, and being able to give his kids the piano or dancing lessons theywant. These examples are both markedly different from the way asixty-five-year-old might look at success. To him success might involvesecurity, health, contentment with his life, and being able to share the joys ofhis children and grandchildren.2. FAMILY BACKGROUNDFamily of origin is one of the most important influences on how people defineindividual success. Family values, traditions, religious orientations, and goalsserve as the backdrop against which success is often measured. Success in onefamily may mean little, or even failure, in another. For example, one familymight put a high emotional value on education and academic accomplishment, whileanother family might focus on athletic success. Some families may define successin group terms, for the married couple or for the family as a whole, whileothers have more individual definitions.Success messages are given to children even before birth. It is not uncommon tohear parents voicing aspirations for their children during the mother’spregnancy. As the child grows, these messages may be subtle: excitement when achild pretends to be a doctor or picks up his first football or apathy when hebangs on the piano or takes an interest in classifying bugs. Or the messages maybe overt: ridicule when a good student brings home four A’s and three B’s,indicating acceptance only comes with perfection, or praise when a child datesthe culturally acceptable person and disdain when he does not.Initially, most children are very interested in getting their parents’attention, and they are constantly on the lookout for ways to gain favor. If theparental messages are too harsh, however, it is not uncommon to find childrendefining success in ways opposite to the ideas of their parents, setting upconflict. Unfulfilled goals or dreams of parents are also transmitted tochildren. A parent who always wanted to go to college but could not afford itmay put a strong emphasis on education. A mother who felt trapped or tied downby her marriage and children will encourage her daughters to have careers andmake something of themselves, so as not to repeat her unhappy scenario.Several other important factors originate from family background. These includeidentification with parents or grandparents; the wish to please, hurt, orcompete with parents; and the desire to give their children things they feltlacking in their own childhoods. Someone raised in the turmoil of an alcoholichome might define success in terms of having a loving family life and being ableto give his children the stability and emotional security he never had.Competition with siblings or friends is often an important factor in how aperson defines success. You may define your success based on the thoughts andactions of others.Clinically, I have found that if a child grows up in an approving and lovingenvironment, success is much easier to find in whatever way he chooses to defineit. But if a child grows up in a household where the parents were neversatisfied no matter how hard the child tried, success is likely to be defined inunreachable terms.3. PSYCHOLOGICAL MAKEUPHow a person is put together psychologically also has a great impact on how heviews success. Character structure, inner life, relationships, psychologicalhealth, and brain health interact to give him feelings of contentment orturmoil. A person who has a need to be loved and admired will feel moresuccessful with fame and achievement as opposed to wealth. Someone who is aloner will feel more successful with individual accomplishments than group ones.Likewise, an antisocial character will feel more successful breaking the law andgetting away with it rather than living by the rules.One of the most successful people I have met was a patient of mine who had aserious psychotic illness—chronic schizophrenia. Most aspects of aschizophrenic’s life are affected by this devastating illness. For Beth,however, it was different. She sought the treatment she needed, tookresponsibility for taking her medicine and keeping her therapy appointments, andtrusted the husband who loved her. Success for her was different than it is formost people. It was defined as staying out of the hospital and being able toraise her children in a sane environment, one that was different from thetorture of her own early youth. I never saw her more proud than the day shewalked into my office and said she had gotten a job all by herself at a doughnutshop.Success is individually defined according to the circumstances of your life. Inthe process of realizing your dreams it is critical to define success foryourself, as specifically as possible. Here are nine rules to keep in mind.Rule 1: Your Success Is Defined Only by YouMost people look to others for examples of success. Statements like “He must besuccessful because he is a surgeon” (or “drives a BMW” or “lives in a richneighborhood”) are very misleading. Unless you know how other people definesuccess, you have very little idea whether they consider themselves successful.It’s clear from my clinical work that many, many people who others wouldclassify as “successful” are unhappy. They lack the feeling of success. Only wecan author our own success and we need to personally define its parameters.Along a similar line, if you let someone else define your success, you’re likelyto be unhappy. You may even feel as though you are living out someone else’slife, not your own. Katie, a patient of mine, lived this example.Katie worked at her father’s publishing company. She was very good at her joband was loved by her supervisor and co-workers. Yet she felt unhappy. She hadwanted to be a grammar school teacher ever since the fourth grade. She enteredcollege majoring in primary school education. However, her father talked her outof teaching. Low pay, disruptive kids, and waning social status for teacherswere the reasons he gave her. He told Katie that she should enter his business,as she had the possibility of taking it over one day. Katie followed herfather’s advice, but she always felt unfulfilled in her job and found that shelonged to work with kids in a classroom. In fact, she arranged her schedule tostart at 10 A.M. so she could volunteer at a local school. She even spent hervacations tutoring at the school. When her father discovered what she was doing,he felt regret. He told her to go teach. He had followed his passion. He wantedthe same thing for her.Rule 2: Success Is a FeelingSuccess is nothing until you feel it. I once heard a story about three umpireson how they call balls and strikes. The first one said, “I call them the way Isee them.” The second umpire said, “I call them the way they are.” And the thirdone said, “They ain’t nothing until I call them.”Success is a feeling, a perception on your part. Most people think of success interms of symbols, not feelings. In the final analysis, however, it is how wefeel about where we have been and where we are going that is the ultimatemeasure of our success in life.We all know of people who had all of the success symbols—social status, wealth,possessions, outstanding achievements, admiration—but who considered themselvesfailures. The symbols did not prevent Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, JimiHendrix, River Phoenix, John Belushi, Robert Downey Jr., Owen Wilson andcountless other so-called successful people, from feeling like failures whoneeded drugs or alcohol or who turned to self-destruction to be rid of thepainful feelings. I call this the empty success syndrome—the outward appearanceof success without any of the positive feelings on the inside. A word ofcaution: sometimes feelings lie to you. If all evidence points to success inyour life, but you feel unsuccessful or like an impostor, there may be a problemwith your thinking.Rule 3: Success at Any Price May Not Be SuccessSince success is a feeling, the means by which the symbols of success areobtained may be important. For most people (not everyone), the ways in whichthey reach their goals have an impact on how they feel about themselves in theprocess. If goals are reached in ways contrary to individual belief systems,conflicts over the reality or value of the success may arise. For example, if anexecutive made it to the top by using his friends as stepping-stones, he mayfeel loneliness later on that could ruin his feelings of accomplishment. Orconsider the situation of someone who gets ahead by lying or cheating. Peoplewho build a career on a foundation of dishonesty may temporarily enjoy theirachievement, but after a short while they are likely to feel doubt about theirability and self-worth and end up feeling more like criminals than successstories.Rule 4: Success Is a ProcessSuccess is not a static entity, a gold watch at the end of thirty years, or apaper published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It is a process ofdefining and redefining, struggling toward and reaching the goals you set foryourself. It is the day-to-day feeling that accompanies your efforts that drivesyou on.Most people think of success as an end point, the pot of gold at the end of therainbow. The end of the rainbow, however, may be a dangerous place to be. Thereare many examples of people who reach their pinnacles only to develop seriousillnesses or depression shortly thereafter. Executive promotion depression hasbeen known to behavioral scientists for some time. This occurs when a person hasreached his major goal in work, say, to become a company’s CEO, and then becomesdepressed. Unless he immediately sets new goals for himself, the feeling of “isthis all there is?” may set in, leading to depression.More insight into the dangers of reaching goals comes from the research of Dr.E. K. Gunderson and Dr. Richard Rahe, who correlated life events with thedevelopment of physical illness. Surprisingly, they found that not only didstresses like death of a spouse, divorce, job loss, and detention in jailcorrelate with greater physical illness, but so did positive events likemarriage, outstanding personal achievements, graduating from college, jobpromotions, and retirement.If success is viewed as a goal to be reached, what happens after that? Feelingsof success live only for a short while after goals are reached. The ultimatesatisfaction comes from attaining, not just from attainment. Successful peopleare not there; they are in the process of getting there, wherever there may befor them.Rule 5: Success Occurs in StepsNo one is born with the feeling of success. In fact, we are all born a bitconfused and soon learn that we are very small in a very big world. It is hardto have much sense of self-esteem and mastery when you have to crawl or walkalong the furniture to get anywhere. With loving and encouraging parents,however, our sense of mastery grows day by day, not in leaps or giant steps, butin small baby steps. Hopefully, we will make progress, but there will always bedays when we slip back a step or two. With support, we learn that these setbacksare part of the process, and we continue along the road of self-development.Early successes bring positive feelings, which encourage children to want to domore to obtain more positive feelings. If the child gets enough positivefeelings about himself, he will begin to believe in his abilities and be able toachieve, because it feels good to be successful. This process does not happenovernight and will not change overnight. Expecting to find success in instantsolutions (instant wealth, relationships, recognition, or achievement) inviteslifelong disappointment. Success, like learning to walk, is a process thatoccurs in tiny steps.Rule 6: Success Is a Balancing ActBalance is just as important to feelings of success as to a ballet dancer. Weall have a personal life that no one else sees, a relational life with others,and a work life. It is very possible to feel successful in one of these areaswhile feeling like a failure in the others. Very few people I know have it all.But if your life becomes too unbalanced, you may find that your non-successareas drain energy from those areas you feel good about. Balance, perspective,and trade-offs are necessary for success. What good is it to make all the moneyin the world if the person of your dreams leaves you?You decide how much weight to give to each area of your life. This varies forall of us, and it will even be different at different stages in your life. Whenyou think about defining success, don’t allow yourself to become unbalanced.Rule 7: Success Can Be LearnedSuccess is not something that you’re born with or something you inherit. It issomething that comes from a healthy brain that is properly encouraged andprogrammed. In Secrets of Successful Students I describe how I went from being amediocre high school student to summa cum laude in college. Looking back, thetransformation was not a big mystery. No one in grammar school or high schoolever really taught me how to study. Nor did I have much motivation or confidenceto succeed. When I learned the secrets of great students and developed thematurity and passion to succeed, I was able to make it happen. Likewise, successin any endeavor occurs through a series of steps. After tending to your brain’shealth, determine what steps you need to do in order to be successful. Inparticular, see what others have done in situations similar to yours.Rule 8: Defining Success Too High or Too Low Will Derail YouIf you aim too high you’ll quickly feel overwhelmed and your goals will dissolveinto daydreams. Expecting to make a million dollars on your first real estatedeal after attending a seminar or expecting your chronically conflicted marriageto turn around in three weeks of marital therapy only sets you up for failure.Change, success, and fulfillment take time. On the other hand, if you aim toolow, your patience and endurance may run out before you get the positivefeelings necessary to motivate you to go on. The best way to start defining andexperiencing success is by setting up reasonably realistic goals that can beobtained in a foreseeable period.Rule 9: Success Is Having the Ability to Be Honest with YourselfTo feel successful, you must be able to be honest about the things that arereally important to you. Whether it has to do with acquiring money, changingcareers, becoming involved in a new relationship, or discarding a destructiveone, being truthful with yourself is the only way to allow the inner sense ofcontentment and success to exist without feeling like an impostor. Persistentdissatisfaction and frequent mind changes are clues that you aren’t being honestwith yourself.Honing Your Individual Definition of SuccessThe following questions are designed to help you clarify exactly, at this pointin time, what success means to you. Remember that success is a process, and theanswers to these questions will change over time. On a separate piece of paper,answer the questions as honestly as you can, and be prepared to be surprised byyour responses.This rest of this builds on itself. Answer the questions in sequence. It willtake some time to complete, and the information it will generate is crucial tohelping you define your goals for success. When you finish, go over your answersat least twice to reflect on their significance. Make it count!1. Rank the following ten items in order of their importance to you (1 = mostimportant, 10 = least important).____Happiness____Fun____Wealth____Health____Fulfilling relationships____Fame____Individual accomplishments____Legacy____Making a difference in the lives of others____Faith in a higher power2. With the above ranking in mind, what are you now doing to accomplish orenhance the first five items you placed on the list? Success is a process. Whatare you doing to help that process along?3. Think of yourself lying in your coffin at the end of your life. What wasreally important to you in your life? What really mattered to you? At the end ofyour life, what has value for you? This has always been one of my favoritequestions. It helps put your life into a lifelong perspective. When you startwith the end in mind, the present moment becomes much more important.4. Are you giving enough time and effort to those people or things that reallymatter to you? Or are you unconsciously spending the bulk of your time on thingsof lesser personal value?5. What developmental period of life are you in (adolescence, young adulthood,middle age, etc.)? How have your personal goals changed from the previousperiod? How do you think they’ll change ten years from now? Thinking aheadprevents events like midlife crises, empty nest syndrome, and so on.6. List ten instances in which you felt most competent, ten instances in whichyou felt most confident, ten instances in which you felt most connected toothers, and ten instances in which you felt the most joy in your life.7. Name five people whom you look up to and admire. Describe the specific traitsyou admire and the ways you would like to be like them.8. Name five people you know whom you do not admire. Describe the specificthings about them that turn you off. Be as specific as you can.9. List five experiences in which you felt like a failure.10. List five experiences in which you felt successful.11. In defining goals, there are three major areas of your life to examine:a. relationships (with spouse or lover, children, family, friends)b. work/finances (your job, school if you are a student, or tasks at home ifyou’re a housewife, current and future finances, etc.)c. personal life (the part of your life that applies just to you outside ofrelationships or work: physical and emotional health, spirituality, interests,intellectual growth, etc.)How significant/important is each to you? Rank each of them on a 1-to 10-pointscale, giving 10 points to areas that are all-consuming and 1 point to areasthat have little significance to you.Relational life ____Work/Financial life ____Personal life ____How much time do you give to each area? Does this reflect its importance to you? Answering these questions will also help you answer the questions “What do youwant? What matters most?” When you know what you want, you can then go takeactive steps toward accomplishing your goals. You mind makes happen what itsees.Your Brain Makes Happen What It SeesJenny, age thirty-two, was a bus driver for the city in the Bay Area. She cameto see me in her work uniform, looking very sad, and eight months pregnant. Asshe sat down on the sofa in my office she had tears running down both hercheeks. Her family and boyfriend had just disowned her and she felt isolated,alone, and confused.“How can this happen?” she started. “How can I look and feel pregnant but notbe? How can I make my own breasts larger? Have no periods? Have this belly?” Hervoice raised as she put her hand on her distended abdomen. “How is thispossible? Am I crazy?”Jenny had been together with her boyfriend for four years. They were planning toget married when she believed she became pregnant. For the past two years shehad wanted to be pregnant. Even though her initial pregnancy test was negativeshe was convinced that she was. All of the signs were there. The test must havebeen wrong, she thought. She had morning sickness and even thought she felt thebaby move. As she believed she was getting closer to delivery date she went backto the doctor who, after running more tests, told her she was definitely notpregnant.The weekend before she got the news from her doctor, her family had just givenher a baby shower. The family, initially excited, now felt duped. They told herthey did not want anything more to do with her. Her boyfriend, not knowing whatto think, moved out.Jenny had a condition known as pseudocyesis, or false pregnancy. Believing shewas pregnant, even though she wasn’t, her brain sent the signals to the rest ofher body to make the symptoms of pregnancy occur. Pseudocyesis has been knownsince antiquity. Hippocrates wrote of twelve women who “believed they werepregnant” in 300 B.C. In 1923 John Mason Good coined the term from the Greekwords pseudes (false) and kyesis (pregnancy).As I explained her condition, Jenny initially looked confused. Over time,however, she began to understand the power of her brain. After a family meeting,and several sessions with her boyfriend, she reconnected with the people sheloved.Believing she was pregnant even though she wasn’t, her brain changed the wholeshape and function of Jenny’s body. Likewise, seeing fear in your future, evenwhere there is none, can make you feel so panicked you end up in the emergencyroom. Seeing your husband or sweetheart leaving you can make you act soinsecure, clingy, and dependent that it is more likely you will be left.Negative thoughts can make negative things happen, while positive thoughts canhelp you reach your goals. The expectation of success is a very powerful forceby itself. Skilled physicians have known for centuries that positiveexpectations play a crucial role in the outcome of many illnesses. Until 100 to150 years ago, the history of medical therapeutics was largely that of thedoctor-patient relationship and the placebo effect (placebos being inertsubstances that have no physiologic effect on the problem). Actually, most ofthe treatments by physicians in times past would have been more harmful thanbeneficial to the patient, if it weren’t for the recuperative powers of thehuman organism supported by the belief in the healing powers of the physician’sprescriptions. The benefits of the placebo effect are determined by theexpectations and hopes shared by the patient and the doctor. Action, ritual,faith, and enthusiasm are the vital ingredients. After studying thepsychotherapeutic process Johns Hopkins psychiatrist Jerome Frank, M.D.,concluded that the belief of the therapist in his treatment and the belief ofthe patient in the therapist were the most important factors in a positiveoutcome to therapy.Although a placebo is a substance that is considered pharmacologically inert, itis by no means “nothing.” It is a potent therapeutic tool, on the average aboutone half to two thirds as powerful as morphine in relieving severe pain. It isnow recognized that one third of the general population are placebo respondersin clinical situations relating to pain, whether the pain is from surgery, heartdisease, cancer, or headache. It is very clear that placebo responses are notsimply a result of the patient fooling or tricking himself out of the pain.Placebo administration can produce real physiologic changes. Some of thephysiologic pathways through which the placebo effects work have beenidentified. In a study done by a University of California research team, it wasfound that the placebo effect of pain relief in dental patients could actuallybe blocked by administering these patients naloxone, a drug that neutralizesmorphine. From this study and others, it has become clear that the belief inpain relief stimulates the body to secrete its own pain relieving substance,called endorphins, which act in the same manner as morphine, only they are muchmore potent. In a recent study, doctors at Houston’s Veterans Affairs MedicalCenter performed arthroscopic knee surgery on one group of patients witharthritis, scraping and rinsing their knee joints. On another group, the doctorsmade small cuts in the patients’ knees to mimic the incisions of a realoperation and then bandaged them up. The pain relief reported by the two groupswas identical. In a brain imaging study, researchers found that when placeboworked for depressed patients, brain function also changed in a positive way.Change your beliefs; change your brain.Tell your brain what you want and match your behavior to get it. If your mindtakes what it sees and makes it happen, it is critical to visualize what youwant and then match your behavior over time to get it. Too many people arethrown around by the whims of the day rather than using their prefrontal cortexto plan their lives and follow through on their goals.One-Page MiracleOne of the most powerful yet simple exercises I have designed is called theOne-Page Miracle (OPM). It will help guide nearly all of your thoughts, words,and actions. It is called the OPM because I’ve seen this exercise quickly focusand change many people’s lives. Directions: On one sheet of paper, clearly write out your major goals. Use thefollowing main headings: Relationships, Work/Finances, and Myself. UnderRelationships write the subheadings Spouse/Lover, Children, Extended Family, andFriends. Under Work/Finances write Short Term and Long Term. Under Myself writePhysical Health, Emotional Health, Spirituality, and Character. Self is thatpart of you outside of relationships or work. Often it is the part of you thatno one sees but you.Next to each subheading succinctly write out what’s important to you in thatarea; write what you want, not what you don’t want. Be positive and use thefirst person. Write what you want with confidence and the expectation that youwill make it happen. Keep the paper with you so that you can work on it overseveral days or weeks. After you finish with the initial draft (you’llfrequently want to update it), place this piece of paper where you can see itevery day, such as on your refrigerator, by your bedside, or on the bathroommirror. In that way, every day you focus your eyes on what’s important to you.This makes it easier to match your behavior to what you want. Your life becomesmore conscious and you spend your energy on goals that are important to you.I separate the areas of relationships, work, and self in order to encourage amore balanced approach to life. Burnout occurs when our lives become unbalancedand we overextend ourselves in one area while ignoring another. For example, inmy practice I see that a common cause of divorce stems from a person’s workingso much that little energy is left over for his or her spouse.Here is an example I did with one of my patients who came to see me after a headinjury at the insistence of his wife. Tony is a program developer at a localproduction company. He is married with one child. Since the injury he hadsignificant impulse control problems, spent too much money, and was irritable athome.After you look at the example, fill out the OPM for yourself. If you have PFCchallenges, this exercise will be very helpful for you. If you don’t havechallenges in this part of your brain, this exercise will still help keep youfocused on what’s important in your life. After you complete this exercise putit up where you can see and read it every day. It is a great idea to start theday off by reading the OPM to get focused for the day.TONY’S ONE-PAGE MIRACLEWhat Do I Want for My Life?RELATIONSHIPS—To be connected to those I loveSpouse/Lover: To maintain a close, kind, caring, loving partnership with mywife. I want her to know how much I care about her. I want to act in a way thatmakes her feel less worried about me.Children: To be a firm, kind, positive, predictable presence in my child’s life.I want to help her to develop into a happy, responsible person.Extended Family: To continue to keep close contact with my parents and siblings,to provide support and loveFriends: To take time to maintain and nurture my friendships WORK—To be my best at work, to be the best program developer I can be, whilemaintaining a balanced life. Specifically, my work activities focus on takingcare of my current projects, doing activities targeted at obtaining newprograms, and giving back to the community by doing some charity work eachmonth. I will focus on my goals at work and not get distracted by things notdirectly related to my goals. FINANCES—To be responsible and thoughtful and help our resources growShort Term: To be thoughtful of how our money is spent, to ensure it is directlyrelated to my family’s and my needs and goals. Since the injury my judgment hasnot been the best, so I will check with my wife before I spend more than fiftydollars.Long Term: To save 10 percent of everything I earn. I pay myself and my familybefore other things. I’ll put this money away each month in a pension plan forretirement. MYSELF—To be the healthiest person I can be, which is even more essential sincethe injuryPhysical Health: To take care of my body on a daily basis, exercise, eat well,get good sleep, take a vitamin and fish oil, and the other supplements Dr. Amenrecommends for meEmotional Health: To feel stable, positive, and gratefulSpirituality: To live close to God, attend church regularly, and pray dailyCharacter: To be honest, thoughtful, kind, and trustworthy, to live withintegrityMY ONE-PAGE MIRACLEWhat Do I Want? What Am I Doing to Make It Happen?image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_051_r1.jpg]Once you clearly define what you want, meditate and focus on it, you’re ready tomake your goals and desires part of your daily life. By developing specificnerve pathways for your desires, the planning and steering part of your brain,the PFC, will help you realize your dreams. Your OPM now becomes the guidepostfor all of your thoughts, feelings, and actions. It is the road map of yourlife. As you now know what you want, it is critical to move your behavior towardyour goals and away from things you do not want. Consistent, positive, congruenteffort is essential to success. Clearly, this takes a healthy brain, especiallyin the PFC. Let your brain help you design and implement your success in life.Work toward goals that are important to you. Many other people or corporationsare happy to decide what you should do with your life. Use the OPM to help yoube the one who has the primary say. Your brain receives and creates reality.Give it some direction to help make your life what you want it to be. Teachyourself to be focused on what’s important to you. This auxiliary PFC will helpyou keep your life on track."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_037_r1.jpg]Know When to Apply the Brakesimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]STRENGTHEN YOUR BRAIN’S INTERNAL CONTROLSThe art of leadership is saying no, not yes. It is very easy to say yes.—TONY BLAIROn a recent trip to Maui, I watched a fascinating interaction between anassertive four-year-old, red headed girl in pigtails and her mother. I washaving lunch at a café overlooking the Maalaea Harbor at the Maui Ocean Center.It was a warm, serene day, with a light tropical breeze. The sea was calm. Then,in a flash, a storm erupted at the table next to me. Reaching for her camera,the mother accidentally knocked over a glass of ice water. Her little girlsquealed with excitement, probably because she was the one who usually spilledthe drinks. The mother was obviously embarrassed. As she started to mop up thewater, the little girl gleefully started to play in it with both hands. Sternly,the mother told her to stop and put her hands down at her sides. But the littlegirl wanted to play in it, so she didn’t listen the first time. The motherrepeated her warning, this time with a consequence attached. “One more movetoward the water,” the mother said, “and I am taking away your baby dolly.” Thiscaused the girl to retreat quickly. Her baby doll, also with red hair, was moreimportant to her than the momentary pleasure. I had seen her playing with thedoll before the water incident. After a few seconds, however, I could see thetemptation of the water was starting to build in the little girl’s brain. Thetables were made of a rough stone top and the water formed little pools with theice floating like miniature ships. It just seemed like too much fun. The littlegirl sheepishly looked at her mother to see if she was watching. When she sawthat her mother was distracted with the cleanup effort, the girl slowly startedto move her stretched out little fingers toward the water. It reminded me of thestruggle between good and evil we all face. Do I inhibit my impulses and do whatis right? Or do I do what I want in the moment? Which one would win on thisgorgeous Maui day, I wondered? There were competing interests. Maximum fun ormaintaining possession of a beloved baby dolly? “She is only four,” I thought tomyself. “Her (PFC) has barely started its long trek toward maturity.” As itturned out, the mother mopped up the water with the help from an attentivewaiter and the little girl was saved from her impulses. Her dolly’s freedom wassafe, at least for the moment.Unfortunately, we are not all so lucky. At some point our mothers let us go andwe are left alone with our impulses. What we do with them is a major determinantof our success or failure in life. Being successful is as much about inhibitingactions as it is about starting or maintaining them. A car without brakes is adeath trap. A life without brakes, even with great passion, is likely to endearly in failure. Passion is important to fuel our success, while clear goalshelp steer us in the direction we want to go. To stay on track we also need goodbrakes to modulate our movements, to slow us down when we are going too fast, tostop us when we get the urge to take a detour or go in the wrong direction. Weakbrakes cause us to crash, while brakes that are too sticky impede our progress.This chapter will discuss a critical function of the PFC in regard to amagnificent mind—the ability to say no and control our impulses.Prefrontal Cortex—Master BrakesAs discussed earlier, the PFC is involved with higher functions, such asplanning, forethought, and impulse control (see Figure 11.1). The PFC also helpsus to modulate emotions, keeping us from getting too high or too low. As it doesnot fully develop until we are in our midtwenties, we see children and teensbeing much more emotional. When I walked through the door at home after a day atwork when my children were little they would run to greet me with wide open armsand lots of excitement. When they were disappointed, they might cry crocodiletears. As they got older, their emotions were under much better control, plus Iwas not nearly as exciting to them as teenagers.image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_038_r1.jpg]Figure 11.1: The Prefrontal CortexWhen there is damage to the PFC, people often lose tight control over theiremotions. James Brady, President Reagan’s press secretary, offers a dramaticexample. On March 30, 1981, when John Hinckley attempted to assassinatePresident Reagan, Mr. Brady was shot through his frontal lobes. Not only did hesuffer paralysis, but he also had personality changes and became more emotional.His highs were too high and his lows too low. He said during an interview ontelevision that when he was a little sad, he might start to weep uncontrollablyor if he heard something that was slightly funny he might start to laugh as ifit was the funniest thing he had ever heard.Healthy activity in the PFC is associated with conscientiousness; abnormally lowPFC activity is associated with carelessness, inconsistency, troubled decisions,and impulsivity. In reviewing 194 studies researchers from the University ofIllinois at Urbana-Champaign found that increased death rates were associatedwith such impulsive behaviors as tobacco use, diet and activity patterns,excessive alcohol use, violence, risky sexual behavior, risky driving, suicide,and drug use. A healthy PFC is essential for a long and successful life.Abnormalities in the PFC can be the result of inherited conditions, such asADHD, or be the result of damage from brain injuries or toxic exposure. It canalso result from poor training or overly permissive parents.The Short Pause: How Weak Brakes Sabotage Our LivesSaying no to the urges of the moment is often more important than saying yes,even to positive actions. It takes only a moment, a pause, to reflect on theconsequences of our actions to see if they are in our overall best interests.When the little girl paused before she gave in to the urge to splash water allover the table, she was allowed to keep her doll. When you pause before sayingyes to the urge to cheat on your spouse, you are more likely to keep yourmarriage intact. When you pause before saying yes to the urge to tell off anirritating customer, you are more likely to keep your job. When you pause beforetaking money illegally out of the company coffers, you are more likely to stayout of jail. When you pause before saying yes to volunteering for a project ortaking on work that is not directly related to your own goals, you are morelikely to stay focused and be successful. Having the short pause, to thinkthrough an intended comment or action to decide if the behavior fits your goals,is a PFC function and a major key to success.Impulsivity, an inability to inhibit behavior, is at the core of much of thepersonal failure I have witnessed over the past three decades as a psychiatrist.I have seen many people who exhibited impulsive behaviors, such as murderers,robbers, rapists, pedophiles, wife beaters, child abusers, compulsive gamblers,sex addicts, drug and alcohol addicts, bulimics, road ragers, thrill seekers,unfaithful spouses, and countless others. I saw a ten-year-old boy whoimpulsively tried to jump on a moving train, imitating scenes from movies, onlyto slip as he tried to grab the ladder and have both legs amputated by the largesteel wheels as he fell underneath the train. I saw a man who impulsivelystabbed others for no reason. I saw him only when he was shackled. And, I saw awoman who would get in cars with men she didn’t know to have a good time, justbecause she was invited.Thoughtless words and actions, again and again, have caused harm to careers,relationships, and how we feel about ourselves. Impulsivity is at the root ofmany political scandals, sexual harassment issues at work, and fiscalirresponsibility on the job or at home. Let’s look at each area listed in theOne-Page Miracle to see how impulsivity can sabotage lives.RELATIONSHIPSPeople who struggle with impulsivity often say thoughtless, hurtful things thatnegatively affect their relationships. Many of my patients with ADHD, forexample, play this relational game I call “Say the First Thing that Comes toYour Mind.” Some even wear it as a badge of pride. “I am brutally honest,” theysay. I usually reply that it is usually not helpful. Healthy relationshipsrequire tact. They require us to inhibit the first thoughts that come to mind.Once, I walked into my waiting room to greet an eight-year-old patient. I wasabout ten minutes late for the appointment. When she saw me she said, “Well,it’s about damn time.” Her mother looked horrified and apologized for the littlegirl’s comment. Living with ADHD loved ones myself, I knew comments like thatwere just part of the terrain. This game causes many, many problems. When youjust say the first thing that comes to mind, you can hurt someone’s feelings orgive away secrets that were entrusted to you. One of my patients was given thetask of bringing a friend to his surprise birthday party. On the way to theparty my patient inadvertently started talking about how much fun they weregoing to have at the party. When he saw the look on his friend’s face he washorrified that he had ruined the surprise.In addition to saying thoughtless, hurtful things, weak brakes are alsoassociated with frequent interruptions. When someone who struggles withimpulsivity gets a thought in his head he feels like he has to say it, ratherthan waiting for the other person to finish her thought. He believes his pointis so important that he just can’t wait. Once, in a couples session, when Ipointed this behavior out to a woman whose husband was very frustrated by theirpoor communication, she said she had to say what was on her mind or she wouldforget it. It also meant that she wasn’t listening to him. I gave her some paperto write down the thoughts she was afraid she’d forget, so her husband couldcomplete a thought.Other types of impulsivity that hurt relationships include:• Calling people bad names• Lashing out in anger• Throwing tantrums• Exhibiting unpredictable behavior• Answering cell phones or text messages in the middle of having an importantconversation• Having affairs• Saying yes to more projects at work that take you away from home• Becoming involved with Internet pornography when you know it hurts your spouseand takes sexual energy away from her• Lashing out, hitting, or belittling children when they irritate youImpulsivity often ruins work relationships and job potential. Sayingthoughtless, hurtful things to co-workers, vendors, or customers has gotten manypeople terminated. Stealing, sexual indiscretions, drinking on the job, usingInternet access at your workplace to look for another job are just a fewexamples. Impulsivity behind the wheel has caused drivers their lives.WORK/FINANCESAs an employer, I have often thought about doing brain scans on the people Ihire. I have never made a hiring decision based on a scan, but sometimes I wishI had. Eventually, most people who work at the Amen Clinics get scanned, eitherout of curiosity or because they are going through a difficult time, such aspostpartum depression or have suffered a head injury. The results have been veryconsistent. The people who have worked for me who had low PFC activity tended toget into the most trouble, by being late, saying thoughtless, hurtful things toco-workers or patients, making careless mistakes, procrastinating on theirtasks, or getting into trouble with the law. They also tended not to last long.I once treated a doctor who was fired from his county mental health job in SanFrancisco. It usually takes a lot to be fired from these jobs becausepsychiatrists are hard to find. One day he had a patient at 1 P.M. When hisclinic administrator called him at 1:30, because he still had not arrived at theclinic, he told her that he was playing golf in Oregon. He had forgotten aboutthe appointment. That was the last straw. He was fired. A scan revealed he hadvery low PFC activity.Finances are often ruined by impulsivity. One of my first patients came to methirty thousand dollars in debt. She knew her husband would be furious. She hada shopping addiction that she felt she couldn’t control. I have seen manypatients in trouble with the IRS because they did not plan for their taxes. TheIRS does not care if you have a brain problem as the reason for delinquency. Itsagents tend not be impulsive but rather compulsive.SELFImpulsivity hurts our emotional, physical, and spiritual lives. It is ofteninvolved in many psychiatric disorders, such as ADHD, addictions, and temperproblems, which erode self-esteem. It is involved in eating disorders likebulimia and obesity. “I’ll just have one or two bites of the chocolate cake,”for some, turns into eating the whole cake. Impulsivity causes us to give up tooquickly when exercising or meditating (I’ll do it later), and is often involvedin sin, which I define as doing what you know is wrong, according to yourconscience.When the Brakes Come Off: Prozac, Crazy Sex, and Costa RicaSometimes impulsivity can be triggered by taking a medication that lowers yourPFC. Kimberlee was hurting. She was going through chemotherapy for thyroidcancer and felt overwhelmed, tired, and depressed. In her mind, at agetwenty-six, she was supposed to be healthy. She was supposed to be at her best.Yes, she had struggled from an eating disorder in her teens and early twenties,but she thought that she had gotten beyond it. Now this nightmare. Thehopelessness, lack of energy, and beginning weight gain from the thyroiddysfunction were too much to bear. She started purging again and thought herlife was over. Who would ever want her, bulimic, fat, depressed, and withcancer? She was a woman who was desired for her looks. She had long, thick,flowing, dark red hair; soft peach skin; high cheekbones; the face of an angel;and what others would think, but never her, a perfect body. None of thatmattered in this moment. Kimberlee felt anxious, panicky, sad, and hopeless. Shecouldn’t sleep but spent days fretting in bed. On the advice of a worriedfriend, she saw a local psychiatrist. Kimberlee was hesitant to see the doctor,but she was so tired of feeling bad.After filling out a few pages of information and spending forty-five minuteswith the doctor, Kimberlee left the office with a prescription for Prozac at afairly high dose. She wondered how he could know much about her in that shortperiod of time. He mentioned something about situational depression and the needfor the high dose of Prozac to deal with the eating disorder. The appointmentwas a whirlwind and she was unsure about all that he said. She did remember hissaying that the medication had few side effects and she should start to feelbetter in a week or two. With the hope of feeling better she started themedication.Within a few days she started to feel much better. Her energy improved and shestarted to feel optimistic once again. She started going out with her friendsand became more social. “How strange,” she thought. “I feel great because of alittle green and white capsule.” Over the next few weeks she felt better thanshe ever had. Her worries were dissolved and she looked forward to newadventures.She went with friends for an evening of fun at the Beverly Hotel in Los Angeles.There she met an interesting fifty-year-old man, Mark, who was obviouslycaptivated with her. He invited her to his home in the Hollywood Hills. Withinthree days Mark invited her to go with him on a trip to Costa Rica. To her ownsurprise, she agreed, which was completely out of character for this woman whohad been fairly shy her whole life. When she questioned her own judgment aboutgoing to a foreign country with a man she had just met, she thought, “What theheck, it is time to start living.”She had a great time on the trip. Mark was fun and uninhibited. She felt asthough her depression and worries were from a lifetime ago. One night in abustling Costa Rica strip club after a few glasses of wine, Kimberlee foundherself feeling so good that when Mark put his hand on her inner thigh it senteclectic sexual feelings to her inner pelvis and up her spine. She leaned intoMark, moaned encouragement, and kissed him passionately. Feeling herresponsiveness, Mark brought his hand between her legs and stimulated herdirectly. With her eyes closed, Kimberlee was totally focused on the pleasurablefeelings. Her sounds of satisfaction started to fill the club. Soon everyone’seyes were turned toward her as she came to orgasm. When she breathlessly becameaware of her surroundings, she became embarrassed and started to feel horrifiedby her very public behavior.Mark did not turn out to be a good guy for Kimberlee. He left Costa Rica earlythe next morning, leaving a plane ticket on her nightstand. Feeling ashamed ofherself, she boarded a plane to Miami on her way back to Los Angeles. On thefirst leg of the flight she sat in first class. When the pilot walked by herseat, he smiled at her. Kimberlee was too tired and too upset to care. Thestewardess in first class told her that the pilot would love to meet her. Afterseveral attempts to say no, Kimberlee agreed to have a drink with him at theMiami airport.They hit it off and drank several glasses of wine and talked for hours. When heinvited her to his hotel room, she went. They had passionate, intense sex allnight. On her flight home the next day, she began to hate the person she wasbecoming. What happened to her judgment? Her morals? Her good sense?Connecting the change in her behavior to starting Prozac, she stopped themedication and on the advice of a friend came to see me at the Amen Clinics.When I saw Kimberlee it was clear that the Prozac had disinhibited her. It tookthe lid off of her judgment and impulse control, as well as her internal moralcompass. When we performed SPECT scans of her brain off the Prozac, they showedus that, in fact, Prozac was the worst possible choice for her. Her scans showedlow activity in her PFC. Her internal supervisor was weak and could not controlthe passions of the moment. It could not see long-term consequences.Prozac and medications like it, called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,increase the availability of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, whichhelps to calm the brain. Prozac is most effective for people whose PFC works toohard, causing them to be inflexible, worried, obsessed, and rigid. When Prozacworks, it helps calm the PFC to help people feel more relaxed, happier, and lessanxious. If the PFC is already characterized by low activity, however, givingProzac to someone like Kimberlee lowers her PFC even further, therebydisinhibiting her and causing serious problems in her life. Kimberlee needed herPFC stimulated, not relaxed. How would the doctor know unless he looked? Images11.2 and 11.3 show a depressed woman’s brain before and after Prozac. Notice themarked decreased PFC activity.image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_039_r1.jpg]Image 11.2: Before Prozacimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_040_r1.jpg]Image 11.3: After ProzacAs I wrote in Sex on the Brain, the brain is a sneaky organ. All of us haveweird, crazy, sexual, stupid, unhelpful, dishonest, hurtful, even violentthoughts. Thankfully, our PFC inhibits these sneaky thoughts and prevents usfrom saying them or acting upon them. When this part of the brain works right wecan laugh at or dismiss these sneaky thoughts. When there is dysfunction,damage, or disease to this part of the brain, these hurtful, embarrassingthoughts surface in our behavior.Subtle Ways That Weak Brakes Can Sabotage SuccessIn Jim Collins’s best-selling book, Good to Great, the hedgehog concept is oneof the major principles behind why companies go from good companies to greatones. The concept is about razor-sharp focus. The idea for this principle camefrom Isaiah Berlin’s famous essay “The Hedgehog and the Fox” that divided theworld into hedgehogs and foxes, based upon an ancient Greek parable: “The foxknows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.” Those who led lesseffective companies tended to be foxes, never gaining the clarifying advantageof a hedgehog, being instead scattered, diffuse, and inconsistent. Too oftenbusiness, family, or personal leaders are involved in too many activities andget distracted by the excitement of the moment, which takes time and attentionaway from their primary goals.In a similar way, General Electric’s legendary CEO Jack Welch became famous fora particular business strategy. If the company was not No. 1 or No. 2 in amarket and could not get there in a short period of time, he sold or closed thebusiness unit, even if it was making money. He wanted the company to achievetotal focus on what it did right to optimize their efforts. During his twentyyears of leadership at General Electric, Welch increased the value of thecompany from thirteen billion dollars to several hundred billion. Weak brakesimpair our focus and get us involved in many different things that have littleto do with our goals.A lack of clear focus and being distractible causes us to say yes to trivial orless important activities, which robs time and energy from more important ones.Raccoons with shiny objects come to mind. I had two pet raccoons growing up.Whenever these furry, masked creatures saw something shiny they had to explore.This is where our new technology is scattering our attention and focus. As wepop on the Internet to do our work, many of us must first check out our newspages, see who has e-mailed us, turn on the music and download a song or two,see if our Internet dating sites have produced anyone interesting, and then getten instant messages from friends who are also on. It often takes people half anhour or more to get to their work. Many also leave their e-mail notifications onwhile working, so they are constantly interrupted. These interruptions erode ourbrakes.Strengthen Your BrakesWhenever you give in to your impulses and lose your focus, you actually weakenthe PFC’s control over your life and make the behaviors more likely to occuragain. When you resist negative behaviors you strengthen the PFC and your ownself-control. Resisting the temptation to waste time or engage in activitiesthat are worthless or harmful makes you stronger. Repetitively doing positiveactivities makes them more likely to occur. Disciplined behavior increasesdiscipline.Psychiatrist Lewis Baxter, in a series of breakthrough experiments at UCLA,found that when he prevented obsessive-compulsive-disordered patients fromengaging in their senseless repetitive thoughts or behaviors it actually changedthe brain’s function in a positive way, working in a way similar to medication.Changing your thoughts and behaviors changes your brain. Give in to uselessbehaviors and you are more likely to keep doing them. Engage in more usefulbehaviors and you will be more likely to continue them. Your moment-by-momentactions program your brain’s actual function.It starts early in life. As I mentioned earlier, when you allow a child to whineto get their way, you actually teach the child’s brain to whine. When you givein to a temper tantrum, you teach the child’s brain to have more tantrums as away to get what he or she wants. Giving in to bad behavior disinhibits behaviorand weakens the PFC, as the child does not have to exercise any self-control.The brain is like a muscle, and the more one uses it, the stronger it gets. Thebrain, also like muscles, has memory. Giving a child clear, consistent,reasonable consequences for negative behavior while reinforcing positivebehaviors enhances development in the PFC. So many behavior problems in childrenare due to erratic or absent parenting. The lack of effective parenting setschildren up to have problems their whole lives. Parents act as a child’s PFCuntil his or her own PFC develops. Strengthening the brakes starts early. In asimilar way, providing employees with adequate supervision, feedback,consequences, and reinforcement helps them perform better at work. Of course,too much supervision, or micromanagement, lessens productivity.Here are five things you can do to increase your brakes, PFC, and impulsecontrol.1. Work on developing a great brain. Enhancing brain function makes everythingin your life easier, including impulse control. Exercise, good nutrition, newlearning, taking a multiple vitamin and fish oil supplement are all strategiesto help overall brain health. Along the same lines, stop any behaviors such asexcessive alcohol use, lack of sleep, smoking, excessive TV, or video games.Also, treat any conditions that negatively affect the PFC, such as ADHD,depression, or brain trauma.2. Read your One-Page Miracle every day. Ask yourself repeatedly throughout theday if your behavior is getting you what you want. Do your words and deeds matchyour desires? This exercise helps develop clarity and decreases unwanted oruseless behaviors. Remember, your One-Page Miracle needs to be your goals anddesires, not someone else’s. As such, they are most likely to motivate you tostay on track toward your goals, but you must make them a part of your dailylife. Your brain needs to see them every day. If you know that you want a kind,caring, loving relationship with your spouse, then even when you are stressed orirritated you are likely to act in ways that are helpful to your relationship.3. Develop razor-sharp focus. Get rid of the things in your life that do not fityour goals. One of my friends, Timothy, an entertainment attorney who representsauthors, complained that he did not have time for his family. He had athree-year-old daughter, Larissa, who adored her father but had recently beenacting up. Her mother said she was having more tantrums during the day andappeared sullen. Larissa complained she wanted to see her daddy more, but heusually got home after she went to bed. Timothy struggled with guilt but alsofelt the need to build his business. There were too many things happening atwork that he felt he could not let go. Knowing that I was a child psychiatrist,he wondered if she had ADHD or another behavior problem. After hearing thestory, I thought that she might just be missing her daddy, like she said. I didthe One-Page Miracle exercise with Timothy. Clearly, his wife and daughter werevery important to him. Then I asked him to be aware of all his activities atwork for a week. Keeping detailed notes on his activities each day, he couldtell he was wasting time: he walked to the coffee shop twice a day for drinks,three or four times a week he went to lunch with friends, and he constantly tookphone calls from colleagues who had questions about their businesses. Indefining his work goals, I asked him what were the most important things for himto be doing at work. What were the tasks and activities that built and sustainedhis business? He wrote three things:• Take great care of my current clients.• Develop new clients.• Spend 10 percent of my time in pro bono work.I suggested that anything unrelated to these three goals he needed to let go. Heunderstood the concept of total focus. He could bring his coffee to work(preferably decaf), he could limit lunch with friends to once a week, and hecould allow his voice mail to screen calls from his nonpaying clients. Within amonth, he was coming home earlier and spending more time with his wife anddaughter. Larissa’s behavior dramatically improved. Spend time on the thingsthat matter.4. Know that saying no is okay. Too often, people feel anxious about saying noto someone. Many people, like me if I am not careful, are people pleasers. Itbothers us when someone is upset with us, so we work hard to please others. Wedo not want to upset anyone. Somehow we believe that their unhappiness reflectsbadly on us. One concept that has helped me personally in this area I actuallylearned from my friend Timothy in the above story. He taught me to think interms of “short-term pain versus long-term pain.” About the time I was helpinghim with Larissa, my oldest daughter asked me for another puppy. I had alwayshad trouble saying no to her, but we had three other animals at home. When Idiscussed the situation with Timothy, he said, “Do you want short-term pain orlong-term pain?” As he explained it, a puppy was potentially a fifteen-yeardecision, while saying no to Breanne was a disappointment that would likely lasthours, days, or (worst-case scenario) weeks. It made so much sense, so the puppyfound another home.The principle of short-term pain versus long-term pain has helped me in manyareas of my life from weight loss to relationships. When I look at the ice creamand feel hungry, I ask myself, “Is the hunger I’m feeling now (short-term pain)worth courting obesity, a condition that runs in my family (long-term pain)?” Atwork, if I need to fire an employee who is not working out, I often thinkshort-term pain (the discomfort of letting someone go) versus long-term pain(the continuing hassles of having to deal with an ineffective employee).Whenever you find yourself in a quandary about what to do with an uncomfortablesituation, just ask yourself, “Short-term versus long-term pain?”5. Learn the phrase “I need to think about it. If I want to do it, I will getback to you.” So many of my patients have trouble saying no, and theyimpulsively say yes and end up taking on more than they can do, distracting themfrom their goals. Sometimes they take on so many things that they end up doingnothing. When you are not sure what to do, you do not necessarily have to tellpeople no. A better answer frequently is “I have to think about it.” Or “I needto talk to my board (or staff or spouse).” Give yourself time to make decisionsabout time. Then ask yourself whether the new task or request fits the goals youhave for your life. Two quotes from Oprah Winfrey can be helpful to drive thispoint home.One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned recently is that when you don’t knowwhat to do, you should do nothing until you figure out what to do because a lotof times you feel like you are pressed against the wall, and you’ve got to makea decision. You never have to do anything. Don’t know what to do? Do nothing.I didn’t want to say “No” because I didn’t want people to think I’m not nice.And that, to me, has been the greatest lesson of my life: to recognize that I amsolely responsible for it, and not trying to please other people, and not livingmy life to please other people, but doing what my heart says all the time.Use these five tips to gain more control over your PFC and impulses; developingtotal focus will get you much closer to your goals and overall happiness."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_041_r1.jpg]Embrace the Truthimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]LIBERATE YOURSELF FROM THE LIES POLLUTING YOUR BRAINWe have met the enemy and he is us.—POGO POSSUMYou can’t empty your mind of thoughts. You might as well try to empty the oceanof its water. Thoughts just keep coming back, it seems. That’s the way of it.But thoughts aren’t a problem if they’re met with understanding.—BYRON KATIE, A Thousand Names for JoyA number of years ago I wrote an article for Parade magazine called “How to GetOut of Your Own Way.” After the article was published my office received overten thousand letters asking for more information about self-defeating behavior.CNN heard about the response and asked me to be on one of its shows. At thetime, I had never been on TV, but I agreed to do it because I thought it mighthelp spread the news of my work. In the green room waiting to go on, I had apanic attack. I couldn’t catch my breath, my heart raced, and I wanted to runout of the studio. Fortunately, the little voice in my head started to laugh atme and said, “You treat people who have this problem. What do you tell them todo?”“Breathe! Slow down your breathing.” People who have panic attacks breathe toofast; by slowing down your breathing you start to get control over yourself. Idid that and felt calmer.Next I thought, “Don’t leave. If you leave the studio, you will never come backand the fear will take control of you and you will never be on TV again.” So Ididn’t leave.Then I thought, “Write down the first three thoughts in your head to see ifyou’re scaring yourself. If you are, talk back to those thoughts.” My firstthought was “You are going to forget your name.” Now that was funny, because whywould an interviewer have to ask the name of an invited guest? The secondthought was “You are going to stutter,” and the third thought was “Two millionpeople are going to think you are an idiot.” I chuckled to myself. No wonder Iwanted to run out of the studio. My brain was playing a horror film with me asthe main victim.Fortunately for me, I knew how to talk back to these thoughts. You do not haveto believe every thought you have. Thoughts lie. They lie a lot. Just becauseyou have a thought has nothing to do with whether or not it is true. I had beenteaching my patients something I call ANT therapy for years. ANT stands for“automatic negative thought,” and like ants at a picnic, the ANTs in your headcan ruin your day. In ANT therapy, whenever your feel sad, mad, or nervous, youwrite down the thoughts going through your mind and evaluate whether or not theyare true. If they are not true, talk back to them. You do not have to believe oraccept every thought you have. You need an internal ANTeater on patrol.So, in the CNN studio in Los Angeles, I took out a piece of paper, just like Iwould tell my patients to do, and did the ANTeater exercise. I drew two linesvertically down the paper, dividing it into three columns. In the first column Iwrote down the thoughts, unedited as they occurred in my brain. In the secondcolumn I wrote the type of ANT it was. In my work, I have described ninedifferent types of ANTs (see box on Chapter 12). In the third column, I killedthe ANTs by talking back to them. Were you good at talking back to your parentswhen you were a teenager? I was excellent. In the same way, you need to learn tobe good at talking back to the lies you tell yourself.So in the first column I wrote the initial thought: “You are going to forgetyour name.” In the middle column I wrote, “Fortune-telling,” because I waspredicting the worst, the most common ANT among people who have panic attacks.In the third column, I wrote, “Probably not. I have never forgotten my name. Butif I do, I have my driver’s license in my wallet.” Playing with the thoughtshelp to see how absurd they can be.Below the first ANT I wrote out the second one: “You are going to stutter.” Inthe middle column I wrote, “Fortune-telling,” because I was still predictingdisaster in the future. And in the third column I wrote, “Probably not. Iusually don’t stutter, but if I do there will be people who stutter in theaudience who will now have a doctor they can relate to.” Having fun with thethoughts helps you disarm them.SUMMARY OF NINE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANTS1. Always Thinking: Overgeneralizing a situation and usually starting thoughtswith words like always, never, everyone, every time2. Focusing on the Negative: Preoccupying yourself with what’s going wrong in asituation and ignoring everything that could be construed as positive3. Fortune-telling: Predicting the future in a negative way4. Mind Reading: Arbitrarily believing you know what another person thinks, eventhough they have not told you5. Thinking with Your Feelings: Believing your negative feelings without everquestioning them6. Guilt Beatings: Thinking with words like should, must, ought, or have to thatproduce feelings of guilt7. Labeling: Attaching a negative label to yourself or others8. Personalization: Allowing innocuous events to take on personal meaning9. Blame: Blaming other people for the problems in your lifeThen I wrote the last thought: “Two million people will think you are an idiot.”In the middle column I wrote, “Fortune telling.” Again, I was predicting theworst. In the third column, I wrote, “Maybe so.” Then next to it I wrote threenumbers, 18-40-60, which stands for a rule I teach my patients, called the18-40-60 rule, which says that when you are age eighteen you worry about whateveryone thinks of you, when you are age forty you don’t give a damn what anyonethinks about you, and when you’re age sixty you realize no one has been thinkingabout you at all. People spend their days worrying and thinking aboutthemselves, not you.This five-minute exercise helped me relax and I was able to go on the televisionshow and do well. If I would have run out of the studio, I would have likelynever gone back and it would have dramatically changed my life and career.Negative Thoughts Change Your Brain and Your LifeDo not let your thoughts prevent you from having a magnificent mind. Learn howto talk back to them. The ANT technique described above is not hard. I oncetaught it to a nine-year-old boy who suffered from terrible anxiety anddepression. After several weeks he told me he was feeling much better. He said,“It’s an ANT ghost town in my head.”Here is an example from his ANT therapy. He worried incessantly that his motherwould die and leave him alone. This is not an uncommon worry for children whosuffer with anxiety disorders. We did the ANT exercise together in my office.ANTType of ANTANTeaterMy mother will die and leave me alone.Fortune-tellingI have no way of knowing that. My thoughts are making me sick. She could live avery long time.Internal logic is one of the most important brain skills we will ever need. Itis the ability to tell ourselves the truth, to be completely honest and logicalwith ourselves. It is a course we should have all taken repeatedly, like Englishor math, starting in the third grade. Yet nowhere are we ever taught how toquestion our own thoughts, how to correct the erroneous words and images thatcircle in our minds, torturing and tormenting our souls. So much trouble isstirred up by the lies we tell ourselves and few people know how easy it is tocorrect them.Nearly all of us have suffered an inordinate amount of fear, anxiety, terror,and depression as a result of the unquestioned thoughts generated by our brains.Thoughts that are downright lies. It is hard to be effective directing a life, afamily, or a business with distorted negative thinking patterns. Yet in myexperience, most people walk around infested by ANTs, and they don’t have theskills needed to rid themselves of these pesky creatures. They have no idea thatthe source of their suffering is within their own synapses.How you think moment by moment plays a primary role in how you feel.Predominantly negative thoughts cause you to feel bad, while positive or hopefulones help you to feel good. In this chapter, I will give you a thinking tune-up.I will teach you how to tell yourself the truth to improve brain function andyour overall sense of well-being. To start, here are five simple facts to helpyou begin to manage your thoughts and emotions.FACT 1Did you know that every time you have a thought your brain releases chemicals?That’s how your brain works. You have a thought, your brain releases chemicals,an electrical transmission goes across your brain, and you become aware of whatyou’re thinking. Thoughts are real and they have a real impact on how you feeland how you behave. Like a muscle, the thoughts that you exercise becomestronger and become the thoughts you rely on and believe, good or bad.Every time you have an angry, unkind, hopeless, helpless, worthless, sad, orirritating thought, your brain releases negative chemicals that make you feelbad. Think about the last time you were mad. How did your body feel? When mostpeople get angry, their muscles become tense, their hearts beat faster, theirhands start to sweat, and they may even begin to feel a little dizzy. Your bodyreacts to every negative thought you have.Every time you have a happy, hopeful, kind, optimistic, positive thought, yourbrain releases chemicals that make you feel good. Think about the last time youhad a really happy thought. How did you feel inside your body? When most peopleare happy their muscles relax, their hearts beat slower, their hands become dry,and they breathe slower. Your body also reacts to your good thoughts.Mark George, M.D., when he worked at the National Institutes of Mental Health,demonstrated this phenomenon in an elegant study of brain function. He studiedthe activity of the brain in ten normal women under three different conditions:when they were thinking happy thoughts, neutral thoughts, and sad thoughts.During the happy thoughts, the women demonstrated a cooling of their emotionalbrain and they felt better. During the sad thoughts, he noticed a significantincrease in the emotional brain’s activity, which is consistent with depression.Your thoughts matter.FACT 2Your body reacts to every thought you have. We know this from polygraph or liedetector equipment. During a lie detector test, a person is hooked up toequipment that measures the following.• Hand temperature• Heart rate• Blood pressure• Breathing rate• Muscle tension• How much the hands sweatThe tester then asks questions, like “Did you do that thing?” If the person didthe bad thing his body is likely to have a “stress” response and it is likely toreact in the following ways.• Hands get colder.• Heart goes faster.• Blood pressure goes up.• Breathing gets faster.• Muscles get tight.• Hands sweat more.Almost immediately, his body reacts to what he thinks, whether he says anythingor not. Now the opposite is also true. If he did not do the thing the testerasked about, it is likely that his body will experience a “relaxation” responseand react in the following ways.• Hands will become warmer.• Heart rate will slow.• Blood pressure goes down.• Breathing becomes slower and deeper.• Muscles become more relaxed.• Hands become drier.Again, almost immediately, your body reacts to what you think. This not onlyhappens when you’re asked about telling the truth, your body reacts to everythought you have, whether it is about work, friends, family, or anything else.FACT 3Thoughts are very powerful. They can make your mind and your body feel good orthey can make you feel bad. Every cell in your body is affected by every thoughtyou have. That is why when people get emotionally upset, they actually developphysical symptoms, such as headaches or stomachaches. Some physicians think thatpeople who have a lot of negative thoughts are more likely to get cancer. If youcan think about good things you are more likely to feel better.Think of your body as an ecosystem. An ecosystem contains everything in theenvironment, including water, land, cars, people, animals, vegetation, houses,landfills, and so on. A negative thought is like pollution to your system. Justas pollution in the Los Angeles Basin affects everyone who goes outside, so toodo negative thoughts pollute your mind and your body.FACT 4Unless you think about your thoughts, they are automatic or “they just happen.”Since they just happen, they are not necessarily correct. Your thoughts do notalways tell the truth. Sometimes they lie to you. I once treated a collegestudent who thought he was stupid, because he didn’t perform well on tests. Whenhe was tested, however, we discovered that he had an IQ of 135, very bright. Youdon’t have to believe every thought that goes through your head. It’s importantto think about your thoughts to see if they are helping you or hurting you.Unfortunately, if you never challenge your thoughts, you just believe them as ifthey were true.One negative thought, like one ant at a picnic, is not a big problem. Two orthree negative thoughts, like two or three ants at a picnic, become moreirritating. Ten or twenty negative thoughts, like ten or twenty ants at apicnic, may cause the couple to pick up and leave the picnic.FACT 5You can learn to eliminate ANTs and replace them with positive thoughts that arenot “pie in the sky” thinking but rather true, real, accurate thoughts that giveyou peace, encouragement, and a fair assessment of your current situation. Thisskill alone could completely change your life if you embrace and practice it.Once you learn about your thoughts, you can choose to think good thoughts andfeel good or you can choose to think bad thoughts and feel lousy. That’sright—it’s up to you! You can learn how to change your thoughts and change theway you feel. One way to learn how to change your thoughts is to notice themwhen they are negative and talk back to them. If you can correct negativethoughts, you take away their power over you. When you just think a negativethought without challenging it, your mind believes it and your body reacts toit.Whenever you notice these ANTs, you need to crush them or they’ll ruin yourrelationships, your self-esteem, and your personal power. So here is theexercise: Whenever you feel sad, mad, or nervous write out the automaticthoughts in your mind. Then ask yourself if any of them are ANTs, if any aredistorted. What type of ANTs are they? Then kill each ANT by talking back to it.You do not have to believe every thought you have! In fact, if you do, they willsurely make you sick.The Work: Another TechniqueAs I wrote earlier, a number of years ago I went through an emotionally painfultime in my life after I lost someone important to me. I felt terrible for almostnine months, despite all of the emotional management skills I had developed overthe years. I had trouble sleeping, felt sad and anxious, and suffered crushingchest pain. Hard as I tried, I couldn’t get the other person out of my head. Inmy search for healing I read at least fifty books about grief. None of them madea bit of difference until I read Loving What Is by Byron Katie.In this very wise book, written with her husband, accomplished author StephenMitchell, Katie, as her friends call her, described her own experience sufferingfrom suicidal depression. She was a young mother, business-woman, and wife inthe high desert of Southern California. She became severely depressed at the ageof thirty-three. For ten years, she sank deeper and deeper into self-loathing,rage, despair, constant thoughts of suicide, and paranoia. For the last twoyears, she was often unable to leave her bedroom and care for herself or herfamily. Then one morning in 1986, out of nowhere, Katie woke up in a state ofamazement, transformed by the realization that when she believed her thoughts,she suffered, but when she questioned her thoughts, she didn’t suffer. Katie’sgreat insight is that it is not life or other people that make us feeldepressed, angry, abandoned, and despairing but our thoughts that make us feelthat way. In other words, we live in a hell of our own making, or we live in aheaven of our own making.Katie developed a simple method of inquiry—the Work—to question our thoughts. Itconsists of writing down any of the thoughts that are bothering us or any of thethoughts in which we are judging other people, then asking ourselves fourquestions, and then doing a turnaround. The goal is not positive thinking butrather accurate thinking. The four questions are:1. Is it true? (Is the stressful or negative thought true?)2. Can I absolutely know that it’s true?3. How do I react when I believe that thought?4. Who would I be without the thought? Or how would I feel if I didn’t have thethought?After you answer the four questions, you then take the original thought andcompletely turn it around to its opposite, and ask yourself whether the oppositeof the original thought that is causing your suffering is not true or eventruer. Then, turn the thought around and apply it to yourself (how does theopposite of the thought apply to me personally) and to the other person, if oneis involved in the thought (how does the turnaround apply to the other person).When I personally started to do the Work I immediately felt better. I was morerelaxed, less anxious, and more honest in dealing with my own thoughts andemotions. Katie and Stephen have since become friends and I have shared theirinsights with almost all of my own friends and patients. You will notice thatthere are similarities between the Work and ANT therapy. The Work is alsopowerful, easy to learn, and very effective.For example, I had a mild-mannered, charming patient named Nile who loved hisgirlfriend very much. She was beautiful, brilliant, passionate, and generous.But the downside of their love affair was that the girlfriend’s bad moodssuddenly manifested as intensely and unpredictably as tornadoes. When hisgirlfriend was on a tear, she lashed out at Nile, finding fault with everythingfrom his earning power to his taste in clothes. Accusing him of selfishness andof taking her for granted, she often made his life miserable. Understandably,Nile lived in constant apprehension and stress. Whenever his girlfriend had atemper tantrum, he suffered from headaches and stomach pains. Nile’s thoughtsabout his girlfriend were literally making him sick!In one part of his mind, Nile knew it was time to end the relationship. But hefelt powerless to break things off because another part of him still loved hisgirlfriend.I had Nile begin the Work with the statement “I do not want to break up with mygirlfriend.”Well, when I asked him if this was true, he immediately said, “No, I have toleave her because this relationship is making me sick.”Okay. But did he know this to be absolutely true? “I have the psychiatrist billsto prove it,” he joked. “But seriously, sometimes it feels like I’m losing mymind.”And how did he react when he thought “I do not want to break up with her”?“My hands start sweating, I feel tense all over, I’m stressed out.”I invited Nile to turn the thought around and find three examples to see if thiswere more true than the original stressful thought.“I do want to break up with my girlfriend,” he started. “I’m tired of walking oneggshells all the time. And I’m sick of churning out stomach acid whenever sheflips out. Even though I love her, she’s bad for my health and I think I deservebetter,” he concluded.Asking the four questions and doing the turnaround helped Nile realize that hewas breaking up with his girlfriend in order to reclaim his peace of mind,health, and autonomy. When he eventually told her that he had to end therelationship, Nile felt a huge burden had been lifted from his life. Hisheadaches and stomachaches stopped and he started dating again, with a strongersense of self.If you want to know yourself, write down your stressful thoughts, fourquestions, and the turnaround about someone else. Point the Work toward othersin the beginning, and you will soon see that everything outside you directlyreflects your own thinking. Yes, your thoughts are all about you, and veryoften, they are completely disconnected from your reality, or “what actuallyis.” This strategic form of thinking and questioning your thoughts directly putsa close-up lens on the reality of your life, which is always a good thing,because the truth can set you free.Truth in the Courtroom of Your MindOne of the other exercises many of my patients have found helpful in quellingthe critics in their heads and boosting their self-esteem is one I call “Truthin the Courtroom of Your Mind.” It takes a bit of effort, but you are worth thetime it takes. Do the following steps.1. Take a piece of paper and draw out a courtroom scene. Include the judge,prosecuting attorneys, defense lawyers, defendant, court reporter, witnessstand, and jury box. This is a drawn representation of the voices in your head.2. Choose a crime that you mentally accuse yourself of. It can be anything youfeel guilty about, or anything you’ve actually done of which you’re ashamed.3. Put yourself on trial. Actually begin to write out the dialogue of a trial.Have opening statements by the prosecutor and the defense. Call witnesses. Raiseobjections. At first, notice the strength of your internal prosecuting attorney;after all, he’s had practice accusing you all these years. However, as you writeout the trial, you’ll begin to notice the lies your prosecutor tells in thecourtroom. He distorts the truth to make you look worse.4. Strengthen your defense attorney. Instead of the wimp he has been, make himstand tall and defend you with eloquence instead of silence. Hire the bestlawyer in the world to help defend you. You’re worth it.5. Repeat this exercise several times, until you have sufficiently strengthenedyour defense attorney.Some have written two pages of dialogue, but I have one patient who wrote fortypages. Do what helps you. One person who performed this exercise wrote, “This isfun. I hired a whole gang—Clarence Darrow, Daniel Webster, Melvin Belli, BellaAbzug, Johnnie Cochran, and Perry Mason. Then I gave the prosecution HamiltonBurger, who has never won a case, and a guy I used to know who became the worstlawyer ever to pass the bar. Every time old Burger is about to make a point, myold friend trips him up. He forgets to file papers and summon witnesses too.”After you’ve tried this exercise several times on paper, begin to set up thisscenario in your head: Identify your accusing voices (can you match them up toyour accusers of the past?), and identify and strengthen those voices that rootfor you and defend you. Our prosecuting attorneys can also work in our bestinterest. They do that by bringing up important issues we need to look at, butthey do it in such a way as to help us learn from our mistakes rather thanbeating us up for them. The commentary these inner voices provide on our actionscan either enhance or sabotage our chances for success. Train your inner voicesto work in your own best interest. After all, they are your voices; put themunder your control.The Truth About GratitudeWhen you bring your attention to the things you are grateful for in your life,your brain actually works better. Psychologist Noelle Nelson and I did a studyon gratitude and appreciation. She was working on a book called The Power ofAppreciation and had her brain scanned twice. The first time she was scannedafter thirty minutes of meditating on all the things she was thankful for in herlife. Then she was scanned several days later after focusing on the major fearsin her life. After the “appreciation meditation,” her brain looked very healthy.On the day of her “fear-based meditation,” Noelle took the exercise veryseriously. One of her fears was about what would happen if her dog got sick andshe couldn’t work. She had a string of frightening thoughts.“If my dog got sick, I couldn’t go to work because I would have to stay home tocare for him.”“If I didn’t go to work, however, I would lose my job.”“If I lost my job, I wouldn’t have enough money to take my dog to the vet and hewould likely die.”“If the dog died, I would be so depressed I still wouldn’t be able to go back towork.”“Then I would lose my home and be homeless.”After these thoughts I scanned her brain. Her frightened brain looked verydifferent from her grateful brain. Rather than look healthy, she had seriouslydecreased activity in two parts of her brain. Her cerebellum, in the back partof the brain, completely shut down. The cerebellum, also called the littlebrain, is known to be involved in physical coordination, such as walking orplaying sports. New research also suggests that the cerebellum is involved inprocessing speed, like clock speed on a computer and thought coordination or howquickly we can integrate new information. When the cerebellum experiences lowactivity, people tend to be clumsier and less likely to think their ways out ofproblems. They think and process information more slowly and they get confusedmore easily. When I saw this finding, I thought that this was why negativethinking is involved in athletic slumps. If an athlete thinks he will fail,likely he will. I now had proof that negative thinking actually shuts down thecoordination part of the brain. The other area of the brain that was affectedwas the temporal lobes, especially the one on the left. The temporal lobes areinvolved with mood, memory, and temper control. Problems in this part of thebrain are associated with some forms of depression and also dark thoughts,violence, and memory problems. In Noelle’s scans, when she practiced gratitude,her temporal lobes looked healthy. When she frightened herself, her temporallobes became much less active. Negative thought patterns change the brain in anegative way. Practicing gratitude literally helps you have a brain to begrateful for.Here is the exercise: Write out five things you are grateful for every day. Theact of writing helps to solidify them in your brain. In my experience, whendepressed patients do this exercise daily they actually needed lessantidepressant medication. Other researchers have also found that people whoexpress gratitude on a regular basis are healthier, more optimistic, make moreprogress toward their goals, have a greater sense of well-being, and are morehelpful to others. Doctors who regularly practice gratitude are actually betterat making the correct diagnoses on their patients.When you tell yourself the truth, your brain works better and you feel and acthappier. Using the ANTeater exercises and the Work, along with having acompetent internal defense attorney and focusing on gratitude, are essentialskills to keep your brain healthy and encourage success in everything you do."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_042_r1.jpg]Get Unstuckimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]ENHANCE YOUR BRAIN’S ABILITY TO CHANGE AND ADAPTHe who rejects change is the architect of decay.—HAROLD WILSONThe bend in the road is not the end of the road unless you refuse to take theturn.—AnonymousDoing something the way that it has always been done does not mean you will besuccessful doing it the same way going forward, even if you were wildlysuccessful doing it that way in the past. Business consultant Tom Peters writesthat we are in the greatest change revolution perhaps of the last thousandyears. Change will be the norm, not the exception. To be successful in thecoming world environment, it is critical to be mentally flexible and to changeas change is needed. Minds trapped in the past, or even minds trapped in thepresent moment, will be left behind.Trouble Getting UnstuckIn 2005 fisherman Jim Peterson was eighty miles off the coast of Newport,Oregon, when the engine of his sixty-year-old wooden troller became stuck inreverse. Even though he tried and tried, the gears would not shift. Far from hishome port of Coos Bay, Jim weighed his options: wait hours for the Coast Guardto tow him home, wait for help from other fishermen, or drive the boat all theway back in reverse. Jim decided not to wait. “It was odd,” he told theRegister-Guard of Eugene, “watching the wake roll out the front windows. Likewatching a movie in reverse.” More foreign still, Jim said, was trying to steerthe thirty-eight-foot boat. “It was like backing up a truck towing a trailer,with extra motion underneath.” Getting home was a thirty-nine-hour ordeal, threetimes the normal time it should take.Being stuck in reverse, obsessing about the past, or being unable to shiftmental gears in the present is extremely common among people who struggle inrelationships, at work or within themselves. Change is very hard for them. Thebrain, like a car or a boat, has gear-shifting mechanisms. When an engine isstuck in first, it uses excessive energy, whines loudly, and doesn’t get veryfar. When an engine is stuck in reverse it can be downright dangerous. Smoothshifting is a prerequisite to an easy ride. In a similar way, when your braingets stuck you use too much energy, whine loudly, and do not make much progressin your life. Trouble shifting your attention can lead to disastrous results andinhibits change.Through the decades of both my clinical practice and business work I have seenpeople’s brains get stuck in many different ways, often involving being stuck inthe past, present, or future. Healthy change becomes impossible. Here are someexamples.• Being stuck in the past—Holding grudges, being unforgiving, holding on toemotional pain or regrets, having unresolved grief or trauma, and exhibiting lowself-esteem from repetitively judging their own past behavior. In business,tightly holding on to the ways a company has always done things, even thoughthey may be outdated or harmful.• Being stuck in the present—Being oppositional and argumentative; have to havetheir own way; are uncooperative and selfish; and feel trapped in a difficultrelationship, stressful job, an addiction, or an obsession. In business, beingrigid or unyielding in policies or procedures.• Being stuck in the future—For individuals, worrying, being fearful, predictingthe worst, and exhibiting insecurity. In business, not taking appropriate risksfor fear of failure, seeing fear in the future, and being overprotective.When you are stuck in a position, you are not moving your life forward.Business, family, and personal success require change, flexibility, and theability to transition. Being able to move fluidly through your life is anability of a magnificent mind. This ability, in part, involves a section of thebrain we have discussed earlier, called the anterior cingulate gyrus, or ACG,the brain’s gear shifter (see Figure 13.1).image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_043_r1.jpg]Figure 13.1: Inside View of the Anterior Cingulate GyrusIt is involved with cognitive flexibility and helps people shift their attentionfrom task to task or idea to idea. When this part of the brain is healthy peopleare able to see options to situations, they are able to go with the flow, changeas needed, and move easily from idea to idea. They are more likely to beinclusive and cooperative with others. When the ACG is low in activity, peoplestruggle with attention. Low ACG activity has been found in brain imagingstudies in people with ADHD. When the ACG is damaged or hurt some people developa syndrome called akinetic mutism, which is associated with low motivation andless verbalization or speech. When the ACG is high, people have trouble shiftingattention and tend to get stuck on negative thoughts or repetitive behaviors.Getting stuck is associated with being inflexible, rigid, oppositional,argumentative, having trouble with transitions, worrying, holding grudges, andeven struggling with obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors. People withhigh ACG activity struggle with transitions and hate when things do not go asexpected. Other people often feel diminished or controlled in the presence ofthose with high ACG activity.The ACG is also involved with error detection. When it is healthy, people willnotice when things are wrong or out of place and work to fix them. When the ACGworks too hard, anything out of place will drive them nuts. A person with highACG activity will also have a tendency to notice what’s wrong in his or her lifeand put pressure on those they love and work with to be perfect. This can be ahealthy trait, as in the case of a neurosurgeon or Olympic athlete, where it isessential that techniques are perfect. It can also lead to life ruin when itgets out of control. For example, I once saw a neurosurgeon who was technicallya genius at work but a disaster at home. He badgered his wife and children to beperfect. When his wife finally left him, he stalked her. He could not get herout of his head and felt that she must come home in order for him to feel okay.High activity in the ACG has been associated with low availability of theneurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. In fact, medications that increaseserotonin, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), calm thispart of the brain on SPECT studies. Many psychiatric disorders have shownexcessive activity in the ACG, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),post-traumatic stress disorder, addictions, oppositional defiant disorder,obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, autistic spectrum disorders, andcertain forms of depression. SSRIs have been used in all of these disorders withvarying levels of success. Even though these might seem like a wide variety ofproblems, they share a common underlying mechanism—getting stuck, being rigid,being unable to change, and having trouble shifting attention. People with OCDget stuck on awful obsessive thoughts or repetitive behaviors, such as checking,counting, or washing; people with posttraumatic stress disorder get stuck onpast hurtful events; people with addictions get stuck on their drug; people withoppositional defiant disorder get stuck on arguing and saying no; people withobsessive-compulsive personality disorder get stuck on needing to have theirway; people with autistic spectrum disorders often get stuck on rituals; andpeople with certain forms of depression get stuck on their failures from thepast.Examples of being stuck in rigid thought patterns and behaviors are all aroundus. Maybe there are even some in your own life. Here are some brief examples ofwhat a “stuck” person might say.• I hate being divorced (eight years later).• I have to have it my way.• You hurt me years ago and I’ll never forget.• I won’t ever forgive you.• It’ll never be the same.• I’m always worried.• I can’t get bad thoughts out of my head.• Do it my way.• I can’t change. This is the way it should be done.• It’s your fault.• I don’t agree with you.• No. No. No. I won’t do it. I don’t want to do it. You can’t make me do it.• I have a lot of complaints about you.• I’ve never hated anyone more than you.• This will never change.People who live or work with people who tend to get stuck often say things suchas:• Nothing ever gets forgiven or let go.• She brings up issues from years and years ago.• Everything has to be the way she wants it.• He can’t ever say he’s sorry.• She holds on to grudges forever.• He never throws anything away.• She’s rigid.• If things aren’t perfect he thinks they are no good at all.• I don’t help her because I have to do it exactly her way or she goesballistic.• He argues with everything I say.• She tends to be oppositional.• He doesn’t like to try new things.Let’s look at three detailed examples of how getting stuck prevents people fromfulfilling their dreams.Philip, age eight, was brought to see me by his mom and dad because of hisextreme tantrums. They could go on and on, sometimes for hours. The week beforehis appointment, the parents surprised Philip by taking him to Disney World forhis birthday. Philip had always loved the Magic Kingdom and his parents thoughthe would have a blast. The one mistake they made, however, was surprising him.Philip had a very rigid brain. He needed things to be a certain way or he wouldbecome very upset, sometimes to the point of violence. He needed to know what toexpect and time for transition. When they pulled the family car into the Simbaparking lot at Disney World Philip threw a three-hour tantrum. They could notconsole or settle him down and ended up going home. His birthday was ruined. Isat in amazement as I listened to the story. Not that I hadn’t heard manystories like it in the past, but just the week before I had seen another childwho had the exact same tantrum at Disney World. Mickey was losing his touch, Ithought. Looking at Philip, I asked why he got so upset. He said he didn’t know.I asked him if he liked Disney World. He said yes. I asked if he was sure.Again, he said yes. I then told him it was okay not to like Disney World. It isexpensive, and there are long lines, and lots of people. Philip looked at melike, “Poor Dr. Amen. He just doesn’t get it.” Then he said, “I like DisneyWorld and have no idea why I flipped out.”I diagnosed Philip with Asperger’s syndrome, a high functioning autisticspectrum disorder characterized by rigid thinking patterns. His brain scanshowed intense increased activity in his ACG. Autistic spectrum disorders arecharacterized by cognitive and emotional inflexibility. People with an autisticspectrum disorder get stuck on negative thoughts and behaviors, much likepatients who have OCD. Often, they appear as if they have to have things theirway. On the surface they appear selfish. Yet it is not selfishness that is theproblem, it is inflexibility. Their brain gets stuck.Christine and Tim had been married for five years when they came to see me. Theywere fighting nearly every week, sometimes about money or sex, sometimesseemingly about nothing at all. In evaluating the couple it was clear that theywere both rigid and inflexible. They both wanted their way, with littlecompromise. I had seen this pattern many times before. Christine was a nurse whohad grown up in an alcoholic home and had struggled with anxiety, depression,and excessive worry. At home, she had a place for everything and was upset whenthings were not where they were supposed to be. Neat freak was a term she hadheard many times in her life. Tim was a trial attorney who was financiallysuccessful but difficult to be around. He went through many assistants, wasargumentative at home and work, and appeared to Christine as narcissistic andself-absorbed. The first few sessions I had with them I felt like a referee in aboxing ring. They both postured to get one up on each other and only saw thingsfrom their own perspective. Both had trouble listening and had a long list ofcomplaints they had to discuss. People like Christine and Timothy wear out thetypical marital therapist. I was the fourth marital therapist they saw. But Ihad a secret weapon. Looking at both of their scans, it was clear that the ACGworked way too hard. In some important ways they were both like Philip: rigid,inflexible, and needing their way. To be helpful to this couple, it wasimperative to balance their brains or they were destined to be unhappy ordivorced, not only in this marriage but in the others to come. Seeing theirscans, they understood the dilemma and both became cooperative with treatment. Abetter brain is connected to a happier marriage.Les had to be the boss at work. He could never work for anyone else. It wasalways his way or the highway. He had sold his wholesale grocery business to alarger company for a healthy sum of money but left after eight months, eventhough he had agreed to stay on for three years. It was a big loss financially,but Les couldn’t stand always fighting with his new management team. Wheneverthey disagreed with him, he thought they were idiots; he argued incessantly andworried about the company. The management team thought Les had an irrationalarrogant streak and viewed him as oppositional, a poor listener who struggled toget along. Les was also divorced and estranged from his only son. His ex-wifeoften told him that he was selfish and that he would hold on to grudges andhurts for years and years. After leaving his company, Les became depressed andwas referred to our clinics by his sister who was also our patient. His scan,like Philip’s, Christine’s, and Tim’s, showed too much activity in the ACG. Hewas rigid, inflexible, worried, and alone.These three cases are blatant examples of being stuck, manifested tantrums,fighting, and self-sabotage. Let’s look at two more subtle examples of howgetting stuck can cause trouble.Wilson, a young information technology administrator for a medical insurancecompany, was struggling in his marriage. He and his wife were having morefrequent disagreements and seemed to be growing apart. Wilson worried abouttheir future together. At work, he was becoming more and more distracted. Hecould not get the problems at home out of his head. Initially, his companysupervisors saw him as a rising star—bright, hardworking, and a real asset tothe morale and profitability of the company. Lately, they started to wonder ifthey made the right choice by promoting Wilson, as several important tasks wereleft undone. Through their employee assistance program, they suggested Wilsonsee me. Rather than viewing the referral negatively, which many employees doinitially, I found Wilson to be open and interested. He was worried about hismarital problems and wanted help to resolve them so he could get the anxiousthoughts out of his head. I taught him how to eliminate the repetitive negativethoughts, be more present at work, and increase the communication with his wife.Getting stuck on these stressful thoughts almost cost Wilson his promotion. Hisopen spirit saved him.One of my close friends, Kerry, got a new job as the chief financial officer fora group of surgery centers across Southern California. She was very excitedabout her new position. Kerry tended to be a worrier, and if you saw her homethe word anal might cross your mind, which is not all that uncommon foraccountants. After about six months into her new job, Kerry started to appearstressed. In dealing with a group of physicians, she often found that they wereargumentative, oppositional, and rigid. She took their negative commentspersonally and would dwell on them for weeks. I could see that the initialexcitement about the job had been slowly draining out of her. On one of ourwalks, we discussed her worries at length. By all outward accounts they lovedher at work. After a few months she had been given a substantial raise and moreresponsibility. She was in charge of several new projects to grow the business.She had never worked for physicians before. I told her that M.D. stands for“minor deity,” and that many physicians tend to be “cingulate,” argumentativeand rigid, especially in dealing with their families and staff, although nottheir patients, because they see them as providing their livelihood and purposein life. About an hour into our walk, we got to the bottom line. Even though adoctor would say something negative to her once, in Kerry’s head she heard thecomment five hundred times. It was as though her mind was repeatedly hitting thereplay button of the negative comment. This was Kerry’s issue, not heremployers. Understanding the culture of her workplace and, more important, howher own brain was sabotaging her, she was able to relax and have more fun atwork. She learned that she did not have to hit the replay button; in fact, doingso was hurtful to her. I told her of a spin-off from the serenity prayer that Ioften use myself.God, grant me the serenityto accept the people I cannot change,the courage to change the one I can, andthe wisdom to know that person is me.Making Unconscious, Brain-Driven Behavior ConsciousOver the years, I have seen hundreds of people who had too much activity in theACG. Often, they would struggle with change, get stuck on negative thoughts, andneed to do things a certain way or they would be upset. They also tended to beargumentative and oppositional, which can be a challenge in a psychotherapysession. Part of my job is to notice behavior patterns and feed them back to mypatients.Lindy had the cingulate from hell. She was the CEO of a local software companyand had a child with Asperger’s syndrome. She was brilliant, attractive, andvery successful on the surface. Underneath her pretty exterior, she waschronically stressed, and had trouble in relationships. After her third divorceshe came to see me. I remember one therapy session with Lindy where I felt thatno matter what I said she would argue with me. I had been seeing her for aboutthree months and it was like she was wearing Teflon. Everything I said justbounced off her. Nothing would stick. A bit out of frustration I said, “It seemslike no matter what I say you argue with me.”What do you think Lindy said next?“No, I don’t,” was her reply.I smiled, “That’s how it seems to me.”“But I don’t do that!” she quickly shot back.“I know you say that,” I said with a more serious look. “But if you want to getbetter, I want you to think about what I am saying.”“I don’t do that,” she said even more emphatically.It is usually not very helpful to argue with patients, especially ones who getstuck, but I felt that I needed to press this point.“If you want to get better, this is what I would like you to do.”She opened her mouth in protest, but I raised my hand for her to let me finish.“If you want to get better, I want you to watch yourself this week. See if it isnot your automatic tendency, in most situations, to argue with people. See ifyou are not always arguing with others in your head and that you tend to formthe opposite opinion of what people say automatically, no matter what they aresaying.”“But I don’t do that,” she protested one last time.“Just watch it this week.” With that we ended our session.The next week as Lindy sat down in my office, she started, almost withexcitement, “I do that! My mind is always arguing with people. How weird.”“Do you want to do that?” I said.“What do you mean?” she asked.“Do you want to be a chronically difficult person who argues with everyone?”“No.” She appeared sad. This was a hard realization.“Your brain’s automatic tendency is to argue and oppose. It is unconscious. Whenthe anterior cingulate gyrus works too hard, people tend to get stuck inopposition or negative thoughts and behaviors. But obviously, that drives awaythe people you love. They get tired of the conflict, unless, of course, theyneed it.”She was finally listening with an open mind and not arguing with me.“If you want to correct this problem, before you say no to someone or start toargue with them, I want you to ask yourself, first, before you say anything,what you really think about the situation and if it fits your personal goals toargue, oppose, or say no.”This is the essence of making unconscious, brain-driven behavior conscious andwill driven. This is the essence of mental health and a major factor in success.Do you operate from your goals rather than your brain’s natural tendency toargue, oppose, or seek sameness? When you understand your own brain’svulnerabilities ask yourself if your behavior matches your desires and goals. Ifyou find that you are argumentative, oppositional, or impulsive, take a stepback before you respond and ask yourself the question, again and again, Does mybehavior get me what I want? If it does, then you are living a conscious lifeand not reacting out of the realm of your unconscious.Greasing the GearsBalance is needed in your ACG. It is critical to shift gears as needed.Otherwise you end up throwing tantrums, fighting with the people you love,making stupid financial decisions, making mistakes at work, or feeling tormentedby hurtful comments from less than thoughtful people. Shifting gears too hastilywill make you distracted and unable to stay on the path toward your goals whenthings get tough. We need a healthy balance so we can stay on track but also beable to take the turns when they come up along the roads of our lives. Here areseven steps to help you be more flexible without compromising your ability tostay focused on what is important to you.1. BALANCE YOUR BRAINIf you or someone you love tends to resist change, gets stuck on negativethoughts or behaviors, or is rigid and oppositional, it is likely the brainneeds a boost of the neurotransmitter serotonin. There are both natural andpharmaceutical ways to enhance this important chemical, including aerobicexercise, nutritional and supplement strategies, as well as SSRI medications.Exercise can be very helpful in calming worries and increasing the brain’sflexibility. Exercise works by increasing brain levels of L-tryptophan, theamino acid building block for serotonin. L-tryptophan is a relatively smallamino acid and has trouble competing against the larger amino acids to enter thebrain. During exercise the larger amino acids are utilized to nourish muscletissue, which causes a relative decrease in the availability of these largeramino acids in the blood stream. As such, L-tryptophan can compete moreeffectively to enter the brain and raise brain serotonin levels. In addition,exercise helps your energy and may distract you from the bad thoughts that tendto loop. One of the best things to do when you are upset and cannot get thoughtsout of your head is go for a run or a long, fast walk or to play tennis.There are two ways that food can increase serotonin levels. According to MITresearchers, carbohydrate-containing foods such as pastas, potatoes, bread,pastries, pretzels, candy, and popcorn temporarily increase L-tryptophan levelsin the blood, resulting in more L-tryptophan available to enter the brain whereit is converted to serotonin. The calming effect of serotonin can often be feltin thirty minutes or less by eating these foods. The problem, of course, is thatyou will want to duplicate this positive feeling and use these foods repeatedly,which is not healthy. Cerebral serotonin levels can also be raised by eatingfoods rich in tryptophan, such as turkey, peanut butter, eggs, green peas,potatoes, and milk. Many people unknowingly trigger cognitive inflexibility ormood problems by eating diets that are low in L-tryptophan. For example,high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets that I recommend for low dopamine states(related to prefrontal cortex underactivity) often make cingulate problemsworse.In the short run, when someone is upset with you or stuck in her position, giveher a cookie. In a few minutes, she may be more flexible. If you wanted to be abit Machiavellian, you could use food at business meetings to manipulate theenvironment. If you need people to pay better attention at meetings, serve moreprotein-based food, such as nuts and cheese. If you want them to be lesscontentious and more cooperative, serve cookies.Nutritional supplementation can also be helpful, such as 5-hydroxytryptophan,inositol, and St. John’s wort, discussed in chapters 6 and 7.My friend and colleague Barry Chaitin, who is the chair of the department ofpsychiatry at the University of California–Irvine, talks about patients who havesticky thoughts and that medications such as Prozac are like grease for theirgear shifters, helping them to be more flexible. SSRI medications, such asProzac, Zoloft, Paxil, Luvox, Celexa, and Lexapro, can be very helpful incalming overactivity in this part of the brain. Because of side effects andcost, I tend to recommend exercise, dietary interventions, and naturalsupplements first, but it depends on the severity of the clinical situation.2. NOTICE WHEN YOU’RE STUCK, DISTRACT YOURSELF, AND COME BACK TO THE PROBLEMLATEROne of the most helpful ways to overcome being stuck on negative thoughts orbehaviors is to notice when you’re stuck and distract yourself. Becoming awareof circular or looping thoughts is essential to gaining control over them.Whenever you find the thoughts “circling the wagons” (going over and over),distract yourself from them. Get up and do something else. Distraction is oftena very helpful technique. It gives you power or a measure of control in thesituation. Some of my ACG patients find it helpful to make a list of all thethings they can do to distract themselves when they get harassing thoughts. Hereare some examples:• Sing a favorite song.• Listen to music that makes you feel positive.• Take a walk.• Do a chore.• Play with a pet.• Do structured meditation.• Focus on a word and do not allow any other thoughts to enter your mind.If you allow repetitive thoughts to go over and over they get worse and havemore power over you. If you actively distract yourself from them or block them,over time they lose their control over you and become less and less.3. THINK THROUGH ANSWERS BEFORE AUTOMATICALLY SAYING NOAs mentioned, many ACG people have an automatic tendency to say no. Fight thetendency. Before answering questions or responding to requests in a negativeway, take a breath and think first whether or not it is in the best interest ofthe situation to really say no. Often it is helpful to take a deep breath, holdit for a few seconds, and then slowly exhale, just to get extra time beforeresponding. For example, if your spouse asks you to come to bed and make love,take a deep breath before responding that you’re tired, sick, too busy, or notin the mood. Use the time during the deep breath to ask yourself whether or notyou really want to deny your partner; determine if it’s in your best interest tosay no and continue doing what you’re doing or if it’s in your best interest toget close to your partner. The automatic no has ruined many relationships. Takeenough time to ask yourself if saying no is really what you want to say.4. WRITE OUT OPTIONS AND SOLUTIONS WHEN YOU FEEL STUCKWhenever you feel stuck on a thought, it is often helpful to write it down.Writing the thought down gets it out of your head. When you see a thought onpaper, you can deal with it in a rational way. When these thoughts causesleeping problems, keep a pen and paper near your bed to write them out. Afteryou write out a thought that has gotten stuck, generate a list of the things youcan do about it and the things you can’t do about it. For example, if you areworried about a situation at work, such as whether or not you’ll get thepromotion, do the following:• Write out the thought: “I’m worried about whether or not I’ll get thepromotion at work.”• Make a list of the things you can do about the worry.• I can do the best job I can at work.• I will continue to be reliable, hardworking, and creative.• I will make sure the boss knows I desire the promotion.• In a confident (not bragging) way, I will make sure the boss knows about mycontributions to the company.• Make a list of the things you cannot do about the worry.• I cannot make the decision for the boss.• I cannot want the promotion any more than I do.• I cannot will the promotion to happen. Worrying will not help.• I cannot make the promotion happen, although I do have lots of influence onthe process by my attitude and performance.Use this simple exercise to unlock the thoughts that keep you up nights feelingtense.5. SEEK THE COUNSEL OF OTHERS WHEN YOU FEEL STUCK (OFTEN JUST TALKING ABOUTFEELING STUCK WILL OPEN NEW OPTIONS)When all of your efforts to rid repetitive thoughts are unsuccessful, it isoften helpful to seek the counsel of others. Finding someone with whom todiscuss the worries, fears, or repetitive behaviors can be very helpful. Throughthe years, I have used mentors to help me through some of the problems I’ve hadto face. Other people can be a “sounding board” they can help you see optionsand provide a reality check for you.6. WHEN DEALING WITH OPPOSITIONAL PEOPLE, DON’T OVERREACT TO THE OPPOSITIONDon’t try to convince someone else who is stuck. If you’re locked in the middleof an argument, take a break! Take ten minutes, ten hours, or even ten days. Oneof the best marital suggestions I give couples is “Learn how to go to thebathroom.” When you can see that your partner is beginning to get into cingulateterritory and is starting to go over the same point again and again, excuseyourself and say you have to go to the bathroom. If you’re in a repetitive,negative argument with somebody, and you distract yourself, you’re often able tocome back later and work it out.I learned long ago not to try to argue with people who had ACG problems. Whenanother person is “stuck” on a thought or behavior, logical reasoning is oftenineffective in swaying their opinion. One of the best techniques I’ve found todeal with those who get stuck is as follows: I will briefly make the point Iwant to make. If I can tell the other person is getting locked in to hisposition, I try to change the subject and distract him away from the topic atthe moment. Distraction allows time for the other person’s subconscious mind toprocess what I said without having to lock in on it or fight it. Often, when wecome back to the issue, he’ll have a more open mind to the situation. Here’s anexample.Jackie came to see me for marital problems. Her husband traveled and was unableto attend many of the sessions. In the individual sessions, I saw that Jackiefrequently became locked in to her position and left little room for alternativeexplanations for behavior. Her husband complained of the same thing. He saidthat she would go on and on for hours and not listen to anything he said. As Irealized this was her pattern, I used the brief “attack and retreat” model Idescribed. When she complained about her husband’s not paying attention to her,I wondered aloud if it wasn’t because he felt she didn’t listen to his opinion.Immediately, she said I was wrong. She said that she was a very good listener. Ididn’t argue with her but went on to something else for a while. The nextsession, Jackie talked about listening more to her husband. Because I hadn’tengaged her in a prolonged battle, her subconscious was able to hear and processwhat I said.This is often a very helpful technique for teenagers. Many teens argue andoppose their parents as part of the natural individuation process. I teachparents to get out of struggles with their teenagers by briefly making theirpoints and moving on to other topics. Important issues can be revisited at latertimes.7. EMPLOY PARADOXICAL REQUESTSRemember “reverse psychology”? Once a treatment for difficult patients, it workswith ACG folks too. But you need to be sly about it. When employing reversepsychology, a person basically asks for the opposite of what he or she wants.When you want a kiss from a naturally oppositional two-year-old, say, “I don’twant a kiss.” The next moment they are begging to give you a kiss. When you wantsomeone to help you with a chore say, “You probably wouldn’t want to help mewith this chore.” Family therapists have developed whole paradoxical treatmentprescriptions to deal with resistant couples. Basically they tell the couple todo the opposite of what they really want them to do. The therapist bets on thecouple’s resistance to suggestions. For example, if the couple is havingproblems spending time together and finding time for sex, the therapist wouldtell them not to spend any time together and definitely to avoid sex. Manycouples would find after these paradoxical suggestions that they would start tospend more time together and make more love regularly and passionately than theyhad in years.Paradoxical suggestions and interventions have been used as therapeuticprescriptions by psychotherapists for many years. These interventions have goneunder many names, such as “anti-suggestion,” “negative practice,” “paradoxicalintention,” “the confusion technique,” “declaring hopelessness,” “re-strainingchange,” “prescribing a relapse,” and “therapeutic double-blind.” Basically,they involve suggesting the opposite of the desired response. It is mycontention that they probably work best on ACG clients. A common paradoxicalsuggestion given to people who have trouble sleeping is “Stay awake as long aspossible when going to bed.” Psychologists Ascher and Turner treated malepatients who could not urinate in public restrooms because of anxiety byinstructing them to go to public restrooms and go through the entire procedureof urinating (standing in front of the urinal, unzipping their pants, and takingout their penis) but to refrain from urinating. With repeated trials they wereable to overcome their fear of urinating in public. Milton Erickson, one of thefathers of modern hypnosis, used this technique successfully on many clients. Heexplicitly instructed one client who did not wish to self-disclose to withholdinformation until he was ready to provide it and no sooner. On a personal level, whenever you want a cingulate person to do something foryou it is best to make it look like it is his or her idea. Do not ask for manythings directly, as you are likely to be disappointed. Ask for the person’sinput. Get her feedback. Get her to commit to doing certain things, beforetelling her that it is a requirement. Here are some examples.• If you want someone to meet you for dinner, it is often best to ask about whattime is good for her as opposed to telling her to meet you at a certain time.• If you want a hug, it is often best to say something like “You probablywouldn’t want to give me a hug.”• If you want him or her to go to the store with you, say something like “Youprobably wouldn’t want to go with me.”• If you want someone to finish a report by next Thursday, say, “You probablycan’t finish the report by next Thursday.”• If you want a child to comply with a request without giving you a problem,say, “You probably wouldn’t be able to do this without getting upset, wouldyou?”These seven steps will help you develop more flexibility, another key componentto a magnificent mind."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_044_r1.jpg]Develop Mental Toughnessimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]CULTIVATE A RESILIENT BRAINIf I had a formula for bypassing trouble, I wouldn’t pass it around. Wouldn’t bedoing anybody a favor. Trouble creates a capacity to handle it.—OLIVER WENDELL HOLMESPeople are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun isout, but when the darkness sets in, their beauty is revealed only if there is alight from within.—ELISABETH KÜBLER-ROSSChris had struggled with anxiety and trouble breathing when he first came to seeme. He was sixteen years old and had a condition known as Goldenhar syndrome,which meant he was born without his left jawbone. He had undergone twenty-oneoperations to fix his deformity, which included bone grafts from his own body.His face was severely scarred like an old railroad yard. The sense of panicstarted when he was on the operating room table being intubated for the last twosurgeries. His mother, Maria, was concerned, as Chris had been a very resilientboy, and she brought him to see me. He had at least two more surgeries to go. Afew sessions of relaxation training and hypnosis easily cleared up his anxiety.As I got to know Chris, I came to believe that despite his anxiety reaction,which didn’t occur until his twentieth surgery, he was the healthiest person Ihad ever met. He was president of his tenth-grade class. He was a straight-Astudent and had a girlfriend he adored. He also had very clear goals for hisfuture and a great attitude, despite the multiple surgeries and distorted face.After his anxiety abated, I continued to see him for a few months without cost.I felt driven to understand why he was so healthy, despite his circumstances. Ihad other patients, who had not faced nearly his stress and challenges but whowere emotional wrecks nonetheless. For the most part, psychiatrists studyillness, not mental health. I came to believe that there were four reasons forChris’s resilience.First, Chris’s mother never allowed his illness to be an excuse for anything.Maria was loving but firm. Inside, Chris’s illness deeply pained Maria. Like allgood mothers, she hurt for her son, but early in Chris’s illness she realizedthat babying him would only handicap him and she would have none of it. He stilldid chores, he was expected to excel at his schoolwork, and he participated withother kids even when they made fun of him. She helped him rehearse what to saywhen they were cruel, which they were. When the other kids found that Chris didnot get upset by the teasing, but expected it and laughed along with them, theystopped teasing and befriended and admired him. Their petty complaints seemedsmall compared to what Chris endured. Second, because of Chris’s behavior, hehad a strong peer group. His group of friends often came to the hospital to seehim after his surgeries and he spent a lot of time with them. He was a goodfriend. Third, Chris was an optimist. In listening to his speech, he almostalways saw the upbeat side of issues. He did not see his condition as ahandicap. When we talked about it, he said, everyone has something. “This is myproblem,” he said. “At least I do not have cancer or something that will killme.” Lastly, I did not need a SPECT scan to know that Chris had a great brain.He was flexible, goal oriented, focused, passionate about his life, and positiveand honest in his thinking. I often wish I could bottle Chris’s attitude andgive it away to my children, patients, and even take a dose or two myself.Psychiatrist Robert Pasnau, past president of the American PsychiatricAssociation, once said at a lecture to the residents in my training program thatcoping requires three things: information, a sense of control, and self-esteem.Chris clearly had high self-esteem. He also knew what was happening; he was veryinformed about his condition and what must be done. His anxiety started when hefelt as though he was losing control. He was not supposed to be aware of beingintubated (this is where a metal tube is placed in your throat to keep yourairway open for breathing during the anesthesia and surgery). Theanesthesiologist had not given him enough medication on the twentieth surgery,and he was aware of the tube in his throat and felt panicky and out of control.How Childhood Sets Up Resilience or Vulnerability in the BrainEvidence from both animal and human studies shows that children who experienceextreme, uncontrollable stress, such as physical or sexual abuse, are morelikely to suffer from anxiety and depression and are more vulnerable to stresslater in life. At birth there is substantial flexibility in the brain’s abilityto respond and adapt to stressful events. Some research suggests that there maybe a critical period in the first few weeks of life, during which time traumasare particularly harmful to the brain’s ability to handle stress. Studies ofhumans who survive child abuse have found changes in the functioning of thebrain circuits responsible for handling stress. A study of women who were abusedas children found that they had an increase in their stress hormones comparedwith those who were not abused. Long-term exposure to stress hormones has beenfound to kill cells in the hippocampus, part of the limbic brain deep in thetemporal lobes, involved with memory, learning, and emotion. Smaller hippocampalvolumes are found in people with depression and chronic stress disorders. Earlyabuse or stress can cause longstanding changes in brain circuits associated withresilience and learning. Women who are abused are more likely to stay with menwho are abusive, in part because of their own anxiety, erratic memory, and lowself-confidence. These findings suggest that child abuse can lead to long-termchanges in the brain and may help to explain why mistreatment is passed downgeneration after generation.An interesting twist on the research, however, occurs when children are exposedto milder, more manageable forms of stress. It appears that these stressesactually aid in building resilience. Some stress, it seems, is good, evenimportant. This is known as stress inoculation, based on the analogy tovaccinations against infections. The theory is that when a person is presentedwith a mild form of an infectious disease, he or she develops immunity bylearning how to fight it off. Children who are faced with and overcomemoderately stressful events, such as family moves, parental illnesses, or lossof a friendship, are better able to deal with adversity later in life thanpeople who were never exposed to trouble as children. Children who learn to copewith stress seem to have a better ability to deal with hardships over the longterm. In one study, teenage boys who survived stressful childhood eventsexperienced less overt signs of stress, such as increased heart rate and bloodpressure changes, when performing challenging tasks compared with theircounterparts who had not struggled with earlier trouble. Research on animalslend credence to the stress inoculation theory and provides insight into itsbrain mechanism. Young monkeys separated from their mothers for one hour everyweek (a manageable stressor) experienced acute distress during the separationperiods, and temporarily increased levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. Laterin life, however, the same monkeys demonstrated lower anxiety and lower baselinecortisol levels than monkeys who had never been separated from their mothers.Furthermore, these stress-inoculated monkeys demonstrated improved performanceon tests that measure prefrontal cortex function. Poor control of prefrontalcortex function has been associated with depression and impulsivity in humans.It seems that it is the amount of early stress that matters. Too much is clearlya problem, but too little leaves you without the skill to manage trouble lateron. This research highlights an important point. Try not to protect yourchildren from every hardship they may face. As a father of three children, Inever wanted my children to suffer, yet if I did everything for them and neverallowed them to experience stress, they would not develop the ability to dealwith the hardships that inevitably come their way. It would be as though I nevervaccinated them against stress. Likely, this is why Chris did so well. Hismother never allowed his handicap to be used as an excuse. Even when he wasstressed by being teased by the other children, he had to keep dealing with itand therefore learned how to deal with it. Social skills are now his strength.Ten Ways to Boost ResilienceAll of us have adversity in our lives. All of us have faced physical, emotional,financial, work, and relational stresses. Self-doubt, fears, failure, loss,anger, and disappointment reach into all of our experiences. It is during thesetimes, when we are stressed or pushed to our own personal limits, that ourbehavior defines our character. Over the past decade, research on resilience, onpeople like Chris, has grown, giving important clues to why some peoplepersevere and others give up. In this chapter I will synthesize this researchand show you ten ways to boost your own ability to bounce back when adversitystrikes.1. Gather information.2. Develop a personal sense of control.3. Build self-esteem.4. Keep your pleasure centers healthy.5. Clear up past traumas.6. Face your fears.7. Strengthen your ability to deal with adversity.8. Use positive emotions, especially laughter.9. Rely on a moral compass.10. Nurture social support.1. GATHER INFORMATIONPsychologist Abraham Maslow noted that what you do not know has power over you,whereas knowledge brings choice and control. Most of us handle adversity betterwhen we know what we are up against. Chris knew what needed to be done for hisface, so he was better able to handle the inevitable pain. Not knowing what toexpect increases anxiety and decreases resilience.At no other point in history has information been more readily available than itis right now. Immediate information abounds on everything from financial stress,marital struggles, child rearing, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression,and work challenges. Amazon.com [http://amazon.com] lists nearly two millionbooks, and Yahoo! and Google are the constant companion for so many of us.Still, many people sabotage themselves by not accumulating enough information ontheir challenges. There are a number of reasons people do not become adequatelyinformed, including failing to ask the appropriate questions, not knowing how togather accurate information, magical thinking that says, “I should know all,”and fear of the truth.Asking the right question is the most important step to getting the rightanswer. It is a sign of curiosity and indicates a willingness to learn. The fearof appearing stupid, however, often prevents questions and stifles learning. Howmany times have you wanted to ask a question, yet when it came to saying thewords, fear of embarrassment kept your mouth shut? How many times have you notgotten the information you needed because of the fear that you would be anuisance to the other person? You may be the victim of misconceptions. Manypeople see those who ask questions as interested and willing to learn, notstupid. Second, many people feel good if they can help others and enjoy sharingtheir knowledge. If you’re bothering them, you will probably be able to tell andyou can ask them another time. Even better, you can start by asking if this is agood moment for them to answer a question. In business, if you do not have allthe information you need to do your job, but you are afraid to appear stupid byasking questions, think of how much worse you’ll feel when it’s discoveredyou’re not doing the job right. Most supervisors wish to teach because they,like most of us, get satisfaction from helping others to do something well,especially if they’re held responsible for the kind of job you do.There is no doubt in my mind that the failure to ask questions and gatherinformation damages many relationships. When we are confused about others’behavior or think we may have gotten the wrong information from them, it iscrucial to clarify the meaning of their behavior. Without clarification, ourassumptions take over, and little things may turn into monsters. The worst thingthat can happen when you ask a question is that someone may refuse to answer it,give you an answer you don’t like, or make you feel stupid for asking. I thinkignorance is worse than those three things. You can lessen the chances of anegative response by asking questions in an appropriately respectful way at theright time. But when you have questions, ask them! They will get you moreinformation, which will bring you closer to your goals and help you managedifficult times and situations.Expecting yourself to know something without being taught is what psychiatristscall magical thinking. It is like a person who has never been somewhere beforerefusing to ask for directions when he is lost. This magical thinking of “Ishould know the answers” occurs in many situations. I see it most frequentlywith parents who expect themselves to be good parents of difficult childrendespite never having had a role model to teach them. Pride is often an excuse tocover ignorance. Be kind to yourself and don’t expect more from you than isreasonable. If you don’t know something, admit it and find the answer to it.Another reason people don’t ask questions or become informed is that they areafraid of the answers. I see this most commonly in people who marry afterknowing each other for only a few weeks. They are generally tired of being aloneand want to be in a relationship so badly that they leave common sense behind.Ignorance, they think, is better than information. But this usually backfires.Often, hidden information surfaces, and one or both parties feel betrayed. Someare too eager to trust before finding out if a person is trustworthy. This mayalso be true in business or personal issues when something is wanted so muchthat denying reality is preferable to denying the opportunity to obtain thedesired goal. The following statements summarize the importance of information:• What I do not know has power over me, whereas knowledge brings choice andcontrol.• Information is power.• My fear of being ignorant overcomes my fear of asking questions.2. DEVELOP A PERSONAL SENSE OF CONTROLA man can fail many times, but he isn’t a failure until he begins to blamesomebody else.—JOHN BURROUGHSThe perceived degree of personal control that you have over a stressful eventplays a key role in determining whether the event will lead to subsequentvulnerability or resilience to stress. In one animal study, rats exposed touncontrollable and unpredictable shocks developed exaggerated fear responses andheightened anxiety states; animals subjected to predictable shocks from whichthey could escape did not develop this learned helplessness. Furthermore, ratsthat learned to have control over a stressor (by learning to escape predictableshocks) were less likely to develop learned helplessness when they weresubsequently exposed to unpredictable shocks. This finding in rats supports theobservation in humans that learning to manage one stress enhances subsequentresilience to many other unrelated stresses. For those people who experiencedsevere early life stresses, it is critical to know that they may be morevulnerable to the effects of stress, and to become resilient they would be wiseto work hard to strengthen their brain’s ability to resist stress.In my clinical experience, this sense of control is one of the most importantfactors in managing stress and succeeding in life. You can tell when people feelout of control, because they blame others for their situation in life. Whensomething goes wrong at work or in their relationships, they often find someoneto blame. Fight this tendency. It makes you a victim with little to no controlover your own life.Additionally, people who lack a personal sense of control often live in thepast. You will hear them saying, “If only I had done so and so, things would bedifferent.”If only: I didn’t marry that good-for-nothing husband of mine.I finished school.My parents hadn’t gotten divorced.The company hadn’t changed hands.I had made that sale.I hadn’t forgotten my diaphragm.I’d chosen a different career.I had rich parents.Etc., etc., etc. The past continues to haunt these people even when it has no relevance. Atremendous amount of emotional energy is invested in things that cannot bechanged. I had a patient, Kathy, who had an encyclopedia of “if onlys.” “If onlyI finished college.” “If only I hadn’t married David.” “If only we didn’t livein Washington, D.C.” “If only I could find a good day care center.” “If only welived in a different neighborhood.” And on and on. When I pointed out to her howmuch energy it must have taken to come up with this list, Kathy said, “If only Ididn’t worry so much.” I was about to pull out my hair with her. But afterseveral months she learned to rechannel that energy into “What do I want now andhow do I get it?” This is a much healthier approach to life.Never forget that your success starts and ends with you. You want it. You defineit. You go after it. You achieve it, or you don’t. Only you are personallyresponsible for how your life turns out. Many other people will try to takeresponsibility for you, like your parents, your spouse, your friends, or your coworkers, but in the final analysis, they can only influence how your lifeprogresses, they cannot control it. Only you can.Once you fully realize this most important ingredient of success, your life willnever be the same. You will stop blaming others for your failures anddisappointments and start working on changing yourself to be the kind of personyou want to be. As long as you can blame someone else for why things aren’t theway you want them to be, you can comfortably avoid change. After all, “it’stheir fault.” However, when you have no one to blame but yourself, you are morelikely to seek change. Not many people feel comfortable saying, “It’s my fault.”Now, it is true that life is not fair. We are all dealt a different hand ofcards in life. Some hands are very good; some hands are very, very bad. Theobstacles we have to overcome are not the same for each person. It is, however,what we do with the hands we are dealt in life that determines how we feel aboutourselves, not the initial hands themselves.Eric Fromm, M.D., summed up the concept of personal responsibility in his bookMan for Himself when he wrote, “Man must accept responsibility for himself andthe fact that only by using his own power, can he give meaning to his life.” Youhave the power. It is up to you how you use it.There is an interesting side effect to taking personal responsibility for yourlife. The more you realize that you’re in control of your own life, the more yourealize that you cannot control anyone else’s life. You become more independent,while at the same time you stop believing you can change other people. Yourealize only they can do that. Efforts directed toward changing your parents,your spouse, or your boss stop, leaving you more time and energy to work onyourself. Success takes a lot of time and energy.Personal responsibility and self-control are clear hallmarks of a successfulperson. Without these, you see yourself as a victim of the world and you areunable to take or accomplish any more than the world is willing to give.Personal responsibility dictates that “if it’s to be, it’s up to me.” It’saccepting that you are human and bound to make mistakes. But when you make them,you learn from them, and you look toward creative problem solving rather thanlooking for someone to blame. Taking personal responsibility for your life takessupreme courage and can be painful at any age. But the payoff is independenceand freedom.Researchers have demonstrated that it is possible for a person to change the wayhe perceives himself in the world; i.e., victims can take more control. These“thinking” exercises will work to strengthen your sense of personalresponsibility if you commit yourself to completing them. The only person yousabotage by not completing these exercises is you. Are you worth it?For the next week, be aware of your thoughts when something goes wrong—a mistakeis made, you have a problem, you have an accident, any situation in which youhave a tendency to blame someone else. After you identify an incident such asthis, fill in the sheet below. Do this for at least three separate incidents.EXAMPLE1. What happened? I got a speeding ticket.2. What was my first response to the situation? Was it to find someone else toblame? “I wasn’t going that fast. They must have set up a speed trap.”3. Why is it important to blame someone else? How does that help? “If I canblame the police officer, then it is easy to first try to talk him out of theticket. If that doesn’t work, it is then okay for me to be nasty to him.”4. Am I uncomfortable if I can’t find someone to blame? “Yes. That means it’s myfault. And who likes to admit anything is their fault?”5. Is it okay for me to make a mistake in this instance? “No. My insurance willgo up, because this is my third ticket in a year.”YOUR TURN:1. What happened?2. What was my first response to the situation? Was it to find someone else toblame?3. Why is it important to blame someone else? How does that help?4. Am I uncomfortable if I can’t find someone to blame?5. Is it okay for me to make a mistake in this instance?You can learn to talk back to your automatic “blaming others” habit of thinking.I’ve set up a double-column technique to help you retrain your thoughts. In thefirst column, write down your automatic thought when a problem comes up, and inthe second column, write down a rational response. Here are some examples tohelp you get started.Blaming Others PersonalResponsibility ResponseI’m late for my appointment. It’s my wife’s fault I overslept.I can’t honestly blame my wife because I overslept and am late for theappointment. If being on time is important to me, I will set the alarm to ensureI get up and accept responsibility for my timeliness.I told the staff to rotate the merchandise and the job isn’t done. They never doanything right. Their failure to follow orders is the reason sales are down.When I notice the staff hasn’t completed a job, it’s my responsibility to followup on it, so they learn to do their jobs completely. The reduction in salesprobably has nothing to do with the staff not following orders. Sales fluctuateevery day.My husband always makes me feel unhappy because he acts so nastily toward me.My husband cannot make me feel anything without my permission and cooperation.If my husband acts nastily to me, I can choose to talk to him about it; I canmake it clear to him that if he doesn’t change his ways, he’ll lose me; I canend the relationship; or I can continue to feel miserable. It’s myresponsibility how I choose to feel and how I allow other people to treat me.YOUR TURN:Blaming OthersPersonal Responsibility Response1._________________________2._________________________3._________________________Each time this week you catch yourself blaming others for something that ishappening to you, stop. Immediately stop the blaming. Think about how youcontributed to the situation, and immediately work on ways to solve the problem.Refuse to spend any more energy looking for scapegoats. Look to yourself andothers for answers, for ways to solve problems. Stop blaming yourself; stopblaming others. It is wasted energy.Every time you’re tempted to blame someone else but don’t, give yourself a bigpat on the back. You’re on your way to taking control of your life.3. BUILD SELF-ESTEEMHe that respects himself is safe from others; he wears a coat of mail that nonecan pierce.—HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOWHow you feel about yourself is paramount to how you manage the stresses in yourlife. Having healthy self-esteem is akin to being on good terms with yourself.It is believing that you are worth working in your own best interest. It isbelieving that you can have a positive impact on others and that you are worthothers having a positive impact on you. Self-esteem helps you manage and survivewhen devastation hits you. It is the internal voice that is on your side andgives you the encouragement to press on, even when things look bleak. Without apositive sense of self, any accomplishments, no matter how big or small, will benegated by an accusing inner voice that keeps repeating you’re no good, erasingany feelings of success. Self-esteem is a cornerstone of resilience.A fifty-year Harvard study turned up some startling truths about self-esteem.Begun as an effort to understand juvenile delinquency, the study followed thelives of 456 teenage boys from inner-city Boston. Many of the boys were frombroken or impoverished homes. When they reached middle age, one fact stood out:regardless of intelligence, family income, ethnic background, or amount offormal education, those who had worked as boys, even at simple household chores,enjoyed happier and more productive lives than those who had not. These resultsare not difficult to explain. George Valliant, M.D., psychiatrist in charge ofthe study, said, “Boys who work in the home or community gained competence andcame to feel they were worthwhile members of society. And because they felt goodabout themselves, others felt good about them as well.” People who felt bestabout themselves as adults were made responsible for themselves as children.Children do, so they believe they can do: they believe in themselves.Important people contribute to a child’s self-esteem, particularly parents,friends, grandparents, teachers, and coaches. Children often idealize importantadults and develop an image of the ideal person they’d like to be. Initially,the ideal persons are often the parents. It is common to hear four-andfive-year-old children say they want to be like their mommies and daddies. Asthey grow, the ideal person often becomes a composite of many admired andrespected people. The closer their sense of themselves is to their image ofthose they admire, the greater their self-esteem. The greater the distancebetween their sense of themselves and their image of the ideal person, the lowertheir self-esteem.The way we talk to ourselves, our inner voice, is the day-to-day indicator ofour self-esteem. We all have many voices inside our heads commenting on ourdaily thoughts and behaviors. These voices are a synthesis of the strong voiceswe’ve heard throughout our lives. If the parental voices we heard were positive,chances are our inner voices will be the same. If they were harsh and negative,it is likely that we’ll talk to ourselves in a punitive way. When ourself-esteem suffers, our inner voices often take on the quality of a “CriticsCommittee,” which runs a nonstop dialogue on how we could have done thingsbetter. These voices can often be recognized as specific voices from the past ifwe take the time to examine them. If you notice the Critics Committee tormentingyou, revisit the exercises in chapter 12, especially “Truth in the Courtroom ofYour Mind” (see Chapter 12) to excise these negative thoughts.4. KEEP YOUR PLEASURE CENTERS HEALTHYOne of the biggest buffers against severe emotional trauma is a healthy brain.When the brain works right, all of the other coping mechanisms can engage tohelp you weather the emotional storms that hit you. In particular, when thepleasure centers deep in the brain are healthy, and able to experience happinessand joy in the midst of trouble, it will be easier to get up once you areknocked down. Caring for this part of the brain is involved in both lastinghappiness and resilience.The pleasure centers, discussed earlier, are made up of the ventral tegmentalarea, basal ganglia, and other limbic areas of the brain. They are responsive toseveral neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine. When dopamine is low, as withParkinson’s disease, there is a high incidence of depression and low motivationand it is harder for sufferers to experience joy. To keep these areas healthy,it is important to engage in meaningful and pleasurable activities on a regularbasis. Do work you love and make time for fun with those you love. Theseactivities prime pleasure’s pump and help these centers stay healthy.Equally important, be careful not to wear out your pleasure centers through drugabuse or too many repetitive behaviors, such as Internet gambling, pornography,compulsive shopping, or even excessive Internet dating. In his brilliant bookThrilled to Death: How the Endless Pursuit of Pleasure Is Leaving Us Numb,pioneering psychologist Archibald Hart discusses how the modern-day trend ofconstantly needing excitement and stimulation is depleting us of joy. Instantand text messaging, e-mail, Internet, video games, music downloads, emotionallycharged movies, and television all vie for our attention. We are requiring moreand more stimulation in order to pay attention at all, in order to feelhappiness or joy. Teenagers at a computer often have ten instant messagingconversations going at once. The first time I saw my teenage daughter doingthis, I wondered how she could really pay attention to any of the conversationsshe was having. Television commercials are another example of how technology isdriving our attention and constantly pushing on the pleasure levers in ourbrain. A thirty-second commercial forty years ago had ten three-second scenes.The same commercial in 2007 has thirty one-second scenes, driving us to needmore stimulation in order to pay attention and numbing us out.The constant use of video games, so common among our children, teens, and youngadults, is another potentially serious source of the problem. Many people playfor hours at a time, to the detriment of their responsibilities, and some evengo through withdrawal symptoms when they are not allowed to play or stop. Abrain imaging study published in the journal Nature helps to explain why. Whilea group of people played action video games, researchers took positron emissiontomography scans to see which parts of the brain video games activated. They sawincreased activity in the basal ganglia, where dopamine works. Other researchershave discovered that cocaine and methamphetamine also work in this part of thebrain. Video games bring pleasure and focus by increasing dopamine. The problemis that the more dopamine released during video games, the less that isavailable later on to do regular life tasks, such as schoolwork, homework, orchores. Many parents have told me that the more a child or teen plays videogames, the worse he does in school and the more irritable he tends to be whenasked to stop playing. I saw the negative effects of video games in my ownhouse. Video games came into our home when my son was ten years old. Initially,I thought they were very cool. I never had exciting games like these when I wasa child. But over the next few years I saw that he was spending more and moretime with the games and less time on his work. He would also argue when he wastold to stop playing. I decided that the games had to go. We have all beenbetter off since. We have to be careful not to use technology to numb ourselvesout, so that we can experience happiness and pleasure, especially when we needit during times of stress.Work to keep the pleasure centers healthy. Here are some simple guidelines.• Treat any illnesses, such as depression, that interfere with pleasure centerfunction.• Curb the use of constant stimulating activities, such as gambling, shopping,pornography, Internet use, scary movies, and high-risk activities.• Exercise, especially doing something you love, such as dancing or playingtennis.• Make time to laugh, since humor enhances the pleasure centers without wearingthem out.• Connect meaningful activities and pleasure, such as volunteering foractivities you love.• Develop appreciation and gratitude.• Look for pleasure in the little things in your life, such as a walk with afriend, a great meal, or a meaningful church service.5. CLEAR UP PAST TRAUMASUnresolved traumas from the past make us more vulnerable to future stresses.Carrying haunting memories sensitizes us to anything that is likely to remind usof the prior experience and robs us of resiliency. For example, Jenna had tofile bankruptcy in her midtwenties owing to her diagnosis with thyroid cancer.Her medical bills were more than she could ever imagine paying. Twelve yearslater, she still was extremely anxious about money. She worked long hours as anurse and was barely getting ahead. Money was a big issue in her relationshipswith men. They often thought she was overfocused on financial issues, whichscared them away. It wasn’t until she got help for her financial fears that shewas able to act more rationally and optimistically about her finances.In my experience, when there are unresolved traumas, a psychotherapeutictreatment technique called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)can help extricate them from your brain. The focus of EMDR is resolving oreliminating the emotional distress arising from difficult childhood memories ortraumatic events, such as automobile accidents, assaults, natural disasters, orcombat trauma. I have also found it helpful for dealing with past failures insports that drive anxiety and prevent peak performance.EMDR was developed by psychologist Francine Shapiro beginning in 1987. Whilewalking around a lake, she noticed that a disturbing thought disappeared whenher eyes spontaneously started to move back and forth from the lower-left to theupper-right visual fields. She tried it again with another anxiety provokingthought and found that the anxious feeling went away. In the days that followedshe tried the technique with friends, acquaintances, and interested students andfound the technique helpful in relieving anxiety. She then went further to workwith patients and developed a technique that is now used worldwide and is astandard technique used by the Department of Defense for combat veterans whosuffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.The mainstay of EMDR involves clients bringing up emotionally troubling memorieswhile their eyes follow a trained therapist’s hand moving horizontally back andforth. Following a specific protocol, the clinician helps the client identifythe images, negative beliefs, emotions, and body sensations associated with atargeted memory or event. Through the therapy, positive statements and beliefsreplace the negative ones. The believability of this new thought is rated whilethe client thinks of the disturbing event. The goal of EMDR treatment is therapid processing of information about the negative experience and movementtoward an adaptive resolution. This means a reduction in the client’s distress,a shift in the client’s negative belief to positive belief, and the possibilityof more optimal behavior in relationships and at work. It is important that EMDRbe done by a trained therapist. You can contact the national EMDR InternationalAssociation at www.EMDRIA.org [http://www.emdria.org] for more information and alist of certified EMDR therapists.To be resilient, it is essential to clean out the closet in your head of past orcurrent traumas. That way, they no longer control your present or futurebehavior.6. FACE YOUR FEARSFacing your fears is a key component of resilience training. Allowing fear totake hold and put down roots in your brain ensures they will control you lateron. People who suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, for example, avoidmany aspects of their lives, such as people, places, events, and opportunities,as these may serve as reminders of the trauma. Subsequently, the conditionedfear is solidified in the brain rather than extinguished. In contrast, peoplewho are resilient are more adept at facing and managing their fears. They usetheir fears as a guide to understand threats and decide what to do. When youface your fears, you are likely rewiring your brain to have control over it.When you hide from your fears, they begin to control you. In simple terms itmeans getting back on the bicycle once you have fallen off, getting another jobafter being fired, or becoming involved in a new relationship after a messydivorce.7. STRENGTHEN YOUR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH ADVERSITYFailure is not fatal. It is part of learning and growing. One of my personalheroes is Abraham Lincoln. He had many successes in his life but also faced manytough challenges. He lost his mother at age nine and he did not have a goodrelationship with his father. His marriage was turbulent and he lost two of hischildren to death. He suffered from several bouts of depression, even beingsuicidal at times. He hated how he looked and once said if he ever met anyone asugly as himself he would shoot the wretch to put him out of his misery. He waselected to the legislature in 1834 but also lost several elections, includingtwice to the U.S. Senate. He was elected president in 1860, but his early yearsin the White House were extremely turbulent. There were many Northern defeats atthe start of the Civil War and he was constantly criticized. His early lossesand defeats perfectly placed him to be able to withstand failure. If he had beensuccessful in all his endeavors, he would have never been able to withstand thepressures of the presidency. He remains perhaps the greatest American leader ofall time. His failures, losses, and struggles prepared him for ultimate success.In a similar way, Michael Jordan, perhaps basketball’s greatest player ever, hassaid, “I have missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I have lost almost 300games. On 26 occasions I have been entrusted to take the game winning shot…andmissed. And I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that iswhy…I succeed.” Failure is not fatal. Not trying is!Failure is a part of everyone’s life. No one starts out walking in life; it ismonths before we even learn how to crawl. It is not failure that holds peopleback but their attitude toward failure and their fear of it. Toddlers don’t giveup when they fall; they take their bruises and try again. Anyone who has hadsmall children knows that despite many failed attempts at mobilization, mostchildren go very quickly from crawling to walking to running to climbing up toplaces they shouldn’t. It is arrogant to think that we are perfect and we willnever fail. We are not programmed with the answers; we learn them. We get theright answers by learning processes and observing our errors along the way.Successful supervisors do not get angry when their employees make mistakes. Theysay, “Don’t be afraid to make mistakes; learn from them. Just don’t make thesame one twice. Observe what you do and you’ll always improve.”How supervisors deal with the mistakes of their employees often determines thequality of the employees. When people go to work expecting to be yelled at orbelittled, their fear and anger get in the way of their doing the best they can.When they go to work knowing that they will be taught to learn from theirmistakes in a positive atmosphere, they relax and are more likely to producegood work. Be a good teacher for yourself and those around you. Maturity isbeing able to learn from the mistakes you make.How we learn from mistakes is a trait we learned in childhood. What happenedwhen you made a mistake as a child? When you spilled something at the dinnertable or you did poorly on a test? Were you berated and yelled at for themistake or were you encouraged to learn something from it? One of the mostcritical lessons a parent can teach a child is how to learn from mistakes. Toooften as parents we are hypercritical of ourselves when we fail, which thentransfers to how we treat our children when they fail at something. To help ourchildren feel good about themselves, we must help them be competent. Of coursecompetent people make mistakes; the difference is that they have the ability tolearn from them and move on to other things rather than beating themselves upfor it.For example, think about the four-year-old child who spills orange juice atbreakfast. Many parents, who are in a hurry to get off to work, get stressed bythe delay in schedule and take their frustration out by yelling at the child.The child feels incompetent and the next time he tries to pour juice he’ll feelanxious and tense—making him more likely to spill it again. Parents need tofocus their energy on helping their children learn from the mistakes they make.So instead of yelling at the child for the spilled orange juice, I recommendthat you teach him how to clean up the mess and then take him over to the sinkand have him pour ten glasses of orange juice. In that way, he’s gone frommaking a mistake to learning two skills: cleaning up a mess and pouring juice.He’s gone from feeling clumsy and stupid to feeling competent. To raise healthychildren, and be healthy adults, it is critical to teach them how to learn fromthe mistakes they make and to give them a framework for problem solving.The fear of failure may be preventing you from trying. When you do fail, you maydo everything you can to not think about it and thus end up repeating the samemistakes. Success involves many failures and lessons along the way. Think aboutsome of the major mistakes you have made in your life. How did you respond tothose failures?• Did you learn from them?• Did you berate yourself over and over?• Did you blame someone else for it?• Did you do everything you could to forget about it?• Did you repeat the failure?• Did you get through it and learn along the way?• Did you stay away from similar situations in the future?• Did you allow the mistake to stimulate you to look deeper inside yourself tobecome a better person?8. USE POSITIVE EMOTIONS, ESPECIALLY LAUGHTERThere is a growing body of scientific literature suggesting that positiveemotions, especially laughter, counteracts stress and is involved in resilience.According to Professor Lee Berk of the University of California–Irvine, “If wetook what we know about the medical benefits of laughter and bottled it up, itwould require FDA approval.” Laughter can lower blood pressure, trigger a floodof endorphins—the brain chemicals that bring on euphoria and decrease pain—andenhance our immune systems. Gamma-interferon, a disease-fighting protein, riseswith laughter. So do B cells, which produce disease-destroying antibodies, and Tcells, which orchestrate our body’s immune response. Laughter lowers the flow ofdangerous stress hormones that suppress the immune system, raise blood pressure,and increase the number of platelets, which cause clots and potentially fatalcoronary artery blockages. The average child laughs hundreds of times a day. Theaverage adult laughs only a dozen times a day. If only we could collect thoselost laughs and use them to our advantage. One person was able to do this quiteeffectively.In Norman Cousins’s classic book, Anatomy of an Illness, he describes how heused laughter to treat a debilitating immune disorder that attacked his bodycalled ankylosing spondylitis. The illness caused him pain, fatigue, and a greatdeal of anxiety. He believed that he became sick because he was over-tired fromtravel and work, and his body was in a state of adrenal exhaustion. He went fromdoctor to doctor, took medicine after medicine, and was not getting better. Onespecialist estimated his chances of recovery at one in five hundred. Inpartnership with his physician, he gradually stopped all of his medications,added large doses of intravenous vitamin C, and began a program of laughter.Allen Funt, famed producer of the television series Candid Camera, sent himfilms of the TV series along with a projector for his laughter therapy. He alsowatched Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy films. He discovered that ten minutesof a genuine belly laugh had a pain relieving effect and would give him restfulsleep for two hours. He laughed and laughed. After a period of time, his illnessstarted to improve and eventually went away.Put laughter in your life every day. Watch comedies (this could be a helpfulform of TV), go to comedy clubs, read joke books (my favorite is the Far Side byGary Larson), and swap jokes with your friends. President Lincoln suffered fromserious periods of depression. He used laughter and telling jokes as one form ofmedicine. Here are three of my favorite humorous Lincoln sayings.• Common-looking people are the best in the world: that is the reason the Lordmakes so many of them.• If I were two-faced, would I be wearing this one?• It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him asentence to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in alltimes and situations. They presented him the words: “And this, too, shall passaway.”9. RELY ON A MORAL COMPASSAnother characteristic of resilience is relying on a strong moral compass and asolid core belief system. Having a commitment to deeply religious or spiritualbeliefs and practices seems to have a protective effect on physical andemotional well-being and helps people cope with stress and illness. A recentsurvey of the available scientific literature involving 126,000 people inforty-two independent studies indicated that spiritual practice or religiousparticipation was highly correlated with a longer life and survival once anillness was present. Additionally, strong religious beliefs have been correlatedwith a decreased incidence of depression in numerous studies, ranging fromstudents to grief stricken adults to elderly who were medically ill. In asimilar way, teenagers who attended church services had lower suicide rates thanthose who didn’t. The specific religious affiliation did not seem to matter inthe studies.Obviously, people who have a strong moral compass are not limited to those withreligious beliefs. It is likely that morality is intrinsic to human nature.Greek philosopher Epictetus, living in the first century A.D., wrote: “Every oneof us has come into this world with innate conceptions as to good and bad, nobleand shameful, fitting and inappropriate.” Moral sense is necessary in ahigh-functioning society. In looking at the brain, it becomes obvious thatmorality is brain based. When the prefrontal cortex is damaged, some peopleacquire sociopathic tendencies.Caring for others is putting one’s moral compass into action. Altruism is apowerful enhancer of resilience. During World War II, people who cared forothers after bombing attacks suffered less depression and anxiety than would beexpected. Those who suffered with symptoms before the bombs had a significantdecrease in symptoms afterward if they were helping others. Many people findmeaning in tragedy and use their suffering to help others. When that happens,resilience is enhanced.10. NURTURE SOCIAL SUPPORTRelationships are critical to how we deal with stress and trauma. In hiswonderful book Love and Survival, cardiologist Dean Ornish detailed the manybenefits from having close relationships. Dr. Ornish cited numerous studiesindicating that those who feel close, connected, loved, and supported have alower incidence of depression, anxiety, suicide, heart disease, infections,hypertension, and cancer. Connection enhances brain function and aidesresilience.I was a military psychiatrist for seven years. One of the most striking findingsI discovered was that the incidence of suicides and suicide attempts amongmilitary service personnel and their dependents peaked in the months of Januaryand July. In a civilian population, suicide is highest in April. What wasresponsible for the discrepancy between the civilian and military population?January and July are the months of military moves. When people move they becomedisconnected from their social support network and are at greater risk fordepression and suicide. They are less resilient. I frequently treated militarywives who became depressed for six months after a move. Their depression seemedto lift after they developed a new social network—friends, church participation,social groups. The women who did not become depressed were much more skilled ingetting involved and developing social support right away.Enhancing emotional bonds can help increase resilience and heal anxiety anddepression. In one large study in which patients were treated for majordepression, the National Institutes of Health compared three approaches:antidepressant medication, cognitive therapy (the automatic negative thoughtstherapy discussed earlier), and interpersonal therapy or teaching people how toget along better with those they loved. Researchers were surprised to find thatthe treatments were equally effective in treating depression. Not surprising wasthe fact that combining all three treatments had an even more powerful effect.How you get along with other people can either help or hurt your brain! Ourday-to-day interactions with others enhance the brain or tear down how it works.Being more connected to the people in your life helps you strengthen your brain.Love is as powerful as drugs and usually a lot more fun.

Unlike polar bears, humans belong to a relational species. Weend up enlisting and using the brains of thousands of people, maybe more, duringa lifetime. Acquiring and implementing the behaviors that encourage your socialcommunities to thrive is essential for a magnificent mind. Relating effectivelyto other people is ultimately a brain-based skill. When your brain is healthyyou can perceive others more accurately, have good control over your emotions,and act in a healthy way that brings people toward you. Your brain allows you toread social cues, listen, respond appropriately, deal with conflict, actinclusively, and be attentive in the moment of interactions. A brain with shortcircuits often interrupts effective relationships. As you care for your brain,your relationships improve.The brain health of the people you interact with also matters to individualhappiness and success. Brains nurture, influence, stimulate, irritate, calm, andincite each other. Being raised by a parent with a difficult brain, having aspouse or boss with brain problems, even dealing with a friend, teacher, or ajudge who needs brain help can cause immeasurable stress to those in theirimmediate sphere. Understanding the dynamics of brain health in relationshipswill give you an advantage that few other people have.The first practical step in enhancing relationships is to make brain health animportant aspect of your family, friendships, and work. With proper education,brain health can become a common goal. When groups of people come together, hereare some simple strategies.• Make ordering food at restaurants a collaborative effort, focusing onbrain-healthy options, such as salmon, salads, and vegetables.• Spend time together taking walks and playing word games rather than gettingdrinks at a bar, eating chili cheese fries at the burger place, or playingviolent video games.• Supply healthy foods at meetings and parties, not just pastries, muffins,sodas, candy, or alcohol.• Get the candy off the desks at work.• Exercise together at work by taking group walks during lunch.• Make sure others wear their seat belts when traveling together.• Avoid too much alcohol or too much caffeine.As brain health enters the consciousness of relationships, it becomes easier tointeract, because the group brain is working better.What Brain Skills Do You Need to Be a People Person?Professor Howard Markman, Ph.D., director of the Center for Marital and FamilyStudies at the University of Denver, can predict with 90 percent accuracy whowill get divorced and who will stay married after watching only a fifteen-minuteconversation between couples in which they are instructed to discuss an issuewhere they disagree. More important, he found that he could reduce divorce byone third in the couples to whom he taught several critical skills. If theargument between the couple involved a significant amount of blaming,belittling, escalation, invalidation, or withdrawal, their future was not likelyto be happy. On the other hand, if the couple communicated respect, sharedpurpose, and stopped escalation in a respectful way, the future would look muchmore positive. The great news is that these skills can be taught, and they areenhanced by a healthy brain that can remember them.In this chapter I will discuss eight clinically proven steps to increase yourpeople skills in any situation. These techniques come from research in the fieldof interpersonal therapy. Enhancing interpersonal skills has proven effective indecreasing stress and promoting business effectiveness, and it hasantidepressant qualities. In several studies this technique has been shown to beas effective as antidepressant medication in treating serious mood disorders. Icoined the acronym RELATING to help you remember the steps. R for responsibilityE for empathyL for listeningA for assertivenessT for timeI for inquiryN for noticing what you like more than what you don’tG for connecting with great groups R IS FOR RESPONSIBILITY“It is my job to make this relationship better.”“I have power to improve how we communicate and act toward each other.”“I have influence in my relationships that I exert in a positive way.”“I am responsible for my behavior in our interactions.”People who feel a sense of empowerment and personal responsibility do better inrelationships. Those who constantly blame others set up a lifetime of problems.The first and most devastating hallmark of self-defeating behavior inrelationships is blaming other people for how your life is turning out. Wheneveryou blame someone else, you become a victim of their moods and behavior and youcannot change anything. You are powerless. Typically, you’ll hear yourself saythings like “It wasn’t my fault that you took things the wrong way” or “Thatwouldn’t have happened if you had listened to me” or “It’s your fault that weare having trouble.”The bottom-line statement goes something like this: “If only you had donesomething differently, then I wouldn’t be in the predicament I am in. It’s yourfault, and I am not responsible.”Blaming others for relationship troubles or making excuses when things don’t goas you would like is the first step in a dangerous downhill slide. The slidegoes something like this: Blames others“It’s your fault.”||Sees life as beyond personal control“My life would be better if you hadn’t done…”||Feels like a victim of circumstances“If only you would be different, then…”||Gives up trying“It is never going to work. Why try?” Blaming others serves the purpose of temporarily ridding ourselves of feelingsof guilt or responsibility. However, it also reinforces the idea that your lifeis out of control, that others can determine how things are going to go for you.This causes much inner turmoil, leading to anxiety and feelings of helplessness.Sarah came to see me for marital stress. She had been in psychotherapy withanother psychiatrist for over three years but seemed to be getting nowhere. Shecomplained that her husband was an alcoholic who mistreated her. She was oftentearful, depressed, and had problems concentrating. In our initial interview itwas clear that she took no responsibility for how her life was turning out. Sheblamed her first husband for getting her pregnant at age nineteen. She then felt“forced” to marry him but complained that he was unmotivated so she divorcedhim. Then in succession she impulsively married two different men who werealcoholics and physically abusive toward her. Tearfully, she expressed herfeelings of being continually victimized by men, including her current husband.At the end of the session I asked her what she had done to contribute to theproblems she had. Her mouth dropped open. Her other psychiatrist had been a goodpaid listener, but he never challenged her notion of helplessness. At thebeginning of the next session she told me that she almost hadn’t come back tosee me. She said, “You think it’s all my fault, don’t you?” I replied, “I don’tthink it’s all your fault, but I think you’ve contributed to your troubles morethan you give yourself credit for, and if it’s true that you’ve contributed toyour problems then you can do things to change them. As long as you stay aninnocent victim of others there’s nothing you can do to help yourself.”In several sessions she got the message of personal responsibility and made adramatic turnaround. As a child she grew up in a severely abusive alcoholic homewhere she really was a victim of her circumstances; unfortunately for her, shemaintained that role in her adult relationships and work. Her unconsciouscontinuation of her abusive childhood was ruining her ability to have control inher life.Invariably, in classes where I teach this concept I’ll have a person tell methat her problem is not blaming others but blaming herself for the difficultiesin her life. One woman who had been sexually abused by her father said that formany years she had blamed herself for the abuse and was now learning not toblame herself. I told her that these two concepts—blaming others versus blamingyourself—are not mutually exclusive. She was certainly not responsible for herfather’s abuse, and there are things that have happened to you that aren’t yourfault. It is possible to go overboard blaming yourself for troubles and gettingstuck in such a mire of guilt that you become powerless to change your life. Agood “personal responsibility” statement goes something like this: “Bad thingshave happened in my life, some of which I had something to do with and some not.Either way, I need to learn from these experiences and be responsible to findways to overcome the difficulties and bad feelings that resulted.”Taking responsibility in relationships means continually asking yourself whatyou can do to make the relationship better. When my patients thoughtfullyevaluate and change their own behavior their relationships often dramaticallyimprove. The wisdom for so many years in the mental health field was that wehave no control over the behavior of others. The saying goes, “We are justresponsible for ourselves.” My experience tells me that it is not completelytrue. We have a lot of influence on how others behave. I often ask my patientswhat they do to make their relationships better. They usually can come up with anumber of positive behaviors. Then I ask them what they do to make therelationships worse. Initially, they hesitate, not wanting to face theirnegative behaviors, but after a bit of time they start to own up to the myriadbehaviors we need to work on. Here is an example.Eight-year-old Carlos came to my office to address behavioral problems,especially those he was experiencing at home. He started by telling me how muchhe hated his younger sister. “She irritates me all the time,” he said. “I haveno choice but to yell at her and hit her.”When he said he had no choice, my eyebrows reflexively raised.Seeing my reaction, he justified his behavior further. “I had no choice. Sheirritates me all the time.”“What do you do to irritate her?” I asked softly.“Nothing.” Then he paused and repeated, “Absolutely nothing.”I sat quietly.“Well,” he paused and then showed a wry smile, “I take some of her thingssometimes.”“Anything else?”Carlos had the look of thinking hard. “I yell at her, tell her she cannot playwith me, and ignore her when she talks to me.”“Okay,” I said. “You do irritate her. I sort of suspected it. But what do you dothat makes her happy?”He then listed several things he did that helped them get along better,including playing with her, helping her with her kindergarten homework, sayingthank you, smiling at her. He had a lot more power than he believed. Tapping into Carlos’s power to make his relationship with his sister better, as well asknowing his ability to make things worse, helped change his victim mentality andultimately his behavior. What can you do today to make your relationshipsbetter? You win more in relationships when you stay away from blaming the otherperson and asking yourself what you can do better.E IS FOR EMPATHYIf, as a result of reading this book, you get only one thing—an increasedtendency to think always in terms of the other person’s point of view, and seethings from his angle as well as your own—if you get only that one thing fromthis book, it may easily prove to be one of the milestones of your career.—DALE CARNEGIE, How to Win Friends and Influence PeopleWhile writing this book I was on vacation with my family in Hawaii. I wasreading a book on the pull-out sofa bed with our four-year-old, Chloe. Hermother walked into the room and accidentally bumped into the corner of thetelevision armoire. Watching what happened, Chloe immediately said, “Ouch” as ifshe felt the pain herself. Touched by her caring, Tana gave Chloe a hug and toldher she was okay. That simple interaction stayed with me all during the trip. Itwas the essence of empathy, the human ability to feel what others feel. Iwondered if my patients with autism, who are so poor at reading socialinteractions, would have understood the importance of the event. Chloe’s mirrorneurons were at work.In an exciting piece of research serendipity, Italian neuroscientists GiacomoRizzolatti, Leonardo Fogassi, and Vittorio Gallese placed recording electrodesinto the inferior frontal cortex of the macaque monkey. As the researchers wereworking to carefully map neurons to the monkey’s actions, Fogassi was standingnext to a bowl of fruit. When he reached for a banana some of the monkey’sneurons reacted. Even though the monkey hadn’t reached, his neurons associatedwith reaching fired away. These weren’t the neurons that reflect thinking aboutsomeone else reaching; they were neurons that supposedly fire only when thesubject reaches. The “mirror neurons,” as Rizzolatti labeled them, were firstidentified as a relatively primitive system in monkeys. It was then discoveredthat such systems in humans were sophisticated and “allow us to grasp the mindsof others not through traditional conceptual reasoning, but through directsimulation—by feeling, not by thinking.”Back to autism: in a fascinating article published in Nature Neuroscience,researchers indeed found mirror neuron deficits in these children. To examinemirror neuron abnormalities in autism, high-functioning children with autism andmatched controls underwent a functional brain study, called fMRI, whileimitating and observing emotional expressions. Although both groups performedthe tasks equally well, children with autism showed no mirror neuron activity inthe inferior frontal gyrus. Notably, activity in this area was inversely relatedto symptom severity in the social domain, suggesting that a dysfunctional mirrorneuron system may underlie the social deficits observed in autism.The mirror neuron system seems to be foundational to empathy. When it ishealthy, we can experience the feelings of others. When the system works toohard, we can be too sensitive. When it does not work hard enough we can likelyhurt others without its bothering us. A healthy system, like so many parts ofthe brain, helps us best.Empathy helps us navigate the social environment and answer such questions as Isthis person going to feed me? Love me? Attack me? Faint? Run away? Cry? The moreaccurately you can predict the actions and needs of others, the better off youare. The ability to “tune in” and empathize with others is a prerequisite forunderstanding, attachment, bonding, and love—all of which are important for oursurvival.In several studies about why executives fail, “insensitivity to others,” or alack of empathy, was cited more than any other flaw as a reason for derailment.Statements like the following were typically used about those who did notsucceed: “He never negotiated; there was no room for any views contrary to his.”“He could follow a bull through a china shop and still break the china.”“He made others feel stupid.”“She was always talking down to her employees.”“Whenever something went right, he took all the credit. Whenever things fellthrough, heads would roll.”“It was her way or no way. If you disagreed with her, you were out.” Lack of empathy can cause failure in almost any endeavor. A lack ofinterpersonal skills not only causes others to avoid you, but it can make them“mad as hell” and feel active ill will toward you too. Co-workers may look theother way if you are making serious mistakes, lovers may start finding fault inany area they can to retaliate for their hurt, and acquaintances may startmaking excuses to decrease the time they spend with you. Lacking empathy alsohas a serious isolating effect that not only causes loneliness but alsodecreases the “reality” feedback from others and cuts you off from co-workers’or friends’ creativity and knowledge. One example from my practice is of asupervisor who came back to his office after being chewed out by the owner of acompany. He snapped at his assistant for not having a report ready. She had justreturned from taking her child to the emergency room because he cut his headopen falling against the corner of a table at day care. She started to cry andran into the bathroom. The supervisor and assistant didn’t speak to each otherfor a week and she finally quit a job she needed. If, instead of thinking onlyof their own trying days, each had taken a minute to think about what was goingon with the other (empathy), this fight could have been avoided.How is your empathy? Can you feel what others feel? Do you sabotage yourrelationships by being insensitive? Do you take the behavior of others toopersonally? Or when someone dumps on you, do you wonder what might be going onwith him that caused him to act that way? Of course, you can carry that lastquestion to an extreme and attribute any negative criticism directed your way assomeone else’s problem. Balance is the key. When negative stuff comes your way,you always need to ask yourself two questions. First, did I do anything to bringthis on myself? Second, what is going on with him to cause him to act that way?Those two questions will help you to be more sensitive to other people andincrease your chances for success.Developing empathy involves a number of important skills, including mirroring,being able to get outside of yourself, and treating others in a way you’d liketo be treated. The following three exercises were designed to help you increaseyour empathic skills—your ability to get outside of yourself and understand theneeds of others.MIRRORINGYour ability to understand and communicate with others will be enhanced bylearning what psychiatrists call the mirroring technique. You can use thistechnique in any interpersonal situation to increase rapport with those aroundyou. When you mirror someone, you assume or imitate his body language—posture,eye contact, and facial expression—and you use the same words and phrases inconversation that the other person uses. For example, if someone is leaningforward in his chair, looking intensely at you, without making a big point ofit, do the same. If you note that he uses the same phrase several times, such as“I believe we have a winner here,” pick it up and make it part of yourvocabulary for that conversation. This is not mimicry, which implies ridicule;rather, this technique helps set up an unconscious identification with you inthe mind of the other person.THE GOLDEN RULE EXERCISEAnother exercise that will help you get outside of yourself and into thefeelings of others is what I call the Golden Rule Exercise. In one interactionper day, treat someone else as you would like to be treated in that situation.For example, if your spouse has a headache when you feel amorous, instead offeeling rejected make a conscious effort to understand and say something like“It must be awful to have a headache before going to bed. Can I get anything foryou?” This line will get you more in the way of passion than the accusation “Youalways have a headache!”THE GET-OUTSIDE-OF-YOURSELF EXERCISEThe next couple of times you get into a disagreement with someone, take her sideof the argument. At least verbally, begin to agree with her point of view. Arguefor it, understand it, see where she’s coming from. Although this can be adifficult exercise, it will pay royally if you use it to learn to understandothers better. To do this exercise effectively, you must first listen to theopposing point of view without interrupting. Really listening is difficult, butif you concentrate on repeating back what you hear, you’ll be almost there.Note: What you’ll also notice when you do this exercise is that a difficultperson will become less difficult. By agreeing with them you’ll take the windout of their sails and deflate their anger. I have seen this technique workwonders.L IS FOR LISTENINGPoor communication is at the core of many relationship problems. Jumping toconclusions, mind reading, and always having to be right are only a few traitsthat doom communication. When people do not connect with each other in ameaningful way, their own minds take over the “relationship” and many imaginaryproblems arise. This occurs at home, with friends, and at work.Donna was frequently angry at her husband. During the day, she’d imagine theirevening together in which they spent time talking and being attentive to eachother’s needs. When her husband came home tired and preoccupied about a hard dayat work, she felt disappointed and reacted angrily toward him. Her husband feltbewildered. He was unaware of his wife’s thoughts during the day and didn’t knowhe was disappointing her. After six couples sessions, the wife learned how toexpress her needs up front and she found a very receptive man.Too often in relationships we have expectations and hopes that we never clearlycommunicate to our partners or colleagues. We assume they should know what weneed and become disappointed when they don’t accurately read our minds. Clearcommunication is essential if relationships are to be mutually satisfying.Here are ten ways that communication is sabotaged in relationships.1. Poor attitude. This is where you expect the conversation to go nowhere andsubsequently you don’t even try to direct it in a positive way. Negativeassumptions about the other person feeds into this poor attitude. You don’ttrust the other person and you remain stiff and guarded when you are together.2. Unclear expectations and needs. Do you expect people to guess what you wantor need? It is great when others can anticipate our needs, but most people areso busy that it’s hard for them to see the needs of other people. That does notmake them good or bad; it simply means it’s important to speak up about what youneed.3. No reinforcing body language. Body language is so important because it sendsboth conscious and unconscious messages. When you fail to make eye contact oracknowledge the other person with facial or body gestures, he or she begins tofeel lost, alone, and unenthusiastic about continuing the conversation. Eyecontact and physical acknowledgment are essential to good communication.4. Competing with distractions. Distractions frequently doom communication. It’snot a good idea, for example, for my daughter to talk to me about somethingimportant during the fourth quarter of a Lakers basketball play-off game.Decrease distractions to have clear communication.5. Never asking for feedback on what you’re saying. You might assume that youare sending clear messages to the other person when, in fact, what theyunderstand is completely different from what you meant. Feedback is essential toclear communication.6. Kitchen sinking. This occurs in arguments when people feel backed into acorner and bring up unrelated issues from the past in order to protectthemselves or intensify the disagreement. Stay on track until an issue is fullydiscussed.7. Mind reading. This is where you arbitrarily predict what another person isthinking and then react on that “imagined” information. Mind reading is often aprojection of what you think. Even after couples have been married for thirtyyears it’s impossible for them to always be right about what is going on in theother person’s head. Checking things out is essential to good communication.8. Having to be right. This destroys effective communication. When a person hasto be right in a conversation there is no communication, only a debate.9. Sparring. Using putdowns, sarcasm, or discounting the other’s ideas erodesmeaningful dialogue and sets up distance in relationships.10. Lack of monitoring and follow-up. Often it takes repeated efforts to getwhat you need. It’s very important not to give up. When you give up asking forwhat you need, you often silently resent the other person, which subverts thewhole relationship. Persistence is very important to getting what you want.Clear communication is a key to success in almost any area of life. Too often inpersonal or business relationships we have hopes and expectations that we neverclearly communicate to others. As a consultant to organizations and businesses,I’ve found that the underlying problem in employer-employee disputes was often alack of clear communication. In many cases, when the communication problems wereimproved other problems were also quickly resolved.For example, Billie Jo was an administrative assistant who was frequently angryat her boss. He would give her general guidelines for projects and then becomeirritated with her when it wasn’t done to his satisfaction. Because of his gruffmanner, she was too afraid to ask him specific questions about the work. Shebegan to really hate her job. She developed frequent headaches and neck tensionand was constantly looking for another job. A friend pushed her to tell her bossabout her frustrations. The friend said, “If you’re going to quit anyway, youhave little to lose.” To her surprise, the boss was receptive to her directapproach and encouraged her to ask more questions about the projects heassigned.Here are six keys to effective communication in relationships.1. Have a good attitude and assume the other person wants the relationship towork as much as you do. Too often people become caught up in their own anger anddisappointment and they unknowingly set things up to turn out poorly. Having agood attitude can set the mood for a positive outcome. I call this having“positive basic assumptions” about the relationship.2. State what you need clearly and in a positive way. Most people are toowrapped up in themselves to think about what’s going on with you. In mostsituations being direct is the best approach. But how you ask is important. Youcan demand and be met with hostility, you can ask in a meek manner and no onewill take you seriously, or you can be firm yet kind in the way you ask and getwhat you need. How you approach someone has a lot to do with your success rate.3. Decrease distractions and make sure you have the other person’s attention.Find a time when the person is not busy or in a hurry to go somewhere.4. Ask for feedback to ensure the other person correctly understands you. Clearcommunication is a two-way street and it’s important to know if you got yourmessage across. A simple “Tell me what you understood I said” is often all thatis needed.5. Be a good listener. Before you respond to what people say, repeat back whatyou think they’ve said to ensure that you’ve correctly heard them. Statementssuch as “I hear you saying…” or “You mean to say…” are the gold standard of goodcommunication. This allows you to check out what you hear before you respond.6. Monitor and follow up on your communication. Often it takes repeated effortsto get what you need. It’s very important not to give up.ACTIVE LISTENINGThe “I hear you saying…,” or active listening, technique is taught by therapiststo increase communication. It forces you to really hear and understand what theother person is saying. This technique involves repeating back what you haveunderstood the other person to say. In this way, you check out with the senderwhether the message you received is the one you were intended to get.Communication often breaks down because of distortions between intention andunderstanding, especially in emotionally charged encounters. Simply saying, “Ihear you saying…Is that what you meant?” can help avoid misunderstandings. Thistechnique is particularly helpful when you suspect a breakdown in communication.Different phrases to use with this technique include the following. “I heard you say…Am I right?”“Did you mean to say…?”“I’m not sure I understand what you said. Did you say…?”“Did I understand you correctly? Are you saying that…?”“Let me see if I understand what you’re saying to me. You said…?” Here are the advantages to active listening.1. You receive more accurate messages.2. Misunderstandings are cleared up immediately.3. You are forced to give your full attention to the other person.4. Both parties are now responsible for accurate communication.5. The sender is likely to be more careful with what he says.6. It increases your ability to really hear the other person and thus learn fromhim.7. It stops you from thinking about what you’re going to say next so that youcan really hear what the other person is saying.8. It increases communication.9. It tends to cool down conflicts.Begin practicing this technique on at least two people every day for a week. Seeif it doesn’t increase your communication abilities and thus your ability tolearn from others.A IS FOR ASSERTIVENESSIt’s very important to say what you mean. Assertiveness and communication gohand in hand. Assertiveness means you express your thoughts and feelings in afirm yet reasonable way, not allowing others to emotionally run over you and notsaying yes when it’s not what you mean. Do not equate assertiveness withbecoming mean or aggressive. Here are five rules to help you assert yourself ina healthy manner.1. Do not give in to the anger of others just because it makes youuncomfortable. Anxious people do this a lot. We’re just so anxious that we justagree. But by just agreeing, we’re actually teaching that other person to bemean to us. We’re teaching the other person that it’s okay to manipulate us withanger. It doesn’t mean you have to be angry back, but don’t agree just becauseyou’re feeling anxious. When you are feeling anxious about another person’sanger, it is a good time to do the deep breathing techniques I taught youearlier. Take three deep, slow breaths and really think about what your opinionis; state it clearly without much emotion.2. Do not allow the opinion of others to control how you feel. Your opinion,within reason, needs to be the one that counts for you. What do you think aboutthat situation? People with anxiety tend to flip-flop on their position. Work onknowing what you think and believe.3. Say what you mean and stick up for what you believe is right. People respectyou more. People like you more if you are a real person who says exactly what’son your mind.4. Maintain self-control. Being angry, mean, or aggressive is not beingassertive. Be assertive in a calm and clear way.5. Be kind, if possible. But above all be firm in your stance. We teach otherpeople how to treat us. When we give in to their temper tantrums we actuallyteach them that that is a way to control us. When we assert ourselves in a firmyet kind way others have more respect for us and they treat us accordingly. Now,if you’ve allowed others to emotionally run over you for a long time, they’regoing to be a little resistant to change. If you stick to your guns, you helpthem learn a new way of relating to you, and the relationship will be better.Ultimately, you will respect yourself more.T IS FOR TIMERelationships require actual time. With our lives already constrained bytwo-parent working households, traffic-intensive commutes, e-mail, the Internet,television, video games, and other distractions, the time we have available forthe people in our lives is seriously diminished. But making time for the peoplewho are important to you will make a huge difference in your relationships. WhenI teach our parenting course, I emphasize time. In the course I sayrelationships really require two things, time and a willingness to listen. Timeis critically important to relationships. It doesn’t have to be a lot of time,but it needs to be focused on the relationship.There’s an exercise in my parenting course I call Special Time. It involvesspending twenty minutes a day doing something with your child that he or shewants to do. Twenty minutes is not much time, but this exercise makes a hugedifference in the quality of relationships. During this time, I have one rule:no commands, no questions, and no directions. It’s not a time to try to resolveissues; it is just a time to be together and do something your partner wants todo, whether it’s playing a game or taking a walk. The difference it made inparent-child relationships was much more dramatic than anything else I did forthem, including medicine. Look for ways to spend time on the relationships thatare important to you. Think of the time as an investment in the health of therelationship.You also need to be present when you are spending time with others at work or athome. Too often, there are so many distractions. In the powerful bookInfluencer: The Power to Change Anything, the authors tell a story about a largeregional health care organization that went from terrible customer satisfactionto becoming one of the region’s class organizations. In studying the employeeswho ranked great versus those who were poor, there were only five simpledifferences. The effective employees smiled, made eye contact, identifiedthemselves by name, let people know what they were doing and why, and endedevery interaction by asking, “Is there anything else you need?” These thingswere easy to do. They indicated that the service providers were present andfocused on the interaction at hand.I IS FOR INQUIRYEarlier in the book we discussed killing the ANTs, or automatic negativethoughts, that invade your mind. When you’re suffering in a relationship it’svery important to inquire into the thoughts that make you suffer. For example,if you are fighting with your husband and you hear yourself thinking, “He neverlistens to me,” write that down. Then ask yourself if it is true. The littlelies we tell ourselves about other people often put unnecessary wedges betweenus and them. Relationships require accurate thinking in order to thrive.Whenever you feel sad, mad, or nervous in relationships, check out yourthoughts. If there are ANTs or lies, stomp them out.N IS FOR NOTICING WHAT YOU LIKE MORE THAN WHAT YOU DON’TOne of the secrets to having great relationships is noticing what you like morethan what you don’t. When you do this you are shaping the other person’sbehavior. Noticing what you like encourages more of the behavior you like tohappen. I learned this concept for the first time when my son was seven yearsold and we were living in Hawaii. I was in my child psychiatryfellowship-training program.One day I wanted special time with my son, Antony. I took him to a place calledSea Life Park, which is like SeaWorld. And we had a great day together. We wentto the killer whale show, the dolphin show, and saw sea lion antics on-stage.Toward the end of the day my son sort of grabbed my shirt and said, “Daddy, takeme to see Fat Freddie.” I said, “Who’s Fat Freddie?” “It’s the penguin, Dad,” hesaid. I looked on the show schedule and there was one more Fat Freddie show. FatFreddie was an emperor penguin who performed in the large stadium at Sea LifePark. When we got to our seats the stadium was filled.Freddie was amazing. To start the show he climbed a ladder to a high divingboard. He went to the end of the board, bounced up and down, then jumped intothe water. When he got out of the water, on command he bowed with his nose,counted with his flippers, and jumped through a hoop of fire. I thought tomyself, “How cool is this?” And my son was clapping. He was very happy that wewere at the show. Toward the end of the show, the trainer asked Freddie toretrieve something. Freddie went and got it and brought it to the trainer. In mymind, when I saw this action, I thought, “Damn, I ask this kid to get mesomething and he wants to have a discussion for twenty minutes and then hedoesn’t do it.” I knew my son was smarter than the penguin. I used to findmyself frequently frustrated and angry at my son.After the show I went up to the trainer and asked her how she got Fat Freddie todo all the things he did. The trainer understood what I was asking her, becauseshe looked at my son and then she looked at me and said, “Unlike parents,whenever Freddie does anything like what I want him to do, I notice him. I givehim a hug and I give him a fish.” The light went on in my head that whenever myson did what I wanted him to do I paid no attention to him because I’m a busyguy. But when he didn’t do what I wanted him to do, I gave him a ton ofattention because I didn’t want to raise bad kids. I was inadvertently teachinghim to be a little monster in order to get my attention. So now I actuallycollect penguins to remind myself to notice what I like about others more thanwhat I do not like. I have more than two thousand penguins.What do you think Fat Freddie would have done if he were having a bad day anddidn’t do what the trainer asked him to do? What if the trainer startedscreaming at him, “You stupid penguin. I can’t believe I ever met a penguin asstupid as you. We ought to ship you off to the Antarctic and get a replacement.”Depending on his temperament, if he understood her, he would have either bittenher or gone off to a corner and cried.What do you do when the important people in your life do not do what you wantthem to do? Do you criticize them and make them feel miserable? Or do you justpause and notice what you like more than what you don’t like? This is a criticalpoint. It is an important secret to changing behavior. Focus on the behaviorsthat you like, eight, ten, twenty times more than the behaviors you don’t. Thisdoesn’t mean you’re not assertive when you need to be. But it means in your mindyou’re figuring out how to shape the situation in a positive way.G IS FOR CONNECTING WITH GREAT GROUPSContinually working to build your support groups buffers you against many of thestresses you are likely to face. Within those groups, who you spend time withmatters. When you are with positive, supportive, and loving people, you willfeel happier, more content, and you’ll likely live longer. In a study at CaseWestern Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio, ten thousand men were asked, “Does your wifeshow you her love?” The detailed health histories of the men followed for overten years who answered yes showed fewer ulcers and less chest pain and livedlonger than whose who answered no.When you spend time with negative or hostile people, you tend to feel tense,anxious, upset, and sick, and you increase your stress hormones. Increases inthe stress hormone cortisol can disrupt neurons in the hippocampus, one of themain memory centers in the brain. Through the years people have told me thatliving with a person who suffered from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,depression, panic disorder, ADD, or borderline personality disorder has had anegative impact on their physical and emotional health. The chronic stress forfamily members associated with these illnesses when they are untreated orundertreated can be devastating. Mothers of untreated ADHD children, forexample, have a higher incidence of depression themselves and often complainthat they are physically sick more often and cognitively less sharp than beforethey had the child.Look at your own situation. Are you surrounded by people who believe in you andwho give you positive messages? People who encourage you to feel good aboutyourself? Or do you spend time with people who are constantly putting you downand downplaying your ideas? Who are the five people you spend the most timewith? Are they positive or negative? Rate how you feel about each of therelationships on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being a very negative relationshipand 10 being an uplifting and supportive relationship. Use this information toevaluate your relationships to see which you need to work on and which ones youmay want to consider ending. As Oprah Winfrey says, “Surround yourself with onlythose people who are going to lift you higher.” I would add that this is a sureway to build a trusted support network.These eight keys will improve your relationships and help you build socialnetworks. Being responsible, empathic, listening, assertive, spending time,inquiring into negative thoughts, noticing what you like more than what youdon’t, and striving to spend time with positive people will all help you achieveyour maximum potential."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_046_r1.jpg]Be a Maverick Thinkerimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]STOP ANXIETY FROM ALLOWING OTHERS TO RUN YOUR LIFEI once dated a guy who was a Heisman trophy candidate and he told me they don’ttry to tackle you unless you are running with the ball.—A note from a grateful patientIt was 6:30 A.M. in the busy emergency room at the Walter Reed Army MedicalCenter in Washington, D.C. I was just putting on my white lab coat as I walkedthrough the doors to the unit. It was my third day as an intern and theemergency room would be my home for the next month. From down the hall I heard awoman screaming. Curious, I went to see what was going on.Beth, a forty-year-old woman, was lying on a gurney with a swollen right leg.She was in obvious pain and screamed whenever anyone touched her leg. BruceWhite, a brand-new psychiatry intern like myself, and Wendy Bernstein, theinternal medicine chief resident, were trying to start an IV in Beth’s foot. Thepatient was anxious, scared, uncooperative, and hyperventilating. She had ablood clot in her calf that caused tremendous swelling in her lower leg. The IVwas necessary before we could send Beth to radiology where a scan could be doneto see exactly where the clot was so the surgeons could operate to remove it.With each stick of the IV needle to her swollen foot Beth’s screams becamelouder. Wendy was anxious and frustrated; sweat started to appear on her face.She snapped at the patient, “Calm down!”Beth looked scared and confused. There was a lot of tension in the room.Wendy paged the surgeon on call. It took him several minutes to get back to her.She paced. When the phone rang, Wendy quickly answered it. “I need you to cometo the ER right away. I need you to do a ‘cut down’ on a patient’s foot. Itlooks like she has a blood clot in her leg and we need to start an IV beforesending her to x-ray. Her foot is swollen, and she’s being difficult!”Wendy listened for a few moments and then said, “What do you mean you can’t comefor an hour! This has got to be done right away. I’ll do it myself.” She cursedas she slammed down the phone.Hearing this, Beth looked even more panicked.Being a brand-new intern in the hospital, I didn’t want to say anything. But Ihated to see Beth in pain. I had heard of Wendy’s reputation for harassinginterns. It was going to be an interesting day, I thought.“Wendy, can I try to start the IV?” I softly said.She glared at me, and with a tone that was both sarcastic and condescending, shesaid, “Your name is Amen, right? I’ve been starting IVs for five years. Whatmakes you think you’re so special? But if you want to try and look stupid,hotshot, go for it.” She rudely tossed the IV set at me and left the room. Imotioned to Bruce to shut the door.The first thing I did was to walk around the gurney to Beth’s head and establisheye contact with her. I gave her a gentle smile. Wendy had been yelling at herfrom the other side of her feet.“Hi, Beth, I’m Dr. Daniel Amen. I need you to slow down your breathing. When youbreathe too quickly all of the blood vessels clamp down, making it impossiblefor us to find a vein. Breathe with me.” I slowed my own breathing down,thinking that Wendy was going to kill me when I finished.“Do you mind if I help you relax?” I asked. “I know some tricks.”“Okay,” Beth said nervously.“Look at that spot on the ceiling.” I pointed to a spot on the ceiling tilesoverhead. “I want you to focus on it and ignore everything else in the room…I’mgoing to count to ten, and as I do let your eyes feel very heavy. Only focus onthe spot and the sound of my voice. One…two…three…let your eyes feel veryheavy…four…five…let your eyes feel heavier still…six…seven…eight…your eyes arefeeling very heavy and want to close…nine…ten…let your eyes close and keep themclosed.“Very good,” I said as Beth closed her eyes. “I want you to breathe very slowly,very deeply, and pay attention only to the sound of my voice. Let your wholebody relax from the top of your head all the way down to the bottom of yourfeet. Let your whole body feel warm, heavy, and very relaxed. Now I want you toforget about the hospital and imagine yourself in a beautiful park. The mostbeautiful park you can think of. See the park, the grass, the hillside, a gentleflowing brook, beautiful trees. Hear the sounds in the park, the brook flowing,the birds singing, a light breeze rustling the leaves in the trees. Smell andtaste the freshness in the air. And feel the feelings in the park—a light breezeon your skin, the warmth of the sun.”All of the tension in the room had calmed down. Wendy popped her head in theroom, but Bruce put his finger over his lips for her to be quiet and motionedfor her to leave. She rolled her eyes and quietly shut the door.“Now I want you to imagine a beautiful pool in the middle of the park,” Icontinued. “It is filled with a special, warm healing water. In your mind, siton the edge of the pool and dangle your feet in it. Feel the warm water surroundyour feet. You are doing really great.”Beth had quickly gone into a deep trance.I continued. “Now I know this might sound strange, but many people can actuallymake blood vessels pop up if they direct their attention to them. With your feetin the pool, allow the blood vessels in your feet to pop up so that I can put anIV in it, so that you can get the help you need, still allowing your mind tostay in the park and feel very relaxed…”In medical school I took a month elective in hypnosis. I had watched a film ofan Indian psychiatrist put a patient in a hypnotic trance and had her pop up avein in her hand. Then she stuck a needle in the vein, removed it, and wasbleeding out of both sides of the puncture wounds. Then, with suggestion, shestopped the bleeding on one side of the vein and then the other side. It was oneof the most amazing feats of self-control I had seen. Thinking of Beth’ssituation reminded me of the film. In truth, I had no expectation that Bethwould actually be able to pop the vein up in her foot.To my great surprise, at that moment a vein clearly appeared on her swollenfoot. I gently slipped the needle into the vein and attached it to the bag of IVfluid.Bruce’s eyes widened. He couldn’t believe what he saw, even though he just sawit.“Beth,” I softly said, “you can stay in this deep relaxed state as long as youneed. You can go back to the park anytime you want.”Bruce and I wheeled Beth to radiology. When I returned to the unit an hourlater, Wendy gave me a hostile look.“So we have a maverick and miracle worker among us,” she said. “Remember whathappened to Jesus. I believe he was crucified. You might not want to make melook bad…you never know what might happen.”“I’m sorry to interfere,” I said. “When people are scared they breathe too fastand their blood vessels tend to constrict. I just asked her to slow down herbreathing. It was a simple trick I learned in medical school. The hypnosis wasto get her very relaxed. I’ve heard about people who could dilate veins underhypnosis. I thought it was worth a try.”“You just got lucky,” Wendy retorted. She wasn’t giving an inch.A female nurse overheard our conversation and said, “You can do hypnosis? Couldyou hypnotize me to get rid of these?” She pointed to the cigarettes in herpocket.An overweight male nurse chimed in, “Could you hypnotize me to lose weight?”Another female nurse said with excitement, “In nursing school I read about astudy where hypnosis was used to enlarge breast size. And it really worked! Canyou help me with these?” She pointed to her smallish breasts.Wendy looked disgusted. Totally embarrassed, I said, “I don’t know. I have a lotto do right now. I’ll see you all later.”Maverick ThinkingThe etymology of the word “maverick” is from the Texas lawyer Samuel Maverick,who refused to brand his cattle. It has come to represent people who think forthemselves. From the time I was young my father called me a maverick. It was nota compliment. I never went along with his ideas just to make peace. My olderbrother, Jimmy, was much more diplomatic with him, although he pounded meregularly when we were young. When I had my own thoughts or ideas I had toexpress them; it caused a fair amount of tension between my dad and me.When I was eighteen years old in July 1972, I had to sign up for the militarydraft. I drew the lottery number 19, out of 365, which meant that it was highlylikely I would be drafted. I talked to a military recruiter about my options. Atthe time, I was interested in becoming a veterinarian and I learned that thearmy had a program that would train me to become a veterinarian’s assistant.That sounded interesting. That night I told my father what I had learned. In hisusual way, he told me I couldn’t join the army. There was a war going on! When Ipushed the conversation, that I was likely to be drafted anyway and this jobsounded interesting, plus I could go to Europe rather than Vietnam, he said,“Good, I will drive you to the bus station.” I was sad that I couldn’t pleasehim, but there was no way he was making my decisions. Joining the military, andgetting some extra time to grow up before college and having time away from apowerful father, was one of the best decisions of my life.My father taught me that authority figures, even very successful ones, were notalways right. Years later, the maverick tendency has been one of thecornerstones of my own personal success. I was able to make decisionsindependently, even when others did not agree with me. The work we do at theAmen Clinics has been called maverick by many of our colleagues. We do brainimaging work in psychiatry, believing we need more information than the standardsymptom clusters most psychiatrists use to make diagnoses. We use nutritionalsupplements when we believe they may work instead of or in addition tomedication. We believe in educating our patients and the general public aboutbrain health, and publish high school and college courses to encourage it. Noneof this is standard fare for psychiatric clinics. But this is precisely why somany people have come to see us. Our patients want a different approach to thestandard fifteen-minute psychiatric appointments to get their medicationsrefilled.In their book Mavericks at Work: Why the Most Original Minds in Business Win,Bill Taylor and Polly LaBarre explain why innovators and upstarts are inventingthe future of business. They say, “If you want to know the future, inventit…Unconventional ideas and groundbreaking strategies will become the businessplan for the twenty-first century and a better way to lead, compete andsucceed.” In the right context, being a maverick is a critical trait of manysuccessful people.Going along just to get along, especially when things are not right, is harmfuland often demoralizing. There is no question that on the surface it would havebeen easier for me to go along with my father when he wanted me to agree withhim or with my chief resident, Wendy, but over time I would have lost my soul. Iwouldn’t have known where they ended and I began. Going along with others toquell your own internal anxiety or fear of rejection sets you up forfrustration, abuse, heartbreak, and a lack of original thought. In this chapter,I will discuss four traits of maverick thinkers and some fascinating brainimaging research about what inhibits people from thinking more independently orcreatively. Let me be clear: being a maverick does not mean being negative,oppositional, or argumentative. Being contrary just for the sake of beingdifferent is a two-year-old’s trait and a sign of an immature, rigid brain.What Is Maverick Thinking?Maverick thinking involves four traits.1. Independent thinking2. Not accepting the norm just because it is the norm3. Creativity or thinking in a way that is different from others’4. A passionate belief that you can make a differenceMavericks think for themselves. They are fiercely independent and believe intheir own abilities. They are good at listening to others, gathering neededdata, and doing their homework, but they synthesize information in their ownunique way. Some independent thinkers may come from having had encouraging earlyenvironments. Others may come from people who were actively discouraged, peoplewhose maverick tendencies emerged as a reaction to the overcontrol of theirparents, teachers, or coaches.Tony Dungy, coach of the 2007 Super Bowl champion Indianapolis Colts, describesmaverick thinking in his book Quiet Strength. A deeply religious man who wasencouraged by his father, Coach Dungy did not believe in yelling, cursing, orbelittling players. He tells them at the beginning of a season that he willnever talk louder than his usual voice and if he is really upset he, in fact, islikely to talk softer. He has been criticized for not having displayed moreemotion, like other coaches, but that is not his style. He has obviously beeneffective coaching his way.Independent thinkers tend not to follow rules just because someone else thinksthey should. They do not go along with the group norm just because there is anorm. Unlike sociopaths who break rules just because they can, mavericksevaluate the rules to see if they make sense. If the rules are working, they usethem to their advantage; if not, they look for better rules. Mavericks are smartand they are moral. They do not break rules that could cost them theirlivelihoods or damage the welfare of their families, unless there are reallygood reasons to do so.In their best-selling business book First, Break All the Rules: What the World’sGreatest Managers Do Differently, Gallup Organization consultants MarcusBuckingham and Curt Coffman challenge the thinking of many standard managementtechniques. They argue that commonly held notions about management (e.g., peopleare capable of almost anything and a manager’s role is diminishing in today’seconomy) are wrong. “Great managers,” they write, “are revolutionaries…Theybreak the rules and make ones that work.” The authors have culled theirobservations from more than eighty thousand interviews conducted by Gallupduring the past twenty-five years. Great managers, they argue, do not just gowith the flow.Rudolf Flesch, author of Why Johnny Can’t Read, once wrote that “creativethinking may mean simply the realization that there’s no particular virtue indoing things the way they always have been done.” Once you realize this concept,you are on your way to being a part of the maverick club. Being creative ishaving the ability to look at common things in an uncommon way, to take adifferent approach. Unfortunately, many people have come to erroneously equatecreativity with madness, citing van Gogh, Hemingway, and others as examples.Current medical research, however, teaches us that the healthier our brains, themore creative we are likely to be. Psychiatrist Daniel Offer, M.D., studiedseveral hundred teenagers to see what characterizes “normal” adolescence. Hedescribed three distinct patterns of psychological growth: turbulent, sporadic,and continuous. The turbulent group was in trouble most of the time duringadolescence, the sporadic group had periodic issues, and the continuous grouphad very few problems. Dr. Offer then gave the inkblot test to the young peoplein his study and found that those with the healthiest growth pattern (i.e., thecontinuous growth group) gave the most creative and unusual responses to thecards. Creativity correlated with health. Creative people explore all of theoptions available to them, conventional and unconventional, and they try newideas, even when they’re not sure if they will work out.The last hallmark of a maverick is the sense that your life matters, that youcan make a difference and have a positive impact. Having passion and purposedrives the maverick’s motives to create something useful or to buck the systemto make life more effective, more wonderful, more meaningful. As discussed inchapter 9, there are passion circuits in the brain that involve the nucleusaccumbens and basal ganglia. These brain areas respond to the neurotransmitterdopamine, which is involved with drive, motivation, and salience. The power ofbeing part of a group and being accepted by others is so strong, as we will seebelow, that in order to do something different, or outside the group, it must beintrinsically rewarding in and of itself or have deep personal meaning to you.Within two years of starting our brain imaging work, I created a firestorm ofcriticism among my colleagues. “Psychiatrists don’t do this” was something Iheard a lot. Being naturally anxious, I hated the criticism. It caused sleeplessnights and a general underlying uneasiness. For over a year I stopped talkingabout the work at the Amen Clinics. I was trying to figure out how to handle theconflict. Then late one night in April 1995 I received a phone call from mysister-in-law, Sherrie, who was in tears. She told me that Andrew, mynine-year-old nephew and godson, had attacked a little girl on the baseballfield that day for no particular reason. The attack was unprovoked and out ofthe blue. Sherrie told me that for the last year Andrew’s behavior had beengetting increasingly worse. His personality had changed from a sweet, happychild to someone who was angry and depressed, who had serious suicidal andhomicidal thoughts. In his room she found two drawings, one of him hanging froma tree, another one in which he was shooting other children. I told Sherrie tobring Andrew to see me the next day. His parents drove to my clinic, which waseight hours away.As I sat with Andrew and his parents I knew something was wrong. I had neverseen him look so angry or so sad. He had no explanations for his behavior otherthan “I am just mad all the time.” He said no one was hurting or teasing him. Hehad no idea why he felt the way he did. There was no family history of seriouspsychiatric illnesses or head injuries. And he had a wonderful family. Unlikemost clinical situations, I knew this family. Andrew’s parents were loving,caring, and concerned. What was the matter?The vast majority of my colleagues would have placed Andrew on some sort ofmedication and had him see a counselor for psychotherapy. Having performed morethan a thousand SPECT studies by that time, I first wanted a picture of Andrew’sbrain. But with my colleagues’ hostility over my imaging work fresh in my mind,I questioned myself. Maybe this was really due to a family problem that I justdidn’t know about. Maybe this was a psychological problem. (As an aside, if youhave good psychoanalytic training you can find dirt in anybody’s family.) Ithought, “Maybe Andrew is acting out because his older brother is a ‘perfect’child who does well in school and is very athletic. Maybe Andrew has thesethoughts and behaviors to ward off feelings of insecurity related to being thesecond son in a Lebanese family. Maybe Andrew wants to feel powerful and thesebehaviors are associated with issues of control.” Then logic took over my brain.Nine-year-old children do not attack other children for no reason. They do notnormally think about suicide or homicide. I needed to scan his brain. If itappeared normal, then I could look further into the underlying emotionalproblems that might be present.I went with Andrew to the imaging center and held his hand while he had thestudy performed. As his brain appeared on the computer screen I thought amistake had been done in performing the procedure. Andrew had no left temporallobe (see Image 16.1). Upon quick examination of the complete study, I realizedthe quality of the scan was fine. He was indeed missing the function of his lefttemporal lobe. Did he have a cyst, a tumor, a prior stroke? A part of me feltscared for him as I was looking at the monitor. Another part of me felt relievedthat we had some explanation for his aggressive behavior. My research and theresearch of others had implicated the left temporal lobe in aggression. The nextday Andrew had a magnetic resonance imaging scan, which showed a cyst (afluid-filled sac) about the size of a golf ball occupying the space where hisleft temporal lobe should have been. I knew the cyst had to be removed. Gettingsomeone to take this seriously, however, proved frustrating.image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_047_r1.jpg]Image 16.1: Andrew’s Missing Left Temporal Lobe (3-D underside surface view)Missing left temporal lobeThat day I called Andrew’s pediatrician in Orange, California, and told him ofboth the clinical situation and brain findings. I told him to find the bestperson possible to take this thing out of his head. He contacted three pediatricneurologists. All of them said that Andrew’s negative behavior was probably notin any way related to the cyst in his brain and they would not recommendoperating on him until he had “real symptoms.” When the pediatrician told methis information, I became furious. Real symptoms! I had a child with homicidaland suicidal thoughts who lost control over his behavior and attacked people. Icontacted a pediatric neurologist in San Francisco who told me the same thing. Ithen called a friend of mine at Harvard Medical School, also a pediatricneurologist, who told me yet again the same thing. She even used the words realsymptoms. When I pressed her, she attempted to clarify her reasoning. “When Isay ‘real symptoms,’ I mean problems like seizures or speech problems.” I wasangry and appalled! Could the medical profession really not connect the brain tobehavior? But I wasn’t going to wait until this child killed himself or someoneelse. I called the pediatric neurosurgeon Jorge Lazarette, M.D., at UCLA andtold him about Andrew. He told me that he had operated on three other childrenwith left temporal lobe cysts who were all aggressive. He wondered if it wasrelated. Thankfully, after evaluating Andrew he agreed to take it out.When Andrew woke up from the surgery he smiled at his mother. It was the firsttime in a year that he had smiled. Upon awaking from the surgery his aggressivethoughts were gone and his temperament changed back to the sweet child he alwayswanted to be. Andrew was lucky. He had someone who loved him paying attention tohis brain when his behavior was off. With this very personal experienceresonating in the memory and emotional centers of my brain, I decided that I hadto share this work with a larger audience, no matter how much criticism came myway. Sometimes I still cry when I think about or tell this story. I think of allthe children, teenagers, and adults who do terrible things that we just label asbad, evil, or less than human, even though we have never looked at their brains.We just condemn them. It is so much easier to judge people if you never look athow their brains struggle. Andrew is now age twenty-one; he’s employed and awonderful young man. That personal experience gave me the motivation and courageto deal with my critics and do the work I have loved for so long.Why Is Maverick Thinking So Rare?One of the biggest obstacles to maverick thinking is the powerful desire to beaccepted by our peer group. The need to belong, to be part of a group of family,friends, and colleagues, is hardwired in our brain. When we venture out on ourown, when we think independently for ourselves, we risk rejection or ridiculefrom the group we love.In a fascinating study from Emory University, researchers uncovered a key to howsocial cooperation is processed in the brain. Cooperation works on the samecenters as cocaine does. When we cooperate with others the pleasure circuitslight up, even when it costs us money. It feels good to get along. Cooperationreinforces itself. Literally, it feels bad to buck the group. James Rilling,Ph.D., Gregory Berns, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues scanned the brains ofthirty-six women while they played the Prisoner’s Dilemma game. This gameexplores cooperation based on the principle of reciprocal altruism.A little detail about the game will help you better understand the study.Prisoner’s Dilemma is a non-zero-sum game. A zero-sum game is simply a win-losegame such as tic-tac-toe, poker, or chess. For every winner, there’s a loser. IfI win, you lose. Non-zero-sum games allow for cooperation. There are moves thatbenefit both players. In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, you and Albert (the game gotits name from Princeton mathematician Albert Tucker) are picked up by the policefor a suspected crime and interrogated in separate cells without a chance tocommunicate with each other. For the purpose of this game, it makes nodifference whether or not you or Albert is guilty. You are both given thefollowing pieces of information.• If you both confess, you will both get four years in prison.• If neither of you confesses, the police will pin part of the crime on you, andyou’ll both get two years.• If one of you confesses but the other doesn’t, the confessor will make a dealwith the police and will go free while the other one goes to jail for fiveyears.The best strategy appears simple. No matter what Albert does, you are better offconfessing: you either go free or get four years. But Albert knows this too, soyou’d both end up getting four years. If you both “cooperate” (refuse toconfess), you would both be better off, getting only two years. The game is muchmore complicated than it first appears. If you play repeatedly, the goal is tofigure out Albert’s strategy and use it to minimize your own total jail time.Albert will be doing the same thing. The object of the game is not to hurtAlbert but rather to limit your own time of incarceration, either by exploitingAlbert’s kindness or through cooperation.Back to the study results. The most common outcome in games played by the womenwas mutual cooperation, even though players were maximally rewarded fordefecting when the other player cooperated. During the mutually cooperativesocial interactions on scans, activation was noted in the brain’s pleasurecenters, such as the nucleus accumbens and caudate nucleus. “Our study shows,for the first time, that social cooperation is intrinsically rewarding to thehuman brain, even in the face of pressures to the contrary,” said Dr. Berns,author of Satisfaction: Sensation Seeking, Novelty, and the Science of FindingTrue Fulfillment. “It suggests that the altruistic drive to cooperate isbiologically embedded—either genetically programmed or acquired throughsocialization during childhood and adolescence.”“Reciprocal altruism activates a reward circuit, and this activation may oftenbe sufficiently reinforcing to override subsequent temptations to accept but notreciprocate altruism. This may be what motivates us to persist with cooperativesocial interactions and reap the benefits of sustained mutual cooperation,” saidDr. Rilling.On the surface, the researchers argue that cooperation and altruism is a goodthing, an adaptive social skill. I agree that it certainly can be. But it canalso be a terrible thing and cause you to lose yourself if you cooperate so muchthat you have no idea what your own thoughts are. Cooperation, according to thisstudy, works in the same areas of the brain implicated in addictions. It is soimportant for some of us to be cooperative that we allow our husbands or wivesto control us, belittle us, sometimes abuse us; we allow our children to getaway with bad behavior, because we want them to like us; we stay in jobs thatare not a good fit for us, because we “just want to get along” we ignoreunderperforming employees because we do not want to confront them. Whencooperation gets out of hand, it is similar to an addiction. It generatesanxiety and such thoughts as “Please love me, no matter what” “Don’t be mad atme” “I’ll do anything to get you back” and “I’ll do anything to get along.”The anxiety becomes too intense to deal with the problems, so you go along toget along. The anxiety can prevent you from speaking your mind or even thinkingyour own thoughts. It is part of the reason that rigid religions and cultsflourish.In another fascinating study, Dr. Rilling and colleagues explored the impact ofthe neurotransmitter serotonin on cooperation. As mentioned earlier, serotoninis involved with mood control and cognitive flexibility. It helps you shiftattention easily, be more flexible, and let go of hurts. Again, using thePrisoner’s Dilemma game, healthy participants were randomly assigned to twogroups. One group was given a drink that contained tryptophan, the amino acidprecursor molecule for serotonin, while the other group’s drink did not containany tryptophan. The group whose drink contained no tryptophan had significantlylower levels of cooperation when playing the game, even in light of theirpreviously cooperative behavior. The researchers concluded that serotonin isimportant to social interactions. “These results suggest that serotonin plays asignificant role in the acquisition of socially cooperative behavior.”Psychiatrists who prescribe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, whichincrease serotonin availability in the brain, often see an increase incooperation and a decrease in contrary or socially negative behavior. I wonder,however, if medications like Lexapro, Zoloft, and Prozac do not also decreaseindependent thought and creativity. It seems to me that we need a balancebetween enough serotonin so that we feel good and can be flexible andcooperative, without going overboard and losing our identity to the will of thegroup. You need some angst to know when things are not right. That is what Iexperienced when I saw the chief resident abusing Beth in the story at thebeginning of this chapter. If I had been on Prozac, I very well may have thoughtto myself, “That is an interesting interaction. I hope they work it out. Where’sbreakfast?”How You Lose Your Maverick VoiceOvercontrol, dependence, anxiety, and stress also inhibit independent thinking.Parents, teachers, or managers who overcontrol or demand “blind” complianceoften work against themselves. Whenever you demand sameness or blind compliance,you lock the independent minds away and do not hear what they are thinking. Youlimit your own growth. When other people demand that you think the way they do,your mind no longer has to work, and if you are lazy you simply comply. Or youmay get mad and start pushing against them, actively sabotage them, or walkaway. The Gallup Organization estimated that “actively disengaged” workers arecosting U.S. businesses three hundred billion dollars a year in productivitylosses. According to their research, 17 percent or 22.5 million employees areactively disengaged. Gallup defined “actively disengaged” as employees who arenot just unhappy in their work but who are sabotaging their businesses. Each oneof these angry and alienated workers is costing their employers roughly thirteenthousand dollars in yearly productivity losses on average. There is more badnews. A majority of workers (54 percent) falls into the “not engaged” category.Not engaged workers are defined as “checked out,” putting time but not energy orpassion into their work. Look around your own workplace. According to thisresearch, every other person you see is on autopilot. Only 29 percent of workersare estimated by Gallup to be truly “engaged”—employees who “work with passionand who feel a profound connection to their company.” With so many peoplechecked out, you dramatically decrease the amount of independent thinkershelping to bring your business to the next level.Overcontrol, dependence, and anxiety is a common dynamic ruining our familiesand inhibiting the individual member’s independent thinking and creativity. Adamand Lindsay were in their late twenties when they came to see me. Theirrelationship was ending. They had been together for twelve years when theirmarriage fell apart. They met in high school. Lindsay grew up in a severelyabusive alcoholic home. She clung to Adam to get away from her nonstop stressfulfamily. Adam’s family was much more stable, although he struggled forindependence from his parents. Lindsay’s relationship with Adam was so importantto her that she would do anything to keep it, even let him think for her. Adam,by nature, had a controlling personality. He was a cingulate kid, oppositionaland stubborn. He always wanted his way. He wanted Lindsay to agree with him onevery issue. Early in the relationship she agreed with him about everything sothat he would stay with her. As Lindsay moved into her midtwenties, she becameweary of the control and started to disagree with Adam. She was going throughher own adolescent rebellious stage, just ten years later than most people andwith her husband, not her parents. Adam feared losing the reins of therelationship and became even more controlling, keeping her up frequently untilthree or four in the morning, trying to get her to see his point of view. Overtime, Lindsay grew up and had her own thoughts. She was done with Adam’sone-sided behavior and left him. He was devastated. He didn’t understand whythings changed. Adam’s family had warned him this would happen, telling him tolighten up on Lindsay and act more like a partner than a controlling father. Hedidn’t listen. For Lindsay’s part, she had basically taught Adam it was okay totreat her in a negative way, by staying with him and never speaking up forherself, until behaviors were entrenched. Through therapy they understood theirtendencies and were able to reconcile by building a more reciprocal relationshipand better communication skills.Strategies to Find Your Maverick VoiceFinding your maverick voice is not easy. It requires some discontentment withthe status quo and then the bravery to do something about it in an effectiveway. Here are five ideas to help you find your voice.First, keep your brain healthy. Effective behavior, assertiveness, clearcommunication, passion, and creative thinking are all brain functions. A healthybrain leads the way to a productive life.Second, work to be happy, but also value the tough times. Mavericks are aboutchange, and change requires some impetus, often pain, to go forward. Fewepiphanies occur during the good times. It is often turbulence that drives newideas and gives people the emotional drive to put the energy into change,something in your life that disturbs you enough that you consciously work tochange it, as in Lindsay’s case above. For example, a job crisis may precipitateassertiveness at work; marital affairs often lead to counseling, where partnersfind their voice (I have seen this happen many times); and a health crisis maylead to a complete evaluation of priorities. Welcome the uncomfortable momentsin your life and stop trying to immediately medicate them with alcohol, shoppingtrips, video games, or pornography. The tough times may be the seeds of yourmaverick voice.Third, have hope. If you have lost your voice, know that it is possible to findit. You are not a grasshopper. If you place a grasshopper in a jar with a lid,you can learn a powerful lesson. A grasshopper in this kind of captivity behavesas many people do throughout their lives. At first, the imprisoned grasshoppertries desperately to escape from the jar, using its powerful hind legs to launchits body up against the lid. It tries and tries, and then it tries again.Initially, it is very persistent. It may try to get out of its trap for severalhours. When it finally stops, however, its trying days are over. It will neveragain try to escape from the jar by jumping. You can take the lid off the jarand have a pet grasshopper for life. Once it believes that it cannot change itssituation, that’s it. It stops trying. It is easy to see the parallel betweengrasshoppers and people who lose their voice. Once people believe they aredefeated, that they cannot do things to change their situation, they stop tryingand give up, never to try again. Even if the lid is removed from their traps, itdoesn’t occur to them to leave; even if success or happiness is within theirgrasp, they are unable to reach out and grab it. You are not a grasshopper. Lookfor areas of your life where you have lost your voice and ask yourself what youneed to do to get it back. When you change the inside, often the outside is notfar behind. Your brain, as we have seen, makes happen what it sees.Fourth, practice independence and personal responsibility. When you disagreewith someone, tell him, but do it in a smart way, being firm and polite. Take achance to see if you can get a dopamine boost by being independent. Find andpractice expressing your own thoughts. As you speak your mind, do iteffectively. Mavericks are effective communicators. I often say to my patients,“There are ways to say things and there are ways to say things.”Jenny came to see me feeling powerless in her relationship with her air forcecolonel husband. Even though she would scream at him, she had lost her voice. Iasked her to describe her concerns.“He never listens to me,” she complained.“What do you mean?” I said.“He comes home and hides behind the newspaper. He doesn’t talk to me.”“How do you try to communicate with him?” I asked.With emotion she said, “I get in his face and yell at him that I want a divorceand wish I never married him.”Surprised by her comments, I chuckled.She gave me a hostile look. “You think that is funny?”“No,” I said, “just not very effective. How would you feel if someone talkedlike that to you? I would be scared.”At first Jenny was defensive, telling me about all the ways he had hurt her overthe years, but over time she learned better communication skills. Several weeksafter I started to see her she went home determined to be more effective incommunicating with her husband. He was sitting in his chair reading the paperwhen she started. “I missed you today. When would you have time tonight to talkwith me?” Surprised, her husband looked up from his paper and said, “Anytime youwant, sweetheart. Am I in trouble?” In that moment, Jenny realized how much herown behavior had contributed to the demise of the relationship, and if that wastrue, she could help make it better. She had more voice than she gave herselfcredit for. It is very hard for others to hear you when you yell.Fifth, strive to hone your creative skills. See options and alternatives.Mavericks see a need that is not being addressed, then think of a novel way todeal with it. They think outside the box of standard answers. But how do you getoutside the box? How do you think creatively? According to Robert Franken in hisbook Human Motivation, creativity is defined as the tendency to generate orrecognize ideas, alternatives, or possibilities that may be useful in solvingproblems, communicating with others, and entertaining ourselves and others.Creativity is seeing common things in an uncommon way. Among other things, youneed to be able to generate new possibilities or new alternatives. Realize thatthere are many ways to solve problems, and when you open your mind, newsolutions may come. Tests of creativity measure not only the number ofalternatives that people can generate but the uniqueness of those alternatives.The ability to generate alternatives or to see things uniquely does not occur bychance; it is linked to other, more fundamental qualities of thinking, such asflexibility, tolerance of ambiguity or unpredictability, and the enjoyment ofthings not previously known, an innate curiosity.In his book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,one of the world’s leading researchers on positive psychology, outlined histheory that people are most happy and creative when they are in a state offlow—a state of concentration or complete absorption with the activity at handand the situation. This dovetails nicely with Eckhart Tolle’s healing workdiscussed in The Power of Now. The idea of flow is identical to the feeling ofbeing “in the zone” or “in the groove.” The flow state is an optimal state ofintrinsic motivation, whereby the person is fully immersed in what he or she isdoing. The moment matters. He is not in the past with regret or the future withfear. He is in the now. This is a sensation everyone has at times, characterizedby a feeling of great freedom, enjoyment, fulfillment, and skill. Temporalconcerns (time, food, ego/self, etc.) are typically ignored. In an interviewwith Wired magazine, Csikszentmihalyi described flow as “being completelyinvolved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Everyaction, movement and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, likeplaying jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you’re using your skills to theutmost.” To achieve a flow state, a balance must be struck between the challengeof the task and the skill of the performer. If the task is too easy or toodifficult, flow cannot occur. The flow state also implies a kind of focusedattention, and indeed, it has been noted that mindfulness meditation, yoga, andmartial arts seem to improve a person’s capacity for flow. Among other benefits,all of these activities train and improve attention. In short, flow could bedescribed as a state in which attention, motivation, and the situation meet,resulting in a kind of productive harmony or feedback.Here’s an example of creative problem solving and maverick thinking. David andCelia met online. They had many things in common. They were both in the teachingprofession, loved to grow spiritually, had similar habits, and were attracted toeach other. They fell in love. Celia was at the tail end of a difficult divorce.Even though she cared deeply for David, her heightened anxiety and persistentstress caused deep ambivalence in her new relationship and she decided to take abreak after six months. Initially, the break was very hard for David. He missedCelia and felt they were a good match. David’s family gave him a lot of grief.If Celia went away, he should let her go and move on. There were plenty of fishin the sea. She was not good enough for him. Celia continued to keep in contactwith David and considered coming back. Her prior husband, like her father, was avery controlling man, and anything that resembled control sent Celia running.David was patient and wanted to find a way to keep Celia in his life, even ifthey did not end up as partners. One afternoon, as they discussed theirrelationship over lunch, as Celia continued to express her ambivalence, Davidpulled out five cards and gave them to her one at a time. He said they had manyoptions; there was no pressure.He gave her the first card. On the outside it had a picture of a couple in aloving embrace. On the inside, in David’s handwriting it read, “Option numberone: We are exclusive partners who live together. If you must, you can force meinto it.”He could see the card made Celia nervous, so he handed her the second card. Ithad a picture of a couple walking together. It read, “Option number two: We arepartners who live separately, who see each other several times a week (this ismy first choice).”Celia smiled. He handed her the third card. It had a picture of a dog and a catcuddled up next to each other. It read, “Option number three: We are friendswith benefits, who see each other on a somewhat regular basis but who also dateothers, sort of a break, with moments of closeness and passion.”Celia laughed and gave him a naughty look. He then handed her the fourth card.It had a picture of friends talking at the beach. It read, “Option number four:We are just friends and break any romantic ties for the foreseeable future.”Celia looked sad. He handed her the last card. It was a sympathy card. It read,“I am sorry for your loss. Option number five: We are ex-lovers, ex-friends,ships that docked for a while together, break up completely, and go out of eachother’s lives forever.”Touched, Celia said, “No way.”Within a week, they were back together, and a year later they were married. IfDavid had taken the path of ultimatum—“Either you’re my girlfriend or not”—hewould have lost his best friend and future wife. There are many ways to solveproblems. To be a maverick you must take a different approach from the standardone, even if it means doing what is difficult."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_048_r1.jpg]Create Lasting Trustimage [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]SEND THE SIGNALS THAT BUILD INTEGRITYHonesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.—THOMAS JEFFERSONNo man has a good enough memory to make a successful liar.—ABRAHAM LINCOLNMicca worked very hard. She often put in sixty-to eighty-hour work-weeks as theclinic manager at a new health care start-up company, and on the surface sheappeared to be a team player. Over time, however, her frequent conflicts withthe employees she supervised caused concern among the owners. When they calledin an outside consultant it was discovered that she was, in fact, not followingthe company’s policies and procedures and she lied about her compliance. Withher history of hard work, the owners gave her another chance. But in their mindsshe had become associated with being unreliable and less than honest. All of herbehaviors were filtered through these negative assumptions, and the smallestthings, including how she ordered office supplies, came into question. It wasnot a good situation and the constant stress led to Micca taking time off fromthe company owing to depression and anxiety.I saw Micca when she first went out on stress leave. She had virtually noinsight into her own contribution to the problems she faced. She believed shewas a victim of unfair management practices. Her brain scan indicated very lowprefrontal cortex activity. The prefrontal cortex, the brain’s supervisor, isalso involved in our sense of self and affects our ability to read our ownbehavior. Having low prefrontal cortex activity was consistent with herconflict-seeking nature, her impulsive inability to follow directions from theowners, and her lying, despite working long hours and truly wanting to besuccessful at her job. Through therapy, supplements, and medication I was ableto balance her prefrontal cortex, and when she returned to work her behavior wasmuch more consistent. Four years later she remains with the company and has beenpromoted twice. Over time, with consistent behavior, the trust with the companyowners was restored. Balancing her brain changed her life.Ultimately, trust and integrity are brain functions. These criticalcharacteristics of success stem from honesty and consistent behavior, which arealso brain functions. How you behave day to day makes a lasting impression orlegacy in the brains of other people. If you behave in a consistent, honest,predictable way, people will tend to trust you. When you behave erratically oryou lie, people tend not to trust you, and their brains remember you asuntrustworthy. The brain actually develops nerve cell networks tagged with thenames of the people in your life who become connected with descriptors such ashonest, lying, lifesaving, trustworthy, hardworking, lazy, dependable,unreliable, and so on. To be successful in any area of life, we need otherpeople, and it is best when they have us labeled in their brains as trustworthyand dependable.How the Brain Builds TrustDeveloping trust involves the brains of both the sender and the receiver.Sending consistent, honest, reliable messages is the first part of the equationof trust. As important is the ability to receive messages in a consistent,honest, and reliable way, without filters that distort incoming information. Tosend and receive trustworthy signals that build integrity, a person’s brainneeds to work right. Let’s revisit five of the six brain systems we havepreviously discussed and see how they can impact trustworthy and dependablebehavior. For the sender and receiver to transmit and receive trustworthymessages that breed integrity each of these systems need to be healthy. Aproblem in any one of them can short-circuit trust. Let’s look at each of thesesystems in more detail to see how they build and erode trust.PREFRONTAL CORTEX—CEOI think of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as the major system that breeds trust,honesty, and integrity. When the PFC works right, people tend to be thoughtful,truthful, and goal oriented. They can effectively supervise their words anddeeds. They are able to think before they say things and tend to do things thateffect their goals in a positive way. A healthy PFC helps inhibit behavior andfirst impulses. All of us, at one point or another, have hurtful thoughts crossour mind about our partner (e.g., “He looks like he is gaining a little weight”or “She has a few more wrinkles”) that are not helpful to just blurt out.Inhibiting these thoughts so they don’t just escape your mouth helps therelationship stay on an even track. People with a healthy PFC also tend to learnfrom their mistakes and follow through on commitments. They are generally ableto express their feelings and have good communication. And they tend to dislikeconflict, tension, and turmoil. Healthy PFC activity is associated withconsistent, thoughtful behavior.When there are problems in the PFC people tend to be impulsive, often causingserious erosion of trust in relationships. They tend to live in the moment andhave trouble delaying gratification. This “I want it now” mind-set is adangerous breeding ground for affairs, lying, and stealing. They also havetrouble listening and tend to be easily distracted, so there is oftenmiscommunication. In addition, many people with PFC problems have an unconscioustendency to be conflict seeking or to look for problems when none exist. I callthis tendency the game of “let’s have a problem.” This behavior pushes peopleaway and leaves them off balance in a relationship they cannot trust. PFCproblems cause inconsistent, unreliable, and often dishonest behavior thatbreeds mistrust.ANTERIOR CINGULATE GYRUS—GEAR SHIFTERThe anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) is the brain’s gear shifter. It is involvedwith shifting attention from task to task or idea to idea. It helps people beflexible, so they can go with the flow, and it is also involved in cooperationand helps people get outside of themselves. In addition, it is the part of thebrain that helps with error detection. For example, if you walk in a room andsomething is out of place, this is the part of the brain that notifies you aboutit.People with high activity in the ACG, usually owing to lower levels of theneurotransmitter serotonin, have a high sense of fairness and right and wrong.They can be very loyal and want to do things perfectly. They do not tend to liebut can be fairly rigid in their beliefs. Over time, however, too much activityin this system can erode trust because it can cause people to get stuck onnegative thoughts, behaviors, and old hurts. If you hurt them, they may neverforget it and punish you for years with their grudge holding. They may nag theirpartners about events from the past, and they may get stuck in their ownposition and become rigid, oppositional, or argumentative. In addition, they maybecome micromanagers at home or work, which pushes others away. They often geteasily upset when things do not go their way, so on the surface they appearselfish. Sometimes they are viewed by their spouses or employees as controlling,because things have to be their way.DEEP LIMBIC SYSTEM—MOOD AND BONDINGThe deep limbic system (DLS) sets a person’s emotional tone. When the DLS isless active, there is generally a positive, more hopeful state of mind. When itis heated up, or overactive, negativity and depression can take over. Because ofthis emotional shading, the DLS provides the filter through which you interpretthe events of the day; it tags or colors events, depending on the emotionalstate of mind. Trust is intimately involved in how we interpret what happens tous. All events have multiple possible interpretations. For example, if yourspouse has an affair, you can totally blame her for the indiscretion and filefor divorce, or you can ask yourself if your behavior contributed to the problemand seek solutions. How your limbic brain works will help determine how youinterpret what happens to you. If it is set to negative, you will have a hardtime trusting anyone. If it is set to positive you may trust people youshouldn’t. As in all brain systems, balance is needed.BASAL GANGLIA—ANXIETY AND MOTIVATIONWhen the basal ganglia (BG) system functions properly people tend to be calm,relaxed, and more trusting. They tend to predict the best and, in general, see apositive future. Trust is easier for them. They are able to deal with conflictin an effective way, which breeds trust and honesty. They can speak the truth.Overactivity in the BG results in a tendency toward anxiety, fear, insecurity,and placating others. They tend to focus on the negative and what can go wrongin a situation. They filter information through fear and they are less likely togive others the benefit of the doubt. Most of their memories are filled withanxiety or fear. They tend to wear out people by the constant fear they project.People with high BG activity have trouble trusting but can also appear clingyand insecure. When the BG work too hard, people tend to struggle with conflictavoidant behavior. Anything that reminds them of a worry (such as confronting anemployee who is not doing a good job) produces anxiety, and high BG people tendto avoid it because it makes them feel uncomfortable.TEMPORAL LOBES—PERCEPTION AND MEMORYThe temporal lobes (TLs) are involved with language (hearing and reading),reading social cues, getting memories into long-term storage, mood stability,and temper control. Problems in the temporal lobes can lead to miscommunication,misreading social cues, memory lapses, moodiness, and temper issues—all traitsthat erode trust. The TLs encode new information and facilitate memory. It isone of the areas first damaged by Alzheimer’s disease. Paranoia andsuspiciousness are common in Alzheimer’s disease and other TL disorders becausepeople do not process information fully.Strong emotions facilitate memory. One of the biggest trust builders is theability to navigate emotionally hard times successfully. Going through anillness, financial hardship, or work stress effectively allows another person toknow you will be there for him or her during the tough times, and positiveexperience builds long-term trust circuits in the brain. On the other hand,negative intense emotional experiences, such as growing up in an abusive home orbeing robbed or raped, often changes the function in the TLs and significantlyerodes a person’s ability to trust. Trust is based on accurate perception, andif the TLs do not perceive incoming information properly or if memory isdistorted, trust is likely to be lacking.Symphony of MistrustProblems in any one area of the brain can challenge trust, but when there aremultiple troubled areas trust becomes even harder. For example, it is notuncommon for patients to see me who have problems in two, three, four, or evenfive systems. They may be impulsive and unpredictable (low PFC activity), holdon to hurts from the past (high ACG activity), depressed and negative (high DLSactivity), anxious and insecure (high BG activity) and do not perceive orremember information accurately (low TL activity). Treating each of thesesystems is important to getting people well and boosting their ability to trust(see chapter 4 for a summary of problems and treatments for each of thesesystems).Oxytocin and the Chemistry of TrustInterestingly, certain chemicals, found everywhere in the brain, are alsoinvolved with trust, especially the bonding hormone oxytocin. In a landmarkstudy by Michael Kosfeld and colleagues from Switzerland, intranasal oxytocinwas found to increase trust. Men who inhaled a nasal spray spiked with oxytocingave more money to partners in a risky investment game than did men who sniffeda spray containing a placebo. Previous studies of animals had suggested thatoxytocin in the brain encourages long-term mating in pairs of adults andnurturing behaviors by mothers toward their offspring. Oxytocin fosters thetrust needed for friendship, love, families, economic transactions, andpolitical networks. According to the study’s authors, “Oxytocin specificallyaffects an individual’s willingness to accept social risks arising throughinterpersonal interactions.”The scientists studied oxytocin’s influence on male college students playing aninvestment game. Each of fifty-eight men was paid a sum of money to participatein the experiment. The volunteers were paired up, and one man in each pair wasrandomly assigned to play the role of an investor and the other to play the roleof a trustee. Each participant received tokens, valued with real money andredeemable at the end of the experiment. The investor in each pair decided howmany tokens to cede to the trustee. Both participants, sitting face to face,knew that the experimenters would quadruple that investment. The trustee thendetermined whether to keep the entire enhanced pot or to give some portion ofthe proceeds, whatever amount seemed fair, to the investor. Among the investorswho had inhaled oxytocin, about half gave all their tokens to trustees and mostof the rest contributed a majority of their tokens. In contrast, only one fifthof investors who had inhaled a placebo spray forked over all their tokens andanother one third parted with a majority of their tokens. The oxytocin influenceis “a remarkable finding,” says neuroscientist Antonio Damasio of the Universityof Iowa College of Medicine in Iowa City in an editorial published with theresearch report. Damasio had previously argued that the hormone acts somewhat asa love potion. “It adds trust to the mix, for there is no love without trust,”he says.Why Lie Detectors Do Not Work for the People Who Need Them MostOne of the reasons that traditional lie detectors do not work is that there is acertain percentage of the population that does not react emotionally when theylie, cheat, or steal. In a very real sense they are cold-blooded. They actuallyhave less blood flow to the most thoughtful part of their brain, the PFC.Lie detectors typically work by professionals observing how a person’sphysiology responds to lying. Most people exhibit physical symptoms when theylie. Their bodies respond to the stress they feel when they think they will befound out. Immediately, their hearts beat faster as adrenaline bathes theirsystem, their breathing becomes more shallow in response to feelings of panic,their hands become colder as blood flow becomes constricted, and their handssweat and their muscles become tense. Examiners can see this pattern on the liedetector equipment and the liar is caught. This technology works nicely for mostpeople. Most of us have brains that want to tell the truth, want to be trusted,and we feel guilty when we lie or when we think we will be caught. Our bodiesrespond to our thoughts and feelings. There is even new brain imaging liedetector equipment and companies springing up, such as No Lie MRI, to swear incourt whether or not you are telling the truth. Not only does your body react tolies, your brain does as well. Whenever most people lie, their brain becomesoverall much more active than when telling the truth. It really does take moreout of you to lie than to tell the truth.But the problem with lie detectors, including the latest brain imagingadditions, is that there is a certain percentage of people who do not respond inthe typical way to lying. Their brains and bodies do not respond with anxiety tothe lies they tell. It is just routine for them. These people often haveantisocial personality disorder, which is characterized by a long-standingpattern of disregard for the rights of others. They frequently break rules,inhabit prisons, and have constant relationship and work problems. They oftenget into fights. With little or no empathy, they may steal, destroy property, ormanipulate or deceive others for their own selfish ends. They tend to beimpulsive and lack forethought. Psychologist Adrienne Raine from the Universityof Southern California found that compared with a group of healthy men, themagnetic resonance imaging scans of the men with antisocial personality disordershowed decreased PFC volume. They are likely dealing with less access to thepart of the brain that controls conscience, free will, right and wrong, and goodand evil. A fascinating additional finding of Dr. Raine’s work was that peoplewith antisocial personality disorder also had slower heart rates than thecontrol group and decreased sweat gland activity. Lower heart rates and sweatgland activity are often associated with low anxiety states (your hands sweatand your heart races when you are anxious). Could this mean that people withthis type of temperament do not have enough internal anxiety? Could the PFC beinvolved with appropriate anxiety? Intriguing questions. For example, mostpeople feel anxious before they do something bad or risky. If I needed money andgot the thought in my head to rob the local grocery store, my next thoughtswould be filled with anxiety:“It is wrong,” “I am better than that action,” “I don’t want to get caught,” “Idon’t like institutional food,” and “I could lose my medical license” are just afew of the thoughts that might run through my head. The anxiety would prevent mefrom acting out on the bad thoughts. But what if, as Dr. Raine’s study suggests,I do not have enough anxiety and I get an evil thought in my head such as “Gorob the store”? With poor PFC activity, I am likely to rob the store withoutconsidering all of the consequences to my behavior. There is an interestingtreatment implication from this work. Typically, psychiatrists try to helplessen a person’s anxiety. Maybe we have it backward for people with antisocialpersonality disorder—perhaps we should try to increase their anxiety. Perhapsthat’s what spiritual leaders had in mind when they talk about hell, fire, anddamnation. There is a certain percentage of us who need to be scared intobehaving right, who need more anxiety, who need to know that there will be hellto pay for bad behavior.So Whom Should You Trust?The best predictor of behavior is behavior. How people have been acting is alikely indicator of how they will act, unless they do something meaningful tochange. That is why once people see you as dishonest, disingenuous, unreliable,or lacking integrity, their brain is wired to keep that label for you until itlearns otherwise. Our brains remember emotionally laden material, and when wesee someone important as untrustworthy, it is often a very emotional event. WhenPresident George H. W. Bush reversed his campaign promise of no new taxes—“Readmy lips, no new taxes”—many Americans felt betrayed, which was instrumental incosting him re election.Over time, once the brain develops a reason to trust someone, new informationcan replace old ideas, as in the case of Micca, who was discussed at thebeginning of the chapter. Adolescents are a great example of how the brain canlearn to trust again. Many teens struggle with consistent behavior, and losetheir parents’ trust. But over time, as their behavior becomes more consistent,usually when their PFC becomes more fully developed in their midtwenties,parents become more trusting. Over the years I have seen hundreds of teenagersstruggling for independence. They want their parents to trust them, yet theyconsistently exhibit untrustworthy behavior. As we discuss their plight, Iencourage them to articulate their goals, such as to be trusted and have moreindependence, and then act accordingly, despite the temptations of parties,easily available drugs, and friends who might lead them astray. Often thecounseling is effective, especially when I can balance their brains. Sometimesit just takes time. Of course, it is possible to repair a bad reputation.Consider Muhammad Ali, who was hated by many in the 1960s for his refusal tosign up for the draft. In 1996 he was one of the most beloved sports figures inthe world and carried the Olympic torch during the opening ceremonies of thegames in Atlanta.Let’s look deeper into applying this principle to your life. When interviewingpeople for a job position in your company, it is critical to know about theirpast jobs. Remember, the best predictor of current behavior is past behavior.You want to know what they excelled at, what, if anything, went wrong, and whatother people thought of them. Many people have blinders to their own weaknesses,so talking with others can provide essential information. Background checks area key component of good business. For example, if someone has had multiple jobsin a short period of time, likely they will only be with you for a short while.Sometimes our own excitement or needs cause us to override our PFC and makehasty decisions about who to invite into our businesses.Impulsive decisions can also adversely affect our personal lives. Taking time toget to know someone and meeting her family and friends before we hop into bedwith her is essential to protecting your heart, health, and wealth.Unfortunately, our society’s obsession with instant gratification causes manypeople to rush intimacy before really knowing the other person whose body andbrain they are getting into. Besides the obvious health issues, when you makelove to someone, the chemical oxytocin surges through our brains (500 percent inmen after an orgasm), causing us to be more trusting, perhaps undeservedly so. Icaution my patients to be careful and go slowly. Getting someone into your headmay be a lot easier than getting him or her out.Live for the Long Haul, Not Just the MomentThink about your long-term goals. It is easy to cheat in the moment, whether itis cheating on your spouse, your boss, or your taxes. But think about how yourbehavior fits with your goals over time. What kind of character do you desire?Matching your behavior to your goals is a PFC function.I once had lunch with a close friend who was having marital problems. I knewChuck had ADD and was struggling at home in his relationships with his wife andchildren. As usual, Chuck was telling me about the turmoil. His wife wasstruggling with one of their daughters who was being defiant. Then all of asudden his affect changed, his eyes brightened, and his tone became more excitedand hushed. He told me about a woman he had recently met on an airplane. She waspretty, smart, interesting, and seemed to really like him a lot. She had evencome to his office for a visit. As he started to go on, I interrupted him.“Chuck, do you like attorneys?”“What do you mean?” he said looking surprised.“Play it out,” I said. “You are having marital problems. You meet thisattractive woman who seems interested in you. She has been to your office. Thenext step, if it has not happened already, is for you to have sex with her. Thenyour wife will probably find out. You have ADD so you are not good at hidingthings. She has a hot cingulate so she will never forgive you. She will file fordivorce, you will spend a lot of money and time with attorneys, and hateyourself for putting your family through all this stuff, and then a year fromnow you will lose half of your net worth and you will be visiting your childrenon the weekends.”“Wow,” Chuck said, looking deflated. “I never thought about it like that.”“That is what your prefrontal cortex does for you,” I said. “It plays thingsout.”Chuck later told me that he never called the woman back.A lack of honesty and integrity breeds mistrust and has destroyed people’ssuccess through the ages. One of the most precious things each of us has is ourword. When we say something is true and we have integrity, people believe us.Without integrity, people always look at us and wonder.Integrity is being who you say you are.

Some people willneed psychotherapy, some will need medication, and others will need moredirected guidance with supplements or other alternative treatments. Thisappendix will help you decide if and when you should seek professional help. Inlecturing around the world, I am frequently asked the following questions: Whenis it time to see a professional about my brain? What should I do when a lovedone is in denial about needing help? How do I go about finding a competentprofessional? Here are some thoughts for you to consider.When Is It Time to See a Professional About My Brain?This question is relatively easy to answer. People should seek professional helpfor themselves or a family member when their behaviors, feelings, thoughts, ormemory (all brain functions) interfere with their ability to reach theirpotential in their relationships, work, or school. If you are experiencingpersistent relationship struggles (parent-child, sibling, friends, romantic),it’s time to get help. If you have ongoing school or work problems related toyour memory, moods, actions, or thoughts, it is time to get professional help.If your impulsive behavior, poor choices, or anxiety are causing consistentmonetary problems, it’s time to get help. Many people think they cannot affordto get professional help. I think it is usually much more costly to live withbrain problems than it is to get appropriate help.Pride and denial can get in the way of seeking proper help. People want to bestrong and rely on themselves, but I am constantly reminded of the strength ittakes to make the decision to get help. Also, getting help should be looked atas a way to get your brain operating at its full capacity.What Should I Do When a Loved One Is in Denial About Needing Help?Unfortunately, the stigma associated with a “psychiatric illness” prevents manypeople from getting help. People do not want to be seen as crazy, stupid, ordefective and do not seek help until they (or their loved one) can no longertolerate the pain (at work, in their relationships, or within themselves). Mostpeople do not see psychiatric problems as brain problems but rather as weakcharacter problems. Men are especially affected by denial.Here are several suggestions to help people who are unaware or willing to getthe help they need. Try the straightforward approach first (but with a new braintwist). Clearly tell the person what behaviors concern you, and explain to himthat the problems may be due to underlying brain patterns that can be easilytuned up. Tell him help may be available—help not to cure a defect but ratherhelp to optimize how his brain functions. Tell him you know he is trying to dohis best, but his behavior, thoughts, or feelings may be getting in the way ofhis success (at work, in relationships, or within themselves). Emphasize betterfunction, not defect.Give him information. Books, videos, and articles on the subjects you areconcerned about can be of tremendous help. Many people come to see us becausethey read a book or article or saw a video. Good information can be verypersuasive, especially if it is presented in a positive, life-enhancing way.When a person remains resistant to help, even after you have beenstraightforward and given him good information, plant seeds. Plant ideas aboutgetting help and then water them regularly. Drop an idea, article, or otherinformation about the topic from time to time. If you talk too much aboutgetting help, he might become resentful and won’t get help to spite you,especially if he’s the overfocused type. Be careful not to go overboard.Protect your relationship with the other person. People are more receptive topeople they trust than they are to people who nag and belittle them. Work ongaining the person’s trust over the long run. It will make him more receptive toyour suggestions. Do not make getting help the only thing that you talk about.Make sure you are interested in his whole life, not just his potential medicalappointments.Give him new hope. Many people with these problems have tried to get help and itdid not work or it even made them worse. Educate your loved one on new braintechnology that helps professionals be more focused and more effective intreatment efforts.There comes a time when you have to say enough is enough. If, over time, theother person refuses to get help, and his behavior has a negative impact on yourlife, you may have to separate yourself. Staying in a toxic relationship isharmful to your health, and it often enables the other person to remain sick aswell. Actually, I have seen that the threat or act of leaving motivates peopleto change, whether it is about drinking, drug use, or treating ADD. Threateningto leave is not the first approach I would take, but after time it may be thebest approach. Realize you cannot force a person into treatment unless he isdangerous to himself or others or is unable to care for himself. You can only dowhat you can do. Fortunately, there is a lot more we can do today than even tenyears ago.How Do I Go About Finding a Competent Professional?At the Amen Clinics we get many calls, faxes, and e-mails a week from people allover the world looking for competent professionals in their area who think insimilar ways to the principles outlined in this book. Because this approach ison the edge of what is new in brain science, other professionals who know andpractice this information may be hard to find. However, finding the rightprofessional for evaluation and treatment is critical to the healing process.The right professional can have a very positive impact on your life. The wrongprofessional can make things worse.There are a number of steps to take in finding the best person to assist you. Wemaintain a list of people I have trained and we are collegial with on ourwebsite at www.amenclinic.com [http://www.Amenclinic.com]. Get the best personyou can find. Saving money up front may cost you in the long run. The right helpis not only cost effective but saves unnecessary pain and suffering, so don’trely on a person simply because they are on your managed care plan. That personmay or may not be a good fit for you. Search for the best. If he or she is onyour insurance plan, great, but don’t let that be the primary criterion. Onceyou get the names of competent professionals, check their credentials. Very fewpatients ever check a professional’s background. Board certification is apositive credential. To become board certified, physicians must pass additionalwritten and verbal tests. They have had to discipline themselves to gain theskill and knowledge that was acceptable to their colleagues. Don’t give too muchweight to the medical school or graduate school the professional attended. Ihave worked with some doctors who went to Yale and Harvard who did not have aclue on how to appropriately treat patients, while other doctors from lessprestigious schools were outstanding, forward thinking, and caring. Set up aninterview with the professional to see whether or not you want to work with himor her. Generally you have to pay for their time, but it is worth spending themoney to get to know the people you will rely on for help.Many professionals write articles or books or speak at meetings or local groups.Read the work of or hear the professional speak if possible. By doing so you maybe able to get a feel for the kind of person they are and their ability to helpyou. Look for a person who is open-minded, up-to-date, and willing to try newthings. Look for a person who treats you with respect, who listens to yourquestions and responds to your needs. Look for a relationship that iscollaborative and respectful. I know it is hard to find a professional who meetsall of these criteria who also has the right training in brain physiology, butthese people can be found. Be persistent. The caregiver is essential to healing."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_050_r1.jpg]Why SPECT?image [images/Amen_9780307451736_epub_004_r1.jpg]WHAT BRAIN SPECT IMAGING CAN TELL CLINICIANS AND PATIENTSIf we agree that mental disorders and difficult behaviors may be related tofunctional problems in the brain, then a logical next step is to considerphysically evaluating the brain itself when faced with people who struggle withcomplex problems or who are unresponsive to our best diagnostic and treatmentefforts. Why are psychiatrists the only physicians who rarely look at the organthey treat?1It is time to change. Amen Clinics, Inc. (ACI) has provided leadership andunderstanding on the clinical use of brain imaging in psychiatry. Over the pasteighteen years, ACI has built the world’s largest database of brain scansrelated to emotional, learning, and behavioral problems. The study we do iscalled brain SPECT imaging. SPECT stands for “single photon emission computedtomography.” It is a nuclear medicine procedure widely used in medicine to studyheart, liver, thyroid, bone, and brain problems. Brain SPECT imaging is a provensafe, reliable measure of cerebral blood flow. Because brain activity isdirectly related to blood flow, SPECT effectively shows us the patterns ofactivity in the brain.2 SPECT allows physicians to look deep inside the brain toobserve three things: areas of the brain that work well, areas of the brain thatwork too hard, and areas of the brain that do not work hard enough. ACI hasperformed over fifty thousand scans on patients from age ten months to 101 yearsand has scanned many normal, “healthy brain” individuals as well.The procedure guidelines of the Society of Nuclear Medicine lists the evaluationof suspected brain trauma, evaluation of patients with suspected dementia,presurgical location of seizures, and the detection and evaluation of cerebralvascular disease as common indications for brain SPECT.3 The guidelines also saythat many additional indications appear promising. At ACI, because of ourexperience, we have added the indications of evaluating violence, substanceabuse, the subtypes of ADD, anxiety and depression, complex or resistantpsychiatric problems, and general health screening for brain SPECT.An important question for today’s mental health clinicians is “When and whywould I order a SPECT study for my patients or get one for myself or loved one?”My purpose in this appendix is to answer this question and to point out some ofthe benefits and caveats for using this powerful tool.Benefits of SPECT Brain ImagingA SPECT scan can provide distinct benefits to clinicians and to the patient andthe patient’s family. There are also some things that should not be expectedfrom a SPECT scan.BENEFITS FOR PHYSICIANS AND CLINICIANS1. A SPECT scan can show:a. Areas of the brain implicated in specific problems, such as the prefrontalcortex with executive function and the medial temporal lobes with long-termmemory storageb. Unexpected findings that may be contributing to the presenting problem(s),such as toxicity, potential areas of seizure activity, or past brain traumac. Potential seizure activity, in many cases more accurately seen by SPECT thanstandard electroencephalograms (EEGs), especially in the areas of the medialtemporal lobe. There are over forty-one studies with more than thirteen hundredpatients on SPECT and epilepsy (see www.amenclinic.com[http://www.Amenclinic.com] for references).d. Targeted areas for treatment, such as overactive basal ganglia or anteriorcingulate gyrus (seen on anxiety and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders) oran underactive temporal lobe (seen in seizure disorders and trauma)e. Specific effects of medication on the brain to help guide us in adjustingdosages or augmenting treatment. Often patients report that selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are helpful but also cause decreased motivation ormemory problems, seen as decreased prefrontal or temporal lobe activity onSPECT.f. Changes in brain function with treatment, improved or worsened. You canreview many before-and-after scans at www.amenclinic.com[http://www.Amenclinic.com].2. The image occurs at the time of injection and outside the imaging camera,which gives SPECT several significant advantages. Most notably, we are able tosedate people after they have been injected so that they can lie still for thescan, often difficult for hyperactive or autistic children or demented adults(motion artifact ruins the scan in all of these imaging techniques).3. A SPECT scan can provide explanations for refractory symptoms and helpclinicians ask better and more targeted questions (e.g., about toxic exposure,brain injuries, anoxia, inflammation, or infections that patients may havedenied or forgotten).4. A SPECT scan can help us avoid prescribing treatments that make the problemworse, such as unnecessarily stimulating an already overactive brain or calmingan underactive one.5. A SPECT scan can help evaluate risk for dementia. The brain starts to changelong before people show symptoms. There is usually a loss of 30 percent ofhippocampal tissue before symptoms occur. Using autopsy data in fifty-fourpatients, Bonte reported that brain SPECT had a positive predictive value forAlzheimer’s disease of 92 percent.46. A SPECT scan can also help differentiate among types of dementia. Early inthe disease, Alzheimer’s disease, frontal temporal lobe dementia, Lewy bodydementia, and multi-infarct dementia each have their own patterns. There areover eighty-three studies with more than forty-five hundred patients on thissubject (see www.amenclinic.com [http://www.Amenclinic.com] for references).7. A SPECT scan helps clinicians understand the rationale for using certainmedications (such as anticonvulsants to stabilize temporal lobe function or calmfocal areas of marked hyperactivity; stimulants to enhance decreased prefrontalperfusion; or SSRIs to calm basal ganglia and anterior cingulate hyperactivity).8. A SPECT scan can identify specific areas of the brain affected by trauma;better target treatment; and help deal with insurance, legal, and rehabilitationissues. There are over seventy-two studies with more than seventeen hundredpatients on brain trauma (see www.amenclinic.com [http://www.Amenclinic.com] forreferences).9. A SPECT scan can often identify factors contributing to relapse in peoplerecovering from substance abuse, eating disorders, or sexual addictions. Forexample, the patient may have suffered an injury to the prefrontal cortex ortemporal lobes or have overactivity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, basalganglia, limbic system, or prefrontal cortex, each of which could indicatecomorbid disorders requiring treatment.10. A SPECT scan can often identify a specific cause that contributes torecovering alcoholics’, drug addicts’, sexual addicts’, or eating-disorderedpeople’s relapse behavior. For example, the patient may have suffered an injuryin the prefrontal cortex or temporal lobes or have overactivity in the anteriorcingulate gyrus, basal ganglia, limbic system, or prefrontal cortex, each ofwhich could contribute to the relapsing behaviors.11. A SPECT scan is also useful to determine if further adjustment of medicationis needed. Scans of patients on medication will reveal areas of the brain stilloveractive or underactive.BENEFITS FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES1. A SPECT scan helps develop a deeper understanding of the problem, resultingin reduced shame, guilt, stigma, and self-loathing. This can promoteself-forgiveness, often the first step in healing. Patients can see that theirproblems are, at least in part, medical and physical.2. A SPECT scan allows patients to see a physical representation of theirproblems that is accurate and reliable and helps to increase compliance.Pictures are powerful and can influence a patient’s willingness and ability toaccept and adhere to the treatment program. She can then better understand thatnot taking medication for anxiety, depression, rage, ADD, and so on is similarto not wearing corrective prescription glasses.3. A SPECT scan helps families understand when permanent brain damage from aninjury will not get better, so they can better accept the condition and provideaccordingly.4. A SPECT scan shows substance abusers the damage they have done to their ownbrain, thus helping to decrease denial, provide motivation for treatment, andsupport perseverance in sobriety.5. A SPECT scan shows patients how treatments have impacted (improved orworsened) brain function.6. A SPECT scan helps motivate abusive spouses to follow medication protocols byshowing that there is a physical abnormality contributing to their problems.7. A SPECT scan is useful for cancer patients suffering with a “chemotherapytoxic brain.” It gives them insight into their cognitive struggles and alsohelps their doctors see the neurophysiologic and emotional effects of havingcancer and its treatment.8. A SPECT scan can help take modern psychopharmacology from mystery and unknownconsequences to reality and more predictable outcomes.9. A SPECT scan allows patients to understand why specific treatments areindicated, which medications are likely to be most helpful, and what otherinterventions may be indicated.What a SPECT Scan Cannot ProvideDespite the many benefits that might be derived from a SPECT scan, there areclearly some things that it cannot provide.1. SPECT scans cannot give a diagnosis in the absence of clinical information.2. SPECT scans cannot give the date of a head injury, infection, or toxicexposure.3. SPECT scans cannot assess or evaluate IQ.4. SPECT scans cannot assess or evaluate the guilt, innocence, motivation, orsanity of a criminal defendant.5. SPECT scans cannot guarantee a perfect diagnosis, or a cure.How SPECT Scans Differ from Magnetic Resonance Imaging ScansA SPECT scan is similar to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in that bothcan show three-dimensional images and “slices” of the brain. However, whereasMRI shows the physical anatomy of the brain, SPECT shows brain functionalactivity. That is, SPECT yields images showing where the brain is functioningwell, where it is working too hard, and where it is not working hard enough. Anewer version of MRI, functional MRI or “fMRI,” is also capable of showing brainactivity and is used extensively in scientific research on brain function. AnfMRI shows instantaneous neural activity so you can see, for example, how thebrain responds to a specific stimulus event. With SPECT we see brain activityaveraged over a few minutes so it is better at showing the brain doing everydayactivities such as concentrating, meditating, reading, and so on. Positronemission tomography, another nuclear imaging technique, is very similar to SPECTbut is much more costly.Ensuring High-Quality SPECT ImagesAlthough a SPECT scan is simple from the patient’s perspective, it takesconsiderable skill and experience to dependably generate accurate brain SPECTimages suitable for psychiatric applications. Equally important is the need fortotal consistency in imaging techniques among patients so that results arequantifiable, repeatable, and consistent. The following factors need to beconsidered in SPECT scans.VARIABILITY OF TECHNIQUE ISSUESProcessing protocols need to be standardized and optimized. Motion can ruin ascan, so it is important that there be no motion on the scan. The physicianneeds to know how to identify and deal with image artifacts and othersophisticated technical issues.VARIABILITY OF CAMERASMultiheaded cameras are clearly superior as they can scan much faster. It takesan hour to do a scan with a single-headed camera, thirty minutes on adual-headed camera, and fifteen minutes on a triple-headed camera.EXPERIENCE OF READERSAt the Amen Clinics, we have developed a standardized reading technique forwhich we have documented high interrater and intrarater reliability.IMAGE DISPLAYScans must be clear, understandable, easily illustrative of brain function, andavailable to the patient on a timely basis. We believe our three-dimensionalrendering software makes the scans easy for professionals, patients, andfamilies to understand.DRUGSScans can be affected by a number of substances that need to be controlled for,such as medications, street drugs, and caffeine. All of the above issues have been addressed at the Amen Clinics by carefullystandardized procedures for all our SPECT scans.Common ConcernsConcern: Low resolution—it is commonly said that a SPECT scan is a “poor man’sPET study.”Response: With multiheaded cameras, SPECT scans have the same resolution as PETscans with considerably lower cost, better insurance coverage, greateravailability, and fewer image artifacts.5 Also, it is an easier procedure to do.SPECT provides more than adequate resolution for our applications. Concern: Radiation exposure, especially in childrenResponse: The average radiation exposure for one SPECT scan is 0.7 rem (similarto a nuclear bone scan or computerized axial tomography scan) and is a safeprocedure, according to the guidelines established by the American Academy ofNeurology.6 These other procedures are routinely ordered for many common medicalconditions (e.g., bone fractures or head trauma), further suggesting that thelevels of radiation exposure are generally acceptable in medical practice.Ineffective treatment of psychiatric illness has many more risks than the lowlevels of radiation associated with a SPECT scan. Concern: What is considered normal?Response: In the SPECT literature over the past twenty years, there have beenmore than forty-three studies looking at “normal” issues in over 2,450 patients,including 150 children from birth on (see www.amenclinic.com[http://www.Amenclinic.com] for references). These do not include the thousandsof control subjects used in studies of specific neurological and psychiatricconditions. Chiron and colleagues reported that at birth, cortical regionalcerebral blood flow (rCBF) was lower than those for adults.7 After birth, itincreased by five or six years of age to values 50–85 percent higher than thosefor adults, thereafter decreasing to reach adult levels between fifteen andnineteen years. At the age of three, however, children had the same relativeblood flow patterns as adults. Other common findings in normal studies suggestthat women have generally higher perfusion than men and that age, drug abuse,and smoking have a negative effect on rCBF. Concern: Some physicians say, “I don’t need a scan for diagnosis; I can tellclinically.”Response: Often, well-trained physicians can make clinical determinations. But aSPECT scan is ordered when the physician is confused, the patient hasn’tresponded to the doctor’s best treatment, or the patient’s situation isotherwise complicated. Concern: Lack of reproducibilityResponse: An article by Villanueva-Meyer and colleagues elegantly answers thisquestion, showing that there is less than 3 percent variability in SPECT scansover time for the same activity.8 Our own clinical experience, scanning peoplesequentially, and sometimes twelve years apart, finds that SPECT patterns remainthe same unless you do something to change the brain. A SPECT scan is areproducible and reliable method for sequential evaluation.ConclusionAt the Amen Clinics we feel that our experience with more than thirty-fivethousand brain SPECT scans over sixteen years guides us in being the best in theworld for brain SPECT imaging.COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT BRAIN SPECT IMAGINGHere are several common questions and answers about brain SPECT imaging. Willthe SPECT study give me an accurate diagnosis? No. A SPECT study by itself willnot give a diagnosis. SPECT studies help the clinician understand more about thespecific function of your brain. Each person’s brain is unique, requiring uniqueresponses to medicine or therapy. Diagnoses about specific conditions are madethrough a combination of clinical history, personal interview, information fromfamilies, diagnostic checklists, SPECT studies, and other neuropsychologicaltests. No study is “a doctor in a box” that can give accurate diagnoses onindividual patients.Why are SPECT studies ordered? Some of the common reasons include:1. Evaluating memory problems, dementia, and distinguishing among differenttypes of dementia and pseudodementia (depression that looks like dementia)2. Evaluating seizure activity3. Evaluating blood vessel diseases, such as stroke4. Evaluating the effects of mild, moderate, and severe head trauma5. Suspicion of underlying organic brain condition, such as seizure activitycontributing to behavioral disturbance, prenatal trauma, or exposure to toxins6. Evaluating atypical or unresponsive aggressive behavior7. Determining extent of brain impairment caused by drug or alcohol abuse8. Typing anxiety, depression, and ADDs when clinical presentation is not clear9. Evaluating people who are atypical or resistant to treatment10. General health screeningDo I need to be off medication before the study? This question must be answeredindividually between you and your doctor. In general, it is better to be offmedications until they are out of your system, but this is not always practicalor advisable. If the study is done while on medication, let the technician knowso that when the physician reads the study he will include that information inthe interpretation of the scan. In general, we recommend patients try to be offstimulants at least four days before the first scan and remain off them untilafter the second scan, if one is ordered. It is generally not practical to stoptaking medications such as Prozac because they last in the body for four to sixweeks. Check with your doctor for specific recommendations.What should I do the day of the scan? On the day of the scan decrease oreliminate your caffeine intake and try to not take cold medication or aspirin(if you do, please write it down on the intake form). Eat as you normally would. Are there any side effects or risks to the study? The study does not involve adye and people do not have allergic reactions to the study. The possibilityexists, although in a very small percentage of patients, of a mild rash, facialredness and edema, fever, and a transient increase in blood pressure. The amountof radiation exposure from one brain SPECT study is approximately the same asone abdominal x-ray. How is the SPECT procedure done? The patient is placed in a quiet room and asmall intravenous (IV) line is started. The patient remains quiet forapproximately ten minutes with his or her eyes open to allow their mental stateto equilibrate to the environment. The imaging agent is then injected throughthe IV. After another short period of time, the patient lies on a table and theSPECT camera rotates around his or her head (the patient does not go into atube). The time on the table is approximately fifteen minutes. If aconcentration study is ordered, the patient returns on another day. Are there alternatives to having a SPECT study? In our opinion, SPECT is themost clinically useful study of brain function. There are other studies, such asEEGs, PET studies, and MRIs. PET studies and fMRI are considerably more costlyand they are performed mostly in research setting. EEGs, in our opinion, do notprovide enough information about the deep structures of the brain to be ashelpful as SPECT studies. Does insurance cover the cost of SPECT studies? Reimbursement by insurancecompanies varies according to your plan. It is often a good idea to check withthe insurance company ahead of time to see if it is a covered benefit. Is the use of brain SPECT imaging accepted in the medical community? Brain SPECTstudies are widely recognized as an effective tool for evaluating brain functionin seizures, strokes, dementia, and head trauma. There are literally hundreds ofresearch articles on these topics. In our clinic, based on our experience forover a decade, we have developed this technology further to evaluate aggressionand nonresponsive psychiatric conditions. Unfortunately, many physicians do notfully understand the application of SPECT imaging and may tell you that thetechnology is experimental, but over two thousand physicians and mental healthprofessionals in the United States have referred patients to us for scans.1.
