It is the single most common learning and behavioral problem inchildren. But the issue doesn’t end there: It is also one of the most commonproblems in adults, leading to job failures, relationship breakups, loneliness,drug abuse, and a tremendous sense of underachievement. Despite its prevalence,many myths and misconceptions about ADD abound in our society. Here are just afew of them:MYTHS * ADD is a flavor-of-the-month illness, a fad diagnosis. It’s just an excuse for bad behavior. * ADD is overdiagnosed. Every child that acts up a bit gets placed on Ritalin. * ADD is only a disorder of hyperactive boys. * ADD is only a minor problem. People make too much of a fuss over it. * ADD is an American invention, made up by a society seeking simple solutions to complex social problems. * Bad parents or bad teachers cause ADD. If only our society had old-fashioned values, there wouldn’t be these problems. * People with ADD should just try harder. Everybody gives them excuses and coddles them. * Everyone outgrows ADD by the age of 12 or 13. * Stimulant medication is dangerous and highly addictive. It’s just like speed. * Medication alone is the best treatment for ADD.FACTS * ADD has been described in the medical literature for about one hundred years. In 1902, pediatrician George Still described a group of children who were hyperactive, impulsive, and inattentive. Unfortunately, he didn’t understand that ADD is a medical disorder and labeled these children as “morally defective.” * ADD affects approximately 6 percent of the population, while less than 2 percent receive treatment. A recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that there was no evidence that ADD is overdiagnosed in our society, and child psychiatrist Peter Jensen from the National Institutes of Health found that less than one in eight children who met the diagnostic criteria for ADD were taking medication. * Many people with ADD are never hyperactive. The nonhyperactive ADD group is often ignored because they do not bring enough negative attention to themselves: They’re not a big enough problem. Many of these children, teenagers, or adults earn the unjust labels “willful,” “lazy,” “unmotivated,” or “not that smart.” Moreover, females have ADD in almost the same number as males, yet are diagnosed four to five times less often. * ADD is a serious societal problem: 35 percent never finish high school (25 percent repeat at least one grade). 52 percent of untreated teens and adults abuse drugs or alcohol. 19 percent smoke cigarettes (compared to 10 percent of the general population). 43 percent of untreated hyperactive boys will be arrested for a felony by age 16. 50 percent of inmates in a number of studies have been found to have ADD (75 percent in one study). 75 percent have interpersonal problems; untreated ADD sufferers have a higher percentage of motor vehicle accidents, speeding tickets, citations for driving without a license, and suspended or revoked licenses. They also have many more medical visits and emergency-room visits. Parents of ADD children divorce three times more often than the general population. ADD is found in every country where it has been studied and in about the same proportions. Poor parents or teachers can certainly make ADD symptoms worse, but ADD is largely a genetic disorder. ADD behaviors often make even skilled parents and teachers appear stressed and inept. * The harder many people with ADD try, the worst things get for them. Brain-imaging studies show that when people with ADD try to concentrate, the part of their brains involved with concentration, focus, and follow-through actually shuts down—just when they need it to turn on. * Many people never outgrow ADD and have symptoms that interfere with their whole lives. Half of those children diagnosed with ADD will have disabling symptoms into adulthood. * Stimulant medications, such as Adderall, Ritalin, or Dexedrine are among the safest and most effective medications in psychiatry. Ritalin has been approved in the U.S. for approximately fifty years. In doses prescribed for ADD, these medications have little, if any, potential for abuse. In fact, work done by psychiatrist Joseph Biederman at Harvard demonstrated that children treated for ADD have a much lower risk for drug abuse than untreated children. Untreated ADD has many more side effects than these medications. * Stimulants are very effective medications when prescribed properly. But in order to effectively treat ADD, a comprehensive treatment approach is essential, including education, support, exercise, nutrition, and, yes, medication. Unfortunately, medications are the only treatments given to the vast majority of people diagnosed with ADD in America.Why are there so many myths and negative reactions about ADD when physiciansknow so much about it? The answer is simple. Until now, you couldn’t see ADD.Children, teens, and adults with ADD look like everyone else. Sure, they may bemore distractible, more impulsive, and more restless. And after all, it’s a loteasier just to chalk up someone’s problem as bad behavior or a child as a “badegg” than to try to help. But unless you knew the story of an ADD person’s life,you couldn’t see that he or she has ADD. Until now!THE GOOD NEWSThis book, I hope, will put to rest the debate over whether or not ADD is realby showing the areas of dysfunction in the brain. New brain-imaging research,conducted at my clinic, has uncovered the ADD brain. Based on our research withthousands of ADD patients using brain SPECT imaging (one of the mostsophisticated functional brain-imaging studies in the world), we have been ableto see where ADD resides in the brain and why it has such a negative impact onbehavior. Right or wrong, humans have an innate distrust of the intangible, butseeing the ADD brain can cause the destructive myths and prejudices to fadeaway.As you’ll see in the pages that follow, ADD affects many areas of the brain,primarily the prefrontal cortex (the brain’s controller of concentration,attention span, judgment, organization, planning, and impulse control), theanterior cingulate gyrus (the brain’s gear shifter), the temporal lobes (wherethe brain houses memory and experience), the basal ganglia (which produce theneurotransmitter dopamine that drives the prefrontal cortex), and the deeplimbic system (the brain’s mood control center). Before-and-after imaging showsthat, with effective treatment, brain function can dramatically improve and givesufferers more access to their own abilities. I want to stress something:Treatment does not make ADD sufferers different people: It removes the barriershindering them from being the people they already are.The first of its kind, this book will give you a completely new perspective onADD. You’ll see actual ADD brain images (many before and after treatment) andidentify the six types of ADD that we have recently described (based on acombination of our work with many others in the field). You can also take acomprehensive questionnaire that will allow you to identify ADD (and which type)within yourself or others. Most important, this book offers promising newsolutions.That’s right, six types of ADD—not the two currently believed. Understanding thenuanced complexities of ADD allows us to treat everyone more effectively whilehelping people who would otherwise be ignored. Type 1: Classic ADD—sufferers are inattentive, distractible, disorganized,hyperactive, restless, and impulsive.Type 2: Inattentive ADD—sufferers are inattentive, sluggish, slow-moving, havelow motivation, and are often described as space cadets, daydreamers, or couchpotatoes.Type 3: Overfocused ADD—sufferers have trouble shifting attention; frequentlyget stuck in loops of negative thoughts or behaviors; are obsessive; worryexcessively; are inflexible; frequently behave oppositionally andargumentatively. Type 4: Temporal Lobe ADD—sufferers are inattentive, irritable;aggressive; have dark thoughts, mood instability, and are severely impulsive.Type 5: Limbic ADD—sufferers are inattentive, experience chronic low-gradedepression, are negative (e.g., “glass half empty syndrome”), have low energy,and have frequent feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness.Type 6: “Ring of Fire” ADD—sufferers are inattentive, extremely distractible,angry, irritable, overly sensitive to the environment, hyperverbal, extremelyoppositional, and experience cyclic moodiness. Knowing which ADD type you or your child has is critical to establishing aneffective treatment program. Treating some types of ADD with standard remedieswill make things much worse. You’ll learn that specifically tailoredinterventions, on the other hand, often lead to quick and dramatic improvement.A STEP-BY-STEP PROGRAM FOR HEALING EACH TYPE OF ADDAfter helping you properly identify if ADD is an issue for you (or someone elseyou know) and which type, this book will offer advice on how to treat it. You’lllearn the same clear step-by-step brain enhancement program for optimizing brainfunction and overcoming ADD barriers that I use at The Amen Clinic. I have foundthis program effective, powerful, and easy to understand; while much of theprogram can be done outside of the doctor’s office, for the medication andpsychotherapeutic components you’ll need to consult a doctor. A list ofknowledgeable physicians and therapists, along with strategies to find competentclinicians, begins on page 380.The Amen Clinic ADD Brain Enhancement Program is an individualized combinationof strategies geared toward enhancing the brain function of each ADD type. Foreach type, we will recommend: * education * emotional and social support * medication, vitamins, herbs, diet, exercise, targeted brainwave biofeedback strategies * school and work strategies * social skill strategies * thinking skills * coaching * self-regulation exercises.This book will give you a first-ever look into truly understanding ADD and thesix ADD types. In addition it will give you an effective program for enhancingbrain function and overcoming the ADD traits that sabotage chances for successin all aspects of living—in relationships, at work or school, and internally.ADD affects whole families, not just individuals. Therefore, the following pageswill also have extensive material on the dynamics of living in an ADD household(for parents, spouses, and siblings), along with many practical suggestions foreffective cohabitation.A note for teachers, vice principals, social workers, policeman, paroleofficers, marital therapists, psychologists, physicians, attorneys, and even IRSagents: Many people with ADD have societal problems and this program can teachyou how to work with them. Here are some common examples of the societalchallenges people with ADD face: * difficulties in school and spending excessive time in vice-principals’ offices * frequent speeding tickets and accidents * getting in trouble with the law (Many teens with ADD tend to find trouble. For example, an ADD kid is with a group of teenagers and a police officer walks up to them. The teen with ADD is the one who will likely say something disrespectful and get himself hauled to jail.) * problems with parole officers (The incidence of ADD in prison is very high and parole officers frequently bust their clients with ADD for not following through on their programs.) * relationship problems (Marital therapists often unknowingly spend excessive time with ADD clients because of their difficulties in relationships. When this dynamic is ignored, the ADD person or couple may stay in therapy unnecessarily for many years.) * legal difficulties (People with ADD are overrepresented as clients in attorneys’ offices. Lawyers frequently see ADD clients in domestic disputes, divorces, civil suits, and criminal cases.) * tax problems (IRS agents frequently encounter people with ADD. Procrastination is a common problem in ADD and many put off filing or paying their taxes until the last possible minute and beyond.)A PERSONAL NOTEI have not only studied ADD from a clinical perspective, I have lived it athome. Several of my own children have been diagnosed with ADD. For years I livedwith the guilt that is often associated with having a family member who has thisdisorder. I thought that I was a terrible husband and a terrible father. Thesefeelings were compounded by the fact that I was a psychiatrist and that I“should” have a perfect marriage and I “should” have well-behaved children.Things “should” have been better than they were. My son used to joke that ourfamily was like the cartoon Simpson family poster that read, “OK, everybody,let’s pretend that we’re a nice, normal family” as they were getting ready totake a family picture. It was not until my children were diagnosed and treatedproperly that the clouds of guilt began to give way to understanding.I know this disorder from the inside out. I know what it is like: * to have trouble holding a small child because she is in nonstop motion * to chase a child through the store * to look on in horror as a 4-year-old child darts across a busy parking lot * to watch a child take four hours to do twenty minutes of homework * to watch a child stare at a writing assignment for hours, unable to get thoughts from his brain to the paper * to go to teachers’ conferences where my child has been described as bright, spacey, and underachieving * to have to repeat myself thirty-two times to get a child up in the morning * to be asked for help at 11:00 P.M. the night before a term paper was due when the child knew about it for four weeks * to be angry every school morning for years because a child is continually ten minutes late * to be amazed that a child’s room can become so messy in such a short period of time * to be always on alert in a store or at a friend’s house so that my child won’t touch or break something * to be frustrated by trying to teach a child something, only to have him or her continually be distracted by something irrelevant * to feel guilty about the negative feelings I have toward a child after I’ve told him or her not to do something for the umpteenth time * to be embarrassed to the point of madness in a restaurant (and wonder why I’m spending money to suffer) * to be interrupted without mercy while I’m on the telephone * to live through angry outbursts that have little or no provocation.I have used the principles in this book to guide the treatment of my patientsand to help my own family. I know the information will help you."},{"pageContent":"PART 1ADD UNCOVERED"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1ADD IN THE REAL WORLDStories Through the Life CycleADD may not make someone look different, but you can see it plainly if you knowwhat to look for. The following case histories demonstrate what ADD “looks like”throughout the life cycle. These stories are real. The names and details havebeen altered, as they have been throughout this book, to protect theconfidentiality of my patients.CHILDRENBillyBilly, age 9, had trouble in school since starting kindergarten. The teachersseemed to call his parents at least once a month to complain about Billy’sbehavior. He frequently interrupted others, they said, and he had problems withdistractibility, a short attention span, and hyperactivity, and he couldn’t stayin his seat. Again and again Billy was told that he was impulsive and did thingswithout thinking. The teachers reported that he got into many fights with theother children, because he “seemed to take things the wrong way.” Additionally,Billy’s work was sloppy, he often forgot or lost assignments, and his desk wasan absolute disorganized mess!His parents knew most of these problems firsthand. Billy was a difficult childto parent. He said things without thinking, often argued when told to dosomething, and became angry with little provocation. Homework was always astruggle with Billy. Work that typically took their other kids thirty minutes tofinish took Billy three or four hours. While doing his homework, he was up everyfive minutes looking for food or bothering his older sister. In the first threeyears of school, Billy was labeled a willful, defiant child. He was often sadand frustrated, and he had a tendency to blame others for his problems.His parents didn’t know what to do. They had known of the problems for sometime, and they alternated between blaming Billy, blaming the “lousy” school, andblaming themselves. When Billy was 5 years old, his mother took him to thepediatrician because of his high activity level and difficult nature. While shewas talking to the doctor, however, Billy sat perfectly still and he was verypolite and attentive to the doctor. The doctor told Billy’s mother that therewas nothing the matter with the boy and that she should take parenting classes.The mother left the pediatrician’s office in tears because he confirmed herworst fear: She was a defective parent who caused Billy’s problems. Despite theparenting classes, the problems continued.When he was in third grade, Billy came to my office for an evaluation. It wasclear from watching him that he had difficulty concentrating and wasdistractible, active, and impulsive. Billy had Classic ADD: He was inattentive,distractible, disorganized, hyperactive, and impulsive. I placed him onmedication, talked with the school on effective classroom management techniques,and had his parents attend a parenting group designed for dealing with difficultchildren. I also taught Billy some specialized biofeedback techniques. Sixmonths after ADD treatment, Billy was a different child. He was less impulsive,his attention span had increased, and he appeared calmer. Even his grades hadimproved. Four years later he likes himself, is effective at school, and hashealthy relationships at home and with friends.Shortly after I placed Billy on medication, I asked him about the time in thepediatrician’s office when he had been 5 years old. I asked him why he had beenable to sit so still during the interview. He told me that he thought the doctorwas going to do brain surgery on him. You would sit still, too, if you thoughtsomeone was going to open up your skull!MelissaMelissa, age 5, had been affectionately labeled the “pink tornado.” Ever sinceshe could walk, she ran. Everywhere. Her parents were always on edge, wonderingwhat she was going to do next. She climbed. She swung on cupboard doors. She raninto the street as soon as her mother’s back was turned. She was her own “littlewrecking crew” when she went shopping with her mom or dad. Her parents broughther to see me after she was nearly run down in a parking lot after she openedthe car door and ran into a store.Her parents also reported that Melissa was moody, irritable, oppositional,extremely talkative, and able to throw monumental tantrums. Her mothercomplained that she could not take Melissa anywhere without a commotion. Inrestaurants she wiggled, yelled out, and screamed if she didn’t get her way.Other adults would stare at Melissa’s parents with a look that said, “Why don’tyou beat that bratty child into submission!” Lord knows they spanked this childmore than they thought any child should be spanked. That didn’t seem to be theanswer. In fact, the more they spanked Melissa, the more she would act up—almostas if she was driven for more punishment. Melissa had a very short attentionspan, never playing with anything for longer than a few minutes. She could tearher room apart in a moment. Her parents actually put a lock on the outside ofher room to keep her out when her parents were not supervising her.Melissa tore up my office too. She climbed up my bookcases, messed up the paperson my desk, and screamed at her parents when they asked her to settle down. Itseemed that she invited her parents to spank her in front of me. Melissa hadnever been abused and no obvious emotional trauma was evident in her life. Theparents, who cared for each other very much, wondered how long they could lastas a family.Melissa had a severe case of “Ring of Fire” ADD. It probably had genetic roots.Her mother’s father was an alcoholic and her uncle on her father’s side was injail for assault. Melissa also had an aunt with bipolar disorder (manicdepression). She became more active and aggressive on Ritalin. Dexedrine did thesame thing to her. With the atypical response to medication, I ordered a brainSPECT study, which showed multiple overactive areas across the cortical surfaceof her brain. With this information, I placed her on Depakote—an antiseizuremedication often helpful for cases like this—and a higher protein diet. Withinseveral weeks she became more settled, more cooperative, more playful, moreattentive, and much more relaxed. Her mother was amazed at how little she wasyelling atMelissa now. The parents also took a parenting class, which helped them gain theskills necessary to deal with a very challenging child.TEENAGERSLouanneLouanne’s mother came to one of my lectures. When I described ADD, she startedto cry, knowing that the symptoms I had listed fit her daughter’s life. Shortlythereafter, she brought Louanne to see me. Louanne had a short attention span,was easily distracted, and often did not finish her assignments. She had lowself-esteem and she talked incessantly without saying very much of substance.Louanne complained of low energy and no motivation. She had always wanted to bea music teacher, but she began to believe that she couldn’t do the work tosucceed in college. She thought that she was slow and different from herfriends. She sat in my office, already demoralized at age 16.Louanne had Inattentive ADD, a common but rarely diagnosed condition in females.I started her on Dexedrine, had her increase her exercise and protein intake,and worked with her on self-esteem and school strategies. Within a month ofstarting treatment, Louanne dramatically improved. I remember her coming into myoffice so tickled that she could finally get her work done. In the semesterafter she started treatment, her grade point average went from a 2.1 to a 3.0.She was especially pleased that she could compete with her friends at school andno longer thought of herself as “dumber than them.” The demoralized girl I hadfirst met was developing into a hopeful and forward-looking woman. Her mothercommented that she was more thoughtful when she spoke and voiced the secretfeelings of many parents: “Just knowing that this is a medical disorder, withsigns, symptoms, and treatment, has given us immense hope for Louanne.”GreggWhen Gregg first came to see me at the age of 14, he was a wreck. He had justbeen expelled from his third school for fighting and breaking the rules. He toldoff teachers for fun and picked fights with other kids on the school grounds. Healso never did his homework and he talked about dropping out of school, sayinghe didn’t need an education to take care of himself. At home he was defiant,restless, messy, and disobedient. He teased his younger brother and sisterwithout mercy. Anytime his parents would speak to him, he’d get defensive andchallenging. His parents were at their wits’ end, and their next step was aresidential treatment center.When I first saw him he was a “turned off” teenager with averted eyes andnothing much to say. He told me that he didn’t want to be sent away but that hewasn’t able to get along with his family. He found school very hard and thoughthe was stupid. When I did a test of verbal intelligence on him, however, hisdemeanor started to change. He liked the test and seemed challenged by it. Hisverbal IQ score was 142, in the superior range and far from stupid. Looking backin Gregg’s history, it was clear he had had symptoms of ADD his whole life. Hewas a fidgety kid with awful handwriting and a messy desk. His desk at schoolwas always a mess. He had trouble waiting his turn in school, and endured beingcalled stupid because he had trouble learning.Due to the severity of his problems, and the potential departure of Gregg fromthe family, I ordered a brain SPECT study to evaluate the functioning of hisbrain. The study showed that he had two problems. When Gregg tried toconcentrate, the front part of his brain, which should increase in activity,actually decreased. This is the part of the brain that controls attention span,judgment, impulse control, and critical thinking. His brain study also showeddecreased activity in his left temporal lobe, which, when abnormal, often causesproblems with violent or aggressive behavior. I diagnosed Gregg with TemporalLobe ADD.As I explained these findings to Gregg, he became visibly relieved. “You mean,”he said, “the harder I try to concentrate, the worse it gets for me.” Heresponded very nicely to a combination of medication (Ritalin and Carbatrol) tocorrect the problems in his frontal and temporal lobes. In addition, I placedhim on vitamin E and ginkgo to enhance overall blood flow to his brain and didbiofeedback over his left temporal lobe. He was able to remain at home, finishhigh school, and start college—a far cry from the stupid troublemaker he andeveryone else thought he was.ADULTSBrettBrett, 27, had just been fired from his fourth job in a year. He blamed hisbosses for expecting too much of him, but it was the same old story. Brett hadtrouble with details, he was often late to work, he seemed disorganized, and hewould miss important deadlines. The end came when he impulsively told off adifficult customer who complained about his attitude.All his life Brett had similar problems, and his mother was tired of bailing himout. He dropped out of school in the eleventh grade, despite having been foundto have a high IQ. He was restless, fidgety, impulsive, and had a fleetingattention span. When he was in school, small amounts of homework would take himseveral hours to complete, even with much nagging and yelling from his mother.Brett had mastered the art of getting people angry at him, and it seemed toothers that he intentionally stirred things up.Brett had had lifelong symptoms of Classic ADD that had gone unnoticed, eventhough Brett had been tested on three separate occasions. With appropriatetreatment at last, his life made a dramatic turnaround. He returned to school,finished a technical degree in fire-inspection technology, and got a job. He haskept that job for eight years now and feels that he is happier, more focused,and more positive than ever before.LarryLarry, 62, came into therapy because his wife threatened to start divorceproceedings against him if he didn’t get help. She complained that he nevertalked to her, he was unreliable, he never finished projects that he started,and he was very negative. He tended to be moody, tired, and disinterested insex. As a child, he had mediocre to poor grades in school, and as an adult hewent from job to job, complaining of boredom.Larry was referred to me by his marital therapist, and rightly so: Larry hadLimbic ADD, with problems that looked like a combination of ADD and depression.Larry’s SPECT study showed decreased prefrontal cortex activity and increasedactivity in the deep limbic system of his brain. Seeing his scan convinced himof the need for treatment. He started on an intense aerobic exercise program,took nutritional supplements, and changed his diet. Within a month his mood wasbetter and he felt more focused. As Larry improved, the couple learned quicklyin marital therapy and have been happier than when they were first married.LindyLindy, 37, was ready to leave her husband when she first came to see me. “Wefight all the time,” she said. “Not over big things…but it sure gets old.” Lindyalso complained of being moody, often irritable, and short with her children.Furthermore, she had trouble getting to sleep and couldn’t get out of bed in themorning.In school she was easily distracted, and keeping up with taking notes was almostimpossible for her.Lindy’s husband had the same complaints of her. She was irritable, she seemed toprovoke fights with him or the children, and she had to have things a certainway or she’d become very upset. “Everyone takes off their shoes and socks beforethey come into the house. And if she sees a strand of hair on the floor, shebecomes very upset! She’s the only person I’ve ever met who vacuums the house at11 P.M. on Friday night.” He said that there were sexual problems. When theywere making love, she’d often become distracted and lose interest. She’d thentell her husband to “just get it over with.” The husband often felt that she washaving an affair.Lindy’s grandfather, father, and brother had problems with alcohol. She also hada niece and a nephew who were diagnosed with ADD. As I listened to her story,along with the comments from her husband, it was clear that Lindy hadOverfocused ADD, where she had trouble shifting her attention. This caused herto have to have things a certain way at home and made it hard for her to takenotes in school. She responded nicely to a combination of Ritalin and Prozac,exercise, and increased complex carbohydrates in her diet. After several monthsshe was more relaxed at home, school was much easier for her, she was betterwith the children, and her relationship with her husband was more positive."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2THE ADD STORYDespite what it may seem from the breathless media reports, ADD is not new. Asearly as the seventeenth century, the philosopher John Locke described aperplexing group of young students who, “try as they might, they cannot keeptheir minds from straying.” History is full of references to people fitting thesymptom pattern of inattention, restlessness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.Abraham Lincoln’s third son, Tad, fit the picture. He was described ashyperactive, impulsive (bursting into the Oval Office while chasing hisbrother), and inattentive. He had learning problems. His mother hired tutorafter tutor to come into the White House to help Tad, but they all quit, sayingthat he was not teachable. One wonders if Mary Todd Lincoln didn’t have ADDherself. She too struggled with impulsivity. On a number of occasions sheoverspent the White House budget, causing political embarrassment and ridiculefor the president. One time when President Lincoln was reviewing the troops, ayoung Captain’s wife caught his eye. Mrs. Lincoln noticed her husband looking atthe young woman and started screaming at her husband in front of the wholecrowd.ADD is not even new in the medical literature. George Still, a pediatrician atthe turn of the last century, described children who were hyperactive,inattentive, and impulsive. Unfortunately, he labeled them “morally defective.”During the great flu epidemic of 1918, many children also contracted viralencephalitis and meningitis. Of those who survived the brain infection, manywere described with symptoms now considered classic for ADD. By the 1930s thelabel “minimal brain damage” was coined to describe these children. The labelwas changed in the 1960s to “minimal brain dysfunction” because no anatomicalabnormality could be found in the children. Whatever its name, ADD has been partof the psychiatric terminology since the inception of the Diagnostic andStatistical Manual (DSM) in 1952 (The DSM is the diagnostic bible listingclinical criteria for various psychiatric disorders). Every version of the DSMhas described the core symptoms of ADD, albeit by a different name every time.ADD CORE SYMPTOMSThere is a group of core symptoms common to those who have ADD. These includeshort attention span for routine tasks, distractibility, organizational problems(space and time), difficulty with follow-through, and poor internal supervision.These symptoms exist over a prolonged period of time and are present from anearly age, although they may not be evident until a child is pushed toconcentrate or to organize his or her life.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM)DSM VersionName for ADD1Hyperactivity of Childhood2Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood3Attention Deficit Disorder with or without hyperactivity3RAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder4Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity DisorderShort Attention Span for Regular, Routine TasksA short attention span is the hallmark symptom of this disorder. People with ADDhave trouble sustaining attention and effort over prolonged periods of time.Their minds tend to wander and they frequently get distracted, thinking about ordoing other things than the task at hand. Yet, one of the things that oftenfools inexperienced clinicians assessing this disorder is that people with ADDdo not have a short attention span for everything. Often, people with ADD canpay attention perfectly well to things that are new, novel, highly stimulating,interesting, or frightening. These things provide enough of their own intrinsicstimulation (adrenaline), which activates the brain functions that help peoplewith ADD focus and concentrate. When asked about attention span, most peoplewith ADD say that they can pay attention “just fine.” But they oftenspontaneously add the phrase “…if I’m interested.” That is the most importantpart of the answer: People with ADD need adrenaline in order to focus.In one study, researchers found a deficiency of adrenaline (the hormonefrequently associated with stress or excitement) in the urine samples of ADDchildren. I often think of ADD as “adrenaline deficit disorder,” because peoplewith ADD can focus with excitement and interest, but not without it. My son whohas ADD without hyperactivity (Type 2), for example, used to take four hours todo a half hour’s worth of homework, frequently getting off task. Yet, if yougave him a car stereo magazine, he would quickly read it from cover to cover andremember every little detail in it.People with ADD have problems paying attention to regular, routine, everydaymatters such as homework, schoolwork, chores, or paperwork—problems that haveplagued them their whole lives. The mundane is terrible for them and not bychoice. As we will see later on, they need excitement or interest to stimulatean underactive brain.Attention patterns are crucial to a diagnosis of ADD. A person’s tendency todeny that they have attentional problems (because they can concentrate withintense interest) is often a roadblock to accepting the diagnosis or gettingproper treatment. I make sure that I ask about attention span for regular,routine, everyday tasks. I also ask about attention span from those who know theperson. Other people may be better observers than the person being evaluated.Parents, siblings, spouses, and friends are often to quick to complain aboutattention and focusing abilities, even when the person has completely denied anytrouble concentrating.In addition to clinical history (from family and friends as well as the subjecthim-or herself), our office also uses the Conner’s Continuous Performance Task(CPT) to measure attention span and aid in making the diagnosis of ADD. TheConner’s CPT is a computer-based fifteen-minute test of attention, vigilance,response time, and impulse control. On the screen, letters flash at one-second,two-second, and four-second intervals. Every time you see a letter, you hit thespace bar, except when you see the letter X. Whenever you see the letter X youjust let it go and do not hit the space bar. People with ADD often have erraticresponse times (good when the letters come fast at one second intervals, butslower when the letters come at two-or four-second intervals) and more impulsiveresponses, hitting an excessive number of X’s. This test frustrates many peoplewith ADD.DistractibilityDistractibility differs from a short attention span. The issue here is not aninability to sustain attention, but rather a hypersensitivity to theenvironment. Most of us can block out unnecessary environmental stimuli: trafficsounds, the sound of the air conditioner or heater turning on, the smell of foodfrom the cafeteria, birds flying by the classroom window, even the feel of ourown clothing against our skin. People with ADD, however, are oftenhypersensitive to their senses, and they have trouble suppressing the sounds andsights of the environment—the sensory noise that surrounds us. Thedistractibility is likely due to the underlying mechanism of ADD, underactivityin the prefrontal cortex of the brain.The prefrontal cortex has many inhibitory cells that signal other areas of thebrain to settle down. It is supposed to send these inhibitory signals to theparietal lobes (our sensory cortex) so that we do not sense too much of theenvironment. However, when the prefrontal cortex is underactive, the parietallobes bombard us with environmental stimuli. The prefrontal cortex also sendsinhibitory signals to the brain’s emotional centers in the limbic system. Whenthis doesn’t happen, people get distracted by their internal thoughts andfeelings. For example, many of my patients tell me that they frequently feelirritated by their own clothing. Most people never feel their own clothingunless their attention is directed to it. When directed to think about the shoeson your feet, you can easily feel them, but since you don’t need to payattention to the feeling of your shoes, your brain blocks out the unnecessarysensation. People with ADD cannot do that. My daughter with Type 3 (Overfocused)ADD used to repetitively take off her socks if the seam was not perfectlyaligned. ADD patients also routinely cut the tags out of their clothing. Iremember the weekend my ex-wife (who had been diagnosed with ADD) moved into myapartment after our wedding. Unbeknown to me, she cut the tags out of all of myshirts. When I asked her why, she said she thought I would appreciate it. Shehated how tags felt and always removed them from her clothing. As you canimagine, the hypersensitivity to touch can also cause sexual problems. Manypeople with ADD do not like to be touched, or they react negatively if touchedthe “wrong” way. In a similar way, sight sensitivity is a frequent problem.While it may not seem like much of an issue, seeing too much can cause problemsin many situations. When driving, for example, it is important to focus on theroad. Many people with ADD, however, see everything around them, becomingbombarded with visual stimuli. Reading a book also requires you to block outextraneous visual stimuli. Unfortunately, many people with ADD are unable to dothis and they are frequently distracted by the movements around them.Many people with ADD complain of being excessively bothered by sounds,especially the chewing sounds of others. I have several young patients who willnot go to school because they are so bothered by the sounds that other studentsmake. I once evaluated an inmate who told me that he got murderous thoughts whenother inmates would drag chess pieces across the chess board while playing thegame. The noise, he said, would make him crazy. Other patients have told me thatthey need white noise (such as that of fans) to block out the other sounds inthe environment. My ex-wife used to sleep with a fan on in our room in order notto hear all of the other sounds in the house—whether it is 70 degrees out or 20degrees out. I often hid under the covers to avoid the noise and the cold breezefrom the fan.Sensitivity to taste is another common problem. Many people with ADD will eatonly foods with a certain taste or texture. Parents frequently complain thatthey have trouble finding foods their children will eat. One of my patients wentthrough a two-year period where he would only eat burritos with peanut butterand bananas.Organizational Problems (Space and Time)Organizational struggles are also very common in ADD, specificallydisorganization for space, time, projects, and long-term goals.A common ADD trait, space disorganization is often seen early in the lives ofADD children. When you look at their rooms, closets, dresser drawers, desks, orbook bags, you frequently see a disaster. Things are left half done, half putaway, or dropped wherever. I used to tell my son that his room followed thesecond law of physics, entropy, in which things degrade from order to disorder.His room showed hyperentropy. I remember helping him clean his room on Sundayafternoons, but by Sunday evening it often looked a mess. Once, when he was inthe third grade, I went to an open house at his school. All of the desks were inneat rows…except one. It was out of place with papers hanging out of it. Myheart sank. I knew it was Anton’s desk, and when I opened the desk’s lid I sawhis name.Other people often complain bitterly about the disorganization, such as bosses,teachers, children, and spouses. I have received a number of letters from wiveswriting about their ADD husbands. “He’ll tell you he’s organized,” they write,“but I am enclosing a picture of his office filing cabinet, closet, or garage].What do you think?” The pictures show spaces that are incredibly overstuffed anddisorganized.People with Type 3 ADD often appear very organized on the outside. They areoften perfectly dressed, and parts of their living space may be very neat. Forexample, they may insist on perfect living rooms, but if you go into theirdrawers or their closets, you’ll find a disaster. Similarly, time organizationplagues people with ADD. They tend to be late and have trouble predicting howlong things will take them to do. Often they will agree to do too many things,not realizing the time commitment involved. The chronic tardiness lands many ADDpeople in deep trouble. For example, they get fired from jobs for being late towork, not once, but on a regular basis. Many of my patients’ spouses have toldme that they have to lie in order to be on time for appointments or engagements.“If I tell her we have to leave at noon, invariably she won’t be ready until12:30 or 1 P.M. It makes me so mad! So in order for me not to feel so stressedout I tell her we have to leave at 11:00. She hasn’t caught on yet.”ADD people often take a haphazard or disorganized approach to projects orchores, dramatically increasing the time it takes to complete them. For example,one of my patients planned to clean out the garage over the weekend. On Fridaynight he put half of the garage contents into the driveway, but then he startedorganizing the boxes that were inside the garage. Three weeks later theneighbors started to complain about the mess in the driveway. One of the collegestudents I treat complained about spending excessive time on projects. When Iasked him to explain the process of doing a project, it was clear that it had nobeginning, middle, or end: He was working on multiple ideas that did not haveany structure to them.In addition, many people with ADD take a disorganized approach to their ownlives. They frequently lack long-term goals and tend to live from crisis tocrisis or problem to problem.Difficulty with Follow-throughPeople with ADD frequently suffer from poor follow-through, lacking the stayingpower to see projects through to the end. They will do something so long asthere is intense interest. In addition, they put things off until the very lastminute—until the looming deadline generates enough stress to entice them to getit done. For example, if there is a term paper due in a month, they will put itoff, put it off, and put it off until they are pushed to the wall of thedeadline, working feverishly to finish, even if they have told themselves thatthis time they will get to their project early.Often people with ADD have so many different interests, they will only do aproject as long as long as it holds their curiosity. I once saw a collegeprofessor for evaluation. His wife sat in on the initial session. I asked himhow many projects he started last year. He said, “I think about 300.” His wifeadded in an irritated tone, “He only finished three, and none of them were forme.”Many people with ADD will complete 50 to 80 percent of their task and then gooff to another project. They frequently get distracted by other things and failto follow through with the task at hand. Many people with ADD pay late fees onbills, even though they had the money to pay the bill on time.Poor follow-through affects many areas of life. Here are some examples: * schoolwork—fails to turn in assigned work * chores at home—things often put off until the very last minute or not done at all * work—reports or paperwork not turned in on time * finances—late charges paid, even when the money is there because bills were not paid on time * and friendships—promises go unfulfilled.Poor Internal SupervisionMany people with ADD have poor internal supervision. The prefrontal cortex (pfc)is the brain’s chief executive because it is so heavily involved withforethought, planning, impulse control, and decision making. North Carolinaneuropsychiatrist Thomas Gualtieri, M.D., succinctly summarized the humanfunctions of the pfc: “the capacity to formulate goals, to make plans for theirexecution, to carry them out in an effective way, and to change course andimprovise in the face of obstacles or failure, and to do so successfully, in theabsence of external direction or structure. The capacity of the individual togenerate goals and to achieve them is considered to be an essential aspect of amature and effective personality. It is not a social convention or an artifactof culture. It is hard wired in the construction of the prefrontal cortex andits connections.”When there are problems in this part of the brain, as is typical in ADDpatients, exhibiting forethought is a constant struggle. The pfc helps you thinkabout what you say or do before you say or do it. The pfc helps you, inaccordance with your experience, select among alternatives in social and worksituations. For example, a person with good pfc function is more likely to havea tempered, reasonable disagreement with a spouse. A person with poor pfcfunction is more likely to do or say something that will make the situationworse. Likewise, if you’re a checkout clerk with good pfc function and adifficult, complaining person (who has poor pfc function) comes through yourline, you are more likely to keep quiet or give a thoughtful response that helpsthe situation. If you have poor pfc function, you are more likely to do or saysomething that will inflame the situation. The pfc helps you problem-solve, seeahead of a situation, and, by learning through experience, pick between the mosthelpful alternatives. Effectively playing a game such as chess requires good pfcfunction.This is also the part of the brain that helps you learn from mistakes. Good pfcfunction doesn’t that mean you won’t make mistakes. Rather, you won’t make thesame mistake over and over. You are able to learn from the past and apply itslessons. A student with good pfc function can learn that if he or she starts along-term project early, there is more time for research and less anxiety overgetting it done. A student with decreased pfc function doesn’t learn from pastfrustrations and may tend to put everything off until the last minute. Ingeneral, poor pfc function leads people to make repetitive mistakes. Theiractions are not based on experience, or forethought, but rather on the moment.The moment is what matters. This phrase comes up over and over with my ADDpatients. For many people with ADD, forethought is a struggle. It is natural forthem to act out what is important to them at the immediate moment, not twomoments from now or five moments from now, but now! A person with ADD may beready for work a few minutes early, but rather than leave the house and be ontime, she may do another couple of things that make her late. Likewise, a personwith ADD may be sexually attracted to someone he just met, and even though he ismarried and his personal goal is to stay married, he may have a sexual encounterthat puts that at risk. The moment was what mattered.In the same vein, many people with ADD take what I call a crisis managementapproach to their lives. Rather than having clearly defined goals and acting ina consistent manner to reach them, they ricochet from crisis to crisis. Inschool, people with ADD have difficulty with long-term planning. Instead ofkeeping up as the semester goes along, they focus on the crisis in front of themat the moment—the next test or term paper. At work they are under continualstress. Deadlines loom and tasks go uncompleted. It seems as though there is aneed for constant stress in order to get consistent work done. The constantstress, however, takes a physical toll on everyone involved (the person, his orher family, coworkers, employers, friends, etc.).Assessing ADDThe hallmark assessment tool for ADD is a detailed history by an experiencedclinician. I have found that a life history is the most reliable diagnostictool. Of course, I use other things, such as checklists, brain-imaging studies,information from collateral sources (such as teachers and caregivers), and bloodwork, but I find that a good clinical history is essential to proper diagnosis.It is most helpful to take a biological, psychological, and sociologicalapproach when evaluating any psychiatric, learning, or behavioral problem. Ifyou look at problems in these three spheres you are likely to obtain the bestpossible evaluation and set the stage for proper treatment.Bio-Psycho-Social Assessment of ADDimage [Images/page45.jpg]BIOLOGICAL FACTORSimage [Images/page46.jpg]GeneticsSince ADD tends to run in families, an assessment should begin with a goodfamily history starting with the grandparents from each side and learning asmuch as possible about the primary family members.In the last decade scientists have made progress in understanding the geneticsof ADD. The pioneering works of David Comings, Florence Levy, and others haveclearly demonstrated a genetic component to this disorder. Specific gene sitesimplicated include the HLA on chromosome 6, the dopamine transporter gene onchromosome 5, and the D4 receptor gene on chromosome 11. Child psychiatristFlorence Levy from Australia found that 81 percent of identical twins (who shareidentical genetic material) had ADD, while fraternal twins (who have siblinggenetic material) share ADD only 29 percent of the time.Based on both my clinical experience and the medical literature, it is safe toconclude that a very high percentage of ADD is passed down genetically. In myexperience, if one parent has ADD, then 60 percent of the offspring will have itas well. If both parents have ADD then 85 to 90 percent of the children willhave it. Anyone who does this work over time has no doubt it is a genetic familydisorder and that contributes to the high incidence of family dysfunction in ADDhouseholds. There are often multiple challenging people in an ADD family, notjust one challenging child.Head InjuryI have also seen other factors involved in causing ADD. One of the most commonis unrecognized head injury, especially to the left front side of the brain. Inmy experience, many professionals and parents discount or ignore the impact ofhead injuries. They think that a person needs to have a significant loss ofconsciousness for a prolonged period of time in order for it to do damage. Ourbrain-imaging work, as well as the work of others, is disproving this notion.More on head injuries in Chapter XI.Toxic ExposureWhen the brain is exposed to a lack of oxygen or some toxic substance, it ismuch more likely to show symptoms of ADD. Lack of oxygen can happen withpremature babies who have underdeveloped lungs, babies born with the cordwrapped tightly around their necks, and individuals after a drowning accident.Lack of oxygen causes a decrease in overall brain activity. Brain infections,such as meningitis or encephalitis, cause toxic inflammation in the brain anddamage tissue. Clearly, fetal exposure to drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes alsoput a child at risk for ADD and learning disabilities. Often mothers who usethese substances during pregnancy are medicating their own struggles withdepression, ADD, or anxiety. The babies inherit vulnerabilities to theseproblems and in addition experience toxicity to their brains.Medical Problems, MedicationsCertain medical problems, such as thyroid disease, can look like ADD. Anoveractive thyroid gland may look like Type 1 ADD (feeling hyperactive andinattentive), while an underactive thyroid may look like Type 2 ADD (feelinglethargic and inattentive). Likewise, certain medications, such as asthmamedications, can make people feel and look hyperactive and inattentive. It isimportant for your doctor to assess the impact of medical problems on behavior.Hormonal InfluencesHormonal influences play a major role in ADD. ADD symptoms are generally worsearound the time of puberty in both males and females. In females, ADD symptomsare also exacerbated in the premenstrual period and also around the time ofmenopause. A number of SPECT studies have shown an overall decrease in brainactivity when estrogen levels are low. During perimenopause or menopause, manywomen who had only mild ADD before now look as if they have major ADD symptoms.Estrogen replacement, although controversial, appears to have a positive effecton brain function.Drug AbuseIt is key to learn about drug abuse when assessing for ADD. While ADD and drugabuse commonly occur together, drug abuse can masquerade as ADD. New onset ADDsymptoms at the age of 14, for example, may signal marijuana abuse. Many drugabusers are not honest (due to feelings of shame or the fear of being foundout), so I will frequently order a drug screen to be sure. Drug screens are notfoolproof, but I have found that just the act of ordering the drug screen ishelpful. I generally say something like “I want to order a drug screen on you. Iknow you said that you weren’t using drugs, but people who do use drugs oftenwon’t admit to it. I want to do a thorough evaluation of you and just want tomake sure.” If a person says, “I don’t believe in drug screens. They are notreliable. I won’t do it,” that is generally a good indicator that he is usingdrugs. If he says, “No problem, I understand,” and willingly goes for the test,then it is generally a sign that he is not using drugs. Of course, I have beenfooled, so even if the patient agrees, I send the specimen to the lab.Poor DietIn the last thirty years our diet has changed dramatically. These days, childreneat a diet high in simple carbohydrates (sugar, white bread, white-flour foodproducts), poor in lean protein, and positively deficient in vegetables. Thinkabout the great American breakfast. Morning time is often rushed especially whenboth parents work outside the home, and there is less time to fix a nutritiousbreakfast. Kids eat Pop-Tarts, sugar cereals, donuts, frozen waffles, ormuffins. Gone are the days of sausage and eggs (protein), and sugar is in. Tryto find bread in the store without sugar or forms of sugar (corn syrup,high-fructose syrup, etc.). In my local supermarket, out of about thirty brandsof bread available, only one—a dark Russian rye bread—is made without any sugar.Your diet provides the fuel for the brain’s work. I have found that a diet highin simple carbohydrates makes attentional problems worse for most people,especially with people vulnerable to ADD. Most ADD children and adults simply dobetter on a high-protein, low–simple-carbohydrate diet (more on this later). Alack of protein causes a tremendous problem with focus throughout the day. If aperson is vulnerable to ADD, a high-carbohydrate, low-protein diet willcertainly make their symptoms worse.Lack of ExerciseExercise boosts blood flow to the brain. Unfortunately, children and teens getmuch less exercise than they did 20 years ago. With the advent of video andcomputer games children are spending more time indoors, doing activities whichrequire little exertion. A sedentary lifestyle makes someone more prone toexhibit ADD symptoms.PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORSimage [Images/page49.jpg]Early Neglect and AbuseBoth physical and emotional neglect and abuse contribute to ADD. The brain needsnurturing and appropriate stimulation to develop properly. When a baby isneglected or abused, the brain cannot develop properly and is put at great riskfor learning and behavioral problems. An extreme example of neglect occurredduring the late 1980s when thousands of Romanian orphans were raised withoutaffection, touching, or nurturing, even though they had food. Many of thesechildren developed severe emotional, learning, and behavioral problems. Brainscans showed overall decreased activity in their brains. Without appropriatestimulation, the brain does not make the connections it needs to make. Emotionalor physical abuse causes a rush of stress hormones and chemicals that poison ababy’s or child’s brain. Stress hormones damage the memory centers, and chronicstress causes the brain to become hyperalert, leading to severe distractibilityand an inability to filter out extraneous stimuli.Negative Self-TalkLow self-esteem, self-doubt, and a lack of confidence can make some look as ifthey have ADD. Of course, having ADD makes one more prone to these problems.Negative self-talk often stems from having people talk in a negative way towardyou, although this is not always the case. Type 5 (Limbic) ADD is oftenassociated with excessive negativity.Learned HelplessnessPsychologist Martin Seligman coined the term “learned helplessness” to describewhat he saw in depressed patients. I often see this phenomena in people withADD. Learned helplessness occurs when a person tries to do something important,such as study for school, but performs poorly. Then she tries again, but itdoesn’t work. She tries yet another time, but it still doesn’t work. Finally shegives up. This demoralization contributes heavily to ADD symptoms and must beassessed.SOCIAL AND SOCIETAL FACTORSimage [Images/page50.jpg]Social SituationEvaluating the current family and social situation is essential to get acomplete picture of a person. Who is she living with? What are the relationshipslike? How is the financial health of the family? Are there any physical oremotional challenges? Is there alcohol or drug abuse in the home?ADD Is Increasing in the PopulationADD is increasing in the population, a fact that frightens me, and it shouldfrighten you as well. When you look at the fallout from untreated ADD, oursociety may be in for a lot more problems, especially considering that ADDremains underdiagnosed and under-treated. Thirty years ago, teachers wouldtypically have one or two Classic ADD kids in their classrooms. Now I hear themsay they have three, four, or five of these kids. What is happening? Are we justbetter at recognizing ADD? Are societal influences causing more ADD symptoms?One answer comes from David Comings, M.D., a geneticist from the City of HopeHospital in Los Angeles. In his book The Gene Bomb he postulates that as oursociety becomes more technologically advanced, we require students to stay inschool longer to get the best jobs. The students who drop out of the educationalsystem first are those with ADD and learning disabilities. (Remember, 35 percentof untreated people with ADD never finish high school.) If you drop out ofschool first, what behavior are you likely to engage in first? You guessed it:sex. I see a much higher percentage of teenage pregnancies in ADD girls. They donot think through the consequences of their behavior. Also, according to Dr.Comings, ADD women have their first baby on average at the age of 20. Non-ADDwomen have their first baby on average at the age of 26. ADD women tend to havemore children. Non-ADD women tend to have fewer children.There is a historical example of how this childbearing dynamic can change apopulation. I am of Lebanese heritage. Lebanon was first made a country in 1943,but had long-standing roots in the Phoenician culture. At the time, in 1943, thecountry’s population was approximately half Christian and half Muslim. TheLebanese parliament was set up as half Christian and half Muslim to reflect thepopulation. At the time, however, the Christians were better educated than theirMuslim counterparts. They tended to stay in school longer. They also tended tohave fewer children. Thirty-two years later—in 1975, when civil war broke out inLebanon—the country was only one third Christian and two thirds Muslim. Part ofthe reason for the civil war was the change in population dynamics. Inthirty-two years, a generation and a half, the population showed a dramaticshift.Let’s bring this example closer to home. In 1972, renowned psychologist ThomasAuchenbauch performed a study to determine the incidence of learning andbehavioral problems in children among the general population. At the time, usingstandardized instruments that he developed, he reported that 10 percent of thechildhood population had learning or behavioral problems. A generation later, in1992, he repeated the study using the same psychological instruments onbasically the same population. He found a staggering difference: Eighteenpercent of the childhood population now met the criteria for learning orbehavioral problems. The incidence of problems had nearly doubled in ageneration. Why?Societal Contributions to ADDI believe the geneticists have a big part of the answer. ADD parents are havingmore ADD children. There are other factors contributing to the rise of ADD andrelated problems in our society: dietary changes, excessive television watching,video games, and decreased exercise. Moreover, we are also better at diagnosingADD. In addition to having improved psychological assessment tools, ADD hasreceived repeated national exposure over the past ten years. It has been on thecover of Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report. Almost all of the talkshows have done programs on ADD, and there have been several nationalbest-selling books. ADD has become part of movies, TV shows, courtroom dramas,and national legislation. We are at least better at thinking about it andtalking about it. I alone lecture thirty to forty times a year to professionals.Over the last ten years we have seen strong interest in the medical andmental-health community to learn more about ADD and get beyond the myths and thehype of ADD.As far as excess television is concerned, the research is very clear: Kids whowatch the most TV do the worst in school. TV is a “no brain” activity.Everything is provided for it (sounds, sights, plots, outcome, entertainment),and the brain doesn’t have to learn or make new connections. Like a muscle, themore you use your brain, the stronger it becomes and the more it can do. Theopposite is also true: The less you work it, the weaker it becomes. Repeatedlyengaging in “no brain” activities, such as TV, decreases a person’s ability tofocus. In addition, the pacing of TV has changed over the past thirty years.Thirty years ago a thirty-second commercial had ten three-second scenes. Thesame commercial in 2000 has thirty one-second scenes. We are being programmed toneed more stimulation in order to pay attention.Video games are another problem. I have seen that many ADD children literallybecome addicted to playing video games. They will play for hours at a time, tothe detriment of their responsibilities, and go through tantrums and withdrawalsymptoms when forced to stop. A recent study on brain-imaging and video gameswas published in the journal Nature. In the study, PET scans were taken while agroup of people played action video games. The researchers were trying to seewhere video games worked in the brain. They discovered that the basal ganglia(where dopamine is produced in the brain) were much more active when the videogames were being played than at rest. Both cocaine and Ritalin work in this partof the brain as well. The reason that cocaine is addictive and Ritalin is not isrelated to how each drug is metabolized. Cocaine has a powerful, immediateeffect that stimulates an enormous release of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Thepleasure this brings rapidly fades, leaving the addict wanting more. Ritalin, onthe other hand, works slowly, inducing no high or pleasure from taking it andthe effects stay around for a long time. Similarly, video games bring pleasureand focus by increasing dopamine release. The problem with them is that the moredopamine is released, the less neurotransmitter is available later on to doschoolwork, homework, chores, and so on. Many parents have told me that the morea child plays video games, the worse he does in school and the more irritable hetends to be when asked to stop playing.I saw the negative effects of video games in my own house. Nintendo came intoour home when my son was 10 years old. Initially, I thought that it was verycool. I never had exciting games like these when I was a child. But over thenext few years I saw him spending more and more time with the video games andless time on his work. Moreover, he would become argumentative when he was toldto stop playing. I decided that Nintendo had to go. We have all been better offsince.One cannot overlook the Internet as a potential source of serious problems forour children and ourselves. The Internet is such a valuable source ofinformation. (I have several Web sites, which we are very proud of, atwww.amenclinic.com and brainplace.com.) But the Internet is also filled withdanger and time wasters. Because of the impulsivity and excitement-seekingnature of many people with ADD, they frequently visit sexually explicit sites,engage in racy conversations with others, and find ways to get into trouble. Oneof my patients thought she fell in love over the Net. She was seventeen yearsold when the story unfolded. She met a man from Louisiana in a chat room. Theytalked for hours over the Net, sent scanned photos, started talking over thetelephone, and decided to marry after two months, even though they had never metin person. When I found out about it in therapy, I called a meeting with herparents. When she tried to break it off with this man, he threatened to killher. We discovered that he had recently gotten out of prison for violentbehavior. It’s essential that parents supervise time children spend on the Netand that they put limits over the kinds of sites available. Recent studies haveshown that the kids who spend the most time on the Net have the poorest socialskills. Balance and supervision are the biggest keys.I have become more concerned recently about a child’s exposure to how computerand TV screens flash (or refresh themselves). If you look at a computer monitoror television screen through a video camera, you will see thick black linesquickly roll across the screen. TV and computer screens flash at differentspeeds, up to 30 flashes or cycles per second. Interestingly, this speed offlashing is similar to a concentration brain state. Your brain gravitates tothat rhythm, and you tune in to whatever is drawing your attention—forced focus,so to speak. “Entrainment” is the technical term of this phenomena: Your brainpicks up the rhythm in the environment. So if a light (or TV) flashes at a slowrate, one’s brain picks up the slow rate and that person feels sleepy. If itflashes at a fast rate, you may feel energized or anxious. If your brain picksup a concentration flashing rate, you will focus on the TV or computer screen,even though you may not be at all interested in what’s on it. Have you ever hadthe experience of watching TV even though you didn’t want to—the feeling ofbeing mesmerized or compelled to watch, even though you were bored with what wason? I have. The most recent example of mass entrainment occurred in late 1997 inJapan. Tens of thousands of Japanese children were watching the top-ratedNintendo cartoon Pokémon. During one scene there was an explosion in which red,white, and yellow lights flashed at approximately 4.5 cycles (or flashes) persecond for several seconds. All of a sudden kids started to have seizures. Sevenhundred and thirty Japanese children went to emergency rooms that night,reporting seizures. Most of the children had never had a seizure before. The 4.5cycles per second happened to be a seizure frequency. That was a dramaticexample, but I wonder what all of this exposure to computer flashing is doing toour children. As far as I know, no one is studying it, and we should be.Video games and television have lead to another major contributor in the rise ofADD in our society: the lack of exercise. Exercise increases blood flow to allparts of the body, including the brain. As kids watch more TV and spend moretime exercising only their thumbs with video games, they are becoming moresluggish and less attentive. Through the years I have seen a direct relationshipbetween the level of exercise a person gets and the severity of their symptoms.I have seen a number of ADD professionals (such as physicians and attorneys) getthrough school by exercising two to four hours a day. I have also noted thatwhen my ADD patients are playing sports, such as basketball, where there isintense aerobic exercise, they do better in school, without any change in theirmedication. Exercise is important on many levels, and we’ll talk more about itlater on.Obtaining a bio-psycho-social evaluation gives clinicians the most completepicture. As we will see, it sets the stage for proper treatment.Other Things to Look For in Assessing ADDWhen ADD is present, these other problems should also be evaluated. Sometimesthese problems are misdiagnosed as ADD, sometimes they occur with ADD. Psychiatric/Adjustment Problems: Emotional and adjustment problems canmasquerade as ADD, be a result of ADD, or occur together with ADD. Here aresamples of the problems: Adjustment Disorders or Family Problems: Temporarily, family problems orsignificant stress can cause a person of any age to have problems withconcentration or restlessness. The difference between stress and ADD is historyand duration of the difficulties. ADD is a long-standing problem that isrelatively constant over time. The stress of long-term family problems can causea child to look as though he or she has ADD. It must be determined, however,whether or not the serious family problems are a result of ADD in one or more ofthe family members. Behavioral Problems Not Related to ADD: Some behavior problems have nothing todo with ADD. When parents have ineffective parenting skills, they can actuallyencourage difficult behavior in their children. Depressive Disorders: Depression may be confused with ADD, especially inchildren. Depressive symptoms include poor memory, low energy, negativity,periods of helplessness and hopelessness, social isolation, along with sleep andappetite changes. Many of these symptoms are also found in ADD. History is thekey to proper diagnosis. ADD symptoms are generally constant over time, whiledepression tends to fluctuate. Many people with ADD experience demoralization(from chronic failure) and may indeed look depressed when ADD is the primaryproblem. Depression and ADD often occur together. Manic-Depressive Disorder: Manic-depressive or “bipolar” symptoms may be similarto ADD. Both experience restless, excessive talkativeness, hyperactivity, racingthoughts, and impulsivity. The difference is usually found in the severity,consistency, and course of the symptoms. ADD remains constant; bipolar disorderfluctuates from highs to lows. People who have ADD are consistentlydistractible, restless, and impulsive. People with bipolar disorder will haveperiods of those symptoms, but they often fluctuate with depressive episodes andperiods of relative calm or normalcy. The manic highs of bipolar disorder arenot experienced by people with ADD. Anxiety Disorders: Anxiety disorders can also present similar symptoms to ADD,including restlessness, hyperactivity, forgetfulness, and an inability toconcentrate. Again, the key to proper diagnosis is history. As with depressionand bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders tend to fluctuate; ADD symptoms aregenerally constant. Moreover, having ADD can breed symptoms of anxiety ornervousness. When your mind turns off in the face of stress, it can causenervousness and fear in work, family, and social situations. It is common forpeople with ADD to experience significant anxiety from underachievement. Thesedisorders also commonly run together. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): OCD is marked by a person with obsessions(repetitive negative thoughts) and/or compulsions (repetitive negativebehaviors), which interfere with their lives. People with OCD get “stuck” or“locked in” to negative thoughts or behaviors. In my clinical experience, thereis a high percentage of people with ADD who also have features of OCD,especially if there is significant alcohol abuse in their family backgrounds.The overfocused subtype of ADD has many features in common with OCD, and bothdisorders tend to respond best to antiobsessive antidepressants, such as Prozac,Paxil, Luvox, Anafranil, and Zoloft. Tic Disorders, Such as Tourette’s Syndrome: Tic disorders are more common amongpeople with ADD. Tics are abnormal, involuntary motor movements, (blinking,shoulder shrugging, head jerking), or vocal sounds (throat clearing, coughing,blowing, and even swearing). Tourette’s syndrome occurs when there are bothmotor and vocal tics that have been present for more than a year. Up to 60percent of people who have Tourette’s also have ADD, and 40 to 50 percent ofpeople with Tourette’s have OCD. There is a significant connection between ADD,OCD, and Tourette’s. History of Physical, Emotional, or Sexual Abuse: Abuse in any form can causelearning and behavior problems. Certainly they can also occur together. Manyclinicians see an increased incidence of abuse occurring in families with ADD.The increased level of frustration, impulse control problems, and anger found inADD families causes them to be more at risk. An accurate, detailed history isnecessary to distinguish between abuse and ADD. People who have been abusedpresent more clearly symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such asnightmares, fearfulness, a tendency to startle easily, flashbacks, feelings ofnumbness or emotional restriction. Yet, many people who have ADD feel they havea form of PTSD from the chronic dysfunction they have experienced. Medical Factors: Medical factors also need to be considered in fully evaluatingADD: * Gestational problems, such as maternal alcohol or drug use during pregnancy * Birth traumas, such as oxygen deprivation or injury * History of head trauma * Seizure disorders * Physical illness/disease, such as thyroid disease or lead exposure * Severe allergies to environmental toxins or food * Medications, such as asthma medications.Learning/Developmental Problems: Learning disabilities occur in approximately 40percent of people with ADD. Suspect the diagnosis of a learning disabilitywhenever there is long-standing underachievement in school or at work. Medicalevaluation and history, family and school history, and clinical observation bestevaluate these disabilities. The diagnosis is confirmed by “psychoeducational”testing.Psychoeducational testing evaluates three areas: 1. IQ and cognitive style (look for discrepancies between verbal and performance scores) 2. level of academic skill (standard achievement tests) 3. evidence of a specific learning disabilities or problems (with tests such as the Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery).TREATMENT FOR LEARNING DISABILITIESThe specific treatments for learning disabilities are beyond the scope of thebook. When they occur, it is important for the school system to assist with anassessment for special services or special education to evaluate the need foralternative learning strategies and academic accommodations.ADD THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLESince ADD is best diagnosed through history over a long period of time, it iscritical to understand the developmental course of ADD. Here’s a look at ADDthroughout the life cycle. It is important to note that ADD does not just appearin the teenage years or in adulthood. When you know what to look for, you cansee that ADD symptoms have been present for most of a person’s life.Many ADD children are noted to be overly active in the womb. One mother told methat her unborn child kicked her so hard during the eighth month of pregnancythat he broke her ninth rib. (I wonder what that did for bonding!) Many are alsodifficult from birth: Many are colicky, fussy eaters, have a difficult timebeing comforted, are sensitive to noise and touch, and have eating and sleepingdifficulties. As toddlers, they’re often excessively active, mischievous,demanding, difficult to toilet train, and noncompliant with parental requests(like the terrible twos continued).Most ADD children are not recognized as such until they go to school: Inkindergarten or in first or second grade, schoolteachers often notice thedifference between these children and others. Teachers have a large database ofexpected behavior, while many parents do not.By the time they have entered school, hyperactive boys’ problems withaggression, defiance, and oppositional behavior have often emerged. Theseproblems often lead to social isolation and poor self-esteem.The majority of ADD kids have varying degrees of poor school performance relatedto failure to finish assigned tasks, disruptive behavior during class, and poorpeer relations. The time that these problems become apparent often relates tointelligence and the school setting. Often, the brighter the child, the later heor she is diagnosed. Up until that time, the child is likely to be labeled as anunderachiever, willful, defiant, or oppositional.As teenagers, current studies indicate that approximately 25–50 percent fullyoutgrow their symptoms by puberty. However, many do not outgrow their symptomsat puberty as previously thought, and they have difficulty with their family,school, and/or the community. The error occurred in part because most ADDchildren outgrow the hyperactive component before or at puberty. The problemswith inattention and impulsivity remain, and tens of thousands of teenagers aretaken off their medication just at a time when their defiant behavior is at itspeak. I have seen that many teens experience serious school and social failureafter the pediatrician or family doctor prematurely took them off theirmedication.There is a high incidence of conflicts in ADD families, especially during theteenage years. These conflicts often center around failure to do schoolwork,problems completing routine chores, and difficulty being trusted to obey therules. I have seen many teenagers sent away from home (to a residentialtreatment setting, boarding school, or relative’s house) as a way for the familyto survive the turmoil.Many adults with ADD live lives of chronic frustration. Psychiatrists Henry Mannand Stanley Greenspan wrote the first article on ADD in adults in 1977. Yet, themedical community was very slow to recognize ADD in adults. It has only beensince the late 1980s that professionals began talking about ADD beyond theadolescent years. Still, even now many professionals do not understand ADD inadults and often describe these people as having character problems, anxiety,depression, or even manic-depressive disorder. Their child ADD symptoms areassumed to have just melted away. Adults with ADD often come to our clinic withthe following concerns: * Concerns about a child with ADD. Most adults with ADD are only diagnosed after they bring their children in for evaluation. During a thorough history, the child psychiatrists ask about family history. Through these questions the light goes on for many people. Child psychiatrists are best at diagnosing this disorder, because they typically see a lot of children with ADD. * Poor school/work performance caused by the following symptoms: deficient sustained attention to reading, paperwork, etc.; high susceptibility to boredom by tedious material; poor organization and planning; procrastination until deadlines are imminent; restlessness, trouble staying in a confined space (not a phobia); impulsive decision-making; inability to work well independently; failure to listen carefully to directions; frequent impulsive job changes; poor academic grades for ability; frequent lateness for work/appointments; or a tendency to misplace things frequently. * Symptoms of trouble thinking clearly, generally poor self-discipline, moodiness, chronic anxiety, restlessness, substance abuse, uncontrolled anger, marital problems, sleep problems, financial problems, or impulsiveness.There is also no question in my mind that ADD exists in the elderly and that itseriously handicaps many of them. I have diagnosed many elderly people with ADD,mostly after I have seen their children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.My oldest patient, Betty, was 94 when she came to see me. I had seen threegenerations of people in her family: her son, grandson, and great-granddaughter.When I asked her why she wanted to be evaluated, she said that she wanted to beable to finish reading the paper in the morning. ADD symptoms in the elderlycause social isolation, difficult behavior, and a higher incidence of cognitiveproblems. For decades geriatric psychiatrists have used medications like Ritalinto help sharpen cognitive skills. Perhaps they were, in part, treating the veryhigh incidence of ADD in the elderly.WATCH FOR THE WALLMany bright children with ADD, especially Type 2 (Inattentive ADD), are notdiagnosed until later in their development, if at all. They do fine for a whileand then slam into failure: The Wall! Depending on intelligence, class size, andknowledge level of the parents, they may not have problems until third grade,sixth grade, ninth grade, or even college. I’ve treated some college professorswho received good grades in graduate school but still had the majority ofsymptoms of the disorder. They state, however, that it took them four or fivetimes the amount of time and effort to do as well as their peers.My son, whose greatest difficulties were in the ninth grade, actually gotstraight A’s in the sixth grade. He said, “In sixth grade, I knew everythingthat the teacher was talking about. It was easy. In ninth grade, I did not knowas much and I couldn’t bring myself to focus on all the material I needed tolearn.”The Wall is different for each person with ADD."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3LOOKING INTO THE ADD BRAINThe Development of SPECT Imaging in PsychiatryMy work on ADD started in an unlikely place: at a military hospital in themiddle of nowhere. The opportunities afforded me by the U.S. Army started me ona journey to explore the unorthodox concept of brain-imaging. I did mypsychiatric training at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) in Washington,D.C. I had been an infantry medic in the early 1970s and the GI Bill helped tosupport me through college and medical school. WRAMC was (and is) the premiermilitary hospital in the world. It is responsible for the medical care ofsoldiers, family members, and international political figures. After three yearsat WRAMC, I went to Honolulu, Hawaii, to do a child and adolescent psychiatryfellowship at Tripler Army Medical Center. Military training was very practical.Learning about combat psychiatry and taking care of soldiers and their familiesin times of crises did not leave one with the inclination to become married toany particular psychiatric dogma or tradition. We learned to use what worked,what was helpful, and what made a difference—right then and there.After my training I was stationed at Fort Irwin, forty miles north of Barstow,in the Mojave Desert. Halfway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Fort Irwin wasalso known as the National Training Center—the place where American soldierswere taught to fight the Russians (and later the Iraqis) in the desert. At thetime, I was the only psychiatrist for 4,000 soldiers and an equal number offamily members. It was considered an isolated assignment. There were problemswith domestic violence, drug abuse (especially amphetamine abuse), depression,and ailments resulting from the stress of living in the middle of nowhere. Idealt with many people who suffered from headaches, anxiety attacks, insomnia,and excessive muscle tension.Shortly after arriving at Fort Irwin, I went through the cabinets in thecommunity mental health clinic to see what instruments and psychological testsmy predecessors had left behind. To my delight, there was an old Autogenbiofeedback apparatus that measured hand temperature. There was one lecture onbiofeedback during my psychiatric training. The concept of biofeedback wasfascinating: If you get feedback on body measures, such as hand temperature orheart rate, you can learn to change them through mental exercise and discipline.The problem with biofeedback, as I knew it at that time, was that the trainingwas boring. The needles and dials on the machines were not interesting topatients. Nonetheless, the old machine was dusted off and we used it withpatients who had migraine headaches. I taught them how to warm their hands,using only their imagination. It was fascinating to see how patients couldactually warm their hand temperature, sometimes as much as 15 to 20 degrees.Hand-temperature training taught patients how to participate in their ownhealing process. In late 1987, six months after coming to Fort Irwin, I wrote arequest to Colonel Knowles, our hospital commander, to buy the mental healthclinic $30,000 worth of the latest computerized biofeedback equipment, includingten days of training for me in San Francisco. He laughed at me: He said that theArmy didn’t have the money and that when my assignment at Fort Irwin was over,the equipment would just end up in a closet somewhere, much like the equipment Ihad found. I dropped the idea but continued using the old temperature trainer.In May 1988, Colonel Knowles called me into his office. He asked if I had kept acopy of the biofeedback proposal. When I said yes, he authorized its funding. Inthe Army, if a unit does not spend its entire annual budget, they lose theunspent portion the next year. We had money left over, and the colonel wanted tomake sure he spent it all. I was very excited: Great new equipment, and ten daysin San Francisco!The biofeedback training course in San Francisco at the AppliedPsychophysiological Institute (API) changed my life. It was the most stimulatingand intense learning experience I had as a physician. The ten-hour days went byin a flash. The new computerized biofeedback equipment was patient-friendly,interesting, and easy to learn. I learned how to help people relax theirmuscles, warm their hands (much faster than with the old equipment), calmsweat-gland activity, lower blood pressure, slow their own heart rates, andbreathe in ways that promoted relaxation.The lectures on brainwave biofeedback were the most amazing. I was taught thatpeople could actually learn how to change their own brainwave patterns. What anexciting concept, being able to change your own mental state! I also learnedabout Dr. Joel Lubar’s research at the University of Tennessee on brainwaveunderactivity in children with ADD. In published research usingelectroencephalograms (EEGs), Dr. Lubar demonstrated that ADD children hadexcessive slow brainwave activity in the front part of their brain, whichworsened when they tried to concentrate. This diminished activity, when comparedto a group of people without ADD, made perfect sense to me. Psychostimulants,such as Dexedrine and Ritalin, were the treatment of choice for calminghyperactive children and helping them concentrate. I was taught that thesemedications exerted a “paradoxical effect”: a stimulant calming down ahyperactive child. Understanding Dr. Lubar’s research meant thatpsychostimulants probably corrected the underactivity in the ADD brain—not aparadoxical effect, but rather a direct effect: stimulating the brain’s frontallobe so that the brain could calm and focus the person.Dr. Lubar’s work gave me a critical insight: the importance of looking at thebrain in different thought states. He studied people with ADD at rest and whilethey were doing concentration tasks. After all, people with ADD have problemswhen they try to concentrate, not when they are at rest.Dr. Lubar also demonstrated that many children can develop more normal brainwavepatterns (and therefore improved focus and behavior) through brainwavebiofeedback. In brainwave biofeedback, electrodes are placed on the scalp andconnected to computerized biofeedback equipment. The computer screen shows thepatient his or her own moment-by-moment brainwave patterns. By knowing thesepatterns, many patients can learn to change them to more normal, more focusedpatterns. When I first heard this I was interested but very skeptical: How canyou change your brain? I started talking to other clinicians around the countrydoing this work who were getting exciting results. Why not change your brain?After all, if you can warm hand temperature by 20 degrees, why can’t youincrease the amount of focused brainwave activity?When I returned to Fort Irwin, I tried everything I learned. I did biofeedbackon almost all of the patients who came to see me. I loved it. My patients lovedit. I also spent time each day doing it myself. I became a master at breathingwith my diaphragm. I could slow my heart rate. And I could even warm my ownhands over 15 degrees whenever I felt stressed. I also started to evaluate ADDchildren with EEG measures. Many of them demonstrated the same patterns that Dr.Lubar had written about. Many of them benefited from biofeedback training. I hadto learn more.In 1989 my commitment to the U.S. Army ended and I started a private practice inFairfield, California. I bought my own biofeedback equipment and continued usingit in clinical practice. Also, I became the medical director of the dualdiagnosis unit (where patients had both substance abuse and psychiatricproblems) at a local psychiatric hospital. I instituted the use of biofeedbackthroughout the hospital. My interest in biofeedback and evaluating brainfunction in ADD patients grew each year. In late 1990 and early 1991 itexploded.In late 1990, Alan Zametkin, M.D., of the National Institutes of Healthpublished an article in the New England Journal of Medicine on brain PET(positron emission tomography) studies in ADD adults. PET studies aresophisticated nuclear medicine studies that evaluate glucose metabolism, bloodflow, and activity in the brain. His research showed that when ADD adultsconcentrate, there is decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex. There wasquite a buzz in the medical community. This meant that ADD was real: It is amedical problem you can actually see. For many people this was a profound shiftin thinking. I wasn’t quite as excited as many of my colleagues. Dr. Lubar hadvirtually said the same thing many years earlier, using EEG scalp measurements.But I was excited about the developing new technology to help study ourpatients. Shortly after Dr. Zametkin’s article appeared, I attended a lecture atthe hospital given by Jack Paldi, M.D., a nuclear medicine physician in ourcommunity. He opened my eyes to brain SPECT imaging.SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography), like PET, is a nuclearmedicine study that evaluates brain blood flow and activity patterns. Dr. Paldisaid that SPECT was easier to perform, less expensive, and involved lessradiation than PET studies. He showed SPECT images of patients with depression,dementia, schizophrenia, and head trauma. He showed brain images before andafter treatment. Unlike the PET researchers who felt that their technology wasstill very experimental, Dr. Paldi said that, in his opinion, SPECT was ready tobe used clinically and it could provide useful diagnostic information forpsychiatric patients. I was intrigued. When he offered physicians no-cost SPECTscans to try them out, I took him up on his offer. The same day of Dr. Paldi’slecture, I met Sally.Sally, a 40-year-old woman, had been hospitalized for depression, anxiety, andsuicidal ideas. In my clinical interview with her I discovered that she had manyADD symptoms, such as short attention span, distractibility, disorganization,and restlessness. She had an ADD son (a frequent tip in diagnosing ADD inadults). She had never finished college, despite having an IQ of 140, and shewas employed below her ability as a laboratory technician. Since I had justheard Dr. Paldi’s lecture and read Dr. Zametkin’s paper, I decided to order aSPECT study on Sally. I called the University of Wisconsin, known for researchin brain SPECT studies, and asked them how to perform the scans on an ADD adult.They gave us their protocol: a rest study, with the patient doing nothing, andthen two days later a concentration study done while the patient performs aseries of random math problems. Sally’s concentration study was abnormal. Atrest, she had good overall brain activity, especially in the prefrontal cortex.When she performed the math problems, she had marked decreased activity acrossher whole brain, especially in the prefrontal cortex! This correlated with Dr.Lubar’s EEG finding and Dr. Zametkin’s paper. With that information I placed heron low-dose methylphenidate (Ritalin). She had a wonderful response. Her moodwas better, she was less anxious, and she could concentrate for longer periodsof time. She eventually went back to school and finished her degree. No longerdid she think of herself as an underachiever, but rather as someone who needstreatment for a medical problem. After seeing the SPECT pictures she said,“Having ADD is not my fault. It’s a medical problem, just like someone who needsglasses.” Seeing the pictures was very powerful for Sally. Watching her facialexpression when she saw her own brain pictures led me to believe that SPECT mayhave a powerful application in decreasing the stigma many patients feel whenthey are diagnosed with “emotional, learning, or behavior problems.” It makesthem realize that these conditions are not just manifestations of a weak will orpoor conduct. The scan and her response to medication changed the perception shehad about herself.With Sally’s positive response to treatment fresh in my mind, I ordered moreSPECT studies, especially on my most difficult patients. I found SPECTimmediately useful in a number of different ways. I was able to “see” areas ofgood brain function and areas of compromised brain function. I could see areasof the brain that worked too hard and areas of the brain that did not work hardenough. I read everything I could on brain imaging, especially SPECT studies. Anumber of my colleagues at the hospital where I worked also ordered SPECTstudies on their patients. To my surprise, by early 1991 there was already avery large body of medical literature on SPECT imaging for neuropsychiatricindications.Sally’s SPECT Studiesimage [Images/page70.jpg]Underside surface of brain at rest (good prefrontal activity [arrows])image [Images/page70a.jpg]Underside surface view during concentration (marked dropoff of prefrontalactivity [arrows])At this point in the story it is important to understand a bit about SPECTtechnology. (I’ll try to make it as painless and interesting as possible.) SPECTis a sophisticated nuclear medicine study that looks directly at cerebral bloodflow and indirectly at brain activity (or metabolism). In this study, aradioactive isotope (which, as we will see, is akin to a beacon of energy orlight) is connected to a substance that is readily taken up by the cells in thebrain. A small amount of this compound is injected into the patient’s arm vein,from which it runs throughout the bloodstream and is taken up by certainreceptor sites in the brain. The patient then lies on a table for 14 to 16minutes while a SPECT “gamma” camera rotates slowly around his head. The camerahas special crystals that detect where the compound (signaled by theradioisotope acting like a beacon of light) has gone. A supercomputer thenreconstructs 3-D images of brain activity levels. The elegant brain snapshotsthat result give a sophisticated blood flow/metabolism brain map. With thesemaps, physicians have been able to identify certain patterns of brain activitythat correlate with psychiatric and neurological illnesses.SPECT studies belong to a branch of medicine called nuclear medicine. Nuclearmedicine uses radioactively tagged compounds (radiopharmaceuticals) that emitradiation in the form of gamma rays. The rays act like a beacon of energy orlight shining from each location they go to. We detect those gamma rays withfilm or special crystals and record an accumulation of the number of rays thathave been emitted in each area of the brain. The radioactive compounds areessentially tracking devices: They track the cells that are most active and havethe most blood flow and those cells that are least active and have the leastblood flow.Nuclear medicine studies measure the physiological functioning of the body andcan be used to diagnose a multitude of medical conditions: heart disease,certain forms of infection, the spread of cancer, and bone and thyroid disease.Brain SPECT studies help in the diagnosis of head trauma, dementia, atypical orunresponsive mood disorders, strokes, seizures, the impact of drug abuse onbrain function, complex forms of ADD, and atypical or unresponsive aggressivebehavior.During the late seventies and eighties, SPECT studies were being replaced inmany cases by the sophisticated anatomical CAT and later MRI studies. Theresolution of those studies was far superior to SPECT as far as seeing tumors,cysts, and blood clots. In fact, they nearly eliminated the use of SPECT studiesaltogether. Yet, despite their clarity, CAT scans and MRIs could offer onlyimages of a static brain and its anatomy; they gave little or no information onthe activity in a working brain. It was analogous to looking at the parts of acar’s engine without being able to turn it on. In the last decade it has becomeincreasingly recognized that many neurological and psychiatric disorders are notdisorders of the brain’s anatomy but problems in how it functions.Two technological advancements have encouraged the use, once again, of SPECTstudies. Initially the SPECT cameras were single-headed, and they took a longtime to scan a person’s brain—up to an hour. People had trouble holding stillthat long, and the images were fuzzy and hard to read (earning nuclear medicinethe nickname “unclear medicine”), and they did not give much information aboutthe functioning deep within the brain. Then multiheaded cameras were developedthat were able to image the brain much faster and with enhanced resolution. Theadvancement of computer technology also allowed for improved data acquisitionfrom the multi-headed systems. The brain SPECT studies of today, with theirhigher resolution, can see into the deeper areas of the brain with far greaterclarity and show what CAT scans and MRIs cannot: how the brain actuallyfunctions.SPECT studies can be displayed in a variety of different ways. Traditionally thebrain is examined in three different planes: horizontally (cut from top tobottom), coronally (cut from front to back), and sagittally (cut from side toside). What do physicians see when they look at a SPECT study? We examine it forsymmetry and activity levels indicated by shades of color (in different colorscales selected according to the physician’s preference, including gray scales)and compare it to what we know a normal brain looks like. The images thataccompany this book will be mostly two kinds of three-dimensional (3-D) imagesof the brain.One kind is a 3-D surface image, looking at the blood flow of the brain’scortical surface. These images are helpful for picking up cortical surface areasof good activity as well as underactive areas. They give insight into theeffects of strokes, brain trauma, drug abuse, etc. A normal 3-D surface scanshows good, full, symmetrical activity across the brain’s cortical surface.The other kind is a 3-D active brain image, which compares average brainactivity to the hottest 15 percent of activity. These images are helpful forpicking up areas of overactivity, as seen in active seizures,obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety problems, certain forms of depression,etc. A normal 3-D active scan shows increased activity (seen by the light color)in the back of the brain (the cerebellum and visual or occipital cortex) andaverage activity everywhere else (shown by the background grid).Normal 3-D Brain SPECT Studiesimage [Images/page73a.jpg]backfronttop-down surface viewimage [Images/page73b.jpg]topbottomfront-on surface viewimage [Images/page73c.jpg]frontbackunderside surface viewimage [Images/page73d.jpg]topfrontbottomside surface viewimage [Images/page73e.jpg]topfrontbottomside active viewimage [Images/page73f.jpg]backfronttop-down active viewimage [Images/page73g.jpg]topbottomfront-on active viewimage [Images/page73h.jpg]frontbackunderside active viewPhysicians are usually alerted that something is wrong in one of three ways: (a)they see too much activity in a certain area; (b) they see too little activityin a certain area; or (c) they see asymmetrical areas of activity, which oughtto be symmetrical.In the last four images the outline grid equals average activity in the brain,and the light color equals the most active 15 percent of the brain. The back isnormally the most active part of the brain.In addition, other SPECT studies were published on dementia, stroke, headtrauma, depression, schizophrenia, and drug abuse. In 1992, I went to theAmerican Psychiatric Association’s Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. To myexcitement I found another child psychiatrist, Thomas Jaeger from CreightonUniversity in Omaha, Nebraska, who had extensive experience with brain SPECTimaging. Dr. Jaeger and colleagues were presenting an all-day course on how toutilize brain SPECT imaging in child psychiatry. I was very excited. The day ofthe course, however, was my first sense that a storm was brewing in thebrain-imaging world. I went to hear a lecture by Dr. Zametkin, who had led thePET research on ADD in adults. After the lecture I went up to him and told himthat, partially based on his work, I was using brain imaging in my clinicalpractice and that I found it very helpful. He gave me an angry look and saidthat the imaging work was just for research: It wasn’t ready for clinical use,and we shouldn’t use it until much more was known about it. I protested, sayingthat it was immediately helpful. I had many cases in which it helped to directtherapy. He didn’t want to hear it. I told him about the all-day course by Dr.Jaeger and his group. He said that he should go “crash their party and set themstraight.” Internally, I was very upset. Little did I know that that moment wasthe beginning of five years of a very rocky personal road. Dr. Jaeger’s coursethat day, however, was wonderful. He showed all of the different ways SPECTcould be applied in a clinical setting: with ADD, depression, bipolar disorder,head trauma, drug abuse, etc. In the program abstract Dr. Jaeger wrote,“Regardless of the initial diagnosis, patients who underwent brain SPECT priorto, or during, psychiatric hospitalization had markedly shorter stays thancontrols. As demonstrated by this clinical database (2,000 patients), brainSPECT may lead to more effective, shorter, safer, and less expensive diagnosticand treatment modes in children and adolescents with suspected neuropsychiatricillness.”When I returned home from the meeting, another storm was brewing. A localpediatric neurologist had started to complain to hospital officials about ouruse of brain imaging for psychiatric patients. He had called three or fourresearchers around the country (not Dr. Jaeger or other people who were usingthe technology clinically) who said that SPECT was not ready to be usedclinically. There was a big meeting at the hospital. There was support by thehospital’s medical director to continue to utilize the technology, but there wasalso dissent. I remember the meeting as if it were yesterday. Now, rather thanbeing anxious, I was angry. “How can we not look at the brain?” I said.“Cardiologists look at the heart. Orthopedic doctors have bone X rays. We dealwith the most complex organ in the body. How can we treat it without having anyinformation on how it functions? We are the only medical specialists that neverlook at the organ we treat!” Even though we were allowed to continue orderingthe studies, there was now an approval process and a feeling of controversyrather than collaboration.By 1993, I had ordered several hundred SPECT studies on my patients, and Icontinued to find them helpful and fascinating. I started to lecture about thefindings. I was asked to give grand rounds at local hospitals and even at theUniversity of Colorado School of Medicine. I wrote a research article based onour findings with ADD children.We performed brain SPECT studies on fifty-four medication-free ADD children andadolescents. We compared this group to eighteen medication-free children andadolescents who did not have ADD. The studies were performed at rest and whilethe patients were doing a concentration task. Sixty-five percent of the ADDchildren and adolescents diagnosed with ADD had significant decreased activityin the prefrontal cortex when they tried to concentrate, compared to only 5percent of those who did not have ADD. Of the 19 ADD patients (34 percent) whodid not suppress their prefrontal lobe activity with concentration, 12 (63percent) had decreased prefrontal cortex activity at rest.Soon a year had passed. This time Dr. Jaeger asked me to help teach thebrain-imaging course at the 1993 American Psychiatric Meeting in San Francisco.That was the year the controversy became even more intense. When the programannouncement came out, months before the meeting, a SPECT researcher from Dallaswrote to APA’s program chairman asking how they could have such a controversialperson (me) on their program. He said that I made exaggerated claims about whatwe could read on a SPECT image and that they should take me off the program. Dr.Jaeger phoned me and asked me if I had somehow made this doctor mad at me. Itold him I didn’t even know who he was. The program chairman sat in on ourall-day course at the APA. Later he said he liked the course and didn’tunderstand what this doctor had been so upset about. What I was seeing in thebrain was real and changed the lives of many patients, but I was done withlecturing: I did not like the adversarial environment of those meetings anddecided to keep a low profile, expecting others would do the research. Then, inApril 1995, nine-year-old Andrew came into my clinic.Andrew is a very special child. He is my godson and nephew. When he was young hewas a happy, active child, but in the year and a half before he came to myclinic as a patient, his personality had changed. He appeared depressed. He hadserious aggressive outbursts and he complained to his mother of serious suicidaland homicidal thoughts (very abnormal for a 9-year-old). He drew pictures ofhimself hanging from a tree or shooting other children. When he attacked alittle girl on the baseball field for no particular reason, his mother called melate at night in tears. I told his mother to bring Andrew to see me the nextday. His parents drove to my clinic, which was eight hours from their home inSouthern California.As I sat with Andrew’s parents and then with Andrew, I knew something wasn’tright. I had never seen him look so angry or so sad. He had no explanations forhis behavior. He did not report any form of abuse. Other children were notbullying him. There was no family history of serious psychiatric illnesses. Hehad not sustained a recent head injury. And he had a wonderful family. Unlikemost clinical situations in which I do not know what really goes on in a family,this family I knew. Andrew’s parents were loving, caring, pleasant people. Whatwas the matter?The vast majority of my psychiatric colleagues would have placed Andrew on somesort of medication and had him see a counselor for psychotherapy. Havingperformed more than 1,000 SPECT studies by that time, I first wanted a pictureof Andrew’s brain. I wanted to know what we were dealing with. But with thehostility from my colleagues fresh in my mind, I told myself, Maybe this isreally due to a family problem that I just don’t know about. Maybe this is apsychological problem. (Incidentally, if you have good psychoanalytic training,you can find dirt in anybody’s family.) I thought, Maybe Andrew is acting outbecause his older brother is a “perfect” child who does well in school and isvery athletic. Maybe Andrew has these thoughts and behaviors to ward offfeelings of insecurity related to being the second son in a Lebanese family. (Ihad personal knowledge of this scenario.) Maybe Andrew wants to feel powerfuland these behaviors are associated with issues of control. Then logic took overmy brain. Nine-year-old children do not normally think about suicide.Nine-year-old children do not normally think about homicide. I needed to scanhis brain. If it was normal, then we could look further into the underlyingemotional problems that might be present.I went with Andrew to the imaging center and held his hand while he had thestudy performed. As his brain appeared on the computer screen, I thought amistake had been done in performing the procedure. Andrew had no left temporallobe. Upon quick examination of the complete study, I realized the quality ofthe scan was fine. He was indeed missing the function of his left temporal lobe.Did he have a cyst or a tumor? Had he had a stroke? I was scared for him as Ilooked at the monitor, but relieved that we had some explanation for hisaggressive behavior. My research and the research of others had implicated theleft temporal lobe in aggression. The next day Andrew had an MRI (an anatomicalbrain study), which showed a cyst (a fluid-filled sac) about the size of a golfball occupying the space where his left temporal lobe should have been. I knewthe cyst had to be removed. Getting someone to take this seriously provedfrustrating, however.That day I called Andrew’s pediatrician in Orange, California, and told him ofboth the clinical situation and the brain findings. I told him to find the bestperson possible to take this thing out of his head. He contacted three pediatricneurologists. All of them said that Andrew’s negative behavior was probably notin any way related to the cyst in his brain and they would not recommendoperating on him until he had real symptoms. When the pediatrician told me thisinformation, I became furious. Real symptoms! I had a child with homicidal andsuicidal thoughts who loses control over his behavior and attacks people! Icontacted a pediatric neurologist in San Francisco, who told me the same thing.I then called a friend of mine at Harvard Medical School, also a pediatricneurologist, who told me yet again the same thing. She even used the words “realsymptoms.” I said to her, “‘Real symptoms’! I have a child with homicidal andsuicidal thoughts who attacks people: What do you mean by ‘real symptoms’?” “Oh,Dr. Amen,” the neurologist replied, “when I say ‘real symptoms’ I mean problemslike seizures or speech problems.” Could the medical profession really notconnect the brain to behavior? I was angry and appalled! But I wasn’t going towait until this child killed himself or someone else. I called the pediatricneurosurgeon Horhay Lazarette, M.D., at UCLA and told him about Andrew. He toldme that he had operated on three other children with left temporal lobe cystswho were all aggressive. He wondered if it was related. Thankfully, afterevaluating Andrew, he agreed to take it out.Dr. Lazarette called me right after the surgery in April 1995. He said that hewas so glad that I had referred Andrew to him. The cyst had put so much pressureon Andrew’s brain that it had actually thinned the bone over his left temporallobe. If Andrew had been hit near that part of his head with modest force—with abasketball, for example—it would have killed him. He said the pressure from thecyst might have killed Andrew anyway within six months. When Andrew woke up fromthe surgery, his mother told me, he smiled at her. He had not smiled at her fora year. Immediately after the surgery, his aggressive thoughts were gone and histemperament changed back to the sweet child he always wanted to be. Now, sixyears later, Andrew remains nonviolent, happy, and well-adjusted.When I lecture and tell Andrew’s story, tears still come to my eyes, even thoughI have told it hundreds of times. I was in Hawaii with Andrew on vacation lastyear. When we were on a boat, getting ready to snorkel, Andrew looked at me andsaid, “Uncle Danny, why did I have the cyst and had to go through all thoseproblems?” Feeling a bit overwhelmed, I tenderly looked at Andrew and said,“We’ll never really know why, but I think a part of the reason was for me. WhenI was able to help you, it gave me the courage to tell the world about mybrain-imaging work without caring about all the people who criticized me. I haveto tell everyone I know about it.” He didn’t fully understand what I was sayingto him, but he accepted my response and we had a great time snorkeling.With Andrew’s experience in my mind, I found the inner strength to continue thework. There were too many children, teenagers, and adults like Andrew who hadclear brain abnormalities whom our society was just writing off as bad humanbeings or, worse, ignoring until they had suffered terrible problems or hurtthemselves or someone else. Only then would the medical community treat theseunfortunate people. In 1995, I completed the training to obtain my own licensein nuclear brain-imaging (which took 200 hours of nuclear physics and radiationsafety and 500 supervised hours of reading scans and interacting with patients)and incorporated SPECT imaging into operations of my clinic. As far as I knew, Iwas the only psychiatrist in the world who also had a brain-imaging component inhis practice.Andrew’s Missing Left Temporal Lobe (3-D Underside Surface View)image [Images/page80a.jpg]normal studyimage [Images/page80b.jpg]missing left temporal lobeimage [Images/page80c.jpg]two years later (Notice improvement in left temporal lobe activity.)The struggles, however, were certainly not over. In 1996, I was invited to givethe State-of-the-Art Lecture in Medicine to the Society of DevelopmentalPediatrics. The lecture generated a heated discussion. A pediatrician from theSan Francisco Bay Area stood up and criticized my work. He said people quoted meand my brain-imaging research as a justification to give ADD childrenmedication. I said that we give glasses to children who can’t see. If you cansee physical brain problems on SPECT with people who have ADD, doesn’t it makesense to treat it? Shortly after the meeting, someone—I suspect thispediatrician—anonymously reported me to the California Medical Board.In California, if you do anything in medical practice outside of the generallyaccepted standards of the community, you can have your licensed revoked. The lawis meant to protect the public, but it can also stifle innovation. What I wasdoing with brain SPECT imaging was certainly different from what my colleagueswere doing. For a year I answered questions, gave the medical board copies ofresearch articles, hired an attorney, and appeared at interviews. Many times Ifelt like running away. With Andrew in my heart, I was able to weather thatyear. I am thankful that the investigator for the medical board was anintelligent man who listened to the facts. The first board reviewer, apsychiatrist who had no experience with brain-imaging, said that my practice wasoutside the standard of care. He said that there was never an indication forbrain SPECT imaging. The investigator, who had done his homework, knew that thereviewer was wrong. He agreed to send my work to the departments of neurologyand nuclear medicine at UCLA. Several months later the investigator read me theletter from the results of the UCLA investigation of my work. They said I wasdoing good medicine. It was innovative and appropriate. They hoped that I wouldcontinue the work and continue to publish the findings. The investigation wasover. In fact today I am an expert reviewer for the California Medical Board.Only a few years later the criticism has seemed to come full circle. I havepresented the information in this book to thousands of medical and mental healthprofessionals across North America: in medical schools, at national medicalmeetings and even recently at the prestigious National Institutes of Health. Ihave published much of this research in medical book chapters and journalarticles. From 1997 to 1999, I published six peer-reviewed professional medicalarticles on brain SPECT imaging in psychiatry. I was honored by being asked tocoauthor the chapter on functional brain imaging in the Comprehensive Textbookof Psychiatry, one of the most respected psychiatric texts in the world. In thespring of 1999, I was invited by the nuclear medicine community to give lecturesat their meetings. Dr. Dennis Patton, the historian for the Society of NuclearMedicine, introduced me at one of the meetings by saying that I was a pioneer inthe brain-imaging field and that people would read my work for years to come. AsI write this book I believe I have personally seen more functional brain imagesfor behavioral reasons than any other living person. To date I have read about10,000 studies. My clinic gets referrals from approximately 350 physicians inthe Bay Area, around California, and the Western United States. This year alonemy clinic has seen patients from Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, West Africa,Lebanon, Israel, Australia, and Canada. The price I have personally had to payto do this work has been worth it many times over.BRAIN BASIC TENETSHere are some of the basic tenets my brain-imaging work has taught me ingeneral: * The brain is involved in everything you do, how you think, how you feel, how you act, and how well you get along with other people. * The brain even determines the kind of person you are—the kind of mother, doctor, receptionist, husband, daughter, student, etc. * When your brain works right, you work right. * When your brain doesn’t work right, it is very hard for you to be your best. * There are things we can do to hurt our brains, such as injuries, pollution (taking drugs, excessive caffeine, smoking, etc.), poor nutrition, and excessive stress. * There are things we can do to optimize our brain function, such as proper nutrition, protection, and coping with stress.Here are some examples of brain SPECT imaging. In order to appreciate thefunctional changes in ADD brains, it’s helpful to look at more dramatic examplesof brain dysfunction.Lawrence had a stroke, and since then, his speech has been affected, he hasproblems with depression, and he has trouble with short-term memory.Steven fell off a roof onto his head and fractured his skull. He was unconsciousfor several days. Since the accident, he has had problems with his temper,seizures, and impulse control.Kathy has Alzheimer’s disease. Over the last few years her memory has gottenprogressively worse. She gets lost easily and she says inappropriate things toher loved ones.Left-Sided Stroke (3-D Underside and Left-Side Surface Views)image [Images/page83a.jpg]undersideimage [Images/page83b.jpg]left sideHead Trauma (3-D Top-Down and Left-Side Surface Views)image [Images/page84a.jpg]top downimage [Images/page84b.jpg]left sideAlzheimer’s Disease (3-D Underside and Top-Down Surface Views)image [Images/page84c.jpg]undersideimage [Images/page84d.jpg]top downLaura had been abusing alcohol heavily for ten years. She now complained ofmemory problems and trouble learning new information.Due to my personal situation at home, throughout the brain-imaging work I havealways had a strong interest in ADD. Initially, as in Sally’s case, I thoughtthat ADD was primarily a problem of decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex.My 1993 study showed that 65 percent of ADD patients had decreased prefrontalcortex activity with concentration, but we soon saw other patterns, especiallyin our more complex patients. As our brain-imaging became better known acrossNorthern California, then California, the West and later internationally throughmy book Change Your Brain, Change Your Life (New York: Times Books, 1999), thevolume and complexity of our cases increased, as did our knowledge and databaseof scans. We found that there were a number of different brain systems involved.Here is a brief summary of the brain-imaging findings and symptoms for thedifferent types of ADD that I saw. I will devote a chapter to each type withseveral examples for each.Alcohol Abuse (3-D Underside and Top-Down Surface Views)image [Images/page85a.jpg]undersideimage [Images/page85b.jpg]top downTYPE 1: CLASSIC ADDSPECT findings: a normal resting brain. During concentration, decreased activityin the underside and lateral prefrontal cortex with concentration.Primary symptoms: inattentive, distractible, disorganized, hyperactive,restless, and impulsive.This is the easiest pattern to spot. Almost all brain-imaging studies outside ofThe Amen Clinic have been done on this type of ADD. Clear prefrontal cortexdeactivation can be seen on the scans. This pattern tends to be seen much morefrequently in boys.TYPE 2: INATTENTIVE ADDSPECT findings: a normal resting brain. During concentration, a decreasedactivity in the lateral prefrontal cortex. Primary symptoms: inattentive,sluggish, slow-moving, low motivation, often bored; sufferers are oftendescribed as space cadets, daydreamers, couch potatoes.This pattern tends to be seen more in girls.TYPE 3: OVERFOCUSED ADDSPECT findings: At rest and during concentration there is increased activity inthe anterior cingulate gyrus. During concentration there is also decreasedactivity in the underside and lateral prefrontal cortex.Type 1: Classic ADD (3-D Underside Surface View at Rest and with Concentration)image [Images/page86a.jpg]at restimage [Images/87bb.jpg]with concentrationType 2: Inattentive ADD (3-D Underside Surface View at Rest and withConcentration)image [Images/page87a.jpg]at rest (full overall activity)image [Images/page87b.jpg]with concentration (decreased lateral prefrontal cortex)Primary symptoms: has trouble shifting attention; frequently gets stuck in loopsof negative thoughts or behaviors; obsessiveness; excessive worrying;inflexibility; frequent oppositional and argumentative behavior.This pattern tends to be seen more commonly in children and grandchildren ofalcoholics. For personal reasons, families with alcohol-abuse histories were myresearch interest during training. This is a pattern I discovered within myfirst year of doing SPECT imaging.TYPE 4: TEMPORAL LOBE ADDSPECT findings: At rest and during concentration there is decreased (andinfrequently increased) activity in the temporal lobes. During concentrationthere is also decreased activity in the underside and lateral prefrontal cortex.Primary symptoms: inattentiveness, irritability, aggressiveness, dark thoughts,mood instability, learning problems, inattention, and impulsivity.Type 3: Overfocused ADD (3-D Active Concentration View, Front On and Left Side)image [Images/page88a.jpg]front-on viewimage [Images/page88b.jpg]left-side viewType 4: Temporal Lobe ADD (3-D Underside Surface Concentration View)image [Images/page88c.jpg]underside viewA great number of my initial cases involved temporal lobe dysfunction. Early inmy imaging education, I discovered how important the temporal lobes are inpsychiatric illness, mood instability, violence, and learning disabilities.TYPE 5: LIMBIC ADDSPECT findings: At rest there is increased deep limbic activity (thalamus andhypothalamus) and decreased activity in the underside and lateral prefrontalcortex. During concentration there remains increased deep limbic activity anddecreased prefrontal cortex activity.Primary symptoms: inattentiveness, chronic low-grade depression, negativity,“glass-half-empty” syndrome, low energy, and frequent feelings of hopelessnessand worthlessness.Some people say that Limbic ADD is really a combination ofADD and depression. That may be so, but we see this combination very frequentlyin our ADD patients and it leads us to specific treatments that seem best forthis type.Type 5: Limbic ADD (3-D Underside Active Concentration View)image [Images/page89.jpg]underside viewTYPE 6: “RING OF FIRE” ADDSPECT findings: At rest and during concentration (often worse duringconcentration) there is patchy increased uptake across the cerebral cortex withfocal areas of increased activity, especially in the left and right parietallobes, left and right temporal lobes, and left and right prefrontal cortex. Inaddition there is often increased activity in the cingulate gyrus.Type 6: “Ring of Fire” ADD (3-D Top Down Active Concentration View)image [Images/page90.jpg]top-down viewPrimary symptoms: inattentiveness, extreme distractibility, anger,irritablility, oversensitivity, moodiness, hyperverbal, and extreme opposition.This is the last pattern I identified in my work. So many of our “reallydifficult cases” had this pattern in the brain. Initially, I did not have enoughexperience to see this pattern, but over time it became clear. One of the main reasons we have been so successful in both our clinical andbrain-imaging work is that they were done in concert, simultaneously, in aclinical setting. Being a neuroscientist who studied the brain as well as beinga psychiatrist responsible for patient care put me in a unique position tounderstand what I was seeing in the scans of my patients. They kept mesearching, asking questions, and looking for answers. The brain is truly thelast frontier."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4THE AMEN CLINIC ADD TYPE QUESTIONNAIREThe day-to-day use of functional brain-imaging in clinical practice is still,unfortunately, ten to fifteen years away. However, I have developed aninstrument that allows others to take advantage of the information we havelearned. Based on over 10,000 brain SPECT studies and over 15,000 patientevaluations, I have identified six different types of ADD. Through the years Ihave developed a clinical questionnaire to evaluate these ADD types without theuse of functional brain-imaging. The Amen Clinic ADD Type Questionnaire is a71-question self-test that evaluates the ADD syndrome and its six major types.This questionnaire has gone through many revisions, and while I’m sure it willgo through more as we continue, it correlates remarkably well with SPECTimaging. We use this questionnaire as part of our evaluation at The Amen Clinic.Self-report questionnaires have certain advantages and limitations. They arequick, inexpensive, and easy to score. One of the dangers is that people mayfill them out as they want to be perceived. For example, some people mark,inaccurately, all of the symptoms as occurring frequently, in essence saying,“I’m glad to have a problem so that I can get help, be sick, or have an excusefor the problems I have.” Some people are in total denial: They do not want tosee any personal flaws and they do not check any symptoms as problematic,saying, “I’m okay. There’s nothing wrong with me. Leave me alone.” In ourclinical experience, most people gauge themselves with reasonable accuracy.Self-report bias is one of the reasons that it is important to have anotherperson fill out the questionnaire as well. This will give you and others a morecomplete picture.This questionnaire is an invaluable tool to determine if ADD exists and, if so,which type. It provides the basis for specific effective treatment planning.It’s not unheard-of to score as displaying several different types of ADD. Aperson may have more than one, and some people have three or four types.It’s important to note that this (or any) questionnaire is never meant to beused alone. It is not meant to provide a diagnosis.

This type of ADD is usuallyevident early in life. As babies, Type 1 sufferers tend to be colicky, veryactive, and they are hard to soothe and hold (they wiggle a lot). They have lesseye contact than other children their age and parents have a more difficult timebonding with these children. It is hard to bond with a child who is in constantmotion, who struggles to get away when you try to hold her. The hyperactivityand conflict-driven behavior usually gets everyone’s attention early. Thechildren are restless, in constant motion, noisy, talkative, and demanding. Theyalso seem to need constant excitement or to see someone get upset. In addition,many of the inattentive symptoms are present as well. These ADD children areusually the first ones to be diagnosed, because they bring a lot of negativeattention to themselves. These children are hard to be around, especially forpeople who are sensitive to noise. Parents of hyperactive children frequentlyfeel tired, embarrassed, angry, and overwhelmed. As a group, Type 1 ADDindividuals have low self-esteem. Due to the hyperactivity, conflict-drivenbehavior, and impulsivity these children, teens, and adults are in trouble withsomeone nearly every day of their lives. The brain SPECT findings in Type 1 shownormal brain activity at rest and decreased activity, especially in theprefrontal cortex (pfc), during a concentration task.Here are four typical examples of Type 1 ADD (covering ages throughout thelifespan).JoeyMrs. Wilson brought Joey to see me when he was 7 years old. He had just repeatedfirst grade. Since preschool, teachers had mentioned problems with Joey. Theysaid he was restless, fidgety, impulsive, and unable to stay focused unless hewas really interested. The school had tested his intelligence, which was highnormal, and they tested his hearing and vision—also normal. Mrs. Wilson thoughtthat the teachers weren’t skilled enough to manage him, but she had to admit shewas frequently frustrated with him at home. Ten minutes of homework would takehim an hour of unfocused time. He started fights with his older brother and hehad to be told to do things over and over. His bedroom was a perpetual mess,even right after it was picked up. He needed extra supervision, and dinnertimeupset everyone because he wouldn’t sit still long enough to eat. Joey hadtrouble getting to sleep at night because of his restlessness, and he was hardto get up in the morning. Mrs. Wilson said she had stopped taking him shoppingwith her because it was too much. Even at the age of seven, he would not stayclose, he touched everything, and he asked for treats repeatedly. “He just hasno impulse control,” she told me. Mrs. Wilson had brought Joey to thepediatrician when he was four years old because of his hyperactivity, but thedoctor said he would probably outgrow it in a year or two.During the evaluation in my clinic, Joey was all over the place. He took booksoff my bookshelves and played with items on my desk without permission. He wasin constant motion. His mother appeared upset by his behavior and constantmotion. I gave him a computerized test of attention (Conner’s CPT), which hescored very poorly on. He had a very impulsive, fast approach to the test. Idiagnosed Joey with Type 1 ADD and spoke to Mrs. Wilson about treatment options.A SPECT series was performed to gather the most information possible beforetreatment.We often do two SPECT studies for ADD and learning disabilities: one at rest andone a day or two later during a concentration task. We have found that ADD isnot a disorder of a resting brain—people with ADD can rest just fine—butproblems show up during a concentration task. The concentration test is similarto a heart stress test. Physicians often order an electrocardiogram (EKG) to geta baseline look at heart function, but if there are heart problems, physiciansfrequently order a stress EKG done while the person is exercising to bring outthe most problems or vulnerabilities. I believe it is essential to doconcentration or stress SPECT tests as well.At rest, Joey’s SPECT study showed good, full, symmetrical activity throughouthis brain. Two days later, when he tried to concentrate, his SPECT test showedmarked decreased activity in the underside of the prefrontal cortex. Typically,in our non-ADD group, when people try to concentrate they get increased activityin this part of the brain: Their brains help them focus by turning on the partof the brain that is largely responsible for focus and follow-through. Joey’sbrain, however, betrayed him. When he tried to concentrate, his prefrontalcortex shut down rather than on. As part of a research project, a third studywas done with concentration on Adderall. Adderall significantly enhancedprefrontal cortex activity, allowing Joey to have access to the part of hisbrain that helps him with focus, follow-through, and impulse control.Joey’s SPECT Series: Rest, Concentration, and Concentration with Adderall(Underside Surface View)image [Images/page104a.jpg]at rest (good overall activity)image [Images/page104b.jpg]with concentration, no medication (decreased pfc and temporal lobe activity)image [Images/page104c.jpg]with concentration with Adderall (overall improved activity)With a low dose of Adderall, a higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate diet, andregular exercise, Joey had a nice response to treatment. He was more focused,more settled, and over the years, much more successful in school.JoshuaSixteen-year-old Joshua found himself in the vice-principal’s office. He made anoff-color comment in history class and refused to go the office when he was toldto go by the teacher. A scene between Joshua and the history teacher ensued. Asmall, thoughtless comment turned into a big deal. He and his parents had tomeet with the vice-principal, Larry. Fortunately, Larry’s wife was a familycounselor who was expert in ADD. Rather than lecture Joshua, he asked theparents questions and he took the time really to listen to their answers. Joshuahad been diagnosed with ADD when he was 6 years old. Despite being a brightchild, he had always been impulsive, restless, inattentive, and disorganized. Hehad been on Ritalin as a child, which helped his school performance andbehavior. The parents and pediatrician took him off Ritalin at age 11. Theythought everyone outgrew ADD by puberty, and Joshua was not as hyperactive as heonce had been. Thinking back on it, his parents said that after fifth grade hisschool performance deteriorated and he definitely got into more trouble. Larryrelated to the family that many people with ADD never outgrow the disorder. IfJoshua still had problems with impulsivity (obviously), inattention (the mothersaid homework took him all night to do), and restlessness (he still had troublesitting still), then he needed another evaluation. Larry recommended the familyto my clinic.We see many, many teenagers like Joshua. As part of the evaluation he had abrain SPECT series, which showed normal activity at rest and markedly decreasedactivity in the prefrontal cortex during concentration.Showing Joshua and the family the SPECT study was very helpful. Joshua could seethat ADD is not some imaginary illness, not an excuse: It is a medical problemthat needs treatment. He needed treatment just as someone needs glasses if theyhave problems seeing. When we were looking at the study, I asked Joshua if heever woke up and planned to have problem behavior. Joshua’s eyes looked down. Hesaid, “No. I never want to get into trouble. I just say stupid things withoutthinking.” I responded that he needed a better internal supervisor. I explainedhow the prefrontal cortex helps us think about what we say or do before we saysomething or do something. His prefrontal cortex needed help. I then showed himsome before-and after-treatment SPECT images. His attitude was very positive. Hewanted the best brain he could get. His initial treatment consisted ofmedication, a higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate diet, and intense exercise.With the help of treatment Joshua did very well. In the beginning he was veryconsistent with his medication, but less consistent with the diet and exercise.When he turned 18 he decided to go into the U.S. Air Force, which had been hislifelong dream. The Air Force, however, would not take Joshua while he wastaking medication. He had to be off medication for at least a year. He told methat he really wanted to go off his medication so that he could go into themilitary. Having a lot of experience with this scenario, I told him he had threechoices: He could forget about the military and stay on his medication; he couldgo off his medication and work hard on natural treatments; or he could just gooff his medication, go into the military, and take his chances, but the oddswere that the ADD symptoms would get him into trouble. He agreed to work hard atthe natural treatments. He exercised intensely for thirty minutes every day. Heate better, eliminating sugar and simple carbohydrates, such as pasta, bread,potatoes, and rice. And he took 1,000 milligrams of L-tyrosine twice a day. Hedid very well on this combination and entered the Air Force a year later.GloriaI met Gloria (45 years old) when she brought her 21-year-old son to our clinic.He was having trouble in college. During the evaluation we had the parents fillout ADD questionnaires on themselves. Gloria scored very high on herquestionnaire. She decided to make an appointment for herself. All of her lifeshe had felt stupid. Even though she ended up finishing college, she was labeleda slow learner in elementary and junior high school. She felt that she had totry harder than everyone else. She needed more time to do her homework than herfriends did. She often didn’t go out on weekends because she was overloaded withschoolwork. Even now, chores around the house took her longer than she (or herhusband) thought they should. Gloria complained of a long-standing sense ofanxiety and restlessness. She did not go to movies. “I can’t sit still for morethan fifteen minutes at a time. Getting up all the time and walking aroundirritates others,” she told me. She had problems with follow-through, and oftenhad to pay late fees on bills. Her husband complained that Gloria wasconflict-seeking. “Often I feel like she will just start problems,” he said. “Ifwe are having a nice day, she’ll start to pick at me or bring something up fromthe past to be upset about. I don’t think we have had a whole month in ourtwenty-five-year marriage without a fight.” In addition, Gloria wasdisorganized. She told me that her closets were a “disaster area.” “You have towear a hard hat when you go in them” was her husband’s comment. She was alsofrequently late.As part of a family study, both Gloria and her son were scanned. They showed asimilar SPECT pattern: healthy brain activity at rest, but poor activity in theprefrontal cortex during concentration.Gloria had a nice response to treatment. She said her energy was better. Shefelt more focused and more effective in her day-to-day life. Her anxiety levelsettled down and she was able to sit through movies without having to get up,missing part of the plot. Her husband said that she was more relaxed, lessnegative, and less oppositional.GeorgeEighty-seven-year-old George made an appointment at our clinic after he saw theimprovement in his great-grandson after treatment. He told me that his grandsonwas just as he himself had been when growing up. He had made too many mistakesin life and wanted to understand why. He also wanted to be able to concentratebetter. He said, “I want to be able to read a book. I have never finished a bookeven though I like to read.” George’s family was thrilled when he agreed to anappointment. He had always been difficult. He never sat through a meal, gettingup and sitting down several times. He frequently said impulsive things that hurtother people’s feelings. No one wanted to go out to a restaurant with George.Invariably he would say something awful to the waitress about the service or thefood and embarrass everyone. As part of a four-generational family study, Iordered a SPECT study on George. His study showed normal brain activity at restwith decreased prefrontal cortex activity during concentration. With a low doseof medication (Adderall), a change in his diet, and increased exercise, Georgefelt like a new man. He told me a month later, “I have better energy. I’m morethoughtful and don’t upset my family by saying stupid things. My memory appearsbetter, and I can concentrate for the first time in my life. I finished threebooks this month!” Now six months later, George’s family wants to spend moretime with him. His grandson, also my patient, told me that Grandpa was easier tobe around and that people were not on pins and needles anymore if they went outwith him.THE BRAIN AND TYPE 1 ADDIt appears that Type 1 ADD is caused by a relative deficiency of theneurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical heavily involved withattention span, focus, follow-through, and motivation. When its availability inthe brain is low, people tend to struggle with Classic ADD symptoms. Too muchdopamine causes people to get overfocused or stuck in negative thought patternsor behaviors. The stimulant medications appear to work by enhancing dopamineavailability in the brain. Physician and brain-imaging researcher Nora Volkowfrom Brookhaven Laboratory in New York State studied the effects ofmethylphenidate and cocaine on the brain. She injected these substances taggedto a radioactive isotope and watched where they worked in the brain. Bothmethylphenidate and cocaine worked in the same area of the brain: the head ofthe caudate nucleus in the basal ganglia (a structure deep in the brain). Thisis the same area found to be underactive in a number of ADD studies and may beone of the reasons many ADD adults abuse cocaine and methamphetamines. Dr.Volkow concluded in her study that the reason cocaine is addictive andmethylphenidate is not is that cocaine is taken up very quickly in the basalganglia, has a much more powerful effect in releasing dopamine (a highsensation), and is gone quickly (leading to withdrawal). Methylphenidate, on theother hand, is taken up much more slowly, has a weaker effect, and stays aroundlonger (no withdrawal).Gloria’s SPECT Studies (Underside Surface Views)image [Images/page109a.jpg]Rest (good overall activity)image [Images/page109b.jpg]Concentration (decreased prefrontal cortex activity)Gloria’s Son’s SPECT Studies (Underside Surface Views)image [Images/page109c.jpg]no meds (overall decreased activity)image [Images/page109d.jpg]with Adderall (overall marked improved activity)George’s SPECT Series: Rest and Concentration (Underside Surface View)image [Images/page110a.jpg]at rest (good overall activity)image [Images/page110b.jpg]with concentration (decreased pfc and temporal lobe activity)The caudate nucleus appears to be an important brain structure in psychiatry,and is involved in motivation, attention shifting, and anxiety control. When itis overactive, people have a tendency to be overfocused or obsessive. When it isunderactive, people have trouble paying attention. There are many connectionsbetween the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex. When there is low basal gangliaactivity, there is not enough dopamine being produced to drive the prefrontalcortex. The result is primary ADD symptoms.All of the brain-imaging research on ADD outside of The Amen Clinic has been onType 1. The results consistently point to decreased prefrontal cortex activity,especially in the undersurface of the prefrontal cortex (often termed theinferior orbital prefrontal cortex) and the basal ganglia. Understanding how thekey brain structures work helps in appreciating the havoc they can cause whenthey don’t.THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX (PFC)Occupying the front third of the brain, underneath the forehead, the prefrontalcortex (pfc) is the most evolved part of the brain. It is divided into threesections: the dorsal lateral section (on the outside surface of the pfc), theinferior orbital section (on the front undersurface of the brain), and theanterior cingulate gyrus (which runs through the middle of the frontal lobes).The anterior cingulate gyrus, often considered part of the limbic system, isassociated with shifting attention and is often involved with Type 3(Overfocused) ADD. The dorsal lateral and inferior orbital pfc go by the term“executive control center” of the brain.Overall, the pfc is the part of the brain that watches, supervises, guides,directs, and focuses your behavior. It contains “executive functions”: timemanagement, judgment, impulse control, planning, organization, and criticalthinking. Our ability as a species to think, plan ahead, use time wisely, andcommunicate with others is heavily influenced by this part of the brain. The pfcis responsible for behaviors that are necessary for you to act appropriately,focus on goals, maintain social responsibility, and be effective.The pfc—especially the inferior orbital pfc—helps you think about what you sayor do before you say or do it. It enables you, in accordance with yourexperience, to select actions among alternatives in social and work situations.The Prefrontal Corteximage [Images/page112a.jpg]dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (outside view)image [Images/page112b.jpg]inferior orbital prefrontal cortex (outside view)image [Images/page112c.jpg]3-D side surface view (dorsal lateral prefrontal area)image [Images/page112d.jpg]inferior orbital prefrontal area (inside view)image [Images/page112e.jpg]3-D underside surface view (inferior orbital prefrontal area)image [Images/page112f.jpg]3-D top-down surface view (prefrontal area)The pfc (especially the dorsal lateral pfc) is also involved with sustainingattention span. It trains your mind to focus on important information whilefiltering out less significant thoughts and sensations. Attention span isrequired for short-term memory and learning. The pfc, through its manyconnections within the brain, keeps you on task and allows you to stay with aproject until it is finished. The pfc accomplishes this by sending quietingsignals to the limbic and sensory parts of the brain. In the face of a need tofocus, the pfc decreases the distracting input from other brain areas,inhibiting rivals for our attention. However, when the pfc is underactive, lessof a filtering mechanism is available and distractibility becomes common.The pfc—especially the dorsal lateral pfc—enables you to feel and expressemotions: to feel happiness, sadness, joy, and love. Distinct from the moreprimitive limbic system (responsible for mood and libido) the prefrontal cortextranslates the feelings of the limbic system into what we think of as higheremotions, such as love, passion, or hate. Underactivity or damage in the pfcoften leads to a decreased ability to express thoughts and feelings.Thoughtfulness and impulse control are also heavily influenced by the pfc. Theability to think through the consequences of behavior is essential to everyaspect of human life. Without forethought, it would be awfully difficult tochoose a good mate, interact with customers, deal with difficult children, spendmoney, or drive on the freeway. In all of those kinds of situations, consistent,thoughtful action and inhibition of impulse behavior hold the keys to success.Within the pfc as a whole, problems in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortexoften lead to decreased attention span, distractibility, impaired short-termmemory, decreased mental speed, apathy, and decreased verbal expression.Problems in the inferior orbital cortex often lead to poor impulse control, moodcontrol problems (due to its connections with the limbic system), decreasedsocial skills, and impaired control over behavior.Test anxiety, along with social anxiety, also may be hallmarks of problems inthe pfc. Situations that require concentration, impulse control, and quickreactions are often hampered by pfc problems. Tests require concentration andthe retrieval of information. Many people with pfc problems experiencedifficulties in test situations because they have trouble activating this partof the brain under stress, even if they have adequately prepared for the test.In a similar way, social situations require concentration, impulse control, anddealing with uncertainty. Pfc deactivation often causes a person’s mind to “goblank” in conversation, which leads to being uncomfortable in social situations.Problems in the pfc lead to the organization of daily life spiraling into chaoswhile internal supervision goes awry. People with pfc problems exhibit problemswith impulse control, doing things they later regret. They also experienceimpaired attention span, distractibility, procrastination, poor judgment, anddifficulty expressing themselves.When men have problems in this part of the brain, their emotions are oftenunavailable to them and their partners complain that they do not share theirfeelings. This can cause serious problems in a relationship because of how otherpeople interpret the lack of expression of feeling. Many women, for example,blame their male partners for being cold or unfeeling, when it is really aproblem in the pfc that causes a lack of being “tuned in” to the feelings of themoment.The basal ganglia are a set of large structures toward the center of the brain.Involved with integrating feelings, thoughts, and movement, they also help shiftand smooth motor behavior. In our clinic we have noticed that the basal gangliaare involved with setting the body’s idling and anxiety levels and modulatingmotivation. The basal ganglia tend to be underactive in Classic ADD.The integration of feelings, thoughts, and movement occur in the basal ganglia.This is why you jump when you’re excited, tremble when you’re nervous, freezewhen you are scared, and get tongue-tied when the boss is chewing you out. Thebasal ganglia allow for a smooth integration of emotions, thoughts, and physicalmovement. When there is too much input, they tend to lock up and do not allow asmooth transition. When the basal ganglia are overactive (as we have seen in thecase of people with anxiety tendencies or disorders), people are more likely tobecome immobile (in thoughts or actions) in stressful situations and have atendency to freeze up. When the basal ganglia are underactive (as in this typeof ADD), a stressful situation often moves a person to action. People with ADDare frequently the first ones on the scene of an accident. They respond tostressful situations without fear. I know, for example, that one of my friendswho has Type 1 ADD is a lot quicker at responding to crises than I am. (I havenaturally overactive basal ganglia.)The Basal Ganglia Systemimage [Images/page115.jpg]3-D underside active viewShifting and smoothing fine motor behavior is another basal ganglia function andis essential to handwriting and motor coordination. Many children and adults whohave ADD have very poor handwriting. Their writing often looks choppy or sloppy.In fact, many teens and adults with ADD print rather than write in cursive. Theyfind printing easier because it is not a smooth motor movement but rather astart-and-stop motor activity. Many people with ADD also complain that they havetrouble getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, a conditioncalled finger agnosia. We know that the medications that help this type of ADD,such as the psychostimulants Adderall, Ritalin, and Dexedrine, work by enhancingthe production of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia. It isoften amazing how these medications improve handwriting and enhance a person’sability to get their thoughts out on paper in an easier way. In addition, manypeople with ADD say that their overall motor coordination is improved with thesemedications.Reversing the low pfc and basal ganglia activity in Type 1 ADD is thetherapeutic goal. We’ll learn more about that later."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6TYPE 2: INATTENTIVE ADD--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The sufferer:Is easily distractedHas difficulty sustaining his or her attention span for most tasks in play,school, or workHas trouble listening when others are talkingHas difficulty following through (procrastination) on tasks or instructionsHas difficulty keeping an organized area (room, desk, book bag, filing cabinet,locker, etc.)Has trouble with time, for example, frequently late or hurried, tasks takelonger than expected, projects or homework are “last minute” or turned in lateHas a tendency to lose thingsMakes careless mistakes, with poor attention to detailIs forgetfulDaydreams excessivelyComplains of being boredAppears apathetic or unmotivatedIs tired, sluggish, or slow-movingIs spacey or seems preoccupied.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The second most common type of ADD is Type 2: Inattentive ADD. Unfortunately,many of these people never get diagnosed. Instead they are labeled slow, lazy,spacey, or unmotivated. While Type 1 people bring negative attention tothemselves with their hyperactivity, constant chatter, and conflict-drivenbehavior, inattentive ADD folks tend to be quiet and distracted. Rather thancause problems in class, they are more likely to daydream or look out thewindow. They are not often impulsive and are less likely to blurt outinappropriate things. They are frequently thought of as couch potatoes who havetrouble finding interest or motivation in their lives. Girls seem to have thistype as much or more than boys.As in Type 1 (Classic) ADD, dopamine is generally considered theneurotransmitter involved in inattentive ADD—although, in this case, itsimbalance is felt by another area of the brain.Read the following four examples of Type 2 ADD. Seeing what these people wentthrough and how they were helped gives a clear picture of the nature ofinattentive ADD.SaraEight-year-old Sara was brought to our clinic by her mother and father. Theywere worried about her inability to pay attention. A few minutes of homeworkoften took her three to four hours, with her parents upset at her for taking solong. She appeared spacey, internally preoccupied, and generally in her ownworld. Her room was usually very messy. She had poor social skills and oftenignored children her own age whom her parents arranged to come over to the houseto be her playmates. Even though she did not have a defiant attitude at home,she often simply did not do what was asked of her. She said that she hadforgotten or didn’t hear the request. Her teacher said that she appeared to be asmart child but performed far below her potential. Her mind wandered in classand she had to be reminded to pay attention. She frequently made silly mistakeson tests and homework. Her handwriting was awful. Hearing and vision testschecked out normal, as did thyroid studies done by the pediatrician and testsfor learning disabilities done by the school psychologist. She had all thehallmarks of Type 2 Inattentive ADD, but the parents were hesitant to starttreatment, and wanted further evaluation. We did a SPECT study to evaluate herbrain function. Clinically she appeared to have Inattentive ADD. I certainlycould have started treatment without a SPECT study, but I honored the parents’request: If it had been my child, I, too, would have wanted to know how herbrain worked before I started treatment.Sara’s SPECT study showed marked decreased activity when she tried toconcentrate, especially in the prefrontal cortex. I prescribed a high-protein,low-carbohydrate diet (her diet before the evaluation had been almost entirelycarbohydrates), regular exercise, and a regimen of 500 mg of L-tyrosine twice aday. Sara’s schoolwork and behavior improved within the first week of startingthis regimen. Whenever Sara strayed from her treatment, she again becamespaced-out and inattentive.ChrisTen-year-old Chris was diagnosed as mentally retarded at age 6. He was a slowlearner and now read at only the first-grade level. After testing Chris, theschool psychologist said that he had only limited potential. His parents werevery upset with the prognosis given by the school psychologist because at homethey saw flashes of real intelligence. They also saw problems: For example, hisroom tended to be very disorganized, even though the parents tried to help him.Chris had a low energy level and frequently had to be called several timesbefore he would answer. A local neurologist ordered a brain MRI, EEG, and bloodtests, all of which were normal.Chris’s Concentration SPECT Study on and off Adderall (Underside Surface View)image [Images/page119a.jpg]with no medicationimage [Images/page119b.jpg]with AdderallA friend of Chris’s mother was a patient at our clinic and suggested that shehave Chris evaluated by us. Reviewing his tests, I saw that Chris had a low IQ,but also that the psychologist had noted that Chris had been very inattentiveduring the test. In talking to Chris, I found that I had to work hard to makeeye contact with him. He gave only limited answers to my questions and seemedeasily distracted by the things in my office. I ordered a SPECT study tounderstand how his brain worked. I believe that all children diagnosed withmental retardation need a functional brain-imaging study. Overall, Chris hadvery poor blood flow in his brain, especially in the prefrontal cortex. Iscanned him again on Adderall to see if it would have a positive effect. OnAdderall he had significantly more activity in his brain. Almost immediately theparents noticed a difference in Chris. He was more talkative, more energetic,and more responsive. The next year he picked up three grade levels in reading. Ayear later, IQ tests were redone and found to be in the normal range. Today,Chris is happy and performing well in school. Prior to treatment, Chris’s brainwas in darkness. Now, with treatment, the lights have been turned on: It was asif we had given a blind person sight.AllisonMy 18-year-old niece, Allison, is the kind of teenager whom most parents canonly dream about. She has always been sweet, responsible, easygoing, organized,and self-motivated. Yet, several years ago she began to appear stressed anddepressed. She was staying up to 1 or 2 o’clock every morning studying forclasses. She had trouble remembering what she studied and she frequently had toreread material because distracting thoughts would get her off track. As Ilearned about Allison’s problems I became concerned. Allison had never performedvery well in school, but she usually got B’s because of the great effort sheexpended. In fact, in the eighth grade she won a Presidential Scholar Award—notfor grades but for effort. Secretly her parents thought that she just wasn’t asintelligent as some of the other teens at her college prep school. They thought,however, that her diligence would help her be successful in life. When I talkedwith her at a family Christmas gathering, I saw a stressed-out teen at risk ofdepression.Allison had been part of my normal control group when we first started to doscans in 1990. Seeing her struggle, I had went back and looked at her priorscan. Compared to when I first looked at her brain with the experience of onlyabout 50 scans, I now had the experienced eyes of someone who had seen about5,000 studies. Her old scan looked very underactive. In fact, it looked as ifshe had had some toxic exposure. I then remembered that her mother had takenBendectin when she was pregnant with Allison. Bendectin was the antinauseamedication that was given to pregnant mothers who had severe morning sickness.Unfortunately for many, Allison included, Bendectin was found to cause learningproblems in some children and was pulled from the U.S. market. Over Christmasvacation in 1997, I asked Allison to get another SPECT study. Her SPECT studywas virtually identical to the one seven years earlier. It showed markedlydecreased activity overall, especially in the prefrontal and temporal lobes(areas involved with concentration and memory). With this information Irescanned Allison on Adderall. I wanted to see if a stimulant medication wouldhelp her brain activity. The follow-up scan was amazing. On one dose of 15milligrams of Adderall one hour before the next scan, her brain normalized: Itbecame much more active overall. The medication enhanced the activity in herprefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, giving her access to the parts of herbrain involved in concentration and memory, access she did not have prior to themedication. Allison’s learning struggles had nothing to do with herintelligence. The underactivity in her brain was limiting the access she had toher own memory and ability to concentrate. I told Allison that she would have torethink herself. Until then, she had felt that she wasn’t as smart as herfriends and that she would have to limit her goals. With this new informationand enhanced brain activity, who knew what she would be able to do? After theChristmas vacation, when she went back to school, she said that learning wasmuch easier. She started bringing home tests with A’s on them. When she went tobiology class, she said she understood concepts for the first time. Before theChristmas vacation they started discussing genetics, which she said was way overher head. After vacation, on her new treatment program, she said that thematerial was clear and easy to understand. Four months after her scans, she gotstraight A’s for the first time ever. She repeated the feat on her next threereport cards. She has a completely different perception of herself—one that fitsher reality of being smart, competent, and able to look forward to a brightfuture. She wants to be a geneticist.Allison’s Concentration SPECT Study Before and After Treatment with Adderall(Underside Surface View)image [Images/page122a.jpg]no medication (poor prefrontal and temporal lobe activity)image [Images/page122b.jpg]with Adderall (marked overall improvement)GaryGary, age 29, came to see me because he had trouble living independently. Hisparents were still supporting him. Despite his high intelligence, heunderachieved in school. Teachers said he didn’t care and needed to try harder.He appeared unmotivated, tired, and off in his own world. Even his girlfriendhad trouble getting his attention. Even though he worked at several odd jobs andwas good at carpentry, he did not make enough money to pay all of his bills.Employers fired him for being late to work or not coming back from lunch ontime. Gary’s father told him to “get his stuff together” or he would not helpGary anymore.Even though many people would call Gary lazy, I suspected a medical problem.Gary had symptoms consistent with Type 2 (Inattentive) ADD. Rather than beinghyperactive, he appeared underactive. He was spacey, easily distracted,inattentive, and lethargic. His brain SPECT study showed marked decreasedactivity in the prefrontal cortex when he tried to concentrate. I placed him ona low dose of stimulant medication (Adderall), a higher-protein,lower-carbohydrate diet, and regular, intense exercise. Over the next two yearshe was able to become more effective in his day-to-day life.JennaJenna, a 57-year-old artist, was referred to The Amen Clinic by herpsychiatrist. She complained of trouble concentrating, distractibility, “fuzzythinking,” disorganization, low energy, difficulty reading, and feelings of lifebeing overwhelming. Facing the day was frightening for her. She would becomefrozen and panicked by daily tasks, such as opening the mail. She has abeautiful house, but there were piles everywhere. Many of her friends said thatshe was “too creative” to be organized and focused. Her doctor had tried her ona small dose of Ritalin, which had a significant positive effect on hersymptoms. He wanted to send her for a second opinion and for brain-imagingstudies to clarify the diagnosis and better target treatment.Clinically, Jenna was diagnosed with Type 2 (Inattentive) ADD. Two SPECT studieswere performed as part of her workup. The first study, performed without anymedication, showed marked decreased activity, especially in her prefrontalcortex. The second study was performed several days later after she took a doseof Adderall. With medication there was significant overall improvementthroughout her whole brain, especially in the prefrontal cortex.On Adderall she feels much better. “I feel like I have access to much more of myown brain,” she told me, which indeed the SPECT study verified.Initially, Jenna was very afraid of medication. She wanted to deal with herproblems in a “natural” way. In fact, she had tried different diets, exercise,and meditation, with little effect. On medication, she feels more focused, andmore organized, with more consistent energy and more brain power. She stillexercises, eats right, and meditates to help keep her brain healthy. She hasasked me who the natural Jenna is, the one with the underactive brain, or theone with the normal-looking brain. My bias is that she is really herself whenher brain works right. Since our first visit in 1998, Jenna has referred most ofher family to me, because they struggle with very similar issues.Jenna’s Concentration SPECT Study on and off Adderall (Underside and Left-SideSurface Views)image [Images/page124a.jpg]image [Images/page124b.jpg]image [Images/page124c.jpg]no meds (overall decreased activity)image [Images/page124d.jpg]with Adderall (overall marked improved activity)Type 2 ADD is usually very responsive to treatment. As the case studiesillustrate, it is often possible to change the whole course of a person’s lifeif the disorder is properly diagnosed and treated."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7TYPE 3: OVERFOCUSED ADD--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The sufferer has ADD core symptoms, plus:Worries excessively or senselesslyIs oppositional and argumentativeHas a strong tendency to get locked into negative thoughts, having the samethought over and overHas a tendency toward compulsive behaviorsHas a tendency to hold grudgesHas trouble shifting attention from subject to subjectHas difficulties seeing options in situationsHas a tendency to hold on to his or her own opinion and not listen to othersHas a tendency to get locked into a course of action, whether or not it is goodfor him or herNeeds to have things done a certain way or becomes very upsetIs criticized by others for worrying too much.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In my experience Overfocused ADD is the third most common type of ADD.Overfocused ADD patients have all of the core ADD symptoms plus tremendoustrouble shifting attention and a tendency to get stuck or locked into negativethought patterns or behaviors. This type of ADD can have devastating effects onfamilies. It is frequently found in substance abusers and in children andgrandchildren of alcoholics.I discovered Overfocused ADD early in my brain-imaging work. Due to personalreasons, I did extensive research on children and grandchildren of alcoholicsduring my residency training years. When my brain-imaging work began, Idiscovered excessive activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus in many of thesepatients. The anterior cingulate gyrus is the brain’s gearshift. It allows aperson to shift from thought to thought or idea to idea. When it is overactive,people have a tendency to get stuck or locked into negative thoughts andbehaviors, and this was a common trait I discovered among the children andgrandchildren of alcoholics.At the time I started my brain-imaging work, there were several studies in thisfield that suggested that there was overactivity in the anterior cingulate gyrusin patients who had obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In 1991 a SPECT studyreported that Prozac decreased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus inpatients with OCD. I saw this same hyperactivity in the anterior cingulate gyrusin many patients who did not have OCD. But I noticed a common behavioral threadwith OCD patients. My patients with hyperactive anterior cyngulate gyri hadtrouble shifting attention: They would get locked or stuck in patterns ofthought or behavior, and there was a certain cognitive inflexibility evident inmany of their symptoms. This can give rise to many different symptoms, but theunderlying mechanism, trouble shifting attention, remains. The anteriorcingulate area of the brain is heavily innervated with serotonin neurons, and,as with OCD patients, we have also found that serotonergic medications seem tobe the most helpful in this disorder.TammyTammy was in fourth grade when she first came to our clinic. Tammy was astubborn child. If she did not get her way, she would throw mammoth tantrumsthat could go on for hours. In addition, Tammy was shy around other people,worried a lot, and was having problems in school. She would stare at her workfor long periods of time. She craved perfection in her schoolwork, and as aresult her papers showed evidence of many erasures. Tammy was distracted easilyand had trouble sitting still. While Tammy’s attention could easily be divertedfrom some things, she held on to hurts. If a friend said something she didn’tlike, her parents would hear about it for weeks. Another child psychiatristdiagnosed Tammy with ADD and put her on Ritalin. But the Ritalin aggravated her,making her moody, irritable, and even more anxious. Tammy’s brain scan showedthat her anterior cingulate gyrus was very overactive. It was clear from a brainbiology perspective that she had trouble shifting her attention. She needed acalmer cingulate if she was going to improve. Given her poor prior response tomedication, the parents and I initially decided to try an herbal approach totreatment. I placed her on St. John’s wort (a seratonin booster) and had herengage in a daily exercise program. In addition her parents had to learn to bevery firm and prevent her from arguing or opposing them. It took two months forall of the interventions to work together, but they had a significant positiveimpact on her behavior and academic ability.The Anterior Cingulate Gyrusimage [Images/page127a.jpg]cingulate gyrusimage [Images/page127b.jpg]3-D side active viewimage [Images/page127c.jpg]3-D top-down active viewimage [Images/page127d.jpg]3-D front-on active viewTammy’s Concentration SPECT Study (Top-Down Active View)image [Images/page128.jpg]MarkMark, 14 years old, was evaluated for anger outbursts and defiant behavior.Psychotherapy and parent training were ineffective. Dietary interventions didnothing. Depakote, Ritalin, Dexedrine, and Wellbutrin had no more success.Prozac made him more aggressive. We were all frustrated, including Mark. Hisparents were ready to send him away to a residential treatment center. Thestress on their family was just too much. I ordered a SPECT study. His SPECTstudy revealed marked hyperfrontality (his anterior cingulate gyrus and lateralprefrontal cortices were very overactive). Mark was unable to shift hisattention. He was unable not to be difficult. I placed him on Risperdal, one ofour new, novel antipsychotic medications. He was clearly not psychotic—he wasn’tdelusional or hallucinating—but we have found this class of medications helpfulfor this severe hyperfrontality. He had a dramatic response. He was morecompliant, happier, and no longer aggressive. One week after I started Mark onRisperdal, his mother came to my clinic, even though she didn’t have anappointment. As I walked into the waiting room to greet a patient, I saw her. Iwondered why she was there. I smiled at her and she immediately came over to me,grabbed me, and gave me a big hug. She said, “Thank you so much. I have my sonback. Mark is doing so much better!” I felt pretty good that day. As theimprovement held, I did two follow-up studies; one study was done a month later,the next one was six months later. There was a progressive calming of thehyperfrontality.Mark’s Concentration SPECT Studies, Before Treatment and at One and Six MonthsAfter Treatment with Risperdal (Top-Down Active View)image [Images/page129a.jpg]before treatment (note marked hyperfrontality)image [Images/page129b.jpg]one month later (mild decrease in hyperfrontality)image [Images/page129c.jpg]six months later (marked decrease in hyperfrontality)BrandonSixteen-year-old Brandon was one of the more difficult children I have treatedin my practice. He was negative, surly, argumentative, and oppositional, andwould throw long tantrums when he did not get his way. He did poorly in school.He would not cooperate with teachers, and he did not get along with otherstudents. The parents were at their wits’ end when they brought Brandon to seeme.Brandon was very opposed to seeing a psychiatrist. “I’m not crazy,” he announcedto his parents, “and I’m not going to talk to any shrink, so don’t waste yourmoney.” From the clinical history it was obvious to me that Brandon had anteriorcingulate problems. He held true to his word that he wouldn’t talk to me, so fora number of months I spent most of my time with Brandon’s parents. Brandonrefused to take medication and he was threatening to run away from home. Theparents and I felt that Brandon might need a residential treatment center wherehe could get intensive treatment over nine months to a year.Before I sent Brandon to treatment, however, I ordered a scan to evaluate hisbrain function and partly to help convince him of the biological need fortreatment. Surprisingly, Brandon agreed to the scan without his usual fuss. Hewas curious and had seen the brain images around our clinic. Brandon’s SPECTscan was one of the most abnormal studies that I had ever seen. His anteriorcingulate gyrus was on fire. His frontal lobes were completely overactive aswell. It looked as if he had three large racing stripes running down the middleof his prefrontal cortex.As I explained the SPECT results to Brandon, he actually seemed to listen to mefor the first time. He asked questions, seemed interested, and asked to see bothhealthy and dysfunctional brains. By the end of our appointment he had agreed totry some medication. He also agreed to exercise on a regular basis. The scanseemed to help him shift to a more open emotional place. I placed him on 20milligrams of Prozac. Three weeks later I had a follow-up appointment withBrandon. I walked to my waiting room, wondering what I would see. I was used tohaving bad interactions with Brandon. To my surprise Brandon stood up when hesaw me, shook my hand, and said, “It’s nice to see you again, Dr. Amen. How areyou?” My mouth dropped open. I thought to myself, Where is Brandon? Who isoccupying his body? Someone must have performed a brain transplant on him.Brandon and his parents came back to my office and told me that about a weekafter taking the Prozac, Brandon’s whole demeanor started to change. He woke upin a pleasant mood. He was more cooperative and even asked if he could helparound the house. The tantrums were gone and he was a joy to live with. Over thenext several months Brandon’s improvement held firm, but he was still havingtrouble focusing in school. At that point I added a very small dose of Adderall,a psychostimulant medication, to help him focus. It was the missing piece of thepuzzle and Brandon’s schoolwork improved as well.Brandon’s Concentration SPECT Study (Top-Down Active View)image [Images/page131.jpg]The first time I saw Brandon’s improvement, I wondered, “Who is he really?” Whatwas Brandon’s character? What was his soul really like? Over time I learned thatBrandon really was a charming, sweet young man who had been trapped inside thecircular hell of his brain’s inflamed anterior cingulate gyrus. When hisanterior cingulate gyrus and his brain worked right, Brandon was able to workright as well.SarahSarah, 28, was referred by her therapist because she had failed the bar exam sixtimes. Even though Sarah had graduated from law school, the therapist felt thatSarah had attention deficit disorder because she had trouble with attentionspan, was distractible, and had poor impulse control.Sarah had grown up in an alcoholic home. She struggled with periods ofdepression and obsessive thinking. Many of the people who knew her thought shewas selfish, because if things did not go Sarah’s way she would get angry. Shewas rigid, frequently argumentative (while she was growing up her parents toldher that she would make a good lawyer because of her tendency to argue), heldgrudges, and often worried about insignificant matters. Just before theevaluation, Sarah was nearly arrested for an incident on the freeway in whichshe chased down another driver who had accidentally cut her off. Whenever shetook traditional ADD medications, however, she got worse. She overfocused ontrivia and became more irritable. To my eye, Sarah had symptoms consistent withOverfocused ADD.I placed Sarah on Effexor, which is a stimulating antidepressant that increasesserotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine neurotransmitters. Sarah began to feelbetter within three weeks. She felt more focused, less worried, and morerelaxed. Her friends noticed that she was more flexible and didn’t always haveto have things her way.PhilAt the age of 67, Phil was an unhappy, lonely man. He had been divorced threetimes and his children did not talk to him. Even though he had been somewhatsuccessful in business, he didn’t enjoy his life. He was argumentative andnegative and worried excessively. He hated to be alone but tended to be rigid,oppositional, and unpleasant whenever he was around others. Anything that didnot go his way caused fierce outbursts. He came to see me after his grandson hadbeen helped in my clinic. I ordered two SPECT studies on Phil as part of afamily study we were doing. He had significant decreased activity in hisprefrontal cortex during concentration and marked increased cingulate activityon both studies. After seeing his scans and listening to his family history, itwas clear to me that Phil suffered from Type 3 ADD. He had a deficiency inserotonin and dopamine, causing the brain abnormalities in his prefrontal cortexand cingulate gyrus, which also caused his difficult behavior.I treated Phil with a combination of medication, dietary interventions, andexercise. It was wonderful to see the difference. Phil became more relaxed, morepositive, less argumentative, and more able to love. His children noticed thedifference within several weeks and started to enjoy being around him.GILLES DE LA TOURETTE’S SYNDROME (TS)TS is a tic disorder that is frequently associated with Type 3 (Overfocused)ADD. Characterized by both motor and vocal tics lasting more than a year, TSprovides the bridge between the basal ganglia and two seemingly oppositedisorders: ADD and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Motor tics areinvoluntary physical movements such as eye blinking, head jerking, shouldershrugging, and arm or leg jerking. Vocal tics typically involve makinginvoluntary noises such as coughing, puffing, blowing, barking, and sometimesswearing (corprolalia). TS runs in families and there have been several geneticabnormalities found in the dopamine family of genes. SPECT studies, by my clinicand others, have found abnormalities in the basal ganglia of the brains of TSpatients. There is a high association between TS and both ADD and OCD. It isestimated that 60 percent of people with TS have ADD and 50 percent of peoplewith TS have OCD. On the surface it would appear that these are oppositedisorders: People with ADD have trouble paying attention, while people with OCDpay too much attention to their negative thoughts (obsessions) or behaviors(compulsions). In looking further at both ADD and OCD patients clinically, Ihave found a high association of these diseases in the two groups’ familyhistories.DIFFERENTIATING TYPE 3 (OVERFOCUSED) ADD FROM OCD AND OCPDI am frequently asked how I differentiate people with this type of ADD frompeople who have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or obsessive compulsivepersonality disorder (OCPD). That is easy. All three groups have overfocusedtendencies (anterior cingulate issues), but people with Type 3 (Overfocused) ADDalso have long-standing core ADD symptoms: short attention span,distractibility, spotty organization, poor follow-through, and poor internalsupervision. People with OCD have clear obsessive thoughts and/or compulsivebehaviors, such as repetitively checking locks or hand washing. People with OCPDhave difficult personality traits—such as emotional rigidity, an “anal” need forsameness, the need to have their way, and compulsive cleanliness—but generallydo not have core ADD symptoms. In fact, they usually have the opposite of ADDsymptoms: They are overorganized, always on time, never say somethingimpulsively, and must follow through with every task."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8TYPE 4: TEMPORAL LOBE ADD--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The sufferer has ADD core symptoms, plus:Has periods of quick temper or rages with little provocationMisinterprets comments as negative when they are notHas a tendency to become increasingly irritable, then explode, then recede, andis often tired after a rageHas periods of spaciness or confusionHas periods of panic and/or fear for no specific reasonImagines visual changes, such as seeing shadows or objects changing shapeFrequent periods of déjà vu (feelings of being somewhere before even though heor she has never been there)Is sensitive or mildly paranoidExperiences headaches or abdominal pain of uncertain originHas history of a head injury or family history of violence or explosivenessHas dark thoughts, may involve suicidal or homicidal ideasHas periods of forgetfulness or memory problemsHas a short fuse or periods of extreme irritability.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Type 4 (Temporal Lobe) ADD is commonly associated with severe behavioralproblems. It is often seen in people with ADD who have problems with temper,mood instability, learning disabilities, and memory problems. Under your templesand behind your eyes, the temporal lobes seem to be responsible for moodstability, memory, learning, and temper control. People with Temporal Lobe ADDshow decreased activity in the temporal lobes, along with reduced blood flow tothe prefrontal cortex during concentration tasks. Associated with domesticviolence and suicide, this type of ADD can ruin a family. I saw this type of ADDearly in my brain-imaging work, especially with our most difficult patients, andI began to see a correlation with previous head injuries.KrisThe second brain SPECT study that I ever ordered was on Kris. By age 12, Krishad a long history of emotional outbursts, excessive activity level, shortattention span, impulsiveness, problems in school, untruthfulness, andaggressive behavior. These problems had not gone unnoticed. At age 6, Kris wasplaced on methylphenidate (Ritalin) for hyperactivity. It only made him moreaggressive and gave him visual hallucinations; it was stopped. After he attackeda boy at school when he was 8 years old, Kris was admitted to a psychiatrichospital in Alaska, where his father was stationed in the military. He was giventhe diagnosis of depression and started on the antidepressant desipramine(Norpramin). It didn’t help either. At the young age of 12, Kris and his parentshad already been through several years of largely ineffective psychotherapy witha psychiatrist/psychoanalyst.Kris’ behavior escalated to the point where he became more aggressive anduncontrollable at home. When he once again attacked another child at school hewas readmitted to a psychiatric hospital.I was on call the weekend Kris was admitted to the hospital. To connect with mypatients on the child psychiatry ward, I often played football with them. Thatday Kris was on my team. He cheated in every single play. When we were ondefense, in between plays he would move the ball three steps back and look at mewith an expression that said, “Are you going to yell at me like my mother does?”I decided not to yell at Kris but rather to scan his brain to get some clues asto why he acted the way he did. I refused to play his ADD game of “get the adultangry.” (See page 180.) Kris’s brain SPECT study was very abnormal at rest,showing marked decreased activity in the left temporal lobe. It was 40 percentless active than his right temporal lobe. On top of that, when Kris performedthe concentration task there was marked decreased activity in the prefrontalcortex.Given the temporal lobe problems, I placed Kris on the anticonvulsant medicationcarbamazepine (Carbatrol) as a way to normalize his temporal lobe. Within amonth he was a dramatically different child. He was more compliant, more social,and much more pleasant to be around. On the day he was discharged from thehospital, I was on call again. I gathered my patients and we played footballwith Kris once again on my team. He didn’t cheat. Insteadhe talked to me aboutwhat we were going to do in the game. His conflict-driven behavior had changedto something effective and goal-directed.Kris’s SPECT Picturesimage [Images/page137a.jpg]left-side surface view (arrow points to decreased activity in the left temporallobe)image [Images/page137b.jpg]underside surface view at rest (mild decreased prefrontal and left temporallobe)image [Images/page137c.jpg]underside surface view with concentration (marked decreased prefrontal and lefttemporal lobe)When Kris went back to school, his behavior was much better but he stillstruggled academically. Due to the fact that he had two problems (the lefttemporal lobe disorder and prefrontal cortex shutdown), I added the stimulantmedication magnesium pemoline (Cylert). This helped his attention span, and hisschoolwork improved dramatically. The positive response to treatment held fornine years. He recently graduated from high school. Before his graduation, Igave a lecture to the teachers at his school. Kris saw me in the hallway andcame over to introduce me to five of his friends.What do you think would have happened to Kris if he hadn’t received appropriatetreatment? It is likely that he would have found himself in the California YouthAuthority, juvenile hall, a residential treatment facility, or multiplepsychiatric facilities. I get upset when I think of all the children like Kriswho never get the help they need. They get labeled as bad, willful, defiantchildren who need more punishment, rather than what I see as the truth: childrenwith medical problems who need treatment.THE TEMPORAL LOBESThe temporal lobes have largely gone unnoticed. They are rarely talked about inpsychiatric circles, and even most neurologists do not speak about the richcontribution they make to who we are and what we experience in life. Until wewere able to map activity in the temporal lobes, their function remainedmysterious. Professionals basically relegated them as armrests for the brain.The brain-imaging work we have done clearly shows that the temporal lobes playan integral part in memory, emotional stability, learning, temper control, andsocialization.On the dominant side of the brain (the left side for most people), the temporallobes are intimately involved with understanding and processing language,intermediate-and long-term memory, complex memories, the retrieval of languageor words, emotional stability, and visual and auditory processing.The Temporal Lobesimage [Images/page139a.jpg]side viewimage [Images/page139b.jpg]3-D side surface viewimage [Images/page139c.jpg]3-D underside surface viewLanguage is one of the keys to being human. It allows us to communicate withother human beings and it allows us to leave a legacy of our thoughts andactions for future generations. Receptive language, being able to receive andunderstand speech and written words, requires temporal lobe stability. Theability to accurately hear your child say, “I love you, Daddy,” or to listen andbe frightened by a scary story is housed in this part of the brain. The dominanttemporal lobe helps to process sounds and written words into meaningfulinformation. Being able to read in an efficient manner, remember what you read,and integrate the new information relies heavily on the dominant temporal lobe.Problems here contribute to language struggles, miscommunication, and readingdisabilities.Through our research we have also found that optimum activity in the temporallobes enhances mood stability, while increased or decreased activity in thispart of the brain leads to fluctuating, inconsistent, or unpredictable moods andbehaviors.The nondominant temporal lobe (usually the right) is involved with readingfacial expressions, processing verbal tones and intonations from others, hearingrhythms, appreciating music, and visual learning.Recognizing familiar faces, facial expressions, and voice tones and intonationsis critical to social skill. Being able to tell when someone is happy to seeyou, scared of you, bored, or in a hurry is essential for effectivelyinteracting with others. A. Quaglino, an Italian ophthamologist, reported on apatient in 1867 who, after a stroke, was unable to recognize familiar facesdespite being able to read very small type. Since the 1940s more than onehundred cases of prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize familiar faces) havebeen reported in the medical literature. Patients who have this disorder areoften unaware of it (right hemisphere problems are often associated with neglector denial of illnesses) or they may be ashamed of being unable to recognizeclose family members or friends. Most commonly, these problems were associatedwith right temporal lobe problems. Results of current research suggest thatknowledge of emotional facial expressions is inborn, not learned. (Infants canrecognize their mothers’ emotional faces.) Yet, when there are problems in thispart of the brain, social skills can be impaired.The temporal lobes help us process the world of sight and sound, and give us thelanguage of life. This part of the brain allows us to be stimulated, relaxed, orbrought to ecstasy by the experience of great music. The temporal lobes havebeen called the “interpretive cortex,” as it interprets what we hear andintegrates it with stored memories to give interpretation or meaning to theincoming information. Strong feelings of conviction, great insight, and knowingthe truth have also been attributed to the temporal lobes.Temporal lobe abnormalities occur much more frequently than previouslyrecognized. The temporal lobes sit in a vulnerable area of the brain: thetemporal fossa, a cavity behind the eye sockets and underneath the temples. Thefront wall of the cavity includes a sharp, bony ridge (the wing of the sphenoidbone), which frequently damages the front part of the temporal lobes in evenminor head injuries. God would have done well to put bumper guards on thatridge. Since the temporal lobes sit in a cavity surrounded by bone on five sides(front, back, right side, left side, and underside) they can be damaged from ablow to the head at almost any angle.Model showing the base of the skullimage [Images/page141.jpg](The thick arrow points to the temporal fossa, where temporal lobe sits; thethin arrow points to the sharp wing of the sphenoid bone.)As with other brain problems, temporal lobe problems come from many differentsources: genetic inheritance (you can get these problems from your parents),toxic or infectious exposure, and head injuries. In my clinic we will ask youfive times whether or not you ever had a head injury. (It amazes us how oftenpeople forget they have had head injuries!) My intake paperwork will ask you ifyou’ve ever had a head injury. My historian, who people see before seeing me,asks this question. The structured computer testing we do asks this question. IfI see that patients answer no, no, and no to this question, I’ll ask them again.If they say no for the fourth time, I’ll ask them, “Are you sure? Have you everfallen out of a tree or off a fence or dived into a shallow pool?” It is notuncommon for people to say, “Oh, that’s right—now I remember.” One man, aftersaying no four times to this question, said, “Oh, yeah, I fell out of asecond-story window. I forgot.” Other patients, after saying no four times, havetold me about falling out of cars, going through car wind-shields, falling offporches five feet onto their heads, falling off balconies or down staircases,etc. Your brain is very soft and your skull is very hard. Your brain is moresophisticated than any computer we can design, and you cannot just drop acomputer and expect things will be okay. By virtue of their placement within theskull, the temporal lobes, prefrontal cortex, and cingulate gyrus are the mostvulnerable brain areas to damage.JakeJake, age 65, came to see me from Mississippi. His wife heard me on nationaltelevision and she was sure he had a temporal lobe problem. He was moody andaggressive and had memory problems. Jake complained of hearing bees “buzzing”(even though no bees were around) and of having a short fuse. “The littlestthings seem to set me off. Then I feel terribly guilty,” he said. When Jake wasfifteen years old he was in a diving accident in which he hit his head on theboard and was unconscious for several minutes. After the accident he developedproblems in school and with his temper. His brain SPECT study showed me thatmany of Jake’s problems came from the poor activity in both the front and backof the left temporal lobe (a pattern frequently seen in head injuries) and inhis prefrontal cortex. I placed him on Depakote (an antiseizure medication knownto stabilize activity in the temporal lobes) and Adderall, along with the otherType 4 suggestions given later. When I spoke to Jake and his wife three weekslater, they were very pleased. The temper outbursts had stopped completely andhe felt more focused and energetic. Six years later, his temper remains undercontrol.TEMPORAL LOBE PROBLEMSCommon problems seen with left temporal lobe abnormalities include aggression,dark or violent thoughts, sensitivity to slights, mild paranoia, word-findingproblems, auditory processing problems, reading difficulties, and emotionalinstability.The aggressiveness often seen with left temporal lobe abnormalities can beexpressed externally or internally (aggressive thoughts toward oneself.)Aggressive behavior is complex, but in a large study performed in my clinic onpeople who had assaulted another person or damaged property, more than 70percent had left temporal lobe abnormalities. It seems that temporal lobe damageor dysfunction makes a person more prone to irritable, angry, or violentthoughts. One patient of mine with temporal lobe dysfunction(probably inherited, as his father was a rage-a-holic) complains of frequent,intense violent thoughts. He feels shame over having these thoughts and didn’tunderstand where they came from. “I can be walking down the street,” he told me,“and someone accidentally brushes against me, and I get the thought of wantingto shoot him or club him to death. These thoughts frighten me.” Thankfully, eventhough his SPECT confirmed left temporal lobe dysfunction, he has goodprefrontal cortex function so he is able to supervise his behavior and maintainimpulse control over these terrible thoughts.In a similar case, Misty, a 45-year-old woman, came to see me for angeroutbursts. One day someone accidentally bumped into her in the grocery store andshe started screaming at the woman, which was the reason she came to see me. “Ijust don’t understand where my anger comes from,” she said. “I’ve had sixteenyears of therapy and it is still there. Out of the blue, I’ll go off. I get themost horrid thoughts. You’d hate me if you knew.” In her history, she had fallenoff the top of a bunk bed when she was 4 years old. She was unconscious for onlya minute or two. The front and back part of her left temporal lobe was clearlydamaged. A little bit of Depakote was very helpful to calm the monster within.Internal aggressiveness often expresses itself in suicidal behavior. In a studyfrom our clinic, we saw left temporal lobe abnormalities in 62 percent of ourpatients who had serious suicidal thoughts or actions. After I gave a lectureabout the brain in Oakland, a woman came up to me in tears. “Oh, Dr. Amen,” shesaid, “I know my whole family has temporal lobe problems. My paternalgreat-grandfather killed himself. My father’s mother and father killedthemselves. My father and two of my three uncles killed themselves and last yearmy son tried to kill himself. Is there help for us?” I had the opportunity toevaluate and scan three members in her family. Two had left temporal lobeabnormalities and Depakote was helpful in their treatment.In terms of suicidal behavior, one very sad case highlights the involvement ofthe left temporal lobes. For years I wrote a column in my local newspaper aboutthe brain and behavior. One column was about temporal lobe dysfunction andsuicidal behavior. A week or so later a mother came to see me. She told me thather twenty-year-old son had killed himself several months before and she wasgrief-stricken over the unbelievable turn of events in his life. “He was themost ideal child a mother could have,” she said. “He did great in school. He waspolite, cooperative, and a joy to have around. Then it all changed. Two yearsago he had a bicycle accident. He accidentally hit a branch in the street andwas flipped over the handlebars, landing on the left side his face. He wasunconscious when an onlooker got to him, but shortly thereafter came to. Nothingwas the same since then. He was moody, angry, easily set off. He started tocomplain of ‘bad thoughts’ in his head. I took him to see a therapist, but itdidn’t seem to help. One evening, I heard a loud noise out front. He had shotand killed himself on our front lawn.” Her son might well have been helped ifsomeone had recognized that his “minor head injury” had likely caused temporallobe damage and that anticonvulsant medication may well have prevented hissuicide.In addition to aggression, we have seen people with left temporal lobeabnormalities be more sensitive to slights and even appear mildly paranoid.Unlike people with schizophrenia, who can become frankly paranoid, temporal lobedysfunction often causes a person to think others are talking about them orlaughing at them when there is no evidence for it. This sensitivity can causeserious relational and work problems.Being able to read, integrate, and remember what you read is an essential skillin the modern-day world. Reading and language-processing problems are commonwhen there is dysfunction in the left temporal lobe. Nearly 20 percent of theU.S. population has difficulty reading. Our studies of people with dyslexia(underachievement in reading) often show underactivity in the back half of theleft temporal lobe. Dyslexia can be inherited or it can be brought about after ahead injury, damaging this part of the brain.In our experience, left temporal lobe abnormalities are more frequentlyassociated with externally directed discomfort (such as anger, irritability, oraggressiveness), while right temporal lobe abnormalities are more likelyassociated with internal discomfort (anxiety and fearfulness). The left-rightdichotomy has been particularly striking in our clinic population. One possibleexplanation is that the left hemisphere of the brain is involved withunderstanding and expressing language; as a result, when the left hemisphere isdamaged, a person can express discomfort. When the right or nondominanthemisphere is involved, the discomfort is more likely expressed nonverbally.Nondominant (usually right) temporal lobe problems more often involve socialskill problems, especially in the area of reading and recognizing facialexpressions and voice intonations. Mike, age 30, illustrates the difficulties wehave seen when there is dysfunction in this part of the brain. Mike came to seeme because he wanted a date. He had never had a date in his life and was veryfrustrated by his inability to meet and successfully ask a woman out. During theevaluation Mike said he was at a loss as to what his problem was. His mother,who accompanied him to the session, had her own ideas. “Mike,” she said,“misreads situations. He has always done that. Sometimes he comes on too strong;sometimes he is withdrawn when another person is interested. He doesn’t read thesound of my voice right either. I can be really mad at him and he doesn’t takeme seriously. Or he can think I’m mad when I’m nowhere near mad. When he was alittle boy Mike tried to play with other children, but he could never hold on tofriends. It was so painful to see him get discouraged.” Mike’s SPECT showedmarked decreased activity in his right temporal lobe. His left temporal lobe wasfine. The intervention that was most effective for Mike was intensive socialskills training. He worked with a psychologist who coached him on facialexpressions, voice tones, and proper social etiquette. He had his first date sixmonths after coming to the clinic.Abnormal activity in either or both temporal lobes can cause a wide variety ofsymptoms including abnormal perceptions (sensory illusions), memory problems,feelings of déjà vu (the sensation that you have been somewhere before eventhough you haven’t), jamais vu (not recognizing familiar places), periods ofpanic or fear for no particular reason, periods of spaciness or confusion, andpreoccupation with religious or moral issues. Illusions are also very commontemporal lobe symptoms. Common illusions include: * seeing shadows or bugs out of the corners of the eyes * seeing objects change size or shape (One patient would see lamp posts turn into animals, which would then run away; another patient would see figures move in a painting.) * hearing bees buzzing or static from a radio * smelling odors or getting odd tastes in the mouth * feeling bugs crawling on one’s skin or other skin sensations.Unexplained headaches and stomachaches also seem to be common in temporal lobedysfunction.Moral or religious preoccupation is a common symptom with temporal lobedysfunction. I have a little boy in my practice who, at age 6, made himselfphysically sick by worrying about all of the people who were going to hell.Another patient spent seven days a week in church, praying for the souls of hisfamily. He came to see me because of his morally indignant outbursts directed athis family. Another patient came to see me because he spent hours focused on the“mysteries of life” and could not get any work done. All of these patients hadtemporal lobe abnormalities.Hypergraphia, a tendency toward compulsive and extensive writing, has also beenreported in temporal lobe disorders. Some of my temporal lobe patients spendhours and hours writing. One patient, who moved to another state, used to writeme twenty-and thirty-page letters, detailing all of the aspects of her life. AsI learned about temporal lobe hypergraphia and had her treated withanticonvulsant medication, her letters became more coherent and concise. Manypeople with temporal lobe problems have the opposite of hypergraphia: They areunable to get words out of their heads. One of the therapists in my office, awonderful public speaker, could not get the thoughts out of his head to writehis book. On his scan there was decreased activity in both of his temporallobes. On a very small dose of Depakote his ideas were unlocked and he could nowwrite for hours at a time.Memory problems have long been one of the hallmarks of temporal lobedysfunction. Amnesia after a head injury is frequently due to damage to theinside aspect of the temporal lobes. Brain infections also cause severe memoryproblems. Harriet came to see me from New England. She was a very gracious83-year-old woman who had lost her memory fifteen years earlier during a bout ofencephalitis. Even though she remembered events before the infection, she couldonly remember small bits and pieces of them after the accident. An hour aftershe ate, she would feel full but forget what she ate. Her daughter heard melecture in Burlington, Vermont, and told her to come see me. Harriet said, “Ileft my brain to the local medical school, hoping my problems would help someoneelse, but I don’t think they’ll do anything with my brain except give it tomedical students to cut up. Plus, I want to know what the problem is. And writeit down: I won’t remember what you tell me!” Harriet’s brain showed markeddamage in both temporal lobes, especially on the left side, as if a virus hadgone to that part of her brain and chewed it away.JennyJenny, 16, tried to kill herself the night before I first met her. Her boyfriendhad just broken up with her. He told her that he was tired of the fights shestarted with him. She told him that she would kill herself if he left. When hestarted to leave, she took a knife and cut her wrist. He called the police. Atthat time Jenny was also having problems in school. Many of Jenny’s teacherssaid she was not living up to her potential and that she needed to try harder.Jenny and her parents fought constantly. Whenever they asked her to do somethingaround the house she would fly into a rage. Over the last year she had broken awindow and put several holes in walls and doors.Much was explained by the fact that at the age of 8, Jenny had fallen off herbike facefirst onto the cement. She had lost consciousness for about tenminutes. Since the accident, she had complained of headaches and vague abdominalpain. Her pediatrician told her mother that it was just stress. Jenny was alsooverly sensitive to perceived slights, saw shadows that were not there, hadperiods of anxiety with little provocation, and had trouble with reading andmemory.Jenny had Temporal Lobe ADD, one of the most difficult behavioral types of thisdisorder. She had trouble with inattention and impulse control. She was alsoconflict-seeking and underachieved in school. In addition, she had specifictemporal lobe symptoms, such as headaches and abdominal pain, illusions, periodsof anxiety for little reason, hypersensitivity to others, and memory and readingproblems. One of the hallmarks of Temporal Lobe ADD is aggression. She had bothexternal aggression (toward others and objects) and internal aggression (towardherself: the suicide attempt). Her brain SPECT study showed decreased activityin the prefrontal cortex (giving her trouble concentrating) and decreasedactivity in her left temporal lobe (probably from the head injury that predatedthe onset of many symptoms). I placed her on the anticonvulsant Neurontin, whichstabilized her mood instability and temper, and Adderall, which helped herattention span and impulsiveness. In addition, she changed her diet andexercised every day. Six years later she remains much better. She has justfinished college and has been in a stable relationship for two years.OmarOmar, 32, was sent to our clinic by his defense attorney after he had beenarrested for felony spouse abuse. On six occasions in the last four years Omarhad assaulted his wife. On the last occasion he broke her ribs and left arm. Hisexplosions seemed to come out of the blue.His wife said that some days he woke up “different.” On certain days he hadheadaches and was overly sensitive, and nothing his wife did was right. All hislife he had a frank expression of the core symptoms of ADD: impulsiveness,disorganization, short attention span, etc. Despite his problems, he had risento be a top salesperson in his company and was now in a management position. Dueto his explosive rage, he had attended psychotherapy and an anger managementclass, but it didn’t make much difference. He also had seen a psychiatrist whohad diagnosed him with ADD and given him Ritalin. The Ritalin made him feelspeedy and irritable.Anyone who assaults another person should have a brain scan, and Omar’s caseillustrates this. His SPECT study showed decreased activity in both of histemporal lobes and in the prefrontal cortex. He was placed on Neurontin andAdderall and given the dietary and exercise advice for this type. Over the nextthree months I adjusted his medication dosages and his temper cooled while hisability to focus and organize himself improved. The scans were used in his courtcase. As part of the plea agreement, Omar had to do community service and see apsychiatrist every month for five years. If he dropped out of treatment, hewould be taken to prison.Omar’s Concentration SPECT Study Before and After Treatment with Depakote(Underside Surface View)image [Images/page150a.jpg]with no medication (poor prefrontal and temporal lobe activity)image [Images/page150b.jpg]with Depakote (marked overall improvement)Frequently, stimulants such as Ritalin or Adderall make this ADD type worse ifthey are given without anticonvulsant medication to stabilize temporal lobefunction. They cause people to be irritable and sometimes more aggressive.Stabilizing the temporal lobes with anticonvulsant medications such as Depakote,Neurontin, or Tegretol can literally rescue a life from despair, hatred, andself-loathing. After the temporal lobes are treated, a stimulant medication maybe very helpful for concentration.JacobSince his mother was a drug addict and unable to care for him, Jacob lived withhis grandparents. Jacob was exposed to drugs in utero. When I saw him at the ageof 6, he was hyperactive, very impulsive, and easily distracted. Moreover, hestruggled with learning and had severe temper problems. His pediatrician haddiagnosed him with ADD and put him on the psychostimulant Cylert. Four daysafter starting the Cylert, he had visual hallucinations and became much moreirritable. The pediatrician referred Jacob to me. A SPECT evaluating histemporal lobes showed drug damage still evident from his in utero exposure. Itwas no surprise when I saw overall decreased activity in his brain, especiallyin the area of the left temporal lobe. Jacob’s temper improved on theanticonvulsant carbamazepine (Carbatrol). When his temporal lobes hadstabilized, I started him on Adderall to help his attention span. A year laterhe is much better.John’s Concentration SPECT Study (Left-Side Surface View)image [Images/page151.jpg]left-side surface view (Note marked area of decreased activity in the leftfrontal and temporal region.)JohnJohn, a 79-year-old contractor, had a long-standing history of alcohol abuse andviolent behavior toward his family. Almost all of the abuse occurred when he wasintoxicated. As a boy he had been described as hyperactive, slow in school, andimpulsive. At age 79, John underwent open-heart surgery. After the surgery hehad a psychotic episode, which lasted days. His doctor ordered a SPECT study aspart of his evaluation. The study showed marked decreased activity in the leftoutside frontal-temporal region, a finding most likely due to a past headinjury, and decreased activity in his prefrontal cortex. When the doctor askedJohn if he had ever had any significant head injuries, John told him about atime when he was 20 years old. While driving an old milk truck that was missingits side rear mirror, he put his head out of the window to look behind him. Hishead struck a pole, knocking him unconscious for several hours. After the headinjury he had more problems with his temper and memory. Despite a family historyof alcohol abuse in four of his five brothers, he was the only one withaggressive behavior. He was placed on Neurontin and Adderall. His behavior wasmuch more even and he was able to focus better than he had even when he was achild.NeilNeil, a 17-year-old male, was diagnosed with attention deficit/ hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD) and left temporal lobe dysfunction (diagnosed by EEG) at the ageof 14. Before then (from grades one to eight) he had been expelled from elevenschools for fighting, frequently cut school, and had already started drinkingalcohol and using marijuana. He had a dramatically positive response to 15milligrams of methylphenidate (Ritalin) three times a day. He improved threegrade levels of reading within the next year, attended school regularly, and hadno aggressive outbursts. His grandmother (with whom he lived) and his teacherswere very pleased with his progress. However, Neil had a negative emotionalresponse to taking medication. He later said that taking his medication, eventhough it obviously helped him, made him feel stupid and different. Two yearsafter starting his medication, he decided to stop it on his own without tellinganyone. His anger began to escalate again, as did his drinking and marijuanausage. One night, while he was intoxicated, his uncle came over to his home andasked Neil to help him “rob some women.” Neil went with his uncle and forced awoman into her car and made her go to her ATM and withdraw money. The uncle andNeil then raped the woman twice. He was apprehended two weeks later and chargedwith kidnapping, robbery, and rape.Neil’s Rest, Concentration, and Concentration with Treatment SPECT Study(Underside Surface View)image [Images/page153a.jpg]at rest (mild decreased prefrontal cortex and left temporal lobe [arrow])image [Images/page153b.jpg]with concentration (marked overall decreased activity)image [Images/page153c.jpg]with concentration with methylphenidate (overall improved perfusion)I was asked by Neil’s defense attorney to evaluate Neil. I agreed with theclinical history of ADD and suspected left temporal lobe dysfunction as wellbecause of the chronic aggressive behavior and abnormal EEG. I ordered a seriesof brain SPECT studies: one at rest, one while he was doing a concentrationtask, and one on methylphenidate. The rest of the study showed mild decreasedactivity in the prefrontal cortex and the left temporal lobe. While performing aconcentration task, there was marked suppression of the prefrontal cortex andboth temporal lobes. The third scan was done one hour after taking 15 milligramsof methylphenidate. This scan showed marked activation in the prefrontal cortexand both temporal lobes.After understanding the history and reviewing the scan data, it was apparentthat Neil already had a vulnerable brain that was consistent with long-termbehavioral and academic difficulties. His substance use might have furthersuppressed an already underactive prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe,diminishing executive abilities and unleashing aggressive tendencies. It ispossible that with an explanation of the underlying metabolic problems and briefpsychotherapy on the emotional issues surrounding the need to take medication,this serious problem might have been averted. In prison he was placed onpemoline and valproic acid, and he has had no aggressive outbursts for the pasttwo years.DIFFERENTIATING TYPE 4 (TEMPORAL LOBE) ADD FROM TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY (TLE)It can be challenging to differentiate Type 4 (Temporal Lobe) ADD from temporallobe epilepsy. Both disorders are due to abnormal activity in the temporal lobesand both are helped with anticonvulsant medication. Temporal lobe ADD may be acombination of a variant of temporal lobe epilepsy that is comorbid with ADD. Inorder for the diagnosis to be Temporal Lobe ADD, there needs to be long-standingcore ADD symptoms in addition to the temporal lobe symptoms. Many people withTLE do not have ADD symptoms and so would not fall into the Temporal Lobe ADDcategory."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9TYPE 5: LIMBIC ADD--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The sufferer has ADD core symptoms, plus:MoodinessNegativityLow energyFrequent irritabilityA tendency to be socially isolatedFrequent feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, or excessive guiltLowered interest in things that are usually considered funSleep changes (too much or too little)Chronic low self-esteem.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Type 5 (Limbic) ADD is where ADD and depression intersect each other. The ADDcore symptoms are present in addition to negativity, moodiness, sadness, lowenergy, and decreased interest in life. On SPECT we see decreased prefrontalcortex activity both at rest and during a concentration task, and we see toomuch activity in the deep limbic or emotional center of the brain. Depressionlooks similar on SPECT. There is decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex(especially on the left side) at rest, but unlike Limbic ADD it improves withconcentration. In order to fully understand Limbic ADD, we must gain acomprehensive picture of the deep limbic system.The deep limbic system lies near the center of the brain. Considering itssize—about that of a walnut—it is packed with functions critical to humanbehavior and survival. From an evolutionary standpoint, this is one of theoldest parts of the mammalian brain that enabled animals to experience andexpress emotions. It freed them from behavior and actions dictated by the brainstem, found in the older reptilian brain. The subsequent evolution of thesurrounding cerebral cortex in higher animals, especially humans, gave thecapacity for problem solving, planning, organization, and rational thought. Yet,in order for these functions to occur, one must have passion, emotion, and thedesire to make it happen. The deep limbic system adds the emotional spice, ifyou will, in both positive and negative ways.The Deep Limbic Systemimage [Images/page156.jpg]3-D underside active viewThis part of the brain is involved in setting a person’s emotional tone. Whenthe deep limbic system is less active, there is generally a positive, morehopeful state of mind. When it is heated up, or overactive, negativity takesover. This finding surprised us at first. We thought that excessive activity inthe part of the brain that controlled emotion might correlate with enhancedfeelings, not negative ones. But we noticed, again and again, that when thisarea was overactive on SPECT, it correlated with depression and negativity. Itseems that when the deep limbic system is inflamed, painful emotional shadingresults. New research on depression from other laboratories around the world hasborne this out.By providing emotional shading, the deep limbic system provides the filterthrough which you interpret the events of the day. It tags or colors events,depending on your emotional state of mind. When you are sad, with an overactivedeep-limbic system you are likely to interpret neutral events through a negativelens. For example, if you have a neutral or even positive conversation withsomeone whose deep limbic structure is overactive or “negatively set,” he or sheis likely to interpret the conversation in a negative way. Emotional tagging ofevents is more important than it seems at first: In fact, it is critical tosurvival. The emotional charge we give to certain events in our lives drives usto action (such as approaching a desired mate) or causes avoidance behavior(withdrawing from someone who has hurt you in the past).The deep limbic system, along with the deep temporal lobes, has also beenreported to store highly charged emotional memories, both positive and negative.If you have been traumatized by a dramatic event, such as being in a caraccident or watching your house burn down, or if you have been abused by aparent or a spouse, the emotional component of the memory is stored in the deeplimbic system of the brain. Likewise, if you have won the lottery, graduatedmagna cum laude, or watched your child’s birth, those emotional memories arestored here as well. The total experience of our emotional memories isresponsible, in part, for the emotional tone of our mind. The more ourexperience is on balance stable and positive, the more positive we are likely tofeel. The more trauma in our lives, the more emotionally set we become in anegative way. These emotional memories are intimately involved in the emotionaltagging that occurs.The deep limbic system also affects motivation and drive. Hyperactivity in thisarea is associated with lowered motivation and decreased drive, which is oftenseen in depression. The deep limbic system, especially the hypothalamus,controls the sleep and appetite cycles of the body. Healthy sleep and appetiteis essential to maintaining a proper internal milieu, and both of thesecomponents are often a problem with limbic abnormalities.The deep limbic structures are also intimately involved with bonding and socialconnectedness. When the deep limbic system of animals is damaged, they do notproperly bond with their young. For example, mother rats with damaged deeplimbic structures will drag their offspring around the cage as if they wereinanimate objects. They would not feed and nurture the young as they wouldnormally do. In people, this system affects the bonding mechanism that enablesyou to connect with others on a social level. As anyone who has ever moved to anew and unfamiliar place can attest, your ability to do this successfully inturn influences your moods.The deep limbic system directly processes the sense of smell, the only sensethat has so direct a connection. (The messages from all the other senses aresent to a “relay station,” the thalamus, before they are sent to their finaldestinations in different parts of the brain.) Considering this, it is easy tosee why smells can have such a powerful impact on our feeling states.Research has demonstrated that females, on average, have a larger deep limbicsystem than males. This gives females several advantages and disadvantages. Dueto their larger deep limbic brains, women are more in touch with their feelingsand are generally better able to express their feelings than men. They have anincreased ability to bond and be connected to others (which is why women are theprimary caretakers of children: There is no society on earth in which men arethe children’s primary caretakers). Females have a more acute sense of smell,which is likely to have developed from an evolutionary need for the mother torecognize her young. Having a larger deep limbic system leaves a female somewhatmore susceptible to depression, especially at times of significant hormonalchanges such as the onset of puberty, before menses, after the birth of a child,and at menopause.The deep limbic system, especially the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, isresponsible for translating our prevailing emotional state into physicalfeelings of relaxation or tension. The front half of the hypothalamus sendscalming signals to the body through the parasympathetic nervous system. The backhalf of the hypothalamus sends stimulating or fear signals to the body throughthe sympathetic nervous system. The back half of the hypothalamus, whenstimulated, is responsible for the fight-or-flight response. The deep limbicsystem and the prefrontal cortex have an intimate connection, serving as aswitching station between emotion and rational thought. This allows us tointegrate both rational and emotional information into our decision making.Without this integration, we’d be creatures of pure logic or pure emotion—andhamstrung either way.DEPRESSION VERSUS LIMBIC ADDDue to the similarities between the two conditions, it can be hard todistinguish between depression and Limbic ADD: After all, both diseasesdemonstrate similar symptoms and even somewhat similar SPECT results.Developmental history seems to be the most helpful tool in helping cliniciansdecide. Depression tends to be a cyclic illness. It may be associated with someof the core symptoms of ADD, but not in an ongoing developmental pattern. Thecognitive symptoms (core ADD symptoms) are only present when the depression ispresent. By contrast, in ADD one can see symptoms for a prolonged period oftime, often back to childhood.There are subtle SPECT differences. Depression is seen on SPECT as decreasedactivity in the left prefrontal cortex at rest correlated with increased limbicactivity. When a depressed person tries to concentrate, however, activity in theprefrontal cortex usually increases. Limbic ADD, on the other hand, tends toshow decreased prefrontal cortex activity during concentration in conjunctionwith increased limbic activityBarryBarry, 70, came to my clinic for help with a short attention span, poor memory,decreased energy, terrible disorganization, and trouble finishing projects.Barry also complained of problems sleeping, frequent negative thoughts,excessive guilt, and a tendency to isolate himself. His doctor felt that he wasdepressed, but the antidepressants Prozac and Zoloft only made him feel worse.His great-grandson had just been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder andgot significant benefit from treatment. Barry’s great-grandson reminded Barry ofhimself when he was a little boy. Maybe there was still time for him to gethelp….Barry had symptoms consistent with limbic ADD. His brain SPECT study showed thecharacteristic decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex plus increasedactivity in the limbic system. Barry needed supplements of DL-phenylalanine andL-tyrosine, the amino acid building blocks for norepinephrine and dopamine, thetwo neurotransmitters implicated in this type of ADD. Within two weeks Barrynoticed a significant benefit. He felt more focused, had better physical andmental energy, and was more positive and more social.Barry’s Concentration SPECT Study (Underside Active View)image [Images/page160.jpg]CharityCharity was 37 when she first came to my clinic, brought in by her husband, alocal minister. Both she and her husband wanted help with Charity’s negativity,low energy, poor organization, irritability, and short attention span. She alsohad a poor appetite and trouble gaining weight. Charity was also verydistractible and sensitive to touch. She cut tags out of her shirt and couldonly be touched by her husband when she was in the mood. Her family physiciantried her on Paxil and Celexa, but they seemed to make her symptoms worse.Charity had had struggles in school since she was a little girl. She was aquiet, sad child who tended to be in trouble for her messy room. Homework wastorture for her. Her long-standing symptoms of short attention span,distractibility, disorganization, and poor follow-through were consistent withan ADD diagnosis. In addition, the symptoms of negativity, social isolation, lowlibido, and poor energy put the ADD into Type 4. Initially, Charity wanted totry a “more natural treatment” than prescription medication. I placed her onDL-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine along with The Zone Diet and intense aerobicexercise. Within several weeks Charity felt much improved. Her appetite wasbetter, she was able to gain a few pounds, and she felt more focused and lessdistracted. Her husband said she was like a new person. Her libido alsoimproved.DougSeventeen-year-old Doug was brought to our clinic by his parents. He was failingin school, despite his high intelligence. Even before his appointment he startedto talk about feeling hopeless and suicidal. He was socially isolated, didn’tfind pleasure in activities other teens enjoyed, and had negative thoughtpatterns. He smoked marijuana as a way to feel more relaxed and less depressed.He had always struggled in school with a short attention span anddistractibility, and he was, as he put it, “the master of procrastination.” Hehad been seen in psychotherapy and had had tutors through the years, but theseinterventions did not make much difference. The family doctor put Doug onProzac, but it only made him less motivated.Seeing the situation as serious, I ordered a SPECT series. Doug had decreasedprefrontal cortex activity at rest that worsened with concentration, increaseddeep limbic activity, and decreased activity in the back half of the temporallobes, a finding common among marijuana users. I showed Doug his scan andencouraged him to stay away from the marijuana as it was probably damaging hisbrain. I told him the damage would probably get much better if he stopped. Inaddition, I put him on Wellbutrin to stabilize his mood, plus a small dose ofAdderall to help him with energy and focus, and encouraged him to change hisdiet and get more exercise.Within two months Doug was feeling much better. He was less negative and moreoptimistic, focused, and positive about school. He decided to take theCalifornia High School Proficiency Examination for his high school equivalencydiploma. By the age of 20 he earned his A.A. degree and is now attending aCalifornia university.Doug’s case is not unusual. Many people use illegal drugs as a form ofself-medication. They have an underlying mood disorder, some type of ADD oranxiety disorder, and use drugs as a means to feel better, more normal. Withoutproper treatment it is very hard for them to give up the substance abuse.StaceyAt the age of 15, Stacey was failing school. She had two D’s, two F’s, and a C.She had been cutting classes, smoking cigarettes, and arguing with her parents.To make matters worse, she had recently become sexually active and had just hadan abortion before she came for an evaluation at the clinic. Despite being abright child, she had always struggled in school. Homework took forever to do,and she frequently did not turn it in. She had poor handwriting and was easilydistracted, impulsive, and disorganized. As time went on, she was becoming morenegative, irritable, and isolated.After a full evaluation it was clear to me that Stacey had Limbic ADD. A SPECTstudy confirmed the diagnosis. Initially, I tried her on a purely supplementalapproach: DL-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. They were not effective. But she didhave a nice response to Wellbutrin, a stimulating antidepressant. Within twoweeks her mood brightened, her attention span improved, and she even stoppedsmoking. (Wellbutrin has been approved by the FDA to help people stop smoking.)Stacey’s Concentration SPECT Study (Underside Active View)image [Images/page163.jpg]SonnyThirty-eight-year-old Sonny was brought to see me by her husband. Frequentlyoverwhelmed, irritable, and negative, she had trouble keeping up with her workat home and constantly complained of being tired. She had a very poor appetiteand did not sleep well. She had little interest in sex and was growing ever moredistant from her husband and family. She had barely graduated from high school.She tended to fall asleep whenever she read. Her husband had read about ADD andfound our clinic on the Web. She took our interactive ADD test on the Web andfound it was likely that she had Limbic ADD. After evaluating her, I agreed. Igave her the options of antidepressant medication or the amino acid supplements.We started with the supplements and a diet and exercise regimen. After threeweeks she said that the combination was very helpful for her. She could tellwithin half an hour if she cheated on the diet. She said, “It’s amazing to methat food is as powerful as a drug. When I eat right I feel good. When I don’teat right I feel bad.” Her libido improved, as she felt better emotionally andphysically.Limbic ADD is often responsible for failed marriages. The low sexual interest,tiredness, feelings of being constantly overwhelmed, and lack of attention todetail often cause marital conflict. Treating Limbic ADD can literally savefamilies and change a person’s life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10TYPE 6: “RING OF FIRE” ADD--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The sufferer has ADD core symptoms, plus:Is angry or aggressiveIs sensitive to noise, light, clothes, or touchHas frequent or cyclic mood changes (highs and lows)Is inflexible, or rigid in thinkingInsists on having his or her own way, even when told no multiple timesHas periods of mean, nasty, or insensitive behaviorHas periods of excessive talkativenessHas periods of excessive impulsivityExhibits unpredictable behaviorDisplays grandiose or “larger than life” thinkingTalks fastHas the sensation that thoughts go fastAppears anxious or fearful.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ring of Fire” ADD gets its name from the physiology underlying the disease asseen on SPECT scans. Rather than having the typical underactive prefrontalcortex activity that is seen in Type 1 and Type 2 ADD, these patients havebrains that are on balance hyperactive and disinhibited. People with “Ring ofFire” ADD have too much brain activity across the whole cerebral cortex,especially in the cingulate gyrus, parietal lobes, temporal lobes, andprefrontal cortex. In a brain scan it looks like a ring of hyperactivity aroundthe brain. At The Amen Clinic we look at the 3-D active scans in blue (averageactivity) and red (the most active). In this type of ADD the ring of redreminded me of a band of fire surrounding the brain—fire that burns the personwithin and anyone with whom he comes into contact.JaredJared was diagnosed with ADD at the age of 8. He was hyperactive, restless,impulsive, hyperverbal, moody, and oppositional. His parents brought him to thepediatrician on the recommendation of the teacher. In succession, he was triedon three stimulant medications (Ritalin, Dexedrine, and Cylert), but they allmade him worse: Each made him more moody, irritable, and talkative. His parentsstopped the medication and refused to bring him back for help. Every bad thingthat happens to untreated ADD children happened to Jared. He dropped out ofschool in ninth grade. He started using drugs and alcohol at age 14. His parentsthrew him out of the house at age 16 because of his temper and drug use. He hadtrouble with the law. Drinking alcohol often sparked fits of violence, eventhough he said the alcohol made him feel better. From the ages of 18 to 20 hewas arrested ten times for violent behavior, all when he was intoxicated. Itwasn’t until Jared was arrested for armed robbery that he came to my clinic.On the night of the last crime Jared started drinking at about 10:00 P.M. Hedrank a fifth of peach schnapps chased by 40 ounces of malt liquor. He thenraced a friend down the freeway, crashing his car and fleeing the scene on foot.A short while later he flagged down a cab driver. At exactly 12:10 A.M. hepointed a loaded gun at the cab driver’s head and demanded all his money. He got$25. The next morning, after sobering up, he turned himself in to the police.Jared’s defense attorney called me to discuss the case. He wondered if the ADDdiagnosis would help his defense. I said I didn’t think it would help butwondered why, if Jared really had ADD, the stimulants made him worse and why hecontinued to drink despite all of the terrible problems it caused him. Since heseemed to be aggressive only when he drank, I decided to scan him both sober anddrunk.The first SPECT study was performed when Jared was clean and sober. The secondstudy was performed after he consumed a fifth of peach schnapps, followed by 40ounces of malt liquor (the same brands he had drunk on his last night of crime).The sober study revealed marked overactivity in the “Ring of Fire” pattern (hotzones in the cingulate gyrus, the right and left lateral prefrontal cortices,the right and left parietal lobes, and the left and right temporal lobes). Thesefindings are often associated with anxiety, cyclic mood tendencies, andirritability.For the alcohol study, Jared’s blood alcohol level was 0.2g/dl(%)—double what islegally drunk in most states. This study showed an overall dampening effect onthe hyperactive areas of the brain (prefrontal, parietal, and temporal lobes),with only the cingulate gyrus showing excessive activity, although significantlyless activity than in the nonalcohol study. In addition, the right and leftprefrontal cortex was now significantly underactive, as were the left and righttemporal lobes.Given Jared’s marked brain hyperactivity in a sober state, along with his reportthat he felt more relaxed when he drank, it was not unreasonable to assume thathe may have been using alcohol as a way to self-medicate—a way to settle downhis brain and feel more comfortable. Unfortunately, by self-medicating, he wasinducing his brain to violence. The intoxicated pattern in his brain—increasedanterior cingulate activity, abnormal left temporal lobe activity, and decreasedprefrontal cortex activity—is the triad of symptoms that have been found inviolent patients. In trying to ease the underlying abnormalities in his brain,he drank himself into a violent state.Jarred is a textbook example of “Ring of Fire” ADD. He had all the hallmarksymptoms, including irritability, hyperactivity, excessive talking, overfocus,extreme oppositional behavior, and cyclic periods of calm alternating withintense aggressiveness.Psychostimulant medication, such as Ritalin, frequently makes “Ring of Fire” ADDpatients more worried, more irritable, and more negative. “Ring of Fire” ADD isoften helped with either anticonvulsant medication or new antipsychoticmedications such as Risperdal or Zyprexa. A high-protein, low-carbohydrate dietis often helpful as well. The amino acid GABA often has an overall calmingeffect on the cortical hyperactivity. St. John’s wort and SSRI antidepressantssuch as Prozac or Zoloft (medications that increase serotonin) often make thistype much worse.Jared’s SPECT Series off and on Alcohol (The top four images are 3-D activeviews: Notice that the “Ring of Fire” is calmed by alcohol. The bottom twoimages are 3-D surface views: Notice that alcohol crashes brain activity,especially in the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes.)image [Images/page168a.jpg]no alcohol, top-down viewimage [Images/page168b.jpg]intoxicated, top-down viewimage [Images/page168c.jpg]no alcohol, left-side viewimage [Images/page168d.jpg]intoxicated,left-side viewimage [Images/page168e.jpg]no alcohol,undersurface viewimage [Images/page168f.jpg]intoxicated,undersurface viewIn looking at the SPECT scans for this pattern, we see a number of abnormalitiesthat seem to explain the symptoms. “Hyperfrontality,” a term for the combinedfindings of increased anterior cingulate activity and increased left and rightlateral prefrontal cortex activity, is associated with severe overfocusedsymptoms, such as worrying, obsessiveness, oppositional behavior, and cognitiveinflexibility. Distractibility and hypersensitivity to the environment (extremesensitivity to sound, touch, taste, smells, and sights) are marked by increasedparietal lobe activity. The parietal lobes contain the brain’s sensory cortex,which when overactive causes a person to be hypersensitive to incominginformation. Increased lateral temporal lobe activity often causes problems withmood instability and rages. In many ways, the “Ring of Fire” is every type ofADD rolled into one! This is the most intense ADD type.CaseyCasey was described by his teacher as a sweet, endearing boy who tries very hardand always does his best. She also said that even though he does worry too muchand gets upset if he makes a mistake, he works with enthusiasm and is a superstudent.That’s when he is on his medication. Without it he is a horror to be around.Unmedicated, Casey is cruel, combative, angry, and obnoxious. He has tempertantrums and is violent. He has difficulty following rules set by his teacherand will often argue with her or just refuse to obey instructions. At home it’sjust as bad. He is afraid of new situations and usually reacts to change bycovering his ears to block out the new experience. At The Amen Clinic he was soparalyzed, he couldn’t even flush the toilet. He has difficulty followinginstructions that his mother gives. Casey often replies to an order by sayingthings like “I hate you,” “I wish you were dead,” and “I want to kill you.”Occasionally he dispenses with words entirely, choosing instead to lash out withhis fists.Casey’s Concentration SPECT Study (Top-Down Active View)image [Images/page170.jpg]There was no question that Casey needed a SPECT scan as part of his evaluation.The scan showed an overactive brain with increased activity in both prefrontalcortex, both parietal lobes, and the anterior cingulate gyrus. Casey neededRisperdal (a new, novel antipsychotic medication that we have found to behelpful for this pattern) to tame the “Ring of Fire” and then Ritalin to treatthe underlying core ADD symptoms. Ritalin by itself had made Casey worse, but incombination with a full treatment program, it helped Casey become who he reallyis. The changes in his behavior while on the medications have been vast. Theeffects of treatment were best summed up by his fourth-grade teacher when shesaid, “This year I have only seen two incidents of misbehavior and both timeswere days he had missed his medication.”RonnyRonny was 9 years old when his mother brought him to The Amen Clinic. His motherfirst sensed that something was wrong when, at ten months old, he would beginscreaming for no apparent reason. Throughout kindergarten he often hid in thecupboards. Even when he wasn’t in a cupboard, he refused to participate inclass. From the second grade on, he would experiment sexually with several boys.He became obsessed with sex. As Ronny grew up, he became increasinglyoppositional and would scream and throw temper tantrums when asked to dosomething. Right before his initial evaluation his behaviors became even moreworrisome. He threatened to kill himself when his mother tried to take a knifeaway from him. Ronny’s SPECT study showed the “Ring of Fire” pattern. BeforeRonny came to the clinic, he had been on Ritalin, which had made him moreirritable and aggressive. Seeing his scan, the doctor in my clinic put him onDepakote (an anticonvulsant medication often helpful with the “Ring of Fire”pattern). After some improvement in his behavior, we did a second SPECT study.His second study, performed on Depakote, was calmer overall, but his prefrontalcortex was underactive. Once Adderall was added to his regimen, he was betterable to focus. On his current medication his mood is much better, he has a moreeven temper, and he is less distractible. His oppositional behavior hasdiminished, and through parent training, exercise, and dietary interventions hecontinues to improve.Ronny’s Concentration SPECT Study (Top-Down Active View)image [Images/page171.jpg]GuyNineteen-year-old Guy came to the clinic because he was having problemscontrolling his temper. He has always had a bad temper and was constantlygetting into fights, but they were just that: minor fistfights. That all changedten months before he first came to The Amen Clinic. He got in a fight withsomeone from a gang. In that fight he took several blows to the head from a pairof num-chucks and went to the hospital with a concussion. While he was in the ERof the hospital he got into another fight, this time with a police officer, andwas once again hit in the head several times, this time with a mag flashlight.Since the incidents of that night ten months before he came to the Clinic, Guyhas even less control over his temper, especially around figures of authority.He had always taken umbrage at authority figures, but now he had no control overhis temper around them. “He also experienced an increase in dark thoughts. Whenangry, his impulses have turned homicidal. This disturbed Guy, who said, “Idefinitely don’t want to hurt anybody or take someone’s life, but my thoughtssay something different. I just don’t understand my own brain anymore.” At aboutthe same time Guy began to think about suicide. He even knew how he would do it:with a shotgun “to make sure it was over.” He didn’t think he’d ever try to killhimself, but the thought hadn’t even crossed his mind until his head trauma tenmonths earlier. His relationships with the people in his life also changed. Hewould cut people out of his life on a whim: “My way or the highway,” he said.Guy’s Concentration SPECT Study (Top-Down Active View)image [Images/page172.jpg]Guy has a new son, and that’s what brought him to The Amen Clinic. His scanshowed the “Ring of Fire” pattern. With a combination of medication (ananticonvulsant, Neurontin, and a stimulating antidepressant, Effexor), diet,therapy, and exercise, he has improved greatly. He is less depressed and hascontrol over his temper, and his attention span has improved.THE PARIETAL LOBESOne brain system not discussed yet is the parietal lobes, located toward theback top of the brain. Also called the sensory cortex, the parietal lobesprocess the sense of touch. When this part of the brain is too active, as isoften the case in “Ring of Fire” ADD (and to a lesser extent the other types aswell), people become hypersensitive to their environment: They tend to see toomuch, feel too much, and sense too much. Distractibility is especiallyheightened in these patients.DIFFERENTIATING TYPE 6 (“RING OF FIRE”) ADD FROM BIPOLAR DISORDERChild psychiatrist Thomas Jaeger from Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska,has also done pioneering work with brain SPECT imaging. Early in his work henoticed that children and teenagers with bipolar disorder (what used to be knownas manic-depressive illness) had a patchy pattern of increased activity acrossthe cortical surface of the brain. Below is an image of a bipolar patient duringa manic episode. Manic episodes are characterized by a cluster of the followingsymptoms: inflated self-esteem, hyperactive behavior, fleeting attention span,extreme impulsivity (such as in sexual matters or by foolish spending),increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and oftentimes psychotic thinking.“Ring of Fire” ADD is very similar to this in both its symptoms and brainpattern. However, patients with bipolar disorder do not have the underlying coresymptoms of ADD. In addition, their symptoms appear and disappear in a cyclicfashion. If the core ADD symptoms are present over a prolonged period of time,“Ring of Fire” ADD must be suspected. Frequently we see both patterns. The ADDcore symptoms are present over time, but the mood problems occur in a cycle.Some doctors would argue that there are really two separate conditions at work:both ADD and bipolar disorder. We see the “Ring of Fire” pattern so commonly inour ADD patients that we feel it is a distinct ADD type and are comfortabledescribing it as a discrete disorder.Differentiating “Ring of Fire” ADD from bipolar disorder is generally difficultin children and easy in adults. In children bipolar disorder resembles severeADD. Bipolar children tend to be cyclic in their mood and behavior problems.They have times when they are awful, irritable, and aggressive, and they havetimes whenBipolar Brainimage [Images/page174.jpg]3-D top-down active viewthings are relatively normal. “Ring of Fire” ADD kids tend to have problems on amore consistent basis. Adults with bipolar disorder have manic episodes, whilepeople with “Ring of Fire” ADD do not. Their behavior tends to be consistentover long periods of time. One can have both “Ring of Fire” ADD and bipolardisorder, and some studies suggest that as many as half of the people withbipolar disorder also meet the criteria for ADD."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11SOFT BRAIN, HARD SKULLHead-Trauma–Induced ADDOne of the most common causes of ADD outside of genetics is head trauma,especially to the left prefrontal cortex. Our brain-imaging work has taught usthat head injuries are more important than most physicians have previouslybelieved. SPECT shows areas of damage not seen in anatomy studies like CAT scansor MRI. With SPECT we can see contra-coup injuries (opposite parts of the braindamaged by the same injury) and old injuries (even damage from birth or forcepsdeliveries). Why are head injuries so important? Some basic brain facts willclear that up. * Your brain is involved with everything you do. How you think. How you feel. How you act. And how well you get along with other people. How your brain works is intimately involved with determining the kind of person you are. * Your brain is very complex. Did you know you have 100 billion nerve cells, or neurons? Every one of your neurons is connected to hundreds and even thousands of other neurons. You have more connections in your brain than there are stars in the universe. Your brain is more intricate, delicate, and complicated than any computer that we can imagine. * Your brain is soft. It is similar in consistency to soft butter or a raw egg. When I was a little boy working in my father’s grocery store, I used to see cow brains in little white cups. The cow brains, like human brains, were so soft that they took on the shape of the cup. * Your skull is hard. Inside your skull there are many ridges, rough areas, and sharp, bony ridges. * Your brain is in a closed space. When you experience a blow to the head, there is no place for the brain to go. It ends up slamming against the walls, ridges, and sharp, bony edges of your skull, ripping small blood vessels, causing micro-hemorrhaging (bleeding) and, over time, small areas of scar tissue. * Consciousness is controlled by structures deep in the brainstem. The brain stem may not be injured in a head trauma, but there may be a significant injury to the cortex or surface of the brain, with no loss of consciousness.Our experience with ADD tells us that when the left prefrontal cortex isinjured, people have more ADD-like symptoms. The injuries can be from any cause:a damaging forceps delivery; a fall down a couple of stairs or off a bicycle,head-banging as a child; a blow during a fight, a rape, or a robbery; or a motorvehicle accident. Because of higher levels of activity and impulsivity, peoplewith ADD have more head injuries, which may make it hard to determine theoriginal cause of the problematic symptoms.Frequently patients and their parents forget about head injuries, even thoughthey might have been very significant. We will ask a patient five times whetheror not they have had a head injury.Due to its location, the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes are especiallysusceptible to head injuries. Many people do not fully understand how headinjuries—sometimes even “minor” ones, in which no loss of consciousnessoccurs—can alter a person’s character and ability to learn. We see head injuriesso often on the SPECT studies we order in our ADD patients that we are temptedto add a seventh type of ADD: Head Injury ADD. Post–head injury symptoms oftenconsist of attention problems, memory difficulties, and decreased energy andmotivation. In head injury–induced ADD, the symptoms follow a significant headinjury and frequently look like one of the types of ADD. If the injury justaffected the prefrontal cortex, it can look like Type 1 or Type 2. If the injuryaffected the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes (common because of thelocation of the temporal lobes) it can look like Type 4. If the injury damagedthe anterior cingulate gyrus, it can look like Type 3. The treatment depends onthe clinical picture. We have seen anticonvulsants help to stabilize temporallobe symptoms and stimulants help prefrontal cortex symptoms.Brain damage from a head injury has a number of causes. After a head injury,blood vessels may tear or break near the area of injury, causing bleeding,inflammation, and scarring. The blood vessel disruption decreases blood flow toan area, preventing the delivery of nutrients and the disposal of toxins. Inaddition, rotational and shearing effects can also occur from the force of aninjury. After an injury the body’s defense system goes into action. Recentstudies have indicated that the immune system may release substances that areactually toxic to brain cells.BrianWhen Brian was 7 years old he rode his bike full speed into the corner of abrick column. He was wearing a helmet, but it cracked under the force of theblow. He was unconscious for about half an hour. His parents did all of theright things, including taking him to the emergency room to have a CAT scandone. The emergency-room physician just said to watch him. No one said to watchfor problems in behavior or learning. After the injury, the mother notedchanges, subtle at first and then more drastic. By the age of 12, Brian wasmoody, emotional, irritable, and struggling in school. When he finally came forevaluation at age 16, he was almost failing in school and had just started toexperiment with drugs.Brian’s SPECT study showed clear decreased activity in the left lateralprefrontal cortex, underneath the scar from the bicycle accident. His treatmentplan included a small dose of Adderall and brainwave biofeedback over his leftprefrontal cortex. The biofeedback was so effective that within eight months hewas able to perform in school and at home at a high level without themedication.Brian’s SPECT Study (Left-Side Surface View)image [Images/page179a.jpg]image [Images/page179b.jpg]before treatment after treatmentDanielleDanielle, age 9, was a sweet, loving child who was doing well in third grade andgetting along well with other children. Over Christmas break, while going withher older brother to a family party, she was in a car accident. Danielle hadbeen using a seat belt; nevertheless, the left side of her head slammed againstthe rear side window. She was only briefly unconscious. Over about eight weeksDanielle’s behavior began to change. She became negative, irritable, andoppositional. She blurted out in class and she had trouble paying attention toher work at school. Homework was a chore, where before it had been easy for her.Over the next year she lost most of her friends because she started trouble withthem or said things that hurt their feelings.A year after the accident, Danielle’s mother knew that there was somethingseriously wrong. She brought Danielle to a counselor, who thought the problemwas psychological—an emotional vestige of the accident. Her pediatrician thoughtDanielle was just being oppositional and recommended a tough-love approach.Reluctantly the pediatrician diagnosed her with ADD and tried Ritalin, but itdidn’t help very much: In fact, it only seemed to make her more moody andaggressive. By the age of 14, when she came to our clinic for evaluation,Danielle was failing in school and had many behavioral problems at home. Isuspected that her problems were the result of physical damage to her brain fromthe accident, and her SPECT study bore that out. She showed marked decreasedactivity in the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes. I placed her on a smalldose of Neurontin to stabilize her temporal lobes and Adderall to help her tofocus. The medication evened out her mood and improved Danielle’s focusingability, allowing her to be more successful in school and more pleasant to bearound.WesWes was 54 years old when he sought help. He was depressed, suicidal, andlethargic, and had a very short attention span. His volatile temper, a problemfor his whole life, had cost him two marriages and any shred of closeness withhis children. Now he had just broken up with his girlfriend of two years and wasfacing a very lonely life. Wes told me that he had done well in school until theeleventh grade. That was the time that he was in a car accident with a teenagefriend. The friend had been drinking and had lost control of the car. Wes wasn’twearing a seat belt and his head cracked the windshield. Before the accident hehad been a good student with dreams of going to Stanford, but the next semesterhe did very poorly. He gave up the idea of going to a top-rung university,saying, “I couldn’t pay attention anymore. My mind was always wandering offtask.” Wes had job security because he worked in his father’s business, but heand his father fought constantly. His father wanted him to be on time and staythe whole day. Wes frequently took off and didn’t finish the tasks assigned tohim.Wes’s SPECT series was very abnormal. He had decreased activity over the vertex(top) of the brain and decreased prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe activity,especially on the left side of the brain. With concentration, there was furtheroverall decreased activity. Seeing the scan helped Wes understand why he had thestruggles he did. On a combination of anticonvulsant and stimulant medicationand biofeedback over the left prefrontal and temporal lobe regions, his mood,temper, and attention span stabilized. His girlfriend returned when she realizedhe was dealing with a medical problem, as opposed to just being a difficultperson.Wes’s SPECT Seriesimage [Images/page181a.jpg]At Resttop-downimage [Images/page181b.jpg]With Concentrationtop-downimage [Images/page181c.jpg]front-onimage [Images/page181d.jpg]front-onimage [Images/page181e.jpg]undersideimage [Images/page181f.jpg]undersideAleciaAt the age of 22, Alecia tripped and fell facedown on a slick, rain-soaked rampat college. She slid fifteen feet before her head struck a concrete wall. Shewas dazed for most of the day, nauseated for a week, and had a headache for amonth. A year later she was referred to me by a therapist who had been seeingher for temper problems. She also had trouble thinking clearly and had to dropout of school. She had energy problems, problems with goal setting, and troubleorganizing herself, in addition to spending money foolishly. On SPECT there wasmarked decreased activity in her prefrontal cortex (especially in the prefrontalpole) and temporal lobes.SalSal was referred to my clinic by his marital therapist. Sal and his wife had arelationship filled with conflict, tension, and turmoil. Sal’s wife complainedthat he was inattentive, selfish, and incapable of expressing feelings. Sal wasa marginally successful attorney who had trouble keeping clients. Like his wife,they found him aloof and seemingly uninterested.Sal’s problems began in high school. During his senior year Sal had fourconcussions playing football—two on the same night! Sal went to college butplayed football only for a year: With all the time he now had to spend studying,he just didn’t have the room in his schedule. After college it took him threeyears to get into law school. He was persistent but not as sharp as he had beenin the early years of high school.Alecia’s SPECT Study (with Concentration)image [Images/page183a.jpg]top-downimage [Images/page183b.jpg]undersideimage [Images/page183c.jpg]front-onI suspected that the football head injuries were important in explaining hiscurrent symptoms. His SPECT study showed very specific damage to his leftprefrontal cortex and left temporal lobe in a pattern consistent with headinjury. The outside of the left prefrontal cortex (called the dorsal lateralprefrontal cortex) is the expressive language area of the brain. In Sal’s caseit had suffered damage and taken with it his ability for empathy and expressivelanguage. I diagnosed him with alexythymia, a disorder in which people do nothave access to their own feelings. Sal cared about his wife, but no amount oftherapy helped him to express his feelings. He didn’t understand feelings: Whenpeople talked about feelings, it was like a foreign language to him.On a combination of an anticonvulsant medication and biofeedback over his leftprefrontal cortex, Sal, to his wife’s delight, became more expressive and moreempathic.Head injuries, depending on the areas affected, can result in different ADDtypes. ADD symptoms subsequent to head injuries often respond to the sametreatments as do the specific ADD types. My SPECT work has taught me howdevastating head injuries can be and how important it is to protect your headand the heads of children. After seeing these scans, I would not let my childrenhit soccer balls with their heads, play tackle football, or snowboard without ahelmet. Instead, I encourage my own kids to play tennis, golf, and Ping-Pong,and to run track and row.Sal’s SPECT Study (with Concentration)image [Images/page184a.jpg]undersideimage [Images/page184b.jpg]left side"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12ADD IN FAMILIESSPECT Studies Across GenerationsADD is a generational disorder, meaning that ADD in a family significantlyinfluences the development of each member. The level of influence is oftendetermined by which parent has ADD, whether it is the father or mother. ADDmothers often have a more negative impact on children than ADD fathers. Inaddition, ADD influences parenting, job choices, creativity, family moves, andlegal issues. Here are four examples of ADD across generations.Celina, Samuel, and LauraBefore she came to see me, Celina, 36, had been depressed for ten years,following the birth of her first child. Her symptoms included significantirritability, crying spells, sleeplessness, and weight loss. She also hadproblems concentrating and she was unable to manage her two children. Hercondition was brought to a crisis when she attempted suicide after separatingfrom her husband. She was initially seen by a psychiatrist, who started her onmedication for depression, but it had little effect. Then she came to see me. Itreated her with psychotherapy and a different antidepressant. The treatmenthelped her feel more positive and less irritable, but several months later shedecided that she “should be stronger than the depression” and took herself offthe medication. Her depression worsened, but she was resistant to restarting hermedication: “I don’t want to have to rely on medication to feel well,” she said.In an effort to demonstrate to Celina that her depression was, at least in part,biological and that her medication was an important part of treatment, I ordereda brain SPECT study. The results surprised me. Celina’s SPECT study revealedmarked decreased frontal lobe activity and increased activity in her limbicsystem, which fit with her underlying depression. However, it showed strikingoveractivity in the anterior cingulate portion of her brain as well. As we haveseen, this finding is often seen in people who tend to get stuck in negativethought or behavioral patterns.With this information I asked her more directly about obsessive thoughts andcompulsive symptoms. In fact, Celina was a perfectionist at home and hadobsessive negative thoughts. She tearfully remarked, “You mean my husband wasright when he said it was strange that I had to have all the shirts buttoned acertain way and put just so in the drawer.”She then told me about her 8-year-old daughter, Laura, who had inflexiblerituals. Before Laura would enter a new room, she would run a finger under hernose and lick her lips. She also became obsessed with locking doors and wouldfrequently lock her brother and sister out of the house.Another psychiatrist was seeing Celina’s 10-year-old son, Samuel, for school andbehavior problems. He was diagnosed with ADD, but the stimulant medication hetook had little effect on him. Samuel also had some obsessive traits: Once hegot a thought in his mind, he was unable to let it go. He would follow Celinaaround the house for two and a half hours, asking her the same questions she hadalready answered.We did a brain SPECT study on both children. They showed the same overactivityin the cingulate gyrus as their mother did. In light of their brain scans, theoverfocusing tendency they all had was no surprise.In addition to the overfocus problems, Celina deactivated her frontal lobes whenshe tried to concentrate, as did Samuel. As a result, Celina had been labeled anunderachiever in school and had difficulty completing projects. Laura, on theother hand, activated her frontal lobes and did not have any school orconcentration problems.Celina’s, Laura’s, and Samuel’s SPECT Results (Top-Down Active View, All withOveractivity in the Anterior Cingulate Gyrus)image [Images/page187a.jpg]motherimage [Images/page187b.jpg]daughterimage [Images/page187c.jpg]sonBased on this information, Celina was placed on the antidepressant Prozac todecrease her depression and obsessive and compulsive tendencies, and on Adderallto help with concentration. She had a dramatically positive response. She saidthat it was the first time in ten years that she felt “herself.” The SPECT studyfurther convinced her that her condition had biological underpinnings: It wasnot her fault or the result of a weak will. This realization allowed her to takeher medication for a longer period of time.Samuel’s psychiatrist used the SPECT results to add Prozac to the stimulantmedication. Within several weeks Samuel’s behavior normalized and he had aremarkable improvement in school. He even made the honor roll for the first timein his life. Several months later Laura was also placed on Prozac and herritualistic behavior markedly diminished. In this family the generationalquality of ADD stands out. The mother’s brain dysfunctions and depressioncontributed to the anxiety and behavior problems in her children, and theabnormal brain metabolism in the children added to their difficult behavior,further stressing the mother. The family dynamics improved significantly afterthe mother and the children were treated with the appropriate medication andpsychotherapy.When I first submitted this family’s case study to a medical journal, one of thereviewers said that it was absurd for me to correlate family dynamics to brainstudies. I think it is absurd not to. The functions of our brains have adramatic effect on how we feel and how we interact with the world.Tim, Pam, Paul, and KarenPaul, age 20, came to see me because he was having trouble finishing his senioryear at UC Berkeley. He was having trouble completing term papers, he could notfocus in class, and he had little motivation. He began to believe that he shoulddrop out of school to go work for his father. He hated the idea of quittingschool so close to graduation, and so he came to see me on a referral from afriend. Paul told me that he had bouts of depression for which he had beenineffectively treated. Paul’s brain SPECT study was consistent with bothdepression and ADD. He had a wonderful response to a combination ofantidepressant and stimulant medications. He finished college and got the kindof job he wanted.When Paul’s mother, Pam, saw what treatment had done for her son, she came tosee me for herself. As a child she had had trouble learning: Even though she wasvery artistic, she had little motivation for school and her teachers labeled heran underachiever. Later, as an adult, Pam went back to school and earned herdegree in elementary-school teaching. In order to student teach, however, shehad to pass the National Teacher’s Exam. She failed four times. Pam was ready togive up and try a new avenue of study, but Paul’s improvement gave her hope thatthere might be help for her. She had a brain study quite similar to Paul’s, andshe responded to the same combination of medication. Four months later shepassed the National Teacher’s Exam.With two successes in the family, the mother then sent her 19-year-old daughter,Karen, to see me. Like her brother, Karen was a bright child who hadunderachieved in school. At the time she came to see me, she lived in LosAngeles and was enrolled in a broadcast journalism course. She complained thatlearning the material was hard for her. She was also moody, restless, easilydistracted, impulsive, and quick to anger. Several years earlier she was treatedfor alcohol and amphetamine abuse. She said that the alcohol settled herrestlessness and the amphetamines helped her to concentrate. Karen’s brain SPECTstudy was very similar to her brother’s and mother’s. Once on medication, shecould concentrate in class. Karen’s level of confidence increased to the pointwhere she could go and look for work as a broadcaster, something she had beenunable to do previously.The most reluctant member of the family to see me was the father, Tim. Eventhough Pam, Paul, and Karen told him that he should see me, he balked at theidea. He said, “There’s nothing wrong with me; look at how successful I am.” Buthis family knew differently. Even though Tim owned a successful grocery store,he was reclusive and distant. He got tired early in the day, he was easilydistracted, and he had a scattered approach to work. His success at workstemmed, in part, from the good people who took his ideas and made them happen.Tim enjoyed high-stimulation activities and loved riding motorcycles, even atthe age of 55. Looking back, Tim had done poorly in high school and barelypassed college, even though he had a very high IQ. Tim’s wife finally convincedhim to see me. Their relationship was on the rocks due to Tim’s difficultycommunicating. She felt that he didn’t care about her. He told me that byevening he was physically and emotionally drained.During my first session with Tim, he told me that he couldn’t possibly have ADDbecause he was a success in business. But the more questions I asked him abouthis past, the more lights went on his head. At the end of the interview I askedhim, “If you really do have ADD, given what you’ve already accomplished, Iwonder how successful you could be if we treat it.” Tim’s brain study showed thepattern for classic ADD. When he tried to concentrate, the frontal lobes of hisbrain shut down.Tim had a remarkable response to Ritalin. He was more awake during the day, heaccomplished more in less time, and his relationship with his wife dramaticallyimproved. In fact, they both said they couldn’t believe that their relationshipcould be so good, after all the years of distance and hurt.Phillip and DennisNine-year-old Phillip was frightened when the police came to his school to talkto him. His teacher had noticed bruises on his legs and arms and called ChildProtective Services. He wasn’t sure if he should tell them that his father,Dennis, had beaten him up, or if he should say that he fell down a flight ofstairs or something like that. Phillip did not want to get his dad into troubleand he felt responsible for the beating he had received. After all, he thought,his father had told him ten times to clean his room and for some reason unknownto Phillip he hadn’t done it. Phillip and his father often fought, but it hadnever been apparent to people outside the home. Phillip decided to tell thetruth, hoping that it would somehow help.Indeed, Phillip’s family did get help. The court ordered the father to undergo apsychiatric evaluation and counseling for the family. The father was found tohave a short fuse. He was impulsive and explosive in many different situations.He had begun to have problems with aggressiveness after he sustained a headinjury in a car accident six years earlier. His wife reported that when Phillipwas first born, the father was loving, patient, and attentive, but after theaccident he was irritable, distant, and angry.In family counseling sessions I noticed that Phillip was restless, active,impulsive, and defiant. The interaction between Phillip and his father was themost troubling. I doubted that counseling alone would be helpful. In an effortto understand further the biology of this family’s problems, I ordered brainSPECT studies on both Phillip and Dennis.Phillip and his father had abnormal SPECT scans. The father showed an area ofdecreased activity in his left temporal lobe near the temple, probably a resultof the car accident. Phillip’s SPECT study revealed decreased activity in thefront part of his brain when he tried to concentrate—a finding consistent withhis impulsive, hyperactive, and conflict-driven behavior.After taking a history, watching the family interact, and reviewing the SPECTstudies, it was clear to me that Phillip’s and his father’s problems were, inlarge part, biological. I placed both of them on medication. The father was puton an antiseizure medication to calm his left temporal lobe, and Phillip wasplaced on a stimulant medication to increase activity in the front part of hisbrain.Once the underlying biological problems were treated, the family was able tobenefit from psychotherapy and begin to heal the wounds of abuse. In counselingsessions Phillip was calmer and more attentive and the father was able to learnhow to deal with Phillip’s difficult behavior.Whenever child abuse occurs, it is a severe tragedy. It may become an even worsetragedy, however, if people ignore the underlying brain problems that may becontributing to the abusive situation. Too often we rush to separate familiesbefore healing the problems that caused the trouble in the first place. In thiscase and in many others, it is often the negative interaction between adifficult child and an aggressive, impulsive parent that leads to the problem:negative interactions that may have a biological basis to them. In these casesit’s no one’s—and certainly not the child’s!—“fault.” To be effective in helpingthese families, it is very important to understand the underlying biological or“brain” contribution to the problem. It is never appropriate to place or leave achild in an abusive situation. However, if the family dynamic can be made tofunction properly, we can avoid compounding the problems.Jack and MonicaJack and Monica had been married eleven years and had two children, ages 6 and9. Both parents were physicians: Jack was an emergency-room doctor, and Monicaan internist. They came to see me from 300 miles away because of chronic maritalproblems. While there had been recent talk of divorce, they wanted to salvagethe marriage for the sake of their children. Jack had been diagnosed with ADD(not uncommon among emergency physicians) by a local psychiatrist several yearsbefore they came to my clinic. Jack was disorganized, impulsive, inattentive,distractible, and forgetful. He did not follow through on his promises. He wasalso bad in business and frequently did not do the paperwork necessary to getreimbursed for his services. Unfortunately, Jack did not have a positiveresponse to Ritalin or Dexedrine. The medications made him moody and irritable.Monica was angry. She blamed every problem in their marriage on Jack’s ADD.There was chronic conflict and tension, exacerbated by the behavior of theiryoungest child, Matthew. He was hyperactive, impulsive, aggressive, and defiant.It seemed that, with their busy schedules and constant stress, the couple couldnever connect in a positive way.During my first session with the couple, I sensed that Monica had an anteriorcingulate problem. She talked about the same point over and over, held grudgesfrom long ago, worried, and tended to argue automatically with everything thatcame out of Jack’s mouth. When I asked about Monica’s family, she told me abouther father, who won first prize for overactive anterior cingulate symptoms. Hewas a physician with whom she shared an office. Monica described him as angry,rigid, and compulsive. If things didn’t go his way, he’d throw things, and hemust have talked about how managed care was ruining medicine at least five timesa day. With such a history, I thought it might be a good idea to scan both Jackand Monica—even Monica’s dad, if he’d let me. Jack and Monica readily agreed.Monica said that if she was part of the problem, she wanted to know about it.Jack’s scan showed decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex and temporallobes. The temporal lobe problems were probably making the stimulantsineffective. I placed Jack on Aricept, a memory-enhancing medication used forAlzheimer’s disease that I have also found helpful for ADD adults who complainof memory problems. In addition, Jack exercised intensely, changed his diet, andalso took L-tyrosine for focus.Monica’s scan showed marked hyperactivity in the anterior cingulate gyrus. Nodoubt she was faced with a tough marriage, but her overactive cingulate was nothelping her have the needed flexibility to roll with the regular ups and downsof living in an ADD family. I started her on St. John’s wort and exercise.In addition, I saw their son Matthew. He had Type 3 (Overfocused) ADD andoppositional defiant disorder. He had decreased prefrontal cortex activity andtoo much activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, a combination of Mom and Dad.I started him on St. John’s wort and Adderall and worked with his parents ondeveloping the parenting skills needed for him. The parent training was a boonto the family. Up to that point they had just used their parenting styledifferences as another way to disagree.Over about six months the family began to heal. There were fewer fights, moreloving interactions, and a deeper understanding of the underlying problems. Jackbecame more focused and his memory was better. Monica became more flexible andable to let go of hurts. Matthew settled down and was becoming happier and morecooperative. After two years I finally got to meet Monica’s father. He came to alecture I gave near his home. After the lecture he came up to me and thanked mefor helping his children. He asked if I was doing any family studies. When Isaid yes, he volunteered for a scan. To no one’s surprise, least of allMonica’s, he had a very overactive anterior cingulate gyrus. He agreed to takeSt. John’s wort and exercise regularly. Within several weeks Monica e-mailed me,thanking me on behalf of three generations for making life less stressful. Shesaid her father was more relaxed, more flexible, and not talking about managedcare.ADD in all its types can affect multiple generations. Understanding familyhistory in light of the ADD types can bring healing and hope for generations offamilies to come."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13SELF-MEDICATION, SELF-POLLUTIONADD and Substance AbuseDrug and alcohol abuse are very common among teenagers and adults with untreatedADD. One study by psychiatrist Joseph Biederman and his colleagues at HarvardUniversity indicated that 52 percent of untreated ADD adults abuse drugs oralcohol. The drugs that they choose to abuse are alcohol and marijuana to settlethe internal restlessness they feel, and cocaine and methamphetamines to feelmore energetic and focused. Nicotine use (cigarettes, cigars, and chewingtobacco) is much more common in people with ADD, as is the intake of largeamounts of caffeine. Nicotine and caffeine are mild stimulants. People with ADDrarely abuse heroin, other opiates, painkillers, or tranquilizers, such asValium. They are generally not stimulating enough to be of much benefit.A common myth in the lay community is that the use of medication to treat ADDchildren somehow predisposes them to drug abuse in later life. The theory isthat giving children or teens medicine to help them with the challenges ADDposes to their daily lives somehow teaches them to abuse substances later on.This theory is false. Both my clinical experience and research show that, infact, the opposite is true: Treating ADD decreases drug or alcohol abuse lateron.Many people with ADD self-medicate (treat their underlying problems) withsubstances as a way to feel more focused, more together, less anxious, lessdepressed, less overwhelmed, and just generally better. Despite the advantages,substance abuse is always bad medicine. Rather than helping, substance abusemakes the ADD symptoms much worse over time. Brain-imaging work has taught usjust how harmful drug abuse is to brain function. Cocaine, methamphetamines,alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, and caffeine decrease brain activity over time,sometimes significantly. When an ADD teen uses alcohol to settle the internalrestlessness she feels, she’s applying a bandage to a wound that will onlyfester. One study done by Dr. Ismael Mena at UCLA showed that cocaine addictshad 23 percent less brain activity overall compared to a group of people who hadnever used drugs. Cocaine addicts in the study who also smoked had 45 percentless activity in their brains. In short, the smokers did not have access tonearly half their brains.In my clinical experience, people with Type 1 (Classic) ADD and Type 2(Inattentive) ADD tend to abuse stimulants, such as cocaine andmethamphetamines; people with Type 3 (Overfocused) ADD tend to abuse alcoholmore frequently; people with Type 4 (Temporal Lobe) and Type 5 (Limbic) ADD tendto be marijuana and stimulant abusers; and people with Type 6 (“Ring of Fire”)ADD tend to abuse alcohol and marijuana.CindyCindy, 42, came to our clinic because she was abusing methamphetamines. She hadfailed a number of treatment programs and was being prevented from seeing herthree children because of her drug problems. In addition, she had just lost thethird job in a year because of tardiness and poor performance.Cindy was depressed. She wanted help but felt stuck and out of control. Cindyhad begun abusing drugs during high school and been off and on them since then.“When I use speed I feel clear and have energy and focus. I hate coming down andI hate that I have to break the law.” It was clear that Cindy had Type 1(Classic) ADD. As a child she was described as hyperactive, restless, impulsive,disorganized, and thrill seeking. She took Ritalin for a brief period of time,but her parents felt uncomfortable giving her medication. They told her that sheneeded to try harder in school.When Cindy learned that adults can have ADD, it gave her hope to seek treatment.I changed her diet, gave her supplements, and put her on Wellbutrin, astimulating antidepressant, often helpful for Type 1 ADD. Due to California law,I could not prescribe Adderall or Ritalin: It is illegal to give a substanceabuser a controlled medication, even though it may be the best treatment. Overthe first four months there were many ups and downs, but Cindy stayed with theprogram and is now four years sober, employed, and able to see her children on aregular basis.JimJim is a tragic story. He was a close friend of mine when I was in the military.At the age of 36 he shot and killed himself. At his funeral his mother told methe following story.As a child, Jim had been like three boys in one. He was hyperactive, impulsive,and had a hard time sitting still. During the elementary-school years, Jim hadtrouble with his behavior in class and on the playground, and his mother wasfrequently called to school. As a teenager he got into minor skirmishes with thelaw and began using alcohol and marijuana. He barely graduated from high school.“He only graduated because I made him stay at his desk until his homework wasdone,” his mother told me.During the Vietnam War, Jim was drafted and spent two years in the Army, wherehe and I met. He was often in trouble with his commander. He had a number ofdisciplinary actions for insubordination and drug abuse. After his discharge, hegot a job with the local sheriff’s office, but he was fired two years later forstealing a shot glass at a local bar when he was drunk. He married and had achild. Unfortunately, his marriage could not stand his emotionally erratic,often intoxicated behavior. After his wife left him, his alcohol consumptionincreased. He got married two more times with the same disastrous results. Afterhe had been fired from a job, in the same year that his last wife left him, andwhile drunk, he shot and killed himself.Looking back on Jim’s life, through the eyes of a child psychiatrist, I have nodoubt he had had ADD. When we were together he was fun and impulsive, but Ioften had to keep him focused, and I worked hard to keep him out of trouble.Inside he was a very loving and giving man. He just couldn’t be consistent. Thealcohol settled his restlessness but ruined his life.JoseIn a highly publicized Bay Area case, Jose, a 16-year-old gang member, wasarrested after he and another gang member beat another teenager nearly to death.They were charged with attempted murder. One evening, when they were in anintoxicated state (from both alcohol and heavy marijuana usage), they approacheda boy wearing a red sweater walking his dog across the street. They asked him,“What colors do you bang?” (referring to gang affiliation). When the boy said hedid not know what they were talking about, Jose replied, “Wrong answer.” Yousee, Jose’s gang claimed the color red. The two gang boys started hitting andkicking their victim repeatedly until he was unconscious. Other gang membersdescribed pulling Jose off the boy because “once he started he didn’t stop.”They were worried he would kill the boy.The public defender ordered neuropsychological testing on Jose, which foundfrontal lobe dysfunction and evidence of ADD, depression, and learningdisabilities. The psychologist suggested a resting and concentration SPECTseries for independent verification. The SPECT series was significantlyabnormal. Both studies showed marked increased activity in the anteriorcingulate gyrus, consistent with problems shifting attention. At rest, his SPECTalso showed mildly suppressed prefrontal cortex activity. While doing aconcentration task, Jose showed marked suppression of the prefrontal cortex andboth temporal lobes, consistent with types 1, 3, and 5 ADD, learningdisabilities, and aggressive tendencies.Jose had a long history of problems shifting attention. He was described byothers as “brooding,” argumentative, and oppositional. “Once he got a thought inhis head,” his father said, “he would talk about it over and over.” In prison hewas placed on Zoloft (a serotonergic antidepressant to calm his cingulate) andCylert (to activate his prefrontal cortex). He felt calmer, more focused, andless easily upset.Jose’s SPECT Results (Left-Side Active and Underside Surface Views)image [Images/page199a.jpg]3-D active side view (marked increased cingulate activity)image [Images/page199b.jpg]at rest (mild decreased prefrontal cortex activity)image [Images/page199c.jpg]with concentration (marked decreased prefrontal cortex and temporal lobeactivity)DavidA friend of mine came to visit me from another state. He said that he hadgrowing trouble concentrating and that his energy was low. I knew he smokedthree packs of cigarettes and drank at least three pots of coffee every day. Fora long time I suspected he had ADD (he underachieved in school, did impulsivethings, and could never sit still) and that he was medicating himself with thestimulant affects of caffeine and nicotine. But he was the CEO of a verysuccessful corporation and not used to taking advice, even from people he knewcared about him. I told him about ADD and said that it would be a good idea totreat it and stop self-medicating. He didn’t want to take medication, he toldme. Didn’t I have a natural treatment for it? A bit amazed, I said, “You aredoing the natural treatments for ADD—caffeine and nicotine. They’ll kill youeventually. My medication is more effective, and when it is used properly, itdoesn’t kill anyone.”I felt SPECT images of his brain might help him see the reality of the situationand encourage him to stop. Even I was surprised by how bad his brain looked. Hehad marked decreased activity across the whole cortex, especially in the areasof the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes. I told my friend that he needed tofind another way to stimulate his brain. If he didn’t stop the caffeine andnicotine, he wasn’t going to have much of a brain left to enjoy his success. Hetook my advice for a few weeks, but shortly after he returned home he went backto his old ways. I couldn’t get through to him—even with his frightening brainscans. Even though I recommended that he try brain stimulants, such as Ritalinor Adderall, he wanted to treat his ADD naturally—with exactly those drugs thatwere making the problem even worse.David’s Concentration SPECT Study (Underside Surface View)image [Images/page200.jpg]marked overall decreased activity, especially in prefrontal cortex and temporallobesSUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ADD TREATMENT ISSUESADD treatment issues are often complicated by substance abuse. As mentioned, asmany as half of ADD adults have substance abuse issues. Yet, many physiciansfeel very uncomfortable prescribing controlled substances like Ritalin orAdderall to people who have addiction problems. In my experience thesemedications are rarely abused by people with ADD, but one must be careful withthis population. In the state of California it is illegal to give controlledmedication to someone who has a substance abuse problem. This law puts thephysician and ADD patient in a precarious situation. For types 1 and 2 ADD,stimulants are the treatment of choice, and they may be the only interventionthat works. If we cannot give patients the most effective treatment, they maynot be able to stay away from the substances they abuse to self-medicate. It’s acatch-22.In my practice I weigh the pros and cons of each intervention. IfI am going to treat someone who is actively abusing drugs, I will not use astimulant medication until they are in a treatment program and have shown aprolonged commitment to sobriety. InsteadI’ll prescribe stimulating antidepressants, supplements, and dietaryinterventions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14THE GAMES ADD PEOPLE PLAY“Let’s Have a Problem”“I Bet I Can Get You to Yell at Me or Hit Me”“My Thoughts Are More Terrible Than Your Thoughts”“It’s Your Fault”“No, No Way, Never, You Can’t Make Me Do it”“I Say the Opposite of What You Say”“I Say the First Thing That Comes to Mind”“Let’s Call It Even”“Fighting as Foreplay” Many people with ADD unconsciously, based on brain-driven (not will-driven)mechanisms, play ADD games as a way to boost adrenaline and stimulate theirfrontal lobes. These games just seem to happen. No one plans for them to happen.Most ADD people deny that they engage in these behaviors. However, I have seenthese games in my own family, and I’ve heard about them from my patients formany years. Let’s look at each of these games in depth.“LET’S HAVE A PROBLEM”Without enough stimulation, the brain looks for ways to increase its ownactivity. Being mad, upset, angry, or negative has an immediate stimulatingeffect on the brain. Whenever you get upset, your body produces increasingamounts of adrenaline, which stimulates heart rate, blood pressure, muscletension, and, yes, brain activity. Many people with ADD pick on others to get arise out of them, to get them upset, to make them crazy. All too often, familymembers of my patients tell me they are tired of the problems in their families.They say, “I’m so tired of fighting with my brother [sister, mother, father,son, daughter, etc.]. Why does there have to be this turmoil? Can’t he [she] behappy with peaceful coexistence? Does he [she] have to fight? He [she] alwayshas to have a problem!”Joshua and Betsy were married for three years before they entered maritalcounseling. Betsy forced Joshua to get help. He didn’t see any problems andinitially refused to see the therapist, but Betsy was beside herself. It seemedto her that they fought nearly all the time. She never felt at peace, never feltthat they could have an evening or weekend during which Joshua didn’t complainabout something. Even though Joshua was successful in his own business, hefrequently complained about his employees. Betsy, who also worked with him, sawthat he would regularly select an employee to pick on or engage in some kind ofbattle. After an extensive in-take interview, the therapist saw Joshua’sconflict-seeking behavior as only one of his many ADD symptoms, includingdisorganization, distractibility, and impulsivity. She referred Joshua for apsychiatric evaluation and worked with the couple on strategies to recognize andstop this destructive game.Rosemary and Chrissy, mother and 16-year-old daughter, constantly fought. Itdidn’t seem to matter about what: It could be curfew, clothes, music, tone ofvoice—whatever. I met Chrissy when she was brought to our clinic for evaluationbecause of troubles at school. During the initial interview with Chrissy and herparents, I watched the two females go after each other. The tone between themwas contentious, mutually irritating, and on edge. The father wearily told me,“This is how they live at home. Everything is an issue. Everything is a problem.They both hold on to their own positions and cannot let go. It’s as if they haveto irritate each other. I often don’t want to come home because I know I’ll haveto listen to their battles.” In the evaluation process Chrissy was diagnosedwith overfocused ADD (school struggles, inattention, impulsivity, restlessness,and oppositional and argumentative behavior), as was her mother, who had grownup in an alcoholic home, struggled in school, and complained of low energy,disorganization, procrastination, and forgetfulness. After they were bothtreated for overfocused ADD, the tension diminished dramatically. The need forconflict diminished and everyone felt less stressed and more comfortable athome.“I BET I CAN GET YOU TO YELL AT ME OR HIT ME”A similar game to “Let’s Have a Problem” is “I Bet I Can Get You to Yell At Meor Hit Me.” Many people with ADD are masterful at getting others to scream,yell, spank, and basically fly out of control. They get others so upset thatthey cannot help but lose it.These negative behaviors provide quite an adrenaline rush but frequently lead toserious negative consequences, such as divorce,fights at school, unemployment, and even abuse. Again, the game is unconscious,not planned. It seems as if the ADD person senses the most vulnerable issues forothers, and they work on them until there is an explosion.Bonnie had been diagnosed with Inattentive ADD at age 12.The only treatment she received was medication, which she took sporadically.Now, at age 15, she was struggling in school and had problems with her parentsat home. She also fought with a number of her teachers. On top of all this, theparents were furious at the school because one of the teachers had yelled at herto shut up and sit down in class a number of months earlier. The teacher wasdisciplined by the school for the outbursts, but she said that she just couldn’ttake Bonnie’s lack of respect and disruptive behavior. During Bonnie’s initialevaluation in our clinic, her father cried, saying,“I never thought I would have such negative feelings and behaviors toward my ownchild. I just start screaming at her, because she says terrible things. Sheknows every hot button I have, and I feel like she intentionally pushes them ona regular basis. Sometimes I understand why parents abandon their children. Theyjust can’t take the negative feelings, the lack of respect, and the constantfighting.”Jesse, age 6, had parents who did not believe in spanking. They werewell-educated people who discussed how they would raise their child even beforehe was born. Yet, even though they didn’t want to use spanking, they often foundthemselves on the edge of losing control. They yelled more than they wanted to,and they found themselves using physical punishment on impulse because theywould get so frustrated with Jesse’s misbehavior. Jesse was impulsive and seemeddriven to turmoil. Ironically, the parents found out that when they yelled orspanked him, his behavior would be better for a while. The mother told me, “Ifwe have a bad morning at home, he has a good day at school. If we have a kind,loving morning at home, then he seems to have a bad day at school.” I diagnosedJesse with Classic ADD: He had the full cluster of symptoms. Besides treatinghim medically, I worked with his parents on effective parenting strategies. Iwarned them that as soon as they stopped yelling at Jesse, he would get worsefor several weeks. It was as if he were going through adrenaline withdrawal. Theparents’ yelling, screaming, and hitting were stimulating to him, and he,unknowingly, used their anger to feel more alert, which is why he did better inschool if they had a bad morning at home.Evan and Alexa, ages 15 and 12, were a brother and sister at war. Evan wasdiagnosed with Classic ADD when he was ten years old and Alexa had only recentlybeen diagnosed with Overfocused ADD. The parents brought them to our clinic formedication and family therapy evaluations. The siblings seemed to be masterfulat upsetting each other. They had been at odds for as long as anyone couldremember. On one occasion—the one that precipitated the referral—Evan, came intoAlexa’s bedroom to borrow a CD. Alexa screamed at him to get out. When Evanrefused, she threw a speaker at him. Evan attacked her, leaving bruises all overher body.It is essential to stop playing both “Let’s Have a Problem” and “I Bet I Can GetYou to Yell at Me or Hit Me” if an ADD person is to live happily with others.When I teach parents, siblings, and spouses to become less reactive and not tofeed the need for adrenaline with anger, the ADD person may initially get worse.It seems as though the ADD person goes through withdrawal when others becomemore understanding or more tolerant, at least initially. When the ADD person canno longer get the adrenaline anger rush, he’ll go after it full force,escalating the outrageous behavior. But if a parent, sibling, or spouse canremain nonreactive for a long enough period of time, the conflict-drivenbehavior usually diminishes significantly. Nevertheless, they will periodicallytest the “nonreactive skill” of the people in their environments by seekingintense emotional reactions. Others have to remain on guard to keep thesenegative behaviors away.“MY THOUGHTS ARE MORE TERRIBLE THAN YOUR THOUGHTS”Psychiatrist and brain-imaging specialist Mark George at the National Institutesof Health demonstrated, in a landmark study, that negative thoughts have astimulating effect on the brain. Using functional brain-imaging studies, helooked at brain activity while people were thinking about something neutral,something positive, and something awful. The neutral thoughts did not changebrain activity. The positive thoughts cooled overall brain activity, especiallyin the limbic area of the brain—certainly not good for ADD folks, who have poorbrain activity to begin with. The negative thoughts, however, brought brainactivation, especially in the limbic areas (making them more depressed) and inthe prefrontal cortex (helping them focus).Clinically, I have seen that many ADD people seem to be experts at picking outthe most negative thoughts possible and staying focused on them for prolongedperiods of time. It is almost as if they need the negativity to have the mentalenergy to function. When I started to talk about this idea to colleagues at myclinic, Jonathan, a marriage, family, and child therapist who has ADD, said, “Ithink I do that myself. I wake up thinking about the most horrific things thatcould happen during the day. I feel anxious, but it motivates me to get up andget moving.”You have probably noticed the people who play this game at work: If ten goodthings and one bad thing happen, most of their thoughts are focused on the badthing. These are the people who complain, gossip, find fault, undermine, and pitpeople against each other. In meetings they disagree and find fault. Asmanagers, they are often the ones who notice the negative much more than thepositive.The negativity often associated with ADD frequently ruins lives. Few people aredrawn closer to people who are negative, complaining, or filled with anxiousthoughts. Many ADD people who unknowingly play this game end up isolated,lonely, depressed, and even more negative. People who are isolated from othershave a higher incidence of both physical and emotional problems.Some time ago, one of the physicians who worked in my office went through aperiod during which he was one of the most negative human beings I had ever met.He always had a sour look on his face. Every time I saw him he complainednonstop about office procedures and personnel. He was negative with patients. Hehadn’t exhibited this behavior when I hired him. I found myself avoiding him inthe hallway and feeling frustrated by his behavior. After several weeks of thisbehavior I told him to come into my office. He started the meeting bycomplaining about a front-office issue without first wanting to know why I askedto see him. Immediately I stopped him, saying, “I don’t know what is going onwith you, but something is different. You complain nonstop about nearlyeverything. People are avoiding you and patients don’t want to see you anymore.”The doctor then told me that he had ADD and that he had decided to stop hismedication a month ago. He didn’t know why he had stopped it, but when hestarted taking it again, the negativity problem subsided.Many people with ADD who play the game of “My Thoughts Are More Terrible ThanYour Thoughts” end up isolated. Be careful with negativity. This is a damagingand dangerous game.“IT’S YOUR FAULT”Another common game played by many people with ADD is “It’s Your Fault.” Thismay be the most dangerous ADD game of all. In it the ADD person reasons that heor she has little, if anything, to do with the problems in his or her own life.Any problem is someone else’s fault. Frequently, I hear that these people do notperform properly at school, at work, or within their families because of “thelousy boss,” “the ineffective teacher,” or “the mean brother [or sister].” Thisgame can completely ruin a life. Whenever you blame someone else for theproblems in your own life, you become a victim of that other person and you haveno power to change anything.Without a sense of personal power, people often feel overwhelmed and hopeless.Billie Jean came into my office blaming nearly everyone in her life. Her husbandmistreated her, her children neglected her, her boss was mean to her, and herdoctor (not me, thankfully) didn’t take her seriously. When she was late to anappointment, it was because of traffic; when she missed a payment, it wasbecause she hadn’t gotten her mail. There was an excuse for everything. Gently,I started to ask her what she could do to make these situations better—with herhusband, children, job, and everyone else in her life.This process was critical for her emotional health. Unless she tookresponsibility for her emotions and reactions, she would always be at the mercyof others. Her tendency to blame was a way to feel angry and entitled so thatshe could use that anger as a stimulant.Eliminating blame and asking herself, “What can I do to make the situationbetter?” was one of the most important parts of her healing process.Watch out for the “It’s Your Fault” game. It may ruin your life.“NO, NO WAY, NEVER, YOU CAN’T MAKE ME DO IT”Opposition also increases adrenaline in the ADD brain. Many people with ADD,especially Type 3, tend to be argumentative and oppositional with people intheir lives. These negative behaviors often cause tension and turmoil infamilies, in relationships, or at work. Many parents tell me they are tired ofarguing with their children. This game has one simple rule: I ask you to dosomething, and you say no. I frequently ask my patients: “How many times out often, when your mother [father, teacher, boss] asks you to do something, will youdo it the first time without arguing or fighting?” Many of my patients tend tolook down at the floor when I ask this question. They quietly say, “Not manytimes, maybe two or three times out of ten.” I then ask them why. They tell methey have no idea why they do it, that it is not their goal to be oppositional.I had a very interesting session recently. I saw a 10-year-old boy for the firsttime. He came into my office with his mother. He immediately sat down on my blueleather couch and put his shoes on it. (That doesn’t bother me: I figure that ifyou see difficult kids, you have to have an office that will stand up to them).The shoes on the couch bothered his mother, however. She told him to put themdown. When he refused, she put them down on the floor. He immediately put themback up on the sofa. She looked at me in frustration and then moved her son’sfeet back on the floor. He put them up. She put them down. He put them up again.She put them down again and slapped his leg. This went on and on. I watched tosee the interaction between them. He wanted his way. She was determined not togive in, but she engaged in the same repetitive ineffective behavior. She wouldhave done better by cutting the oppositional behavior right away and give animmediate, unemotional, but firm consequence. After about ten minutes of thisbehavior I asked the boy if it was his plan to upset his mother. He said no.Then I asked him why he had to do the opposite of what she wanted. He said, likeso many of these kids do, “I don’t know.”The unconscious game of “No, No Way, Never, You Can’t Make Me Do It” can isolatea person. The level of opposition drives others away, causing them to makenegative judgments about you. While writing this book, I went to Israel to speakat an international ADD conference. At the conference I had the pleasure tospend time with a family who had come to see me in California. The 11-year-oldboy had been depressed when he came to my clinic. Through his history and ourscans we were able to diagnose him properly, put him on the right medication,and help the family with the right behavioral strategies. He made a wonderfulimprovement. The child and his mother joined my daughter and me on a trip toJerusalem. The souvenir shops caught the boy’s attention. He wanted achessboard. The mother said no. He asked again. She said no again. This went onfor about thirty minutes. I watched. Finally the boy asked me how he could gethis mother to get him a chessboard. I said, “You don’t want to hear my answer.”He said he really wanted my help. I told him (with his mother listening), “Ifyour mom gets you what you want after she has already told you no fifteen times,then she is teaching you to get your way by irritating other people. You’ll bedifficult and no one will want to be with you, because you will have to haveyour way.” He put his hands over his mother’s ears so she wouldn’t hear any moreof my advice. Later he said, “Dr. Amen, you are right. I don’t like people whoare pests. I’ll try not to be one.”You cannot let people badger you or irritate you into getting their way. If youallow this game to work, it sets up serious social problems. No one likessomeone who argues with everything they say or opposes them most of the time.“I SAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU SAY”Here’s another destructive ADD game. Let’s call it “I Say the Opposite of WhatYou Say.” This game is similar to “No, No Way, Never, You Can’t Make Me Do It,”but it involves speech more than behavior. The people who play this game take aposition opposite to that of the other person in the conversation. For example,if your spouse complains that you do not listen to him or her, you deny it andthen say that he or she does not listen to you. If a parent tells a child toclean his messy room, he or she is likely to say that the room isn’t messy. If aperson takes a view on a political position, you will take the opposite position(even if it is against what you really believe). The need for opposition seemsto be more important than the truth. The back-and-forth disagreement brings moreadrenaline, stress, and irritation to the table. Watch out for this game. Itpushes people away from you.It seems to me that politicians in the United States and abroad are masters atthis game. I have often thought that many politicians have ADD. If a Democrathas a good idea, the Republicans will automatically put it down; and if aRepublican offers a helpful plan, the Democrats will automatically look for waysto shoot holes in it. Cooperation is so foreign to the political process it is awonder anything gets done. Unfortunately, this same dynamic happens in many ADDhomes.“I SAY THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND”Many of my patients struggle with the game of “I Say the First Thing That Comesto Mind.” I have heard a number of my patients say, “I am brutally honest.” Theywear this trait as if it were a badge of courage. I usually reply to them thatbrutal honesty is usually not helpful. Relationships require tact.Recently, I walked out into my waiting room to greet an 8-year-old patient. Iwas about ten minutes late for the appointment.When she saw me she said, “Well it’s about damn time.” Her mother lookedhorrified and apologized for the little girl’s comment. Living in an ADDhousehold, I knew comments like that were just part of the terrain.This game causes many, many problems. When you just say thefirst thing that comes to mind, you can hurt someone’s feelings, infuriate acustomer, or give away secrets that were entrusted to you.One of my patients was charged with bringing a friend to a surprise party in thefriend’s honor. On the way to the party my patient inadvertently started talkingabout how much fun the party would be. It was only when he saw the look on hisfriend’s face that he figured out he had ruined the surprise.“LET’S CALL IT EVEN”Many people with ADD play a deflection game titled “Let’s Call It Even.” In thisgame, whenever someone else has a complaint or criticism, the player also adoptsthat complaint as his or her own. For example, if a husband is unhappy that thehouse isn’t clean, his wife (the player) complains that he doesn’t help enough.If a wife complains that her husband doesn’t listen enough, the husband willcomplain about the same thing. If a sibling says that her sister goes into herroom and takes things, the sister will say she does that because her sister doesit too.“FIGHTING AS FOREPLAY”Many couples whom I have seen through the years have described a fascinating ADDgame I call “Fighting as Foreplay.” In this game there is an intense fight, thena period of making up, which includes making love. The swing of emotions isquick and dramatic. One minute you are fighting, talking about divorce and readyto leave the relationship, the next moment you are making wild, passionate loveand feeling blissful. It’s confusing to the participants but makes somebiological sense. The fight is needed for stimulation. Once stimulated, you areready for love. All of these games are very destructive in ADD relationships. The first step ineliminating these games is to notice them. The treatment guidelines given inparts III and IV of this book will go over ways to get out of the games ADDpeople play."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15THE IMPACT OF ADD ON RELATIONSHIPS, FAMILIES, SCHOOL, WORK, AND SELF-ESTEEMADD impacts all aspects of life. In this chapter I’ll list some of the mostcommon complaints patients and their families bring into my office.RELATIONSHIPSFor a child, teen, or adult, ADD often has a negative impact on a person’sability to interact with others. Here are some of the reasons:Social IsolationMany people with ADD have failed in relationships so many times in the past thatthey don’t want to experience the pain anymore. They avoid relationships or theymake excuses to be by themselves.TeasingPeople with ADD are often teased by others. Their behavior brings negativeattention to themselves. Additionally, the impulsivity and conflict-drivennature causes them to tease others, sometimes to the point where the otherperson becomes very upset.FightingFighting is typical for many people with ADD. It may be related to impulsivity(saying things without thinking), stimulation-seeking behavior, misperceptions,rage outbursts, and chronically low self-esteem. The fighting leads to chronicstress for the person with ADD and those in his or her family.MisperceptionsMisperceptions often cause serious problems in relationships. Often the parentor spouse of an ADD person has to spend an inordinate amount of time correctingmisperceptions that lead to disagreements.DistractibilityDue to distractibility, conversations are often cut short or left incomplete,leaving the other person feeling unimportant. When a person is distracted, he orshe may miss large chunks of conversations and may unconsciously fill in missingpieces with negative information.Problems Taking TurnsThe ADD person’s need to have what they want right away often causes problems insituations in which they need to take turns, such as in conversations or games.Speaking Without ThinkingThis is perhaps the most damaging problem with ADD in relationships. Justbecause a person has a thought doesn’t mean that it is accurate or that he orshe even necessarily believes it. Many people with ADD just say what comes tomind. They then get stuck in defending those statements, causing furtherproblems.Problems Completing ChoresEven though the person with ADD wants to finish what he or she starts,distractibility gets in the way, and many things may be left half done. Thisleads to many resentments, arguments, and frustrations felt by others.Difficulty Playing or Being QuietOften the level of activity or noise created by the ADD person causesfrustration and irritability in others.Sensitivity to NoiseAt the same time the ADD person may also be sensitive to noise. They often needto escape from others to feel calm or peaceful inside.Sensitivity to TouchWhen the person is sensitive to touch, they often shy away from affection. Thiscan harm a relationship, especially if the person’s partner wants or needsaffection.Excessive TalkingSometimes people with ADD talk for self-stimulation. There is an internal driveto go on and on. This may irritate others, who feel that they cannot get a wordin the conversation.Lack of Emotional ExpressionThe partners of some ADD people complain that there is little talking oremotional expression in the relationship. “He [She] seems turned off when hecomes home” is a common complaint. Often parents will ask their children abouttheir day and the only response they’ll get is “Fine” or “Okay.” These kids areoften called nonelaborators.DisorganizationThis causes problems in a relationship because the ADD person often doesn’t liveup to his or her part of the chores or agreements.High-Risk Taking/Thrill SeekingThis type of behavior worries the parents, partners, or friends of the ADDperson. Friends often feel pressured to go along with dangerous behavior,causing a rift in the relationship.Easy Frustration/Emotionalism/MoodinessMany family members of ADD children, teens, and adults have told me that theynever know what to expect from the ADD person. “One minute she’s happy, the nextminute she’s screaming” is a common complaint. Small amounts of stress maytrigger huge explosions.Tantrums/Rage OutburstsSome studies have reported that up to 85 percent of people with ADD have rageoutbursts, often with little provocation. After this occurs several times in arelationship, the parent, partner, or friend becomes “gun shy” and starts towithdraw from the person. Untreated ADD is often involved in abusiverelationships.Low Self-EsteemWhen people do not feel good about themselves, it impairs their ability torelate to others. They have difficulty taking compliments or getting outside ofthemselves to truly understand the other person. The brain filters informationcoming in from the environment. When the brain’s filter (self-esteem) isnegative, people tend to see only the negative and ignore any positive. Manypartners of ADD people complain that when they give their partners a compliment,the latter find a way to make it look as if they have just been criticized.Looking for TurmoilThis is a common complaint of people living with someone who has ADD. They saythat the person looks for trouble. Rather than ignoring a minor incident, he orshe focuses on it and has difficulty letting it go. Things in an ADD house donot remain peaceful for long periods of time.Chronic Anxiety or RestlessnessAs mentioned above, ADD people often feel restless or anxious, causing them tosearch for ways to relax. They may use excessive sex, food, or alcohol to try tocalm themselves. I treated one man who had had sex with his girlfriend over 500times in the last year of their relationship. She left him because she felt thattheir relationship was only based upon sex.Failure to See Others’ NeedsMany people with ADD have trouble thinking of anyone but themselves. Blind tothe emotional needs of others, they are often labeled spoiled, immature, orself-centered.Failure to Learn from the PastOften people with ADD engage in repetitive, negative arguments with others. Theyseem not to learn from the interpersonal mistakes from the past and repeat themagain and again.Chronic ProcrastinationThe ADD person often waits until the very last minute to get things done (payingbills; buying birthday, anniversary, or Christmas gifts; etc.). This mayirritate those around them who feel the need to pick up the loose pieces.FAMILIESADD often causes serious problems in families. I have seen “caring” familiesfall apart because of the turmoil caused by having an ADD child. I have alsoseen many couples who “truly loved each other” divorce because of the stress ofone or both partners having ADD. Many of the issues listed in the previoussection apply here. Here are several other important issues to consider:Drive Toward TurmoilADD children and teenagers are often experts at getting their parents to yell atthem. As I mentioned above, the ADD person often has decreased activity in theirfrontal lobes. They “unconsciously” seek stimulation to feel more awake oralert. In a family, this takes on many forms, such as temper tantrums, noise,and high activity.Parental SplittingADD kids may also be skilled at getting their parents to fight with each other.Splitting parental authority gives children and teenagers too much power andincreases the turmoil. Often the scenario is that the mother will blame thefather for being “too absent” or “too harsh,” and the father will blame themother for being “too inconsistent” and “too soft.” Of course, this goes bothways. I have seen many couples separate, in part to stop the turmoil they livedin at home.Negative ExpectationsIn families with an ADD child, teen, or adult there is often the expectationthat there will be problems. As a result, people begin to avoid each other. Forexample, a woman recently told me she expected that her ADD husband wouldn’twash the dinner dishes as he had promised. Before he even had a chance to dothem, she resentfully cleaned them. She was angry at him for the rest of thenight, even though she hadn’t given him a chance to be helpful.Feelings of ParentsDenial: “There’s nothing wrong with the child! He only needs more time, moreattention, more discipline, more love, a better teacher, a better school, afirmer mother, a father who is more available.” These are common excuses parentsmake to deny that any problem exists. Admitting that there is a problem is oftenso painful that many parents go years and years without seeking help. Denial canseriously harm a child’s or teen’s chances for success! Grief: There is often a grieving process that occurs in a family with anuntreated ADD person. The parents or spouse often feel the loss of not having a“normal” child, teen, or spouse and end up feeling very sad that the situationis not as they expected it would be. On Guard: For many parents, living with an ADD child is like being in a warzone. They have to be constantly on guard that the child won’t run out into thestreet, break something at the store, or run off at a park. This chronicwatchfulness causes much internal tension for parents. Guilt: Guilt is a significant issue for many people who live with those who haveADD. The turmoil that an ADD child, teen, or adult causes often brings on badfeelings. Parents or spouses are not “supposed” to have bad feelings towardpeople they love and so end up burdened by feelings of guilt. In the treatmentsection I’ll discuss how to break the cycle of guilt. Anger: Anger at teachers, doctors, day care workers, and the other parent iscommon in parents with an ADD child. The levels of frustration are so high inthese families that people look for someone at whom to blow off steam. Envy: “Why can’t we have normal kids? We didn’t do anything to deserve theturmoil. It’s not fair.” Blame: “You spoil him. How’s he ever going to learn if you do everything forhim?” “You’re too soft on her.” “You never say a kind word to him.” “If only youwould be home more: Then we wouldn’t have these problems with her.” Blame isvery destructive and rarely if ever helpful. Yet, it is all too common in ADDfamilies. Isolation: “Everyone thinks I’m a bad parent. No one else has these problems. Ican’t go anywhere with him, I’m stuck at home.” Feelings of isolation are verycommon. Many parents of ADD children feel that they are the only ones in theworld who have these problems. Joining a support group can be very helpful forthese people. Bargaining: “Maybe she’ll be OK if we put her in a new school.” “Maybe if we puthim in outside activities, his attitude will improve.” “Maybe if I leave hisfather, we’ll all feel better.” Many parents of ADD children attribute theirproblems to outside forces and feel that making radical lifestyle changes willhelp. Without the right treatment, however, these changes are rarely helpful. Depression: “I’m a failure as a parent. I’ve failed my child. I have no businessraising children. I should go to work and leave him with a sitter. I’m so tiredthat I can’t do this anymore.” The physical and emotional drain of having an ADDchild can often trigger a significant depression. Watch your moods.Sibling IssuesChildren with ADD often irritate their siblings to the point of causing tears,anger, or fights. Siblings develop negative feelings toward the ADD childbecause they are often embarrassed by the child’s outrageous behavior at schoolor with friends.Since ADD, for the most part, is a genetic disorder, it is more likely thatsiblings may also have features of ADD. Having two or more members of a familywith untreated ADD can completely disorganize the family.Oftentimes in families with an ADD child, there is an identified “good” childand a “bad” (ADD) child. Because the parents’ self-esteem is so damaged byhaving an unrecognized ADD child, they will often avoid the ADD child to focus alot of positive energy on the other child and think that they are more “perfect”than they really are. This causes resentment in the ADD child. It also causesthe “perfect” child to subvert any progress that the ADD child might make. Coreyand Sarah were an example of this “sibling subversion.”Corey, 9, had a severe case of ADD. He would throw three-hour temper tantrums,had problems nearly every day in school, and was chronically noncompliant withhis mother. Six-year-old Sarah, with long, curly red hair, was her mother’sangel. She could do no wrong. With treatment, Corey began to improvesignificantly. But in therapy Corey told me that his little sister was “flippinghim off” with her middle finger. When he told his mother, she did not believehim, saying, “Sarah wouldn’t do that, she’s too sweet.” I told the mother towatch them secretly when they were playing together. Sure enough, Sarah wasusing her middle finger to drive Corey crazy. She was having difficulty losingher place in the family as the “perfect” child, and she had a stake in Coreyremaining a problem.Feelings of Brothers and SistersEmbarrassment: Just as parents are blamed by neighbors for the unacceptablebehavior of their child, so brothers and sisters are often held responsible orridiculed by their peers for the actions of their ADD sibling. Anger: An ADD child can evoke intense emotions in his or her brother or sister. Resentment: A sibling may feel very resentful at being labeled “weirdo’s sister”or having a child come up and say, “Hey, do you know what your brother did?” Put-upon: Siblings feel urged to include the ADD child in their play andfree-time activities. He or she often has few friends of their own and it’snatural for parents to seek relief. Guilt: Like parents, siblings often feel guilty about emotions they harbor. Theycare deeply in spite of the behavior they live with. Out of Control: Brothers and sisters find it difficult to engage the ADD childin play without constant struggles over rules and issues of control. They maystrike out at the ADD child as a result of being constantly frustrated. Jealousy: Siblings often question the double standards that exist in the rulesthat they are governed by. Although his or her behavior doesn’t warrant it, theADD child is often rewarded as a way of pacifying him or her at the time.SCHOOLWhether for children, teenagers, or adults, ADD has a powerful negative impacton a person’s ability to do well in school. Except for classes that are small orhighly interesting, many people with ADD have significant problems. Here is alist of common school problems.RestlessnessThe hyperactivity that often accompanies ADD in childhood causes obviousproblems: The child is restless, out of his or her seat, irritating other kids(not to mention the teacher), and causing turmoil and disruption in his or herpath. In teens and adults, the restlessness of ADD often distracts others inclass who notice the constant movement (e.g., legs shaking and shifting bodyposture in seats).Short Attention Span and DistractibilityHaving a short attention span and being easily distracted affects nearly everyaspect of school. This will affect a student’s ability to follow teachers inlectures, participate in small groups, and perform consistently on tests. Theshort attention span often causes the ADD students’ attention to wander whilereading or performing class assignments, causing them to take an inordinateamount of time to finish tasks. Distractibility also may get ADD students introuble, as they tend to be in everyone else’s business.ImpulsivenessImpulsiveness causes serious school problems. Blurting out answers in class,responding impulsively on quizzes or tests, and saying things without thinkingare typical. I’ve treated many people with ADD who were “tactless” in how theyresponded to their teachers or professors. One teenager said to her teacher,“You’re a lousy teacher! I don’t know why you explain things like that, but theother teachers know how to explain things a lot better than you do.” All of ushave had that thought about certain teachers at one time or another. Mostpeople, however, would never blurt out a statement like that because it wouldhurt the teacher’s feelings and harm their relationship. But with ADD, the mouthis often engaged before the brain.ProcrastinationMany people with ADD wait until the last minute to complete their tasks forschool. If it isn’t the night before, they cannot get their brain upset enoughto get their work done. Many parents have told me about the constant fights theyhave with their children or teens about starting projects early and working onthem over time, rather than the night before. Many adults have told me that theynever did term papers on time or they used amphetamines the night before thework was due to get it done. Procrastination in school caused the work to bedone poorly or left undone or incomplete.Trouble Shifting AttentionAs I mentioned above, there is a group of people with ADD who have troubleshifting their attention from one thing to another. They have a tendency to get“stuck” or overfocus. This characteristic can be particularly troublesome inschool. For these students, taking notes is often a disaster. Note takingrequires constant shifts in attention: from teacher to paper to teacher topaper, etc.ForgetfulnessThis symptom often upsets the parents and teachers of ADD students. Forgettingto bring home books, leaving clothes at school, and not turning in homeworkassignments are common complaints.Learning DisabilitiesLearning difficulties and disabilities are very common in people with ADD. It isessential to recognize and treat these disabilities if a student is going toperform at his or her potential. Common disabilities are writing disabilities(getting thoughts from the brain to the paper), reading disabilities (shiftingor reversing letters or numbers), and visual-and auditory-processing problems(trouble accurately hearing what was said).Unusual Study HabitsMany people with ADD have unusual study habits. Most need a very quiet place tostudy. I know someone who used to sit in her car under a streetlight to study.She needed an environment that was absolutely quiet and free from distractions.Other people with ADD need noise in order to study. Some people have told methey need the TV or radio on or some other sort of noise to keep themselvesfocused.Timed SituationsTimed testing situations spell disaster for those with ADD. Whether it is shortmath exercises, classroom writing tasks, or testing situations (standardized andotherwise), the time pressure these situations engender can paralyze those withADD.WORKBill, 32, had just been fired from a job he loved. He knew it was his fault, buthe just couldn’t organize his time to do the work that was expected. He misseddeadlines, drifted off in meetings, and was often late to work. His wife wasgoing to be furious. This was the third job he had lost in their three-yearmarriage. As a child, Bill had taken Ritalin for troubles in school, but he wastaken off the medication when he was a teenager. His doctor told him that allkids outgrow the problems he was having. That was bad advice. At the age of 32,Bill still suffered from the effects of ADD.Untreated ADD significantly affects the workplace. It costs employers millionsof dollars every year in decreased productivity, absenteeism, and employeeconflicts. Untreated ADD cuts throughout the adult population. It remains vastlyunderdiagnosed, at a great cost to our economy.There is a positive side to ADD in the workplace. For example, people with ADDoften are high in energy, enthusiastic, full of ideas, creative, and burstingwith energy. If they surround themselves with people who organize them andmanage details, they can be very successful. In my clinical practice, I treatmany highly successful ADD executives. Unfortunately, many people with ADD arenot fortunate enough to be in positions that maximize their strengths andminimize their weaknesses. These folks often have serious problems at work. Hereare some of the difficulties that people with ADD are likely to have at work:The Harder They Try, the Worse It GetsResearch has shown that the more ADD people try to concentrate, the worse itgets for them. As we’ve seen from SPECT images, the brain regions responsiblefor concentrated thinking turn off, not on. As the pressure to performincreases, they often fall off in their work. When this decreased performance isinterpreted as willful misconduct, serious problems arise. I once treated a manwith ADD who was employed as a ship welder. He told me that whenever his bossput pressure on him to do a better job, his work got worse—even though he reallytried to do better. When the boss told him that he liked his work, he becamemore productive. In supervising someone with ADD, it is much more effective touse praise and encouragement than pressure.DistractibilityDistractibility is often evident in meetings. People with ADD tend to lookaround the room, drift off, appear bored, forget the conversational direction,and interrupt with extraneous information. Their distractibility and shortattention span may also cause them to take much more time to complete their workthan their coworkers, just as it did with homework when they wereschoolchildren.ForgetfulnessForgetfulness is common in ADD and a serious handicap on the job. Just a fewexamples, such as missed deadlines, forgotten reports, and steps gone undone,illustrate how serious ADD on the job can be.ImpulsivityA lack of impulse control can get ADD people fired. They may say inappropriatethings to supervisors, other employees, or customers. I once had a patient whowas fired from thirteen jobs because of his trouble controlling his mouth. Eventhough he wanted to keep several of the jobs, he couldn’t stop himself fromblurting out whatever he was thinking before he had a chance to process thethought. Impulsivity also leads to poor decision making. Rather than thinking aproblem through, impulsive people act without the necessary forethought.Similarly, ADD people have trouble going through the established channels atwork. Their impulsive nature emboldens them to go right to the top to solveproblems, rather than work through the system. This may cause resentment intheir coworkers and immediate supervisors. Impulsivity may also lead to suchproblem behaviors as lying and stealing. I have treated many ADD people who havecarried the shame and guilt of these behaviors.Conflict SeekingMany people with ADD are in constant turmoil with one or more people at work.They seem “unconsciously” to pick out people who are vulnerable to verbally sparwith. Conflict-driven behaviors have a tendency to embarrass others, furtheralienating the ADD sufferer from his or her colleagues. Conflict may follow theADD person from job to job.DisorganizationDisorganization is a hallmark of ADD, and it can be particularly damaging in theworkplace. Often when you look at the person’s work area, it is a wonder theycan work in it at all. They tend to have many piles of “stuff” paperwork isoften hard for them to keep straight; and they seem to have a filing system thatonly they can figure out (and only on good days).Late to WorkMany people with ADD are chronically late to work because they have significantproblems waking up in the morning. I’ve had several patients who bought sirensfrom alarm companies to help them wake up. Imagine what their neighbors thought!They also tend to lose track of time, contributing to their tardiness.Start Many Projects, but Finish FewThe energy and enthusiasm of people with ADD often pushes them to start manyprojects. Unfortunately, their distractibility and short attention span impairstheir ability to complete these undertakings.One radio station manager told me that he had started over thirty specialprojects the year before but completed only a handful of them. He told me, “I’malways going to get back to them, but I get new ideas that get in the way.”I also treat a college professor who told me that the year before he saw me hehad started three hundred different projects. His wife finished the thought bytelling me he had only completed three.Moodiness and Negative ThinkingADD tends to cause moodiness, anxiety, and negativity. In addition to thestimulating effects of negative thinking, ADD people often have many experienceswith failure, so they come to expect it. Their “sky is falling” attitude has atendency to get on the nerves of coworkers and can infect the work environment.Inaccurate Self-AssessmentPeople with ADD poorly judge their own ability. I’ve seen situations in whichthey overvalue themselves and think they are better at their jobs than theyreally are. Alternately, I’ve had patients who persistently devalue importantassets that they have.Switches Things AroundADD causes people to switch things around. This happens with letters or numbers,even phrases or paragraphs. You can imagine the problems this can cause at work.Innumerable wrong numbers, misunderstood documents, and inaccurate calculationsare just some of the problems that may result. I once treated a billing clerkwho had reversed the amounts on bills she sent out, costing her employer over$12,000. I had to meet with the employer to convince him that ADD was a realphenomenon and that the employee was not trying to sabotage his business.Tendency Toward AddictionsPeople with ADD have a tendency toward addictions, such as food, alcohol, drugs,even work. Drug or alcohol addictions cause obvious work problems. Foodaddictions cause health and self-image problems that can affect work. Addictionto work is also a serious problem, because it causes burnout and family problemsthat eventually show in the workplace.Spends Excessive Time at Work Because of InefficiencyThe symptoms of ADD frequently cause a person to be inefficient on their job.This causes many people with ADD to put in overtime that managers considerexcessive, resulting in a poor job evaluation or firing. To avoid theseproblems, many people with ADD take their work home in order to finish it.SELF-ESTEEMBy the age of 6 or 7, ADD often has a significant negative impact onself-esteem. Here are some of the reasons why:Frequent ConflictADD sufferers have been in conflict with their parents, friends, and teachersover and over for years. This causes them to develop negative “self-talk”patterns and low self-esteem.Negative InputThe difficult behavior associated with ADD often elicits negative input fromothers. “Don’t do that.” “Why did you do that?” “Where was your head?” “What’swrong with you?” “Your brother doesn’t act like that!” “You’d do better if youwould try harder.” “Shame on you!” These are phrases many ADD children hear on aregular basis. Constant negative input wounds a child’s self esteem.Inaccurate Self-AssessmentAs mentioned above, people with ADD often judge their own ability poorly. Theyoften devalue their strengths and positive attributes, focusing only on theirfailures.Chronic FailureMost people with ADD have had many failure experiences in life, school,relationships, and work. These disappointments set them up to expect furtherfailure. Whenever a person expects that they will fail, they don’t try theirbest or they don’t try at all. Moreover, an expectation of failure causescrippling damage to one’s self-image.Negative BondingADD often causes negative bonding with parents. Bonding is critical to theemotional health of human beings. Yet, by the time many ADD children are schoolage, they have such a negative relationship with their parents that they learnnot to care about other people. This sets them up for societal problems. Withoutbonding, people don’t consider the feelings of others. A person so conditionedhas no problem hurting others to get what he or she wants.A Sense of Being DamagedDue to the many problems that ADD people have experienced throughout theirlives, they often have a sense that they are different from others and that theyare “damaged.”Tantrums/Rage OutburstsAs I mentioned above, there is a high incidence of rage outbursts among peoplewith ADD. The sense of being out of control wounds the person’s self-esteem,making him question why anyone would value someone so volatile.Negative Thinking PatternsThought patterns are the manifestation of self-esteem. Due to difficult pastlife experiences, many people with ADD have a tendency to think negatively. Theyfrequently distort situations to make them out to be worse than they really are.They tend to overgeneralize, think in black-and-white terms, predict badoutcomes, label themselves with negative terms, and personalize situations thathave little personal meaning. Teaching the ADD person to talk back to negativethoughts is essential to helping them heal. POINTS TO REMEMBER:ADD is a neurobiological disorder withserious psychological and social consequences. Children, teens, adults, and parents need to know:It’s not their fault.They didn’t cause it.There is hope. Parents, spouses and family members with ADD family membersneed information. Children, teenagers, and adultswith ADD need good treatment."},{"pageContent":"PART 3THE AMEN CLINIC’S ADD BRAIN ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16ENHANCING ADD BRAIN FUNCTIONEffective Interventions for Treating ADD Types, Including Diet, Exercise,Medications, Supplements, and Behavioral InterventionsThe Amen Clinic’s ADD Brain Enhancement Program is geared toward optimizingbrain function. The program includes diet, exercise, supplements, medications,neurofeedback, and behavioral interventions. Certainly, not everyone needs alltreatments, but I believe that it is important for people to know all theoptions available and the pros and cons of each.Most people in America have their ADD treated with medication alone. However,research studies by Dr. James Satterfield of Oregon show that medication byitself does not make a lasting difference. To get the best results, patientsneed interventions in a number of areas. ADD patients need strategies gearedtoward enhancing brain function and improving their skills at home, in school,at work, and in society at large.ADD has clear biological roots and serious psychological and social consequenceswhen left untreated. I often use the following computer analogy with mypatients: In order for a computer to effectively run any program, its hardwaremust be sufficient. It must have enough RAM, disk space, and processing speed.Trying to run complex programs on an old computer just won’t work. Yet, manypeople with ADD do not have enough RAM (short-term memory), disk space, orprocessing speed in their brains because of the underactivity in the prefrontalcortex and temporal lobes. To run programs effectively, you must first optimizethe hardware—the brain. But once a computer’s hardware is optimized, it stillhas programming needs. Many people with ADD, because of their hardware (brain)problems, never fully loaded the programs (information) they needed. Once thebrain is optimized, it is important to input strategies that help people withADD be more effective in their family, school, work, and social relationships.In Chapter 2, we discussed how important it was to assess ADD in abio-psycho-social fashion. Treating ADD is best done in the same way. It isessential to optimize the ADD brain (biology), the mindset of an ADD person(psychology), and the interactions between the ADD person and the world(social). Ignoring any of these factors can cause treatment failure. Here is abrief summary of ADD treatments. Many of them are expanded in subsequentchapters.Effective ADD Treatmentimage [Images/page234.jpg]BIOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONSimage [Images/page235.jpg]Eliminate Anything ToxicToxic substances can cause and exacerbate ADD-like symptoms. (For example,marijuana use can make some people appear as though they have Type 2[Inattentive] ADD). Eliminate anything toxic to your brain. Given that more than50 percent of ADD teenagers and adults have or have had problems with drug oralcohol abuse, treatment for abuse is essential in healing ADD.Caffeine and nicotine have been shown in brain studies to decrease overall bloodflow to the brain, in turn making ADD symptoms worse over time. In addition, inmy experience both nicotine and caffeine decrease the effectiveness ofmedication and supplement treatments and increase the number of side effectspeople have from medication. “But I feel so focused after my coffee in themorning,” you say. In the short run caffeine makes you feel more focused. Itworks much like Ritalin and Adderall. Unfortunately, caffeine also decreasesbrain blood flow and over time can make the ADD symptoms worse. If possible,also stop any medications that contribute to ADD symptoms.Protect Your HeadAs Chapter 11 clearly showed, head injuries can cause severe ADD-like symptoms.I have found that people who have ADD are more prone to head injuries due totheir impulsive nature. Head injuries can take a mild case of Type 2(Inattentive) ADD and turn it into a severe Type 4 (Temporal Lobe) ADD. Doeverything you can to prevent these injuries. Wear your seat belt. Do not engagein activities, no matter how adrenally rewarding they are, if they put you atmore risk for head injuries. Make kids wear their helmets when riding bikes,snowboarding, or rollerblading. My 13-year-old daughter knows that if she ridesher bike without a helmet, she loses her bike-riding privileges for a month.Dietary InterventionsThis is no small recommendation! As my colleague Barry Sears, Ph.D. (author ofThe Zone), says, “Food is a powerful drug. You can use it to help mood andcognitive ability or you can unknowingly make things worse.” All ADD types,except Type 3 (Overfocused) ADD, do better on a higher-protein,lower-carbohydrate diet: the exact opposite of the way that most people eat. Iwill explore dietary interventions for ADD types in Chapter 17.Intense Aerobic ExerciseAll ADD types benefit from intense aerobic exercise, especially Types 1, 2, 3,and 5. Exercise boosts blood flow to the brain. Exercise also increasesserotonin availability in the brain, which has a tendency to calm anteriorcingulate hyperactivity—especially important for Type 3. Tryptophan, the aminoacid building block for serotonin, is a relatively small molecule. It does notcompete well against the larger amino acids in attempting to cross theblood/brain barrier. With intense aerobic exercise the large muscles use up theavailable supply of bigger amino acids, decreasing the competition fortryptophan. As a result, it crosses more readily into the brain.I recommend that my patients exercise for 30 to 45 minutes at least five times aweek. A fast walk is sufficient, but not a stroll. Whatever exercise you choose,it needs to be intense enough to raise your heart rate.Avoid Prolonged Exposure to Video or Computer GamesTo my own patients I recommend an absolute maximum of 30 to 45 minutes a dayspent playing computer or video games. These games are more than just unhelpful:I think they are in fact harmful to many vulnerable ADD brains. Over the pastseveral years two of my patients had seizures while playing video games—patientswho had never had seizures before. It is a phenomenon called photophobicseizure, as happened to 730 children in Japan a few years ago while they werewatching the Nintendo Pokémon cartoon. I have another patient who becomesviolent after playing video games. Granted, these cases may be extreme, but Icannot see much good that comes from playing these games, and I believe theyhave the potential to harm. My best advice is to limit the exposure.MedicationMedication is an emotionally loaded issue for many people. There is a lot ofcontroversy in this area. After doing brain-imaging work for the past ten yearsin addition to practicing psychiatry for the past twenty, I have no doubt thatmedication can be very helpful for many patients. In fact, withholdingmedication from some patients is downright neglectful. Medication is thebest-studied and most effective treatment for ADD. Having said that, medicationalone is generally bad treatment. Unfortunately, most people get medication byitself without any of the help needed for the psychological and social aspectsof ADD. Medication for each ADD type will be discussed in Chapter 18.SupplementsEven more controversial than medication is using natural supplements for ADD.There is very little if any research behind using supplements with thisdisorder. However, my clinical experience has shown that supplements can behelpful when used properly. I worry that people spend billions of dollars onthese treatments with little regard to effectiveness or, more importantly, sideeffects. Because supplements are “natural,” people think of them as innocuous.In my experience that’s just not true. I am not opposed to natural supplements;in fact, I often recommend them. I am opposed to a person being ineffectivelytreated and dead-set against someone putting him-or herself at risk. Be sure youknow what you are taking when you try a supplement. A rational, balancedapproach to both medication and supplement treatment is the best medicine.Supplement treatment for ADD will be discussed in Chapter 19.NeurofeedbackA very exciting biological treatment for ADD is neurofeedback. Withneurofeedback electrodes placed on the scalp, electrical brain activity ismeasured, and the information is fed back to the patient. Both the patient andthe doctor can recognize areas of increased and decreased activity.Neurofeedback, like biofeedback, is based on the principle that if one knows theactivity in a certain bodily function, then one can learn to enhance or optimizethe activity therein. Neurofeedback for each ADD type is discussed in Chapter20.Sleep StrategiesSleep disturbances are very common in people with ADD. Many have trouble fallingasleep at night and awakening in the morning. Sleep deprivation can worsen ADDsymptoms in that it leads to decreased brain activity. Proper sleep is essentialfor brain function. Effective strategies for getting up and going to bed aregiven in Chapter 23.PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: EDUCATIONimage [Images/page238.jpg]Education about ADD—its impact on home, school, family, and the self—is thefirst step in treatment. Accurate information empowers you to get the best help.Robert Pasnau, M.D., past president of the American Psychiatric Association,said that coping requires three things: information, self-esteem, and a sense ofcontrol. Education has a powerful effect on each of those three criteria, andobtaining accurate information is the critical first step.Correcting Automatic Negative ThoughtsNegativity is one of the hallmark features of ADD. As I’ve said, many peoplewith ADD use negative thoughts as a form of self-stimulation, but this habitpredisposes them to depression and isolation. In Chapter 24, I will teach youhow to identify and rid yourself of the negative thoughts (I call themANTs—automatic negative thoughts) that invade your life.Targeted PsychotherapyFor many people with ADD, there are a number of psychological issues that needto be addressed. Without the proper biological treatment, psychotherapy can be afruitless and frustrating experience for both the therapist and the patient. Ihave consulted with many ADD patients who have been in psychotherapy for yearswithout much benefit. When they were placed on the right medication orsupplements and diet, however, psychotherapy brought about dramatic improvementin just several weeks. I am not dismissing psychotherapy as a necessarycomponent of treatment for children, teens, and adults with ADD. It is oftenvery helpful. It does, however, need to be in combination with the rightbiological treatment. The following are some psychotherapy themes that areessential in dealing with the ADD patient.Breaking Up Erroneous Belief PatternsMany people with ADD may have erroneous, negative beliefs that sabotage theirchances for success in the present. For example, they may believe that they’llfail in school (because that was their experience before they were treated), sothey will not try. Or they may believe that they are doomed to have poorrelationships (again, because that was their experience before treatment), sothey will engage in the same repetitive behaviors that impair their ability torelate to others. Once medical treatment is successful, it is also important tocorrect these beliefs, because beliefs drive behavior. Too often thesepredictions become self-fulfilling prophecies.Adrianne never played cards. As a child and teenager, she had trouble learningcard games because her attention span was so short. When she did manage to play,her impulsiveness led her into bad decisions. She often lost. As an adult, sheavoided social situations in which card games were played. After beginningmedication she still avoided playing cards until she began talking about this intherapy. When she made the connection between ADD and her underlying beliefabout card games, she was able to challenge herself to try again. She surprisedherself. Not only did she quite like playing cards, but she was also rathergood!The emotional trauma of having ADD, and all that it entails, leaves many peoplewith intense anxiety. I often have my patients undergo EMDR (eye movementdesensitization and reprocessing) therapy to help them deal with the emotionalpain of the past. EMDR is a specific treatment for patients who have posttraumatic stress disorder, and I have found it helpful for many of my ADDpatients. In EMDR the therapist has the patient move his or her eyes back andforth while a traumatic event is remembered. The therapist takes the patientthrough a series of steps to help relieve the trauma and rid the patient of theunderlying beliefs associated with it. Traumas (such as the emotional wreckageleft by ADD) often hinder people from moving their lives forward. EMDR is apowerful way to deal with the psychological fallout of struggling for years withuntreated ADD.Accept the Need for Biological InterventionBiological interventions, such as medication, often become a psychotherapyissue. Many people do not want to believe that there is anything wrong withthem. Taking medication or supplements may make them feel, in some way,defective. It is critical to talk about these feelings, for when they areignored, patients often begin to skip taking their medicine. Those sorts offeelings also perpetuate negative self-esteem.Justine was an example of this. At age 22 her life was falling apart. She hadtaken Ritalin as a teenager and it was very helpful for her. However, in thetwelfth grade a friend teased her about the medication, and she stopped it.Within the next year she was arrested twice for shoplifting, started usingdrugs, and dropped out of high school. The next four years were nothing buttrouble. After she saw a special on television about adult ADD, she rememberedhow helpful the medication had been for her and she sought help. Once she begantaking Ritalin again, her life turned around.Coaching for ADDOne of the most helpful psychological treatments for ADD is personal coaching.Coaching helps a person develop good “internal supervision skills.” Coachinginvolves using another person (a coach) to help you set goals and develop thespecific skills needed to meet those goals. I have seen it be very powerful forpeople with ADD, who, as a group, tend to struggle with issues of goal setting,organization, planning, and consistent performance. In Chapter 26, JaneMassengill (the coach for The Amen Clinic) and I will give you a step-by-stepguide to ADD coaching.Focused BreathingI have found diaphragmatic breathing quite helpful for my ADD patients. Thisbreathing technique lessens temper outbursts and anxiety while improving impulsecontrol and clarity of thought. It is easy to learn and when practiced will helpyou feel in much better control of your own feelings and behavior. This will bediscussed in Chapter 25.Self-Hypnotic Reprogramming for SuccessMany people with ADD have been programmed—in a sense “hypnotized”—into believingthey can’t change the problems that are holding them back. This negative beliefsystem must be dispensed with in order to bring about lifelong change. InChapter 27, world renowned mind-body physician Emmet Miller, M.D., and I willgive readers a set of instructions to make their own (or their child’s)self-hypnotic audiotape. Using this tape can help rewrite the negative emotionalscript in their minds. When my patients take the time to make this tape andlisten to it regularly, they feel more aware, more focused, more goal oriented,and more positive.SOCIAL INTERVENTIONS: SUPPORTimage [Images/page242.jpg]Obtaining support for yourself and your family is critical. Many people who haveADD or who have it in their family feel isolated and alone. A community ofsimilar people can provide much needed and irreplaceable support. In addition,by interacting with other families on the same journey, you can share a wealthof ideas on coping strategies for specific situations. For over a year I wrote acolumn in the ADD support section of Prodigy, the online computer service, and Iwas privileged to see the support that these people found among each other.After I had been writing the column for about six months, I wrote a letter tothe ADD group about the turmoil I had at home with my ADD son, who could not getup in the morning. The next morning I logged on to find seventeen e-mails fromother people giving me suggestions on how to cope. There is no substitute forthat kind of support.There are many ways to get support for ADD: For example, virtually all of theonline computer services have support-group sections for a wide variety ofproblems, including ADD. Prodigy, America Online, CompuServe, along with manyInternet news groups, provide many opportunities for support, information, andinteraction. The Internet is a wonderful resource for the very latestinformation. Look under ADD in the search functions of these services. A word ofcaution: Anyone can write on the Internet, so be sure to check out theinformation you obtain with your personal physician. I once treated a person whoused high doses of a cough syrup to treat ADD on the suggestion of a Web site.He became psychotic and lost his job and his marriage over the bad advice.Join a local community support group. There are support groups for ADD all overthe country. They can be a source of great information. Here are some numbers tocontact to get more information: CHADD Children [and Adults] with ADD(800) 233-40508181 Professional Place #201Landover, MD 20785Web site: www.chadd.org The Kitty Petty Institute(650) 329-9443410 Sheridan AvenuePalo Alto, CA 94306-2020(415) 329-9443 LDA (Learning Disability Association of America)4156 Library RoadPittsburgh, PA 15234-1349(412) 341-1515Fax (412) 344-0224www.ldanatl.org If there are no effective support groups in your area, get online.There are numerous toll-free numbers offering bits of information, guidance, andsuggestions for adults with ADD and learning disabilities. Despite the usefulservices that these toll-free numbers provide, many people are confused aboutexactly what information they can expect to receive. The following resourcelist, compiled by the National Adult Literacy and Learning Disabilities Center,is designed to give an overview of what information the following organizationsgive to their callers: Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) 1-800-669-4000. EEOC voice maildirects calls from 7 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Eastern Time (Monday to Friday).Operators accept orders for publications, fact sheets, posters, and a resourcedirectory for people with disabilities, including learning disabilities. They donot answer questions relating to employment but can give referrals to local EEOCoffices, 1103 Kenwood Rd., Bldg. 5, Cincinnati, OH 45242. HEATH Resource Center, 1-800-544-3284. The National Clearinghouse onPostsecondary Education for Individuals with Disabilities (HEATH ResourceCenter) has information specialists available from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Eastern Time(Monday to Friday) who provide resource papers, directories, information onnational organizations, and a resource directory for people with learningdisabilities, 1 Dupont Circle NW, #800, Washington, DC 20036. Job Accommodation Network, 1-800-526-7234, has a free consulting service from 8A.M. to 8 P.M. Eastern Time (Monday to Thursday) and 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. EasternTime (Friday) that provides information on equipment, methods, and modificationsfor persons with disabilities to improve their work environment. All informationis specific to the disability, including learning disabilities, P.O. Box 6080,Morgantown, WVA 26506. National Literacy Hotline, 1-800-228-8813, has a 24-hour bilingual (Spanish/English) operator service that provides information on literacy/educationclasses, GED testing services, and volunteer organizations, as well as alearning disabilities brochure. Orton Dyslexia Society (ODS), 1-800-222-3123, has a 24-hour voice mail servicethat receives information requests. From 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time(Monday to Friday) at (410) 296-0232, ODS staff direct people to appropriatematerials about issues of dyslexia. Referrals for testing and tutors, branchesof ODS, and workshops and conferences.Parenting and Family StrategiesAs we have seen, ADD is a chronic, stressful medical condition that affectsevery member of a family. Intervening at a family level is essential to having ahappy, healthy family life. In addition, I think of parent training as a primaryintervention for ADD children and teenagers. These children are often the mostchallenging for parents, and parents need superior skills to help their childrenthrive. Parenting and family strategies are found in Chapter 21.School StrategiesChildren, teens, and young adults spend more than a third of their lives inschool or working on schoolwork. Understanding ADD in a school situation andlearning proper strategies for intervention is an essential part of treatment.Thirty-five percent of untreated ADD teens never finish high school. I haveheard it said that graduating from high school is the number one predictor ofhow a person will do in life. Chapter 22 lays out school intervention strategiesfor people with ADD.Interpersonal StrategiesMaking and keeping friends is difficult for many people with ADD. It isestimated that at least half of all children and teens with ADD have problemswith their peers, and up to 75 percent of adults have interpersonal problems.Social skill training enhances the effectiveness of ADD treatment. Social skilltreatment often includes: * teaching communication skills, including active listening (repeating back the information and feelings you hear before you respond) * providing an environment for successful peer contacts and positive experiences (Encourage the ADD person to invite peers over to the house to spend time together.) * increasing knowledge about appropriate behavior (Look for situations to teach the child about helpful social behavior; discussing interactions that are seen on TV or in stores can be very helpful.) * teaching self-monitoring and internal dialogue techniques. (These include techniques that teach people to question what they do before they do it, to stop and think through the consequences of their behavior before they act in a certain way.) * searching for areas of social competence (sports, karate, music) and giving the ADD person healthy doses of these activities, and * diligently working on decreasing aggressive behavior at home and school; (aggressiveness is one of the strongest predictors of peer rejection).A good place to start social skill training is with the siblings at home. Ibelieve it is essential to expect siblings to be civil and act appropriatelywith each other. Many psychologists say, “Let the children work out their ownproblems; don’t interfere.” I disagree. Remember what happened to Cain and Abelwhen their parents didn’t intervene? In sibling relationships, clearly statethat you expect them to treat each other with respect. When they are positiveand appropriate with each other, notice and praise them. When they areinappropriate, condescending, aggressive, or mean with each other, disciplinethem. When parents lay out the ground rules, siblings are much more likely toget along with each other, which may translate into their behaving moreappropriately with others."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17DIETARY INTERVENTIONS FOR ADD TYPESI was recently in central Oregon, lecturing to mental-health professionals aboutADD. When I walked into the large lecture hall, my heart sank. On a table in theback of the room were boxes and boxes of muffins, donuts, bagels, and cinnamonrolls. I thought to myself, Oh, no, Daniel. You have to be really good thismorning or no one will be able to pay attention in about half an hour. Highsimple-carbohydrate foods—of which typical breakfast foods are a primeexample—are terrible for concentration. Foods that are filled with sugar orsubstances that rapidly break down to sugar cause a quick rise in blood sugar.An insulin release that lowers blood sugar below normal levels follows soonthereafter, making people feel tired, spacey, confused, and inattentive. Givepeople a lot of sugar (or substances like bread that are easily broken down tosugar) in the morning and they will act as if they have ADD. I started mylecture talking about the food in the back. “The food in the back is a goodexample of what parents unknowingly do to make kids struggle in school. Mostchildren start the day with muffins, donuts, Pop-Tarts, bagels, cinnamon rolls,and sugary cereals. They get virtually no protein in the morning. No wonderteachers complain that half their kids can’t concentrate. In order for childrenor adults to focus, they need to have nutritious food that enhances energy andconcentration. Especially for people with ADD, the solution is a higher-protein,lower-carbohydrate diet.” A better breakfast for the group would have beencheeses, hard-boiled eggs, or whole-grain bagels with cream cheese. I finishedmy lecture by saying, “If you want to concentrate this afternoon and have goodenergy until dinnertime, have no simple carbohydrates at lunch. No bread, nopasta, no potatoes, no rice, and no sugar. Have something like a stir frywithout the rice, a Cobb salad, or a cheeseburger without the bun.” Many peoplewho took my suggestions about lunch came up to me at the end of the day sayinghow amazed they were by their energy and concentration.Dietary interventions are important in treating all types of ADD. Food can beused like medicine. It can have a powerfully positive effect on cognition,feelings, and behavior, but it can have a negative effect as well. In fact, theright diet can decrease the amount of medication needed. However, the wrong dietwill do the opposite. In 1992, Joseph Egger reported in the British medicaljournal Lancet that 116 of 185 hyperactive children had a positive response to alow-allergen diet (higher in protein and lower in simple carbohydrates)supplemented by calcium, zinc, magnesium, and vitamins. Over and over in myclinical practice I have found that diet matters.When I can convince my patients to eat this way, they notice better moodstability, better focus, less distractibility, more mental stamina, and lessdrowsiness in the late morning and midafternoon. Here are strategies gearedtoward using food as a positive force in ADD treatment.ADD FOOD INTERVENTIONSFor the purpose of creating an ADD-friendly diet, we’ll divide food into fourgroups: water, protein, carbohydrates, and fat.WaterThe human body is two thirds water. Water is an essential part of every functionin the body, including brain blood flow and cell function. Necessary for propermetabolism, water helps transport nutrients and waste products in and out ofcells. Without enough of it, the body struggles to function properly. Anabundance of it gives cells the opportunity to work right. Be sure to drinkadequate amounts of water every day. Nutritionists recommend at least 8eight-ounce glasses a day. Avoid substances that dehydrate the body, such ascaffeine (which causes increased urination) and alcohol (one of the main reasonspeople get hung over after getting drunk).ProteinsProteins are essential to life. They are involved with immune system function,muscle mass, the enzymes driving the chemical reactions of life, hormones, andthe creation of neurotransmitters to make the brain function smoothly. Whenproteins are consumed, the body breaks them down to their constituent parts,called amino acids. Some amino acids are essential, because they have to comefrom the diet, and some are nonessential, because they can be made from proteinstores in the body. In addition, there are two types of proteins, complete andincomplete. Complete proteins such as those found in meat, fish, poultry,cheese, eggs, dairy, and soybean products such as tofu and soymilk containsubstantial amounts of all of the essential amino acids. Incomplete proteinshave only some of the essential amino acids. They are found in a number offoods, most notably grains, legumes, nuts, and leafy green vegetables.HEALTHIEST FORMS OF PROTEINChickenTurkeyVery lean cuts of beefFish, especially salmon and tuna (farm-raised, especially)Low-fat cottage cheeseLow-fat string cheeseMilkSoy-based food productsProtein powder.CarbohydratesCarbohydrates come from plant-based foods. Milk and milk products are the onlyfoods derived from animals that contain significant amounts of carbohydrates.There are three types of carbohydrates: sugar, simple carbohydrates, and complexcarbohydrates. The most basic carbohydrate, sugar, is a simple molecule used forenergy. Sugar also goes by the names of fructose (fruit sugar), sucrose (tablesugar), lactose (milk sugar), corn syrup, and glucose. Sugar passes rapidly fromthe stomach to the bloodstream. When the pancreas notices a rise in blood sugar,it releases the hormone insulin to drive the sugar into the body’s cells.Paradoxically, a high sugar load can cause an overproduction of insulin that hasthe effect of lowering blood-sugar levels below optimal levels. When thathappens, people feel tired, sluggish, and inattentive. Simple carbohydrates aresugar molecules connected by an oxygen molecule. They include products made fromrefined or white flour, such as pasta, bagels, and white bread, and such staplesas potatoes, rice, and cereals. Simple carbohydrates easily break down to sugarin the stomach and rapidly enter the bloodstream, just a little slower thansugars. Complex carbohydrates, such as vegetables, whole grains, and beans, havemore complex chemical bonds and take a longer time to break down in the stomach.Their higher quantity of fiber and water further slows the rate at which theyare absorbed. In choosing carbohydrates for your or your child’s diet, selectmore complex carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables, peas, beans, and wholegrain products, as opposed to sugar or simple carbohydrates. Complexcarbohydrates are less likely to provoke an overproduction of insulin and thetired, inattentive feelings that produces. In addition, they are filled withfiber, vitamins, and minerals—all essential ingredients for your health.HEALTHIEST FORMS OF CARBOHYDRATESFruits that tend to be especially good are apricots, oranges, tangerines, pears,grapefruit, apples, and kiwi.Vegetables (avoid large amounts of carrots due to high sugar content)Beans, especially black beans and kidney beansWhole grains, no white bread or bread with added sugar (You’ll have to searchfor good bread.)FatsIn the last fifteen years a lot of attention has been focused on decreasing fatin the diet. Yet, fat is an essential ingredient in the body. Fat is necessaryfor normal brain development, making it an essential ingredient during infancyand childhood. Fats come from both animal and plant sources.Fats are composed of building blocks called fatty acids. There are three typesof fatty acids: saturated, polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated. Saturated fattyacids are found primarily in animal products, including dairy items, such asmilk, cream, butter, and cheese; and fatty meats like beef, lamb, and veal. Thefat marbling you can see in beef is composed of saturated fat. Some vegetableproducts, such as coconut oil and vegetable shortening, are also high insaturated fatty acids. The liver uses saturated fatty acids to producecholesterol, especially LDL, or bad cholesterol, which clogs arteries. However,saturated fatty acids are also the basis for many hormones.Polyunsaturated fatty acids are found in the greatest abundance in corn,soybean, safflower, and sunflower oils. Polyunsaturated fatty acids tend tolower both bad (LDL) and good (HDL) cholesterol.Monounsaturated fatty acids are found in vegetable and nut oils, such as olive,peanut, and canola oil. An essential subgroup of these fats, omega-3 fattyacids, are found almost exclusively in coldwater fish, such as salmon, tuna, andmackerel. Monounsaturated fatty acids tend to raise HDL or good cholesterol.Each of these three types of fat plays an essential role in the body. The ratioof these types of fat in your diet directly impacts how effectively your cellsfunction.The brain is a unique organ in that more than half of its weight is composed offat. Nearly one third of that fat consists of the long-chain omega-3 fatty acidknown as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This particular essential fatty acid mustbe part of your diet and is required, not for only maintaining healthy nervesynapses, but also for the development of new brain pathways. It has been shownin rodent studies that diets high in DHA increase the levels of both dopamineand serotonin in the frontal cortex.HEALTHIEST FORMS OF FATSOlive oilCanola oilGrapeseed oilAvocadosNuts, such as Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, almonds, cashews, and pistachiosFish oilIn using food as medicine, it is important to maintain a proper balance betweenproteins, carbohydrates, and fat. Many people with ADD have too many simplecarbohydrates in their diet. Not only does this aggravate ADD symptoms, itupsets the body’s metabolic balance.All ADD types, except Type 3 (Overfocused) ADD, do better on a higher-protein,lower-carbohydrate diet. That’s the exact opposite of the way that most peopleeat.SIMPLE STEPS TO ADD DIETARY SUCCESS 1. Eat three meals a day and one or two snacks. Breakfast is important. It gives fuel for the morning and increases metabolism and blood flow. Make sure there is some form of protein in the morning (such as lean meat, cheese, cottage cheese, eggs, nuts, or protein powder). Snacks are also important to help maintain good energy and concentration. 2. Eat protein at each meal. (As we have seen protein is found in meat, eggs, cheese, nuts, and beans.) Protein contains the amino acid building blocks for neurotransmitters in the brain. Protein is essential to a “concentration diet.” 3. Increase the amounts of complex carbohydrates in your diet. (These are found in vegetables and whole grains.) Complex carbohydrates break down slower in the gut more readily than simple carbohydrates. They do not cause an overproduction of insulin and generally do not cause a drop in blood sugar. Carrots have a high sugar content, so they should be used only in small amounts. 4. Watch fruit and fruit juice intake. Most people think that they can have an unlimited amount of fruit and fruit juices. Most fruits are very high in natural sugar (fructose), which can have the same effect on blood sugar as sugar straight out of a box. Fruit is better than fruit juices because of the extra vitamins and fiber you get, but you can overdo fruit and feel sluggish and mentally slowed down. Good choices are apricots, oranges, tangerines, pears, grapefruit, apples, and kiwi. Avoid grapes, dates, and bananas, as their sugar content seems to be the highest. 5. Reduce or eliminate most simple carbohydrates. (This includes bread or pasta made with white flour, white rice, white potatoes, sugar, corn syrup, honey, and candy.) At the same lecture I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, a therapist came up to me during the break with this story. He said, “I’m so glad you mentioned the sugar. I used to be a very angry person; sometimes I would even scare my family. It made me feel terrible. I even took anger management classes, but they didn’t seem to help. When I eliminated the sugar in my diet, I noticed almost an immediate reduction in outbursts, plus I felt more energetic, lost weight, and was much more focused.” His personal experience was the same as my clinical experience. 6. Increase the amounts of omega-3 fatty acids in your diet. (Sources include large coldwater fish, such as tuna and salmon, as well as walnuts and Brazil nuts.) More on this in Chapter 19.Here is a list of suggestions to help implement these dietary strategies:Things Good for BreakfastOmelets with lean meats, cheese, or vegetablesEggs and lean sausageWhole-grain cereal (low or no sugar: Kashi cereals have no sugar.)Cottage cheese and fruitCottage cheese and minute steakWhole grain bagels and cream cheeseOatmeal (high in fiber and also contains gamma linolenic acid, an essentialfatty acid) (Avoid sugar, e.g., sugar cereals, doughnuts, Pop-Tarts, waffles and pancakeswith syrup, and cinnamon rolls.) Things Good for LunchStir-fry (vegetables and lean meat, no rice)Cobb salad (no sugar in the salad dressing)Caesar salad with chicken breast (no sugar)Tuna saladSandwiches made with lean protein and multigrain breadSandwiches made with 100-percent natural peanut butter and a sugar-freespreadable 100-percent fruit jam (Avoid sugar and simple carbohydrates, e.g., white bread, french fries, breadedonion rings or meat, potato chips, potatoes [unless eaten with the skin] andketchup.) Things Good For DinnerSaladLean protein, such as beef, chicken, pork, lamb, fish (highest in Omega-3) fattyacidsVegetables (Avoid sugar and simple carbohydrates, e.g., white bread, french fries, breadedonion rings or meat, potato chips, potatoes [unless eaten with the skin], andketchup.)Balanced Fast FoodsWendy’s chiliJack-in-the-Box Chicken Fajita Pita sandwichMcDonald’s Egg McMuffin (balanced between protein and carbohydrates) SnacksSugar-free ice creamCream cheese and celeryDeviled eggsOlivesNatural peanut butter and celeryNuts, especially Brazil Nuts (high in omega-3 fatty acids). Homemade beef jerky (This is my personal favorite. Take flank steak and slice itthinly with the grain; put a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the meat,and then put it in a dehydrator. It is cheap, very tasty, and the kids like it alot.) Fruits such as apricots, oranges, tangerines, pears, grapefruit, apples, andkiwi, but eat them in conjunction with some form of protein. Use these guidelines especially at the times you (or your child) needs to focus.A Twinkie snack before studying guarantees more problems with attention span. Ifyou want to have pasta, bread, cinnamon rolls, or sugar ice cream, have it at atime that you don’t need to focus, such as on the weekends or before bed.Eating with these guidelines will stabilize blood sugar, lower cholesterol,decrease your appetite, help you to lose weight, and improve concentration andenergy.TYPE 3 (OVERFOCUSED) ADDType 3 (Overfocused) ADD is associated with low serotonin and dopamine levels.As a result, a higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate diet (which enhances focus)may cause people with Overfocused ADD to fixate even more on the things thatbother them. Remember, the problem in this type is not that they can’t payattention; it is that they can’t stop paying attention. Dietary interventionsfor this type are geared toward increasing serotonin and dopamine. Tryptophan(or L-tryptophan) is an essential amino acid found in abundance in allprotein-rich foods. It would therefore seem reasonable to assume that if you atea high-protein diet, you would increase tryptophan levels. However, the oppositeis true. When you eat a high-protein diet, tryptophan, a relatively small aminoacid, cannot muscle its way into brain cells in the presence of other, morerobust amino acids. The result is lowered tryptophan levels in the brain. On theother hand, carbohydrate-containing foods, such as pastas, potatoes, bread,pastries, pretzels, candy, and popcorn, increase L-tryptophan levels in thebrain. In 1972, Dr. John Fernstrom and Dr. Richard Wurtman from MIT publishedtheir landmark study on carbohydrates and brain serotonin levels in the journalScience. The researchers showed that the protein and carbohydrate content offood had a significant impact on the production of serotonin. They found thatcerebral serotonin and dopamine levels can be raised by eating a diet balancedbetween carbohydrates and protein. Many people unknowingly trigger cognitiveinflexibility or mood problems by eating diets low in L-tryptophan. Thehigh-protein, low-carbohydrate diets that I recommend for the other types of ADDmake people with cingulate problems worse.Eating for Type 3 ADD needs balance. A diet high in simple carbohydrates(doughnuts, pasta, french fries, apple pie) will help you feel more positive andmore flexible, but it will not help your energy level or ability to focus (orweight!). Type 3 ADD needs a balanced between carbohydrates and protein—forexample, sausage and cheese with pasta; apple pie only after some protein atdinner; french fries with a hamburger patty; and meat pizza with a thin crust.Diet matters. Pay attention to it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18MEDICATION FOR ADD TYPESMost people associate ADD treatment with medication and medication alone. Whilemedication is an important component of effective ADD treatment, it cannot beused in a vacuum. Giving a patient a pill with no social or psychologicalsupport can be as bad as withholding treatment entirely. However, it is just asirresponsible to deny a patient appropriate medication because of a bias.Healing ADD requires involvement in the patient’s life. It requires caring,follow-up, and attention. Ignoring the patient’s need for social, psychological,or biological intervention can only lead to failure.In the midst of all the controversy about psychoactive drugs, we would do wellto remember that ADD is a neurobiological disorder. Effective treatment dependsupon biological intervention. Sometimes the other biological therapies discussedin this book (supplements, neurofeedback, exercise, etc.) can replace the needfor medication. But sometimes medication is a must. It can be lifesaving.Whenever medication is started or considered, it’s essential to have clear goalsin mind for its use. Appropriate ADD medication treatment goals include: * increasing attention span and learning * decreasing distractibility * decreasing restlessness or high activity levels * decreasing impulsiveness and increasing thoughtfulness * decreasing irritability * increasing motivation * improving overall functioning at school, at work, at home, in relationships, and within the self.Medication needs to be targeted to each individual ADD type. The wrongmedication can make things worse. ADD treatment in this country has focusedalmost exclusively on brain stimulants. When these don’t work (or when they makethe patient worse), the ADD person is labeled nonresponsive and written off, orthe drugs themselves are said to be ineffective, harmful, or “just a way ofmedicating bad behavior.” In recent years, medical treatment of ADD has gotten abum rap. The fault lies not with the concept of giving medicine to people withADD, but with giving people with ADD the wrong medicine.Misdiagnosis can cause serious problems, making an ADD person suffer even more.Inappropriate diagnosis can affix an inaccurate label to a child’s perfectlyhealthy personality. ADD is not overdiagnosed: In fact, I think it’sunderdiagnosed. However, I have no doubt that misdiagnosis runs rampantthroughout the health care community. People with ADD are being missed; peoplewithout ADD are being mistreated; and the reputation of effective ADDmedications is being dragged down, with terrible consequences for the people whotruly need them. It’s time that the health care community recognizes that ADD isnot a simple disorder and takes a serious look at how it is treated.Ineffective treatment is not innocuous. When treatments fail, individuals andfamilies get discouraged. Aside from the personal cost to the patient of thisdiscouragement, a failed healing program can lead to the ADD remaininguntreated. The costs for that are unimaginably high for both the individual andsociety at large. It’s been my clinical experience that the earlier treatment iseffective, the more people are willing to follow through with it.TYPE 1 (CLASSIC) ADD & TYPE 2 (INATTENTIVE) ADDThe best-known medications, stimulants, are the first-line medications fortreating Type 1 and Type 2 ADD. Our current understanding of these medicationsis that they increase dopamine output from the basal ganglia and increaseactivity in the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes. The following is a tablethat analyzes the currently available stimulant medications:image [Images/page259.jpg]Contrary to popular belief, these are very safe medications. The PDR lists 60milligrams as the top dosage for Ritalin and 40 milligrams as the top dosage forAdderall and Dexedrine. The maximum safe dose is much higher. Many clinicians,like myself, feel the recommended doses are too low for some individuals. Astudy performed at Harvard indicated that adults, on average, needed about amilligram of methylphenidate per kilogram of body weight per day. So if someoneweighs 70 kilograms (about 150 pounds), he or she will need on average 70milligrams a day. With Cylert it is very important to monitor liver functiontests. Two to three percent of people taking Cylert develop a chemicalhepatitis. For this reason, I usually reserve Cylert as my last choice.It is essential not to take stimulants with citrus juices (orange, grapefruit,lemon) or anything with citric acid in it. (Read the labels: Citric acid is usedin many things as a preservative). It tends to lessen the effect of medication.Likewise, decrease caffeine intake when taking a stimulant. Caffeine andstimulants together over-stimulate the nervous system.ADDERALL AND CONCERTA: THE DRUGS OF CHOICE FOR TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 ADDAdderall and Concerta, my drugs of choice for types 1 and 2 ADD, have severalimportant advantages. They last longer than regular-release Ritalin andDexedrine—between five and seven hours for Adderall and ten and eleven hours forConcerta, versus only two to four hours for regular-release Ritalin andDexedrine. They are generally given once or twice a day. Giving a higher dose ofAdderall in the morning than in the evening has been shown in one study to helpincrease the duration of effectiveness. In one study, teachers preferredAdderall to Ritalin by 70 percent. Patients, parents, and teachers say thatAdderall and Concerta are smoother when they take effect and smoother when theywear off.Another reason that I prefer Adderall is that the manufacturer has made it infour strengths: 5, 10, 20, and 30 milligrams. The tablet is double-scored sothat it can be halved and quartered to fine-tune the dose. Because of theability to break tablets, the daily cost of Adderall is generally less than theother stimulant medications, and patient compliance is enhanced. Also, thenumber of pills one has to take is generally less with Adderall.The number of pills a patient takes a day can be a very important issue. Forexample, Ritalin comes in 5-, 10-, and 20-milligram tablets. Let’s say that aperson is taking 15 milligrams three times a day—a fairly typical ADD dose. Theperson will end up taking three 5-milligram tablets three times a day, or ninetablets a day.Some people get upset about taking this many tablets, feeling that it reflectson how messed up they must be. An equivalent dose of Adderall is 15 milligramstwice a day. Since Adderall comes in 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-milligram tablets, thepatient takes half of a 30 milligram tablet twice a day. Taking half a tablettwice a day does not have the same emotional impact as nine tablets a day.Adderall and Concerta do not always work. Often when they don’t work, Ritalin orDexedrine may. I go through each of the stimulants until I find the best one formy patients.Here is a list of common questions about stimulant medications in general.1. What are the indications for stimulant medications?Stimulant medications have several uses in medicine. Most commonly, they areprescribed for ADD. They are also used for narcolepsy (sudden sleep attacks), asan adjunctive treatment for depression, in chronic obesity, and to helpthinking, concentration problems, and appetite problems in the elderly.2. How can stimulant medications help?They can improve attention span, decrease distractibility, increase the abilityto finish tasks, improve the ability to follow directions, decreasehyperactivity and restlessness, and lessen impulsivity. Frequently, handwritingimproves with this medication. Schoolwork, homework, and overall workperformance often improve significantly, while aggression and stubbornnessdecrease. Listening and communication skills show improvement, along with adecrease in conflict-seeking or stimulation behaviors.3. How long does the medication last? What is the usual dosage?Ritalin and Dexedrine usually last three to four hours, but in some people theylast as little as two and a half hours or as long as six hours. There is aslow-release form of Ritalin that lasts six to eight hours and may help you oryour child avoid taking a late-morning or noontime dose. However, theslow-release form of Ritalin has a reputation for being somewhat erratic. Forsome people it works great; for others it’s lousy. Often you just have to try itto see. A new form of slow-release methylphenidate, Concerta, was released inlate 2000. It lasts from ten to eleven hours and appears so far to be morereliable than the slow-release form of Ritalin. The slow-release form ofDexedrine is reliable. Adderall acts like a slow release preparation and usuallylasts about six to seven hours. It also tends to be smoother in onset of actionand when wearing off.In addition to weekday morning doses, I usually prescribe medication for mypatients in the afternoon and on weekends. During those times people with ADDstill need to do work, homework, or housework and interact with other people.Everyone is different in his or her need for medication. Some people need smalldoses (2½ to 5 milligrams) of stimulant medication twice a day; some need itfour or five times a day (of regular release). Others need larger doses (15 to20 milligrams). I have found that response often does not correlate with bodyweight or age. Trial, supervision, and observation are the keys to finding theright dose.4. How will the doctor monitor the medication?In my practice, I initially see patients every couple of weeks until we find theright medication and dosage. During appointments I ask about progress (at home,school, and work) and check for any side effects of the medication. I’ll keep acheck on weight and height and occasionally check blood pressure. When Cylert isused, it is critical to check blood work for liver function before starting themedication, and every couple of months thereafter. In addition, I often askteachers to fill out follow-up rating scales to help me gauge the effectivenessof the medication. For adults, I often ask that their spouses come to theappointments so that I can get another opinion on the patients’ progress.5. What side effects can these medications have?Of all the medications I prescribe, stimulants, in my opinion, are the safest. Ihave never had to hospitalize a patient for a bad side effect, and I have neverhad a side effect that did not go away once we stopped the medication.Any medication can have side effects, including allergies to the medication,which are usually exhibited by rashes. Because each patient is different, it isimportant to work together with your physician to find the best medication withthe fewest, least bothersome side effects. The following list may not includerare or unusual side effects. Talk to your doctor if you or your childexperience anything unusual after starting the medication.Common side effectsThese often go away after about two to three weeks or if the dosage of themedication is lowered. As the medication wears off, there may be a reboundeffect where the hyperactivity or moodiness becomes worse than before themedication was started. Dosage adjustment usually helps rebound. Lack of appetite. Encourage a good breakfast, and afternoon and evening snacks;give medication after meals rather than before. Some children and teens becomehungry near bedtime. Unfortunately, some parents think that their child’s hungeris no more than a manipulative ploy to stay up later, and they engage the childor teen in a battle. The medication really does affect appetite. If the child orteen is hungry later on and they did not have much to eat at dinner, it is oftena good idea to give them a late-evening meal or snack. For some people a lack ofappetite is a significant problem and the medication may need to be changed oradjusted. Some of my patients use nutritional supplements, to make sure they getenough calories and nutrients. Trouble falling asleep. Some people experience insomnia. If they do, I eithergive them a lower dose in the late afternoon or eliminate the last dose. Incases where there are problems when the last dose is eliminated, I may trygiving a small dose of the stimulant right before bedtime. This works especiallywell for the hyperactive group. The medication settles them down so that theycan go to sleep. For insomnia, I often recommend a concoction of 6 ounces ofwarm milk with a tablespoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of sugar or honey. Thisseems to have a nice sedating effect for many people. Headaches or stomachaches. Patients may complain of headaches or stomachaches.These typically go away after several weeks. Tylenol and ibuprofen (Advil) seemto be helpful for the headaches, and taking the medication with food oftendecreases the stomach problems. Irritability, crankiness, crying, emotional sensitivity, staring into space,loss of interest in friends. Some patients experience moodiness and minorpersonality changes. These side effects often go away in a week or two. If theydon’t, the medication often needs to be changed, maybe to an antidepressant.Less Common Side EffectsTics. Some patients develop tics (such as eye blinking, throat clearing, headjerking) on the medication. If that happens, it is important to discuss it withyour doctor. Sometimes the tics go away on their own; sometimes higher doses ofthe medication may improve the tics; and sometimes the medication has to bestopped. If the stimulant is very helpful, I may add another medication (such asclonidine or risperidone) along with the stimulant to help with the tics.A complicating factor with tics is that a high percentage of patients with ticdisorders, such as Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome (manifested by having bothmotor and vocal tics), have ADD. Sometimes it is hard to know if the medicationcaused the tics or if the tics were already present but worsened with themedication. Slowed growth. There used to be a concern about stimulants stunting growth, butthe long-term studies show that even though they may slow growth for a period ofabout a year, in the long run children usually catch up to where they should be. Rapid pulse or increased blood pressure. If a patient notices chest pain or aheart flutter, it is important to notify the physician immediately. Nervous habits. Picking at the skin, stuttering, and hair pulling can sometimesoccur with these medications. But keep in mind that the side effects of having untreated ADD are immeasurablyworse that those caused by the medication!6. What could happen if this medication is stopped suddenly?There are no medical problems due to stopping the medication suddenly. A fewpeople may experience tiredness, irritability, moodiness, trouble sleeping, orincreased hyperactivity for a few days if they have been on daily medication fora long time. Often it is better to stop the medication gradually (over a week orso).7. How long will the medication be needed?There is no way to know how long a person may need to take the medication. Thepatient, doctor, parent, teacher, and spouse need to work together to find outwhat is right for each person. Sometimes the medication is only needed for a fewyears, and sometimes it is needed for many years. Medication is an essentialtreatment for ADD, and until patients outgrow it (as sometimes happens) or findan alternative therapy that works (such as neurofeedback), they need to remainon the medication. Untreated ADD is a serious disorder and the goal of treatmentshould be to eliminate its effects, not get off medication.8. Does this medication interact with other medications?It is a good idea to check with your doctor before mixing any prescriptionmedications. Make sure he or she knows every medicine—including over-the-counterpreparations and dietary supplements—that you are taking. When stimulants areused with tricyclic antidepressants, an occasional side effect may occur, suchas confusion, irritability, hallucinations, or emotional outbursts. Sometimes,however, combining stimulants with certain antidepressants can be a powerfullypositive treatment. I have done this in many patients without any ill effects,but remember that everyone is different.It is not a good idea to combine stimulants with nasal decongestants (such asmedications that contain pseudoephedrine or related medications), because rapidpulse or high blood pressure may develop.If nasal decongestion is severe, it is better to use a cortisone nasal spray.Many patients with ADD become cranky or more hyperactive on antihistamines, suchas Benadryl. If medicine for allergies is needed, use one of the antihistaminesthat does not enter the brain, such as Claritan. Check with the pharmacistbefore taking any over-the-counter medication.9. Does this medication stop working at puberty?No! For most people it continues to work into adulthood. If it does lose itseffectiveness, the dose may need to be increased; alternately, switching toanother stimulant may be helpful. However, for the vast majority of people withADD, medication does not stop working at puberty despite what physicians used totell parents.10. Why does this medication require a special prescription? (This informationvaries from state to state.)Prescriptions for Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin, and Dexedrine require specialprescriptions known as “triplicates” that must be filled within fourteen days ofthe time the prescription is dated. (Cylert does not have this requirement.)Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin, and Dexedrine are controlled medications. Someadults have been known to abuse them, but this is rare. In fact, the researchshows that children who are adequately treated for ADD have a much lowerpercentage of drug abuse as teenagers and adults than those kids with ADD whowere never treated with medication. In my experience, this medication does notcause illegal drug use or addiction!11. What if my child or I have problems remembering to take the medication?Remembering to take medication three times a day can be difficult, even forpeople who do not have ADD. Forgetfulness is a common symptom of ADD, and whenthe medication has worn off, the person is fully ADD again. If forgetfulness isa chronic problem, don’t assign blame or be upset. Look for solutions. Here aretwo I recommend: Try switching to a slow-release form of the medication, or getan alarm system (such as a digital watch that has five alarms) to help youremember.12. What about the negative news media reports on these medications?It is critical to get your medical information from your doctor, not fromsensational talk-show hosts. Many people have erroneous ideas about stimulantmedication. If you hear things that worry you, check with your doctor beforemaking any decisions.For a period of a year, I kept a log of comments my patients told me after Istarted them on stimulant medication for types 1 and 2 ADD. These medicationscan turn a person’s life around. Here are some of the comments:“I experienced an increased awareness of the world around me. I saw the hillsfor the first time when driving to work. I saw the bay when I crossed over thebridge. I actually noticed the color of the water!”“A dramatic difference! I am really amazed.”“I experienced a 180-degree difference in my attitude.”“I left your office a skeptic. I came back converted.”“My husband said he doesn’t have a knot in his stomach anymore.”“I look at my children and say ‘Aren’t they cute,’ rather than complaining aboutthem.”“I could enjoy the moment. My thoughts are calmer, quieter, easier to livewith.”“I could sit and watch a movie for the first time in my life.”“I am able to handle situations where I used to be hysterical. I am able to seewhen I’m starting to overreact.”“The lens on my life is much clearer.”“I was tremendously overscheduled. No sane person would do that!”“It amazes me that a little yellow pill [5 milligrams of Ritalin] can take mefrom wanting to jump off the bridge to loving my husband and enjoying mychildren.”“It is like being given sight!”“I’m not running at train-wreck speed.”“For the first time I felt in charge of my life.”“I’m better able to keep things in perspective.”“I used to think I was stupid. It seemed everyone else could do more things thanme. I’m starting to believe that there may be intelligent life in my body.”“My appetite is more normal.”“I sleep much better. Can you believe I’m taking a stimulant and it calms medown?”“I’m out of the damned black hole I was in.”“I used to be the kind of person who would go walking by myself in downtownDetroit at 2 A.M. Now on the medication I would never do something so stupid.Before I just wouldn’t think about the consequences.”“Now I can give talks in front of groups. Before, my mind would always go blank.I organized my life around not speaking in public. Now my brain feels calmer,clearer.” “I feel like I think everyone else feels.”“I’m not as intimidated by others like I used to be.”“My husband may not be as happy as before I was on medication. Now I can thinkand he doesn’t win all of the arguments. I’m going to have to retrain him to notalways expect to get his way.”“I’m not losing my temper.”“It’s like waking up after being asleep your whole life.”“Night and day!”“I feel totally in control of my life.”“Six months ago there was no way I would drive on LA freeways. Now I can driveon them no problem.”“I can’t stand useless confrontation when I used to thrive on it!” When stimulant medications do not appear to work for types 1 or 2 ADD, I may trythe stimulating antidepressant medication listed under Type 5 (Limbic) ADD. Ioccasionally use blood-pressure medications, such as clonidine or guanfacine.These blood-pressure medications have been found to help hyperactivity,aggressiveness, and impulsivity. They do not much help the attentional symptoms.Mixing them with a stimulant medication can produce excellent results. I shouldstress that these are not my first choices and should be used only with carefulmedical supervision.Clonidine and guanfacine are also used as primary treatments for tic disorderssuch as Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome. When I use clonidine in addition to astimulant medication, I will order a screening EKG. There have been severalreports that this combination may cause problems, even though personally I havefound it to be an effective, safe combination. These medications have also beenused to treat insomnia, which is very common in ADD.image [Images/page270.jpg]TYPE 3 (OVERFOCUSED) ADDType 3 (Overfocused) ADD is most likely due to a deficiency of both serotoninand dopamine. Medication interventions need to be targeted at enhancing both ofthese neurotransmitters. If one neurotransmitter is enhanced by itself, it canmake this type worse. For example, when stimulant medications are given topeople with Type 3 (Overfocused) ADD, they often become overstimulated, stuck oncertain issues, and anxious. Used by themselves, stimulant medications furtheroverheat the cingulate gyrus. Likewise, serotonin medications (such as Prozac orPaxil) by themselves tend to help the overfocus but cause additional problemswith focus and motivation. A balance is needed.Effexor (venlafaxine) is my first choice for Type 3 (Overfocused) ADD. Effexorincreases both serotonin (helping to cool the anterior cingulate gyrus and shiftattention) and norepinephrine and dopamine (stimulating the brain). OftenEffexor can be used alone, without the need for a stimulant medication. WhenEffexor is ineffective or not well tolerated, I often prescribe a SSRI(selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) medication with a stimulant. Thesemedications only increase serotonin availability in the brain. Adding astimulant medication like Adderall helps to treat fully this type of ADD. Hereis a table of Type 3 (Overfocused) ADD medications:SSRIs are generally very safe medications. In our experience, however, peoplewho have temporal lobe problems may experience a higher intensity of angry andaggressive feelings on Prozac or other serotonin enhancing medications.Therefore, we are careful to screen for these before placing someone on thesemedications. If there are side effects on any medication, it is important tocontact your doctor and discuss them. In contrast to the stimulants, these maytake several weeks to a month in order to be effective and even three to fourmonths to see the best benefit.image [Images/page271.jpg]TYPE 4 (TEMPORAL LOBE) ADDThe medications used to treat Type 4 (Temporal Lobe) ADD are classified asanticonvulsant medications. They stabilize temporal lobe activity and helpsymptoms of aggression, mood instability, headaches, and in some cases learningproblems. Treating Type 4 ADD often involves combining them with a stimulantmedication. Even though these medications are classified as anticonvulsant orantiseizure medications, I am not saying that Type 4 patients have a seizuredisorder. Rather, they have dysfunction in a part of the brain that is alsoassociated with seizures. In treating ADD, we often use much lower doses thanare used to combat seizures. Sometimes very small doses are all that isnecessary. Anticonvulsants are thought to enhance the availability of theneurotransmitter GABA, which has a calming or inhibitory effect on nerve cells.In the last twenty years, psychiatry has come around to using these medicationsfor many different conditions. Anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine ordivalproate, have been used for manic-depressive illness, pain syndromes,aggression, and resistant depression.Here is a list of common anticonvulsant medications used for this type of ADD:image [Images/page272.jpg]image [Images/page273.jpg]In addition to anticonvulsants, I often use memory-enhancing medication forpeople with temporal lobe problems. Memory problems are very common in this ADDtype. Donepezil (Aricept) is a medication indicated for Alzheimer’s disease thatworks by increasing the amounts of acetylcholine in the brain. Acetylcholine isa neurotransmitter involved in the laying down of new memories. One woman wroteme that after she took Aricept, it was like going from 4 megabytes of RAM in herhead to 128 megabytes. In addition, Piracetam, a medication that is difficult toobtain in the U.S. but not in Europe or Canada, has been shown in a number ofstudies to help memory. A number of my patients through the years have writtenaway for it and found it beneficial and without side effects. Mark, a17-year-old patient with learning disabilities stemming from memory problems,was placed on Piracetam. In three weeks he noticed that he felt that he wasclearer and that his memory was better. Piracetam has become available recentlythrough a compounding pharmacy in Virginia (800-723-7455). Your doctor can writeyou a prescription for it, and you can send it to the pharmacy. In thesupplement chapter, I will also discuss a number of natural or herbal memoryremedies.TYPE 5 (LIMBIC) ADDType 5 (Limbic) ADD is often best treated with a stimulating antidepressantmedication, such as desipramine, imipramine, buprion, and venlafaxine (if thereare anterior cingulate issues as well). These medications increase theneurotransmitters norepinephrine and/or dopamine. They tend to be morestimulating than other antidepressants.image [Images/page274.jpg]These medications need to be monitored more closely than stimulants, especiallyfor their effect on heart function. Many adults respond to very low doses ofthese medications for ADD symptoms. Low doses often produce far fewer sideeffects than the higher “antidepressant” doses. Unlike the brain stimulants,these medications may take several weeks to a month to become effective. WhenWellbutrin was first released in the United States, a number of people developedseizures while on it, resulting in it being pulled from the market in the early1980s. The manufacturer figured out the dosage pattern was wrong and the FDAallowed them to rerelease it with a different dosage regimen. Do not take morethan 150 milligrams at a time of the regular-release preparation or 300milligrams of the slow-release preparation. I also use these medications totreat depression, anxiety disorders, bedwetting (imipramine), and smokingaddiction (Wellbutrin), often in conjunction with one of the stimulants.TYPE 6 (“RING OF FIRE”) ADDThis type of ADD seems to respond best to the anticonvulsants listed under Type4 ADD, often with the addition of a stimulant medication. Stimulants bythemselves often make this type worse. Serotonergic medications, by themselves,seem to make it worse as well, although they may be needed for overfocusedsymptoms. If the anticonvulsants do not work, I use the new, novel antipsychoticmedications, such as Risperdal or Zyprexa. I often use dosages of theanticonvulsants or antipsychotic medications that are much smaller than thoseneeded for seizure disorders or psychotic illnesses.The antipsychotic medications can be very effective. Many of my teenage patientshave avoided the hospital or residential treatment centers due to thesemedications. These drugs can produce significant weight gain. I have a number ofpatients who have gained twenty to thirty-five pounds in less than a year. If ithad not been for the amazing response, I would not have persisted with themedication. The anticonvulsant Topamax is known to promote weight loss in somepatients, and I have used it successfully in some of my “Ring of Fire” patients.Despite the great results with antipsychotics, I still prefer theanticonvulsants because of the fewer side effects.COMBINATIONSSometimes a combination of medications is needed to obtain the full therapeuticeffect. I particularly like the combination of stimulants and antiobsessivemedications for children of alcoholics. Sometimes a person may have three orfour different subtypes of ADD operating at once and may be on three or evenfour medications. Brain studies have taught us that some people have multiplebrain systems involved in their symptoms and need sophisticated combinations ofmedications. I recommend that you be evaluated and treated by a specialist inthe field.REMEMBER:The goal is to function as well as possible,not to be off medication! Many people have the misguided belief that it’s better if they only take a“little bit” of the medication. Often this attitude causes the medication to beineffective. I give patients the following metaphor:When a person goes to the eye doctor because he or she is having trouble seeing,they want a prescription for the glasses that will help them see the best. Theydon’t ask for “just a little bit of a lens.” They want to see clearly!So it is with ADD: Everyone is different in the quantity of medication theyrequire to function at their best. For some people it is 5 milligrams ofAdderall one to two times a day. For others it is 20 milligrams of Adderallthree times a day. Everyone is different.The side effects of having untreated ADD are immeasurably worse than any causedby the medication!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19SUPPLEMENT STRATEGIES FOR ADD TYPESThrough the years many people have asked me about natural treatments for ADD. Atleast once a month a parent tells me about an amazing new treatment for ADD.Vitamins, herbs, fish oil, amino acids, grape-seed extract, and magnets, to namea few. With three ADD children of my own, I’ve kept an open mind. I want to knowabout everything that works. Through the years I have tracked each of thesetreatments, kept up on what little scientific literature exists, and constantlystayed on the lookout to see what works. Wading through the claims, parentalexcitement, and failures is sometimes discouraging. The good news, however, isthat many of these supplemental treatments are helpful, especially if you targetthe interventions to specific ADD types.A word of caution: Ignoring the ADD type can cause some of these interventionsto backfire. Just because something is natural does not mean it’s innocuous.Here’s an example:Seven-year-old Justin was brought to see me by his mother. He had symptoms ofType 4 ADD with severe temper problems. A month before I met Justin, his motherhad read a magazine article about St. John’s wort: The article said that ithelped with mood and temper problems. She gave St. John’s wort to her son.Justin’s behavior got much worse. He was more hyperactive and angrier, and hestarted to have dreams of decomposing bodies. When she stopped the St. John’swort, his symptoms lessened. During Justin’s evaluation at my clinic, I did aSPECT scan. It showed decreased activity in his left temporal lobe. I have oftenseen that serotonergic interventions like Prozac or St. John’s wort maketemporal problems worse. It was clear to me that Justin needed an anticonvulsantmedication and a stimulant. He had a very positive response to Depakote andAdderall.Always check with your doctor before adding supplements to medication. Somesupplements will interact with medication, so caution is needed.In this chapter I will go through each ADD type and tell you what supplementsthat I have seen to have clinical benefit. I’ll give you the rationale anddosage protocols that I suggest to my patients. If you decide to use thesesupplements instead of medication, as many people do, make sure you keep tabs ontheir effectiveness. I want my patients to take only something that is clearlybeneficial. If the supplements are not fully effective, I urge you to addmedication. Many patients say that they want to try the natural supplementsbefore they try medication. I’m not opposed to that, but I worry that if thesupplements are not fully effective, patients will not pursue more effectivetreatments. Follow through to find what works for yourself or your child. Beopen to new ideas and persist until you get the best brain and life functioning.NO MATTER WHAT TYPE: 100-PERCENT MULTIVITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTNo matter what type of ADD you or your child has, take a vitamin and mineralsupplement a day. When I was in medical school, the professor who taught ourcourse in nutrition said that if people eat a balanced diet, they do not needvitamin or mineral supplements. I have seen that balanced diets are a thing ofthe past for many of our “fast-food families.” In my experience, ADD families inparticular have problems with planning and tend to eat out much more frequentlythan non-ADD families. Protect yourself and your child by taking a vitamin andmineral supplement that provides 100 percent of your daily allowances. In a 1988study published in the British journal Lancet, ninety children between the agesof 12 and 13 were divided into three groups. One group took no tablet, one grouptook a typical multiple vitamin and mineral tablet, and the last group took aplacebo. The group that took the vitamin and mineral tablet had a significantincrease in nonverbal intelligence, while the other two groups showed nodifference at all. Their subclinical vitamin and mineral deficiencies may havebeen contributing to these students’ performing below their abilities.TYPE 1 (CLASSIC) ADD AND TYPE 2 (INATTENTIVE) ADDAs already mentioned, these types seem to have deficiencies of theneurotransmitter dopamine. I frequently prescribe the amino acid L-tyrosine indoses of 500 to 1,500 milligrams two to three times a day for adults, and 100 to500 milligrams two to three times a day for children under 10. L-tyrosine is theamino acid building block for dopamine. It is reported to increase the brainlevel of phenylethylamine (PEA), a mild stimulant also found in highconcentrations in chocolate. Many of my patients have reported that it helpedthem. It is softer in its effect than the prescription stimulants. Because ofabsorption patterns, I recommend that they take it on an empty stomach (a halfhour before meals or an hour after meals). I have not seen any side effects withL-tyrosine, except for mild weight loss. L-tyrosine does not work well by itselfin treating Type 3 (Overfocused) ADD because it tends to increase the intensityof overfocused symptoms. Symptoms of dopamine deficiency include hypothyroidism,low blood pressure, low body temperature (cold hands and feet), and restless legsyndrome.Phil had been treated for Type 1 ADD for several years. He was taking Ritalin,which would work for a while and then seem to wear off. The up-and-downeffectiveness of the medication frustrated him. He tried Adderall, but it seemedto have the same effect. I stopped the stimulant medications and put him on1,000 milligrams of L-tyrosine three times a day. In addition, I urged Phil tobe vigilant about his dietary guidelines, and encouraged him to walk fast for anhour five times a week. Within a week he said he felt better. He has maintainedthe regimen for four years now.Grape-seed extract and Pycnogenol (a patented French pine bark extract) havealso shown some mild benefit for Type 1 and Type 2 ADD. Grape-seed extract andPycnogenol contain proanthocyanidin compounds. These compounds have been foundto increase blood flow and act as superantioxidants, twenty to fifty times aspowerful as vitamin E. There are no published studies on the use of thesesupplements in treating ADD, but there are a number of published case reports.TYPE 3 (OVERFOCUSED) ADDThis type of ADD seems likely due to a relative deficiency of both serotonin anddopamine. I have seen that a combination of St. John’s wort and L-tyrosine isoften very helpful. St. John’s wort comes from the flowers of the St. John’swort plant (“wort” is Old English for “plant”). It got its name either from thefact that it blooms around June 24, the feast day of St. John the Baptist, orthe red ring round the flowers that, when crushed, looks like blood—the blood ofthe beheaded John the Baptist. Much like SSRIs, St. John’s wort seems to work byincreasing serotonin availability in the brain. The starting dosage of St.John’s wort is 300 milligrams a day for children, 300 milligrams twice a day forteens, and 600 milligrams in the morning and 300 milligrams at night for adults.Sometimes I’ll go as high as a total of 1,800 milligrams per day in adults. Lookfor brands that contain 0.3% hypericin, which is believed to be the activeingredient of St. John’s wort. I have done a number of before and after SPECTstudies with St. John’s wort, and I have no doubt that it decreases anteriorcingulate gyrus hyperactivity for many patients. It also helps with moodinessand trouble shifting attention. Unfortunately, I have also seen it decreaseprefrontal cortex activity. One of the women in my study said, “I’m happier, butI’m dingier.” When anterior cingulate symptoms are present with ADD symptoms,it’s important to use St. John’s wort with a stimulating substance likeL-tyrosine or a stimulant such as Adderall. St. John’s wort may increase sunsensitivity. Also don’t use it if temporal lobe symptoms are present withoutfirst stabilizing the temporal lobes.Elaine, 16, had always been a worrier. She also had problems with anger at home.If things did not go her way, she would explode at her parents or at her youngersister. As a student she was a perfectionist, which caused her to spendexcessive time on assignments. Her mother, a school principal, brought her to myclinic after she heard me lecture. She told me that she was sure Elaine hadOverfocused ADD. Her SPECT study showed marked increased activity in heranterior cingulate gyrus. She also had mild decreased activity in her prefrontalcortex. I placed her on 600 milligrams of St. John’s wort, in the morning and300 milligrams at night. I also had her take 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine two tothree times a day. Within a month Elaine was much better. She was more relaxedand less reactive, and did much better in her classes. She said that studyingwas easy because she no longer felt the need to have everything just so. Shestill wanted to excel but didn’t have to copy pages over three and four timesuntil things were perfect.L-tryptophan (the amino acid building block for serotonin) and 5-HTP (also aserotonin building block) are other ways of increasing cerebral serotonin.L-tryptophan was taken off the market a number of years ago because onecontaminated batch, from one manufacturer, caused a rare blood disease and anumber of deaths. The L-tryptophan actually had nothing to do with the deaths.L-tryptophan is a naturally occurring amino acid found in milk, meat, and eggs.I have found it helps patients improve sleep, decrease aggressiveness, andimprove mood control. In addition, it does not have side effects—a realadvantage over antidepressants. L-tryptophan was recently reapproved by the Foodand Drug Administration and is now available by prescription. One of theproblems with dietary L-tryptophan is that a significant portion of it does notenter the brain. The body uses it up to make proteins and vitamin B3. Thisnecessitates taking large amounts of tryptophan. I recommend L-tryptophan indoses of 1,000 to 3,000 milligrams taken at bedtime.5-HTP is a step closer in the serotonin production pathway (see below). It isalso more widely available than L-tryptophan and is more easily taken up in thebrain. Seventy percent is taken up into the brain, as opposed to only 3 percentof L-tryptophan. A number of double blind studies have shown 5-HTP to be aseffective as antidepressant medication in treating depression. 5-HTP boostsserotonin levels in the brain and helps to calm anterior cingulate gyrushyperactivity (“greasing” the anterior cingulate, if you will, to help it shiftattention). The dose of 5-HTP for adults is 50 to 300 milligrams a day. Childrenshould start at half dose. Take 5-HTP and L-tryptophan on an empty stomach forbetter absorption. The mostcommon side effect of 5-HTP is an upset stomach. It is usually very mild. Toeliminate it, start with a small dose and work your way up slowly.SEROTONIN PATHWAYimage [Images/page282.jpg]There have also been some recent studies with Inositol, a vitamin from the Bvitamin family, which is available from health food stores. In doses of 12 to 20milligrams a day, it has been shown to decrease moodiness, depression, andoverfocus issues.Do not take St. John’s wort, L-tryptophan, or 5-HTP with prescribedantidepressants without the knowledge and close supervision of your physician.TYPE 4 (TEMPORAL LOBE) ADDTemporal Lobe ADD is a combination of temporal lobe dysfunction and poorprefrontal cortex activity. Strategies geared toward temporal lobe stabilizationand enhancement have proven valuable for this ADD type. We suspect that themedications that work for Type 4 enhance the availability of the amino acidgama-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an essential neurotransmitter in the brain.Formed in the body from glutamic acid, GABA calms neuronal activity and inhibitsnerve cells from overfiring or firing erratically. GABA can be taken as asupplement. It acts like an anticonvulsant and also as an antianxiety agent. Inthe herbal literature it is reported to work in much the same way as diazepam(Valium), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), and other tranquilizers, but without thefear of addiction. I have seen it have a nice calming effect on people whostruggle with temper, irritability, and anxiety—all which may be temporal lobesymptoms. The doses of GABA range from 100 to 500 milligrams a day for adults,half that for children.Many people with temporal lobe problems suffer from memory problems. I havefound a number of natural substances helpful to enhance memory. These include: * Phosphatidyl serine (PS) plays a major role in determining the integrity and fluidity of brain cell membranes. Normally the brain can manufacture sufficient levels of PS, but if there is a deficiency of folic acid, vitamin B12, or essential fatty acids, the brain may not be able to make enough. Low levels of PS are also associated with memory problems and depression in the elderly. I often recommend PS as a supplement for memory problems. There are eighteen double-blind studies that report how effective PS can be for memory issues. In the largest study, 494 elderly patients (ages 65 to 93) with moderate to severe senility were given PS (100 milligrams three times a day) or a placebo for six months. The patients were assessed for cognitive function, behavior, and mood at the beginning and end of the study. Statistically significant improvements in all three areas were noted in the PS group. I recommend that my patients take 100 milligrams twice a day for two weeks then, if needed, 100 milligrams three times a day for memory. * Ginkgo biloba, from ginkgo trees, is a powerful antioxidant that is best known for its ability to enhance circulation. In a number of studies at major universities, ginkgo biloba has been shown to improve energy, concentration, focus, and memory. Ginkgo biloba has been reported to enhance cerebral blood flow and reduce or slow the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. There are many different forms of ginkgo, making dosing confusing. Ginkoba and Ginkgold (Nature’s Way) are brands that have been compounded to reflect those done in the major studies on ginkgo biloba. I recommend doses of 60 to 120 milligrams twice a day. * Vitamin E is an antioxidant that has been shown to be helpful for many things, including memory problems and muscle movement disorders. Doses of 400 to 600 IU twice a day are often recommended for enhancing memory. Choose the “natural” form of vitamin E. * Ibuprofen, an antiinflammatory pain medication, has been shown in several studies to enhance memory and decrease the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. It probably works by decreasing inflammation in the brain, allowing for better circulation. Doses of 200 milligrams twice a day are usually recommended. Do not take ibuprofen if you suffer from ulcers or other gastrointestinal problems.TYPE 5 (LIMBIC) ADDLimbic ADD has many symptoms of mild depression, including negativity, sadness,feelings of hopelessness, and an overabundance of ANTs (automatic negativethoughts). The supplements that seem to help this type of ADD best areDL-phenylalanine (DLPA), L-tyrosine, and S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAMe).DLPA is the amino acid precursor for norepinephrine. In a number of studiesnorepinephrine and epinephrine (adrenaline) have been shown to be low in peoplewith ADD and/or depression. The antidepressants imipramine and desipramine workby increasing norepinephrine in the brain. DLPA, by boosting norepinephrine’sprecursor, can have a positive impact on mood and focus. In a number of studiesDLPA has been found to be helpful for depression, energy, and pain control. Ihave used it for fifteen years as a mild antidepressant in children, teens, andadults. It is more mild in its effect than prescribed antidepressants, but italso has significantly fewer side effects. People who have PKU (phenylketonuria)should not take DLPA, as they do not have the enzyme that metabolizes it. Irecommend doses of 400 milligrams three times a day on an empty stomach, halfthat dose for children.Another effective supplemental treatment for Type 5 (Limbic) ADD is SAMe.Involved in the production of many important brain compounds, such asneurotransmitters, SAMe’s unique chemical action (it’s called a methyl donor, arare property) helps the brain to function properly. Normally the bodymanufactures all the SAMe it needs from the amino acid methionine. In depressedpeople, however, this synthesis can be impaired. Supplementing the diet withSAMe increases the neurotransmitters involved with depression and improves cellmembrane fluidity. SAMe is one of the best natural antidepressants available,and a number of recent studies have shown that it is as effective asantidepressant medication. SAMe has also been found helpful for people whosuffer from fibromyalgia, a chronic muscle pain disorder. Fibromyalgia and ADDcommonly coexist. I think the chronic stress associated with ADD is in partresponsible for the muscle pain. People who have bipolar disorder ormanic-depressive illness or Type 6 (“Ring of Fire”) ADD should not take SAMe.There have been reports of a number cases where SAMe induced manic or hypomanicepisodes (excessively up or happy moods, extreme impulsivity in sexuality orspending money, pressured speech, or decreased need for sleep). I think thesereports highlight that SAMe is an effective antidepressant, considering that allthe prescription antidepressants have that capability as well. The dosage ofSAMe is between 200 and 400 milligrams two to four times a day, and half thatfor children.TYPE 6 (“RING OF FIRE”) ADDType 6 (“Ring of Fire”) ADD is often associated with fierce ADD symptoms, suchas intense hyperactivity and distractibility, severe impulsiveness,hypersensitivity to the environment, pressured speech, and cyclic mood changes.As already discussed, this type of ADD may be related to bipolar disorder.Stimulants tend to make it worse. However, GABA and fish oil often have apositive effect on Type 6 (“Ring of Fire”) ADD. GABA, which was discussed underType 4 (Temporal Lobe) ADD, has a calming effect on nerve cells. In “Ring ofFire” ADD there is diffuse hyperactivity throughout the brain, and GABA has beenhelpful for a number of my patients.Supplementation with fish oils containing high levels of omega-3 fatty acidsalso helps. An insufficiency of omega-3 fatty acids has been linked to both ADDand depression. This may be related to how fatty acids make up nerve cellmembranes. Without high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, the nerve cell membranesare less fluid, possibly causing nerve cells to react sluggishly or misfire.Population based studies in various countries (including the U.S.) haveindicated that decreased consumption of omega-3 fatty acids correlates withincreased rates of depression. Well-intentioned dietary advice to lowercholesterol levels tends to harm the balance of fatty acids (especially theessential omega-3, DHA) in the body. Recent studies have suggested that loweringlevels of plasma cholesterol too much increases the risk of suicide, homicide,and depression. Clearly, omega-3 fatty acids are essential to good brain health.A study done at Harvard and reported in the Archives of General Psychiatrydemonstrated that supplementation with high-dose administration of purified fishoils provided a statistically significant improvement in bipolar depression.Here are three ways to boost the level of omega-3 fatty acids in the body: * eliminate transfatty acids by avoiding margarine, shortening, and most processed foods ( to improve the ration of good fatty acids to bad fatty acids) * increase the consumption of tuna and other cold water fish, such as salmon, mackerel, herring, and halibut * take 1 tablespoon a day of flaxseed oil.Here’s an example of how the right supplements can literally change someone’slife. Stuart was 11 years old when he first came to see us. His grandmother hadheard me speak at a conference and she knew from my description that he had the“Ring of Fire” type. He was argumentative, angry, moody, inattentive,hyperactive, easily distracted, and very sensitive to noise in the environment.He had been tried on a number of traditional treatments without success. HisSPECT study showed a severe “Ring of Fire” pattern with hyperactivity throughouthis whole cortex. We put him on a combination of GABA, omega-3 fatty acids, andSt. John’s wort. Within two months he was dramatically different. When werepeated his SPECT study, we were delighted by his progress.Stuart’s Concentration SPECT Study Before Treatmentimage [Images/page287a.jpg]top down active viewimage [Images/page287b.jpg]left side active viewStuart’s Concentration SPECT Study with Supplement Treatmentimage [Images/page288a.jpg]top-down active viewimage [Images/page288b.jpg]left-side active view"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20NEUROFEEDBACK STRATEGIES FOR ADD TYPESOver the past twenty years, Joel Lubar, Ph.D., of the University of Tennessee;Sigfried Othmer of EEG Spectrum in Los Angeles; Michael Linden, Ph.D., of SanClemente, California; and other clinicians have reported the effectiveness ofbrainwave biofeedback, also known as neurofeedback, in the treatment of ADDchildren and teenagers. Biofeedback, in general, is a treatment technique thatutilizes instruments to measure physiological responses in a person’s body (suchas hand temperature, sweat gland activity, breathing rates, heart rates, bloodpressure, and brainwave patterns). It’s the same technique I explored when I wasan army psychiatrist. The instruments then feed the information on these bodysystems back to the patient, who can then learn how to change them. Inneurofeedback, electrodes are placed on the scalp, measuring the number and typeof brainwave patterns.There are five types of brainwave patterns: * delta waves (1 to 4 cycles per second), very slow brainwaves, seen mostly during sleep * theta waves (5–7 cycles per second), slow brainwaves, seen during daydreaming and twilight states * alpha waves (8 to 12 cycles per second), brainwaves seen during relaxed states * SMR (sensorimotor rhythm) waves (12–15 cycles per second), brainwaves seen during states of focused relaxation * beta waves (13 to 24 cycles per second), fast brainwaves seen during concentration or mental work states.In evaluating over 1,200 children with ADD, Dr. Lubar has found that the basicissue for these children is their inability to maintain beta concentrationstates for sustained periods of time. He also found that these children haveexcessive theta daydreaming brainwave activity. Dr. Lubar found that through theuse of neurofeedback, children can be taught to increase the amount of betabrainwaves and decrease the amount of theta or daydreaming brainwaves. They cantrain their brains to be more active.The basic neurofeedback technique asks the patient—child, teen, oradult—literally to play mind games. The patient’s brain is hooked up to thecomputer equipment through electrodes placed on the head. (Don’t worry, no brainsurgery here!) The computer feeds back to the patient the type of brainwaveactivity it’s monitoring. The patient is rewarded for producing concentration orbeta waves, and the more beta states he or she produces, the more rewardsaccrued. On the neurofeedback equipment, for example, a child sits in front of acomputer monitor and watches a game screen that reflects the composition of hisor her brainwaves. If the child increases beta activity or decreases thetaactivity, the game continues. The game stops, however, when the patient cannotmaintain the desired brainwave states. Children find the screen fun and many areable to gradually shape their brainwave patterns to more normal ones. Thistreatment technique is not an overnight cure. Children often have to doneurofeedback for one to two years to produce significant improvement.In my experience with neurofeedback and ADD, many people are able to improvetheir reading skills and decrease their need for medication. Also, neurofeedbackhas helped to decrease impulsivity and aggressiveness. It is a powerful tool, inpart because we are making the patients part of the treatment process and givingthem more control over their own physiological processes.The use of neurofeedback is considered controversial by many clinicians andresearchers. More published research needs to be done in order to demonstrateits long-term effectiveness. Some of the controversy stems from exaggeratedclaims for neurofeedback. Some clinics have advertised that they can cure ADDwith neurofeedback alone. That is not my experience. Overselling neurofeedbackhas hurt its credibility, but in my clinical experience it is a powerful andexciting treatment and we are yet to see its full development.SPECT HELPS TO FOCUS NEUROFEEDBACKThrough SPECT we have seen that ADD is a complex condition. Thereforesuccessfully treating it requires more than one neurofeedback treatment. Thefigure below shows standard electrode placements. For people interested inneurofeedback, here is a list of training sites that we use in our office forthe different ADD Types. Share them with the neurofeedback professional in yourarea.TYPE 1 (CLASSIC) ADD AND TYPE 2 (INATTENTIVE) ADDClassic and Inattentive ADD shows decreased activity (excessive theta activityand poor beta activity) in the prefrontal cortex. It is helpful to do theneurofeedback training as close to the prefrontal poles as possible. Thetraining consists of enhancing prefrontal beta activity and decreasingprefrontal theta activity.Joey, age 7, was brought to our clinic by his mother for hyperactivity,restlessness, impulse control problems, inattention, and distractibility. Sheheard about our work with neurofeedback and wanted an alternative to medication.Joey did neurofeedback twice a week for two years. After six months we beganseeing significant changes, including less hyperactivity and longer ability tofocus. In addition, his interest in reading significantly increased. After hestopped the neurofeedback, he continued to do well in school and at home. Hemaintained an exercise program and a higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate diet.Standard Electrode Placement Areas (Top-Down and Left-Side Views)image [Images/page292.jpg]frontbackFP = frontal polesF = frontal lobe areasC = central areasP = parietal lobe areasT = temporal lobe areasO = occipital lobe areasType 1 & 2 Training Siteimage [Images/page293.jpg]TYPE 3 (OVERFOCUSED) ADDIn Overfocused ADD there is excessive activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus.It is helpful to do the neurofeedback training over the front central part ofthe brain between FZ and CZ. This training helps people shift attention and feelmore settled, less worried, and more easygoing. It also enhances attention span.The training focuses on enhancing high alpha activity (relaxed but focused).Monica, age 17, came to the clinic for problems with anxiety, worrying, temperoutbursts, poor school performance, and oppositional behavior. Her symptoms weremuch worse right before the onset of her menstrual period. She was inpsychotherapy for two years, which seemed to help her temper problems but nother oppositional behavior or school performance. She had tried Prozac and Paxilwith her family doctor, but she did not like the side effects. Monica’s SPECTstudy showed marked increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus on boththe rest and concentration studies. When she learned about neurofeedback, sheliked the idea of learning how to control her own brain (sort of a “anteriorcingulate control thing”). We did neurofeedback over her anterior cingulategyrus twice a week for six months. In the first month she noticed less worrying.By the end of six months she felt more focused, less anxious, and morecooperative, an assessment her family validated. Nevertheless, she still had ahard time right before her period. I placed her on a small dose of St. John’swort (300 milligrams twice day), which seemed to smooth out her menstrual moodswings.Type 3 Training Siteimage [Images/page294.jpg]frontTYPE 4 (TEMPORAL LOBE) ADDTemporal Lobe ADD has decreased activity (excessive theta activity) over thetemporal lobes on one or both sides. Neurofeedback training over the affectedtemporal lobe seems to do the most good. We have seen this training improve moodstability, reading ability, and memory. The training consists of enhancing SMRactivity and suppressing theta activity over the affected temporal lobe.Marty, age 14, came to see us for temper outbursts, memory problems, poorreading skills, inattention, disorganization, and language problems (he hadproblems finding the right words and he often misunderstood people). His SPECTstudy showed significantly decreased activity in his left temporal lobe at rest.When he concentrated, the temporal lobe activity decreased even further alongwith his prefrontal cortex. He had had a poor response to Ritalin and hisparents were hesitant to try an anticonvulsant medication. They wanted to trynonmedication options first, and they liked the idea of neurofeedback. Westarted neurofeedback training over Marty’s left temporal lobe. Within twomonths we noticed that his reading was starting to improve and his temper wasbetter. After six months Marty’s moods began to show stability. Once thathappened, we started training his prefrontal cortex to be more active. Helearned quickly. After eighteen months of training, Marty felt more in controlof himself and much improved. In addition to training, he also exercisedregularly and ate a consistent simple carbohydrate-free diet.Type 4 Training Siteimage [Images/page295.jpg]TYPE 5 (LIMBIC) ADDIn Limbic ADD there is decreased activity in the left prefrontal cortex andincreased activity in the deep limbic areas. Since the limbic areas are too deepin the brain to do neurofeedback training, we have found that teaching thepatient to increase beta activity over the left prefrontal cortex has the mostbeneficial effect. This training helps improve focus and mood while decreasingnegativity and negative thoughts. Of interest, a new treatment for depressiontermed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses powerful magnets to increaseblood flow in this part of the brain. TMS has been shown to be very effective inresistant depression and in the future may be helpful for this type of ADD.Robbie, 42, came to see me after he had lost his job and was nearly homeless. Hewas disheveled, lethargic, and demoralized. His history and SPECT studiesclearly indicated that he had Limbic ADD. His whole life he had underachieved inschool and barely finished high school even though he had been tested as havingan IQ of 120 (bright normal). He was disorganized, inattentive, and easilydistracted. Teachers used to say that he did not live up to his potential andthat he would do better if he tried harder. There were also teacher comments onhis report cards that he should try to be more cheerful and positive. He wantedto do neurofeedback instead of medication. Robbie trained his left prefrontalcortex to be more active. At first the training was very slow. It took him sixmonths to be able to tune in to his own brainwave patterns. But once he caughton to how to do the neurofeedback, the training went much faster. Within a yearhe felt better energy and he was more positive. He went to junior college andenrolled in an airline mechanics course. He got straight A’s in the course andwas very proud of his abilities. He surprised himself by discovering a hiddenartistic side, and he started bringing us sculptures and drawings. At the end ofthree years of neurofeedback training, he was significantly better. Five yearslater he remains so.Type 5 Training Siteimage [Images/page296.jpg]TYPE 6 (“RING OF FIRE”) ADDThe neurofeedback protocol for this type of ADD is unknown at this time. Due tothe diffuse nature of the cerebral hyperactivity, we doubt that one trainingsite will work. It’s possible that multiple training sites will be helpful, suchas SMR training over the parietal and lateral prefrontal areas and high alphatraining over the anterior cingulate area, but it is yet to be determined.AUDIO-VISUAL STIMULATIONA similar treatment to neurofeedback is something called audio-visualstimulation. This technique was developed by Harold Russell, Ph.D., and JohnCarter, Ph.D., psychologists at the University of Texas, Galveston. Both Drs.Russell and Carter were involved in the treatment of ADD children withneurofeedback, but they wanted to develop a treatment technique that could beavailable to more children. They based their technique on a concept termed“entrainment,” in which brainwaves pick up the rhythm of the environment aroundthem. Drs. Russell and Carter developed special glasses and headphones thatflash lights and sounds at specific frequencies that help the brain “tune in” toa more focused state. Patients wear these glasses for thirty to forty-fiveminutes a day.I have tried this treatment on a number of patients, with some encouragingresults. One patient, who developed tics on both Ritalin and Dexedrine, triedthe glasses for a month. His ADD symptoms significantly improved. When he wentoff the audio-visual stimulator, his symptoms returned. The symptoms againsubsided when he retried the treatment.I believe that both neurofeedback and audio-visual stimulation techniques showpromise for the future. More research is needed in these promising areas.BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT SUMMARYHere is a summary of the biological treatments for each type:image [Images/page298.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PART 4OPTIMIZING THE ADD LIFE"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21PARENTING AND FAMILY STRATEGIESE ven those with the best parenting skills deteriorate when they’re up againstthe day-to-day stress of ADD kids, and intervention with the parents and familyis crucial to a healthy outcome for these children. Having an ADD child orteenager is often extremely stressful on a family system. Siblings are oftenembarrassed by the child’s behavior, and parents often feel guilty forstruggling so much with these children. One of the most helpful things I havedone for these families is to lead a weekly parent education and support group.When parents become more effective with these children, the entire householddoes better.Before undertaking parent training, it is important to screen parents and othersiblings for ADD. Untreated ADD in parents or siblings sabotages treatment.Untreated ADD parents are often unable to follow through on their homework.Untreated siblings can disrupt the progress of the child or teen in treatment.Here is a summary of the important points from the parenting course: * Be focused. Set clear goals for yourself as a parent and for your child. Then make sure that you act in a manner consistent with your goals. * Relationship is key. With a good parent-child relationship, almost any form of discipline will work. With a poor parent-child relationship, any form of discipline will probably fail. Relationships require two things: time and a willingness to listen. * Spend some “special time” with your child each day, even if it’s only ten to fifteen minutes. Being available to the child will help him or her feel important and enhance self-esteem. * Be a good listener. Find out what the child thinks before you tell him or her what you think. * Be clear about what you expect. It is effective for families to have posted rules, spelling out the “laws” and values of the family. For example: “We treat each other with respect, which means no yelling, no hitting, no name calling or putdowns. We look for ways to make each other’s lives easier.” * When a child lives up to the rules and expectations, be sure to notice him or her. If you never reinforce good behavior, you’re unlikely to get much of it. * Notice the behaviors you like in your child ten times more than the behaviors you don’t like. This teaches them to notice what they like about themselves, rather than to grow up with a negative self-image. * Mean what you say. Don’t allow guilt to cause you to back down on what you know is right. * Don’t tell a child ten times to do something. Expect a child to comply the first time! Be ready to back up your words. * Never discipline a child when you’re out of control. Take time out before you lose your cool. * Use discipline to teach a child rather than to punish or get even for bad behavior. * See misbehavior as a problem you’re going to solve rather than that “the child is just trying to make you mad.” * It’s important to have swift, clear consequences for broken rules, enforced in a matter-of-fact and unemotional way. Nagging and yelling are extremely destructive as well as ineffective, and tend to be addictive to the ADD child. * Give a child choices between alternatives, rather than dictating what they’ll do, eat, or wear. If you make all the decisions for your child, he or she will be unable to make decisions independently later on. * Parents need to be together and support each other. When children are allowed to split parental authority, they have far more power than is good for them. * Keep promises to children. * Children learn about relationships from watching how their parents relate to each other. Are you setting a good example? * Be careful of the nicknames and phrases you use to describe your children. Children live up to the labels we give them. * Parents need time for themselves. Parents who are drained do not have much left that is good for their children. * Teach your children from your own real-life experiences. * In parenting, always remember the words “firm but kind.” One parent used the phrase “tough as nails and kind as a lamb.” Try to balance them at the same time. * Do not yell at, hit or berate an ADD child. The more emotionally intense you get, the more they will bring out the animal in you.GET RID OF GUILTPerhaps the biggest roadblock to effective discipline of ADD children and teensis guilt. Too often parents allow guilt to get in their way and render themtotally ineffective in dealing with the difficult child.Here is the guilt cycle that often perpetuates bad behavior. 1. Parent explodes because he or she can’t take the bad behavior anymore. 2. Parent feels guilt because he or she overreacted or was excessively harsh. 3. Parent allows the child to get away with misbehavior because of his or her guilt over the explosion toward the child. 4. Parent feels tension building up because he or she is not effectively dealing with the misbehavior. 5. Parent explodes and the cycle starts all over again.It’s very important when dealing with the ADD child to break the guilt cycle. Dothis is by dealing with difficult behavior whenever it occurs. Do not allow thetension to build up in you to the point where you explode.STEPS TO SHAPING POSITIVE BEHAVIORRetraining difficult behavior patterns is an essential part of the treatment forADD. As I’ve mentioned, having this disorder causes faulty learning in manyareas of life. For example, many children with ADD are repeatedly given themessage that they’re stupid(i.e., by parent or teacher complaints and/or bybeing teased by other children). Too often, they begin to believe they reallyare stupid. As such, they stop doing their work, believing it is too hard forthem.Behaviorally, many children, teens, and adults learn to get other people upsetwith their difficult behavior. They learn, on a purely unconscious andbiological level, that when there is turmoil between people, it stimulates theirbrain, making them feel more alert and awake. They do not know this on aconscious level and would, in fact, deny that they ever do it. But when youwatch these people with their parents or in social situations, their behaviorseems goal-directed toward turmoil. After listening to hundreds of mothers, I’mconvinced that this is a technique to treat underlying brain deactivation withturmoil, as an alcoholic may treat underlying restlessness or anxiety withalcohol.Retraining behavior patterns or behavior modification involves several clearsteps:Step One:Define the desired and undesirable behaviors specifically.Step Two:Establish a baseline period.Step Three:Communicate the rules and expectations clearly.Step Four:Reward desired behavior.Step Five:Give clear, unemotional consequences for the negative behavior.Step OneDefine the desired and undesirable behaviors specifically. Before you can shapebehavior, it is critical to clearly know exactly what behaviors you want andwhat behaviors you don’t want.Step TwoEstablish a baseline period of how often either negative or positive behavioroccurs. Take some time (a week to a month) to keep a log on how many times abehavior occurs. For example, if the desired behavior is getting homework donebefore a child or teen goes out of the house, keep a log on how many times thatoccurs during the baseline period. Doing this will allow you to know whether ornot your interventions are effective.Step ThreeCommunicate rules and expectations clearly. Establishing clear, written rulesand expectations is the next step in effective behavior modification. Theserules need to give direction for the child’s behavior. When the child knows whatis expected, he or she is much more likely to be able to give it. Too often,parents believe that children should know how to act without the rules beingclearly communicated to them.Children respond to symbols of rules in the environment (traffic signals, postedrules at the pool, etc.). My nephew Andrew went through a time when he was threeyears old during which he was afraid of monsters in his room at night. Weekafter week Andrew’s parents searched the room with Andrew, trying to prove tohim that there were no monsters in his room. They looked under the bed, in thecloset, behind the door, and under the covers. Finally they realized that theywere only making the fear worse by exploring the room for the monsters. Andrew’smother decided that they would make a sign saying that monsters were not allowedin Andrew’s room. She and Andrew drew a picture of a monster and then drew a redcircle around it with a slash across the monster. Underneath the picture theywrote NO MONSTERS ALLOWED. Amazingly, Andrew’s fear of monsters in his roomvanished because he knew the sign kept them away.Written rules have power! They let children know what is expected of them in aclear way. They keep the standards of good behavior unambiguous and serve as atouch point for clear, unemotional consequences.Here is a set of rules that I’ve found helpful, both for my own household andfor my patients’. Post them up where the family can see them every day.FAMILY RULESTELL THE TRUTHTREAT EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT(which means no yelling, no hitting, no kicking, no name calling, and no puttingdown).NO ARGUING WITH PARENTS.(As parents, we want and value your input and ideas,but arguing means you havemade your point more than twice.)RESPECT EACH OTHER’S PROPERTY(which means we ask permission to use something that does not belong to us).DO WHAT MOM AND DAD SAY THE FIRST TIME(without complaining or throwing a fit).ASK PERMISSION BEFORE YOU GO SOMEWHERE.PUT THINGS AWAY THAT YOU TAKE OUT.LOOK FOR WAYS TO BE KIND AND HELPFUL TO EACH OTHER.These rules set the tone and “values” for the family. They clearly state thatthere is a line of authority at home, and that it is expected that children willfollow the rules and respect their parents, their siblings, and the family’sproperty. These are good social expectations and teachings. When you tellsomeone what you expect, you’re much more likely to get it.In establishing expectations at home, it’s often important to use visual clues,such as pictures or short printed directions. Try to minimize verbal directions,since people with ADD may have trouble processing verbal input, especially in anoisy environment. Writing expectations down also has the advantage of beingable to refer to it later when the ADD person denies that you ever told him orher about it.Step FourReward desired behavior. After clear expectations are given, it is essential topraise and reward the behavior that meets those expectations. When positivebehavior goes unnoticed, it often ceases to exist. Most children, teens, andeven adults enjoy being noticed by others. Rewards or reinforcements may takemany forms. As adults, we often work for monetary gain. The more financialbenefit, the harder we’ll work. But we also work for praise from our boss orspouse. Our personalities also determine the rewards we’re interested in workingtoward. Children are the same way: Some children will work hard to comply forthe verbal praise of their parents, while others need different types ofrewards. Social rewards: verbal praise (“I really like it when you…”); physicalaffection, such as hugs or looks.Material rewards: toys, food, “Clean your room before your snack,” littlepresents or surprises.Activity rewards: sports, trips to library, park, arcade.Token rewards: star or point systems, money. Here are some simple principles in rewarding good behavior: * Use more rewards than consequences. * Reward as soon as possible after a child fulfills your expectations. * Focus your energy on catching them being good. * Look for ways to reinforce them. * Reward the child in a way he or she likes. (All children are different; use what works!) * Be consistent. * Make it to the child’s benefit to behave.Many parents object to the use of reward systems when it comes to reinforcinggood behavior. They say, “I’m not going to bribe my child to behave. They shoulddo it anyway.” I respond that the definition of a bribe is to give someonesomething of value to encourage them to do something illegal. Behaving is notillegal! Generally, adults would not go to work if there were not some sort ofpayoff. It is important to think that children also work for goals and payoffsthat turn them on. For difficult kids, it is often necessary to set up a tokensystem or a point system to help keep them on track.Here is a simple five-step “point” or “chip” system that has worked well forhundreds of parents. 1. Choose * three chores (such as doing the dishes, cleaning his or her room, vacuuming, feeding the animals, etc.) * three behaviors (such as treating his or her sister well, getting ready for school on time, doing what Mom and Dad say the first time, etc.). 2. Assign a point (or poker chip) value to each chore and behavior, depending on how difficult each is for the child to accomplish. If the child has a lot of trouble doing something, make it worth more points or chips than something he or she does readily. Add up the possible points or chips the child can get each day if he or she has a perfect day. Also, let the child know that he or she can earn bonus points or chips for especially cooperative and pleasant behavior. Tell the child that points or chips will be given only for chores and behaviors done on the first request. If you have to repeat yourself, the child will not get any points or chips, and he will still have to do it! 3. Establish two lists of rewards: * one for future incentives the child wishes to work for (a toy, having a friend spend the night, a special trip to a restaurant or arcade, renting a video, etc.) * another list for everyday rewards (watching TV, playing with friends, playing video games, staying up an extra half hour, etc.). 4. Determine the point value necessary to redeem each reward. About half should be spent on everyday rewards. This allows a child, if he or she has a really good day, to save about half of the accumulated points or chips for special rewards down the line. 5. Add up the points every day. Allow the child to use his or her rewards to buy everyday privileges and keep a “savings account” for points or chips to be used later on. This works to teach them the value and need for saving.Note: * Initially, make the system very reinforcing so that children will want to participate. Then slowly tighten the reins on it as their behavior improves. * You can use the rewards for almost any behavior you like. * Reward as quickly as possible. * Do not give chips or points away before the actual behavior or chore is done. In this system there is no credit!FAT FREDDY AND CHANGING BEHAVIORAnyone who has been to my clinic in Fairfield knows that I collect penguins. Inow have over a thousand penguins in my office. They remind me of the need toshape behavior in a positive way. I used to live in Hawaii. On the island ofOahu there is a place by the name of Sea Life Park. At Sea Life Park they had apenguin show, and the star penguin’s name was Fat Freddy. Freddy could doamazing things. He could jump off a twenty-foot board, he could bowl with hisnose, he could count—he even jumped through a hoop of fire. I remember watchingFreddy’s show with my son, Antony, who was seven at the time.Toward the end of the show, the trainer asked Freddy to go get something. Freddywent and got it and brought it right back. I was taken aback when I saw that. Ithought to myself, “I ask this kid to get me something and he wants to have adiscussion with me for twenty minutes and then he doesn’t want to do it. What’sthe difference? I know my son is smarter than this penguin.” Anyway, we went upto the trainer after the show and I asked her how she got Freddy to do all ofthose really neat things. The trainer looked at my son and then she looked at meand she said, “Unlike parents, whenever Freddy does anything like what I wanthim to do, I notice him. I give him a hug and then I give him a fish.”Even though my son didn’t like fish, the light really turned on in my head:Whenever he did things that I liked, I paid no attention to him at all becauseI’m a busy guy. But whenever he did something I didn’t like, I gave him a ton ofattention because I don’t want to raise bad kids. Well, guess what I was doing:I was encouraging him to be a pain in the neck. By misbehaving he got noticedmore and more by me!So I collect penguins as a way to remind myself to notice the good things aboutthe people in my life a lot more than the bad things about them. This is theessence of shaping behavior.Step FiveAdminister clear, unemotional consequences for negative behavior. In order forconsequences to be effective, they must be used with the other steps in shapingbehavior, i.e., clear expectations and positive reinforcement. Consequences bythemselves change nothing, but when used in conjunction with the other steps ofthe program, they can be very powerful in helping to parent the difficult child.I once saw an interaction between a mother and her 4-year-old son in a grocerystore that turned my stomach. After the child ran off for the third time, themother jerked him by the arm, picked him off the ground, and whacked him so hardhis little body flew into the air. She then slammed him down into the cart andsaid, “You little brat, do what I say!” With a panicked look, he held his littlearms up to hug her, at which point she turned and looked away from him. He thenstarted to cry.Too often parents punish children as a reaction to the anger they feel insideand when they’re out of control of themselves. This type of punishment causesthe child to feel frightened and angry and the parent to feel guilty andfrustrated.It’s important to distinguish between punishment and discipline. Punishmentmeans to inflict a penalty for wrongdoing. Discipline, from the root word“disciple,” means to teach or train. It’s critical that we use discipline toteach children how to be good, rather than inflict punishment when they’re not.As I mentioned above, reinforcing good behavior is a much more effective changeagent than giving consequences to bad behavior. Yet, there still are times whenconsequences are needed.Here are eight components of effective discipline: 1. A good relationship with a child is a prerequisite to effective discipline. When parents have a good relationship with a child, almost any form of discipline is effective. When the relationship is poor, however, almost no form of discipline works well. Never discipline children in a way that damages your relationship with them. 2. You must be in control of yourself. If you feel like you’re going to explode, take a timeout: Take several deep breaths, count to fifty, hit a pillow, take a walk, call a friend—do anything to avoid exploding at the child. It’s impossible to discipline effectively when you’re out of control, and it does more harm than good. 3. Don’t yell, nag, or belittle! What happens inside you when someone yells, nags, or belittles you? If you’re like me, you immediately turn them off. These are ineffective techniques, and they harm the relationship more than they help the situation. Also remember: When you feel like yelling, talk softly. (The difference in your behavior will get their attention.) 4. Have a goal in mind for the behavior you’re trying to change. For the mother in the grocery store, the goal was to get the child to stay near her. She would be more effective if she gave him a lot of positive attention for the time he stays near her, rather than giving him a lot of negative attention when he goes away. By viewing the process to change the behaviors you don’t like in a positive light, you’re more likely to be helpful to your child. 5. Develop a plan for discipline before you’re actually in the situation. This also prevents you from overreacting. Discipline should be as immediate as possible and should be a reminder to the child on how to change his or her behavior. It should not be an assault. I often recommend a short timeout method for younger children and a slightly longer one for older children. Parents can also have their children write lines or essays on how they’ll change their behavior. 6. Whenever possible, use natural and logical consequences. Ask yourself, What’s the natural or logical consequence to the misbehavior? If the child refuses to do his or her homework, then he or she goes to school without it. If the child is acting up at dinner, then he or she doesn’t get to finish dinner if everyone else is done. If the child refuses to put away his or her toys, then it is logical that the toys will be taken away for several days. Using these natural or logical consequences help children learn cause and effect and teaches them that they are responsible for their behavior. 7. Attitude is everything. Many parents ask my opinion on spanking. I generally tell them that whether or not you spank a child has nothing to do with effective discipline. How you discipline, not the method, is what’s important. When you mildly spank a child on the buttocks when you’re in control of yourself, for a specific reason, and afterward give the child a hug, then spanking can be very effective. However, most parents don’t use it that way. They spank a child when they’re angry and on the verge of being out of control themselves. Use discipline for teaching. You and your child will both feel better. 8. Never withhold love, affection, or time from a child who has misbehaved. When children are in trouble, they need you the most. Let them know it’s their behavior you’re disciplining, but you still love them very much.A TIMEOUT METHOD THAT WORKSWhen used properly, Timeout is an extremely effective discipline technique forchildren 2 to 12 years of age. Use following guidelines: * Give clear commands. For example, “Antony, take out the trash now.” And then count to five or ten seconds to yourself. If you count out loud, you teach the child to cue off your voice. * Expect immediate compliance. We teach our kids when to respond to us. When we repeat ourselves ten times and then get serious with a child, we’re teaching them not to listen to us until the tenth time we say something. Expect your child to obey you the first time you say something. When they do comply, notice and appreciate them. (In our example, “Thanks Antony, I really like it when you do what I say the first time.”) * When the child doesn’t comply, warn them only once and give them the choice to comply or not. In our case, “Antony, I told you to take out the trash now [spoken in a firm but not hostile tone]. You have a choice: You can take it out now or you can spend ten minutes in Timeout and then you can do it. It’s up to you.” * If the child still doesn’t comply immediately, put him or her in Timeout! * Timeouts are best served in a neutral, boring corner of the house. Don’t use the child’s bedroom because you have probably gone to great lengths and expense to make his or her bedroom a nice place to be. Use a Timeout chair, because there may be times when the child has to be in it for a while. Also, with a chair you can set the rule that in order for the child to be in Timeout, both buttocks need to be on the seat of the chair. * The time in Timeout should be the child’s age in minutes or twice his or her age in minutes for more severe offenses. For example, if the child is 5 years old, the Timeout should be five minutes long (or ten minutes if it was a particularly bad offense). It’s often good to get a timer to clearly set the time. * A child’s time starts when he or she is quiet. Children should not be allowed to badger parents when they are in Timeout. It is a time for them to think about their behavior, and they can’t think about it when their mouths are going! If your child starts to cry, whine, or nag you, simply reset the timer. Say very little: Difficult kids may try to engage you in a fight, but don’t take the bait. * Don’t give in to protests about being in Timeout. The first few times you use this method, your child may become extremely upset. Expect it. But know you’re going to follow through! In unusual situations, a child may cry, fight, or whine for several hours. The child believes if he or she irritates you enough, then you’ll give in to the tantrum. Whatever you do, do your best to hang in there. Simply repeat: “Your time starts when you are quiet,” and nothing else. If you go for two hours the first time and hold firm, it’s likely the next time will be only an hour, then a half hour, then pretty soon the child will go to Timeout without a fuss. The first time you use Timeout, don’t do it when you’re in a hurry to go somewhere. Be sure to leave yourself enough time to be able to do it right. * If the child refuses to stay in Timeout, you have several choices. * (1) You can tell the child that he or she will get two spankings on the buttocks for leaving Timeout. (Make sure you’re in control of yourself before you use this method.) * (2) You can take away points or chips if you are on a token system. * (3) You can ground them from activities he or she enjoys. * In order for the child to get out of Timeout, he or she must promise to do the thing that was originally asked and apologize for not doing it the first time he or she was asked. If he or she refuses to do it, the child remains in Timeout until the request is carried out. It’s very important to give the child the message that you’re serious and that you mean what you say! If the child can’t do what was asked or he or she broke a rule such as “No hitting,” the child must promise not to do it again. The apology your child gives you must be sincere. It’s important that we teach our children the value of “conscience” and regret for doing things that are wrong. * If the child is bothered or teased by siblings while he or she is in Timeout, have the sibling take the child’s place in Timeout. This is a very effective technique to keep the others kids from further inflaming the situation.For teenagers, it is more effective and less humiliating to use “response cost”methods. When they break a rule or fail to comply with a request, the negativeresponse costs them something important to them, such as privileges, money,phone time, going out on the weekends, etc. Make sure the consequence fits thecrime. I’ve treated some teenagers who were grounded for the summer. By Julythey became depressed.Make discipline a time for teaching and reshaping behavior.FAMILY EFFECTIVENESS STRATEGIESFamilies often fall victim to undiagnosed or untreated ADD. Involving the wholefamily in treatment is often essential for a healthy outcome. Here are someimportant family treatment issues to consider.Screen Other Family Members for ADDADD usually has genetic underpinnings. When one member has ADD, it is likelythat another person may have it as well. Trying effectively to treat one familymember when others in the family have untreated ADD invites frustration andfailure. Screen every member of the immediate family. I have found that whenparents have untreated ADD, they have trouble following through on medicationschedules for their children or the parent training suggestions given as part oftherapy. When a sibling goes undiagnosed, he or she sabotages the process by hisor her own conflict-seeking behavior.Communication IssuesFamilies with one or more persons with ADD often have serious communicationissues. These families tend to misinterpret information, react prematurely, orhave emotional outbursts over real or imagined slights. It is essential to teachfamilies how to listen, clarify misunderstandings, and avoid mind reading.(Believe me, when it comes to mind reading, everyone’s illiterate.) It is alsoessential to teach families with one or more ADD members to communicate in aclear, unemotional manner. Emotionality decreases effectiveness incommunication.Calm the Drive Toward TurmoilAs I’ve mentioned many times now, ADD children, teenagers, and adults areexperts at getting others to yell at them. It is essential, therefore, to teachfamilies how to calm volatile situations. Teaching simple breathing techniquesto all family members can be valuable in calming disagreements. Also, the use offamily timeouts helps when a situation starts to escalate. In family timeouts,everyone in the family goes to a quiet part of the house for a designated periodof time (ten to fifteen minutes) whenever voices are raised or someone is losingcontrol. Of course, family timeouts need to be set up ahead of time if they aregoing to work in calming difficult situations.Get Rid of GuiltGuilt is an issue for many in an ADD family. Resentment, bad feelings, and angerare common in family members. However, parents, spouses, or siblings feel thatthey are not “supposed” to have bad feelings toward people they love. They endup burdened by feelings of guilt. These resentments are normal, given thedifficulties in the family. Explaining the biological nature of ADD to familymembers often helps them understand the turmoil and have more compassion towardthe person with ADD, while alleviating any guilt they may feel.Dealing with EmbarrassmentEmbarrassment is a common feeling among ADD family members. The outrageousbehavior and public displays of turmoil often lead family members to want tohide from the outside world. Siblings complain that their friends tease them atschool because of a brother’s or sister’s behavior; parents are frequentlysubjected to disapproving looks from store clerks or other parents who have“perfect” kids. Understanding ADD helps families deal with the embarrassment.Good Guy versus Bad GuyIn families with ADD, people often get a “good guy” versus “bad guy” label.Children with the disorder often find that their behavior causes them to beoutcasts or “black sheep.” Whenever there is trouble, parents, unconsciously,look to them first. This “good guy” versus “bad guy” perception also applies toparents. A parent who has ADD often gets labeled by the other parent asemotional, irrational, or troubled. By doing this, the ADD parent may bestripped of his or her authority, causing resentment and turmoil. Treating thedisorder in all family members who have it, along with teaching the family toshare power, is essential to treating this “good guy” versus “bad guy”phenomenon.Split FamiliesDivorce is more common in ADD families. This may be due to many factors, such asthe increased turmoil caused by ADD children or the interpersonal problems ofthe ADD adults. Thus, the issues of divorce, custody, and stepfamilies oftenneed to be addressed in treatment.Without question, I’ve seen a higher percentage of families with ADD childrenbreak up through divorce. This is due, in large part, to the turmoil caused bythese children. Parents often blame each other for the problems and begin topull apart. Who wants to work all day and then come home to a house filled withtension? Who wants to be in a battle zone all day and then have a spouse comehome who doesn’t want to hear about all of the problems of the day? After awhile, people get burned out and they may look elsewhere for some satisfactionin their lives. This dynamic may make them more vulnerable to becomingworkaholics or having extramarital affairs.Because of the higher divorce rate, child custody often becomes an issue. I havedone many child custody evaluations in my practice. I look for the parent who isbest suited to help the child have a good relationship with both parents, ratherthan a parent who vilifies the other one.Stepfamily issues are also very important for many of these families. Allmembers of the families need to be educated about ADD, its effects on families,and its treatment. Positive attitudes are especially important here. Consideringthe ADD person’s drive toward turmoil, the child or adult may unconsciously seekconflict, and stepfamilies are often more vulnerable to misunderstandings andtension.What to Do About DadUnfortunately, men are often the last people to admit that there are emotionalor family problems. They often delay treatment, for their children orthemselves, until there has been a negative effect on self-esteem orfunctioning. I have heard many a father tell me that there is nothing wrong withhis son, even though the child may have been expelled from school on numerousoccasions three years in a row. A typical comment I hear is “He is just like Iwas when I was young, and I turned out okay.”Why men are less likely to see emotional or family problems is the subject ofmany debates. Here are some possibilities: * many men have trouble verbalizing their feelings * many men have difficulty getting outside of themselves to see the needs of others * men tend to be more action oriented than women, and they want to solve the problems themselves * societal expectations teach men that they can handle problems on their own and that they are weak if they seek help * men aren’t allowed to cry or express any negative feelings, and they often do not learn to seek help or talk through their problems.Whatever the reason, men in ADD families need education about the disorder, andthey need to be part of the treatment process if it is to have the best chanceof being successful. To this end, it is important for wives, mothers, and thetherapist to engage the father in a positive way, encouraging him to see hisvaluable role in helping the whole family heal. ADD is a family problem andneeds the support of everyone to be successful.It is ineffective (and may turn into a disaster) to blame the man or set him upas the cause of all the problems. Approach him in a positive way and there islikely to be cooperation. Approach him in a negative way and there is likely tobe resistance. In general, men are more competitive than women are and they needencouragement, as opposed to badgering, to be helpful. In my experience, once aresistant father becomes part of the treatment, he often takes much moreresponsibility for healing in the family.Living with a Partner with ADDWhen one or both partners in a marriage (or other living situation) has ADD, itis important to understand the couple dynamics and the treatment process. Hereare important issues to consider: * Have empathy for the ADD person and try to see the world through his or her eyes of frustration and failure. * Go to at least some appointments with the doctor together. When I treat adults with ADD, I prefer to see both partners together, at least some of the time, to gather another perspective on the treatment progress. I’m often amazed at the different perspective I get from a person’s partner. * Both partners need clear education on ADD, its genetic roots, how it impacts couples, and its treatment. * After the initial diagnosis, take a step back from the chronic turmoil that may have been present in the relationship. Look at your relationship from a new perspective and, if need be, try to start over. * Set up regular times for talking and checking in. * Keep lists to avoid resentments for chores and tasks not done. * Assume the best about the other person. * Set clear goals for each area of your life together and review them on a regular basis. Evaluate whether your behavior is getting you what you want. When you know what you want, you are much more able to make it happen. * Set clear individual goals and share them with each other. Then look for ways to help the other person reach his or her own personal goals. * Avoid stereotyped roles of “caretaker” and “sick one.” * Talk out issues concerning sex, in a kind and caring manner. * Frequently check in with each other during social gatherings to determine the comfort level of each partner. * Get away alone together on a regular basis. This is especially important when there are ADD kids in the family. * Work together in parenting children. Children with ADD put a tremendous strain on relationships. This is magnified even further when one of the parents has ADD. See yourselves as partners, not adversaries. * Praise each other ten times more than you criticize! * Get rid of the smelly bucket of fish (hurts from the past) that you carry around. Many couples hold on to old hurts and use them to torture each other months to years later. These “smelly fish” are destructive and stink up a relationship. Clean them out of your life. * If the ADD person refuses to get help, even after repeated encouragement to do so, the partner must consider whether or not to stay in the relationship. Many people with ADD have such a wounded sense of themselves that they refuse to acknowledge any problems and refuse to accept any help or treatment. At this point, the spouse or lover should not protect or cover for the ADD person, since this only makes them more dependent and less likely to seek help. In fact, I have seen many occasions where the spouse’s leaving the relationship led the ADD person to seek treatment. “Codependency” is not just a term for spouses of alcoholics: It applies to those who protect and help adults with ADD, thus preventing them from having to grow up on their own."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22SCHOOL STRATEGIESFinding the best classroom and homework strategies are critical to schoolsuccess for people with ADD. Here are lists of the strategies I give mypatients:THE TEACHERThe teacher is a major determining factor on how well the child or teen will doin school. Choose carefully! Look for a teacher who: * understands ADD or is at least willing to learn about it * will keep in regular contact with you about your child’s progress * protects the child or teen’s self-esteem and will not put him down in front of other children or allow other children to make fun of him (Singling out a child sets him or her up to be to be teased by peers!) * has clear and consistent rules, so that the child or teen knows what to expect * cannot be manipulated easily and who is firm yet kind * will motivate and encourage * realizes the tremendous effort these children and teenagers need to put out in order to be average * has an exciting and stimulating presentation style, using multisensory teaching methods (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic) * gives directions slowly and clearly, and is willing to repeat them if necessary and check to see if the ADD child or teen is following them correctly * will make adaptations as necessary, such as decrease the size of an assignment, allow more time for tasks, allow for the use of calculators, etc. * will not undermine the treatment you have with your doctor (I’ve known some uninformed teachers who had the nerve to tell parents, “I’m really opposed to medication.”)I realize that it’s unlikely you’ll find a teacher who possesses all of thesetraits, but look for teachers who have an open mind and know or are willing tolearn about ADD. Having a helpful, positive teacher is often the differencebetween success and failure for your child.THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTHere are some tips I frequently give to parents and especially teachers to makethe environment, pacing, and total school experience more conducive to learning.Parents, I suggest you show this section of the book to your child’s teacher.Oftentimes the secret to a successful learning experience for an ADD child is awell-prepared teacher. * Keep the walls simple: Do not cover every wall with artwork, posters, and pictures. (Visually stimulating material may distract ADD students.) * Usually it is best to seat the ADD child up front, near the teacher, with his or her back to the rest of the students, away from the door; this decreases distractions. * Reduce or minimize distractions (both audio and visual): Do not place an ADD student near the air conditioner, heater, high traffic areas, doors or windows. * Make earphones available to allow children to decrease auditory distractions. * Allow for cooling off periods when the student (or teacher) becomes upset. * Use written, displayed rules in the classroom. * Surround ADD students with “good role models.” * Encourage cooperative and collaborative learning, and give the non-ADD students praise and reinforcement for helping out. * Help the ADD student feel comfortable seeking help. Many of these students won’t ask questions for fear of appearing stupid to their peers, and they need to be “brought out” and encouraged. * Most fights and “acting out” behavior at school occur in the cafeteria because of the noise and confusion. Providing a quiet place for lunch may decrease the number of lunchtime problems for these children. * ADD children often come in from recess or lunch “wound up.” Have the entire class walk around the room, then pretend to be palm trees swaying in the breeze. “How slowly can you sway?” is a calming-down exercise that will help start the late-morning or-afternoon session off right. * If lines are a problem for the child, place him or her at the end of the line, where people will not be brushing up against his or her body: Many of these kids are sensitive to touch.Pacing * Adjust time for completion of projects. * Allow frequent breaks and vary activities often. * Omit assignments requiring copying in a timed situation. * Give only one assignment at a time.Increasing Attentiveness * Pause after a question and look at different students before calling on anyone to answer. * Alert students that you are going to ask a question (e.g., “I am going to call on someone soon—I don’t know who yet.”). * Encourage students to look at the student who is answering. * Create a level of uncertainty that requires more than passive receptivity (e.g., “What do you think will happen next?”). * If a teacher sees a student’s attention wandering, call his name and ask a simple question he can answer. * Use “attention recording sheets” for self-monitoring: The student marks a plus each time he realizes he has been paying attention and a minus each time he realizes his mind has wandered. * Have students record time taken to complete tasks (e.g., note starting time at the top of the page and ending time at the bottom; actual time is not important, but the process of self-monitoring is crucial). A watch with a stopwatch and an alarm can help. * Have students grade their own papers and tests. This instills a habit of reviewing their own work. * Use nonverbal or secret cues to keep the child on track.Presentation of Subject Matter * Emphasize the teaching approach according to learning style of student (audio/visual/tactile/multisensory). * Increase class participation in lectures. * Make the material highly interactive, interesting, novel, and stimulating. * Foster individual or small group discussions. * Provide taped lectures for replay. * Use demonstrations to illustrate points. * Utilize “hands-on” activities. * Emphasize critical information: teach “The Big Picture.” * Preview new concepts and vocabulary at the beginning of the lesson and highlight them again at the end of the lesson to reinforce learning. * Use advanced organizers. * Provide visual clues. * Maintain good eye contact. * Present more difficult lessons early in the day: Children and teens with ADD become fatigued more easily than others; also, their medication often wears off in the late morning (if they are taking the regular form of Ritalin or Dexedrine). * Make auxiliary materials/services available, such as: 1. taped texts 2. highlighted texts/study guides 3. supplementary materials as needed 4. note-taking assistance; copies of notes from excellent students 5. typed notes from the teacher 6. calculators or word processors 7. adapted or simplified texts 8. graph paper for math problems, handwriting, etc.Assignments * Give directions in small, distinct steps. * Allow copying from paper or book. * Use written backup for oral instructions. * Lower reading level of assignment if necessary. * Adjust length of assignment. * Change format of assignments to best fit needs of child. * Give assignments in chunks, or a series of smaller assignments; this is especially helpful for longer projects. * Reduce pencil and paper tasks. * Read directions/worksheets to students. * Give oral/visual clues or prompting. * Allow assignments to be typed or dictated. * Adapt worksheets/packets. * Maintain an assignment notebook. * Avoid penalizing for spelling errors. (Andrew Jackson said it is the dull man who can only spell words one way.) * Encourage the use of dictation or word processing for those with writing difficulties. You may have people with visual processing problems read their material into a tape recorder and then listen to the material over and over.Reinforcement and Follow-Through * Use reward systems for positive behavior. * Use concrete rewards. * Check often for understanding and review. * Request parental reinforcement if it is a positive experience for the student and parent. * Have the student repeat the instructions. * Make/use vocabulary files. * Teach study skills. * Teach organizational skills, and supervise their implementation on a regular basis. * Use study sheets to organize material. * Reinforce long-term assignment timeliness (cut into short chunks). * Use behavioral contracts/daily or weekly report cards. * Arrange for tutoring. * Have regular conferences with student and parents, emphasizing the positive as well as giving feedback on the negative.Testing Adaptations * Give some tests orally (some students need most tests orally due to other learning disabilities). * Have someone read the test to the student if there are reading problems. * Reduce the reading level of the test if necessary. * Adjust the time for test completion. * Short-answer/multiple-choice questions are best for many ADD students. * Shorten the length of the test. * Test for knowledge, not attention span.Grading * Modify weights of examinations. * Give extra credit for projects. * Give credit for appropriate class participation. * Increase or eliminate time limits. * Shorten the lengths of exams.Encourage Questions * Take time to encourage the child or teen to ask questions when he or she feels confused or lost. * Establish a positive feeling about asking questions. Most students do not ask questions for fear of appearing stupid. If they can overcome this barrier, it will serve them well for the rest of their academic careers. * Praise the child for asking appropriate questions.Discipline * “Firm and kind” are the words to remember. * When you say something, mean it; be willing to back it up, but in a kind, caring tone. * Be very careful not to discipline a child when his misbehavior is the result of confusion or misunderstanding instructions. * Use discipline for teaching, not punishment. * Never discipline a child when you feel you’re out of control. * Show disapproval of the behavior, not the child. * Stay calm and unemotional. (Remember, ADD children are often trying to get a rise out of you!) * Have well-thought-out consequences to certain behaviors ahead of time. (Anticipation is the key to success.) * Focus 90 percent of your efforts with the child on noticing behavior you like, to set a positive tone. * Have frequent contact with the parents. (They need to be allied with you if discipline is going to be effective.)Finger Agnosia“Finger agnosia” is a term for students who struggle with the mechanics ofwriting. When they try to write, their minds go blank. This is common in peoplewith ADD and occurs in part because the person has to concentrate so hard on theactual physical act of writing that they forget or are unable to formulate whatthey want to write.Common symptoms of finger agnosia include: * messy handwriting * trouble getting thoughts from the brain to the paper * staring at writing assignments for long periods of time * writing sentences that don’t make sense * frequent spelling and grammatical errors * many erasures and corrections * difficulty with timed writing assignments * printing rather than writing in cursive.Here are some helpful suggestions for dealing with finger agnosia: * Allow the student to print as often as possible. (For many students it’s easier and requires less effort.) * Encourage early use of typing and word processing programs. (Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is an excellent computer typing program for children and teens.) * Try out different types of pens and pencils to see which ones work best. Some are easier to use than others. * Break down assignments and long reports into pieces, and work on them over time, rather than all at once (such as on the night before they are due). * Before an actual writing project is done, encourage students to write an outline of the assignment to help keep them on track. * Encourage students to write down their ideas before worrying about spelling/grammar. * If it helps, have students dictate their answers or reports first. This often helps them add ideas and substance to the article that would not have been present through writing alone. * Use a binder/organizer to keep written assignments together. * Modify writing workloads at work and school as needed. * Avoid timed situations; give tests orally if necessary. * Avoid having other students grade the work, as this may set up embarrassment and teasing.HomeworkHere are suggestions for taking the nightmare out of homework: * Provide a “special” quiet spot without distractions in which to do homework. * Break assignments into short segments of about fifteen to twenty minutes; set a timer to structure work periods. * Intersperse physical activity between segments. * Check assignment sheets and notebooks on a regular basis. * Continually work on good communication between home and school. * Reward positive homework behavior. * If problems continue, use a daily report system to ensure compliance.Useless and/or Harmful Strategies * Tell the child or teen to try harder. (The harder they try, the worse it gets.) * Lecture the student about showing his “true” ability. * Notice only the negative. * Compare the student to other students.DAILY PROGRESS NOTE (DPN)Supervision is the key to helping students with ADD or other students who arehaving difficulty adapting to the rigors of school. They often have notdeveloped the internal discipline to be successful day-to-day at school and withtheir homework. I use this system for both children and teenagers. Even thoughteenagers may balk at this system, many teens in my practice have used itsuccessfully. I’m convinced that many students have graduated from high schoolbecause we kept them on track with this system! ADD students tend to do muchbetter if they know someone is watching.DirectionsEvery school day the child or teen is to bring the Daily Progress Note to schoolfor the teacher or teachers to fill out (at the end of the day if there is onlyone teacher, at the end of each class for those who have multiple teachers). Theteacher (or teachers) rates the student on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = best, 5 =worst) in four different areas: homework, class participation, classwork, andpeer interactions. After rating the child in each area, the teacher then putshis or her initials at the bottom of the form. (It is important to emphasize tothe teacher the importance of giving an accurate assessment. Some teachers giveout “good” marks just to be nice and then put the real grades down on the reportcard, shocking the student and parents.)At the end of the day, the child or teen brings the DPN home. This note providesthe student, parents, and teacher with immediate feedback on performance andhelps everyone track progress throughout the year. Good performance is noticedand reinforced. Mediocre or poor performance is observed and necessarycorrective measures can be put into place. When the child or teen brings the DPNhome, it is helpful if parents first look for something they like. (Too manyparents only notice the negative.) If the child or teen’s marks are particularlypoor, the parents need to question the reasons behind the difficulties of theday.After the discussion, the parent assigns points for the day. Here is a samplepoint system: 1 = 5 points2 = 2 points3 = 1 point4 and 5 = 0 pointsIn the system listed above (for students with one teacher a day), there is atotal of 20 possible points that the child can earn (a score of 1 [5 points]multiplied by 4 areas = 20 points).The points are then spent in two different ways: one, on daily wants and needs,the other for future privileges. Earning points for daily wants and needs issignificant, as these reinforce and discipline behavior on a more immediatebasis. To do this, the parent and child make up a list of the things he or shelikes to do on a daily basis, such as watching television, playing outside,having a friend over, playing a video game, talking on the telephone, etc. Halfof the possible points (10 in the example above) should be spent on dailyprivileges. This lets the child know that he or she can’t just blow a day atschool and expect everything to be okay at home. For example, points needed fordaily wants may be as follows: 2 = ½ hour of television2 = 1 hour of playing outside3 = having a friend over for an hour2 = playing a video game3 = ½ hour of telephone privilege. The other half of their points can be saved for special treats and privileges asthe child earns enough points (such as a special toy, a trip to his or herfavorite restaurant, having a friend spend the night, or being able to stay uppast his or her bedtime). It is important to make up a wish list of the thingsthe child or teen is willing to work for. The child or teen needs to developthis list in order to more fully buy into this program.In some cases, children will intentionally lose their DPN or forget to havetheir teacher sign it if their performance that day was poor. In the case wherethe child claims to have lost the DPN or says that the teacher didn’t fill itout, the child loses all of his or her points for the day (or a portion of thepoints if multiple teachers are involved). The child or teen must takeresponsibility! On a day when the child earns little or no points for variousprivileges, he or she is to be encouraged to do better the next day. In lieu ofnormal privileges, encourage the child to read books or play in his or her room.Almost all children find this system to be very rewarding after they have usedit for several days. Some children refuse to participate initially, but if theparents persist, the child will adapt. One of the advantages of this system isthat some children become “miserly” with their points and will often give upwatching television and playing video games to save points for other things theyare interested in. In addition, many begin to develop a more positive attitudetoward school because of their ability to earn extra privileges for performingwell in school.Some parents have asked me if the DPN does not single out the child for teasingfrom peers. I have rarely found this to be the case. In fact, this helps ADDchildren to modify their behavior in school, which in turns helps theirinteractions with peers.Daily Progress NoteName: __________________________ Date: ______________ Please rate this child/teen in each of the areas listed below according to howhe/she performed in school today, using ratings of 1 to 5. (1 = excellent; 2 =good; 3 = fair; 4 = poor; 5 = terrible or did not do the work.)image [Images/page334.jpg]GET SCHOOL RESOURCES INVOLVED EARLYUnder federal law (PL 94-142), all students are entitled to an educationalsetting in which they can learn. If they are handicapped, the school system mustmake proper modifications so that they can receive an education. As you haveseen, ADD often handicaps a child or teen from taking advantage of education.Due to a lack of funding and personnel, however, many schools overlook childrenwith ADD and learning problems unless they are forced to take action. Parentsneed to be the prime force that gets the child appropriate help.Parents need to advocate for their children and not just rely on the overworkedprincipal, counselor, or school psychologist. To that end, parents must beeducated on ADD and know the proper school interventions. I often tell myparents that they are the ones who need to intervene when things are not goingwell at school. The squeaky wheel gets the grease! Don’t give in to a schooladministrator who tries to intimidate or condescend to you!If you are not “the assertive type,” consider obtaining a school advocate foryour child. A school advocate is someone who has experience in dealing with theschool system to ensure the child gets all the help he or she needs. To get thename of an advocate in your area, contact the local chapter of CHADD (a nationalsupport group for parents of children with ADD, with local chapters) or theDisability Rights Education and Defense Fund in Berkeley, California, at (510)644-2555.Most school systems are willing to test preschool children if there is asuspected learning or speech problem. Contact your local school counselor orprincipal for more information on special testing. The earlier you addressproblems, the more hope there is for successful interventions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23SLEEP STRATEGIES FOR GETTING UP AND GOING TO BEDG etting up in the morning and going to sleep at night are frequentlysignificant problems for people with ADD. Sleep-cycle problems can interferewith relationships, work, school, and overall energy level. Chronic sleepdeprivation makes ADD worse.GETTING UPMornings are difficult for many people with ADD. Here are some common statementspeople with ADD say as they’re trying to get out of bed: “Later…”“Just a few more minutes.”“I’ll get up in a little bit.”“Leave me alone.”“My alarm is set” (even though it already went off).“I’m too tired to get up.”“OK, I’m up” (only to lay back down for several hours).Many people with ADD feel very groggy or fuzzy-headed in the morning. The harderthey try to get out of bed, the worse it gets. One teenager I know had such ahard time getting out of bed that she almost got fired from her summer job. Herboss told her if she was late one more time, she was gone. She had three alarmclocks and she had two of her friends call her in the morning. Many high schoolstudents are frequently late for school because of the trouble getting up.Adults with ADD also have this problem. Have you ever heard of adults who saythat they have to have a couple of cups of coffee in the morning to get going?Coffee contains the stimulant caffeine. (Stimulants are a common treatment forADD.)Parents complain that they have to wake up ADD children and teenagers three,four, five, six, even ten times before they get out of bed. This can cause a lotof family turmoil in the morning. When parents have to tell a child over andover to get out of bed, they can get pretty irritable. They may start yelling,threatening, or using force to get the child moving. Some parents we know usewater or ice to help the child or teen get up. The morning grogginess causesmany people with ADD to be chronically late, which stresses out everyone in themorning, especially if the parent has to get to work or has other children toget to school.The child or teen who wakes up to parental hostility starts the day off in a badmood. It’s hard to concentrate in class when you have just been yelled at,threatened, or grounded because you couldn’t get out of bed on time. This leadsto other problems. For example, if you can’t get up on time, you may miss thebus, get a speeding ticket, end up in the tardy tank, or just cut class so thatyou’re not late again. Starting the day off on the wrong foot can affect yourmood and attitude for the whole day.Many ADD people say that when they get up on their own, they tend to do betterthan if someone is screaming at them to get out of bed. It often becomes abattle of wills. Both people end up feeling terrible.Without parents hassling kids, some children and teenagers won’t get out of beduntil noon, 1, 2 or even 3 P.M. This can cause serious problems. When kids getup late, they will have trouble going to sleep at night. Getting up late causesa large part of the day to go by without participating in it. Many parentscomplain that their kids are wasting the day.HELPFUL HINTS FOR GETTING GOING IN THE A.M. 1. Go to bed at a reasonable time. (See bedtime suggestions below.) 2. Set the alarm clock to play the kind of music that gets the person going. (Some people like fast rock music to wake them up, others like rap, some like country music.) 3. Keep the alarm clock (or clocks) across the room so that the person has to get out of bed to turn it off. Don’t have the kind of alarm that turns itself off after thirty seconds. Have one that keeps going, and going, and going. 4. Take your medicine a half hour before you’re supposed to get out of bed. Keep it by the bed with a glass of water. Set two alarms: One to take your medicine and one to get up. 5. Have something for the ADD person to do that motivates him or her in the morning. Sometimes having a girlfriend or boyfriend call you can be great motivation. Some people enjoy working out with weights in the morning as a way to get their bodies (and brains) feeling alive. 6. Stay away from early classes and early-morning jobs if possible. In college, many of my patients don’t start class until after 10:00 A.M. Being late irritates teachers and bosses, which is the last thing someone wants to do if he or she wants to do well in school or in a job! 7. Watch the body’s own cycle. Some people are good in the morning and some later on. Fit your schedule to your body’s rhythms.GOING TO BEDMany people with ADD have sleep problems. Some “go and go” all day until theydrop from exhaustion. Others have difficulty getting to sleep, or they wake upfrequently throughout the night. Some are even hyper in their sleep andconstantly on the move. Getting a restful night’s sleep helps you feel calmer inthe morning. After a poor night’s sleep, the ADD person has even more troubleawakening. Here are some of the things people with ADD have said about theirsleep problems: “I have to count sheep to get to sleep, but the stupid sheep are always talkingto me.”“When I try to get to sleep, all kinds of different thoughts come into my mind.It feels like my mind spins when I try to calm it down.”“I feel so restless at night. It’s hard to settle down, even though I’m tired.”“The worries from the day go over and over in my head. I just can’t shut mybrain down.”“I have to sleep with a fan to drown out my thoughts. I need noise to calmdown.” Sleep disturbances can cause many other problems, in addition to the obviousproblems of difficulty waking up and morning grogginess. If it is hard to settledown at night, it may make parents mad, because they know too well about themorning problems. Not getting enough sleep continues the cycle of feeling tiredand wanting to sleep during the day.One teenager I know had such trouble sleeping that he could never go to bedbefore three o’clock in the morning. This caused terrible problems: He couldn’tget up in the morning and had to drop out of school. He even went to theStanford University Sleep Center for help with his problem. In the end,medication was needed to help his sleep cycle.Doctors aren’t sure why people with ADD have more sleep problems. Some doctorsthink it has to do with serotonin, the neurotransmitter most closely tied totypes 3 and 6 ADD. However, we all depend on serotonin to fall asleep, and whenthere is not enough of it, getting to sleep can be an awful chore.THIRTEEN WAYS TO GET TO SLEEPHere are thirteen ways to make it easier to go to sleep. No one suggestion willwork for everyone, but keep trying new tactics until you find what works foryour situation: 1. Don’t watch television one to two hours before bedtime, especially any program that may be overstimulating (i.e., the shows you most like). This includes news programs, as people with ADD tend to ruminate on the bad things that happened that day in their own world and the world at large. 2. Stimulating, active play such as wrestling, tickling, teasing, etc., should be eliminated for one to two hours before bedtime. Quiet activities such as reading, drawing, or writing are more helpful in the hours before bedtime. 3. Some people try to read themselves to sleep. This can be helpful. But read boring books. If you read action-packed thrillers or horror stories, it’s not likely that you’ll smoothly drift off into peaceful never-never land. 4. Try a warm, quiet bath. 5. A bedtime back rub in bed may be soothing. Starting from the neck and working down in slow, rhythmic strokes can be very relaxing. Some children and teens say that a foot massage is particularly helpful (although it may be hard to find someone to give a teen a foot massage if they haven’t showered or taken a bath before bed). 6. Soft, slow music often helps people drift off to sleep. Instrumental music, as opposed to vocal, seems to be the most helpful. Some people with ADD say that they need fast music in order to block out their thoughts. Use what works. 7. Nature-sounds tapes (rain, thunder, ocean, rivers) can be very helpful. Others like the sound of fans. 8. Some people with ADD say that restrictive bedding is helpful, such as a sleeping bag or being wrapped tightly in blankets. 9. A mixture of warm milk, a teaspoon of vanilla (not imitation vanilla, the real stuff), and a teaspoon of sugar can be very helpful. This increases serotonin in your brain and helps you sleep. 10. I make a sleep tape in my office with a special sound machine that produces sound waves at the same frequency as a sleeping brain. The tape is played at bedtime and helps the brain “tune in” to a brainwave sleep state, encouraging a peaceful sleep. The tape is called “Brain Train” and can be obtained at www.mindworkspress.com. 11. Learn self-hypnosis. Self-hypnosis can be a powerful tool for many different reasons, including sleep. Here’s a quick self-hypnosis course: * Focus your eyes on a spot and count slowly to twenty…. Let your eyes feel heavy as you count, and close them as you get to twenty. * Take three or four very slow, deep breaths. * Tighten the muscles in your arms and legs and then let them relax. * Imagine yourself walking down a staircase while you count backward from ten. (This will give you the feeling of “going down” or becoming sleepy.) * With all of your senses (sight, touch, hearing, taste, smell), imagine a very sleepy scene, such as by a fire in a mountain cabin or in a sleeping bag at the beach. 12. Seek sleep control therapy. Here are the tips many sleep experts give to chronic insomniacs to help them get to sleep on a regular basis: * Go to bed only when sleepy. * Use the bed and bedroom only for sleep. * Get out of bed and go into another room when you are unable to fall asleep or return to sleep easily, and return to bed only when sleepy. * Maintain a regular rise time in the morning regardless of sleep duration the previous night. * Avoid daytime naps. 13. Sometimes medications are needed if getting to sleep is a chronic problem. There are pros and cons to using medications as sleep aids. On the positive side, medications tend to work quickly and can help normalize a disturbed sleep pattern. On the negative side, medications can have side effects (such as grogginess in the morning), and you can become dependent on them if you take them for too long. It is best to think of medications for sleeping problems as a short-term solution. Use the other ideas first.The different medications doctors prescribe to help promote sleep include: * Over-the-counter medications: Benadryl, Unisom, Sominex, Exedrin PM, Nyquil, etc. * Some antidepressants: imipramine (Tofranil), amitriptyline (Elavil), or trazodone (Desyrel). (Trazodone is used only in females; in men it may cause painful erections that won’t go away.) Often these are used in very low doses to help promote sleep. They are helpful in people who have a tendency toward depression. * Certain blood pressure medications: clonidine (Catapres), for example. Clonidine is often used to calm down the restlessness or hyperactivity that often goes along with ADD. * Sleeping medications: temazepam (Restoril), triazolam (Halcion), zolpidem (Ambien), flurazepam (Dalmane), estazolam (ProSom). These medications tend to lose their effectiveness after a few weeks. They should be used on a short-term basis only.Getting up and going to sleep can hinder the success of a person with ADD. Usethe techniques in this chapter to help. Be persistent. If one technique doesn’twork for you, don’t give up: Try others."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24KILLING ADD ANTSThinking Skills for Overcoming Past Trauma, Fear, and FailureChildren, teens, and adults with ADD often develop erroneous thought patterns,based on the failures they have experienced in their lives. It often helps toinvestigate the way an ADD person thinks and then teach him or her to correctany erroneous thought patterns.Here are some examples of common negative thoughts:“I’m a terrible student.”“I’m always messing things up.”“No one ever wants to be with me.”“Anybody could have done that. I’m not so special.”“The teacher (or boss) doesn’t like me.”“I will fail at this.”“I feel you don’t love me.”“I should do better.”“I’m so stupid.”These thoughts severely limit a person’s ability to enjoy his or her life. Howpeople think “moment by moment” has a huge impact on how they feel and how theybehave. Negative thoughts often drive difficult behaviors and cause people tohave problems with their self-esteem. Hopeful thoughts, on the other hand,influence positive behaviors and lead people to feel good about themselves andbe more effective in their day-to-day lives.Most ADD children, teens and adults have lots of negative thoughts. Thesethoughts come from many sources. Some of the negative thoughts come from whatother people have told them about themselves (i.e., “You’re no good! Why can’tyou ever listen? What’s the matter with you? You make me crazy!”). Othernegative thoughts originate from experiences where the person is continuallyfrustrated, either at home, school, or work. They begin to think thoughts suchas, “I’m stupid. I can’t ever do anything right. It will never work out for me.”In many ways our brain works like a computer. When a person receives negativeINPUT about themselves, they STORE it in their subconscious mind, and the inputbecomes EXPRESSED as negative thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. Unless peopleare taught how to talk back to these harmful thoughts and messages, they believethem unconditionally. This is a critical point. Most people never challenge thethoughts that go through their heads. They never even think about their ownthoughts. They just believe what they think, even though the thoughts may bevery irrational. Their behavior is therefore based on false assumptions or falseideas.Unfortunately, many ADD children carry these negative thought patterns intoadulthood, causing them to have problems with their moods and behavior. Thesenegative thoughts affect their moods and in many children become the seeds ofanxiety or depression later on in life. It’s critical to teach people abouttheir thoughts and to teach them to challenge what they think, rather than justaccept blindly the thoughts that go through their heads. But when you’re achild, no one teaches you to think much about your thoughts or to challenge thenotions that go through your head, even though your thoughts are always withyou. Why do we spend so much time teaching kids about diagramming sentences andso little time teaching them how to think clearly? Most people do not understandhow important thoughts are and leave the development of thought patterns torandom chance. Did you know that thoughts have actual weight and mass? They arereal! They have significant influence on every cell in your body (more detail onthis in a little bit). When a person’s mind is burdened with many negativethoughts, it affects that person’s ability to learn, his or her ability torelate to other people, and his or her physical health. Teaching people with ADDhow to control and direct their thoughts in a positive way can be helpful in allareas of their lives.Here are the step-by-step “positive thinking” principles that I use in mypsychotherapy practice with children, teens, and adults. When people truly learnthese principles, they gain more control over their feelings and their behavior.Did you know…?: Step #1: Every time you have a thought, your brain releases chemicals. That’show our brain works: * You have a thought * your brain releases chemicals * an electrical transmission goes across your brain, and * you become aware of what you’re thinking.Thoughts are real and they have a real impact on how you feel and how youbehave. Step #2: Every time you have a mad thought, an unkind thought, a sad thought, ora cranky thought, your brain releases negative chemicals that make your bodyfeel bad. Whenever you’re upset, imagine that your brain releases bubbles withsad or angry faces, looking to cause problems. Think about the last time youwere mad. What did you feel inside your body? When most people are mad, theirmuscles get tense, their hearts beat faster, their hands start to sweat, andthey may even begin to feel a little dizzy. Your body reacts to every negativethought you have. Step #3: Every time you have a good thought, a happy thought, a hopeful thought,or a kind thought, your brain releases chemicals that make your body feel good.Whenever you’re happy, imagine that your brain releases bubbles with glad orsmiling faces, making you feel good. Think about the last time you had a reallyhappy thought (such as when you got a good grade on a test or cuddled a child).What did you feel inside your body? When most people are happy, their musclesrelax, their hearts beat slower, their hands become dry, and they breatheslower. Your body also reacts to your good thoughts. Step #4: Your body reacts to every thought you have! We know this frompolygraphs, or lie detector tests. During a lie detector test, you are hooked upto equipment that measures: * hand temperature * heart rate * blood pressure * breathing rate * muscle tension, and * how much the hands sweat.The tester then asks questions, such as, “Did you do that thing?” If you did thebad thing, your body is likely to have a “stress” response and it is likely toreact in the following ways: * Your hands will get colder * your heart will go faster * your blood pressure will go up * your breathing gets faster * your muscles will get tight, and * your hands will sweat more.Almost immediately, the body reacts to what you think, whether you say anythingor not.Now the opposite is also true. If you did not do what they are asking you about,it is likely that your body will experience a “relaxation” response and willreact in the following ways: * Your hands will become warmer * your heart rate will slow * your blood pressure will go down * your breathing will become slower and deeper * your muscles will become more relaxed, and * your hands will become drier.Again, almost immediately, your body reacts to what you think. This not onlyhappens when you’re asked about telling the truth, your body reacts to everythought you have, whether it is about school, friends, family, or anything else. Step #5: Thoughts are very powerful! They can make your mind and your body feelgood and they can make you feel bad! Every cell in your body is affected byevery thought you have. When people get emotionally upset, they develop physicalsymptoms, such as headaches or stomachaches. If you can think about good things,you will feel better. It worked for Abraham Lincoln. He had periods of seriousdepression when he was a child and adult. Some days he didn’t even get out ofbed. In his later life, however, he learned to treat his bad feelings withlaughter. He learned that when he laughed, he felt better. STEP #6: Unless you think about your thoughts, they are “automatic” or “theyjust happen.” Since they just happen, they are not always correct. Your thoughtsdo not always tell you the truth. Sometimes they even lie to you. I once knew aboy who thought he was stupid because he didn’t do well on tests. When we testedhis IQ (intelligence level), however, we discovered that he was close to agenius! You don’t have to believe every thought that goes through your head.It’s important to think about your thoughts to see if they help you or they hurtyou. Unfortunately, if you never challenge your thoughts, you just believe themas if they were true. Step #7: You can train your thoughts to be positive and hopeful or you can justallow them to be negative and upset you. Once you learn about your thoughts, youcan choose to think good thoughts and feel good, or you can choose to think badthoughts and feel lousy. It’s up to you. You can learn how to change yourthoughts, and you can learn to change the way you feel.One way to learn how to change your thoughts is to notice them when they arenegative and talk back to them. If you can correct negative thoughts, you takeaway their power over you. When you just think a negative thought withoutchallenging it, your mind believes it and your body reacts to it. Step #8: As I mentioned above, negative thoughts are mostly automatic: They“just happen.” I call these thoughts Automatic Negative Thoughts. If you takethe first letter from each of these words, it spells the word “ANT.” Think ofthese negative thoughts that invade your mind like ants that bother people at apicnic. One negative thought, like one ant at a picnic, is not a big problem.Two or three negative thoughts, like two or three ants at a picnic, and it’smore irritating. Ten or twenty negative thoughts, like ten or twenty ants at apicnic, can cause real problems.Whenever you notice these automatic negative thoughts (ANTs), you need to crushthem, or they’ll begin to ruin your whole day. One way to crush these ANTs is towrite down the negative thought and talk back to it. For example, if you think,Other kids will laugh at me when I give my speech, write it down and then writedown a positive response—something like The other kids will like my speech andfind it interesting. When you write down negative thoughts and talk back tothem, you take away their power and help yourself feel better.Some kids tell me they have trouble talking back to these negative thoughtsbecause they feel that they are lying to themselves. Initially they believe thatthe thoughts that go through their mind are the truth. Remember, thoughtssometimes lie to you: It’s important to check them out before you just believethem!Here are nine different ways that our thoughts lie to us to make situations outto be worse than they really are. Think of these nine ways as different speciesor types of ANTs (automatic negative thoughts). When you can identify the typeof ANT, you begin to take away the power it has over you. I have labeled some ofthese ANTs as red, because these ANTs are particularly harmful to you. Noticeand exterminate ANTs whenever possible. ANT #1: “All or nothing” thinking. These thoughts happen when you make somethingout to be all good or all bad. There’s nothing in between. You see everything inblack or white terms. For children, the thought that “There’s nothing to do” isan example of this. When children say, “There’s nothing to do,” they feel downand upset, bored, and unmotivated to change the situation. But is There’snothing to do a rational thought? Of course not: It’s just a thought. Even on aday when it’s raining outside and children have to stay in, they can probablylist twenty things to do if they put their minds to it. But if they neverchallenge the thought There’s nothing to do, they just believe it and spend therest of the day feeling crummy. Other examples of “all or nothing” thinkinginclude thoughts such as I’m the worst ballplayer in the city and If I get an Aon this test, I’m a great student, but if I do poorly, then I’m no good at all. ANT #2: “Always” thinking. This happens when you think something that happenedwill “always” repeat itself. For example, if your wife is irritable and she getsupset, you may think to yourself, She’s always yelling at me, even though sheyells only once in a while. But just the thought She’s always yelling at me isso negative that it makes you feel sad and upset. Whenever you think in wordslike “always,” “never,” “no one,” “everyone,” “every time,” and “everything,”those are examples of “always” thinking. There are many examples of “always”thinking: No one ever plays with me. Everyone is always picking on me. You neverlisten to me. You always give her what she wants. This type of ANT is verycommon. Watch out for it. ANT #3 (red ANT): Focusing on the negative. This occurs when your thoughts onlysee the bad in a situation and ignore any of the good that might happen. Forexample, if you have to move and you’re sad to leave your friends, you don’tthink of the new places you’ll see and the new friends you’ll make. It’simportant, if you want to keep your mind healthy, to focus on the good parts ofyour life a lot more than the bad parts. I once helped a child who wasdepressed. In the beginning he could only think about the bad things thathappened to him. He had recently moved and told me that he would never make newfriends (even though he already had several). He thought he would do poorly inhis new school (even though he got mostly good grades), and that he would neverhave any fun (even though he lived near a bay and an amusement park). Byfocusing on the negative in his new situation, he was making it very hard onhimself to adjust to his new home. He would have been much better off if helooked at all the positives in the situation rather than the negatives. ANT #4 (red ANT): Fortune-telling. This is where you predict the worst possibleoutcome to a situation. For example, before you have to give a speech in frontof a class or work meeting, you may say to yourself, Other people will laugh atme or think I’m stupid. Just having this thought will make you feel nervous andupset. This is a red ANT because it can do real damage to your chances offeeling good.I once treated a 10-year-old boy named Kevin who stuttered in class whenever heread out loud. In private he was a wonderful reader, but whenever he started toread in class he thought to himself, I’m a lousy reader; the other kids willlaugh at me. Because he had these thoughts, he stopped raising his hand tovolunteer to read. In fact, this thought made him so upset that he startedgetting sick before school and stayed home nearly a month before his motherbrought him to see me. He also stopped answering the telephone at home for fearthat he would stutter whenever he said hello. When he told me about his thoughtsin class and at home, I understood the problem. When you predict that bad thingswill happen, your mind then often makes them happen: the classic self-fulfillingprophecy. The treatment for Kevin was to get him to replace the negativethoughts and pictures in his head with the image of him being a wonderful readerin class. Learning breathing techniques (we’ll cover this later) and being thedesignated person to answer the telephone at home also helped his confidence.Whenever you’re afraid of unreasonable things, such as answering the telephoneor reading in class, it is important to face your fears. Otherwise, fearsdevelop power over you. Over the next couple of weeks he was able to go back toschool, and he even volunteered to read. At home his mother told me that he ranto answer the telephone whenever it rang. If you are going to predict anythingat all, it is best to predict the best. It will help you feel good and it willhelp your mind make it happen. ANT #5 (red ANT): Mind reading. This happens when you believe that you know whatanother person is thinking when they haven’t even told you. Many people do mindreading, and more often than not it gets them into trouble. It is the majorreason why people have trouble in relationships. I tell people, “Please don’tread my mind: I have enough trouble reading it myself!” Mind reading isn’t justthinking about the same thing as someone else. The dangerous sort of mindreading I’m talking about is when you have thoughts such as Those people are madat me. They don’t like me. They were talking about me. ANT #6: Thinking with your feelings. This occurs when you believe your negativefeelings without ever questioning them. Feelings are complex, and, as Imentioned above, sometimes they lie to you. But many people believe theirfeelings even though they have no evidence for them. “Thinking with yourfeelings” thoughts usually start with the words “I feel…” For example, “I feellike you don’t love me,” “I feel stupid,” “I feel like a failure,” “I feelnobody will ever trust me.” Whenever you have a strong negative feeling, checkit out. Look for the evidence behind the feeling. Do you have real reasons tofeel that way? Or are your feelings based on events or things from the past? ANT #7: Guilt beatings. Guilt is not a helpful emotion. In fact, guilt oftencauses you to do those things that you don’t want to do. Guilt beatings happenwhen you think with words like “should,” “must,” “ought to,” or “have to.” Hereare some examples: I should be nice to my younger brother. I must never lie. Iought to call my grandmother. I have to do my homework. Because of human nature,whenever we think that we “must” do something, no matter what it is, we don’twant to do it. Remember the story of Adam and Eve: The only restriction that Godput on them when he gave them theGarden of Eden was that they shouldn’t eat from the Tree of Knowledge. Almostimmediately after God told them what they “shouldn’t” do, they started to wonderwhy they shouldn’t do it. Well, you know the rest of the story. It is better toreplace “guilt beatings” with phrases like I want to do this…. It fits my goalsto do that…. It would be helpful to do this…. So in our examples above, it wouldbe helpful to change those phrases to I want be nice to my younger brother. It’shelpful for me not to lie, because people will trust me. I want to call mygrandmother. It’s in my best interest to do my homework. ANT #8: Labeling. Whenever you attach a negative label to yourself or to someoneelse, you sabotage your ability to take a clear look at the situation. Someexamples of negative labels are “nerd,” “jerk,” “idiot,” “spoiled brat,” and“clown.” Negative labels are very harmful. Whenever you call yourself or someoneelse a spoiled brat or an idiot, you lump that person in your mind with all ofthe “spoiled brats” or “idiots” that you’ve ever known and you become unable todeal with them in a reasonable way. You begin to expect the worst of them (oryourself). Stay away from negative labels. It’s too easy to make them come true. ANT #9 (the most poisonous red ANT): Blame. People who ruin their own lives havea strong tendency to blame other people when things go wrong. They take littleresponsibility for their problems. When something goes wrong at home, school, orwork, they try to find someone to blame. They rarely admit their own problems.Typically you’ll hear statements from them like “It wasn’t my fault that…” “Thatwouldn’t have happened if you had…” “How was I supposed to know…?” “It’s yourfault that…” and so on. The bottom-line statement goes something like this: “Ifonly you had done something differently, then I wouldn’t be in the predicamentI’m in. It’s your fault, and I’m not responsible.”Blaming others starts early. I have three children. When my youngest, Katie, was18 months old she would blame her brother, who was 11, for any trouble she mightbe in. Her nickname for him was DiDi, and “Didi did it,” even if he wasn’t home.One day she spilled a drink at the table while her mother’s back was turned.When her mother turned around and saw the mess and asked what had happened,Katie told her that “Didi spilled my drink.” When her mother told her that herbrother was at a friend’s house, Katie persisted in saying that “Didi did it.”Whenever you blame someone else for the problems in your life, you becomepowerless to change anything. Many kids play the “Blame Game,” but it rarelyhelps them. Stay away from blaming thoughts and take personal responsibility foryour life. Whenever you notice an ANT entering your mind, train yourself to recognize itand write it down. When you write down automatic negative thoughts (ANTs) andtalk back to them, you begin to take away their power and gain control over yourmoods. When you write them down, you realize that they’re just little tiny ANTs,and you can squash them.Here are some examples of ways to kill these ANTs:ANTSpecies of ANTThoughts to kill the ANTThere’s nothing“all or nothing”There are probably lots of things to do to do. if I think about it for a littlewhile.No one ever“always” thinkingThat’s silly. I have played plays with me. with lots of kids in my life.The boss doesn’t like me.mind readingI don’t know that. Maybe she’s just having a bad day. Bosses are people too.The whole class will laugh at me.fortune tellingI don’t know that.

Teach them to bepositive and it will benefit their minds and their bodies. Take time to teachyourself and your kids how to think positive and feel good."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25FOCUSED BREATHINGThe Immediate ADD SalveTemper problems, anxiety, impulsivity, restlessness, insomnia, and lack of focusare common problems in people with ADD. I have found that a very simplebiofeedback breathing technique helps to combat these problems. It is so simple,in fact, that many of you will be skeptical about how helpful it can be and notuse it. Big mistake. Let me tell you why.Like brain activity, breathing is also involved in everything you do. Breathingis essential to life. The purpose of breathing is to get oxygen from the airinto your body and to blow off waste products such as carbon dioxide. Every cellin your body needs oxygen in order to function properly. Brain cells areparticularly sensitive to oxygen, as they start to die within four minutes whenthey are deprived of it. Slight changes in oxygen content in the brain can alterthe way a person feels and behaves. When a person gets angry, his or herbreathing pattern changes almost immediately. Breathing becomes more shallow andthe rate increases significantly (see diagram below). This breathing pattern isinefficient and the oxygen content in the angry person’s blood is lowered.Subsequently there is less oxygen available to a person’s brain and he or shemay become more irritable, impulsive, and confused, causing him or her to makebad decisions, such as to yell, threaten, or hit another person.image [Images/page356.jpg]Breathing diagram: The large waveform is a measurement by a gauge attachedaround the belly during abdominal or belly breathing; the smaller waveform is ameasurement by a gauge attached around the upper chest during chest breathing.At rest, this person breathes mostly with his belly (a good pattern), but whenhe thinks about an angry situation, his breathing pattern deteriorates, markedlydecreasing the oxygen to his brain (common to anger outbursts). No wonder peoplewho have anger outbursts often seem irrational!To correct this negative breathing pattern, I teach my patients to becomeexperts at breathing slowly and deeply, mostly with their bellies. In my officeI have some very sophisticated biofeedback equipment that uses strain gauges tomeasure breathing activity. I place one gauge around a person’s chest and asecond one around his or her belly. The biofeedback equipment then measures themovement of the chest and belly as the person breathes in and out. Many people,especially men, breathe exclusively with their chests, which is an inefficientway to breathe. If you watch a baby or a puppy breathe, you notice that theybreathe almost solely with their bellies. That is much more efficient. If youexpand your belly when you breathe in, it allows room for your lungs to inflatedownward, increasing the amount of air available to your body. I teach patientsto breathe with their bellies by watching their pattern on the computer screen.In twenty to thirty minutes, most people can learn how to change their breathingpatterns, which relaxes them and gives them better control over how they feeland behave.To do this at home, lie on your back and place a small book on your belly. Whenyou breathe in, make the book go up, and when you breathe out, make the book godown. Shifting the energy of breathing lower in your body will help you feelmore relaxed and in better control of yourself.You can use this breathing technique to help you be more focused and lessanxious and to have better control over your temper. It is easy to learn and itcan also be applied to help with the sleep problems so common in ADD.Here’s an example of how helpful this technique can be. Twenty-two-year-old Bartcame to see me for ADD symptoms and problems with anxiety and temper. During myfirst session with him, I noticed that he talked fast and breathed in a shallow,quick manner. One of my recommendations was for Bart to do three sessions ofbreathing biofeedback. He was amazed at how easy this form of breathing was andhow relaxed he could make himself in a short period of time. He noted that hislevel of anxiety improved and that he had better control of his temper.Ever since I learned this technique fifteen years ago, I have used itpersonally. I use it when I feel anxious, angry, or stressed. It sounds sosimple, but breathing is essential to life, and when we slow down and becomemore efficient at it, most things seem better."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26ADD COACHINGwith Master ADD Coach Jane MassengillAnew, powerful treatment for many people with ADD is something called“coaching.” ADD coaching is a specific set of interventions that help people setand reach their goals in life. It helps develop structure and skills that canreduce problems with focus and procrastination. In this chapter I have asked mygood friend, colleague, and ADD coach Jane Massengill to help me write asynopsis of ADD coaching. Jane is a licensed clinical social worker and acertified professional coactive coach. Together we will address how a coachingrelationship works. We will delineate the responsibilities of both the coach andthe client, as well as how someone with ADD can expect to benefit by having anADD coach.Although there is a tremendous amount of variety in how people do ADD coaching,at our clinic the general format looks like this. An initial meeting isscheduled for two to three hours, in person if possible. It can be done over thephone if distance is a factor. Clients are given a workbook with numerous tools.This is the beginning: a place to record how they want to create change in theirlife. Some of the key topics in the workbook include the following: Action List,Balance Wheel, Habits, Commitments, Time Management, Organization, Goals,Vision, Values, Skills, and Money Management.During the initial meeting, clients identify several areas that they want tokeep as the focus of the work with the coach. They overview where they are inlife and begin to identify goals and habits that will move them toward wherethey want to be. This is also a place where the coaching relationship will bedesigned. Clients identify how they are best motivated and how they have beenmost successful in the past.Here’s what we ask: 1. Be honest. Honesty is the best policy in coaching—in fact, the only policy! You must be honest with your coach about whether you completed an assignment or tried something you were challenged to. If you don’t, you are sabotaging your chances for making the relationship work. In coaching, everything is celebrated, including successes and failures! If you aren’t willing to fail, you aren’t willing to succeed! Your coach creates a very safe environment where you can be honest about even your most difficult areas. 2. Give your coach permission to be honest with you. Sometimes it’s hard to hear things about ourselves that other people notice. And yet, that’s part of the power of coaching. Your coach must have your full permission to tell you when he or she notices you are moving away from rather than toward your goals. This is done without judgment and solely for the sake of your learning. 3. Be willing to work at change. You have to have a desire to change yourself when you enter a relationship with a coach. You are the one who will be taking action and creating new habits. Therefore, it has to be something that’s important for you, not your spouse, your parent, or your employer.The coaching sessions after the initial meeting generally take place over thephone for thirty minutes a week. Some clients prefer meeting in the office foran hour once a week, or twice a week for fifteen or thirty minutes. Some coachesinclude a daily check-in period via phone, e-mail or fax to help withaccountability.To illustrate just how powerful coaching can be, we’ll take you throughsomeone’s real-life coaching experience….Thomas wanted to work with an ADD coach for help with being more disciplined. Hehad been diagnosed with ADD three years before and was not feeling he was doingall that he could to control his symptoms. He owned his own business and wasfinancially successful, but he felt he was poor at keeping commitments and beingorganized, both personally and professionally. He was very critical of himself,despite his professional achievements. Thomas attributed his financial successto good fortune rather than to any intentional effort. He was not convinced thathe could recreate this same success anywhere else in his life.BALANCEThe first thing we looked at was the overall “balance” in Thomas’s life. Balanceis the way we choose to divide ourselves among the different areas of our life:home, family, work, etc. Although we think of “being in balance” as an equaldivision among these areas, the truth is that balance is never completely equal.It is always in motion. Stand on one foot and try to balance yourself and youwill see that even though you are balanced, you are never completely still.Although clients come to coaching for specific issues, a coach helps themdevelop the skills to look at their whole lives and be able to see how theydivide their time. We call this “seeing The Big Picture.” The coach’s role isalways to be watching for whether her client is moving toward or away frombalance in their life.Using a pie-shaped diagram with each “slice” representing a different area oflife, the client scores him-or herself on the current level of satisfaction heor she is experiencing. The scale is from 1 to 10, with 10 being the greatestdegree of satisfaction and 1 being the lowest. Thomas’s life looked like this: career: 5money management: 3physical health: 3family and friends: 5significant other/romance: 5personal growth: 6fun and recreation: 6physical environment: 5 By having a visual tool to help Thomas see The Big Picture, he was able torecognize which areas of his life needed the most attention. He also could seewhich area, if brought to a 10 first, would have the most impact on the otherareas. Physical health was the area that Thomas saw as having the greatesteffect on the other areas of his life. When he gets regular exercise, he feelsclearer and more connected to the rest of the world. Ultimately he will havebetter relationships with friends and family and more energy to pursue his othergoals.PRIMARY FOCUSDuring the initial session, clients are asked to list those things that theywant to have as their focus while they are in this coaching relationship. Thisgives both the coach and the client some clarity about what is expected.Thomas chose several areas to have as his primary focus of coaching: 1. to create and follow a regular schedule for routines, both personally and professionally 2. to be more in control of rigid thought patterns 3. to better follow through on commitments 4. to create and follow a consistent exercise program.The coach’s role is to hold the focus for the clients in creating a way to getwhat the clients want. Often clients with ADD will forget why they came tocoaching in the first place or why they even wanted to make changes in theirlives. Coaches help to keep clients pointed toward their goals and remind them,especially when the going gets tough, of what they are trying to create forthemselves. When a client brings up issues that seem unrelated to his or herprimary focus, the coach helps by asking questions that explore how the currentissue may or may not relate to what the client wants.VALUESOur values are a thumbprint of who we are. They are those things in life that wehold sacred. Love, family, humor, joy, honesty and spirituality are examples ofvalues. When we allow values to be honored in our lives, our true selves showup: not who we would like to be, but our unique selves, the selves that appearwhen we are being authentic in expressing and relating to ourselves and others.Our values are like an arrow, pointing us in the direction of being true toourselves. They can be turned to when making decisions, when trying tounderstand interpersonal relationships, and when problems with procrastinationoccur.Discovering one’s values is a starting point in coaching that gives the client asense of direction and ownership. During our first meeting, we helped Thomasidentify his nine most important values. We did this by exploring peak momentsin his life and looking for times when he felt completely fulfilled and totallyalive. We also looked at his biggest arguments and what values were gettingsquished. The list took shape like this: 1. family 2. freedom 3. integrity/honesty 4. joy 5. spirituality 6. emotional and physical health 7. humor 8. sensuality 9. service/contributionOnce we identified the values that were important to him, we looked at how muchhe was honoring these values by the actions in his life. Thomas was pleased tosee that the majority of his key values were indeed being given attention. Whathe needed to focus on more was finding more ways to honor his values of family,spirituality, physical health, and integrity. These were used as a springboardfor action in the coaching relationship. By the end of the first session, Thomasagreed to take on a daily habit of spending fifteen minutes every eveningplanning for the next day. He also committed himself to find a place to keep hiswallet, which he frequently lost at home. For the longer term, he agreed tobegin the process of developing a social schedule with several of his friends.He asked to be held accountable to all these things, to be reviewed on the firstcall.GREMLINSFor the first several weeks Thomas was on a roll, accomplishing most things towhich he set out to be held accountable. Then the real change began. Thomas wasbeginning to hit roadblocks for the bigger areas that he wanted to work on, suchas organizing his desk, sticking to a routine, and exercising. He was stuck in acycle of belief that he was incapable of being able to do these things becauseof his past performance, his ADD, and his procrastination in making acommitment. It was time to go “gremlin hunting”! The “gremlin” is a concept usedin coaching to identify the voice within us that holds us back from being who wewant to be. It sabotages our growth and keeps us from taking action. RichardCarson, in his book Taming Your Gremlin, provides a format to help you becomeaware of the gremlin and how to control it. The concept of the gremlin is one ofthe most powerful tools someone takes away from coaching.Thomas agreed to “polish his gremlin radar” for the week, simply noticing whenit was present. He would notice where in his body his gremlin liked to live, inwhat situations he was most likely to show up, and what his favorite sayings ofsabotage were. Best of all, he could begin to fantasize about how he would liketo get rid of him! For someone who values humor, this can be fun!The following week, Thomas was in amazement about how his gremlin wascontrolling him! He realized that the tightness in his neck and shoulders waspart of his gremlin, telling him to work harder because nobody believed he couldkeep up. He also began to see that his belief system was being controlled by hisgremlin. He heard messages such as You can’t be organized, You are too old toexercise consistently, and Why try to follow a routine? You never stick toanything anyway!Thomas developed an imaginary jail to send his gremlin to when he noticed he wasacting up as a way of learning to control him. Once the gremlin was aside,Thomas was instructed to ask himself this question: I’ve noticed my gremlin hasa judgment or an opinion here. What are my choices in this situation? This gavethe control back to Thomas to make his own decisions and not let his gremlindecide for him. We tied his values into his decision-making process, choosingactions that included integrity, spirituality, and family. Thomas’s self-esteemstarted to take off at this point!VISIONHaving an idea of what you want your future to look like is an important part ofcoaching. Before you can set goals and work toward them, it helps to have amental picture of what you want to create. The most commonly asked question incoaching is “What do you want?” Lots of time is spent developing the skill of“metaview,” meaning seeing things in The Big Picture. This is an area that tendsto be weak for people with ADD, especially the overfocused subtype. We usemetaphors like gardening to help clients get an image of what they want the“landscape” to look like, what type of flowers they want to plant, and what sortof care the garden is going to require. Clients often find that they arespending too much time nurturing a flower they don’t even like or studying onepart of the garden while not seeing that another section is dying.For Thomas, this vision started with an assignment to write out his idea of aperfect day, from start to finish. He had full permission to be as creative ashe wanted, as long as he completed the task. He faxed it before the nextsession. We compared his vision of a perfect day to his list of values and tohis balance wheel. When exercise was missing, we looked for what there might beto learn from that. For Thomas, there was a gremlin lurking with his messageabout not being able to get his body in shape at this age. Once he realizedthat, Thomas was able to look at his choices and make a commitment to includeexercise in his perfect day because of the benefits he knew it would give himboth physically and mentally.Thomas also created a two-year vision for the areas of his life that matched hisbalance wheel. He became very specific about what he wanted his life to looklike, including how much he wanted to weigh, what he wanted his office to looklike, how often he will take trips with friends and family, and what he wantedhis net worth to be. From this we created a list of goals and prioritized whichone would have the biggest impact on his life once completed. We also worked onraising his awareness about The Big Picture of his life. We did this byimagining jumping into a helicopter together and spying on his life to see whatwe could see from a distance. Thomas’s coach gave him the question “What am Ichoosing right now?” to ponder for the week and see what he could learn from it.GOALSReaching a goal that you never imagined you could reach is one of the bestfeelings in the world! Ask anyone who had been told they will never walk againand what they felt like when they took their first step. Wow! Most people cometo coaching with fear that they will not be able to be organized or to besuccessful in a job due to their ADD. They believe that because of theirprogramming, change is impossible. One of the most significant moments for mostpeople in ADD coaching is when they are asked the following question: “Okay, youhave ADD. How do you want to be with it? How do you want to show up in life,given that you have this? You have some choices here. What do you want?” Once aclient sees that they do indeed have some choices about their attitude and thelanguage they use in dealing with their ADD, goals begin to flow naturally.Breaking things down into baby steps is very helpful in reaching goals. Peoplewith ADD tend to have trouble looking at the big picture and seeing a path tothe goals. There is a feeling of being overwhelmed, sensory overload, and thendefeat. In coaching, we teach people how to approach goal setting and then keepthem accountable about doing what they say they are going to do. Clients learnto take on a 360-degree view of what it will take to accomplish their goals.They look at the following questions: What will I have when the goal is accomplished?What am I saying yes to by working toward my goal?What do I need to say no to by working toward my goal?What resources do I need to obtain or develop?What habits do I need to have in place?In the past, what has gotten in the way of obtaining my goal?What are three things I can do differently from what I have tried in the past?What is the action I will take on a daily basis that will move me closer to mygoal?By what date do I wish to accomplish my goal? For Thomas, we mapped out all the steps that needed to be done to accomplish oneparticular goal. At the end of his road map, he would have a clean desk at homeand at work. He began by looking at what got in his way in the past.Distractions seemed to be the number one problem in both places. He broke thesteps of this goal down like this: 1. Review material on organizing for executives. 2. Decide which organizational system I want to choose. 3. Purchase baskets and files needed for desk organizing system. 4. Spend ten minutes a day at my desk to organize materials, standing up! (Keep my attention focused! I will use a timer as an auditory reminder of when my time is finished.) 5. Ask my daughter if she wants to spend one hour a week to file materials. I will pay her for this.Simply having a system in place seemed to reduce procrastination. Thomas alsoliked the idea of standing as it was something physical he could do to be morein charge of his distractions.LIFE PURPOSEA life purpose statement, often referred to as a mission statement, is a way todescribe one’s intention in life. It is a statement about how you will make adifference on the planet, both in your life and in the lives of others. Whenclients are living their lives with the knowledge of their life purposes, theyare living intentionally, not by accident. They are focused on paths withdirection.In coaching, we ask clients this key question: “What needs to change on theinside to create change on the outside?” It isn’t just about setting up goodsystems or structures. Lasting change comes from the understanding of what ourlife purposes are, who we are, and how we uniquely impact the people around us.Knowing one’s purpose is like the battery that drives the motor. Over and over,it drives clients in coaching to look at whether the choices they are making areconsistent with The Big Picture of their lives.Defining Thomas’s life purpose was quite meaningful for him. We spent severalweeks working on the idea of who he is and how he impacts the world. He was veryclear on this in his role as a father and husband, but not so with the rest ofhis life. Once he took the time to explore it, he began to acknowledge himselffor his gifts and talents, while at the same time following the vision of thelife he was creating for himself. He began to realize that he wasn’t just luckyin how his life was turning out. It was because of who he is in the world, hisattitude, his drive, his caring about others. We tapped into the things in lifethat give him passion, such as community outreach, spending quality time withhis kids, and stopping to say hello to a stranger. He started to see how hecould make choices that would give him more of a sense of fulfillment andbalance in his life.SKILLSSkill building is an art. The two most important parts of developing a skill arepractice and commitment. During this awkward stage of development, there isusually a period of ups and downs, being excited, testing the waters, retreatingbecause of failure, moving forward with fear, and finally making a commitment tosucceed. Most people find relief in knowing that a coaching relationship is asafe place to practice these skills without worry of being judged or measured.This gives them permission to practice the skills in ways that are unfamiliar tothem. For people with ADD, this is refreshing, exciting, and stimulating.Here are several skills used in ADD coaching:AwarenessOne of the biggest aspects of building any skill is the awareness of when andwhere to use the skill. Awareness is a common issue for most people with ADD.“Feeling fuzzy” is the way one client describes what gets in the way of makingdecisions and following routines. Another client calls it his “deer in theheadlights” feeling. For him, this is when he is immobile, even with theknowledge of impending disaster. A third person refers to it as “the twirls.” “Igo from room to room, not even sure why I went there in the first place.” In ADDcoaching, building one’s awareness is imperative to success. The client developsan internal awareness monitor through the coach’s use of questions. Questionslike “How do I know when I am fully present?” “What am I choosing right now?”and “Where is my awareness?” are ways for clients to be reminded of when theyare on or off track. We set up systems to help them ask these questions, such asvisual or auditory reminders on watches, clocks, computers, etc.Thomas chose several ways to develop his awareness. First of all, he implementeda system of using timers to keep him on track. He put a timer on his desk atwork, on his watch, and in his home office. He used the timer to get him startedon a job he didn’t feel very motivated to do, like clean his briefcase or paythe bills. Once the timer ran for fifteen minutes, he had the choice to continueor quit. Usually he chose to continue. Getting started was the hardest part forhim. Secondly, he used the timers to stay on task and not get too fardistracted. For example, when he wanted to surf the Internet at night, he wouldset the timer for one hour to set boundaries for himself to go to bed. He alsodeveloped a system of stickers as a reminder to be mentally present and look athis choices of the moment. He placed the stickers in places where he foundhimself most often distracted, such as on the phone, in his car, on his computerscreen, and on his daytimer. Thomas had to change the stickers about once amonth, otherwise he got used to them and would not see them. He found themhelpful in bringing him back to reality when he was daydreaming and remindinghim to focus on what was important just then.HabitsThe definition of a habit, according to the Random House Dictionary is this: “anacquired behavior pattern regularly followed until it has become almostinvoluntary.” We have come to believe that our habits are a part of ourpersonality and therefore impossible, or at least gruelingly difficult, tochange. And yet, most people come to coaching with a genuine desire to changeand get rid of the struggles they experience. A coach—being with you in thejourney, and there to pick you up when you fall and cheer you at the finishline—believes that you can change your habits. Although there is anacknowledgment that the symptoms of ADD are difficult, a coach understands thatwith practice and commitment, change is possible. Coaching is most powerful whenthe client is committed to the belief that habits can be changed, and that meansgetting the gremlin out of the way. There are several techniques we use tostrengthen this commitment. One is “stepping over the line.” The clientliterally steps over a threshold to symbolize that leaving behind what he or shedoes not want and “stepping into” a new place where the client will take actionto get what he or she does want. We also use a technique called a “yes/no”board. This is a poster with YES on the left and NO on the right. Clients writeout the things in their lives that they are saying yes to as well as the thingsto which they are saying no in order to achieve their goals. For example, sayingyes to taking a continuing education class may mean saying no to a regular nightout with friends. This tool helps in visualizing what they must give up in orderto gain something else. We find that these types of tools aide in memory as wellas offer an opportunity to acknowledge consistency or to look at what got in theway of success.Thomas had daily and weekly habits that he recorded. For most people, habitschange throughout the course of coaching. After they achieve the first few,others are added. At the beginning of coaching, Thomas’s list included theseitems: 1. Take fifteen minutes before bed to plan for the next day. 2. Spend ten minutes in some type of spiritual reflection daily. 3. Exercise three times a week. 4. Do something nice for my wife weekly.As Thomas developed these items to his satisfaction, he would add new things tobe tracked. After a year in coaching, his list looked like this: 1. On Sunday night, spend fifteen minutes planning for the week. 2. Exercise daily. 3. Listen to thirty minutes of spiritual music or tapes while commuting, three times a week. 4. Spend one hour of quality time with wife and/or kids daily.By developing the skills he wished to incorporate into his life, Thomas was ableto rearrange his thinking about how he could run his business. Eventually hemade choices that allowed him more time for the things in his life that were themost important to him.The biggest change in coaching for Thomas was when he honestly believed that hecould change his habits. Despite having ADD, he did have some control in hislife over his ability to be organized and focused. This was truly a time to becelebrated! It was from this point forward that his energy and momentum tookoff!Perspective and ChoiceWhen ADD clients seek out a coach, they are desperate to be relieved of theirpain. They feel out of balance and stuck, unsure which way to turn and unsure oftheir abilities to be able to succeed. One thing that makes coaching so powerfulis the questions asked by the coach to help clients look at their lives fromdifferent perspectives or angles. We often choose the perspective we have for agood reason. We get stuck in believing that there is only one way, based on theexperiences we’ve had or the knowledge we currently hold. For example, oneclient saw no hope for herself in passing a medical board exam. She had failedon several occasions. From her perspective, that meant she was incapable of everpassing it. After several sessions of exploring her current perspective, theclient realized that by not passing the exam, she was validating her feelingsabout herself as a loser. She recognized that past attempts at test taking didnot include all that she could do to pass, such as having a study partner andcreating a review schedule. Once she saw that her gremlin was the one whoactually held her in this perspective, she was able to move forward with zest inher belief that she was indeed a winner and fully capable of taking and passingthis exam! Even if she never passed, she gained a perspective about herself thatwas liberating and gave her a choice to be whoever she wanted to be. Thetransformation was breathtaking!In coaching, we are always looking for other perspectives that the clients canchoose. “Choice” is an important word here. What makes coaching work is theclients’ ability to choose what will work for them. Being able to choose givesyou a sense of power and fulfillment like nothing else! It takes you out of arole of being a victim and places you in the role of being an “owner,” asdescribed by Steve Chandler in his book Reinventing Yourself: “Owners create andvictims react. Taking ownership is the highest form of focus.” When you areintentional in your choices, you are living a life that has clarity andfullness. You are living on purpose, not by accident.Throughout his period of being coached, Thomas had many opportunities to look atwhat perspective he was holding and see what other ones he could choose. This isone habit that develops for most clients in coaching. An inner voice pipes in toencourage them to see things from different perspectives—just for the fun of it,if nothing else. A coach might ask how Elmer Fudd would look at this situationor what a blind man might say about it. From this comes a lightness about choiceinstead of the well-known heaviness that is often experienced. There is also anacknowledgment about the fear that gets in the way of making choices. ForThomas, when this fear got in the way, he was challenged to wear a sticker thatsaid, “I can handle it.” In this way, he was creating a mantra for himself thatgave him freedom to take risks and make mistakes, all with the greater goal inmind of getting what he wants for himself in life.THE PROCESS OF THE PATHAs for most people in coaching, there are roadblocks that get hit while they arein the process of change. Many don’t even see these blocks because they havebecome so ingrained in who they are. Our gremlins want us to believe that theseblocks are absolutely impossible to move. In coaching, we get right in the faceof the roadblocks and try to look at them from as many different perspectives aswe can to see what we can learn about them. We even try to experience thefeelings that arise when we imagine the worst thing that could happen. Some ofthe most common roadblocks include fear of failure, fear of success andresponsibility, loneliness, rejection, sadness, emptiness, and commitment. Welook at the associations clients have with these ideas and how they hold certainbeliefs as the absolute truth about them. By actually experiencing theseemotions in coaching sessions, clients begin to see the absurdity of theirbeliefs and how maintaining the beliefs only hold them back in life. In this waythey face their fears. The power the roadblocks had over them is dissipated.Coaching invites people to be challenged in a way that holds them in a soft,friendly light. The coach creates an environment where exploration is safe andwhere curiosity wins out over judgment. No one loses. Risk taking is celebrated,no matter what the outcome is. It demonstrates that the client is taking actionand moving in the direction of their path. This is a tremendous relief forpeople with ADD who have had what feels like a long list of failures. Bybreaking through a roadblock that they thought was impossible to move, theydevelop a greater sense of confidence in their abilities. This in turn givesthem momentum to move forward with their goals. Because of the drive forstimulation, once they find a goal that has meaning, they are difficult to stop!One area in which Thomas got stuck was in his belief that he could not beorganized due to his biology of having ADD. Whenever he sat down at his desk, hewas overwhelmed by the quantity of papers and the tasks that lay ahead. He wouldturn off and do something that would distract him from his desk. Often this wasgetting on the Internet or calling business associates to discuss ideas. Butthis wasn’t getting him what he wanted: a clean desk! So we explored whatfeelings come up for Thomas when he sits down at his desk and wants to dive intohis work but instead flounders. All he saw was a big black hole. We “gotcurious” about this hole, visualized jumping in, and enveloped ourselves in whatit was like. After several minutes “in the hole,” Thomas realized that he had anegative association with perfectionism. In his mind, perfectionism was equal toexposure. If he tried to be organized and orderly, people would discover that hewas not as smart as he appeared. They would see that he wasn’t a great spellerand didn’t graduate from the best college. This would negate him in their eyes,and consequently he would lose his business and end up poor and rejected. Withthe coach’s acknowledgment of Thomas’s strengths, accomplishments, and values,Thomas was able to see the absurdity of his association with perfectionism andhow it impacted his energy to be organized. He became more committed to himselfat this point and started to tackle his daily habits with enthusiasm and abelief that he could succeed!ENDINGSThe length of coaching varies. Clients are asked to make a three-monthcommitment to the process, primarily to acknowledge that long-term change takestime. For most clients, six months seems to be a minimum. At this writing Thomashas been in coaching for one year and has recently lengthened the time betweensessions to once a month to test his abilities to maintain his new habits. Manyclients choose to stay in a coaching relationship over time, perhaps talkingonce or twice a year. Because coaching is primarily done over the phone,distance is not an issue. When someone moves, the relationship does not have tobe terminated. It’s calming to know that there is always a place to go where youwill be accepted for whoever you are, where your failures will be celebratedjust as much as your achievements, and where you can be reminded of the bigpicture of your life. Here are some of the comments clients have made about ADDcoaching: “I feel like I lost weight in a whole different way!”“I am living a life of intention.”“This is more powerful than any therapy I’ve ever done.”“When someone else believes in you, you start to believe in yourself.”“I feel so much more focused and aware of the choices I make.”“The myths I had about myself being disorganized have disappeared!”“You aren’t just an ADD coach, you are a life coach.” Coaching is about action and learning. Both pieces must be present if coachingis to take place. The best learning occurs when the coach gets out of the wayand asks questions that will generate the client’s own deductions andintuitions. The client learns not to look to the coach for the answers butrather looks inside him-or herself. Clients will often say to their coach, “Iknow what to do. I just don’t do it!” This is the basis on which coactive ADDcoaching is built. When clients come up with their own answers, they develop agenuine awareness of themselves and their abilities that allows them toacknowledge who they are and the gifts they have. Yes, there is still somefrustration with piles and lists, even when the coaching relationship windsdown. But what is in its place is an ability to be focused on the things in lifethat are truly important. The piles may take on less meaning or may becompletely under control, depending on what the clients value. The importantpart is that the clients leave the coaching relationship realizing that theyhave a choice about the piles and how they want to see them. They may have begunto dream of even bigger “piles” to tackle, such as starting businesses or goingafter careers they were always afraid to pursue. This is the exhilarating partof coaching: watching people go headfirst in life, with confidence, enthusiasm,passion, and intention.RECOMMENDED READINGDaniel G.

He has a private practice in Nevada City, and heis also on staff at the Amen Clinic.PROGRAMMING AND THE HUMAN BRAINTo some people the idea of “programming” or “reprogramming” sometimes soundssomehow cold and calculating. Science fiction books and movies often portrayevil mind-control tyrants as using “programming” to turn susceptible people intorobotlike subjects. The truth is that the human brain acquires information andmakes decisions based upon the instructions it has been given, just like acomputer. Many of the instructions for how to interpret the world and how toreact to it were trained into us when we were children, and we had no say overwhat programs were being implanted. These programs persist as our beliefs.Often, especially for people with ADD, these beliefs, especially aboutthemselves, can be very harmful.What we see and feel as we confront the challenges of everyday life isdramatically affected by what we believe. A little trick one of our collegeroommates used to do was to wet his hands, then, while walking behind anotherstudent, let out a huge sneeze, flicking the water over the back of the neck andhead of his unsuspecting mark. The reaction of the student to what he felt wasoften dramatic and hilarious. The reaction would have been much different had herealized that someone was just flicking some clean, cold water on the back ofhis head and neck.The programming each of us has received has served to convince us that certainof our beliefs about the world are “true,” even though they may becomecompletely arbitrary. For example, if a talented, attractive student tries outfor the school play, but he believes that he is not very attractive or talented,he has little chance of getting the part. Many of our convictions aboutourselves—whether we feel like a success or failure, whether we feel lucky orunlucky, whether the glass is half empty or half full—are just beliefs and canall be changed. If they are not changed, they become self-fulfilling prophecies.Many people with ADD have been programmed into believing they can’t change thethings that are holding them back from being successful in their lives. Thisnegative belief system is one of the first things that must change. A personwith ADD often finds himself experiencing failure: failure to perform to hishighest potential, failure to be able to sit still, failure to concentrate well,failure to organize well, failure to avoid distraction and addictive tendencies.This can lead to intense feelings of shame, guilt, fear, anxiety, and anger.Your attitudes about yourself or the things that people said to you in the pastcreated an internal set of beliefs that hold you back. If you can recognize thatthese thoughts are just beliefs that belong to you, you can change them andconvert them into positive beliefs that support you.Common negative beliefs developed by people with ADD are: “People are mad at me.”“I am an annoying person.”“I mess things up.”“For some reason, no one can ever understand me.”“I’m not worth very much.”“The world is very overwhelming to me.”“No matter how hard I try, I just can’t get organized [be on time, focus for along period of time, avoid distractions, etc.].” The process you learn in this chapter will enable you to recognize both that youhave these beliefs and that you can change them. You will learn how, throughself-hypnosis, you can replace the faulty beliefs with positive, helpful ones.CHANGING YOUR BELIEFS WITH SELF-HYPNOSISThe good news is that your brain and your mind belong to you. You have the rightand the power to look at the beliefs, feelings, and behaviors that run yourlife, and to decide which you want to keep and which you want to change. One ofthe most powerful tools for doing this is the tool known as self-hypnosis. Thetechniques of self-hypnosis are widely used by psychologists and psychiatristsin clinical settings, and by peak performers such as athletes, musicians,actors, and public speakers, whose success depends upon their using their mindsat peak efficiency. Self-hypnosis is simply a tool—a powerful tool—that can beused to dramatically change your beliefs and your life.The fundamental steps of self-hypnosis are: 1. entering a state of deep relaxation 2. positive affirmations 3. visualizing success, and 4. leaving the state of deep relaxation and returning to a more usual, wakeful state of consciousness.STEP ONE: ENTERING THE DEEPLY RELAXED (SELF-HYPNOTIC) STATETo enter the state of deep relaxation, you will first learn how to useautosuggestion to separate yourself from all the fears, tensions, stresses, andconfusions of the outside world for a few minutes. This is done by letting go ofmental and physical tension, by focusing on the present moment, and by allowingyourself to experience inner silence, stillness, and mental and physicalrelaxation. The technique we will use is counting to twenty, allowing the eyesto close, sending waves of relaxation throughout your body, then going to yourown special place, your “haven.” The first few times you do this, you may notfind yourself relaxing as deeply as the words seem to suggest. This is merelybecause you need practice. The world has trained most of us to be tense. Afteryou have done this a number of times, you will find it easier to enter a deepstate of relaxation quickly.STEP TWO: POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONSThe second step is to hear positive self-talk. Most of us talk to ourselves eachday, but much of what we say is negative, e.g., “I’m such a dolt,” “I’ll neverbe successful,” and “Everybody else is doing better than I am.” The statementsyou will read to yourself on the tape will replace these negative statementswith positive ones. These will then begin to create positive beliefs aboutyourself to replace the negative, harmful ones. Our goal is to create confidencewhere there was shyness; focus where there was disorganization; self-confidencewhere there was self-doubt; self-awareness where there was denial;self-acceptance where there was self-criticism; self-control and empowermentwhere there was helplessness.STEP THREE: VISUALIZING SUCCESSOne of the most powerful learning tools is the human imagination. When childrenare playing house or building a fort in the backyard, they are actually learningvery important skills. They are willfully suspending their disbelief andallowing themselves to pretend, to temporarily believe that they are actuallyparents or soldiers. Wise teachers know how to use imagination and pretend toteach valuable lessons. We will use imagination in a very similar way. If weasked you to close your eyes and imagine sitting in your living room, you wouldbe able to point to the window and to the front door, and to reach over andpretend to flip on the light. In order to do this, you would be holding in yourmind an image, a kind of mental model, then referring to it to give yourresponses to the questions. This is an example of mental imagery, orvisualization. Even though we may use the word “visualization,” do not think itis absolutely necessary to “see” a clear “picture” in your mind. Fifty percentof adults, and most children, can “see” mental images in this way. It is helpfulbut not necessary for our purposes here. In the same way that you can make thismental model of your living room, you can make a mental model of your workplace(where your desk is, where your boss’s office is, where the phone is, etc.), oryour child can make a mental model of his/her classroom. Your goals will be to: 1. mentally picture a challenging situation that may occur in the future—one in which you might have used inappropriate behavior (anger, distraction, fear, avoidance, etc.) in the past, and 2. visualize the kind of behavior you would use if you truly believed the positive affirmations you have just given yourself.As you go through this scene, you will imagine yourself actually being there andcarrying out the most successful behavior you can imagine. This will serve to bea kind of “post-hypnotic suggestion” to your deeper mind.STEP 4: DEHYPNOTIZING YOURSELFNo matter how deeply you relax, you will always have the ability to wakeyourself up if there is an emergency or some other situation you need to respondto. You are not “under a spell,” and can wake up even faster than if you hadbeen sleeping! The deeply relaxed state is a very sensitive one. Your vulnerableinner mind is exposed, much as it was when you were a young child. Most of thetime you keep this part of you protected by your “ego,” allowing it to be openlyavailable only when you know you are in a safe, secure situation. In the deeplyrelaxed state, you have dropped your guard, so to speak, and when you return toyour normal waking state, it is best to do it gradually. In this way you will beable to reestablish the ego protections you need to be able to function smoothlyas you go about your next activities. If you rouse yourself too quickly, you mayfeel a bit groggy, half asleep, or even a little anxious. If this should happen,simply sit or lie down and relax briefly, then bring yourself back into fullactivity more slowly.A MOST REMARKABLE TOOLTechnically, once you have learned how, you can enter the hypnotic state just byspeaking silently to yourself with your eyes closed. In the beginning, however,it is too difficult to remember all the steps in the right order while stillremaining relaxed. The act of trying to remember creates tension, which directlycontradicts what you are trying to do. So what you need is a way to be guidedthrough this experience. One way is to have someone read the instructions toyou. If you are working with your child, you may choose to read theseinstructions out loud some of the time, and if you are the subject, it is avirtual necessity. What you need is a way to have the words spoken to you easilywhenever you want. The most remarkable tool for accomplishing this lies right atyour fingertips: the tape recorder! By following through with the very simplesteps in this chapter, you will create a most powerful and effective tool forgaining control of your physiology, your mind, your behaviors, your brain, andyour life.PREPARING YOUR SCRIPTGet a pad and pencil and settle back in your easy chair. Open a page and entitleit “Wise Messages to Myself.” As you read the rest of this chapter, make noteson the things that come to you as you read each of the steps below. Then, usingthis chapter together with your notes, you will create a custom-designedself-programming audiocassette.Create a statement of purpose, a single sentence that describes why you will belistening to this tape. For example: “The purpose of this deep relaxation andimagery experience is to help my conscious and subconscious mind functionbetter, to improve my organization, to improve focus, to stabilize my emotions,and to create patience. Its goal is to self-program at every level the wisestthoughts, feelings, and behaviors that will lead to ever higher degrees ofsuccess.”Read the section below entitled “Script” and familiarize yourself with theinstructions. When you reach the section entitled “Positive Affirmations,” ifthere are any that you do not want to become true for you, draw a line throughthem and don’t read them into the tape. Likewise, if there are certainaffirmations that are especially appropriate for you (or your child), you mayadd them. Feel free to consult with your therapist, teacher or other trustedadvisor about which statements they think it would be most valuable to include.But only include those that you feel very certain that you would like tobelieve. Do not use suggestions that hurt other people. Stay positive.Make any changes to the script that you are sure will make it more effective foryou. Most people will find the wording we have given here perfect just as it is,but don’t feel constrained if you have strong feelings in any way. (Sometimesfolks with strong religious or spiritual convictions will want to put in certainstatements of gratitude to a higher power. This tape is you talking veryintimately and personally to yourself or to your child.)When you reach the imagery about “Your Special Haven,” make notes or write outin detail (whichever you like) a description of a place you associate withrelaxation. This may be a place you have been on vacation, a place you wouldlike to visit someday, or even a completely imaginary place. If you find theimagery of the beach satisfactory, you may use the words written there.Many people find the tape to be more enjoyable and effective if music plays inthe background. If you want music, set up a separate tape deck or CD playernearby, so you can control the volume from your chair. Locate a long piece ofrelatively slow music that you find relaxing. (Many people find that a tempo ofabout sixty beats per minute, the speed of the resting heart, is about right.)During the relaxation phase, play very slow music such as Bach’s “Air for the GString,” Pachelbel’s “Canon,” or slow “New Age” music. The only requirement isthat the music be slow, gentle, relaxing, and appealing to you. You may playthis throughout the entire tape, or, if you wish, you may substitute a moreupbeat piece near the end, as you are visualizing success in the future, as youare awakening. Most of the time it is best to use only instrumental music, sothe words of the songs won’t compete in any way with the positive words you arereading to yourself.Place a tape recorder next to a comfortable chair. Use a tape recorder that willclearly record your voice. Use your voice on the tape. It is better to use aseparate microphone rather than to use the one physically built into yourrecorder. Place the microphone in a holder about one to two feet in front ofyour mouth.INSTRUCTIONS FOR READING THE SCRIPT YOU PREPAREIt is probably best to think of your first attempt to record as a practicesession. This way you can listen to what you have done, closing your eyes andfollowing the instructions to see if the speed, the volume of the music, andother aspects of your recording are just right. Play it back and make a note ofchanges you want to make in it.Speak the words clearly, directly toward the microphone. Speak slowly andclearly, enunciating each word carefully but not so stiffly as to sound rigid.Try for a gentle, flowing sound, one that is soothing yet filled with confidenceand enthusiasm. During step one, deep relaxation, your tone should be similar toone you would use to lull a child to sleep. Then, for the affirmations andimagery, you may want to shift your tone slightly to one that is a little moreupbeat, the kind a coach or support person might use.Most of the time it is a very good idea to personalize the tape by speaking thename of the person for whom you are making the tape several times throughout thetape. So you might begin with “Let yourself sit comfortably back in your chair,Johnny, and listen carefully….” or “Now, Mary, picture yourself walking intoyour class feeling confident, and as you see your teacher, Mr. Wilson, you feeleven better….” Later you might say, “Each time you listen to this tape, Tommy,you will feel more and more confident in yourself.”If you are making this tape for a child, it is almost always a good idea toinclude the child’s name a number of times. If you are making a tape foryourself, you need to decide whether or not you will feel comfortable hearingyour own voice say your name on several occasions.Turn on your tape recorder, wait about five seconds for the leader tape to pass,then immediately start the background music you’re going to play. Let about tenor fifteen seconds of music play on the tape before you begin to speak. As youbegin to speak, try to get your voice to flow along with the music, even fittinginto the tempo of the music if possible. The music should be played at a lowvolume so that it is just gently audible behind your speaking voice, whichshould be recorded quite a bit louder on the tape than the music. The music isthere to help mask background sounds and create relaxation only, and shouldnever be allowed to interfere with the intelligibility of the words you speak.If you make a mistake, stop the tape recorder and the music. Rewind the taperecorder to the place where the error was made. (If you make sure to leavepauses every couple of sentences, there will always be an easy point for you togo back and edit.) Next, rewind the music approximately the same amount of time.It is not essential to start the music at the exact same passage you were in.The music will be very soft in the background, and the change will barely benoticed, if at all. Start the music, then start the tape recorder and continuereading from where you left off. If you need to pause at any point to read theinstructions, you can do so: This is a lot to get through at a single reading.You may pause and, just as you would do if you made a mistake, follow thisprocedure.After completing the recording, take a short break, have a glass of water, ortake a little walk. When you come back, sit back and listen to what you havedone, following the instructions. Have a pad and pencil in your hand so you canmake notes on changes you want to make in your final recording. Do not besurprised or critical when you hear your voice sounding different over yoursmall tape recorder. It sounds very different from what you hear inside. It’simportant to remember that when you listen to your speaking voice, you have astereophonic, high-fidelity connection augmented by the bass reflex subwoofer ofyour chest and the echo chamber of your sinuses. It’s never going to sound thatgood coming out of that little speaker. Everyone tends to react withdisappointment when they hear the sound of their recorded voice. Just ignore anytendency toward self-criticism. When you listen to the tape, you will become sorelaxed, you will forget the sound of the voice and focus on the sound of thewords. Change is going to occur within you; get used to listening to your ownvoice. (A parent’s voice is often soothing and acceptable to a child. If you aredoing this for your child, modify the instructions as appropriate.)You may end up making three or more versions before doing one you feelcomfortable with. Don’t be a perfectionist. You are making a tape for yourself,not something you are entering into a contest. Even a sloppy tape will workfine. Be reasonable.SCRIPT: SELF-HYPNOTIC REPROGRAMMING FOR SUCCESSTurn off the phone, put a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door, and turn off all thenoise possible, especially extraneous alarms like washers, timers, cell phones,beepers, etc. Find a comfortable chair; many people prefer a reclining or loungechair so their head is supported; some people prefer to lie flat, perhaps withsomething supporting the knees and under the head. If you find that you tend togo to sleep while listening to the tape, then it is probably better to situp—and if you still fall asleep, sit in a straight-backed chair. The actualscript to read into the tape recorder is in boldface type.STEP ONE: ENTERING THE DEEPLY RELAXED, SELF-HYPNOTIC STATEHello, [put in your name]…. We are here to clear your mind, relax your soul,break through old barriers, and program success. Pick a spot on the wall alittle above your eye level and stare at it. [You may find it helpful to put alittle thumbtack there to look at.] As you focus on this spot, become aware ofthe fact that there’s no other place that you need to go at this moment, nothingelse that you need to do, and no problem that you need to solve right now.Therefore, you can give yourself permission to relax. Continue to look at thatpoint, and as you do, I am going to begin to count, slowly, from one to twenty.As I count, say the number to yourself, silently, in your mind. You may find ithelpful to picture each number as you count it.[Leave a couple of seconds between each number.]One…two…three…four…five…six…Notice your eyelids beginning to feel heavier and heavier….Seven…eight…nine…ten…eleven…twelve…Notice how that spot in the distance is fading out of focus and your eyelids arefeeling still heavier and heavier….13…14…15…16…17…18…Your eyelids are feeling so heavy, they feel as though they really want toclose.19…20…Take a deep breath in…and as you let that breath out, let your eyelids slowlyclose.[Some people may actually find that they relax more if they leave their eyesopen through the entire experience. If you choose to do this, simply keep themfocused on that spot and don’t be concerned that your eyes stay open in spite ofyour voice saying they are growing heavier. After a while, you may find thatyour eyelids will prefer to close.]In a moment, I’m going to ask you to take three deep breaths, and with eachbreath in, feel relaxation flowing in like pure, white light. And with eachbreathing out, let yourself feel the feeling of letting go. With each breath in,say, silently, to yourself, “With each breath in, I breathe in relaxation,” andwith each breath out, say the words “With each breath out, I let my body breatheout all tension and all the things that may interfere with my becoming totallyrelaxed and comfortable.”Now take a deep breath in, repeating to yourself, “With each breath in, Ibreathe in relaxation.”And as you let this breath out, repeat, internally to yourself, “With eachbreath out, I let my body breathe out all tension and all the things that mayinterfere with my becoming totally relaxed and comfortable.”[Take a few slow, deep breaths in and out, and get a sense of the speed withwhich you will need to read these words to yourself.]Now take another deep breath in, feeling the coolness of the air as it entersthrough your nostrils, and repeat silently, “With each breath in, I breathe inrelaxation.”And as you let this breath out, let it be a feeling of letting go, and repeat,“With each breath out, I let my body breathe out all tension and all the thingsthat may interfere with my becoming totally relaxed and comfortable.”Now take a deep breath in, repeating to yourself, “With each breath in, Ibreathe in relaxation.” As you let it out, imagine you are a balloon letting outall the air, becoming completely flat and relaxed, and say to yourself, “Witheach breath out, I let my body breathe out all tension and all the things thatmay interfere with my becoming totally relaxed and comfortable.”Now let the air do the breathing for you, just as it does when you’re asleep atnight, and feel how your chest and abdomen gently rise and fall with eachbreath, letting each breath continue to relax you from head to toe.Now, as your body continues to relax, close your eyes really tight, as thoughyou were trying to keep soap out of them. Hold them tense for just a fewseconds, and feel the tension in your eyelids.Now, slowly let the muscles of your eyelids relax…relax…more and more relaxedwith each breath. [Five second pause]Notice how much your eyelids have relaxed already. They will continue to relax.And perhaps you will notice your eyes gently rolling upward behind your eyelids,and your eyelids feeling so relaxed, they just don’t want to open at all. Now,as your eyelids become more and more relaxed, imagine ripples of relaxationflowing outward from your eyelids, like ripples flowing outward from a stonethrown into the water…flowing into your forehead…through all the muscles of yourface…relaxing your jaw muscles and your lips…and flowing down through your neckand into your shoulders. Feel your shoulders releasing any tension; you may evenfeel them lower just a tiny little bit as the muscles relax.Now feel the relaxation flowing down through your shoulders and yourarms…flowing through your chest and through all the rest of your body. With eachrising and falling of your chest and abdomen, your chest becomes more relaxedand all your internal organs are becoming more relaxed. Feel that relaxationflowing through your pelvis, relaxing all your pelvic organs…and flowing downthrough your thighs and your knees…your legs and your ankles and your feet…allthe way down to the tips of your toes. Imagine your body is resting in a softtub filled with soothing, warm water, that your muscles are melting…all thetension is being absorbed by the warmth of the water.YOUR SPECIAL SAFE HAVEN[Next, describe a special place…your special place…a special haven that you cango to in your imagination. Maybe a place you’ve been in the past or a placeyou’ve always wanted to go but only seen pictures of. There might have been atime in the past when you were on vacation…. It might even have been a timeearly in your childhood. It can be a real or an imaginary place: The idea is tocreate a place where you feel completely relaxed and comfortable. Describe thisplace clearly to yourself, and slowly, so that it will make it easy for you tovisualize it.[As you describe it, describe the sensations in all your senses—what you see;the sounds around you; the temperature of the air; the movement of your body ifyou’re moving, or its peaceful stillness if you are not; the smell of the air;even the tastes, if there are any tastes there. Use as much detail as you can.You may take from four to eight minutes for this description. Sometimes peoplehave a long description at first when they are learning to relax, then latermake another tape with a description of only one or two minutes in length. Asyou listen to the tape more often, your ability to relax quickly will increase.For children, ask them ahead of time what scene they would like to go to. Theyoften like the beach, the mountains, or a beautiful park. Just as an example, wewill give you a description of walking along the sand at the edge of the ocean.Here’s an example….]Imagine you are on a magic carpet or in a time machine traveling through spaceand time—relaxing as you travel. Imagine you are traveling to a beautiful beach,perhaps on a peaceful tropical island. Even before you see the gentle waves outon the ocean, you can begin to feel the warm sand beneath your feet. Feel thepleasant dryness of the warm sand beneath your feet. And as you move first onefoot and then the other from side to side, you can feel the warm sand on thesides and the tops of your feet. As you push your toes gently into it, you canfeel the dry granules of sand between your warm toes. Gradually you can begin tosee this beautiful beach…dimly at first, then more and more clearly. Now, letyourself look down the beach…and see the warm, glowing, golden-white sand. Letyour eyes follow the beautiful expanse of sand…and as you lift your eyes andlook down this beautiful sandy beach…off to one side you can see the deepblue-green of the ocean. Listen…you can hear the sounds of the ocean wavesrolling slowly to shore and see them breaking into watery white fingers of foamthat glide smoothly over the wet sand. Walk over to the edge of the damp sand,and see the bright reflection of the sky in the thin film of water left behindas each wave strokes the wet surfaces and then rushes back down the slope. Feelthe damp sand beneath your feet. White crests of waves slowly follow each otherin toward the shore. And as you enjoy the deep, rich color of the ocean…perhapsyou can feel the salty breeze blowing in, gently cool on the surface of yourbody. Take a deep breath in, savoring the pleasant fragrance, the smell of thesea. Perhaps even taste the slightly salty taste on your lips and tongue. Andfloating directly above you, you can see the cottony fluffs of pure whiteclouds…and a bird gliding through vast expanses of blue. Behind you is thebright sun, shining and pleasantly warming the skin of your back. Feel thewarmth on the surface of your back, sinking deep into all the muscles of yourback, relaxing you even more. And now, if you wish, you can go for a walk or arun down the beach. Perhaps you’d like to run on the firm, damp sand or on thesoft, warm sand. Or if you like, you may like to wade into the water and feelits pleasant temperature. Immerse you body in it. Maybe you’d like to swim.Whatever you’d like to do, let yourself do it now….[Pause for fifteen to thirty seconds….][After you have completed your description of your haven, your special place,say:]As you listen to the rest of this tape, imagine yourself spending time in yourhaven, perhaps walking about, exploring it, enjoying it in any way that youwish.[These first few steps should take about five to ten minutes. After you havefinished with these initial steps, read the following affirmation phrases intoyour tape recorder, modifying them to better suit your situation or that of yourchild. Read them slowly and clearly, with a firm feeling of certainty: Read itwith a voice that sounds as though you truly believe it, whether you do or notat this moment in time. Soon you will begin to believe it, and as you believeit, it will happen!]STEP TWO: GIVING YOURSELF POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONSWith each breath in, breathe in warmth and relaxation…and with each breath out,release all the tensions and worries that disrupt life. Say to yourself:“Day by day, I’m feeling better and better in every way. I’m feeling morecontrol in my life. * I have clear goals for my relationships: to develop and nurture kind, caring, loving relationships. * I have clear goals for my work (or school): to do the best I can every day. * I have clear goals for my physical health and mental health: always to do things to keep my body and my mind healthy. * I focus energy every day on accomplishing my goals.I expect to succeed in whatever I do. I am able to see myself succeeding attasks before I start them. In this way, I program myself for success…and I seesuccess. I understand that successful people sometimes make mistakes and havefailures along the way. I do not expect perfection, but I learn from eachmistake.Every day, in every way, I am becoming the best person I can be. I learn fromothers. By learning from others, I expand my horizons on a daily basis.I prepare carefully for each of my tasks and projects. I set myself up to winand I have let go of the old pattern of putting off tasks and thereby setting upfailure. Every day I’m becoming more and more organized…. Organization isbecoming avital part of my nature. I realize that when I put something in itsright place in the beginning, I am more likely to find it when I need it.Every day I am becoming more focused, more alert, more wide awake and morefilled with energy. Every day I’m becoming more interested in what I am doing,in whatever is going on around me, and the people around me. I work smart aswell as hard, focusing my energy on the goals I have set for myself.I am more flexible…more adaptable…more willing and able to change as needed. Atthe same time, I am more disciplined…more thoughtful.My environment matters…. I will seek to be a positive force in my environmenteveryday. I surround myself with positive people, and people who believe in me.Similarly, I am more positive with those around me. I can step outside myselfand understand the feelings of others, and I see things from their perspectiveas well as my own. I am free of fear of competition with others. I feelwonderful when I win; when I do not win, I learn. Competition spurs me on to beas good as I can be.More and more, I accept myself as I am and I accept others as they are…. Iaccept things as they are, not as I think they should be. I compromise when itis necessary. I eliminate the ANTs and bad thoughts whenever they enter my mind.I own me, and I am in control of me…and I live with the inner voices that helpand uplift me. I erase any voice that would try to tear me down. When I findanxiety, I am able to turn it into positive energy for creativity and positivechange.I have let go of the habit of giving up on myself. Instead, I give my besteffort toward reaching the goals I have set for myself…and no matter what…I keeppursuing my fondest dream in my life.[If you’ve decided to put a little more active music on at this time, you may doso.]STEP THREE: VISUALIZING SUCCESSNow visualize yourself in some future situation, perhaps a test or challenge ormeeting that is coming up in the near future. Choose the kind of situation youmight have had trouble with in the past, but this time, as you go through it,visualize yourself applying all the positive beliefs you’ve just repeated toyourself in your mind, and watch yourself being personally successful, no matterwhat the outcome of the situation is. Visualize yourself there, clearly andvividly; see and hear everything that is going on around you, and feel your bodyand your voice responding in the way you really want to…and the way that ishealthy and wise…and see yourself being successful.[Pause for about a minute or two, and then begin to read again.]STEP 4: DEHYPNOTIZING YOURSELFNow, as I count from ten down to zero, gradually feel yourself becoming more andmore awake. Again, leave about three or four seconds between each two numbers.Ten, nine, eight…Feeling yourself coming up, growing more and more awake.Seven, six, five…Feeling alert and full of energy.Four, three…Bringing the feelings of energy and relaxation with you as you come up…filledwith energy and ready to do whatever you want to do next.Two, one, zero.Take a deep breath in. As you let it out, let your eyelids open and think toyourself, wide awake…Feel your body beginning to stretch and move.Now get up and walk around the room, and make sure you’re fully wide awakebefore you do anything else. The total time of the tape will be from fifteen to thirty minutes, depending onthe pace of your voice, images, etc.Now that you have made the tape for yourself or your child, listen to it onceevery day. This is important: The first few times you will find out how yourbody will react to the relaxation. Some people become so relaxed that they dozeoff to sleep for a bit. If that happens to you, great! Listen to the tape beforeyou go to bed, or when you can catch a nap. Some people find that it takes thema while to be fully with it; they remain very relaxed for several minutesafterward, as if they were waking up from sleep. If the tape affects you thatway, you want to make sure that you’re clearly awake before you do anything thatrequires full concentration, like driving a car. Others can listen to the tapeanytime, anywhere, and feel a relaxed energy flow through their bodies.The most important thing is that you listen to your tape every day. You canchange the content of the tape in any way that you think will be beneficial toyou. This is your tape. Use it to strengthen your life.

If you asked myassistant to repeat the most common phrase she hears me say, she would answer,“Dr. Amen says he loves his job.”But there are times that I struggle. And that’s when treatment doesn’twork—when, even through our best efforts, we cannot make a person better.Happily, treatment failures are uncommon in ADD patients when we use brain-basedmedicine, but there are cases.Over the years, we have learned that patients for whom help is elusive usuallyfall into one of a number of recurring patterns: * the wrong diagnosis * the wrong medication or dose of medication * interfering factors * poor follow-through * cutting corners * the unknownHere are some thoughts on each category and suggestions on what to do aboutthem.THE WRONG DIAGNOSISWhen another condition is misdiagnosed as ADD, inappropriate treatment is oftenprescribed. Not only will that be ineffective, but it can often make thingsworse. A classic example is bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is a cyclic mooddisorder, with alternating ups and downs. If patients with bipolar disorder aregiven stimulant medication, it may trigger a manic or “up” episode, putting themat increased risk for psychosis.Other ailments that have been mistaken for ADD include: Asperger’s syndrome—an autistic spectrum disorder characterized by repetitivethoughts, rigid cognitive function, and very poor social skills. Typically,people with Asperger’s syndrome are academically behind and internallydistracted, which makes them look as though they have ADD symptoms.Substance abuse—especially marijuana, excessive alcohol use, use of inhalants,pain killers, etc. Drugs of abuse affect brain function and may cause a personto look hyperactive, restless, impulsive, and distracted. This is especiallytrue for teenagers who start either marijuana or alcohol use. Either theintoxication or withdrawal state of marijuana or alcohol can cause a teenager tolook as though he was inattentive ADD. Making things more confusing, many peoplewith ADD abuse substances, and both problems are frequently present. Thisunderscores the importance of a detailed history. If the ADD symptoms precededthe substance abuse then both are likely present. If there were no ADD symptomsprior to the substance abuse then substance abuse is likely the primary problem.Depression—The numerous cognitive problems caused by depression can bemisinterpreted as ADD. SPECT studies of people with depression show decreasedactivity in the prefrontal cortex, making their brains look as though they haveADD. This can be born out by the symptoms the depressed person exhibits.However, in the non-depressed state there are few or no ADD symptoms. Stimulantsfrequently increase moodiness in people who are depressed. Learning disabilities, personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder,chronic stress, primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea, or other medicalproblems such as thyroid disease, may also be misdiagnosed as ADD, preventingeffective treatment and healing.THE WRONG MEDICATION OR DOSE OF MEDICATIONAnother reason that treatment may not work is the use of the wrong medication orthe wrong dose of medication. As we have seen in this book there are at leastsix distinct types of ADD and one treatment does not fit all. In fact, the mostcommon ADD treatment (Ritalin) makes four of the ADD types worse when usedalone. Proper, targeted medications and/or supplements are essential toeffective treatments.Even when the proper class of medication is used, i.e., a stimulant or ananticonvulsant, one person may respond to one medication while a differentperson needs another. For example, I have seen many patients respond to thestimulant Adderall even though they received no help whatsoever from thestimulant Ritalin. I have seen yet other patients get better from Dexedrine whohad no luck with either Ritalin or Adderall. We have no way of knowing inadvance which medication in a particular class is going to work best for aperson. I suggest trying all the different medications in the appropriate classuntil you get the best response.Another important variable is the particular dose of medication. Many peoplerespond poorly to treatment because their doctors used the wrong dose ofmedication. Typically, doctors prescribe too small a dose. I’ve had many casesof folks who had no success on 10 mg of Adderall a dose, and were deemedtreatment failures without ever trying 15 or 20 mg. Just as the wrongprescription for eyeglasses can make someone’s vision worse, the wrong dose ofmedication can make things worse for an ADD patient. Too much medication is asserious a problem in that it can increase the possibility of side effects andnoncompliance.I have also seen generic medications cause treatment problems and confusion. Inmy experience, generic medication often works differently than the brand-nameversion. Sometimes it works better, often worse. For example, a close friend ofmine with ADD responds very nicely to a specific generic form of Ritalin. Shedoes not respond at all to other generics or brand-name Ritalin. We have donefour trials with different forms of Ritalin with the same results.One factor that few physicians consider is the difference between how women andmen process medication. Due to hormonal factors, women have a higher percentageof body fat than men, which causes certain medications to be more or lessavailable to the brain, necessitating the need for different dosages.INTERFERING FACTORSThere are many independent factors that interfere with effective treatment andincrease the likelihood of failure. Common ones include poor diet, lack ofexercise, taking medication with orange juice or products containing citricacid, excessive stress, ineffective environments (home, work, school), poorrelationships with treatment providers, excessive use of caffeine or nicotine,and taking other medications, especially those not reported to the doctor.The wrong diet frequently interferes with treatment. As we’ve already seen, forType 1 or Type 2 ADD too many carbohydrates causes wide blood sugar fluctuationsand increased symptomotology. Type 3 ADD is usually helped with simplecarbohydrates. Food can be used like medication—it can make things better orworse. It is hard to judge the effectiveness of medication when a child or teeneats nothing but simple carbohydrates, punctuated by high sugar and caffeineloads.A lack of exercise or change in exercise can also make things worse. Intenseaerobic exercise improves blood supply to the brain. Without exercise the doseof medication may need to be higher than it would with a good exercise regimen.Frequently, I have seen ADD children or teens do better when they are playing ahigh-aerobic sport such as basketball. But then they struggle after the seasonis over, and no one knows why the medication does not seem to work as well.Citric acid (found in orange juice, other citrus juices such as grapefruitjuice, lemonade, tomato juice, and in many preservatives) has been found tocause deactivation of some medications and should be avoided near the time ofmedication. Few doctors advise their patients to avoid these substances aroundthe time of taking medication, and thus increase the likelihood of treatmentfailure. You do not have to completely avoid citric acid—just avoid in an hourbefore and after taking medication or supplements.We have also seen that high levels of stress interfere with treatment. Stresscauses an excessive release of corticosteroids from the adrenal glands. Thesestress hormones circulate to the brain and damage brain cells, especially in thetemporal lobes. Chronic stress has a negative effect on cognition and diminishesthe effectiveness of treatment. For example, if an ADD adult is beingsuccessfully treated, but then experiences a significant stress such as a jobloss or divorce, the medication often needs to be adjusted.A problematic or difficult environment (such as at home, work, or school) alsocontributes to treatment failure. You can have the right diagnosis and righttreatment protocol, but if you are in a difficult marriage, have difficultparents or teachers, or have siblings who are abusing you, treatment will appearflawed and frequently fail. The environment needs to support the treatment.A bad or poor relationship with the treatment provider is another common reasonfor failure. Whenever conflicts and miscommunication exists in thedoctor-patient relationship, patients suffer. In the current medical climate,doctors are being pressured to see more patients in less time. As a result, theycan miss important information or ignore the most healing part of medicine—thedoctor-patient relationship. Work hard to find a doctor who is not onlyknowledgeable, but who is also kind and a good communicator.Many will find it surprising that excessive caffeine or nicotine use can inducetreatment failure. Both caffeine and nicotine cause blood flow constriction inthe brain. In the short run, people who have a cup of coffee or a cigarette feelstimulated. In the long run, however, these substances, through the mechanism ofdecreased blood flow, intensify your ADD symptoms. These substances alsodiminish the availability of medication to the brain, requiring patients to takemore than most people. Avoid all nicotine and much caffeine. Caffeine is foundin coffee, tea, dark sodas, chocolate, and a number of medications. Nicotine isfound not only in cigarettes, but also in cigars and chewing tobacco.Over-the-counter medications, supplements, and herbs can also have a negativeeffect on treatment. These substances frequently interfere with treatment,especially when the doctor is unaware that patients are taking them. Thesesubstances may contain caffeine or ephedrine, causing cerebral vasoconstriction.Or, as in the case of St. John’s wort, they may increase serotonin levels in thebrain and effectively decrease dopamine levels, which may help Type 3 ADD, whilemaking other types worse.POOR FOLLOW-THROUGHOne of the most common reasons for ADD treatment failure is poor follow-through.Obtaining effective treatment requires patience and cooperation between doctorand patient. Many people with ADD are driven by the moment. They need things towork right away or they become frustrated, distracted, and do not follow throughwith treatment recommendations. Many medications take time to work, and peopleneed to get adjusted to their positive or negative effects. Stopping or changingtreatment too soon frequently causes failure. Many ADD patients also prematurelyincrease their medication. They reason that if a particular dose of medicationdoesn’t work, they’ll increase it the next time, despite directions from thedoctor to go slowly. Or, they may give up or say uncle” too early. They may trya treatment for a week or two, when some meds take three to eight weeks to befully effective. Persistence is needed for effective treatment.Along the same lines, many patients, despite effective treatment, get tired orirritated by needing treatment and prematurely stop taking medication or workingtheir treatment plan. I warn my patients about this temptation, telling them toexpect that they will want to stop treatment about a year into it. In myexperience, even when patients are dramatically better, they forget what lifewas like before treatment and want to stop.In addition, many people stop effective treatment because of erroneousinformation gotten from well-meaning but misinformed friends, relatives, popularnews media, or Internet chat rooms. The amount of misinformation is larger forADD than any other medical problem. One of the major problems with prematurelystopping effective treatment is that when it is restarted it may not work aswell. I have a patient with ADD who responded very nicely to a combination ofmedication and dietary changes. After two years of benefit someone at her churchtold her that she heard negative information about her medication in an Internetchat room. She stopped her medication and became symptomatic as before. When shereinstituted treatment it did not work as before and it took us nearly anotheryear to help her feel more balanced.CUTTING CORNERSBeing too cost-conscious in getting the right help costs people more money inthe long run than getting the best help up front. Many patients do not thinkabout getting the best help they can. They try to save money in the wrongplaces. They just see the doctors on their insurance plan, even when thosedoctors are not properly trained or do not specialize in treating theirparticular problem. Being penny wise and dollar foolish can cause real troublein ADD treatment. I have seen many, many patients who were told erroneousinformation by the pediatrician or family practice doctor, promulgating ADDmyths, such as not taking medication in the afternoons or on weekends. Think offinding the best help available as an investment in your child or yourself. Hereare a number of other areas where people try to cut costs that sabotagetreatment: * using generic medication to avoid the cost or insurance copay of the brand-name medication. Sometimes brand-name medication works much better than generic medication. It is usually worth trying both * trying to stretch medication by taking less than the prescribed amount to make it last longer * not keeping regular appointments with the doctor thinking that will save money, not realizing ineffective monitoring will decrease a treatment’s effectiveness * not following through with adjunct therapies, such as family or marital counseling, to save money, not realizing that attorneys for divorce litigation or getting a child out of legal trouble costs much more than effective treatmentTHE UNKNOWNThere is still a lot that we do not know. As different as psychiatry looks nowfrom the seventeenth century days of asylums and suspected demonic possession,will be how different psychiatry will look in a hundred years. In the past weblamed autism, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and ADD on poormothering, bad character structure, or having sin in your life. Thankfully,those days are mostly gone. In the next 100 years there will be many newdiscoveries that will enable us to help many more people. Clearly, we do nothave all the answers, and as we learn more we will be able to help more and morepeople."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29HOW TO FIND THE BEST HELPA Resource GuideFour questions that I am frequently asked are: When is it time to see aprofessional about ADD? What to do when a loved one with ADD is in denial aboutneeding help? How do I go about finding a competent professional? When do youorder a SPECT study? This chapter will attempt to answer these questions.WHEN IS IT TIME TO SEE A PROFESSIONAL ABOUT ADD?This question is relatively easy to answer. I recommend people seek professionalhelp for ADD for themselves or their child when their behaviors, feelings, orthoughts interfere with their ability to reach their potential in the world,whether in their relationships, in their work, or within themselves. If you seepersistent relationship struggles (parent-child, sibling, friends, romantic),it’s time to get help. If you see persistent school or work problems, it is timeto get professional help. If you see continued monetary problems, it’s time toget help. Many people have told me they cannot afford to get professional help.I respond that it is much more costly to live with untreated ADD than it is toget appropriate help. If you see persistent self-esteem problems, or mood oranxiety problems, it’s time to seek help. In my experience, if ADD remainsuntreated past the age of 9 years old, there is a very high chance ofself-esteem and mood problems.GAINING ACCESS TO YOUR OWN GOOD BRAINThe internal problems associated with ADD can ruin lives, relationships, andcareers. It is essential to seek help when necessary. It is also critical forpeople not to be too proud to get help. Pride often devastates relationships,careers, and even life itself. Too many people feel they are somehow “less thanothers” if they seek help. I often tell my patients that, in my experience, itis the successful people who seek help when they need it. Successfulbusinesspeople hire the best possible outside consultants when they are facedwith a problem that they cannot solve or when they need extra help. Unsuccessfulpeople tend to deny they have problems, bury their heads in the sand, and blameothers for their problems. If the ADD symptoms are sabotaging your chances forsuccess in relationships, work, or within yourself, get help. Don’t feelashamed: Feel as though you’re being good to yourself.In thinking about getting help, it is important to put ADD in perspective.First, I have patients get rid of the concept of “normal versus not normal.”“What is normal anyway,” I ask. I tell my patients who worry that they are notnormal: “Normal” is the setting on a dryer. Or that Normal is a city inIllinois. Actually, I spoke in Normal, Illinois, at a major university severalyears ago. I got to meet Normal people, shop at the Normal grocery store, seethe Normal police department and fire department, and even be interviewed on theNormal radio station. I met Normal women. They were a very nice group, butreally not much different from those folks in California. The Normal peopleseemed to have their share of ADD—which is why I was asked to speak.I tell my patients about a study published in 1994, sponsored by the NationalInstitutes of Health, in which researchers reported that 49 percent of the U.S.population suffer from a psychiatric illness at some point in their lives.Anxiety, substance abuse, and depression were the three most common illnesses.At first I thought this statistic was too high. Then I made a list of twentypeople I knew (not from my practice). Eleven were taking medication or intherapy. Half of us at some point in our lives will have problems. It’s just asnormal to have problems as to not have problems. Again, it is the moresuccessful people that will get help first. The same study reported that 29percent of the population will have two separate, distinct psychiatric diagnosesand 17 percent of us will have three different psychiatric diagnoses. In myexperience, very few people are completely without these problems. In fact, indoing research, one of the most difficult challenges is finding a “normal”control group.One of the most persuasive statements I give patients about seeking help is thatI am often able to help them have more access to their own good brains. Whentheir brains do not work efficiently, they are not efficient. When their brainswork right, they can work right. I often will show them a number of brain SPECTstudies to show them the difference on and off medication or targetedpsychotherapy, as a way to help them understand the concept. As you can imagineafter looking at the images in this book, when you see an underactive brainversus one that is healthy, you want the one that is healthy.WHAT TO DO WHEN A LOVED ONE IS IN DENIAL ABOUT NEEDING HELPUnfortunately, the stigma associated with ADD or “psychiatric illness” preventsmany people from getting help. People do not want to be seen as crazy, stupid,or defective. They often do not seek help until they (or their loved one) can nolonger tolerate the pain (at work, in their relationships, or withinthemselves). Men are especially affected by denial.Many men, when faced with obvious problems in their marriages, their children,or even themselves, refuse to see the reality of what’s going on. Their lack ofawareness and strong tendency toward denial prevent them from seeking help untilmore damage has been done than necessary. Many men are threatened with divorcebefore they seek help. Often, with ADD, many men had been diagnosed as childrenwith hyperactivity and had been on medication. They hated feeling different fromthe other kids and resented taking medication, even if it was helpful for them.Some people may say it is unfair for me to pick on men. And indeed, some men seeproblems long before some women. Overall, however, mothers see problems inchildren before fathers and are more willing to seek help, and many more wivescall for marital counseling than husbands. What is it in our society that causesmen to overlook obvious problems, to deny problems until it is too late to dealwith them effectively or until significant damage occurs? Some of the answersmay be found in how boys are raised in our society, the societal expectations weplace on men, and the overwhelming pace of many men’s daily lives.Boys most often engage in active play (sports, war games, video games, etc.)that involves little dialogue or communication. The games often involvedominance and submissiveness, winning and losing, and little interpersonalcommunication. Force, strength, or skill handles problems. Girls, on the otherhand, often engage in more interpersonal or communicative types of play, such asdolls and storytelling. Fathers often take their sons out to throw the ballaround or shoot hoops, rather than to go for a walk and talk.Many men retain the childhood notions of competition and that one must be betterthan others to be any good at all. To admit to a problem is to be less thanother men. As a result, many men wait to seek help until their problems areobvious to the whole world. Other men feel totally responsible for all thathappens in their families and admitting to problems is to admit that they havein some way failed.Clearly, the pace of life prevents some men from being able to take the time tolook clearly at the important people in their lives and their relationships withthem. When I spend time with fathers and husbands and help them slow down enoughto see what is really important to them, more often than not they begin to seethe problems and work toward more helpful solutions. The issue is not one ofbeing uncaring or uninterested: It is not seeing what is there.Many teenagers also resist getting help, even when faced with obvious problems.They worry about labels and do not want yet another adult judging theirbehavior.Here are several suggestions to help people who are unaware or unwilling to getthe help they need: 1. Try the straightforward approach first (but with a new brain twist). Clearly tell the person what behaviors concern you. Tell them the problems may be due to underlying brain patterns that can be tuned up. Tell them help may be available—help not to cure a defect but rather help to optimize how their brain functions. Tell them you know they are trying to do their best, but their behavior, thoughts, or feelings may be getting in the way of their success (at work, in relationships, or within themselves). Emphasize access, not defect. 2. Give them information. Books, videos, and articles on the subjects you are concerned about can be of tremendous help. Many people come to see me because they read a book of mine, saw a video I produced, or read an article I wrote. Good information can be very persuasive, especially if it presented in a positive, life-enhancing way. 3. When a person remains resistant to help, even after you have been straightforward and given them good information, plant seeds. Plant ideas about getting help and then water them regularly. Drop an idea, article, or other information about the topic from time to time. If you talk too much about getting help, people become resentful and won’t get help to spite you. Be careful not to go overboard. 4. Protect your relationship with the other person. People are more receptive to people they trust rather than to people who nag and belittle them. I do not let anyone tell me something bad about myself unless I trust the other person. Work on gaining the person’s trust over the long run. It will make them more receptive to your suggestions. Do not make getting help the only thing that you talk about. Make sure you are interested in their whole lives, not just their potential medical appointments. 5. Give them new hope. Many people with these problems have tried to get help, and it did not work or it even made them worse. Educate them on new brain technology that helps professionals be more focused and more effective in treatment efforts. 6. There comes a time when you have to say enough is enough. If, over time, the other person refuses to get help, and his or her behavior has a negative impact on your life, you may have to separate yourself. Staying in a toxic relationship is harmful to your health. Staying in a toxic relationship often enables the other person to remain sick. Actually, I have seen the threat or act of leaving motivate people to change, whether it is about drinking, drug use, or treating ADD. Threatening to leave is not the first approach I would take, but after time it may be the best approach. 7. Realize you cannot force a person into treatment unless they are dangerous to themselves, dangerous to others, or unable to care for themselves. You can only do what you can do. Fortunately, today there is a lot more we can do than we could have done only ten years ago.FINDING A COMPETENT PROFESSIONAL WHO USES THIS NEW BRAIN SCIENCE THINKINGAt this point, I must get forty to fifty calls, faxes, or e-mails a week frompeople all over the world looking for competent professionals in their areas whothink in ways similar to myself and the principles outlined in this book.Because the principles in this book are still on the edge of what is new inbrain science, these professionals may be hard to find. Still, finding the rightprofessional for evaluation and treatment is critical to the healing process.The right professional can have a very positive impact on your life. The wrongprofessional can make things worse. There are number of steps to take in findingthe best person to assist you: * Get the best person you can find. Saving money up front may cost you in the long run. The right help is not only cost-effective but saves unnecessary pain and suffering. Don’t just rely on a person who is on your managed-care plan. That person may or may not be a good fit for you. Search for the best. If he or she is on your insurance plan, great. But don’t let that be the primary criterion. * Use a specialist. ADD diagnosis and treatment is expanding at a rapid pace. Specialists keep up with the details in their fields, while generalists (family physicians) have to try to keep up with everything. If I had a heart arrhythmia, I would see a cardiologist rather than a general internist. I want someone to treat me who has seen hundreds or even thousands of cases like mine. * Get information about referral sources from people who know about your problem. Sometimes well-meaning people give very bad information. I have known many physicians and teachers who make light of ADD and discourage people from getting help. The following is a quote from a family physician to one of my patients: “Oh, ADD is a fad. You don’t need help. Just try harder.” In searching for help, contact people who are likely to give you good information about subjects such as child psychiatrists, CHADD coordinators, and Internet ADD medical support groups, such as the one on Prodigy. Often support groups have members who have visited the professionals in the area, and they can give you important information about subjects such as bedside manner, competence, responsiveness, and organization. * Once you get the names of competent professionals, check their credentials. Very few patients ever check a professional’s background. Board certification is a key credential. To become board certified, physicians have to pass additional written and verbal tests. They have to discipline themselves to gain the skill and knowledge that is acceptable to their colleagues. Don’t give too much weight to the medical school or graduate school the professional attended. I have worked with some doctors who went to Yale and Harvard who did not have a clue about how to treat patients appropriately, while other doctors from less prestigious schools were outstanding, forward-thinking, and caring. * Set up an interview with the professional to see whether or not you want to work with him or her. Generally you have to pay for their time, but it is worth spending time getting to know the people you will rely on for help. * Read the professional’s work or hear the professional if possible. Many professionals write articles or books or speak at meetings or local groups. If possible, read their writings or hear them speak to get a feel for the kind of person they are and their ability to help you. * Look for a person who is open-minded, up-to-date, and willing to try new things. * Look for a person who treats you with respect, who listens to your questions and responds to your needs. Look for a relationship that is collaborative and respectful.I know it is hard to find a professional who meets all of these criteria whoalso has the right training in brain physiology, but these people can be found.Be persistent. The caregiver is essential to healing.WHEN TO ORDER A SPECT STUDY; QUESTIONS ABOUT SPECTI order SPECT studies for very specific reasons. Because of our very largedatabase, I actually order fewer studies now than I did several years ago. Ourextensive SPECT work has allowed me to be better at picking out brain patterns,clinically, that are responsive to certain treatments. Here are several commonquestions and answers about SPECT: Will the SPECT study give me an accurate diagnosis? No. A SPECT study by itselfwill not give a diagnosis. SPECT studies help the clinician understand moreabout the specific function of your brain. Each person’s brain is unique, whichmay lead to unique responses to medicine or therapy. Diagnoses about specificconditions are made through a combination of clinical history, personalinterview, information from families, diagnostic checklists, SPECT studies andother neuropsychological tests. No study is “a doctor in a box” that can giveaccurate diagnoses on individual patients. Why are SPECT studies ordered? Some of the common reasons include: * evaluation of seizure activity * evaluation of blood-vessel diseases, such as stroke * evaluation of dementia and distinction between dementia and pseudodementia (depression that looks like dementia) * evaluation of the effects of mild, moderate, and severe head trauma * suspicion of underlying organic brain condition, such as seizure activity contributing to behavioral disturbance; prenatal trauma; or exposure to toxins * evaluation of atypical or unresponsive aggressive behavior * determination of the extent of brain impairment caused by the drug or alcohol abuse * typing of ADD when clinical presentation is not clear.Do I need to be off medication before the study? This question must be answeredindividually between you and your doctor. In general, it is better to be offmedications until they are out of your system, but this is not always practicalor advisable. If the study is done while on medication, let the technician knowso that when the physician reads the study, he or she will include thatinformation in the interpretation of the scan. In general, we recommend thatpatients try to be off stimulants at least four days before the first scan andremain off of them until after the second scan, if one is ordered. Medicationssuch as Prozac (which stays in the body for four to six weeks) are generally notstopped because of practicality. Check with your doctor for recommendations. What should I do the day of the scan? On the day of the scan, decrease oreliminate your caffeine intake and try to not take cold medication or aspirin.(If you do please write it down on the intake form.) Eat as you normally would. Are there any side effects or risks to the study? The study does not involve adye and people do not have allergic reactions to the study. The possibilityexists, although in a very small percentage of patients, that a mild rash,facial redness and edema, fever, and/or a transient increase in blood pressuremay result. The amount of radiation exposure from one brain SPECT study isapproximately the same as one abdominal X ray. How is the SPECT procedure done? The patient is placed in a quiet room and asmall intravenous (IV) line is started. The patient remains quiet forapproximately ten minutes with his or her eyes open to allow his or her mentalstate to equilibrate to the environment. The imaging agent is then injectedthrough the IV. After another short period of time, the patient lies on a tableand the SPECT camera rotates around his or her head. (The patient does not gointo a tube.) The time on the table is approximately fifteen minutes. If aconcentration study is ordered, the patient returns on another day. Are there alternatives to having a SPECT study? In my opinion, SPECT is the mostclinically useful study of brain function. There are other studies, such asquantitative electroencephalograms (QEEGs), Positron Emission Tomography (PET)studies, and functional MRIs (fMRI). PET studies and fMRI are considerably morecostly and they are performed mostly in research settings. QEEGs, in ouropinion, do not provide enough information about the deep structures of thebrain to be as helpful as SPECT studies. Does insurance cover the cost of SPECT studies? Reimbursement by insurancecompanies varies according to the kind of plan. It is often a good idea to checkwith the insurance company ahead of time to see if it is a covered benefit inyour case. Is the use of brain SPECT imaging accepted in the medical community? Brain SPECTstudies are widely recognized as an effective tool for evaluating brain functionin seizures, strokes, dementia, and head trauma. There are literally hundreds ofresearch articles on these topics. In The Amen Clinic, based on our experienceover ten years, we have developed this technology further to evaluate aggressionand nonresponsive psychiatric conditions. Unfortunately, many physicians do notfully understand the application of SPECT imaging and may tell you that thetechnology is experimental, but over 350 physicians in the United States havereferred patients to us for scans.SPECT RESOURCESThere are no centers like ours around the country. But there are manyforward-thinking physicians and psychotherapists that understand the connectionbetween the brain and behavior. Here is a list of physicians andpsychotherapists across the country I refer to who are expert in diagnosing andtreating Attention Deficit Disorder and understand the model I use based onbrain SPECT imaging.PhysiciansALASKAWilliam Larson, M.D.7227 Bern St., Anchorage, AK 99507(907) 344-2700Practice limited to ADD in children and adultsARKANSASWilliam Collie, M.D.2311 Biscayne Dr. #201, Little Rock, AR 72227(501) 219-2300Behavioral medicine and researcherARIZONAEric Greenman, M.D.932 West Chandler Blvd., Chandler, AZ 85225(480) 786-9000, Fax (480) 786-5190Child, adolescent, and adult psychiatry—AACAPCALIFORNIADennis Alters, M.D.2125 El Camino Real, Suite 104, Oceanside, CA 92054(760) 967-5898Child, adolescent, and adult psychiatristAuthor of Wizard’s Way Frank Annis, M.D.288 Quinn Hill Ave., Los Altos, CA 94024(650) 949-4244Psychiatrist/specialty in adult ADD Thomas Brod, M.D.12304 Santa Monica Blvd. #210 Los Angeles, CA 90025(310) 207-3337Psychiatrist; sees older teens and Adults; board certified, assistantclinical professor at UCLA Timmen Cermak, M.D. 45 Miller Ave., Suite 1, Mill Valley, CA 94941(415) 346-4460PsychiatristNancy Cheney, M.D.1014 San Juan Ave., Exeter, CA 93221(559) 592-7300Pediatrician Steven Clark, M.D.150 Tejas Place, Nipomo, CA 93444(805) 474-8450Family physician with a specialty in ADD and related disorders Kirk Clopton, Ph.D., M.D.Golden Hills Psychiatry, 1037 Sunset #100, El Dorado Hills,CA 95762(916) 939-2343Child, adolescent, and adult psychiatry George Delgado, M.D., SAAFP2012 Columbus Pkwy, Benicia, CA 94510(707) 745-2705Board certified family practice, special interest in child and adultpsychiatry, depression, ADHD, and Bipolar disorder Claire Friend, M.D.1672 West Ave. J.
