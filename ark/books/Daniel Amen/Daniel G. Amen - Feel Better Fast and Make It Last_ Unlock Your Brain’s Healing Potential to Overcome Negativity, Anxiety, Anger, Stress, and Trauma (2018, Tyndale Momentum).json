APPROACH--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.ATTRIBUTED TO ARISTOTLE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Virtually all of us have felt anxious, depressed, traumatized, grief-stricken,or hopeless at some point in life. It’s perfectly normal to go through hardtimes or experience periods when we feel panicked or out of sorts, whether wehave a diagnosable condition or not. How we respond to these challenges makesall the difference in how we feel —not just immediately, but in the long run.All of us want to stop the pain quickly. Unfortunately, many peopleself-medicate with energy drinks, overeating, alcohol, drugs, risky sexualbehavior, angry outbursts, or wasting time on mindless TV, video games, socialmedia, or shopping. Although these substances and behaviors may give ustemporary relief from feeling bad, they usually only prolong and exacerbate theproblems —or cause other more serious ones, such as energy crashes, obesity,addictions, sexually transmitted diseases, unhappiness, relationship problems,or financial ruin.I am a psychiatrist, a brain-imaging researcher, and the founder of AmenClinics, which has one of the highest published success rates in treating peoplewith complex and treatment-resistant mental health issues such as attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and mood disorders, posttraumaticstress disorder, and more. Thanks to all of this experience, I understand howcritical it is for you to know what will help you feel better right now andlater. In this book I’ll be highlighting strategies that will lead you toexperience more joy, peace, energy, and resilience, both immediately and in thefuture.Plenty of things may help in the short term but will make you feel worse —orcause more problems —in the long term. Here are two stories that illustrate howthe right remedies can set you on a healthier, happier course.CHRIS: HELP FOR A GRIEVING MOMI met Chris at my Northern California clinic when I was there giving a lecture.She told me that two years earlier she had lost her 12-year-old daughter,Sammie, to bone cancer. Chris had no idea how hard Sammie’s death would hit her.Every night she went to bed with Sammie’s illness and death playing over andover in her mind. Chris ate more and drank alcohol as a way to cope and quiether mind, but most mornings she woke up in a panic, and the terror would followher through her days. She felt so useless and depressed that she had secretlyplanned on killing herself on the two-year anniversary of Sammie’s death.Just a few weeks before the anniversary, Chris was visiting with a friend of hersister’s, whom she described as very fit, with a positive attitude. Chris, whois just five feet one inch tall, weighed a little more than 200 pounds and waswalking in a gloom so heavy she thought she’d never smile —and mean it —again.“This friend had a copy of the Change Your Brain, Change Your Body DailyJournal,” Chris explained. “Flipping through it, I thought, Okay, I like this.It makes sense to me. I have to start looking for the brighter side of life.After all, my choices at that point were to take my life, drink myself to death,or end up in rehab. And I was way too proud to go to rehab.” Chris went home anddownloaded my book Change Your Brain, Change Your Body and read it cover tocover in one night. “I can still remember how I felt in the moment when I read. . . that alcohol stops you from feeling ‘empathy and compassion for others.’ Iknew I needed to get my feelings of empathy and compassion back for my otherchildren and husband. I needed to find a way to be happy and whole again fortheir sakes and my own.“I went hard-core into the plan,” Chris said. “In fact, I did a 28-day cleanse.I tossed out all the alcohol, ate no processed food, and began taking fish oiland vitamin D.” Chris felt better nearly immediately. “Within eight days Ididn’t care if I never dropped a pound again. I was free! Because I was eatingfood that actually nourished my cells, the food and alcohol cravings stopped. Igot rid of all the diet drinks and colas. I slept through the night for thefirst time in four years, and I didn’t wake up in a panic.” After 10 weeks shehad lost 24 pounds and was running four days a week. After five months she wasdown 35 pounds and had lost eight inches off her waist. Her skin was brighter,and she felt like a completely new woman. Of course she will never forget herdaughter, but there is no way that Sammie would have wanted her mother to be insuch pain. Now Chris believes that Sammie would be proud of her.The best time to start healing from a crisis is before it starts. Givingyourself the excuse to eat bad food, drink alcohol, or smoke pot to deal withthe pain only prolongs it. Never let a crisis be your excuse to hurt yourself.If you’re like me, when you hurt, you want to feel better now, fast, pronto!During my psychiatric training I had a wonderful supervisor, Dr. Jack McDermott,who was a world leader in psychiatry. I loved his mentorship on how to helpchildren, teens, adults, and families who were hurting. In his professionalevaluation of me at the end of the year, he wrote, “Dr. Amen is a bright,competent, and caring physician, who will make a wonderful psychiatrist; but heneeds to be more patient. He wants people to get better fast.” Then and now, Idon’t see wanting people to get better quickly as a problem. That is what peoplewho are in pain want. No one wants to be patient. No one wants a prolongedprocess. They want to feel better fast, and they want that feeling to last.LEIZA: REVERSING DEPRESSION AND MEMORY PROBLEMSLeiza, an attractive woman with flaming red hair, was 50 years old when shefirst came to our Atlanta clinic. She had seen one of my public televisionprograms and brought her teenage son to us for ADHD because he had not respondedto treatment. She also decided to be scanned because, as she said, “I’m veryscattered, always late, and my memory is poor. . . . My father and his motherhad dementia, and I don’t want it. . . . I really feel like I am in the earlystages of dementia. . . . I am tired of being depressed and beating myself up.”She had been an actor and then a stay-at-home mother for 20 years. As herchildren were becoming more independent, she wanted to act again, but she didn’tbelieve she could. She told one of her friends, “I could never go back to work.I can’t remember anything. I can’t focus. I can’t make any decisions.”The two years before Leiza came to see us were the most challenging in her life.She had felt a lot of anxiety while taking care of her son’s learningdisabilities, her daughter’s depression, and her father’s dementia, and indealing with the death of her mother-in-law. With the chronic stress, Leizanoticed more problems with her memory. She would make appointments and thenforget to show up, despite having put the appointment on her calendar. Sixmonths before her appointment with us, she was diagnosed with ADHD and put onAdderall, but she didn’t think it helped her.As part of our workup of Leiza, we did a brain imaging study called SPECT(single photon emission computed tomography), which looks at blood flow andactivity —essentially, how the brain works. Her SPECT scan showed severedecreased blood flow across her whole brain, which was very concerning given thefamily history of Alzheimer’s disease. Our research, and that of others, hasshown that Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia start in the braindecades before people have any symptoms. Leiza was already symptomatic, and herbrain showed that she was headed for the same fate as her father andgrandmother.Leiza’s scan was the wake-up call she needed to get serious about rehabilitatingher brain now if she wanted to feel better fast and avoid eventually being aburden to her children. She was motivated to do everything we recommended,including taking supplements and doing a treatment called hyperbaric oxygentherapy (HBOT; see appendix A, page 292 [appendix_1.xhtml#page_292]), whichboosts blood flow to the brain. Within several months she noticed significantimprovement in her mood, focus, and memory. She started to audition fortelevision and landed a lead role in a TV pilot as the FBI director. She told menone of it would have been possible without rehabilitating and caring for herbrain. Her follow-up scan two years later showed remarkable improvement, whichis something we have seen repeatedly over the past three decades. Your brain canbe better and you can feel better —and we can prove it!HOW TO READ SPECT SCANSThroughout this book you’ll see a number of SPECT scans from Amen Clinicspatients.We will include four images; they show the brain first from underneath and then,moving clockwise, from the right side, the top, and the left side. For detailedinformation about how the SPECT scan works and who should get one, see “WhenShould You Think about Getting a Functional Imaging Study, Such as SPECT?” onpage 271 [chapter_11.xhtml#page_271].HEALTHY SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing uniform blood flow.[images/Illustration-0Intro.1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityLEIZA’S SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-0Intro.2.jpg]Holes indicate areas of severe decreased blood flow.LEIZA’S AFTER TREATMENT SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing uniform blood flow.[images/Illustration-0Intro.3.jpg]Marked overall improvementTHE MISSING STRATEGY TO FEELING BETTER FASTOne of the most important secrets to our success at Amen Clinics is that wefocus first on understanding, healing, and optimizing the physical functioningof the brain (hardware), and second on properly programming it (software). Bothalways work together, and if you ignore one while only working on the other, youwill have a harder time consistently feeling better.Unfortunately, the vast majority of professionals who are trained to help peoplewho are struggling with how they feel receive little to no training on how toheal and optimize the brain, which limits their success. I recently lectured to5,000 mental health professionals and asked them how many had received anytraining on how to optimize the physical functioning of the brain during theireducation; fewer than one percent raised their hands.Physicians have been trying to drug the brain into submission since the 1950s.The outcomes have been poor because doctors too often ignore the necessity offirst putting the brain into a healing environment by addressing issues such assleep, toxins, diet, exercise, and supplementation. Dr. Thomas Insel, formerdirector of the National Institute of Mental Health, wrote, “The unfortunatereality is that current medications help too few people to get better and veryfew people to get well.”[1] In contrast with antibiotics, which can cureinfections, none of the medications for the mind cure anything. They onlyprovide a temporary bandage that comes off when the psychotropic medications arestopped, causing symptoms to recur. In addition, many of these medications areinsidious; once you start on them, they change your brain chemistry so you needthem in order to feel normal. There is a better way. Feel Better Fast and MakeIt Last is the manual that helps you unlock your brain’s healing potential toquickly overcome negativity, anxiety, anger, stress, grief, and trauma.Honestly, I, too, undervalued brain health for nearly a decade as a youngpsychiatrist until our group at Amen Clinics found a practical way to look atthe brain. Before we started our brain imaging work in 1991, I had been trainedand board-certified as a child-and-adolescent psychiatrist and generalpsychiatrist and was busy seeing children, teens, adults, and older adults witha wide variety of issues connected with mental health, including depression,bipolar disorder, autism, violence, marital conflict, school failure, and ADHD.During that time, I was flying blind and not thinking much about the actualphysical functioning of my patients’ brains. Researchers at academic centerstold us that brain imaging tools were not ready for clinical practice —maybesomeday in the future.I loved being a psychiatrist, but I knew we were missing important puzzlepieces. Psychiatry was, and unfortunately remains, a soft, ambiguous science,with many competing theories about what causes the troubles our patientsexperience. In medical school and during my psychiatric residency andchild-and-adolescent psychiatry fellowship, I was taught that while we reallydidn’t know what caused psychiatric illnesses, they were likely the result of acombination of factors, including * Genetics —but no one knew exactly which genes were the real troublemakers; * Abnormal brain chemistry —which gave us many medications to try, but they only worked some of the time; * Toxic parenting or painful childhood experiences —but some people thrived even though they were raised in abusive environments, while others withered; * Negative thinking patterns —but correcting the erroneous thought patterns helped some people and not others.The lack of neuroimaging led to a “brainless” psychiatry, which kept myprofession steeped in outdated theories and perpetuated stigma for our patients.I often wondered why all other medical specialists looked at the organs theytreated —cardiologists, for example, scanned the heart, gastroenterologistsscoped the gut, and orthopedists imaged bones and joints —while psychiatristswere expected to guess at what was wrong by talking to patients. And we weredealing with the most complicated organ of all —the human brain! Our patientsare every bit as sick as those with heart disease, osteoporosis, or cancer.Depression, bipolar disorder, addictions, and schizophrenia are all potentiallylethal disorders, and even issues such as chronic stress, anxiety, and ADHD canaffect all aspects of our lives.IMAGING CHANGED EVERYTHINGIn 1991, everything changed for me. My lack of respect for the brain vanishedalmost instantly when I started looking at the brains of my patients with anuclear medicine study called SPECT, mentioned in Leiza’s story on page xvi[introduction.xhtml#page_xvi]. It is different from CT or MRI scans, which lookat the brain’s anatomy or structure. SPECT looks at brain function, which ishelpful because functional problems almost always precede structural problems.SPECT is a leading indicator of trouble, pointing to issues years before theymanifest, while CT and MRI are lagging indicators of trouble that revealabnormalities later in illnesses. SPECT basically answers a key question abouteach area of the brain: Is it healthy, underactive, or overactive? Based on whatwe see, we can stimulate the underactive areas or calm the overactive ones withsupplements, medicines, electrical therapies, or other treatments, all of whichoptimize the brain. We can also help patients ensure that the healthy areas oftheir brains stay healthy.Almost immediately after starting to look at scans, I became excited about thepossibilities of SPECT to help my patients, my family, and myself. The scanshelped me be a better doctor, as I could observe the brain function of mypatients. I could see if their brains were healthy, which meant the issues theywere facing were more likely to be psychological, social, or spiritual ratherthan biological in nature. I could see if there was physical trauma fromconcussions or head injuries, causing trouble to specific areas of the brain, orif there was evidence of toxic exposure from drug or alcohol abuse (addictsrarely admit to how much they are using, but it is hard to stay in denial whenlooking at a damaged brain) or other toxins, such as mercury, lead, or mold. Ialso could see if my patients’ brains worked too hard, which is associated withanxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive tendencies.I was so excited about imaging that I scanned many people in my own family,including my 60-year-old mother, who had one of the healthiest SPECT scans I hadseen. Her scan reflected her life. As a mother of seven children and grandmotherand great-grandmother of 44, she has always been everyone’s best friend. At thetime of this writing, she has been married to my father for 68 years, and she isconsistently loving, attached, focused, and successful in every way, includingbeing the club golf champion and a top golfer for more than 50 years. Afterscanning my mom, I scanned myself, and my results were not so good. I had playedfootball in high school and gotten sick with meningitis as a young soldier, plusI had a lot of bad brain habits, such as not sleeping more than four hours anight, struggling with being overweight, eating junk food, and being chronicallystressed at home and at work. Seeing my mom’s scan and then my own, I fell inlove with my brain and vowed to make it better. I also developed what I callbrain envy. I come from a very competitive family and was highly irritated thatmy 60-year-old mother had a better-looking brain than I did at 37. Much of mylife after that moment has been about making my brain better and teaching otherswhat I learned about how to do it. When my brain was rescanned 20 years later,it was much healthier.Now, close to 30 years after we started to look at the brain at Amen Clinics, wehave built the world’s largest database of nearly 150,000 brain SPECT scans onpatients from 120 countries. Our work has clearly taught us that unhealthy brainfunction is associated with a higher incidence of * Sadness * Anxiety * Fear * Panic * Brain fog * Poor focus * Addictions * Domestic violence * Incarceration * Loneliness * Suicidal behaviors * Violence * School failure * Divorce * DementiaBy contrast, healthy brain function is correlated with improved * Happiness * Joy * Energy * Resilience * Focus * Longevity * Relationships * School performance * Business success * Wealth management * CreativityThis is what feeling better looks like. As your brain becomes healthier, youwill experience fewer of the problems on the first list and more of the rewardson the second. And as these positive personal characteristics take hold, you’llexperience constructive changes in your attitude, your ability to respond tochallenges, and your sense of purpose.THE BRAIN-XL APPROACHUsing the mnemonic, or memory aid, BRAIN-XL as our framework, I’ll introduce youto the latest research, as well as our clinical experience, to help you feelbetter fast and make it last. First, I want to acquaint you with the fouraspects of health, which I often share with my patients: biological,psychological, social, and spiritual. They all work together, and we need to beaware of each one as we take steps to feel better. If there’s a root biologicalcause for our problems, such as a genetic inheritance or the lasting effects ofa head injury, we need to deal with that first. But we also need to be aware ofpsychological aspects, like negative thought patterns or an early childhoodtrauma, as well as the way our social interactions and connections can affectus. And finally, our health can have a spiritual component. When we have astrong sense of purpose —of living for something larger than ourselves —we findinspiration that can go a long way to helping us feel better. As we work throughthe BRAIN-XL acronym, we’ll touch on all of these areas.I chose BRAIN-XL because improving your brain health is the core strategy of theprogram, and XL has many terrific meanings, including excel, extra large, extraload, extended life, and extra love. Of course, no one feels joyful all thetime, but with an understanding of how your physical brain, mental processes,social attachments, and spiritual connection work and some strategies that willenhance their functioning, you are more likely to love your life and feel betterevery day. Here is what BRAIN-XL stands for:B IS FOR BRAINChapter 1: Use Your Brain to Rescue Your Mind and Body. Whenever you feel sad,mad, nervous, or out of control, it is critical to have emotional-rescuetechniques. This chapter will introduce you to six powerful practices to helpyou feel better fast.Chapter 2: The Missing Strategy. The secret to feeling better fast now and for alifetime is to immediately work on optimizing the physical functioning of yourbrain. This chapter summarizes my latest thinking on how to help you have thebest brain possible, as quickly as possible.Chapter 3: Control Yourself. Are you impulsive, distracted, and disorganized. . . or thoughtful, focused, and organized? The part of your brain thatdetermines which of these descriptions fits you is the prefrontal cortex, orPFC, in the front third of your brain. Neuroscientists call it the “executive”part of the brain because it acts like your own internal chief executive officeror boss. This chapter will help you strengthen your PFC to make great decisionsand avoid ones that can ruin your life.Chapter 4: Change Is Easy —If You Know How to Do It. Your brain likes to do whatit has always done, even when that is not in your best interest. Getting stuckin unhelpful behaviors, holding grudges, and engaging in unproductive worryingall cause immense suffering. There is an area deep in the frontal lobes calledthe anterior cingulate gyrus, the brain’s gear shifter, which allows you to movefrom thought to thought or idea to idea. When this part of the brain is healthy,you are flexible and adaptable, and you can easily shift your attention andlearn from your mistakes. When it is overactive, you can get stuck on negativethoughts (obsessions) or behaviors (addictions), say no even when saying yes maybe good for you, and notice what is wrong a lot more often than you notice whatis right. This chapter will help you optimize this part of the brain to turnyour ruts into superhighways of success.R IS FOR RATIONAL MINDChapter 5: Master Your Rational Mind. Once the physical functioning of yourbrain is healthy, it is critical to know how to strengthen your rational mind.This chapter will help you develop the mental discipline necessary for feelingbetter fast, including eliminating the ANTs (automatic negative thoughts),quieting your mind, focusing on gratitude, and even welcoming failure.A IS FOR ATTACHMENTSChapter 6: Healing Connections. Our attachments bring us the greatest joys andthe most painful sorrows. When relationships are stressed or break apart, peoplebecome unhappy and vulnerable to acting in counterproductive ways. In a computeranalogy, social attachments are like network connections. The way the brain isfunctioning is often the missing piece in understanding healthy or difficultrelationships, trauma, and grief. This chapter explores how to use your brain toimprove any relationship, helping you to feel better fast. Knowing thisinformation can help you save your job, your marriage, your friendships, or yourrelationships with your children —or all four.Chapter 7: Overcoming Trauma and Grief. Emotional trauma can get stuck in thebrain, causing your emotional circuits to overfire —sometimes for years. Thischapter explores healthy ways to eliminate the hurts that haunt you.I IS FOR INSPIRATIONChapter 8: Create Immediate and Lasting Joy. True inspiration comes from knowingwhy you are on the planet and grasping the meaning and purpose underlying whatyou do. Knowing and acting on your “why” is critical to living each day withjoy. Purposeful people are happier and healthier, and they live longer. Thischapter shows you how to protect your brain’s pleasure centers to live withpassion and purpose and avoid addictions and depression. This knowledge can helpyou feel joyful every day.N IS FOR NOURISHMENTChapter 9: The Feel Better Fast Diet. Your brain needs a constant source ofenergy to run your life. Think of it as the battery that powers your life. Thischapter explains which foods you need (and which you should toss) to immediatelyboost your focus, memory, and mood.Chapter 10: Advanced and Brain-Type Nutraceuticals. This chapter gives you apersonalized, targeted approach to getting the nutrients your brain and bodyneed. It provides detailed descriptions of the nutraceuticals I think everyoneshould take, together with ones targeted to specific brain types.X IS FOR THE X FACTORChapter 11: Think Different. In any given situation, the X factor is thevariable that has the most significant impact on the outcome. That perfectlydescribes the brain imaging work we’ve been blessed to do at Amen Clinics. Itchanged everything we do. By looking at the brain in people who had complexproblems or were treatment resistant, we gained new insights that often made thedifference between success and failure, healing and maintaining illness, evenlife and death. This chapter reveals the top 10 lessons we and our patients havelearned from our experience with brain SPECT imaging. It also lists thecircumstances in which you or a loved one should consider a scan.L IS FOR LOVEChapter 12: Love Is Your Secret Weapon. Doing the right thing is the ultimateact of love for yourself and others. Here you will learn about the science ofepigenetics and how caring for your brain and body can impact generations tocome. That really makes the good feelings last a long time.IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE TO FEEL BETTER FAST?Many people, mental health professionals included, think therapy needs to belong, hard, and painful. They believe that if you start medication for anxietyor depression, you’re making a lifelong commitment. Certainly some people willneed help longer than others, but in my experience, many people can feel betterfast if they engage in the right behaviors and strategies, which include knowingabout and optimizing their brains.Think about it: You know you can make yourself feel worse almost immediately bydwelling on the worst possible outcome of a situation, spending time with highlytoxic people, or sabotaging each of your senses with dreadful sounds, smells,tastes, touches, or sights. You can just as easily make yourself feel betterthrough simple choices like practicing gratitude, surrounding yourself withcaring people, and using many other techniques that I will demonstratethroughout the book.15 minutes. [images/x15-min.jpg]Keep an eye out for the stopwatch: You will find it next to strategies that workquickly to help you feel better. The stopwatch will indicate the amount of time,up to 60 minutes, you need to devote to that strategy for it to begin to work.Although there are many helpful and valuable strategies in the coming pages, Iam highlighting the fast-acting ones so that you can choose them when you needthe most immediate relief.The truth is, we live in an impatient society. When people seek help for mentalhealth issues, the most common number of therapy sessions they receive is one.Either they find benefit from getting their worries off their chests andlearning simple strategies —or they conclude therapy won’t be helpful for them.Even when they commit to ongoing therapy, the average number of sessions apatient attends is six or seven, regardless of the psychotherapist’s theoreticalorientation.[2]Almost everyone wants to feel better fast, and research suggests it is possible.Studies since the 1980s have shown the value of single-session therapies (SSTs).In one study, a single session of hypnosis significantly decreased anxiety anddepressive symptoms after coronary artery bypass surgery.[3] In another,Australian researchers found that 60 percent of children and teens with mentalhealth issues showed improvement after 18 months from just one session oftherapy.[4] On page 190 [chapter_8.xhtml#page_190], I share the story of a manwho was suffering from crushing grief and was helped by just one session withfamed psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl. The components of SSTsare helping people tap into their strengths, offering simple solutions, andproviding support —three strategies that I will also provide throughout thebook.Helping people change their feelings and behaviors and optimize their lives hasbeen my passion as a psychiatrist for the past four decades. Amen Clinicspartnered with Professor BJ Fogg, director of the Persuasive Tech Lab atStanford University, and his sister, Linda Fogg-Phillips, to help our patientswith behavior change. They teach that only three things change behavior in thelong run: 1. An epiphany 2. A change in the environment (what and who surrounds you) 3. Taking baby steps[5]When Leiza saw her troubled SPECT scan, it was a wake-up call for her to gethealthy, as it is for so many of our patients. When I read a study by my friendDr. Cyrus Raji[6] on what I call the dinosaur syndrome (as your weight goes up,the size and function of your brain go down —with a big body and a little brain,you’re likely to become extinct), I had an epiphany and found the discipline tolose 25 pounds. But you don’t have to wait for an epiphany to change yourbehavior. You don’t need to have a heart attack or get cancer in order to getserious about your health. Most people can change their environment (friends,workplace, church) or the people they surround themselves with, and all of uscan make small changes that, over time, create amazing results.Two columns of cartoon images of a brain carrying out different activities. Theleft column is titled 'Feel Better Fast Now but Not Later.' In the column'simages, the brain is smoking a cigarette, drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana,and playing a video game. The right column is titled 'Feel Better Fast Now andLater.' In the column's images, the brain is jogging, meditating, praying, andlistening to music. [images/Illustration-0Intro.4-11.jpg]High motivation helps you do hard things. But if your motivation is medium oreven low, you can still change for the better. In fact, the Foggs encouragestarting with baby steps, or what they call “Tiny Habits.”[7] These are easychanges that will boost your sense of accomplishment and competence and, overtime, evolve into bigger changes. At the end of each chapter, look for a list ofTiny Habits that you can incorporate each week, one or more at a time. Each oneis tied to a habitual activity you do every day —like getting out of bed,brushing your teeth, answering the phone, or driving your car —which serves as aprompt to remind you to take action. The Tiny Habits format is “When I do x (orwhen x happens), I will do y.” Then when you do y, celebrate to reinforce thenew behavior and good feeling. Celebrations can be as simple as a fist pump orsaying an “Atta boy” or “Atta girl” to yourself. Remember, small dailyimprovements are the key to spectacular long-term results.Here’s one you can start right now that will make a huge and lasting change:Whenever you come to a decision point in your day, ask yourself, “Is thedecision I’m about to make good for my brain or bad for it?” If you consistentlymake decisions that serve your brain’s health —and you’ll learn more about howto do that in each chapter of this book —you are well on your way to feelingbetter fast in a way that will make it last.[1] T.

We always begin by addressing the brain’sphysical function and then move on to how it is programmed. It’s absolutelynecessary to do both. Sadly, many people forget the brain —or try to tame itwith drugs, a temporary fix that will wear off sooner or later, causing symptomsto return. These next four chapters will give you brain-based strategies to gaincontrol over anxiety, worry, sadness, stress, and anger.In chapter 1 we’ll look at quick, practical strategies that will help you feelbetter fast and pave the way for longer-term change, whether you’re trying torescue a bad day or dealing with an issue such as chronic anxiety or depression.Think of this as a toolbox you can put to immediate use.

I was just putting on my white lab coat as Iwalked through the doors to the unit. It was my third day as an intern, and theemergency room would be my home for the next month. Down the hall from me, awoman was screaming. Curious, I went to see what was going on.Beth, a 40-year-old patient, was lying on a gurney with a swollen right leg. Shewas in obvious pain and screamed whenever anyone touched her leg. Bruce, abrand-new psychiatry intern like me, and Wendy, the internal medicine chiefresident, were trying to start an IV in Beth’s foot. She was anxious, scared,uncooperative, and hyperventilating. A blood clot in her calf was causing thistremendous swelling. The IV was necessary so Beth could be sent to the X-raydepartment for a scan that would show exactly where the clot was, allowingsurgeons to operate and remove it. With each stick of the IV needle to herswollen foot, Beth’s screams became louder. Wendy was obviously frustrated andirritated, and sweat started to roll down her temples.“Calm down!” she snapped at the patient.Beth looked scared and confused. There was a lot of tension in the room.Wendy paged the surgeon on call. She paced during the several minutes it tookfor him to get back to her. When the phone rang, Wendy quickly answered it,saying, “I need you to come to the ER right away. I need you to do a ‘cut down’on a patient’s foot. It looks like she has a blood clot in her leg, and we needto start an IV before sending her to X-ray. Her foot is swollen, and she’s beingdifficult!”Wendy listened for a few moments and then said, “What do you mean you can’t comefor an hour? This has got to be done right away. I’ll do it myself.” She cursedas she slammed down the phone.Hearing this, Beth looked even more panicked.Being new, I didn’t want to say anything, especially because I had heard ofWendy’s reputation for harassing interns, but I hated to see Beth in pain. Thisis going to be an interesting day, I thought to myself. I took a deep breath.“Wendy, can I try to start the IV?” I asked softly.She glared at me, and with a tone that was both sarcastic and condescending, shesaid, “Your name is Amen, right? I’ve been starting IVs for five years. Whatmakes you think you’re so special? But if you want to try and look stupid,hotshot, go for it.” She rudely tossed the IV set at me and left the room. Imotioned to Bruce to shut the door.The first thing I did was walk around the gurney to Beth’s head and establisheye contact with her. I gave her a gentle smile. Wendy had been yelling at Bethfrom the other end of the gurney, at her feet.“Hi, Beth, I’m Dr. Amen. I need you to slow down your breathing. When youbreathe too quickly, all of the blood vessels constrict, making it impossiblefor us to find a vein. Breathe with me.” I slowed my own breathing, thinkingthat Wendy was going to kill me when I finished.“Do you mind if I help you relax?” I asked. “I know some tricks.”“Okay,” Beth said nervously.“Look at that spot on the ceiling,” I said, pointing to a spot overhead. “I wantyou to focus on it and ignore everything else in the room . . . I’m going tocount to 10, and as I do, let your eyes feel very heavy. Only focus on the spotand the sound of my voice. 1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . let your eyes feel very heavy. . . 4 . . . 5 . . . let your eyes feel heavier still . . . 6 . . . 7 . . . 8. . . your eyes are feeling very heavy and want to close . . . 9 . . . 10 . . .let your eyes close, and keep them closed.“Very good,” I said as Beth closed her eyes. “I want you to breathe very slowly,very deeply, and only pay attention to the sound of my voice. Let your wholebody relax, from the top of your head all the way down to the bottoms of yourfeet. Let your whole body feel warm, heavy, and very relaxed. Now I want you toforget about the hospital and imagine yourself in the most beautiful park youcan imagine. See the park —the grass, the hillside, a gentle brook, beautifultrees. Hear the sounds in the park —the brook flowing, the birds singing, alight breeze rustling the leaves in the trees. Smell and taste the freshness inthe air. Feel the sensations in the park —the light breeze on your skin, thewarmth of the sun.”All of the tension in the room had evaporated. Wendy popped her head in theroom, but Bruce put his index finger to his lips and motioned for her to leave.She rolled her eyes and quietly shut the door.“Now I want you to imagine a beautiful pool in the middle of the park,” Icontinued. “It is filled with special, warm healing water. In your mind, sit onthe edge of the pool and dangle your feet in it. Feel the warm water surroundyour feet. You are doing really great.”Beth had gone into a deep trance.I went on. “Now I know this might sound strange, but many people can actuallymake their blood vessels pop up if they direct their attention to them. Withyour feet in the pool, allow the blood vessels in your feet to pop up so that Ican put an IV in one and you can get the help you need, still allowing your mindto stay in the park and feel very relaxed.”In medical school, I took a monthlong elective in hypnosis. I had watched a filmof an Indian psychiatrist who put a patient in a hypnotic trance and had herdilate a vein in her hand. The doctor stuck a needle through the vein and thenremoved it, causing blood to flow out of both sides of the vein. Next, at thedoctor’s suggestion, the patient stopped the bleeding, first on one side of thevein and then the other. It was one of the most amazing feats of self-control Ihad ever seen. Beth’s situation reminded me of the film. In truth, I had noexpectation that she would actually be able to dilate the vein in her foot.To my great surprise, the moment I made the suggestion, a vein clearly appearedon top of Beth’s swollen foot. I gently slipped the needle into the vein andattached it to the bag of IV fluid. Bruce’s eyes widened. He couldn’t believewhat he had just seen.“Beth,” I said softly, “you can stay in this deep relaxed state as long as youneed. You can go back to the park anytime you want.”Bruce and I wheeled Beth to X-ray.When I returned to the unit an hour later, Wendy gave me a hostile look, but Ismiled inside.With the right plan, you can feel better fast and make it last, even when youare in the midst of an emotional or physical crisis. That is why I have providedthe following emergency rescue plan, which includes the techniques I used tohelp calm Beth —hypnosis, progressive muscle relaxation, and guidedimagery —among others. Before we get to the plan, it is critical to understandhow your brain and body work in a crisis, especially as it relates to youremergency alarm system —the fight-or-flight response.THE FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT STRESS RESPONSEThe fight-or-flight response is hardwired into our bodies to help us survive. Itis mobilized into action whenever a stress appears, such as what happened toBeth in the emergency room. Harvard physiology professor Walter Cannon firstdescribed the fight-or-flight response in 1915. He said it was the body’sreaction to an acute stress, harmful event, or threat to survival, such asexperiencing an earthquake or being robbed —or having the chief resident screamat you while she is poking you with a needle. Acute stress activates thesympathetic nervous system, which prepares you to either put up a fight or fleea dangerous situation. The fight-or-flight response is triggered by 1. the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure in the temporal lobes that is part of the limbic or emotional brain, which sends a signal to 2. the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which signals 3. the adrenal glands, on the top of the kidneys, to flood the body with cortisol, adrenaline, and other chemicals to rocket you into action.The graphic on pages 8–9 [chapter_1.xhtml#page_8] illustrates what happens inour bodies when this response is set off.The fight-or-flight response is part of a larger system in the body called theautonomic nervous system (ANS). It is called “autonomic” because its processesare largely automatic, unconscious, and out of our control, unless we train itotherwise (more on that coming up). It contains two branches that counterbalanceeach other: the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Both regulateheart rate, digestion, breathing rate, pupil response, muscle tension,urination, and sexual arousal. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is involvedin activating the fight-or-flight response, while the parasympathetic nervoussystem (PNS) helps to reset and calm our bodies.Our very survival depends upon the fight-or-flight response, as it helps move usto action when there is a threat. But when stress becomes chronic, such as ifyou live in a war zone, grow up in an unpredictable alcoholic home, are sexuallymolested over time, or wet your bed and wake up every morning in a panic, yoursympathetic nervous system becomes overactive. When that happens, you are morelikely to suffer from anxiety, depression, panic attacks, headaches, cold handsand feet, breathing difficulties, high blood sugar, high blood pressure,digestive problems, immune system issues, erectile dysfunction, and problemswith attention and focus.In his groundbreaking book Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers, Stanford Universitybiologist Robert Sapolsky pointed out that for animals such as zebras, stress isgenerally episodic (e.g., running away from a lion) and their nervous systemsevolved to rapidly reset. By contrast, for humans, stress is often chronic(e.g., daily traffic, a difficult marriage, job or money worries). Sapolskyargued that many wild animals are less susceptible than humans to chronicstress-related illnesses such as ulcers, hypertension, depression, and memoryproblems.[8] He did write, however, that chronic stress occurs in some primates(Dr. Sapolsky studies baboons), specifically individuals on the lower end of thesocial dominance hierarchy.In humans, one big stress (such as being robbed, raped, or in a fire) ormultiple smaller stressors (such as fighting with your spouse or children on aregular basis) can turn on a chronic fight-or-flight state in the body, leadingto mental stress and physical illness. But you can learn to quiet your SNS andactivate the PNS, which will lead you to feel calmer, happier, and lessstressed. Improving the PNS is associated with lower blood pressure, more stableblood sugar, and better energy, immunity, and sleep.THE FEEL BETTER FAST RESPONSEAfter I finished my psychiatric training in 1987, I was stationed at Fort Irwinin California’s Mojave Desert. Halfway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, FortIrwin was also known as the National Training Center —the place where oursoldiers were taught to fight the Russians (and later others) in the desert. Atthe time, I was the only psychiatrist for 4,000 soldiers and a similar number oftheir family members. It was considered an isolated assignment. There wereproblems with domestic violence, drug abuse (especially amphetamine abuse),depression, and stress-related ailments from living in the middle of nowhere. Idealt with many people who suffered from headaches, anxiety attacks, insomnia,and excessive muscle tension.Diagram showing the steps in the fight-or-flight response. 1. Threat: an attack,harmful event, or threat to survival. 2. Brain: processes the signals, beginningfirst in the amygdala and then in the hypothalamus. 3. ACTH: pituitary glandsecretes adrenocorticotropic hormone. 4. Cortisol released. Adrenaline released.[images/Illustration-1.1a.jpg]A continuation of the fight-or-flight diagram listing the physical effects.Heart beats faster and harder. Bladder relaxes. Pupils dilate for better tunnelvision, but there is a loss of peripheral vision. Erections are inhibited (otherthings to think about). Air passages open and rapid shallow breathing increases.Blood pressure increases. Production of tears and saliva decreases. Digestionslows. Hearing diminishes. Muscles become tense; trembling may occur. Musclesaround hair follicles constrict, causing goose bumps. Blood vessels shunt bloodto upper arms and upper legs (fight or flee) and away from hands and feet, whichget colder. Veins in skin constrict (colder hands and feet) to send more bloodto major muscle groups (to fight or flee), causing the 'chill' sometimesassociated with fear. Blood sugar level increases for energy. Brain has troublefocusing on small tasks; it's thinking only of dealing with the threat. Immunesystem shuts down. [images/Illustration-1.1b.jpg]Shortly after arriving at Fort Irwin, I went through the cabinets in thecommunity mental health clinic, which was housed in a World War II Quonset hut,to see what helpful tools had been left behind by my predecessors. To mydelight, I found an old biofeedback temperature trainer. Biofeedback is based onthe idea that if you get immediate feedback on the physiological processes inyour body, such as hand temperature, breathing, or heart rate, you can learn tochange them through mental exercise. I had attended one biofeedback lectureduring my psychiatric training, so I dusted off the old machine and startedusing it with patients who had migraine headaches. My staff and I taught themhow to warm their hands using only their imaginations. Hand warming triggered animmediate parasympathetic relaxation response, which significantly decreasedtheir migraine pain. It was fascinating to see how patients could raise theirhand temperature with their minds, sometimes by as much as 15 to 20 degrees.Temperature training taught patients how to participate in their own healingprocess.A few months after arriving at Fort Irwin, I wrote a request to our hospitalcommander, asking him to buy $30,000 worth of the latest computerizedbiofeedback equipment for our soldiers, including 10 days of training for me inSan Francisco. While he laughed at me at first, eventually I got approval simplybecause he needed to spend his whole budget by the end of the year.The biofeedback training was the most stimulating and intense learningexperience I’d had as a physician. I learned how to help people relax theirmuscles, warm their hands (much faster than with the old equipment), calmsweat-gland activity, lower blood pressure, slow their own heart rates, breathein ways that promoted relaxation, and even change their own brain wave patterns.When I returned to Fort Irwin, my patients loved biofeedback because it helpedthem feel better fast. I loved it for the same reason and spent time each daydoing it myself. I became masterful at breathing with my diaphragm, and I couldslow my heart rate and even warm my own hands more than 15 degrees whenever Ifelt stressed. I had struggled with anxiety for most of my early life, whichcame in part from having an older brother who beat me up regularly when I wasyoung, and in part from wetting my bed at night until about age nine. Waking upevery morning in a panic, not knowing if the sheets would be wet or dry, changedmy nervous system to be on alert and expect bad things to happen. Using thesetools to calm myself was a wonderful relief.Based on my work with hypnosis, biofeedback, and quickly enhancing brainfunction, here are six simple techniques that use your brain to control yourmind and body, helping you to feel better fast.TECHNIQUE #1: USE HYPNOSIS, GUIDED IMAGERY, AND PROGRESSIVE MUSCLE RELAXATION TOENTER A DEEP, RELAXED STATE.Many people associate hypnosis with loss of control or stage tricks. But doctorsknow it to be a serious science, revealing the brain’s ability to heal medicaland psychiatric conditions. “Hypnosis is the oldest Western form ofpsychotherapy, but it’s been tarred with the brush of dangling watches andpurple capes,” said psychiatrist David Spiegel, MD, the son of a famoushypnotist and associate chair of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at StanfordUniversity School of Medicine. “In fact, it’s a very powerful means of changingthe way we use our minds to control perception and our bodies. . . . The powerof hypnosis to immediately change your brain is real.”[9]Using hypnosis, guided imagery, or progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) increasesparasympathetic tone and can quickly decrease the fight-or-flight response in awide variety of conditions, as it did for Beth. These techniques have been foundto have many benefits, including lowering anxiety, sadness, and tension inparents of children with cancer;[10] pain and fatigue in those receivingchemotherapy;[11] stress in those with multiple sclerosis;[12] anxiety anddepression;[13] migraine frequency;[14] tension headaches;[15] craving andwithdrawal symptoms in people quitting smoking;[16] poststroke anxiety (a resultof listening to a PMR CD five times a week);[17] and phantom limb pain.[18] Theycan also improve quality of life in the elderly[19] and dialysis patients,[20]fatigue in the elderly, and sexual function in postmenopausal women.[21]Learning hypnosis, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation is simple;there are many online audios that can guide you. We have several on our BrainFit Life site (www.brainfitlife.com [http://www.brainfitlife.com]). You cancertainly do it yourself. Below are the instructions I give my patients to helpthem go into a deep relaxed state. The skill builds over time, so it isimportant to practice this exercise to gain mastery. Set aside two 15-minuteperiods a day and go through the following five steps.15 minutes. [images/x15-min.jpg]SELF-HYPNOSIS, GUIDED IMAGERY, AND PROGRESSIVE MUSCLE RELAXATION: A HEALINGPRACTICE 1. Sit in a comfortable chair with your feet on the floor and your hands in your lap. Pick a spot on the opposite wall that is a little bit above your eye level. Stare at the spot. As you do, slowly count to 20. Notice that your eyelids soon begin to feel heavy, as if they want to close. Let them. In fact, even if they don’t feel as if they want to close, slowly lower them as you get to 20. 2. Take a deep breath, as deep as you can, and very slowly exhale. Repeat the deep breath and slow exhale three times. With each in-breath, imagine taking in peace and calmness, and with each out-breath, blow out all the tension —all the things getting in the way of your relaxing. By this time, you’ll notice a calm come over you. 3. Squeeze the muscles in your eyelids, closing your eyes as tightly as you can. Then slowly let the muscles in your eyelids relax. Imagine that relaxation slowly spreading, like a warm, penetrating oil, from the muscles in your eyelids to the muscles in your face —down your neck, into your shoulders and arms, into your chest, and throughout the rest of your body. The muscles will take the cue from your eyelids and relax progressively all the way down to the bottoms of your feet. 4. When all the tension has left your body, imagine yourself at the top of an escalator. Step on the escalator and ride down, counting backward from 10. By the time you reach the bottom, you’ll be very relaxed. 5. Enjoy the tranquility for several moments. Then get back on the escalator riding up, counting to 10 as you go. When you get to 10, open your eyes, feeling relaxed, refreshed, and wide awake.To make these steps easy to remember, think of the following words: * Focus (focus on the spot) * Breathe (slow, deep breaths) * Relax (progressive muscle relaxation) * Down (ride down the escalator) * Up (ride up the escalator and open your eyes)If you have trouble remembering these steps, you may want to record them as youread them aloud and then do the exercise as you listen to the audio.Allow yourself plenty of time to do this. Some people become so relaxed thatthey fall asleep for several minutes. If that happens, don’t worry. It’s a goodsign —you’re really relaxed!20 minutes. [images/x20-min.jpg]ADD VISUAL IMAGERY TO ENVISION A BETTER LIFEWhen you’ve practiced this technique a few times, add the following steps:Choose a haven —a place where you feel comfortable and that you can imagine withall your senses. I usually “go” to the beach. I can see the ocean, feel the sandbetween my toes and the warm sun and breeze on my skin, smell the salt air andtaste it faintly on my tongue, and hear the seagulls, the waves, and childrenplaying. Your haven can be any real or imaginary place where you’d like to spendtime.After you reach the bottom of the escalator, use all your senses to imagineyourself in your special haven. Stay for several minutes. This is where the funstarts and where your mind becomes ripe for change.Begin to experience yourself —not as you currently are, but as you want to be.Plan on spending at least 20 minutes a day on this refueling, life-changingexercise. You’ll be amazed at the results.During each session, choose one goal to work on. Stay with that goal until youcan imagine yourself reaching it, going through each of the steps required toattain it. If your goal is to own your own business, for example, use all yoursenses to imagine yourself in that business. See the office or shop. Interactwith your customers. Smell the environment around you. Feel your desk. Sip a cupof coffee in your chair, savoring the taste and aroma. Experience your dream.Make it real in your imagination, thereby beginning to make it real in yourlife. Or, if your goal is to improve your relationship with your spouse, friend,or children, imagine the relationship as you want it to be, in as much detail asyou can. The way to improve your expectations is to first imagine the situationas you want it to be instead of imagining the worst, as you likely have beendoing.IT EVEN WORKS AT HOMEYears ago, on the Fourth of July, we had a party at our house. As the fireworksstarted outdoors, our then-eight-year-old daughter, Chloe, was creating her ownfireworks in our kitchen. My wife, Tana, had created a new dessert for theparty, a combination of coconut and almond butter. Chloe decided to heat it up.When she took it out of the microwave, she tested it with her finger —and that’swhen the screaming started. It was very hot, and the concoction stuck to herfinger. She first tried to shake it off, then wiped it off with a towel andstuck her finger in her mouth. Next, she put her hand in ice water, then aloegel, and then ice cubes. The pain and frustration escalated as she unraveled,and the automatic negative thoughts (ANTs; see chapter 5) started to take over.“I’m so stupid,” she said. “Why did I do that?” Her mother gave her ibuprofenfor the pain and started putting her to bed, but Chloe was not calming down.The negative thoughts were now coming in droves. “I can’t do this. It’s toomuch. I can’t take it. I’m so stupid. I can’t believe I did it. I wish I couldgo back and do it over.”Tana tried to distract Chloe by reading to her, but it didn’t work. She thenprayed with her, but Chloe couldn’t focus. Nothing worked, so Tana walked intomy office and said I needed to help.I sat on Chloe’s bed and assessed the situation. As I had done for many patientsin the hospital, I used a simple hypnotic trance to calm her. Using the outlineabove, I had her focus on a spot on the wall, close her eyes, start to relax herbody, and slow her breathing. I then asked her to imagine walking down a flightof stairs as I counted backward from 10. Next I had her imagine going to aspecial park that she imagined with all of her senses, where it was safe and shewas with her mother and friends. I had her imagine going into a warm pool. Thewater had special healing powers that soothed and helped her finger, taking awaythe pain. The water also helped to calm her thoughts and her body. She did notneed to be so hard on herself. We all make mistakes. Being angry only made thepain worse.Chloe became visibly more relaxed and started to drift off to sleep. The parkand special healing pool was a place she could go back to anytime she was upsetor needed to calm down. Then she fell asleep. Quietly, we left her room,wondering how she would do. We did not see her until the next morning, and eventhough she had a small blister on her finger, she said it didn’t hurt and allwas well. “Everyone makes mistakes,” she said. “I guess that was one of mine. Iwon’t do it again.” This technique is very powerful —with adults and withchildren, too.TECHNIQUE #2: MASTER DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING.In the chapter’s opening story, the first thing I did with Beth was help her toslow her breathing, so she could get more oxygen to her brain. Diaphragmaticbreathing is a core biofeedback technique to help you feel better fast. It issimple to teach and, once practiced, simple to implement and maintain. Likebrain activity, breathing is essential to life and involved in everything youdo. Breathing delivers oxygen from the atmosphere into your lungs, where yourbloodstream picks it up and takes it to all of the cells in your body so thatthey can function properly. Breathing also allows you to eliminate wasteproducts, such as carbon dioxide, which can cause feelings of disorientation andpanic. Brain cells are particularly sensitive to oxygen; within four minutes ofbeing deprived of it, they start to die. Slight changes in oxygen content in thebrain can alter the way you feel and behave.When someone gets upset, angry, or anxious, their breathing becomes shallow andfast (see the “Breathing Anatomy” diagram below). This causes the oxygen in anangry person’s blood to decrease, while toxic carbon dioxide increases.Subsequently, the oxygen/carbon dioxide balance is upset, causing irritability,impulsiveness, confusion, and bad decision-making.Learning how to direct and control your breathing has several immediatebenefits. It calms the amygdala (part of the emotional brain), counteracts thefight-or-flight response, relaxes muscles, warms hands, and regulates theheart’s rhythms. I often teach patients to become experts at breathing slowly,deeply, and from their bellies. If you watch a baby or a puppy, you will noticethat they breathe almost solely with their bellies —the most efficient way tobreathe.Expanding your belly when you inhale flattens the diaphragm, pulling the lungsdownward and increasing the amount of air available to your lungs and body.Pulling your belly in when you exhale causes the diaphragm to push the air outof your lungs, allowing for a more fully exhaled breath, which once againencourages deep breathing. In biofeedback, patients are taught to breathe withtheir bellies by watching their breathing pattern on the computer screen. In 20to 30 minutes, most people can learn how to change their breathing patterns,which relaxes them and gives them better control over how they feel and behave.BREATHING ANATOMYTwo diagrams of the inside of a torso, the left showing inhalation and the rightshowing exhalation. The inhalation diagram shows oxygen intake through thetrachea, air flowing into the lungs, and the diaphram under the lungs movingdownward. The exhalation diagram shows the diaphram moving upward, air flowingout of the lungs, and carbon dioxide flowing up through the trachea.[images/Illustration-1.2.jpg]The diaphragm, a bell-shaped muscle, separates the chest cavity from theabdomen. Many people never flatten the diaphragm when they inhale, and thus witheach breath they have less access to their own lung capacity and have to workharder. By moving your belly out when you inhale, you flatten the diaphragm,significantly increase lung capacity, and calm all body systems.BREATHING DURING ANGERGraph showing a large waveform under the label 'feeling relaxed' and a shallow,jagged waveform under the label 'feeling angry.' [images/Illustration-1.3.jpg]The large waveform is a measurement of abdominal or belly breathing, by a straingauge attached around the belly; the smaller waveform is a measurement of chestbreathing, by a strain gauge attached around the upper chest. At rest, thisperson breathes mostly with his belly (a good pattern), but when he thinks aboutan angry situation his breathing pattern deteriorates, markedly decreasing theoxygen to his brain (common to anger outbursts). No wonder people who have angeroutbursts often seem irrational!Controlled diaphragmatic breathing has been shown to improve focus and loweranxiety, stress, negative feelings, and cortisol;[22] decrease depression[23]and asthma;[24] reduce obesity in children,[25] pain,[26] blood pressure,[27]motion sickness,[28] and seizure frequency;[29] and boost the quality of life inheart failure patients.[30]TECHNIQUE #3: BECOME EXPERT AT WARMING YOUR HANDS WITH YOUR MIND.Take a moment to focus on your hands, feeling their energy and temperature. Whenyou intentionally learn how to warm your hands with your brain by directing yourthoughts to warming images (such as holding your palms up in front of a fire),your body goes into a relaxed state. Scientific research has shown that usingthis technique can be helpful for anxiety,[31] migraine headaches in bothchildren[32] and adults,[33] blood pressure,[34] and irritable bowel syndrome(IBS).[35] New evidence shows that when you hold something warm, such as a warmhand, you are more trusting and giving, and you feel closer to others. Coldhands have the opposite effect.Researchers studied college students to assess how hand temperature affectsemotions.[36] They found that holding warm things may actually make people viewothers more favorably and may also make them more generous. In one study, atester met each of the 41 participants in the lobby of the building where thetests were being conducted. In the elevator on the way up, the tester casuallyasked the participant to hold his cup of coffee while he recorded someinformation on his clipboard. The participant did not know that this request waspart of the experiment. Half the participants were asked to hold a cup of warmcoffee, and half were asked to hold a cup of iced coffee. Once in the testingroom, participants were given a packet of information on an unknown person andthen asked to evaluate the person’s personality using a questionnaire.Participants who had held the warm coffee were much more likely to score theunknown person as warmer than those who had held the iced coffee.BREATHING TECHNIQUES TO HELP YOU CALM DOWN FAST5 minutes. [images/x05-min.jpg]Breathing Technique #1: While few people have access to sophisticatedbiofeedback equipment, these simple techniques can be effective for everyone.Try the following exercise right now: Lie on your back and place a small book onyour belly. When you inhale, make the book rise by expanding your belly; whenyou exhale, pull your belly in, which will lower the book. Shifting the energyof breathing lower in your body—from your upper chest into your abdomen—willhelp you feel more relaxed and in better control of yourself almostinstantaneously. Practice this for five minutes every day until it feelsnatural. You can use this breathing technique to gain greater focus and controlover your temper. It is easy to learn, and it can also help with sleep andanxiety issues.2 to 3 minutes. [images/x02-03-min.jpg]Breathing Technique #2: Whenever you feel anxious, mad, or tense, take a deepbreath, hold it for one or two seconds, and then slowly exhale for about fiveseconds. Then take another deep breath, as deep as you can, hold it for one totwo seconds, and again slowly exhale. Do this about 10 times, and odds are thatyou will start to feel very relaxed, if not a little sleepy. I have used thistechnique myself for 30 years whenever I feel anxious, angry, or stressed, orwhen I have trouble falling asleep. It sounds so simple, but breathing isessential to life. When we slow down and become more efficient with ourbreathing, most things seem better.In a second study by the same researchers, participants were asked to holdeither a hot or a cold therapeutic pad. Participants thought their role was toevaluate the product. After the “test,” they were offered a reward forthemselves or a treat for a friend. The people who had held the warm pad weremore likely to choose the treat for a friend. Dr. John Bargh, coauthor of thestudy, said, “It appears that the effect of physical temperature is not just onhow we see others, it affects our own behavior as well. Physical warmth can makeus see others as warmer people, but also cause us to be warmer —more generousand trusting —as well.” Coauthor Dr. Lawrence Williams said, “At a boardmeeting, for instance, being willing to reach out and touch another human being,to share their hand, those experiences do matter although we may not always beaware of them.”[37] These studies are striking because we know that when ourhands are cold, we are more likely to be anxious and fearful, traits thatdecrease intimacy and closeness to others.BRING WARMTH TO INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS10 minutes. [images/x10-min.jpg]To develop heartfelt closeness, when you hold your partner’s hand, imagine warm,loving energy going from your hand to his or hers. With each exhalation sendwarm, intentional thoughts of love and gratitude. Do this just a few times aday, and soon you will begin to notice a positive difference in yourrelationship.Visualizing warmth, especially in your hands, is another tool to help you feelbetter fast and counteract the fight-or-flight response. I’ve found thatteaching patients to warm their hands calms down their bodies and minds just aseffectively as prescription drugs. Hand warming elicits an immediate relaxationresponse. We know this because biofeedback instruments allow us to measure handtemperature and then teach people how to warm their hands. Interestingly,children are better at this than adults because kids readily believe they havepower over their bodies, whereas adults do not.When my daughter Breanne was eight years old, she could increase her handtemperature by up to 20 degrees. She was so good at it, I brought her along withme when I did a biofeedback lecture to physicians at a Northern Californiahospital. In front of 30 physicians, I had her demonstrate her amazing skill.However, for the first three minutes her hands did nothing but get ice cold,because she felt such performance anxiety. In those few minutes I was horrified,feeling like a terrible father who was exploiting his daughter to be importantin front of his colleagues. Then I whispered in her ear that she should closeher eyes, take a deep breath, and imagine her hands in the warm sand at thebeach (the image that worked best for her). Over the next seven minutes, herhands warmed 18 degrees. The doctors were amazed, she was so happy with herself,and I was relieved that I had not scarred her for life.How can you warm your hands with your mind? You do it with diaphragmaticbreathing and the visualization that works for you. For some, like Breanne, it’simagining putting your hands in warm sand at the beach. For others, it’sthinking about holding a loved one’s hand or touching their warm skin. For stillothers, it’s visualizing holding a warm, furry kitten or puppy.3 to 4 minutes. [images/x03-04-min.jpg]Hand-Warming Technique. Close your eyes and hold out your hands, palms down, andvisualize a campfire in front of you. Focus. Think heat. You can hear the firecrackle, smell the aroma of fresh-cut wood burning, see the sparks float up intothe sky. Now feel the soothing heat as it penetrates the surface of your skinand goes deep to warm your hands. Picture this as you breathe deeply, and countslowly to 20. Did you feel an increase in warmth? Relaxation? Did you find youstarted to hold your hands closer as if there were actually a fire in front ofyou? Practice this technique for a few minutes every day, and you’ll find youget to the relaxation response more easily and faster over time. Find thehand-warming images that work for you, and you will reset your nervous system tobe more relaxed and counteract your stress response. You can buy temperaturesensors online (under brand names Biodots, Stress Cards, and Stress Sheets) toget feedback on your progress.13 HAND-WARMING IMAGES 1.

What’s more, meditation benefits your heart and blood pressure,digestion, and immune system, as well as improving executive function andemotional control and reducing feelings of anxiety, depression, andirritability.[38]There are many effective techniques, including reading, memorizing, ormeditating on Scripture; writing out a personal prayer; reading classicspiritual writings; or focusing on gratitude. One of my personal favorite formsof meditation is called Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM), which is intended todevelop feelings of goodwill and warmth toward others. It has been found toquickly increase positive emotions and decrease negative ones,[39] decreasepain[40] and migraine headaches,[41] reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stressdisorder[42] and social prejudice,[43] increase gray matter in the emotionalprocessing areas of the brain,[44] and boost social connectedness.[45] Here’show to start to practice:10 minutes. [images/x10-min.jpg]Loving-Kindness Meditation. Sit in a comfortable and relaxed position and closeyour eyes. Take two or three deep breaths, taking twice as long to exhale asinhale. Let any worries or concerns drift away, and feel your breath movingthrough the area around your heart. As you sit, quietly or silently repeat thefollowing or similar phrases: * May I be safe and secure. * May I be healthy and strong. * May I be happy and purposeful. * May I be at peace.Let the intentions expressed in these phrases sink in as you repeat them. Allowthe feelings to grow deeper.After a few repetitions, direct the phrases to someone you feel grateful for orsomeone who has helped you: * May you be safe and secure. * May you be healthy and strong. * May you be happy and purposeful. * May you be at peace.Next, visualize someone you feel neutral about. Choose among people you neitherlike nor dislike, and repeat the phrases.Now visualize someone you don’t like or with whom you are having a hard time,and repeat the phrases with that person in mind. Kids who are being teased orbullied at school often feel quite empowered when they send love to the peoplewho are making them miserable.Finally, direct the phrases more broadly: May everyone be safe and secure.You can do this for up to 30 minutes; it is up to you.TECHNIQUE #5: CREATE YOUR EMOTIONAL RESCUE PLAYLIST.Music can soothe, inspire, improve your mood, and help you focus. It isimportant in every known culture on earth, with ancient roots extending backthousands of years.[46] After evaluating more than 800 people, researchers havefound that people listen to music to regulate their energy and mood, to achieveself-awareness, and to improve social bonds. Music provides social cement —thinkof work and war songs, lullabies, and national anthems.[47] In his powerful bookThe Secret Language of the Heart, Barry Goldstein reviewed the neuroscientificproperties of music. He suggested that music stimulates emotional circuits inthe brain[48] and releases oxytocin, the “cuddle hormone,” which can enhancebonding, trust, and relationships.[49] He wrote, “Listening to music can createpeak emotions, which increase the amount of dopamine, a specificneurotransmitter that is produced in the brain and helps control the brain’sreward and pleasure centers. . . . Music was used to assist patients with severebrain injuries in recalling personal memories. The music helped the patients toreconnect to memories they previously could not access.”[50] Be aware, however,that music you strongly like or dislike may impair your focus.[51]Based on the concept of entrainment, which means your brain picks up the rhythmof your environment, you can manipulate your mind with the music you choose. Ina fascinating study, research subjects rated Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos (K.448) and Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata as happy and sad, respectively.[52]Listening to happy music (Mozart’s piece) increased activity in the brain’s lefthemisphere, associated with happiness and motivation, and decreased activity inthe right hemisphere, often associated with anxiety and negativity. Beethoven’spiece did the opposite. According to research published in the Journal ofPositive Psychology, you can improve your mood and boost your overall happinessin just two weeks, simply by having the intention of being happier and bylistening to specific mood-boosting music, such as Aaron Copland’s Rodeo, for 12minutes a day.[53] Having only the intention to be happier was not as effective.Listening to happy instrumental music (versus music with lyrics) was morepowerful in activating the limbic or emotional circuits of the brain.[54]Create your own emotional rescue playlist to boost your mood quickly. Researchshows it can be effective to start with musical pieces you love. If you’re notsure where to start, try some of these pieces, which have been shown throughresearch to boost mood.RESEARCH-BASED FEEL BETTER FAST MUSIC3 to 25 minutes.

Onceyou do the behaviors you want, find a way to make yourself feel good aboutthem —draw a happy face, pump your fist, or do whatever feels natural. Emotionhelps the brain to remember. 1. Whenever I feel anxious or stressed, I will take three deep belly breaths and imagine a safe haven or place that relaxes me. 2. When I hold my partner’s or child’s hand, I will think of warmth radiating between our hands. 3. When I start to feel irritated, I will look at some photos of nature. 4. When I feel upset, I will put on the playlist I developed to feel happy. 5. Before I go to bed, I will pray or do a short Loving-Kindness Meditation.5 minutes.

She received a call from Child Protective Services asking if shewas interested in picking up her 10-month-old niece, Rain, who had been takeninto custody after being exposed to domestic violence. Trish had never met thechild before and discovered that Rain was quiet, malnourished, and almostcatatonic. Trish thought at first that she could be autistic, but once aroundTrish’s teenage children, Rain started to come out of her shell. At 18 monthsRain went to her first preschool, but within two months she had been kicked outof three schools. She was described as impulsively mean, even though at timesshe could be very empathetic, especially to animals. At this young age, Rainhead-butted, kicked, hit, pinched, and punched. She had to stay with a nannyuntil she went to kindergarten.Rain was suspended from school the first month for violent behavior. Thiscontinued into first grade. After many painful meetings with the school, it wasdecided to place Rain in a school that deals with behaviorally disorderedchildren. She went to a level 1 school, which lasted 90 days. She was thentransferred to a level 2 school for children with more severe behavioral issues,which only lasted 30 days, and finally to the most restrictive type of school,level 3, which still couldn’t help her control her tantrums. The school systemtotally failed Rain. The principal told Trish the school would only keep Rain ifshe were put on psychiatric medication, which Trish refused to do because shethought they didn’t really know what was going on with her child.“We tried and tried and tried to get her help and failed miserably. Nothing isworse than not being able to help your child, especially not understanding whyshe suffered,” Trish told me. “We wondered, What are we doing wrong as parents?We had three kids in college, so our track record was pretty good. We simply didnot know what to do besides pray. So, we prayed —a lot!”Yet another new school suspended Rain within two months for destruction ofproperty and fighting with other kids. At age seven, she was now being placed ina private school with a locked campus. Trish had just started to work as thedirector of the call center at Amen Clinics.“I was ready to quit my job. I was called to the school every day, likeclockwork, for 10 consecutive days. As a parent I was simply exhausted and outof hope. But I did have an advantage: I worked at Amen Clinics. Although we seekids all day, it just had not sunk in that this could be a ‘mental health’issue. So we scanned her brain.”Rain’s scan was very abnormal. She had a pattern we call the “ring of fire,”with excessive activity in her whole brain, especially her anterior cingulategyrus, meaning she would get stuck on negative thoughts and behaviors. Thechild’s brain was working way too hard, giving her little control over her ownbehavior. It was easy to call her a bad girl until you looked at her brain. Weput Rain on supplements to calm her brain, had her see a neurofeedbacktherapist, and changed her diet, eliminating gluten and dairy.RAIN BEFORERain yelling angrily.

[images/Illustration-2.2.jpg]Ring of fire pattern: overall increased activityIn the first 30 days Rain had fewer issues. Within 60 days the school hadstopped calling. Trish thought, Is this really happening? After about 90 days,Rain said for the first time ever, “Mom, I like school.” Trish cried tears ofjoy. What’s even more amazing is that Rain, now eight years old, is in secondgrade, but she reads, writes, and tests in science and math at the sixth-gradelevel. She is in a new school, which wanted to move her ahead two grades. Shewas never academically tested prior to second grade because she was sooverfocused that she was unable to cooperate or pay attention. Trish told me,“She won ‘writer of the year’ and ‘most empathic peer.’ My child, who wanted toburn down the school, is finally not fighting her own brain. My daughter smiles,laughs, reads, and has not been kicked out of school or put her hands on anotherchild since getting the help she needed.”HELPING YOUR BRAIN IS THE MISSING STRATEGYToo often, when people feel sad, nervous, panicky, grief-stricken, or unhappy,they engage in behaviors that hurt their brains, and thus their lives. Andwell-meaning professionals often prescribe medications without ever looking atthe brain. Whenever you have negative or out-of-control feelings, the secret tofeeling better fast is to engage in behaviors that serve the physical health ofyour brain, rather than hurt it.Over the years, I have been able to simplify brain health into these threesteps: 1. Develop brain envy. 2. Avoid anything that hurts your brain. 3. Engage in regular brain-healthy habits.STRATEGY #1: DEVELOP BRAIN ENVY.Anyone who has read my books is familiar with a concept I call brain envy. Totruly be your best, you need to love and care for the three-pound supercomputerbetween your ears. And it helps to have a healthy envy of the people around youwho respect and take care of their brains, as it acts as a powerful motivator toemulate their behavior. Yet very few people really care about their brains,likely because they cannot see them. You can see the wrinkles in your skin, thefat around your belly, the flab on your arms, or the graying hair around yourtemples, and you can do something about any of those things if they make youunhappy. But because very few people ever look at their brains with imagingstudies like SPECT, many just don’t pay attention to them. As a result, theydon’t care about them, which is why parents allow children to hit soccer ballswith their heads, play tackle football, or do dangerous gymnastic orcheerleading routines —and why they feed their kids unhealthy food. It is alsowhy you may text while driving, drink too much alcohol, smoke pot, eatlow-quality fast food on the run, allow automatic negative thoughts (ANTs) toinfest your mind, or not make sleep a priority.Once you truly love your brain, everything in your life changes because you havea heightened sense of urgency to care for it, just as you would care for a new$300,000 Ferrari. Would you ever pour sugar or salt into the gas tank? Would yourun the car until it couldn’t go anymore without maintenance? Of course not! Butisn’t your brain worth so much more? Of course it is. Your brain needs you tolove and care for it, or it will never be able to fully take care of you.When you develop brain envy and truly love your brain, it becomes easier tofocus on the right habits to keep it healthy over time. You’re also more likelyto make these changes with a great attitude. Doing the right things for yourbrain is self-reinforcing. Gradually you realize that you don’t feel deprived.Rather, you start to feel bad when you do the wrong things because you realizeyou are hurting the most important part of you, the part that runs everything inyour life. That is the epitome of self-destructive behavior. Ultimately, as wewill see in chapter 12, taking care of our brains is about loving ourselves andothers.To drive this point home, let’s contrast ten statements I hear from my patientswho have brain envy with the assertions I hear from those who have brain apathy.BRAIN ENVY STATEMENTSBRAIN APATHY STATEMENTSI love my brain.I never think about my brain.Every day, I make the best decisions I can.Everything in moderation. (This opens the door to illness because it becomesyour excuse to keep doing the wrong thing.)I am aware of the pitfalls around me.Don’t take things so seriously.I try to do the best for my brain every day, including holidays.It’s the weekend. I should live a little.I focus on getting good sleep.Sleep is not a priority. I’m just too busy.I only buy healthy food for my family.My kids won’t eat anything healthy. I buy them what they want, so at leastthey’ll eat something.I get my important health numbers tested every year.I haven’t had a checkup in years.I won’t let my kids play sports where they could hit their heads.I allow my kids to make their own decisions about sports.I have dementia in my family. I am going to do everything I can to avoid it.I have dementia in my family. It’s genetic, so there’s nothing I can do aboutit.I keep my weight at a healthy level, to protect my brain.Everyone’s overweight. What’s the big deal?I gave up sugar to save my brain.I’d rather get Alzheimer’s disease than give up sugar.It should be obvious which column will give you better overall brain health.How can you make brain envy actionable in your life? Use the Tiny Habit youlearned in the introduction: Whenever you come to a decision point in your day,ask yourself, “Is the decision I’m about to make good for my brain or bad forit?” In the rest of this chapter and the chapters to come, we’ll take a look atmany specific behaviors and choices that will positively affect your brain, soyou’ll be fully equipped to answer this question. But you may already know morethan you think you do. Consider these three examples: * You just had a fight with your spouse. Should you 1. respond in anger and tell him or her just what is on your mind? 2. have a donut to calm your nerves? 3. grab an apple and a few nuts, and take a walk to calm down and consider what you can do to make the situation better? Which of these options will help your brain work better? * Your stock portfolio went down after a stock market sell-off. Should you 1. stay up all night to figure out your next best move? 2. make sure you get seven hours of sleep so you are well rested and can make good decisions about your stocks the next day? 3. smoke a joint to relax? Which of these options will help you make better decisions? * Your boss just told you she was unhappy with your performance. Should you 1. skip lunch, put your head down, and work harder? 2. complain to your coworkers about how unreasonable your boss is over a beer and nachos after work? 3. take a walk to clear your head, return, and ask your boss for feedback on how you can improve? Which of these choices will help your brain help you improve your life?If you practice brain envy and make a habit of asking, “Is this decision goodfor my brain or bad for it?” at the moment of choice, and then make the bestdecision for the health of your brain, it will help you feel better fast in away that will be long lasting.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Love your brain by asking yourself at the moment of every choice, “Is this goodfor my brain or bad for it?”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------STRATEGY #2: AVOID ANYTHING THAT HURTS YOUR BRAIN.One of the world’s richest men, famed business investor and CEO of BerkshireHathaway Warren Buffett, has two rules of investing: * Rule #1: Never lose money. * Rule #2: Never forget rule #1.In the same way, the most important rules of brain health are * Rule #1: Never lose brain cells. * Rule #2: Never forget rule #1.Losing brain cells is much harder to recover from than any financial loss. Justask anyone who has had a serious brain injury or stroke. When I was in medicalschool, we were taught that people were born with all of the brain cells theywould ever have, and once those were gone, that was it. While we now know thatis not completely true, only certain small areas of the brain make new cellsevery day. That’s why you should do everything you can to avoid losing the braincells you have.In my book Memory Rescue: Supercharge Your Brain, Reverse Memory Loss, andRemember What Matters Most, I developed the mnemonic BRIGHT MINDS to help youremember the 11 major factors that steal brain cells and lead to cognitiveimpairment. You can prevent or treat almost all of these risk factors, and eventhe ones that you can’t, such as having a family history of dementia, can beameliorated with the right strategies. Here is a brief summary of the BRIGHTMINDS risk factors. The risks marked with an asterisk (*) are things that mightmake you feel better temporarily but will hurt you in the long run.B – Blood flow: Circulation is essential to life. It is the conduit fortransporting nutrients to, and toxins away from, your cells. Low blood flowshrinks the brain and kills its cells. In fact, low blood flow on brain imagingis the number one predictor of future Alzheimer’s disease. What’s more, if youhave blood flow problems anywhere, you likely have them throughout your body.BLOOD FLOW RISKS THAT DRAIN YOUR BRAIN * Excessive caffeine* * Nicotine* * Dehydration * Hypertension * Any cardiovascular disease * Erectile dysfunction * Oxygen deprivation (such as near drowning) * Too little exercise*R – Retirement/Aging: The risk of brain dysfunction increases with age. When youstop learning or connecting with others, your brain starts dying.RETIREMENT/AGING RISKS THAT DRAIN YOUR BRAIN * Loneliness or social isolation * Being in a job that does not require new learning * Retirement without new learning endeavorsI – Inflammation: Chronic inflammation is like a low-level fire in your bodythat destroys your organs. Here’s a list of inflammation promoters.INFLAMMATION RISKS THAT DRAIN YOUR BRAIN * Leaky gut * Gum disease * Low omega-3 fatty acids * High omega-6 fatty acids * High C-reactive protein (CRP) * Fast and processed food, pro-inflammatory diet*G – Genetics: Your inheritance matters, but your lifestyle matters more. As wewill see, genetic risk is not a death sentence; it should be a wake-up call toget serious about brain health.GENETIC RISKS THAT DRAIN YOUR BRAIN * Family member with cognitive impairment, dementia, Parkinson’s disease, or a mental health issue * Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 gene (one or two copies raise your risk for cognitive problems)H – Head trauma: Your brain is soft, about the consistency of soft butter, andit is housed in a very hard skull with multiple sharp, bony ridges. Headinjuries, such as concussions, even mild ones, can kill brain cells and causesignificant, lasting cognitive problems. Even one concussion triples the risk ofsuicide.[79]HEAD TRAUMA RISKS THAT DRAIN YOUR BRAIN * History of one or more head injuries with or without loss of consciousness * Playing contact sports,* even without a concussion * Activities that increase the risk of brain trauma, such as texting while driving,* trying to carry too many packages at one time, or going up on any roof (don’t unless it’s absolutely safe)T – Toxins: Toxins are a major cause of brain dysfunction. Your brain is themost metabolically active organ in your body, which makes it more vulnerable todamage from a long list of toxins. Personal care products are particularlydangerous, because what goes on your body goes in and becomes your body.TOXIN RISKS THAT DRAIN YOUR BRAIN * Nicotine (smoking cigarettes, chewing tobacco, vaping)* * Drug abuse, including marijuana,* which increases the risk of psychosis in teenagers,[80] decreases motivation and school performance, and decreases overall blood flow to the brain, especially in areas vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease[81] * Moderate to heavy alcohol use* * Many legal drugs, such as benzodiazepines, sleeping medications, and chronic pain medications* * Pesticide exposure in air or food, recently shown to decrease serotonin and dopamine in the brain[82] * Environmental toxins, such as mold, carbon monoxide, or air or water pollution * Personal care products (such as shampoos and deodorants) made with parabens, phthalates, or PEGs* * Artificial food additives, dyes, and preservatives * Drinking* or eating* out of plastic containers * Heavy metals, such as lead or mercury * Cancer chemotherapy * General anesthesia (use local or spinal anesthesia whenever possible) * Health issues with the organs of detoxification —liver, kidneys, skin, or gut * Handling cash register receipts (plastic coating can get through your skin)M – Mental health: Untreated problems ranging from chronic stress and anxiety tobipolar disorder and addictions are associated with cognitive impairment andearly death.MENTAL HEALTH RISKS THAT DRAIN YOUR BRAIN * Chronic stress * Depression * Anxiety disorders * Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) * Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) * Bipolar disorder * Schizophrenia * Addictions (drugs, alcohol, sex)* * Gadget addiction* * Negative thinkingI – Immunity/Infection issues: These are common but often unrecognized causes ofbrain dysfunction.IMMUNITY/INFECTION RISKS THAT DRAIN YOUR BRAIN * Chronic fatigue syndrome * Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and lupus * Untreated infections, such as Lyme disease, syphilis, and herpes * Hiking* where you may be bitten by a tick * Low vitamin D levelN – Neurohormone deficiencies: When your hormone levels are unbalanced, yourbrain is too.NEUROHORMONE DEFICIENCIES THAT DRAIN YOUR BRAIN * Low or high thyroid * Low testosterone (males and females) * Low estrogen and progesterone (females) * Low DHEA * High cortisol levels * Hormone disruptors, such as BPA, phthalates, parabens, and pesticides * Protein* from animals raised with hormones or antibiotics that can disrupt your hormones * Sugar,* which disrupts hormonesD – Diabesity: The term describes a combination of being diabetic or prediabeticand being overweight or obese. The standard American diet is a major cause ofdiabesity, which contributes to chronically high blood sugar levels. These hurtblood vessels and cause inflammation and hormone disruption as well as thestorage of toxins —all of which damage the brain.DIABESITY RISKS THAT DRAIN YOUR BRAIN * Diabetes or prediabetes * High fasting blood sugar or HbA1c (hemoglobin A1c) * Being overweight or obese * Standard American diet* of processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats * Drinking fruit juice* (high in sugar)S – Sleep issues: All sleep problems are a major cause of brain dysfunction, butespecially chronic insomnia and sleep apnea. When you sleep, your brain cleansesitself of debris. Without proper sleep, trash builds up, harming the brain.SLEEP ISSUES THAT DRAIN YOUR BRAIN * Chronic insomnia * Chronic use of sleep medication* * Sleep apnea * Drinking/eating caffeinated drinks or food after 2 p.m.* * Sleeping in a warm room * Light or noise at night * Gadgets* that wake you up * Irregular sleep schedule * Anger or upset before bedWhatever you want in life, it is easier to achieve when your brain works right.It is important to have the right attitude as you make these changes. You don’tavoid things in order to deprive yourself. You avoid things that hurt your brainbecause it is the ultimate act of love —for yourself and others.“BUT HOW CAN I HAVE ANY FUN?”For the past 13 years, Dr. Jesse Payne and I have taught a high school course wecreated called “Brain Thrive by 25” that teaches teens how to love and care fortheir brains. It has now been taught in 42 states and 7 countries. Independentresearch in 16 schools found it decreased drug, alcohol, and tobacco use as wellas depression, and improved self-esteem. Whenever we teach the section of thecourse on things to avoid to have a healthy brain, invariably a teenageboy —rarely a girl —will raise his hand and ask, “But how can I have any fun?”Whenever we get this question, we play a game with the teens called “Who hasmore fun? The teen with the good brain or the one with the bad brain?” Irecently gave a lecture to 7,000 high school students and their parents at theCongress of Future Physicians. These were high-performing teens who wanted tobecome physicians. I played this game with them and asked the crowd, “Who getsinto the college of his choice . . . the teen with the good brain or the onewith the bad brain?”In unison, they screamed, “The teen with the good brain.”I then asked, “Who gets the girl and gets to keep her because he doesn’t actlike a jerk . . . the guy with the good brain or the one with the bad brain?”The girls in the arena roared with approval, “The guy with the good brain.”I then wondered, “Who gets the best jobs and keeps them . . . the woman with thegood brain or the one with the bad brain?”“The woman with the good brain” was the answer that came back to me.“Who makes the most money . . . the person with the good brain or the one withthe bad brain?” I asked.“The person with the good brain,” they agreed.“Who is the best parent . . . the dad or mom with the good brain or the one withthe bad brain?”“The dad or mom with the good brain,” they shouted.And finally, I said, “Who takes the coolest vacations, drives the coolest cars,and has the most meaning and purpose in their lives?”“The ones with the good brains,” they roared.Then I told them about one of my celebrity friends whom I had helped to quitsmoking pot 12 weeks earlier. The week before the lecture, I texted her thisquestion: “Are you having more fun with your good habits or with the bad ones?”She texted me right back, “Ha! Good! By a billion!”STRATEGY #3: ENGAGE IN REGULAR BRAIN-HEALTHY HABITS.Now that you know what risk factors to avoid, it is critical that you developdiscipline around building the best daily habits. I’ll discuss them in thecontext of our BRIGHT MINDS program, starting with several overarching habitsyou will want to adopt.GENERAL STRATEGIES * Worry —a little. According to research, people whose motto is “Don’t worry; be happy” die the earliest from accidents or preventable illnesses. Some anxiety is good. Obviously too much is bad, but so is too little. * Make yourself less vulnerable to poor decisions. Ultimately, the quality of your decisions determines the health of your brain and body. Be sure to have clear goals, get seven hours of sleep every night, and keep your blood sugar on an even keel by eating protein and fat at every meal. Low blood sugar levels are associated with poor decisions. * Identify your daily motivation. In chapter 8 I’ll introduce what I call the “One-Page Miracle,” which you can look at every day for inspiration and focus. * Select a healthy peer group. You become like the people with whom you spend time, and being with healthy people is a good way to develop brain envy.FEEL BETTER FAST NOW AND LATER TIP: Find the healthiest person you can stand andthen spend as much time around him or her as possible.B - SIMPLE BRAIN-HEALTHY HABITS TO IMPROVE BRAIN BLOOD FLOW5 to 60 minutes.

Tomatoes have been shown to help mood. * Learn to meditate, especially the Loving-Kindness Meditation (see chapter 1, page 21 [chapter_1.xhtml#page_21]), which has been shown to increase energy to the brain * Go for a walk in nature (or at least outdoors) * Use brighter lights, especially full spectrum bulbs that have ultraviolet radiation similar to the sun’s[87] * If natural interventions are not effective, work with a local therapist or psychiatrist * Kill the ANTs (automatic negative thoughts; see chapter 5, pages 99–100 [chapter_5.xhtml#page_99]): Whenever you feel mad, sad, nervous, or out of control, write down your negative thoughts and learn to talk back to them * Take supplements: s-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe), saffron, and omega-3s to support mood; 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) if you are a worrierFEEL BETTER FAST NOW AND LATER TIP: When your mood is low, take a walk in naturewhile drinking vegetable juice.I - SIMPLE BRAIN-HEALTHY HABITS TO IMPROVE YOUR IMMUNITY * If you are struggling with brain fog or memory issues, consider being tested for exposure to infectious diseases * Do an elimination diet for a month to see if you have food allergies, which can damage your immune system * Eat immunity-enhancing foods, such as onions, mushrooms, and garlic * Watch a comedy or go to a comedy club to boost energy[88] and immunity * Take supplements: vitamin D (know and optimize your level), aged garlic, and vitamin CFEEL BETTER FAST NOW AND LATER TIP: Eat a stir-fry with onions, garlic,mushrooms, and a protein; skip the rice.N - SIMPLE BRAIN-HEALTHY HABITS TO IMPROVE YOUR NEUROHORMONES * Have your hormones tested on a regular basis * Add fiber to eliminate unhealthy forms of estrogen * For women: Optimize estrogen for brain health * Consider hormone replacement when necessary * Take supplements: zinc (to help boost testosterone) and ashwagandha (to reduce cortisol and support the thyroid)FEEL BETTER FAST NOW AND LATER TIP: Lift weights and eliminate sugar to helpraise your testosterone level.D - SIMPLE BRAIN-HEALTHY HABITS TO DECREASE YOUR RISK OF DIABESITY AND IMPROVEYOUR WEIGHT AND BLOOD SUGAR * Maintain a healthy weight; lose weight slowly if you are overweight (develop lifelong habits) * Eat a brain-healthy diet (see chapter 9, page 203 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_203]) * Anti-inflammatory and colorful foods * Low-glycemic, high-fiber carbs * Protein and fat at each meal (to stabilize blood sugar and cravings) * Healing spices * Know your body mass index (BMI) now and check it monthly * Flavor dishes with cinnamon and nutmeg * Chew sugar-free gum to boost oxygen and blood flow to your brain[89] * Take supplements: chromium picolinate and alpha-lipoic acid (to decrease cravings and support healthy blood sugar levels)FEEL BETTER FAST NOW AND LATER TIP: Sniff a cinnamon stick or peppermint.S - SIMPLE BRAIN-HEALTHY HABITS TO IMPROVE YOUR SLEEP * If you snore, get assessed for sleep apnea * Put blue-light blockers on your gadgets * Turn off gadgets or keep them away from your head at night * Cool your home a bit before bedtime * Darken your bedroom * Maintain a regular sleep schedule * Listen to a hypnosis sleep audio * Take supplements: melatonin and magnesium; 5-HTP (if worrying keeps you up)FEEL BETTER FAST NOW AND LATER TIP: At bedtime, put the scent of lavender nearbyand listen to a hypnosis sleep audio.I’ve given you a lot of strategies here, but I want you to come away feelingempowered, not overwhelmed. You can make so many small daily decisions toimprove your brain health. They are within your reach! Start with just a few andadd from there.Meanwhile, keep that key question in mind as you go through each day: Is thisgood for my brain, or bad for it? Choosing what’s good for your brain is the wayto feel better fast.THREE KEY BRAIN HEALTH STRATEGIES 1. Develop brain envy. 2. Avoid anything that hurts your brain. 3. Engage in regular brain-healthy habits to create a strong foundation for success. For now, pick one new BRIGHT MINDS habit a week to plant into your life.Never forget: * Rule #1 of brain health is Never lose brain cells. * Rule #2 of brain health is Never forget rule #1.The health of your brain is foundational to feeling better fast —now and later.Love and take care of your brain, so you can love your life.TINY HABITS THAT CAN HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FAST—AND LEAD TO BIG CHANGES30 seconds to 20 minutes. [images/x30-sec-20-min.jpg]Each of these habits takes just a few minutes. They are anchored to somethingyou do (or think or feel) so that they are more likely to become automatic. Onceyou do the behaviors you want, find a way to make yourself feel good aboutthem—draw a happy face, pump your fist, or do whatever feels natural. Emotionhelps the brain to remember. 1. When I have used the bathroom, I will drink a glass of water (blood flow). 2. After I hang up my car keys, I will learn a new chord on my instrument (retirement/new learning). 3. When I finish brushing my teeth before bed, I will floss (inflammation). 4. After I open the refrigerator, I will grab a handful of organic blueberries (genetics). 5. When I go downstairs, I will hold the handrail (head trauma). 6. When I pump gas, I will stand away from the nozzle so I don’t breathe fumes (toxins). 7. When I am feeling sad, I will take a walk in nature (mental health). 8. When I prepare vegetables for dinner, I will add garlic and onions to the mix (immunity). 9. When I go to the salad bar, I will get a half cup of beans (neurohormones). 10. When I eat dinner, I will add one colorful vegetable to my plate (diabesity). 11. After I get into bed, I will listen to a hypnosis sleep audio (sleep).Diagram titled 'Feel better fast. Which strategies will you choose?'

It assists you in directing your behavior toward yourgoals and braking when it starts to get out of control. The PFC is the leader inyou and is arguably the most important part of your brain when it comes tomaking the decisions that will help you feel better fast and make it last.Neuroscientists call the PFC the executive part of the brain because itfunctions as the chief executive officer of your life. When it is healthy, thisboss in your head is goal-oriented, focused, organized, thoughtful, andsimultaneously present- and future-oriented; exhibits good judgment; learns frommistakes; and is able to control your impulses. When this part of the brain ishurt, for whatever reason, it is as if the leader in your head has gone onvacation (when the cat’s away, the mice will play), and you are more likely toact in impulsive, ineffective, irresponsible, or abusive ways. This not onlyhurts you but can hurt others as well. Healing the PFC can therefore help youand those around you —colleagues, employees, your kids —feel better fast. Inthis chapter, we’ll explore how the PFC develops and how to protect andstrengthen it.The PFC is proportionally larger in humans than it is in any other animal byfar. It represents 30 percent of a human’s brain, 11 percent of a chimpanzee’sbrain, 7 percent of a dog’s brain, 3 percent of a cat’s brain (which is why catsneed nine lives), and one percent of a mouse’s brain. The PFC is the part ofyour brain that makes you human. It is involved in the following executivefunctions: * Focus * Forethought * Planning * Judgment * Decision-making * Organization * Follow-through * Empathy * Learning from mistakes * Problem-solving * Expressive language * Impulse control * Saying no to behaviors inconsistent with goals * Conscientiousness —e.g., consistently showing up when you say you willTHE PREFRONTAL CORTEXSide view of the brain with an arrow pointing to the lower front region.[images/Illustration-3.1.jpg]Pinocchio’s Jiminy Cricket embodies the role of the PFC. Near the opening of themovie, the Blue Fairy dubs Jiminy “Pinocchio’s conscience, lord high keeper ofthe knowledge of right and wrong, counselor in moments of high temptation, andguide along the straight and narrow path.” Jiminy’s job is to help Pinocchiowork toward his goal of becoming a real boy. When Jiminy is away from Pinocchio,the wooden boy nearly loses his life from a series of bad decisions. Similarly,not having a healthy PFC costs many people their success in life and, in somecases, their very lives. The PFC supervises you. It is the small voice in yourhead or the angel on your shoulder encouraging you to do the right thing and toreach the goals that are most important to you. When your PFC is hurt or itsactivity level is low (as it often is in people who have attention deficithyperactivity disorder, or ADHD), your impulses —the devil on the other shoulderwhispering in your ear to do the wrong thing that feels right in the moment —aremore likely to win. Before we look at the differences between a healthy and atroubled PFC, here is a quick overview of how this brain region develops.THE BRAIN’S LATE BLOOMERBrain development is a fascinating construction tale, where genes andenvironment work together to make us who we are. At times during pregnancy, thefetus’s brain produces 250,000 new cells per minute. Babies are born with 100billion neurons; however, only a relatively small number of those neurons areconnected. About three-quarters of the brain develops outside the womb, inresponse to our environment and experience. Nature and nurture always worktogether. Brain development is especially rapid during the first few years oflife. By age three, a toddler’s brain has formed close to 1,000 trillionconnections —about twice as many connections as adults have. Between the ages of3 and 10 is a time of rapid social, intellectual, emotional, and physicaldevelopment. Brain activity in this age group is more than twice that of adults,and although new synaptic connections continue to be formed throughout life,never again will the brain be as capable of easily mastering new skills oradapting to setbacks.The abundance of connections helps explain why it is generally easier forchildren to learn languages and music. Young children are able to learn justabout any language and how to play musical instruments more easily than adults,even though adults often have more motivation. With age, the number ofconnections decreases, which helps to explain why it becomes harder to pick upan instrument, acquire languages, lose native accents, and even roll our r’s!On the next page is a graph of activity in the prefrontal cortex across thelifespan, based on more than 70,000 scans we’ve done at Amen Clinics. You cansee that, on average, a child’s PFC is very active. In this case, that does notmean better function but is more akin to unbridled activity. However, over timethe activity begins to settle down and work more efficiently for two mainreasons: pruning and myelination.PREFRONTAL CORTEX ACTIVITY OVER THE LIFE SPANGraph showing a sharp rise in activity from birth to age 6 and then a gradualdecrease till it flattens around age 40 at a little over half the originalheight of the line. Then there are some short spikes in the 70s and a small arcthrough the 80s and 90s. [images/Illustration-3.2.jpg]Pruning shears. [images/Illustration-3.3.jpg]In the first years of life, the brain has an abundance of cells, connections,and possibilities. As we age, our brains begin the pruning process, eliminatingconnections that are unnecessary, incorrect, or not being stimulated, in orderto strengthen and enhance the connections that are being used. Pruning helps thebrain become more efficient, similar to the effect of pruning on plants, butit’s crucial that the right things get pruned. As you can see in the graph(“Prefrontal Cortex Activity over the Life Span” above), at around age seven,PFC activity begins to decrease at a rapid rate. That’s because the brain hasbegun to prune extraneous connections. The brain is one of the best examples ofthe “use it or lose it” principle. Connections that are used repeatedly in theearly years become permanent, while those that are not used are pruned. This iswhy it’s important for children to be raised in an enriched environment. Itallows them to keep more of the tracks in their brains since the brainstrengthens what is used and eliminates the unstimulated connections.Experience, opportunity, and stress all influence how much pruning takes place.At the same time pruning is occurring, brain cells are being wrapped with awhite fatty substance called myelin that works like insulation on copper wires.Myelination helps nerve cells work 10 to 100 times faster. A myelinated cell ismuch more efficient, which is another reason why the PFC becomes less activefrom about the age of 7 to 25 (seen on the graph) as myelination progresses.Diagram of an unmyelinated neuron and a myelinated one. The myelin appears as astring of nodules covering the long, thin part of the neuron.[images/Illustration-3.4.jpg]Myelination starts in the back of the brain and over time works its way to thefront. In infants, the cerebellum (coordination center) and occipital lobes(vision) develop first, which support balance, coordination, speech, vision, andmotor movements. During this time, young ones are learning how to crawl, walk,and talk. The parietal lobes, at the top back part of the brain, develop more inthe elementary school years. They’re involved with throwing and catching ballsand the ability to read and solve math problems. During the teenage years, thelimbic or emotional brain becomes much more active. The limbic system isinvolved with feelings, bonding, and friendships. The PFC is the last part ofthe brain to develop, and it continues during late adolescence and into the mid-to late twenties. Healthy myelination of the PFC is also associated withintelligence, attention, processing speed, reaction time, musical ability, andworking memory.Anything that disrupts myelin formation can delay or damage brain development.Here are the main culprits: * Smoking * Alcohol * Drug use * Depression * ADHD * Brain trauma * Toxins or infections * Inflammation * Poor diet * Low omega-3 levels * Low vitamins B12, C, or D * Low zinc * Low total cholesterol * Low-fat diet (myelin is 80 percent fat) * Excessive stress * Limited exercise * Less-than-optimal sleepEven though we think of 18-year-olds as adults, their brain development is farfrom finished. Myelin continues to be deposited in the PFC until age 25 or 26,making the executive part of the brain work at a higher, more efficient level.Were you more mature at 25 than at 18? I sure was. It is ironic that the carinsurance industry knew about maturity and brain development long before societydid. When do car insurance rates change? At age 25. Why? Because that is whenpeople display better driving judgment and are statistically less likely to getinto accidents, which means they cost insurance companies less money.MYELINATION STARTS FROM THE BACK AND GOES FORWARDDiagram of the brain with an arrow sweeping from the lower rear over the toptoward the front. [images/Illustration-3.5.jpg]It is critical for more people to be aware that brain development continues intoearly adulthood. In addiction medicine, it is common for therapists to say ateen’s development becomes arrested at the age he or she started to use drugs.If a teen starts abusing alcohol, drugs, or both at age 15 and doesn’t stopuntil he is 30, emotionally, as a 30-year-old, he will seem about the same as a15-year-old. Teenage and early adult smoking and drug or alcohol abuse, as wellas brain injuries from contact sports, all have the potential to disrupt braindevelopment —in some cases permanently.One of neurologist Sigmund Freud’s concepts that has proved useful is that humanpersonality is made up of the id, the ego, and the superego. The id is our childmind that wants what it wants when it wants it; the ego is our healthy adultmind; and the superego is the parent inside our heads telling us what we shouldand should not do. Effective CEOs have healthy egos. If their superegos are toostrong, they are likely to be punitive micromanagers who hold on to hurts. Iftheir ids are in control (which means their PFCs are less active), they may bechasing the secretary around the office. They’re not working effectively but areletting the child within run things.To keep the PFC healthy, you have to stop poisoning the brain. Frequent happyhours will not help to build a healthy ego or PFC. I have never understood whybusiness events are typically filled with alcohol. After all, the business oflife is about brain function. If you’re constantly diminishing brain function,over time your life is less likely to be what you want it to be.THE ROLE OF THE PFCA helpful analogy for understanding the PFC is to imagine yourself at the top ofa mountain road in the Colorado Rockies. It’s winter, and you’re in ahigh-performance sports car, such as a Lamborghini, Porsche, or Ferrari. Yourgoal is to get to the bottom of the mountain safely, while enjoying the ridealong the way. To navigate the miles of steep, winding roads and hairpin turns,effective brakes are a must. When the brakes are worn or damaged, you are muchmore likely to get into a serious accident. Brakes help the car and driveradjust to whatever situation presents itself —wind, rain, snow, ice, and otherdrivers who may be sleep-deprived or may have had too much to drink. A healthyPFC serves the same function as the car’s brakes, allowing you to safelynavigate life, adjusting to whatever situations arise. This brain region isespecially critical during the stressful or scary turns in life. When the PFC ishurt or too low in activity, the brakes are weak, and all sorts of problemsarise. For one, you are more likely to figuratively skid off the road youintended to be on. And when the PFC works too hard, as it often does inobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the brakes are always on, stopping anyprogress down the mountain or in your life.Photo of a curving mountain road in winter. [images/Illustration-3.6.jpg]You need brakes when driving on a dangerous Colorado mountain road.PROBLEMS WITH THE PFCWhen the PFC is hurt or damaged for whatever reason, people often struggle with * Short attention span * Distractibility * Poor planning * Lack of perseverance * Impulsivity * Erratic decision-making * Chronic lateness and poor time management * Disorganization * Procrastination * Difficulty being in touch with their emotions * Trouble expressing feelings * Poor judgment * Lack of empathy * Trouble learning from experience * Saying yes too often * Lack of conscientiousnessWith these issues, there is also a higher incidence of * School failure * Divorce * Job failure * Legal issues * Speeding tickets * Incarceration * Financial problems * Mental health issues, especially ADHD and addictionsAs you can see, protecting your PFC means protecting your ability to feel goodnow and later.The brain is a sneaky organ. We all have weird, crazy, stupid, sexual, violentthoughts that no one should ever hear. The PFC protects us from allowing thosesenseless thoughts to escape our mouths or stops our fingers from pressing thesend button on an inappropriate or unhelpful e-mail, text, or tweet.Several years ago, while attending a medical conference, I was sitting in theback of the room with a friend I’ll call Joelle. As I mentioned in MemoryRescue, Joelle had been in a car accident a few years earlier. She had beenstopped at a traffic light when a pickup truck going 70 miles per hour plowedinto the back of her BMW. The driver’s-side airbag deployed, but the violentimpact of the rear-end collision and the airbag crashing against Joelle’s headslammed her soft, gelatin-like brain against the front part of her skull,ripping blood vessels and bruising and damaging her PFC. From the time of theaccident, Joelle’s reactions were unfiltered, and she was much more likely tosay anything that came into her mind. Often it was funny, but sometimes it couldbe very hurtful. Before the medical conference session started, two obese womensitting in front of us were discussing their weight. One woman said to theother, “I don’t know why I’m overweight; I just eat like a bird.”Joelle looked at me and said, loud enough for everyone around us to hear, “Yeah,like a condor.” My face immediately turned red, and I looked at Joelle incomplete embarrassment. Horrified, she put her hand to her mouth and said, “Ohno, did that get out?”“Yes.” I nodded.“I’m so sorry,” she said as the women moved away from us.While I was writing this chapter, one of my friends got an inappropriate textfrom a consultant employed by her investment firm. They had worked together formore than a year without incident. But one evening when the consultant had toomuch to drink, he texted her, “Please send sexy pics.” Shocked, my friend endedthe consultancy. The man lost a high-paying job because his PFC went ontemporary leave. When the cat’s away . . .I once had lunch with a close friend who was having marital problems. I knewChuck had ADHD, which is associated with low PFC function, and was struggling athome in his relationships with his wife and children. As usual, Chuck wastelling me about the turmoil in his life. All of a sudden his affect changed,his eyes brightened, his tone became more excited, and in a hushed voice he toldme about a woman he had recently met on an airplane. She was pretty, smart, andinteresting, and she seemed to like him a lot. She had even come to his officefor a visit. As he started to go on, I interrupted him.“Chuck, do you like attorneys?”“What do you mean?” he said, looking surprised.“Play it out,” I said. “You’re having marital problems, you meet this attractivewoman who seems interested in you, and she’s been to your office. The next step,if it hasn’t happened already, is you are going to have an affair. Your wifewill likely find out, and she will never forgive you. She’ll file for divorce.You’ll spend a lot of money on attorneys and hate yourself for putting yourfamily through your betrayal. Then, a year from now, you will have lost halfyour net worth and be visiting your children on the weekends. Plus, they will beupset that you betrayed them, too.”“Wow,” Chuck said, looking deflated. “I never thought about it like that.”“That is what your prefrontal cortex does for you,” I said. “It plays thingsout.”Chuck later told me that he never called the woman back. The cat was back.THOUGHTFULNESS, CONSIDERATION, AND LOVEA fascinating lesson from our brain imaging work is that when I help mypatients’ brains function better, especially the PFC, they are significantlymore thoughtful, considerate, and loving.Bryan called himself “the anger broker of the San Fernando Valley.” He came tosee me after he got out of the hospital following a serious suicide attempt. Twoweeks earlier his wife had served him with divorce papers; that night he lockedhimself in a closed garage with his car running. When the paramedics broke in torescue him, he screamed obscenities at them. And when I first met Bryan, he wascondescending and hostile to my office staff and then to me. I listenedpatiently for the first hour, then told him that if he wanted me to help him, hehad to get scanned. I was not going to put up with his abuse for long and had nointention of allowing him to abuse our staff, so we had to get him the best helpquickly. While Bryan was being scanned, he even complained about Mike, ouramazing scan technologist, which was a first.Bryan’s PFC was clearly damaged, including on the left side, which tends to bethe happier side of the brain. Damage to the left PFC is often associated withdepression, irritability, and aggression. We put him on our BRIGHT MINDS brainrehabilitation program (see chapter 2, pages 39–44 [chapter_2.xhtml#page_39]),which included supplements, HBOT (hyperbaric oxygen therapy), and dietarychanges, and after three months the differences in both his behavior and hisscan were stunning. He literally became one of the nicest people I’ve known. Hestill brings our staff gifts and talks to them with gratitude and love. Whenyour brain works right —especially the PFC —you work right.BRYAN’S INITIAL SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-3.7.jpg]Low PFC activityAFTER TREATMENT SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing uniform blood flow. [images/Illustration-3.8.jpg]Overall improvementCONSCIENTIOUSNESS AND LONGEVITYOne of the executive functions of a healthy PFC is conscientiousness, and itspayoff can be a longer life. We know this thanks to the remarkable work of Dr.Lewis Terman, a Stanford University psychologist who studied 1,548 brightchildren who were roughly 10 years old in 1921 when Terman’s research began.Now, more than 90 years later, the long-term study has produced a treasure troveof insights linking healthy brain function to longevity.[90]On the positive side, thoughtful planning, hard work, perseverance, andaccomplishing goals were all associated with longevity in the study. Prudent,persistent achievers who had stable families and social support (all signs of ahealthy brain) also lived longer. And those who did the best on long-lifemeasures had habits, routines, and social networks that encouraged exercise.Clearly, your social relationships have an impact on your health, andassociating with others who are healthy is one way to improve your ownwell-being.On the negative side, participants who were most disappointed with theirachievements died the youngest. In fact, a lack of success and dependability inone’s career (a common sign of a low-functioning PFC) was linked with a hugeincrease in mortality. How one reacted to a loss also affected longevity: If theloss led to drinking, depression, anxiety, or catastrophizing (exacerbating poorbrain function), an early death was often the result; but if instead the lossled to renewed zest for life after a period of grief (thanks to employingbrain-healthy recovery skills), the result was a five-year longevity boostbeyond the average.In one of the more intriguing findings, the study showed that people with acarefree outlook underestimated risks and tended to die early from accidents andpreventable illnesses. While this finding has often been taken to mean thatpessimists outlive optimists, the truth is that optimists who work hard and aremore careful tend to live longer than average. It’s only the optimists who don’tworry, plan, or think about the consequences of their actions who wind up dyingsooner. Worry, as it turns out, is a necessary function for staying healthy ifit means that you care and think about the future. My clinical experience backsup this observation. A moderate level of anxiety is a good thing. Of course, toomuch anxiety is not good, but not having enough is connected with takingunreasonable risks that can harm health and safety.LEADERSHIPThe brain is involved in everything we do, including how we think, feel, act,and get along with others. Leadership is all about people —managing and guidingtheir brains, minds, thoughts, actions, and behavior. Yet in graduate schools ofbusiness, where people train to be leaders, there is very little formaleducation about the brain.In his groundbreaking book Emotional Intelligence, Daniel Goleman listed fivetraits leaders should have; all five involve your PFC. First is self-awareness.Unless you, as a leader, understand yourself, it will be hard for you tounderstand others. Next is self-regulation, which is knowing how to manage yourown internal state, your impulses, and your resources. Third is motivation,which involves handling and controlling your emotional tendencies and which, inturn, guides and facilitates interactions with people (a combination of youremotional brain and PFC). Then there is empathy, which is the awareness of otherpeople’s needs and concerns. Finally comes social skills, which help leadersadapt to the various environments they find themselves in. Other leaders havediscussed perseverance; integrity (listening to the angel on your shoulder); andcautious, thoughtful risk-taking —all characteristic of a healthy PFC —as traitsthat have helped them succeed.Self-regulation —being able to manage your impulses —is critical to leadingothers and yourself. Leaders who lack good impulse control may get hit with asexual harassment suit or make decisions that put their businesses at risk. ThePFC also learns from mistakes —which is a key leadership trait since leadersmake a lot of mistakes. Many of the world’s best leaders are proud of theirmistakes because they learned critical lessons from them. If you make a mistakeand you learn from it, you will be a better leader. If you make a mistake butdeny it, and instead of looking at it you just put it in a corner somewhere inyour mind, odds are you’re going to repeat it.PROTECT YOUR PFCUnderstanding and optimizing PFC development is critical to raising healthyhumans, which is why protecting it needs to be one of society’s main priorities.In particular, the PFC needs to be protected from head trauma, toxins (such asalcohol and marijuana), gadget addiction, lack of sleep, low-quality diets, andchronic stress. (For more risk factors to avoid, see chapter 2, pages 33–37[chapter_2.xhtml#page_33].)STOP THE INSANITY OF CHILDREN HITTING THEIR HEADS AGAINST HELMETS AND SOCCERBALLSThe US Soccer Federation recently banned children under the age of 11 fromhitting soccer balls with their heads (it’s actually called “heading”). This isclear progress, as the PFC sits right behind the forehead and is easily damagedby repetitive blows to the head. However, when I heard about the ban, Iwondered, Don’t they like kids who are 11 to 25? Why 11, when we know the PFC isnot finished developing until 25 in females, and a bit later in males? Societychanges slowly, often to its detriment.Flying soccer balls are a real menace. It is estimated that a ball that’s beenkicked hard can impact a player’s head with a force of 175 pounds! Children orteens meet that missile with their skulls, slamming their PFCs against thesharp, bony ridges of the skull’s frontal bones. Does that sound like a goodidea when we all need our PFCs for the rest of our lives so that we can be goodworkers, parents, and grandparents? Here’s the story of one young man who made asmarter choice.WILL: TOO MANY HEAD WHACKSWill, age 16, played soccer at an advanced level. He was so good, he even playedin Europe for a year. But after he sustained his fourth concussion from beingkicked in the head, he had to take off a whole year from school. He wasirritable, moody, and easily distracted, and he started making poor decisions.His parents were very concerned when they brought him to the clinic. His SPECTscan showed significant damage to his PFC, in the front of his brain, and damageto his occipital lobes in the back. The brain is housed in a closed space. If itgets hit on one side, it slams against the other side, causing what is called acoup-contrecoup injury (see illustration on page 60 [chapter_3.xhtml#page_60]).Even though Will desperately wanted to continue playing the game he loved, hedecided to stop. He told me, “I love soccer, but I know I’ll love my future wifeand children more. I have to do a better job of protecting my brain.” Using therehabilitation protocol we developed at Amen Clinics, Will did much better overtime and returned to school. His mood, irritability, and decision-makingdramatically improved.WILL’S SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-3.9.jpg]The holes indicate damage to the front and back of his brain.Diagram showing the process of brain injury during a head collision. The coupinjury happens as the brain moves forward to hit the front of the skull. Thecontrecoup injury happens as the brain rebounds and hits the back of the skull.[images/Illustration-3.10.jpg]Other common PFC-damaging activities include football, cheerleading, hockey,horseback riding, and trail biking, among others. According to a new study onmore than 13,000 teens, 20 percent reported a concussion at some point in theirlives.[91] One of the most important lessons I’ve learned from looking at nearly150,000 scans is that mild traumatic brain injury can ruin people’s lives.Concussions that affect the PFC can permanently decrease a person’s executivefunction unless it is fully rehabilitated. It is vitally important to makeprotecting our children’s and young adults’ PFCs a priority.SIX STRATEGIES TO STRENGTHEN YOUR INTERNAL CEOConsider the metaphor of the elephant and the rider. The PFC is the rider —thethoughtful part of your brain that attempts to direct your life. The limbicsystem, where your pleasure centers are housed, is the elephant —the powerful,emotional part of you that drives your impulses and desires. As long as theelephant wants to go where the rider directs him, things work fine. But when theelephant wants to go in a different direction, who is going to win thattug-of-war? Most bets are on the elephant. Cravings (elephant) are oftencontrolled by the PFC (rider) when things are going well, but if the elephant isspooked or becomes nervous or afraid, it can take control. (Think of a foodbinge.) Keeping the rider healthy, strong, and strategic is critical to stayingin control of your life.How do we integrate the rider and the elephant so that our PFCs and limbicbrains, our goals and desires, and our thoughts and behaviors are more in sync?We do it by being purposeful with our goals and strengthening our PFCs throughcontinual training. Here are six strategies to strengthen your executivefunction, which is instrumental in helping you make good decisions, overcomeanxiety, negativity, anger, and stress —and feel better fast.STRATEGY #1: LEARN TO SAY NO TO YOURSELF.Experiments starting in the 1960s reveal how critical a healthy PFC is, even atan early age. These studies have focused on the concept of delayedgratification —being able to wait for a reward. One trial that psychologistWalter Mischel used involved preschoolers and marshmallows. The children weretold that they could either eat the marshmallow in front of them immediately orwait for a few minutes and get two. Some kids were unable to wait and ate themarshmallow straight off, while others used tactics like clapping their hands orturning their backs on the one marshmallow to resist. After following thechildren for 14 years, Mischel found that those who had waited —delayinggratification —had higher self-esteem, better coping skills for stress andfrustration, higher academic performance (with SAT scores that weresignificantly higher, on average), and greater social skills than the childrenwho had been unable to wait.[92] (There are reenactments of this landmark workon YouTube; search for “marshmallow test.”)Similarly, a more recent test with raisins predicted how 20-month-oldtoddlers —some of whom had been born prematurely, making them more likely tohave PFC issues —would perform at the age of eight.[93] The toddlers were testedon how long they could wait before picking up raisins that had been placed underan opaque plastic cup. They were given several training sessions and then askedto wait until they were told that 60 seconds had passed before they retrievedthe raisins. Kids who had been born prematurely were more likely to eat theraisins before the full minute elapsed, and those who couldn’t control theirbehavior were likelier to struggle in school seven years later. Unless theylearn how to delay gratification or someone helps them rehab their brains, it’salso likely that those kids will continue to struggle for the rest of theirlives.The PFC is like a muscle: You have to use it so you don’t lose its power to helpyou exercise patience and make good decisions. Fortunately, you can learnhow —there’s even proof in Mischel’s follow-up studies. He asked adults todemonstrate delayed gratification to the preschoolers, using several tactics tokeep themselves from eating the lone marshmallow. When the kids were put to thetest again and had to resist their impulses, those who had previously grabbedthe single marshmallow used the strategies they had just seen the adultspractice, successfully “earning” two marshmallows through their patience. Later,the same kids performed similarly to the ones who had a natural ability to delaygratification.[94]Kids can learn to develop their PFCs —and you can too. In fact, it’s duringchildhood that the majority of us learn how to exercise our PFCs. We ask ourparents if we can do things that aren’t good for us, such as riding a bikewithout a helmet or eating a lot of sweets, and when their answer is no, welearn how to say no to ourselves. But if you grew up with absent parents, youmight not have learned the self-control to say no. Or if one or both of yourparents struggled with drugs or alcohol, you might have learned instead to givein to your impulses. You might even have lost your ability to say no because ofyour own addiction.Saying no to yourself is like being a loving parent —to yourself. Giving in toyour bad behavior, whether it’s eating too much junk food or channel surfinginstead of exercising, can ruin your health and lead to premature death. But ifyou practice saying no, effectively strengthening your willpower and your PFC,you will find it easier to continue to do so over time. By exercising your PFC,you are making and strengthening nerve cell connections in a process known aslong-term potentiation (LTP). Your brain makes new connections when you learnsomething new. Initially the connections are weak, but with practice —saying noto marijuana, candy, alcohol, lashing out at others, gambling, or using yoursmartphone incessantly —the PFC circuits in your brain are strengthened, orpotentiated. When that happens, behaviors become almost automatic —your brainmakes it easier to continue doing the right thing! Conversely, if you are ruledby your impulses, your willpower weakens, which makes it more likely that youwill continue to be impulsive.3 to 5 minutes. [images/x03-05-min.jpg]One strategy that can help you say no is to use distraction whenever you feeltempted to do something that’s outside your goals. Create a list of activitiesthat will distract you from giving in to the craving or behavior —things assimple as taking 10 deep breaths, humming to yourself, going for a brief walk,closing your eyes and focusing on your goals, or even playing the game Tetris onyour smartphone. Research has shown that just three minutes of Tetris decreasedcravings for food, drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, and coffee, as well as gaming andengaging in sex,[95] and the benefits lasted for the seven days of the study.STRATEGY #2: PRACTICE SAYING NO TO OTHERS.Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Great Britain, said, “The art ofleadership is saying no, not saying yes. It is very easy to say yes.” WarrenBuffett once said, “The difference between successful people and reallysuccessful people is that really successful people say no to almosteverything.”[96] My father, who was chairman of the board of a $4 billiongrocery business, always used to say no. I found it irritating when I was achild, but later I realized the wisdom of it. Saying no is like having effectivebrakes. In our fast-paced, distraction-filled society, our brakes are becomingweaker and weaker, and we say yes at a dizzying pace to the texts, tweets,posts, and e-mails that distract us from our purpose. Learning to say no to themundane is essential to being able to accomplish greatness in your life. If youwant high-performance results, you must be careful to spend your time wisely andonly pursue the most meaningful activities, no matter what others want you todo. Steve Jobs said, “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’vegot to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to thehundred other good ideas that there are.”[97]1 to 30 minutes. [images/x01-30-min.jpg]Many of my patients with ADHD, who have low PFC activity, don’t think beforethey act and often overcommit themselves by saying yes to too many things. Ihave them practice saying these words in front of the mirror: “I have to thinkabout it.” Whenever a friend or someone at church asks you to do something, say,“I have to think about it,” then go home and ask yourself if the request fits inwith the goals you have for your life. Odds are, the trouble that has occurredin your life is not from saying no, but from saying yes to things that were notfully thought through.Time is such a precious commodity today, with the constant bombardment ofdistractions. Learning to say no can help save your brain and your life. If theanswer to a request to spend your time is not an enthusiastic yes, the answershould probably be no.STRATEGY #3: STRENGTHEN YOUR DECISION-MAKING SKILLS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The best way to reduce stress in your life is to stop screwing up.ROY BAUMEISTER, PHD--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Making good decisions over and over for a lifetime often adds up to good healthand success. And when you have made lots and lots of bad decisions, the endresult can be struggles with your health and with success in life. You don’thave to be perfect and get every decision right, but the more healthy decisionsyou make, the better you are likely to look, feel, and act. A bonus is thatimproving self-control in one area of your life means improving it in otherareas. If you start walking every day, for example, you are also likely to starteating better.Use the following strategies to improve the functioning of your PFC, which inturn will boost the quality of your decisions: * Be clear about your goals. Define them (see the One-Page Miracle, pages 190–193 [chapter_8.xhtml#page_190]) and review them every day. * Decide on a few simple brain health rules ahead of time. It’s easier to stay the course when you have a plan. When you’re eating out, for example, you might decide to skip bread and alcohol before your meal (both lower PFC function and can negatively impact your decisions). Thinking ahead can also help you avoid putting yourself in vulnerable situations. If you are planning to attend a party where you know there could be heavy drinking, ask for a wine spritzer and top it up with club soda when it gets low. Be sure to have an exit strategy, too. * HALT poor judgment. In addiction medicine, we often use the acronym HALT in relapse prevention. Do not let yourself get too hungry (low blood sugar is associated with low blood flow to the PFC and more bad decisions), angry (anger lowers PFC function), lonely (being disconnected from others increases bad decisions), or tired (a lack of sleep is associated with low PFC function). All of these factors impair decision-making skills. * Cut out sugar and artificial sweeteners. They often trigger cravings and poor decisions.3 to 5 minutes. [images/x03-05-min.jpg] * Start a journal. Writing things down is an invaluable way to stay focused and on track. Recording what you eat is a well-known technique for boosting weight loss —doubling it in one Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research study.[98] Journaling helps reinforce the habits you want to strengthen until they become second nature. Within a matter of months, you can strengthen the brain circuits that will help you stay healthy for life. How can journaling do all this? The secret is in how you use your journal. If you notice you are struggling with food cravings or gambling, for example, a journal can help you pinpoint where you might have gone off track —if you skipped a meal, were under intense stress, or spent time with unhealthy people. Being able to recognize your vulnerable times allows you to develop strategies to overcome them. Note down your temptations and look for any patterns —time of day, amount of sleep or food, stress level, and more. Your mistakes are your best teachers, particularly if you let yourself explore them without judging yourself. Knowing what triggers your good decisions and your poor ones can help you become more self-aware.STRATEGY #4: PROTECT MYELINATION AND STOP LETTING CHILDREN HIT THINGS WITH THEIRHEADS.There are many healthy, enjoyable sports that will not compromise your child’sbrain health and future. Tennis, table tennis (my personal favorite), all formsof swimming, running, golf, and dance are wonderful ways to exercise a growingbody. Encourage your children to protect their PFCs and their future.STRATEGY #5: TO FEEL BETTER FAST, YOU HAVE TO GO SLOW.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Slow down, you move too fast.SIMON AND GARFUNKEL, “THE 59TH STREET BRIDGE SONG (FEELIN’ GROOVY)”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In our fast-paced society, it is often the person who can slow down, think abouthis or her goals, and act accordingly who ends up feeling better fast now andlater. Whenever you feel out of sorts, take 10 slow, deep belly breaths,identify your goal in your current situation, and choose the best option for nowand later. This simple, thoughtful strategy activates your PFC to calm youremotional brain. It helps you make better decisions and can even alleviateanxiety.[99]Behaviors you want to change must be practiced slowly, deliberately, andrepeatedly so that when you need them, you can implement them immediately. Aswith learning any new skill, it takes time for the brain to develop newcircuits. Be slow and patient when learning anything new.STRATEGY #6: TAKE SUPPLEMENTS TO SHARPEN YOUR FOCUS AND PFC.Supplements can help to support focus and executive function. These includerhodiola, green tea extract, L-theanine, ashwagandha, panax ginseng, ginkgobiloba, and phosphatidylserine. See chapter 10 for more information on each,including dosage considerations.NICK: A PFC PICK-ME-UP FOR A MIXED MARTIAL ARTISTNick, 25, was an MMA fighter who was brought to the clinic by his mother becausehe had been arrested after a drunken bar fight and now had started to expresssuicidal thoughts. I met him when I gave a lecture at the clinic. During thequestion-and-answer period, he told me I wouldn’t like his profession as an MMAfighter. I smiled and said I liked him but wished he wouldn’t put his brain atrisk of damage. Later that evening I reviewed Nick’s scan with him. It showedlow PFC and temporal lobe activity. I asked him if he wanted to do an experimentthe next day.I had just finished one of our studies on professional football players. AmenClinics did the first and largest brain imaging and rehabilitation study onactive and former NFL players. We saw high levels of damage on SPECT scans,especially to the PFC, temporal lobes, and cerebellum (which controls motor andthought coordination). This was not a surprise, as anyone who made it to the NFLin all likelihood had already played football for anywhere from 8 to 12 yearsand had been hit in the head thousands of times during games and practices. Theexciting news from our study was that when we worked to rehabilitate theirbrains through diet, exercise, and the principles in this book, 80 percent ofour players showed improvement, especially in blood flow to the PFC, temporallobes, and cerebellum, and in memory, mood, motivation, and sleep. Ourrehabilitation program also included a sophisticated combination of nutritionalsupplements (a high-level multivitamin, high-dose omega-3 fatty acids, andnutrients that supported brain function through a number of differentmechanisms, including ginkgo, rhodiola, ashwagandha, ginseng, andphosphatidylserine).I told Nick I knew the supplements worked, but I didn’t know how quickly. Isaid, “How about you come at 8 a.m. tomorrow, I will give them to you, and thenwe will scan you two and a half hours later at 10:30 a.m.” Nick was excited tosee if the supplements could help, and they did (see the before and after scansopposite). The second scan revealed a marked increase of blood flow to his wholebrain, especially the PFC and temporal lobes. This did not mean he was curedafter one dose of supplements; it meant that his brain had the potential torespond if he consistently put it in a healing environment and gave it thenutritional support it needed.Nick’s story is encouraging. If an MMA fighter with a history of brain traumacould see rapid improvement in PFC activity, you can see change too. Strengthenyour PFC and you’ll make better decisions and feel better fast.NICK’S BEFORE AND AFTER SPECT SCANS (TWO AND A HALF HOURS AFTER TAKINGSUPPLEMENTS)Surface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-3.11.jpg]Low PFC and temporal lobe activitySurface SPECT scan showing uniform blood flow. [images/Illustration-3.12.jpg]Improved PFC and temporal lobe activitySIX KEY STRATEGIES TO STRENGTHEN YOUR INTERNAL CEO 1. Learn to say no to yourself. 2. Practice saying no to others. 3. Strengthen your decision-making skills: * Be clear about your goals. * Decide on a few simple brain health rules ahead of time. * HALT poor judgment —don’t allow yourself to get too hungry, angry, lonely, or tired. * Cut out sugar and artificial sweeteners. * Start a journal. 4. Protect myelination and stop letting children hit things with their heads. 5. To feel better fast, you have to go slow. 6. Take supplements to sharpen your focus and PFC.TINY HABITS THAT CAN HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FAST—AND LEAD TO BIG CHANGES2 to 20 minutes. [images/x02-20-min.jpg]Each of these habits takes just a few minutes. They are anchored to somethingyou do (or think or feel) so that they are more likely to become automatic. Onceyou do the behaviors you want, find a way to make yourself feel good aboutthem—draw a happy face, pump your fist, or do whatever feels natural. Emotionhelps the brain to remember. 1. When I am tempted by something that is bad for my brain (like candy or cigarettes), I will hum to myself for a few minutes until the temptation passes. 2. After I open my refrigerator, I will throw out one food that is bad for my brain. 3. When a friend or someone at church asks me to take on a new task, I will say, “I have to think about it.” 4. When I go to a party, I will ask for a wine spritzer and top it up with club soda so I’m sure I don’t drink too much. 5. When I slip up on my goals, I will note it down in my journal. 6. When my child asks if he or she can play a contact sport like football or soccer, I will say, “No, I want to protect your brain from harm.” 7. When I feel out of sorts, I will take 10 deep breaths and focus on my goals. 8. When I eat breakfast, I will take a supplement to improve my brain.[90] H. S. Friedman and L. R.

But it is hard if you keep doingthings that reinforce negative behavior circuits in the brain. If you were ananxious child, for example, anxiety built specific connecting highways (neuralnetworks) in your brain. Odds are you still feel anxious as an adult unless youdid something to rewire them. If you deal with pressure by drinking alcohol orlashing out at those around you, you are likely to continue that behaviorwhenever you feel stressed —unless you develop a new model of doing things.Once the brain learns how to do something, it becomes wired to do itautomatically and reflexively through a process called neuroplasticity. Newlearning and change take strategy, effort, and resources, which is why we oftenget stuck. I find this to be true in my own life and bet you do too. Dependingon what you’ve taught your brain to do, this neuroplasticity can help youdevelop and maintain good habits, or it can cause you to get stuck in ruts thatsteal portions of your life. An example of the former: When a waiter bringsbread to my table at a restaurant, I now automatically request that it be takenaway. An example of the latter: For years, my e-mail and smartphone controlledme.When neurons fire together, they wire together, through a process calledlong-term potentiation (LTP), and habits and responses become an ingrained partof your life. LTP occurs when the brain learns something new, whether it’s goodor bad, and causes networks of brain cells to make new connections. Early in thelearning process the connections are weak, but over time, as behaviors arerepeated, the networks become stronger, making the behaviors more likely tobecome automatic, reflexive, or habitual. At this point, the networks are saidto be “potentiated.”With the brain, what you practice and reinforce becomes your reality. One of mypatients, Hank, learned that alcohol powerfully calmed his anxiety, and hecouldn’t break the wiring underlying his addiction until the pain of losing hisfamily short-circuited the connections. After repeated explosions at home,Hank’s children’s brains learned they could not trust that they would be safeand became hypervigilant, always watching for the next bad thing to happen. Fearbecame potentiated in their brains. The stronger the emotion, the more powerfulthe wiring or connections in the behavior. Some fears or habits will developafter repeated mild-to-moderate exposures, but others will develop after justone exposure if it is intense enough, such as after physical abuse, a fire,robbery, or rape.Kindling is an important process to understand as it relates to the brain andchange. When a scientist passes a low-volt electrical current through a nervecell, initially nothing happens, but as the voltage is raised to a certainthreshold, the cell will begin to fire. If the electrical intensity remains highenough for a long enough period of time, the cell will become kindled, meaningit is more sensitive. The voltage can then be lowered, and it will still causenerve cell firing. Every time an emotional explosion happened at home, Hank’skids experienced intense nerve cell firing in the limbic or emotional centers oftheir brains. Over time, as the trauma continued, it took less and less drama totrigger anxious feelings. Even years later, small things, such as an awkwardlook from a store clerk, could trigger big emotional reactions in the now-grownchildren.Your brain has roughly 100 billion brain cells, or neurons. Throughout the daythey are either at rest or firing to spark your thoughts, behaviors, andemotions. The activity becomes more intense in high-stress situations, such asthe one described above. If you experience enough anxious moments as a child,your neurons may fire faster even at rest, making you feel on edge. As an adult,your neurons are still on guard, ready to fire with little provocation, like ahairpin trigger. Your son drops a plate, and the crashing noise makes you flipout. Someone raises his voice to make a point, and you start feeling panicky.You see someone intoxicated at a party, and you quickly leave, even though youwanted to stay. Because the resting state of your brain is elevated, which wehave seen in our brain imaging work on posttraumatic stress disorder, you may bemore inclined to drink alcohol, take painkillers, or overeat as a way to sootheyour brain. Now your brain has become stuck in a rut, which the OxfordDictionary, in one definition, describes as “a habit or pattern of behaviourthat has become dull and unproductive but is hard to change.”[100]Whatever behaviors formed or you allowed into your life, productive or not, arethe ones that are likely to continue. This is why it is critical to assess yourautomatic behaviors and ask yourself if they are helping or hurting you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Be very careful of the behaviors you allow into your life. They may end uphijacking it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The exciting news is that you can change unwanted behaviors. Practicing goodbehaviors, such as getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night, exercising,and saying no to constantly checking your gadgets, strengthens the willpowercircuits in the brain. Alternatively, giving in to negative behaviors, such asemotional explosions, mindlessly eating cookies at work, guzzling sodas,consuming excessive amounts of alcohol, procrastinating, or giving in to theurge to look at Internet pornography, strengthens those particular circuits.Whatever behaviors you engage in are the ones you are likely to continue doing.If you allow yourself to yell at your children or be rude to your spouse orcoworkers, you are much more likely to do it again and again.No one wants to be controlled by things that were done to them or by their ownpast negative choices. To feel better fast, you need to learn to make deliberatechoices that will create new pathways in your brain. In this chapter, we’llexplore more about how ruts and negative behaviors develop in the brain and howyou can quickly develop more positive habits, while becoming more adaptable andflexible. When you repeatedly engage in positive behaviors, you build thesuperhighways of success that help you reflexively do the things you want to do.I’ll show you how you can use your brain to change your habits.WHY WE GET STUCK IN RUTS: HABITS AND THE BRAINAlong with long-term potentiation and kindling, it is important to know abouttwo areas of the brain that are involved with mental flexibility and habitformation: the anterior cingulate gyrus, which I think of as the brain’s gearshifter, and the basal ganglia, where habits are formed and sustained.INSIDE VIEW OF THE BRAINCutaway side view of the brain showing the anterior cingulate gyrus toward thefront, which is involved in shifting attention and error detection, and thebasal ganglia toward the middle, involved in pleasure, motivation, and adjustingmovements. [images/Illustration-4.1.jpg]THE BRAIN’S GEAR SHIFTERThere’s an area deep in the frontal lobes called the anterior cingulate gyrus,or ACG, which allows us to shift our attention, go from thought to thought, movefrom idea to idea, see options, go with the flow, and cooperate, which involvesgetting outside ourselves to help others. The ACG is also involved in errordetection. If you come home and see the front door wide open, for example, eventhough you know you locked it, it triggers an appropriate danger reaction inyour mind.When the ACG is healthy, we tend to be flexible, adaptable, and cooperative,learn from our mistakes, and effectively notice when things are wrong. When itis underactive, often due to head trauma or exposure to damaging toxins, we tendto be quiet and withdrawn. Alternatively, when the ACG is overactive, often dueto low levels of the calming neurotransmitter serotonin, we tend to get stuck onnegative thoughts (obsessions) or negative behaviors (compulsions/addictions)and be uncooperative. Serotonin-enhancing strategies, such as taking medicinethat increases the availability of serotonin (SSRIs, or selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors), have been used for decades to treat anxiety, depression,and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).Practically speaking, getting stuck has many different potential manifestations,including worrying, holding grudges, and becoming upset if things don’t go yourway. On the surface, people with high ACG activity may appear selfish (“My wayor the highway”), but from a neuroscience standpoint, they’re not selfish;they’re rigid. Inflexibility causes them to automatically say no even whensaying yes may be their best choice. They have trouble seeing options and tendto be argumentative and oppositional. Plus, they tend to see too many errors —inthemselves, their spouses, kids, coworkers, and organizations, such as schools,government, and churches.In doing research on our extensive brain imaging/clinical database, wediscovered that patients who have OCD or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)show increased activity in the ACG. In both disorders, people get stuck onnegative feelings, thoughts, and behaviors (see “When the Gear Shifter andEnabler Are Over- or Underactive” on page 74 [chapter_4.xhtml#page_74]). Knowingthis information gives us the clue that strategies to boost serotonin could helpincrease cognitive flexibility to enable change. Research suggests that isindeed true[101] —more on this below (see Strategy #1, pages 76–77[chapter_4.xhtml#page_76]).THE BRAIN’S ENABLERDeep in the brain are two large structures called the basal ganglia (BG). Amongother roles, they are involved with integrating thoughts, emotions, andmovement, which is why we jump when we get excited or freeze when we becomescared. The BG also help to shift and smooth motor behavior and may be involvedin habit formation, according to studies. When they are overactive, our researchand that of others suggests, people struggle with generalized anxiety, dislikeuncertainty, and avoid conflict.[102] With increased BG activity we also seerepetitive behaviors, such as tics, nail biting, and teeth grinding, as well ascompulsions, such as hand washing and checking locks. When the BG areunderactive, people tend to have low motivation, poor handwriting, and troublefeeling pleasure. They are also more vulnerable to attentional problems andmovement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease.WHEN THE GEAR SHIFTER AND ENABLER ARE OVER- OR UNDERACTIVEBRAIN AREAANTERIOR CINGULATE GYRUSFUNCTION * Shifts attention * Increases cognitive flexibility * Encourages adaptability * Moves from idea to idea * Sees options * Goes with the flow * Cooperates with others * Detects errorsUNDERACTIVE SYMPTOMS * Low motivation * Low energy * Low movement * Decreased speechOVERACTIVE SYMPTOMS * Dislikes change * Has trouble shifting attention * Has difficulty seeing options * Holds own opinions, doesn’t listen to others * Gets locked into a course of action, even though it may not be beneficial * Says no automatically without thinking first * Needs things done a certain way * Engages in compulsive behaviors, such as excessive hand washing, checking locks, counting, or spelling, and experiences anxiety if these are not done * Is oppositional * Is argumentative * Gets upset when things don’t go as expected * Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) * Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)BRAIN AREABASAL GANGLIAFUNCTION * Integrates feeling and movement * Shifts and steadies fine motor movements * Suppresses unwanted motor behaviors * Helps to set the body’s anxiety level * Involved in habit formation * Generates motivation and drive * Mediates pleasure/ecstasyUNDERACTIVE SYMPTOMS * Low motivation * Poor handwriting * Tremors * Parkinson’s disease * Fine motor problemsOVERACTIVE SYMPTOMS * Generalized anxiety * Uncertainty about the future or ambiguity[103] * Predicts the worst * Avoids conflict[104]WHAT DO RUTS LOOK LIKE IN YOUR LIFE?Getting stuck in a rut can take many forms, including addictions, depression,impulse-control issues, bad habits, staying in difficult or abusiverelationships, or maintaining outdated business processes. Worry, holdinggrudges, obsessive thinking, compulsive behaviors, persistent anger, rudebehavior, and being oppositional or argumentative can also be caused by ruts inthe brain.Check the questions that apply to you. * checkbox [images/checkbox.jpg] Do you dislike change? * checkbox [images/checkbox.jpg] Do you tend to get stuck in loops of thinking? * checkbox [images/checkbox.jpg] Do you struggle with repetitive, negative thoughts? * checkbox [images/checkbox.jpg] Do you have difficulty seeing options in stressful situations? * checkbox [images/checkbox.jpg] Do you tend to hold on to your own opinions and not listen to others? * checkbox [images/checkbox.jpg] Do you get locked into a course of action, even though it may not be good for you? * checkbox [images/checkbox.jpg] Do you tend to automatically say no without thinking? * checkbox [images/checkbox.jpg] Do you get upset if you are surprised or if things don’t go the way you expect they should? * checkbox [images/checkbox.jpg] Do you struggle with compulsive behaviors, such as hand washing, checking locks, counting, or spelling? * checkbox [images/checkbox.jpg] Do you tend to be oppositional or argumentative? * checkbox [images/checkbox.jpg] Have you been diagnosed with OCD or PTSD?The more questions you checked, the more likely you have an ACG that is workingtoo hard.

Do you lunch on salad and soup or wolf down fast food? Do you takeregular breaks from e-mail and texting or spend endless hours on one or both? Doyou listen to soothing music while driving or tailgate whenever you get behindthe wheel?Have you tried to change habits that have not been helpful but failed miserablyover time? That happens to most people because they do not understand the brain.As we have seen, it is in your brain where you become adaptable, flexible, andable to change, or it is in your brain where you get stuck in a rut.NINE STRATEGIES TO QUICKLY TURN YOUR RUTS INTO SUPERHIGHWAYS OF SUCCESSScientists have studied how the brain can facilitate change, whether it is tolose weight, beat an addiction, stay off your computer, be more successful atwork, change personal habits, or revise business processes. Based on thisresearch, together with our clinical experience at Amen Clinics, here are ninesimple brain-based habits to promote change.STRATEGY #1: NATURALLY BOOST SEROTONIN.5 to 60 minutes. [images/x05-60-min.jpg]When serotonin levels are low, the ACG and BG tend to be more active, which caninhibit change and also contribute to mental inflexibility and getting stuck onnegative thoughts or behaviors. Increasing serotonin can help calm these areasof the brain.[105] This can be done with four simple strategies:[106] * Physical exercise increases the ability of tryptophan, the amino acid precursor of serotonin, to enter the brain. Walking, running, swimming, or playing table tennis will help you feel happier and more mentally flexible. Exercise alone has been found to treat depression, with effectiveness similar to an SSRI antidepressant.[107] Whenever you feel stuck in a rut, get moving. * Bright light exposure has been shown to increase serotonin and is a natural treatment for seasonal depression and premenstrual tension syndrome, as well as depression in pregnant women.[108] Depression and inflexibility are more common in winter and in places where sunlight is lacking. To improve your mood and increase cognitive flexibility and learning, get more sun or use bright light LED therapy,[109] which is a standard treatment for seasonal depression. * Eating foods that contain tryptophan can increase serotonin levels. Whenever you feel stuck in a rut, combine tryptophan-containing foods, such as eggs, turkey, seafood, chickpeas, nuts, and seeds, with healthy carbohydrates, such as sweet potatoes and quinoa, to elicit a short-term insulin response that drives tryptophan into the brain. Dark chocolate also increases serotonin.[110] * Nutritional supplements can also raise brain levels of serotonin. My favorite ones are L-tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), and saffron.[111] See chapter 10 for more information on these.STRATEGY #2: DEFINE WHAT YOU WANT AND WHY.15 to 30 minutes. [images/x15-30-min.jpg]To help you make better behavioral choices, your BG and ACG need your prefrontalcortex to step in and take charge. For this to occur, it helps if you clarifywhich behaviors you want to change. Your brain makes happen what it sees. Whatpatterns are making you feel worse by contributing to your anxiety, anger,stress, or worry? What ruts would you like to turn into superhighways ofsuccess, leaving you feeling better? Write them out. Create a vivid andbelievable “Future of Success” in detail. How will you feel in one, five, andten years if you consistently engage in the new behavior? You could write, “I’llfeel amazing, healthy, energetic, cognitively better than I have ever been, incontrol.” Next, envision a vivid and believable “Future of Failure” in detail.How will you feel in one, five, and ten years if you do not stop this negativebehavior? What will your life look like going forward? You might write, “I’llfeel embarrassed, lose my family, have a smaller brain, suffer from earlydisease and death!”Define what you want, and then ask yourself if your behavior is getting you whatyou want. If not, be clear with yourself that every time you engage in the wrongbehavior, it is strengthening your brain to do the wrong thing. Whenever you dothe right thing, it is beginning to strengthen those circuits instead. Practicedoes not make perfect; it makes the brain do what you practice. Perfect practicemakes perfect.STRATEGY #3: ASSESS YOUR READINESS FOR CHANGE.Remember this joke? “How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb?One, but the light bulb really has to want to change.”Likewise, your consent and motivation are critical elements of change. Are youready to eliminate the ruts in your life? One of my favorite techniques toassess motivation for change is called Motivational Interviewing (MI). It helpspeople clarify their conviction and confidence to do things differently and usesquestions to guide them through six stages of change. Ambivalence anduncertainty are the enemies of change.When you meet a friend who . . . drinks too much; smokes a pack per day; isobese; doesn’t exercise; or has high blood pressure and yet is unwilling to takeyour advice, change her lifestyle, or comply with recommendations from herdoctor, how do you feel?When your adolescent ADHD son . . . refuses to turn down the music and dohomework, smells of cigarette smoke, hangs out with friends who drink, and stopsparticipating in healthy activities, how do you feel?If you are like most people, you feel sad, scared, helpless, frustrated, andunsure of how to help. You may respond with judgment, unwanted advice, or scarystories of the risks these people face, hoping to help them see the light. Forthose of you who have tried this approach (I certainly have), how’s it beenworking for you? I want to help you become more effective at facilitating realbehavioral change in yourself, your family, and your friends. Understandingthese six stages of change will help you assess your own or someone else’sreadiness for change and increase your conviction and confidence to make ithappen.SIX STAGES OF CHANGEDecisions to make lifestyle changes are the result of a natural process thattakes place in stages over time. Each stage is the foundation for the next one.Let’s talk about how to recognize, reinforce, and accelerate the natural processthroughout these stages.Diagram illustrating stages of change. The diagram is a circle divided into sixequal sections like a pie, indicating a cycle. The stages are labeled 1 to 6.Stage 1: I won't or I can't. Pre-contemplation. Cons are greater than pros.Stage 2: I might. Contemplation. Cons equal pros. Stage 3: I will.Determination. Pros are greater than cons. Stage 4: I am. Action. Long-termpotentiation starts. Stage 5: I still am. Maintenance. Long-term potentiationgets stronger. Stage 6: Whoops. Relapse. Start again.[images/Illustration-4.2.jpg]Change starts by determining a person’s readiness for it. First, ask yourself(or a loved one) an open-ended question about the behavior to be changed: Wouldyou consider . . . * Losing weight? * Quitting smoking? * Getting more exercise? * Changing your eating habits? * Cutting back or abstaining from alcohol? * Going to bed earlier? * Limiting your e-mail?If you answer “no,” you’re in Stage I, which is called the pre-contemplationstage. You are not thinking about a change, you are not ready for it, and you donot believe you can accomplish it.Stage I: I Won’t or I Can’t. This is often called denial, when the cons ofchange outweigh the pros. “I won’t change” means you have little to nomotivation to change; “I can’t change” means you lack the capability orconfidence to change. In this stage either the negatives of changing thebehavior (such as smoking, overeating, or looking at Internet pornography) seemto outweigh the positives, or you are in denial, lack knowledge or conviction tochange, are skeptical, or feel powerless to change. If you or a loved one is inthis stage, you can increase your conviction by asking, “If I decided to change,how would it benefit me?” Focusing on benefits is an important first strategy tohelp move someone to Stage II.If you answer “maybe,” you are in Stage II, called the contemplation stage. Youare thinking about changing but have not yet decided.Stage II: I Might. The cons of change equal the pros, but ambivalence and lackof confidence are still issues. To boost your confidence, ask yourself threequestions: 1. If I really decide to change, do I think I can do it? 2. What would prevent me from changing; what are the barriers? 3. How do I think I can start changing; what are the strategies?In this stage, it helps to focus on the benefits of changing and collectinformation that might help you develop solutions. I was once visiting my niece,who had just started seventh grade in a new school. She was struggling in music,and she told me the teacher was not helpful. Her instrument was the xylophone,and she had no idea how to play it. She lacked confidence. Together, we went toYouTube and searched the term “How to play the xylophone.” In 20 minutes she wasable to play a simple song, and her confidence soared.If you answer “yes,” you are in Stage III, called the determination stage. Youare making the decision to change.Stage III: I Will. The benefits of change now outweigh the drawbacks, and youcan now develop a plan to make it happen.If you answer, “I am doing it,” you are in Stage IV, called the action stage.Stage IV: I Am. In this stage you build confidence and look for any barriersthat might derail you. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is beginning to occur inthis phase, meaning that you are beginning to rewire your brain.If you answer, “I am still doing it,” you are in Stage V, called the maintenancestage.Stage V: I Still Am. LTP is being strengthened and the new behavior feels morereflexive or automatic, but you are still on the lookout for barriers and traps.If you answer, “I fell off the wagon,” you are in Stage VI, called the relapsestage.Stage VI: Whoops! Most people backslide at some point. It is a natural part ofchange. When you fall off the wagon, it is critical to ask why, learn from yourmistake(s), and start again. Some people have to start over at Stage I. Mostpeople jump back in at Stage III or IV.In general, the job of people in Stages I and II is enhancing their motivationand conviction, while those in Stages III through V focus on sustainingmotivation and engagement, eliminating obstacles, and overcoming barriers. Ifsomeone is in the “I Won’t or I Can’t” phase, the first step is to work onconviction and confidence until they make the decision “I Will.” Then they canfocus on the skills that will help them to engage in the new behavior.For each behavior you want to change, ask yourself, “Which stage am I in?” and“How will it benefit me to change my behavior?”By embracing change, we learn a principle inspired by Aristotle’s teachings: “Weare what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”[112]STRATEGY #4: KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.What are the new behaviors you need to master to be successful? For any problem,such as losing weight, overcoming an addiction, calming your temper, or avoidingdistractions, it is critical to know which important behaviors will help youreach your goal, then practice them over and over. Here are a few generalexamples, followed by suggestions for specific issues: * Make sure your blood sugar is stable to keep the PFC healthy * Get enough sleep to keep the PFC healthy * Take proper nutritional supplementsWEIGHT LOSS * Start a food journal to monitor what you eat * Stop drinking your calories; drink primarily water * Upgrade the quality of your food * Eliminate foods you may be intolerant of or allergic to, such as milk or wheat products * Avoid places that trigger food cravings * Add in exercise * Learn to control your thoughts, so you don’t have to medicate them with food or drugs * Get your blood work done so you do not miss an important contributor, such as low vitamin D, thyroid, or testosterone levelsOVERCOMING ADDICTION * Avoid friends who use substances * HALT —don’t let yourself get too hungry, angry, lonely, or tired * Learn to control your thoughts, so you don’t have to medicate them with drugs * Attend 12-step groups on a regular basis if they help you * Work to keep your temper under control * Eliminate the ANTs (see discussion of automatic negative thoughts in chapter 5) * Learn diaphragmatic breathing * Consider SPECT to see if you had a brain injury in the past that needs to be treated * Establish group supportELIMINATING DISTRACTIONS * Have defined periods where you turn off your gadgets * Stop texting while walking * Put away your tablet, smartphone, and other tech items at least an hour before bedJust as in the story about my niece, you can google how to change virtually anybehavior. Once you have the desire and motivation, learn the critical steps totake.STRATEGY #5: IDENTIFY YOUR MOST VULNERABLE MOMENTS AND LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES.It’s important to know when you are most vulnerable. Be curious about yourbehavior, not furious at your slipups or mistakes. Investigating setbacks can beextremely instructive if you take the time to really analyze them.Eloise, 42, a highly successful realtor, came into my office feeling sad andashamed. I initially saw her for panic attacks and drug use. Within a few monthsshe had made great progress and completely stopped using drugs. But after amajor fight with her boyfriend, she slipped and went on a weekend binge.“I’ll never be free of this behavior,” Eloise told me. Then she stopped herselfand said, “I know that’s not true.” We had worked on her thoughts. “I am just somad at myself.”CHANGE DIAGRAMA graph showing a very jagged line of feeling over time, starting low andgenerally rising as time progresses. The first time segment is labeled 'Gooddays and bad days, but mostly bad.' An arrow pointing to the beginning of therise shortly afterward is labeled 'Start the program; notice quick improvement.'An arrow pointing to a spot in the middle of the graph is labeled 'Learn fromdown times and setbacks.' The last segment in the upper right of the graph islabeled 'Good days and bad days, but mostly good.' [images/Illustration-4.3.jpg]I went to the whiteboard in my office and drew the graph on how people change.“When people come to see me as patients, they have good days and bad days, butusually their days are not very good,” I said. “Then we work together to changethings, and they get better. But they never just get better and stay there.There is an up-and-down course. Over time they feel much better and usually staythat way. But it is the down times, the slipups, the setbacks that teach us mostof what we need to know —if we embrace them and take time to learn from them. Wehave to turn bad days into useful information.”When Rahm Emanuel was the White House chief of staff, he once said that younever want a serious crisis to go to waste.[113] Slipups and setbacks are thesame. Study them, learn from them, be curious. In my experience, the mostsuccessful people embrace their mistakes so they can learn from them.Eloise and I investigated her relapse from a brain science perspective. The weekbefore her relapse, a home fell through escrow and she lost sleep over it. Inaddition, her eating became more erratic, she did not take time to work out, andshe skipped her supplements. Poor sleep, inconsistent eating habits, and a lackof exercise all contributed to lower activity in and blood flow to her brain.Combining those factors with a stressful week and relational conflict triggeredmore negative thoughts, and she relapsed. Rather than judge herself as a badperson, I encouraged her to be a good student and learn from the episode. Sheneeded to be more diligent with sleep, exercise, and good food, along withlearning how to master her mind (see Strategy #4).I asked Eloise, “Do you have a GPS system in your car that talks to you?”“Yes,” she replied.“When you make a wrong turn, what does the voice say to you?”“‘Make the next legal turn,’ or something like that,” she said.“Does it start yelling or swearing at you?” I asked.With a smile she said, “They wouldn’t sell many of those GPS systems. Of coursenot.”“But isn’t this what you are doing to yourself when you make a mistake? Insteadof beating yourself up, whenever you make a mistake, learn from it, turn around,and go in a better direction.”Be both the investigator and the subject! Change is a process that occurs insteps. If you pay attention, the bad times can be more instructive than the goodtimes. Journaling is key to helping keep track of both. Know when you are mostvulnerable (not sleeping, forgetting to eat breakfast, waiting too long betweenmeals, attending too many parties or social gatherings, etc.).STRATEGY #6: DEVELOP “IF-THEN” PLANS TO OVERCOME YOUR VULNERABLE MOMENTS.20 to 30 minutes. [images/x20-30-min.jpg]Once you know when you are vulnerable, you can create contingency plans toovercome unwanted behaviors. Psychology professor Peter Gollwitzer from New YorkUniversity has published extensive research on behavior change. He recommendsthat people create “if-then” scenarios that spell out how they’ll break unwantedhabits.[114] For example, if x (situation) happens, then I will do y (preplannedaction).Dr. Gollwitzer wrote in Fortune magazine,The most effective plans are those that specify when, where and how you want toact on your goals by using an “if-then” format. Take drinking too much in thecompany of your friends as an example. In the “if” part of the plan, youidentify the critical situation that usually triggers your bad habit. Perhapsthe trigger is being offered a drink by your friends. In the “then” part, youspecify an action that can halt accepting the offer such as responding to it bysaying that you prefer a glass of water today. And then you link the “if” andthe “then” parts together by making an “if-then” plan: “If on Friday eveningmy friends offer me a drink, then I will answer: I prefer to have a glass ofwater today!”[115]As insanely simple as it sounds, the research is impressive. If-then strategieshave helped people reach their goals in dieting and athletics,[116] boostedphysical activity in women by more than an hour a week compared to a controlgroup,[117] increased the consumption of fruits and vegetables,[118] and helpedto regulate emotions, including fear and disgust.[119] Using this simpletechnique has been shown to increase activity in the PFC,[120] which can helpoverride the brain’s automatic or reflexive behaviors from the ACG and BG. Ithas even been shown to help normalize the brain in children with ADHD.[121]Making your “if-then” plans known to others also improves your ability to stayon track.[122]In a similar way, I often tell my patients that when it comes to brain health,the two most important words in the English language are then what. If I dothis, then what happens? Thinking ahead helps to prevent a lot of unwantedtrouble.CREATE SIMPLE “IF-THEN” RULES FOR VULNERABLE TIMES, SUCH AS 1. If I am tempted to eat unhealthy foods, then I’ll at least eat the healthy ones first. 2. If I find myself becoming irritated at someone, then I will take three deep belly breaths before I say anything else. 3. If I am anxious about a meeting, then I will write down my anxious thoughts, which helps to dispel them. 4. If I can cheat on my diet, then it can only be after reading my One-Page Miracle (see pages 190–193 [chapter_8.xhtml#page_190]) and calling supportive friends (introduces delay and social support). 5. If I become aware of the impulse to eat something that is not healthy, then I will focus on something else —like taking a walk, reciting a poem, or drinking a glass of water —until the impulse goes away.STRATEGY #7: REFRAME YOUR PAIN.To succeed at changing, you have to disarm your impulses and make the rightchoices pleasurable.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The only way you can sustain change is to change what brings you pleasure!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn how to find what you love about not being inebriated, or identify greatlow-calorie, highly nutritious food. Discover how good it feels when you’re nottied up with anxiety. One of my friends told me she hated exercise, but sheloved walking with her children. Mind-set is key.Connect to who you are becoming, and think like a healthy person. How would ahealthy person order this meal or act in this vulnerable situation? Willpower isa skill you can develop. If you can distract yourself for just a minute,temptations often go away.Be careful about giving in to your own bad behavior! You may be causing your ownbehavior disorder. I was once with a patient who was struggling with her weight.She said she often felt as though she had to give in to her cravings. She hadtwo teenage daughters, one of whom I was seeing because she had tantrumswhenever she did not get her way. I asked this mother how her daughter would doif Mom always gave in to her temper tantrums —would she get better or worse?“Worse, of course,” she replied. When you give in to your own tantrums orcravings, you are creating your own internal behavior disorder, which can ruinyour health and kill you before your time. Be a loving, effective parent toyourself.STRATEGY #8: TURN ACCOMPLICES INTO FRIENDS.Whom you spend time with matters! Cultivating bad habits —and good ones —is ateam sport, and you need friends rather than accomplices. Accomplices encourageor are complicit with your negative behaviors, while friends, mentors, orcoaches are people who support your positive behaviors. Ask for their help.Adding friends improves your chances for success up to 40 percent, and this isespecially true for weight loss and fitness.If you want to change your behavior, either you need to stop seeing youraccomplices or turn them into friends, or you need to change your friends. Manyaccomplices can become friends if you have crucial conversations with them.Explain what they can start doing, stop doing, and continue doing to help you.IN YOUR LIFE, ARE THESE PEOPLE ACCOMPLICES OR FRIENDS? * Spouse * Children * Parents * Grandparents * Siblings * In-laws * Aunts, uncles, cousins * Friends * Neighbors * Bosses * Coworkers * Teachers * Classmates * Students * School administrators * Church members or staff * AA participants * Community club members * Gym friendsIdentify your five most powerful friends who will support your good habits, aswell as five accomplices who make it less likely you will succeed in changingyour behavior. Spend more time with the people who will help you.STRATEGY #9: USE TINY BEHAVIORS TO CREATE MASSIVE CHANGE.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Small daily improvements are the key to staggering long-term results.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As I mentioned in the introduction, Amen Clinics partnered with Professor BJFogg, director of the Persuasive Tech Lab at Stanford University, and hissister, Linda Fogg-Phillips, to help our patients with behavior change. One oftheir key suggestions is to take baby steps. We have been sprinkling these “TinyHabits” throughout the book, since developing those small new behaviors is oneof the best ways to make change a reality in your life and slowly builds newcircuits or superhighways in your brain.Based on his research, Dr. Fogg has found that change is easy when designedproperly. He said,You don’t have to be perfect. No one is. You just need to keep working on it.Change happens better and faster if you are playful, flexible, and iterative.Few people change all at once; change occurs most effectively when it is smalland incremental over time. Relying solely on willpower is usually a prescriptionfor failure.Know your motivation —when motivation is high you can do hard things. If you arejust diagnosed with diabetes, for example, cutting out sugar becomes much easierthan it would be if you simply want to lose a few pounds. When motivation islow, you have to make things as easy, simple, and “tiny” as possible. If youjust want to lose a few pounds, you could start by packing your lunch two days aweek, instead of eating out.When things don’t work, be curious, not furious. Ask why and re-assess. It maytake several tries.[123]Our brains are wired to keep doing what we’ve always done —but we can change theruts into superhighways of success. Making small changes is the secret tofeeling better fast, and it can lead to taking on big changes that will ensurethose feelings last.NINE STRATEGIES TO EMBRACE CHANGE AND TURN YOUR RUTS INTO SUPERHIGHWAYS OFSUCCESS 1. Naturally boost serotonin. 2. Define what you want and why. 3. Assess your readiness for change. 4. Know what you need to do. 5. Identify your most vulnerable moments. 6. Develop “if-then” plans to overcome your vulnerable moments. 7. Reframe your pain. 8. Turn accomplices into friends. 9. Use tiny behaviors to create massive change.TINY HABITS THAT CAN HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FAST —AND LEAD TO BIG CHANGES2 to 15 minutes. [images/x02-15-min.jpg]Each of these habits takes just a few minutes. They are anchored to somethingyou do (or think or feel) so that they are more likely to become automatic. Onceyou do the behaviors you want, find a way to make yourself feel good aboutthem —draw a happy face, pump your fist, or do whatever feels natural. Emotionhelps the brain to remember. 1. After I answer the phone, I will stand up and walk while I talk. 2. After I start to argue, I will ask myself, Is my behavior getting me what I want? 3. When I get out of bed in the morning, I will open the curtains/shades to let the sunshine in. 4. When I feel anxious, I will eat a complex carbohydrate, such as a sweet potato, to boost serotonin. 5. When I relapse or make a mistake with my health, I will ask myself, What can I learn from my mistake? 6. When I am tempted to eat unhealthy foods, I will eat the healthy ones on my plate first. 7. When I am dealing with someone who is stuck on a negative thought or arguing, I will ask them to go for a walk with me and will not bring up any charged topic for at least 10 minutes. 8. When I want to go out to eat, I will ask the healthiest person I know to go with me. 9. When I feel thoughts going over and over in my head, I will write them down, which helps to get rid of them.[100] Oxford Living Dictionaries online, s.v. “rut,” accessed March 19, 2018,https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rut[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rut].[101] E.

A belief is a thought that we’vebeen attaching to, often for years.BYRON KATIE, LOVING WHAT IS: FOUR QUESTIONS THAT CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFEDark thoughts in the mind are not “you,” but are false messages from the brain.And because you are not your brain, you don’t have to listen to them.JEFFREY M. SCHWARTZ, MD, AUTHOR OF YOU ARE NOT YOUR BRAIN--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Developing the habit of accurate, honest, and disciplined thinking is essentialto feeling better fast and making it last. This is not positive thinking, whichcan actually inhibit feeling better over the long run. As I have noted before,people who live by the philosophy “Don’t worry; be happy” die the earliest fromaccidents and preventable illnesses. Believing the future will be favorablewithout following a plan and putting in consistent effort can prevent peoplefrom taking the actions that will likely make that belief a reality.[124] Thischapter will help you develop the mental discipline necessary for success,including eliminating the ANTs (automatic negative thoughts), quieting yourmind, having an appropriate level of anxiety, and focusing on gratitude.The human attention span is eight seconds, according to a 2015 study fromMicrosoft.[125] A goldfish’s attention span has been estimated at nine seconds.Human development seems to be going the wrong way. With modern technologystealing our attention span and directing our minds to the will of corporateAmerica, disciplining the habits of our moment-by-moment thoughts is anessential skill for achieving happiness and purpose. Our gadget addiction isfeeding an old tendency of the human brain to be scattered, unfocused, andcontrolled by negativity and fear. Plus, it is making us feel worse.[126] Peoplewho have the most screen time (TV, texting, video games) have a higher incidenceof feeling unhappy.Monkey mind is a term that describes a mind that is unsettled, restless,indecisive, and uncontrollable. Monkey mind was described by Siddhartha Gautama(Buddha) in the sixth century BC, but it applies today more than ever. He said,“Just as a monkey swinging through the trees grabs one branch and lets it goonly to seize another, so, too, that which is called thought, mind, orconsciousness arises and disappears continually both day and night.”Thoughts that you allow to circle again and again in your mind build ruts orroads in the brain, making the thoughts more likely to dominate and control yourlife. Fortunately, as we’ve seen in the last few chapters, the brain can change.You can rebuild these neural network highways in a more productive way withfocused effort.MARCUS: TOO MANY NEGATIVE THOUGHTSAbout 10 years ago, the parents of 14-year-old Marcus brought him to see mebecause he was struggling with schoolwork and with his temper. At his previousschool, Marcus “barely had to try” to get good grades; but after moving to a newschool for the athletics, he found the more academically rigorous programchallenging, and his grades declined. He had trouble focusing, was easilydistracted, procrastinated, and took longer to complete assignments than everbefore. A prior psychiatrist diagnosed him with attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD), but the stimulant medications Ritalin and Adderall made himangry and more depressed, and for the first time he started to complain ofsuicidal thoughts. His SPECT scan revealed that his brain worked too hard,especially in the front, which was not consistent with a classic ADHD pattern.In research my team has published, we’ve seen that this pattern actuallypredicts a negative response to stimulant medications.When I met Marcus, it was clear he struggled with many negative thoughts. Herepeatedly referred to himself as stupid, and during our first session he toldme,“I hate school.”“I can never be as good as other kids.”“I’m a terrible person.”“I should try harder.”“I’m an idiot.”“I am a failure.”“My teachers hate me.”“It’s my parents’ fault for not letting me quit.”His thinking was in a rut. The highways in his brain were headed straight towardnegativity, failure, and depression. When I showed Marcus his brain scan andcompared it to a Ferrari whose engine was revved too high, he smiled, saying heliked that comparison. To help Marcus get control over his mind, I spent thenext two months teaching him the six principles of disciplined thinking that weall should have learned in school.DISCIPLINED THINKING PRINCIPLE #1: EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A THOUGHT, YOUR BRAINRELEASES CHEMICALS.That’s how your brain works. You have a thought, your brain releases chemicals,electrical transmissions travel throughout your brain, and you become aware ofwhat you’re thinking. Thoughts are real, and they have a powerful impact on howyou feel and behave. Just as a muscle that’s exercised becomes stronger,repeatedly thinking the same thoughts makes them stronger too.Every time you have an angry, unkind, hopeless, helpless, worthless, sad, orirritating thought, such as I’m stupid, your brain releases chemicals that makeyou feel bad. In this way, your body reacts to every negative thought you have.Marcus was exercising his brain to feel depression, sadness, and failure. Iasked him to think about the last time he was mad. How did his body feel? Whenmost people are angry, their muscles become tense, their hearts beat faster,their hands start to sweat, and they may even begin to feel a little dizzy.Marcus told me he got dizzy and sweaty and felt confused and stupid.Similarly, every time you have a happy, hopeful, kind, optimistic, positivethought, your brain releases chemicals that make you feel good. I asked Marcusto think about the last time he had a happy thought. How did he feel inside hisbody? When most people are happy, their muscles relax, their hearts beat moreslowly, their hands become dry, and they breathe more evenly. Marcus told meabout an outing with his father, where they went fishing and had a great time.When he thought about it, he said he felt peaceful and happy. He didn’t feelstupid.DISCIPLINED THINKING PRINCIPLE #2: THOUGHTS ARE POWERFUL, AND YOUR BODY REACTSTO EVERY SINGLE ONE YOU HAVE.Thoughts can make your mind and body feel good, or they can make you feel bad.Every cell in your body is affected by every thought you have. We know this frompolygraph, or lie detector, tests. During a polygraph, a person is connected toinstruments that measure * hand temperature * heart rate * blood pressure * breathing rate * muscle tension * sweat gland activityThe tester then asks questions, such as “Did you do that misdeed?” Almostimmediately, the tested person’s body reacts to every thought he has, whether hesays anything or not. If the person did it and worries he’ll be found out, hisbody is likely to have a stress response and react in the following ways: * hand temperature drops * heart rate speeds up * blood pressure increases * breathing rate increases, but breaths are more shallow * muscle tension increases * sweat gland activity increasesThe opposite is also true. If he did not do the deed, his body will experience arelaxation response and react in the following ways: * hand temperature increases * heart rate slows * blood pressure decreases * breathing rate decreases and breaths become deeper * muscle tension decreases * sweat gland activity decreasesAgain, your body reacts almost immediately to what you think —and not just whenyou’re asked about telling the truth. Your body reacts to every thought youhave, whether it is about work, friends, family, or anything else. This is whywhen people become upset, they often develop physical symptoms, such asheadaches, stomachaches, or diarrhea, or they become more susceptible toillness. Imagine what was happening in Marcus’s young body as his mind wasflooded with negative thoughts.At Amen Clinics we have biofeedback equipment that measures the samephysiological responses as polygraphs: hand temperature, heart rate, breathingrate, muscle tension, and sweat gland activity (see chapter 1, page 10[chapter_1.xhtml#page_10]). I hooked up Marcus to our equipment. When I askedhim about baseball (a sport he loved), his baby sister, and his friends, hisbody showed an immediate relaxation response. Yet when I asked him about school,feeling stupid, or his history teacher (with whom he was having a particularlyhard time), his hands immediately got colder, his heart rate and muscle tensionincreased, his breathing rate became disorganized, and his hands started tosweat more. Marcus and his mother were amazed to see the evidence of how hisbody responded to every thought he had.I taught Marcus to think of his body as an “ecosystem” that contains everythingin the environment, such as air, water, land, cars, people, animals, vegetation,houses, landfills, and more. A negative thought was like pollution to his wholesystem. Just as pollution in Los Angeles or Beijing affects everyone who goesoutdoors, so, too, do negative thoughts pollute your mind and your body.DISCIPLINED THINKING PRINCIPLE #3: YOUR THOUGHTS ARE HARDWIRED TO BE NEGATIVE.In generations past, negative thoughts protected us from early death or becomingsupper for powerful animals. From our earliest times on earth, being aware ofand avoiding danger was crucial to survival. Unfortunately, even when the worldbecame safer, negativity bias remained in our brains. Researchers havedemonstrated that negative experiences have a greater impact on the brain thanpositive ones.[127] People pay more attention to negative than to positive news,which is why news outlets typically lead broadcasts with floods, murders,political disasters, and all forms of mayhem. According to research from thecontent marketing website Outbrain.com [http://Outbrain.com], in two periods of2012 the average click-through rate on headlines with negative adjectives was anastounding 63 percent higher than for headlines with positive ones.[128] Anegative perspective is more contagious than a positive one, which may be whypolitical campaigns typically go negative at the end. Even our language is notexempt: 62 percent of the words in the English dictionary connote negativeemotions, while 32 percent express positive ones.[129]Psychologist and author Rick Hanson has written that the brain is wired fornegativity bias. Bad news is quickly stored in the brain to keep us safe, butpositive experiences have to be held in consciousness for more than 12 secondsbefore they stay with us. “The brain is like Velcro for negative experiences butTeflon for positive ones,” Hanson wrote.[130] Psychologist MihalyCsikszentmihalyi, author of Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience,suggested that without other thoughts to occupy us, our brains will alwaysreturn to worry. The only way to escape this is to focus on what will bring“flow” —activities that increase our sense of purpose and achievement.Negative emotions “trump” positive emotions, which is why it is critical todiscipline our natural tendency toward the negative and amplify more helpfulthoughts and emotions. I taught Marcus that his negative thought pattern wascommon but not helpful.DISCIPLINED THINKING PRINCIPLE #4: THOUGHTS ARE AUTOMATIC AND OFTEN LIE.Thoughts are based on complex chemical reactions in the brain; memories from thepast; the quality of our sleep, hormones, and blood sugar; and many otherfactors. They are automatic, reflexive, random, and overwhelmingly negative.Plus, they are often erroneous. Unless disciplined and bridled, they will lie toyou and wreak havoc in your life. Marcus thought he was stupid. He told himselfso multiple times a day because he had trouble staying focused and didn’tperform well on tests. Yet when we tested him, his IQ was 135 —in the top onepercent of all people. I told him it was critical to question every stupidthought that went through his head.It’s important to examine your thoughts to see if they are true and if they arehelping you or hurting you. Unfortunately, if you never challenge your thoughts,you will simply believe them and then act out of that erroneous belief. If, forexample, I thought, My wife never listens to me, I’d feel lonely, mad, and sad.I would give myself permission to be rude to her or ignore her. My reaction tothe lie I was telling myself could cause a negative spiral in my marriage, whichcould then literally ruin the rest of my life.By repeatedly allowing his undisciplined thoughts to invade his mind, tellinghimself he was stupid, a failure, and a terrible person who hated school and washated by his teachers, Marcus was more likely to behave in ways that would makethose terrible things happen. I told him that his brain makes happen what itsees, which is why it is critical to get control over your thoughts.DISCIPLINED THINKING PRINCIPLE #5: YOU CAN LEARN TO ELIMINATE THE ANTS, ORAUTOMATIC NEGATIVE THOUGHTS, THAT STEAL YOUR HAPPINESS.I coined the term ANTs in the early 1990s after a hard day at the office, whereI had seen four suicidal patients, two teens who had run away from home, and twocouples who hated each other. That evening, when I arrived home and walked intothe kitchen, I was greeted by an ant infestation. There were thousands of thepesky invaders marching in lines on the floor and crawling in the sink, on thecountertops, and in the cabinets. Construction in our neighborhood had disturbedthe earth, and the ants were looking for a new residence. As I wetted papertowels and began wiping up the horde of ants, the acronym ANT came tome —Automatic Negative Thought. Acronyms had been part of my life since medicalschool, helping me remember the 50,000 new terms I was learning. As I thoughtabout my patients that day, I realized that, just like my kitchen, they werealso infested with ANTs that were robbing them of their joy and stealing theirhappiness. A bizarre image came to me of ANTs crawling on top of their heads andout of their eyes, noses, and ears. The ANTs were setting up residence inside mypatients’ minds. The next day, I brought a can of ant spray to work and placedit on my coffee table. As I started to talk about the concept with patients,they understood it right away.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ANTs are thoughts that pop into your mind uninvited. They make you feel mad,sad, worried, or upset. And most of the time they’re not even true!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learning how to direct, question, and correct your automatic negative thoughtsis not a new concept. Two of my favorite New Testament verses from the apostlePaul are Philippians 4:8 (“Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever isright, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable —if anythingis excellent or praiseworthy —think about such things”) and Romans 12:2 (“Betransformed by the renewing of your mind”). Even 2,000 years ago, Paul taughtabout the benefits of filling our minds with what is good and positive. And morerecently, in the 1960s, psychiatrist Aaron Beck formalized a school ofpsychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is a structuredway to teach patients to challenge and eliminate negative thoughts.As the discussions about ANTs in my office continued, I replaced the can of antspray with a black ant puppet and an adorable, furry anteater puppet. I thendeveloped a simple exercise to help my patients eliminate the ANTs: Whenever youfeel sad, mad, nervous, or out of control, write down your automatic negativethoughts. The act of writing down the ANTs helps to get the invaders out of yourhead. People loved the concept and found it easy to follow. Early on, I taughtANT therapy to a nine-year-old boy who suffered with debilitating anxiety anddepression. After several weeks he told me he was feeling much better. He said,“It’s an ANT ghost town in my head.” In 2017, I published a children’s book,Captain Snout and the Super Power Questions: Don’t Let the ANTs Steal YourHappiness, that explains the therapy to kids.Think of automatic negative thoughts as you would the ants that might bother acouple at a romantic picnic. One negative thought, like one ant at a picnic, isnot a big problem. Two or three automatic negative thoughts, like two or threeants at a picnic, become a bit more irritating. Twenty or thirty automaticnegative thoughts, like twenty or thirty ants at a picnic, may cause the coupleto pick up and leave. The more you allow the ANTs to stick around in your head,the more they will “mate” with other ANTs and produce offspring that driveschool failure, anxiety, depression, anger, work strife, relationship turmoil,and even obesity.You can learn to eliminate the automatic negative thoughts and replace them withmore helpful thoughts that give you a more accurate, fair assessment of anysituation. It’s not positive thinking that ignores reality; instead, I advocateaccurate, honest thinking. This skill alone can completely change your life ifyou embrace and practice it.With a bit of practice, you can choose to think helpful thoughts and feel good,or you can choose to think toxic thoughts and feel lousy. It’s up to you! Oneway to begin is to notice your thoughts when they are negative, write them down,and talk back to them. If you can correct negative thoughts, you take away theirpower. When you have a negative thought without challenging it, your mindbelieves it and your body reacts to it.Whenever you notice these ANTs, you need to crush them, or they’ll ruin yourrelationships, your self-esteem, and your personal power.DISCIPLINED THINKING PRINCIPLE #6: YOU CAN FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE SEVENDIFFERENT ANT SPECIES.Over the years therapists have identified seven different types of negativethought patterns that keep your mind off balance. I think of these as “species”of ANTs. They go by various names, but these are the ones I like to use: 1. All-or-Nothing ANTs 2. Just the Bad ANTs 3. Guilt-Beating ANTs 4. Labeling ANTs 5. Fortune-Teller ANTs 6. Mind Reader ANTs 7. Blaming ANTs 1. All-or-Nothing ANTs. These sneaky ANTs make you feel sorry for yourself. They don’t use words like sometimes or maybe. All-or-Nothing ANTs think in absolutes —words like all, always, never, none, nothing, no one, everyone, and every time. I once met a woman on one of my tours for public television who told me she hated the gym so much that she would never exercise. I asked her, “Do you like to dance?” She replied, “Oh, I love to dance.” “How about taking a walk on the beach?” I asked. “I like that too,” she said. When I told her that dancing and walking on the beach are forms of exercise, she gave me a puzzled look. She had always equated “exercise” with the gym. When she realized that any type of physical activity qualified as exercise, she said, “Maybe I don’t hate to exercise; maybe I just hate the gym.” This is an example of all-or-nothing thinking, when you believe that everything is either all good or all bad. It is the same as black-and-white thinking. When Marcus told me, “I can never be as good as other kids,” that was an example of an All-or-Nothing ANT. When I asked if he was 100 percent sure he could never be as good as the other kids, he gave me several examples of areas in which he excelled. Questioning the ANTs helps to send them packing. Here are a few more examples of All-or-Nothing ANTs: We had an argument. I think it’s over. My child isn’t doing well at school. I’ve failed as a parent. One of my favorite employees just quit; I am an awful supervisor. I have always been fat; it will never change. Every time I try to exercise, I get injured. She’s always in a bad mood. No one ever listens to me. I don’t like any of the foods that are good for me. 2. Just the Bad ANTs. This ANT can’t see anything good! Its beady eyes zoom in on mistakes and problems, and it fills your head with failure, frustration, sadness, and fear. As discussed above, the brain is wired for negativity, and this ANT can take virtually any positive experience and taint it with negativity. It is the judge, jury, and executioner of new experiences, new relationships, and new habits. I always hate school is an example of one of Marcus’s Just the Bad ANTs. When I asked him if he always really hated school, he said no. He liked sports, time with his friends, and math. Other examples of Just the Bad ANTs include I wanted to lose 30 pounds in 10 weeks, but I’ve only lost 8 pounds. I’m a complete failure. I went to the gym and did a hard workout, but the guy on the bike next to me was talking the whole time, so I’m never going back there. I gave a presentation at work to 30 people. Even though people told me they liked it, one person fell asleep during my talk, so it must have really been terrible. As we’ve seen, focusing on the negative releases brain chemicals that make you feel bad, and that reduces brain activity in the area involved with self-control, judgment, and planning. This increases the odds of your making bad choices, such as ordering a third drink, eating a bowlful of chips, or staying up so late updating your social networking site that you wake up exhausted and need to guzzle caffeine to get going. Focusing on Just the Bad ANTs sets you up for failure, while focusing on the positive will improve your mood and help you feel better about yourself. Putting a positive spin on your thoughts leads to positive changes in your brain that make you happier and smarter. Here’s how one could think differently about those situations listed above: I have already lost 8 pounds and have changed my lifestyle, so I will continue to lose weight until I reach my goal of losing 30 pounds. After working out, I had a lot more energy for the rest of the day. Most people told me they liked my presentation. I wonder if the person who fell asleep during it stayed up too late last night. 3. Guilt-Beating ANTs. Growing up Roman Catholic and going to parochial schools through ninth grade, I had to pass Guilt 101 and Advanced Guilt. Only kidding —but should and shouldn’t were common words when I was growing up. Of course, there are many important should and shouldn’t thoughts, but in my 35 years as a psychiatrist, I’ve found that guilt is generally not a helpful motivator of behavior. It often backfires and can be counterproductive to your goals. When Marcus told me he “should try harder in school,” it wasn’t helping him actually do better. In fact, to Marcus, it seemed the harder he tried, the worse he performed. Thinking in words like should, must, ought to, and have to is typical of Guilt-Beating ANTs. Here are some examples: I should visit my parents. I have to give up sugar. I must start counting my calories. I ought to go to the gym more. I should be more giving. What happens when you allow these ANTs to circle in your mind? Do they make you more inclined to visit your parents, cut the sugar, count calories, hit the gym, or be more giving? I doubt it. It is human nature to push back when we feel as if we “must” do something, even if it is to our benefit. It is better to replace the Guilt-Beating ANTs with phrases like I want to do this, It fits with my goals to do that, or It would be helpful to do this. In the examples above, it would be beneficial to change the phrases to I want to visit my parents because they are special to me. My goal is to stop eating sugar because it will reduce my cravings; prevent energy crashes, diabetes, and inflammation in my body; and get me off this emotional roller coaster. I want to count my calories because it will help me learn to take control of my eating. It is in my best interest to go to the gym because it will help me feel more energized. I am a giving person, and it is my goal to give more to causes I believe are worthwhile. 4. Labeling ANTs. Whenever you label yourself or someone else with a negative term, you inhibit your ability to take an honest look at the situation. When Marcus thought, I am an idiot, he lumped himself in with all of the people he ever thought were idiots, which damaged his self-esteem and his ability to make progress in his life. Labeling ANTs strengthen negative pathways in the brain, making the ruts deeper and their walls thicker. These habitual ruts lead to troubled behaviors. If, for example, you label yourself as “lazy,” then why bother trying to do better in school or at work? The Labeling ANT will cause you to give up before you try, and it will keep you stuck in your old ways. Examples of Labeling ANTs include He’s a jerk. I’m lazy. I’m a loser. She’s cold. I’m a lousy businessperson. Even positive labels can be harmful. I tell parents, for example, never to praise children for being smart; praise them instead for working hard. When you tell children they are smart, they become more performance oriented and assume that intelligence cannot be improved. If they start to struggle with a new task, they may feel “not smart” and give up. But if you praise children for working hard, when they come up against a difficult task, they will persist because “they work hard.” 5. Fortune-Teller ANTs. Don’t listen to these lying ANTs! Fortune-Teller ANTs think they can see what is going to happen in the future, but all they really do is think up bad stuff that makes you upset. They creep into your mind and predict the future with fear. Of course, it is helpful to prepare for potential problems, but if you spend all your time focused on a fearful future, you will be filled with anxiety. Marcus’s anxiety was driven by his Fortune-Teller ANTs, such as I will fail school . . . I’ll never go to college . . . I will be a failure. Other examples of this deceiver include If I run, I’ll sprain my ankle. If I give that presentation, I will have a panic attack. None of my investments will pay off. If I go to bed earlier, I’m just going to lie there awake for hours. After my divorce, I’ll never find another love relationship. Predicting the worst in a situation causes an immediate rise in heart and breathing rates and can make you feel anxious. It can trigger cravings for sugar or refined carbs and make you feel as if you need to eat to calm your anxiety. What makes Fortune-Teller ANTs even worse is that your mind is so powerful, it can make happen what you imagine. When you think you will sprain your ankle, for example, that thought may deactivate the cerebellum, making you more clumsy and likely to get hurt. Similarly, if you are convinced you won’t get a good night’s sleep or find a new relationship, you will be less likely to engage in the behaviors that might make it so. I helped Marcus eliminate this ANT by teaching him how to talk back to it: I will find a way to succeed . . . I’ll go to college if I want to . . . I will succeed with hard work. 6. Mind Reader ANTs. This ANT is convinced it can see inside someone else’s mind and know how others think and feel without even being told. It says things like “Everyone thinks I am stupid,” or “They are laughing at me.” When you’re sure you know what others are thinking even though they have not told you and you have not asked them, you are feeding your Mind Reader ANTs. When Marcus told me, “My teachers hate me,” he was allowing this ANT to torture him. I have 25 years of education, and I can’t tell what anyone else is thinking unless they tell me. A glance in your direction doesn’t mean somebody is talking about you or mad at you. I tell people that a negative look from someone else may mean nothing more than that he or she is constipated! You just don’t know. I teach all my patients the “18-40-60 Rule,” which says that when you are 18 you worry about what everyone thinks of you; when you are 40 you don’t care what anyone thinks about you; and when you are 60 you realize no one has been thinking about you at all. People spend their days worrying and thinking about themselves, not about you. Stop trying to read their minds. Examples include My boss doesn’t like me. My martial arts teacher doesn’t respect me because I’m fat. My friends think I won’t be able to keep up with them on our hike. My father thinks I’ll never amount to much. Don’t let this ANT erase your good feelings. When there are things you don’t understand, ask for clarification. Mind Reader ANTs are infectious and cause trouble between people. 7. Blaming ANTs. When things go wrong, the Blaming ANT always sings the same old sad song: He did it! She did it! It’s not my fault! It’s your fault! This ANT doesn’t want you to admit your mistakes or to learn how to fix things and make them right; it wants you to be a victim. Of all the ANTs, Blaming ANTs are the most toxic. I call them red ANTs, because they not only steal your happiness, they also drain you of your personal power. When you blame something or someone else for the problems in your life, you become a victim of circumstances who can’t do anything to change the situation. When Marcus said, “It’s my parents’ fault for not letting me quit,” he was allowing the Blaming ANT to take hold in his brain. Be honest with yourself and ask yourself if you have a tendency to say things like If only you hadn’t done that, I would have been successful. It’s your fault I failed because you didn’t do enough to help me. It’s not my fault I eat too much; my mom taught me to clean my plate. I’m having trouble meeting this deadline because the client keeps changing his mind. I’m miserable, and it’s all his fault! My boyfriend didn’t call on time, and now it’s too late to go to that movie I wanted to see. He’s ruined my night! Beginning a sentence with “It is your fault that I . . .” can ruin your life. Blaming ANTs make you a victim, and when you are a victim, you are powerless to change your behavior. In order to break free from the Blaming ANT addiction, you have to change your thinking by making it your responsibility to change. It is your life. I love what author Vernon Howard once wrote: “Permitting your life to be taken over by another person is like letting the waiter eat your dinner.” At the same time, self-blame is equally toxic. Always strive to be a good coach to yourself, rather than someone who is toxic or abusive.SEVEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANTS (OR HOW WE DISTORT REALITY TO MAKE IT WORSE THANIT REALLY IS) 1. All-or-Nothing ANTs: Thinking that things are either all good or all bad 2. Just the Bad ANTs: Seeing only the bad in a situation 3. Guilt-Beating ANTs: Thinking in words like should, must, ought, or have to 4. Labeling ANTs: Attaching a negative label to yourself or someone else 5. Fortune-Teller ANTs: Predicting the worst possible outcome for a situation with little or no evidence for it 6. Mind Reader ANTs: Believing you know what other people are thinking even though they haven’t told you 7. Blaming ANTs: Blaming someone else for your problemsSEVEN STRATEGIES TO MASTER YOUR MINDIt is possible to learn how to listen to your thoughts and redirect them so thatyou feel happier and more positive. Here are seven strategies that will help youput what I have just discussed into practice.STRATEGY #1: ELIMINATE ANTS AS THEY ATTACK.5 to 15 minutes. [images/x05-15-min.jpg]Get a journal or use the note app on your phone, and whenever you feel sad, mad,nervous, or out of control, 1. Write down your automatic negative thoughts (ANTs). 2. Identify the ANT species. (It may be more than one.) 3. Ask yourself if you are 100 percent sure the thought is true.Shining a beam of truth on the ANTs causes them to disintegrate. Here are sixexamples from my patients: 1. From a woman who was raped, who came to see me for anxiety and depression: ANT: I am fractured. ANT Species: She listed it as an All-or-Nothing and Labeling ANT. Is It True? “It is not true,” she wrote. “I am a good person who was attacked. I can overcome it to become whole.” Talking back to the thought takes away its power. 2. From a father whose adult son was a drug addict: ANT: I am not a good father. ANT Species: He listed it as an All-or-Nothing and Guilt-Beating ANT. Is It True? “It is not true,” he wrote. “I was present and loving. Addiction runs in our family, but ultimately it was my son’s choice to engage in behaviors where he lost control. I will be there to support him as I can, but I cannot control his life.” 3. From a woman whose son was murdered: ANT: I am evil for wanting his murderer to be punished. ANT Species: She listed it as a Labeling ANT. Is It True? “It is not true,” she wrote. “I am a good person with a loving heart. I miss my son so much and have hope I will see him again in heaven.” 4. From a woman having marital problems, who felt herself becoming more clinging and desperate: ANT: My husband will leave me and I will be all alone. ANT Species: She listed it as a Fortune-Teller ANT. Is It True? She wrote, “I don’t know if it is true, but if I keep acting anxious and desperate, he will leave me. I need to be strong no matter what happens.” 5. From a man who was fired from work because of his temper: ANT: I am a bad person and will never find another job. My family will be destitute. ANT Species: He listed it as a Labeling and Fortune-Teller ANT. Is It True? “I need to understand and fix my temper,” he told me. “I am a good person and will work to find another job to care for my family and myself.” 6. From a young adult who was struggling in college: ANT: I’ll never be as good as my friends. ANT Species: He listed it as an All-or-Nothing ANT. Is It True? He told me, “I am better than my friends at some things and not at others. I need to stop being so hard on myself.”Confronting ANTs with truth is a powerful tool. Several months after Marcuslearned to eliminate the ANTs, his anxiety and depression were remarkablyreduced and his school performance improved. He went on to graduate from collegewith honors and eventually from law school. Don’t believe every stupid thoughtyou have.STRATEGY #2: STOP MONKEY MIND BY PAYING ATTENTION TO IT.10 minutes. [images/x10-min.jpg]We all deal with disjointed thoughts at times, but one of the best ways to stopthe monkeys from ruining your mind with all their distractions is to startpaying attention to them. When you ignore your inner life, likeattention-starved children the monkeys start to misbehave, torture you, belittleyou, and wreak all sorts of havoc. However, when you start noticing yourthoughts, evaluating them, or even being amused by them, they loosen theircontrol over your emotional life.Taking time to reflect and direct your inner life can help you train the monkeysto work for you, rather than threaten your sanity. Meditation is a wonderful wayto get control of your mind (see chapter 1, pages 20–21[chapter_1.xhtml#page_20]). Research has shown that meditation can slow yourheart rate, lower blood pressure, increase circulation, aid digestion,strengthen your immune system, improve cognition, focus, and memory, anddecrease brain aging, addictions, anxiety, depression, and irritability.[131]Devoting a few minutes each day to this practice, whether by meditating on aScripture passage or doing the Loving-Kindness Meditation, will help you quietyour mind.STRATEGY #3: START EVERY DAY WITH THE PHRASE “TODAY IS GOING TO BE A GREAT DAY.”10 seconds. [images/x10-sec.jpg]As soon as you awaken or your feet hit the floor in the morning, say these wordsout loud. Since your mind is prone to negativity, it will find stress in theupcoming day unless you train and discipline it. When you direct your thoughtsto Today is going to be a great day, your brain will help you uncover thereasons why it will be so. When I’m on a tour for public television, forexample, and I wake up in a different city every morning, my brain couldanticipate everything that could go wrong, including the hassles of travel,causing me to feel lousy. Instead, when I say, “Today is going to be a greatday,” I think of all the wonderful people I’ll meet or lives that may be changedby our work, and I enjoy the journey.You have a choice in where you direct your attention, even in times of loss.This simple strategy can make a powerfully positive difference in your life.STRATEGY #4: RECORD YOUR MOODS AND LOOK FOR WAYS TO INCREASE GRATITUDE.15 to 30 minutes. [images/x15-30-min.jpg]Business professionals frequently say, “You cannot change what you do notmeasure.” That’s why it’s smart to keep a daily journal to record and measurethe feeling(s) you want to decrease, such as anxiety, fear, sadness, anger, orgrief, or that you want to increase, such as joy, happiness, or another emotion.Write down a feeling and evaluate it on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is “awful”and 10 is “great.” Once you have established this baseline, you can see which ofthe interventions in Feel Better Fast and Make It Last work best for you.Whenever you have a difficult day or several days, you can look at your journaland try to spot trends, such as certain days of the week, times of the day, timeof your menstrual cycle, whether you have eaten or not, and more.One of the early lessons I learned as a psychiatrist was that I could makenearly anyone cry or feel upset by the questions I asked. If I asked people tothink about their worst memories —the times they failed, the incidents wherethey were most embarrassed, or the day they lost someone they loved —withinseconds they would feel bad. But the opposite was also true. If I asked them tothink about their happiest moments —the times they succeeded or theirexperiences of falling in love —they generally started to smile. Here are sixquick journaling exercises to help you change your focus. 1. Write out three things for which you are grateful. Gratitude helps direct your attention toward positive feelings and away from negative ones. Dr. Hans Selye, considered one of the pioneers of stress research, wrote, “Nothing erases unpleasant thoughts more effectively than conscious concentration on pleasant ones.”[132] If I could bottle gratitude, I would. The benefits far outweigh almost all of the medications I prescribe, without any side effects. A wealth of research suggests that a daily practice of gratitude, which can be as simple as writing down several things we’re grateful for every day, can improve our emotions, health, relationships, personalities, and careers. From a wonderful blog post by Amit Amin[133] at Happier Human and Courtney Ackerman at the Positive Psychology Program,[134] research suggests that gratitude can enhance * Happiness * Well-being * Mood * Self-esteem * Resilience * Sense of spirituality * Impulse to give * Optimism * Reduction in materialism * Reduction in self-centeredness * Recovery from substance misuse * Resistance to stress * Resistance to envy * Friendships * Love relationships * Career * Networking ability * Productivity * Goal achievement * Reduction in turnover * Decision-making among physicians * Physical health, including * Physical appearance * Better sleep * Fewer physical symptoms * More time exercising * Less physical pain * Lower blood pressure in people who were hypertensive * Recovery from coronary events * Vitality and energy * Longevity[135] Focusing on gratitude has been found to increase the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system and decrease inflammatory markers;[136] improve depression, stress, and happiness;[137] reduce stress among caregivers;[138] and, among the elderly, significantly decrease state anxiety and depression as well as increase specific memories, life satisfaction, and subjective happiness.[139] When you make a habit of bringing your attention to the things you’re grateful for, you enhance how your brain works. In times of stress, take a minute to write down three things —big or small —you’re grateful for. You might find you have trouble stopping at three. 2. Share a gratitude letter. Martin Seligman, PhD, considered the father of positive psychology, developed this powerful gratitude exercise along with his team at the University of Pennsylvania: Write a 300-word essay about someone you are grateful for, such as a teacher, mentor, friend, boss, or coworker. When you have finished, if possible, make an appointment with that person and read the essay aloud to him or her. Research has shown that doing this significantly increased life satisfaction scores and happiness and decreased symptoms of depression.[140] 3. Express your appreciation. To enhance gratitude, add appreciation, which is gratitude that is outwardly expressed and builds bridges between people. Expressing support and appreciation to others has been shown to decrease the stress response in the brain much more powerfully than receiving support.[141] It is better for your brain to give than to receive. To supercharge joyful thinking, get in the habit of writing down the name of one person whom you appreciate and why; then share your feelings with that person with a quick e-mail, text, or call. Do this once a week, and try not to repeat anyone for two months. This exercise will help you build many bridges of goodwill. 4. Count your blessings. You can boost your good feelings if you count your blessings instead of sheep at night. In a study of 221 teenagers, the group that focused on counting their blessings reported increases in gratitude, optimism, and life satisfaction and decreases in negative feelings.[142] At bedtime, write down as many good things in your life as you can think of in three minutes. 5. Note down what went well. Another exercise that has been shown to quickly increase your level of well-being is called “What Went Well.” Research has shown that people who did this exercise were happier and less depressed at one-month and six-month follow-ups than at the study’s outset.[143] Right before bed, write down three things that went well that day; then ask yourself, “Why did this happen?” This simple exercise has been found to help people in stressful jobs develop more positive emotions.[144] 6. Focus on your accomplishments. I once treated a very successful businesswoman who made millions of dollars. She was struggling with anxiety and depression, and she felt that she was a failure and her life was worthless. She repeatedly focused on one incident where a reporter, who as far as I could tell accomplished little in his life except trashing successful people, had harshly criticized her in a magazine article. She played the article over and over in her mind. She had an obsessive pattern in her brain, where she tended to get stuck on negative thoughts and behaviors. Her first homework assignment was to write out her accomplishments in as much detail as she liked. At her next session she brought eight pages full of accomplishments, including employing 500 people, doing charity work, and maintaining strong relationships. The exercise made her feel great and quickly changed her focus. Write down the highest and most positive moments of your life. If you can find one moment, odds are you can find two. If you find two, you will likely find four, and so on. By bringing your attention to your successes, you are much more likely to feel better fast.BENEFITS OF GRATITUDEDiagram of a circle around the word happiness, with arrows pointing down to thetop of the circle to icons along the bottom that show icons for five differentareas: 1. The area of personality: Less materialistic. Less self-centered. Moreoptimistic. Increased self-esteem. More spiritual. 2. The area of physicalhealth: Improved sleep. Less sickness. Increased longevity. Increased energy.More exercise. 3. The area of emotional health: More good feelings. Morerelaxed. More resilient. Less envious. Happier memories. 4. The area of career:Better management. Improved networking. More goals achieved. Improveddecision-making. Increased productivity. 5. The area of social health: Moresocial connections. Healthier marriage. Kinder. More friendships. Deeperrelationships. [images/Illustration-5.1.jpg]STRATEGY #5: CREATE OPTIMISM WITH A DOSE OF REALITY TO BUILD RESILIENCE FAST.Dr. Seligman developed a concept known as learned helplessness that has had apowerful influence over my career.[145] He found that when dogs, rats, mice, andeven cockroaches experienced painful shocks over which they had no control,eventually they would just accept the pain without attempting to escape. Humans,he discovered, do the same thing. In a series of experiments, his research teamrandomly divided subjects into three groups: those who were exposed to a loudnoise they could stop by pushing a button; those who heard the irritating noisebut couldn’t turn it off; and a control group who heard nothing at all. Thefollowing day the subjects faced a new research task that again involved painfulsounds. To turn it off, all they had to do was move their hands about 12 inches.The people in the first and third groups figured this out quickly and were ableto turn off the noise. But most of the people in the second group did nothing atall. Expecting failure, they didn’t even try to escape the irritating noise.They had learned to be helpless.Yet —and this is where it gets exciting —about one-third of the people in grouptwo, who had been unable to escape the pain, never became helpless. Why? Theanswer turned out to be optimism. Dr. Seligman’s team discovered that people whodo not give up interpret the pain and setbacks as * temporary as opposed to permanent; * limited instead of pervasive; and * changeable instead of out of their control.Optimists would say things like “It will go away quickly; it’s just this onesituation, and I can do something about it.” Dr. Seligman’s team came to believethat teaching optimism could help inoculate people against anxiety, depression,posttraumatic stress disorder, and relationship problems. Here are some of hismain ideas: 1. Listen to yourself and others to see how things are explained. Are the people powerful or victims? Do they have control or no control? Are hardships permanent or temporary? Pessimists describe bad things as permanent and pervasive and good things as temporary, while optimists describe things in just the reverse: the bad as temporary and the good as permanent and pervasive. 2. Change your language and feelings around the situations you face. You can stop being a victim, take control wherever possible, and understand that hardships are usually temporary. 3. Allow mistakes to be learning experiences, rather than a final judgment on your self-worth. Everyone makes mistakes; it’s how you respond to them that determines how quickly you recover. Accepting a mistake and looking for the lesson you can take away from it will help you get over it and move on.PESSIMISM AND OPTIMISM ARE HABITS OF THINKINGPESSIMISTS (FEEL HELPLESS)OPTIMISTS (FEEL HOPEFUL)See problems as permanentSee problems as temporarySee problems as pervasiveSee problems as limitedSee no personal controlSee personal control or influenceSee failure as a statement about selfSee failure as a lessonHave low self-efficacyFeel self-confidentFocus on problemsAre forward thinkingTend to be hopelessTend to be hopefulTend to give upTend to stick with difficult thingsAre less proactive with healthAre more proactive with healthHold grudgesForgive more easilyFocus on worries and negativityAre less likely to dwell on the negativeFeel more stressedFeel less stressedAre more likely to have insomniaAre more likely to sleep betterSee glass as half-emptySee glass as half-fullAre more withholdingAre more altruisticStrive to take control of your life, be forward thinking, and see possibilities.A huge study involving more than 97,000 people found that those who wereoptimistic had significantly lower heart disease than those who werepessimistic.[146] Women who scored highly on “cynical hostility” were also morelikely to develop coronary heart disease. Optimism is also associated with ahigher quality of life,[147] a lower incidence of stroke,[148] improved immunesystem function,[149] better pain tolerance,[150] and longer survival in lungcancer patients.[151]Yet as we’ve seen, blind optimism can lead to early death. The Longevity Projectfrom Stanford University found that people who were mindlessly optimistic diedthe earliest from accidents and preventable illnesses.[152] Being sleep-deprivedled to increased optimism and poorer life choices.[153] College students whowere too optimistic had more binge-drinking behavior,[154] and compulsivegamblers were often rated as too optimistic.[155] The bottom line: It is alwaysbest to balance optimism with planning for and preventing future trouble. Beingoptimistic about eating a third bowl of ice cream with caramel sauce will leadto early death, no matter how much you wish it wouldn’t.STRATEGY #6: CHANGE THE B STUFF.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We are not controlled by events or people, but by our perceptions of them.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I once heard the following story: At the turn of the century a shoe company senta representative to Africa. He wired back, “I’m coming home. No one wears shoeshere.” Another company sent their representative, who sold thousands of shoes.He wired back to his company, “Business is fantastic. No one has ever heard ofshoes here.” The two representatives perceived the same situation from markedlydifferent perspectives, and they obtained dramatically different results.Perception is the way we, as individuals, interpret ourselves and the worldaround us. Our five senses take in the world, but perception occurs as ourbrains process the incoming information through our “feeling filters.” When ourfilters feel good, we translate information in a positive way. When our filtersare angry or hostile, we perceive the world as negative toward us. Ourperceptions of the outside world are based on our inner worlds. When we’refeeling tired, for example, we’re much more likely to be irritated by a child’sbehavior that usually doesn’t bother us.Our view of a situation has a greater impact on our lives than the situationitself. Noted psychiatrist Richard Gardner has said that the world is like aRorschach test, where a person is asked to describe what he or she sees in10 inkblots that mean absolutely nothing. What we see in the inkblot is based onour inner view of the world; our perceptions bear witness to our state of mind.As we think, so do we perceive. Therefore, in reality, we need not seek tochange the outside world but rather to change our inner worlds. I teach all ofmy patients the A-B-C model:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A is the actual event,B is how we interpret or perceive the event, andC is how we react to the event.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Other people or events (A) can’t make us do anything. It is our interpretationor perception (B) that causes our behavior (C). Consider, for instance, the timeI yawned during a therapy session with a patient. He asked if I found himboring. I replied that it was important that he asked. I had been up most of theprevious night with an emergency and was tired, but I found what he was sayingvery interesting. My yawning was A, his interpretation that I was bored was B,and his asking me about it was C. I was glad he asked about my yawn because somepatients’ C would have been to leave the therapy session with a negativefeeling. When we can allow ourselves to look at the alternatives and challengeour initial negative perceptions, we’ve traveled a long way toward emotionalhealth.Questioning the B stuff is so important. It can make the difference between ameaningful life and death. Think about the two New Testament stories of Judasand Peter, two of Jesus’ disciples, betraying Jesus on the night He was arrested(see Matthew 26:69–27:10). Judas accepted money to identify Jesus to the Templeguards, who arrested Him. Later that night Peter denied he even knewJesus —three times. A was betrayal. B was their interpretation of the betrayal:Judas felt he had committed an unforgivable sin; Peter was ashamed and wept. Cwas each of their reactions: Judas returned the 30 pieces of silver and thenhanged himself, while Peter asked for and was given forgiveness and later becamea central figure in starting the Christian church. If we don’t question ourperceptions, they can take us to places we don’t want to go.STRATEGY #7: WATCH THE DISNEY MOVIE POLLYANNA.One of my favorite movies of all time is the Disney movie Pollyanna, based onthe 1913 book of the same name by Eleanor Porter. After her missionary parentsdied, Pollyanna came to live with her aunt Polly and was able to help turn adivided small town with many negative people into a positive community. Sheintroduced them to “the glad game,” which involved looking for things to be gladabout in any situation. Her father had taught her this game once when she wasvery disappointed. She had always wanted a doll, but her parents never hadenough money to buy one for her. When her father asked his missionary sponsorsto send a secondhand doll, by mistake they sent Pollyanna a pair of crutches.How can I be glad about crutches? she wondered. Then she decided she could beglad because she didn’t need to use them. This simple game changed the attitudesand lives of many people in the movie. Pollyanna even told the minister what herfather had taught her: The Bible had 800 “glad passages,” and if God mentionedbeing glad that many times, it must be because He wants us to think that way.Focusing on the negative in situations will make you feel bad. Playing the gladgame, or looking for the positive, will help you feel better. This movie isworth the 134-minute investment.It’s no exaggeration to say that developing accurate, honest, and disciplinedthinking can change your life. If you get rid of the ANTs, practice gratitude,manage your perceptions, and follow these other strategies, you’ll see adecrease in worry, anxiety, anger, and negativity and be on your way to feelingbetter fast.SEVEN STRATEGIES TO MASTER YOUR MINDDeveloping strategies for accurate, honest, and disciplined thinking is criticalto success. To accomplish this, 1. Eliminate ANTs as they attack. 2. Stop monkey mind by paying attention to it. 3. Start every day with the phrase “Today is going to be a great day.” 4. Record your moods and look for ways to increase gratitude. 5. Create optimism with a dose of reality to build resilience fast. 6. Change the B stuff. 7. Watch the Disney movie Pollyanna.TINY HABITS THAT CAN HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FAST—AND LEAD TO BIG CHANGES10 seconds to 15 minutes. [images/x10-sec-15-min.jpg]Each of these habits takes no more than a few minutes. They are anchored tosomething you do (or think or feel) so that they are more likely to becomeautomatic. Once you do the behaviors you want, find a way to make yourself feelgood about them—draw a happy face, pump your fist, or do whatever feels natural.Emotion helps the brain to remember. 1. When my feet hit the floor first thing in the morning, I will say to myself, “Today is going to be a great day.” 2. After an ANT pops up, I will write down my negative thought and ask, “Is it true?” 3. After I get home and put away my keys, I will push play on a meditation audio. 4. Before I go to bed, I will count my blessings, listing at least three. 5. After I have a negative thought, I will think of what went well that day. 6. When I face a difficult situation, I will ask myself, “What is there to be glad about in this situation?” 7. After breakfast, I will think of one person I appreciate, and reach out and tell him or her in a quick text or note.[124] Association for Psychological Science, “Believing the Future Will BeFavorable May Prevent Action,” ScienceDaily, August 3, 2017,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170803145643.htm[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170803145643.htm].[125] K.

Our social attachments bring us our greatest joys and our mostpainful sorrows. When relationships are stressed or break apart, people becomeunhappy and are vulnerable to acting in counterproductive ways. To use acomputer analogy, attachments are like network connections that link us toothers in meaningful ways. Brain health is often the missing piece inunderstanding healthy or difficult relationships, trauma, and grief. These twochapters will give you powerful tools to improve any relationship and helpeliminate the hurts that haunt you. In chapter 6 I’ll look at habits that canelevate all of your relationships, and in chapter 7 I’ll share helpful ways todeal with the grief and trauma that can come from loss, broken relationships, orother difficult circumstances."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6HEALING CONNECTIONSHOW TO IMPROVE ANY RELATIONSHIP--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The magic ratio is 5:1. We have found that as long as there are five positiveinteractions for every negative interaction, a couple can have a stable andhappy relationship over time.JOHN GOTTMAN, PHDTruth is, everybody is going to hurt you: you just gotta find the ones worthsuffering for.ATTRIBUTED TO BOB MARLEY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Good relationships keep us happier and healthier, according to a 75-yearlongevity study from Harvard University. Positive social connections help uslive longer, while loneliness kills us early. Sadly, one in five Americans islonely, which means this is a public health problem too. Another lesson from thestudy: Being in positive, warm, satisfying relationships keeps our brains andbodies healthy into older age, while being in relationships filled with conflictis associated with sickness and early death.[156]Emotional crises, panic attacks, depression, and obsessive behaviors are oftentriggered by the loss or threatened loss of a relationship. Marital problems,affairs, domestic violence, breakups —all of these relationship problems promptpeople to come and see us at Amen Clinics. It is common for us to hearstatements like “My marriage is falling apart,” “All my relationships arefailing,” or “I want to be a better husband and stop hurting my family.”Improving your social connections is one of the best ways to start to feelbetter fast and make it last.Unlike polar bears, humans require social interaction to stay healthy. We have afundamental need to belong that’s just as essential as our need for food andwater. People who are socially connected are happier and healthier, and theylive longer.[157] People who are married are less likely to develop dementiathan those who have never been married (lifelong singles have a 42 percenthigher risk) or those who are widowed (their risk is 20 percent higher),according to recent research. (The association did not apply to divorcedindividuals.[158]) Loneliness or disconnection from others is also associatedwith an increased rate of depression, cognitive decline, and dementia.[159]Being in loving relationships is every bit as important as sleep, a healthydiet, and exercise.Naomi Eisenberger, PhD, a professor in social psychology at the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles, has demonstrated in a fascinating series of studiesthat loss, or being socially excluded or rejected, activates the physical paincenters in the brain, and those who are more sensitive to physical pain are alsomore sensitive to social rejection. In addition, Eisenberger has shown thattaking pain medication, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), can help to amelioratethe pain of social rejection.[160] When it comes to the brain, a broken heart isnot so different from a broken leg.Rejection can also trigger aggression. Animals that are in physical pain oftenreact toward others with aggression. Researchers who analyzed 15 school shootersin 2003 found that all but 2 suffered from social rejection.[161] Suicide,murder, and murder-suicides are often the consequence of broken social bonds.Relating to others in healthy, effective ways is ultimately a brain-based skill,yet even most marital therapists get zero training on or about the brain. Whenyour brain is healthy, you can perceive others more accurately, have goodcontrol over your emotions, and act in healthy ways that bring people closer toyou. Your brain allows you to read social cues, listen, respond appropriately,deal with conflict, set effective boundaries, act inclusively, and be attentivein moments of interaction. A brain with short circuits, whether yours or someoneelse’s, often interrupts effective relationships. Stop and think about it:Brains nurture, influence, stimulate, irritate, calm, and incite each other.Being raised by a parent with a difficult brain, having a spouse or boss withbrain problems, or even dealing with a friend, teacher, or coworker who needsbrain help can all cause immeasurable stress. Understanding the neuroscience ofrelationships will give you an uncommon advantage. As you care for your brain,all of your relationships are likely to improve.EIGHT BRAIN-BASED HABITS TO ELEVATE YOUR RELATIONSHIPSProfessor Howard Markman, director of the Center for Marital and Family Studiesat the University of Denver, can predict with 90 percent accuracy if a couplewill get divorced or stay married. He can make the prediction after watching a15-minute conversation between the spouses where they are instructed to discussan issue upon which they disagree. If the couple’s argument involves the habitsof blaming, belittling, escalation, invalidation, or withdrawal, their future isnot likely to be happy. However, if the couple communicates respect and sharedpurpose and stops escalation in a civil way, the future looks much morepositive. Markman also found that he could reduce divorce by one-third amongcouples to whom he taught several critical skills.[162] Good relationship habitscan be learned and enhanced by a healthy brain that can remember and implementthem.This chapter will provide you with eight brain-based habits clinically proven toincrease your relationship skills. In part, these techniques come from researchin the field of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Enhancing interpersonal skillhas proven effective in reducing anxiety, depression, and stress, and inimproving both business success and marital satisfaction. There are more than125 studies showing IPT’s effectiveness.[163] Even brain imaging studies haveshown how improving relationships can help normalize the brain in people who aredepressed.[164] The acronym RELATING will help you remember the essentialrelationship habits. * R is for Responsibility * E is for Empathy * L is for Listening and good communication skills * A is for appropriate Assertiveness * T is for actual, physical Time * I is for Inquiry and correcting negative thoughts * N is for Noticing what you like more than what you don’t * G is for Grace and forgivenessR IS FOR RESPONSIBILITYResponsibility is not about blame. It is about your ability to respond towhatever situation you are in, as in these examples:“It is my job to make this relationship better.”“I have the power to improve how we communicate and act toward each other.”“I have influence in my relationships that I exert in a positive way.”“I am responsible for my behaviors in our interactions.”People who take responsibility for their own behavior do better inrelationships. Those who constantly blame others set themselves up for alifetime of problems. Yet blame is fast and easy and even seems hardwired in thebrain. In a Duke University study, researchers scanned the brains of volunteerswhile they were asked to judge the intent of others in multiple situations. Oneof the scenarios was “The CEO knew the plan would harm the environment, but hedid not care at all about the effect the plan would have on it. He started theplan solely to increase profits. Did the CEO intentionally harm theenvironment?” Eighty-two percent of the volunteers said the CEO’s action wasdeliberate. When researchers replaced the word harm with help, only 23 percentsaid it was intentional. The scientists discovered that when volunteers “blamed”the CEO, their brains reacted faster and more powerfully, activating theamygdala, which is involved with the feelings of fear and threat. Those who sawpositive intention in the CEO’s behavior reacted more slowly, with less activityin the amygdala and more activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the brainregion discussed in chapter 3 that’s associated with forethought and executivefunction.[165]Blame is quick, common, and possibly self-protective against aggression, but itis also the first and most devastating hallmark of self-defeating behavior inrelationships. When you blame someone else and fail to take responsibility foryour own behavior, you become a victim of other people and are powerless tochange anything. If you struggle with blame, you’ll typically hear yourself saythings like“It wasn’t my fault that you took things the wrong way.”“That wouldn’t have happened if you had listened to me.”“It’s your fault that we are having trouble.”The bottom-line statement goes something like this: “If only you had donesomething differently, then I wouldn’t be in the predicament I am in. It’s yourfault, and I am not responsible.”Deflecting responsibility for relationship troubles or making excuses whenthings don’t go as you would like is the first step in a dangerous downhillslide. The slide typically follows this sequence:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Deflect responsibility“It’s your fault.”----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------See life as beyond personal control“My life would be better if you hadn’t done . . .”----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Feel like a victim“If only you would be different, then . . .”----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Give up trying“It is never going to work. Why even try?”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Deflecting responsibility temporarily makes you feel better, but it alsoreinforces the idea that your life is out of your control, that others candetermine how things will go for you. This causes inner turmoil, leading toanxiety and feelings of helplessness.Sarah came to see me for marital stress. She had been in psychotherapy withanother psychiatrist for more than three years but seemed to be getting nowhere.She complained that her husband was an alcoholic who mistreated her. She wasoften tearful and depressed and had problems concentrating. In our initialinterview it was clear that she took no responsibility for how her life wasturning out. She blamed her first husband for getting her pregnant at age 19 andfelt “forced” to marry him, but she complained that he was unmotivated, so shedivorced him. Then, in succession, she impulsively married two different men whowere alcoholics and physically abusive. Tearfully, she expressed feelings ofbeing continually victimized by men, including her current husband.At the end of the session I asked her what she had done to contribute to herproblems. Her mouth dropped open. Her previous psychiatrist had been a good paidlistener, but he never challenged her notion of helplessness. At the beginningof the next session she told me that she almost didn’t come back to see me. Shesaid, “You think it’s all my fault, don’t you?” I replied, “I don’t think it’sall your fault, but I think you have contributed to your troubles more than yougive yourself credit for; and if it’s true that you’ve contributed to yourproblems, then you can do things to change them. As long as you stay an innocentvictim of others, there is nothing you can do to help yourself.”Over several sessions Sarah got the message of personal responsibility and madea dramatic turnaround. She had grown up in a severely abusive alcoholic home,where she really was a victim of her circumstances, causing her amygdala tobecome overactive and making her feel constantly threatened. Unfortunately, shemaintained that role in her adult relationships, including at work. Herunconscious continuation of her abusive childhood was ruining her ability tohave control in her life.Invariably, in classes where I teach this concept, some people will tell me thattheir problem is not deflecting responsibility but rather taking too much onthemselves. These two concepts, deflecting responsibility and putting too muchon oneself, are not mutually exclusive. A good “personal responsibility”statement goes something like this: “Bad things have happened in my life, someof which I had something to do with and some of which I did not. Either way, Ineed to learn how to respond effectively to whatever situation I am in.”Responsibility means you have the ability to respond in a positive, helpful way.Taking responsibility in relationships means continually asking yourself whatyou can do to make the relationship better. When my patients thoughtfullyevaluate and change their own behavior, their relationships often dramaticallyimprove. In my experience, the idea that we have no control or influence overthe behavior of others is just not true. I often ask patients what they do tomake their relationships better, and they usually can come up with a number ofpositive behaviors. Then I ask them what they do to make the relationshipsworse. Initially, they hesitate, not wanting to admit to their own negativeactions, but after a bit of time they start to own up to the myriad behaviorsthey might need to work on. Here is an example.Eight-year-old Carlos was sitting in my office because he had behavioralproblems, especially at home. He started by telling me how much he hated hisyounger sister. “She irritates me all the time,” he said. “I have no choice butto yell at her and hit her.”When he said he had no choice, my eyebrows raised.Seeing my reaction, he justified his behavior further. “I have no choice; sheirritates me all the time.”“What do you do to irritate her?” I asked softly.“Nothing,” he said. He paused and repeated, “Absolutely nothing.”I sat quietly.“Well —” He paused, and then showed a wry smile. “Well, I take some of herthings sometimes.”“Anything else?”Carlos looked like he was thinking hard and then said, “I yell at her, tell hershe cannot play with me, and ignore her when she talks to me.”“Okay,” I said. “You do irritate her. I sort of suspected it. But what do you dothat makes her happy?”He then listed several things he did that helped them get along better,including playing with her, helping her with her kindergarten homework, sayingthank you, and smiling at her. He had a lot more power than he believed. HelpingCarlos tap into his power to make his relationship with his sister better, aswell as know his ability to make things worse, helped change his victimmentality and ultimately his behavior.What can you do today to make your relationships better? You win more inrelationships when you ask yourself this question and stay away from blamingothers.E IS FOR EMPATHY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------If, as a result of reading this book, you get only one thing —an increasedtendency to think always in terms of the other person’s point of view, and seethings from that person’s angle as well as your own —if you get only that onething from this book, it may easily prove to be one of the stepping-stones ofyour career.DALE CARNEGIE, HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Once when my family and I were on vacation in Hawaii, I was reading a book toour daughter Chloe, then four years old, when her mother walked into the roomand accidentally bumped into the corner of the television armoire. Watching thishappen, Chloe immediately said, “Ouch,” as if she felt the pain herself. Touchedby her caring, Tana gave Chloe a hug and told her she was okay. That simpleinteraction stayed with me for the whole trip. It was the essence of empathy,the human ability to feel what others feel. Chloe’s mirror neurons were at work.In the late 1990s, Italian neuroscientists Giacomo Rizzolatti, Leonardo Fogassi,and Vittorio Gallese were recording activity of the lower frontal lobes of themacaque monkey when they experienced a moment of research serendipity. As thescientists mapped the electrical activity of the monkey’s actions, Dr. Fogassiselected a banana from a nearby fruit bowl. As he reached for the banana, themonkey’s brain reacted as if he, too, were reaching for the fruit, even thoughhe had not moved. He was playing out in his head what the researcher was doing.The researchers labeled the responsible cells “mirror neurons” and laterdiscovered them in humans.[166] These neurons “allow us to grasp the minds ofothers,” the researchers noted,[167] which is why we open our own mouths when wefeed a baby or yawn when others start to yawn first. We “play” their minds inour brains.THE MIRROR NEURON SYSTEMTwo drawings of a monkey, its brain, and a banana. In the left, the monkey doesan action, holding the banana, and an arrow points to activity in a certain spotin the brain. In the right drawing, the monkey sees the same action, a humanholding the banana, and an arrow points to brain activity in the same spot.[images/Illustration-6.1.jpg]Researchers have found that children with autism, who often display social skilldeficits, have problems in their mirror neuron systems. This system is importantto empathy. When it is healthy, we can experience the feelings of others. Whenthe system works too hard, we can become too sensitive, which would make usterrible doctors or nurses, as we could be crying all the time in response toothers’ pain. When it does not work hard enough, we could hurt others and itwouldn’t bother us. As is true with so many parts of the brain, a healthy systemhelps us most.Empathy helps us navigate the social environment and answer questions such asthese: Is this person going to feed me? Love me? Attack me? Faint? Run away?Cry? The more accurately we can predict the actions and needs of others, thebetter off we are. The ability to “tune in” and empathize with others is aprerequisite for understanding, attachment, bonding, and love —all of which areimportant for our survival.In several studies about why executives fail, “insensitivity to others” ora lack of empathy was cited more than any other flaw as a reason for derailment.Phrases like the following were used about those who did not succeed: * He never negotiated; there was no room for any views contrary to his. * She could follow a bull through a china shop and still break the china. * He made others feel stupid. * She was always talking down to her employees. * Whenever something went right, he took all the credit. Whenever things fell through, heads would roll. * It was her way or no way. If you disagreed with her, you were out.Lack of empathy can cause failure in almost any endeavor. A lack ofinterpersonal skill not only causes others to avoid you; it can make them angryand feel active ill will toward you. Coworkers may look the other way if you aremaking serious mistakes; spouses may start finding fault in any area they can toretaliate for their hurt; and acquaintances may begin making excuses to decreasethe time they spend with you. Lacking empathy also has a serious isolatingeffect that not only causes loneliness but also decreases honest feedback fromothers and cuts you off from coworkers’ or friends’ creativity and knowledge.One example from my practice was of a supervisor who returned to his officeafter being chewed out by the owner of a company. Upset, he snapped at hisassistant for not having a report ready. She had just returned from taking herchild to the emergency room because he had cut his head open falling against thecorner of a table at day care. She started to cry and ran into the bathroom. Thesupervisor and assistant didn’t speak to each other for a week, and she finallyquit a job she needed. If instead of thinking only of their own trying days,each had taken a minute to think about what was going on with the other(empathy), this fight could have been avoided and her job saved.How is your empathy? Can you feel what others feel? Do you sabotage yourrelationships by being insensitive? Do you take the behavior of others toopersonally? Or instead, when someone dumps on you, do you wonder what might begoing on that caused him or her to act that way? Of course, you can carry thatlast question to an extreme and attribute any negative criticism directed at youto someone else’s problem. Balance is the key. When negative behavior comes yourway, ask yourself two questions: 1) Did I do anything to cause it? 2) What isgoing on with the other person? Those two questions will help you to be moresensitive to other people and improve your relationships, which will help youfeel better overall —now and in the long run.Developing empathy involves a number of important skills, including mirroring,treating others in a way you would like to be treated, and being able to getoutside of yourself. The following three exercises are designed to help youincrease your empathic skills.EXERCISE #1: MIRRORINGYour ability to understand and communicate with others will be enhanced bylearning what therapists call the “mirroring technique.” You can use thistechnique in any interpersonal situation to increase rapport. When you mirrorsomeone, you assume or imitate his or her body language —posture, eye contact,and facial expression —and you use the same words and phrases in conversationthat the other person uses. If, for example, someone is leaning forward in hischair, looking at you intensely, you do the same without making a big point ofit. If you note that she uses the same phrase several times, such as “I believewe have a winner here,” pick it up and make it part of your vocabulary for thatconversation. This is not mimicry, which implies ridicule; rather, thistechnique allows the other person to identify with you, albeit unconsciously.HOLDING HANDS CAN BE A PAIN RELIEVERIn an example of the mirroring technique at work, researchers at the Universityof Colorado Boulder and the University of Haifa recently found that holding thehand of a loved one who is in pain can help take away the discomfort. Theirexperiments have shown that when your spouse is in pain and you hold his or herhand, your breathing rates, heart rates, and even brain-wave patterns sync uptoo. Plus, the more empathy you feel for your partner in pain, the more in tuneyour brain waves become and the greater the pain-relieving effect.[168]1 minute. [images/x01-min.jpg]Try it: The next time your partner is in pain, hold her or his hand while youfocus in a heartfelt way on feeling empathetic about the pain.On a side note: Be careful whom you allow to hold your hand. If that person’sbrain waves are the result of anger or anxiety, you may pick up those patternsand feelings too. People are contagious.EXERCISE #2: THE GOLDEN RULEAnother exercise that will help you look beyond yourself and into the feelingsof others is found in the New Testament book of Luke: “Do to others as you wouldhave them do to you” (6:31). In at least one interaction per day, consciouslychoose to treat someone else as you would like to be treated in that situation.If your spouse has a headache when you feel romantic, for example, instead offeeling rejected, make an effort to understand. You might say something like “Itmust be awful to have a headache before going to bed. Can I get anything foryou?” This empathetic line will get you more passion than the accusation “Youalways have a headache!”EXERCISE #3: GET OUTSIDE OF YOURSELFThe next couple of times you get into a disagreement, try taking the otherperson’s side of the argument. At least verbally, begin to agree with theirpoint of view. Argue for it, understand it, see where they’re coming from.Although this can be a difficult exercise, it will pay off royally if you use itto learn to understand others better. In order to do this effectively, you mustfirst listen to the opposing viewpoint without interrupting. When you do thisexercise, difficult people often become less difficult. By agreeing with them,you’ll take the wind out of their sails and deflate their anger.L IS FOR LISTENING AND GOOD COMMUNICATIONPoor communication is at the core of many relationship problems. Jumping toconclusions, trying to read minds, and needing to be right are only a few traitsthat doom communication. When people do not connect with each other in ameaningful way, their own minds take over the relationship and many imaginaryproblems arise. This can occur at home, with friends, and at work.Donna was frequently angry at her husband. During the day, she would spend timeimagining their evening together, in which they would spend time talking andbeing attentive to each other’s needs. When her husband came home tired andpreoccupied by a hard day at work, she felt disappointed and reacted angrilytoward him. Her husband felt bewildered. He was unaware of his wife’s thoughtsduring the day and didn’t know he was disappointing her. After a few couple’stherapy sessions, Donna learned how to express her needs up front and found avery receptive husband.Too often in relationships we have expectations and hopes that we neverexplicitly communicate to our partners or colleagues. We assume they should knowwhat we need and become disappointed when they don’t accurately read our minds.Clear communication is essential if relationships are to be mutually satisfying.10 WAYS COMMUNICATION IS SABOTAGED IN RELATIONSHIPS 1. Poor attitude. You expect the conversation to go nowhere, and subsequently you don’t even try to direct it in a positive way. Negative assumptions about others feed into this poor attitude. Because you don’t trust them from the beginning, you remain stiff and guarded when you are together. 2. Unclear expectations and needs. Do you expect people to guess what you want or need? It is great when others can anticipate our needs, but most people are too busy to be able to do it effectively. That does not make them good or bad; it simply means it’s important to speak up about what you need. 3. No reinforcing body language. Body language is critical because it sends both conscious and unconscious messages. When you fail to make eye contact or acknowledge others with facial expressions or body gestures, they begin to feel lost, alone, and unenthusiastic about continuing the conversation. Eye contact and physical acknowledgment are essential to good communication. 4. Competing with distractions. Distractions frequently doom communication. It’s not a good idea, for example, for my daughter to talk to me about something important during the fourth quarter of a Lakers basketball playoff game. Decrease distractions to have clear communication. 5. Never asking for feedback on what you’re saying. You might assume that you are sending clear messages to the other person when, in fact, what he or she understands is completely different from what you meant. Feedback is essential to clear communication. 6. “Kitchen sinking.” When people feel backed into a corner, they may bring up unrelated issues from the past in order to protect themselves or intensify the disagreement. Stay on track until an issue is fully discussed. 7. Mind reading. You arbitrarily predict what another person is thinking and then react to that imagined information. Mind reading is often just a projection of what you think. Even after couples have been married for 30 years, it’s impossible for them to always be right about what is going on in the other person’s head. Asking for clarification is essential to good communication. 8. Having to be right. When a person has to be right in a conversation, there is no communication, only a debate. Needing to be right destroys effective communication. 9. Sparring. Using put-downs or sarcasm or discounting someone else’s ideas erodes meaningful dialogue and sets up distance in relationships. 10. Lack of monitoring and follow-up. Often it takes repeated efforts to get what you need, but it’s very important not to give up on communication. When you stop asking for what you need, you often silently resent the other person, which subverts the whole relationship. Persistence will help you get what you want.As a consultant to organizations and businesses, I have found that theunderlying problem in employer-employee disputes is often a lack of clearcommunication. In many cases, when the communication improves, other problemsare also quickly resolved.One brief example: Billie Jo was an administrative assistant who was frequentlyangry at her boss. He would give her general guidelines for projects and thenbecome irritated with her when something wasn’t done to his satisfaction.Because of his gruff manner, she was too afraid to ask him specific questionsabout the work. She began to really hate her job. She developed frequentheadaches and neck tension and was constantly looking for another position. Afriend pushed Billie Jo to tell her boss about her frustrations, saying, “Ifyou’re going to quit anyway, you have little to lose.” To Billie Jo’s surprise,her boss was receptive to her direct approach and encouraged her to ask morequestions about the projects he assigned.Here are six keys to effective communication in relationships: 1. Have a good attitude and assume the other person wants the relationship to work as much as you do. Doing so can set the mood for a positive outcome. I call this having “positive basic assumptions” about the relationship. 2. State what you need clearly and in a positive way. In most situations being direct is the best approach, but the way you ask is important. You can demand and get hostility, you can ask in a meek manner and not be taken seriously, or you can be firm yet kind and get what you need. How you approach someone has a lot to do with your success rate. 3. Decrease distractions and make sure you have the other person’s attention before you begin a conversation. Find a time when the person is not busy or in a hurry to go somewhere. 4. Ask for feedback to ensure the other person correctly understands you. Clear communication is a two-way street, and it’s important to know if you got your message across. A simple “Tell me what you understood I said” is often all that is needed. 5. Be a good listener. Before you respond to others, repeat back what you think they’ve said to ensure that you’ve correctly heard them. Statements such as “I hear you saying . . .” or “You mean to say . . .” are the gold standard of good communication. Doing this allows you to check out what you heard before you respond. 6. Monitor and follow up on your communication. It’s very important not to give up.LEARN AND PRACTICE ACTIVE LISTENING“I hear you saying . . . ,” or active listening, is a technique therapists aretaught to increase healthy communication. This technique involves repeating backwhat you understand the other person to be saying, which gives you theopportunity to check whether the message you received is the one the speakerintended to convey. Communication often breaks down because of distortionsbetween intention and understanding, especially in emotionally chargedencounters.1 to 2 minutes. [images/x01-02-min.jpg]Simply saying, “I hear you saying . . . is that what you meant?” can help youavoid misunderstandings. This technique is particularly helpful when you suspecta breakdown in communication.Other phrases you could use with this technique include 1. “I heard you say . . . am I right?” 2. “Did you mean to say . . . ?” 3. “I’m not sure I understand what you said. Did you say . . . ?” 4. “Did I understand you correctly? Are you saying that . . . ?” 5. “Let me see if I understand what you’re saying to me. You said that . . . ?”Advantages to “active listening” include 1. You receive more accurate messages. 2. Misunderstandings are cleared up immediately. 3. You are forced to give your full attention to the other person. 4. Both parties are now responsible for accurate communication. 5. The speaker is likely to be more careful with what he says. 6. It increases your ability to really hear the other person and thus learn from her. 7. It stops you from thinking about what you’re going to say next so that you can understand what the other person is saying. 8. It increases communication. 9. It tends to cool down conflicts.When I teach active listening to parenting classes, I often use the followingexample: If my son came home when he was a teenager and said he wanted to haveblue hair, how would I respond without the active listening skill versus withthe active listening skill?STEP 1: REACT VS. REPEAT BACK WHAT YOU HEARWithout active listening: Just react. My father, for example, would have said,“No way as long as you live in my house are you going to have blue hair!” Thisonly ends the conversation or starts a fight.With active listening: Repeat back what you hear. I might say, “You want bluehair?” and then stay quiet long enough for my teen to explain.STEP 2: STICK TO YOUR GUNS VS. LISTEN FOR THE FEELINGS BEHIND THE WORDSMy son might say, “All the kids are wearing their hair that way” (as if he hadsomehow taken a scientific poll).Without active listening: My dad would likely say, “I don’t care what anyoneelse does; you’re not going to have blue hair. If they are going to jump off abridge, are you going to go with them?” Again, this sets up a fight with theteen or causes him to withdraw.With active listening: I would listen for the feeling behind the words and say,“Sounds like you want to be like the other kids.” This encourages understandingand further communication.STEP 3: DENY YOUR CHILD’S FEELINGS VS. REFLECT BACK WHAT YOU HEAR YOUR CHILDSAYING AND FEELINGMy son might say, “Sometimes I feel like I don’t fit in. Maybe changing myappearance will help.”Without active listening: “Don’t be silly. Of course you fit in. Your appearancehas nothing to do with it!”With active listening: “You think your appearance prevents you from fitting in?”As you can see, these are two completely different conversations. One isdemeaning and limits communication, while the other promotes communication andunderstanding. At the end of a half hour, if my son still wants to have bluehair, I will tell him, “No way as long as you live in my house.” But at leastnow I know why he wants it, and he is much more likely to accept the answer.Active listening in a relationship increases its level of understanding andcommunication. And when people feel understood by you, they feel closer to you.Begin practicing this technique on at least two people every day for a week. Seeif it doesn’t increase your communication abilities —and thus your ability tolearn from others.THE BENEFITS OF ACTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE COMMUNICATIONWhen your daughter reads you her speech, which she is scheduled to deliver atschool the next day, and asks for your opinion, how do you respond? How aboutwhen your spouse wants to tell you about his day at work? As we have seen, theway you communicate with others can help or hurt your relationships. Studieshave shown that a technique called active and constructive communication canquickly strengthen your relationships and improve your mood.[169]Marty Seligman and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania have writtenabout four typical styles of communication: * Active and Destructive: pointing out negative aspects of a situation * Passive and Destructive: ignoring the person completely * Passive and Constructive: supporting someone but in an understated way * Active and Constructive: giving both authentic and enthusiastic support[170]If you want to improve your relationships, research shows that activeconstructive communication works, while the other styles do not. Let’s say yourdaughter just got her first acting audition. Here are examples of how you couldrespond: * Active and Destructive: “That is such a hard profession. Why would you ever want to do that?” * Passive and Destructive: Little to no response. * Passive and Constructive: “That’s nice.” * Active and Constructive: “Wow! That’s amazing. Congratulations! Tell me all about it.”15 seconds. [images/x15-sec.jpg]Use active constructive communication when responding to someone.Communicating actively, positively, and constructively helps us build positiverelationships and enhance self-esteem.[171]FOUR TYPICAL COMMUNICATION STYLESChart showing the four styles in a grid that combines two pairs of traits. Theleft column is active, and the right is passive. The top row is constructive,and the bottom is destructive. The active constructive style shows an icon of asmiling face. Its traits are enthusiastic support, eye contact, and authenticreaction. Its reply is 'Great news! I knew you'd do it. How do you feel?' Thepassive constructive style shows an icon of a neutral face. Its traits are lowenergy, delayed response, and quiet. Its reply is 'Oh, cool. That's nice. Goodfor you.' The active destructive style shows an icon of an open-mouthed,frowning face. Its traits are that it quashes the event, it is dismissive, andit is demeaning. Its reply is 'I don't believe you! It sounds stressful.' Thepassive destructive style shows an icon of a closed-mouthed, frowning face. Itstraits are that it turns focus inward, it is avoiding, and it ignores thespeaker. Its reply is 'Huh. Well, I just got a new video game.'[images/Illustration-6.2.jpg]A IS FOR ASSERTIVENESS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Assertiveness involves standing up for one’s rights without infringing uponthose of others, whereas aggression involves the use of verbal and nonverbalnoxious stimuli to maintain rights.DRS. MARSHA RICHINS AND BRONISLAW VERHAGE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In healthy relationships it’s important to say what you mean. In that way,assertiveness and communication go hand in hand. Being assertive means youexpress your thoughts and feelings in a firm yet reasonable way, not allowingothers to run over you emotionally, and not saying yes when that’s not what youmean. Assertiveness never equates with being mean or aggressive.Here are five simple rules to help you assert yourself in a healthy manner: 1. Do not give in to the anger of others just because it makes you uncomfortable. Anxious people do this a lot. They are so anxious that they agree in order to avoid the tension. Unfortunately, doing this teaches others to bully you to get their way. We teach others how to treat us by what we allow in our lives. Being assertive in the face of another’s anger doesn’t mean you have to be angry back, but it does mean you don’t agree with someone simply because you’re uncomfortable. When you are feeling anxious about another person’s anger, it is a good time to do the deep breathing techniques I taught you earlier (see chapter 1, page 17 [chapter_1.xhtml#page_17]). Take three deep, slow breaths and really think about what your opinion is; then state it clearly without much emotion. 2. Say what you mean and stick up for what you believe is right. People will respect you more. People like others who are real and who say exactly what’s on their minds. 3. Maintain self-control. Being angry, mean, or aggressive is not being assertive. You can be assertive in a calm and clear way. 4. Be firm and kind, if possible. Above all, be firm in your stance. Again, we teach other people how to treat us, so when we give in to their temper tantrums, we actually teach them the way to control us. When we assert ourselves in a firm yet kind way, others have more respect for us and will treat us accordingly. Now, if you’ve allowed others to emotionally run over you for a long time, they’re going to be resistant to change. If you stick to your guns, you will help them learn a new way of relating to you, and the relationship will improve. Ultimately, you also will respect yourself more. 5. Be assertive only when it is necessary. If you assert yourself all the time for unimportant issues, you’ll be perceived as controlling, which invites oppositional behavior.T IS FOR TIMERelationships require actual, physical time. In this era of commuting, traffic,two-working-parent households, e-mail, the Internet, television, and videogames, we have seriously diminished the time we have with the people in ourlives. Spending actual, physical time with the people who are important to uswill make a huge difference in our relationships. When I teach the parentingcourse we give at Amen Clinics (one of the most effective things I’ve ever doneto help children), I say that relationships really require just two things —timeand a willingness to listen. Focused time, even if there’s not a lot of it, iscritically important to relationships.5 minutes. [images/x05-min.jpg]Special time. I teach an exercise in my parenting course called “special time,”which involves spending 20 minutes a day doing something with your child that heor she wants to do. Twenty minutes is not much time, but this exercise makes ahuge difference in the quality of your relationships. I have one rule for thisexercise: no commands, no questions, and no directions. It’s not a time to tryto resolve issues; it is just a time to be together and do something your childwants to do, whether it’s playing a game or taking a walk. The difference itmade in parent-child relationships was much more dramatic than anything else Idid for them, including prescribing medicine. Look for ways to spend time withthe people who are important to you. Think of this time as an investment in thehealth of the relationship.In a similar way, be present when you are spending time with others at work orat home. We encounter so many distractions that we are rarely present anywherewe are. In the powerful book Influencer: The Power to Change Anything, theauthors tell a story about a large health care organization that went fromhaving terrible customer satisfaction to becoming one of the region’sfirst-class organizations. In studying the employees who ranked “great” versusthose who were “poor,” the researchers found only five simple differences. Theeffective employees 1. Smiled 2. Made eye contact 3. Identified themselves by name 4. Let people know what they were doing and why 5. Ended every interaction by asking, “Is there anything else you need?”[172]These things were easy to do, and they indicated that the service providers werepresent and focused on the interaction at hand. Being present in the moment withyour spouse, friend, or colleague can help make the other person feelappreciated and secure.I IS FOR INQUIRINGEarlier in the book we discussed eliminating the ANTs (automatic negativethoughts) that invade your mind. When you’re suffering in a relationship, it’simportant to inquire into the thoughts that are making you suffer. Ask yourselfwhat thoughts are repeatedly going through your mind, and then consider howaccurate they might be. If you are fighting with your husband, for example, andyou hear yourself thinking He never listens to me, write that down. Then askyourself if it is true: Does he really “never” listen to you? Often when we tellourselves little lies about other people, it puts unnecessary wedges between usand them. Relationships require accurate thinking in order to thrive. Wheneveryou feel sad, mad, or nervous in relationships, check out your thoughts. Ifthere are ANTs or lies, stomp them out.N IS FOR NOTICING WHAT YOU LIKENoticing what you like a lot more than what you don’t like is one of the secretsto having great relationships. Paying attention to what you like encourages moreof that behavior. I learned this concept for the first time when my son wasseven years old and we were living in Hawaii. I was in my child psychiatryfellowship-training program.One day I wanted to have special time with my son, so I took him to a placecalled Sea Life Park, which is like SeaWorld. We had a great day together. Wewent to the orca show and the dolphin show, and we saw sea lion antics onstage.Toward the end of the day my son sort of grabbed my shirt and said, “Daddy, takeme to see Fat Freddie.” I said, “Who’s Fat Freddie?” “It’s the penguin, Dad,” hesaid. Fat Freddie was an emperor penguin who performed in the large stadium atSea Life Park. I looked on the show schedule and saw there was one more FatFreddie show that day. When we got to our seats, the stadium was filled.Freddie was amazing. To start the show, he climbed a ladder to a high divingboard. He went to the end of the board, bounced up and down, and then jumpedinto the water. When he got out of the water, on command he bowled with hisnose, counted with his flippers, and jumped through a hoop of fire. I wasthinking to myself, How cool is this? My son was clapping, very happy that wewere at the show. Toward the end, the trainer asked Freddie to go get something.Freddie immediately brought it to the trainer. When I saw this, I thought, I askthis kid to get me something, and he wants to have a discussion for 20 minutes,and then he doesn’t do it. I used to find myself frequently frustrated and angryat my son, but I knew he was smarter than the penguin.After the show I went up to the trainer and asked her how she got Fat Freddie todo all the things he did. The trainer understood what I was asking her, becauseshe looked at my son and then she looked at me and said, “Unlike parents withtheir kids, I notice Freddie whenever he does anything like what I want him todo. I give him a hug and a fish.” The light went on in my head: Whenever my sondid what I wanted him to do, I paid no attention to him because I’m a busy guy.But when he didn’t do what I wanted him to do, I gave him a ton of attentionbecause I didn’t want to raise bad kids. I was inadvertently teaching him to bea little monster in order to get my attention. I started collecting penguins toremind myself to notice what I like about others more than what I do not like. Inow have more than 2,000 penguins.What do you think Fat Freddie would have done if he was having a bad day anddidn’t do what the trainer asked him to do? Imagine if, all of a sudden, thetrainer started screaming at him, “You stupid penguin. I can’t believe I evermet a penguin as stupid as you. We ought to ship you off to the Antarctic andget a replacement.” Depending on his temperament, if he understood her, FatFreddie would have either bitten her or gone off to a corner and cried.What do you do when the important people in your life do not do what you wantthem to do? Do you criticize them and make them feel miserable? Or do you justpause and decide to notice what you like more than what you don’t like? This isa critical point that’s important for changing behavior: Focus on the behaviorsyou like more than the behaviors you don’t.It turns out there is also a great deal of science behind this concept: * A marriage with five times more positive comments than negative ones is significantly less likely to result in divorce. * A business team with five times more positive comments than negative ones is significantly more likely to make money. * College students who receive three times more positive comments than negative ones are significantly more likely to have flourishing mental health.[173]The amount of positivity in a system divided by the amount of negativity iscalled the Gottman ratio after marital therapist John Gottman, who discoveredthat the number of positive comments to negative ones significantly predictsmarital satisfaction and the chances of staying together versus gettingdivorced. It is also called the Losada ratio after Marcial Losada, who appliedGottman’s ratio to the workplace. Keep in mind that balance is important. Whencomments are too positive, they lose their impact, especially if the ratio isabove nine.G IS FOR GRACE AND FORGIVENESS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Amazing grace! How sweet the soundThat saved a wretch like me!I once was lost, but now am found;Was blind, but now I see.JOHN NEWTON, “AMAZING GRACE”Forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those who sin against us.MATTHEW 6:12, NLT, FROM THE LORD’S PRAYER--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The first definition of grace in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is “unmeriteddivine assistance given to humans for their regeneration orsanctification.”[174] It is a gift from God that we do not deserve. Grace andforgiveness go hand in hand. One of the most famous prayers in history commandsus to forgive others if we ourselves want to be forgiven. Forgiveness ispowerful medicine. Holding on to grudges and hurts, even if they are small,increases stress hormones that negatively impact our moods, immunity, andoverall health. Giving grace and forgiveness can be hard, but when done properlyit can also be powerfully healing. Research has linked forgiveness to mentalhealth outcomes such as reduced anxiety, depression, and major psychiatricdisorders, and with having fewer physical health symptoms and lower mortalityrates.[175] I often tell my patients that the person who forgives also usuallyends the argument.Grace and forgiveness do not mean letting someone off the hook or condoning badbehavior. They are not the same as justice and do not require being reconciledwith the person who has given offense or done harm. More often than not, aformer victim of abuse should not reconcile with the abuser, especially if theabuser has not sought serious help. Grace and forgiveness are acts of strength,not weakness.Psychologist Everett Worthington of Virginia Commonwealth University has studiedforgiveness for years and developed a model called REACH forgiveness, whichstands for * Recall the hurt —This time recall it differently, without feeling victimized or holding a grudge. This moves you toward relating to the offense from the point of view of the offender. * Empathize —Replace negative emotions with positive, other-oriented emotions. This involves empathizing —putting yourself in the shoes of the person who hurt you and imagining what he or she might have been feeling. * Altruistic gift —Give the gift of your forgiveness to the person who hurt you. Think about a time in your past when you wronged someone and that person forgave you; remember how much freer you felt afterward. That freedom is your gift to your offender. * Commit to the forgiveness that you experience —When you have forgiven, write a note to yourself about it. You can also cement your feelings by engaging in a ritual, such as completing a forgiveness certificate or writing a word symbolizing the offense in ink on your hand and then washing it off. * Hold on to the forgiveness —If or when you encounter the offender, you may feel anger and fear, and you may worry that you haven’t really forgiven him or her. But that is just your body’s response as a warning to be careful. Reread your notes to remind yourself that you have laid aside the offense.[176]In 1996, Dr. Worthington’s research was put to the worst possible test: Hismother was murdered in a home invasion. Although police believed they had foundthe murderer, he was never prosecuted. Despite the awful tragedy, Dr.Worthington said, “I had applied the forgiveness model many times, but never tosuch a big event. As it turned out, I was able to forgive the young man quitequickly.” This is an amazing testimony to the power of forgiveness.Is there someone in your life who needs your grace, whom you could forgive? Itmay help you feel better. Just keep in mind that forgiveness is usually not aquick process. The REACH forgiveness model, for example, focuses on changingfrom the inside, which can take time. (To see a presentation on this topic fromDr. Worthington, search YouTube for “Helping People Reach Forgiveness —EverettWorthington.”)My wife, Tana, tells a story about her involvement in a brain health program wewere asked to develop for the Salvation Army’s largest chemical addictionrecovery program. She helped re-create the food portion of our plan for theparticipants. After her first visit to the campus, she was suddenly filled withhorrible, judgmental thoughts about the addicts in the program. It’s clear thatclean eating helps people with addictions make better decisions, so she wantedto participate. But how could she help people who brought up feelings of fearand loathing inside her? Most of the participants (beneficiaries) are courtordered to be in the program, and many go there after having served time in jailfor some pretty serious criminal offenses.Growing up, Tana directly experienced the consequences that drugs can have onpeople’s lives. Her uncle was murdered in a drug deal gone wrong. She hateddrugs and had no tolerance for anyone who used them. When she told me she didn’tthink she could follow through with helping at the Salvation Army, that God hadpicked the wrong person this time, I smiled and said, “God picked the perfectperson.” I was right. Working with that population gave Tana new empathy for theclients’ backgrounds, which were not that much different from her own. And sherealized that for every person she helped who was a parent, there would be oneless scared child in the world.The eight keys we’ve discussed in this chapter will improve almost anyrelationship. Being responsible and empathic, listening, being assertive,spending time, inquiring into negative thoughts, noticing what you like morethan what you don’t, and giving grace and forgiveness are tools you can usetoday to bring those in your life closer to you.THE BRAIN AND RELATIONSHIPSIn addition to developing great habits to help people connect, our brain imagingwork has taught us that the physical functioning of the brain is anoften-overlooked component of why relationships succeed or fail. Over the pastthree decades I have scanned hundreds of couples who have had serious maritalproblems. In my training as a marital therapist, and in the training of almostall marital therapists on the planet, there was not one lecture on how thephysical functioning of your brain impacts the relationship. Yet, since yourbrain is involved in everything you do and everything you are, if it doesn’tfunction right, you are likely to have significant problems relating to peopleyou care about. At Amen Clinics, we look at relationships and relationshipconflict in a whole new way, involving compatible and incompatible brainpatterns. I have come to realize that many relationships do not work because ofbrain misfires that have nothing to do with character, free will, or desire.Many relationships are sabotaged by factors beyond conscious or even unconsciouscontrol. Sometimes a little targeted brain intervention can make all thedifference between love and hate, staying together and divorce, effectiveproblem-solving and prolonged litigation. See my book Change Your Brain, ChangeYour Life for a detailed look at this topic.EIGHT STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE YOUR ABILITY TO CONNECT BY RELATING 1. Ask yourself if you are taking RESPONSIBILITY in your relationships: “How can I respond in a positive, helpful way?” 2. Practice EMPATHY: Treat others as you would like to be treated. 3. In conversations, LISTEN and practice good communication skills. 4. Be ASSERTIVE: Say what you mean and stick up for what you believe is right in a calm, clear, kind way. 5. Spend TIME: Remember that actual, physical time with others is critical to healthy relationships. 6. INQUIRE into the negative thoughts that make you suffer in a relationship, and decide if they’re true. 7. NOTICE what you like in the behavior of those around you more than you notice (and complain about) what you don’t like. 8. Give the altruistic gift of GRACE and forgiveness whenever you can.TINY HABITS THAT CAN HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FAST—AND LEAD TO BIG CHANGES3 to 20 minutes. [images/x03-20-min.jpg]Each of these habits takes just a few minutes. They are anchored to somethingyou do (or think or feel) so that they are more likely to become automatic. Onceyou do the behaviors you want, find a way to make yourself feel good aboutthem—draw a happy face, pump your fist, or do whatever feels natural. Emotionhelps the brain to remember. 1. After I’ve had a fight with a loved one, I will take responsibility for my part and apologize (responsibility). 2. When someone acts negatively toward me, I will ask myself, Did I do anything to cause it? What is going on with this person? (empathy). 3. When I am in a conversation with someone, before responding with my input, I will reflect back what I heard him or her saying (active listening). 4. When I am challenged or bullied, I will state the case for what I believe, calmly and clearly (assertiveness). 5. When I set aside time to be with my child, I will spend 20 minutes doing whatever he or she wants to do, with no agenda (time). 6. When I have a negative thought about my spouse, such as He never listens to me, I will write it down and ask myself, Is that true? If it is not, I will quash the thought (inquiry). 7. When a friend does something annoying, I will turn my attention to the things I like about her rather than dwelling on the annoyance (noticing). 8. When someone is mean or hurtful to me, I will try to create grace in my heart to forgive them (grace and forgiveness).[156] R. Waldinger, “What Makes a Good Life?

He was not sure why, buthe felt drawn to the Santa Monica Farmers’ Market, so he headed there on foot.As he arrived, George Russell Weller, 86, lost control of his 1992 Buick LeSabreand barreled through the three-block-long farmers’ market. Bodies went flyingand people screamed as Weller’s car headed straight for Steven. He knew he wouldbe hit. Steven later said, “I thought he was going to run over my legs. . . . Ithought I would lose my legs.” At the last possible moment, he managed to jumpout of the way. In the chaos, 10 people were killed, and more than 50 wereinjured. Steven, who had been a military tank commander in the first Gulf War,used the medical skills he had learned to help save others. Still, a woman diedin his arms.Traumatized, Steven went back to work that same day. But for months afterward hecouldn’t sleep and couldn’t stop his hands from shaking. By chance —or fate, ifyou believe in such things —Linda Alvarez, a Los Angeles CBS News anchor, tookher bicycle to Steven’s shop shortly after the disaster and discussed it withhim in a brief conversation. As they talked, Linda noticed that Steven wasshaking. “It started that day,” Steven said, showing her his trembling hands,“and it won’t stop.” The image of Steven’s hands stayed with Linda. A monthlater, while working on another story, Linda learned about work I was doing witha treatment technique called Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, orEMDR, planting the seed for a story about the treatment and Steven’s trauma.EMDR: A POWERFUL TOOL TO FEEL BETTER FASTEMDR is an effective psychological treatment developed by my friend FrancineShapiro, a psychologist. In 1987, during a walk around a lake, she noticed thata disturbing thought disappeared when her eyes spontaneously started to moveback and forth from the lower left to the upper right visual fields. She triedthe eye movements again with another anxiety-provoking thought and found thatthe anxious feeling went away. In the days that followed, Francine tried thetechnique with friends, acquaintances, and interested students and found that itwas helpful in relieving anxiety. She went on to work with patients anddeveloped a technique that is now used worldwide.This form of therapy is based on research suggesting that traumatic events canprevent the brain from processing information as it normally does, which resultsin these events getting “stuck” in the brain’s information processing center.Then, when someone who experienced a trauma recalls it, the memory triggers anintense re-experiencing of the original event, complete with all of itsupsetting sights, sounds, smells, thoughts, and feelings. New incidents can havethe same effect. During EMDR, to “unlock” the brain’s processing center, aclient brings up emotionally troubling memories while his or her eyes follow atrained therapist’s hand moving horizontally back and forth. Employing aspecific protocol, the clinician helps the client identify the images, negativebeliefs, emotions, and body sensations associated with a targeted memory orevent. Positive statements and beliefs replace negative ones, and the clientrates the believability of a new thought while thinking of the disturbing event.The goal of EMDR treatment is to help clients rapidly process information abouta negative experience and move toward an adaptive resolution. When EMDR iseffective, people who undergo it come to understand, both consciously in theirminds and unconsciously in the physical functioning of their brains, that theevent is in the past and no longer a threat. This means a reduction in distress,a shift from a negative belief to a more positive one, and the possibility ofmore optimal behavior in relationships and at work. It is often used with peoplewho suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a lasting emotionalresponse to severe trauma that changes the nervous system.HEALING MULTIPLE LAYERS OF TRAUMAWhen CBS producer Angeline Chew called to ask if I would be interested in doinga segment about EMDR and using Steven’s story as an example, I was happy tohelp. I had just finished a study with therapist Karen Lansing on policeofficers who were involved in shootings and developed PTSD afterward.[177] EMDRwas very effective in quickly alleviating the officers’ symptoms, as well asnormalizing their brain function on SPECT scans. My colleagues and I havepublished several brain SPECT imaging studies on posttraumatic stress disorderthat show significant increases in activity in the limbic or emotional areas ina pattern that looks like a diamond. The affected brain areas are the anteriorcingulate gyrus, which indicates a fixation on negative thoughts or behaviors;the basal ganglia and amygdala, involved with anxiety; and the thalamus, whichshows a heightened sensory awareness. In addition, we see increased activity inthe right lateral temporal lobe, an area of the brain involved in reading theintentions of other people.NORMAL “ACTIVE” BRAIN SPECT SCANActive SPECT scan showing greater activity in the cerebellum.[images/Illustration-2.1.jpg]Most active areas are in the cerebellum at the back of the brain.CLASSIC POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER SCANActive SPECT scan showing greater activity in scattered areas. Four areas arearranged in a diamond toward the front of the brain.[images/Illustration-7.2.jpg]“Diamond plus” pattern shows increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus(top of diamond), basal ganglia/amygdala (middle), and thalamus (bottom), aswell as in the right lateral temporal lobe (indicated by the arrow).After talking to Steven and discovering that he was willing to participate, wefelt he would be a good candidate for EMDR and that his story of healing couldbe an inspiration to others. As is often the case in people who develop PTSD,Steven had experienced other traumas besides the one at the Santa MonicaFarmers’ Market. He grew up in a severely abusive alcoholic home. One of hisearliest memories was of his father burning down the family home, and he alsoremembered that his father had once dangled him over the side of a 400-foot-highbridge. When he was 11, his favorite firefighter uncle died in a fire set by anarsonist, and Steven faced death as a tank commander during the Gulf War. He hadmany layers of trauma.As part of his evaluation, we scanned Steven three times: before treatment,during his first EMDR session, and after eight hours of treatments. Initially,Steven’s brain showed the classic PTSD pattern, with his limbic or emotionalbrain being extremely hyperactive. Using EMDR with him, we cleared out thetraumas one by one. His brain actually showed benefit during the first treatmentand was markedly improved after eight hours of treatment (see the scans below).Steven’s shaking subsided, and he felt calmer and less stressed. One of the mosthealing insights Steven shared with me was that during the process, he startedto forgive his father and wondered what his brain might have looked like. Stevenhad held deep and understandable resentment toward his father, but the brainscience gave him a new perspective on himself and his dad. When we helped Stevencalm and balance his brain, he was happier and able to sleep better.STEVEN’S BASELINE “ACTIVE” SPECT SCANActive SPECT scan showing greater activity in scattered areas.

In order to properly heal it, it is critical to get the right diagnosis.In 2015, we published two studies on more than 21,000 patients, includingveterans, that demonstrated we could distinguish between PTSD (emotional trauma)and traumatic brain injuries (physical trauma) with high levels of accuracybased on SPECT scans.[178] In January 2016, Discover magazine awarded thisresearch 19th place among the top 100 stories in 2015 in all of science —betweenTesla’s entry into the energy market (number 18) and the discovery of a newvegan dinosaur species (number 20). It was critically important because thesymptoms of PTSD and traumatic brain injury (TBI) often overlap (anxiety,depression, irritability, headaches, and insomnia), but the treatments are verydifferent. In fact, treating PTSD as if it is a TBI, or vice versa, can actuallymake people worse, which is why I believe neuroimaging studies are so importantwhen people struggle and find that the simple treatments to feel better fast areineffective.Grief is often mislabeled as depression, ADHD, PTSD, panic disorder, and otherpsychiatric conditions. If you experience symptoms of these conditions after aloss, consider doing grief work before taking medication. If grief ismisdiagnosed, psychotropic medications can get in the way of or even prolongrecovery.SEVEN STRATEGIES TO ELIMINATE THE HURTS THAT HAUNT YOUBrain imaging research has shown that PTSD is associated with hyperactivity inthe amygdala and other emotional parts of the brain, but it also leads todecreased activity in parts of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This means thatpeople who suffer from trauma have heightened fear responses (high amygdalaactivity) and lower self-control (lower PFC activity). The combination ofheightened fear and lowered self-control is a prescription for trouble. Commonforms of self-medication, such as alcohol, opiates, marijuana, or a diet ladenwith sugar and foods that turn to sugar, can help to calm the amygdala andanxiety in the short run, but they also reduce the activity of the PFC evenmore, giving someone less control over these behaviors. That leads to furthertrouble, including addictions and obesity.Research has also found that the brains of those experiencing grief tend to showgreater activity in the limbic system and parts of the PFC. The pain of grief isoften so brutal that people will do anything to escape it. In so doing —just asfor PTSD —they often choose strategies that hurt rather than help them. Alcohol,marijuana, or unhealthy food may lessen the pain for a short while, butunfortunately it returns even worse. Similarly, taking opiates orbenzodiazepines, such as Valium or Xanax, can calm the pain briefly but actuallywill make it worse in the long run.[179]Integrating my clinical experience with patients, extensive brain imaging work,and the science of healing from trauma and grief (see “Recovering from Grief:Additional Suggestions” on page 166 [chapter_7.xhtml#page_166]), I’ve come upwith seven strategies that will help you feel better fast. Whether you have PTSDbecause of past trauma, are mourning the loss of a family member or friend, orare dealing with significant stress in your life, the relief will be lasting.STRATEGY #1: CONSIDER EMDR (EYE MOVEMENT DESENSITIZATION AND REPROCESSING).As discussed earlier, EMDR is especially helpful in dealing with intrusivememories and anxiety that interfere with joy. It also helps control the triggersthat make you feel upset. Initially used for people with PTSD,[180] EMDR hasalso been shown to be effective for grief,[181] anxiety,[182] panicdisorders,[183] depression,[184] chronic pain,[185] phantom limb pain,[186]addictions,[187] and performance enhancement.[188] It was found to be helpfulwhen used in groups of teenagers after the earthquake in Italy in 2016.[189]EMDR is one of the most rapid and effective treatments I have ever personallywitnessed. I have my patients keep a journal of the times that are hard forthem, then work with an EMDR therapist to help eliminate their anxiousreactions. It is important that this technique be done by an EMDR certifiedtherapist. You can find one at the EMDR International Association website(www.EMDRIA.org [http://www.EMDRIA.org]).EMDR: A PERSONAL REFLECTIONI have a personal history with EMDR, which I’ve talked about in my book Healingthe Hardware of the Soul and other places. In late 1996, I was invited to givethe State-of-the-Art Lecture in Medicine to the Society of DevelopmentalPediatrics on brain SPECT imaging. The lecture generated a heated discussion. Apediatrician from the Bay Area stood up and criticized my work, saying thatpeople quoted me and my brain imaging research as a justification to prescribemedication to children with ADHD. “We give glasses to children who can’t see,” Ireplied. “If you can see physical brain problems on SPECT in people who haveADHD, doesn’t it make sense to treat them?” Shortly after the meeting, someone(I suspected this pediatrician) anonymously reported me to the Californiamedical board.In California, if you do anything in medical practice outside the “standard ofcare,” you can have your license revoked. The law is designed to protect thepublic, but it can also stifle innovation. What I was doing with brain SPECTimaging was certainly different from my colleagues’ work. For a year, I answeredquestions, gave the medical board copies of research articles, hired anattorney, and appeared at interviews. Many times I felt like running away, and Iwas more anxious than I had ever been in my life. I had trouble sleeping,developed nightmares for the first time, and constantly had an upset stomach.When I talked about the stress with my friend and colleague Dr. Jennifer Lendl,an EMDR trainer, she suggested the treatment for me. “We’re studying EMDR inothers; it looks as though you need it too,” she said. My SPECT study beforeEMDR showed the “diamond plus” pattern, which was different from my baselinescan a couple of years earlier.I found the EMDR process fascinating. As Dr. Lendl moved her fingershorizontally left and right, I felt as if I were on a train watching all of theevents related to the investigation. I thought about the fear of failure, losingmy medical license, being unable to further develop the brain science I loved,and being embarrassed in front of my family and friends. As Dr. Lendl continuedto move her fingers, I felt the anxiety diminishing, and I spontaneously beganto replace the negative images with healthier ones. “I have a wonderful attorneyto help me; what I am doing helps many people; even if I lose, I will havehelped many people; my family and friends will always love me whether I’m adoctor or work in a grocery store; it will be okay; God will always be there forme.” Four EMDR sessions eliminated the anxiety. I slept better and my stomachstopped being upset. My follow-up scan showed overall calming of my emotionalbrain. After a year, the medical board found no violation and dismissed thecomplaint, allowing me to continue the work I loved.[190]STRATEGY #2: TRY TRAUMA-FOCUSED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (TF-CBT).TF-CBT was developed in the 1990s by psychiatrist Judith Cohen and psychologistsEsther Deblinger and Anthony Mannarino. As they note, trauma can lead to guilt,anger, feelings of powerlessness, self-abuse, acting-out behavior, and mentalhealth issues, such as depression and anxiety. It is common for PTSD to manifestitself with bothersome recurring thoughts about the traumatic experience.Similar to the ANT-elimination strategy discussed in chapter 5 (pages 107–108[chapter_5.xhtml#page_107]), the idea of TF-CBT is that learning to correctthese thoughts is critical to getting and staying well. TF-CBT has been shown tobe particularly effective with children and teens[191] and in group therapysettings,[192] and the results last over time.[193] You can find a TF-CBTtherapist at www.tfcbt.org [http://www.tfcbt.org].STRATEGY #3: WRITE THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR LIFE.Narrative exposure therapy (NET) is a brief psychotherapy for trauma developedby Drs. Maggie Schauer, Frank Neuner, and Thomas Elbert that has been shown instudies to be effective.[194] It has been used most often with individuals,groups, and communities that have experienced multiple traumas as a result ofpolitical or cultural forces (such as refugee groups or people affected by anatural disaster). NET has been shown to reduce PTSD symptoms after 4 to 10sessions with a therapist.The stories people tell themselves about trauma and their lives in generalinfluence their health and well-being. Seeing yourself solely around traumaticexperiences leads to lasting feelings of trauma and stress. NET therapy involveswriting a chronological story of your life, including detailed accounts of thetraumas you have experienced, and reliving the emotions without losingconnection with the present moment. You include positive events in your story,which helps add balance and context to what you believe about your life. One ofmy patients, for example, grew up with an abusive alcoholic mother, but mypatient also remembered the times her mother would put towels in the dryer towarm them before getting her and her siblings out of the bathtub. When treatmentends, the therapist will create a documented autobiography for the patient.NET is different from other treatments in that it focuses on creating an accountof what happened in a balanced way that helps to recapture a person’sself-respect. For more information, see the Narrative Exposure Therapy channelon the Vivo International website (www.vivo.org [http://www.vivo.org]). NET issimilar to written exposure therapy (WET), which has also been found to beeffective for PTSD.[195]STRATEGY #4: DON’T BLOCK YOUR PAINFUL FEELINGS.Let painful feelings wash over you, cry or scream (not at others!), and thenchallenge the thoughts that underlie the feelings to see if they are true.Avoiding painful thoughts, feelings, and memories creates more harm than good inthe long run. Many research studies have shown that avoidance increases thelikelihood of a host of psychological issues, such as PTSD,[196]depression,[197] anxiety disorders,[198] binge eating,[199] chronic pain,[200]low academic performance,[201] and more. Whenever you are suffering with traumaor grief, write out your feelings or find a friend or therapist you can talkthem out to. This can help bring perspective, which often gets lost duringemotional crises. Blocking your feelings leads to engaging in negative behaviorsto deal with the excess negative emotional energy.One of my favorite poems about not blocking thoughts or emotions is by Rumi, a13th-century Persian poet. In “The Guest House,” he describes being human asakin to a guest house that receives new “arrivals” —new emotions —every day.While some of these visitors are positive and some are negative, we can welcomethem all, knowing that experiencing them may help us grow. Rumi wrote,Still, treat each guest honorably.He may be clearing you outfor some new delight.[202]STRATEGY #5: BREAK THE BONDS OF THE PAST.One of the most powerful “feel better fast” techniques I’ve used with patientsis what I call “breaking the bonds of the past.” It stems from the belief thatnegative feelings and behaviors are often based on past memories that are eithertoxic or misinterpreted, and evaluating the truth of these memories can help usfeel better. This technique requires only five simple steps. Whenever you have apainful or disruptive memory or feeling, write out the answers to the followingquestions: 1. When was the last time you struggled with the painful or disruptive memory or feeling, experienced it, or felt suffering because of it? Write down the details. 2. What were you feeling at the time? Describe the predominant feeling. 3. When was the first time you had that feeling? Imagine yourself on a train going backward through time. Go back to when you first experienced the feeling and write down the incident in detail. 4. Can you go back even further to a time when you had that original feeling? Write down the details of the original incident. 5. If you have a clear idea of the origins of the feelings, can you disconnect them from the past by reprocessing them through an adult or parent mind-set, or reframing them in light of new information? Consciously disconnect the emotional bridge to the past with the idea that what happened in the past belongs in the past, and what happens now is what matters.Here are three examples of how this can work.NATE: ADDRESSING PANIC ATTACKSNate, 15, came to see me for panic attacks. He had several episodes a day whenhe felt as if he were choking or drowning. His breathing became shallow, fast,and labored. His heart raced, he broke out in a sweat, and he felt as though hewere dying. Nate hated these episodes. The fear of having them was sooverwhelming that he stopped going to school. I went through the following stepswith him during our second visit. 1. Tell me about the last time you had a panic attack. Nate said it was the day before. He was eating dinner when all of a sudden he felt as if he were starting to choke, and he had all the familiar awful symptoms —a sense of suffocation, racing heart, sweating, and feeling as if he were going to die. 2. Tell me what you were feeling at the time. Describe the predominant feeling. Nate said he felt as though he were going to die. 3. Imagine yourself on a train going backward through time. Go back to a time when you first had that feeling. I asked Nate to go back in time to remember the first time he felt he was going to die. He sat there for a minute and then started to choke. I thought he was having a panic attack in front of me. I asked him to breathe slowly and tell me what was going on. He slowed his breathing, wiped his brow, and told me about a time when he was six years old. He was sitting at a lunch table at school and accidentally swallowed a plastic wrapper from a candy bar. He started to choke on the wrapper. Initially no one saw him. He couldn’t breathe, and no one noticed. He thought he was going to die. After what seemed an eternity, a teacher saw him and did the Heimlich maneuver on him, dislodging the wrapper. Nate said he had forgotten about the event until now. 4. After he settled down and composed himself, I asked him to go back even further in his mind to see if there was an earlier time when he had the feeling he was going to die. He closed his eyes and said he remembered a time when he was very young. He was coming out of somewhere dark into a place filled with bright lights, lights that felt hot. People were moving around. He felt fear. He couldn’t breathe, and something awful covered his face. He felt as though he were going to die. To my amazement, Nate had just described a birth experience. When he opened his eyes, I asked him if he knew anything about his birth. He said no, no one had ever talked to him about it. I asked his mother to come into the room, and then I asked her about his birth experience. She told me that he was a meconium baby (this means the infant’s feces get into the amniotic fluid, which is very dangerous for the newborn). He was born blue and had to be resuscitated by the doctor. His mother said she had never talked about it with Nate because she didn’t want to worry him. 5. Break the bonds of the past through an adult or parent mind-set, or reframe them in light of new information. With Nate’s mother in the room, I took him back to both of those times. First, with the birth experience, I had the teenage Nate go back and explain to the baby what had happened. The baby was in trouble for a short time, but the doctors helped clean him up so he could breathe normally. I then took him through the candy wrapper incident and had the teenage Nate tell six-year-old Nate that he is grateful to the teacher who helped him and that he is alive, well, and healthy (and he needed to stop eating candy wrappers).After that session, Nate’s panic attacks disappeared. I saw him a few moretimes, but essentially disconnecting his present symptoms from the pastsensitizing event took care of them.CHUCK: GETTING FREE FROM IMPOTENCEChuck, 35, came to see me for impotence. He felt he was going to lose the womanhe loved, who was getting frustrated over the issue. 1. Tell me about the last time you were impotent. Two nights ago. 2. Tell me what you were feeling at the time. Describe the predominant feeling. Chuck said, “I feel as if I am a failure.” 3. Imagine yourself on a train going backward through time. Go back to a time when you first had that feeling. I asked Chuck to go back in time to when he first felt as if he were a failure. After about two minutes he started to sob. As he gained a measure of control, he told me of a time when he was seven years old and having trouble with his homework, especially reading. His father repeatedly hit him, called him stupid, and told Chuck he would never amount to anything. He would be a failure. Chuck said he had completely blocked the memory until that moment. 4. I then asked Chuck to go back even further in his mind to see if there was an earlier time when he felt like a failure. After several minutes, he said no. 5. Break the bonds of the past through an adult or parent mind-set, or reframe them in light of new information. I took Chuck back to the traumatizing incident and had the adult Chuck talk to his seven-year-old self. His father didn’t understand dyslexia, which Chuck was diagnosed with in the fourth grade. Once he was diagnosed, his father became more understanding and supportive.After that session, Chuck’s issue with impotence was resolved, which improvedhis relationship.JENNY: OVERCOMING ANNOYANCE AND ALCOHOLISMJenny, 42, struggled with alcohol use and lost her marriage in the process.During her recovery, she joined the Christian program Celebrate Recovery. Shefound that when she went, she usually showed up at meetings 30 minutes late toavoid the worship music. I asked her why. 1. Tell me about the last time you were late to a meeting. A week ago. 2. Tell me what you were feeling at the time. Describe the predominant feeling. Jenny said, “Annoyed.” 3. Imagine yourself on a train going backward through time. Go back to a time when you first had that feeling. I asked Jenny to go back in time to when she first felt annoyed. After about 30 seconds, she said, “About age seven, when my mother wanted me to enter piano contests. I spent hours and hours practicing. Initially, I loved it, but the pressure was insane. All I did was go to school, practice music, and go to church. My dad was the minister, and my mom played the piano. And it went on and on for like 20 hours. There were times I would fall asleep in church and then get beaten with the belt when I got home.” “No wonder you get annoyed with the music at church,” I replied. Jenny laughed. 4. I then asked Jenny to go back even further in her mind to see if there was an earlier time when she felt annoyed. After several minutes, she said there was a time when she was three when her father hit her mother and broke her lip, splattering blood all over Jenny’s new clothes. It made her feel really annoyed. 5. Break the bonds of the past through an adult or parent mind-set, or reframe them in light of new information. Jenny’s adult self talked to her three- and seven-year-old selves. She told them her mom and dad were not healthy and had no business raising children under that level of stress. But she did not have to be like her parents and could start to enjoy the music at church. What happened in the past belongs in the past, and what happens now is what matters.Jenny’s recovery has gone much better, and Celebrate Recovery is an integralpart of her program.Note: If this process brings up painful memories that do not go away in a shortperiod of time, seek professional help from a licensed psychotherapist.STRATEGY #6: STRIVE FOR “POSTTRAUMATIC GROWTH.”One of the most exciting areas of trauma research is in posttraumatic growth(PTG). The term was coined in the mid-1990s by psychologists Richard Tedeschiand Lawrence Calhoun at the University of North Carolina atCharlotte.[203] According to Dr. Tedeschi, as many as 90 percent of traumasurvivors report at least one aspect of posttraumatic growth, such as a renewedappreciation for life. Whenever a group of people are traumatized, about 10percent will develop PTSD, while 80 percent will return to their normal baselinewithin a few months. Another 10 percent will actually be stronger than they werebefore the trauma happened —those who experience PTG.POSTTRAUMATIC GROWTH CURVEGraph showing a bell curve, with a large population in the middle sloping downto small populations to either side. The segment in the middle encompassing mostpeople is the resilience reaction. The reaction of the left population segmentis PTSD, depression, anxiety, and suicide. The reaction of the right populationsegment is posttraumatic growth. [images/Illustration-7.6.jpg]Research suggests that PTG is based on five factors that can improve symptoms ofdistress.[204] I’ve adapted them slightly to form the acronym SPARK: 1. A deepening of spiritual life, including a significant change in one’s belief system or a new or stronger sense of meaning and purpose. Martin Luther gave his life to God and a religious order after he survived a life-threatening thunderstorm. 2. Seeing new possibilities because of the trauma or grief. New opportunities have emerged from the situation, opening up possibilities that were not present before. One of my friends, for instance, lost her daughter to a drunk driver and now has traveled the country helping other families who have had similar experiences. 3. Increased appreciation of life in general; becoming better at appreciating each moment. After a near-death experience, one of my patients lost her fear of death but also started putting in fewer hours at work to spend more time with her family. 4. A change in relationships or relating to others in more meaningful ways than before the trauma occurred. There is an increased sense of connection, and people appreciate family and friends more. One of my friends who has experienced many challenges parenting a child with autism started Talk About Curing Autism, a support group with more than 50,000 members. She has a huge group of new friends who bring meaning and purpose to her life. 5. Kick-start greatness through increased personal strength. This is seen in expressions such as “If I lived through that, I can live through anything!”COMPONENTS OF POSTTRAUMATIC GROWTHDiagram of five circles connected in a circular arrangement around the termposttraumatic growth (PTG). The circles are labeled spiritual changes, newpossibilities, appreciation of life, relating to others, and kick-startgreatness. [images/Illustration-7.7.jpg]Eight sessions of EMDR helped to promote PTG in survivors of the large-scaleferry disaster that occurred in the Yellow Sea off South Korea in April2014.[205] To encourage PTG in yourself, look back over your own traumas and,using these five criteria, ask yourself how your life may have changed in apositive way as a result of those events.CHARLEY: THE HEALTHIEST PERSON I’VE EVER METCharley had anxiety and trouble breathing when he first came to see me. The16-year-old had a condition known as Goldenhar syndrome, a deformity thatusually affects just one side of the face. He was born without his left jawboneand had undergone 21 surgeries to fix the deformity, leaving his face scarredand looking like an old railroad yard. His panic started when the doctor put theanesthesia mask over his face for the 20th surgery. His mother brought Charleyto see me. He had always been a resilient boy, and she was worried because hehad at least two more surgeries to go. A few sessions of hypnosis easily clearedup his anxiety.As I got to know Charley, I came to believe that despite his anxiety, he was thehealthiest person I had ever met. He was president of his 10th-grade class, gotstraight As in school, and had a girlfriend he adored. He also had clear goalsand a great attitude. After his anxiety had lifted, I continued to see him at nocost. For the most part, doctors study illness, not resilience, but I had toknow why he was so healthy despite his circumstances. I came to believe thatthere were five reasons for Charley’s emotional strength, which paralleled theresearch of PTG. 1. Spiritual changes: Charley had a deep sense of purpose and believed he was on the planet to make it better. 2. Possibilities: Because of his experience, Charley had developed great empathy for others who suffered, and he was considering training to be a physician to help others like himself. 3. Appreciation of life: Charley loved life. Each year he found he was more competent in school and relationships and more excited about his future. 4. Relationships: He developed close relationships, especially with his mother, even though she never allowed his disability to be an excuse for anything. She suffered for her son, but early in his life she realized that babying him would only handicap him. Charley still did chores, was expected to do well at school, and participated with other kids even when they made fun of him. She helped him rehearse what to say when other kids were cruel, which they were. When he didn’t get upset by the teasing, the other kids became his friends and protected him against any further teasing. 5. Kick-start greatness through personal strength: Charley was an optimist. In listening to him speak, I found that he almost always saw the positive side of things. He did not see his condition as a handicap. When we talked about it, he said everyone has something. “This is my problem. At least I don’t have cancer.”THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAIN RESERVEAnother explanation for PTG is a concept I call brain reserve. Brain reserve isthe extra cushion of brain function you have that helps you deal with whateverstresses come your way. The more reserve you have, the more resilient you areand the less impact trauma and grief will have on your life. To explain brainreserve to my patients, I often go to the whiteboard in my office and draw theimage below.THE CONCEPT OF BRAIN RESERVEGraph of brain activity over age and habits. The line starts high and slopesdown to 0. A horizontal dashed line is set a little over halfway high across thegraph. The segment of the brain activity line that's above the dashed line islabeled 'brain reserve.' The intersection of the activity line with the dashesis labeled 'symptoms start.' The segment of the activity line below the dashedline is labeled 'trouble zone.' [images/Illustration-7.8.jpg]When you were conceived, your brain had a lot of potential for reserve, but ifyour mom smoked, ate unhealthy food, was chronically stressed, or hadinfections, your reserve was being depleted even before you were born. If,however, your mother was healthy, ate well, took her vitamins, and was notterribly stressed, she was helping to increase your reserve. Over the course ofthe rest of your life, you are either increasing or decreasing your brainreserve. If, for example, you fell down a flight of stairs at age three and hityour head, even if you had no symptoms, you decreased your reserve. If youstarted smoking marijuana as a teenager, you decreased your reserve further, andif you played tackle football or hit a lot of soccer balls with your head, youhave even less reserve —even though you might not yet be symptomatic.Think of it this way: Take two soldiers engaged in a war who are in the sametank and are both exposed to the same blast injury at the same angles. One ofthem walks away psychologically unharmed, while the other is permanentlydisabled by trauma. Why? It depends on the level of brain reserve that each ofthem had prior to the accident. One soldier had more reserve because he tookgood care of his brain, his parents fed him well, he had lots of educationalopportunities, and he didn’t play football. The other soldier started lower onthe line with less reserve. Both soldiers are effective at their jobs, but theystarted at different places. Even though the blast diminished the reserve ofboth, the one with a higher reserve remained functional.WHY SOME WALK AWAY FROM ACCIDENTS UNHARMED AND OTHERS DO NOTThe brain reserve graph with two examples, a soldier wearing white and a soldierwearing black. A white arc on the brain activity line shows a decline thatstarts and ends above the dashed line. A black arc on the activity line shows adecline that starts above the dashed line but ends below it.[images/Illustration-7.9.jpg]Most of the people we see at the Amen Clinics start below the dotted line andare symptomatic. Getting well is not just about becoming symptom-free; it’s alsoabout boosting your brain reserve and getting back above the line. That requiresthe three simple strategies discussed in chapter 2 (pages 30–44[chapter_2.xhtml#page_30]): developing brain envy (you have to really care aboutyour brain); avoiding anything that hurts your brain; and engaging in regularbrain-healthy habits. Every day you are either boosting or stealing from yourbrain’s reserve; you are either aging your brain or rejuvenating it. When youtruly understand this concept, you will have a lot more influence over how youdeal with trauma and grief.STRATEGY #7: CONSIDER USING THE HORMONE OXYTOCIN, WHICH HAS BEEN FOUND TO BEHELPFUL FOR BOTH GRIEF AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA.Oxytocin is produced in both women and men. Although it’s often associated withfemale reproduction, more recently it has become known as “the love hormone,” asit brings forth feelings of trust, security, connection, calmness, andcontentment. I first became aware of oxytocin’s unique ability to help withtrauma and grief after reading a book by Dr. Ken Stoller, who worked with us atAmen Clinics for several years. In Oxytocin: The Hormone of Healing and Hope,Ken wrote about his own firsthand experience with oxytocin and grief. His16-year-old son, Galen, had been killed in a train accident, and Ken wasoverwhelmed with what he termed pathological grief —a mixture of debilitatingfear, anxiety, and panic permeating his grief. He was consumed with obsessivethoughts about how Galen had died and what he might have experienced in his lastmoments.Ken had been prescribing oxytocin to treat fear and anxiety in children on theautism spectrum, but it was several weeks before he realized that it might helphim as well. His greatest fear and panic were during the predawn hours, when hewould have terrible nightmares. He wrote,One night, I set my alarm to wake up before this period and dosed myself withoxytocin, and the outcome felt nearly miraculous. The severity of obsessivenegative thoughts during this acute grieving period was altered within minutesafter the application of an oxytocin nasal spray. Whereas before I had tobreathe through this emotionally difficult hour as if I were in a Lamaze class,that survival strategy became unnecessary with the use of oxytocin. This time,I was actually able to play music until the sun came up.It took about ten minutes to experience the full effect, and with each passingminute a great sense of emotional equanimity took place. The panic and feardropped away from me as if I were shedding clothing. If I wanted to think aboutmy son’s train accident, I could. But the moment I didn’t want to think aboutit, the accident faded into the background of my mind. It wasn’t there hammeringaway at me as if it had a life of its own. By successfully diverting thesenegative feelings from wherever they would have taken me, I was able to processmy grief without the interference of negative obsessions. This was invaluable,to say the very least, and kept me from developing severe post-traumatic stressdisorder (PTSD) . . . because that was certainly where I was headed.[206]Oxytocin helped Ken get through the worst of his emotional pain, and he was ableto stop using it after a few weeks. He has since prescribed oxytocin for otherpatients facing grief and has seen it benefit each one.Other researchers have also recently shown the benefit of oxytocin fortrauma.[207] Dr. J. L. Frijling and colleagues from Holland found that givingintranasal oxytocin calmed the fear circuit in the brain (amygdala) anddecreased the symptoms of acute PTSD.[208] Oxytocin has also been shown toincrease compassion in people who suffer with emotional trauma.[209] Anyphysician can write a prescription for it, and most compounding pharmacies canmake the intranasal or sublingual (under the tongue) form. The typical adultdosage is 10–40 IUs two to three times a day. Dr. Stoller and others recommendit for short-term use only, as long-term use has the potential to changeoxytocin receptors in the brain.RECOVERING FROM GRIEF: ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONSThe emotion of grief affects nearly all of us at some point in life. Eightmillion people become new grievers every year due to the death of someone theylove. Nearly 50 percent of marriages end in divorce, leaving the broken couple,their children, and their families grieving.Grief is the normal response to a significant loss. And it is often accompaniedby regret and the pain of being unable to connect with someone (or something)who has been there for you for a period of time. Other common symptoms of griefinclude sadness, trouble concentrating, memory problems, insomnia, irritability,diarrhea, headaches, a loss of appetite, and feeling numb. Complicated grief,which is marked by intense and ongoing longing for the departed, is oftenassociated with conflicting feelings —happiness that a loved one is no longersuffering, but yearning because you miss him or her terribly.But grief is not just about losing a loved one to death, divorce, an empty nest,or another method. It can occur after losing one’s health, freedom, financialstability, a home, a job or career (with retirement), or even following a lossof trust or safety. When parents have a disabled child, they often experienceintense grief over the loss of what they had dreamed for their son or daughter.Losing pets is also extremely painful for many people. One of the only timesI’ve seen my very tough father cry was when he lost Vinnie, his dog and bestfriend of nine years.The symptoms of unresolved grief may include * Inability to accept the loss * Emotional numbness * Unwillingness to think or talk about someone who has died, or a loss you experienced * Happy memories that frequently turn painful * Talking only about the positive aspects of the relationship and ignoring the negative ones * Talking only about the negative aspects of the relationship and ignoring the positive ones * Feeling life is meaningless * Loss of identity or purpose * Inability to perform tasks of daily living * Delusions or hallucinationsBE INTENTIONAL WITH OVERCOMING GRIEFOvercoming grief takes time because humans are wired for connection. We becomeattached to others because that helps us to survive and thrive. When someone weare attached to goes away, either by death or by choice, our emotional brainsbecome overfired through looking for him or her, leaving us vulnerable todepression. Therefore, to overcome grief we must be intentional. Healing will beeasier if your brain is better, so make sure to keep a watchful eye on behaviorsthat either help healing or prevent it. Here are some simple additional steps: * Start as soon as possible. People may tell you to wait, but if you fell and broke your arm, when would you want to start healing? Immediately! There’s no advantage to putting off the healing process. * Keep a brain-healthy routine. It’s especially important to eat brain-healthy food, take supplements, exercise, and sleep. * Discover what was left unsaid or unfinished, and write it down. That way it will not endlessly spin in your mind. Talk to others about what you wish had been different so you can learn from it. * Be on the alert for an ANT invasion —especially the Guilt-Beating and Blaming species (see chapter 5, pages 102–106 [chapter_5.xhtml#page_102]).15 minutes. [images/x15-min.jpg] * Write out the story of what happened. Each day for four days, spend 15 minutes getting the story out, making sure to list both the positives (“He is no longer suffering”) and negatives (“I miss her so much it hurts”) of the situation. Writing has helped children and refugees deal with grief,[210] and it has been shown to decrease feelings of loneliness and help improve mood.[211] In one study, bereaved people who had lost someone to an accidental death or homicide wrote for 15 minutes a day for four days, either about the loss or about something trivial. Afterward, those who had written about the loss reported less anxiety and depression and greater grief recovery than those who had written about trivialities.[212] * Reach out for social support. Therapy and support groups can help you build skills to overcome grief. * Breathe with your belly. When you get anxious or short of breath, belly breathing can help you calm down or catch your breath (see chapter 1, pages 14–16 [chapter_1.xhtml#page_14]). * Consider supplements. As discussed in the last chapter, loss and rejection are felt in the same part of the brain as physical pain. Supplements such as s-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe), curcumins, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids help physical pain and may also help emotional pain. * Get any chest pain checked out. Chest pain is particularly common in grief.[213] Stress hormones can make our hearts beat in an abnormal rhythm,[214] which can cause chest pain. When I went through a period of grief, my chest hurt so badly I thought I had heart disease. I didn’t. But after my assistant Kim lost her fiancé to a heart attack, she started to have chest pain. When she had it evaluated, the doctors discovered her coronary arteries were more than 90 percent blocked. She did have heart disease, which responded very well to treatment. It turned out that the death of her fiancé may have saved her life. If you experience chest pain, get a physical. If your heart is fine, practicing deep breathing, hand warming, guided imagery, and hypnosis can calm your brain, as can taking 250–400 mg of magnesium glycinate two to three times a day. * Deal with triggers as they come up. Getting triggered is particularly common in grief, especially when the person or pet you lost can occupy every fun place in your brain. Whenever you get triggered by an anniversary, birthday, holiday, place, song, or smell, don’t try to block the feeling. Allow it to wash over you, cry if tears start to flow, and let yourself be grateful for the memory. Make sure to correct any negative thoughts that tag along with the painful feelings. * Be patient. No one does grief perfectly. I lost someone important to me about 12 years ago. I knew many of the right things to do, but I still suffered for several months and could not get the person out of my head. Ultimately, reading Byron Katie’s book Loving What Is, which elegantly teaches you not to believe every stupid thought you have, was incredibly helpful. Be patient and forgive yourself as you work through the hard times.WHAT WOULD THE OTHER PERSON WANT FOR YOU?Recently, my wife, Tana, and I took our 14-year-old daughter Chloe to see themovie The Shack. It’s a beautiful movie but hard to watch because it’s about alittle girl who is kidnapped and killed by a sex offender. A parent’s greatestfear is losing a child, and this was particularly upsetting for Tana. During anepisode of The Brain Warrior’s Way Podcast that we record together, Tana said,“Losing Chloe has always been my biggest fear. Why? Because I not only love her,I’m a sheepdog and protective by nature. It’s my responsibility to protect her.The Shack is about forgiveness, and as I watched, I kept wrestling with myself[about what I would do if this happened to Chloe]. No, I wouldn’t be able to doit. Then the movie would make an impactful point, and I would waver . . . I’dforgive this person. Then, all of a sudden, I’m back to No, I wouldn’t be ableto do it . . . I’m watching this with my daughter, and she saw me crying and shelooked at me; it was almost like she could read my mind. She said something sopowerful to me.”What Chloe had said to Tana was this: “I know you’re thinking that you wouldwant to go find that person and do something awful to him. You can’t do that;I’m telling you, you can never do that.”Tana was stunned and said, “You can’t say that . . . you can’t say that . . .take it back.”Chloe responded, “No, you can’t, because I would be so disappointed. I would beso upset.”Tana said, “Take it back right now.”Chloe said, “No, because if I did have any way of knowing, I would be sodisappointed, because it would ruin your life. The only thing that would evermake me happy is knowing you found some way to make sense of it and some way tobe happy again.”When my patients are experiencing grief, I often ask them what their loved onewould have wanted for them: “Would they want you to spend your life angry,miserable, and seeking revenge; or would they want you to find peace? Would theywant you to find love and joy?” Chloe’s message to her mother blew my mind.19 THINGS NOT TO SAY TO A GRIEVING PERSON * “How are you doing?” (This may come across as dismissive of what he or she is going through.) * “You’ll be okay after a while.” * “I understand how you feel.” * “You shouldn’t feel that way.” * “Stop crying.” * “At least he’s in a better place; his suffering is over.” * “At least she lived a long life; many people die young.” * “She brought this on herself.” * “Aren’t you over him yet? He has been dead for a while now.” * “There is a reason for everything.” * “God’s in charge.” * “She was such a good person that God wanted her to be with Him.” * “Just give it time. Time heals.” (Time alone does not heal; taking the right steps heals.) * “You’re young; you can still have other children.” * “You’ll do better next time in love.” * “It was just a dog or cat. You can get another one.” * “Stay busy. Don’t think about it.” * “You have to be strong for your spouse, children, mother, etc.” (This diminishes the person’s need to take time to heal.) * “Just move on.”Grief and trauma, at varying levels of intensity, are an inescapable part of thehuman experience. But we don’t have to passively endure the suffering that comeswith them. The strategies I’ve talked about in this chapter will help you get ahandle on your pain and begin to feel better.13 THINGS TO SAY TO (OR DO FOR) A GRIEVING PERSON * “I am so sorry for your loss.” * “I wish I had the right words. Please know I care and am here for you.” * “You and your loved ones are in my prayers.” * “I can’t imagine how you feel.” Then be quiet and let them tell you about their feelings. * “I can’t imagine how you feel. When I lost my father, I felt . . .” Then listen without judgment or criticism. Use the active listening technique discussed in chapter 6 (see pages 134–136 [chapter_6.xhtml#page_134]). * “I’m here for you.” Better yet, if there is something specific they need, ask if you can do it for them. Ask if you can make phone calls or send e-mails on their behalf. * “I’d like to attend the funeral.” Going to the service is often an important sign of support. * “Want to talk about what happened?” Many people avoid this question, but it helps grieving people to explain their feelings, if they desire, and having a compassionate ear can help them process it more accurately. * Just be present. * Share a memory. * Be empathetic. It is okay for you to show your feelings. * Continue connecting, even after a few months. Many people are inundated with cards, calls, or visits in the first few weeks, but they need support long after the funeral is over. * Listen for guilt. People who are grieving often feel guilty and wish they had done something differently. The Grief Recovery Handbook by John James and Russell Friedman, which has a wealth of information to help people with grief, includes a wonderful example of helping someone with guilt. This is a dialogue between a grieving parent and a grief specialist with the authors’ Grief Recovery Institute: Griever: My son committed suicide. I feel so guilty. Institute: Did you ever do anything with intent to harm your son? Griever: No. (This is an almost universal response.) Institute: The dictionary definition of guilt implies intent to harm. Since you had no intent to harm, can you put the “G” word back in the dictionary? You are probably devastated enough by the death of your son, you don’t need to add to it by hurting yourself with an incorrect word that distorts your feelings. Griever: Really? I never thought of it that way. Institute: Are there some things that you wish had ended different, better, or more? Griever: Oh, yes.[215]SEVEN STRATEGIES TO ELIMINATE THE HURTS THAT HAUNT YOU 1. Consider Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). 2. Try trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). 3. Write the story of what happened in the context of your life. 4. Don’t block your painful feelings. 5. Break the bonds of the past. 6. Strive for “posttraumatic growth.” 7. Consider using oxytocin, which has been found to be helpful for both grief and emotional trauma.TINY HABITS THAT CAN HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FAST—AND LEAD TO BIG CHANGES3 to 45 minutes. [images/x03-45-min.jpg]Each of these habits takes just a few minutes. They are anchored to somethingyou do (or think or feel) so that they are more likely to become automatic. Onceyou do the behaviors you want, find a way to make yourself feel good aboutthem—draw a happy face, pump your fist, or do whatever feels natural. Emotionhelps the brain to remember. 1. Whenever I feel upset, I will cross my arms and stroke down from my shoulders to my lower forearms. (This stimulates both sides of the brain and helps to have a calming effect on the mind.) 2. When I feel a wave of a traumatic memory or grief coming on, I will observe myself and write down any negative thoughts that come to my mind and challenge them. 3. When painful memories from the past get stuck in my brain, I will write them out from an adult perspective, which can stop the thoughts from circling in my head. 4. When I struggle with grief or a traumatic memory, I will read Rumi’s poem “The Guest House.” 5. When I feel anxious, I will practice five diaphragmatic breaths to calm myself. 6. When memories of a traumatic event surface, I will ask myself what I am thinking or feeling. Then in my mind, I will go back to the very first time in my life that I can remember thinking those thoughts or feeling those feelings to see if my past is infecting the present. If it is, I will say to myself, “That was then and this is now.” 7. When a lost loved one’s birthday (or other anniversary) arrives, I will spend time recalling happy memories and be grateful for the time we had together. 8. When I feel upset or lonely, I will call a friend and ask for his or her support.[177] K.

No matter what you want to do with yourlife, be passionate.JON BON JOVI--------------------------------------------------------------------------------On October 15, 1988, Kirk Gibson came to the plate as a pinch hitter in theninth inning of Game One of the World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers andthe Oakland A’s. Gibson, who was a star for the Dodgers that year, had injuredboth of his legs and didn’t play in the earlier innings of the game. Now he wasfacing Dennis Eckersley, one of the best closers in the American League, who hadsaved 45 games. The Dodgers were behind four runs to three, and there were twoouts and a runner on first base.When Gibson came to the plate, famed Dodger announcer Vin Scully said, “All yearlong, they looked to him to light the fire . . . and all year long he answeredthe demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight with two badlegs —the bad left hamstring and the swollen right knee. And with two outs, youtalk about a roll of the dice . . . this is it.”Gibson worked the count to three balls and two strikes, and then the whole worldheard Scully’s incredible voice cry, “High fly ball into right field. Shei-i-i-is . . . GONE!” Scully then said nothing for more than a minute, while thecameras told the story of the Dodgers’ win: pandemonium on the field at ChavezRavine in Los Angeles, the crowd going wild, and players pouring out of thedugout, jumping into the air, and hugging one another.[216] Over and over,sports fans have watched the clip of Kirk Gibson double pumping his right arm ashe rounds second base with a look of pure joy on his face —an iconic play thatwill forever be remembered in sports history. I have thought about that momentmany times in the past 30 years.In 1991, when we first started the brain imaging work we do at Amen Clinics, allof us were very excited. The scans gave us insights that allowed us to help manytreatment-resistant patients get better, faster than ever before. In one case,we treated a boy who had violent episodes that had led to three psychiatrichospitalizations. His scan showed he was likely having seizure activity on theleft side of his brain. Once put on antiseizure medication, he became calmer,sweeter, and more in control of his emotions. The treatment literally changedthe trajectory of his life. That gave us a home-run feeling. We also treated awoman who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, whose children were aboutto put her in a senior care facility to ensure her safety. She had leftsomething cooking on the stove and almost burned her house down. Her scanrevealed that she did not have Alzheimer’s disease. Instead, she was likelysuffering from a severe depression that masqueraded as Alzheimer’s. Withtreatment for depression, she got her memory and independence back. A doublearm-pump moment of joy for us, the patient, and her family. There was anotherpatient diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, this time a man, who wasdeteriorating month by month, but his scan showed he had enlarged, fluid-filledspaces in his brain. When the pressure on his brain was relieved by shunting outthe excess fluid, his memory and cognitive function returned and he had anotherdecade of high-quality life. Pure joy —for him and for us.There were many moments when we felt like Gibson as he rounded second base. Ofcourse, it wasn’t always like that. But the stories of change imprinted lastingjoy in the brains of our team members, which caused us to pay close attention towhat we were learning. Those incredible feelings helped us develop passion forand purpose in our work, despite brutal criticism in the beginning from some ofour colleagues. The word passion comes from the Latin word passionem, whichmeans “suffering” or “enduring.” Pursuing your passion requires endurance andmay involve suffering, thanks to the way our brains work.The passion and love I had for our patients and work helped me deal with thecriticism, as did a quotation from Dr. Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist, a Naziconcentration camp survivor, and the author of Man’s Search for Meaning: “Lifeis never made unbearable by circumstances, but only by lack of meaning andpurpose.”[217]Living with passion and purpose is a critical “feel better fast” strategy. Thischapter will look at what neuroscience says about purpose, meaning, passion, andlove (including new love) and the impact these have on the health of your brain.It will also look at what helps and hurts your pleasure centers, so you canavoid addictions and depression, and what happens when love, passion, or purposegoes wrong. It will help you find out how to know your purpose and actualize itin your life.PURPOSE CAN HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FASTDoes having meaning and purpose help you feel better fast and make it last? Inher research, University of Wisconsin psychologist Carol Ryff found that thosewho had a higher sense of purpose in life —defined as “the psychologicaltendency to derive meaning from life’s experiences and to possess a sense ofintentionality and goal directedness that guides behavior” —had * Better mental health * Less depression * Greater happiness * More satisfaction * More personal growth and self-acceptance * Better-quality sleep * LongevityOver time, researcher Patricia Boyle and colleagues from Rush University inChicago studied more than 900 people and found that higher scores on this“purpose” scale were associated with * A reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease * Less mild cognitive impairment * A slower rate of cognitive decline in old age[218]Other researchers have also associated purpose in life with a longer lifespan.One group measured “eudemonic wellbeing,” a type of well-being that relates toyour sense of control and purpose, and to feeling that what you do isworthwhile. The scientists followed 9,050 people over eight and a half years andfound that those who had higher scores on eudemonic wellbeing were 30 percentless likely to die during the follow-up period compared to those with the lowestscores. They also walked faster and had greater grip strength, two signs ofhealthy vigor.[219] As strength of purpose increases, so do physical strengthand endurance. Purpose in life has also been associated with lower risk ofcardiovascular disease[220] and stroke, higher levels of immunity, andbetter-quality sleep, with less sleep apnea and fewer restless legsymptoms.[221] Scoring higher in “purpose in life” also makes it less likelythat negative social media issues (such as not getting the number of likes youmight want on a post) will affect your self-esteem.[222] A lack of purpose hasbeen associated with negative health indicators, including higher levels of thestress hormone cortisol, increased markers of inflammation, lower HDLcholesterol levels, and greater amounts of abdominal fat.WHERE PASSION LIVES IN THE BRAINPurpose helps us find meaning in life, which in turn fuels our passion for thethings we find meaningful. Passion, purpose, and meaning all work in the drive,motivation, and pleasure centers deep in the brain. These areas include theventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens and caudate nucleus (both partof the basal ganglia), and substantia nigra (see figure on page 182[chapter_8.xhtml#page_182]). These regions are powered by the neurotransmitterdopamine. When Gibson hit his ninth-inning home run, dopamine flooded hispleasure centers, prompting him to double pump his fist. The basal gangliaintegrate emotion and movement, which is why we jump when we’re excited orfreeze when we get scared. When dopamine floods the basal ganglia, players throwup their arms, yell with joy, or run onto the baseball diamond as a group.Likewise, when an actor gets a standing ovation, an attorney wins an importantcase, a child brings home an excellent report card, or a pastor delivers apassionate sermon, dopamine is released, activating the pleasure centers —andtriggering good feelings.Along with dopamine, the neurotransmitter serotonin also plays an important rolein love, passion, and pleasure. Serotonin, released by the raphe nuclei deep inthe brain, is involved with mood, sleep, shifting attention, appetite, bowelfunction, and social relationships. It also helps to regulate anxiety andhappiness.Dopamine and serotonin tend to counterbalance each other in the brain. As onegoes up, the other generally goes down. Antidepressants that increase serotonin,such as Lexapro (escitalopram), Prozac (fluoxetine), and Zoloft (sertraline),can improve mood and decrease anxiety but can also decrease sexual desire andmotivation. Antidepressants that increase dopamine, such as Wellbutrin(bupropion), boost sex drive and can enhance focus and motivation, but they maytrigger anxiety. Stimulant medications that boost dopamine, such as Adderall(amphetamine salts) or Ritalin (methylphenidate), can increase focus andmotivation but can also decrease appetite and cause some people to feelobsessed.HOW DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND SEROTONIN AFFECT BEHAVIOR AND MOODNEUROTRANSMITTER LEVELDOPAMINE[223] EFFECTSSEROTONIN[224] EFFECTSHealthyFeelings of pleasure; feeling motivated and focusedFeeling happy and optimistic, with healthy sleep and bowel functionToo LowHigher incidence of depression and apathy; low levels are common in Parkinson’sdisease due to the death of dopamine-producing cells in the brain’s substantianigraDepression, anxiety, obsession, insomnia, irritable bowel issues, and cravingsfor sweets, which increase serotonin in the brain but also can make you gainweightToo HighFeeling anxious, agitated, aggressive; confusion; racing thoughts; troublesleeping; poor decision-makingFeeling passive, apathetic; lower motivation; decreased sexual desireSupplementsS-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe), L-tyrosine, bacopa, mucuna5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), saffron, L-tryptophanDOPAMINE AND SEROTONIN PATHWAYDiagram of the dopamine and serotonin pathway.

The functions of serotonin are mood, memory processing, sleep,and cognition. [images/Illustration-8.1.jpg]SEX, DRUGS, ROCK ’N’ ROLL, SMARTPHONES, VIDEO GAMES, . . . AND THE BRAINLiving in Southern California, I’ve had the opportunity to treat many famousperformers, including rock stars, singers, songwriters, actors, athletes, andpastors. Many have experienced worldwide fame, which releases massive amounts ofdopamine, stimulating their pleasure centers over and over as strangersrecognize them everywhere they go, often begging for autographs or screamingtheir names. Repeated, intense activation of the pleasure centers wears themout, much like a cocaine high that lessens with frequent use of the drug. Overtime, if these stars are not careful, it takes more and more dopamine-producingactivities —more fame, falling in love, affairs with multiple partners, drugs,racing cars, and even stealing —just to feel normal or not to feel depressed. Somany Hollywood actors, singers, sports figures, and celebrity pastors havefollowed this tragic pattern that I have a prayer for young stars-in-the-making:“God, please don’t let them be famous before their brains develop” —which, as wehave seen, is usually around the age of 25.If the pleasure centers become damaged by overuse, toxins, or head trauma, or ifdopamine is excessively high for prolonged periods, the ventral tegmental area,nucleus accumbens, and basal ganglia become less responsive. The dopamine highstops being as intense as it once was. This increases the risk of depression —oraddiction to substances that people turn to in order to fix the bad feelingscaused by the numbing of these brain regions. The addictive substances includenicotine, alcohol, methamphetamines, cocaine, pornography, and food(specifically, foods high in sugar and fat). When a powerful release of dopaminehits the pleasure centers, increases euphoria, and then wears off, people canfeel flat or depressed and start craving a way out of the bad feelings. As aresult, they reengage in the actions that intensely ramped up their dopaminelevels in the first place. Over time, it takes more and more of the substance toget the same response. This is the cycle of addiction.THE ADDICTION CYCLEA cycle showing five stages. Stage 1: Engage in actions to increase dopamine.Stage 2: Feel high or pleasure. Stage 3: When dopamine wears off, experiencewithdrawal, leaving you feeling flat or depressed. Stage 4: Reengage indopamine-producing behavior, even if it is bad for you. Stage 5: With intensestimulation, pleasure centers need more and more excitement in order to feelanything at all. [images/Illustration-8.2.jpg]Many forces in our changing society, besides fame, are putting excessive demandson our pleasure centers. Text messaging, e-mail, video games, social media,television, and using multiple electronic devices can overstimulate our pleasurecenters in the same way that cocaine does, psychologist Archibald Hart warned inThrilled to Death: How the Endless Pursuit of Pleasure Is Leaving Us Numb.[225]We all know people who are glued to their smartphones even while they aretalking to others. For these people, every time their devices ping to signal anew incoming message, it causes a small release of dopamine. Television is allabout “breaking news” and quick, high-intensity action (think Game of Thrones).Dopamine is constantly released in video gamers as they play, and the games werespecifically designed to hook your attention, according to Nir Eyal’s Hooked. Asvideo game and technology usage goes up, so do depression and obesity.[226] IanBogost, famed video game designer (Cow Clicker and Cruel 2 B Kind) and chair ofmedia studies and professor of interactive computing at the Georgia Institute ofTechnology, called these new habit-forming technologies “the cigarette of thiscentury” and warned of their “equally addictive and potentially destructive sideeffects.”[227]And that’s not all. Have you ever wondered why there are so many horror films?Why, in addition to the movie Saw, are there also Saw II, Saw III, Saw IV, SawV, Saw VI, Saw 3D (VII), and Jigsaw (VIII)? I once asked a producer why he madePiranha 3D, a horror film about a horde of razor-teeth-equipped prehistoricpiranhas, released by a tremor beneath a lake, that wreak havoc on bikini-cladcoeds on spring break. He said, “People want them, they go see them, and theymake money.” Even just watching the trailer will give you a dopamine jolt.In short, our devices,[228] online communities, games, TV-watching habits, andscary movies are wearing out our pleasure centers and changing our brains. Ourfast-paced, pleasure-seeking lifestyle is robbing us of the ability toexperience joy from the simple things in life. Things that once made ushappy —such as a smile from a friend, a glorious sunset, or a great tennismatch —have lost the power to move us. Our excessive pursuit of constantthrills, Archibald Hart suggested, may contribute to emotional problems, such asdepression and anxiety, as well as addictions to drugs, alcohol, Internetgambling, pornography, and compulsive shopping.[229]Even new love, for millennials at least, has turned into a video game. AmenClinics collaborated with The Dr. Oz Show on a brain imaging–Tinder experimentwith several thirtysomething men and women to determine the effect of the datingapp on mood and focus. If they were lucky enough to get a “swipe right” —meaningsomeone using the dating app liked their pictures and short bio —it increasedactivity in the pleasure and mood centers of their brains. If, however, therewere fewer “swipes right” and more “swipes left,” indicating rejection, theirbrains were more vulnerable to pain and depression.In 2005, anthropologist Helen Fisher from Rutgers University published agroundbreaking study using functional MRI (fMRI) brain scans of college studentswho viewed pictures of someone who was special to them along with those ofacquaintances. The pictures of their loved ones activated the pleasure centersin their brains, rich in the “feel-good” neurotransmitter dopamine that’sinvolved with attention and the motivation to pursue and acquire rewards.[230]That is why, when you do find a match on a dating site or at work or church, thehigh of new love can feel like an addiction with its euphoria, craving,withdrawal, and the need for more and more to feel good.[231] New love works inthe same areas of the brain as cocaine and can cause people to feel giddy,anxious, uncertain, or obsessed; irrationally notice the positive and completelymiss the negative; make poor decisions; have trouble sleeping; and feel as ifthey are on a roller coaster.When new love is rejected, the brain’s pain centers are activated, making itmore likely that people will drink alcohol or use drugs to counteract thenegative feelings. Alternatively, if the high of new love simply wears off, theother person’s faults become easy to see, and couples can more rationally decidewhether to stay together or separate. It is for this reason that you should bevery cautious about marrying someone within the first few months of meeting. Youcan’t be certain if you’re marrying the actual person or a dopamine-inducedillusion.New research also shows that lasting love, even after 20 years or more, canstill activate the brain’s pleasure centers, but in different ways than newlove. Lasting love provides a deeper sense of bonding and connection, peace,happiness, and warmth —more akin to the warmth of heroin than the jolt ofcocaine. The feeling of being high on heroin was once anonymously described as“being cradled to sleep by God, wrapped up in a warm, luxurious blanket thatshields you from all your worldly fears, angers, and pains.” While the pain of anew-love breakup feels awful, leaving a long-term love relationship is typicallymuch worse, more akin to heroin withdrawal. Many people describe it as havingtheir skin ripped off while they are awake. It is often associated with symptomssimilar to heroin withdrawal as well —diarrhea, nausea, depression, and a senseof hopelessness that can go on for months, together with anxiety, panic, andsleeplessness. Cleary, love’s connection with our pleasure centers is powerful.Research has also shown that having passion for your work[232] and even being asports fanatic[233] can activate the reward or pleasure circuits deep within thebrain, and like love, these experiences can be extremely positive —or negative.They can make us feel balanced or unbalanced. As we mentioned in chapter 3, atAmen Clinics we did the first and largest brain imaging study on active andretired NFL players. As you might imagine, we saw high levels of brain damage inplayers, but we also saw the possibility of recovery in 80 percent of them.[234]In addition, depression was very high in these players —four times the nationalaverage. Brain trauma (from hits and concussions) is certainly one of the causesof depression, but many of the players also clearly missed football. They missedthe camaraderie, the game itself, the competition, the money, the adulation ofthe crowds, and the fame. When the game was gone from their lives, the dopaminedrip of positive football pleasure chemicals was also gone, which contributed totheir depression.Whenever one door of love, passion, or purpose closes, it is critical to findothers to replace it with in order to keep your pleasure centers functioning andreleasing dopamine in a healthy way. If you don’t, you are more prone to lowfeelings and depression. That’s why depression is more common after retirement,especially when retirees don’t find a new source of passion and purpose. Infact, although retirement can initially boost your health, it later increasesyour risk of clinical depression by 40 percent while raising your chances ofbeing diagnosed with a physical condition or illness by 60 percent.[235]HOW TO PROTECT YOUR PLEASURE CENTERS TO FEEL BETTER FAST AND CREATE LIFELONG JOYWith so many diversions in our lives that have the potential to negativelyaffect our pleasure centers and keep us from experiencing purpose and passionfor the things we value most, we need to act. Here are some simple steps to takein order to protect your pleasure centers and keep them healthy: * Limit or completely eliminate the use of constantly stimulating devices and activities, such as smartphones, gaming, shopping, pornography, scary movies, and high-risk activities (see page 187 [chapter_8.xhtml#page_187] for a longer list). * Engage in regular physical exercise, especially something you love that does not endanger your brain, such as dancing, swimming, or tennis. * Meditate —it protects the brain while enhancing a sense of well-being. * Make time to laugh —humor enhances the pleasure centers without wearing them out. * Connect meaningful activities with pleasure, such as volunteering for activities you love. One example: I love table tennis and enjoy keeping score for others during tournaments.2 minutes. [images/x02-min.jpg] * Start every day by thinking of three things for which you are grateful (a small dopamine drip) and one person you appreciate (another small dopamine drip), then reach out through text or e-mail to tell that person you appreciate him or her. (See chapter 5, pages 110–111 [chapter_5.xhtml#page_110].) You are building a bridge of gratitude. If the person responds, it is yet another, maybe bigger, dopamine drip. * Seek pleasure in the little things in your life, such as a walk with a friend, holding hands with your spouse, a great meal, or a meaningful church service. * Eat foods that contain dopamine-boosting properties, such as chicken, turkey, seafood, almonds, pumpkin and sesame seeds, turmeric, oregano,[236] vegetables (for folate and magnesium), olive oil, and green tea. * Consider supplements to support dopamine, such as omega-3 fatty acids, SAMe, and green tea extract. Don’t try them all at once; try them one at a time to see which ones work best for you.

VIKTOR FRANKL’S CONTRIBUTION--------------------------------------------------------------------------------He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Having purpose in life will give you a constant, never-ending drip of dopamine.This has been my personal experience over the past three decades. It starts byknowing what gives your life a deep sense of meaning. As we’ve mentioned, Dr.Viktor Frankl was a psychiatrist and World War II concentration camp survivor.He was also the father of logotherapy, a form of psychotherapy based on the ideathat humans are strongly motivated to live with purpose. He believed that we canfind meaning as a result of responding genuinely and compassionately to life’schallenges. My friend Dr. Jeff Zeig, who personally knew Dr. Frankl, told methat he heard Dr. Frankl say, “If it is meaningful, I do it. If it is notmeaningful, I don’t have time for it.”[237]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------“If it is meaningful, I do it. If it is not meaningful, I don’t have time forit.” —Dr. Viktor Frankl----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In a world of constant, meaningless distractions, this is incredibly importantadvice. Ask yourself, What am I doing that is meaningful that I could do moreof, and what am I doing that is meaningless that I could do less of?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Before World War II, Frankl, who was living in Austria, applied for and receiveda visa to go to the United States. His sister also got a visa and emigrated toAustralia just as Hitler’s power was growing and the barbarism in Austria wasincreasing. With his visa in hand, Frankl was in a quandary about whether tostay or leave. One day he was ruminating about his choice —staying to protecthis parents or leaving to escape the concentration camps and continue with hiswork. At his parents’ home he saw a piece of marble marked with one of theHebrew letters from the Ten Commandments. His father had found it at the site ofthe largest synagogue in Vienna, which had been burned.[238] Frankl asked hisfather, “What letter is this?” His father said, “Well, it could only be one ofthe Commandments, ‘Honor thy father and mother.’” At that moment, Frankl decidedto give up his visa. As he explained to Dr. Zeig, “You could look at [themarble] as just a piece of calcium carbonate —it was nothing.” But when he couldproject meaning into that moment, it changed the direction and destiny of hislife.[239]When Frankl was taken to his first concentration camp, he brought a manuscript,which he hid inside the lining of his coat in an attempt to save it. Of course,as soon as he arrived at the camp, the guards stripped him and he losteverything. This experience led him to break from the then-popular theories ofDr. Abraham Maslow. If you remember your college introductory psychology course,you may recall that Maslow created a “hierarchy of needs.” He theorized thatunless your basic needs were met, you could not do things that weretranscendent. Frankl believed that Maslow was wrong —that even in the mosthorrific, barbaric circumstances, there was still the possibility that you couldcreate meaning. In the camps, Frankl saw people who were not safe, were withoutproper clothing, had little food, and were stripped of every dignity still makeheroic contributions if they could find the purpose in their situations. Hebelieved that people in all circumstances have a choice in how they respond,even to suffering. He also disagreed with the behaviorists at the time, whobelieved that humans responded to a stimulus with a predictable response.Stephen Covey has written about finding words that he believed crystallizeFrankl’s teaching on suffering: “Between stimulus and response, there is aspace. In that space lies our freedom and our power to choose our response. Inour response lies our growth and our happiness.”[240]Resilience, Frankl believed, stemmed from love. When he was dealing withfrostbite and swollen legs, didn’t have warm clothes, and had to work inice-cold conditions, Frankl said that he survived by looking up at the sky andthinking of his wife, Tilly. He would focus on love and recognize that it wasthe most profound and meaningful virtue. It was the central point that couldhelp him survive the horrors he was living through. When you are facing adifficult situation, having something purposeful to focus on, particularly love,crystallizes resilience. To recover from the horror of being in the camps,Frankl knew that meaning and purpose were a critical part of the healingprocess.Frankl believed there were three ways to create meaning: * Purposeful work, or being productive —asking questions such as “Why is the world a better place because I am here?” or “What do I contribute?” * Love —loving the people who are central to our lives * Courage in the face of difficulty —shouldering whatever difficult fate we have and helping others shoulder theirs[241]In the midst of difficulty, Frankl said, “everything can be taken from a man butone thing: the last of the human freedoms —to choose one’s attitude in any givenset of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”[242] He encouraged his patientsto see meaning in life’s moments and to direct their focus away from painfulones to more appealing circumstances. “Love is the ultimate and the highest goalto which man can aspire,” Frankl said.[243] “Self-transcendence provides apathway to ultimate meaning.”[244]He also helped people find meaning through * Creative values —what we create, achieve, and accomplish * Experiential values —experiencing what is good, true, and beautiful, or fully knowing another human * Attitudinal values —looking for meaning in situations, even those that appear meaningless[245]There is a story, for example, about Frankl treating an older doctor who couldnot stop grieving the loss of his wife. He asked the man, “What would havehappened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to surviveyou?”“Oh,” the man replied, “for her this would have been terrible; how she wouldhave suffered!”Frankl said, “You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it wasyou who have spared her this suffering —to be sure, at the price that now youhave to survive and mourn her.”The man said nothing but shook Frankl’s hand and left his office. Frankl said,“When we are no longer able to change a situation . . . we are challenged tochange ourselves. . . . In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at themoment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.”[246] While wecan’t avoid suffering, we can choose how to respond to it. When we discovermeaning in it, we can move forward.ONE-PAGE MIRACLE: HOW TO FOCUS ON LOVE, MEANING, AND PURPOSEIn my work with patients, I ask all of them to get clarity of purpose bycompleting an exercise I call the One-Page Miracle (OPM). Completing it allowsyou to define what you want and to focus like a laser on your life’s meaning andpurpose.When you tell your brain what you want, your balanced brain will help you alignyour behavior to get it! Whatever your brain sees, it helps to make happen. Ifyou focus on negativity, you will feel depressed. If you focus on fear, you arelikely to feel anxious. If you focus on achieving your goals with passion andpurpose, you are much more likely to achieve them. Too many people are thrownaround by the whims of the day, rather than using their brains to guide theirpaths.The OPM will help guide your thoughts, words, and actions. I call it theOne-Page Miracle because I have seen this exercise quickly focus and change manypeople’s lives.To develop your own OPM, ask yourself what you truly want in the followingareas, including how those areas give you love, meaning, and purpose.What do I want in my relationships with mypartnerchildrenparentssiblingsextended familyfriendsWhat do I want in my work?What do I want in my finances?What do I want for myself in these arenas?PhysicalEmotionalSpiritualCreativeExperientialAttitudinalAlso, ask yourself,What makes me happy?What do I naturally pay attention to?What kind of books do I read?What do I love to talk or learn about?What work would I do for free?What boosts dopamine for me —gives me a jolt of joy and pleasure?What are my strengths?Where can I add value or make a difference?How do I believe my life will be measured —by my friends, my family, and my God?KNOW YOUR PURPOSE IN FIVE MINUTES5 minutes. [images/x05-min.jpg]One of my favorite TEDx talks is on how to find your life’s purpose in fiveminutes, by Adam Leipzig, CEO of Entertainment Media Partners; it has more than10 million views.[247] Leipzig started by telling a story about his 25th collegereunion at Yale University. He said he made an astounding discovery: 80 percentof his privileged, well-off, powerful friends were unhappy with their lives,despite being on their second spouses and second houses. The difference betweenthem and the 20 percent who were happy was “knowing their purpose,” which makessense given the research we’ve discussed. To know your purpose, Leipzig said,you have to know the answers to five simple questions: 1. Who are you? What is your name? 2. What do you love to do? Examples include writing, cooking, designing, creating, speaking, teaching, crunching numbers, etc. To get clarity of purpose, ask yourself, “What is the one thing I do where I feel supremely qualified to teach others?” 3. Whom do you do it for? Or, how does your work connect you to others? 4. What do those people want or need from you? 5. How do they change as a result of what you do?When I answer these questions, it looks like this: 1. My name is Daniel. 2. I love optimizing people’s brains and inspiring people to care about their brains. I love doing it within the context of our team at Amen Clinics. 3. We do it for our families as well as for those who come to our clinics, read our books, or watch our shows. 4. The people we touch want to suffer less, feel better, be sharper, and have greater control over their lives. They want better brains and better lives. 5. As a result of what we do, people change by having better brains and better lives. They suffer less, become happier and healthier, and pass it on to others.Notice that only two of the five questions are about you; three are aboutothers.There is a Chinese saying that goes, “If you want happiness for an hour, take anap. If you want happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for ayear, inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime, help somebody.”For centuries, the greatest thinkers have suggested the same thing: Happiness isfound in helping others.Leipzig closed the talk by teaching us a powerful technique. He said, “Whenyou’re at a gathering and someone asks you, ‘What do you do?’ answer by tellingthem the answer to question number five.” In my example, when people ask me whatI do, I say, “As a result of what we do, people have better brains and betterlives. They suffer less, become happier and healthier, and pass it on toothers.” By answering that simple question, I get to share my life purpose witheveryone I meet, which certainly produces a bit of dopamine to press on mypleasure centers. How would you answer that question?FIVE STRATEGIES TO CREATE LASTING JOY AND FEEL BETTER FAST--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognizedby yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you arethrown on the scrapheap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish,selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world willnot devote itself to making you happy.GEORGE BERNARD SHAW--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. FOCUS ON WHAT YOU WANT —ON WHAT GIVES YOU PASSION AND PURPOSE.2 minutes. [images/x02-min.jpg]Read your OPM daily and ask yourself, Is my behavior getting me what I want?With my wife, Tana, for example, I deeply desire a lifelong relationship that iskind, caring, loving, supportive, and passionate. I don’t always feel like it inthe moment, but that is what I always want. Having a close relationship with herwill help me feel happy and stable and is incredibly important to my sense ofmeaning and purpose. Know what you want, write it down, and look at it everyday. It will encourage your brain to help make it happen.2. LIMIT OR COMPLETELY ELIMINATE LOW-VALUE DOPAMINE-PRODUCING ACTIVITIES ORSUBSTANCES THAT WEAR OUT YOUR PLEASURE CENTERS.These include * Caffeine * Nicotine * Excessive television * Excessive video games * Pornography * Undisciplined digital behavior * Scary movies3. ENGAGE IN HIGH-VALUE ACTIVITIES THAT INCREASE DOPAMINE AND STRENGTHEN YOURBRAIN.Here are a number of examples:[248] * Sunlight (vitamin D) * Exercise * Meditation * Yoga * Touch * Massage therapy * Pleasurable music * DHA from fish oil * Olive oil * Green tea * Protein-rich diet * Turmeric * Oregano * Magnesium * Resveratrol4. FOCUS EACH MOMENT ON LIVING WITH MEANING AND PURPOSE.Ask yourself, Do the foods I am eating, the exercises I am doing, theconversations I am having, and the activities I am engaging in have meaning?Toward the end of his life, Viktor Frankl would only do things that were deeplysignificant to him. He received thousands of requests but focused his efforts onjust those that were the most meaningful to him. He was afraid of flying, so heactually took up flying small planes to overcome his fear. He once said, “Thereare some things about myself I don’t have to tolerate.”[249] His is such apowerful model for living. Look at your day —where are you spending your time?Does it help you reach your OPM goals? Get rid of the things in your life thatdo not fit your goals.One of my friends, Larry, an attorney in New York, complained that histhree-year-old daughter, Lara, wanted nothing to do with him when he came home.He said, “That must be a girl thing. At that age, they just want their mothers.”“Nonsense,” I replied, “you’re not spending enough time with her.” I knew he wasworking too late and just using “It’s a girl thing” as a rationalization.He complained that there were too many things happening at work that he couldnot let go. I had Larry do the One-Page Miracle exercise, and afterward it wasclear that his wife and daughter were very important to him. Then I asked him tobe aware of all his activities at work for a week. Keeping detailed notes on hisactivities each day, he could tell he was wasting a lot of time: He walked tothe coffee shop twice a day for drinks; three or four times a week he went tolunch with friends; and he constantly took phone calls from colleagues who hadquestions about their businesses. I asked him to define his work goals andfigure out what were the most important things for him to be doing at work. Whatwere the tasks and activities that built and sustained his business? He wrotethree things: 1. Take great care of my current clients, 2. Develop new clients, and 3. Spend 10 percent of my time on pro bono work.I suggested he let go of anything unrelated to these three goals. Then I toldhim about one of the most powerful exercises I have ever given parents —“specialtime,” where you spend 20 minutes a day with a child, doing something he or shechooses to do. (I describe it in chapter 6, page 139[chapter_6.xhtml#page_139].) Larry did it faithfully every day with Lara, and atwork he focused on what was truly important to him. He brought his coffee towork, he limited lunch with friends to once a week, and he screened calls.Within a month, he was coming home earlier, and whenever he walked through thedoor, Lara ran to her daddy, wrapped her tiny arms around his legs, and huggedhim closely. He was happier than ever. Be sure you spend time on the things thatmatter.5. LIVE WITH THE END IN MIND.Psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, a pioneer in near-death studies and theauthor of the groundbreaking book On Death and Dying, said, “It is the denial ofdeath that is partially responsible for people living empty, purposeless lives;for when you live as if you’ll live forever, it becomes too easy to postpone thethings you know that you must do.”[250] If you truly want to live a purposefullife, live with the end in mind. None of us knows when death is going to come,but if you knew you would be dead in a week, a month, a year, or five years,what would matter to you most? Where and with whom would you spend your time? Incollege I took a death and dying course in which we studied Dr. Kübler-Ross’swork. Our final paper was writing our own funeral service, which has had animpact on me ever since. I picked Louis Armstrong’s song “When the Saints GoMarching In” as one of the music pieces.What will matter toward the end of your life? What will you want to be doing?Whom will you want to be with? What will have mattered in your life? If you livethat way along the journey, you’ll find your life more purposeful, moremeaningful, and more filled with love.TINY HABITS THAT CAN HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FAST —AND LEAD TO BIG CHANGES3 to 30 minutes. [images/x03-30-min.jpg]Each of these habits takes just a few minutes. They are anchored to somethingyou do (or think or feel) so that they are more likely to become automatic. Onceyou do the behaviors you want, find a way to make yourself feel good aboutthem —draw a happy face, pump your fist, or do whatever feels natural. Emotionhelps the brain to remember. 1. When I need to get work done, I will put my smartphone on “Do not disturb” as a discipline to be more focused and to stop the constant pings or drips of dopamine it tries to addict me to. 2. When I am on the train or bus to work, I will read my One-Page Miracle and ask myself, “Will my behavior today get me what I want?” 3. When I start getting upset about something happening in my day, I’ll ask myself, “Does this have eternal value?” 4. When it is sunny outdoors, I will take a walk to soak up the sunshine and boost my vitamin D level. 5. When I start the coffee or tea in the morning, I’ll think of three things for which I’m grateful. 6. Once a week, I will watch a comedy to boost my dopamine level (Whose Line Is It Anyway? is a great show to start with). 7. Before I go to bed, I will write down one purposeful thing I did that day.FIVE STRATEGIES TO CREATE LASTING JOY AND FEEL BETTER FASTTo live with love, passion, meaning, and purpose over a prolonged period oftime, 1. Focus on what you want —on what gives you passion and purpose. 2. Limit or completely eliminate low-value dopamine-producing activities or substances that wear out your pleasure centers. 3. Engage in high-value activities that increase dopamine and strengthen your brain. 4. Focus each moment on living with meaning and purpose. 5. Live with the end in mind.[216] “WS1988 Gm1: Scully’s Call of Gibson Memorable At-Bat,” YouTube video,9:44, posted by “MLB,” September 21, 2016,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4nwMDZYXTI[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4nwMDZYXTI].[217] “Lessons from Leaders of the Past: Viktor Frankl,” Charles Koch Institutewebsite, accessed May 3, 2018,https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/blog/lessons-leaders-past-viktor-frankl/[https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/blog/lessons-leaders-past-viktor-frankl/].[218] P.

At first I was very fearful that I wouldn’t be satisfied, orthat my cravings would just drive me back to the same old foods and hugeportions. But something amazing happened —my cravings disappeared virtuallyOVERNIGHT. I had no idea that nutritious foods could be so satisfying!

Hehad seen endocrinologists, psychiatrists, cardiologists, and sleep doctors withno relief. He had tried multiple medications after a suicide attempt, but noneof them had helped.One of the strategies we commonly use at Amen Clinics is to change our patients’diets. We help them eat foods that nourish their brains and bodies —such ascolorful vegetables and fruits as well as healthy proteins and fats —andeliminate, at least temporarily, all of the potential troublemaker foods thatcould be causing negative reactions in their bodies, such as gluten, dairy,corn, soy, food additives and preservatives, and artificial sweeteners. I firstheard of this idea more than 25 years ago from my friend Dr. Doris Rapp, who sawremarkable improvements in children with ADHD, aggression, and even autism whenthey eliminated these foods. Subsequently, I have read a growing number ofstudies in journals, such as the Lancet, reporting significant benefits fromdietary interventions.[251] Some of our patients resist —remember, the brainhates change —but we reassure them that when this strategy is conscientiouslyapplied, it can be more effective than almost anything else they could do fortheir health.In medical school, like most of my colleagues, I received minimal nutritioneducation, equivalent to two days out of the 140 weeks it takes to get a medicaldegree. This state of affairs is insane given that 75 percent of the health caredollars in the United States are spent on chronic, preventable illnesses[252]that stem from our diet and lifestyle choices. Research suggests that our poorchoices account for 90 percent of type 2 diabetes, 80 percent of coronary arterydisease, 70 percent of strokes, and 70 percent of colon cancer.[253] Poor dietsare also associated with depression,[254] anxiety,[255] ADHD,[256]dementia,[257] and even suicide.[258] But there is good news: Brain-healthydiets have been shown to be effective treatments for depression,[259] ADHD,[260]and cognitive decline.[261]When I first attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings as part of mypsychiatric training, I was dismayed to see that many recovering alcoholicscontinued to smoke cigarettes, drink loads of coffee filled with fake creamersand sugar, and eat donuts and other unhealthy foods. In their attempts to getbetter, they were perpetuating inflammation and making themselves worse. Eventoday, when I speak at churches, schools, hospitals, addiction treatmentcenters, and businesses —places that are supposed to be serving the health ofothers —I’m routinely horrified by the food that’s served, which is toxic tobrain health.Victor, whose story I opened with, was a vegetarian, which put him at a higherrisk of depression,[262] and his diet consisted mostly of beans, rice, corn, andcheese. He told our nutritionist he was willing to try a healthier diet and gaveup gluten, dairy, corn, and all the other potential problem foods mentionedearlier. As I wrote in Memory Rescue, after a week on the new eating plan, hismood was better than it had been in years. Then he added back each of the foods,one at a time. He added back gluten, and nothing happened. The same was true ofdairy, except he had more gas and a queasy stomach, and of soy. But when headded back corn, he said he knew “within a couple of bites” that it was theproblem. He had an image of putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger,something that had not happened since before he went on the diet. Even thoughVictor loved corn chips, corn tortillas, and popcorn, they obviously did notlove him back. He decided that this bad relationship was not worth the pain, sohe kicked corn out of his life. He was shocked that after suffering for so longhe could feel normal with so little effort. You can too —by eliminating foodsthat are potentially harmful for you and only eating those that serve yourhealth.Food can be medicine or poison. Intuitively, most people know that certain foodsaffect their energy and moods. Having a big plate of pasta at lunch, forexample, causes a blood sugar spike that makes you feel great for a short while.But it also stimulates your pancreas to produce lots of insulin, which willultimately make your blood sugar fall so you feel tired and lethargic, as ifyour mind were swimming in mud.This chapter will give you a dietary plan in five straightforward strategies tohelp you feel better fast.THE FEEL BETTER FAST DIET: FIVE SIMPLE STRATEGIES 1. Give yourself an attitude makeover. 2. Learn the Feel Better Fast food rules. 3. Time your meals to get healthier. 4. Choose 20 foods you love that love you back. 5. Know which foods to lose and which to choose to help attention, energy, mood, memory, anxiety, pain, and sleep.STRATEGY #1: GIVE YOURSELF AN ATTITUDE MAKEOVER.Your attitude, or mind-set, may be the single most important factor in feelingbetter fast. When your mind-set is one of deprivation and your focus is on whatyou cannot have, you are more likely to remain mired in illness and brain fog.Yes, you may be giving up sugary fast foods and beverages you enjoy —which areoften, by the way, pesticide-laden —but these are the very things that driveinflammation and illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, depression,dementia, and early death. To feel better fast and make it last for a lifetime,it is critical to develop an abundance mind-set, where you focus on thehigh-quality, nutritious, and delicious foods you can have that build andsustain your health. If you are able to change your attitude about this,everything else will be easier.Think for a moment about the advertising slogans that swirl on the airwaves andInternet and on food packaging, targeted at you and your children: * “I’m lovin’ it” * “It’s finger lickin’ good!” * “Have it your way” * “Open happiness” * “You deserve a break today” * “Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener . . .” * “They’re gr-r-reat!” * “They’re magically delicious!” * “The Breakfast of Champions” * “Melts in your mouth, not in your hand” * “Betcha can’t eat just one”Big business has purposefully designed these catchy jingles and phrases totarget your mind and trigger the “bliss point” in your brain. Yes, you are beingbrainwashed. In the 1970s, Howard Moskowitz, a mathematician, discovered theperfect combination of sugar, salt, and fat that would optimize the humanbrain’s pleasure experience —what he dubbed the “bliss point.” Triggering it notonly increases sensory experiences like taste and texture but activates thenucleus accumbens and other centers deep in the brain that are associated withmotivation and pleasure. As discussed in chapter 8 (see page 183[chapter_8.xhtml#page_183]), the nucleus accumbens is the same part of the brainthat is activated by certain drugs, such as cocaine, methamphetamines, nicotine,and morphine. In other words, the job of food designers is to create foods thathook your brain, just as addictive drugs do. “Betcha can’t eat just one”! Theywere not kidding.Here are a few of the weapons food scientists have discovered or manipulated tohook your brain: * Vanishing caloric density or “meltiness”: Foods that melt quickly make the brain think there are fewer calories; hence you eat more. * Sensory-specific satiety: This refers to our tendency to become bored with eating the same food multiple times. Researchers discovered how to override the brain signal behind it by not including one distinct, overwhelming flavor. (Cooking with a variety of healthy herbs and spices does the same thing, only in a healthy way.) * Perfect crunchiness: The perfect break point for this pleasure signal is four pounds of pressure. * Texture: Removing fiber helps food slide down the throat more easily and increases the pleasure sensation. Fiberless food also means you can eat your food more quickly and get out of the fast food restaurant in less time, meaning these food emporiums can serve more bodies in a single day. * Aroma: Flavor is enhanced by aroma. In fact, humans have only five major taste sensations —sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami, or savory, as in meat broth or tomato sauce. Other nuances are created through smell. That’s why Cinnabon, for example, places ovens at the front of its stores and bakes fresh rolls every 30 minutes on a schedule. Between times, the chain eatery often bakes brown sugar and cinnamon just to create the enticing aroma that patrons seem helpless to resist. * Sugar: In animal and human studies, sugar has been found to be an addictive substance that prompts bingeing, reward-seeking, craving, and tolerance (it takes more and more to get the same response).[263]Society and corporations blame you for being overweight or sick because you lackself-control and portion control, or because your level of exercise isinadequate. But how can you have self-control when food scientists have beenusing sophisticated neuroscience and plotting against your brain for decades?The first step in reorienting your eating habits is to stop being a victim ofthe food companies and start taking control of the food you put in your body.Start by changing your attitude. Why do I buy only healthy food for my familyand team members at Amen Clinics? These are behaviors that help fuel success inevery area of our lives. Plus, I love my family, the people I work with, andmyself. Doing the right things for our health is never about deprivation; it isalways about the abundance of what we really want —happiness, mental clarity,energy, effectiveness, and longevity. Why should you be serious about thequality of the nutrients you put in your body and the bodies of those you careabout? Because doing so gives all of you the best chances at feeling great nowand later, and because you love your friends, your family, and yourself. It’sreally that simple. Making consistently good decisions about food is an act oflove. Damaging your most precious assets (brain and body) with poor-qualityfoodlike substances is an act of pure sabotage toward yourself and others.Over the years, many people have told me this position is extreme and I shouldlighten up. Their reasoning includes responses like these: * “It’s best to practice moderation.” I believe this is usually an excuse or rationalization to make poor decisions. * “Relax! We are all dying, so why not have a little fun along the way?” Yes, we are all dying, but why accelerate it? Doesn’t the quality of your life, now and into the future, matter? This response also reveals a lack of understanding that high-quality food can taste amazing. * “I can’t afford to eat healthy.” In truth, you can’t afford not to eat healthy. Consuming low-quality, cheap food ends up being far more expensive in the long run in terms of elevated health care costs and poor decision-making. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, eating healthy costs about an extra $1.50 a day.[264] You can make that up with one less coffee run. * “I don’t have time.” Sure, grabbing a donut or ordering take-out burritos or deep-fried wings provides a speedy meal, but it’s just as fast to grab an apple or orange or to order take-out salad bowls —and they will help you feel better fast and stay healthier. It takes some planning to eat food that is good for you, but meal kits from AmazonFresh, Walmart (Takeout Kit and Home Chef), and others can help without breaking your budget or requiring a lot of time. * “It’s too hard.” Being disciplined about eating is not the easiest habit to incorporate in a world of toxic choices, but it’s worth the effort. Think of it this way: Whatever you are doing now is a habit, and you can develop new habits that serve your health rather than steal from it. * “Why be so radical?” I am convinced we need to be more serious now than ever. Low-quality diets are clearly associated with poor school performance in childhood and dementia in the elderly, and virtually every illness in between, including depression, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and obesity. My wife, Tana, and I wrote about this in The Brain Warrior’s Way, detailing how you are literally in a war for the health of your brain. Everywhere you go, someone is trying to entice you to swallow unhealthy food that can lead to an early death.Research is uncovering ever more reasons for urgency. In a recent study in miceat the University of Bonn, scientists found that a high-fat, high-calorieWestern diet appears to make the immune system react as it would to a bacterialinfection. This diet made the mice’s immune systems more aggressive over thelong run, and even after the animals were put on a healthy eating plan, theirbodies responded with greater inflammation —a response that may be linked to thedevelopment of type 2 diabetes and clogged arteries.[265] All this research canprovide motivation for us to make over our attitudes and develop a positivemind-set toward healthy eating.STRATEGY #2: LEARN THE FEEL BETTER FAST FOOD RULES.There are nine rules, or guidelines, that will help you start to eat healthier.You may already be following some of these guidelines —if so, good for you! Themore of them you adopt, the better off your brain and body will be.CONCENTRATE ON CONSUMING BRAIN-SMART CALORIESCalories do matter. If you eat more of them than you burn, you will definitelygain weight, and as discussed in the introduction (see page xxv[introduction.xhtml#page_xxv]), as your weight goes up, the size and function ofyour brain go down. Yet the quality of your calories matters more than theamount. Contrast a 582-calorie meal of a large soda and a slice of pizza, whichpromotes inflammation, brain fog, and illness, with a 540-calorie meal of wildsalmon, Swiss chard, sweet potato, and dark chocolate, which promotes goodhealth. Your brain will be sick on the first regimen and healthier on thesecond. If you struggle with your weight, focusing on quality, not quantity, mayalso lead you to consume fewer calories and shed pounds: A recent study of 600people led by the Stanford Prevention Research Center found that those whofocused on eating healthier foods without worrying about cutting calories lostsignificant amounts of weight and improved on a number of health measures,including waist size and blood sugar and blood pressure levels.[266]I am a value spender. Even though I have enough money, I hate wasting it. Ithink of calories like money and hate wasting them as well. Focus on foods thatare nutritious, delicious, and calorie smart.MAKE (ZERO-CALORIE) WATER YOUR BEVERAGE OF CHOICEYour brain is 80 percent water. Being dehydrated by just 2 percent impairs yourability to carry out tasks that require attention, memory, and physicalperformance.[267] I recommend drinking about eight 10-ounce glasses of water aday. If you drink a glass of water 30 minutes before meals or snacks, you’relikely to eat less and still feel satiated. However, avoid drinking water withyour meal, as it slows down digestion by diluting stomach acid. And try to limitconsumption of anything that dehydrates you, including caffeine, alcohol, andother diuretics.Just as critical is that you avoid drinking your calories. Replace sodas(including diet sodas —see the section on artificial sweeteners on page 214[chapter_9.xhtml#page_214]), fruit juices, and other sugary drinks with water.Drinking just one can of sweetened soda or fruit punch a day can result in aweight gain of up to five pounds in one year! No wonder so many Americans arealways on a diet.EAT SMALL AMOUNTS OF PROTEIN SEVERAL TIMES A DAYThink of protein the way you do medicine —that it should be taken in small doseswith every meal and snack. Protein helps to balance blood sugar levels, decreasecravings, and burn more calories than eating high-carb, sugar-filled foods.Protein also provides your body with the amino acids it requires. Nuts, seeds,legumes, some grains, and vegetables contain some of the 20 essential aminoacids you need. Fish, poultry, and most meats contain all of them. To the degreeyour budget allows, shop for animal protein that is free of hormones andantibiotics, free-range, and grass fed. It is more expensive than industrial,farm-raised animal protein, but it is a good investment in your health. Becareful not to overdo it on protein, as that can put an increased strain on yourkidneys and promote inflammation. Somewhere in the range of 15 to 25 percent ofyour total daily calories is a healthy amount.MAKE FRIENDS WITH FATFat continues to get a bad rap, despite the fact that good fats are essential tothe health of your brain and do not raise your cholesterol. In fact, low-fatdiets are bad for the brain. A Mayo Clinic study found that people who ateeither a fat-based or a protein-based diet had a 42 percent or a 21 percentlower risk, respectively, of developing mild cognitive impairment and dementia,but those who ate a diet based on simple carbohydrates (think bread, pasta,potatoes, rice, and sugar) had a 400 percent increased risk of developing theseconditions.[268] Fat is not the problem —sugar is.In a powerful new study from multiple highly regarded institutions around theworld, researchers followed more than 135,000 people from 18 countries for anaverage of 7.4 years. They found that those who consumed the highest amount ofdietary fat, including saturated fat, had a 23 percent reduced risk of death,while those who ate the highest amount of carbohydrates had a 28 percentincreased risk of death. Higher consumption of saturated fat was surprisinglyassociated with a lower risk of stroke. The researchers concluded, “Highcarbohydrate intake was associated with higher risk of total mortality, whereastotal fat and individual types of fat were related to lower total mortality.Total fat and types of fat were not associated with cardiovascular disease,myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease mortality.”[269]While it’s smart to avoid fried fats, trans fats, and some saturated fats,cutting way back on healthy fats is harmful, because your body needs them formany crucial functions. Here’s a brief look at how different kinds of fatsimpact health: * Unsaturated fats. These are good fats because they contribute to heart and brain health. There are two kinds of unsaturated fats: polyunsaturated and monounsaturated. Two important polyunsaturated fats are * Omega-3 fatty acids. EPA and DHA, two omega-3s, are crucial for optimal brain health and are found in cold-water fish, such as salmon, tuna, and sardines. Deficiencies in these fatty acids have been associated with cognitive decline, depression, and many other illnesses. Higher levels of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA have been associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and slower cognitive decline.[270] * Omega-6 fatty acids. These are also necessary for good health, but they can be harmful when eaten in excess. Omega-6 fatty acids are found in most vegetable oils (soybean, sunflower, safflower, corn, and canola), as well as many fried foods, cereals, whole-grain breads, and processed foods —all common in what we call the standard American diet. Most people who eat this diet have an unhealthy ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids —20 to 1 or higher —which is pro-inflammatory and increases the risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and a host of other health problems. The optimal omega-6 to omega-3 ratio in your blood is likely under 4 to 1. The best way to balance your omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is to eat fewer foods that contain omega-6s and more that contain omega-3 EPA and DHA. Certain plant foods, including flaxseeds and green leafy vegetables, contain alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid that some people can convert in small amounts to EPA/DHA. However, you can’t rely on it as your only source of omega-3s; taking fish-oil supplements can help ensure healthy levels. * Saturated fats. Saturated fats tend to be less healthy than unsaturated fats, but they differ depending on their chemical makeup. Short- to medium-chain saturated fats (those with 4–12 carbons) are healthier than longer-chain ones, according to cardiologist Mark Houston of Vanderbilt University.[271] Here are a few examples of potentially healthier and unhealthier saturated fats; check food labels for them: * Butyric (4-carbon) acid is found in fiber-rich foods (sweet potatoes, vegetables, beans, nuts, and fruit), butter, and ghee. * Caprylic (8-carbon), capric (10-carbon), and lauric (12-carbon) acids are medium-chain fatty acids found in coconut. * Myristic acid is a 14-carbon saturated fat found in most animal fats and some vegetable oils. There is some evidence that this fatty acid can be detrimental to heart health and should be consumed only in small amounts. * Palmitic acid is a 16-carbon, long-chain saturated fat that creates the marbling in corn-fed beef. It has a negative impact on cholesterol and heart health. * Stearic acid is an 18-carbon, long-chain fatty acid found in grain-fed meats, sausage, bacon, cold cuts, peanuts, peanut butter, margarines, fried potatoes, whole milk, cheeses, and vegetable oils (sunflower oil has the most). Chocolate is high in stearic acid but also high in antioxidants and flavonoids, which help to balance its health benefit.The healthiest dietary strategy is to cut back on certain types of saturatedfats (especially myristic, palmitic, and stearic acids) and increase consumptionof polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish oil, nuts, and seeds. * Trans fats. These synthetic fats are found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, and they have no place in anyone’s diet.[272] They decrease healthy blood flow and increase the likelihood of blood clots, which can cause strokes and heart disease. They are found in shortening and many processed foods, margarines, commercially prepared fried foods, and packaged baked goods, including donuts, crackers, and snack foods. When a packaged-food label reads “trans fat–free,” it may be a lie. Regulations do not require that trans fats be listed on a food label if the level is below the legal limit of 0.5 grams per serving. For many baked goods and pastries that are in excess of five ounces —a single pastry is often labeled as several servings, even though most people eat it as one serving —that can translate to two or three grams of trans fat. Even small amounts of these very unhealthy fats should be avoided. Fortunately, the FDA has banned trans fats in processed foods; the ban went into effect in June 2018 for the great majority of foods.CHOOSE HEALTHY (HIGH-FIBER, BLOOD-SUGAR-STEADYING) CARBOHYDRATESSo-called “smart” carbohydrates are essential to life because they are loadedwith nutrients, help to balance your blood sugar, and decrease cravings. Mostvegetables, legumes, and fruits, such as apples, pears, and berries, that arelow glycemic (unlikely to raise blood sugar) are smart carbs. High-glycemic,low-fiber carbohydrates steal your health because they promote inflammation,diabetes, and depression.[273] Examples include sugar and foods that quicklyturn to sugar, such as bread, rice, pasta, and white potatoes.Fiber is a special type of carbohydrate that enhances digestion, reduces therisk of colon cancer, and helps to balance blood pressure and blood sugar. Theaverage American consumes far too little —less than 15 grams of fiber daily.Women should consume 25–30 grams of fiber every day; men, 30–38 grams.High-fiber foods, such as broccoli, berries, onions, flaxseeds, nuts, greenbeans, cauliflower, celery, and sweet potatoes (the skin of one sweet potato hasmore fiber than a bowl of oatmeal!) have the added benefit of making you feelfull faster and longer.FILL YOUR PLATE WITH COLORFUL VEGETABLES AND FRUITSColorful vegetables and fruits have tremendous health benefits. They provide anenormous array of the plant nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants thatare necessary for good health. Plant foods also help prevent cancer and reduceinflammation, which contributes to Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease,arthritis, gastrointestinal disorders, high blood pressure, and many otherillnesses. A 2016 study found a linear correlation between the number of fruitsand vegetables you eat and your level of happiness.[274] The more colorfulfruits and vegetables you eat —up to eight servings a day —the happier youbecome, and it happens almost immediately. No antidepressant works this fast!Just stick with a two-to-one ratio of vegetables to fruits to limit sugar.ADD BRAIN-HEALTHY FLAVOR WITH HERBS AND SPICESFood seasonings contain so many health-promoting substances that it almost makessense to store them in the medicine cabinet rather than the spice cupboard! Hereare some of the most powerful of these herb and spice brain boosters. * Basil * Black pepper * Cayenne pepper * Cinnamon * Cloves * Garlic * Ginger * Marjoram * Mint * Nutmeg * Oregano * Parsley * Rosemary * Saffron * Sage * Thyme * Turmeric (curcumins)AVOID OR ELIMINATE FOODS THAT CAN POTENTIALLY HURT YOUSome foods are not worth the downsides that come along with them. The followingare several to limit or avoid altogether if you want to keep your brain healthy.If you struggle with mood issues, anxiety, temper problems, or learningchallenges, eliminate all of the foods listed for at least a month. Then, onceall of them are out of your system, add back one each week and see which, ifany, may be causing you trouble. This process may make an amazing difference inyour health. While I believe everyone would benefit from eliminating these foodspermanently, I know not everyone may choose to do that. Most people are willingto start with the elimination diet. When they see how much better they feel offthese foods, many will make permanent changes. * Sugar. Americans eat about 140 pounds of sugar a year. Refined sugar is 99.4 to 99.7 percent pure calories, with no vitamins or minerals —just carbohydrates. Sugar is addictive, interferes with the actions of calcium and magnesium, increases inflammation and erratic brain-cell firing, and has been implicated in aggression. Sugar consumption has been associated with brain fog, depression, ADHD, increased triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol, and lower “good” HDL cholesterol. In brain imaging studies, sugar increases slow brain waves (associated with memory problems), and a study at UCLA showed that sugar negatively alters learning and memory.[275] Avoid agave, too, because of its high fructose content. * Artificial sweeteners. Consuming sugar alternatives can contribute to chronically high insulin levels, which increases your risk for Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and other health problems. Artificial sweeteners do not help you lose weight. In fact, they may lower metabolism, leading to weight gain. Avoid aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal), saccharin (Sweet’N Low), and sucralose (Splenda). If you want something sweet, use small amounts of erythritol or stevia. * Gluten. This sticky substance is found in wheat, barley, rye, kamut, bulgur, and spelt, and in most commercially made breads, cakes, cookies, cereals, and pasta. It is also hidden in everything from salad dressings and sauces to processed foods and cosmetics. Gluten-related health issues are on the rise, including celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and Hashimoto’s thyroid disease —all of which are autoimmune conditions. Gluten can also trigger psychological disturbances, skin rashes, acne, inflammation, alopecia (baldness), arthritis, and food addiction. In one study, putting celiac patients on a gluten-free diet significantly decreased anxiety.[276] Gluten can also reduce brain blood flow.[277] There’s no healthy reason to eat it. * Soy. Soy (found in tofu, edamame, and soy sauce and also added to a huge range of foods) contains large amounts of omega-6 fatty acids, phytoestrogens (which may contribute to the development of cancer, early puberty in girls, and impotence in men), and phytic acid, which is thought to reduce the absorption of vital minerals. * Corn. Why do farmers feed animals corn, soy, and potatoes? To make them fat! Corn is high in omega-6s and very low in omega-3s, making it pro-inflammatory. Corn has been shown to damage the intestinal lining and create leaky gut. Most of the corn in the US is sprayed with the glyphosate pesticide Roundup, which has been associated with cancer, depression, Parkinson’s disease, MS, hypothyroidism, and liver disease.[278] * Dairy. Cow’s milk is perfect for calves but unnecessary for humans. After the age of two, fewer than 35 percent of humans produce the enzyme lactase, which is needed to break down lactose (milk sugar) and digest milk. Lactose is converted to galactose and glucose, which elevates blood sugar and can cause inflammation. Casein, one of the proteins in dairy, is an excitotoxin. Left unchecked, excitotoxins lead to brain inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. In several studies, a link has been suggested between milk drinking and Parkinson’s disease.[279] Most dairy cattle are given antibiotics and hormones, which can also end up in your body. Unsweetened almond milk is a good substitute for cow’s milk.CHOOSE ORGANIC, TOXIN-FREE FOODS WHENEVER POSSIBLEFast food, sugar, simple carbohydrates, dairy products, trans fats, excessomega-6 fatty acids, and foods that are processed, engineered, or refinedpromote chronic inflammation. These are the foods that the standard American orWestern diet is built upon. That’s why it’s so important, whenever possible, toshop for organically grown or raised foods, which are free of hormones,antibiotics, and chemicals. Try to eliminate food additives and artificialpreservatives, dyes, and sweeteners, too, and look for meat that is grass fed.Fish is a great source of healthy protein and fat, but some varieties tend tohave more toxins. The larger the fish, the more mercury it may contain, so it’sbest to eat mostly smaller varieties and have the larger ones (like tuna) lessfrequently. Eat a fairly wide variety of fish, preferably those highest inomega-3s, like wild Alaskan salmon, sardines, anchovies, hake, and haddock.Learn more at www.seafoodwatch.org [http://www.seafoodwatch.org].I understand that many people cannot afford to buy only organic and sustainablyraised food. That is why I recommend consulting the Environmental WorkingGroup’s annual lists of produce with the highest and lowest levels of pesticideresidues to help inform your choices. (Stay updated at www.ewg.org[http://www.ewg.org].)STRATEGY #3: TIME YOUR MEALS TO GET HEALTHIER.If you have symptoms of low blood sugar, getting your diet right can make animmediate positive difference for you. I had a patient who was arrested multipletimes for angry outbursts, but in my office, he was typically one of oursweetest patients. One day he came to see me, sweating profusely, and he wasangry and inappropriate with our office staff. Suspecting low blood sugar, Iordered a glucose tolerance test. We measured his blood glucose level atbaseline and again 30 minutes and two hours after he drank the equivalent ofsugar water. His two-hour blood glucose level was dangerously low. When thebrain does not get enough glucose, watch out!SYMPTOMS OF HYPOGLYCEMIA (LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE) * Feeling sleepy/drugged * Mental confusion * Inability to concentrate * Impaired memory * Dizziness, light-headedness * Nervousness * Depression * Irritability * Blurred vision * Overwhelming fatigue * Anxiety/panic attacks * Palpitations * Shaky hands * “Butterflies” in stomach * Flushing/sweating * Faintness/fainting * Head pressure * Frontal headache * Insomnia * Abdominal pain/diarrheaIf you suspect you suffer from low blood sugar levels, make a practice of eatingfour to five meals a day that combine protein, fat, and smart carbohydrates tohelp steady your blood sugar.If you do not have hypoglycemia, “intermittent fasting” or “time-restrictedfeeding” can significantly improve memory,[280] mood,[281] fat loss,[282]weight, blood pressure, and inflammatory markers.[283] Nightly 12-to-16-hourfasts turn on a process called autophagy, which helps your brain take out thetrash it accumulates during the day.[284] This can help you think more clearlyand feel more energetic, and it’s simple —if you eat dinner at 6 p.m., don’t eatagain until 6–10 a.m. the next day. Your brain will have the time it needs tocleanse itself.Not eating within two to three hours of bedtime also reduces your risk of heartattack and stroke.[285] In healthy people, blood pressure drops by at least 10percent when they go to sleep, but blood pressure in late-night eaters stayshigh, increasing the risk of vascular problems. Also, new research suggests thatif you have more calories at lunch and then eat a light dinner, you are morelikely to lose weight than the other way around.[286]STRATEGY #4: CHOOSE 20 FOODS YOU LOVE THAT LOVE YOU BACK.To be successful at optimizing your diet, you must find foods you love that loveyou back. As I detailed in chapter 4 (see page 69 [chapter_4.xhtml#page_69]), weare creatures of habit and change can be hard. That is why you have to setyourself up to win. Do this by finding 20 high-quality, delicious foods andbeverages, based on the rules outlined above. If you can find 20 foods, odds areyou will be able to find 40, 80, 100, or more. To give you a head start, here isa list of 162 of my favorite Feel Better Fast Brain-Healthy Foods and Beveragesthat comply with our food rules. Some of these items may be new to you, but youcan research them more online or ask your grocer where to find them.FEEL BETTER FAST BRAIN-HEALTHY FOODS AND BEVERAGESBeverages 1. 1. Water 2. 2.

Shirataki noodles (made from the root of a wild yam plant [brand: Miracle Noodles] to replace pasta noodles)I don’t know about you, but I’ve been in bad relationships in the past. I’m sothankful now that I have a partner and wife who is good for me and loves me inreturn for my love. Choosing healthy food is so much easier than finding theright life partner! I am committed to only eating and loving food that is goodfor me and loves me back.STRATEGY #5: KNOW WHICH FOODS TO LOSE AND WHICH TO CHOOSE TO HELP ATTENTION,ENERGY, MOOD, MEMORY, ANXIETY, PAIN, AND SLEEP.When you are feeling low, there are nutrients you should lose and others youshould choose that will help you feel better fast. Following the general “Foodsto Lose” list are diagrams and lists of food choices that will improve yourattention and energy, moods, memory, and sleep and will reduce anxiety and pain.FOODS TO LOSE: THESE MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD NOW BUT NOT LATER * Pro-inflammatory foods, such as fast food (pizza, donuts, French fries, ice cream), sugar, simple carbohydrates, refined grains, wheat flour, dairy products, and omega-6 fatty acids (found in grain-fed meats, corn, soybeans, and vegetable oils —corn, safflower, sunflower, soybean, canola, and cottonseed) * Trans fats —avoid anything with “partially hydrogenated” or “vegetable shortening” on the label * Processed meats —sodium nitrites can combine with amines to form nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic * Food additives, such as MSG and aspartame * Anything that disrupts the gut lining, such as gluten * Alcohol[289] * Aspartame[290] * Caffeine[291]WHY DO RESTAURANTS OFFER BREAD AND ALCOHOL BEFORE MEALS?It’s a great question. After all, restaurants could instead offer you cheese,almonds, or fresh-cut veggies with a little mashed avocado. The answer is thatbread and alcohol reduce the function of your prefrontal cortex (PFC) and makeyou both hungrier and more likely to order additional food and drinks. Withoutthe PFC supervising your decisions, you are apt to spend more money at therestaurant on alcohol and dessert.Bread —especially white bread made from bleached and processed flour —spikesblood sugar, which pushes tryptophan, the amino acid building block for theneurotransmitter serotonin, into the brain. Serotonin helps you feel happier andless anxious, which is why many people, especially females, fall in love withbread, cupcakes, cookies, and the like. One study showed that males producedabout 52 percent more serotonin than females, which makes females moresusceptible to depression.[292] On SPECT, I’ve seen antidepressants called SSRIs(selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which raise serotonin levels) lowerfunction in the PFC. Many of my patients who have taken SSRIs report that theyfeel less depressed, anxious, or worried, but they also tend to be moreimpulsive and less motivated. One of my patients, who owned a group ofrestaurants, told me that he had to stop taking Zoloft, a commonly prescribedSSRI, because although he was less depressed, he wasn’t getting his paperworkdone. He just wasn’t motivated or able to focus, which is bad if you own abusiness. Anything that lowers PFC function makes you more impulsive and lessworried about long-term consequences. Starting a meal with bread or simplecarbohydrates helps you feel better, but it also makes you more impulsive whenthe dessert tray comes by toward the end of the meal.Alcohol also reduces PFC function, making it more likely you will order extrafood, make a stupid comment, or do something you later regret. We’ve long heardthat alcohol in moderation can be healthy, but after looking at thousands ofbrains of moderate to heavy drinkers, I’ve just never believed it. A study atJohns Hopkins found that people who drink every day have smaller brains,[293]and when it comes to the brain, size does matter. Plus, alcohol is related toseven different types of cancer, including those involving the mouth, throat,esophagus, liver, colon, rectum, and breast.[294] Alcohol is used to clean yourskin of bacteria before you receive an injection and as a preservative forscientific specimens. It’s hard to imagine that it can be good for the 100trillion bugs living in your gut that are essential to your life.That’s not all. Alcohol can decrease judgment and decision-making skills,increase cravings, and make you less coordinated. Excessive alcohol is relatedto high blood pressure, stroke, irregular heartbeat, heart disease, and a weakerimmune system. According to a recent study, heavy drinking and alcohol usedisorders are the biggest preventable risk factors for dementia, especiallyearly-onset dementia, which starts before age 65.[295] To detoxify alcohol, yourliver uses glutathione and other essential antioxidants. This can make you morevulnerable to the buildup of toxins. Alcohol intake is associated with a fattyliver, damaged neurons, and decreased blood flow to the cerebellum, an amazingpart of the brain that is associated with physical and thought coordination.Alcohol interferes with the absorption of vitamin B1 and is a common cause ofnerve pain. It is listed as the seventh leading preventable cause of death, andexcessive use can cause untold suffering, divorce, incarceration, and financialproblems. For people who want a better brain but also want to drink, I recommendno more than two to four standard-size drinks a week —not a day.Hold the bread and alcohol, wait for your meal, and you will be happier with theend result.FOODS TO CHOOSE: THESE MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD NOW AND LATERTo Boost Attention/Energy: A higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate diet, especiallyconsumed around the times you need to focus, can be helpful. Consider thisdiagram:Diagram showing the progression of effects of a protein-dominant meal. Youconsume a protein-rich meal (think steak and seafood). It raises blood levels ofall amino acids. All amino acids compete to enter the brain. Tryptophan(building block for serotonin) loses; tyrosine (building block for dopamine)wins. You feel more energetic and focused but may also be more worried andrigid. [images/Illustration-9.1.jpg] * Dopamine-rich foods —for focus and motivation: turmeric,[296] green tea (for theanine),[297] lentils, fish, lamb, chicken, turkey, beef, eggs, nuts and seeds (pumpkin and sesame), high-protein veggies (such as broccoli and spinach), and protein powders * Beets —increase blood flow to the brain * Celery[298] * Flavonoid-containing foods —blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, cocoa[299] * Green tea[300] * Green leafy vegetables * Omega-3-rich foods —flaxseeds, walnuts, salmon, sardines, beef, shrimp, walnut oil, chia seeds, avocados, and avocado oil * Spices —peppermint,[301] cinnamon,[302] and rosemary * WaterTo Boost Mood: Foods that raise serotonin can be helpful. Consider this diagram:Diagram showing the progression of effects of a carbohydrate-dominant meal. Youconsume a carbohydrate-rich meal (e.g., pears, sweet potatoes, quinoa, zucchini,black beans). The pancreas releases insulin. All amino acid blood levels, excepttryptophan, drop as they enter muscles. Tryptophan enters the brain and isconverted to serotonin; dopamine levels become lower. You feel happier and lessworried but may also feel unfocused and less motivated.[images/Illustration-9.2.jpg] * Serotonin-rich foods —combine tryptophan-containing foods, such as eggs, turkey, seafood, chickpeas, nuts, and seeds (building block for serotonin), with healthy carbohydrates, such as sweet potatoes and quinoa, to elicit a short-term insulin response that drives tryptophan into the brain. Dark chocolate[303] also increases serotonin. * Limit simple carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta, potatoes, and rice, as they may help you feel good in the short run but increase inflammation and illness in the long run. * Prebiotic-rich foods —see “Feel Better Fast Brain-Healthy Foods and Beverages,” on page 219 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_219]. * Probiotic-rich foods[304] —see “Feel Better Fast Brain-Healthy Foods and Beverages,” on page 220 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_220]. * Spices —saffron,[305] turmeric (curcumins),[306] and saffron plus curcumins[307] * Fruits and vegetables —eat up to eight servings a day[308] to feel happier. * Maca —this root vegetable and medicinal plant, native to Peru, has been shown to reduce depression.[309] * Omega-3-rich foods —see “To Boost Attention/Energy” on page 224 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_224].To Boost Memory: The Western, pro-inflammatory diet is associated with a smallerhippocampus and cognitive impairment.[310] A new way of eating for Americans isessential if we want to keep our brains healthy. Consider this diagram:Diagram showing the progression of effects of a choline-rich meal. You consumecholine sources (eggs, shrimp, scallops, etc.). Blood choline levels increase.Brain choline increases and brain makes acetylcholine. Your thinking and memoryimprove. [images/Illustration-9.3.jpg] * Antioxidant-rich foods —acai fruit, parsley, cocoa powder, raspberries, walnuts, blueberries, artichokes, cranberries, kidney beans, blackberries, pomegranates, chocolate, olive and hemp oils (not for cooking at high temperatures), dandelion greens, and green tea * Chocolate (cocoa flavonols)[311] * Choline-rich foods —to support acetylcholine and memory:[312] shrimp, eggs, tofu, scallops, chicken, turkey, beef, cod, salmon, shiitake mushrooms, chickpeas, lentils, and collard greens * Omega-3-rich foods —see “To Boost Attention/Energy” on page 224 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_224].To Reduce Anxiety: Low blood sugar states are often associated with anxiety.Being “hangry” (irritable from extended periods without eating) and beinganxious often go together. * Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)–rich foods —for antianxiety: broccoli, almonds, walnuts, lentils, bananas, beef liver, brown rice, halibut, gluten-free whole oats, oranges, rice bran, and spinach * Green tea, which contains L-theanine, an ingredient that helps you feel happier, more relaxed, and more focused[313] * Magnesium-rich foods —pumpkin and sunflower seeds, almonds, spinach, Swiss chard, sesame seeds, beet greens, summer squash, quinoa, black beans, and cashews * Omega-3-rich foods[314] —see “To Boost Attention/Energy” on page 224 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_224]. * Probiotic-rich foods —see “To Boost Mood” on page 225 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_225].To Reduce Pain: * Omega-3-rich foods —see “To Boost Attention/Energy” on page 224 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_224]. * Serotonin-rich foods —see “To Boost Mood” on page 225 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_225].To Boost Sleep: * Magnesium-rich foods —see “To Reduce Anxiety” on page 226 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_226]. * Serotonin-rich foods —see “To Boost Mood” on page 225 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_225].THE FEEL BETTER FAST DIET: FIVE SIMPLE STRATEGIES 1. Give yourself an attitude makeover. 2. Learn the Feel Better Fast food rules: * Concentrate on consuming brain-smart calories. * Make (zero-calorie) water your beverage of choice. * Eat small amounts of protein several times a day. * Make friends with fat. * Choose healthy (high-fiber, blood-sugar-steadying) carbohydrates. * Fill your plate with colorful vegetables and fruits. * Add brain-healthy flavor with herbs and spices. * Avoid or eliminate foods that can potentially hurt you: sugar, artificial sweeteners, gluten, soy, corn, and dairy. * Choose organic, toxin-free foods whenever possible. 3. Time your meals to get healthier. 4. Choose 20 foods you love that love you back. 5. Know which foods to lose and which to choose to help attention, energy, mood, memory, anxiety, pain, and sleep.TINY HABITS THAT CAN HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FAST—AND LEAD TO BIG CHANGES10 seconds to 15 minutes. [images/x10-sec-15-min.jpg]Each of these habits takes just a few minutes. They are anchored to somethingyou do (or think or feel) so that they are more likely to become automatic. Onceyou do the behaviors you want, find a way to make yourself feel good aboutthem—draw a happy face, pump your fist, or do whatever feels natural. Emotionhelps the brain to remember. 1. When I am tempted by French fries, sugary treats, or soda, I will resist and say to myself, “I only love foods that love me back.” 2. Before I leave the house, I will put a full water bottle inside my purse or computer bag. 3. When I prepare my food shopping list, I will include fish and vegetables. 4. When I finish dinner, I will note the time and make plans to eat my next meal at least 12 hours later to give my brain time for waste removal. 5. When I pick up a new item at the grocery store, I will read the food label. 6. When I’m in a low mood, I will eat a piece of low-sugar or sugar-free dark chocolate to boost my serotonin level. 7. When I eat a food I love that loves me back, I will note it down in my “favorite healthy foods” list. 8. When the waiter comes for my order at a restaurant, I will say, “Please don’t bring bread to the table.” Making that one decision will help me make healthier choices throughout the meal. 9. When I go food shopping, I will look for organic fruits and vegetables first.[251] L. M.

However, because people live in a fast-paced societywhere they pick up food on the fly, skip meals, eat sugar-laden treats, buyprocessed foods, and eat foods that have been chemically treated, most peoplecould use a little help from a multiple vitamin/mineral supplement.MARK HYMAN, MD, AS QUOTED IN THE BRAIN WARRIOR’S WAY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------When I’m treating people, one question I always ask myself is What would Iprescribe if this were my mother, my wife, or my child? More and more, after 35years as a psychiatrist, I find myself recommending natural treatments. I am notopposed to medications and I have prescribed them for a long time, but I wantyou to use all of the tools available, especially if they are effective, lessexpensive, and have fewer side effects than medications.My interest in nutraceuticals started after I began using brain SPECT imaging tohelp understand and treat my patients. One of the early lessons SPECT taught mewas that some medications, especially those often prescribed for anxiety andpain, had a negative effect we could see on the scans. Later I learned someresearch suggested that a number of these medications increased the risk ofdementia and strokes.[315] In medical school I was taught, “First, do no harm.Use the least toxic, most effective treatments.” As I looked for alternatives tothese treatments to help the children and adults I was serving, I discoveredthat many natural supplements had strong scientific evidence behind them, withfewer side effects than prescription medications.JENNIFER: MEDS MADE HER WORSEOne of the cases that got me interested in natural treatments involved my ownniece. When Jennifer was seven, my sister brought her to see me for problemswith moodiness and temper. I tried a number of medications for her without anysuccess. My sister was calling me upset three times a week, and I kept usingstronger and stronger medicines. But medications are not without risks and sideeffects, and when my niece started to gain weight, I took her off all of themand decided to try her on a group of natural supplements I had heard about froma colleague.One day about four months later, I realized I hadn’t heard anything from mysister in a long time. I called her and said, “Hey, don’t you love me anymore?How’s my niece?”She said, “Danny, you cannot believe the difference in her. She is so muchbetter. She is calmer, more compliant, and she is getting straight As in school.Of course I love you.” The supplements have had long-term benefits for herwithout any side effects. Last year Jennifer graduated from law school.WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT NUTRACEUTICALSSupplements with medicine-like health benefits. That’s a simple way to think ofnutraceuticals, a term that’s a combination of the words nutrient andpharmaceutical. Many of these natural products have been studied extensively andfound to be effective. Other advantages: They can be less expensive than drugs,and insurance companies don’t need to be informed that you have taken them. Thislast point is key, since taking prescription medications may affect yourinsurability. I know many people who have been denied coverage or made to payhigher rates for health, life, disability, and long-term-care insurance becausethey have taken certain medications. If there are effective naturalalternatives, it is worth considering them.At Amen Clinics we have had success using combinations of nutraceuticals onpatients with very damaged brains. In 2009, we started the world’s first andlargest brain imaging study on active and retired NFL players. Many of themcomplained of problems with memory, mood, and focus and scored very poorly onthe cognitive tests we gave them. As a group, their SPECT scans looked awful.For the treatment arm of the study, we used brain health education and targetedsupplements, including a multivitamin/mineral complex, high-dose omega-3 fattyacids, ginkgo and vinpocetine for blood flow support, acetyl-L-carnitine forenergy support, alpha-lipoic acid as an antioxidant and for blood sugar support,N-acetylcysteine as an antioxidant, huperzine A to support acetylcholine andmemory, and phosphatidylserine for memory support. Our protocol demonstratedincreased blood flow to multiple brain areas, including the prefrontal cortexand hippocampus, and improvements in memory, attention, and processingspeed.[316]BEFORE: 12 YEARS IN THE NFLSurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-10.1.jpg]Severe overall decreased blood flowAFTER 6 MONTHS ON NUTRACEUTICALSSurface SPECT scan showing uniform blood flow. [images/Illustration-10.2.jpg]Marked overall improvementNutraceuticals do have drawbacks. Although they tend to be less expensive thanmedications, you may pay more for them because insurance usually doesn’t covertheir cost. What’s more, they are not completely without side effects, and theycan interact with medications. “Natural” is not synonymous with “harmless”; bothmercury and asbestos are natural, but both are dangerous to your health. St.John’s wort, one of my favorite natural antidepressants, can cause sunsensitivity, and it can also decrease the effectiveness of a number ofmedications, including birth control pills. (Just imagine: St. John’s wort haslifted your depression, but you also discover you are pregnant. You may notthink this is the best timing.)Quality control is an ongoing issue. Studies have shown that supplements don’talways contain what the label claims, which means they may not work or,alternatively, could be harmful. Don’t rely on the expertise of a health foodstore clerk for your supplement information. Instead, research brands online anddevelop a relationship with one or more, communicating your questions and issuesto their technical and quality control staff.Notwithstanding these issues, the benefits of nutraceuticals (and theirrelatively low risks compared to medications) make them worth considering,especially if you can get thoughtful, research-based information. I havewitnessed targeted nutraceuticals make a positive difference in the lives of mypatients, my family, and myself, which is why I take them every day andrecommend them.THREE NUTRACEUTICALS EVERYONE SHOULD TAKEI typically recommend three nutraceuticals to all of my patients because theyare critical to optimal brain function: a multivitamin/mineral, omega-3 fattyacids, and vitamin D.1. A MULTIVITAMIN/MINERALTo feel better fast now and later, you need to give your brain the nutrition itrequires. But there is evidence that many people are not getting it: More than90 percent of Americans do not eat at least five servings of fruits andvegetables a day, the minimum required to get the nutrients you need, accordingto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[317] An editorial inthe Journal of the American Medical Association also asserted that most adultsdon’t get all the vitamins they need through diet alone and recommended a dailyvitamin supplement for everyone because it helps prevent chronic illness.[318]In the past 15 years, there have been more than 25 reports of mental healthbenefits from multivitamin/mineral formulas consisting of more than 20 mineralsand vitamins.[319] In addition, studies show that multivitamin/mineral complexescan help with attentional issues,[320] mood,[321] and even aggression.[322] Tworandomized, controlled trials were conducted after the 6.3-magnitudeearthquake in February 2011 in Christchurch, New Zealand,[323] and thedevastating flooding in southern Alberta, Canada, in June 2013.[324] Both trialsshowed reduced acute stress and anxiety scores in those taking amultivitamin/mineral. In the New Zealand earthquake study, the incidence ofposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) decreased from 65 percent to 19 percentafter one month of treatment, while the control group showed little improvement.These two trials suggest that multivitamin/mineral complexes could be aninexpensive public health intervention for normal populations following naturaldisasters.A 2010 study tested the effects of taking a multivitamin versus a placebo on 215men ages 30 to 55. After a month, the multivitamin group reported improved moodsand showed better mental performance, as well as having a greater sense ofvigor, less stress, and less mental fatigue after completing mentaltasks —essentially making them both happier and smarter.[325] Anotherplacebo-controlled study looked at the effects of multivitamins on 81 healthychildren and found that those who took multivitamins performed better on two outof three attention tasks.[326]2. OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDSOmega-3 fatty acids are essential to well-being, as we touched on in chapter 9.Low levels are one of the leading preventable causes of death, according toresearchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.[327] Studies have shown that95 percent of Americans do not get enough dietary omega-3 fatty acids. Lowlevels of EPA and DHA, two of the most important omega-3s, are associated with * Inflammation[328] * Heart disease[329] * Depression and bipolar disorder[330] * Suicidal behavior[331] * ADHD[332] * Cognitive impairment and dementia[333] * Obesity[334]Unfortunately, most people are low in EPA and DHA unless they are focused oneating fish (which can be high in mercury and other toxins) or they are takingan omega-3 supplement. We tested the omega-3 fatty acid levels of 50 consecutivepatients not taking fish oil (the most commonly used source of EPA and DHA) whocame into Amen Clinics and found that 49 had suboptimal levels. In anotherstudy, our research team correlated the SPECT scans of 166 patients with theirEPA and DHA levels and found that those with the lowest levels had lower bloodflow, the number one predictor of future brain problems, in the righthippocampus and posterior cingulate (one of the first areas to die inAlzheimer’s disease), among other areas.[335] On cognitive testing, we alsofound low omega-3s correlated with decreased scores in mood. Most adults shouldtake between 1,000 and 2,000 milligrams of high-quality fish oil per day,balanced between EPA and DHA.ARE YOUR MEDICATIONS DEPLETING YOUR NUTRIENTS?Many medications can cause nutrient depletions. While you shouldn’t stop takingnecessary medicines without checking with your doctor, it is important to beaware of potential nutritional pitfalls so you can replace vital nutrients. Some(or all) of the following types of medications may cause problems: * Antacids: Decrease stomach acid, calcium, phosphorus, folic acid, and potassium. Also can contribute to dysbiosis, or small bowel overgrowth of unhealthy bacteria, which can cause vitamin K deficiency and low mineral absorption * Antibiotics: Decrease vitamins B and K * Antidiabetics: Decrease coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and vitamin B12 * Antihypertensive medications: Decrease vitamins B6 and K, CoQ10, magnesium, and zinc * Anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs): Decrease vitamins B6, C, D, and K, folic acid, calcium, zinc, and iron * Cholesterol-lowering medications (especially statins): Decrease CoQ10, omega-3 fatty acids, and carnitine * Female hormones: Decrease folic acid, magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin C, zinc, selenium, and CoQ10 * Oral contraceptives: Decrease B vitamins, magnesium, folic acid, selenium, zinc, tyrosine, and serotonin. Roughly 16 to 52 percent of women taking oral contraceptives experience depression. Antidepressants are typically the first-line treatment; nutritional deficiencies are rarely considered. A recent study found that oral contraceptives can double the risk of suicide in teenage girls and significantly increase the risk in adult women.[336]3. VITAMIN D: OPTIMIZE YOUR LEVELIts best-known roles may be in building bones and boosting the immune system,but vitamin D is also an essential vitamin for brain health, mood, and memory.Low levels have been associated with depression, autism, psychosis, Alzheimer’sdisease, multiple sclerosis, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity.Seventy percent of the population is low in vitamin D because we are spendingmore time indoors and using more sunscreen (the vitamin is absorbed through theskin). It is easy to remedy a low level; get a blood test to check it, and if itis low (below 30 ng/mL), take between 2,000 and 10,000 IU a day. Recheck aftertwo months to make sure your level is in the healthy range.30 seconds. [images/x30-sec.jpg]Take a daily multivitamin/mineral complex, 1,000–2,000 mg of fish oil balancedbetween EPA and DHA, and, if needed, vitamin D.SUPPORT FOR YOUR MEMORYChapter 2 contains a discussion of the 11 risk factors that steal brain cellsand contribute to memory loss, which I wrote about in my recent book, MemoryRescue. The risk factors are summarized in the words BRIGHT MINDS; each letterstands for one of the risks, from blood flow to toxins, mental health problemsto sleep issues. Memory Rescue provides dozens of strategies to address eachrisk factor so that you can prevent cognitive impairment or get your memory back(see pages 38–44 [chapter_2.xhtml#page_38] for more). One of the strategies isto take specific nutraceuticals that address your BRIGHT MINDS issues. Here aresome of those recommendations. * Blood flow: ginkgo biloba, vinpocetine, green tea catechins, cocoa flavonols, resveratrol * Retirement/Aging: phosphatidylserine, acetyl-L-carnitine, huperzine A * Inflammation: omega-3 fatty acids, curcumins,[337] probiotics * Genetics: curcumins, resveratrol, blueberry extract, green tea extract, vitamin D * Head trauma support: omega-3 fatty acids * Toxins: n-acetylcysteine, vitamin C, magnesium, pre- and probiotics * Mental health: omega-3 fatty acids; also see the brain types, below * Immunity/infections: vitamins C and D, aged garlic, Lion’s mane mushrooms, zinc * Neurohormone deficiencies: zinc (testosterone), l-tyrosine (thyroid), DHEA, probiotics, ashwagandha (cortisol) * Diabesity: chromium picolinate, berberine, cinnamon, alpha-lipoic acid * Sleep: melatonin, magnesium, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) (if a worrier)KNOW YOUR BRAIN TYPE AND SUPPORT IT WITH SUPPLEMENTSNot all brains, even healthy ones, are the same. That’s a key lesson we havelearned from our brain imaging work at Amen Clinics. When we first started to doSPECT scans in 1991, we were looking for the one pattern that was associatedwith anxiety, depression, addictions, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsivedisorder, autism, or ADD/ADHD. But we soon discovered that no single brainpattern was associated with these illnesses; each one has multiple types thatrequire their own unique treatments. It made sense that there would never bejust one pattern for depression, for example, as not all depressed people arethe same. Some are withdrawn, others are angry, and still others are anxious orobsessive. Taking a one-size-fits-all approach invites failure and frustration.Another lesson we learned is that symptom-guided treatment is often ineffectiveand harmful.The scans helped us understand the type of anxiety, depression, ADHD, obesity,or addiction a person had, so we could better target treatment to individualbrains. This one idea led to a dramatic breakthrough in our own personaleffectiveness with patients, and it opened up a new world of understanding andhope for the tens of thousands of people who have come to see us and themillions of people who have read our books or seen our shows. In previouslypublished books, I’ve written about seven types of ADHD, seven types of anxietyand depression, six types of addictions, and five types of overeaters.Understanding these types is critical to getting the right help. Here is asummary of five of the common brain types, along with recommended supplementsfor each one.BRAIN TYPE 1: BALANCEDPeople with this brain type tend to have healthy brains overall and be * Focused * Flexible * Positive * RelaxedThe SPECT scans of a balanced brain show full, even, symmetrical activity withno holes. The basic supplements just mentioned are the foundation for this type.HEALTHY BRAIN SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing uniform blood flow. [images/Illustration-10.3.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityBRAIN TYPE 2: SPONTANEOUSPeople with this brain type tend to be * Spontaneous * Risk-taking * Creative, “out-of-the-box” thinkers * Restless * Easily distracted * Unable to focus unless they are interestedThe SPECT scans of this type typically show lower activity in the front of thebrain in the PFC. The PFC functions as the brain’s brake (see chapter 3, page 53[chapter_3.xhtml#page_53]). It is the little voice in our heads that helps usdecide between the banana and the banana split. The PFC stops us from saying ordoing things that are not in our best interest, but it can also stop creative,out-of-the-box thinking. The Spontaneous Brain Type tends to be associated withlower dopamine levels in the brain and may cause people to be more restless,take more risks, and struggle to stay focused on something unless they are veryinterested in it. Our research team has published several studies showing thatwhen people with this brain type try to concentrate, they actually have lessactivity in the PFC, which causes them to need excitement or stimulation inorder to focus (think of firefighters and race car drivers).[338] Smokers andheavy coffee drinkers also tend to fit this type, as they use these substancesto turn their brains on.SPONTANEOUS BRAIN TYPESurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-10.4.jpg]Low PFC activity at the front of the brainAny supplement or medicine that calms the brain, such as 5-HTP or SSRIs(selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), may make the Spontaneous Brain Typeworse, as it will lower the already low PFC function, which can then take thebrakes off your behavior. We have treated many people who had done things theylater regretted, such as becoming hypersexual or spending money they did nothave, when they were put on SSRIs. It turned out they had low activity in thePFC, and the serotonin-boosting medications diminished their judgment.This brain type is best optimized by boosting dopamine levels to strengthen thePFC. Higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate diets tend to help, as do physicalexercise and certain stimulating supplements, such as rhodiola, green teaextract, L-theanine, ashwagandha, panax ginseng, ginkgo biloba, andphosphatidylserine. Try them in the order listed here for a few days each to seewhich work best for you. If one or more overstimulates or upsets you, stoptaking it and move on to the next in the list. * Rhodiola, an herb that is grown at high altitudes in Asia and Europe, has been traditionally used to fight fatigue, improve memory, and increase attention span. It is called an adaptogen because it helps the body adapt to stress and assists in bringing our body processes back to normal. In an Amen Clinics study we conducted with scientist Mahtab Jafari, PhD, from the University of California, Irvine, we found that rhodiola helped to increase blood flow to the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex. Our study group also reported better mood and energy. Look for Rhodiola rosea root standardized to contain 3 percent rosavins and a minimum of one percent salidrosides. The typical adult dose is 170–200 mg twice a day. * Green tea extract is made from the dried leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub. It has been used to improve focus; as a remedy for many ailments, including anxiety; and to assist with weight loss. The green tea component epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a potent free-radical scavenger. The typical daily adult dose is 200–300 mg. Up to three cups of green tea can be consumed daily instead of a supplement, but pregnant women should use caution as green tea contains caffeine. * L-theanine is an amino acid uniquely found in green tea. It crosses the blood brain barrier and can increase dopamine. It also increases GABA and serotonin, so it tends to have a balancing effect on the brain. It helps with focus as well as mental and physical stress. The typical dose is 100–200 mg two to three times a day. * Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera, Indian ginseng, Indian winter cherry) is a shrub found in India, Nepal, and Pakistan that is commonly used to help focus and relaxation. The plant itself is an adaptogen, with properties that enable the body to better handle stress, anxiety, and fatigue. It helps to rejuvenate and energize the nervous system and increase physical endurance. It also has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiaging effects. It is well tolerated; few adverse effects have been reported. Those who take medications for thyroid issues, hypertension, or diabetes should exercise caution, as ashwagandha may stimulate thyroid function, cause a decrease in blood pressure, or lower blood sugar. The recommended dose is 125 mg twice a day. * Panax ginseng is a plant with fleshy roots that typically grows in cooler climates, including the northern regions of eastern Asia, Korea, and Russia. Ginseng is most widely known as a stimulant that promotes energy, improves circulation, and increases blood supply. For these reasons it has been used to improve cognitive and physical performance during endurance exercise. The typical adult dose is 200 mg twice a day. * Ginkgo biloba is a powerful nutraceutical from the Chinese ginkgo tree that enhances circulation, memory, and concentration. The most studied form of ginkgo biloba is an extract called EGb 761, which has been studied in blood-vessel disease, clotting disorders, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. In a 2003 double-blind, placebo-controlled study using SPECT, Brazilian researchers studied 48 men between the ages of 60 and 70 for eight months and found significant improvements in blood flow and global cognitive functioning among those taking gingko. The placebo group showed the opposite, with decreased brain blood flow and poorer scores on cognitive testing.[339] Consider taking ginkgo if you suffer from low energy or have trouble concentrating. There is a small risk of internal bleeding, so if you are taking any other blood-thinning agents, the dosages may need to be reduced. The typical adult dose is 60–120 mg twice daily. * Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a naturally occurring nutrient found in foods such as fish, green leafy vegetables, soy products, and rice. PS is a component of cell membranes, which change in composition as we age. It is essential to brain health, as it maintains neurons and neuronal networks so that the brain can continue to form and retain memories. Reportedly, taking PS may help improve age-related declines in memory, learning, verbal skills, and concentration. Research done with positron emission tomography (PET) studies, similar to SPECT, on patients who have taken PS show that it produces a general increase in metabolic activity in the brain.[340] The typical adult dose is 100–300 mg a day.BRAIN TYPE 3: PERSISTENTPeople with this brain type tend to * Be persistent * Be relentless or strong-willed * Like things a certain way * Get “stuck” on thoughts * Hold on to hurts * See what is wrong in themselves or othersTake-charge people who won’t take no for an answer are likely to have this braintype. They tend to be tenacious and stubborn. In addition, they may worry, havetrouble sleeping, be argumentative and oppositional, and hold grudges from thepast. The Persistent Brain Type often has increased activity in the front partof the brain, in an area called the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) —what I havedescribed previously as the brain’s gear shifter. It helps people go fromthought to thought or move from action to action, and it is involved with beingmentally flexible and going with the flow. When the ACG is overactive, usuallydue to low levels of serotonin, people can have problems shifting attention,which can make them persist —even when it may not be a good idea for them to doso. Caffeine and diet pills tend to make this brain type worse because theystimulate brains that do not need more stimulation. Indeed, people who have aPersistent Brain Type may feel as though they need a glass of wine at night, ortwo or three, to calm their worries.NORMAL “ACTIVE” BRAIN SPECT SCANActive SPECT scan showing greater activity in the cerebellum.[images/Illustration-2.1.jpg]Most active areas in the cerebellum at the back of the brainPERSISTENT BRAIN TYPEActive SPECT scan showing greater activity in scattered areas, including awedge-shaped area in the center of the front of the brain.[images/Illustration-10.6.jpg]High ACG activity at the front of the brainHigh-glycemic carbohydrates like bread, pasta, and sweets turn to sugar quicklyand increase serotonin, which is calming to the brain. That’s why PersistentBrain Types can become addicted to these simple carbohydrates. They often usecarbs as “mood foods” to self-medicate an underlying mood issue. It is best toavoid these quick fixes because they can cause long-term health problems. (Seechapter 9, “To Boost Mood,” page 225 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_225], for healthyfood choices that will drive serotonin into the brain.) Instead, use physicalexercise to boost serotonin, and consider taking supplements such asL-tryptophan, 5-HTP, and saffron. * L-tryptophan is a naturally occurring amino acid and building block for serotonin that is particularly abundant in milk, meat, and eggs. With my patients, I have found that it helps to decrease stress[341] and aggressiveness;[342] improve sleep, cognitive flexibility, and mood;[343] and foster a positive mind-set in females.[344] One of the problems with dietary L-tryptophan is that a significant portion of it does not enter the brain. Instead, much of what we consume is used to make proteins and vitamin B3. This necessitates taking large amounts of L-tryptophan —I recommend a dose of 1,000–3,000 mg a day for adults. Take it on an empty stomach because other amino acids in proteins can block its absorption and its entry into the brain. * 5-HTP, another amino acid, is a step further along in the serotonin production pathway. It is more widely available than L-tryptophan and more easily taken up in the brain —70 percent versus 3 percent of L-tryptophan. About 5 to 10 times more powerful than L-tryptophan, 5-HTP boosts serotonin levels in the brain and helps to calm ACG hyperactivity (greasing the cingulate, if you will, to improve shifting one’s attention). A number of double-blind studies have shown that it is also an effective mood enhancer[345] and appetite suppressor.[346] The recommended adult dose of 5-HTP is 50–300 mg a day. Children should start with a half dose. As with L-tryptophan, it is best to take 5-HTP on an empty stomach to help with absorption. The most common side effect is an upset stomach, which is usually very mild. Start with a low dose and work your way up slowly. * Saffron, one of the world’s most expensive spices, is grown mostly in Iran, Greece, Spain, and Italy and traditionally has been consumed to help digest spicy food and soothe an irritated stomach. It also has been used for hundreds of years as a folk medicine for a variety of health problems. In recent years there has been significant research showing that saffron can help boost serotonin and benefit mood,[347] memory,[348] and sexual function;[349] decrease the symptoms of PMS;[350] and, when combined with methadone, help alleviate withdrawal symptoms in patients undergoing treatment for opioid addiction.[351] The recommended adult dosage is 15 mg twice a day.BRAIN TYPE 4: SENSITIVEPeople with this brain type tend to * Be sensitive * Feel deeply * Be empathic * Struggle with moods * Be more pessimistic * Struggle with negative thoughtsThe SPECT scans of the Sensitive Brain Type tend to show increased activity inthe limbic or emotional centers of the brain, making these people empathic anddeeply feeling but also subject to issues with their moods. They may alsostruggle with being more pessimistic and having negative thoughts.NORMAL “ACTIVE” BRAIN SPECT SCANActive SPECT scan showing greater activity in the cerebellum.[images/Illustration-2.1.jpg]Most active areas in the cerebellum at the back of the brainSENSITIVE BRAIN TYPEActive SPECT scan showing greater activity in the cerebellum and extendingtoward the higher middle area of the brain. An arrow points to this area.[images/Illustration-10.8.jpg]High deep limbic activity (arrow)Exercise, omega-3 fatty acids (1,000–2,000 mg a day), vitamin D, and anutraceutical known as s-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe) may help the Sensitive BrainType. If someone with this type is also a Persistent Brain Type (yes, it’spossible to be a combination of types), the supplements or medications thatboost serotonin may help the most. * SAMe is crucial for the production of several neurotransmitters (dopamine, epinephrine, and serotonin)[352] and in gene regulation, and it has additional, very important actions that allow the brain to function properly. The brain normally manufactures all the SAMe it needs from the amino acid methionine. When someone is depressed, the synthesis of SAMe from methionine is impaired; taking SAMe has been shown to have antidepressant qualities. A 2017 comprehensive review by the American Psychiatric Association Council on Research Work Group found SAMe a promising treatment for depression.[353] SAMe has also been found to reduce joint inflammation and pain. People who have a tendency toward bipolar disorder should check with their doctor before trying this supplement. The typical adult dose is 200–400 mg two to four times a day. Usually it is best taken early in the day as it may be more stimulating for some. SAMe has been found to enhance mood more effectively if taken with 250 or 375 mg a day of trimethylglycine (TMG, betaine).[354]BRAIN TYPE 5: CAUTIOUSPeople with this brain type tend to be * Cautious * Prepared * Motivated * Reserved * Busy-minded * RestlessOn SPECT images, we often see heightened activity in the anxiety centers of thebrain, such as the basal ganglia, insular cortex, or amygdala. Theneurotransmitter GABA helps calm overfiring in the brain, and low levels of GABAfrequently cause people with this brain type to struggle more with anxiety andsubsequently be more cautious and reserved. On the flip side, they also tend tobe more prepared.NORMAL “ACTIVE” BRAIN SPECT SCANActive SPECT scan showing greater activity in the cerebellum.[images/Illustration-2.1.jpg]Most active areas in the cerebellum at the back of the brainCAUTIOUS BRAIN TYPEActive SPECT scan showing greater activity in scattered areas. An arrow pointsto an active area in each half of the brain toward the bottom front region.[images/Illustration-10.10.jpg]High basal ganglia activity (arrows)Meditation and hypnosis can help soothe this brain type (see chapter 1, pages11–20 [chapter_1.xhtml#page_11]), as can a combination of vitamin B6 (25 mg);magnesium glycinate, magnesium malate, or magnesium citrate (the forms ofmagnesium that are best absorbed by the body; take 150–300 mg two to three timesa day); and GABA, the calming neurotransmitter (250–750 mg two to three times aday).It is common to have more than one brain type, and when we look at all of thepotential combinations, it adds up to 16 types, such asSpontaneous-Persistent-Sensitive or Sensitive-Cautious. Many years ago werealized that not everyone can come to one of our clinics to get scanned, sobased on thousands of scans, we’ve developed a questionnaire that helps predictwhat yours might look like. The questionnaire is not as effective as actuallylooking at the brain, but it is still helpful and used by thousands of medicaland mental health professionals around the world.5 to 6 minutes. [images/x05-06-min.jpg]You can find out your brain type as part of our free Brain Health Assessment onwww.brainhealthassessment.com [http://www.brainhealthassessment.com], where wealso have specific suggestions to help each type.Nutraceuticals can have a powerful effect on your brain health, often withoutthe side effects that medications can have. Start with a multivitamin/mineral,omega-3 fatty acid supplement, and vitamin D if needed. Then try adding onesupplement at a time, based on your primary symptoms and brain type, and seewhat helps you to feel better.FOUR STRATEGIES TO USE NUTRACEUTICALS TO FEEL BETTER FAST 1. Take a multivitamin/mineral, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D if your levels are low. 2. Find out if any medications you are taking might be depleting your body of essential nutrients and, if so, consider supplementing the shortfall. 3. Know your risks of memory loss and supplement to prevent cognitive impairment. 4. Find out which of the five basic brain types you have at www.brainhealthassessment.com [http://www.brainhealthassessment.com], and try different supplements to improve your brain’s healthy function.TINY HABITS THAT CAN HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FAST—AND LEAD TO BIG CHANGES5 to 6 minutes. [images/x05-06-min.jpg]Each of these habits takes just a few minutes. They are anchored to somethingyou do (or think or feel) so that they are more likely to become automatic. Onceyou do the behaviors you want, find a way to make yourself feel good aboutthem—draw a happy face, pump your fist, or do whatever feels natural. Emotionhelps the brain to remember. 1. When I eat my breakfast, I will take a multivitamin/mineral and omega-3 fatty acid supplement. I will also know my vitamin D level and take extra if needed. 2. If I take medication, I will also take specific supplements to replenish any essential nutrients the prescription may be depleting (see chart on page 234 [chapter_10.xhtml#page_234]). 3. On Sunday mornings I will refill my supplement organizer.[315] A.

No one really wants to be labeled asdefective or abnormal. But everyone wants a better brain. What if mental healthwas really brain health?DANIEL AMEN--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Apple’s iconic “Think Different” commercial is my all-time favorite. The sloganwas widely considered a response to IBM’s slogan “Think.” The Appleadvertisement ran from 1997 to 2002, at the height of the criticism of the brainimaging work we do at Amen Clinics. It was a stressful time for us. Whenever the“Think Different” commercial would air, I would become emotional, as itdescribed my professional journey and made me feel that I wasn’t the only crazyperson trying to change a small part of the world. I can still hear RichardDreyfuss’s smooth voice saying,Here’s to the crazy ones.The misfits.The rebels.The troublemakers.The round pegs in the square holes.The ones who see things differently.They’re not fond of rules.And they have no respect for the status quo.You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them.Because they change things.They push the human race forward.And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, arethe ones who do.Now, nearly 30 years after we first began our brain imaging work, we have builtthe world’s largest database of functional brain imaging scans related tobehavior. The SPECT scans have taught us and our patients so many importantlessons. In this chapter I will provide you with our top 10 lessons, which canhelp you feel better fast and dramatically change your life.TOP 10 LESSONS FROM SPECT SCANSLESSON #1: CURRENT PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSTIC MODELS ARE OUTDATED BECAUSE THEY DON’TASSESS THE BRAIN.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It’s much harder to fix something if you don’t know what is going wrong.THOMAS INSEL, MD, FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Today, the typical way most people are diagnosed and treated for mental healthissues is by going to a professional and telling him or her their symptoms. Thedoctor or therapist listens, examines them, looks for symptom clusters, and thendiagnoses and treats them. Patients may say, “I’m depressed,” for example, andthe doctor will look at them and then give them a diagnosis with the samename —depression. Treatment is typically an antidepressant medication.If you are anxious, you usually get an “anxiety disorder” diagnosis and end upwith a prescription for an antianxiety medication. Many people with attentionalproblems end up with a diagnosis called attention deficit disorder or attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder and are prescribed a stimulant medication, suchas Ritalin or Adderall. My favorite example of this phenomenon is the diagnosisfor people who have temper problems and explode intermittently. They often get adiagnosis called intermittent explosive disorder, or IED. The acronym is ironic,calling to mind an improvised explosive device, and these patients often wind upin anger management classes or on any number of medications.CURRENT PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSTIC MODELSYMPTOMSDIAGNOSISTREATMENTDepressionDepressionAntidepressantsAnxietyAnxiety disorderAnti-anxiety medicationsAttentional problemsADD or ADHDStimulantsIntermittent explosions, angerIntermittent explosive disorder (IED)Anger management classes or medicationsThis is very similar to the way Abraham Lincoln was diagnosed with melancholy(depression) back in 1840. He told his physician, Anson Henry, his symptoms,which were consistent with depression; Dr. Henry listened to Lincoln recountinghis symptoms, examined him, looked for symptom clusters, and then diagnosedLincoln and started treatment. That was 178 years ago, but it remains themainstay of diagnosis today —identifying symptom clusters without anyinformation on how the brain works. Psychiatrists are the only medicalspecialists who virtually never look at the organ they treat. Cardiologistslook, neurologists look, gastroenterologists look, orthopedists look.Psychiatrists guess.There is a better way.LESSON #2: PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES ARE NOT SINGLE OR SIMPLE DISORDERS; THEY ALLHAVE MULTIPLE TYPES, AND EACH REQUIRES ITS OWN TREATMENT.This was one of the earliest lessons SPECT taught us. Giving someone thediagnosis of depression is like giving him or her the diagnosis of chest pain.No doctor would do that because it doesn’t identify the cause of the pain orwhat to do for it. Consider with me: What can cause chest pain? Heart attacks,heart arrhythmias, pneumonia, grief, anxiety, chest-wall trauma, gas, andulcers, just to name a few. Likewise, what can cause depression? Loss, grief,low thyroid, brain infections, brain trauma, a brain that works too hard, or abrain that does not work hard enough. Do you think all of these will respond tothe same treatment? Of course not.In my past writings I have described seven brain types associated with anxietyand depression, seven types of ADD, six types of addicts, five types ofovereaters, and even three types associated with violence. No one treatment willwork for everyone who is depressed, anxious, inattentive, addicted, overweight,or aggressive. They all have different brain types. Looking at the brain helpsus develop a more complete understanding of our patients’ problems and morepersonalized, targeted treatment.Often when psychiatrists or psychologists come to our office for a tour, I willstart by showing them a set of healthy SPECT scans. Then I will show them scansfrom two 15-year-old multiple murderers.In May 1998, Kip shot and killed his father and mother. The next day he went tohis high school and shot 27 more people, killing 2. Kip had seen severalpsychiatrists and had taken psychiatric medications that were not helpful. Aspart of his trial, he had been scanned, and his scan showed overall severelydecreased blood flow to his brain, especially in his prefrontal cortex (PFC) andtemporal lobes. It was one of the worst scans of a 15-year-old I have ever seen.The damage on his scan was likely from a brain infection, loss of oxygen, orsome form of toxic exposure in the past.Compare Kip to Peter, who killed his mother and eight-year-old sister with abaseball bat for no apparent reason. His scan showed overall increased activity,especially in the area of the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), which caused himto get stuck on negative thoughts.Here are two boys who have the same clinical presentation —multiple murders —butradically different brain patterns. One shows overall low activity; the otheroverall high activity. Do you think they will respond to the same treatment? Ofcourse not. But how would you know what to do unless you actually looked attheir brains? Kip needed a psychiatrist or other physician to find the cause ofhis damaged brain, then rehabilitate it; Peter needed his doctor to help calmhis brain so it did not hijack his behavior.KIP (SURFACE)Surface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-11.1.jpg]Overall low surface activityPETER (SURFACE)Surface SPECT scan showing uniform blood flow.

Why did I want to be a nut doctor and hang outwith nuts all day long? It hurt my feelings then, but 38 years later Iunderstand why he had that reaction. When psychiatrists don’t have hardbiological data to help them make their diagnoses, many people do not take themseriously. Unfortunately, that leaves a huge emotional hole for patients, whooften feel belittled or defective if they have to seek help for a “mental”illness.Imaging completely changes the discussion around mental health. Quite frankly,few people really want to see a psychiatrist. My wife almost canceled her firstdate with me when she found out I was a psychiatrist. No one wants to be labeledas defective, crazy, or abnormal, but everyone wants a better brain. What ifmental health were really brain health? Scans have taught our patients thatlesson over and over.One of the reasons I fell in love with SPECT was that it immediately decreasedstigma for patients. After seeing their scans, they viewed their problems asmedical, not moral. This decreased the sense of shame and guilt that is oftenassociated with having a mental health issue. The brain scan images also helpedfamilies become more supportive of the person who was struggling, similar to theway they would if a family member had diabetes or cancer. There was an increasedsense of compassion and forgiveness.LESSON #4: IF WHAT YOU’RE DOING IS NOT WORKING, LOOK AT THE BRAIN.Aaron, 52, was a highly successful business owner who was married and enjoyinglife at all levels. Out of the blue, he woke up one morning in a panic with aterrible sense of impending doom. He was sweating profusely; his heart wasracing; and he and his wife had no idea what was wrong. His family physician rantests and then prescribed Lexapro, an antidepressant medication, for stress.Within a few days the panic attacks worsened, and Aaron was also put on Xanax, abenzodiazepine antianxiety medicine. A week later he woke up with the thought ofputting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger. Horrified, he came to ourclinic after seeing me on television.Sudden changes in behavior are usually associated with brain trauma, toxins,infections, or a defined emotional trauma. Aaron’s brain SPECT scan showeddamage to his PFC and his left temporal lobe, a pattern that looked consistentwith a traumatic brain injury. When I asked him about it, he didn’t remember anyinjuries until I asked him specifically about falls or accidents. At that, hehit his forehead with his hand and told me that two weeks before the first panicattack, he had taken a hard fall off his mountain bike. The front tire hit ajagged rock as he was riding down a steep hill, which sent him flying over thehandlebars onto his head. He did not lose consciousness, which is why he didn’tthink the injury was important, but he struck the ground so hard his helmetbroke.With this information, Aaron’s clinical presentation made sense. To deal withhis anxiety, his physician had given him two medications that decrease brainactivity —an SSRI (Lexapro) and a benzodiazepine. But because he already had lowactivity from the injury, the medications were making him worse, even to thepoint of suicidal thoughts. We needed to activate and rehabilitate his brain,not put a toxic bandage on it. When you damage your brain, you can clearlydamage your life. Fortunately, the brain is mendable. On a program that includedeliminating the medications that were harmful to him (I am not opposed tomedications; these were just the wrong ones for Aaron), adding supplements tonourish his brain, and using hyperbaric oxygen to encourage healing, withineight days he began to feel much better. Six months later he was symptom-free,and his follow-up scan showed significant improvement.HEALTHY SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing uniform blood flow.[images/Illustration-0Intro.1.jpg]Full, even, symmetrical activityAARON’S INITIAL SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-11.6.jpg]Holes indicate severely decreased blood flow in the PFC and left temporal lobe.AARON’S AFTER TREATMENT SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing uniform blood flow. [images/Illustration-11.7.jpg]Marked overall improvementLESSON #5: LOOKING AT THE BRAIN IMPROVES OUTCOMES, AND PEOPLE GET BETTER FASTER.The most important reason to look at the brain is to improve outcomes. That wasmy clinical experience when we first started scanning patients, but to find outwhat the data showed, we started a formal outcome study in 2011 on many of thepatients we saw. To date we have six-month outcome results on more than 7,000patients. The study made it crystal clear that in general, we see people withcomplex issues who have been unsuccessfully treated by multiple health careproviders. On average, our patients have 4.2 diagnoses (such as a combination ofADHD, depression, anxiety, and addictions), they have seen 3.3 medical or mentalhealth providers before coming to us, and they have tried an average of fivedifferent medications. After six months, 77 percent of our patients reportedthey were better. The number went up to 84 percent if they maintained treatmentat Amen Clinics. Eighty-five percent reported an improved quality of life. (Ourstudy was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Advances in Mind-BodyMedicine.[355]) In a 2014 Canadian study, non-Amen clinicians and researchersusing our method found that psychiatric patients who underwent SPECT-guidedtreatment improved significantly more than patients who did not.[356]In another study we published, we found that SPECT changed how the doctor woulddiagnose or treat patients more than three-quarters of the time. A group ofseven psychiatrists evaluated the charts of more than 100 consecutive patientswho came to one of our clinics. In stage one, the psychiatrists reviewed theclinical histories and diagnostic checklists, but not the results of SPECTstudies, and then gave each patient a diagnosis and treatment plan. (As we’vediscussed, this is how mental health diagnoses and treatment plans are typicallydone.) In stage two, the evaluators were given access to the SPECT studies foreach patient. Having the scans changed the diagnosis or treatment plan in 79percent of cases. The most clinically significant diagnostic changes wereundetected brain trauma (23 percent) and toxicity patterns (23 percent); changesin the treatment arena involved medications or nutraceuticals (60 percent).[357]LESSON #6: LOOKING AT THE BRAIN COMPLETELY CHANGES THE DISCUSSION ABOUT GOOD ANDEVIL.A picture may be worth a thousand words, but a map is priceless. A map tells youwhere you are and gives you directions on how to get where you want to go.Without an accurate map you are lost, and that may cost you precious time ingetting the help you need —or it may even cost your life. SPECT is a map to helpguide people to better brains and better lives.As our brain imaging work became more widely known across California, we beganto receive requests from judges and defense attorneys who were trying tounderstand difficult behavior and wanted our help. As of today, we have scannedhundreds of convicted felons and more than 100 murderers, including several massmurderers, two of whom I mentioned in Lesson #2. We have learned that people whostruggle or do bad things often have troubled brains. That’s to be expected. Butwhat’s more surprising is that many of those brains could be rehabilitated.As I wrote in Change Your Brain, Change Your Life,Here is a radical idea. . . . What if we evaluated and treated troubled brains,rather than simply warehousing them in toxic, stressful environments? In myexperience we could potentially save tremendous amounts of money by making asignificant percentage of these people more functional, so that when they gotout of prison they could work, support their families, and pay taxes.Dostoyevsky once said, “A society should be judged not by how it treats itsoutstanding citizens, but by how it treats its criminals.”[358]Our brain imaging work has taught us that instead of just meting out punishmentfor crimes, we must ask why people do bad things and then find ways to help themif they’ll let us. We will be better as a society. The current approach tojudgment and punishment in our country seems more about vengeance andretribution than rehabilitation. This is a costly mistake and diminishes thesoul of our society. Behavior, at least in part, is related to the actualphysical functioning of the brain, which can be improved when put in a healingenvironment.If you’re not personally paying attention to your brain, your life can goseriously off track. It’s like the lyrics from the old Phil Ochs folksong “Therebut for Fortune,” which tell of a prisoner in jail beinga young man with so many reasons whyAnd there but for fortune, may go you or IOnly I’d argue it should be rewritten: “There but for a healthier brain may goyou or I.” And it is not just about criminal behavior. It’s about any troubledbehavior, such as suicide attempts, marital affairs, domestic violence,mishandling money, misbehaving at school or work, or acting inappropriately asone ages.JASON: AFTERMATH OF A BIKE ACCIDENTJason was 19 years old and madly in love with Jessica, who loved him back. Oneday, he got into a bicycle accident where his front tire hit a curb and he flewover the handlebars and landed on the left side of his head. He had a brief lossof consciousness. The emergency room doctor was too busy to say much, except totell Jason and his parents that he had a mild concussion and should be watchedclosely for the next few days.Within a month, Jason’s behavior changed. No one related it to the concussion.Jason became negative, angry, and obsessively jealous, unlike any behavior hedisplayed before. Jessica became afraid and broke up with him, which made Jasonworse. He couldn’t stop thinking of her.Three months later, Jessica had a new boyfriend. When Jason found out, he wentover to her house, tied up the boyfriend, and raped Jessica. The police werecalled, and there was a standoff, where Jason threatened to kill himself. (Hehad started having serious suicidal thoughts after the accident.) Jasoneventually was taken into custody.When his defense attorney learned about the bicycle accident, he called aneuropsychologist, who tested Jason, found evidence of potential brain damage,and recommended a brain SPECT scan and my involvement in the case.Jason’s scan was very abnormal, indicating trauma to his left temporal lobe(often associated with brain trauma, violence, paranoia, and sometimes suicidalthoughts), excessive activation of his ACG (the gear shifter mechanism in hisbrain was stuck, and he could not let go of bad thoughts), and low PFC activity(leading to poor impulse control). This pattern is one we often see in cases ofviolence and obsession.In jail, Jason was still suicidal. Based on his scans, I recommended acombination of medications to rebalance his brain, an antiseizure medication tohelp his temporal lobes, and the antidepressant venlafaxine, which helps to calmthe ACG and boost the PFC. The medication was helpful; his mood improved and thesuicidal thoughts went away. He told me he had not felt that well since beforehis accident, which was saying something given that he was about to go to trialfor several felonies.The judge in Jason’s trial was running for reelection on a “tough on crime”platform. He was not interested in hearing any of this “new neurosciencenonsense” (his words), and he sentenced Jason to 11 years in prison. When Jasonarrived, the overworked prison psychiatrist was also uninterested in hearingabout Jason’s brain scans and improvement on medication. He diagnosed Jason withantisocial personality disorder and took him off his medication. Four monthslater, Jason hanged himself. I am still furious and cry when I think about him.Yes, what he did was horrible. Yes, he should have been punished. People withtroubled brains are still accountable for their choices. But to ignore, deny,and withhold treatment for the problems stemming from Jason’s concussion isunconscionable and heartbreaking. We must do better, but it takes the ability tothink differently.JASON’S SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-11.8.jpg]Surface scanDamage to left temporal lobeActive SPECT scan showing greater activity in the cerebellum and scattered otherareas. [images/Illustration-11.9.jpg]Active scanIncreased ACG activityOf course, neuroscience alone will never completely help us understand thepuzzle of troubled behavior; many people who have significant brain dysfunctionnever commit a crime or seriously hurt others. Behavior is typically driven by acombination of biological, psychological, social, and spiritual forces. However,if you ignore the brain, you’ll never truly understand why people do what theydo, and you will never be able to fully help them.LESSON #7: LOOKING AT THE BRAIN HELPS TO PREVENT MISTAKES.Imaging has helped us prevent errors, such as stimulating an overactive brain,calming one that is underactive, or labeling behavior as willful when it wasclearly brain-based. Avoiding mistakes saves patients the frustration ofunsuccessful treatments, allows us to help them faster, and gives them more hopefor the future.COTI: AN EVIL CYSTWhen I first met Coti, a 17-year-old, he told me he wanted to cut his mother upinto little pieces. His dark, evil thoughts were out of control. He had beenthrough treatment with six psychiatrists and had tried both a 15-monthresidential treatment program and a 30-day drug treatment program. When wescanned him, I discovered he had the largest cyst I’ve seen, the size of atennis ball, occupying the space of his left frontal and temporal lobes. Hisbehavior improved when the cyst was removed, although he still had leftoverissues because of the damage the cyst had caused.Over the years I have heard many people complain about the cost of scans, yetfor people like Coti, untreated brain problems are dramatically more expensivein terms of money, family stress, and lack of freedom.COTI’S SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-11.10.jpg]Damage to the left frontal and temporal lobes from a large cystRICHARD: OUTBURSTS OF A TROUBLED BRAINRichard ran a large business in Southern California. He was very bright, butover time his business suffered from excessive turnover because he had crueltemper outbursts toward his employees and his wife. He was often apologeticafter an incident, but many people refused to work under the stress he caused.His board of directors forced him to see me. Richard’s SPECT scan showed lowoverall activity in his PFC and both temporal lobes. He also had a cyst in hisleft temporal lobe. When it was drained and Richard went on a brainrehabilitation program that included supplementation and hyperbaric oxygentherapy, his behavior improved and he was able to keep his job. Two months afterthe brain surgery, he told me he was doing much better emotionally and had notlost his temper at all, which was a miracle. He was able to step back moreeasily from stressful situations and be more strategic. He said, “I am amazedthat my troubled brain had hijacked so many relationships.”RICHARD’S SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-11.11.jpg]Low PFC and temporal lobe activityLESSON #8: LOOKING AT THE BRAIN PROVIDES HOPE.Over the years, I have signed thousands of the books I have written forappreciative supporters who have bought them. Ever since we started our brainimaging work, I have signed nearly all of them with the words with hope. Theimages provide hope that there is a better way, and there is hope for healing.DENNY: A SOLDIER’S STORYSecurity is a primary value for my wife, Tana. She grew up in an unsafe, chaoticenvironment, and even though we live in a very safe neighborhood, she lovestraining in martial arts (she has two black belts —one in kempo karate andanother in tae kwon do) and taking survival courses. She recently took ourdaughter Chloe on a survival weekend and met Denny, one of her instructors. Herheart broke when she heard his story. He is a former United States Marine whohad three traumatic brain injuries, including one in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2007when he and several of his friends were riding in a truck that was hit by animprovised explosive device (IED). He was knocked unconscious, and when he awokehe was bleeding from multiple places and two of his friends were dead. He wasrushed into surgery and was later diagnosed with the chronic effects of multipletraumatic brain injuries and posttraumatic stress disorder. His healing journeyinvolved one medication after another without much relief. He became so hopelessthat he tried to end his own life. He finally found a program at StanfordUniversity that was helpful, but it only dealt with the emotional trauma. No onehad performed a functional brain imaging study on him, so Tana invited him tothe clinic.Denny’s SPECT scan showed severe damage affecting his PFC in the front of hisbrain (focus, forethought, judgment, and impulse control), left temporal lobe(memory, learning, and dark thoughts), and occipital lobes in the back (visualprocessing). The good news was that it was clear that his brain could bedramatically improved with the right treatments.DENNY’S SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-11.12.jpg]Holes indicate areas of severely decreased blood flow.After looking at his scan, Denny was actually grateful his brain didn’t lookworse and that he had a “physical” reason for feeling as awful as he did. He wasnow motivated to make his brain much better.A week later he wrote to Tana, “It’s only been a week, and I can already feel adifference. Since the scan I have increased my activity level (fitness),modified my diet, and maintained the supplement regimen. I’m doing great! Myenergy level and attention span have increased, allowing me to focus more. Mydaughter and I have been outdoors every day. Since I started adjusting myhabits, I am happier and more positive. I really want for my brain to have animprovement that can be visible in my scan. That motivation is what has gottenme back to normal.”LESSON #9: ALZHEIMER’S AND OTHER FORMS OF DEMENTIA START YEARS, EVEN DECADES,BEFORE PEOPLE HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS.One of the most profound lessons from our brain imaging work is that Alzheimer’sdisease and other forms of dementia can be seen on SPECT scans years beforepeople have any symptoms. SPECT is a leading indicator of problems, meaning itshows evidence of the disease process years before people show signs of it.Anatomical studies, such as CT and MRI, are lagging indicators. They showproblems later in the course of the illness, when interventions tend to be lesseffective.This lesson led us to advocate for doing scans and implementing preventiontechniques as early in a person’s life as possible. If you consider the factthat 50 percent of the population will get Alzheimer’s disease by the age of 85,prevention should really take center stage in anyone who wants to live to 85 orbeyond.Chalene Johnson is a bestselling author, motivational speaker, and mother oftwo. Despite all her success, when she first came to see us she struggled withmemory, focus, distractibility, procrastination, and always being late toappointments. To give you an idea of how bad it was, she had to shut herself inthe basement closet just to get work done because any noise seemed to distractand irritate her. To make things worse, Chalene had a family history ofAlzheimer’s disease.Her SPECT scan looked terrible. It showed evidence of ADHD with low activity inher frontal lobes, as well as low activity in areas vulnerable to Alzheimer’s.The scan really got her attention. Over the next two years, she did everythingwe asked. Her follow-up scan showed dramatic improvement, decreasing her risk offuture problems. More important, she told me that her performance at work, athome, and in her relationships all improved. Plus, she was finally able to getout of the basement!CHALENE’S “BEFORE” SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-11.13.jpg]Low PFC activity (consistent with ADHD)Low activity indicating vulnerability to later Alzheimer’sAFTER TREATMENT SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing uniform blood flow.

And it is personal.ANDREW: MY NEPHEW’S BRUSH WITH DISASTERI got a call late one night in April 1995 that my nine-year-old godson Andrew,who’s also my nephew, had attacked a little girl on the baseball field that dayfor no particular reason. I was on the phone with Sherrie, my sister-in-law,feeling shocked, and I said, “Excuse me?”She said, “Danny, he’s different. He’s mean. He never smiles anymore. I wentinto his room today, and I found two pictures that he had drawn. In one of them,he was hanging from a tree. In the other picture, he was shooting otherchildren.” In retrospect, Andrew was Columbine, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and Parklandwaiting to happen.I told Sherrie I wanted to see Andrew the next day. They drove from SouthernCalifornia to Northern California, where we had our first clinic. When I walkedinto my office and saw Andrew sitting on the couch, my heart melted. I lovedthis child and was terribly worried about him. I said, “Honey, what’s going on?”He said, “Uncle Danny, I’m mad all the time, and I don’t know why.”I asked, “Is anybody hurting you?”He said, “No.”“Is anybody teasing you?”And he said, “No.”“Is anybody touching you in places they shouldn’t touch you?” I was searchingfor answers to his senseless behavior.And he said, “No.”My first thought was You have to scan him. My next thought, because you knowwe’re always talking to ourselves, was You want to scan everybody. You know,maybe it’s because he’s the second son in a Lebanese family. You’re the secondson in a Lebanese family. Then all of a sudden, the rational voice in my headsaid, Stop it! Nine-year-old children do not attack people for no reason. Scanhim. If his scan is normal, then you can explore other reasons for his behavior.I went with Andrew to the imaging center and held his hand while he held histeddy bear and got scanned. When his brain scan came up on the computer screen,I could see that Andrew was missing the function of his left temporal lobe. Ilooked at Dr. Jack Paldi, my mentor, and said, “Why doesn’t he have a lefttemporal lobe?”To make sure Sherrie and my brother Jim wouldn’t hear, Dr. Paldi wrote on apiece of paper, “It’s a cyst, a stroke, or a tumor.” I was sad, becausesomething was clearly wrong, yet also relieved that something was wrong —therewas a possible explanation for Andrew’s unusual behavior. Andrew had an MRI thatday, which showed he had a cyst (a fluid-filled sac) the size of a golf balloccupying the space where his left temporal lobe should have been. By that timein 1995, we had already correlated left temporal lobe issues with violence. Icalled Andrew’s pediatrician in Southern California and asked him to findsomeone to drain the cyst.ANDREW AND HIS MISSING LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE ON SPECTANDREW (AGE 9)Photo of Andrew holding his small dog and smiling at the camera[images/Illustration-11.15.jpg]Andrew and his dog, BusterANDREW’S SPECT SCANSurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow.[images/Illustration-11.16.jpg]Missing function of the left temporal lobeTwo weeks later, the pediatrician called me back and said he had talked to threeneurologists. None of them recommended we do anything about the cyst, and theythought it probably had nothing to do with Andrew’s behavior problems. He toldme, “They wouldn’t operate on him unless he had real symptoms.”Furious, I said, “Let me get this right. I have a homicidal, suicidal boy. Whatdo you mean by real symptoms?”“I think they mean seizures, or he loses consciousness, or he has speechproblems,” he replied defensively.“This is insanity,” I replied and hung up.I then called a friend of mine at Harvard, who is a pediatric neurologist, andshe told me the same thing. Frustrated, I thought to myself, Neurologists . . .neurologists . . . neurosurgeons. Neurosurgeons operate. I called the pediatricneurosurgery department at UCLA and talked to Dr. Jorge Lazareff, who laterbecame famous for separating the Guatemalan twins who were connected at theirheads. He was famous to me before then because when I told him about Andrew, hesaid, “When cysts are symptomatic, we drain them. Obviously, he has serioussymptoms.”No kidding, I thought to myself.After surgery, I received two phone calls. One was from Sherrie, who was soexcited. She told me the surgery went really well, and when Andrew woke upafterward, he smiled at her. She said, “Danny, he hasn’t smiled for a year.”The second call was from Dr. Lazareff, who said, “Dr. Amen, that cyst was soaggressive and put so much pressure on Andrew’s brain that it actually thinnedthe bone over his left temporal lobe. His temporal bone was eggshell thin. If hehad been hit in the head with a ball, it would have killed him instantly. Eitherway, Andrew would have been dead in six months if you hadn’t persisted.”ANDREW AFTER SURGERYAndrew smiling at the camera while lying in his hospital bed, his head bandaged.[images/Illustration-11.17.jpg]It’s a day I’ll never forget —the day I lost my anxiety about our brain imagingwork and the criticism I had endured. Nine hundred ninety-nine psychiatrists outof a thousand would have medicated Andrew or put him in psychotherapy. I becameeven more passionate than ever about our work. Andrew was blessed in the sensethat he had someone who loved him paying attention to his brain when hisbehavior was off. Now, 23 years later, Andrew is married, employed, owns his ownhome, and pays taxes. Because someone looked at his brain, he has been awonderful son and husband and will be a better father and grandfather.How do you know unless you look? If you don’t look, you hurt people, and that’snot fair. That’s not science. That’s not medicine. It’s stupidity. We can dobetter. When I think of the single most important lesson I’ve learned from the150,000 scans we’ve done, it is this: You can literally change people’s brains,and when you do, you change their lives.In November 2017, unbeknownst to me, someone posted on Facebook a six-minuteclip of me telling Andrew’s story during a lecture I gave at Saddleback Churchin Southern California.[359] The post went viral, and within a few weeks it had38 million views, more than 700,000 shares, and more than 25,000 comments. Manyof the comments made me cry. Here are a few that touched my soul.From JG:I hadn’t seen my brother in 10 years since we were afraid of his behavior.When he was young, he was invited to every major college because he wasbrilliant, yet over the years, especially after he was in the military, he beganto decline mentally. He had several head injuries in his life, one major onewhile in the service. My brother had been aggressive with erratic behavior foryears, and was diagnosed with schizophrenia, as was our mother. It seemedlogical at the time 20 years ago.My brother became homeless, an alcoholic, and addicted to painkillers from beinghit by a drunk driver and ended up in a VA group home. He was robbed andattacked during that time. His injuries caused him to need two brain surgerieslast year.Out of the blue my other brother and I got a call from a young psychiatrist fromthe VA hospital telling us that our older brother had a severe infection,pressure, and scarring in his left temporal lobe. His brain scan showed severalinjuries and infection; and he wanted the hospital to clean out the scar tissue,but the head surgeon didn’t want to perform the surgery, believing our brotherwas a “homeless drunk.” The hospital was keeping our brother in the psychiatricward for aggressive behavior, where we went to visit him —one of the saddestdays of my life to see him there. The young psychiatrist had seen my brother’sbrain scan and thought much of his behavior was due to his injuries and pressureon his brain. He convinced another neurosurgeon to do my brother’s brainsurgery. . . .One year later, my brother has returned to us, like a new person, it’s anabsolute miracle. It’s very sad to think he lived being considered schizophrenicfor all those years. I asked the young psychiatrist why he pushed so hard tohelp my brother, and he said he could tell by talking to him that he seemed fartoo brilliant and knew he must have a family somewhere so he went looking forus. He told me he had another case very similar to our brother’s injuries andthat the other patient had become aggressive after a car accident, so he decidedto search for family and push for my brother to have surgery. God bless such abrilliant man for practicing medicine.From SC:Starting at age seven, I was severely depressed. That’s not normal. Finally, atage 35, I found a psychiatrist who demanded a brain MRI. What did they find?Mesio temporal sclerosis (scarring of the temporal lobe), a form of epilepsythat caused horrible symptoms. I’m on medication and have a whole new life.From JP:I spent years suffering from anxiety, depression, a changed personality. I wouldhave “episodes” where words, written or spoken, made no sense to me. I told mypsychologist and my doctor about these episodes. They just said they didn’t knowwhat it was. Finally, I changed psychiatrists and she sent me for an EEG.Something wasn’t right so I was sent for an MRI where they found a tumor(meningioma). They immediately sent me to the hospital and three days laterremoved it. Five years later I have no anxiety, no depression, no weirdepisodes. I am off all medications. And I am myself again. Thank God mypsychiatrist got things moving for me.20 LESSONS FROM OUR PATIENTSAs I was writing this chapter, I asked our patients to tell me the biggestlessons they learned from looking at their brains. Here are 20 answers, chosenfrom among many. 1. Prior to having my scan, I was misdiagnosed and thus mistreated. After having my scans, it is like I have a new life. 2. I would say that having my son scanned was what changed my life the most and made me a better mom. Seeing his brain made me realize he wasn’t just being defiant, but that when he concentrated, his brain was extremely anxious. It made me realize that instead of yelling and fighting with him like I usually would, I needed to be more patient. He is now doing well in school and playing basketball like a rock star, and our relationship has never been better. 3. I learned as an adult that I still have lasting brain effects from heart surgery as an infant. It helped explain many of my struggles and gave me direction on how to get help. 4. If I didn’t see the damage to my brain, I wouldn’t have taken the actions needed to make it better. 5. The first scan helped me realize I wasn’t crazy. It made total sense I had focus and anxiety issues, but I never admitted it to myself. The second scan three months later verified the supplements and diet changes had calmed my brain dramatically, which is why I was feeling so much better. 6. I never got a scan, but I use the images every day to help children understand the devastating effects of alcohol on the brain. I lost my sister to a DWI crash and she was the one drinking. Shortly thereafter, [when] I became a drug and alcohol prevention educator, I found Dr. Amen’s book Change Your Brain, Change Your Life. I learned so much and now show his video, Which Brain Do You Want? —which shows brain scans of healthy teenagers versus drug-abusing teenagers —to both high school and middle school children. It totally changes the way the kids view drugs and their brains. 7. One of the things that I learned was how important it was to me to have a healthy brain. At the time, I didn’t think about my brain health daily, because out of sight, out of mind (ironically). 8. I had no idea how I was hurting my brain, and my future, with alcohol and weed. 9. The SPECT scan made it real to me that the head trauma I had from a car accident and playing football had me headed for dementia. After seeing the scan, I know what to do to help my frontal cortex get bigger, rather than continue [to] shrink. Yes, size does matter! 10. My scan showed areas of overactivity that were contributing to my anxiety. I was put on the right medicine for my brain, and WOW, almost overnight I noticed the difference. Little things didn’t bother me anymore. 11. I don’t have to helplessly stand by and wait for my brain to deteriorate. It showed me that there are many options to keep my brain healthy. 12. My SPECT scan helped me (and my family!) better understand who I am and then taught me how to be the best version of myself! I went from feeling crazy and frustrated to feeling empowered and energized. Information + action = life change! 13. The SPECT scan allowed my doctors to tailor treatment to my specific brain. Finally, 10 years since my last concussion, I can work full-time again in my academic job. 14. I was once in denial that I had depression and anxiety, due to the lack of physical proof. With the SPECT scan, I was able to see with my own eyes the workings of my brain, which allowed me to accept the truth and move forward with the necessary treatment. 15. The most important lesson from my SPECT scan was that although my cognitive and visual issues are “all in my head,” they are not a “figment of my imagination”! It’s life-changing, real data that must be respected! And there is help available! 16. I oversaw care of my mother for 19 years, through her ever-worsening dementia. It was a horrible, draining experience. After my mother died, I felt concerned about my own brain, so, at 63, I had a SPECT scan. My scan came back clear, which gave me peace of mind for my future. I also used the opportunity to become my best version of brain health. Since my mother lived to 93, I figure I saved myself 30 years of worry and more. I am very, very grateful! 17. I had my brain scanned and the results were shocking. I have ADD. I’m 61 years old and have been searching for the missing piece of my brain since I quit high school at age 16 because I couldn’t sit still or focus on schoolwork. Today it’s possible to change my brain/change my body. I’ve lost weight, I feel better and have better relationships, work is better, and I’m happy. 18. I learned that the symptoms I was experiencing were due to overactivity in certain areas of my brain. Therefore, I learned self-compassion. It was a huge gift. 19. Getting the scan and learning where I was overactive and underactive was priceless. I could now have a more accurate game plan to address my specific needs, versus just a shotgun approach. Having more information allowed for a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan, which in the end led to a quicker and more permanent solution to the issues I was having. It’s the closest thing to having a crystal ball that I have seen. 20. Your brain WANTS to heal itself, and given the right conditions, it CAN.WHEN SHOULD YOU THINK ABOUT GETTING A FUNCTIONAL IMAGING STUDY, SUCH AS SPECT?We order SPECT studies on most of our patients because they generally come to usafter they have failed to get better with other specialists and therapies. Manypatients tell us, “You are my last hope.” In these cases, we need more detailedinformation to see if we can identify something that has been overlooked. Ingeneral, I think of SPECT as radar. If it is sunny outdoors, it is easy forpilots to land planes at the airport. So if you have a simple case, you don’tneed a scan. But if it is stormy out, with dark clouds, lightning, and thunder,radar can be lifesaving. Likewise, if your case is complicated and you have notgotten better with other providers or treatments, a scan could be lifesaving.Here are answers to several common questions about SPECT.Will the SPECT study give me an accurate diagnosis?No. A SPECT study by itself will not provide a diagnosis. SPECT studies help theclinician understand more about the specific function of your brain. Eachperson’s brain is unique, which may lead to unique responses to medicine ortherapy. Diagnoses about specific conditions are made through a combination ofclinical history, personal interviews, information from families, diagnosticchecklists, SPECT studies, and other neuropsychological tests. No imaging studyalone is a “doctor in a box” that can give accurate diagnoses on individualpatients.Why are SPECT studies ordered?Some of the common reasons include 1. Evaluating seizure activity 2. Evaluating cerebral vascular disease 3. Evaluating cognitive impairment and dementia 4. Evaluating the effects of mild, moderate, and severe head trauma 5. Suspicion of an underlying organic brain condition, such as seizure activity contributing to behavioral disturbance, prenatal trauma, or exposure to toxins 6. Evaluating aggressive behavior that’s atypical or unresponsive to treatment 7. Determining the extent of brain impairment caused by drug or alcohol abuse 8. Subtyping ADHD, anxiety, depression, addictions, and obesity 9. Evaluating treatment-resistant couples for underlying conditions that might be contributing to their relationship issues 10. General wellness screenings for people who are interested in brain optimizationAre there any side effects or risks from the study?The study does not involve a dye, and people do not have allergic reactions tothe study. The possibility exists, although in a very small percentage ofpatients, of a mild rash, facial redness and edema (swelling), fever, and atransient increase in blood pressure. The amount of radiation exposure from onebrain SPECT study is approximately the same as from one head CT scan, orone-third of an abdominal CT scan. Pregnant women should not have a SPECT study.How is the SPECT procedure done?The patient is placed in a quiet room, and an intravenous (IV) line is started.The patient remains quiet for approximately 10 minutes with eyes open to allowhis or her mental state to equilibrate to the environment. The imaging agent isthen injected through the IV. After another short period of time, the patientlies on a table and the SPECT camera rotates around his or her head (the patientdoes not go into a tube). The time on the table is approximately 15 minutes. Ifa concentration study is ordered, the patient returns on another day to repeatthe process; a concentration test is performed during the injection of theisotope.Are there alternatives to having a SPECT study?In our opinion, SPECT is the most clinically useful study of brain function.There are other studies, such as quantitative electroencephalograms (QEEGs),positron emission tomography (PET) studies, and functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRIs). PET studies and fMRIs tend to be more costly, and they areperformed mostly in research settings. QEEGs can provide useful information, butthey often do not give information on the deep areas of the brain.Does insurance cover the cost of SPECT studies?Reimbursement by insurance companies varies according to your plan. It is a goodidea to check with the insurance company ahead of time to see if a SPECT studyis a covered benefit.Is the use of brain SPECT imaging accepted in the medical community?Brain SPECT studies are widely recognized as an effective tool for evaluatingbrain function in seizures, strokes, dementia, and head trauma. There areliterally thousands of research articles on these topics. In our clinic, basedon our experience over 28 years, we have developed this technology further toevaluate aggression and nonresponsive psychiatric conditions. Unfortunately,many physicians do not fully understand the application of SPECT imaging and maytell you that the technology is experimental, but more than 6,000 medical andmental health professionals around the world have referred patients to us forscans.We’ve learned so much from SPECT scans, and I’m proud of the difference we’vemade in the lives of thousands of patients. Whether or not you pursue a scan,the most important thing I want you to take away from this chapter is hope. Youcan change your brain, and that can change your life.10 PRACTICAL LESSONS FROM 150,000 SCANS —HOW THEY HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FAST ANDMAKE IT LAST 1. Current psychiatric diagnostic models are outdated because they don’t assess the brain. 2. Psychiatric diagnoses are not single or simple disorders; they all have multiple types, and each requires its own treatment. 3. Looking at the brain decreases stigma, increases compliance with treatment, and completely changes the discussion around mental health. 4. If what you’re doing is not working, look at the brain. 5. Looking at the brain improves outcomes, and people get better faster. 6. Looking at the brain completely changes the discussion about good and evil. 7. Looking at the brain helps to prevent mistakes. 8. Looking at the brain provides hope. 9. Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia start years, even decades, before people have any symptoms. 10. The most important lesson from 150,000 scans is that you can change your brain, and it will change your life.TINY HABITS THAT CAN HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FAST —AND LEAD TO BIG CHANGES10 seconds to 20 minutes. [images/x10-sec-20-min.jpg]Each of these habits takes just a few minutes. They are anchored to somethingyou do (or think or feel) so that they are more likely to become automatic. Onceyou do the behaviors you want, find a way to make yourself feel good aboutthem —draw a happy face, pump your fist, or do whatever feels natural. Emotionhelps the brain to remember. 1. When I read about someone who has done something terrible, I will wonder what might have been going on in his or her brain. 2. When someone is being difficult with me, I will try not to overreact, knowing the other person may have issues I am unaware of. 3. If I have struggled with mental health issues and get down on myself, I will say to myself, “My brain can be better if I do the right things for it.”[355] D. G.

In this chapter I’llexplore six different types of love (need-love, gift-love, family-love,friendship, erotic love, and agape or selfless love) and how each relates toyour ability to get and stay well. Altruism, which is a combination of gift-loveand agape, has been shown to significantly increase happiness in a short periodof time."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12LOVE IS YOUR SECRET WEAPONDOING THE RIGHT THING IS THE ULTIMATE ACT OF LOVE FOR SELF AND OTHERS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Love your neighbor as yourself.JESUS, MARK 12:31--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Focusing on getting and keeping your brain healthy is the most loving choice youcan make for yourself and others. I try to do the right things for myself notbecause I should . . . yuck . . . but because I love myself, and I love my wife,children, grandchildren, parents, and siblings, and the mission of our work atAmen Clinics. In order for me to have the energy, mental clarity, and gooddecision-making ability to be an excellent husband, father, grandfather,physician, and leader of our business, I need to have a brain and body that workat their peak. If I ignored my health, as so many Americans do, then I wouldmake poorer decisions, act in less helpful ways, and increase the risk of beinga burden to my family rather than being the leader of my family. I see pursuinggood health as the ultimate act of love.One of my very close friends was obese when I nudged him to get healthy. He toldme he didn’t care if he lived a long time because he knew he was going to heavenwhen he died. When his wife heard what he said, she became furious and told him,“Because of the bad health decisions you make every day, you are much morelikely to die early and abandon me, leaving me lonely, afraid, and unprotected.That’s not love. That’s selfish. It feels like you hate me.” He got the messageand got healthy over the next year. He did it out of love.In order to feel better fast and make it last, it is critical to developconsistent habits and rituals over a long period of time that help buildresilience. That way, when crises come, as they do for all of us, you areconsiderably better able to deal with them because you have the mentalhorsepower you need. Yes, getting healthy takes some work, as any loverelationship does, but it is worth it.When you really understand that getting healthy is about love, you stop sayingthings about getting healthy being hard, expensive, or boring, or about notwanting to deprive yourself. As I have seen many times throughout my career withmy patients, being sick is hard, expensive, and boring, and you definitelydeprive yourself of what you really want most, which is your health, energy,focus, happiness, and mental clarity. Ask anyone who’s had a seriousillness —your health is your greatest asset and your greatest desire when it isgone. I love my four children, but honestly, I never want to have to live withthem. I never want to be a burden to them, and I don’t want them telling me whatto eat or what to wear, or trying to take my driver’s license away from me. Ifyou love your independence, you must start taking care of your brain and body.When you model a brain-healthy life, others in your life, such as your spouse,children, and coworkers, are likely to follow. Children do what you do, not whatyou tell them to do. If you ignore your health, eat low-quality food, smoke,drink alcohol when stressed, or take medicines for chronic illnesses, such asdiabetes or hypertension, without changing your lifestyle, they are likely tofollow your example. Ask yourself, Am I modeling health or illness? In theUnited States we value our freedom. We don’t want anyone telling us what to door how to live. I don’t either, but ultimately, our behavior is not just aboutus; it is about generations of us.A new field of genetics, called epigenetics, has exploded onto the scientificscene over the past 20 years. Epigenetic means “above or on top of the gene.” Itrefers to the recent discovery that your habits, emotions, and environment canturn on or off certain genes, making illness more or less likely in you as wellas in your children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren. Your habits,emotions, and environment have such a strong impact on your biology that theyalter the genes you pass on to future generations. It is these epigenetic“marks” that tell your genes to switch on or off or to manifest more strongly orweakly.Diet, stress, toxins, prenatal nutrition, and other environmental factors, viaepigenetics, can alter the activity of genes that you pass on to your childrenand your children’s children. If a mom or dad eats poorly, even before theyconceive, their child has an increased risk of cancer, heart disease, mentalhealth issues, and addiction.[360] Studies have shown that boys who startedsmoking cigarettes before age 11 increased the risk of obesity in theirchildren.[361] A dumb decision early in life can impact generations to come —andnot just related to obesity. Some researchers believe that epigenetics holds thekey to understanding certain cancers, heart disease, diabetes, schizophrenia,addictions, autism, and forms of dementia.To stress how important epigenetics is, think of it this way: A baby girl isborn with all of the eggs she will ever have. Her diet, habits, stresses, andenvironment turn on or turn off certain genes that make illness more or lesslikely in her, but also in her babies and grandbabies. Helping her do the rightthings is not just about her; it is about generations of her. This is a soberingmessage but one that must be addressed now, given that all of us are in a warfor the health of our brains and bodies.WHAT DO YOU LOVE THAT HOLDS YOU BACK?I am often amazed at what people say they love. I hear people say they “love”bread, wine, sodas, fries, donuts, or sugar and cannot imagine their liveswithout them. They seem to put these substances in the same category as theirspouses, children, and family members.In 2010, Rick Warren, author of The Purpose Driven Life and senior pastor ofSaddleback Church —one of the country’s largest congregations —recruited Dr.Mark Hyman and me to develop a health program for churches. Called the DanielPlan (no, not after me —after the Old Testament prophet Daniel), the program hasbeen adopted by thousands of churches with great success. During its first week15,000 people signed up, and over the first year they collectively lost 250,000pounds (the weight of a space shuttle). They reported improvements in energy,focus, creativity, sleep, and mood, and reductions in stress, blood pressure,blood sugar, sexual dysfunction (always fun to talk about at church), and theuse of medication. As in any change program, there was a fair amount of pushbackfrom the church staff when we first started.In one instance, a staff member came to my office for a consultation. We wereboth drinking tea while talking about her health background when she saidsomething very strange: She asked me to put my tea down. I thought it was an oddrequest, but I politely did as she asked.“I didn’t want you to spit it at me,” she said.“Excuse me,” I replied, feeling very curious, “I’ve never spit tea at anyone.”“Last night, after you spoke at church,” she said, “I told my husband that Iwould rather get Alzheimer’s disease than give up sugar . . . I didn’t want youto spit the tea at me when you heard what I said.”I paused, smiled, and then asked, “Did you date the bad boys in high school?”“No,” she replied.“Well, you are in love with something that hurts you. You are in a badrelationship with sugar. It beats you up, and you come back for more because youlove it. Sugar increases erratic brain-cell firing, it is pro-inflammatory, itchanges your brain so it needs sugar in order to feel normal, and it isaddictive, just like a bad relationship. It has actually been found in animalstudies to be more addictive than cocaine.”Eventually this staff member fell in love with herself, broke up with sugar, andhelped her whole family get healthy. What things do you love that might beholding you back and keeping you from genuinely loving yourself?SIX TYPES OF LOVEGetting well starts with self-love. You do the right thing, not for momentarypleasure —that is a four-year-old’s mind-set —but because it helps you feelgood, increases your energy, and helps you stay on the path toward your goals inlife.C. S. Lewis, the British theologian and novelist who wrote The Chronicles ofNarnia and The Screwtape Letters, among many other books, also wrote The FourLoves. Two types of love he described are “need-love” and “gift-love.”[362] Ababy needs love from her mother so she can be fed; and the mother gifts love tonurture and feed her child. Doing the right things for your brain’s health is“need-love,” for without it you will never be your best. But doing the rightthings for your brain health is also “gift-love,” as you are giving to others bymodeling good health for them.The Greek language has four words for love: * Storge (pronounced with a hard g sound) —affectionate love between family members, such as a mother for her child, or a child for his father * Phileo —friendship, brotherly love (Philadelphia means “the city of brotherly love”) * Eros —passionate love * Agape —selfless love, gift-love, the highest form of loveIn the Greek New Testament, agapeseis (the verb form of agape) was the word usedto translate what Jesus said when He exhorted His followers to love theirneighbors as themselves. When we do this, we emulate God Himself, becauseScripture says that He is love (1 John 4:8). We can love others “because heloved us first” (1 John 4:19, NLT). Allowing that love to guide our choicesbrings meaning into our lives.Getting and staying healthy is good for you (self-love), good for your family(storge), good for your friends and coworkers (phileo), and good for our societyat large (agape). Plus, when you really understand getting healthy, you realizeit is also great for your blood vessels and sex life (eros). Erectiledysfunction is often a result of an unhealthy lifestyle, which can be improvedby taking care of your brain and body. Making choices based on all these facetsof love is good for other people and good for us.RAY AND NANCY: IMPROVING BRAIN HEALTH AS A COUPLERay played linebacker for the San Diego Chargers in the early 1970s, and he cameto see us as part of our NFL study in 2010. Part of Ray’s motivation forparticipating in the study was that his wife, Nancy, had been recently diagnosedwith frontal temporal lobe dementia, and he wanted me to evaluate her. He wasupset at the physician who diagnosed Nancy. The physician told Ray that heshould find a “care” home for her because within a year she would not know hisname, and he would be unable to care for her.Ray’s brain scan showed evidence of brain trauma, as did those of almost all ofour retired players, plus he was overweight. Nancy’s scan was a disaster. Shehad severe decreased activity in the front part of her brain, consistent withthe diagnosis of frontal temporal lobe dementia. Sitting down to review theirscans was very emotional for Ray and Nancy —and for me, too. From our clinicalexperience, we knew we could help Ray. But there is still no known effectivetreatment for frontal temporal lobe dementia.I told Ray, “We have no proven treatment for Nancy. But if she were my wife, andI love my wife (this sort of makes a difference on what you are willing todo —only being brutally honest here), I would do all of the things I could forher.” Our strategy with cases like Nancy’s is to do everything possible to tryto slow or reverse the dementia process. And while it does not work foreveryone, it can help some. The treatment plan involved attacking all of therisk factors discussed in chapter 2 (see pages 33–37 [chapter_2.xhtml#page_33]).We had her stop drinking alcohol; completely changed her diet; increasedexercise and new learning (she took surfing and singing lessons); put her on amultivitamin/mineral, fish oil, and other brain-boosting supplements; and gaveher hyperbaric oxygen and neurofeedback, which will be discussed in appendix A(page 289 [appendix_1.xhtml#page_289]).Ten weeks later I saw them back for their first follow-up visit. Ray had madesure that Nancy completely followed the plan, and her follow-up scan showeddramatic improvement. In addition to her improved scan, her memory and cognitivefunction were better. Ray joked that we had to slow down, because soon enoughshe would be smarter than he was. In addition, Ray had lost 30 pounds!Impressed, I asked him how he did it. He said his motivation was helping hiswife get well. If he did everything I suggested, she would too. He would model abrain-healthy life, and they would get healthier as a couple. Sometimesmotivation is about love. Ray loved Nancy.NANCY: FRONTAL TEMPORAL LOBE DEMENTIA BEFORE AND AFTERSurface SPECT scan showing areas of very low blood flow toward the front of thebrain.

In fact, based on a lot of personal experience, I think you’ll find yourfriends and family may actively try to sabotage you. If they are not healthy,they will resent you for getting well. But over time, if you stay the course,they will eventually want what you have, and you will have the opportunity tocreate a revolution in your circle of family and friends.ELLY: HANDING DOWN BRAIN HEALTHElly came to see us from St. Petersburg, Russia. Before she started doing ourprogram at home, Elly was obese, anxious, depressed, isolated, and in chronicback pain. Her mother had had dementia, which had been extremely hard oneveryone in her family, and Elly was worried about developing it herself. Afterreading my book Change Your Brain, Change Your Life, she started incorporatingone simple brain health strategy at a time. First she started takingbrain-healthy supplements, which included a multivitamin/mineral, omega-3s, andextra vitamin D because her level tested low. Afterward, she noticed her energywas significantly better. Then she started drinking more water, which made apositive difference in her focus. As Elly began to feel better, she startedexercising. She began walking and taking dancing lessons, which boosted her moodand decreased her isolation. Next, she took a big leap and changed her diet tothe one discussed in chapter 9 (see page 203 [chapter_9.xhtml#page_203]). Thenshe started taking Italian classes and learned to play the piano.Over the next year, Elly lost 70 pounds. She told us she feels better than shehas in decades and is pain-free. Elly then taught her children and grandchildrenhow to care for their brains. By teaching them about brain health, she wascreating her own support group (both need-love and gift-love), making it morelikely she’d stay on the program forever. Elly told me, “The best thing I can dofor my children is keep my brain healthy for as long as I can and not be aburden to them.”Elly is the reason why we do what we do. I met Elly when she came to ourCalifornia clinic to get scanned as a 90th birthday present to herself. Unlikescans of most 90-year-old brains, Elly’s scan looked like that of someone in hersixties! Her brain was strong and healthy. When she saw her scan, she criedtears of joy. She said it would have looked much worse just a year earlier. Byusing these simple strategies, Elly changed the trajectory of the rest of herlife, and her family’s lives too. Elly loved herself and others and gave themone of the greatest gifts ever. Plus, she was thrilled she would not be a burdenon her family (more agape gift-love).GET OUTSIDE YOURSELF TO FEEL BETTER FASTWhen Jesus told us to love each other as ourselves, He was giving us good healthadvice. Research suggests that whenever you feel down, anxious, or angry, it isbest to get outside yourself to change your state of mind. In a new study,people who wrote about gratitude activated a part of their brains involved inhappiness and altruism.[363] If you want to feel better fast, go to the aid ofsomeone who needs help. According to a New York Times story, in the 1970s,former First Lady Barbara Bush became so depressed that she sometimes stoppedher car on the side of the road for fear that she might deliberately crash thevehicle into a tree or an oncoming car. Mrs. Bush did not seek psychiatric helpor medication for her depression, which she blamed on the hormonal changes ofmenopause and the stress of her husband’s job as CIA director. Instead, she saidshe treated her depression by immersing herself in volunteer work and gettingoutside herself to help others.[364]Being loving to strangers (agape) —or even to people you know (storge orphileo) —has the added benefit of making you feel happier, according to twostudies. In one study, 86 participants were first asked about their lifesatisfaction and then divided into three groups. The first group was told to doan act of kindness every day for 10 days; the second group was told to dosomething new every day for 10 days; and the third group was given noinstruction. When the 10 days had passed, the groups were retested on lifesatisfaction. Levels of happiness increased significantly and nearly equallyamong participants in the groups that had performed acts of kindness or novelactivities, while happiness didn’t change at all in the group that didneither.[365] Doing something for others for 10 days, especially if you vary thegood deeds, is an effective way to make yourself feel better, the studysuggests.In another study, participants were divided into two groups and asked to recalleither the last time they spent either $20 or $100 on themselves or the lasttime they had spent the same amount on someone else. After completing a scalemeasuring their levels of happiness, all of the participants were provided witha small sum of money and given the option of spending the money on themselves oron another person. The researchers found that study subjects were happier whenthey were asked to recall a time when they had purchased something for someoneelse, no matter the price of the gift. What’s more, the happier they felt aboutbeing generous in the past, the greater the likelihood that they would spendmoney on someone besides themselves.[366] To feel better fast, it is better togive than to receive.TURN TOWARD OTHERS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you want to live a long life, focus on making contributions.HANS SELYE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Research shows the happiest people are outward facing, focusing more on thepeople they serve than on themselves.[367] Even though the prayer attributed toSt. Francis of Assisi was likely never written by him, it provides aresearch-based guide to happiness. When you feel stressed, consider repeating itor any other similar prayer or meditation, such as the Loving-KindnessMeditation (see chapter 1, pages 20–21 [chapter_1.xhtml#page_20]).PEACE PRAYER OF ST. FRANCISLord, make me an instrument of your peace:where there is hatred, let me sow love;where there is injury, pardon;where there is doubt, faith;where there is despair, hope;where there is darkness, light;where there is sadness, joy.O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seekto be consoled as to console,to be understood as to understand,to be loved as to love.For it is in giving that we receive,it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.Amen.As you conclude this book, may you find the courage to love yourself and othersenough to make changes in your life, one strategy at a time. Your movementtoward brain health will help you feel better fast and will leave a lastinglegacy for those around you.TINY HABITS THAT CAN HELP YOU FEEL BETTER FAST—AND LEAD TO BIG CHANGES3 to 30 minutes. [images/x03-30-min.jpg]Each of these habits takes just a few minutes. They are anchored to somethingyou do (or think or feel) so that they are more likely to become automatic. Onceyou do the behaviors you want, find a way to make yourself feel good aboutthem—draw a happy face, pump your fist, or do whatever feels natural. Emotionhelps the brain to remember. 1. When I approach any meal, I will ask myself if I am getting the nutrients I need to serve my health rather than steal from my health (need-love). 2. When I bring food to work, school, or an event, I will ask myself if it serves the health of those who will eat it, or if it steals from their health (gift-love). 3. When I shower in the morning, I will ask myself if I am doing what I can to be a healthy role model for my family (storge love). 4. Whenever I am around my friends, I will ask myself if I am modeling behavior that helps their health or makes it worse (phileo love). 5. When I hold my spouse’s hand, I will gently squeeze it and remember that if our habits are healthy, our love life will be better and last longer throughout our lives (eros love). 6. When I watch the news, I will be on the lookout for ways to make a meaningful contribution to the health of my community (agape love).SEVEN FEEL BETTER FAST BRAIN-XL SUMMARY QUESTIONS * Brain —Is the decision I’m about to make good for my brain or bad for it? * Rational Mind —Am I allowing untrue, negative thoughts to infect my brain and impact my happiness? * Attachments —Does my behavior today enhance or hurt my relationships? * Inspiration —Does this feeling or action have eternal value? * Nourishment —Do I eat and love mostly foods that love me back? * X Factor —If I looked at my brain, would it be healthy or not?

I recommend that people seek professionalhelp when their attitudes, behaviors, feelings, or thoughts interfere with theirability to be successful in the world —whether in their relationships, in theirwork, or within themselves —and self-help techniques, such as the ones in thisbook, have not helped them fully alleviate the problem.WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN A LOVED ONE IS IN DENIAL ABOUT NEEDING HELP?Unfortunately, the stigma associated with “psychiatric illness” prevents manypeople from getting help. People do not want to be seen as crazy, stupid, ordefective, and they often don’t seek support until they (or their loved one) canno longer tolerate the pain (on the job, in relationships, or insidethemselves).Here are several suggestions for people who are unaware that they would benefitfrom help or are unwilling to get the assistance they need: 1. Try the straightforward approach first (but with a new brain twist). Clearly tell the person what behaviors concern you. Tell him that the problems may be due to underlying brain patterns that can be tuned up. Explain that help may be available —not to cure a defect but rather to optimize how the brain functions. Tell the loved one that you know he is trying to do his best, but unproductive behavior, thoughts, or feelings may be getting in the way of his success. Emphasize access to help, not the person’s defect. 2. Give the loved one information. Books, videos, and articles on the subjects you are concerned about can be of tremendous help. Many people come to see me because they read a book or article I wrote, or saw a video I produced. Good information can be very persuasive, especially if it is presented in a positive, life-enhancing way. 3. Plant seeds. When someone remains resistant to help, even after you have been straightforward and given him or her good information, plant seeds (ideas) about getting help and then water them regularly. Drop an idea, article, or other information about the topic from time to time. Be careful not to go overboard. If you talk too much about getting help, people will become resentful and won’t pursue it, just to spite you. 4. Protect your relationship with the other person. People are more receptive to those they trust than to those who nag and belittle them. I do not let anyone tell me something bad about myself unless I trust him or her. Work on gaining the person’s trust over the long run. It will make him or her more receptive to your suggestions. Do not make getting help the only thing that you talk about. Make sure you are interested in the person’s whole life, not just in potential medical appointments. 5. Give new hope. Many people with mental health problems have tried to get help and found that it either didn’t work or made them worse. Educate your loved one on new brain technology that helps professionals be more focused and effective in their treatment efforts. 6. There comes a time when you have to say, “Enough is enough.” If, over time, the other person refuses to get help and his or her behavior has a negative impact on your life, you may have to separate yourself. Staying in a toxic relationship is harmful to your health, and it often enables the other person to remain sick. Actually, I have seen that the threat or act of leaving can motivate a loved one to change, whether the problem area is drinking, drug use, or an underlying condition like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or bipolar disorder. Threatening to leave is not the first tactic I would take, but after time it may be the best approach. 7. Realize that you cannot force people into treatment unless they are dangerous to themselves, dangerous to others, or unable to care for themselves. You can do only what you can do. Fortunately, today there is a lot more we can do than even 10 years ago.HOW DO I FIND A COMPETENT PROFESSIONAL?At Amen Clinics we get many e-mails, social media posts, and calls each weekfrom people all over the world who are looking for competent professionals intheir area whose mind-set is similar to mine and who utilize the principlesoutlined in this book. Because some of these principles are still on the edge ofwhat is new in brain science, such professionals may be hard to locate. Still,finding the right person for evaluation and treatment is critical to the healingprocess. Choosing the wrong one can make things worse. There are a number ofsteps you can take to find the best person to assist you: 1. Get the best person you can find. Trying to save money up front may cost you a lot in the long run. The right help not only is cost-effective but saves unnecessary pain and suffering. Don’t rely on a physician or therapist solely because he or she is on your managed care plan. That person may or may not be a good fit for you, and you shouldn’t settle for someone who isn’t a good fit. If he or she is on your insurance plan, that’s great. Just don’t let that be the primary criterion if you can help it. 2. Use a specialist. Brain science is expanding at a rapid pace. Specialists keep up with the latest developments in their fields, while generalists (family physicians) have to try to keep up with everything. If I had a heart arrhythmia, I would see a cardiologist rather than a general internist. I want to be treated by someone who has seen hundreds or even thousands of cases like mine. 3. Get information about referrals from people who are highly knowledgeable about your problem. Oftentimes well-meaning generalists give very bad information. I have known many physicians and teachers who make light of diet, supplements, and lifestyle interventions. It may help to seek out a functional or integrative medicine doctor, who has specialized training and likely can refer you to other physicians as needed. 4. Once you get the names of professionals, check their credentials. State medical boards will have a public record of any legal or ethical trouble. 5. Set up an interview with the professional to see whether or not you want to work with him or her. Generally, you have to pay for a consultation, but it is worth spending time getting to know the people you will rely on for help. If you sense the fit isn’t good, keep looking. 6. Read professionals’ writing or go hear them speak. Many professionals write articles or books or speak at meetings or local groups. If you read their writings or hear them speak, you can often get a feel for the kind of people they are and their ability to help you. 7. Look for a person who treats you with respect, who listens to your questions, and who responds to your needs. Look for a relationship that is collaborative and trusting.I know it is hard to find a professional who meets all of these criteria and whoalso has the right training in brain physiology, but it is possible. Bepersistent. The right caregiver is essential to healing.ARE THERE NEW AND INNOVATIVE TREATMENTS THAT CAN HELP ME?Brain science is evolving quickly, and new treatments are being introduced at arapid pace. At Amen Clinics we often recommend the following six innovativetreatments to help our patients: * hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) * transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) * ketamine infusions * neurofeedback * audiovisual entrainment (AVE) * Irlen lensesHYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY (HBOT): HOW “AIR” CAN BOOST HEALINGHealing cannot take place without healthy oxygen levels. HBOT relies onhigh-dose oxygen to speed up the healing process and reduce inflammation. Insidean HBOT chamber, where a patient sits or lies down for treatment, the airpressure is 1.3 to 2 times greater than normal. The increased air pressure helpsthe lungs gather more oxygen, allowing it to get into blood vessels and tissues,where it can increase production of growth factors and stem cells, promotinghealing.Normally, oxygen is carried throughout the body by red blood cells alone. WithHBOT, oxygen dissolves into other bodily fluids, such as plasma, cerebral spinalfluid, and lymph and can be carried to regions where circulation is low ordamaged. In vascular problems, strokes, and nonhealing wounds, for example,adequate oxygen cannot reach damaged areas and the body’s natural healingability is ineffective. When extra oxygen is able to reach those areas, itspeeds the healing process. Researchers have found that increased oxygenstrengthens the ability of white blood cells to kill bacteria, reduces swelling,and allows new blood vessels to grow into damaged tissues. It is a simple,noninvasive, and painless treatment with minimal side effects.Research also suggests it can be helpful for * head injuries[368] * stroke[369] * fibromyalgia[370] * Lyme disease (as a helpful add-on treatment)[371] * burns[372] * diabetic ulcers and complications[373] * wound healing[374] * multiple sclerosis[375] * irritable bowel disease[376] * healing after surgery and radiation therapy[377] * autism[378] * cerebral palsy[379]In 2011, Paul Harch, MD, and I and other colleagues published a study on 16soldiers who had experienced blast-induced traumatic brain injuries. We didbrain SPECT imaging and neuropsychological testing on the group before and after40 sessions of HBOT. After treatment, our patients demonstrated significantimprovement in their symptoms; full-scale IQ (a term for complete cognitivecapacity; up 14.8 points); delayed and working memory scores; tests ofimpulsivity, mood, and anxiety; and quality of life scores. In addition, theirSPECT scans showed remarkable overall improvement in blood flow.TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (TMS): AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO HEAL MOODA form of “brain stimulation,” TMS is used in the treatment of certainpsychiatric and neurological disorders that have not improved with traditionalapproaches. TMS uses a noninvasive, highly focused, brief magnetic pulse tostimulate activity in the areas of the brain known to affect mood —without thetroubling side effects people often experience when they take medication. TMShas been approved by the FDA for the treatment of resistant depression, butthere is new evidence that it can enhance memory and potentially help improve awide range of other brain-related issues, including * depression[380] * anxiety[381] * addiction[382] * smoking[383] * posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)[384] * obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)[385] * cognitive problems, memory, and dementia[386] * tinnitus (ringing in the ears)[387] * stroke[388]Electrical stimulation has been used for healing for centuries, starting morethan 2,000 years ago when the Egyptians discovered that certain fish produceelectrical impulses that could be used to treat pain and gout. The Greeks andRomans went on to practice these treatments too. Centuries later, in 1745, AltusKratzstein, a German physician, wrote the first book on electrical therapy,which became the basis for Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. Toward the end of the18th century, Italian physician and physicist Luigi Galvani discovered thatpassing an electrical current through the spine of a frog caused the amphibian’smuscles to contract. He concluded that nerves were not water pipes, as Descarteshad thought, but electrical conductors carrying information within the nervoussystem. Less than 50 years later, Michael Faraday discovered the fundamentalprinciples of electromagnetic induction while attempting to stimulate nerves andthe brain. His attempts were unsuccessful, but his advances led to the firstsuccessful transcranial magnetic stimulation in 1985. In 1997, TMS was approvedfor use in Canada, and in 2008 it was cleared by the FDA as a treatment fordepression.In a 2015 study, researchers from the University of São Paulo in Brazil studiedthe effect of TMS on memory in 34 elderly men and women with mild cognitiveimpairment (MCI). The scientists divided the participants into two groups. Onegroup received 10 sessions of active TMS to stimulate the left front side of thebrain, and the other group received sham (or fake) treatments. Cognitive testingbefore and after TMS showed the treatment group significantly improved on testsof everyday memory when compared to the sham group. Based on these findings, theresearchers suggested that TMS might be effective as a treatment for MCI and“probably a tool to delay deterioration.”[389]TMS is a targeted treatment, and, unlike medication, it has no systemic sideeffects (because it doesn’t get into your bloodstream). It is usuallywell-tolerated. Side effects are generally mild to moderate, and includeheadaches, scalp discomfort at the site of stimulation, tingling, spasms ortwitching of facial muscles, and lightheadedness. These improve shortly after asession and decrease over time with additional sessions. Serious side effectsare rare but may include seizures and mania, particularly in people with bipolardisorder. Treatment sessions last about 40 minutes, and you can resume yournormal activities immediately afterward. After a full course of treatment, whichranges from 16 to 30 sessions, a high percentage of patients report asignificant reduction in symptoms and experience improvement in their quality oflife.KETAMINE INFUSIONS: A SOLUTION FOR DEPRESSION AND PAINWhen nothing else seems to work, I consider giving ketamine infusions.Sixty-year-old Georgia had been in psychiatric care for decades. She struggledwith anxiety and depression and had tried many different treatments, includingmultiple medications, multiple therapists, TMS, and nutritional supplements.When her depression worsened, she came to see me. She was having serioussuicidal thoughts. We agreed she should try ketamine infusions.Due to its hallucinogenic effects, ketamine has a reputation as a popular andillicit party drug, going by the nickname “Special K.” It dulls pain, and usersoften feel detached or dissociated from their own bodies. It was first developedin the 1960s as an anesthetic and was given to soldiers during the Vietnam War.The drug has also been used in emergency rooms for curbing suicidal thoughts,making it a potential lifesaver. It’s been put to use as an animal tranquilizeras well.In 2000, researchers started studying ketamine as a treatment for depression anddiscovered that it improves mood much faster than traditional antidepressantmedications and sometimes works when other drugs have failed. More than 100studies have shown that ketamine has antidepressant effects.[390] Unlikeantidepressants, which work by enhancing neurotransmitters like serotonin anddopamine, ketamine is thought to change the way brain cells talk to eachother —similar to a computer reboot or hardware fix. It blocks a type of brainreceptor thought to be involved with depression and pain, known as NMDA. Now, ina growing number of clinics, people with depression or pain for whom standardtreatments haven’t worked are being helped by a series of four to six infusions.Georgia didn’t like how she felt after the first treatment. Although ketaminemade her feel weird, I encouraged her to go through the six-session course, asnothing else was working. After the second session everything changed. Shecalled me and said she felt happy for the first time in decades. She feltenergetic, clearheaded, and sexual. The depression lifted, but she stillfinished all six sessions and continued with monthly booster infusions. Twoyears later she remains improved.Ketamine doesn’t work for everyone, and the science of it is still emerging. Butif you feel stuck, and nothing is working for serious depression or painsyndromes, it is worth considering.

More than 1,000 scientific studies show that neurofeedbackcan help a wide variety of mental health and brain-related conditions, such as * memory in healthy people[391] * memory poststroke[392] * ADHD[393] * obsessive-compulsive disorder[394] * depression[395] * traumatic brain injury[396] * addiction[397] * epilepsy[398] * pain[399] * balance in Parkinson’s patients[400]It can also help * improve putting in golf[401] * boost creativity in acting[402] and business[403]Your brain produces a number of brain-wave patterns: * delta waves (1–4 cycles per second) —very slow brain waves, seen mostly during sleep; high in traumatic brain injury and poor memory states * theta waves (5–7 cycles per second) —slow brain waves, seen during creativity, daydreaming, and twilight states; higher in ADHD, impulsivity, poor memory, and brain fog states * alpha waves (8–12 cycles per second) —brain waves seen during relaxed states * beta waves (13–20 cycles per second) —fast brain waves seen during focused, thinking, analytic states; higher in anxiety states * high beta waves (21–40 cycles per second) —fast brain waves seen during intense concentration or anxiety * gamma waves (>40 cycles per second) —very fast brain waves, often seen during meditation and creative statesThe basic neurofeedback technique uses behavioral reinforcement to help peoplechange their brain-wave state. The more they can concentrate and produce fastbeta brain waves, for example, the more rewards they can accrue. With AmenClinics’ neurofeedback equipment, a child or adult sits in front of a computermonitor with a biofeedback game. If he increases the beta activity or decreasesthe theta activity, the game continues. The game stops, however, when the playeris unable to maintain the desired brain-wave state. People find the activityfun, and we gradually shape their brain-wave pattern to a healthier or moreoptimal one. This treatment technique is not an overnight cure. You often haveto practice this form of biofeedback for 20 to 60 sessions to be able torecreate it on your own. But the results are worth it.AUDIOVISUAL ENTRAINMENT (AVE): BETTER YOUR BRAIN WITH SOUND AND LIGHTImagine sitting in a room at home with goggles and headphones on. Strobe lightsflicker through the goggles and pulses come through the headphones, bothdesigned to stimulate your mind. Our minds “think” in states of brain-wavefrequency, and changes in frequencies are based on brain activity. When westimulate the brain audiovisually with light and sound pulses, it begins tomimic or follow the same frequencies. This is called entrainment. In a sense,audiovisual entrainment (AVE) speaks to the mind in its own language —thelanguage of rhythmic frequency —using a special machine that produces light andsound. The science of brain-wave entrainment, which means your brain picks upthe rhythm in the environment, is one of the fastest-growing technologies inbrain enhancement.A review of 20 clinical studies concluded that AVE was helpful for peoplesuffering from cognitive functioning deficits, stress, anxiety, PMS, andbehavioral problems.[404] It has also been found to improve overall brainactivity[405] and help with * increasing brain blood flow[406] * sleep[407] * pain[408] * alleviating stress[409] * migraines[410] * depression[411]AVE can help improve your health on many levels: In studies, students showed anincrease in GPA, concentration, and memory; seniors benefited from improvedmemory, cognition, and balance, which results in fewer falls;[412] and adultsbenefited from improved academic, corporate, and sports performance. Researchpublications show AVE efficacy with ADHD, seizure disorders, substance abuse,autistic spectrum disorders, mild traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic stressdisorder, and depression.The idea of using rhythm and frequency to facilitate shifts in our brain isnothing new. From music to sunlight, sound and light have long played a centralrole in shaping our human consciousness. When we listen to music, certain songscan make us happy, sad, or irritated. Fast beats tend to speed up our brainwaves. Slow beats tend to slow down our brain waves. Through the amazing use ofAVE, we are able to stimulate the brain with rhythmic pulses of light and soundsat specific frequencies to purposefully guide the brain into differentbrain-wave patterns. I like AVE because it is so easy to use and cost-efficient,and you can use it in the comfort of your own home, on your own time.

Sometimes I can be really narrow-minded. But when a friendwho had severe, debilitating migraine headaches told me that being diagnosedwith and treated for Irlen syndrome completely cured her headaches, I needed toknow more.Helen Irlen, PhD, is a school psychologist. Back in the early 1980s she wasworking under a federal research grant with college-educated adults whostruggled with learning and reading difficulties. At that time she discoveredthat colored, filtered lenses could reduce stress on the brain and allow it tofunction better.Irlen syndrome is a visual processing problem, where certain colors of the lightspectrum tend to irritate the brain. It runs in families and is common aftertraumatic brain injuries. Anyone experiencing symptoms of anxiety, irritability,depression, or decreased concentration should be screened for Irlen syndrome.Common symptoms include * light sensitivity; being bothered by glare, sunlight, headlights, or streetlights * strain or fatigue with computer use * fatigue, headaches, mood changes, restlessness, or an inability to stay focused when in a room with bright or fluorescent lights * trouble reading words that are on white, glossy paper * words or letters shifting, shaking, blurring, moving, running together, disappearing, or becoming difficult to perceive while reading * difficulty reading music * feeling tense, tired, or sleepy when reading, or even getting headaches when reading * problems judging distance and difficulty with such things as escalators, stairs, ball sports, driving, or coordination * migraine headachesHeather, 42, had been in 10 car accidents when she came to see us for symptomsof ADHD, anxiety, and depression. During her history she told one of ourphysicians that she had trouble reading and fluorescent lights gave herheadaches. Suspecting Irlen syndrome, he sent her for an evaluation.When Heather was at the evaluation center, I got a call from one of my sisters,who had taken my nephew to be evaluated for Irlen syndrome at the same time.Several weeks earlier we had been together in Las Vegas for my birthday. We wereon our way to an arcade on the second floor when halfway up the escalator Inoticed my nephew was not next to me. He was still at the bottom of theescalator, having trouble getting on. He had depth-perception issues (commonwith Irlen syndrome), and rather than just walk onto the escalator like mostpeople, he stood anxiously at the bottom before finally, very carefully,stepping on. He also was having trouble in school and was anxious and irritable.He needed to be evaluated.I was with a patient when my sister called, so I didn’t answer my phone. Butwhen she called a second and third time, I thought my mother had died, and Ianswered, “What?”“Danny,” she said, “you can’t believe what just happened with one of yourpatients. Heather is here from your clinic, and when she put the Irlen lenseson, the doorknob came out from the door. The bookcase came out from the wall. Anoverweight man walked by, and she blurted out, ‘Potbelly.’ It was like she sawin 3-D for the first time.”When we saw Heather two weeks later, she was beaming. With the Irlen lenses, herfocus was better, her anxiety was reduced, and her mood had improved. Her priorbrain scan had been remarkably overactive, but the Irlen lenses significantlycalmed her brain.HEATHER’S “ACTIVE” BRAIN SPECT BEFOREActive SPECT scan showing large regions of activity in scattered areas.[images/Illustration-App.1.jpg]Excessive activity in many brain areasWHILE WEARING IRLEN LENSESActive SPECT scan showing less activity in all areas.[images/Illustration-App.2.jpg]Overall calming effectWe were all excited about Heather’s progress until a few weeks later when herphysician told me she was struggling with depression.“What happened?” I asked.“Like Paul Harvey always says,” he replied, “here’s the rest of the story. WhenHeather was a child, she was a prodigy guitar player. Apparently, she wasamazing and gave performances around the area where she lived. But she couldnever learn to read music because the notes would move and dance on the page. Atthe age of 12, she took the guitar by its throat and smashed it, and she neverplayed again. Now, 30 years later, she finds out that she has Irlen syndrome andis mourning the loss of what could have been.”Heather did not need Prozac to deal with the depression. She needed grieftherapy, which we gave her. Within a few weeks she was back to feeling great andbought herself a new guitar.

A QUICK MENTAL HEALTH CHECKUP--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive charactersare seared with scars.KHALIL GIBRAN--------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are common reasons why people struggle with how they feel. Issues such asanxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,addictions, posttraumatic stress disorder, and chronic stress are widespreadamong the population. According to the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention, almost 50 percent of the US population will suffer from a mentalhealth issue at some point in their lives.[413] It is almost more normal to havea problem than not to have a problem. If you picked up this book, odds are thatyou (or someone you love) have struggled at some point with how you felt.Knowing your specific vulnerabilities is critical to getting the right help.Only about one-third of people with depression or other mental health issuesever seek help. Asians, Hispanics, and African Americans are 30 percent lesslikely than whites to try to find assistance, and people age 60 and older arehalf as likely to seek treatment as those under 44.[414] This means that mostpeople who suffer with mental health challenges never get the help they need andsuffer unnecessarily when help is available.On pages 302–304 [appendix_2.xhtml#page_302] are several questionnaires thatwill help you pinpoint where you might be struggling, followed by some simplesuggestions to help you feel better fast. Please rate yourself on each of thesymptoms listed below using the following 0–4 scale. If possible, have anotherperson who knows you well (such as a spouse or parent) rate you too; this willgive you the most complete picture.

At Amen Clinics, we prefer natural treatments whenever possible, such as those discussed throughout the book, including a healthy diet, exercise, omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA and other supplements, meditation, and cognitive behavioral therapy. All have a strong research basis showing they are effective. But if these strategies don’t work, or faster results are needed, medications are important to consider. Here are research-based strategies to boost your mental health if you are struggling with * Anxiety * Brain-healthy habits (see chapter 2) * Exercise[415] (see chapter 4) * Hypnosis (see chapter 1) * Diaphragmatic breathing (see chapter 1) * Hand warming (see chapter 1) * Meditation (see chapter 1) * Calming music (see chapter 1) * ANT therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT; see chapter 5) * Supplements to boost GABA, such as GABA itself,[416] magnesium, and theanine from green tea[417] (see chapter 10) * Depression and Negativity —See my book Healing Anxiety and Depression for more detailed information on the seven types of anxiety/depression * Brain-healthy habits (see chapter 2) * Exercise[418] (see chapter 4) * Antioxidant-[419] and tomato-rich diet[420] (see chapter 9) * Omega-3 fatty acids —higher in EPA than DHA[421] (see chapter 10) * SAMe (s-adenosyl methionine) for depression,[422] especially in males[423] (see chapter 10) * Saffron[424] (see chapter 9) * Optimize vitamin D levels[425] (see chapter 10) * ANT therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT; see chapter 5)[426] * Acupuncture[427] * Medication, if necessary * Methylfolate (as an add-on treatment to antidepressant medication)[428] * Bipolar Disorder * Brain-healthy habits (see chapter 2) * Exercise[429] (see chapter 4) * Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA[430] (see chapter 10) * Medication, if necessary * ADHD —See my book Healing ADD for more detailed information on the seven types of ADD/ADHD, and take our free online test at www.ADDTypeTest.com [http://www.ADDTypeTest.com]. * Brain-healthy habits (see chapter 2) * Exercise[431] (see chapter 4) * Omega-3 fatty acids —higher in EPA than DHA[432] (see chapter 10) * Zinc[433] * Magnesium[434] * Iron (if ferritin levels are low)[435] * Phosphatidylserine[436] * Work with an ADHD coach * Medication, if necessary * PTSD * Brain-healthy habits (see chapter 2) * EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing;[437] visit www.emdria.org [http://www.emdria.org]) (see chapter 7) * Loving-Kindness Meditation[438] (see chapter 1) * Stress Management * Brain-healthy habits (see chapter 2) * Exercise[439] (see chapter 4) * Prayer[440] and mindfulness meditation[441] (see chapter 1) * If you struggle with worry, consider supplements to raise the neurotransmitter serotonin, such as 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) or saffron[442] 2. Try these research-proven tips. Use them to lower stress and boost your level of happiness and overall mental health. * Start every day with the words “Today is going to be a great day.” Your mind makes happen what it visualizes. When you start the day by saying these words, your brain will find the reasons it will be a great day. * Write down three things you are grateful for every day. Researchers found that people who did this significantly increased their sense of happiness in just three weeks.[443] * Every day, write down the name of one person you appreciate. Then tell him or her. Appreciation is gratitude expressed outwardly, and it builds positive bridges between people. * Limit screen time. Studies report a higher level of depression and obesity with increased time spent with technology. * Exercise —it is the fastest way to feel better. Go for a walk or a run. * Enjoy some dark chocolate. It can boost blood flow to your brain,[444] help improve your mood, and decrease anxiety. In one study, seniors who ate more of it had a lower incidence of dementia than those who ate less. * Listen to music. Just 25 minutes of Mozart or Strauss has been shown to lower blood pressure and stress. Listening to ABBA has also been shown to lower stress hormones —Mamma Mia![445] * Choose experiences that give you a sense of awe, such as looking at a sunset or something else beautiful in nature.[446] * Drink green tea, which contains L-theanine, an ingredient that helps you feel happier, more relaxed, and more focused.[447] * Read an inspiring, powerful novel.[448] * Take a walk in nature,[449] which is also associated with reducing worry.[450] * Go barefoot outside. It decreases anxiety and depression by 62 percent, according to one study.[451] * Listen to a sad song. Really. It was found to increase positive emotion.[452] Listening to lullabies and soothing music also decreased stress and improved sleep.[453] * Stop complaining! It rewires your brain to see the negative in way too many places.[454] * Spend time with positive people if you want to feel happy.[455] People’s moods are contagious. (If you want to feel depressed, hang out with gloomy people.) * Do something you love that brings you joy. For me, it is playing table tennis or spending time with my wife, kids, or grandkids. * Write down your five happiest experiences, and then imagine reliving them. * Engage in activities that make you feel competent.[456] * Be patient. People tend to be happier with age, especially if they take care of their brains.[457] * Learn to forgive; it can help reduce negative feelings.[458] * Help someone else or volunteer; people in one study who did felt happier.[459] And make time for friends.[460] * Get intimate with your spouse. Making love with a partner increased overall happiness and decreased stress hormones. In mice, it helped boost the hippocampus.[461] * Journal your feelings. It helps to get them out of your head and allows you to gain perspective.[462] * Learn to kill the ANTs (automatic negative thoughts). Whenever you feel sad, mad, nervous, or out of control, write down your negative thoughts. Next, ask yourself if they are really true or if they are a bit distorted, making you feel worse. Focusing your mind on positive, rational thoughts will help you feel much better.[413] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “CDC Report: Mental IllnessSurveillance among Adults in the United States,” CDC website, last editedDecember 2, 2011, https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealthsurveillance/fact_sheet.html[https://web.archive.org/web/20180801063522/https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealthsurveillance/fact_sheet.html].[414] Kaiser Permanente, “Only One-Third of Patients Diagnosed with DepressionStart Treatment: Likelihood of Beginning Treatment Is Especially Low amongEthnic and Racial Minorities and the Elderly,” ScienceDaily, February 8, 2018,www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180208141239.htm[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180208141239.htm].[415] C.

To that end, it is critical to know your importanthealth numbers. A fundamental business principle applies here: “You cannotchange what you do not measure.” You should check these numbers on an annualbasis and whenever you feel out of sorts.Body mass index (BMI). This measurement is the result of comparing weight toheight. An optimal BMI is between 18.5 and 25; the overweight range fallsbetween 25 and 30; more than 30 indicates obesity; and more than 40 indicatesmorbid obesity. To determine your BMI, google “BMI Calculator” and fill in yourheight and weight. Take this number seriously, because being overweight or obeseis associated with having a smaller brain, and when it comes to your brain, sizematters! Plus, obesity increases the risk for Alzheimer’s disease anddepression. In a new study, 40 percent of all cancers have been linked to excessweight.[463]Blood pressure. Good blood pressure is critical for brain health. High bloodpressure is associated with lower overall brain function, which means baddecision-making. The American Heart Association and the American College ofCardiology have revised their guidelines, which now means anyone with bloodpressure of 130/80 millimeters of mercury will be diagnosed with stage 1hypertension. Previously, a blood pressure of 140/90 was consideredhypertension. (The category of “prehypertension” no longer exists.) That meansmore Americans than ever —half of all men and 38 percent of women, or 103million people versus 72 million before this change —are now considered to havehypertension.[464] Here are the blood pressure numbers you should know: * Optimal * Systolic 90–120 * Diastolic 60–80 * Stage 1 Hypertension * Systolic 130–139 * Diastolic 80–89 * Stage 2 Hypertension * Systolic >/= 140 * Diastolic >/= 90 * Hypotension —blood pressure that is too low can also be a problem * Systolic < 90 * Diastolic < 60KEY LABORATORY TESTSLaboratory tests provide another set of important numbers. Ask your health careprofessional to order them, or you can order them for yourself at websites likewww.saveonlabs.com [http://www.saveonlabs.com]. If your numbers are abnormal, besure to work with your health care professional to get them into optimal ranges.Here are the key lab tests that will provide insights into how well your body isfunctioning. All are blood tests unless otherwise indicated.CBC (complete blood count). This blood test checks the health of your blood,including red and white blood cells. Low red blood cell count (anemia) can makeyou feel anxious and tired and can lead to memory problems. Enlarged red bloodcells may mean you are drinking too much alcohol. A high level of white bloodcells may indicate infection.General metabolic panel with fasting blood sugar and lipid panel. This checksthe health of your liver and kidneys, as well as your fasting blood sugar,cholesterol, and triglycerides.Knowing your fasting blood sugar number is especially important. * Normal is 70–100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) * Optimal is 70–89 mg/dL * Prediabetes is 100–125 mg/dL * Diabetes is 126 mg/dL or higherWhy is high fasting blood sugar a problem? Elevated blood sugar causes vascular(blood vessel) problems throughout your whole body, including your brain. Overtime, blood vessels become brittle and vulnerable to breaking. High blood sugarleads not only to diabetes, but also to heart disease, stroke, visualimpairment, impaired wound healing, wrinkled skin, and cognitive problems.Cholesterol and triglycerides (fats) in the blood are also important, especiallybecause they can negatively affect blood delivery to the brain. Cholesterol thatis either too high or too low is bad for the brain. Higher cholesterol later inlife has been associated with better cognitive performance,[465] longevity,[466]and a decreased risk of dementia. Normal levels are * Total cholesterol: 135–200 mg/dL (below 160 has been associated with depression, suicide, homicide, and death from all causes, so 160–200mg/dL is optimal) * HDL: >/= 60 mg/dL * LDL: <100 mg/dL * Triglycerides: <150 mg/dLIt is also important to know the particle size of your LDL cholesterol (ask yourhealth care professional to order this test) because smaller particles are moretoxic than larger ones. If your cholesterol numbers are not optimal and you wishto find out more, I recommend The Great Cholesterol Myth by Jonny Bowden, PhD,and Stephen Sinatra, MD.Hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c. This test, used to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes,is a measure of the average blood sugar levels for the prior two to threemonths. A result of 4–5.6 percent is normal for a nondiabetic; optimal is under5.3 percent. A result in the 5.7–6.4 percent range indicates prediabetes. Highernumbers may signal diabetes.Vitamin D. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with obesity,depression, cognitive impairment, heart disease, reduced immunity, cancer, andall causes of mortality. The best blood test to get measures the25-hydroxyvitamin D level. A normal vitamin D level is 30–100 nanograms (ng)/mL,with the most optimal range being 50–100 ng/mL.Thyroid panel. Abnormal thyroid hormone levels are a common cause of anxiety,depression, forgetfulness, weight problems, and lethargy. Having low thyroidlevels, or hypothyroidism, decreases overall brain activity, which can impairyour thinking, judgment, and self-control. Low thyroid functioning can also makeit nearly impossible to manage weight effectively. High levels (hyperthyroidism,less common than hypothyroidism) are associated with anxiety, insomnia, andfeeling agitated. Healthy thyroid levels are * TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone): 0.4–3.0 IU/L * Free T3: see normal ranges for the individual laboratory you use. * Free T4: see normal range for the individual laboratory you use. * Thyroid antibodies: thyroid peroxidase antibodies: < 9.0 IU/mL and thyroglobulin antibodies: < 4.0 IU/mLUnfortunately, there is no single symptom or test result that will properlydiagnose hypothyroidism. The key is to gather your symptoms and your blood testresults and consult with your physician. Symptoms of low thyroid includefatigue, depression, mental fog, dry skin, hair loss (especially the outer thirdof your eyebrows), feeling cold when others feel normal, constipation, hoarsevoice, and weight gain.C-reactive protein (CRP). This test measures the inflammation in your body.Inflammation comes from the Latin word for “to set on fire” and describes aprocess associated with many chronic illnesses, including depression, dementia,and pain syndromes. A healthy CRP range is 0.0–1.0 mg/dL.Homocysteine. Elevated homocysteine levels (>8 micromoles/liter) are associatedwith atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries) and an increasedrisk of heart attack, stroke, blood clot formation, and possibly Alzheimer’sdisease. Homocysteine is also a sensitive marker for a folate deficiency (folateis required for producing DNA and other genetic material).Ferritin. This is a measure of iron stores. High levels are associated withinflammation and insulin resistance. Low levels are associated with anemia,restless leg syndrome, ADHD, and low motivation and energy. A level of 50–100ng/mL is ideal. Women often have lower iron stores than men, due to blood lossfrom menstruation. Some theorize that this is one of the reasons that women tendto live longer than men. If your level is low, consider taking iron. If it ishigh, donating blood may help.Free and total serum testosterone. For both men and women, low levels oftestosterone have been associated with low energy, cardiovascular disease,obesity, low libido, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease.Normal levels for adult males are * Total testosterone: 280–800 ng/dL; optimal is 500–800 ng/dL * Free testosterone: 7.2–24 picograms (pg)/mL; optimal is 12–24 pg/mLNormal levels for adult females are * Total testosterone: 6–82 ng/dL; optimal is 40–82 ng/dL * Free testosterone: 0.0–2.2 pg/mL; optimal 1.0–2.2 pg/mLEstrogen and progesterone for women. Depending on the circumstances, these aremeasured in blood or saliva. Menstruating women are usually tested on day 21 oftheir cycle, while postmenopausal women can be measured anytime. Estrogen isresponsible for vaginal lubrication and helps with libido and memory —and somuch more. Progesterone calms emotions, contributes to a restful sleep, and actsas a diuretic. See the normal ranges for the individual laboratory you use.Omega-3 Index. This measures the total amount of omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHAin red blood cells and directly reflects their levels in the brain. The test isa clinically validated biomarker of the health of your brain. Your risk ofcognitive decline rises by as much as 77 percent when your Omega-3 Index is low.Aim for a level above 8 percent.Knowing and optimizing these numbers is critical to helping your brain workright. If any of them are abnormal, the function of your brain can be troubledtoo. Work with your health care provider to help get these numbers into the mostoptimal range possible.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Get in the habit of checking out your important health numbers on an annualbasis.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[463] “Cancers Associated with Overweight and Obesity Make Up 40 Percent ofCancers Diagnosed in the United States,” Centers for Disease Control andPrevention website, October 3, 2017,https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p1003-vs-cancer-obesity.html[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p1003-vs-cancer-obesity.html].[464] G.
