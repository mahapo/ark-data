I amgrateful to my agent, Faith Hamlin, whose wisdom and love helped focus andnourish the book. I also feel blessed to have Betsy Rapoport as my editor atTimes Books. She truly understood the significance of this book and helped mepresent the ideas in a clear, accessible way. Also, I very much appreciate thestaff at Times Books, who have been deeply committed to this project.This book would not have been possible without the staff at the Amen Clinic.From the front-office staff to the staff clinicians I consider these people partof my family and feel grateful to have their love, dedication, knowledge, andwisdom. I am especially grateful to Shelley Bernhard, the clinic manager, whokeeps all of us on track; to Lucinda Tilley, my assistant, who prepared all theimages in the book and spent many hours in research; to Bob Gessler, who isalways willing to help and pitch in; and to the forward-thinking staffphysicians and clinical staff, Stanley Yantis, Jennifer Lendl, Jonathan ScottHalverstadt, Ronnette Leonard, Lewis Van Osde!, Cecil Oakes, MatthewStubblefield, Ed Spencer, Brian Goldman, Jane Massengill, Lloyd King, and CoraDavidson.In addition, I so much appreciate my friends and colleagues Earl Henslin, SheilaKrystal, and Linda and Leon Webber for reading the manuscript and givingfeedback.Finally, my gratitude and love go to my family, who have lived through my brainresearch for the past ten years. I know that many times they were tired oflistening about the brain and SPECT imaging but nonetheless loved me anyway andgave me the limbic connectedness necessary to live and make a difference in thelives of others."},{"pageContent":"leaf 13 [images/leaf-image0013.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"12.

It is the hardware of your very essenceas a human being. You cannot be who you really want to be unless your brainworks right. How your brain works determines how happy you are, how effectiveyou feel, and how well you interact with others. Your brain patterns help you(or hurt you) with your marriage, parenting skills, work, and religious beliefs,along with your experiences of pleasure and pain. If you are anxious, depressed,obsessive-compulsive, prone to anger, or easily distracted, you probably believethese problems are \"all in your head.\" In other words, you believe your problemis purely psychological. However, research that I and others have done showsthat the problems are related to the physiology of the brain—and the good newsis that we have proof that you can change that physiology. You can fix what'swrong for many problems.Until very recently, scientists could only speculate about the brain's role inour personality and decision-making skills. We did not have advanced tools tolook at the functioning of the brain and thus made many false assumptions aboutits impact on our lives. With the advent of sophisticated brain-imagingtechniques, we are now answering questions about the brain's role in behavior ata phenomenal pace, questions that have practical applicability to your life,from relationships at home and at work to understanding what makes you a uniquebeing.I have been involved in brain-imaging research for the past ten years. I firstbegan studying the brain with sophisticated quantitative EEG (brain wave)studies, and in the last eight years I've used a nuclear medicine brain studycalled SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography), which measurescerebral blood flow and metabolic activity patterns. These last ten years havebeen both ex-hilarating and frustrating. They have been exhilarating because through thesestudies we now have visual evidence of brain patterns that correlate withbehavior, such as tendencies toward depression, anxiety, distractability,obsessiveness, and violence. This physical evidence of phenomena mostly thoughtof as purely \"psychological\" in origin has revolutionized the way others and Ipractice psychiatric medicine. We can now show patients and their families thephysical \"brain\" evidence of problems, helping them to be more accepting andcompliant with treatment. We have more information to make more effectivetreatment decisions with complex cases than ever before. And we use theinformation from this research to educate the public on the effects of drugabuse, head injuries, and even \"negative thinking\" on the brain. This has beentruly an amazing time.It has also been a frustrating time because dissemination of these new insightshas been slower than I would like. There is natural resistance in the scientificcommunity to dramatic shifts in thinking. Once a scientist uncovers newinformation, it needs to go through a peer review process that can take years.I'm pleased that the brain-imaging work I and others have pioneered iscontinuing to gain acceptance from the medical and scientific community. In themeantime, the knowledge gained from this research is helping people across NorthAmerica. It can help you too.SEEING IS BELIEVINGI was not a brain-imaging researcher by design. After medical school at OralRoberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, I did my psychiatric internship andresidency at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. I alwaysbelieved that there was a strong connection between spiritual health and mentalhealth. Nothing in my training dissuaded me from that idea, but little did Iknow that the connection could go both ways. I then did a fellowship in childand adolescent psychiatry in Honolulu, Hawaii, where I learned how stressfulearly beginnings could set up lifelong problems. In Hawaii I began to writeabout applying mental health principles to everyday life (in relationships, atwork, and within ourselves). I wanted to teach large groups of people how to bemore effective day to day. On the basis of my work, I was selected as a fellowin the prestigious Group for Advancement of Psychiatry and received a researchaward from the American Psychiatric Association.In 1986,1 wrote a program titled Breaking Through: How to Be Effective EverySingle Day of Your Life, about identifying and overcoming behaviors that holdpeople back from success. The program has been extremely helpful for thousandsof readers, yet many people needed more. As I worked with groups across thecountry and patients in my practice, using the principles in the program, manywould experience very positive changes (within themselves, their relationships,and their work), but others didn't seem to get the help they needed. These\"resistant\" cases were very frustrating to me. I continually asked myself, whatwas the difference between the people who benefited from the program and thosewho didn't? Were some people ready to change and others not? Were some peoplejust resistant to change because of deep-rooted psychological reasons? Was theprogram good for only certain personality types and not others? I searched foranswers. When the answer hit me, the course I had set for my life changed.In 1990,1 was working in a psychiatric hospital in Fairfield, California (fortymiles northeast of San Francisco). I was the director of the dual-diagnosistreatment unit (caring for people with both substance abuse and psychiatricproblems) and saw other patients as well. One day at grand rounds, I heard Dr.Jack Paldi, a local nuclear medicine physician, give a lecture on brain SPECTimaging. SPECT studies are nuclear medicine studies that measure blood flow andactivity levels in the brain. Dr. Paldi showed \"functional\" brain images ofpeople who had problems with dementia, depression, schizophrenia, and headinjuries and compared them with the images of normal brains. I wondered if thebrain were the missing piece of the puzzle in my resistant patients. Perhaps, Ihypothesized, the people who were struggling had brains that could not \"run\" thenew programs I was trying to give them, much like a computer cannot runsophisticated software unless it has enough speed and memory. One of the thingsthat amazed me about Dr. Paldi's lecture was that he showed brain images beforeand after treatment. Treatment with medication actually changed the physicalfunctioning of the brain! I wanted to know more.The same week Dr. Paldi gave the lecture, Alan Zametkin, M.D., from the NationalInstitutes of Health published an article in the New England Journal of Medicineon the use of PET (positron emission tomography) studies, in adults withattention deficit disorder (ADD). Since ADD was one of my specialties, thearticle reallycaught my interest. Dr. Zametkin demonstrated that when adults with ADD try toconcentrate, there is decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex, rather thanthe expected increase seen in normal \"control\" adults. Here was physicalevidence of a problem many people thought was psychological! A third event thatweek helped me integrate what I'd learned: I met Sally.Sally, a forty-year-old woman, had been hospitalized under my care fordepression, anxiety, and suicidal ideas. In my clinical interview with her, Idiscovered that she had many adult ADD symptoms (such as a short attention span,distractibility, disorganization, and restlessness). She had a son with ADD (afrequent tip to diagnosing ADD in adults). Despite her IQ of 140, she had neverfinished college, and she was employed below her ability as a laboratorytechnician. I decided to order a SPECT study on Sally. Sally's studies wereabnormal. At rest, she had good overall brain activity, especially in theprefrontal cortex. But when she was asked to perform math problems (an exerciseto challenge her ability to concentrate), she had marked decreased activityacross her whole brain, especially in the prefrontal cortex! With thatinformation, I placed her on a low dose of Ritalin (methylphenidate), a brainstimulant used to treat ADD in children and adults. She had a wonderfulresponse. Her mood was better, she was less anxious, and she could concentratefor longer periods of time. She eventually went back to school and finished herdegree. No longer did she think of herself as an underachiever, but rather assomeone who needs treatment for a medical problem. Seeing the SPECT pictures wasvery powerful for Sally. She said, \"Having ADD is not my fault. It's a medicalproblem, just like someone who needs glasses.\" Sally's experience led me tobelieve that SPECT might have a powerful application in decreasing the stigmamany patients feel when they are diagnosed with emotional, learning, or behaviorproblems. Sally could see that the problem wasn't \"all in her head.\" The scanand her response to medication changed her whole perception of herself.With Sally's enthusiasm and positive response to treatment fresh in my mind, Iordered more SPECT studies on my most resistant patients. Many patients,previously \"treatment failures,\" began to get better when I identified throughSPECT the part of their brain that wasn't working and targeted treatment to thatarea. After that series of events in 1990, my colleagues and I began to doclinical research with SPECT on a wide variety of patients. Our researchconfirmed the work of others and expanded the body of knowledge in new di-IntroductionSally's SPECT Studiespicture0 [images/picture0.jpg]picture1 [images/picture1.jpg]horizontal view at restNote good prefrontal activity (arrows).horizontal view during concentrationNote marked decreased activity, especially in the prefrontal cortex.rections, especially in the areas of violence, obsessiveness, and \"difficultpersonality temperaments.\"In doing this research, I have seen with my own eyes the brain SPECT patternsthat show abnormalities that interfere with behavior. These brain abnormalitiessabotage my patients' efforts to improve their lives and send interrupt signalsto the changes they try to make. / have seen how correcting (normalizing)abnormal brain function can change peoples lives, even their very souls. Personafter person who had previously been a treatment failure began to improvethrough prescriptions targeted at optimizing the brain's physical functioning.This was such a simple concept: When your brain worlds right, so can you. Whenyour brain doesn't wor\\ right, neither can you. The implication was profound:Various parts of the brain influence our behavior. Using SPECT studies, I wasmore effective at pinpointing trouble spots and providing more appropriateinterventions. Seeing these scans caused me to challenge many of my basicbeliefs about people, character, free will, and good and evil that had beeningrained in me as a Catholic schoolboy.When the physical functioning of the brain was optimized through the use ofmedications, nutrition, and targeted psychological exercises, people who hadpreviously been unable to change developed a capacity for new skills andbehaviors. They developed more access to productive brain activity and moreability to make changes(even though they had always had the will to change). A major shift occurred inmy thinking, uncovering new possibilities for the patients who had been \"leftbehind.\"Over the next eight years, I conducted more than five thousand brain studies.The lessons from the brain taught me that without optimal brain function, it ishard to be successful in any aspect of life, whether it is in relationships,work, schooling, feelings about yourself, or even your feelings about God—nomatter how hard you try. Indeed, the first step to being successful is tounderstand and optimize the working patterns of the brain. By enhancing thephysical functioning of the brain I also enhance my patients' potential forsuccess in every area of their lives. First, optimize the hardware and circuitryof the brain; then put in new programs. The brain-imaging work provided insightsthat have revolutionized the way I understand and treat patients. These insightsare the foundation of this book.I am one of only a handful of psychiatrists in the world who are licensed innuclear brain imaging. Currently, I am the medical director of a largeneuropsychiatric clinic in northern California, forty miles northeast of SanFrancisco. My clinic sees approximately eight hundred patients a month forevaluation and treatment. We see patients from around the globe, and we arerecognized as experts in the fields of attention deficit disorder, learningdisabilities, head trauma, violence, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Eventhough I am a rarity among psychiatrists, I believe what I do will be morecommonplace in the years to come. It is just too helpful and too exciting to beconfined to only a few clinics.FOCUS OF THE BOOKThe purpose of this book is to explain how the brain works, what happens whenthings go wrong, and how to optimize brain function. You will be introduced tofive of the brain systems that are most intimately involved with our behaviorand make up much of what is uniquely human.You'll learn that the deep limbic system, at the center of the brain, is thebonding and mood control center. Being connected to others is essential tohumanity, yet when this part of the brain is off kilter, people struggle withmoodiness and negativity. You'll learn how certain smells and clear thinkingsoothe the activity in this part of the brain,and why spending time with positive people is essential to deep limbic health.The basal ganglia, large structures deep within the brain, control the body'sidling speed. When this part of the brain works too hard, anxiety, panic,fearfulness, and conflict avoidance are often the result. As I describe in thebook, I inherited overactive basal ganglia, which leave me vulnerable to anxietyand nervousness. I know personally that anxiety is no fun and will give youplenty of ideas on how to settle down this part of the brain. When it isunderactive, people often struggle with concentration and fine motor controlproblems.The prefrontal cortex, at the front tip of the brain, is your supervisor, thepart of the brain that helps you stay focused, make plans, control impulses, andmake good (or bad) decisions. When this part of the brain is underactive, peoplehave problems supervising themselves and also have significant problems withattention span, focus, organization, and follow-through. Learning how toactivate the prefrontal cortex in a positive way leads to better internalsupervision.The cingulate (pronounced sing-u-lat), a part of the brain that runslongitudinally through the middle part of the frontal lobes, is the part of thebrain I call your \"gear shifter.\" It allows you to shift attention from thoughtto thought and between behaviors. When this part of the brain is overactive,people have problems getting stuck in certain loops of thoughts or behaviors.Understanding its function will help you deal with repetitive worries. Dealingwith worry, rigidity, and \"overfocused\" behavior in yourself or others will beeasier after reading this book.Lastly, the temporal lobes, underneath the temples and behind the eyes, areinvolved with memory, understanding language, facial recognition, and tempercontrol. When there are problems, especially in the left temporal lobe, peopleare more prone to temper flare-ups, rapid mood shifts, and memory and learningproblems. Optimizing this part of the brain may help you experience inner peacefor the first time in your life.It is important to note that none of these brain systems exists in a vacuum.They are intricately interconnected. Whenever you affect one system, you'relikely to affect the others as well. Also, some brain researchers would separatethe systems differently than I lay them out in this book, placing the cingulatesystem and deep temporal lobes within the limbic system. I am presenting thesystem we use in my clinic, which has worked so well for our patients.Presenting and defining these five terms—prefrontal cortex, cin-gulate system,deep limbic system, basal ganglia, and temporal lobes—is about as technical asthe book gets. Mastering these systems will give you a whole new view about whyyou do what you do and what you can do about it.After I describe each brain system, I'll offer targeted behavioral, cognitive,medicinal, and nutritional prescriptions to optimize its function. Theseprescriptions are practical, simple, and effective. They are based on myexperience with more than sixty thousand patient visits to my clinic over thepast ten years, as well as the experiences and research of my colleagues.Some people might wonder if readers should be the ones identifying and changingbrain problems. My answer is an emphatic yes! I believe it benefits almosteveryone to know as much about how his or her own brain works as possible. Mostof the problems discussed in this book, such as moodiness, anxiety,irritability, inflexibility, and worrying, are faced by large numbers of thepopulation. Most do not require professional help, but rather effective,brain-based prescriptions to optimize the brain's effectiveness. Since the braincontrols our behavior, optimizing its function can help nearly anyone's abilityto be more effective in life.This book will also make it clear that if your ability to function in everydaylife is significantly impaired (at school, at work, or in relationships), it isimportant to seek appropriate help from a competent professional. Lettingproblems fester untreated can ruin a life. But given the fact that there areover 250 different kinds of psychological therapies available in the UnitedStates, seeking the right help can be complicated and downright confusing. Inthis book I will provide guidance and resources on how to seek appropriate helpwhen it's needed.Researching the brain has been my greatest personal challenge. In 1993, when Ifirst started to talk at medical meetings about the discoveries we were makingat our clinic, some colleagues severely criticized us, saying we could not inferbehavioral patterns from brain patterns. Their lack of enthusiasm over thisexciting technology bothered me, but it did not dissuade me from work. What Iwas seeing in the brain was real and changed the lives of many patients. But Idid not like the adversarial environment of those meetings and decided to keep alow profile, expecting others would do the research. Then nine-year-old Andrewcame into my clinic.Andrew is a very special child. He is my godson and nephew. Until about a yearand a half before he came to my clinic as a patient, he had been happy andactive. But then his personality changed. He appeared depressed. He had seriousaggressive outbursts and he complained to his mother of suicidal and homicidalthoughts (very abnormal for a nine-year-old). He drew pictures of himselfhanging from a tree. He drew pictures of himself shooting other children. Whenhe attacked a little girl on the baseball field for no particular reason, hismother called me late at night in tears. I told Sherrie to bring Andrew to seeme the next day. His parents drove straight to my clinic, which was eight hoursfrom their home in Southern California.As I sat with Andrew's parents and then with Andrew I knew something wasn'tright. I had never seen him look so angry or so sad. He had no explanations forhis behavior. He did not report any form of abuse. Other children were notbullying him. There was no family history of serious psychiatric illnesses. Hehad not sustained a recent head injury. Unlike in most clinical situations, Iknew firsthand that he had a wonderful family. Andrew's parents were loving,caring, pleasant people. What was the matter?The vast majority of my psychiatric colleagues would have placed Andrew on somesort of medication and had him see a counselor for psychotherapy. Havingperformed more than one thousand SPECT studies by that time, I first wanted apicture of Andrew's brain. I wanted to know what we were dealing with. But withthe hostility from my colleagues fresh in my mind, I wondered whether Andrew'sproblem wasn't completely psychological. Perhaps there was a family problem thatI just didn't know about. Maybe Andrew was acting out because his older brotherwas a \"perfect\" child who did well in school and was very athletic. Maybe Andrewhad these thoughts and behaviors to ward off feelings of insecurity related tobeing the second son in a Lebanese family (I had personal knowledge of thisscenario). Maybe Andrew wanted to feel powerful and these behaviors wereassociated with issues of control. Then logic took over my mind. Nine-year-oldchildren do not normally think about suicide or homicide. I needed to scan hisbrain. If it was normal, then we would look further for underlying emotionalproblems.I went with Andrew to the imaging center and held his hand while he had thestudy performed. Andrew sat in a chair while the technician placed a smallintravenous needle in his arm. Several min-Andrew's Missing Left Temporal Lobepicture2 [images/picture2.jpg]picture3 [images/picture3.jpg]3-D underside surface viewAndrew's brain Normal study Missing left temporal lobeutes later a very small dose of a radioisotope was injected through the needlewhile Andrew played a concentration game on a laptop computer. Shortlythereafter, the needle was taken out of his arm and he went into the imagingroom next door. He climbed onto the SPECT table and lay on his back. The imagingcamera took fifteen minutes to rotate slowly around his head. As his brainappeared on the computer screen, I thought there had been a mistake inperforming the procedure. Andrew had no left temporal lobe! Upon quickexamination of the complete study, I realized the quality of the scan was fine.He was indeed missing his left temporal lobe. Did he have a cyst, a tumor, aprior stroke? A part of me felt scared for him as I was looking at the monitor.Another part of me felt relieved that we had some explanation for his aggressivebehavior. My research and the research of others had implicated the lefttemporal lobe in aggression. The next day Andrew had an MRI (an anatomical brainstudy) which showed a cyst (a fluid-filled sac) about the size of a golf balloccupying the space where his left temporal lobe should have been. I knew thecyst had to be removed. Getting someone to take this seriously provedfrustrating, however.That day I called Andrew's pediatrician and informed him of the clinicalsituation and brain findings. I told him to find the best person possible totake this thing out of Andrew's head. He contacted three pediatric neurologists.All of them said that Andrew's negative behavior was probably not in any wayrelated to the cyst in his brainand they would not recommend operating on him until he had \"real symptoms.\" Whenthe pediatrician relayed this information, I became furious. Real symptoms! Ihad a child with homicidal and suicidal thoughts who was losing control over hisbehavior and attacking people. I contacted a pediatric neurologist in SanFrancisco, who told me the same thing. I then called a friend of mine at HarvardMedical School, also a pediatric neurologist, who told me yet again the samething. She even used the words \"real symptoms.\" I practically jumped down herthroat; how more real could Andrew's symptoms be? \"Oh, Dr. Amen,\" theneurologist replied, \"when I say 'real symptoms,' I mean symptoms like seizuresor speech problems.\" Could the medical profession really not connect the brainto behavior? I was appalled! But I wasn't going to wait until this child killedhimself or someone else. I called pediatric neurosurgeon Jorge Lazareff at UCLAand told him about Andrew. He told me that he had operated on three otherchildren with left temporal lobe cysts who had all been aggressive. He wonderedif it was related. Thankfully, after evaluating Andrew, he agreed to remove thecyst.When Andrew woke up from the surgery, he smiled at his mother. It was the firsttime in a year that he had smiled. His aggressive thoughts were gone, and histemperament changed back to that of the sweet child he had been before the ageof seven. Andrew was lucky. He had someone who loved him paying attention to hisbrain when his behavior was off. With this very personal experience in my heart,I decided that I had to share our SPECT work with a larger audience, no matterhow much criticism came my way. There were too many children, teenagers, andadults like Andrew who had clear brain abnormalities whom society was justwriting off as bad human beings.Now, only a few years later, the situation has come full circle. I havepresented the information in this book to thousands of medical and mental healthprofessionals across North America: in medical schools, at national medicalmeetings, and even at the prestigious National Institutes of Health. I havepublished much of this research in chapters in medical books and in journalarticles. In 1996 I was invited to give the State of the Art Lecture in Medicineto the Society of Developmental Pediatrics. Clearly there is much more researchto do, but many of my colleagues are beginning to see that this work can changeour understanding of why people do what they do and give guidance for a new wayof thinking about and healing people hurting from detectable and correctablebrain abnormalities.This book will teach you that human behavior is more complexthan society's damning labels would have us believe. We are far too quick toattribute people's actions to a bad character when the source of their actionsmay not be their choice at all, but a problem with brain physiology. One teenageboy, for example, who was brought in to see me for both suicidal and violenttendencies, had a temporal lobe problem that responded positively to antiseizuremedication. He was not a \"bad kid\" after all. As he told his mother later, \"Ialways wanted to be polite, but my brain wouldn't let me.\" How many \"bad kids\"sitting in juvenile hall would prove to be perfectly nice people with the righttreatment? Sometimes people aren't being loving, industrious, cheerful,peaceful, obedient, or kind not because they wouldn't like to be, but becausesomething is wrong with their brain, something that is potentially fixable.When a person gets treatment that doesn't work, either because the diagnosis iswrong or the operating theory of the therapist is outdated, things get worse.People wonder, \"What is wrong with me? Am I not trying hard enough? Am I notgood enough? Am I not meant to be happy or well? I am even a failure at gettinghelp for myself.\" I have found that most people indeed want to be better. Whenthey struggle, it is most often not for a lack of trying, thinking, ormotivation. For many people, we as professionals just didn't have the rightanswers.Until recently, scientists had no sophisticated tools for evaluating a workingbrain. Standard brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans and CAT(computerized axial tomography) scans, available since the 1970s, are anatomicalstudies, and although they can evaluate what a brain looks like physically, theycannot provide information on how well the brain works. EEGs(electroencephalograms) help in some cases by measuring electrical activity inthe brain, but this information provides little sophisticated information on theworkings of the deep structures in the brain. SPECT studies, on the other hand,show very nicely what happens in various parts of the brain when you try toactivate them. With this tool, I and my colleagues around the country have beenable to correlate over- and under-functioning of different brain parts withcertain abnormal behaviors in patients. Also available at this time are twoother sophisticated brain studies that are also very useful for studying brainfunction, functional MRI (fMRI) and PET (positron emission tomography). Each onehas its advantages and disadvantages. At this time, in my opinion, due to cost,ease of use, and availability, SPECT is our diagnostic tool of choice.It is important to note that having an abnormal SPECT scan is not an excuse for\"bad behavior.\" SPECT adds to our knowledge about and understanding of behavior,but it does not provide all the answers. Many people who have difficulties intheir brains never do anything harmful or destructive to others. These scansneed to be interpreted in the context of each clinical situation.Not all scientists will agree with every finding in this book. The informationhere is based largely on extensive clinical experience and research. The BrainImaging Division of the Amen Clinic for Behavioral Medicine has done more brainSPECT studies for psychiatric reasons than any other clinic I know of in theworld. Experience is one of the best teachers in medicine. Second, I have hadthe privilege of working closely with a nuclear medicine physician, Jack Paldi,who has a passion for applying his knowledge to psychiatry. Third, we have hadthe use of one of the best SPECT cameras available, which provides more andbetter information than older cameras.The purpose of this book is not to encourage readers to go out and get theirbrains scanned. You don't need a SPECT scan to benefit from this book. In fact,if you go to a medical center that has little experience with SPECT, the resultsare not likely to mean much to your doctor. My goal is to help explain a widevariety of human behaviors, both aberrant and normal, by showing the images ofthe brain that SPECT provides. These images make it plain that many problemslong thought of as psychiatric in nature—depression, panic disorders, attentiondeficit disorders—are actually medical problems that can be treated using amedical model, along with the traditional psychological and sociological models.I hope that by providing new insights into how the brain works, you'll gain adeeper understanding of your own feelings and behavior and the feelings andbehaviors of others. And I hope you'll use the specific brain-based\"prescriptions\" to optimize the patterns in the brain to help you be moreeffective in your day-to-day life."},{"pageContent":"For Those Who Have Eyes, Let Them See:Images Into the MindWhat is SPECT? An acronym for single photon amission computerized tomography, itis a sophisticated nuclear medicine study that \"looks\" directly at cerebralblood flow and indirectly at brain activity (or metabolism). In this study, aradioactive isotope (which, as we will see, is akin to myriad beacons of energyor light) is bound to a substance that is readily taken up by the cells in thebrain.A small amount of this compound is injected into the patient's vein, where itruns through the bloodstream and is taken up by certain receptor sites in thebrain. The radiation exposure is similar to that of a head CT or an abdominal Xray. The patient then lies on a table for about fifteen minutes while a SPECT\"gamma\" camera rotates slowly around his head. The camera has special crystalsthat detect where the compound (signaled by the radioisotope acting like abeacon of light) has gone. A supercomputer then reconstructs offline images ofbrain activity levels. The elegant brain snapshots that result offer us asophisticated blood flow/metabolism brain map. With these maps, physicians havebeen able to identify certain patterns of brain activity that correlate withpsychiatric and neurological illnesses.SPECT studies belong to a branch of medicine called nuclear medicine. Nuclear(refers to the nucleus of an unstable or radioactive atom) medicine usesradioactively tagged compounds (radiopharmaceuticals). The unstable atoms emitgamma rays as they decay, witheach gamma ray acting like a beacon of light. Scientists can detect those gammarays with film or special crystals and can record an accumulation of the numberof beacons that have decayed in each area of the brain. These unstable atoms areessentially tracking devices— they track which cells are most active and havethe most blood flow and those that are least active and have the least bloodflow. SPECT studies actually show which parts of the brain are activated when weconcentrate, laugh, sing, cry, visualize, or perform other functions.Nuclear medicine studies measure the physiological functioning of the body, andthey can be used to diagnose a multitude of medical conditions: heart disease,certain forms of infection, the spread of cancer, and bone and thyroid disease.My own area of expertise in nuclear medicine, the brain, uses SPECT studies tohelp in the diagnosis of head trauma, dementia, atypical or unresponsive mooddisorders, strokes, seizures, the impact of drug abuse on brain function, andatypical or unresponsive aggressive behavior.During the late '70s and '80s SPECT studies were replaced in many cases by thesophisticated anatomical CAT and later MRI studies. The resolution of thosestudies was far superior to SPECT's in delineating tumors, cysts, and bloodclots. In fact, they nearly eliminated the use of SPECT studies altogether. Yetdespite their clarity, CAT scans and MRIs could offer only images of a staticbrain and its anatomy; they gave little or no information on the activity in aworking brain. It was analogous to looking at the parts of a car's enginewithout being able to turn it on. In the last decade, it has become increasinglyrecognized that many neurological and psychiatric disorders are not disorders ofthe brain's anatomy, but problems in how it functions.Two technological advancements have encouraged the use, once again, of SPECTstudies. Initially, the SPECT cameras were single-headed, and they took a longtime—up to an hour—to scan a person's brain. People had trouble holding stillthat long, and the images were fuzzy, hard to read (earning nuclear medicine thenickname \"unclear medicine\"), and did not give much information about thefunctioning deep within the brain. Then multiheaded cameras were developed thatcould image the brain much faster and with enhanced resolution. The advancementof computer technology also allowed for improved data acquisition from themultiheaded systems. The higher-resolution SPECT studies of today can see intothe deeper areas of the brain with far greater clarity and show what CAT scansand MRIs cannot—how the brain actually functions.SPECT studies can be displayed in a variety of different ways. Traditionally thebrain is examined in three different planes: horizontally (cut from top tobottom), coronally (cut from front to back), and sagittally (cut from side toside). What do physicians see when they look at a SPECT study? We examine it forsymmetry and activity levels, indicated by shades of color (in different colorscales selected depending on the physician's preference, including gray scales),and compare it to what we know a normal brain looks like. The black-and-whiteimages in this book are mostly two kinds of three-dimensional (3-D) images ofthe brain.One kind is a 3-D surface image, looking at the blood flow of the brain'scortical surface. These images are helpful for picking up areas of good activityas well as underactive areas. They are helpful when investigating, for instance,strokes, brain trauma, and the effects of drug abuse. A normal 3-D surface scanshows good, full, symmetrical activity across the brain's cortical surface.The 3-D active brain image compares average brain activity to the hottest 15percent of activity. These images are helpful for picking up areas ofoveractivity, as seen, for instance, in active seizures, obsessive-compulsivedisorder, anxiety problems, and certain forms of depression. A normal 3-D activescan shows increased activity (seen by the light color) in the back of the brain(the cerebellum and visual or occipital cortex) and average activity everywhereelse (shown by the background grid).Physicians are usually alerted that something is wrong in one of three ways:they see too much activity in a certain area; they see too little activity in acertain area; or they see asymmetrical areas of activity that ought to besymmetrical.In the rest of the book, I will go into greater detail about how this remarkabletechnology has touched people's lives. For now, however, I will simply offer asample of five common ways in which SPECT studies are utilized in medicine.1. To maJ^e early intervention possible. Ellen, sixty-three, was suddenlyparalyzed on the right side of her body. Unable even to speak, she was in apanic and her family was extremely concerned. As drastic as these symptoms were,two hours after the event, her CAT scan was still normal. Suspecting a stroke,the emergency room physician ordered a brain SPECT study that showed a hole ofactivity in her left frontal lobe caused by a clot that had choked off the bloodsupply to this part of the brain. From this information, it was clear that Ellenhad had a stroke, and her doctors were able to take measures toNormal 3-D Brain SPECT Studiestop frontpicture4 [images/picture4.jpg]front top-down surface viewtopbottom front-on surface viewbac\\ underside surface viewtopfrontpicture5 [images/picture5.jpg]bottom side surface viewbottom side active viewbac\\topfrontpicture6 [images/picture6.jpg]front top-down active viewbottom front-on active viewbac\\ underside active viewIn the last four images the outline grid indicates average activity in thebrain; the light color indicates the most active 15 percent of the brain.

CAT scans are generally not abnormal untiltwenty-four hours after a stroke.2. To evaluate the patient accurately so that future illness can be prevented.Nancy was a fifty-nine-year-old woman suffering from severe depression that hadbeen nonresponsive to treatment. She was admitted to a psychiatric hospital,where a SPECT study was done to evaluate her condition. Since she had notexperienced any symptoms that would point to this, I was surprised to see thatshe had had two large strokes. Nearly immediately her nonresponsive depressionNancy's Brain, Affected by Two Strokespicture8 [images/picture8.jpg]3-D top-down surface view 3-D right-side surface viewNotice the two large holes, which indicate two right-brain strokes.Images into the Mind21made more sense to me. Sixty percent of the people who have frontal lobe strokesexperience severe depression within a year. As a result of the SPECT study, Isought immediate consultation with a neurologist, who evaluated her for thepossible causes of the stroke, such as plaques in the arteries of the neck orabnormal heart rhythms. He felt the stroke had come from a blood clot and placedher on blood-thinning medication to prevent further strokes.3. To help the physician elicit understanding and compassion from the patient'sfamily. When Frank, a wealthy, well-educated man, entered his seventies, hebegan to grow forgetful. At first it was over small things, but as time went on,the lapses of memory progressed to the point where he often forgot essentialfacts of his life: where he lived, his wife's name, and even his own name. Hiswife and children, not understanding his change in behavior, were annoyed withhis ab-sentmindedness and often angry at him for it. Frank's SPECT study showeda marked suppression across the entire brain, but especially in the frontallobes, parietal lobes, and temporal lobes. This was a classic Alzheimer'sdisease pattern. By showing the family these images and pointing out thephysiological cause of Frank's forgetful-ness in living images, I helped themunderstand that he was not trying to be annoying, but had a serious medicalproblem.Consequently, instead of blaming him for his memory lapses, Frank's family beganto show compassion toward him, and they developed strategies to deal moreeffectively with the problems of liv-Frank's Brain, Affected by Alzheimer's Diseasepicture9 [images/picture9.jpg]picture10 [images/picture10.jpg]3-D top-down surface view 3-D underside surface viewNotice marked overall suppression, especially in the parietal lobes (arrows,left image) and temporal lobes (arrows, right image).ing with a person who has Alzheimer's disease. In addition, I placed Frank onnew treatments for Alzheimer's disease that seemed to slow the progression ofthe illness.4. To differentiate between two problems with similar symptoms. I first metMargaret when she was sixty-eight years old. Her appearance was ragged andunkempt. She lived alone, and her family was worried because she appeared tohave symptoms of serious dementia. They finally admitted her to the psychiatrichospital where I worked after she nearly burned the house down by leaving astove burner on. When I consulted with the family, I also found out thatMargaret often forgot the names of her own children and frequently got lost whendriving her car. Her driving habits deteriorated to the point where theDepartment of Motor Vehicles (DMV) had to take away her license after four minoraccidents in a six-month period. At the time when Margaret's family saw me, somemembers had had enough and were ready to put her into a supervised livingsituation. Other family members, however, were against the idea and wanted herhospitalized for further evaluation.While at first glance it may have appeared that Margaret was suffering fromAlzheimer's disease, the results of her SPECT study showed full activity in herparietal and temporal lobes. If she had Alzheimer's, there should have beenevidence of decreased blood flow in those areas. Instead, the only abnormalactivity shown on Margaret's SPECT was in the deep limbic system at the centerof the brain, where the activity was increased. Often, this is a finding inpeople suffering from depression. Sometimes in the elderly it can be difficultto distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and depression because the symptomscan be similar. Yet with pseudodementia (depression masquerading as dementia), aperson may appear demented, yet not be at all. This is an important distinction,because a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease would lead to prescribing a set ofcoping strategies to the family and possibly new medications, whereas adiagnosis of some form of depression would lead to prescribing an aggressivetreatment of antidepressant medication for the patient along with psychotherapy.The results of Margaret's SPECT study convinced me that she should try theantidepressant Wellbutrin (bupropion). After three weeks, she was talkative,well groomed, and eager to socialize with the other patients. After a month inthe hospital she was released to go home. Before discharge she asked if I wouldwrite a letter to the DMV to help her get her driver's license back.

I told her that if in six monthsshe remained improved and she was compliant with treatment, I would write to theDMV for her. Six months later she remained markedly improved. I repeated herSPECT study. It was completely normal. I wrote the letter to the DMV, and itgave her back her license!5. To discern when a problem is the result of abuse and remove the patient froma dangerous environment. Betty was the most beautiful eighty-eight-year-oldwoman I had ever met. She was very proper and very proud. When she was young shehad emigrated from England after marrying an American soldier. It was not herninety-year-old husband who brought her to the hospital to see me, however, itwas her sister. Her husband, far from being supportive, angrily denied that hiswife was suffering from serious cognitive problems. Yet during the evaluationprocess it was clear that Betty had severe memory problems; she did not knowwhere she lived, her phone number, or her husband's name. I ordered a SPECTstudy that showed a dent in the right side of Betty's frontal lobe. It wasobvious to me that she had at some point suffered a significant head injury.When I asked her about it, all she could do was look down and cry; she could notgive me details of the event. When I asked her sister, she reported that Bettyand her husband had a stormy relationBetty's Trauma-Affected Brainpicture13 [images/picture13.jpg]3-D front-on surface view Notice the areas of decreased activity in the rightfrontal cortex.ship and that he was abusive toward her. Sometimes he would grab her by the hairand slam her head into the wall. The sister wanted Betty to go to the police,but Betty had said it would only make things worse.Shortly after Betty was hospitalized, her husband began pressuring me to sendher home. He kept protesting that there was nothing wrong with her, yet I knewthat Betty needed to be removed from her home environment, so I contacted AdultProtective Services. At Betty's hearing, I used her SPECT studies to convincethe judge that her home held potential danger. He then ordered her to have aconservator, and she went to live with her sister.It will be clear from these and many other stories in this book that a doctorwho can give an accurate diagnosis can be the greatest friend a patient canhave. By now, you may be starting to understand why this technology has soforcefully grabbed my attention."},{"pageContent":"Carving Knives and Tooth Fairies:A Prelude to the Brain and BehaviorWhen I first started my brain-imaging research, I decided to study the brainpatterns of my own family, including my mother, my aunt, my wife, all three ofmy children, and myself. I wanted to see if the patterns I was seeing correlatedwith those of the people of whom I had the most intimate knowledge. I quicklylearned that getting my own brain scanned was not an easy experience. Even withall that I have accomplished in my life, I was still very anxious about goingthrough the procedure. What if something was wrong with my brain? What if mybrain showed the pattern of a murderer? What if nothing was there at all? Inever felt more naked than after my scan, when my own brain activity wasprojected onto a computer screen in front of my colleagues. At that moment, Iwould have rather been without clothes than without the covering of my skull. Iwas relieved to see very good activity in nearly all of my brain. I saw an areaof overactivity, however, that stood out like a red Christmas tree light in theright side of my basal ganglia (a deep brain structure that controls the body'sanxiety level). It was working too hard. Of note, my mother (who tends to be abit anxious) and my aunt (who has been clinically diagnosed with a panicdisorder) both had the same pattern (increased activity in the right side of thebasal ganglia). As we have discovered, these problems often run in families.The little Christmas tree light made sense to me. Even though I do not have aclinical disorder, my whole life I have struggled with minor issues of anxiety.I used to bite my nails and sometimes still do when I feel anxious. I used tofind it very difficult to ask for payments from patients after therapy sessions.I also had a terrible time speaking in front of large groups (which I now love).My first appearance on television was terrible. My hands sweated so much that Iunknowingly rubbed them on my pants throughout the interview. Right before mysecond television interview, on the nationally syndicated Sonya Live on CNN, Inearly had a panic attack. While I was sitting in the greenroom in the CNNstudio in Los Angeles waiting to go on the air, my mind flooded with negativethoughts. I started to predict disaster for myself: I might say somethingstupid. Stumble over my words. Basically make an idiot of myself in front of twomillion people. Thankfully, in time I recognized what was happening to me. Ireminded myself, \"I treat people who have this problem. Breathe with your belly.Think good thoughts. Remember the times when you were most competent. Relax;after the show is over most people are going to go back to thinking aboutthemselves and not you anyway, no matter how good or how bad you are.\" I usedthe \"Basal Ganglia Prescriptions,\" which I will give in chapter 6, tosuccessfully deal with my anxiety. The interview was a delight.I also hate conflict. This isn't surprising; any situation that triggersuncomfortable feelings, such as anxiety, causes a person with basal gangliaproblems to avoid the situation. Conflict avoidance has had aDr. A.'s Anxiety-Affected Brainpicture14 [images/picture14.jpg]3-D underside active view Notice increased activity in right basal ganglia area(arrow).negative impact on my life, and left me unable to deal with some difficultsituations at school or in my professional life. As I thought about theincreased activity in the right side of my basal ganglia, I realized it was ahereditary pattern (my mother and aunt had this same SPECT pattern). Knowingthis has helped me to develop and use basal ganglia prescriptions to overcomethe biological brain pattern that was subjecting me to anxiety.MichelleSometimes these patterns are subtle, and sometimes they are more pronounced.Here are four more examples that highlight the connection between the brain andbehavior. On three separate occasions, Michelle, a thirty-five-year-old nurse,left her husband. Each time she left him within the ten days before the onset ofher menstrual period. The third time her irritability, anger, and irrationalbehavior escalated to the point where she attacked him with a knife over a minordisagreement. The next morning, her husband was on the phone to my office. WhenI first met Michelle, it was several days after her menstrual period had startedand things had significantly settled down. The severe temper outbursts wereusually over by the third day after her period started. In my office, sheappeared to be a gentle, soft-spoken woman. It was hard for me to imagine thatthis woman had only days before gone after her husband with a carving knife.Because her actions were so serious, I decided to perform two brain SPECTstudies on her. The first one was done four days before the onset of her nextperiod—during the roughest time in her cycle—and the second one was done elevendays later—during the calmest time of her cycle.My colleagues and I have observed that left-side brain problems often correspondwith a tendency toward significant irritability, even violence. On Michelle'sbrain study before the onset of her period, her deep limbic system (the moodcontrol center) near the center of her brain was significantly overactive,especially on the left side. This \"focal\" deep limbic finding (on one side asopposed to both sides) often correlates with cyclical tendencies towarddepression and irritability. There was a dramatic change in her second scantaken eleven days later when Michelle was feeling better. The deep limbic systemwas normal!Contrary to the beliefs of some naysayers, PMS, or premenstrual syndrome, isreal. Women with PMS are not imagining things; theCHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFEchemistry of their brain is genuinely altered and produces reactions they cannotcontrol. The deep limbic system has a higher density of estrogen receptors thanother parts of the brain, making it more vulnerable, in some women, to theestrogen changes that occur at puberty, before the onset of menses, after a babyis born, or during menopause. Sometimes these changes can produce dramaticeffects. For women like Michelle, PMS can be debilitating or even dangerous—andthus we must pay attention to it. I have seen the same general pattern in othercouples I have counseled whom I saw with Michelle and her husband. During thebest time of the woman's cycle, the two people get along. During the worst time,there are fighting and alienation.I often prescribe an antiseizure medication called Depakote (divalproex) forpeople who have cyclic mood disorders like manic-depressive disorder. BecauseMichelle's SPECT findings showed an area of focal intensity in the left side ofher deep limbic system (a finding I often see in someone who has a cyclic mooddisorder), I put her on Depakote. It evened out her moods very nicely. We triedtaking her off the Depakote after nine months, but her symptoms returnedquickly. Her husband and best friend called me within the month to beg me to puther back on it. Two years on Depakote seemed to be the magic number. It was onlythen that Michelle was able to gradually stop taking the medication withoutrelapse.Michelle's PMS-Affected Brain (Before and After)picture15 [images/picture15.jpg]picture16 [images/picture16.jpg]3-D underside active viewLeft picture is four days before onset of period; notice increased deep limbicactivity (arrow).

His toothwas secure under his pillow in a special pouch for the tooth fairy. The nextmorning Brian was ecstatic when he found a dollar in the pouch. All day long hethought and thought and thought about the tooth fairy. He was so happy, in fact,that he secretly pulled out another tooth after school. His mother, who wassurprised by the other tooth, went through the tooth fairy ritual again. Twodays later Brian pulled out a third tooth. His mother started to worry when shesaw Brian tugging at a tooth she knew wasn't loose. She told him that the toothfairy doesn't come if you pull out your own teeth. She told him not to do itanymore. There was no tooth fairy that night. Over the next month, however,Brian couldn't get the thought of the tooth fairy out of his head and he pulledout three more teeth. His mother brought him to me for an evaluation.In Brian's family there was a history of alcohol abuse, depression, andobsessive-compulsive disorder. Behavioral interventions were not successful inkeeping Brian's hands out of his mouth. Additionally Brian was oppositional andhad trouble at school. The teacher said he \"always got stuck on certainthoughts\" and could not pay attention to his classwork. After several months,individual therapy was not progressing. I ordered a brain SPECT study to betterunderstand the functional pattern of Brian's brain. His study revealed markedincreased activity in the top middle portion of his frontalBrian's Brainpicture17 [images/picture17.jpg]3-D side active view Note markedly increased cingulate activity.lobes (the cingulate area, with which you will become very familiar). This partof the brain allows you to shift your attention from one thing to another. Whenit is overactive, people may end up getting \"stuck\" on certain thoughts andbehaviors. Given the intense level of overactivity in this part of his brain, Iput Brian on a low dose of Zoloft (sertraline—an antiobsessive antidepressantthat is known to cool down this part of the brain). Within several weeks thecompulsive teeth pulling disappeared and Brian was more attentive in class.MARRIAGE AND THE BRAINThe BentleysThe Bentley family came to see me because their two children were havingproblems in school. Ten-year-old Wendy was talking too much in class, notfinishing her work, and frequently distracted. Seven-year-old Charles was oftenout of his seat, aggressive with the other boys, off task, poorly organized, andseemingly loved to be in the middle of trouble. The teachers had been tellingthe parents, Bob and Betsy, to seek help for Charles since preschool. During theevaluation, the parents told me they had a solid marriage with little conflict.The children were both diagnosed with a condition known as attention deficitdisorder (ADD), a genetic, neurobiological disorder that affects approximately 5percent of children in the United States. It is characterized by a shortattention span, distractibility, disorganization, and often, although notalways, hyperactivity and impulse-control problems. The parents and childrenwere educated about ADD, the teachers were involved in discussions about thechildren, medication was prescribed, and the parents took a parent trainingclass to become more effective in dealing with the children at home.After several weeks, Wendy had a very positive response to treatment. She wasdoing better in school, she got her homework done more quickly and accurately,and she was better able to manage her behavior in the classroom. Charles was adifferent story. He continued to have problems with his behavior at school andhome; nothing seemed to help. During several individual sessions with Charles, Ifound that he was under severe stress. Despite what his parents had initiallytold me about themselves, they fought nearly every night and he was very worriedthey would get divorced. Charles told me about the yelling matches, slammingdoors, and threats of leaving. \"I can't think of doing my schoolwork when I'm soworried about mymom and dad getting a divorce.\" I discussed this information with his parents.They readily agreed that there was a lot of tension between them, but theydidn't think it had anything to do with the children's problems. They had noidea how much it was bothering Charles. They agreed to come for marriagecounseling once a week.I have two couches in my office. I can tell a lot about a couple by where theysit. If they sit on the same couch there is a willingness to be close, less soif they are on different couches. This couple sat on the opposite end of eachcouch, as far away from each other as possible. I usually have fun when I domarriage counseling. I find it satisfying to see couples and families becomecloser and more loving. I help them clarify their goals in the relationship andteach them the skills they need to reach those goals. Working with Bob andBetsy, however, was anything but fun. The fury between them was often so intensethat others in my clinic knew when they were in my office. For nearly ninemonths they talked about divorce at every session. Despite the therapy, theyfought nearly every night. I wondered what kept them together.Without clear structure and interventions from me, the sessions would take on apattern. After they told me about the traumatic fights of the week, Betsy wouldbring up an issue from the past and go over and over and over it, despite myattempts to encourage her in a more constructive direction. She had severeproblems letting go of prior events or disappointments. She held on to grudgesfrom many years ago, with Bob and others, and she continually brought up thesame problems. Bob, on the other hand, never really seemed to pay attention. Assoon as Betsy started to talk, he would look away, as if he were off in somedistant place. I found myself frequently having to bring him back to the therapysession. When he entered the conversation, it was often with some snide remark.Then his attention would wander again. He reminded me of a hit-and-run driver:Cause a problem, then leave the scene.After nine months of \"marital therapy\" going nowhere, Charles was getting worse.One day after seeing him for an individual session, I called his parents into myoffice. \"Look,\" I said, \"both of you are trying really hard to make this work.Yet it is not working. The tension at home is damaging your kids, especiallyCharles. Either you should get an amicable divorce and give yourselves and thesekids some peace, or let me scan your brains and see if I'm not missing abiological piece to your marriage puzzle.\" They agreed to get the set of brainstudies.Betsy's Overfocused Brainpicture18 [images/picture18.jpg]3-D top-down active view Note markedly increased cingulate activity.As I looked at their brain scans with the experience of seeing them as a couplefor nine months, the results made perfect clinical sense to me. In fact, I wasirritated with myself that I hadn't done it earlier. The cingulate part ofBetsy's brain was extremely overactive, causing her to be unable to shift herattention and to become tenaciously locked on to certain thoughts or ideas. Herbrain was causing her to go over and over the same material. Bob, on the otherhand, had a normal brain pattern at rest, but when he performed a concentrationtask, the front part of his brain, which should increase in activity duringconcentration, completely shut down. This meant that the harder he tried to payattention to Betsy, the more his attention wandered. He often sought conflict asa way to stimulate his own brain. Bob's symptoms and his brain study clearlyindicated he had ADD like his kids (ADD is usually a genetic disorder).It was now clear to me that this couple's problems existed, at least in part, ona biological level. I needed to optimize their brain biology if the therapy wasgoing to do any good at all. I placed Betsy on Prozac (fluoxetine). Prozac, likeZoloft, decreases overactivity of the cingulate and allows people to shift theirattention more freely between topics and become less stuck on thoughts andbehaviors. I think of these medications as \"lubricants\" for the brain's shiftingmechanism. I put Bob on Ritalin, which is a stimulant medication that helpschildren and adults with ADD concentrate, stay on task, and be less impulsive.I'm sure there are some people who wouldCarving Knives and Tooth Fairies Bob's ADD-Affected Brain33picture19 [images/picture19.jpg]picture20 [images/picture20.jpg]3-D underside surface viewAt rest; note good prefrontal activity (arrows).During concentration; note marked drop-off of prefrontal activity.strongly object to marital therapy through the use of medication, but in thiscase I believed it was essential.Three weeks after the couple was on medication, there was a dramatic shift inthe relationship. My first clue came when they sat on the same couch, next toeach other. The second clue was that Betsy had her hand on Bob's leg (a veryhopeful sign). They reported that the medications had made a big difference.Betsy stopped nagging and \"beating ideas to death.\" Bob started to pay moreattention and be less conflict-driven. There were no more hit and runs. Hebecame more thoughtful. To my delight, with their brains working in more normalways, they were able to utilize our marital therapy. They spent regular timetogether, agreed on their parenting strategies together, and even resumed makinglove on a more regular basis. As Betsy and Bob did better, so did Charles. Howmany marriages end in divorce or chronic unhappiness because of brain patternsthat interfere with intimacy? Later I'll devote a whole chapter to relationshipsand the brain.WillieWillie was the kind of guy who got along with everyone. An A student, he had acollege scholarship waiting for him, and his futureseemed altogether promising—until his head collided with the dashboard when hiscar accidentally hit a guardrail. Although Willie felt dazed, he seemed to beokay by the next day. Three months later he got into another accident when heswerved to avoid hitting a dog that had run out into the street. His head hitthe windshield very hard, and this time he had to be sent to an emergency room.After examining Willie, the doctor told him he had nothing to worry about; hehad only a minor concussion. In the months that followed, however, Willie foundthat the \"minor concussion\" was wreaking havoc with his life. Normally afriendly person, he found himself suddenly losing his temper at the smallestthings. His whole attitude and demeanor began to change. Where he had once beenpatient, he now had a short fuse. Where he had once been amiable and calm, hewas now always angry. His irritability and constant flares of temper began toalienate his friends and family.The brunt of his anger came to rest on his college roommate and strangely beganto center around food. Inexplicably, Willie's appetite was changing. In justthree months, he had put on seventy pounds, and he was hungry all the time. Heseemed to be devouring every morsel of food in the house. When his roommatefinally got fed up with Willie eating all the groceries and asked Willie to eatonly the food he bought himself, Willie felt that by depriving him of the foodneeded, his roommate was trying to hurt him. Willie was consumed with negative,paranoid thoughts about this person who was \"trying to take the food out of hismouth.\" In his mind, the only way to protect himself against this enemy was tohurt the enemy. One afternoon he took a huge meat cleaver and a butcher knifeand waited at the front door for the man who used to be his friend. \"He wasgoing to be instantaneously dissolved,\" Willie later told me.Yet even as he was gripped by paranoia, some part of Willie's mind was stillsane. He saw himself, as if from above, standing behind the door and holdingthese weapons. He knew he was out of control and that he had to stop himselfbefore it was too late. He went to the telephone and called a friend, who gavehim my telephone number, and the immediate crisis was averted.Willie described for me his two accidents and the severity of his personalitychanges. I immediately ordered a brain study. As I expected, the study showedabnormalities. Two areas were working too hard: One was in his left temporallobe, where dysfunction is often associated with paranoia and violence. Thesecond was the top, middle section of the frontal lobes (cingulate area), again,the part ofWillie's Brain, Affected by Head Traumapicture21 [images/picture21.jpg]3-D side active viewNote markedly increased cingulate and left temporal lobe activity (arrows).the brain that allows a person to shift attention freely from one thing toanother. When this part of the brain is overactive, people get stuck in thoughtspirals. The minute I saw Willie's brain study, it clearly explained for me thechanges that had been occurring in his personality: paranoia, fiery temper, andnegative thoughts about his roommate, which he couldn't turn off.The next step was clear. I prescribed medication to alleviate his symptoms: anantiseizure medication for the temporal lobe abnormality and an antiobsessiveantidepressant to help him get \"unstuck\" from negative thoughts. After severalweeks of treatment, the results were dramatic. Willie began to regain his senseof humor and to reconnect with his friends and family. At the time of thiswriting, it has been six years since his two accidents. Now on medication tocontrol the trauma-induced brain problems, he is one of the nicest human beingsyou will ever meet.The brain is the seat of feelings and behavior. Your brain creates your world—aradical statement about ordinary thinking. Yet it is your brain that perceivesand experiences. Everything begins and ends in the brain. How our brains workdetermines the very quality of our lives: how happy we will be, how well we'llget along with others, how successful we will be in our profession. The brainlikely influences how close or how distant we feel from God. The patterns of ourbrain predispose what kind of husband or wife we will be,whether we will fail in school, be irritable with our children, or have theambition to strive toward our goals.Most of us are not a short fuse on a stick of dynamite like Willie beforetreatment or Michelle during the worst time of her cycle. We do not use meatcleavers or carving knives to deal with others who irritate us. Most of us arewarm, kind, reasonable people who want to form meaningful relationships and besuccessful in our day-to-day lives. When our brain patterns are normal andbalanced, we are generally able to do all these things. When behavior becomesabnormal, however, as in the cases mentioned above, often there is something thematter with the patterns in the body's computer—the brain. These case historiesdemonstrate that the actual physical patterns of our brain have a dramaticimpact on how we thin\\,feel, and behave from moment to moment. Only recentlyhave we discovered how to recognize those patterns and how to treat them withboth behavioral and medical prescriptions.Unfortunately, there are many professionals who lack sophisticated informationon how the brain actually works. They believe the behavior of their patients isprimarily the result of environmental stress or conditioning and do not considerthe possibility that it may be based on abnormal brain physiology. Willie, forexample, could have talked to a therapist about his toilet training until theend of the millennium and it would not have helped him. I believe that we need amore holistic approach to psychotherapy. I believe that we need to understandthe role of brain physiology along with other factors such as stress orconditioning before we can design successful treatments for people.In chapters 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 I am going to teach you about five differentbrain systems. Understanding these brain systems will help you understandyourself and others in a totally new way. The activity in these systems providesthe basis for much of the behaviors we call human. Each of these chapters willbegin with a description of the functions and general locations of each part ofthe brain. I'll then discuss how each area contributes to everyday behavior aswell as to certain medical disorders, such as depression or anxiety. Each ofthese five chapters will close with a checklist to help you identify yourself orloved ones who may fit into certain categories. In chapters 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12,I'll discuss specific healing and optimization prescriptions."},{"pageContent":"Looking Into Love and Depression:The Deep Limbic SystemFUNCTIONS OF THE DEEP LIMBIC SYSTEM• sets the emotional tone of the mind •filters external events through internalstates(creates emotional coloring)• tags events as internally important• stores highly charged emotional memories• modulates motivation• controls appetite and sleep cycles• promotes bonding• directly processes the sense of smell• modulates libidoThe deep limbic system lies near the center of the brain.

Clinically, we have foundthese divi sions helpful to explain much of the behavior we have seen.The Deep Limbic Systempicture22 [images/picture22.jpg]picture23 [images/picture23.jpg]side view3-D side active viewpicture24 [images/picture24.jpg]3-D underside active viewtions. It freed them from the stereotypical behavior and actions dictated by thebrain stem, found in the older \"reptilian\" brain. The subsequent evolution ofthe surrounding cerebral cortex in higher animals, especially humans, gave usthe capacity for problem solving, planning, organization, and rational thought.Yet in order for these functions to have an effect in the world, one must havepassion, emotion, and the desire to make something happen. The deep limbicsystem adds the emotional spice, if you will, in both positive and negativeways.This part of the brain is involved in setting emotional tone. When the deeplimbic system is less active, there is generally a positive, more hopeful stateof mind. When it is heated up, or overactive, negativity can take over. Thisfinding actually surprised my colleagues at the clinic and me at first. Wethought that excessive activity in the part of the brain that controlled emotionmight correlate with enhanced feelings of all kinds, not solely negative ones.Yet we noticed, again and again, that when this area was overactive on SPECT, itcorrelated with the subject's depression and negativity. It seems that when thedeep limbic system is inflamed, painful emotional shading results. New researchon depression from other laboratories around the world has borne this out.The emotional shading provided by the deep limbic system is the filter throughwhich you interpret the events of the day. It colors events depending on youremotional state of mind. When you are sad (with an overactive deep limbicsystem), you are likely to interpret neutral events through a negative filter.For example, if you have a neutral or even positive conversation with someonewhose deep limbic system is overactive or \"negatively set,\" he or she is likelyto interpret the conversation in a negative way. When this part of the brain is\"cool\" or functions properly, a neutral or positive interpretation of events ismore likely to occur. Emotional tagging of events is critical to survival. Thevalence or charge we give to certain events in our lives drives us to action(such as approaching a desired mate) or causes avoidance behavior (withdrawingfrom someone who has hurt us in the past).PMS, discussed in the last chapter, is a classic example of this emotionalshading principle. As mentioned, in our study of PMS within five to ten daysbefore the onset of menstruation, the deep limbic system becomes inflamed ormore active with the drop in hormones. This deep limbic activation colors eventsin a more negative way. A friend's wife has a fairly severe case of PMS. Hetells me that during the first week of her cycle, she looks at him with love andaffection, and almost anything he does seems to be right. She is more loving andaffectionate. Ten days before her period, things are dramatically different. Shedoesn't want to be touched. She \"has a different look,\" which he describes as acombination of a scowl and a \"don't mess with me\" look. Little he does is right.She emotionally colors most events in a negative way. Then, a few days after hercycle starts, she's back to being more positive, loving, and affectionate.The deep limbic system, along with the deep temporal lobes, has also beenreported to be involved in storing highly charged emotional memories, bothpositive and negative. If you have been traumatized by a dramatic event, such asbeing in a car accident or watching your house burn down, or if you have beenabused by a parent or a spouse, the emotional component of the memory is storedin the deep limbic system of the brain. And if you have won the lottery,graduated magna cum laude, or watched your child's birth, those emotionalmemories are stored here as well. The total cxpcrience of our emotional memories is responsible, in part, for the emotional toneof our mind. The more stable, positive experiences we have, the more positive weare likely to feel; the more trauma in our lives, the more emotionally set webecome in a negative way. These emotional memories are intimately involved inthe emotional tagging we impose on the day's events. •The deep limbic system also affects motivation and drive. It helps get you goingin the morning and encourages you to move throughout the day. Overactivity inthis area, in our experience, is associated with lowered motivation and drive,which is often seen in depression. The deep limbic system, especially thehypothalamus, controls the sleep and appetite cycles of the body. Healthy sleepand appetite are essential to maintaining a proper internal milieu. Both ofthese components are often a problem with limbic abnormalities.The deep limbic structures are also intimately involved with bonding and socialconnectedness. When the deep limbic system of animals is damaged, they do notproperly bond with their young. In one study of rats, when the deep limbicstructures were damaged, mothers would not feed and nurture the young but woulddrag them around the cage as if they were inanimate objects. The deep limbicsystem affects the bonding mechanism that enables you to connect socially withother people; your ability to do this successfully in turn influences yourmoods. We are social animals. When we are bonded to people in a positive way, wefeel better about ourselves and our lives. This capacity to bond then plays asignificant role in the tone and quality of our moods.The deep limbic system also directly processes the sense of smell. The olfactorysystem is the only one of the five sensory systems that goes from the sensoryorgan to directly where it is processed in the brain. The messages from all theother senses (sight, hearing, touch, and taste) are sent to a \"relay station\"before they are sent to their final destination in different parts of the brain.Because your sense of smell goes directly to the deep limbic system, it is easyto see why smells can have such a powerful impact on our feeling states. Themultibillion-dollar perfume and deodorant industries count on this fact:beautiful smells evoke pleasant feelings and draw people toward you; unpleasantsmells repel them.I learned about the limbic-smell connection firsthand when I was sixteen yearsold and dating the woman who became my wife. She was a good Catholic girl. As atypical hot-blooded teenager, I was extremely interested in physical affection.One night I ran out of after-shave and borrowed my brother's English Leather. When I picked her up for ourdate, I noticed a difference. I had a car with a bench seat in front. Usuallyshe sat in the part of the seat nearest to the passenger door. That night shesat in the middle part, next to me. She took my hand before I reached for hers.She came close to me before I moved toward her. She was cuddlier and moreaffectionate than before. Needless to say, from then on English Leather was theonly scent I wore.Bonding, smells, sexuality, and the deep limbic system are intimately connected.Napoleon once wrote to Josephine to ask her not to bathe for two weeks before hecame home from a battle. He wanted her scent to be powerful, because it excitedhim sexually. It is likely that positive, sexual smells cool the limbic systemand intensify our mood for love. Deep limbic overactivity, often associated withdepression, frequently results in decreased sexual interest. For many years, Ihave hypothesized that decreased sexual activity is associated with increaseddeep limbic activity and more vulnerability to depression.I studied this phenomenon in an adult male who had problems with depression andincreased activity in his deep limbic systems on SPECT. I asked him to makepassionate love with his wife. I then rescanned him within an hour. His limbicactivity was significantly decreased. Orgasm has been described as amini-seizure of the limbic system and tends to release or lessen deep limbicactivity. Sexuality is good for the bonded human brain.Whenever a person is sexually involved with another person, neurochemicalchanges occur in both their brains that encourage limbic, emotional bonding. Yetlimbic bonding is the reason casual sex doesn't really work for most people on awhole mind and body level. Two people may decide to have sex \"just for the funof it,\" yet something is occurring on another level they might not have decidedon at all: Sex is enhancing an emotional bond between them whether they want itor not. One person, often the woman, is bound to form an attachment and will behurt when a casual affair ends. One reason it is usually the woman who is hurtmost is that the female limbic system is larger than the male's. One likelyconsequence is that she will become more limbically connected.I once treated a patient named Renee who had a high sex drive. She was notsexually satisfied by her husband. For years, other men flirted with her and sheremained faithful, until one day she decided, out of pure frustration, to havean affair with a coworker. From theoutset, they agreed that they were going to have friendly sex, just for fun,just for the pleasure, and in the first two months that seemed to work. ThenRenee felt herself wanting to see him more often. She tried to get him to meetwith her twice a week instead of once a week, as they had originally agreed.Instead of responding positively, her lover pulled away. The more attached shebecame, the more detached he became. Although Renee and her lover had been onthe same wavelength in the beginning, in the end she had changed and he hadn't,and she felt used. It is important to understand how your body and psyche work.In this case, Renee would have been wise to realize that her limbic system wasnot quite as open to casual sex as she wanted to be. She would have been betteroff to stay with her husband and work things out sexually with him, rather thanto pick a casual acquaintance for a sexual liaison.As mentioned above, current research has demonstrated that females, on average,have a larger deep limbic system than males. This gives females severaladvantages and disadvantages. Because of their larger deep limbic brain, womenare more in touch with their feelings, and they are generally better able toexpress their feelings than men. They have an increased ability to bond and beconnected to others (which is why women are the primary caretakers ofchildren—there is no society on earth where men are primary caretakers ofchildren). Females have a more acute sense of smell, which is likely to havedeveloped from an evolutionary need for the mother to recognize her young.Having a larger deep limbic system leaves a female somewhat more susceptible todepression, especially at times of significant hormonal changes such as theonset of puberty, before menses, after the birth of a child, and at menopause.Women attempt suicide three times more often than men. Yet men's suicideattempts are sucessful three times more often than women's, in part because theyuse more violent means (women tend to use overdoses with pills while men tend toeither shoot or hang themselves), and men are generally less connected to othersthan are women. Disconnection from others increases the risk of completedsuicides.The deep limbic system, especially the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, isresponsible for translating our emotional state into physical feelings ofrelaxation or tension. The front half of the hypothalamus sends calming signalsto the body through the parasympathetic nervous system. The back half of thehypothalamus sends stimulating or fear signals to the body through thesympathetic nervous system. The back half of the hypothalamus, when stimulated,is re-sponsible for the fight-or-flight response, a primitive state that gets us readyto fight or flee when we are threatened or scared. This \"hardwired response\"happens immediately upon activation, such as seeing or experiencing an emotionalor physical threat: The heart beats faster, breathing rate and blood pressureincreases, the hands and feet become cooler to shunt blood from the extremitiesto the big muscles (to fight or run away), and the pupils dilate (to seebetter). This deep limbic translation of emotion is powerful and immediate. Ithappens with overt physical threats and also with more covert emotional threats.This part of the brain is intimately connected to the prefrontal cortex andseems to acts as a switching station between running on emotion (the deep limbicsystem) and rational thought and problem solving using our cortex. When thelimbic system is turned on, emotions tend to take over. When it is cooled down,more activation is possible in the cortex. Current research shows a correlationbetween depression and increased deep limbic system activity and shutdown in theprefrontal cortex, especially on the left side.PROBLEMS IN THE DEEP LIMBIC SYSTEM• moodiness, irritability, clinical depression• increased negative thinking• negative perception of events• decreased motivation• flood of negative emotions• appetite and sleep problems• decreased or increased sexual responsiveness• social isolationThe problems in the deep limbic system (as in all the other systems) generallycorrespond to their functions. Do you know people who see every situation in abad light? That pessimism actually could be a deep limbic system problembecause, as mentioned, when this part of the brain is working too hard, theemotional filter is colored by negativity. One person could walk away from aninteraction that ten others would have labeled as positive, but which he or sheconsiders negative. And since the deep limbic system affects motivation, peoplesometimes develop an \"I don't care\" attitude about life and work; they don'thave the energy to care. Because they feel hopeless about the outcome, they havelittle willpower to follow through with tasks.Since the sleep and appetite centers are in the deep limbic system, disruptioncan lead to changes, which may mean an inclination toward too much or too littleof either. For example, in typical depressive episodes people have been known tolose their appetites and to have trouble sleeping despite being chronicallytired, and yet in atypical depression they will sleep and eat excessively.There are three problems caused by abnormalities of the deep limbic system thatwarrant their own sections: bonding disruption, mood disorders, and PMS.BONDING DISRUPTIONBonding and limbic problems often go hand in hand. One of the most fundamentalbonds in the human universe is the mother-infant bond. Hormonal changes shortlyafter childbirth, however, can cause limbic or emotional problems in the mother.They are called the \"baby blues\" when they are mild, and postpartum depressionor psychosis when they are severe. When these problems arise, the deep limbicsystem of the mother's brain shows abnormal activity. (The phenomenon has beendetected in animals as well as humans.) In turn, significant bonding problemsmay occur. The mother may emotionally withdraw from the baby, preventing thebaby from developing normally. Babies who experience \"failure to thrive,\" forinstance, or who have low weight or delayed development, often have mothers whoare unattached emotionally.In such cases, the abnormal activity of the mother's deep limbic system causesdevelopmental problems for the baby. Conversely, problems in the deep limbicsystem can be caused by outside events that disrupt the human bonding process.This can occur at any stage in life. Here are three of the most common.DeathThe death of a parent, spouse, or child causes intense sadness and grief. Inthese familial relationships, there is often a tight neurochemical bond (fromthe myriad of stored emotional memories and experiences). When it is broken, theactivity of the deep limbic system is disrupted. Many who experience grief saythe pain actually feels physical. This sensation is not imaginary. Grief oftenactivates the pain centers in the brain, which are housed near the deep limbicsystem.It is interesting to note that the people who had a good relationship with theperson who died often heal their grief much more easily than those whoserelationship with the deceased was filled with turmoil, bitterness, ordisappointment. The reason is that a positive relationship is associated withgood memories, and remembering and reprocessing these memories helps in thehealing process. When people who had a bad relationship think back on it, theyhave to relive the pain. In their mind, they are still trying to fix what waswrong, to heal the wound, but they can't. In addition, the guilt they carry withthem impairs the healing process. Donna is a case in point. Donna and her motherhad had a stormy relationship, fighting constantly over things that seemedinsignificant in and of themselves. Yet in spite of their problems, the yearafter her mother's death was the hardest of Donna's life. Her husband could notunderstand the force of her grief; all he had ever heard her do was complainthat her mother was selfish and uninterested in her. What he failed tounderstand was that Donna had to grieve not only over her mother's death, butalso over the fact that now she would never have the mother-daughter bond shehad always wanted. Death had ended all her hopes.Losing a spouse or lover is traumatic in a different way from losing any otherloved one. Once you have made love with a person on a regular basis, death canbe extraordinarily painful because the deep limbic connection has been broken.The spouse has become part of the chemical bond of that part of the brain, andit takes time for that bond to dissolve. Your deep limbic system misses theperson's touch, voice, and smell.Deep limbic connection doesn't depend only on sexual intimacy. Anotheroften-overlooked \"deep limbic loss\" is the loss of a family pet. Many peoplebecome as attached to their pets as they do to the significant people in theirlives. Pets often give unconditional love and connect with our innermost caringselves. I have often felt that holding one of my cats or petting my dog during ascan would have a positive \"limbic cooling\" effect. Unfortunately, while I waswriting this chapter my dog, Samantha, died of cancer. The sadness in my familywas great, with many tears, especially from my daughters and wife. We all hadproblems sleeping, no one felt like eating, and anything that reminded us ofSamantha would quickly bring up tears and feelings of intense sadness and loss.I have known some pet owners who became so depressed after a pet died that theyfelt suicidal and even paranoid. Appreciating this significant grief is oftennecessary to healing.DivorceDivorce can be a source of the most severe kind of stress it is possible for ahuman being to experience. For many, it actually causes more anguish to lose aspouse through divorce than it does through death. As stated above, people whoare \"limbically connected\" have a very powerful bond, and I believe thisphenomenon may be one of the major reasons women cannot leave abusive men. Theyhave had their children with these men, shared their beds and their homes withthem. To break that bond, which is at the core of their brain, causes a severerupture that can make the woman feel fragmented, as if she were not quite wholewithout the man. She may be plagued by sleep and appetite problems, depression,irritability, and social isolation. I once treated a woman who was married to acontrolling, angry man whom she could never please. On the day he told her hewas leaving her for another woman (causing her a severe limbic injury), shebecame so depressed that she put her head in the oven and turned on the gas.Fortunately she was rescued and taken to the hospital. It wasn't until her deeplimbic system began to heal and she could feel her own autonomy that sherealized she didn't even like her husband, and in any case, it certainly wasn'tworth killing herself over a man who cheated on her.Even the one who initiates a separation suffers distress and often goes througha period of depression, because the \"chemical limbic bonds\" break for everyoneinvolved in the separation. The one who is walking out the door may fail torealize this and not anticipate the grief period that will likely follow. Forsome, divorce is so devastating that it can trigger enormous anger andvengefulness. In fact, I have never seen two people more cruel to each otherthan those going through a messy divorce. They lose all sense of fairness andrationality and do everything possible to hurt each other. What ignites suchnegative responses? Breaking the chemical connection activates the deep limbicsystem. People become not only depressed and negative but also oversensitive,taking every little thing the wrong way. Anger quickly follows. They know theyhave to separate, and unconsciously they use the anger and aggression as a wayto do it.The Empty Nest SyndromeWhen children leave home, parents often feel intensely sad and bereft. Many losetheir appetites and have trouble sleeping. Some-thing is missing. This may be confusing because the parents remember how arduousit was struggling through the growing pains of their offsprings' adolescence,and they assumed it would be a relief when the teenagers were finally out of thehouse and off to their own lives. (It has been suggested that the discordantnature of the parent-child relationship during adolescence may be nature's wayof helping parents and teens make the transition from the close bond ofchildhood to the total independence of young adulthood.) Yet no matter howdifficult those adolescent years were for both sides, a tremendous bond stillexists, and breaking it is stressful.I once treated a man who developed a clinical depression after his only daughterleft home for college. Even though he was happily married, enjoyed his work, andwas otherwise healthy, he felt sad, cried easily, had trouble sleeping, becamemore irritable, and had concentration problems—all symptoms of depression.Another woman I treated whose two sons went off to college one year after theother became so depressed and felt so lonely and unimportant that she resortedto having an affair as a way to deal with her pain. She lost her marriage overthe affair, became suicidal, and almost lost her life.DEPRESSIONLack of bonding and depression are often related. People who are depressed oftendo not feel like being around others and consequently isolate themselves. Thesocial isolation tends to perpetuate itself: The more isolated a person becomes,the less bonding activity occurs. This worsens the depression and increases thelikelihood of further isolation.Depression is known to be caused by a deficit of certain neurochemicals orneurotransmitters, especially norepinephrine and serotonin. In my experience,this deficit can cause increased metabolism or inflammation in the deep limbicsystem, which in turn causes many of the problems associated with depression.You may have noticed in this chapter how, along with all the other symptoms ofdeep limbic system disruption, depression seems to be a common factor. Becausethe deep limbic system is intimately tied to moods, when it is overactive theensuing problems with depression snowball and affect all the other deep limbicsystem functions.Ariel came to see me because she had been experiencing symptoms of depressionfor over two years. She was tired, suffered from sleeplessness and negative thinking, had no motivation, and had begun to havesuicidal thoughts. The symptom that was most difficult for her husband, however,was her complete loss of interest in sex. He was ready to leave her because hethought she wasn't interested in him anymore as a man. Why else, he thought, hadit been such a long time since she had wanted to touch him?After I had her brain scanned, I was not surprised to find that her deep limbicsystem was on double time. Giving this information to her husband was a powerfultool in helping him to view the situation objectively: His wife was neglectinghim not because she didn't like him but because something was off balance in thechemistry of her brain. Most important of all, the problem was rectifiable.Increased activity in the deep limbic system is part of a pattern that is oftenresponsive to antidepressants, but sometimes people are averse to being put onmedication. Ariel was one of them. She had gotten caught up in the media blitzof 1991, when the hair-raising topic of the news and the talk shows was thatProzac was a dangerous drug that could cause criminally aberrant behavior. Itwas even reported that it could cause you to kill your mother! I believe thissensationalism was completely irresponsible, especially since it scared manypeople who suffered from depression, a very treatable illness, and preventedsome of them from seeking the help they needed. The fact that medication cancause side effects should not be a blanket deterrent to its use; in many, manycases, the pluses far outweigh the minuses. If you are skeptical about this,consider the following fact: People on antidepressants may experienceconstipation or an upset stomach, but suicide (often the result of untreateddepression) is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States.Ariel decided against the use of medication. She followed the deep limbicprescriptions (behavioral changes that affect the chemistry of the brain)offered in the next chapter, which I developed specifically to treat depression.Through them she was successful in overcoming her depression. However, thenonmedication prescriptions do not work for everyone and some people may needmedication. Let me emphasize the point: Depression is treatable. Please seekhelp from a qualified professional if you are suffering. Help is out there foryou.Leigh AnneHere is another example of deep limbic dysfunction. Leigh Anne came to see mefifteen months after the birth of her first child. Sev-eral weeks after her child was born, she began experiencing symptoms of nausea,social withdrawal, crying spells, and depression. Three months later she soughthelp through psychotherapy. But her condition did not improve. Her depressionprogressed to the point where she became unable to care for her daughter.Desperate to function as the good mother she wanted to be to her child, she cameto see me. After diagnosing her with major depression I placed her on Prozac andbegan seeing her in psychotherapy. Her symptoms remitted after several weeks,and after several months Leigh Anne wanted to discontinue treatment. Sheassociated taking Prozac with a course of action for \"a depressed person.\" Shedid not want to see herself in that light or be stigmatized by that label. Forseveral months after stopping she had no adverse reaction. Then her symptomsreturned.When she came to see me again, Leigh Anne still didn't want to believe thatanything was \"wrong\" with her, and was still resistant to going back onmedication. After I ordered a brain study to evaluate her deep limbic system, Iwas able to point out to her the marked increase in activity in that area of herbrain. It provided me with the evidence needed to convince her to go back onProzac for a while longer.This case illustrates an important point: It has been my experience as well asthat of many other psychiatrists that a patient does not necessarily have tostay on medication forever just because he or she has started it. However, withcertain medications, like Prozac, a mini-Leigh Anne's Depression-Affected Brainpicture25 [images/picture25.jpg]l~D underside active view Notice increased limbic activity (arrow).mum period of treatment is necessary before it can successfully be terminated.If a depressed patient is willing to stay on the medication for long enough,about two years in this case (the time period varies from person to person),there is a greater chance that it can be discontinued with no return ofsymptoms.MANIC-DEPRESSIVE DISORDERSarahSarah was fifty-three years old when she was admitted to the hospital under mycare. The month before, her family had had her committed to another psychiatrichospital for delusional thinking and bizarre behavior—she had actually rippedout all the electrical wiring in her home because she heard voices coming fromthe walls. In addition to the above symptoms, she was barely getting any sleep,her thoughts raced wildly, and she was irritable. Her doctor had diagnosedmanic-depressive disorder (a cyclical mood disorder) and placed her on lithium(an antimanic medication) and an antianxiety medication. After responding well,she was sent home. But Sarah, like Leigh Anne, did not want to believe thatanything was wrong with her, and she stopped taking both medications. Herposition was actually fortified by some members of her family who openly toldher she didn't need pills, that doctors prescribe them only to force patientsinto numerous follow-up visits. Yet their advice was ill advised, for withinweeks of stopping the treatment, Sarah's bizarre behavior returned. This waswhen her family brought her to the hospital where I worked. When I first sawSarah, she was extremely paranoid. Believing that everyone was trying to hurther, she was always looking for ways to escape from the hospital. Again herthoughts were delusional; she believed she had special powers and that otherswere trying to take them from her. At times, she also appeared very \"spacy.\" Inan attempt to understand what was going on with her for myself, and to convinceher that at least part of her problems were biological, I ordered a SPECT study.Carrying this out did not prove easy. Our clinic tried to scan her on threeseparate occasions. The first two times she ripped out the intravenous line,saying we were trying to poison her. The third time was a success because hersister stayed with her and calmed her down by talking her through theexperience. While the study revealed an overall increase in activity in the deeplimbic system, I found more in-Sarah's Manic-Depression—Affected Brainpicture26 [images/picture26.jpg]j-Z) top-down active view Note patchy uptake throughout the cortex.tensity on the left side of her scan (focal increased deep limbic uptake) and amarkedly patchy uptake across the cortex. In other words, some areas showedincreased activity and some showed decreased. My experience told me that cyclicmood disorders often correlate with focal areas of increased activity in thedeep limbic system specifically as well as a patchy uptake across the surface ofthe brain in general.For Sarah's family, this was powerful evidence that her problems werebiological, so that when she refused medication, they were now willing toencourage her to take it. After she accepted their advice, her behaviornormalized again. Once I knew she was feeling better, more in control, I showedher the brain studies. Through a better understanding of the problem she wasable to agree to follow-up visits and to stay on her medicationSometimes I'll rescan a patient several months after the first time to see whatdifference the medication has made on the physiology of his or her brain.Although Sarah's new study showed a vast improvement from her earlier one, Istill noticed an area of increased activity in the left temporal lobe, and Sarahwas still complaining of symptoms of spaciness. I changed her medication toDepakote, which is primarily used as an antiseizure medication but has also beenused for manic-depressive disorder. Not only did her psychotic symptoms remainin remission, but the spaciness disappeared as well. Five years later, a smalldose of Depakote helps Sarah lead a normal life.Sarah's case illustrates one of the most clinically significant problems inpeople diagnosed with manic-depressive illness. This disorder is usually quiteresponsive to medication. The problem is that when people afflicted by thedisorder improve, many feel so normal they do not believe they ever had aproblem to begin with. It is difficult for people to accept that they have tokeep taking medication when they think they no longer have a problem. Yet as wehave seen, prematurely stopping medication actually increases the chances ofrelapsing. Through the use of brain studies I have been able to decrease therelapse rate of my patients by demonstrating graphically the biological natureof their disorders and the need to treat them as such—a great asset inencouraging patients to cooperate in their own healing. In addition to that,brain studies have helped me persuade patients to stop blaming themselves fortheir symptoms.PMSIn the last chapter I discussed Michelle's case of clear (and dangerous) PMS. Itwas a deep limbic problem. Over the past years we have scanned many women withPMS just before the onset of their period, during the most difficult time oftheir cycle, and then again a week after the onset of their period. Most oftenwhen PMS is present we see dramatic differences between the scans. When a womanfeels good, her deep limbic system is calm and cool. When she feels bad rightbefore her period, her deep limbic system most often is hot!I have seen two PMS patterns, clinically and on SPECT, that respond to differenttreatments. One pattern is focal increased deep limbic activity that correlateswith cyclic mood changes. Hotter activity on the left side of the deep limbicsystem is often associated with anger, irritability, and expressed negativeemotion. Increased activity on the right side of the deep limbic system is oftenassociated with sadness, emotional withdrawal, anxiety, and repressed negativeemotion. Left-side abnormalities are more a problem for people with whom thewoman interacts (because of her outwardly directed anger and irritability),while right-side overactivity is more an internal problem. Focal deep limbicfindings, worse during the premenstrual period, often respond best to lithium oranticonvulsant medications, such as Depakote, Neurontin (gabapentin), Lamictal(lamotrigine), or Tegretol (carbamazepine). These medications tend to even outmoods, calm inner tension, decrease irritability, and help people feel morecomfortable in their own skin.The second PMS pattern that I have noted is increased deep limbic activity inconjunction with increased cingulate gyrus activity. The cingulate, as we willsee, is the part of the brain associated with shifting attention. Women withthis pattern often complain of increased sadness, worrying, repetitive negativethoughts and verbalizations (nagging), and cognitive inflexibility. This patternusually responds much better to medications that enhance serotonin availabilityin the brain, such as Zoloft, Paxil (paroxetine), or Prozac (see cingulatemedications in chapter 10, \"Cingulate System Prescrip-tions ).DEEP LIMBIC CHECKLISTPlease read this list of behaviors and rate yourself (or the person you areevaluating) on each behavior listed.

To heal deep limbic system problems, we need tofocus on a number of diverse prescriptions: accurate thinking, the propermanagement of memories, the connection between pleasant smells and moods, andbuilding positive bonds between oneself and others. The following prescriptions,geared toward healing deep limbic system problems, are based on my own personalclinical experience with patients, as well as general knowledge about how themind/body works.DL PRESCRIPTION 1: KILL THE ANTSOur overall state of mind has a certain tone or flavor based largely on thetypes of thoughts we think. When the deep limbic system is over-active, it sets the mind's filter on \"negative.\" People who are depressed haveone dispiriting thought following another. When they look at the past, they feelregret. When they look at the future, they feel anxiety and pessimism. In thepresent moment, they're bound to find something unsatisfactory. The lens throughwhich they see themselves, others, and the world has a dim grayness. They aresuffering from automatic negative thoughts, or ANTs. ANTs are cynical, gloomy,and complaining thoughts that just seem to keep marching in all by themselves.ANTs can cause people to be depressed and fatalistic. \"I know I won't pass thattest on Tuesday.\" This kind of thinking makes for a self-fulfilling prophecy: Ifsomeone has already convinced himself that he won't pass, he probably won'tstudy very hard and he won't pass the test. If you are depressed all the time,you don't expect good things to happen, so you don't try very hard to make themhappen. The internal distress caused by melancholy thinking can make you behavein ways that alienate others, thus causing you to isolate yourself further. Onthe other hand, positive thoughts and a positive attitude will help you radiatea sense of well-being, making it easier for others to connect with you. Positivethoughts will also help you be more effective in your life. As you can see, whatgoes on in your mind all day long can determine whether your behavior isself-defeating or self-promoting.Here are some other examples of typical ANTs:\"You never listen to me.\"\"Just because we had a good year in business doesn't mean anything.\"\"You don't life me.\"\"This situation is not going to wor\\ out. I know something bad will happen.\"\"Ifeel as though you don't care about me.\"\"I should have done much better. I'm a failure.\"\"You're arrogant.\"\"You're late because you don't care.\"\"It's your fault.\"Healing the deep limbic system requires healing moment-to-moment thoughtpatterns. Unfortunately, there is no formal place where we are taught to thinkmuch about our thoughts or to challenge the notions that go through our head,even though our thoughts are always with us. Most people do not understand howimportant thoughts are and leave the development of thought patterns to chance.Did you know that every thought you have sends electri-cal signals throughout your brain? Thoughts have actual physical properties.They are real! They have significant influence on every cell in your body. Whenyour mind is burdened with many negative thoughts, it affects your deep limbicsystem and causes deep limbic problems (irritability, moodiness, depression,etc.). Teaching yourself to control and direct thoughts in a positive way is oneof the most effective ways to feel better.Here are the actual step-by-step \"thinking\" principles that I use in mypsychotherapy practice to help my patients heal their deep limbic systems.STEP 1Realize that your thoughts are real:• You have a thought.• Your brain releases chemicals.• An electrical transmission goes across your brain.• You become aware of what you re thinking.Thoughts are real, and they have a real impact on how you feel and how youbehave.STEP 2Notice how negative thoughts affect your body.Every time you have an angry thought, an unkind thought, a sad thought, or acranky thought, your brain releases chemicals that make your body feel bad (andactivate your deep limbic system). Think about the last time you were mad. Howdid your body feel? When most people are angry, their muscles become tense,their hearts beat faster, their hands start to sweat, and they may even begin tofeel a little dizzy. Your body reacts to every negative thought you have.Mark George, M.D., from the National Institute of Mental Health, demonstratedthis phenomenon in an elegant study of brain function. He studied the activityof the brain in ten normal women under three different conditions: when theywere thinking happy thoughts, neutral thoughts, and sad thoughts. During thehappy thoughts, the women demonstrated a cooling of the deep limbic system.During the sad thoughts, he noticed a significant increase in deep limbic systemactivity—powerful evidence that your thoughts matter!STEP 3Notice how positive thoughts affect your body.Every time you have a good thought, a happy thought, a hopeful thought, or akind thought, your brain releases chemicals that make your body feel good (andcool your deep limbic system). Think about the last time you had a really happythought. How did your body feel? When most people are happy, their musclesrelax, their hearts beat more slowly, their hands become dry, and they breathemore slowly. Your body also reacts to your good thoughts.STEP 4Notice how your body reacts to every thought you have.We know from polygraphs or lie detector tests, too, that your body reacts toyour thoughts. During a lie detector test, a person is hooked up to equipmentthat measures hand temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate,muscle tension, and how much the hands sweat.The tester asks questions, like \"Did you steal that car?\" If the person didsteal the car, his body is likely to exhibit a \"stress\" response. His hands getcolder, his heart goes faster, his blood pressure goes up, his breathing getsfaster, his muscles get tight, and his hands sweat more.The reactions take place almost immediately, whether he says anything or not.Remember, the deep limbic system is responsible for translating our emotionalstate into physical feelings of relaxation or tension. Now the opposite is alsotrue. If the subject did not steal the car, it is likely that his body willexperience a \"relaxation\" response. His hands will become warmer, his heart ratewill slow, his blood pressure will go down, his breathing will become slower anddeeper, his muscles will relax, and his hands will become drier.Again, almost immediately, his body has reacted to his thoughts. This happensnot only when you're asked about telling the truth— your body reacts to everythought you have, whether about work, friends, family, or anything else.STEP 5Thinly of bad thoughts as pollution.Thoughts are very powerful. They can make your mind and your body feel good, orthey can make you feel bad. Every cell in your body is affected by every thoughtyou have. That is why when peopleget emotionally upset, they frequently develop physical symptoms, such asheadaches or stomachaches. Some physicians think that people who have a lot ofnegative thoughts are more likely to get cancer. If you can think about goodthings, you will feel better.A negative thought is like pollution to your system. Just as pollution in theLos Angeles Basin affects everyone who goes outside, so, too, do negativethoughts pollute your deep limbic system, your mind, and your body.STEP 6Understand that your automatic thoughts don't always tell the truth.Unless you think about your thoughts, they are automatic; \"they just happen.\"But even if your thoughts just happen, they are not necessarily correct. Yourthoughts do not always tell the whole truth. Sometimes they even lie to you. Ionce treated a college student who thought he was stupid because he didn't dowell on tests. When his IQ was tested, however, we discovered that he was closeto a genius! You don't have to believe every thought that goes through yourhead. It's important to think about your thoughts to see if they help you orhurt you. Unfortunately, if you never challenge your thoughts, you just \"believethem\" as if they were true.STEP 7Tal\\bac\\to ANTs.You can train your thoughts to be positive and hopeful, or you can allow them tobe negative and upset you. Once you learn about your thoughts, you can choose tothink good thoughts and feel better, or you can choose to think bad thoughts andfeel lousy. That's right, it's up to you! You can learn how to change yourthoughts, and you can learn to change the way you feel.One way to learn how to change your thoughts is to notice them when they arenegative and talk back to them, as I'll explain below. When you just think anegative thought without challenging it, your mind believes it and your bodyreacts to it. When you correct negative thoughts, you take away their power overyou.STEP 8Exterminate the ANTs.Think of these negative thoughts that invade your mind like ants that bother youat a picnic. One negative thought, like one ant at apicnic, is not a big problem. Two or three negative thoughts, like two or threeants at a picnic, become more irritating. Ten or twenty negative thoughts, liketen or twenty ants at a picnic, may cause you to pick up and leave. Whenever younotice these automatic negative thoughts, or ANTs, you need to crush them orthey'll ruin your relationships, your self-esteem, and your personal power. Oneway to crush these ANTs is to write them down and talk back to them. Forexample, if you catch yourself thinking, \"My husband never listens to me,\" writeit down. Then write down a rational response, something like \"He's not listeningto me now, maybe he's distracted by something else. He often listens to me.\"When you write down negative thoughts and talk back to them, you take away theirpower and help yourself feel better. Some people tell me they have troubletalking back to these negative thoughts because they feel that they are lying tothemselves. Initially they believe that the thoughts that go through their mindare the truth. Remember, thoughts sometimes lie to you. It's important to checkthem out before you just believe them!Here are nine different ways that your thoughts lie to you to make situationsseem worse than they really are. Think of these nine ways as different speciesor types of ANTs. When you can identify the type of ANT, you begin to take awaythe power it has over you. I have designated some of these ANTs as red, becausethey are particularly harmful. Notice and exterminate ANTs whenever possible.ANT 1: \"Always/never\" thinking. This happens when you think something thathappened will \"always\" repeat itself, or that you'll \"never\" get what you want.For example, if your partner is irritable and she gets upset, you might think toyourself, \"She's always yelling at me,\" even though in reality she yells onlyonce in a while. But just the thought \"She's always yelling at me\" is sonegative that it makes you feel sad and upset. It activates your limbic system.All-or-nothing words like always, never, no one, every one, every time,everything are usually wrong. Here are some examples of \"always/never\" thinking:\"He's always putting me down.\"\"No one will ever call me.\"\"I'll never get a raise.\"\"Everyone takes advantage of me.\"\"You turn away every time I touch you.\"\"My children never listen to me.\"\"Always/never thinking\" ANTs are very common. If you catchyourself thinking in these absolutes, stop and make yourself recall examplesthat disprove your all-or-nothing attitude.ANT 2 (red ant): Focusing on the negative. This occurs when your thoughtsreflect only the bad in a situation and ignore any of the good. For example, Ihave treated several professional speakers for depression. After theirpresentations, they had the audience fill out an evaluation form. If one hundredforms were returned and two of them were terrible but ninety were outstanding,which ones do you think the speakers focused on? Only the negative ones! Itaught them to focus on the ones they liked a lot more than the ones they didn'tlike. It's important to learn from others, but in a balanced, positive way.Your deep limbic system can learn a powerful lesson from Eleanor Porter's bookPollyanna. In the book, Pollyanna went to live with her aunt after hermissionary parents died. Even though she had lost her parents, she was able tohelp many \"negative people\" with her attitude. She introduced them to the \"GladGame,\" looking for things to be glad about in any situation. Her father hadtaught her this game after she experienced a disappointment. She had alwayswanted a doll, but her parents never had enough money to buy it for her. Herfather sent a request for a secondhand doll to his missionary sponsors. Bymistake, they sent her a pair of crutches. \"What is there to be glad aboutcrutches?\" they thought. Then they decided they could be glad because theydidn't have to use them. This very simple game changed the attitudes and livesof many people in the book. Pollyanna especially affected the minister. Beforeshe came to town he preached hellfire and damnation, and he did not seem to bevery happy. Pollyanna told him that her father said that the Bible had eighthundred \"Glad Passages,\" and that if God mentioned being glad that many times,it must be because He wants us to think that way. Focusing solely on thenegative in situations will make you feel bad. Playing the Glad Game—looking forthe positive—will help you feel better. I'm not suggesting you view the worldthrough rose-colored glasses, only that you actively seek to find the positiveto give more balance and optimism to a world you experience too often asnegative.ANT 3 (red ant): Fortune-telling. This is where you predict the worst possibleoutcome to a situation. For example, before you dis cuss an important issue withyour partner, you predict that he or she won't be interested in what you have tosay. Just having this thoughtwill make you feel tense. I call fortune-telling a red ANT because when youpredict bad things, you help make them happen. Say you are driving home fromwork and you predict that the house will be a wreck and no one will beinterested in seeing you. By the time you get home you're waiting for a fight.When you see one thing out of place or no one comes running to the door, you'remore likely to explode and ruin the rest of the evening. Fortune-telling ANTsreally hurt your chances for feeling good. Remind yourself that if you could seethe future, you'd be a lottery billionaire by now.ANT 4 (red ant): Mind reading. This happens when you believe that you know whatother people are thinking even when they haven't told you. Mind reading is acommon cause of trouble between people. I tell people, \"Please don't read mymind, I have enough trouble reading it myself!\" You know that you are mindreading when you have thoughts such as \"She's mad at me.\" \"He doesn't like me.\"\"They were talking about me.\" I tell people that a negative look from someoneelse may mean nothing more than that he or she is constipated! You can't readanyone else's mind. You never know what others are really thinking unless theytell you. Even in intimate relationships, you cannot read your partner's mind.When there are things you don't understand, ask about them to clarify them. Stayaway from mind-reading ANTs. They are very infectious.ANT 5: Thinking with your feelings. This occurs when you believe your negativefeelings without ever questioning them. You tell yourself, \"I feel this way, soit must be so.\" Feelings are very complex and often based on powerful memoriesfrom the past. Feelings sometimes lie to you. Feelings are not always abouttruth. They are just feelings. But many people believe their feelings eventhough they have no evidence for them. \"Thinking with your feelings\" thoughtsusually start with the words \"I feel.\" For example: \"I feel as if you don't loveme.\" \"I feel stupid.\" \"I feel like a failure.\" \"I feel nobody will ever trustme.\" Whenever you have a strong negative feeling, check it out. Look for theevidence behind the feeling. Do you have real reasons to feel that way? Or areyour feelings based on events or things from the past? What's true, and what'sjust a feeling?ANT 6: Guilt beating. Guilt is not a helpful emotion, especially for your deeplimbic system. In fact, guilt often causes you to do things you don't want todo. Guilt beatings happen when you think with words like should, must, ought, orhave to. Here are some examples: \"I ought to spend more time at home.\" \"I mustspend more timewith my kids.\" \"I should have sex more often.\" \"I have to organize my office.\"Because of human nature, whenever we think that we must do something, no matterwhat it is, we often don't want to do it. It is better to replace \"guiltbeatings\" with phrases like \"I want to do ...\" \"It fits with my goals to do ...\"\"It would be helpful to do ...\" So in the examples above, it would be helpful tochange those phrases to \"I want to spend more time at home.\" \"It's in our bestinterests for my kids and me to spend more time together.\" \"I want to please myspouse by making wonderful love with him (or her) because he (or she) isimportant to me.\" \"It's in my best interest to organize my office.\" Guilt isn'tproductive. Get rid of this unnecessary emotional turbulence that holds you backfrom achieving the goals you want.ANT 7: Labeling. Whenever you attach a negative label to yourself or to someoneelse, you stop your ability to take a clear look at the situation. Some examplesof negative labels are \"jerk,\" \"frigid,\" \"arrogant,\" and \"irresponsible.\"Negative labels are very harmful, because whenever you call yourself or someoneelse a jerk or arrogant, you lump that person in your mind with all of the\"jerks\" or \"arrogant people\" that you've ever known and you become unable todeal with him reasonably as a unique individual. Stay away from negative labels.ANT 8: Personalizing. Personalizing occurs when you invest innocuous events withpersonal meaning: \"My boss didn't talk to me this morning. She must be mad atme.\" Or \"My son got into an accident with the car. I should have spent more timeteaching him to drive. It must be my fault.\" There are many other reasons forothers' behavior besides the negative explanations an abnormal limbic systempicks out. For example, your boss may not have talked to you because she waspreoccupied, upset, or in a hurry. You never fully know why people do what theydo. Try not to personalize the behavior of others.ANT 9 (the most poisonous red ant): Blaming. Blame is very harmful. When youblame something or someone else for the problems in your life, you become apassive victim of circumstances and you make it very difficult to do anything tochange your situation. Many relationships are ruined by people who blame theirpartners when things go wrong. They take little responsibility for theirproblems. When something goes wrong at home or at work, they try to find someoneto blame. They rarely admit their own problems. Typically, you'll hear from themstatements like:\"It wasn't my fault that\"That wouldn't have happened if you had\"How was I supposed to know\"It's your fault thatThe bottom-line thinking in the \"blame game\" goes something like this: \"If onlyyou had done something differently, I wouldn't be in the predicament I'm in.It's your fault, and I'm not responsible.\"Whenever you blame someone else for the problems in your life, you becomepowerless to change anything. The \"blame game\" hurts your personal sense ofpower. Stay away from blaming thoughts. You have to take personal responsibilityfor your problems before you can hope to change them.Summary of ANT Species1. \"Always/never\" thinking: thinking in words like always, never, no one,everyone, every time, everything2.

They can either help or hurt your deep limbicsystem. Left unchecked, ANTs will cause an infection in your whole bodilysystem. Whenever you notice ANTs, you need to crush them or they'll affect yourrelationships, your work, and yourentire life. First you need to notice them. If you can catch them at the momentthey occur and correct them, you take away the power they have over you. When anegative thought goes unchallenged, your mind believes it and your body reactsto it.ANTs have an illogical logic. By bringing them into the open and examining themon a conscious level, you can see for yourself how little sense it really makesto think these kinds of things to yourself. You take back control over your ownlife instead of leaving your fate to hyperactive limbic-conditioned negativethought patterns.Sometimes people have trouble talking back to these grossly unpleasant thoughtsbecause they feel that such obvious age-old \"truisms\" simply must be real. Theythink that if they don't continue to believe these thoughts, they are lying tothemselves. Once again, remember that to know what is true and what is not, youhave to be conscious of the thoughts and have an intelligent perspective onthem. Most negative thinking is automatic and goes unnoticed. You're not reallychoosing how to respond to your situation, it's being chosen for you by badbrain habits. To find out what is really true and what is not, you need toquestion it. Don't believe everything you hear—even in your own mind!I often ask my patients about their ANT population. Is it high? Low? Dwindling?Or increasing? Keep control over the ANTs in order to maintain a healthy deeplimbic environment.Whenever you notice an ANT entering your mind, train yourself to recognize itand write it down. When you write down automatic negative thoughts (ANTs) andtalk back to them, you begin to take away their power and gain control over yourmoods. Kill the ANTs by feeding your emotional anteater.picture27 [images/picture27.jpg]CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFEThe \"kill the ANTs/feed your anteater\" exercise is for whenever you feelanxious, nervous, depressed, or frazzled.Here are some examples of ways to kill these ANT Species of ANTYou never listen to \"Always/Never\"me.

Maybe she's just having a bad day. Bosses are people, too.I don't know that. Maybe they'll really like my speech.Sometimes I do things that aren't too smart, but I'm not stupid.I need to look at my part of the problem and look for ways I can make thesituation better.Your turn:EVENT: Write out the event that is associated with your thoughts and feelings.ANT SPECIES KILL THE ANT(write out the automatic (identify the type of (tal\\ bac\\ to the irrationalnegative thoughts) irrational thought) thoughts)DL PRESCRIPTION 3:SURROUND YOURSELF WITH PEOPLE WHOPROVIDE POSITIVE BONDINGHave you ever picked up a container that had ants crawling on it? Within secondsthey've crawled onto your body and you are hurriedly trying to brush them off.If you spend a lot of time with negative people, the same thing will happen. Youmay walk into a room in a buoyant mood, but before long their ANTs are going torub off on you. Their ANTs will hang out with your ANTs and mate! That's notwhat you want—so surround yourself with positive people as much as possible.Look at your life as it is now. What kind of people are around you? Do theybelieve in you and make you feel good about yourself, or are they constantlyputting you down and denigrating your ideas, hopes, and dreams? List the tenpeople you spend the most time with. Make a note of how much they support youand the ways in which you would like to be supported more.In my second year of college I got the bright idea that I wanted to go tomedical school. I was on the speech team, and one day I told my speech coachabout my dream to become a physician. The first thing out of her mouth was thatshe had a brother at Michigan State who hadn't made it into medical school.\"And,\" she added, \"he was muchsmarter than you are.\" The message was clear: You don't have a chance. Making abig decision like that was hard enough to do with encouragement; thedisheartening comment from the coach was a blow to my confidence I did not need.I went home with my spirits considerably dampened. Later that evening when Itold my father what had happened, he just shook his head and said, \"Listen, youcan do whatever you put your mind to. And if I were you, I wouldn't spend muchtime with that coach.\"If you think of life as an obstacle course, it is easy to see that the fewerobstacles in the road, the better. Negative people present unnecessary obstaclesfor you to overcome because you have to push your will to succeed over theirdoubts and objections and cynicism. Spending time with people who believe you'llnever really amount to anything will dampen your enthusiasm for pursuing yourgoals and make it difficult to move through life in the direction you want togo. On the other hand, people who instill confidence in you with a can-doattitude, people whose spirits are uplifting, will help breathe life into yourplans and dreams.It cannot be overemphasized how contagious the attitudes of others are and howmuch hidden influence they can exert. The reason so many people feel good aboutattending a positive-thinking seminar is that they have been in a room full ofpeople who were all reaffirming the best in one another. But let one of thosepeople go home and walk into a house where someone makes fun of his efforts andsays he's wasting his time and will never get anywhere anyway, and watch howfast the positive efforts of the seminar wear off!When you spend a lot of time with people, you bond with them in certain ways,and as I mentioned earlier, the moods and thoughts of others directly affectyour deep limbic system. If you go out with someone for dinner and after thefirst half hour you're beginning to feel bad about yourself, and then youremember that you always feel bad about yourself when you have dinner with thisperson, you are not imagining it; your deep limbic system is actually beingaffected by him or her. Deciding that you don't want to spend time with peoplewho are going to have an adverse effect on you doesn't mean you have to blamethem for the way they are. It simply means that you have the right to choose abetter life for yourself.I believe that limbic bonding is one of the key principles behind the success ofsupport groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. For years, clinicians have known thatone of the best ways to help people with serious problems like alcoholism is toget them to connect withothers who have the same problem. By seeing how others have learned from theirexperiences and gotten through tough times in positive ways, alcoholics can findthe way out of their own plight. While gaining information about their diseaseis helpful, forming new relationships and connections with others may be thecritical link in the chain of recovery. The same can be said about people withother diseases, such as cancer. Stanford psychiatrist David Spiegel demonstratedthe effectiveness of support groups for women with breast cancer. Those whoparticipated in a support group had survival rates significantly higher thanthose who didn't. How our deep limbic system functions is essential to lifeitself. Spend time with people who enhance the quality of your limbic systemrather than those who cause it to become inflamed.DL PRESCRIPTION 4:PROTECT YOUR CHILDRENWITH LIMBIC BONDINGIn a study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in 1997,researcher Michael Resnick, Ph.D., and colleagues at the University of Minnesotareported that teenagers who felt loved and connected to their parents had asignificantly lower incidence of teenage pregnancy, drug use, violence, andsuicide. So important is the bonding between children and parents that itoverrides other factors traditionally linked to problem behavior, such as livingin a single-parent home or spending less time with a child. The articleconcluded that the degree of connection (limbic bonding) that teenagers feelwith parents and teachers is the most important determinant of whether they willengage in risky sexual activity, substance abuse, violence, or suicidalbehavior.A study published in USA Today in the late 1980s reported that \"on average,parents spend less than seven minutes a week talking with their children.\" It isnot possible to \"limbically bond\" and have much of a relationship in such littletime. Children need actual physical time with their parents. Think about thetimes your parents spent positive one-on-one time with you. Did that make youfeel important, special?Some parents complain that their children are too busy or arc not interested inspending time with them. When this happens, I rccom mend that parents force theissue with their kids, telling them th.it they're important to them and thatthey need to spend time withthem. Of course, the way in which you spend time with them is critical. If youspend the time lecturing or interrogating them, neither of you will find it veryenjoyable and both of you will look for ways to avoid contact in the future.Here is an exercise that I've found extremely powerful in improving the qualityof time you have with your child. The exercise is called \"special time.\" Specialtime works. It will improve the quality of your relationship with your child ina very short period of time. Here are the directions for special time./. Spend twenty minutes a day with the child doing something that he or shewould life to do. It's important to approach the child in a positive way and saysomething life \"I feel we have not had enough time together and you're importantto me. Let's spend some special time together every day. What would you life todo?\" It's important to remember that the purpose of this time is to build thelimbic bond and relationship with your child. Keep it as positive as possible.2. During special time there are to be no parental commands, no questions, andno directions. This is very important. This is a time to build the relationship,not discipline difficult behavior. If, for example, you're playing a game andthe child starts to cheat, you can re-frame her behavior. You can say somethinglife \"I see you've changed the rules of the game, and I'll play by your rules.\"Remember, the goal of special time is to improve the relationship between youand your child, not to teach. Of course, at other times, if the child cheats itis important to deal straightforwardly with it.3. Notice as many positive behaviors as you can. Noticing the good is much moreeffective in shaping behavior than noticing the bad.4. Do much more listening than talfeng.I once received a phone call from a friend of mine who complained that hiseighteen-month-old daughter did not want anything to do with him when he camehome from work. He told me that he thought it must be \"one of thosemother-daughter things\" and that she'd probably grow out of it. I told him thatit probably meant he wasn't spending enough time with his daughter and that ifhe did special time with his daughter she would become much more open andaffectionate with him. My friend took my advice. He spent twenty minutes a daydoing something that his daughter chose (usually playing with blocks in herroom). He spent the time listening toher and feeding back what he heard her say. Within three weeks, his daughter'sbehavior dramatically changed. Whenever my friend would come home from work, hisdaughter would run to hug him, and she would hang on his leg all evening.Remember, spending actual physical daily time with your child will have apowerfully positive effect on your relationship and protect your child from manyof the problems in life.DL PRESCRIPTION 5: BUILD PEOPLE SKILLS TO ENHANCE LIMBIC BONDSIt has been shown that enhancing emotional bonds between people will help healthe limbic system. In one large study in which patients were treated for majordepression, the National Institutes of Health compared three approaches:antidepressant medication, cognitive therapy (similar to my ANT therapy), andinterpersonal psychotherapy (enhancing relationship skills). Researchers weresurprised to find that each of the treatments was equally effective in treatingdepression; many people in the medical community think that the benefits ofmedication far outweigh the benefits of therapy. Not surprising was the factthat combining all three treatments had an even more powerful effect. So notonly were pharmaceuticals and professional therapists helpful, but patientsplayed a significant role in helping each other. How you get along with otherpeople can either help or hurt your limbic system! The better you get along withthose around you, the better you will feel.I teach my patients the following ten relational principles to help keep theirdeep limbic systems (and the limbic systems of those they love) healthy andrewarding:1. Take responsibility for keeping the relationship strong. Don't be a personwho blames his or her partner or friends for the relationship problems. Takeresponsibility for the relationship and look for what you can do to improve it.You'll feel empowered, and the relationship is likely to improve almostimmediately.2. Never take the relationship for granted. In order for relation ships to bespecial, they need constant nurturing. Relationships suffer when they get putlow on the priority list of time and attention. Fo cusing on what you want in arelationship is essential to making it happen.3. Protect your relationship. A surefire way to doom a relationship is todiscount, belittle, or degrade the other person. Protect your relationships bybuilding up the other person.4. Assume the best. Whenever there is a question of motivation or intention,assume the best about the other person. This will help his or her behavior toactually be more positive.5. Keep the relationship fresh. When relationships become stale or boring, theybecome vulnerable to erosion. Stay away from \"the same old thing\" by looking fornew and different ways to add life to your relationships.6. Notice the good. It's very easy to notice what you do not like about arelationship. That's almost our nature. It takes real effort to notice what youlike. When you spend more time noticing the positive aspects of therelationship, you're more likely to see an increase in positive behavior.7. Communicate clearly. I'm convinced most of the fights people have stem fromsome form of miscommunication. Take time to really listen and understand whatother people say to you. Don't react to what you think people mean; ask themwhat they mean and then formulate a response.8. Maintain and protect trust. So many relationships fall apart after there hasbeen a major violation of trust, such as an affair or other form of dishonesty.Often hurts in the present, even minor ones, remind us of major traumas in thepast and we blow them way out of proportion. Once a violation of trust hasoccurred, try to understand why it happened.9. Deal with difficult issues. Whenever you give in to another person to avoid afight, you give away a little of your power. If you do this over time, you giveaway a lot of power and begin to resent the relationship. Avoiding conflict inthe short run often has devastating long-term effects. In a firm but kind way,stick up for what you think is right. It will help keep the relationshipbalanced.10. Make time for each other. In our busy lives, time is often the first thingto suffer in our important relationships. Relationships require real time inorder to function. Many couples who both work and have children often findthemselves growing further apart because they have no time together. When theydo spend time together, they often realize how much they really do like eachother. Making your special relationships a \"time investment\" will pay dividendsfor years to come.DL PRESCRIPTION 6:RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OFPHYSICAL CONTACTThe deep limbic system not only is involved in emotional bonding, it is alsoinvolved in physical bonding. Actual physical touching is essential to goodhealth. It would probably surprise some people to know that there are coupleswho can go for ten years and longer without touching each other. I have seenthem in my practice, and they invariably show such deep limbic system problemsas irritability and depression. It is only after I help them correct theirnontouching behavior that their depressive symptoms improve.Physical connection is also a critical element in the parent-infant bondingprocess. The caressing, kissing, sweet words, and eye contact from the motherand father give the baby the pleasure, love, trust, and security it needs todevelop healthy deep limbic pathways. Then a bond or connectedness between theparents and the baby can begin to grow. Without love and affection, the babydoes not develop appropriate deep limbic connectedness and thus never learns totrust or connect. He feels lonely and insecure, and becomes irritable andunresponsive.Touch is critical to life itself. In a barbaric thirteenth-century experiment,German Emperor Frederick II wanted to know what language and words childrenwould speak if they were raised without hearing any words at all. He took anumber of infants from their homes and put them with people who fed them but hadstrict instructions not to touch, cuddle, or talk to them. The babies neverspoke a word. They all died before they could speak. Even though the languageexperiment was a failure, it resulted in an important discovery: Touch isessential to life. Salimbene, a historian of the time, wrote of the experimentin 1248, \"They could not live without petting.\" This powerful finding has beenrediscovered over and over, most recently in the early 1990s in Romania, wherethousands of warehoused infants went without touch for sometimes years at atime. PET studies (similar to SPECT studies) of a number of these deprivedinfants have shown marked overall decreased activity across the whole brain.Bonding is a two-way street. A naturally unresponsive baby may inadvertentlyreceive less love from its parents. The mother and father, misreading theirbaby's naturally reserved behavior, may fecihurt and rejected and therefore less encouraged to lavish care and affection ontheir child. A classic example of this problem is illustrated by autisticchildren. Psychiatrists used to label the mothers of autistic children \"cold\";they believed the mother's lack of responsiveness caused the autism. In recenttimes, however, it has been shown in numerous research studies that autism isbiological and preceded any relationship. The mothers of autistic children intheir studies started out warm, but actually became more reserved when they didnot get positive feedback from their children. The kind of love that is criticalto making the parent-infant bond work is reciprocal.Love between adults is similar. For proper bonding to occur, couples need tohold and kiss each other, say sweet words, and make affectionate eye contact. Itis not enough for one side to give and the other to passively receive. Physicalmanifestations of love need to be reciprocated or the other partner feels hurtand rejected, which ultimately causes the bond to erode.Intimate relationships require physical love in order to flourish. The entirerelationship cannot consist of two people sitting in their respective cornershaving a lively conversation about the stock market (even if they both adore thestock market). An intimate relationship is missing something essential for humanbeings if there is not enough physical contact. Without that element, eventuallylove will sour, causing one person to withdraw and perhaps look for loveelsewhere.Reporting in a Life magazine cover story on touch, writers George Howe Colt andAnne Hollister cite numerous incidents of the healing power of touch: \"Studieshave shown massage to have positive effects on conditions from colic tohyperactivity to diabetes to migraines, in fact, every malady TRI [TouchResearch Institute, in Miami, Florida] has studied thus far.\" They report that\"Massage, it seems, helps asthmatics breathe easier, boosts immune function inHIV-positive patients, improves autistic children's ability to concentrate,lowers anxiety in depressed adolescents, and reduces apprehension in burnvictims about to undergo debridement. . . . Even in the elderly, eldersexhibited less depression, lower stress hormones, and less loneliness. They hadfewer doctor visits, drank less coffee, and made more social phone calls.\"Touch is essential to our humanity. Yet, in our standoffish, litigious society,touch is becoming less and less frequent. Touch your children, your spouse, yourloved ones regularly. Giving and receiv-ing massages on a regular basis will enhance limbic health and limbic bonding.DL PRESCRIPTION 7: SURROUND YOURSELF WITH GREAT SMELLSYour deep limbic system is the part of your brain that directly processes yoursense of smell. That is why perfumes and wonderful-smelling soaps are attractiveand unpleasant body odors are repellent. In the British journal The Lancet, a.study was reported on the benefits of aromatherapy using the oil from lavenderflowers. When used properly, lavender oil aroma helped people to feel lessstressed and less depressed. It also enhanced sleep. In aromatherapy, specialfragrances are used in a steam machine, in the bath, on the pillow, and inpotpourris. These fragrances can have an appreciable effect on people's moods.However, there is a difference between ingesting the substance and smelling it.When you ingest something, it goes to the stomach and is processed by thedigestive system. (Moreover, many essential oils, including lavender, aredangerous if ingested.) A smell, however, activates the olfactory nerves, whichgo directly to the deep limbic system.Consider cinnamon, used for cooking in a number of countries throughout theworld. Being of Lebanese descent, my mother used to put cinnamon in many dishesshe would bring to the table, including stuffed grape leaves, one of myfavorites. When I recently told her that the scent of cooked cinnamon isconsidered a natural aphrodisiac for men, she put her hand on her forehead andsaid, \"That's why I have seven kids, your father would never leave me alone.\"Many people have noticed that certain smells sometimes bring up very strong,clear memories, as if the whole feeling and sense of the original event werecoming back to them. There is a good reason for that: Smell and memory areprocessed in the same area of the brain. Because smells activate neurocircuitsin the deep limbic system, they bring about a more complete recall of events,which gives one access to details of the past with great clarity.Smells have an effect on moods. The right smells likely cool the deep limbicsystem. Pleasing fragrances are like an anti-inflammatory. By surroundingyourself with flowers, sweet fragrances, and other pleasant smells, you affectthe working of your brain in a powerful and positive way.DL PRESCRIPTION 8: BUILD A LIBRARY OF WONDERFUL MEMORIESBecause the deep limbic system stores highly charged emotional memories, some ofthe memories are bound to be disturbing. One common tool for therapists has beento get clients to scan the past for negative memories so they can reprocessthem. Unfortunately this form of treatment can be misguided, especially forpeople who are truly depressed. Depressed people have selective memories. Theytend to recall only things that are consistent with their mood. Because theyhave inflamed deep limbic systems, their mood is negative, and everything theyremember is negative. The whole process of recollection makes their lives looklike one long bad dream and convinces them that they are justified in beingdepressed. Therapists sometimes recognize this tendency in clients and interpretit to mean that the patient is somehow invested in being miserable. But there isanother explanation that has to do with how the mind/body works.Whenever you remember a particular event, your brain releases chemicals similarto those released when you originally input impressions of the event.Consequently, remembering brings back a similar mood and feelings. If the memoryis of your puppy getting hit by a car, it will put you in a melancholy mood.People whose bonding with their parents was tentative at best, or who had a lotof painful childhood experiences, already have a chemical imprint on the brainthat is negative. They will tend to take in new events in a negative way.Whenever someone looks at them the wrong way, it triggers the same chemicalpatterns in the brain that are common to their early experience. They also tendto dismiss someone smiling at them and not see it as a positive expressionbecause positive information is not consistent with their experience.This pattern is difficult to change because it sets up a whole way of viewinglife: The early patterns continually predispose the people toward taking thingsin such a way as to prove to themselves that they live in a negative universe.To change the pattern, they actually have to change their brain chemistry byremembering positive things. By calling up pleasant memories, they can tune into mental states that are healthier. The brain then takes on the same chemicalpatterns that were inputted at the time the healthy events occurred. Becausedoing this is such a healing process, I encourage those who have lost a lovedone to practice it. When someone dies, recalling the fights and the powerstruggles keeps the pain going because it sets upa negative mood that is self-perpetuating. By continually remembering the badthings, the emotional filter gets set to actually keep out the good memories.This tends to focus us on the unfinished business instead of the real love thatwe shared for many years.For those of us who do not have to battle depression on a daily basis, we maystill find ourselves in states more negative than our lives actually warrant.When unfortunate things do happen, we might go on thinking about them for longerthan is helpful to solve the problem. In order to balance the bad memories andheal the deep limbic part of our brain, it is important to remember the times ofour life that were charged with positive emotions.Make a list of the ten happiest times in your life. Describe them for yourselfin detail, using as many of the five senses as possible. What colors do youremember? What smells were in the air? Was there music? Try to make the picturecome alive. In a metaphorical sense you are going through the library shelves ofdaily experience and looking for the right book.If you have been involved in a long-term relationship with someone, recollectingthe history of your happy times together will enhance the bond between you.Positive memory traces actually encourage behavior that strengthens the bonds.Encouraging affirming thoughts in yourself—in other words, by recalling yourpartner's caress, how he or she was helpful to you this week, a look or gesturethat was particularly touching—will tune you in to a positive feeling, which inturn will dispose you to act lovingly. It might remind you to call your wifeduring the day, or to remember what special gift you could give your husband onhis birthday that will make him especially happy, or help both of you besupportive when times are tough.DL PRESCRIPTION 9: CONSIDER LIMBIC MEDICATIONSClinical depression, manic-depressive disorder, and severe PMS are moredifficult problems than the garden variety most people experience in the form ofbad moods. The deep limbic prescriptions I have mentioned so far may not beeffective enough to help the more seriously affected person live a happy,functional life. For complete heal ing to take place, the addition ofantidepressant medication or appropriate herbal treatment may be needed. A suresign that tin-prescribed medications are really treating the depression is thatthe deep limbic system activity normalizes. Whenever limbic activityyS CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFEnormalizes, there is a corresponding decrease in the patient's symptoms.In recent years, new antidepressants have entered the market that have a widerapplication and often have fewer side effects than the original antidepressants.Some of the new pharmaceuticals have the additional benefit of affecting thesubclinical patterns the rest of us are more likely to experience at some timein our lives, such as moodiness and negativity. The appendix containsinformation on current antidepressant medications that include the brand name,generic name, and dosage range. In treating clinical depression, it is importantto use enough medication for a long enough period of time. Often,antidepressants take from two to four weeks to become effective. It is essentialto work closely with your doctor on this; stopping medication suddenly can haveserious repercussions.Saint-John's-wort is an herbal treatment that has also been shown to have apositive impact on depression and a cooling influence on deep limbic structures.It has been used in Europe for many years and it is the most commonly prescribedantidepressant with the fewest side effects. For adults I recommend 500milligrams two times a day of Saint-John's-wort, containing 0.3% hypericin. Eventhough Saint-John's-wort has fewer side effects than traditionalantidepressants, it is not without side effects altogether. Some people becomesun-sensitive and become more easily sunburned. Some get acne. Also, I had onepatient who developed a seriously slow heart rate after taking it for a month. Ibelieve if you are taking Saint-John's-wort for depression, you should do itunder the supervision of a psychiatrist.For the best results with all my patients, however, I often combine the use ofmedications with the deep limbic prescriptions described in this chapter.DL PRESCRIPTION 10: TRY PHYSICAL EXERCISEPhysical exercise can be very healing to the deep limbic system. It releasesendorphins that induce a sense of well-being. The deep limbic system has manyendorphin receptors. Exercise also increases blood flow throughout the brain,which nourishes it so that it can function properly. Think about what blood flowand nourishment do for the rest of your body. A body that is constricted oremaciated doesn't feel good. The same is true for the brain. Good blood flowresets the deeplimbic system to a healthy level, which in turn favorably affects the person'smood.People who exercise regularly report a general sense of well-being that thosewho lead a sedentary lifestyle do not experience. They have increased energy anda healthy appetite, they sleep more soundly and are usually in a better mood.Over the years I have found it useful to prescribe physical exercise todepressed patients. This is even more important for people who are unable totolerate antidepressant medication. Instead of taking medication, some are ableto treat themselves, under their doctor's supervision, with a program ofstrenuous exercise, which makes them feel just as good as something from thepharmacy.In the fast pace of modern life—long work hours, rush-hour commutes, two-parentworking families—it is important to remember how essential exercise and personalcare are to good health; don't let them be left out. Technology has workedagainst us in some ways because many of the advances in the past twenty yearshave reduced and even eliminated physical activity and exertion from our dailylives. In the movie L.A. Story, Steve Martin runs out of his house, jumps in hiscar, drives ten yards to his neighbor's house, hops back out, and knocks at hisneighbor's door. A bit of an exaggeration, perhaps, but think of how many timeswe could walk to the neighborhood store to get a newspaper but instead decide tosave time and drive. This inactive lifestyle is causing our bodies to lose theirefficiency; in other words, they don't burn fat as they should. Experts innutrition, physiology, and medicine all agree that a program of physicalexertion on a continuing basis is required to maintain low body fat, a strongand healthy heart, and well-toned muscles.A good exercise program will pay limbic dividends as well:1. Exercise gives you more energy and keeps you from feeling lethargic.2. Exercise increases metabolism, will help keep your appetite in check, andwill therefore keep your weight down.3. Exercise helps to normalize melatonin production in your brain and enhancesthe sleep cycle.4. Exercise allows more of the natural amino acid tryptophan to enter the brain,enhancing mood. Tryptophan is the precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin,which has been found to be low in many depressed patients. Tryptophan is arelatively small amino acid, and it often has to compete with larger amino acidsto cross the bloodchannels into the brain. With exercise, the muscles of the body utilize thelarger amino acids and decrease the competition for tryptophan to enter thebrain. Exercise makes you feel better.A lot of people grumble and complain when they're told to get more exercise.They find exercise time-consuming and boring. My advice is to keep tryingdifferent activities until you find the one that suits you. Find out what youlike best. But make sure you get some form of regular workout (walking, running,cycling) on a daily basis, and an aerobic workout (which increases your heartrate and the flow of oxygen to your muscles) three times a week for at leasttwenty minutes a shot. Many people make the mistake of thinking that the sportthey play as a hobby fulfills their exercise quota, yet the truth is that itdepends on the sport. I once treated an obese man by outlining a nutrition andexercise program for him. Several weeks into it, he complained he wasn't losingany weight. When I asked what kind of workout he was getting, he told me heplayed two whole rounds of golf a week. I had to point out to him that walkingaround a golf course would not give him the level of activity he needed becauseit wasn't continuous—a golfer has to keep stopping to hit the ball. With asurprised look on his face, he said, \"Wait a minute, Doc. I don't walk and stopto hit the ball. I get out of the cart, hit the ball, and then get back in thecart. That's a lot of activity, hopping in and out of that cart!\"DL PRESCRIPTION 11: WATCH YOUR LIMBIC NUTRITIONOver the past decade there has been significant research on food, nutrients, anddepression. The results surprise many people. We have been inundated bynutritional experts and news reporters who tell us we should eat low-fat,high-carbohydrate diets. \"Low fat\" is everywhere. Unfortunately, low fat is notthe complete answer. In two studies in the American Journal of Psychiatry, menwho had the highest suicide rates had the lowest cholesterol levels. Our deeplimbic system needs fat in order to operate properly. Certainly, some fats arebetter for us than others, such as the omega-3 fatty acids found mostprevalently in fish. Protein is also essential to a healthy \"deep limbic diet.\"Proteins are the building blocks of brain neurotransmitters. Low levels ofdopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine have all been implicated in depressionand mood disorders. It is essential to eatenough protein in balanced amounts with fats and carbohydrates. Too much proteinfor some people may actually restrict the amount of \"brain proteins\" that crossinto the brain. Not enough protein will leave you with a brain protein deficit.The richest sources of protein are lean fish, cheese, beans, and nuts.Low serotonin levels are often associated with worrying, moodiness, emotionalrigidity, and irritability (a combination of deep limbic and cingulateproblems). To enhance serotonin levels, eat balanced meals with complexcarbohydrate snacks (such as whole-grain crackers or bread). Exercise can be atremendous help along with nutritional supplementation. The amino acid1-tryptophan, which was recently reapproved by the Food and Drug Administration,is an option. L-tryptophan is a naturally occurring amino acid found in milk,meat, and eggs. I have found it very helpful for patients to improve sleep,decrease aggressiveness, and improve mood control. In addition, it does not haveside effects, which gives it a real advantage over the antidepressants.L-tryptophan was taken off the market a number of years ago because onecontaminated batch from one manufacturer caused a rare disease and a number ofdeaths. The l-tryptophan itself actually had nothing to do with the deaths. Irecommend l-tryptophan in doses of 1,000-3,000 milligrams taken at bedtime.There have been some recent studies with inositol, from the B vitamin family,which you can get from a health food store. In doses of 12-20 milligrams a dayit has been shown to decrease moodiness and depression. Check with your doctorbefore taking these or any other supplements.Low norepinephrine and dopamine levels are often associated with depression,lethargy, trouble focusing, negativity, and mental fuzziness. To enhancenorepinephrine and dopamine levels, it is better to have protein snacks (such asmeat, eggs, or cheese) and to avoid simple carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta,cakes, and candy. Also, I often have my patients take natural amino acids suchas tyrosine (1,000-1,500 milligrams a day) for energy, focus, and impulsivitycontrol, and dl-phenylalanine (400 milligrams three times a day on an emptystomach) for moodiness and irritability. Again, check with your doctor if youwant to try these supplements."},{"pageContent":"Looking Into Anxiety and Fear.The Basal GangliaFUNCTIONS OF THE BASAL GANGLIA SYSTEM• integrates feeling and movement• shifts and smoothes fine motor behavior• suppresses unwanted motor behaviors• sets the body's idle speed or anxiety level• enhances motivation• mediates pleasure I ecstasyThe basal ganglia are a set of large structures toward the center of the brainthat surround the deep limbic system. The basal ganglia are involved withintegrating feelings, thoughts, and movement, along with helping to shift andsmooth motor behavior. In our clinic we have noticed that the basal ganglia areinvolved with setting the body's \"idle speed,\" or anxiety level. In addition,they help to modulate motivation and are likely involved with feelings ofpleasure and ecstasy. Let's look at each of these functions in more depth.The integration of feelings, thoughts, and movement occurs in the basal ganglia.This is why you jump when you're excited, tremble when you're nervous, freezewhen you're scared, or get tongue-tied when the boss is chewing you out. Thebasal ganglia allow for a smooth integration of emotions, thoughts, and physicalmovement, and when there is too much input, they tend to lock up. A patient ofmine was badly burned in a motorcycle accident in San Francisco. AsLooking Into Anxiety and Fear The Basal Ganglia System83picture28 [images/picture28.jpg]3-D side active viewpicture29 [images/picture29.jpg]3-D underside active viewhe lay burning on the ground, people stood nearby, frozen with fear, unable tomove to help him. For years he was confounded by their actions, wondering why noone had moved to help him. \"Didn't they care? Was I not worth trying to help?\"he wondered. For years this man lived with both the physical pain from theaccident and the emotional pain of feeling that others did not care enough tohelp him. He was relieved to learn a new interpretation of the situation: Theintensity of emotion caused by the fiery accident had overwhelmed the onlookers'basal ganglia and they had become unable to move, even though most of themprobably wanted to help.When the basal ganglia are overactive (as we have seen in the cast-of peoplewith anxiety tendencies or disorders), people are more likely to be overwhelmedby stressful situations and have a tendency to freeze or become immobile (inthoughts or actions). When thenbasal ganglia are underactive (as we have seen in people who have attentiondeficit disorder [ADD]), often a stressful situation moves them to action.People with ADD are frequently the first ones on the scene of an accident, andthey respond to stressful situations without fear. I know, for example, that oneof my friends who has ADD is a lot quicker at responding to crises than I am (asmentioned in chapter 2,1 have naturally overactive basal ganglia). I rememberone situation where we were leaving a restaurant and paying the bill at thecounter when the lady in front of us suddenly fell to the ground. My friendquickly went to her aid while I stood there frozen by the intensity of thesituation. And I had medical training; my friend did not! I used to feel guiltyabout not moving quickly in those situations, but it has helped to learn that mybrain just doesn't permit me to do so. The activity in my basal ganglia makes itharder to move quickly in anxiety-provoking situations.Shifting and smoothing fine motor behavior is another basal ganglia function andis essential to handwriting and motor coordination. Again, let's use the exampleof attention deficit disorder. Many children and adults with ADD have very poorhandwriting. The act of handwriting is difficult and often stressful for them.Their writing may be choppy or sloppy. In fact, many teens and adults with ADDprint instead of writing in cursive. They find printing easier because it is nota smooth, continuous motor movement, but rather a start-and-stop motor activity.Many people with ADD also complain that they have trouble getting their thoughtsout of their head and onto paper, a term called finger agnosia (the fingerscannot tell what the brain is thinking). We know that the medications that helpADD, such as the psychostimulants Ritalin, Dexedrine, or Adderall, work byenhancing the production of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia.These medications sometimes improve handwriting and enhance a person's abilityto get his or her thoughts onto paper to an amazing extent. In addition, manypeople with ADD say that their overall motor coordination is improved by thesemedications. Here is an example from one of my patients.Tommy, age fourteen, handwriting, no medicationpicture30 [images/picture30.jpg]picture31 [images/picture31.jpg]Tommy's handwriting after ADD diagnosis and treatment with stimulant medicationAnother clue about the motor control functions of the basal ganglia comes fromthe understanding of two other illnesses, Parkinson's disease (PD) andTourette's syndrome (TS). PD is caused by a deficiency of dopamine within thebasal ganglia system. It is characterized by a \"pill rolling\" hand tremor,muscle rigidity, cogwheeling (jerking, stop-and-start movements when trying torotate a joint), loss of agility, loss of facial expression, and slow movements.Often, giving persons dopamine-enhancing drugs, such as 1-dopa, significantlyalleviates these symptoms, allowing smoother motor movements. The basal gangliaare also involved in suppressing unwanted motor activity. When there areabnormalities in this part of the brain, people are more at risk for Tourette'ssyndrome, which is a combination of motor and vocal tics (more on TS later inthe chapter).In our brain-imaging work, we have seen that the basal ganglia must also beinvolved in setting the body's \"idle,\" or anxiety, level. Overactive basalganglia are often associated with anxiety, tension, increased awareness, andheightened fear. Underactive basal ganglia can cause problems with motivation,energy, and get-up-and-go.Interestingly, some of the most highly motivated individuals we have scanned,such as company CEOs, have significant increased activity in this part of thebrain. We theorize that some people can use this increased activity in the formof motivation to become \"movers\" in society. My mother, for example, who like mehas increased activity in this part of the brain, does tend to be a bit anxious,but she is a woman on the go. She plays golf four or five times a week, raisedseven children without appearing stressed, and is always up \"doing something\"for other people. I believe that using the increased energy and drive fromincreased basal ganglia activity helps ward oft anxiety.Another interesting finding about this part of the brain is thai the basalganglia are likely involved in the pleasure control loops ol the brain. Onebrain-imaging study performed by Nora Vblkow's group at the Brookhaven NationalLaboratory in Upton, New York,looked at where cocaine and Ritalin work in the brain. Both were taken up mostlyby the basal ganglia. Cocaine is an addictive substance; Ritalin, in dosesprescribed for ADD, is not. The study clearly showed why. Cocaine is a powerfulenhancer of dopamine availability in the brain, and it has both very fast uptakeand clearance from the brain. It comes on strong in a powerful wave, and thenit's gone. The user gets a high high, and when it's gone, he or she wants more.In contrast, while Ritalin also increases the availability of dopamine to thebasal ganglia, its effects are less powerful and it clears from the brain at amuch slower rate. Dr. Volkow's group postulated that activation of the basalganglia by cocaine perpetuates the compulsive desire for the drug. Ritalin, onthe other hand, enhances motivation, focus, and follow-through, but does notgive users a high or an intense desire to use more (unless at much higher dosesthan clinically prescribed). In fact, one the biggest clinical problems I havewith teenagers who have ADD is that they forget to take their medication.Intense romantic love can also have a cocainelike effect on the brain, robustlyreleasing dopamine in the basal ganglia. Love has real physical effects. I hadthe opportunity to scan a close friend, Bill, shortly after he had met a newwoman. He was head over heels for her. After their third date, when they spentthe day at the beach in each other's arms, my friend came by my office to tellme about his newfound love. He was so happy he almost seemed to have a drughigh. By coincidence, while Bill was talking, my nuclear technicianBill's Love-Affected Brainpicture32 [images/picture32.jpg]3-D underside active view Note increased right and left basal ganglia activity(arrows).came into my office and told me we had an extra dose of the isotope and could doanother scan if I had someone who needed one. Since I had an earlier scan ofBill's brain as part of our normal control group, I decided we'd scan him againand get a look at the brain of new love. To my amazement, his brain looked as ifhe had just taken a lot of cocaine. The activity in both the right and leftbasal ganglia was very intense, almost to the point of resembling seizureactivity. Love has real effects on the brain, as powerful as addictive drugs.PROBLEMS WITH THE BASAL GANGLIA SYSTEM• anxiety, nervousness• panic attacks• physical sensations of anxiety• tendency to predict the worst• conflict avoidance• Tourettes syndrome/tics• muscle tension, soreness• tremors• fine motor problems• headaches• low/excessive motivationANXIETY, NERVOUSNESS, AND PANIC DISORDERExcessive basal ganglia activity resets the body's idle to a revved-up level andcan make people feel anxious, nervous, tense, and pessimistic. Almost all of thepatients we have treated with panic disorder whom we've scanned had heightenedbasal ganglia activity. Here's an example of panic disorder.GaryGary came to see me about eight years ago. He had first gone to his doctorcomplaining of back pain. The doctor examined Gary's back and found a tenderspot over his kidneys. He asked Gary to get a kidney X ray. As soon as thedoctor asked him to get this X ray, Gary's thoughts took off: \"The doctor isgoing to find out I have cancer.\" (Notice the leap in logic!) But his thoughtsdidn't stop there. \"The doctor's going to find out I have cancer. I'm going tohave to havechemotherapy.\" Ten seconds later, he'd already put himself into treatment. \"I'mgoing to vomit my guts out, lose all my hair, be in a tremendous amount of pain,and then I'm going to die!\" His mind did this all in a span of thirty seconds.Then Gary had a panic attack. His heart began to race. His hands became icecold. He started to hyperventilate. And he broke out in a heavy sweat. He turnedto the doctor and said, \"I can't have that X ray.\"Bewildered, the doctor replied, \"What do you mean? You came to see me to gethelp. I need this X ray, so I can figure out. . .\"Gary said, \"No, you don't understand! I can't have the X ray!\"The doctor found my number, called me, and said, \"Daniel, please help me withthis guy.\"As Gary told me this story, I knew that he had a lifelong panic disorder. Garywas also an expert at predicting the worst, which was driving his panicsymptoms.In treating Gary, I taught him the Basal Ganglia Prescriptions given in Chapter6. I even went with him to have the kidney X rays because it was important tohave it done quickly. I hypnotized him, enabling him to be calm through theprocedure. He did wonderfully. He breathed in a relaxed way, and he went throughthe procedure without any problems—until the X-ray technician came back into theroom with a worried look on his face and asked Gary which side of his body wasgiving him pain. Gary grabbed his chest and looked at me like \"You SOB! I knewyou were lying to me about this! I'm going to die!\" I patted him on the leg andsaid, \"Look, Gary, before you die, let me take a look at the X ray\"(psychiatrists are also medical doctors). As I looked at his X ray I could seethat Gary had a big kidney stone, which can be terribly painful—but kidneystones don't usually kill anybody! Gary's basal ganglia, which were working toohard, put him through tremendous emotional pain by causing him to predict theworst possible outcome to situations.Basal ganglia anxiety can make pain worse. As Gary became more anxious about hispain, the anxiety signals caused his muscles to contract; the smooth muscles inthe ureter (the tube from the kidneys to the bladder) contracted, clamping downon the stone and intensifying the pain. A combination of psychotherapy, Nardil(a MAO-inhibitor antidepressant with antipanic qualities), and occasional use ofValium helped Gary live a more normal life.Anxiety-provoking situations also cause many people with overactive basalganglia to become frozen with fear and unable to leave their homes, a conditioncalled agoraphobia (fear of being in public).I have treated many people who have been housebound for years (one woman forforty years) because of fear of having a panic attack.MarshaMarsha, a critical care nurse, was forced into treatment by her husband. She wasthirty-six years old when she first began experiencing panic attacks. She was ina grocery store when all of a sudden she felt dizzy and short of breath, with aracing heart and a terrible sense of impending doom. She left her cart in thestore and ran to her car, where she cried for over an hour. After her firstepisode, the panic attacks increased in frequency to the point where she stoppedgoing out of her house, fearing that she'd have an attack and be unable to gethelp. She stopped working and made her husband take the children to and fromschool. She was opposed to any medication, because in the past her mother, inattempting to treat her own panic attacks, had become addicted to Valium and hadoften been quite mean to Marsha. Marsha did not want to see herself as being inany way like her mother. She believed that she \"should\" be able to control theseattacks. Her husband, seeing her dysfunction only worsen, took her to see afamily counselor. The counselor taught her relaxation and how to talk back toher negative thoughts, but it didn't help. Her condition worsened, and herhusband brought her to see me. Given her resistance to medication, I decided toorder a SPECT study to evaluate Marsha and then show her her own brain function.Marsha's Panic-Disorder-Affected Brainpicture33 [images/picture33.jpg]3-D underside active view Note increased right basal ganglia activity (arrow).Her SPECT study revealed marked increased focal activity in the right side ofher basal ganglia. This is a very common finding in patients who have a panicdisorder. Interestingly, patients who have active seizure activity also havefocal areas of increased activity in their brains. Due to the intense level ofemotions associated with panic attacks, my colleagues and I wonder if the basalganglia findings are equivalent to behavioral seizures.The findings on her scan convinced Marsha to try medication. I put her onKlonopin, an antianxiety medication that is also used for seizure control. In ashort period of time she was able to leave her house, go back to work, andresume her life. In addition to the medication, I taught her the group of BasalGanglia Prescriptions (given later), including sophisticated biofeedback andrelaxation techniques, and worked with her to correct her negative\"fortune-telling\" thoughts. Several years later she was able to completely stopher medication and has remained panic free.POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDERMarkMark, a fifty-year-old business executive, was admitted to the hospital shortlyafter he tried to kill himself. His wife had just started divorce proceedings,and he felt as though his life was falling apart. He was angry, hostile,frustrated, distrusting, and chronically anxious. His coworkers felt that he was\"mad all the time.\" He also complained of a constant headache. Mark was adecorated Vietnam veteran, an infantry soldier with over one hundred kills. Hetold me that he had lost his humanity in Vietnam and that the experience hadmade him \"numb.\"In the hospital, he said that he was tormented by the memories of the past. Markhad post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). With his wife leaving him, he feltthat he had no reason to live. Due to the severity of his symptoms, along with ahistory of a head injury in Vietnam, I ordered a brain SPECT study. It wasabnormal, showing marked increased activity in the left side of his basalganglia, the most intense activity in that part of the brain I had ever seen.Left-sided basal ganglia findings are often seen in people who are chronicallyirritable or angry. Mood stabilizers, such as lithium, Tegretol, or Depakote,can be helpful in decreasing the irritability and calming down focal \"hot\" areasin the brain. I placed Mark on Depakote. Almost immediately, his headachesdisappeared and heMark's PTSD- and Headache-Affected Brainpicture34 [images/picture34.jpg]j-Z) underside active view Note increased left basal ganglia activity (arrow).began to feel calmer. He stopped snapping at everyone, and he became more ableto do the psychological work of healing from his divorce and the wounds fromVietnam.In working with Mark, I often felt that his experiences in Vietnam had reset hisbasal ganglia to be constantly on the alert. Nearly every day for thirteenmonths of the war, he had had to be \"on alert\" in order to avoid being shot.Through the years, he had never had the chance to learn how to reset his brainback to normal. The medication and therapy allowed him to relax and feel, forthe first time in twenty-five years, that he had truly left the war zone.CONFLICT AVOIDANCEAnxiety is, by definition, very uncomfortable. Thus, people who are anxious tendto avoid any situations that make them more uncomfortable, especially dealingwith conflict. People who have basal ganglia problems tend to be frozen byconflict and consequently do what they can to avoid it. Unfortunately, conflictavoidance can have a serious negative impact on your life.LorenLoren, the owner of a neighborhood deli, hated conflict. He also had problemswith chronic feelings of tension and anxiety. Out oi fear <>l confrontation,these problem prevented him from firing employeeswho were not good for his business. They also caused him to be overly nice topeople who were negative to him, so Loren grew to resent his own lack ofassertiveness. His problems even caused marital difficulties. For years Lorenwouldn't talk about the things in his marriage that made him unhappy. He wouldjust hold them in until he finally exploded. Learning to deal with conflict wasthe centerpiece of his treatment.BetsyIn a similar way, Betsy's conflict-avoidant tendencies were ruining her career.She worked at a local oil company. Being very bright, she advanced quickly untilshe got to a position in which she had to deal with high-powered men who werecompetitive and accustomed to conflict and confrontation. Betsy reacted to thesemen by becoming quiet and deferential. She looked for ways to please them, inorder to avoid the anxiety that she perceived would overwhelm her if openconflict were to occur. Guess what happened? She stopped dead in her career. Shewas unable to be assertive and express her own ideas if they differed from thoseof others.Betsy initially came to see me for a severe panic disorder that prevented herfrom driving. Her husband and friends had to drive her everywhere because shewas afraid she'd have a panic attack.In treatment, I taught her how to deal with conflict. I taught her how to facethese men and not run away from them. Subsequently she began to speak up inmeetings and stand up for her positions in the company. Upper management beganto pay attention to her in a positive way.It's very important to learn ways to soothe your basal ganglia. Otherwise, theanxiety and programming from the past will rule your life.TOURETTE'S SYNDROME (TS)TS is a very interesting disorder that provides the bridge between the basalganglia and two seemingly opposite disorders, attention deficit disorder (ADD)and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). TS is characterized by motor and vocaltics lasting more than a year. Motor tics are involuntary physical movementssuch as eye blinking, head jerking, shoulder shrugging, and arm or leg jerking.Vocal tics typically involve making involuntary noises such as coughing,puffing,blowing, barking, and sometimes swearing (coprolalia). TS runs in families andmay be associated with several genetic abnormalities found in the dopaminefamily of genes. SPECT studies of TS patients, by my clinic and others, havefound abnormalities in the basal ganglia of the brain. One of the mostfascinating aspects of TS is its high association with both ADD and OCD. It isestimated that 60 percent of people with TS have ADD and 50 percent have OCD. Onthe surface it would appear that these are opposing disorders. People with ADDhave trouble paying attention, while people with OCD pay too much attention totheir negative thoughts (obsessions) or behaviors (compulsions). In lookingfurther at patients with both ADD and OCD, I have found a high association ofeach disease in their family histories. So, for example, people with ADD oftenhave relatives with OCD-like features and people with OCD have people in theirfamilies with ADD. There is even a subtype of ADD that has been termedoverfocused ADD; affected people have symptoms of both inattention andoverfocus.A crash course in the neurotransmitters (chemical messengers that help the brainto function) dopamine and serotonin is necessary here. In the brain there tendsto be a balancing mechanism between dopamine and serotonin. This balance tendsto be tipped in the basal ganglia. Dopamine is involved with motor movements,motivation, attention span, and setting the body's idle speed. Serotonin is moreinvolved with mood control, shifting attention, and cognitive flexibility. Whensomething happens in the brain to raise dopamine levels, serotonin becomes lesseffective; and when serotonin levels are raised, dopamine becomes lesseffective. For example, when I give someone a psychostimulant to treat ADD, itworks by effectively raising the availability of dopamine in the basal ganglia.This helps with focus, follow-through, and motivation. If I give him too much,he may become obsessive, moody, and inflexible (symptoms of too littleserotonin). Likewise, if I give someone who has ADD a medication that enhancesserotonin availability in the brain, such as Prozac (a selective serotoninreuptake inhibitor), his ADD symptoms are likely to become worse, but he won'tcare that they are worse and will also show lowered motivation.Since the basal ganglia are involved with dopamine production (low in ADD) andshifting and suppressing motor movements (lack of smoothness or cogwheeling mayresult in tics) and have been found to be overactive in OCD (in conjunction withthe cingulate gyrus), the basal ganglia are likely significantly involved in allthreeof these disorders. Blocking dopamine with certain antipsychotic medications,such as Haldol (haloperidol) and Orap (pimozide), helps to suppress tics butmakes ADD symptoms worse. Psychostimulants, such as Ritalin (methylphenidate),Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine), or Adderall (a combination of amphetamine salts),help ADD symptoms but have a variable effect on tics (they may make them betteror worse). In addition, as mentioned, psychostimulants tend to exacerbate OCDsymptoms and cause people to focus more on the thoughts or behaviors that botherthem. An interference mechanism in the basal ganglia is likely to be part of thepicture, upsetting the dopamine-serotonin balance in the brain.FINE MOTOR PROBLEMSAs discussed earlier, fine motor problems are often associated with basalganglia abnormalities. We discussed handwriting problems earlier in thischapter. Another interesting connection probably related to basal gangliaactivity is the development of fine motor tremors when we become anxious. When Ilecture in front of an audience, I don't hold papers in my hands because thepaper may start to rattle or shake in response to anxiety I feel. When the basalganglia are overactive, we are more at risk for increased muscle tone ortremors. In my practice I have often prescribed the medication propranolol tocalm the tremors musicians get during a performance.Increased muscle tension related to overactive basal ganglia activity is oftenassociated with headaches. I have noticed that a number of people with resistantheadaches have intense focal areas of increased activity in the basal ganglia.This seems to occur with both muscle contraction headaches (often described as apain in the back of the neck or as a tight band around the forehead) andmigraines (usually one-sided throbbing headaches that may be preceded by avisual aura or other warning phenomena). Interestingly, often anticonvulsantmedication such as Depakote or Tegretol, which decreases areas of overactivityin the brain, is helpful in decreasing some types of headaches.LOW AND HIGH MOTIVATIONAs mentioned, motivation tends to be low in dopamine-deficient states, such asADD. Interestingly, when serotonin levels are raised too high, decreasedmotivation also becomes a problem. Physiciansknow that when they overshoot the dose of serotonin-enhancing antidepressants(such as Prozac [fluoxetine], Zoloft [sertraline], Paxil [paroxetine], or Luvox[fluvoxamine]), lowered motivation is often the result. Many people have told methey stopped these medications because they stopped doing things that wereimportant to their business or home life. One CEO told me he had stopped takingZoloft because he wasn't keeping up with his paperwork and he really didn'tcare. \"That's not like me,\" he said.Heightened dopamine or basal ganglia states may also cause increased or evenexcessive motivation. As I mentioned earlier, we found that many CEOs ofcorporations have enhanced basal ganglia activity. They also tend to workexcessive hours. In fact, weekends tend to be the hardest time for these people.During the week, they charge through each day, getting things done. On theweekend, during unstructured time, they often complain of feeling restless,anxious, and out of sorts. Relaxation is foreign to them. In fact, it isdownright uncomfortable. Workaholics may be made in the basal ganglia. Theirinternal idle speed, or energy level, doesn't allow them to rest. Of course,there is a positive correlate. Many of the people in society who make thingshappen are driven by basal ganglia that keep them working for long periods oftime.BASAL GANGLIA CHECKLISTHere is a basal ganglia system checklist. Please read this list of behaviors andrate yourself (or the person you are evaluating) on each behavior listed. Usethe following scale and place the appropriate number next to the item.

They are based on what we have learned about the basal ganglia,as well as clinical experience with my patients. Remember, the basal ganglia areinvolved with integrating feelings and movement, shifting and smoothing motorbehavior, setting the body's idle speed or anxiety level, modulating motivation,and driving feelings of pleasure and ecstasy.BG PRESCRIPTION 1: KILL THE FORTUNE-TELLING ANTSPeople who have basal ganglia problems are often experts at predicting theworst. They have an abundance of fortune-telling ANTs (automatic negativethoughts). Learning to overcome the tendency toward pessimistic predictions isvery helpful in healing this part of the brain. Through the years, I have metmany people who tell me that they're pessimists. They say that if they expectthe worst to happen in a situation, they will never be disappointed. Even thoughthey may never be disappointed, they are likely to die earlier. The constant stress from negative predictions lowers immune system effectiveness andincreases the risk of becoming ill. Your thoughts affect every cell in yourbody.Learning how to kill the fortune-telling ANTs that go through your mind isessential to effectively dealing with the anxiety generated in this part of thebrain. Whenever you feel anxious or tense, try the following steps.STEP 1Write down the event that is causing you anxiety, for example, having to get upin front of people to give a speech.STEP 2Notice and write down the automatic thoughts that come into your mind. Odds are,when you are anxious, your thoughts are predicting a negative outcome to asituation. Common anxiety-provoking thoughts include \"They will think I'mstupid. Others will laugh at me. I will stumble on my words. I will shake andlook nervous.\"STEP 3Label or identify the thought as a fortune-telling ANT. Often, just naming thethought can help take away its power.STEP 4Talk back to the automatic negative thought and \"kill the ANT.\" Write down aresponse to defuse the negative thought. In this example, write something like\"Odds are they won't laugh and I'll do a good job. If they do laugh, I'll laughwith them. I know that speaking in public is nerve-racking for many people, andprobably some people will feel empathy for me if I'm nervous.\"Do not accept every thought that comes into your mind. Thoughts are justthoughts, not facts. As such, when they are based on basal ganglia anxiety, theyare often inaccurate. You do not have to believe every thought that comes intoyour mind. You can learn to change this pattern and help your basal ganglia cooldown by predicting the best things.BG PRESCRIPTION 2: USE GUIDED IMAGERYIt is important to set (or reset) your basal ganglia to a relaxed, healthylevel. This is best done by a regimen of daily relaxation. Taking twenty tothirty minutes a day to train relaxation into your body will have manybeneficial effects, including decreasing anxiety, lowering blood pressure,lowering tension and pain in the muscles, and improving your temperament aroundothers. Guided imagery is a wonderful technique to use on a daily basis.Instructions: Find a quiet place where you can go and be alone for twenty tothirty minutes every day. Sit in a comfortable chair (you can lie down if youwon't fall asleep) and train your mind to be quiet. In your mind's eye, chooseyour own special haven. I ask my patients, \"If you could go anywhere in theworld to feel relaxed and content, where would you go?\" Imagine your specialplace with all of your senses. See what you want to see; hear the sounds you'dlove to hear; smell and taste all the fragrances and tastes in the air; and feelwhat you would want to feel. The more vivid your imagination, the more you'll beable to let yourself go into the image. If negative thoughts intrude, noticethem but don't dwell on them. Refocus on your safe haven. Breathe slowly,calmly, deeply. Enjoy your minivacation.BG PRESCRIPTION 3: TRY DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHINGBreathe slowly and deeply, mostly with your belly. This is one of the mainexercises I teach my patients who have panic disorders. I actually write out apanic plan for them to carry with them. On the prescription it says: \"Wheneveryou feel anxious or panicky, do the following:• breathe slowly and deeply with your belly,• kill the fortune-telling ANTs,• distract yourself from the anxiety,• and if the above strategies are not completely effective, take the medicationI prescribe for anxiety\"Breathing is a very important part of the prescription. The purpose of breathingis to get oxygen from the air into your body and to blow off waste products suchas carbon dioxide. Every cell in your body needs oxygen in order to function.Brain cells are particularly sensitive to oxygen, as they start to die withinfour minutes whenthey are deprived of it. Slight changes in oxygen content in the brain can alterthe way a person feels and behaves. When a person gets angry, his or herbreathing pattern changes almost immediately. Breathing becomes shallower andsignificantly faster. This breathing pattern is inefficient, and the oxygencontent in the angry person's blood is lowered. Subsequently there is lessoxygen available to a person's brain and he or she may become more irritable,impulsive, confused, and prone to negative behavior (such as yelling,threatening, or hitting another person).Learn to breathe properly. Try this exercise:Sit in a chair. Get comfortable. Close your eyes. Put one hand on your chest andone hand on your belly. Then, for several minutes, feel the rhythm of yourbreathing.Do you breathe mostly with your chest? Mostly with your belly? Or with both yourchest and belly?The way you breathe has a huge impact on how you feel moment by moment. Have youever watched a baby breathe? Or a puppy? They breathe almost exclusively withtheir bellies. They move their upper chest very little in breathing. Yet mostadults breathe almost totally from the upper part of their chest.To correct this negative breathing pattern, I teach my patients to becomeexperts at breathing slowly and deeply, mostly with their bellies. In my office,I have some very sophisticated biofeedback equipment that uses strain gauges tomeasure breathing activity. I place one gauge around a person's chest and asecond one around his or her belly. The biofeedback equipment measures themovement of the chest and belly as the person breathes in and out. If you expandyour belly (using the diaphragm muscles there) when you breathe in, it allowsroom for your lungs to inflate downward, increasing the amount of air availableto your body. I teach my patients to breathe with their bellies by watchingtheir pattern on the computer screen. In about a half hour's time, most peoplecan learn how to change their breathing patterns, which relaxes them and givesthem better control over how they feel and behave.If you do not have access to sophisticated biofeedback equipment, lie on yourback and place a small book on your belly. When you breathe in, make the book goup, and when you breathe out, make the book go down. Shifting the center ofbreathing lower in your body will help you feel more relaxed and in bettercontrol of yourself. Practice this diaphragmatic breathing for five or tenminutes a day to settle down your basal ganglia.This has been one of the most helpful exercises for me personally. When I firstlearned how to breathe diaphragmatically, I discovered that my baselinebreathing rate was twenty-four breaths a minute and I breathed mostly with myupper chest. I had spent ten years in the military, being taught to stick mychest out and suck my gut in (the opposite of what is good for breathing).Quickly I learned how to quiet my breathing and help it be more efficient. Notonly did it help my feelings of anxiety, it also helped me feel more settledoverall. I still use it to calm my nerves before tough meetings, speakingengagements, and media appearances. I also use it, in conjunction withself-hypnosis, to help me sleep when I feel stressed. My current baselinebreathing rate is less than ten times a minute.BG PRESCRIPTION 4: TRY MEDITATION/SELF-HYPNOSISThere are many forms of meditation. They often involve diaphragmatic breathingand guided imagery. Herbert Benson, M.D., in his classic book, The RelaxationResponse, describes how he had his patients focus on one word, and do nothingbut that for a period of time each day. If other thoughts started to distractthem, they were to train their mind to refocus on that one word. He reportedstartling results from this simple exercise: His patients had significantdecreases in blood pressure and muscle tension.Self-hypnosis taps into a natural \"basal ganglia soothing\" power source thatmost people do not even know exists. It is found within you, within your abilityto focus your concentration. Many people do not understand that hypnosis is anatural phenomenon. It is an altered state we frequently go into and out of.Some natural examples of hypnosis include \"highway hypnosis,\" in which our senseof time and consciousness becomes altered. Have you ever taken a long trip andnot remembered a town you drove through? Or has a period of a couple of hourspassed in what seemed like only twenty or thirty minutes? Time distortion is acommon trait of hypnotic states. Have you ever become so engrossed in a goodbook or a good movie that two hours rushed by in what seemed like minutes? Webecome so focused that we enter a hypnotic state.As you might imagine, because I have naturally overactive basal ganglia with atendency toward anxiety, my medical internship year produced only more anxiety.When I worked on the eardiae inten sive care unit, I had a lot of troublegetting to sleep at night because 1was so anxious over the condition of the patients under my care. Being tired thenext day didn't help matters much. I had learned hypnosis as a medical student,and even used it with the nursing staff to help them stop smoking and loseweight. I hadn't thought of using it on myself. Besides, I rationalized, Iwasn't really very hypnotiz-able. Late one evening, one of my patients hadproblems getting to sleep. He requested a sleeping pill. I thought it might be abetter idea to use hypnosis to help him sleep. He was agreeable, and it workedquickly. When I made rounds the next morning, the patient asked me what he wasgoing to do that night when I wasn't on call. I taught him self-hypnosis andcame up with several sleep prescriptions. It then dawned on me to useself-hypnosis on myself. I learned that self-hypnosis, like most things, is askill that gets better with practice. I got to the point where I could putmyself to sleep in less than one minute through a simple self-hypnotictechnique. Good sleep also helps calm anxiety. Sleep deprivation makeseverything worse.Here are the easy self-hypnotic steps I use personally. Set aside two to threeten-minute periods the first day and just go through the following six steps.RelaxationSTEP 1Sit in a comfortable chair with your feet on the floor and your hands in yourlap.STEP 2Pick a spot on a wall that is a little bit above your eye level. Stare at thespot. As you do, count slowly to twenty. Notice that in a short while youreyelids begin to feel heavy. Let your eyes close. In fact, even if they don'tfeel as if they want to close, slowly close them anyway as you get to twenty.STEP 3Next, take a deep breath, as deep as you can, and very slowly exhale. Repeat thedeep breath and slowly exhale three times. With each breath in, feel your chestand belly rise and imagine breathing inpeace and calmness. With each breath out, feel your chest and belly relax andblow out all the tension, all the things getting in the way of your relaxing. Bythis time, you'll notice a calm come over you.STEP 4Next, tightly squeeze the muscles in your eyelids. Close your eyes as tightly asyou can. Then slowly let the muscles in your eyelids relax. Notice how much morethey have relaxed. Then imagine that relaxation spreading from the muscles inyour eyelids to the muscles in your face—down your neck into your shoulders andarms—into your chest and throughout the rest of your body. The muscles will takethe relaxation cue from your eyelids and relax progressively all the way down tothe bottom of your feet.STEP 5After your whole body feels relaxed, imagine yourself at the top of anescalator. Step on the escalator and ride down, slowly counting backwards fromtwenty. By the time you reach the bottom, you're likely to be very relaxed.STEP 6Enjoy the tranquillity for several moments. Then get back on the escalator,riding up. Count to ten. When you get to ten, open your eyes, feel relaxed,refreshed, and wide awake.To make these steps easy to remember, think of the following words:FOCUS (focus on the spot)BREATHE (slow, deep breaths)RELAX (progressive muscle relaxation)DOWN (ride down the escalator)UP (ride up the escalator and open your eyes)If you have trouble remembering these steps, you may want to record them and dothe exercise as you listen to the tape.When you do this the first several times, allow yourself plenty of time. Somepeople become so relaxed that they fall asleep for several minutes. If thathappens, don't worry. It's actually a good sign— you're really relaxed!When you've practiced this technique a few times, add visual imagery:Visual ImageryChoose a haven—a place where you feel comfortable, a place that you can imaginewith all your senses. I usually \"go\" to the beach. I can relax there, and itcalls up beautiful imagery for me. I can see the ocean, feel the sand between mytoes, feel the warm sun and breeze on my skin, smell the salt air and taste itfaintly on my tongue, hear the seagulls, the waves, children playing. Your havencan be a real or imagined place. It can be anyplace you'd like to spend time.After you reach the bottom of the escalator, imagine yourself in your veryspecial haven. Imagine it with all of your senses for several minutes.This is where the fun starts. After you've gone through the relaxation steps andhave imagined yourself in your haven, your mind is ripe for change.Begin to experience yourself as you want to be—not as you currently are but asyou want to be. Plan on spending at least twenty minutes a day on thisrefueling, life-changing exercise. You'll be amazed at the results.During each session, choose an idea, ideal, or feeling state to focus on. Staywith the idea, ideal, or feeling state until you can imagine yourself engulfedin it. For example, if you want to be more relaxed, see yourself in a calmstate, imagining it with all your senses. See yourself relaxed. Interact withothers in a positive, relaxed way. Smell the environment around you. Feel yourmuscles relax. Taste a warm beverage on your tongue, smell the aroma, feel thewarm cup in your hands. Experience the relaxation. Make it real in yourimagination, thereby beginning to make it real in your life.If the relaxation does not come immediately, remember that self-hypnosis is notmagic; it is a skill that needs attention and practice. It is well worth theeffort.Of note, I have a patient who tells me that whenever he comes out of aself-hypnotic state, his handwriting is better and he is much better coordinatedoverall. Sounds like basal ganglia soothing to me.BG PRESCRIPTION 5: THINK ABOUT THE \"18/40/60 RULE\"People with basal ganglia problems often spend their days worrying about whatother people think of them. To help them with this problem, I teach them the\"18/40/60 Rule\":When you're eighteen, you worry about what everybody is thinking of you;When you're forty, you don't give a damn about what anybody thinks of you;When you're sixty, you realize nobody's been thinking about you at all.People spend their days worrying and thinking about themselves, not you. Thinkabout your day. What have you thought about today—what others are doing or whatyou have to do or want to do? Odds are you've been thinking about yourself: whatyou have to do that day, who you're going to be with, what your bills are, theheadaches your boss or children are giving you, whether your spouse will haveany affection for you, and so on. People think about themselves, not you! Youneed to base your thoughts and the decisions you make on your goals—not yourparents' goals, not your friends' goals, and not your coworkers' goals.Worrying about what others think of them is the essence of people who have\"social\" phobias or those who are fearful or uncomfortable in social situations.The underlying problem is often that these people feel that others are judgingthem: their appearance, their clothes, their conversation, and so on.My patients are amazed to learn that all of the energy they put into worryingabout what others think of them is a total waste, energy they could moreconstructively put into meeting their own goals.Did you know that one of the most common fears in America is the fear of publicspeaking? I have had a number of patients tell me that they failed a class incollege because they refused to get up in front of the class and give a speech.That fear was based on how they felt others would judge them or theirpresentation. Those who have a fear of public speaking often tell themselvesthat people in the crowd will silently mock them or think bad things about them.The truth is, however, that probably some of the people in the audience aren'teven listening to their presentation because they are thinkingabout their anxiety over their own presentation or about their own personalproblems. The people in the audience who are listening are probably rooting forthe speaker to do a good job, because they know from personal experience howhard it is to get up in front of a group of people to speak.Stop worrying about what others think of you. Base your thoughts, yourdecisions, and your goals on what you want and what is important in your life. Iam not advocating a self-centered life; most of us want to see ourselves incaring relationships with others and being able to be helpful to others. But youneed to base your behavior on what you think, not on what you think othersthink.BG PRESCRIPTION 6: LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH CONFLICTAs with relationships between countries, peace at any price is often devastatingfor relationships between people. Many people are so afraid of conflict withothers that they do everything they can to avoid any turmoil. This \"conflictphobia\" actually sets up relationships for more turmoil rather than less.Here are four typical scenarios of people who fear conflict:i. In an attempt to be a \"loving parent,\" Sara finds herself always giving in toher four-year-old son's temper tantrums. She is frustrated by how much thetantrums have increased in frequency over the past year. She now feels powerlessand gives in just to keep the peace.2. Billy, a ten-year-old boy, was bullied by a bigger ten-year-old named Ryan.Ryan threatened to hurt Billy if he didn't give him his lunch money. To avoidbeing hurt, Billy spent the year terrified by Ryan.3. Kelly found herself feeling very distant from her husband, Carl. She feltthat he always tried to control her and treated her like a child. He wouldcomplain about how much money she spent, what she wore, and who her friendswere. Even though this really bothered Kelly, she said little because she didn'twant to fight. However, she found that her interest in sex was nonexistent, sheoften felt tired and irritable, and she preferred to spend her free time withher friends rather than with Carl.4. Bill worked as the foreman for Chet's company for six years. Over the pastfour years, Chet had become increasingly critical ofBill and belittled him in front of others. For fear of losing his job, Bill saidnothing, but he became more depressed, started drinking more at home, and lostinterest in his job.Whenever we give in to the temper tantrums of a child or allow someone to bullyor control us, we feel terrible about ourselves. Our self-esteem suffers, andthe relationship with that other person is damaged. In many ways we teach otherpeople how to treat us by what we tolerate and what we refuse to tolerate.\"Conflict phobics\" teach other people that it is okay to walk all over them,that there will be no consequences for misbehavior.In order to have any personal power in a relationship, we must be willing tostand up for ourselves and for what we know is right. This does not mean we haveto be mean or nasty; there are rational and kind ways to be firm. But firmnessis essential.Let's look at how the people in each of the four examples could handle theirsituations in more productive ways that would give them more power and more sayin their lives.1. Sara needs to make a rule that whenever her son throws a tantrum to get hisway, he will not get what he wants, period. No exceptions. By giving in to histantrums, Sara has taught her son to throw them, which not only hurts hisrelationship with his mother but will also teach him to be overdemanding withothers and will hurt his ability to relate socially to others. If Sara can befirm, kind, and consistent, she'll notice remarkable changes in a short time.2. By giving in to the bully, Billy taught Ryan that his intimidating behaviorwas okay. Standing up to him early, even if it meant being beaten up, would havebeen better than spending a whole year in pain. Almost all bullies pick onpeople who won't fight back. They use intimidation and are rarely interested inreal conflict.3. Kelly made a strategic mistake by avoiding conflict early in her relationshipwith Carl. By giving in to his demands early on, she taught him that it was okayfor him to control her. Standing up to him after years of giving in is verydifficult but essential to saving the relationship. I see many, many people whoeven after years oi giving in learn to stand up for themselves and change theirrelationship. Sometimes it takes a separation to convince the other person ofyour resolve, but the consequences of being controlled in a marriage are oftendepression and a lack of sexual desire. Standing up for oneself in a firm yetkind way is often marriage-saving.4. Bill gave up his power when he allowed Chet to belittle him in front ofothers. No job is worth being tormented by your boss. Yet most people find thatif they respectfully stand up to their boss, he or she is less likely to walkover them in the future. If, after standing up for yourself in a reasonable way,the boss continues to belittle you, it's time to look for a new job. Being in ajob you hate will take years off your life.Assertiveness means expressing your feelings in a firm, yet reasonable way.Assertiveness does not mean becoming mean or aggressive. Here are five rules tohelp you assert yourself in a healthy manner:/. Don't give in to the anger of others just because it maizes youuncomfortable.2. Don't allow the opinions of others to control how you feel about yourselfYour opinion, within reason, needs to be the one that counts.3. Say what you mean and stic\\ up for what you believe is right.4. Maintain self-control.5. Be kind, if possible, but above all be firm in your stance.Remember that we teach others how to treat us. When we give in to their tempertantrums, we teach them that that is how to control us. When we assert ourselvesin a firm yet kind way, others have more respect for us and treat usaccordingly. If you have allowed others to run over you emotionally for a longtime, they'll be a little resistant to your newfound assertiveness. But stick toit, and you'll help them learn a new way of relating. You'll also help cool downyour basal ganglia.BG PRESCRIPTION 7: CONSIDER BASAL GANGLIA MEDICATIONSAntianxiety medications are often very helpful for severe basal gangliaproblems. Nervousness, chronic stress, panic attacks, and muscle tension oftenrespond to medications when the other techniques are ineffective. There are fiveclasses of medication helpful in treating anxiety.Benzodiazepines are common antianxiety medications that have been available formany years. Valium (diazepam), Xanax (alprazolam), Ativan (lorazepam), Serax(oxazepam), and Tranxene (clo-razepate) are examples of benzodiazepines. There are several advantages to thesemedications: They work quickly, they generally have few side effects, and theyare very effective. On the negative side, long-term use can cause addiction. Inthe panic plan I discussed earlier, I often prescribe Xanax as a short-termantianxiety medication to use in conjunction with the other basal gangliaprescriptions.BuSpar (buspirone) is often very effective in treating long-term anxiety. Italso has the benefit of not being addictive. On the negative side, it takes afew weeks to be effective and it must be taken all of the time to be effective.It has been shown to have a calming effect on aggressive behavior.Certain antidepressants, such as Tofranil (imipramine) and the MAO inhibitorNardil (phenelzine), are especially helpful for people who have panic disorders.I have found these medications to be helpful in patients who have both limbicsystem and basal ganglia problems.Focal basal ganglia abnormalities, like focal limbic system changes, are oftenhelped with nerve-stabilizing medications, such as lithium, Tegretol, orDepakote.The last class of medications I find helpful in severe cases of anxiety isantipsychotic medications, such as Risperdal (risperidone), Mellaril(thioridazine), and Haldol (haloperidol). Because of their side effects, Iusually save these medications until I have tried other options. When psychoticsymptoms are present, these medications are often lifesaving.BG PRESCRIPTION 8: WATCH YOUR BASAL GANGLIA NUTRITIONAs mentioned in the Deep Limbic System Prescriptions chapter, what you eat hasan important effect on how you feel. If your symptoms reflect heightened basalganglia activity and anxiety, you'll do better with a balanced diet that doesnot allow you to get too hungry during the day. Hypoglycemic episodes makeanxiety much worse. I f you have low basal ganglia activity and low motivation,you will likely do better with a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet to giveyourself more energy during the day. It is also often helpful to eliminatecaffeine, as it may worsen anxiety. Eliminating alcohol is often a good idea aswell. Even though alcohol decreases anxiety iu the short term, withdrawal fromalcohol causes anxiety and places a person with anxiety at more risk for alcoholaddiction.Some herbal preparations such as kava extract and valerian root have also beenreported to help anxiety and likely have a calming effect on the basal ganglia.The B vitamins, especially vitamin B,, in doses of [00 to 400 milligrams, arealso helpful. If you take B,, at these doses, it is important to take a Bcomplex supplement as well. My patients have also found the scents fromessential oils of chamomile and lavender to be calming."},{"pageContent":"Looking Into Inattention and Impulsivity:The Prefrontal CortexFUNCTIONS OF THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX• attention span• perseverance• judgment• impulse control• organization• self-monitoring and supervision• problem solving• critical thinking• forwa rd th in fyng• learning from experience• ability to feel and express emotions• interaction with the limbic system• empathyThe prefrontal cortex (pfc) is the most evolved part of the brain. It occupiesthe front third of the brain, underneath the forehead. It is often divided intothree sections: the dorsal lateral section (on the outside surface of the pfc),the inferior orbital section (on the front undersurface of the brain), and thecingulate gyrus (which runs through the middle of the frontal lobes). Thecingulate gyrus, often considered to be part of the limbic system, will becovered m its ownThe Prefrontal Cortexpicture35 [images/picture35.jpg]dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex outside viewpicture36 [images/picture36.jpg]inferior orbital prefrontal cortex outside viewpicture37 [images/picture37.jpg]dorsal lateral prefrontal area 3-D side surface viewinferior orbital prefrontal area inside viewpicture38 [images/picture38.jpg]inferior orbital prefrontal area 3-D underside surface viewpicture39 [images/picture39.jpg]prefrontal area 3-D top-down surface viewchapter. The dorsal lateral and inferior orbital gyrus are often termed theexecutive control center of the brain and will be discussed together in thischapter. When necessary, I'll distinguish what is known about their functions.Overall, the pfc is the part of the brain that watches, supervises, guides,directs, and focuses your behavior. It supervises \"executive functions,\"governing abilities such as time management, judgment, impulse control,planning, organization, and critical thinking. Our ability as a species tothink, plan ahead, use time wisely, and communicate with others is heavilyinfluenced by this part of the brain. The pfc is responsible for behaviors thatare necessary for you to be goal-directed, socially responsible, and effective.North Carolina neuropsychiatrist Thomas Gualtieri succinctly summarized thehuman functions of the pfc as \"the capacity to formulate goals, to make plansfor their execution, to carry them out in an effective way, and to change courseand improvise in the face of obstacles or failure, and to do so successfully, inthe absence of external direction or structure. The capacity of the individualto generate goals and to achieve them is considered to be an essential aspect ofa mature and effective personality. It is not a social convention or an artifactof culture. It is hard wired in the construction of the prefrontal cortex andits connections.\"*The pfc (especially the inferior orbital pfc) helps you think about what you sayor do before you say or do it. For example, if you are having a disagreementwith your spouse and you have good pfc function, you are more likely to give athoughtful response that helps the situation. If you have poor pfc function, youare more likely to do or say something that will make the situation worse. Thepfc helps you problem-solve, see ahead of a situation, and, through experience,choose among the most helpful alternatives. Playing a game such as chesseffectively requires good pfc function.This is also the part of the brain that helps you learn from mistakes. Good pfcfunction doesn't mean that you won't make mistakes. Rather, it generally meansthat you won't make the same mistake over and over. You are able to learn fromthe past and apply its lessons. For example, a student with good pfc function islikely to learn that if he or she starts a long-term project early, there ismore time for research and less anxiety over getting it done. A student*John Ratey, M.D., ed., The Neuropsychiatry of Personality Disorders (Cambridge,Mass. Blackwell Science, 1995), p. 153.with decreased pfc function doesn't learn from past frustrations and may tend toput everything off until the last minute. Poor pfc function tends to appear inpeople who have trouble learning from experience. They tend to make repetitivemistakes. Their actions are based not on experience, but rather on the moment,and on their immediate wants and needs.The pfc (especially the dorsolateral pfc) is also involved with sustainingattention span. It helps you focus on important information while filtering outless significant thoughts and sensations. Attention span is required forshort-term memory and learning. The pfc, through its many connections within thebrain, helps you keep on task and allows you to stay with a project until it isfinished. The pfc actually sends quieting signals to the limbic and sensoryparts of the brain when you need to focus, and decreases the distracting inputfrom other brain areas. When the pfc is underactive, you become moredrstractible (this will be discussed in detail under attention deficit disorder,below).The pfc (especially the dorsolateral pfc) is also the part of the brain thatallows you to feel and express emotions; to feel happiness, sadness, joy, andlove. It is different from the more primitive limbic system. Even though thelimbic system controls mood and libido, the prefrontal cortex is able totranslate the workings of the limbic system into recognizable feelings,emotions, and words, such as love, passion, or hate. Underactivity or damage inthis part of the brain often leads to a decreased ability to express thoughtsand feelings.Thoughtfulness and impulse control are heavily influenced by the pfc. Theability to think through the consequences of behavior— choosing a good mate,interacting with customers, dealing with difficult children, spending money,driving on the freeway—is essential to effective living, in nearly every aspectof human life. Without proper pfc function, it is difficult to act inconsistent, thoughtful ways, and impulses can take over.The pfc has many connections to the limbic system. It sends inhibitory messagesthat help keep it under control. It helps you \"use your head along with youremotions.\" When there is damage or underactivity in this part of the brain,especially on the left side, the pfc cannot appropriately inhibit the limbicsystem, causing an increased vulnerability to depression if the limbic systembecomes overactive. A classic example of this problem occurs in people who havehad left frontal lobe strokes. Sixty percent of patients with these strokesdevelop a major depression within a year.Looking Into Inattention and Impulsivity Left Frontal Lobe Stroke\"5picture40 [images/picture40.jpg]picture41 [images/picture41.jpg]3-D side surface view 3-D underside surface viewNotice large hole of activity in left frontal lobe.When scientists scan the prefrontal cortex with neuroimaging studies like SPECT,they often do two studies, one in a resting state and a second during aconcentration task. In evaluating brain function, it is important to look at aworking brain. When the normal brain is challenged by a concentration task, suchas math problems or sorting cards, the pfc activity increases. In certain brainconditions, such as attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia, prefrontalcortex activity decreases in response to an intellectual challenge.PROBLEMS WITH THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX• short attention span• distractibility• lac\\ of perseverance• impulse control problems• hyperactivity• chronic lateness, poor time management• disorganizationprocrastinationunavailability of emotionsmisperceptionspoor judgmenttrouble learning from experience short-term memory problems social and testanxietyProblems in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex often lead to decreasedattention span, distractibility, impaired short-term memory, decreased mentalspeed, apathy, and decreased verbal expression. Problems in the inferior orbitalcortex often lead to poor impulse control, mood control problems (due to itsconnections with the limbic system), decreased social skills, and decreasedcontrol over behavior.People with pfc problems often do things they later regret, exhibiting problemswith impulse control. They also experience problems with attention span,distractibility, procrastination, poor judgment, and problems expressingthemselves. Situations that require concentration, impulse control, and quickreactions are often hampered by pfc problems. Test anxiety and social anxietymay be hallmarks of problems in the pfc. Tests require concentration and theretrieval of information. Many people with pfc problems experience difficultiesin test situations because they have trouble activating this part of the brainunder stress, even if they have adequately prepared for the test. In a similarway, social situations require concentration, impulse control, and dealing withuncertainty. Pfc deactivation often causes a person's mind to \"go blank\" inconversation, which naturally causes discomfort in social situations.When men have problems in this part of the brain, their emotions are oftenunavailable to them and their partners complain that they do not share theirfeelings. This can cause serious problems in a relationship. Many women, forexample, blame their male partners for being cold or unfeeling, when it isreally a problem in the pfc that causes a lack of being \"tuned in\" to thefeelings of the moment.ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER (ADD)ADD occurs as a result of neurological dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex. AsI've mentioned, when people with ADD try to concentrate, pfc activity decreasesrather than increasing as it does in the normal brains of control groupsubjects. As such, people with ADD show many of the symptoms discussed in thischapter, such as poor internal supervision, short attention span,distractibility, disorganization, hyperactivity (although only half the peoplewith ADD are hyperactive), impulse control problems, difficulty learning frompast errors, lack of forethought, and procrastination.ADD has been a particular interest of mine over the past fifteen years. Of note,two of my three children have this disorder. I tell peo-pie I know more about ADD than I want to. Through the SPECT research done in myclinic, along with the brain-imaging and genetic work done by others, we havefound that ADD is basically a genetically inherited disorder of the pfc, due inpart to a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine.Here are some of the common characteristics of ADD that clearly relate thisdisorder to the pfc.The Harder You Try, the Worse It GetsResearch has shown that the more people with ADD try to concentrate, the worsethings get for them. The activity in the pfc actually turns down, rather thanturning up. When a parent, teacher, supervisor, or manager puts more pressure ona person with ADD to perform, he or she often becomes less effective. Toofrequently when this happens the parent, teacher, or boss interprets thisdecreased performance as willful misconduct, and serious problems arise. One manwith ADD whom I treat told me that whenever his boss puts intense pressure onhim to do a better job, his performance becomes much worse, even though hereally tries to do better. While it is true that almost all of us perform betterwith praise, I've found that it is essential for people with ADD. When the bossencourages him to do better in a positive way, he becomes more productive. Inparenting, teaching, supervising, or managing someone with ADD, it is much moreeffective to use praise and encouragement, rather than pressure. People with ADDdo best in environments that are highly interesting or stimulating andrelatively relaxed.Short Attention SpanA short attention span is the hallmark of this disorder. People with ADD havetrouble sustaining attention and effort over prolonged periods of time. Theirattention tends to wander and they are frequently off task, thinking about ordoing things other than the task at hand. Yet one of the things that often foolsinexperienced clinicians assessing this disorder is that people with ADD do nothave a short attention span for everything. Often, people with ADD can payattention just fine to things that are new, novel, highly stimulating,interesting, or frightening. These things provide enough intrinsic stimulationthat they activate the pfc so the person can focus and concentrate. A child withADD might do very well in a one-on-one situation and completely fall apart in a classroom of thirty children. My son withADD, for example, used to take four hours to do half an hour's worth ofhomework, frequently getting off task. Yet if you gave him a car stereomagazine, he would quickly read it from cover to cover and remember every littledetail in it. People with ADD have long-standing problems paying attention toregular, routine, everyday matters such as homework, schoolwork, chores, orpaperwork. The mundane is terrible for them, and it is not a choice. They needexcitement and interest to kick in their pfc function.Many adult couples tell me that in the beginning of their relationship, thepartner with adult ADD could pay attention to the other person for hours. Thestimulation of new love helped him or her focus. But as the \"newness\" andexcitement of the relationship began to fade (as it does in nearly allrelationships), the person with ADD had a much harder time paying attention, andhis or her ability to listen faltered.DistractibilityAs mentioned above, the pfc sends inhibitory signals to other areas of thebrain, quieting intake from the environment so that you can concentrate. Whenthe pfc is underactive, it doesn't adequately dampen the sensory parts of thebrain, and too many stimuli bombard the brain as a result. Distractibility isevident in many different settings for the person with ADD. In class, duringmeetings, or while listening to a partner, the person with ADD tends to noticeother things going on and has trouble staying focused on the issue at hand.People with ADD tend to look around the room, drift off, appear bored, forgetwhere the conversation is going, and interrupt with extraneous information.Their distractibility and short attention span may also cause them to take muchlonger to complete their work.ImpulsivityLack of impulse control gets many ADD people into hot water. They may sayinappropriate things to parents, friends, teachers, supervisors, otheremployees, or customers. I once had a patient who had been fired from thirteenjobs because he had trouble controlling what he said. Even though he reallywanted to keep several of the jobs, he would just blurt out what he was thinkingbefore he had a chance to process the thought. Poorly thought-out decisions alsore-late to impulsivity. Rather than thinking a problem through, many ADD peoplewant an immediate solution and act without the necessary forethought. In asimilar vein, impulsivity causes these people to have trouble going through theestablished channels at work. They often go right to the top to solve problems,rather than working through the system. This may cause resentment from coworkersand immediate supervisors. Impulsivity may also lead to such problem behaviorsas lying (saying the first thing that comes into your mind), stealing, havingaffairs, and excessive spending. I have treated many ADD people who havesuffered with the shame and guilt of these behaviors.In my lectures I often ask the audience, \"How many people here are married?\" Alarge percentage of the audience raises their hands. I then ask, \"Is it helpfulfor you to say everything you think in your marriage?\" The audience laughs,because they know the answer. \"Of course not,\" I continue. \"Relationshipsrequire tact. Yet because of impulsivity and a lack of forethought, many peoplewith ADD say the first thing that comes to mind. And instead of apologizing forsaying something hurtful, many ADD people will justify why they said the hurtfulremark, only making the situation worse. An impulsive comment can ruin a niceevening, a weekend, even a whole marriage.\"Conflict SeekingMany people with ADD unconsciously seek conflict as a way to stimulate their ownpfc. They do not know they do it. They do not plan to do it. They deny that theydo it. And yet they do it just the same. The relative lack of activity andstimulation to the pfc craves more activity. Hyperactivity, restlessness, andhumming are common forms of self-stimulation. Another way I have seen peoplewith ADD \"try to turn on their brains\" is by causing turmoil. If they can gettheir parents or spouses to be emotionally intense or yell at them, that mightincrease activity in their frontal lobes and help them to feel more tuned in.Again, this is not a conscious phenomenon. But it seems that many ADD peoplebecome addicted to the turmoil.I once treated a man who would quietly stand behind a corner in his house andjump out and scare his wife when she walked by. He liked the charge he got outof her screams. Unfortunately for his wife, she developed an irregular heartrhythm because of the repetitive scares. I have also treated many adults andchildren with ADDwho seemed driven to get their pets upset by playing rough with or teasing them.The parents of children with ADD commonly report that the kids are experts atupsetting them. One mother told me that when she wakes up in the morning, shepromises herself that she won't yell at or get upset with her eight-year-oldson. Yet invariably by the time he is off to school, there have been at leastthree fights and both of them feel terrible. When I explained the child'sunconscious need for stimulation to the mother, she stopped yelling at him. Whenparents stop providing the negative stimulation (yelling, spanking, lecturing,etc.), these children decrease the negative behaviors. Whenever you feel likescreaming at one of these kids, stop yourself and instead talk as softly as youcan. At least in that way you're helping to break their addiction to turmoil andlowering your own blood pressure.Another self-stimulating behavior common in people with ADD is worrying orfocusing on problems. The emotional turmoil generated by worrying or being upsetproduces stress chemicals that keep the brain active. I once treated a women whohad depression and ADD. She started each session by telling me she was going tokill herself. She noted that this would make me anxious and seemed to enjoytelling me the gruesome details of how she would do it. After about a year oflistening to her, I finally figured out that she wasn't really going to killherself, she was using my reaction as a source of stimulation for her. Aftergetting to know her well, I told her, \"Stop talking about suicide. I do notbelieve you'll kill yourself. You love your four children, and I can't believeyou would ever abandon them. I think you use this talk as a way to keep thingsstirred up. Without knowing, your ADD causes you to play the game of 'Let's havea problem.' This ruins any joy you could have in your life.\" Initially, she wasvery upset with me (another source of conflict, I told her), but she trusted meenough to at least look at the behavior. Decreasing her need for turmoil becamethe major focus of psychotherapy.A significant problem with using anger, emotional turmoil, and negative emotionfor self-stimulation is damage to the immune system. The high levels ofadrenaline produced by conflict-driven behavior decrease the immune system'seffectiveness and increase vulnerability to illness. I have seen evidence ofthis deficiency over and over with the connection between ADD and chronicinfections, and in the increased incidence of fibromyalgia, chronic muscle painthought to be associated with immune deficiency.As noted, many folks with ADD tend to be in constant turmoil with one or morepeople, at home, work, or school. They seem to unconsciously choose people whoare vulnerable and pick verbal battles with them. Many mothers of children withADD have told me that they feel like running away from home. They cannot standthe constant turmoil in their relationship with the child with ADD. Manychildren and adults with ADD have a tendency to embarrass others for little orno good reason, which consequently distances their \"victims\" from them and canresult in social isolation. They may be the class clowns in school or thewisecrackers at work. Witzelsucht is a term in the neuropsychiatric literaturethat characterizes \"an addiction to making bad jokes.\" It was first described inpatients who had frontal lobe brain tumors, especially on the right side.DisorganizationDisorganization is another hallmark of ADD. It includes disorganization ofphysical space, such as rooms, desks, book bags, filing cabinets, and closets,as well as disorganization of time. Often when you look at work areas of peoplewith ADD, it is a wonder they can work there at all. They tend to have manypiles of \"stuff; paperwork is often hard for them to keep straight; and theyseem to have a filing system that only they can figure out (and then only ongood days). Many people with ADD are chronically late or put things off untilthe last possible minute. I've had several patients who have bought sirens fromalarm companies to help them wake up. Imagine what their neighbors thought! Theyalso tend to lose track of time, which contributes to lateness.Start Many Projects, but Finish FewThe energy and enthusiasm of people with ADD often push them to start manyprojects. Unfortunately, their distractibility and short attention span impairtheir ability to complete them. One radio station manager told me that he hadstarted over thirty special projects the year before but completed only ahandful. He told me, \"I'm always going to get back to them, but I get new ideasthat get in the way.\" I also treat a college professor who told me that the yearbefore he saw me he had started three hundred different projects. His wifefinished the thought by telling me he had completed only three.Moodiness and Negative ThinkingMany people with ADD tend to be moody, irritable, and negative. Since the pfc isunderactive, it cannot fully temper the limbic system, which becomes overactive,leading to mood control issues. In another subtle way, as mentioned, many peoplewith ADD worry or become over focused on negative thoughts as a form ofself-stimulation. If they cannot seek turmoil from others in the environment,they seek it within themselves. They often have a \"sky is falling\" attitude thatdistances them from others.ADD used to be thought of as a disorder of hyperactive boys who outgrew itbefore puberty. We now know that most people with ADD do not outgrow thesymptoms of this disorder and that it frequently occurs in girls and women. Itis estimated that ADD affects seventeen million Americans.KentKent was twenty-four years old when he first came to see me. He came for helpbecause he had gone to junior college six straight semesters. He hadn't beenable to finish one class! He wanted to go to medical school. Everybody told himhe was nuts! How could he go to medical school if he couldn't even finish ajunior college semester? Then his mother read my book Windows into the ADD Mind.She wondered if Kent didn't have attention deficit disorder.After I took Kent's history, it was clear he had suffered from an undiagnosedlifelong case of ADD. From the time he had been in kindergarten, he had hadproblems staying in his seat; he had been restless, distractible, disorganized,and labeled as an underachiever.Kent's father requested that we do a brain SPECT study to look at his brain. Hewanted to make sure Kent wasn't just looking for another excuse as to why he wasfailing in life. Kent's brain SPECT study at rest was normal. When Kent tried toconcentrate, however, the prefrontal cortex of his brain turned off.After the results of the clinical examination and brain SPECT studies, I putKent on Adderall, a stimulant medication that is used to treat symptoms of ADD.Kent had a remarkable response. He completed all of his classes at school thenext semester. In eighteen months he got his associate of arts degree, and threeyears later he finished his bachelor's degree in biology. He has been acceptedtoKent's ADD-Affected Brain, off and on Adderallpicture42 [images/picture42.jpg]picture43 [images/picture43.jpg]j-D underside surface viewAt rest; note overall good During concentration;activity. note markedly decreased pfcactivity (arrows).picture44 [images/picture44.jpg]During concentration, with Adderall; note overall improved activity.medical school! I did a follow-up study of Kent's brain on Adderall severalmonths after starting the medication. As you can see in the illustration, notonly did he have a positive clinical response, he also had significant increasedactivity in the prefrontal cortex.It's amazing how much his father's attitude has changed toward him. The fathertold me, \"I thought he was just lazy. It makes me sad to think of all thoseyears that he had a medical problem and I just hassled him for being lazy. Iwish I could have those years back.\"I have one man in my practice who has ten businesses because that's what heneeds in order to keep himself turned on! When thebrain is underactive, it's uncomfortable. Unconsciously, people learn how toturn it on, by conflict, coffee or cigarettes (both mild stimulants), anger, afast-paced life, or highly stimulating physical activities, such as bungeejumping. (Bungee jumpers need to be screened for this problem!)ADD in the FamilyMany psychiatric disorders are now thought to have significant geneticinfluences. ADD is no exception. Here's a family case example.Paul, age twenty, first came to see me because he was having trouble finishinghis senior year at college. He was having difficulty completing term papers, hecould not focus in class, and he had little motivation. He began to believe thathe should drop out of school and go to work for his father. He hated the idea ofquitting school so close to graduation. While I was writing up his history, Paultold me about bouts of depression that had been treated with Prozac in the pastwith little benefit. Paul's brain SPECT study showed increased activity in hislimbic system (consistent with depression) and deactivation of his prefrontalcortex during a concentration task (consistent with ADD). He had a wonderfulresponse to a combination of an antidepressant and a stimulant medication. Hefinished college and got the kind of job he wanted.When Paul's mother, Pam, saw his good response to treatment, she came to see mefor herself. As a child, she had had trouble learning. Even though she was veryartistic, she had little motivation for school and her teachers labeled her asan underachiever. As an adult, Pam went back to school and earned a degree inelementary school teaching. In order to student teach, however, she had to passthe National Teacher's Exam. She had failed the test on four occasions. Pam wasready to give up and try a new avenue of study when she saw Paul get better. Shethought maybe there was help for her. In fact, her brain SPECT studies were verysimilar to Paul's studies, and she responded well to the same combination ofmedications. Four months later, she passed the National Teacher's Exam.With two successes in the family, the mother then sent her teenage daughter,Karen, to see me. Like her brother, Karen was a bright child who hadunderachieved in school. At the time she came to see me, she lived in LosAngeles and was enrolled in a broadcast journalism course. She complained thatlearning the material was hardfor her. She was also moody, restless, easily distracted, and impulsive, and hada quick temper. Several years earlier she had been treated for alcohol andamphetamine abuse. She said that the alcohol settled her restlessness and theamphetamines helped her to concentrate. Karen's brain SPECT studies were verysimilar to her brother's and mother's. Once on medication, she was amazed at thedifference. She could concentrate in class and finished her work in half thetime it had taken before. Karen's level of confidence increased to the pointwhere she could look for work as a broadcaster, something she had been unable todo previously.The most reluctant member of the family to see me was the father, Tim—eventhough Pam, Paul, and Karen told him that he should. He said, \"There's nothingwrong with me; look at how successful I am.\" But his family knew different. Eventhough Tim owned a successful grocery store, he was reclusive and distant. Hegot tired early in the day, was easily distracted, and had a scattered approachto work. His success at work was due in part to his good employees, who made hisideas happen. He also had trouble learning new games, such as cards, whichcaused him to avoid certain social situations. Tim enjoyed high-stimulationactivities, such as riding motorcycles, even at the age of fifty-five. Lookingback, Tim had done poorly in high school. He had barely gotten through collegeeven though he had a very high IQ. He had tended to drift from job to job untilhe was able to buy the grocery store. Tim's wife finally convinced him to seeme. She was getting ready to divorce him because she felt that he didn't careabout her. He later told me that he was too physically and emotionally drainedto share much of his life with her.During our first session, Tim told me that he couldn't possibly have ADD becausehe was a success in business. But the more questions I asked him about his past,the more lights went on in his mind. His childhood nickname had been \"Speedy.\"He often hadn't done his homework. He had often been distracted or bored inschool. His energy was gone by the end of the morning. When I asked about hisorganization at work, he replied that her name was Elsa, his assistant. At theend of the interview, I commented, \"If you really do have ADD, I wonder howsuccessful you could be given what you've already accomplished.\" Tim's brainSPECT studies showed the classic pattern for ADD. When he tried to concentrate,the prefrontal cortex of his brain turned off, rather than on. When I told himthis, it really sank in. \"Maybe that's why it is hard for me to learn games.When I'm in a social situation and I'm pressed to learn or respond, I justfreeze up. So I avoid these situations.\"Tim had a remarkable response to Ritalin. He was more awake during the day, heaccomplished more in less time, and his relationship with his wife dramaticallyimproved. In fact, they both said they couldn't believe that their relationshipcould be so good, after all the years of distance and hurt.PSYCHOTIC DISORDERSPsychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, affect a person's ability todistinguish reality from fantasy. These disorders are complex and involveseveral brain areas, but at least in part, the neurotransmitter abnormalitiescause decreased prefrontal cortex activity.Schizophrenia is a chronic, long-standing disorder characterized by delusions,hallucinations, and distorted thinking. When I first started ordering SPECTstudies on schizophrenic patients, I began to understand why they distortedincoming information. The following case is a good example.JulieJulie was forty-eight years old when we met. She had a history ofhospitalizations for paranoid thinking, hearing voices, and delu-Julie's Schizophrenia-Affected Brainfrontpicture45 [images/picture45.jpg]3-D left-side surface viewNote markedly decreased prefrontal activity (arrow) and multiple hot spotsacross the cortex.sional thinking. Her main delusion centered around being assaulted by someonewho put an electrical probe inside her head that \"blasted her with electricity.\"She had been on multiple medication trials without success. Due to her lack ofresponsiveness to standard treatments, I ordered a brain SPECT study.In a sense, Julie was right. She was being blasted with electricity (note themultiple hot spots across her brain), but because she had such poor prefrontalcortex activity, she was unable to process the physiological nature of herillness and developed delusions to explain the pain she experienced. With theinformation from the SPECT study, Julie was placed on a high therapeutic dose ofDepakote, which lessened her pain and anxiety. For the first time, she waswilling to entertain the possibility that her symptoms were the result ofabnormal brain activity rather than an outside attack. A repeat SPECT studyeight months later showed a marked decrease in the hot spots in her brain alongwith subsequent increased activity in her prefrontal cortex.DerrickDerrick, a thirteen-year-old boy, was brought to see me because he was severelyanxious. He was displaying psychotic symptoms, feeling that other children weretalking about him behind his back and that they were out to embarrass him infront of his whole school. He started to avoid all contact with his peer group.He would hide in the middle of clothes racks at the mall if he saw people heknew, for fear that they might laugh at him or talk about him to others. He waspetrified by his thoughts and stopped going to school. He even seriouslyentertained the idea of suicide. He had crying spells, sleeplessness, andintense anxiety. He wasn't able to rationally discuss any of these feelings. Isaw him for months in psychotherapy and tried him on several antidepressant andantipsychotic medications without a therapeutic response. A SPECT scan was donewhen he was off all medication to help us understand what was going on.Derrick's SPECT study showed marked decreased activity in his prefrontal cortexat rest, a common finding in psychotic disorders. It is also a finding in somepsychotic depressions. The study led me to try alternative medications that weremore effective. Within two months there was a dramatic clinical improvement inhis condition. His mood was better, he had no suicidal thoughts, he was lesssensitive to others, and he was more able to entertain alternatives to hisdistorted thoughts. Seven months later, he was much more like a normal teenager.A repeated SPECT study performed six months later showed normalization of hisprefrontal cortex activity. Six years later, I see Derrick every six months. Heis an honors student at a highly prestigious university.The SPECT study was very important in the treatment process. It clearly showedDerrick's parents that his problems were based on brain abnormalities and thathe couldn't help what he thought or felt. They were able to respond in a moreunderstanding and helpful manner, lowering the level of stress at home.HEAD INJURIESDue to its location, the pfc is especially susceptible to head injury. Manypeople do not fully understand how head injuries, sometimes even \"minor\" ones inwhich no loss of consciousness occurs, can alter a person's character andability to learn. This is particularly true when the head injury occurs in thebrain's executive director, or pfc. Your brain is very soft. Your skull is veryhard. Your brain sits in a closed space that has many sharp edges. Unfortunatelyfor the pfc, the inferior orbital cortex sits on top of several sharp, bonyridges, and the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex lies just beneath the placewhere many blows to the head occur.It is important to note that many people forget they've had a significant headinjury in their lifetime. In our clinic we ask patients several times whether ornot they have had a significant head injury. Our intake paperwork asks thequestion \"Have you ever had a head injury?\" The historian, who gathers patients'histories before they see the physician, asks them again about head injuries.The computer testing we have patients complete asks a third time about headinjuries. If I see no, no, no to the question of head injuries, I'll ask again.If I get a fourth no, I will then say, \"Are you sure? Have you ever fallen outof a tree, fallen off a fence, or dove into a shallow pool?\" I am constantlyamazed at how many people remember head injuries that they'd long forgotten orfelt were too insignificant to remember. One patient, when asked the questionfor the fifth time, put his hand on his forehead and said, \"Oh yeah! When I wasfive years old, I fell out of a second-story window.\" Likewise, I have had otherpatients forget they went through windshields, fell out of moving vehicles, orwere knocked unconscious when they fell off their bicycles.Head injuries are very important. I often tell my patients that their brain ismore sophisticated than any computer we can think of designing. You can't drop acomputer without the potential of causing serious damage. In the same way, thebrain is fragile, and if trauma occurs in sensitive parts of the brain, it hasthe potential to alter one's ability to function.Phineas P. Gage provided scientists with an extreme example of pfc dysfunctionsecondary to a head injury. This was one of the first cases in the medicalliterature about the outcome of prefrontal cortex damage. In 1848, at the age oftwenty-five, Gage was an up-and-coming railroad construction foreman in Vermontworking for the Rutland and Burlington Railroad. His job involved using a longtamping iron to ignite explosives to forge a path for the railroad. One day ahorrible accident occurred; the explosion sent the tamping iron, which was 1.25inches in diameter, 3.5 feet long, and weighed 13.5 pounds, through the frontpart of Gage's skull. It went through his left eye, through the left prefrontalcortex, and out the top front part of his skull, leaving a circular 3.5-inchopening, destroying his left prefrontal cortex and surrounding areas of thebrain. Initially the interest in the case was due to Gage's survival, which wascalled \"unprecedented in surgical history.\" Later, in 1868, his physician turnedhis attention to the personality changes in Gage. Before the accident, Gage hadbeen an honest, reliable, deliberate person and a good worker. After theaccident, even though he did not appear to suffer any intellectual impairment,he was described as childish, capricious, and obstinate, showed poor judgment,used profane language, and was inconsiderate of others. In short, his physicianconcluded that \"Gage was no longer Gage.\" In many ways, the pfc contains ourability to be ourselves.ZacharyThe two following cases provide modern-day examples similar to that of Gage.Zachary, age ten, was a fun-loving, active boy who was loving, sweet, and eagerto please. He did well in kindergarten and was liked by the other children. Onesummer, between kindergarten and first grade, Zachary was riding in the frontseat of a car with his mother on a trip to his grandparents' house. All of asudden a drunk driver swerved into their lane, causing Zachary's mother toquicklyZachary's Trauma-Affected Brainpicture46 [images/picture46.jpg]3-D front-on surface view Note markedly decreased activity in the leftpfc.jerk the car to the side of the road. She lost control, and the car hit a tree.Zachary's mother's leg was broken in the accident, and Zachary, thankfullyrestrained by a seat belt, hit his head against the side window. He wasunconscious, but only for about ten minutes.About six weeks later, Zachary began to change. He exhibited aggressivebehavior, breaking his own toys and hurting his younger brother. He beganswearing, blurted out statements at inappropriate times, and interruptedfrequently. He became rude, contrary, argumentative, and conflict-seeking. Helost his friends at school the next year because he said things that hurt theirfeelings. He started to tease the two cats at home, so much so that they startedto avoid him whenever he came into the house. Six months after the accident, hismother knew that something was seriously wrong. She took him to a counselor, whothought the problem was psychological, a result of the accident. The counselorthought that Zachary and his mother were too close and developed strategies tohelp Zachary become more independent. That only seemed to make things worse.After two years of counseling, which didn't seem to help much, the motherconsulted Zachary's pediatrician. He diagnosed Zachary with ADD and put him onRitalin. But that didn't help very much either. In fact, it only seemed to makehim more aggressive. When Zachary was brought to see me at age nine, I thoughthe might have a chronic post-concussive syndrome, secondary to the accident. Hisbrain SPECT study revealed marked decreased activity in the left pfc anddecreased activity in the left occipital cortex, indicating both a frontand back injury (common in head injuries). In addition, there was decreasedactivity in his left temporal lobe. Given this constellation of findings, I putZachary on a combination of medication (an anticonvulsant, to stabilize hisaggressiveness and help his temporal lobe function, and amantadine [Symmetrel]to help with focus, concentration, and impulse control). He was also placed in aspecial class at school and given cognitive retraining exercises. Over the nextseveral months, his behavior began to improve.TimTim, age fifteen, was a high school sophomore. From his early youth he hadexhibited severe conduct problems. He was hyperactive, impulsive, moody, andfrequently angry, especially whenever someone would tell him no. His temperflared quickly, often over minor or trivial incidents. He had already beenarrested for shoplifting, he frequently cut school, and he was defiant andabusive toward his parents. He did not get along with other teens at school andseemed to \"never fit in.\" He smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and frequentlyused marijuana and cocaine. He had already been in one treatment program and wason his way to a second when his parents brought him to our clinic. He had triednumerous medications without success.His brain SPECT study showed one of the most severe cases of damage to the leftprefrontal cortex that I have ever seen. When heTim's Trauma-Affected Brainpicture47 [images/picture47.jpg]picture48 [images/picture48.jpg]3-D top-down surface view 3-D front-on surface viewNotice the large defect in the left mid-frontal region.was eighteen months old, he had fallen down a flight of stairs. His mother saidhe had never been quite the same since then. She knew there was a difference inhis personality. Given the level of functional damage to Tim's brain, I decidedto put him on a combination of an anticonvulsant medication and a stimulant. Ithelped lessen the rage and improve his impulse control. Given the level ofdamage, Tim's chances to gain full executive function are not very promising.The goal of treatment is to utilize every prescription available to help himdevelop auxiliary internal supervision mechanisms. Otherwise, legal authoritiesmay have to impose external supervision in some form of a contained setting,basically through no fault of Tim's. He doesn't have the capacity for internalsupervision that is housed in the prefrontal cortex.Understanding the functions and problems of this part of the brain is oftenessential to the healing process of people who suffer.PREFRONTAL CORTEX CHECKLISTHere is the prefrontal cortex checklist.

As such, it isessential in helping you reach your goals. To review, the prefrontal cortex isinvolved with concentration, attention span, judgment, impulse control, andcritical thinking. It controls your ability to look at situations, organize yourthoughts, plan what you want to do, and carry out your plans. Healing this partof the brain requires the development of a concept I call \"total focus.\"PFC PRESCRIPTION 1:DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN CLEAR FOCUS(THE ONE-PAGE MIRACLE)Developing an ability to stay totally focused will help guide your thoughts andbehavior and give you an \"auxiliary prefrontal cortex.\" It will help strengthenthe conscious part of your mind.In order to be successful in the world, we need to have clearly defined goals.Specifically, we need to know who we are and what we want to accomplish in ourrelationships, at work, and within ourselves. When we know what we want, we aremore likely to change our behavior to get it. Being goal-directed helps keep ourbehavior on track.134When I first mention goal setting to my patients, they generally look at me withblank stares or mutter something vague about a career or money. Goal setting isnot for some far-off dream. It is for now, and it is very specific. Making goalsthat you can focus on daily will make a big difference in your life.I have my patients, whether they are six or seventy-five years old, do agoal-setting exercise I developed called the One-Page Miracle (OPM). In studyingsuccessful children and adults, I have found that the one thing they have incommon is a sense of personal responsibility and clear goals. The One-PageMiracle will help guide nearly all of your thoughts, words, and actions. I'veseen this exercise quickly focus and change many people.Here's how to develop your own OPM. Take one sheet of paper and clearly writeout your major goals. Use the following main headings: Relationships, Work,Money, and Myself Under \"Relationships,\" write the subheadings spouse/lover,children, extended family, and friends. Under \"Work,\" write current and futurework goals, and include a section on how you want to get along with youremployer. Under \"Money,\" write your current and future financial goals. Under\"Myself,\" write out body, mind, spirit, and interests.Next to each subheading, clearly write out what's important to you in that area;write what you want, not what you don't want. Be positive and write in the firstperson. Keep a copy with you for several days so you can work on it over time.After you finish the initial draft (you'll want to update it frequently), placethis piece of paper where you can see it every day, such as in your briefcase,on your refrigerator, by your bed, or on the bathroom mirror. In that way, everyday you can focus your eyes on what's important to you. This makes it easier foryou to supervise yourself and to match your behavior to get what you want. Yourlife will become more conscious, and you will spend your energy on goals thatare important to you.I separate the areas of relationships, work, money, and self in order toencourage a more balanced approach to life. We burn out when our lives becomeunbalanced and overextended in one area at the expense of others.Here is an actual example of an OPM I did with one of my patients who had aprefrontal cortex injury. Jarred was married with three children, and he was anattorney in private practice. Since the injury he had had significant impulsecontrol problems and spent excessive time at work, which were the reasons hecame to see me.After you look at the example, fill out an OPM for yourself. Alteryou complete this exercise, put it up where you can see and read it every day.It is a great idea to start the day off by reading the OPM to get focused forthe day.Jarred's One-Page Miracle What Do I Want for My Life?RELATIONSHIPSSpouse: A close, kind, caring, loving partnership with my wife.Children: To be a firm, kind, positive force in my children's lives. To becontinually present in their lives in a way that enhances their development asresponsible, happy people.Extended Family: To continue to keep close contact with my parents and siblings,to provide support and love.Friends: To take time to maintain and nurture my friendships.WORK (To be the best attorney I can be)To have the best business possible, while maintaining a balanced life.Specifically, my work activities focus on spending time taking care of mycurrent clients, doing activities to obtain new clients, and giving back bydoing some pro bono work each month. I will focus on my goals at work and notget distracted by things not directly related to my goals.MONEY (Money is for needs, wants, and security)Short term: To be thoughtful of how our money is spent, to ensure it is directlyrelated to my family's and my needs and goals.Long term: To save 10 percent of everything I earn. I pay myself and my familybefore other things. I'll put away $2,500 each month in pension plan, giving methe desired result of $5,000 per month after the age of sixty-five.MYSELF (To be the healthiest person I can be)Body: To take care of my body on a daily basis.Mind: To feel stable, positive, and grateful, to live in a way that makes mefeel proud.Spirit: To live close to God and be the kind of person He would want me to be.Your Name:One-Page Miracle What Do I Want for My Life?RELATIONSHIPSSpouse/Lover:Children:Extended Family:Friends:WORK (To be the best I can be)MONEY (Money is for needs, wants, and security)Short term:Long term:MYSELF (To be the healthiest person I can be)Body:Mind:Spirit:Teach yourself to be focused on what's important to you. This aux iliaryprefrontal cortex will help you keep your life on track.PFC PRESCRIPTION 2:FOCUS ON WHAT YOU LIKE A LOTMORE THAN WHAT YOU DON'T LIKEThe prefrontal cortex is intimately involved with focus, concentration, andattention span. What we attend to and focus on has a very significant impact onhow we feel and act day to day. As I mentioned, many people with pfc challenges,especially people with ADD, tend to be conflict-driven as a way to \"turn on\"prefrontal cortex activity. Unfortunately, this behavior has many negative sideeffects, especially on relationships and immune system functioning. Focusing onwhat you like about your life and on what you like about others is a powerfulway to keep your prefrontal cortex healthy.To that end, I collect penguins. I have six hundred of them in my office,everything that you could imagine in penguin, including a penguin weather vane,penguin clocks, pens, pencils, puppets, dolls, watches, ties, a penguin sewingkit, a penguin vacuum cleaner, and even a pair of penguin boxer shorts given tome by a nine-year-old patient. I know this might sound a bit odd, but I tellpeople that given that I'm a psychiatrist I'm allowed to be a bit odd. Myfriends and family have an easy time buying for me at Christmas. Let me tell youwhy I collect penguins and how they relate to the prefrontal cortex.While I was doing my fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry, my familyand I lived in Hawaii. When my son was seven years old, I took him to a marinelife educational and entertainment park for the day. We went to the killer whaleshow, the dolphin show, and finally the penguin show. The penguin's name was FatFreddie. He did amazing things: He jumped off a twenty-foot diving board; hebowled with his nose; he counted with his flippers; he even jumped through ahoop of fire. I had my arm around my son, enjoying the show, when the trainerasked Freddie to get something. Freddie went and got it, and he brought it rightback. I thought, \"Whoa, I ask this kid to get something for me, and he wants tohave a discussion with me for twenty minutes, and then he doesn't want to doit!\" I knew my son was smarter than this penguin.I went up to the trainer afterward and asked, \"How did you get Freddie to do allthese really neat things?\" The trainer looked at my son, and then she looked atme and said, \"Unlike parents, whenever Freddie does anything like what I wanthim to do, I notice him! I give him a hug, and I give him a fish.\" The lightwent on in my head.Whenever my son did what I wanted him to do, I paid little attention to him,because I was a busy guy, like my own father. However, when he didn't do what Iwanted him to do, I gave him a lot of attention because I didn't want to raise abad kid! I was inadvertently teaching him to be a little monster in order to getmy attention. Since that day, I have tried hard to notice my son's good acts andfair attempts (although I don't toss him a fish, since he doesn't care for them)and to downplay his mistakes. We're both better people for it.I collect penguins as a way to remind myself to notice the good things about thepeople in my life a lot more than the bad things. This has been so helpful forme as well as for many of my patients. It is often necessary to have somethingthat reminds us of this prescription. It's not natural for most of us to noticewhat we like about our life or what we like about others, especially if weunconsciously use turmoil to stimulate our prefrontal cortex.Focusing on the negative aspects of others or of your own life makes you morevulnerable to depression and can damage your relationships.JamieLet me give you a clear example of how powerfully this prescription can work.Seven years ago I met Jamie, a fourteen-year-old teenager who was admitted tothe hospital after a suicide attempt. She had tried to kill herself because shewas doing so poorly in school and couldn't keep up academically with herfriends. On the night of her suicide attempt, she had a terrible fight with hermother, who berated her poor performance in school. Jamie had a family historyof depression on her father's side, and her mother had many ADD symptoms(although her mother refused to be evaluated and treated for it). Jamie felt sadand had a tendency to look at the negative side of things. She was alsodisorganized, had lifelong trouble focusing on her schoolwork, and wasimpulsive. She was diagnosed with depression and ADD. Jamie's SPECT study showeddecreased pfc activity and increased limbic activity. I started her onmedication (which over time became a combination of Prozac and Ritalin) andbegan seeing her in psychotherapy. Over several months, Jamie's conditionsignificantly improved. Her mood was better. School was easier for her. She hadbetter frustration tolerance and impulse control. Our initial weekly visitsafter leaving the hospital turned into every two weeks and thenmonthly by the end of the first year. She maintained good stability, except forone area of her life: She continued to fight with her mother.Two years after I began seeing Jamie, she came into my office and burst intotears. \"I just can't stand my mother,\" she started the session. \"All she does ispick on me and try to get me upset. I know you've told me not to react to her,but I can't help it. She knows every button on my body.\" As she finished tellingme about her latest fight with her mother, she looked around my office andasked, \"Dr. Amen, how come a grown man collects penguins?\" A bit amazed, Iasked, \"You've just noticed the penguins? After two years?\" I then told her thestory about Fat Freddie. Then I taught her about the concept of behavioralshaping, what the trainer had done to get Fat Freddie to be a star performer. Itold her, \"Let me teach you how to shape the behavior of your mother. Every timeyour mother is inappropriate with you, conflict-seeking toward you, rude, ormean to you, I want you to keep quiet and not react.\"\"Oh, Dr. Amen,\" she said, \"I don't know if I can do that. I've tried.\"I replied, \"I know, but I want you to try with this new understanding. And everytime your mother is appropriate with you, listens to you, and is helpful to you,I want you to put your arms around her and tell her how much you love andappreciate her.\" Jamie said she would try her best.When she came back a month later, she told me that she had had the best monthshe had ever had with her mother. Her mother had yelled at her only once, andshe hadn't reacted. And she had given her mother a lot of hugs. \"I think I getwhat you're teaching me, Dr. Amen,\" she said with a smile. \"I have power to helpthings or make things worse. Even though I'm not responsible for how my momacts, I have a big influence on the situation.\" I was proud of Jamie. She hadlearned that by focusing on what she liked about her mother a lot more than onwhat she didn't like, she could have a positive impact on a negative situation.I taught her not to be a victim of her mother, but to use her own positive powerin the situation.PFC PRESCRIPTION 3:HAVE MEANING, PURPOSE, STIMULATION,AND EXCITEMENT IN YOUR LIFEMeaning, purpose, stimulation, and excitement in your life help prevent shutdownand encourage you to focus by activating your prefrontal cortex. As I mentioned,in my clinical practice I treat manypatients with ADD. One of the most interesting parts of the disorder is thatthere is often an inconsistency of symptoms. People with ADD often struggle withroutine, mundane activities. However, when they are engaged in interesting,exciting, stimulating tasks, they often excel. A very important prescription Igive my patients is to ensure that they have positive meaning and stimulation intheir lives, whether it is in their work, their relationships, or theirspirituality. It can make all the difference between success and chronicfailure. A man with ADD in a boring job he dislikes is likely to need moremedication to be effective. If he is in a job that excites and motivates him, heis likely to need less medication. The situation will provide the stimulation.Let me give you an example.SethSeth, a very successful owner of several video outlets in the Bay Area, cameinto my office feeling very frustrated. He had had a nice response to treatmentfor his ADD, so I wondered what had gone wrong. \"Doc,\" he started, \"I just feellike I have a bad character. I must be a bad person. I try and try to get mypaperwork done, but I just can't bring myself to do it. It bores me literally totears. Even with the medication and therapy, I still can't get it done.\" I askedfor more information. \"I sit down to do it,\" he continued, \"when the meds arefully effective, and I just stare at the paperwork. I don't know what holds meback.\" \"Seth,\" I replied, \"it may have nothing to do with your character. Youare a loving husband and father, you have a successful business that gives jobsto lots of people, and you care about others. Maybe what you have is a paperworkdisability. Many people with ADD excel at things they like to do and areterrible at things that provide little motivation, like paperwork. Maybe youneed to hire someone to do the paperwork. That will leave you more time to growthe business further.\"What Seth said next hit the mark. \"That makes perfect sense to me. When I was ateenager, I loved to sail. But I never wanted to go out when the water was calm.I waited for the storm warnings to come up before I went out. During the storm Iwould be scared to death and wondered why I would do such a crazy thing. Butwhen the storm was over and I got back to shore, I couldn't wait to go outagain. It was the excitement and stimulation that motivated me.\"Seth hired someone to do his paperwork. His business grew as he spent more timeon the things he did best.PFC PRESCRIPTION 4:GET ORGANIZED; GET HELPWHEN YOU NEED ITPeople who have pfc difficulties often have problems with organization. Learningorganizational skills can be very helpful. Day planners and computerorganizational programs can be lifesaving. It is also important to know yourlimitations and, when possible, surround yourself with people who can helporganize you. These people can be intimately involved with your life, such as aspouse or friend, or they can be people who work for you. The most successfulpeople I have seen who have ADD or other prefrontal cortex problems are thosepeople who have others help them with organization. Don't be embarrassed to askfor help.Here are some tips to help with organization:• Set clear goals for your life (as mentioned in pfc Prescription 1) in thefollowing areas: relationships (spouse/lover, children, family, and friends),wor\\, money, physical health, emotional health, and spirituality. Then as\\yourself every day, \"Is my behavior getting me what I want?\" This criticalexercise will help you stay on track in your life. Manage your time in a waythat is consistent with the goals you have for your life.• Take the extra time to organize your work area on a regularly scheduled basis.Devote some time each week to organization. Otherwise procrastination will takeover.• Keep up with the paperwork or have someone do it for you.• Prioritize your projects.• Make deadlines for yourself• Keep TO DO lists, and revise them on a regular basis.• Keep an appointment and planning book with you at all times.• Use a portable cassette recorder to help you remember ideas throughout theday.• Break down overwhelming tasks into small tas\\s. This happens on assembly linesevery day. Remember, \"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.\"• Do unpleasant tasks first. That way, you'll have the more pleasurable ones toloo\\forward to. If you save the unpleasant tasks for last, you II have littleincentive to get to them.• Use file folders, desk organizers, and labeled storage boxes to organize yourpaperwor\\.• Hire a professional organizer to help you get and stay organized.When my son with ADD was sixteen years old, I hired a professional organizer tohelp him. He didn't want to listen to me (what did I know —/ was only his dad).She was a gifted woman who helped him immensely. She organized his room withhim, as well as his boo\\ bag for school, his assignment boo\\, and his studyschedule. She helped him set up systems, and then she came bac\\ once a month towor\\ with him and help him maintain what he learned. Today he is good withorganization. Li%e many people with ADD, it's not natural for him, but he hasthe basics down and he is not a victim of his tendencies toward disorganization.PFC PRESCRIPTION 6:CONSIDER BRAIN-WAVEBIOFEEDBACK TRAININGI've discussed ADD as primarily a problem in the prefrontal cortex. Medicationis the cornerstone of the \"biological\" treatments for ADD, but it is not theonly biological treatment. Over the past fifteen years, researchers includingJoel Lubar, Ph.D., of the University of Tennessee, have demonstrated theeffectiveness of a powerful adjunctive tool in the treatment of ADD and otherprefrontal cortex problems: brain-wave or EEG biofeedback.Biofeedback in general is a treatment technique that utilizes instruments tomeasure physiological responses in a person's body (such as hand temperature,sweat gland activity, breathing rates, heart rates, blood pressure, andbrain-wave patterns). The instruments feed the information on these body systemsto the patient, who can then learn how to change them. In brain-wavebiofeedback, we measure the level of brainwave activity throughout the brain.There are five types of brain-wave patterns:• delta brain waves (1-4 cycles per second): very slow brain waves, occurringmostly during sleep;• theta brain waves ( 5-7 cycles per second): slow brain waves, occurring duringdaydreaming, relaxation, and twilight states;• alpha brain waves (8-12 cycles per second): brain waves occurring duringrelaxed states;• SMR (sensorimotor rhythm) brain waves (12-15 cycles per second): brain wavesoccurring during states of focused relaxation;• beta brain waves (13-24 cycles per second): fast brain waves occurring duringconcentration or mental wor\\ states.In evaluating more than six thousand children with ADD, Dr. Lubar found that thebasic problem with these children is that they lack the ability to maintain\"beta\" concentration states for sustained periods of time. He also found thatthese children have excessive \"theta\" daydreaming brain-wave activity. Dr. Lubarfound that through the use of EEG biofeedback, children could be taught toincrease the amount of \"beta\" brain waves and decrease the amount of \"theta,\" ordaydreaming, brain waves.The basic biofeedback technique teaches children to play games with their minds.The more they can concentrate and produce \"beta\" states, the more rewards theycan accrue. With my clinic's EEG biofeedback equipment, for example, a childsits in front of a computer monitor and watches a game screen. If he increasesthe \"beta\" activity or decreases the \"theta\" activity, the game continues. Thegame stops, however, when the player is unable to maintain the desiredbrain-wave state. Children find the screens fun, and we gradually shape theirbrain-wave pattern to a more normal one. From the research, we know that thistreatment technique is not an overnight cure. Children often have to practicethis form of biofeedback for between one and two years.In my experience with EEG biofeedback and ADD, many people are able to improvetheir reading skills and decrease their need for medication. Also, EEGbiofeedback has helped to decrease impulsiv-ity and aggressiveness. It is apowerful tool, in part because the patient becomes part of the treatment processby taking more control over his own physiological processes.The use of brain-wave biofeedback is considered controversial by some cliniciansand researchers. More research needs to be done and published in order todemonstrate its effectiveness. Also, in some circles, EEG biofeedback has beenoversold. Some clinics have advertised the ability to cure ADD with biofeedback,without the use of medication. Unfortunately, overselling this treatmenttechnique has hurt its credibility. Still, in my clinical experience, I find EEGbiofeedback to be a powerful and exciting treatment with a developing future.PFC PRESCRIPTION 7: TRY AUDIOVISUAL STIMULATIONA treatment similar to EEG biofeedback is called audiovisual stimulation. Thistechnique was developed by psychologists Harold Rus-sell, Ph.D., and John Carter, Ph.D., at the University of Texas in Galveston.Both Dr. Russell and Dr. Carter were involved in the development of treatment ofADD children with EEG biofeedback. They wanted to develop a treatment techniquethat could become widely available to children who needed it.Based on a concept termed entrainment, in which brain waves tend to pick up therhythm in the environment, they developed special glasses and headphones thatflash lights and sounds at a person at specific frequencies to help the brain\"tune in\" and become more focused. Patients wear these glasses for twenty tothirty minutes a day.I have tried this treatment on a number of patients with some encouragingresults. One patient who developed tics on both Ritalin and Dexedrine tried theglasses for a month. His ADD symptoms significantly improved. When he went offthe audiovisual stimulator, his symptoms returned. The symptoms again subsidedwhen he retried the treatment.I believe that audiovisual stimulation techniques show promise for the future,but more research is needed.PFC PRESCRIPTION 8: DON'T BE ANOTHER PERSON'S STIMULANTAs mentioned, many people with prefrontal cortex problems tend to beconflict-seeking to stimulate their brain. It is critical for you to not feedthe turmoil, but rather to starve it. The more someone with this patternunknowingly tries to upset or anger you, the more you need to be quiet, calm,and steady. I teach parents of ADD children to stop yelling. The more they yelland increase the emotional intensity in the family, the more the children seekturmoil. I also teach siblings and spouses to maintain a low voice and a calmdemeanor. The harder the person with ADD tries to escalate the situation, theless intense the respondent should be.It is fascinating how this prescription works. In general, the conflict-seekingpeople are used to being able to get you upset. They have mastered all youremotional buttons, and they push them with regularity. When you begin to denythem the drama and adrenaline rush (by being less reactive and calmer instressful situations), they initially react very negatively, almost as if theyare going through a drug withdrawal. In fact, when you first become calmer theymay even get worse in the short term. Stick with it, and they'll improve in thelong term.Here are some strategies for dealing with a person who has a tendency towardconflict-seeking behavior:• Don t yell.• The more their voice goes up, the more your voice should go down.• If you feel the situation starting to get out of control, ta\\e a brea\\. Sayingyou have to go to the bathroom may be a good prescription. Lively, the personwont try to stop you. It may be a good idea to have a thic\\ boo\\ ready if he orshe is really upset and you need to stay away for a long time.• Use humor (but not sarcasm or angry humor) to defuse the situation.• Be a good listener.• Say you want to understand and wor\\ on the situation, but you can do this onlywhen things are calm.PFC PRESCRIPTION 9: CONSIDER PREFRONTAL CORTEX MEDICATIONMedications that aid prefrontal cortex performance need to be specificallytailored to the problem. Those people who have ADD often respond very well tostimulant medications, such as Ritalin (methylphenidate), Adderall (acombination of four amphetamine salts), Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine), Desoxyn(methampheta-mine), or Cylert (pemoline). These medications work by stimulatingthe neurotransmitter dopamine, which in turn helps to prevent the prefrontalcortex shutdown that happens in ADD. Contrary to popular belief, thesemedications are very safe and well tolerated, and they make a difference almostimmediately.I have seen these medications change people's lives. I did SPECT studies of oneten-year-old boy with ADD on and off his medication. With 10 milligrams ofRitalin three times a day, he clearly has more access to the activity in theprefrontal cortex, so he's better able to focus, set goals, organize, plan, andcontrol his impulses.For a year, I kept a log of what my ADD adult patients told me about theeffectiveness of their medication. The following are some of their comments.\"I experienced an increased awareness of the world around me. I saw the hillsfor the first time when driving to wor\\. I saw the bay when I crossed over thebridge. I actually noticed the color of the skyl\"\"I experienced a 180-degree difference in my attitude.\"\"I loo\\ at my children and say, ( Aren't they cute?' rather than complainingabout them.\"Becoming Focused Before and After Stimulant MedicationM7picture49 [images/picture49.jpg]picture50 [images/picture50.jpg]3-D underside surface viewADD, concentration, no medication; note markedly decreased prefrontal andtemporal lobe activity.ADD, concentration, with Ritalin 15 mg; note marked overall improvement.\"I could sit and watch a movie for the first time in my life.\"\"I am able to handle situations where I used to be hysterical.

When they gain access to their prefrontalcortex, it is often amazing at how much more effective they can be.Several \"stimulating\" antidepressants are also helpful in ADD. Norpramin(desipramine) and Tofranil (imipramine) increase the neurotransmitternorepinephrine and are especially helpful for people with ADD and anxiety ordepressive symptoms. Wellbutrin (bupropion) increases the neurotransmitterdopamine and is often helpful for people with ADD and depression or low energy.Effexor (venlafaxine) increases the neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine,and, in higher doses, dopamine, and is most helpful for people with ADD whooverfocus or are obsessive.PFC PRESCRIPTION 10: WATCH YOUR PREFRONTAL CORTEX NUTRITIONNutritional intervention can be especially helpful in this part of the brain.For years I have recommended a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet that isrelatively low in fat to my patients with ADD. This diet has a stabilizingeffect on blood sugar levels and helps both with energy level and concentration.Unfortunately, the great American diet is filled with refined carbohydrates,which have a negative impact on dopamine levels in the brain and concentration.With both parents working outside the home, there is less time to preparehealthy meals, and fast-food meals have become more the norm. The breakfast oftoday typically consists of foods that are high in simple carbohydrates, such asfrozen waffles or pancakes, Pop Tarts, muffins, pastry, cereal. Sausage and eggshave gone by the wayside in many homes because of the lack of time and theperception that fat is bad for us. Even though it is important to be carefulwith fat intake, the breakfast of old is not such a bad idea for people with ADDor other dopamine-deficient states.The major sources of protein I recommend include lean meats, eggs, low-fatcheeses, nuts, and legumes. These are best mixed with a healthy portion ofvegetables. An ideal breakfast is an omelet withlow-fat cheese and lean meat, such as chicken. An ideal lunch is a tuna,chicken, or fresh fish salad, with mixed vegetables. An ideal dinner containsmore carbohydrates for balance with lean meat and vegetables. Eliminating simplesugars (such as cakes, candy, ice cream, pastries) and simple carbohydrates thatare readily broken down to sugar (such as bread, pasta, rice, potatoes) willhave a positive impact on energy level and cognition. This diet is helpful inraising dopamine levels in the brain. It is important to note, however, thatthis diet is not ideal for people with cingulate or overfocus issues, whichusually stem from a relative deficiency of serotonin. Serotonin and dopaminelevels tend to counterbalance each other; whenever serotonin is raised, dopaminetends to be lowered and vice versa.Nutritional supplements can also have a positive effect on brain dopamine levelsand help with focus and energy. I often have my patients take a combination oftyrosine (500-1,500 milligrams two to three times a day); OPC (oligomericprocyanidius) grape seed or pine bark; found in health food stores (1 milligramper pound of body weight); and gingko biloba (60-120 milligrams twice a day).These supplements help increase dopamine and blood flow in the brain, and manyof my patients report that they help with energy, focus, and impulse control. Ifyou want to try these supplements, check with your doctor.PFC PRESCRIPTION 11: TRY MOZART FOR FOCUSOne controlled study found that listening to Mozart was helpful for childrenwith ADD. Rosalie Rebollo Pratt and colleagues studied nineteen children, agesseven to seventeen, with ADD. They played recordings of Mozart for them threetimes a week during brainwave biofeedback sessions. They used 100 Masterpieces,vol. 3, which included Piano Concerto no. 21 in C, The Marriage of Figaro, FluteConcerto no. 2 in D, Don Giovanni, and other concertos and sonatas. The groupthat listened to Mozart reduced their theta brain-wave activity (slow brainwaves that are often excessive in ADD) in exact rhythm to the underlying beat ofthe music, and displayed better focus and mood control, diminished impulsivity,and improved social skill. Among the subjects who improved, 70 percentmaintained that improvement six months after the end of the study withoutfurther training.

It's the part of the brain that allows you to shift yourattention from one thing to another, to move from idea to idea, to see theoptions in life. Feelings of safety and security have also been attributed tothis part of the brain. In my experience, the term that best relates to thispart of the brain is cognitive flexibility.Cognitive flexibility defines a person's ability to go with the flow, adapt tochange, deal successfully with new problems. Many situations in life demandcognitive flexibility. For example, when you start a new job, you need to learna new system of doing things. Even if you did something another way at aprevious job, learning how to shift to please a new boss or adapt to a newsystem is critical to job success. Junior high school students need cognitiveflexibility inLooking Into Worry and Obsessiveness The Cingulate Gyrusl 5 lpicture51 [images/picture51.jpg]cingulate gyruspicture52 [images/picture52.jpg]3-D side active viewpicture53 [images/picture53.jpg]3-D top-down active view3-D front-on active vieworder to be successful in school. In seventh grade, many students begin havingvarious teachers throughout the day. It is necessary to shift learning styles inorder to adapt to the different styles of the teachers. Flexibility is alsoimportant in friendships. What works in a friendship with one person may not beat all effective with someone else.Effectively managing change and transitions is an essential ingredient inpersonal, interpersonal, and professional growth. The cingulate system can be ofgreat help or hindrance to this process. When it is working properly, we aremore able to roll with the circumstances of the day. When it is impaired oroveractive, cognitive flexibility is diminished.Along with shifting attention, we have seen that cooperation is also influencedby this part of the brain. When the cingulate works effectively, it's easy toshift into cooperative modes of behavior. Peo-pie with cingulate problems have difficulty shifting attention and get stuck inineffective behavior patterns.The cingulate system has also been implicated (along with the other aspects ofthe pfc) in \"future-oriented thinking,\" such as planning and goal setting. Whenthis part of the brain works well, it is easier to plan and set reasonablegoals. On the negative side, difficulties in this part of the brain can cause aperson to perceive fearful situations where there are none, predict negativeevents, and feel very unsafe in the world.Seeing options is crucial to adaptable behavior. In my profession, adaptablephysicians readily utilize new ideas and technology (after a scientific basis isdeveloped), and they are open to give their patients the latest information onwhat is new and exciting. Physicians who have cingulate problems (I have scannedmany) tend to be rigid, do things the way they have always been done, and beautocratic (\"Do it my way if you want me to treat you\"). Being able to seeoptions and new ideas protects against stagnation, depression, and hostilebehavior.PROBLEMS WITH THE CINGULATE SYSTEM• worrying• holding on to hurts from the past• getting stuc\\ on thoughts {obsessions)• getting stuc\\ on behaviors {compulsions)• oppositional behavior• argumentativeness• uncooperativeness; tendency to say no automatically• addictive behaviors {alcohol or drug abuse, eating disorders)• chronic pain• cognitive inflexibility• obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)• OCD spectrum disorders• eating disorders• road rageWhen the cingulate system is abnormal, people have a tendency to get stuck onthings, locked into things, to rethink the same thought over and over and over.They may become worriers and continually obsess on the same thought. They mayhold on to hurts or grudges from the past, unable to let them go. They may alsoget stuck on neg-ative behaviors or develop compulsions such as hand washing or excessivelychecking locks.One patient who had difficulties in this part of the brain described thisphenomenon as \"like being on a rat's exercise wheel, where the thoughts just goover and over and over.\" Another patient told me, \"It's like having a resetbutton that is always on. Even though I don't want to have the thought anymore,it just keeps coming back.\"The clinical problems associated with the cingulate will be discussed shortly.There are also a number of what I call \"subclinical patterns\" associated withabnormalities in this part of the brain. Subclinical problems are those thatdon't reach the intensity or cause the dysfunction of a full-fledged disorder,but can nonetheless erode our quality of life. Worrying, holding on to hurtsfrom the past, cognitive inflexibility, and rigidity may not send you to thetherapist, but they can make your life unnecessarily gloomy.WORRYINGEven though we all worry at times (and some worry is necessary to keep usworking or studying in school), people who have an overactive cingulate may haveintegrated chronic worrying into their personality. They may worry to the pointof causing emotional and physical harm to themselves. Whenever repetitivenegative concerns circle through the mind, it can cause tension, stress,stomachaches, headaches, and irritability. Chronically expressing worries oftenirritates others and makes a person seem less powerful and perhaps even lessmature.At a dinner party, an old friend of mine who is also a physician complained thathis wife worried \"all the time.\" \"She worries for the whole family,\" he told me.\"It upsets me and the children. Her constant worry seems to be associated withher chronic headaches and irritability. How do I help her relax so that shewon't get so upset about the little things in life?\" he queried. I had known myfriend's wife for many years. Even though she had never been clinicallydepressed and wouldn't fit the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder or OCD(obsessive-compulsive disorder), I knew that it was in her personality to worry.Members of her family, which she had discussed with me on several occasions, didhave clinical problems (such as alcoholism, drug abuse, and compulsivebehaviors) associated with the cingulate system.HOLDING ON TO HURTSHolding tightly on to hurts from the past can cause serious problems in aperson's life. I once treated a woman who was very angry with her husband. On atrip to Hawaii, her husband had allowed his eyes to wander toward some of thescantily dressed women on the beach at Waikiki. The wife had become irate. Shefelt he had been unfaithful to her with his eyes. Her anger had ruined the wholetrip, and she continued to bring up the incident years later.Another cingulate example occurred in a newly blended family. Don married Laura,who had a three-year-old son, Aaron. Laura and Aaron had been living with herparents. Shortly after the wedding Don, Laura, and Aaron went to visit Laura'sparents. During the visit Aaron asked for a second bowl of ice cream. Don toldhim no because it might ruin his dinner. Laura's parents undermined Don's newauthority in front of the little boy by saying he could have the second helpingof ice cream. Frustrated, Don tried to discuss the issue. The grandparents toldhim he was being silly. What did he know, they thought, he was new tofatherhood. When Don tried further to talk to them, they just dismissed him. Thegrandparents, unable to let go of the incident, refused to even speak to Don orLaura for the next eighteen months. Many family cutoffs are due to excessivecingulate activity.COGNITIVE INFLEXIBILITYCognitive inflexibility, the inability to roll with the ups and downs ofeveryday life, is at the root of most cingulate problems. A friend'ssix-year-old daughter, Kimmy, provides a perfect example of cognitiveinflexibility. Her older sister was instructed by her mother to get Kimmy readyto go out for the day. The older sister picked out a shirt and pair of pants forKimmy. Kimmy complained that the shirt and pants looked stupid. She had the samecomplaint for the next three outfits that her sister chose for her. Kimmy wantedto wear a sundress (it was February and cold outside). She cried and cried toget her way. Nothing else would do. Once she got the idea of the sundress in herhead, she couldn't shift away from it.In couples counseling through the years, I have frequently heard another exampleof cognitive inflexibility: the need to do something now. Not five minutes fromnow, but now\\ Here's a fairly common scenario: A wife asks her husband to getsome clothes out of thedryer and put the clothes from the washer into the dryer. He asks her to wait afew minutes because he's watching the end of a basketball game. She becomesirate and says that it needs to be done now. They get into a fight. She doesn'tfeel comfortable until the chore is finished. He feels intruded upon, pushedaround, and generally degraded. The need to do it now can cause some seriousrelational problems. Of course, if the husband said he would help, then didn't,we could understand her need to have it done now.There are many more everyday examples of trouble shifting attention or cognitiveinflexibility. Here's a short list:• Only eating specific foods, being unwilling to try new tastes• Having to keep a room a certain way• Having to maJ^e love the same way every time (or avoiding love-making becauseof feeling uncomfortable about the messiness that is involved with it)• Becoming upset if the plans for the evening change at the last minute• Having to do things a certain way at wor\\, even if it's not in the business sbest interest (e.g., not being flexible enough to meet an important customersneeds)• Maying other family members do chores such as the dishes in a certain way(this often alienates others and they become less willing to help)Cognitive inflexibility can insidiously destroy happiness, joy, and intimacy.THE AUTOMATIC NOBecause they have problems shifting attention, many people with cingulateoveractivity become stuck on the word no. No seems to be the first word theysay, without ever really thinking about whether or not no is even in their bestinterest. One of my patients told me about his father. Whenever my patient wouldask his father for something, such as permission to borrow the car, the fatherwould automatically say no. The children in the family all knew that if theywanted something from their father, he would first say no to them, and then aweek or two later he would think about the request and sometimes change hismind. \"No\" was always his first response.I have had several employees who clearly had cingulate problems. Frequently theywould be uncooperative and find ways not to do what was asked of them. Theyseemed to frequently argue with re-quests and tell me why things couldn't be done, rather than constructively tryto solve problems.When partners have cingulate problems, they often get the opposite of what theywant. One man told me that whenever he wanted to make love with his wife, he hadto act as if he really didn't want to make love. He said, \"If I would ask herdirectly, she would say no ninety-nine out of one hundred times. If I would lockour bedroom door at night [a sign that he wanted to be intimate with her], shewould automatically become tense and say she wasn't interested. If I acteduninterested, just rubbed her back for a long time, then maybe I would have achance. The amount of work and planning it took to make it happen often wasn'tworth the effort.\" The \"automatic no\" puts a great strain on many differenttypes of relationships.ROAD RAGESomething happens to many people when they get behind the wheel of a car; aterritorial animal comes growling to the surface. Cingulate people tend to bethe worst. The problem again is trouble shifting attention. For example, if youare driving on a highway and someone accidentally cuts you off, most peoplewould think to themselves, \"You bastard,\" and then leave the situation alone.People with cingulate problems say to themselves, \"You bastard, you bastard, youbastard, you bastard . . .\" and they cannot get the thought out of theirRoad-Rage-Affected Brainpicture54 [images/picture54.jpg]3-D side active view Notice markedly increased cingulate activity (arrow).head. I have known many cingulate people who have acted out their frustrationsby doing crazy things on the road, such as swearing, gesturing, chasing, orharassing the other driver. I have one patient, a very bright, successfulprofessional, who on several occasions chased other drivers who had cut him offand on two occasions got out of the car and bashed their windows in with abaseball bat he kept in the car. After the second incident, he came to see me.He said, \"If I don't get help for this, I'm sure I'll end up in jail.\" Hiscingulate gyrus was markedly overactive, causing him to get locked into thenegative thoughts and subsequently be less able to control his frustration.OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDERGailOn the outside, Gail was normal. She went to work every day, she was married toher high school sweetheart, and she had two small children. On the inside, shefelt like a mess. Her husband was ready to leave her, and her children wereoften withdrawn and upset. She was distant from her family and locked into theprivate hell of obsessive-compulsive disorder. She cleaned her house for hoursevery night after work. She screamed at her husband and children when anythingwas out of place. She would become especially hysterical if she saw a piece ofhair on the floor, and she was often at the sink washing herGail's OCD-Affected Brainpicture55 [images/picture55.jpg]3-D front-on active view Note heavily increased cingulate activity (arrow).hands. She also made her husband and children wash their hands more than tentimes a day. She stopped making love to her husband because she couldn't standthe feeling of being messy.On the verge of divorce, Gail and her husband came to see me. At first, herhusband was very skeptical about the biological nature of her illness. Gail'sbrain SPECT study showed marked increased activity in the cingulate system,demonstrating that she really did have trouble shifting her attention.With this information, I placed Gail on Zoloft. Within six weeks, she hadsignificantly relaxed, her ritualistic behavior had diminished, and she stoppedmaking her kids wash their hands every time they turned around. Her husbandcouldn't believe the change. Gail was more like the woman he had married.Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects somewhere between two and fourmillion people in the United States. This disorder, almost without exception,dramatically impairs a person's functioning and often affects the whole family.OCD is often unnoticed by people in the outside world, but not by those who livewith the obsessive-compulsive person.The hallmarks of this disorder are obsessions (recurrent disgusting orfrightening thoughts) or compulsions (behaviors that a person knows make nosense but feels compelled to do anyway). The obsessive thoughts are usuallysenseless and repugnant. They may involve repetitive thoughts of violence (suchas killing one's child), contamination (such as becoming infected by shakinghands), or doubt (such as having hurt someone in a traffic accident, even thoughno such accident occurred). The more a person tries to control them, the morepowerful they become.The most common compulsions involve hand washing, counting, checking, andtouching. These behaviors are often performed according to certain rules in avery strict or rigid manner. For example, a person with a counting compulsionmay feel the need to count every crack on the pavement on the way to work orschool. What would be a five-minute walk for most people could turn into athree-or four-hour trip for a person with obsessive-compulsive disorder. A partof the individual generally recognizes the senselessness of the behavior anddoesn't get pleasure from carrying it out, although doing it often provides arelease of tension.The intensity of OCD varies widely. Some people have mild ver-sions, where, for example, they have to make the house perfect before they go onvacation or they spend the vacation worrying about the condition of the house.The more serious forms can cause a person to be housebound for years. I oncetreated an eighty-three-year-old woman who had obsessive sexual thoughts thatmade her feel dirty inside. It got to the point where she would lock all herdoors, draw the shades, turn off the lights, take the phone off the hook, andsit in the middle of a dark room, trying to stop the abhorrent sexual thoughtsas they came into her mind. Her life became paralyzed by this behavior, and sheneeded to be hospitalized.Exciting research in the past few years has shown a biological patternassociated with OCD. Brain SPECT studies have shown increased blood flow in thecingulate system, along with increased activity in the basal ganglia (often theanxiety component of the problem).Like most forms of psychiatric illness, part of effective treatment for OCDoften involves medication. At this writing, there are eight \"antiobsessivemedications\" and more on the way. The current medications that have showneffectiveness with OCD are Anafranil (clomipramine), Prozac (fluoxetine), Zoloft(sertraline), Paxil (paroxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Serzone (nefazodone),Remeron (mir-tazapine), and Luvox (fluvoxamine). These medications have providedmany patients with profound relief from OCD symptoms.In addition, behavior therapy is often helpful. The patient is gradually exposedto the situations most likely to bring out the rituals and habits. The therapistteaches the patient thought-stopping techniques and strongly encourages him orher to face his or her worst fear (for example, by persuading a patient with afear of dirt or contamination to play in the mud).OCD SPECTRUM DISORDERSThere is a group of disorders that have been recently labeledobsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders. People with these disorders get stuckon unwanted, repetitive thoughts and cannot get them out of their minds unlessthey act in a specific manner. According to psychiatrist Ronald Pies, postulatedOCD spectrum disorders include: trichotillomania (pulling out one's own hair),onychophagia (nail biting), Tourette's syndrome (involuntary motor and vocaltics), kleptomania, body dysmorphic disorder (feeling that a part of the bodyis excessively ugly), hypochondria, autism, compulsive shopping, pathologicalgambling, chronic pain, addictive disorders, and eating disorders. I would alsoadd oppositional defiant disorder.A sample of repetitive thoughts that significantly interfere with behavior mightinclude:• Chronic pain: \"I hurt! I hurt! I hurt!\"• Eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia: \"I'm too fat! I'm too fat! Ymtoo fat!\" despite rational evidence to the contrary.• Addictive disorders: \"I need a drink! I need a drink!\"• Pathological gambling: \"Next time I'll win! Next time I'll win! Next time I'llwin!\"• Compulsive shopping: \"I need to buy this one thing! I need to buy this onething! I need to buy this one thing!\"• Oppositional defiant disorder: \"No I won't! No I won't! You can't make me!\"In 1991, Susan Swedo, M.D., at the National Institutes of Mental Health inBethesda, Maryland, hypothesized that patients with trichotillomania wouldexhibit the same brain imaging as those with OCD. At rest, these patientsexhibited a different brain pattern. Yet when these patients were treated withthe antiobsessive antidepressant Anafranil, there was decreased activity in thecingulate aspect of the frontal lobes, which has also been found with successfultreatment of OCD with antiobsessive antidepressants.Here are several case examples from my own practice to illustrate OCD spectrumdisorders.CHRONIC PAINStewartStewart, a forty-year-old roofer, had hurt his back ten years earlier when hefell off a roof. He had undergone six back operations but remained in constantpain. He was essentially bedridden and about to lose his family because all hecould think about was the pain. The threat of losing his family catalyzed him toget a psychiatric evaluation. His SPECT revealed marked overactivity in thecingulate system. He was placed on 200 milligrams of Anafranil per day. Afterfive weeks, he reported that his back still hurt, but he was much less focusedon the pain. He was able to get out of bed and start back to school. Otherresearchers have also reported several cases of intractable pain that wereresponsive to treatment with antiobsessive medications.EATING DISORDERSLeslieTwenty-year-old Leslie suffered from bulimia for three years. She got to thepoint where she was using laxatives several times a day in increasing doses,along with exercising for two to three hours a day. Her binges were alsobecoming more frequent. When she sought treatment, she felt totally out ofcontrol. During her initial evaluation, she said she knew her behavior wasabnormal and she hated it. However, when she got the urge to eat, she felt shehad to give in to it, and afterward she could not get the thoughts of beingoverweight out of her head. She had a maternal aunt who had been diagnosed withobsessive-compulsive disorder. Leslie's brain SPECT study revealed increasedactivity in the cingulate system along with increased activity in her rightbasal ganglia. With this information, she was placed in an eating disordersgroup and given Prozac (an antiobses-sive antidepressant). Over the next threemonths, she improved markedly, to the point where she was eating normally, nottaking any laxatives at all, and exercising less than an hour a day.In 1992, the Prozac Bulimia Nervosa Collaborative Study Group reported thatdaily therapy with 60 milligrams of Prozac significantly decreased the frequencyof binge eating and self-induced vomiting. In the medical literature Prozac hasbeen reported to decrease activity in the cingulate in obsessive-compulsivepatients.DRUG OR ALCOHOL ADDICTIONJoshuaJoshua began using drugs and alcohol at the age of twelve. When his parentsfinally caught on to his drug abuse at the age of sixteen, Joshua reported thathe had used LSD more than a hundred times and he was drinking a pint of whiskeya day. He said that he was unable to stop, even though he had wanted to manytimes. When his parents brought him in for evaluation, it was revealed thatthere was a strong history of drug and alcohol abuse on both sides of hisfamily, even though neither of his parents drank alcohol or abused drugs. Afterhis SPECT study revealed significant overactivity in the cingulate system,Joshua was placed on Zoloft in addition to his individual and support grouptherapy. He reported that he still had periodic cravings for the substances, butthat he could avoid themmore easily with the behavioral techniques he learned. He was able to get thethoughts about drugs and alcohol out of his head.PATHOLOGICAL GAMBLINGMany people enjoy gambling. They feel happy when they win, discouraged when theylose. And they realize that gambling is a game of chance, like many things inlife. Some people, however, become addicted to gambling and it can ruin everyaspect of their lives. Pathological gambling is defined by the AmericanPsychiatric Association as persistent and recurrent maladaptive gamblingbehavior that disrupts personal, family, or vocational pursuits. Pathologicalgambling usually starts with an important \"big win.\" The high from the win gets\"stuck\" in a gambler's head, and he or she begins to chase it, even to the pointof self-destruction.AdamAdam came to our office out of desperation. His wife had just left him, and hehad seen an attorney to discuss filing for bankruptcy. His gambling had gottenout of control. He was a successful entrepreneur who had worked hard at startinghis own business, but in the few years before he came to see me he had begunneglecting his business to spend more of his time at the racetrack and driveback and forth to Reno and Lake Tahoe. In our first session he told me, \"I feelcompelled to gamble. I know it is ruining my life, but it seems I have to placea bet or the tension just builds and builds. Before I started losing everything,I knew I could win. It was all I thought about!\" Adam came come from analcoholic home; both his father and paternal grandfather were alcoholics. Eventhough Adam himself had never had a problem with alcohol, he clearly had anaddiction. Explaining the cingulate system to Adam was helpful. He couldidentify many people in his family who had problems shifting attention. \"Youshould see our family gatherings,\" he told me. \"Someone is always mad at someoneelse. People in my family can hold grudges for years and years.\" In addition togoing to Gamblers Anonymous and psychotherapy, Adam took a small daily dose ofProzac to help him shift away from the obsessive thoughts about gambling.Eventually he was able to reconnect with his wife and rebuild his business.COMPULSIVE SPENDINGCompulsive shopping is another manifestation of problems in the cingulatesystem. Compulsive shoppers get high from the pursuit and purchase of goods.They spend inordinate amounts of time thinking about shopping activities. Thisaddiction can ruin their financial status and their relationships and have anegative impact on their work.miJill worked as the office manager for a big law firm in San Francisco. Beforework, during her lunch hours, and after work she found herself drawn to thestores at Union Square, near her office. She felt a rush of internal excitementas she picked out clothes for herself and her family members. She also enjoyedbuying presents for others, even if they were just acquaintances. It was the actof shopping that was important. Even though she knew she shouldn't be spendingthe money, it felt too good to stop. She and her husband had many fights overthe money she spent during her shopping sprees. She began embezzling money fromwork. She took care of the company checkbook and began to write and cash checksto fictitious vendors in order to cover her personal debt. When a business auditalmost found her out, she stopped. But her addiction didn't. Her husband finallydivorced her when he uncovered credit card debt in the amount of thirty thousanddollars. Ashamed, scared, and depressed, Jill entered treatment. All her lifeshe had been a worrier. In her teens she had had an eating disorder, and she hada cousin who had obsessive-compulsive disorder. Her SPECT study revealed amarkedly overactive cingulate system. When she got locked into a train ofthought or behavior (spending) she had real problems shifting away from it.Zoloft (an antiobsessive antidepressant) was helpful for her as part of thehealing process.OPPOSITIONAL DEFIANT DISORDEROppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is considered a behavioral disorder ofchildren and teenagers who are negativistic, hostile, defiant, and contrary.They tend to be argumentative, are easily annoyed, and lose their temper often,especially when they do not get their way. These children are chronicallyuncooperative. They tend to say noeven when saying yes is clearly in their own best interest. The question I askparents to help me diagnose this disorder is \"How many times out of ten when youask this child to do something will he (or she) do it the first time withoutarguing or fighting?\" Most children will comply seven to eight times out of tenwithout a problem. For most ODD children the answer is usually three or fewer;for many of them it is zero.DavidI first met David when he was seven years old. He came into my office with hismother. He was wearing typically dirty shoes, and the minute he sat down, he puthis feet up on my navy-blue leather couch. His mother, embarrassed by hisrudeness, took his feet off the couch. He put them back on the couch. She tookthem off. He put them back on again. Looking angry, she took them off again.Right away, he put them back on and she took them off. I was watching thecingulate of the mother/son pair in action. David had to have his feet on thecouch, mostly because his mother didn't want them on the couch (he also probablywanted to see what would happen if he irritated me). His mother couldn't standthe fact that he wouldn't listen to her, and she had to have his feet off thecouch. Seeing the mother/son cingulate in action, I knew that many of theirproblems probably stemmed from an inability to shift attention and to hold theirown positions. To confirm my suspicions about David, I said ten innocuousthings, such as \"The weather is good today . . . Don't you think California isnice? [he was from out of state]... I like your outfit\" and so on. David arguedwith eight of the ten things I said. \"The weather is awful... I hate California... My mother made me wear this stupid outfit. . .\" With an incredulous look onher face, David's mother argued with him: \"This is beautiful weather . . .Yesterday you said you wanted to live in California . . . This is your favoriteoutfit...\" Further conversation with his mother suggested we had a generationalcingulate problem.When I first suggested a connection between cingulate overactivity andoppositional defiant disorder, many of my colleagues did not take me seriously.How could ODD, which is an externalizing behavior disorder, be related to OCD,an internal anxiety disorder? After seeing this pattern over years it makesperfect sense to me. These children cannot shift their attention. They get stuckon No, Noway, Never, You cant make me do it. They often have \"cingulate parents,\" andmany of them have a family history of OCD and other cingulate problems.One of the most interesting findings among the patients we studied was thatmothers or fathers who had obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, orinflexible personality styles tended to have children with ODD. We studiedeleven cases that exhibited this parent-child pattern and obtained brain SPECTstudies on both the parent and the child. In nine out of the eleven, both theparent's and the child's brain SPECT study revealed increased cingulateactivity. Both a biological explanation for this finding and behavioral etiologycan be entertained. One can postulate that the finding of increased cingulateactivity (biological component) can cause parents to have problems shiftingattention and become stuck on thoughts or behaviors and cause them to beinflexible, while the child's inability to shift attention causes his behaviorto appear oppositional. It is also possible that the parent's rigid style causesthe child to react in an oppositional way (the behavioral part) as a way to gainindependence and autonomy, which induces the subsequent SPECT finding.As mentioned above, it has been observed that the brain SPECT abnormalities inthe cingulate normalize with effective treatment. This does not appear to bemerely variability from test to test, as researchers have shown that withoutintervening in some way, the brain SPECT patterns change very little. In thefollowing case of ODD, follow-up data were obtained.JeremyJeremy, age nine, was evaluated for significant oppositional behavior. He hadbeen suspended from school five times in second grade for refusing to do what hewas told and being openly defiant with his teacher. His parents were told not tobring him back to school until they sought professional help. His clinicalevaluation was consistent with a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. Hisbrain SPECT study revealed marked increased cingulate activity. When he improvedonly minimally with behavioral interventions, he was placed on Anafranil. Withintwo weeks, he showed marked clinical improvement. After two months, his brainSPECT study was repeated and revealed essentially normal cingulate activity. Thefollowing year, Jeremy did well in school; in fact, his teacher that year couldnot understand why his former teachers had warned her about him.STRESS OFTEN INCREASES ACTIVITY IN THE CINGULATE SYSTEMIn many children and teenagers with ODD, I obtain both rest and concentrationSPECT studies. Interestingly, in about half of the cases, I see a furtherincrease in cingulate activity when these patients try to concentrate.Clinically, I find that this correlates with those oppositional children andteens who get worse (\"more stuck\") under pressure or when they are pushed tocomply with certain requests. I have seen this occur frequently on an adolescenttreatment unit. Some of these teens would become so \"stuck\" that they refused tocomply with the staff requests and ended up on restriction or even, in somecases, in restraints because they could not shift their attention in order tobehave more appropriately. It can be particularly bad if a cingulate teen meetsup with a cingulate nurse who cannot back off a little to let the situationdefuse.Ken and KatieKen's family illustrates the problems an overactive cingulate can cause. Hiswife and two daughters came to his office to pick him up and go out to dinner.His youngest daughter, Katie, smiled when she saw him and gave him a big hug. Asthey were going to drive in two separate cars, Ken said to her, \"Come on, Katie,ride with me in my car.\" Katie had been diagnosed with attention deficitdisorder, and she was often oppositional with Ken. He wanted to spend some extratime with her on the way to the restaurant. As soon as he said, \"Come with me,\"she said, \"No. I don't want to.\" Ken's feelings were a little hurt. He replied,\"Come on, Katie, I want to be with you.\" She said, \"Nol I'm going with Mommy.\"Not one to give up easily, Ken physically picked her up and put her in the car.She yelled, screamed, and cried halfway to the restaurant (real quality time).All of a sudden she stopped crying, dried her eyes, and said, \"I'm sorry, Daddy.I really wanted to go with you.\" When he had pushed Katie to go with him, herbrain locked. She got stuck on her first reaction and became unable to thinkabout what she actually wanted to do.Katie's SPECT study showed increased activity in the cingulate system. All ofKen's children are grandchildren of alcoholics. I have seen a significantconnection between a family history of alcoholism and increased activity in thecingulate system.Given that children and teens with ODD tend to \"lock up\" cogni-tively when theyare pushed to comply, I have found behavioral techniques, such as giving optionsand distraction, more effective in obtaining compliance. When you giveoppositional children or teens an option as to when they might do something,they tend to be less likely to get stuck on \"No, I won't do it.\" When they arestuck on a negative thought or behavior, I have found it helpful to distractthem for a bit and then come back to the issue at hand later. Ken would havebeen better at getting Katie to go with him in the car if he had given her achoice rather than just telling her she was going to go with him.THERAPY FOR A FAMILY WITH SIMILAR BRAIN SPECT FINDINGSThe following family case study demonstrates how the same brain finding canpresent itself clinically in different ways. Brain SPECT studies were obtainedon a mother and two of her children.Celina, Samuel, and LauraCelina is a thirty-six-year-old woman who had experienced depressive feelingsafter the birth of her first child ten years prior to her evaluation. Shesuffered from significant irritability, crying spells, sleeplessness, lack ofappetite and weight loss, problems concentrating, and difficulty in managing herchildren. Her condition was brought to a crisis with suicidal behavior when sheseparated from her husband. She was initially seen by another psychiatrist andstarted on an antidepressant, which had little effect. I started to see her inpsychotherapy and placed her on a different antidepressant. It had a positiveeffect, and she did well. After several months, she decided that she \"should bestronger than the depression\" and took herself off the medication. Withinseveral weeks her depression worsened, but she was resistant to restarting theantidepressant.In an effort to demonstrate to her that her depression existed on a biologicallevel as well as on a psychological level, a brain SPECT study was performed.Celina's SPECT study revealed increased activity in her limbic system(consistent with the underlying depressive disorder) and markedly increasedcingulate activity.I asked her more pointed questions to see if she had obsessivecompulsive disorder. Although she denied it at the initial evaluation, in factshe was perfectionistic at home and had repetitive negative thoughts. Shetearfully remarked, \"You mean my husband was right when he thought it wasstrange that I had to have all the shirts in the drawer buttoned a certain wayand put just so in the drawer or I would become very upset?\"Celina then reported rituals that her eight-year-old daughter, Laura, wouldperform before entering a new room, such as running a finger under her nose andlicking her lips. Laura also had a locking compulsion. Every time someone leftthe house, she would be right behind, locking the door. Imagine how irritatedher brother and sister were because they could never go out of the house to playwithout being locked out!I was also seeing Celina's ten-year-old son, Samuel, for attention deficitdisorder and oppositional defiant disorder. Samuel's ADD symptoms did notrespond to Ritalin, Dexedrine, or Cylert (stimulants used to treat ADD). Celinareported that once Samuel got a thought in his mind, he was unable to let it go.He would follow her around the house for two and a half hours asking her thesame questions she had already answered. Samuel was also one of the mostnegative, hostile children I had ever met. Even though his mother was depressed,he defied her, yelled at his sisters, and seemed to do whatever he could to makethe turmoil in the home worse.Brain SPECT studies were done on both children to see if there might be agenetic component to their problems and/or a similar response to treatment.Interestingly, both of them also showed increased cingulate activity. Neither ofthe children had limbic system findings or showed evidence of clinicaldepression.Based on the SPECT and clinical information, Celina was placed on Prozac (whichhas been shown to normalize or calm cingulate hyperactivity) to decrease herdepression and help lessen her obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviors. Shehad a dramatically positive response and reported that she was no longerbothered when things weren't \"just so.\" The scan also convinced her that hercondition was at least, in part, biological and not her fault or the result of aweak will, which encouraged her to take her medication for a longer period oftime.Additionally, Samuel was started on Prozac and had a similarly positiveresponse. His behavior became much less oppositional, and his school performancedramatically improved. He made the honorroll for the first time in his life and was placed in the gifted-and-talentedprogram the following year.Initially Laura refused to take medication, and her ritualistic behaviorscontinued. Approximately eight months later, she agreed to start Prozac, and hercompulsive behaviors diminished. The family dynamics improved significantlyafter the mother, Samuel, and Laura were treated with medication andpsychotherapy.It was clear that the family dynamics in this family operated and interacted onmany levels. The mother's depression and obsessive thinking contributed to theanxiety and behavior problems in her children, and the cerebral blood flowabnormalities in the children probably added to their difficult behavior, whichfurther stressed the mother.CINGULATE SYSTEM CHECKLISTHere is the cingulate system checklist. Please read this list of behaviors andrate yourself (or the person you are evaluating) on each behavior listed. Usethe following scale and place the appropriate number next to the item.

Tendency to predict negative outcomes"},{"pageContent":"Getting Unstuc\\:Cingulate System PrescriptionsThe cingulate system of the brain allows us to shift our attention from thing tothing, idea to idea, issue to issue. When it is dysfunctional, we have atendency to get locked into negative thoughts or behaviors; we have troubleseeing the options in situations. Healing this part of the mind involvestraining the mind to see options and new ideas.Throughout this book I have written about the use of medications in healing thebrain. I will do so in this chapter as well. It is important to remember,however, that your day-to-day thoughts and behaviors also have a powerful effecton your brain chemistry. UCLA psychiatrist Jeffrey Schwartz demonstrated,through award-winning research, a powerful mind-body lesson. He and otherresearchers at UCLA studied people who had obsessive-compulsive disorder withPET scans, reporting findings similar to those presented in this book.Interestingly, when these patients were treated with antiobsessive medication,the overactive parts of their brains slowed toward normal activity. This was arevolutionary finding: Medications help heal the dysfunctional patterns of thebrain. What was more striking, however, was that those patients who were treatedwithout medication, through the use of behavior therapy alone, also showednormalization of the abnormal activity in their171brain when the treatment was effective. Changing behavior can also change brainpatterns.CG PRESCRIPTION 1:NOTICE WHEN YOU'RE STUCK, DISTRACTYOURSELF, AND COME BACK TOTHE PROBLEM LATERThe first step to overcoming cingulate dysfunction is to notice when you'restuck and distract yourself. Becoming aware of circular or looping thoughts isessential to gaining control over them. Whenever you find your thoughts cycling(going over and over), distract yourself from them. Get up and do somethingelse. Distraction is often a very helpful technique. Here's an example.MaurieMaurie, age thirty-two, came to see me for chronic tension. He incessantlyworried about his job. Despite getting good performance reviews, he felt thathis boss didn't like him. The constant worry frequently upset him. He couldn'tget these thoughts out of his head. Over and over they went. He complained ofheadaches, tension, and irritability at home. No amount of rational discussionhelped. I gave him the task of writing down the times he was stuck on thesenegative thoughts about work. They occurred every several hours. The ANT-killingexercise (see pages 64-67) was helpful for him, but it didn't completely preventthese thoughts from circling in his head. His homework became distraction. Everytime one of these thoughts came into his mind, I told him he had to sing a song.He picked out several songs he liked and rotated through them whenever thethoughts started to bother him. This worked for him. He liked the music, and hefelt that it gave him a measure of control over his bothersome thoughts.Some of my cingulate patients find it helpful to make a list of all the thingsthey can do to distract themselves when they get harassing thoughts. Here aresome examples:• Sing a favorite song.• Listen to music that maizes you feel positive.• Take a wal\\.• Do a chore.• Play with a pet.• Do structured meditation.• Focus on a word and do not allow any other thoughts to enter your mind(imagine a broom that sweeps out all other thoughts).If you actively distract yourself from repetitive thoughts or block them, overtime they will lose their control over you.CG PRESCRIPTION 2:THINK THROUGH ANSWERS BEFOREAUTOMATICALLY SAYING NOAs mentioned, many cingulate people have an automatic tendency to say no. Fightthe tendency. Before answering questions or responding to requests in a negativeway, take a breath and think first whether or not it is best to say no. Often itis helpful to take a deep breath, hold it for three seconds, and then take fiveseconds to exhale, just to get extra time before responding. For example, ifyour spouse asks you to come to bed and make love, take a deep breath beforeresponding that you're tired, sick, too busy, or not in the mood. Use the timeduring the deep breath to ask yourself whether you really want to deny yourpartner. Is it in your best interest to say no and continue doing what you'redoing, or is it in your best interest to get close to your partner? Theautomatic no has ruined many relationships. Take enough time to ask yourself ifsaying no is really what you want to say.CG PRESCRIPTION 3:WRITE OUT OPTIONS AND SOLUTIONSWHEN YOU FEEL STUCKWhen you are stuck on a thought, it is often helpful to write it down. Writingit down helps to get it out of your head. Seeing a thought on paper makes iteasier to deal with in a rational way. When repetitive thoughts cause sleepingproblems, keep a pen and paper near your bed to write them out. After you writeout a thought that has \"gotten stuck,\" generate a list of things you can doabout it and things you can't do about it. For example, if you are worried abouta situation at work, such as whether you'll get a promotion, do the following:/. Write out the thought:\"I'm worried about whether or not I'll get the promotion at wor\\.\"2. Make a list of the things you can do about the worry: \"I can do the best jobI can at wor\\.\"\"I will continue to be reliable, hardworking, and creative\" \"I will make surethe boss knows I desire the promotion.\" \"In a confident {not bragging) way, Iwill make sure the boss knows about my contributions to the company.\"3. Make a list of the things you cannot do about the worry: \"I cannot make thedecision for the boss.\"\"I cannot want the promotion any more than I do.\"\"I cannot will the promotion to happen. Worrying will nothelp.\"\"I cannot make the promotion happen (although I do have lotsof influence on the process by my attitude and performance) \"Use this simple exercise to unlock the thoughts that keep you up nights feelingtense.CG PRESCRIPTION 4:SEEK THE COUNSEL OF OTHERSWHEN YOU FEEL STUCKWhen all of your efforts to get rid of repetitive thoughts are unsuccessful, itis often helpful to seek the counsel of others. Finding someone to discuss theworries, fears, or repetitive behaviors with can be very helpful. Often justtalking about feeling stuck will open new options. Through the years, I haveused mentors to help me through some of the problems I've had to face. Otherscan be a \"sounding board,\" helping you to see options and offering realitychecks.Several years after I started performing SPECT studies on my patients, I wasprofessionally attacked by some of the researchers in the field. I had sent aletter to several of them, asking for their help and collaboration. No response.I was very excited about the clinical usefulness of SPECT in day-to-day clinicalpractice, and I wanted to share my excitement and newfound knowledge withothers. The attack on my work caused me a lot of anxiety and sleepless nights.(Remember, I have right basal ganglia overactivity, and I have a strong tendencyto avoid conflict and confrontation.)I sought the advice of a close friend who had seen the development of my workand who had referred to me many patients who had ben-efited from this technology. When I told him about the attack on my work, hesmiled. He wondered why I had expected anything different. He said, \"People whosay things that differ from the norm used to get burned at the stake. The morecontroversial, the more of a nerve you're striking in the establishedcommunity.\" When he said \"What else would you expect?\" it suggested a new way tointerpret what had happened. I could look differently at the behavior of theseother researchers. (In fact, one of the most vocal detractors of my work himselfpublished research findings a year later confirming what I had seen clinically.)When you're stuck, allow others to help you with the unsticking process.CG PRESCRIPTION 5:MEMORIZE AND RECITE THE SERENITYPRAYER WHEN BOTHERED BYREPETITIVE THOUGHTSThe Serenity Prayer is repeated daily by millions of people around the world,especially those in twelve-step programs. It is a beautiful reminder that thereare limits to what we can do in life and we need to respect that. Many peoplefind it helpful to repeat this prayer every time they are bothered by repetitivenegative thoughts. I recommend that you memorize at least the first four linesof the prayer (change it as needed to fit your own beliefs).God, grant me the serenityto accept the things I cannot change,the courage to change the things I can,and the wisdom to know the difference.Living one day at a time,enjoying one moment at a time;accepting hardship as a pathway to peace,taking as Jesus did this sinful world as it is,not as I would have it, trusting that you will makeall things right if I surrender to your will;so that I may be reasonably happy in this lifeand supremely happy with you in the next.— Attributed to Reinhold NiebuhrCG PRESCRIPTION 6:DON'T TRY TO CONVINCE SOMEONE ELSEWHO IS STUCK; TAKE A BREAKAND COME BACK LATERIf you're locked in the middle of an argument with someone who's stuck, take abreak! Take ten minutes, take ten hours, take ten days! If you distract yourselffrom a lose-lose situation, you're often able to come back later and work itout.I learned long ago not to try to argue with people who have cingu-late systemproblems. When another person is \"stuck\" on a thought or behavior, logicalreasoning usually won't work. One of the best techniques I've found to deal withthose who get stuck is as follows: I will briefly make the point I want to make.If I can tell the other person is getting locked into his or her position, I tryto change the subject and distract him or her from the topic. Distraction allowstime for the other person's subconscious mind to process what I said withouthaving to lock in on it or fight it. Often, when we come back to the issue, theother person has a more open mind to the situation. Here's an example.Jackie came to see me about marital problems. Her husband traveled and wasunable to attend many of the sessions. In the individual sessions, I saw thatJackie frequently became locked into her position and left little room foralternative explanations of behavior. Her husband said that she would go on andon for hours and not listen to anything he said. As I realized this was herpattern, I used the brief \"attack and retreat\" model I described. When shecomplained about her husband not paying attention to her, I wondered aloud if itwasn't because he felt she didn't listen to his opinion. Immediately she said Iwas wrong. She said that she was a very good listener. I didn't argue with her,but went on to something else for a while. The next session, Jackie talked aboutlistening more to her husband. Her subconscious was able to hear what I said, aslong as I didn't activate her getting locked into opposing me.This is often a very helpful technique to use with teenagers. Many teens argueand oppose their parents as part of the natural individuation and separationprocess. I teach parents to get out of struggles with their teenagers by brieflymaking their points and moving on to other topics. For important issues, comeback to them at later times.One of the best marital suggestions I give couples, which I also mentioned inchapter 8, is \"Go to the bathroom.\" When you can seethat your partner is beginning to get into cingulate territory and is startingto go over the same point again and again, excuse yourself and say you have togo to the bathroom. Few people will argue with you when nature calls, and it isoften helpful just to take a break. If the cingulate problem in the other personseems particularly strong, take a big book with you and settle in for alengthier stay.CG PRESCRIPTION 7: TRY MAKING PARADOXICAL REQUESTSRemember \"reverse psychology\"? It works with cingulate folks. But you need to besly about it. In \"reverse psychology,\" you basically ask for the opposite ofwhat you want. When you want a kiss from a naturally oppositional two-year-old,say, \"I don't want a kiss.\" The next moment the child is begging to give you akiss. When you want someone to help you with a chore, say, \"You probablywouldn't want to help me with this chore.\" Family therapists have developedwhole paradoxical treatment prescriptions to deal with resistant couples. Thetherapists bet on the couple's resistance to suggestions. For example, if thecouple is having problems spending time together and finding time for sex, thetherapist would tell them not to spend any time together and definitely not tohave sex. Many couples find that after the paradoxical suggestions they start tospend more time together and make love more regularly and passionately than theyhave in years.Paradoxical suggestions and interventions have been used as therapeuticprescriptions by psychotherapists for many years. These interventions have goneunder many names, such as antisuggestion, negative practice, paradoxicalintention, confusion technique, declaring hopelessness, restraining change,prescribing a relapse, and therapeutic double blind. Basically, they all involvesuggesting the opposite of the desired response. A common paradoxical suggestionis given to people who have trouble sleeping: \"Stay awake as long as possiblewhen going to bed.\" In treating male patients who could not urinate in publicrest rooms because of anxiety, psychologists L. M. Ascher and R. M. Turner toldthem they should go to public rest rooms and go through the entire procedure ofurinating (stand in front of the urinal, unzip their pants, and take out theirpenis), but refrain from urinating. With repeated trials, the men were able toovercome their fear of urinating in public. It is my contention that thesetactics probably work best on cingulate clients.Whenever you want a cingulate person to do something for you, it is best to makeit look as if it is his or her idea. If you ask for many things directly, youare likely to be disappointed. Ask for the person's input. Get his or herfeedback. Here are some examples:• If you want someone to meet you for dinner, it is often best to as\\ what timeis good for him or her as opposed to telling him or her to meet you at a certaintime.• If you want a hug, it is often best to say something life \"You probablywouldn't want to give me a hug.\"• If you want him or her to go to the store with you, say something life \"Youprobably wouldn't want to go with me.\"• If you want someone to finish a report by next Thursday, say, \"You probablycant finish the report by next Thursday.\"• If you want a child to comply with a request without giving you a problem,say, \"You probably wouldn't be able to do this without getting upset, wouldyou?\"CG PRESCRIPTION 8:LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITHOPPOSITIONAL CHILDRENThere are two prescriptions I find essential in dealing with oppositionalchildren. Remember, oppositional children often become rigid or stuck innegative behavior patterns. Effectively intervening with them can make asignificant difference in their lives. The first prescription is to know when todistract their attention in order to break the loops of thoughts or behaviorsthat cause them to be oppositional. Distraction, as mentioned above, is a verypowerful technique in helping cingulate thinkers get unstuck. Distract the childaway from the pattern by changing the subject, getting him or her to dosomething physical (such as taking a walk or playing a game), or working with apredetermined distraction prescription.JoshOne prescription I use is having the parent read from a favorite book when thechild begins to get stuck or locked into a negative thought or behavior. Forexample, eight-year-old Josh got stuck on being afraid of going to school.Before school he would complain of headaches, stomachaches, and anything else hethought his motherwould accept to keep him home from school. When she caught on to his ploy, shewould try to make him go to school anyway. When that happened, the little boywould scream, cry, throw tantrums, and threaten to run away from home. As theproblem escalated, she brought Josh to see me. Not only was he anxious aboutschool, his behavior was typically oppositional. The first intervention was totell Josh in no uncertain terms that he was going to school! It was the law. Itwas good for him. And if we allowed him to stay home from school, he wouldbecome more afraid of it and would actually become \"frozen by his fears.\" Tohelp him, on mornings when he felt as if he couldn't go to school or he wasworried about school, his mom or dad would distract him from his bad thoughts.Josh was very interested in insects. He had many beloved books about insects.When Josh became upset, his parents would read to him about a new insect and tryto make it as interesting as possible. If Josh still gave his parents a problemabout going to school, then he had to spend the day sitting on his bed withoutwatching television or being able to go out to play. If he was too sick to go toschool, then he was too sick to do anything else. Before this intervention Joshhad problems eight mornings out of ten. After the first month, Josh's problemsin the morning diminished to two mornings out often. By the third month, theproblem was eliminated. Both parts of the intervention were crucial to itssuccess. His parents had to let Josh know clearly that his fearful, oppositionalbehavior would not get him anything positive. The parents would not be bullied.He was going to school, or he would have to sit on his bed all day long (nosecondary gain by being sick). Second, the parents used distraction to help Joshshift his attention away from his fears that got stuck.It is essential that parents assert their ultimate authority over cin-gulatechildren. Parents cannot allow oppositional behavior to prevail. If they do, itonly reinforces the oppositional behavior, which could ruin a child's life.Permissive parents don't teach their children to deal with authority, and thosekids have trouble socially and in school. Authoritative, firm parents tend toraise the most effective children. Just as when people who have OCD give in totheir obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors those behaviors become strongerand harder to fight, when you give in to oppositional children and allow them tooppose you and disobey their oppositional behavior only becomes worse. Theearlier you train oppositionalchildren out of this behavior, the better off everyone will be. To that end, Ihave developed a set of parenting rules that is the first step in dealing withthese children. It is important to clearly spell out the rules and make sure thechild knows you are going to back them up. Here are two of the rules that dealwith oppositional behavior:Do what Mom and Dad say the first time.No arguing with parents. These rules spell out that you have authority asparents and will not allow your child to argue with you. If you make it a rulefor children to comply the first time, then they know that is what is expectedof them. You must also quickly intervene if they do not comply the first time.Do not tell a child to do something eight times. Your chance of abusing thechild verbally or physically goes up dramatically if you repetitively tell himor her to do things and don't intervene early. For example, if you tell a childto do something and he or she refuses to do it or doesn't do it within areasonable period of time, very quickly say, \"You have a choice. You can do itnow, or you can take a time-out and then you can do it. I don't care, it's up toyou.\" If the child doesn't move quickly to do what you asked, then put him orher in time-out. Repeat as necessary. Deal with misbehavior quickly, firmly, andunemotionally. The more emotional you get, the more these kids tend tomisbehave. Consistency is essential here.The second rule, \"No arguing with parents,\" is very important for oppositionalchildren. If you allow the child to argue with you, then you are onlyreinforcing and strengthening his or her cingulate resistance. Of course, youwant to hear your child's opinion. But draw the line between stating one'sopinion and arguing. You might want to tell your child, \"As your parents, wewant to hear your opinion, but arguing means you have made your point more thantwo times.\"These parenting interventions are always more effective when you do them in thecontext of a good relationship with your child. Parents who become \"limbicallybonded\" to their children by spending time and listening to them have fewerproblems with oppositional behavior.In summary, use distraction when necessary but also be firm and authoritativewith oppositional children. Pick your battles with them, and do not fight overevery issue. Unfortunately, oppositional children often have one or twocingulate parents, which only feeds the negative family dynamics. Flexibility onthe parents' part is often very helpful.CG PRESCRIPTION 9: CONSIDER CINGULATE MEDICATIONSMedications are often very helpful in the cingulate part of the brain,especially those medications that modulate the neurotransmitter serotonin.Medications that increase serotonin in the brain are termed serotonergic. Theseinclude Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Anafranil, Effexor, Remeron, Serzone, Desyrel,and Luvox. Several research studies have shown that when these medications areeffective, they normalize activity in the cingulate system. Clinically, I haveseen these medications decrease patients' repetitive thoughts and compulsivebehaviors, calm overfocus or worry, and relax people who have a tendency to befrozen by their inability to see options. When these medications work, theyoften have a dramatic effect on thoughts and behaviors.RobRob, a forty-eight-year-old married systems analyst, came to see me because hehad problems with holding grudges, \"getting stuck\" in loops of negativethinking, obsessive thoughts, moodiness, irritability, periodic intense suicidalthoughts, and problems with anger control. \"I am the anger broker of theValley,\" he reported during the initial session. His wife also reported frequentepisodes when Rob would become upset about something, be unable to shift awayfrom the thoughts that were upsetting him, lose control, and exhibit aggressivebehavior such as breaking furniture or punching holes in the walls. Rob had achildhood history of oppositional behavior. As part of his evaluation, a brainSPECT study was done that showed markedly increased uptake in his cingulategyrus. I started him on Anafranil (clomipramine), which has been used inpatients with obsessive thinking. Over two months of treatment, his dose ofAnafranil was increased to 225 milligrams a day. Rob and his family noted apositive response. He was less irritable, markedly less aggressive, moreflexible, and happier. He reported that he was more effective in interpersonalrelationships, especially with his children.After three years of continued clinical improvement on the same dose ofAnafranil (two brief trials at lowering the dosage caused a resumption ofsymptoms) a follow-up brain SPECT study revealed a marked normalization of Rob'sbrain activity.Rob's SPECT Studiespicture56 [images/picture56.jpg]picture57 [images/picture57.jpg]3-D top-down active viewBefore treatment; note markedly in- After treatment with Anafranil; note creasedcingulate activity. normal cingulate activity.picture58 [images/picture58.jpg]3-D side active viewBefore treatment; note markedly in- After treatment with Anafranil; note creasedcingulate activity (arrow). normal cingulate activity.Medications don't work all of the time, and sometimes they have side effectsthat can be annoying and even disturbing. Yet serotonergic medications are someof the newest and most effective weapons in the arsenal against human emotionalpain and suffering. They have helped millions of people live more normal lives.In addition, Saint-John's-wort, a natural herbal treatment, in my experience canalso be very helpful in raising serotonin levels and calming the cingulate partof the brain. Saint-John's-wort has beenstudied head to head with several antidepressants and found to be just aseffective with fewer side effects. It has been used for many years in Germany,where it is prescribed seven times more often than Prozac. The usual dose ofSaint-John's-wort is 300 milligrams (containing 0.3% hypericin) three times aday. I have used Saint-John's-wort in my clinic for several years and find it avery helpful treatment. Here's an example.LindaLinda was twenty-six years old when she first came to see me. She had been rapedviolently twice, had been in a physically abusive love relationship, and hadexperienced the deaths of a great many friends while still a teenager. Hersymptoms were depression, anxiety, worrying, and drug use. Her baseline SPECTstudy showed marked overactivity in the cingulate (problems shifting attention),basal ganglia (anxiety), and limbic areas (depression and mood dyscontrol).After four psychotherapy sessions with EMDR (eye movement de-sensitization andreprocessing, a specific treatment technique for traumatic events) and one monthof Saint-John's-wort (900 milligrams a day), Linda felt significantly better.When we repeated her SPECT study, there was marked normalization of activity inall three areas.Even though Saint-John's-wort can be effective, it is not completely withoutside effects. One of my patients experienced a seriously slowed heart rate.Another patient who had gotten worse on Prozac found that Saint-John's-wort madeher worse as well. If you have significant struggles with mood or behavior, Irecommend you work closely with a psychiatrist and discuss any herbal treatmentswith him or her.CG PRESCRIPTION 10: TRY NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIONSLow serotonin levels and increased cingulate activity are often associated withworrying, moodiness, emotional rigidity, and irritability. There are two waysthat food can increase serotonin levels. Foods high in carbohydrate, such aspastas, potatoes, bread, pastries, pretzels, and popcorn, increase 1-tryptophanlevels (the natural amino acid building block for serotonin) in the blood,resulting in more 1-tryptophan being available to enter the brain, where it isconvertedLinda's SPECT Studiespicture59 [images/picture59.jpg]picture60 [images/picture60.jpg]3-D underside active viewBefore treatment; note markedly increased cingulate, basal ganglia, and limbicactivity.After treatment with Saint-John's-wort; note normal cingulate, basal ganglia,and limbic activity.picture61 [images/picture61.jpg]3-D side active viewBefore treatment; note markedly in- After treatment with Saint-Johns-wort;creased cingulate, basal ganglia, and note normal cingulate, basal ganglia,limbic activity. and limbic activity.to serotonin. The calming effect of serotonin can often be felt in thirtyminutes or less by eating these foods. Cerebral serotonin levels can also beraised by eating foods rich in tryptophan, such as chicken, turkey, salmon,beef, peanut butter, eggs, green peas, potatoes, and milk. Many peopleunknowingly trigger cognitive inflexibility or mood problems by eating dietsthat are low in 1-tryptophan. For ex-ample, the high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets that I recommend forlow-dopamine states (related to prefrontal cortex underactivity) often makecingulate problems worse. L-tryptophan is a relatively small amino acid. Whenyou eat a high-protein diet, the larger amino acids compete more successfully toget into the brain, causing lower levels of brain serotonin and more negativeemotional reactiveness.Nutritional supplementation with l-tryptophan can also be very helpful.L-tryptophan was taken off the market a number of years ago because onecontaminated batch, from one manufacturer, caused a rare muscle disease and anumber of deaths. The l-tryptophan actually had nothing to do with the deaths.L-tryptophan is a naturally occurring amino acid found in milk, meat, and eggs.Many of my patients have found it very helpful for improving sleep, decreasingaggressiveness, and improving mood control. In addition, it does not have sideeffects for most people, which is a real advantage over antidepressants.L-tryptophan was recently reapproved by the Food and Drug Administration and isnow available. I recommend l-tryptophan in doses of 1,000-3,000 milligrams takenat bedtime. There have also been some recent studies with inositol, from the Bvitamin family, which you can get from a health food store. In doses of 12-20milligrams a day it has been shown to decrease moodiness, depression, andproblems of overfocus. Check with your doctor if you want to try thesesupplements.CG PRESCRIPTION 11: EXERCISEExercise can also be very helpful in calming worries and increasing cognitiveflexibility. Exercise works by increasing brain levels of l-tryptophan. Asmentioned above, l-tryptophan is a relatively small amino acid and has troublecompeting against the larger amino acids to enter the brain. During exercise,more of the large amino acids are utilized to replenish muscle strength, whichcauses a decrease in the availability of these larger amino acids in thebloodstream. As such, l-tryptophan can compete more effectively to enter thebrain and raise brain serotonin levels. In addition, exercise increases yourenergy levels and may distract you from the bad thoughts that tend to loop. Ioften recommend exercise for oppositional children as a way to improve theirl-tryptophan levels and increase cooperation."},{"pageContent":"Looking Into Memory and Temper:The Temporal LobesNinety-four-year-old father to his sixty-eight-year-old son: \"One day you wat(eup and realize that you re not eighty-one anymore.

They are rarely discussed in psychiatric circles, and fewneurologists have been concerned with the rich contribution they make to who weare and how we experience life. Until we were able to map activity in thetemporal lobes, their function remained mysterious. Many professionals basicallythought of them as armrests for the brain. The brain-imaging work we have doneat our clinic clearly shows that the temporal lobes play an integral part inmemory, emotional stability, learning, and socialization.The most precious treasures we have in life are the images we store in thememory banks of our brains. The sum of these stored experiences is responsiblefor our sense of personal identity and our sense of connectedness to thosearound us. Our experiences are enor-The Temporal Lobepicture62 [images/picture62.jpg]picture63 [images/picture63.jpg]sideview3-D side surface viewpicture64 [images/picture64.jpg]picture65 [images/picture65.jpg]3-D underside surface view3-D side active viewmously significant in making us who we are. The temporal lobes, on either sideof the brain behind the eyes and underneath the temples, store the memories andimages and help us define our sense of ourselves.On the dominant side of the brain (the left side for most people), the temporallobes are intimately involved with understanding and processing language,intermediate- and long-term memory, complex memories, the retrieval of languageor words, emotional stability, and visual and auditory processing.Language is one of the keys to being human. It allows us to communicate withother human beings and to leave a legacy of our thoughts and actions for futuregenerations. Receptive language, being able to receive and understand speech andwritten words, requires temporal lobe stability. The ability to accurately hearyour child say, \"I love you,\" or to listen and be frightened by a scary story ishoused in this part of the brain. The dominant temporal lobe helps to processsounds and written words into meaningful information. Being able to read in anefficient manner, remember what you read, and integrate the new informationrelies heavily on the dominant temporal lobe. Problems here contribute tolanguage struggles, mis-communication, and reading disabilities.I often tell my patients that it is their memories that give them both theirgreatest joys and their greatest sorrows. Memories can make us strong andself-confident (remember the times you felt most competent), or they can bringus to our knees (remember your biggest mistakes). Memories influence everyaction and pattern of action you undertake. Essential components of memory areintegrated and stored in the temporal lobes. When this part of the brain isdamaged or dysfunctional, memory is often impaired.Memories can sabotage our chances for success and effectiveness. I once treateda couple with severe marital problems. The husband had problems with depressionand attention deficit disorder. His wife tended to be rigid and unforgiving.Ultimately her memories destroyed the relationship. Shortly after they begantherapy, the husband's problems were diagnosed and treated with medication. Hegot significant relief from his symptoms. Everyone except his wife noticed theimprovement. Because his more positive behavior was inconsistent with herexperience, she could not see his progress and remained in old patterns ofbehavior. She was stuck on blaming him. She was unwilling to get help forherself, and ultimately the mar-riage died. It was her memories, rather than the new reality, that killed it.Through our research we have also found that emotional stability is heavilyinfluenced by the dominant temporal lobe. The ability to consistently feelstable and positive, despite the ups and downs of everyday life, is importantfor the development and maintenance of consistent character and personality.Optimum activity in the temporal lobes enhances mood stability, while increasedor decreased activity in this part of the brain leads to fluctuating,inconsistent, or unpredictable moods and behaviors.The nondominant temporal lobe (usually the right) is involved with readingfacial expressions, processing verbal tones and intonations from others, hearingrhythms, appreciating music, and visual learning.Recognizing familiar faces and facial expressions and being able to accuratelyperceive voice tones and intonations and give them appropriate meaning arecritical social skills. Being able to tell when someone is happy to see you,scared of you, bored, or in a hurry is essential for effectively interactingwith others. Quaglino, an Italian ophthalmologist, reported on a patient in 1867who, after a stroke, was unable to recognize familiar faces despite being ableto read very small type. Since the 1940s, more than one hundred cases ofprosopagnosia (the inability to recognize familiar faces) have been reported inthe medical literature. Patients who have this disorder are often unaware of it(right-hemisphere problems are often associated with neglect or denial ofillnesses), or they may be ashamed at being unable to recognize close familymembers or friends. Most commonly, these problems were associated with deficitsof the right temporal lobe. Results of current research suggest that knowledgeof emotional facial expressions is inborn, not learned (infants can recognizetheir mother's emotional faces). Yet when there are problems in this part of thebrain, social skills can be impaired.The temporal lobes help us process the world of sight and sound, and give us thelanguage of life. This part of the brain allows us to be stimulated, relaxed, orbrought to ecstasy by the experience of great music. The temporal lobes havebeen called the \"interpretive cortex,\" as they interpret what we hear andintegrate it with stored memories to give meaning to the incoming information.Strong feelings of conviction, great insight, and knowing the truth have alsobeen attributed to the temporal lobes.PROBLEMS WITH THE DOMINANT (USUALLY LEFT) TEMPORAL LOBE• aggression, internally or externally directed• dar\\ or violent thoughts• sensitivity to slights; mild paranoia• word-finding problems• auditory processing problems• reading difficulties• emotional instabilityPROBLEMS WITH THE NONDOMINANT (USUALLY RIGHT) TEMPORAL LOBE• difficulty recognizing facial expression• difficulty decoding vocal intonation• implicated in social-sfyll strugglesPROBLEMS WITH EITHER OR BOTH TEMPORAL LOBES• memory problems, amnesia• headaches or abdominal pain without a clear explanation• anxiety or fear for no particular reason• abnormal sensory perceptions, visual or auditory distortions• feelings ofdeja vu or jamais vu• periods ofspaciness or confusion• religious or moral preoccupation• hypergraphia, excessive writing• seizuresTemporal lobe abnormalities occur much more frequently than previouslyrecognized. You'll note that many of the above symptoms are often thought of aspsychological when, in reality, for many they are biological. The temporal lobessit in vulnerable area of the brain in the temporal fossa (or cavity), behindthe eye sockets and underneath the temples. The front wall of the cavityincludes a sharp bony ridge (the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone), whichfrequently damages the front part of the temporal lobes in even minor headinjuries. (God would have done better to put bumper guards on that ridge.) Sincethe temporal lobes sit in a cavity surrounded by bone on fiveLooking Into Memory and Temperiqipicture66 [images/picture66.jpg]Model showing the base ofthesfydl (thic^arrow points to temporal fossa where thetemporal lobe sits; thin arrow points to sharp wing of lesser sphenoid bone).sides (front, back, right side, left side, and underside) they can be damaged bya blow to the head from almost any angle.Temporal lobe problems can come from many different sources, the most commonbeing genetics, head injuries, and toxic or infectious exposure. The temporallobes, prefrontal cortex, and cingulate gyrus are the parts of the brain mostvulnerable to damage by virtue of their placement within the skull. They arealso the most heavily involved in thinking and behavior.BlaineBlaine, age sixty, came to see me because his wife heard me speak at a nationalconference and she was sure he had a temporal lobe problem. He had memorylapses. He was moody and he was often aggressive. He also frequently saw shadowsout of the corner of his eyes and heard an annoying \"buzzing\" sound, for whichhis doctor could not find a cause. His temper flare-ups just seemed to come outof the blue. \"The littlest things set me off. Then I feel terribly guilty,\" hesaid. When Blaine was five years old, he had fallen off a porch headfirst into apile of bricks. As a schoolboy, he had had a terrible time learning to read andhad frequently gotten into fights. His brain SPECT study showed significantabnormalities in his left temporal lobe: a decrease in activity in both thefront and back and an area of increased activity deep within. Seeing theseabnormalities, it was clear to me that many of Blaine's problems came from theinstabilityBlaine's Brainpicture67 [images/picture67.jpg]picture68 [images/picture68.jpg]3-D underside surface viewNotice decreased left temporal lobe activity (arrow).3-D underside active viewNotice increased deep left tern poral lobe activity (arrow).of his left temporal lobe, likely a result of his childhood accident. I placedhim on Depakote, an antiseizure medication known to stabilize activity in thetemporal lobes. When I spoke to him three weeks later, he was elated. Thebuzzing and shadows had gone away, and he had not lost his temper since he hadstarted the medication. He said, \"That was the first time in my life I canremember going three weeks and not screaming at someone.\" Four years later histemper remains under control.Common problems associated with left temporal lobe abnormalities includeaggression (internally or externally directed), dark or violent thoughts,sensitivity to slights, mild paranoia, word-finding problems, auditoryprocessing problems, reading difficulties, and emotional instability. Let's lookat each of these in detail.The aggressiveness often seen with left temporal lobe abnormalities can beexpressed either externally toward others or internally in aggressive thoughtsabout oneself. Aggressive behavior is complex, but in a large study performed inmy clinic on people who had assaulted another person or damaged property, morethan 70 percent had left temporal lobe abnormalities. It seems that temporallobe damage or dysfunction makes a person more prone to irritable, angry, orviolent thoughts (much more on this will be discussed in the chapter onviolence). One patient of mine with temporal lobe dysfunction (probablyinherited, as his father was a \"rageaholic\")complains of frequent, intense violent thoughts. He feels shame over havingthese thoughts. \"I can be walking down the street,\" he told me, \"and someoneaccidentally brushes against me, and I get the thought of wanting to shoot himor club him to death. These thoughts frighten me.\" Thankfully, even though hisSPECT study confirmed left temporal lobe dysfunction, he had good prefrontalcortex function, so he is able to supervise his behavior and maintain impulsecontrol over his terrible thoughts. In a similar case, Misty, aforty-five-year-old woman, came to see me about her angry outbursts. One day,someone had accidentally bumped into her in the grocery store and she hadstarted screaming at the woman. \"I just don't understand where my anger comesfrom,\" she said. \"I've had sixteen years of therapy, and it is still there. Outof the blue, I'll go off. I get the most horrid thoughts. You'd hate me if youknew.\" She had fallen off the top of a bunk bed when she was four years old andhad been unconscious for only a minute or two. The front and back parts of herleft temporal lobe were clearly damaged. A small daily dose of Depakote was veryhelpful in calming the \"monster\" within.I often see internal aggressiveness with left temporal lobe abnormalities,expressed in suicidal behavior. In a study from our clinic we saw left temporallobe abnormalities in 62 percent of our patients who had serious suicidalthoughts or actions. After I gave a lecture about the brain in Oakland, a womancame up to me in tears. \"Oh, Dr. Amen,\" she said, \"I know my whole family hastemporal lobe problems. My paternal great-grandfather killed himself. Myfather's mother and father killed themselves. My father and two of my threeuncles killed themselves, and last year my son tried to kill himself. Is therehelp for us?\" I had the opportunity to evaluate and scan three members of herfamily. Two had left temporal lobe abnormalities, and Depakote was helpful intheir treatment.In terms of suicidal behavior, one very sad case highlights the involvement ofthe left temporal lobes. For years I wrote a column in my local newspaper aboutthe brain and behavior. One column was about temporal lobe dysfunction andsuicidal behavior. A week or so after it appeared a mother came to see me. Shetold me that her twenty-year-old daughter had killed herself several monthsearlier and she was grief stricken over the unbelievable turn of events in herlife. \"She was the most ideal child a mother could have,\" she said. \"She didgreat in school. She was polite, cooperative, and a joy to have around. Then itall changed. Two years ago she had a bicycle accident. She accidentally hit abranch in the street and was flippedover the handlebars, landing on the left side of her face. She was unconsciouswhen an onlooker got to her, but shortly thereafter she came to. Nothing was thesame after that. She was moody, angry, easily set off. She started to complainof 'bad thoughts' in her head. I took her to see a therapist, but it didn't seemto help. One evening, I heard a loud noise out front. She had shot and killedherself on our front lawn.\"Her tears made me cry. I knew that her daughter might well have been helped ifsomeone had recognized her \"minor head injury,\" which had likely caused temporallobe damage; anticonvulsant medication might well have prevented her suicide. Ofinterest, in the past twenty years psychiatrists have been using anticonvulsantsto treat many psychiatric problems. My suspicion is that we are frequentlytreating underlying physiological brain problems that we label as psychiatric.People with left temporal lobe abnormalities are often more sensitive to slightsand even appear mildly paranoid. Unlike people with schizophrenia, who canbecome frankly paranoid, people with temporal lobe dysfunction often thinkothers are talking or laughing about them when there is no evidence for it. Thissensitivity can cause serious relational and work problems.Reading and language-processing problems are also common when there isdysfunction in the left temporal lobe. Being able to read in an efficientmanner, remember what you read, and integrate the new information relies heavilyon the dominant temporal lobe. It is currently estimated that nearly 20 percentof the U.S. population has difficulty reading. Our studies of people withdyslexia (under-achievement in reading) often show underactivity in the backhalf of the left temporal lobe. Dyslexia can be inherited, or it can be broughtabout after a head injury damaging this part of the brain. Here are twoillustrative cases.DeniseThirteen-year-old Denise came to see me because she was having problems with hertemper. She had pulled a knife on her mother, which had precipitated thereferral. She also had school problems, especially in the area of reading, forwhich she was in special classes. Due to the seriousness of her aggression andlearning problems I decided to order a SPECT study at rest and duringconcentration. Atrest her brain showed mild decreased activity in the back half of her lefttemporal lobe. When she tried to concentrate, the activity in her left temporallobe completely shut down. As I showed Denise and her mother the scans, I toldDenise that it was clear that the more she tried to read, the harder readingwould become. As I said this Denise burst into tears. She cried, \"When I read Iam so mean to myself. I tell myself, 'Try harder. If you try harder then youwon't be so stupid.' But trying harder doesn't seem to help.\" I told her it wasessential for her to talk nicely to herself and that she would do better readingin an interesting, fun, and relaxed setting. I sent Denise to see theeducational therapist who works in my office. She taught her a specializedreading program that showed her how to visualize words and use a different partof the brain to process reading.CarrieCarrie, a forty-year-old psychologist, came to see me two years after shesustained a head injury in a car accident. Before the accident she had had aremarkable memory and had been a fast, efficient reader. She said reading hadbeen one of her academic strengths. After the accident, she had memory problemsand struggled with irritability, and reading became difficult. She said that shehad to read passages over and over to retain any information and that she hadtrouble remembering what she read for more than a few moments. Again, her SPECTstudy showed damage to the front and back of her left temporal lobe (the patterntypically seen in trauma). I had her see my biofeedback technician to enhanceactivity in her left temporal lobe. Over the course of four months she was ableto regain her reading skills and improve her memory and her control over hertemper.In our experience, left temporal lobe abnormalities are more frequentlyassociated with externally directed discomfort (such as anger, irritability,aggressiveness), while right temporal lobe abnormalities are more oftenassociated with internal discomfort (anxiety and fearfulness). The left-rightdichotomy has been particularly striking in our clinical population. Onepossible explanation is that the left hemisphere of the brain is involved withunderstanding and expressing language, and perhaps when the left hemisphere isdysfunctional, people express their discomfort inappropriately. Whenthe nondominant hemisphere is involved, the discomfort is more likely to beexpressed nonverbally.MikeNondominant (usually right) temporal lobe problems more often involve socialskills problems, especially in the area of recognizing facial expressions andvoice intonations. Mike, age thirty, illustrates the difficulties we have seenwhen there is dysfunction in this part of the brain. Mike came to see me becausehe wanted a date. He had never had a date in his life and was very frustrated byhis inability to successfully ask a woman out on a date. During the evaluationMike said he was at a loss as to what his problem was. His mother, whoaccompanied him to the session, had her own ideas. \"Mike,\" she said, \"misreadssituations. He has always done that. Sometimes he comes on too strong, sometimeshe is withdrawn when another person is interested. He doesn't read the sound ofmy voice right either. I can be really mad at him, and he doesn't take meseriously. Or he can think I'm mad, when I'm nowhere near mad. When he was alittle boy Mike tried to play with other children, but he could never hold on tofriends. It was so painful to see him get discouraged.\" Mike's SPECT studyshowed marked decreased activity in his right temporal lobe. His left temporallobe was fine. The intervention that was most effective for Mike was intensivesocial skills training. He worked with a psychologist who coached him on facialexpressions, voice tones, and proper social etiquette. He had his first date sixmonths after coming to the clinic.Abnormal activity in either or both temporal lobes can cause a wide variety ofother symptoms, including abnormal perceptions (sensory illusions), memoryproblems, feelings of deja vu (that you have previously experienced somethingeven though you haven't), jamais vu (not recognizing familiar places or people),periods of panic or fear for no particular reason, periods of spaciness orconfusion, and preoccupation with religious or moral issues. Illusions are verycommon temporal lobe symptoms. Common illusions include:• seeing shadows or bugs out of the corner of the eyes• seeing objects change size or shape (one patient would see lampposts turn intoanimals and run away; another would see figures in a painting move)• hearing bees buzzing or static from a radio not there• smelling odors or getting odd tastes in the mouth•feeling bugs crawling on the sfyn or other sfyn sensations Unexplainedheadaches and stomachaches are also common in temporal lobe dysfunction.Recently, the anticonvulsant Depakote received a clinical indication formigraine headaches. Often when headaches or stomachaches are due to temporallobe problems, anticonvulsants seem to be helpful. Many of the patients whoexperience sudden feelings of anxiety, nervousness, or panic make secondaryassociations to the panic and develop fears or phobias. For example, if you arein a park the first time you experience a feeling of panic or dread, you maythen develop anxiety every time you go into a park.Moral or religious preoccupation is a common symptom with temporal lobedysfunction. I have a little boy in my practice who, at age six, made himselfphysically sick by worrying about all of the people who were going to hell.Another patient spent seven days a week in church, praying for the souls of hisfamily. He came to see me because of his temper problems, frequently directed athis family, which were often seen in response to some perceived moral misgivingor outrage. Another patient came to see me because he spent so many hoursfocused on the \"mysteries of life\" that he could not get any work done and wasabout to lose his job.Hypergraphia, a tendency toward compulsive and extensive writing, has also beenreported in temporal lobe disorders. One wonders whether Ted Kaczynski, theUnabomber, didn't have temporal lobe problems, given the lengthy, ramblingmanifesto he wrote, his proclivity toward violent behavior, and his socialwithdrawal. (His loathing of high technology would make submitting to a SPECTscan out of the question for him.) Some of my temporal lobe patients spend hoursand hours writing. One patient used to write me twenty- and thirty-page letters,detailing all the aspects of her life. As I learned about temporal lobehypergraphia and had her treated with anticonvulsant medication, her lettersbecame more coherent and were shortened to two or three pages giving the sameinformation. Of note, many people with temporal lobe problems have the oppositeof hypergraphia; they are unable to get words out of their heads and onto thepage. I know a therapist who's a wonderful public speaker but cannot get thethoughts out of his head to write his book. On his scan there was decreasedactivity in both temporal lobes. On a very small daily dose of Depakote, hisideas were unlocked and he could write for hours at a time.HarrietMemory problems have long been one of the hallmarks of temporal lobedysfunction. Amnesia after a head injury is frequently due to damage to theinside aspect of the temporal lobes. Brain infections can also cause severememory problems. Harriet was a very gracious eighty-three-year-old woman who hadlost her memory fifteen years earlier during a bout of encephalitis. Even thoughshe remembered events before the infection, she could remember only small bitsand pieces afterward. An hour after she ate, she would feel full but couldn'tremember what she had eaten. Harriet said, \"I left my brain to the local medicalschool, hoping my problems would help someone else, but I don't think they'll doanything with my brain except give it to medical students to cut up. Plus I wantto know what the problem is. And write it down. I won't remember what you tellme!\" Harriet's brain showed marked damage in both temporal lobes, especially onthe left side, as if the virus had gone to that part of her brain and chewed itaway.Alzheimer's disease, a devastating progressive form of senile dementia, is thecause of one of the most common memory problems in the elderly. Unfortunately,it robs many people of their retirement years and can leave families physically,emotionally, and financially exhausted. SPECT is an important tool in diagnosingthis disorder. Before functional studies were available, the only way todiagnosesHarriet's Encephalitis-Affected Brainpicture69 [images/picture69.jpg]3-D underside surface view Note markedly decreased activity in both temporallobes (arrows).Looking Into Memory and Temper Alzheimer's Disease-Affected Brain199picture70 [images/picture70.jpg]3-D top-down surface viewNote markedly decreased parietal lobe activity (arrows).picture71 [images/picture71.jpg]3-D underside surface viewNote markedly decreased tern poral lobe activity {arrows).Alzheimer's was through autopsy. SPECT studies show a typical Alzheimer'spattern of decreased perfusion in both temporal lobes and decreased activity inthe parietal lobes. Sometimes this pattern is seen three to six years before theonset of symptoms. Some of the new anti-Alzheimer's drugs are showing promise inarresting the progression of this disorder and have been shown on SPECT toactually improve perfusion in the parts of the brain, mostly involved in memoryand thinking, such as the temporal lobes. Here is a scan of a man withAlzheimer's disease who had become forgetful, got frequently lost away fromhome, forgot how to do simple things such as dress himself, and was increasinglyaggressive toward his wife.Fyodor Dostoyevsky was reported to have had bouts of \"temporal lobe seizures.\"He felt his affliction was a \"holy experience.\" One of his biographers, ReneFueloep-Miller, quotes Dostoyevsky as saying that his epilepsy \"rouses in mehitherto unsuspected emotions, gives me feelings of magnificence, abundance andeternity.\" In The Idiot, Dostoyevsky writes:There was always one instant just before the epileptic fit. . . when suddenly inthe midst of sadness, spiritual darkness and oppression, his brain seemedmomentarily to catch fire, and in an extraordinary rush, all his vital forceswere at their highest tension. The sense of life, the consciousness of self,were multiplied almost ten times at these moments which lasted no longerthan a flash of lightning. His mind and his heart were flooded withextraordinary light; all his uneasiness, all his doubts, all his anxieties wererelieved at once; they were all resolved in a lofty calm, full of serene,harmonious joy and hope, full of reason and ultimate meaning. But these moments,these flashes, were only a premonition of that final second (it was never morethan a second) with which the fit began. That second was, of course,unendurable. Thinking of that moment later, when he was well again, he oftensaid to himself that all these gleams and flashes of supreme sensation andconsciousness of self, and therefore, also of the highest form of being, werenothing but disease, the violation of the normal state; and if so, it was not atall the highest form of being, but on the contrary must be reckoned the lowest.Yet he came at last to an extreme paradoxical conclusion. \"What if it isdisease?\" he decided at last. \"What does it matter that it is an abnormalintensity, if the result, if the sensation, remembered and analyzed afterwardsin health, turns out to be the acme of harmony and beauty, and gives a feeling,unknown and undivined till then, of completeness, of proportion, ofreconciliation, and of startled prayerful merging with the highest synthesis oflife?BryceLewis Carroll is reported to have had \"temporal lobe experiences,\" which weredescribed in the visual distortions of Alice in Alice's Adventures inWonderland. Seven-year-old Bryce became very upset when his mother read AlicesAdventures in Wonderland to him. He said that he felt like Alice. \"I have weirdthings happen to me,\" he told her. \"I see things.\" During the day he saw objectschange shapes, often getting smaller. He also saw green, shadowy ghosts atnight. Bryce also had a lot of anxiety symptoms. Frightened that Bryce waslosing his mind (a cousin had been diagnosed with a \"schizophreniclike\"illness), his mother brought him to see me. On hearing of these symptoms, Isuspected that one or both of his temporal lobes were acting up. His brain SPECTstudy confirmed abnormalities in his right temporal lobe and increased basalganglia activity. I prescribed Depakote (an antiseizure medication effective inthe temporal lobes), and he was also placed in psychotherapy to decrease hisanxiety. Within two weeks, Bryce's strange experiences disappeared, and over thenext six months his anxiety lessened.Bryce's Brain, Affected by Temporal Lobe Epilepsypicture72 [images/picture72.jpg]3-D underside active viewNotice area of increased activity in deep right temporal lobe (up arrow) and inbasal ganglia (down arrows).Ellen and JackEllen and Jack had similar histories: both had been somewhat reclusive; both hadperiods of spaciness; and both had periods of panic for no particular reason.Both had religious experiences that occupied a good deal of their lives. Ellen,age thirty-two, was nearly paralyzed by her deep religious feelings, unable towork and socially isolated. Jack took great interest in her periods of \"deepspiritual awakening,\" but was never able to make out what they meant. Ellen wasbrought to my office by her parents, who were concerned about her socialisolation. Jack wanted an evaluation for the panic attacks. The couple's SPECTstudies revealed marked increased activity in the deep aspects of their temporallobes. The majority of their symptoms went away on Depakote. Even takingDepakote, both remained deeply religious people, but they were no longerconstantly preoccupied with their thoughts.JimLike Ellen and Jack, Jim was bothered by periods of spaciness and panic. He alsohad periods of \"religious thoughts,\" in which he felt the \"presence of thedevil\" and was unsure and afraid. His fear of the devil haunted him, made himreclusive, and made him seem paranoid to his family. There was an interestingdifference between JimsSPECT study and Ellen's and Jack's studies: Jim's study revealed abnormalactivity in the left temporal lobe, not the right. In my experience, lefttemporal lobe problems are often associated with very negative or \"dark\"thoughts. After Jim was placed on Depakote, the \"presence of the devil\" wasgone.TEMPORAL LOBE CHECKLISTHere is the temporal lobe checklist.

Preoccupation with moral or religious ideas"},{"pageContent":"Enhancing Experience,Temporal Lobe PrescriptionsThe following prescriptions are geared toward optimizing and healing thetemporal lobes. They are based on what we have learned about the temporal lobes,as well as clinical experience with my patients. Remember that the temporallobes are involved with mood stability, understanding and processing language,memory, reading social cues (facial expression and voice intonation), rhythm,and music.TL PRESCRIPTION 1:CREATE A LIBRARY OFWONDERFUL EXPERIENCESStrive for a series of experiences that keep you motivated, healthy, and excitedabout your life. As the temporal lobes store the experiences of your life,keeping them stimulated with positive ones will help keep you healthy. Celebrateyour life on a regular basis; make your experiences count.Record the memorable experiences of your life with pictures, videos, diaryentries, and so on. Develop a library of wonderful experiences. Reexperiencethem whenever you can. Experiences are your link to life itself. Can it bepossible that home movies really are therapeutic? Perhaps not for family andfriends, but they certainly are for you.203TL PRESCRIPTION 2: SING WHENEVER/WHEREVER YOU CANSinging in the shower may be healing to your temporal lobes. Song has long beenknown to have healing qualities. You can often tell that a person is in a goodmood if he or she is humming or singing. Song is a true joy of life, no matterhow you sing.Song is often associated with spiritual experience. When I was in college, Iattended Calvary Chapel, a large church in southern California. The music wasmagical. Listening to the choir was not just a pleasant experience, it was awondrous experience that resonated through every cell in my body. The musicuplifted both the soul and mood of the congregation. The pastor said the musicwas \"blessed by God Himself.\" Several of my friends were choir members. Theywere often transformed when they started to sing. Shy people would become moreextroverted, more alive. People in the congregation became more involved in theservice during congregational singing. The church community glistened with thecontagious joy of the music.Preschool and kindergarten teachers have known for a long time that childrenlearn best through songs. They remember the material better, and it is easier tokeep them engaged in the activity. So why do we stop singing in the second orthird grade? Perhaps we should continue the singing into later grades.Interestingly, when I was in basic training in the military, we often sang whenwe marched. I still have those songs in my head. When we sang as a group, moralewent up, and the tasks that we were doing (like twenty-mile road marches) didn'tseem quite as bad.Sing whenever and wherever you can. You may have to sing softly if your voice islike mine (my sixteen-year-old daughter is often embarrassed when I sing inchurch). It will have a healing effect on your temporal lobes, and probably yourlimbic system as well.TL PRESCRIPTION 3:USE HUMMING AND TONINGTO TUNE UP YOUR BRAINIn The Mozart Effect, Don Campbell, founder of the Institute of Music, Health,and Education, lists the benefits of using your voice to enhance mood andmemory. He says that all forms of vocalization, including singing, chanting,yodeling, humming, reciting poetry,and simply talk can be therapeutic. \"Nothing rivals toning,\" he concludes. Theword toning goes back to the fourteenth century and means to make sounds withelongated vowels for extended periods of time. Ah, ou (as in soup), ee, ay, oh,and om are examples of toning sounds. Campbell writes that when people tone on aregular basis for five minutes a day, \"I have witnessed thousands of peoplerelax into their voices, become more centered in their bodies, release fear andother emotions, and free themselves from physical pain. ... I have seen manypeople apply toning in practical ways, from relaxing before a dreaded test toeliminating symptoms of tinnitus or migraine headaches.... Toning has beeneffective in relieving insomnia and other sleep disorders. . . . Toning balancesbrain waves, deepens the breath, reduces the heart rate, and imparts a generalsense of well-being.\" Campbell reports that in his experience certain soundstend to have certain effects on the body and emotions:Ahhh —immediately evokes a relaxation responseEe or ay —is the most stimulating of vowel sounds; helps withconcentration, releasing pain and anger Oh or om —considered the richest ofsounds; can warm skintemperature and relax muscle tensionTry toning for five minutes a day for two weeks to see if it will help you.In a similar way, humming can also make a positive difference in mood andmemory. Mozart hummed as he composed. Children hum when they are happy. Adultsoften hum tunes that go through their minds, lifting their spirits and tuningtheir mind. Consciously focus on humming during the day. As the sound activatesyour brain, you will feel more alive and your brain will feel more tuned in tothe moment.TL PRESCRIPTION 4: LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSICListen to a lot of great music. Music, from country to jazz, from rock toclassical, is one of the true joys of life. Music has healing properties.Listening to it can activate and stimulate the temporal lobes and bring peace orexcitement to your mind.Music therapy has been a part of psychiatric treatment for decades. Certainmusic has a calming effect on patients. Fast-tempo, upbeat music can stimulatedepressed patients in a positive way.In highly publicized work, researchers at the University of California at Irvine(UCI) demonstrated that listening to Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos (K448)enhanced visual-spatial learning skills. Frances H. Rauscher, Ph.D., and hercolleagues conducted a study with thirty-six undergraduates from the departmentof psychology who scored eight to nine points higher on a spatial IQ test (partof the Stanford-Binet Intelligence scale) after listening to ten minutes ofMozart. Gordon Shaw, one of the researchers, suggested that Mozart's music may\"warm up\" the brain: \"We suspect that complex music facilitates certain complexneuronal patterns involved in high brain activities like math and chess. Bycontrast, simple and repetitive music could have the opposite effect.\" In afollow-up study, the researchers tested spatial skill by projecting sixteenabstract figures similar to folded pieces of paper on an overhead screen for oneminute each. The test looked at the ability of participants to tell how theitems would look unfolded. Over a five-day period, one group listened toMozart's Sonata for Two Pianos, another to silence, and a third to mixed sounds,including music by Philip Glass, an audio-taped story, and a dance piece. Theresearchers reported that all three groups improved their scores from day one today two, but the group that listened to Mozart improved their patternrecognition scores 62 percent compared to 14 percent for the silence group and11 percent for the mixed group. On subsequent days the Mozart group achieved yethigher scores, but the other groups did not show continued improvement. Theresearchers proposed that Mozart's music strengthened the creative right-brainprocessing center associated with spatial reasoning. \"Listening to music,\" theyconcluded, \"acts as an exercise for facilitating symmetry operations associatedwith higher brain function.\" Don Campbell gives a nice summary of this work inThe Mozart Effect, along with many other examples of music enhancing learningand healing the body. Campbell writes that in his experience, Mozart's violinconcertos, especially numbers 3 and 4, produce even stronger positive effects onlearning.In the context of the temporal lobes, this research makes perfect sense sincethe temporal lobes are involved in processing music and memory. Certain types ofmusic may activate the temporal lobes and help them learn, process, and rememberinformation more efficiently. It is likely that certain types of music open newpathways into the mind.Certain music may also be very destructive. I believe it is no coincidence thatthe majority of teenagers who end up being sent to resi-dential treatment facilities or group homes listen to more heavy metal musicthan do other teens. Music that is filled with lyrics of hate and despair mayencourage those same mind states in developing teens. What your children listento may hurt them. Teach them to love classical music when they are young.Music is influential from a very early age. Dr. Thomas Verny in his book TheSecret Life of the Unborn Child cites scientific experiments showing thatfetuses preferred Mozart and Vivaldi to other composers in early as well aslater stages of pregnancy. He reported that fetal heart rates steadied andkicking lessened, while other music, especially rock, \"drove most fetuses todistraction,\" and they \"kicked violently\" when it was played to their mothers.Classical music and other beautiful, soothing music can positively stimulateyour brain.TL PRESCRIPTION 5: LEARN TO PLAY A MUSICAL INSTRUMENTIn a follow-up study by Rauscher and Shaw at UCI, thirty-four preschoolers weregiven piano keyboard training. After six months, all the children could playbasic melodies from Mozart and Beethoven. They exhibited significant increasesin visual-spatial skill—up to 36 percent improvement compared to otherpreschoolers who received computer lessons or other types of stimulation.Campbell cites the following studies: the College Entrance Examination Board in1996 reported that students with experience in musical performance scored 51points higher on the verbal part of the SAT and 39 points higher on the mathsection than the national average. In a study of approximately 7,500 students ata university, music majors had the highest reading scores of any students oncampus. Learning a musical instrument at any age can be helpful in thedevelopment and activation of temporal lobe neurons. As the temporal lobes areactivated in an effective way, they are more likely to have improved functionoverall.TL PRESCRIPTION 6: MOVE IN RHYTHMSThe temporal lobes are involved with processing and producing rhythms. Chanting,dancing, and other forms of rhythmic move-ment can be healing. Many Americans never learn about the concept of rhythm andhow important it can be to healing and health.Chanting is commonly used in Eastern religions and orthodox Western religions asa way to focus and open one's mind. Chanting has a special rhythm that induces atrancelike state, bringing peace and tranquillity and opening the mind to newexperiences and learning.Even for people with two left feet like myself, dancing and body movement can bevery therapeutic. When I worked on a psychiatric hospital unit, the patients haddance therapy three to four times a week. I found that my patients were oftenmore open and more insightful in psychotherapy after a dance therapy session.Dancing, like song and music, can change a person's mood and provide positiveexperiences to treasure throughout the day or week, or even longer.Look for opportunities to move in rhythms.TL PRESCRIPTION 7: CONSIDER TEMPORAL LOBE MEDICATIONSAbnormalities in the temporal lobes can cause serious problems, includingseizures, visual changes, abnormal sensory experiences, and serious behaviorchanges. Medications can often be very helpful in temporal lobe dysfunction.Depakote (divalproex), Neurontin (gabapentin), Lamictal (lamotrigine), andTegretol (carbamazepine) are antiseizure medications that are very effective instabilizing abnormal activity in the temporal lobes. They have been shown to behelpful for a wide variety of \"psychiatric\" problems, such as aggressiveness,intractable depression, manic-depressive disorder, migraine headaches, painsyndromes, and even learning disabilities. Dilantin, a classic antiseizuremedication, has also been shown to help some patients with temporal lobeabnormalities. If you suspect you have temporal lobe problems, obtain anevaluation by a neurologist or neuropsychiatrist.TL PRESCRIPTION 8: GET ENOUGH SLEEPCurrent research underscores the importance of sleep. A recent SPECT studydemonstrated marked decreased perfusion in the temporal lobes in people who gotless than six hours of sleep a night. Decreased sleep is also associated withmood instability, decreasedcognitive ability, irritability, and periods of spaciness—all temporal lobeproblems. When I was the chief psychiatrist at Fort Irwin in the Mojave Desert,I treated several people with severe sleep deprivation from military maneuvers.They often presented with symptoms of cognitive impairment, paranoia, andhallucinations. Sleep is essential to optimal brain function, especiallytemporal lobe function. Make sure you get at least six to eight hours everynight.TL PRESCRIPTION 9: ELIMINATE CAFFEINE AND NICOTINEIn our experience and the experience of other brain researchers, caffeine andnicotine are powerful vasoconstrictors that decrease blood flow to the brain,especially to the temporal lobes. Eliminate these substances from your body, orat least cut down on the amount you consume. You will feel sharper and more infocus overall. Even though caffeine and nicotine may help in the short run, theywill make things much worse in the long run. The overall decreased activitycaused by the caffeine and nicotine makes people use more and more to get thesame effect. They end up chasing a self-induced problem.TL PRESCRIPTION 10: WATCH YOUR NUTRITIONNutritional support can be very helpful in temporal lobe problems. Many peoplewith aggressive behavior become much worse after a high sugar load. Ifaggressiveness is present without features of depression or obsessive thoughts(more the explosive or short-fuse form of aggressiveness), then ahigher-protein/lower-simple-carbohydrate diet is likely to be very helpful. Ifthe aggressiveness is associated with ruminations, moodiness, and depression,then a balanced diet of equal amounts of carbohydrates and protein is likely tobe best.TL PRESCRIPTION 11: TRY EEG BIOFEEDBACKGiven what we have learned from SPECT, my clinic often uses EEG biofeedback toenhance temporal lobe functioning. When we see over- or underactive areas onSPECT, we put electrodes over those areas, measure the activity, and trainhealthier brain-wave rhythmsin that part of the brain. This can be very helpful for brain injury patients.One woman who was involved in a head-on collision had memory problems,irritability, and trouble reading after her accident. Her cognitive stateprevented her from returning to work, which fed a growing depression. On SPECTshe had decreased activity in the left temporal lobe. After twenty-five EEGbiofeedback sessions over her left temporal lobe, she reported markedimprovement in memory, was less irritable, and enjoyed reading once again. Hermood also improved, and she was able to return to work."},{"pageContent":"The Dar\\ SideViolence: A Combination of ProblemsViolence is a complex human behavior. There has long been a passionate debateover whether violent behavior is the result of psychological, social, orbiological factors. Current research indicates that violence in fact resultsfrom a combination of all three.Because of the lack of specific biological studies to evaluate violent behavior,clinicians have had to rely on family history to look for genetic factors, alongwith a history of head trauma, seizures, or drug abuse to evaluate possiblemedical causes. One of the reasons underlying the lack of clear biologicaldiagnostic tools in violence may be the diversity and variability of thereported findings in the scientific literature. Nonspecific and conflicting EEGfindings have been reported. A wide variety of neurotransmitter abnormalitieshave been reported, including disturbances of norepinephrine, dopamine,serotonin, acetylcholine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Numerousneuroanatomical sites have also been implicated in violence, including thelimbic system, temporal lobes, frontal lobe lesions, and prefrontal cortex.Our SPECT studies provide a useful window into the brain of violent oraggressive patients and help bring together the diversity of biologicalfindings. I have studied hundreds of children, teenagers, and adults whoexhibited violent or aggressive behavior and com-211pared them to people who have never been violent. The brain of the violentpatient is clearly different from that of the nonviolent person. I have foundclinically and statistically significant differences between aggressive groupsand nonaggressive groups clustered around three major findings: decreasedactivity in the prefrontal cortex, increased cingulate activity, and increasedor decreased activity in the left temporal lobe. Other significant findingsincluded increased focal activity in the left basal ganglia and on the left sideof the limbic system.The brain SPECT profile of the violent or aggressive patient suggested by thesefindings is:• decreased activity in the prefrontal cortices (trouble thinking)• increased cingulate activity (getting stuc\\ on thoughts)•focal increased or decreased activity in the left temporal lobe (short fuse)• focal increased activity in the basal ganglia and/or limbic system (anxietyand moodiness)CASE HISTORIESPaulPaul, a twenty-eight-year-old gardener, came to my clinic for work-relatedproblems. He had increasingly intense feelings of rage toward his boss. Paulsaid that his boss was prejudiced against him because he was Hispanic. Hefrequently thought about killing his boss, and he reported that only the thoughtof his wife and small daughter prevented him from doing so. He needed tomaintain his job in order to support his family. Paul could not get the angertoward his boss out of his head.He said that since childhood he had had many explosive outbursts. He imaginedhimself someday shooting down at people from the top of a tower. He describedhimself as having an extremely short fuse, especially while driving. At the ageof seven, he had ridden his bike full speed into a brick wall and had beenunconscious for several minutes.Paul had no evidence of a psychotic disorder or significant depression, althoughhe did complain of short periods of confusion, fear for no reason, and episodesof deja vu. His EEG was within normal limits. A brain SPECT study was obtainedin order to evaluate any underlying brain abnormalities that might have beencontributing to his difficulties.Paul's Aggression-Affected Brainpicture73 [images/picture73.jpg]picture74 [images/picture74.jpg]3-D underside active view 3-D side active viewNote markedly increased activity in left temporal lobe andcingulate (arrows).Paul's brain SPECT study was significantly abnormal. It revealed normal activityin the prefrontal cortex at rest that worsened when he tried to concentrate(problems with impulsivity). There was also moderate marked increased uptake inthe deep aspects of the left temporal lobe (short fuse) and the cingulate gyrus(stuck on thoughts).Because of the clinical picture and information from the brain SPECT study, Paulwas placed on the anticonvulsant Tegretol at therapeutic levels, along withProzac several weeks later. After six weeks, he reported that he noted a senseof increased inner control and inner peace. His periods of confusion, deja vu,and fearfulness diminished. His angry outbursts decreased, and he was able to goto work at a new job.StevenSteven, a thirty-nine-year-old radio station engineer, was admitted to thehospital for suicidal thoughts. He had recently separated from his wife of eightyears. During their relationship there had been mutual physical spousal abusefor which he had spent some time in jail. Steven also complained of having avery short fuse. He found himself frequently yelling at other drivers on theroad and was easily upset at work. On admission he was depressed and tearful,and had problems sleeping and poor concentration. He reported short periods ofconfu-Steven's Aggression-Affected Brainpicture75 [images/picture75.jpg]picture76 [images/picture76.jpg]3-D underside active view 3-D side active viewNote markedly increased activity in left temporal lobe andcingulate (arrows).sion, feelings of intense rage with little provocation, and times when he wouldsee shadows out of the corners of his eyes. His EEG was within normal limits.Steven's brain SPECT study revealed marked increased uptake in the deeperaspects of the left temporal lobe and marked increased activity in the cingulategyrus.With the clinical picture and information from the brain SPECT, it was decidedto start Steven on an anticonvulsant in addition to an antidepressant. He wasplaced on Tegretol at therapeutic levels along with Prozac. Even though hecontinued to feel sad about the breakup of his marriage, he felt calmer and inbetter self-control, and his suicidal thoughts abated. He did report that hewished he had known about the dysfunction in his temporal lobe years earlier. Hefelt it might have changed the outcome of his marriage.MarkMark, a thirty-four-year-old corporate employee, was referred by his counselorafter he was discharged prematurely from a drug treatment program for psychoticthinking. Mark had gone into drug treatment voluntarily, trying to break aten-year amphetamine addiction. Initially it seemed that Mark had an amphetaminepsychosis, but after four months free from any drugs, his paranoia andaggressive behavior escalated. On three separate occasions he stormed out of myoffice, cursing me as he left. He began to display dangerous be-Mark's Aggression-Affected Brainpicture77 [images/picture77.jpg]3-D underside surface viewNote markedly decreased activity, especially in left temporal lobe (arrow).havior, expressing homicidal and suicidal ideas along with grandiose thinking.He had gone through several similar episodes in the past. Mark refusedmedication, suspecting that I was trying to control him or poison him. He didconsent to having a brain SPECT study after much encouragement from his family.The first time Mark went for his SPECT study, he ripped the IV out of his armand ran from the clinic. He called me an hour later and cursed me out, sayingagain that I was trying to poison him. I called his mother, who calmed him downand sat with him through the test. His brain SPECT study revealed significantdecreased uptake in his left temporal lobe.With the clinical picture and the SPECT information, Mark was started on theanticonvulsant Tegretol at therapeutic levels. Within ten days, he felt calmerand was obviously less paranoid. Within a month, he returned to work at fullfunction and felt more in control of his temper than even before he had startedusing drugs. He was relieved to know about the temporal lobe dysfunction andfelt it explained many of the problems he had had in the past. He continued hismedication without incident.PeterPeter was a twelve-year-old boy with a history of oppositional behavior,emotional outbursts, increased activity level, short attentionspan, impulsiveness, school problems, frequent lying, and aggressive behavior.At age six, Peter had been placed on Ritalin for hyperactivity, but it had madehim more aggressive and had been stopped. He was admitted to a psychiatrichospital at age eight for aggressiveness, where he was diagnosed with depressionand started on an antidepressant, which had little effect. By the age of twelve,a psychiatrist in the Napa Valley had seen him for several years ofpsychotherapy, and his parents were seen in collateral sessions as well.The psychiatrist frequently blamed the mother as the \"biggest part of Peter'sproblem.\" He told her that if only she would get into psychotherapy and dealwith her childhood issues, Peter's problems would lessen. Peter's behaviorescalated to the point where he was frequently aggressive and uncontrollable athome. He was rehospi-talized on the day he attacked a classmate with a knife.I was on call the weekend Peter was hospitalized. To bond with the kids,sometimes I play football with them. Peter was on my team. On every single play,he tried to cheat. When we were on defense, he would move the ball back severalfeet and then turn around to look at me, as if he were trying to get me angry. Irefused to play his conflict-seeking game, but I decided it was time to get abrain SPECT study to help me understand Peter's need for turmoil.Peter's SPECT study was abnormal. There was significant left temporal lobeunderactivity; in addition, when he tried to concentrate, his prefrontal cortexshut down. Peter was placed on Tegretol at a therapeutic level. Within threeweeks, he was a dramatically different child. He was more compliant, better withthe other children on the hospital ward, atnd less conflict-seeking with thehospital staff. On the weekend he was being discharged from the hospital, I wasagain on call. As I had the month before, I gathered the kids on the ward and weplayed football. Peter was on my team. On every single play, he talked to meabout what we were going to do. There was no evidence of the priorconflict-seeking behavior. Peter was exhibiting socially effective behavior.After Peter's discharge from the hospital, his mother no longer looked like \"theproblem.\" Even though Peter was emotionally more stable, he still had symptomsof attention deficit disorder, having trouble concentrating and followingthrough on his schoolwork. Knowing about the drop-off in prefrontal cortexactivity, I added Cylert (a brain stimulant) to the Tegretol, which helped himperform much better in school. Eight years after his hospitalization, Peter isstable and doing well at school and at home. When Peter was sixteen,I gave a lecture to the faculty at his school. Peter saw me in the parking lot.He ran over to me and gave me a big hug (in front of his friends)!PROFILE OF VIOLENCEThese findings point to a brain SPECT profile of the aggressive patient thatinvolves several specific areas of the brain, especially the left hemisphere.When these findings are taken together, they suggest that aggression is acomplex process mediated by several different areas of the brain.Decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex is a finding often cited in peoplewho are having cognitive difficulty, such as in schizophrenia or majordepression. The prefrontal cortex is involved in mediating concentration,impulse control, and critical thinking. Aggressive people often misinterpretsituations and react in an impulsive manner.As mentioned above, increased activity in the cingulate is frequently noted inpeople who become \"stuck\" on certain thoughts or behaviors. Aggressive peopleoften become \"stuck\" on real or imagined injustices and think about them overand over. For example, in several of the case histories, the men often becameenraged while driving. They reported that if someone accidentally cut them offon the road, they would think and think about it to the point where they wouldhave to do something, such as honk, gesture, or even chase the other driver, inorder to get the thoughts out of their minds. Studies have shown thatmedications that increase serotonin in the brain (such as Prozac or Anafranil)normalize activity in the cingulate.Increased activity in the basal ganglia is often found in patients who haveanxiety or panic disorders. People who are aggressive often report a baselinelevel of tension or anxiety, and many clinicians have seen a pattern with thesepatients where they become increasingly more anxious before they strike out.Abnormalities in the limbic system have been associated with aggressiveness.Some researchers believe that affected people have limbic seizures. Studiesconsistently find that when the amygdala, a structure in the deep temporal lobesoften considered part of the limbic system, is stimulated, a person becomes moreagitated and aggressive. The limbic system is often cited as the part of thebrain that sets the mood, and abnormal activity in this area may be associatedwith significant moodiness.Aggression and abnormalities in the temporal lobes have been described innumerous studies. They are perhaps the most striking finding of our work.Medications such as Neurontin, Tegretol, and Depakote have been found helpful indecreasing abnormal activity in this portion of the brain.In my experience with brain SPECT imaging, left-side brain abnormalities areassociated with patients who are more irritable and aggressive. In addition,right-side brain abnormalities often correlate with patients who are morewithdrawn, socially conscious, and fearful, and much less aggressive.I was raised in a strong Catholic family. I was taught to believe that if youlive a clean life and work hard, you will be successful. I believed that therewas something the matter with the character of people who were drug addicts,murderers, child abusers, and even those who took their own lives. After beinginvolved with about five thousand brain SPECT studies my mind has changedcompletely. I now believe that it is essential to evaluate the brain whenbehavior is out of bounds. The brain is an organ that dramatically influencesbehavior, thoughts, and feelings. These cases and many like them are yet furtherexamples to me to press on studying the brains of people with abnormal behavior.What we need is more knowledge, more understanding, and less judgment.Sometimes I want to cry when I think of all the children and teenagers who arein group homes, residential treatment facilities, and juvenile halls, or whohave run away from home because their families could not deal with them anylonger. I know that many, many of them have brain problems that have never beenproperly evaluated. Perhaps they have seen a local counselor or physician wholooked at the abnormal behavior and told the parents that the child could behaveif only he or she really wanted to. In today's \"enlightened\" society, thatattitude is as prevalent as ever. No amount of trying would have changed Peter'sbehavior.Here is an example of the impact that brain problems can have on a family.Father-and-Son StudyNine-year-old Phillip was frightened when the police came to his school to talkto him. His teacher had noticed bruises on his arms and legs and had calledChild Protective Services. Phillip wasn't sure if he should tell them thetruth—that his father, Dennis, had beatenhim up—or if he should say that he had fallen down a flight of stairs orsomething like that. Phillip did not want to get his dad into trouble, and hefelt responsible for the beating he had received. After all, he reasoned, hisfather had told him ten times to clean his room, but for some reason unknown toPhillip, he hadn't done it. Phillip and his father often fought, but it hadnever been apparent to people outside the home. Phillip decided to tell thetruth, hoping that it would help his family get some help.Indeed, Phillip's family did get help. The court ordered counseling for thefamily and a psychiatric evaluation for the father. The father was found to beimpulsive and explosive in many different situations. He had begun to haveproblems with aggressiveness after sustaining a head injury in a car accidentsix years earlier. His wife reported that when Phillip had first been born, hisfather had been loving, patient, and attentive. After the accident, he hadbecome irritable, distant, and angry.In family counseling sessions, Phillip was very difficult—restless, overactive,impulsive, and defiant. He ignored his parents' request to stop his annoyingbehaviors. I soon discovered that the interaction between Phillip and his fatherwas the problem and counseling alone would not be helpful. I believed there wassome underlying biological or physical \"brain problem\" that contributed to theabusive interactions. In an effort to further understand the biology of thisfamily's problems, I ordered brain SPECT studies on Phillip and his father.The studies for both were abnormal. The father's clearly showed an area ofincreased activity in his left temporal lobe, probably a result of the caraccident. Phillip's revealed decreased activity in the front part of his brainwhen he tried to concentrate. As we have seen, this finding is often found inchildren who have ADD and are impulsive and overly active.After taking a history, watching the family interact, and reviewing the SPECTstudies, it was clear to me that Phillip's and his father's problems were, inpart, biological. I placed both of them on medication. The father was put on anantiseizure medication to calm his left temporal lobe, and Phillip was placed ona stimulant medication to increase activity in the front part of his brain.Once the underlying biological problems were treated, the family was able tobenefit from psychotherapy and begin to heal the wounds of abuse. In counselingsessions, Phillip was calmer and more attentive, and his father was better ableto learn how to deal with Phillip's difficult behavior in a constructive way.Whenever abuse of a child occurs, it is a severe tragedy. The tragedy iscompounded when the underlying brain problems that may be contributing to theabuse are ignored.SUICIDESuicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. It is oftenattempted when a person feels as though he or she has no other option. Suicidedevastates a family, often leaving parents, spouses, and children feelingabandoned, guilt stricken, and depressed.Brain SPECT studies have been useful in helping to understand suicidal behavior.I have scanned several hundred people who have attempted suicide. Theyfrequently show the violent pattern described above. The majority of thesepatients had increased cingulate activity (tendency to get stuck on negativethoughts); increased or decreased activity in the temporal lobes, most commonlyon the left side (short fuse and irritability); and decreased activity in theprefrontal cortex during a concentration task (impulsivity and poor judgment).Most suicidal thoughts are brief in duration. Yet when someone who gets lockedinto negative thoughts also has a short fuse and problems with impulsivity—watchout! Here are several examples.DannyDanny was eight years old when his mother brought him to my clinic after he hadtwice tried suicide. He had attempted to jump out of a moving car on thefreeway, and he had put a rope around his neck and tied it to the closet rod.Both times his mother had stopped him. She said that Danny had an obsession withdeath. He often complained that he hated his life and felt he'd be better offdead. At the age of three, Danny had fallen out of a motor home that was movingabout thirty miles per hour and sustained a head injury with a brief loss ofconsciousness. Over the next year, he had changed from a happy, fun-loving childto a surly, negative, unhappy child who was subject to monumental tempertantrums. A neurologist had ordered an EEG on Danny when the parents complainedhe was having periods of spaciness. The EEG was normal. As part of myevaluation, I ordered a brain SPECT study to evaluate why a child so young wouldexhibit suicidal behavior (which is very unusual in children under ten).Danny's SPECT study showed markedly increased activity in thedeep aspects of his temporal lobes, markedly increased activity in the cingulategyrus, and decreased activity in his prefrontal cortex during a concentrationtask. No wonder Danny was having so much trouble. Traditionally play therapy orpsychotherapy is the first line of treatment for depressed or suicidal children.Given the seriousness of this case, I placed Danny on Depakote, an antiseizuremedication, to stabilize his abnormal temporal lobe activity. Three weeks later,I added Zoloft to help with his obsessive thinking. Within six weeks, Danny losthis anger, his suicidal thoughts had disappeared, and he was able to interactwith his family in a more positive way. Danny was also seen twice weekly inpsychotherapy for a few months. Three years later, Danny remains on lowereddoses of his medication without any suicidal thoughts.MarySixteen-year-old Mary was admitted to the hospital for recurrent suicideattempts. This was her fifth psychiatric hospitalization, and she was going tobe transferred to a long-term residential treatment facility. Mary also hadproblems with obsessive thoughts about unusual sexual behaviors, and shecompulsively took eight to ten showers a day and changed her clothes that manytimes during a day as well. Her mother could barely keep up with the laundry. Onthe day Mary was admitted to the hospital, she had cut her wrists with brokenglass. Mary had a paternal uncle who had multiple incarcerations for assaultivebehavior. Her father's father was an alcoholic.Mary's brain SPECT study revealed markedly increased cingulate activity, alongwith increased activity in the left side of her basal ganglia and the left sideof her limbic system. The increased activity also spread into the deep aspectsof her left temporal lobe. No wonder she was in so much pain! She had triedProzac in the past, but it had made her more aggressive. Given her symptoms andSPECT findings, I put her on Depakote and Anafranil (an antiobsessiveantidepressant). Over the course of the next month, Mary became more relaxed,and she was able to talk about her obsessive thoughts. Her suicidal thoughtsdiminished, and it was decided that she could return home rather than go tolong-term treatment. She remained in therapy for several years and made no moresuicide attempts. Her SPECT study was repeated eight months later to make surewe were on the right track. There was an 80 percent decrease in activity in theareas of her brain that had been overly active.RandleRandle had been hospitalized for two serious suicide attempts before he came tosee me. He was the chief executive officer of a computer software company, andon the outside it appeared he was a man who had everything. He had a beautifulwife, three children, and a successful business. On the inside, however, he wastormented. He often went into rages at home over minor things. He drank toomuch, and he was obsessively jealous whenever any man looked his wife's way.Randle began having a repeat of his suicidal thoughts when he came to see me.Randle's father had killed himself when Randle was seventeen years old (suicideis often a modeled behavior). His father had been diagnosed as manic-depressive.Randle had an uncle who was an alcoholic, an aunt who was being treated fordepression, and a nephew who was on Ritalin for ADD.On close questioning, Randle said he had \"really dark days\" even when he wasn'tdrinking. He also complained of seeing shadows and of frequent spacy periods. Iordered a brain SPECT study to help understand the patterns in Randle's brain.It showed left temporal lobe abnormalities, increased cingulate activity, anddecreased activity in his prefrontal cortex when he tried to concentrate. Again,these findings are consistent with a short fuse, obsessive thoughts, andimpul-sivity. This symptom triad often leads to aggressive behavior, towardeither oneself or others. Randle had a very positive response to a combinationof Tegretol and Prozac.STALKINGIn my clinical practice I have studied four people who have been arrested forstalking. All four had the brain pattern I have described for violence with lefttemporal lobe problems, heavily increased cingulate activity, and decreasedactivity in the prefrontal cortex in response to a concentration task. Thesepeople would get stuck on negative thoughts, such as \"I must have her,\" and theywere unable to let go of those thoughts. In three of the four cases, medicationhelped these patients give up their obsessions. The fourth person went to jail.Cheryl was an example of successful treatment.CherylAfter seeing an interview on television, Cheryl, twenty-eight, became obsessedwith a player on a professional baseball team. Shestarted attending every home game. She wrote to him weekly. She couldn't stopthinking about him. She had a responsible job in a bank during the day, but atnight and weekends she focused mostly on this one celebrity. When she didn't getany response to her letters, she began trying to contact him by telephone and inperson. When this was unsuccessful the tone of her letters changed fromadmiration to irritation and then to subtle threats. After she sent aparticularly hostile letter, the team reported her to the police. The policewarned her to stop trying to contact the ballplayer.Her brother Peter had been seeing me at the time for obsessive-compulsivedisorder. He had had a nice response to the combination of Prozac andpsychotherapy. When he heard what was going on with his sister, he insisted thatshe come to see me. Reluctantly she came to my office.Cheryl was frightened by her own behavior. She had never before had any contactwith the police. \"I just couldn't get him out of my head,\" she said, referringto the ballplayer. Cheryl had for a long time had trouble getting certainthoughts out of her head. As a teenager, she had had problems with anorexia. Asan adult she had gone through many relationships. Her boyfriends had complainedthat she worried too much and was too jealous. As part of my evaluation, Iordered a brain SPECT study. It revealed a significantly overactive cingulate,left temporal lobe changes, and decreased prefrontal cortex activity. Cherylresponded nicely to a combination of an antiob-sessive antidepressant (Prozac),an anticonvulsant (Depakote), and psychotherapy. She said that the medicationallowed her to be more flexible and not get locked into repetitive thoughts."},{"pageContent":"Brain PollutionThe Impact of Drugs and Alcohol on the BrainRobertRobert, age thirty-nine, came to see me because he thought he had attentiondeficit disorder. He was forgetful, disorganized, and impulsive and had a veryshort attention span. However, he had not had these problems in school while hewas growing up. They had come on gradually during his adult life. Most notably,he also had a twenty-year history of heroin abuse and had been in multipletreatment settings. It is hard to describe my personal feelings when I initiallysaw his SPECT study. This man was about my age, yet through abusing drugs hisbrain has assumed the functional pattern of an individual fifty years older witha dementialike condition.When I showed Robert his SPECT study, he was horrified. Even though he had triedunsuccessfully to stop abusing heroin on many occasions, this time he went intotreatment and was able to stop. Later he told me, \"It was either the heroin ormy brain. I wasn't giving any more of my brain to the drug.\"Researchers consistently find that drug and alcohol abuse can cause seriousbrain damage. I often show Robert's studies and those of others like him to theteenagers I see in my office, as well as to224Brain Pollution Robert's Heroin-Affected Brain225picture78 [images/picture78.jpg]3-D top-down surface view Notice the large holes of activity across the brainsurface.picture79 [images/picture79.jpg]3-D front-on surface view Notice markedly decreased activity across the brainsurface.groups of teenagers when I lecture around the country. I find these picturesmuch more powerful than pictures of fried eggs (\"your brain on drugs\").Studying the effects of drugs and alcohol on the brain has been one of the mostinformative and fascinating parts of my work. While I was growing up I had asense that drugs and alcohol weren't beneficial to my overall health. Thisnotion was solidified by the results of getting drunk on a six-pack of Micheloband half a bottle of champagne when I was sixteen years old—I was sick for threedays. After that, I luckily stayed away from drugs and alcohol. After what I'veseen in my work, there's no way you could get me to use marijuana, heroin,cocaine, methamphetamine,* LSD, PCP, or inhalants or to drink more than a glassor two of wine or beer. These substances damage the patterns in your brain, andas you've gathered by now, without your brain, you are not you. In this chapter,I'll share with you some of the insights we have gained from SPECT about drugand alcohol abuse and tell you how I apply this information with my patients. Inthe next chapter I'll look at the connections among drug abuse, violence, andthe brain.There is quite a bit of scientific literature on the physiological effects ofdrugs and alcohol on the brain. The most common finding among drug and alcoholabusers is that their brain scans display an overall toxic look. In general,their brains look less active, more shriveled, less healthy overall. A\"scalloping effect\" is commonly seen in the brains of drug abusers. Normal brainpatterns show smooth activity across the cortical surface; scalloping is a wavy,rough sea—like pattern on the brain's surface. I see the same pattern inpatients who have been exposed to toxic fumes or oxygen deprivation.COCAINE AND METHAMPHETAMINECocaine and methamphetamine are rapidly taken up by the dopamine system in thebasal ganglia, causing short-term brain activation. Over time, amphetamine andcocaine abusers show multiple perfusion defects across both hemispheres of thebrain. On SPECT these areas look like mini-strokes across the surface of thebrain. These effects appear both acutely and chronically. One study investigatedthe cerebral blood flow patterns and cognitive functioning in cocaine abusers.The patients had been drug-free for at least six months before evaluation. Allshowed regions of significant underactivity in the frontal and temporal-parietalareas. Deficits in attention, concentration, new learning, visual and verbalmemory, word production, and visual-motor integration were observed. This studyindicated that long-term cocaine use may produce sustained brain blood flowdeficits and persistent intellectual compromise in some subgroups ofcocaine-abusing patients. In another study, crack abusers showed a 23 percentdecrease in cerebral blood flow com-*Methamphetamines are in a class of drugs known as psychostimulants. Thesemedications are used to treat attention deficit disorder. In therapeutic dosesthese medications are helpful and do not cause brain damage. Drug abuse andaddiction doses are typically 10-50 times what doctors prescribe, and in thosehigh doses these drugs are dangerous and highly addictive.pared to the control group, and crack users who were also cigarette smokersshowed a 42 percent decrease overall compared to the control group. Cigarettesmoking makes everything worse.JeffJeff, thirty-six, came to see me because he had severe problems abusingmethamphetamines. Child Protective Services (CPS) had taken his three youngchildren out of his home and placed them with his parents. He was also about tolose his job at a local warehouse because of chronic tardiness and erratic workperformance. His parents had called CPS because they knew about the drug abuseand were afraid for the safety of the children. Jeffs wife, also a drug abuser,had left the family several years before and was nowhere to be found. Hisparents had tried to get Jeff help, but he had refused, denying that there wereany problems. At first, when he was forced by the court to see me, he was indenial. It was everyone else's fault. He said that he used only a little bit andcouldn't understand why everyone was so upset. To help break through his denial,I ordered a SPECT study. It showed multiple holes in activity across the surfaceof his brain. When I showed Jeff his brain on the computer screen, his mouthdropped open. He didn't say anything for about three minutes. \"So much fordenial,\" I said. \"You have serious brain damage caused by this drug. Keep doingit and you won't have any choices about what you do. You won't have enoughbrainpower to make good decisions.\"Through Jeffs history, it was clear that besides the drug abuse he hadunderlying attention deficit disorder. He had a childhood history ofhyperactivity, restlessness, and impulse control problems, and a short attentionspan. He had barely finished high school, despite having a high IQ. He had beentreated with Ritalin for a brief period as a child, but his parents had feltuncomfortable about \"drugging\" their son. When he had started usingmethamphetamines as an adult, he said, they had helped him concentrate, he hadhad better energy and initially he had been better at work. In fact, Jeff hadthe right class of medication, brain stimulants. Yet he didn't know how to usethem to treat his problems. His estimated usage was approximately 500 milligramsa day—ten to twenty times higher than a therapeutic dose of a brain stimulant.And odds are, they were made in someone's garage and laced with other toxicchemicals. I knew that in order to really help him I had to treat his underlyingbrainJeffs Methamphetamine-Affected Brainpicture80 [images/picture80.jpg]3-D top-down surface view Notice the multiple holes in activity across the brainsurface.disorder as well as get him into a drug treatment program. I told him, \"Let medo your drugs for you. I'm a lot better at it than you are, and my drugs don'tcause this damage.\" I put him on a low dose of Adderall, which is a combinationof amphetamine salts that are slowly released into the body and that, inprescribed doses, have little if any potential for abuse. I also saw him weeklyand ensured that he attended a daily twelve-step program. After a year ofmaintaining sobriety and compliance with treatment, he was able to have hischildren come home.MarkMark, twenty-four, was very different from Jeff. He had been abusing cocaine fortwo years when he decided he had had enough and came to my clinic. He told me,\"When I first started using cocaine, I felt better around other people. I havealways been shy and uncomfortable in group settings. From my first hit ofcocaine, I felt more confident and was able to meet people without feelinganxious or uptight. But the more I used, the more I wanted to use. I want tostop.\" Mark was spending most of his paycheck on cocaine, and his parents werehassling him about never having any money, despite working full-time. As part ofa research study I ordered a SPECT study on Mark. It showed increased activityin his basal ganglia on the right and left sides (corresponding to his anxiety)and multiple holes acrossMark's Cocaine-Affected Brainpicture81 [images/picture81.jpg]3-D top-down surface view Notice the multiple holes in activity across the brainsurface.the top surface of his brain (indicating multiple areas of decreased brainactivity). He was very upset when he saw the scan. The first thing out of hismouth was \"Will my brain get better if I stop?\" I told him it was likely to getbetter, but there were no guarantees. One thing was certain: If he continued touse cocaine, things would get worse.People frequently ask me what will happen if they stop abusing drugs. I answer,it depends. It depends on what drug you used, how long you used it, what othertoxic substances might have been in what you used, and how sensitive yourindividual brain is. Some people are very sensitive to the effects of drugs anddamage becomes evident after a short while. Other people have more resistance todrug damage and can use for longer periods of time without serious damage. Itdepends. But who is to know ahead of time? Seems to me like a stupid risk totake once you have this information!I placed Mark in a drug treatment program and also saw him in individualpsychotherapy. I taught him other ways to calm himself in social situations(using biofeedback and ANT therapy). Later Mark told me that seeing his brainhad been the most powerful deterrent to doing cocaine. He said, \"You could havetold me all day long that cocaine was hurting me, but it felt so good. There wasno getting around seeing my brain with holes in it.\" In my experience, havingpatients see their own drug-damaged brain is the most powerful way to breakthrough the denial that typically accompanies drug abuse.ALCOHOLAlcohol abuse is also associated with cerebral blood flow abnormalities. Smalldoses of alcohol produce cerebral activation, while higher doses induce cerebralvasoconstriction and overall decreased brain activity. Chronic alcoholism isassociated with reduced cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolism, especiallyin the frontal and temporal regions of the brain. In one study, SPECT was usedto study seventeen healthy volunteers and a sample of fifty patients dependenton alcohol, without other major physical or mental disorders. The SPECT studieswere abnormal in thirty-four patients, but in only two volunteers. The mainabnormality was decreased activity across the whole cortex. A geneticvulnerability to alcohol was suspected in the study because SPECT abnormalitieswere more frequent in patients with a family history of drinking problems.Chronic alcohol abuse also decreases thiamine (a B vitamin essential forcognitive function) and puts patients at risk for Korsakoff's syndrome (KS). KSis an amnestic disorder in which the inability to record new memory traces oftenleads to confabulation (lying to make up for missed information) and a seeminglyparadoxical situation in which the patient can carry out complex tasks learnedbefore his illness but cannot learn the simplest new skills. In a studycomparing alcoholics with and without KS, both had overall decreased activity,but the decreased activity in the KS group was much more severe. The studyconcluded that chronic alcohol abuse, in the absence of thiamine deficiency,reduces cerebral blood flow by causing direct toxic effects on the brain. Ifthiamine deficiency is also present, more severe blood flow reductions aresuperimposed.\"But, Dr. Amen,\" you might ask, \"what about all of those studies that say that alittle bit of alcohol is good for your heart?\" A little bit of alcohol isprobably good for your heart and maybe even for your brain. Some studies suggestthat those who drink one to two drinks a day are psychologically healthier thanthose who don't drink at all. The operating phrase is \"a little bit.\" Long term,\"more than a little bit\" of alcohol ingestion causes severe problems that onSPECT make the brain look shriveled. If you have any trouble at all stoppingafter one or two drinks, it is better not to drink at all.CarlCarl, a forty-six-year-old attorney, came to see me after his wife threatened todivorce him if he didn't stop drinking. He had beenCarl's Alcohol-Affected Brainpicture82 [images/picture82.jpg]3-D underside surface viewNotice the shriveled appearance of the brain, especially in the prefrontalcortex and temporal lobes.drinking for twenty-five years and heavily for the past ten years. Even thoughhis drinking had just recently begun to affect his work, it had affected hisfamily life for many years. His children stopped asking friends over becausethey never knew when Daddy would be drunk. They worried about him constantly.Carl fought regularly with his wife about his drinking. And his blood pressurehad been elevated for several years. His doctor could not find a medicine tobring it down. Typical of many substance abusers, denial was part of Carl'sproblem, even when he was confronted by his whole family. I ordered a scan aspart of his workup. He reluctantly agreed. He saw the posters in my office aboutdrug abuse and the brain. Before his scan he said, \"Don't tell me if I have oneof those brains with holes in it. I don't want to know.\" I thought to myself,\"You better want to know. Otherwise you won't have enough brain left to care.\"Like many of my alcoholic patients, Carl had a shriveled brain that looked yearsolder than it was. As Carl looked at the studies of his brain, he started tocry. His wife, sitting next to him, put her hand on his shoulder. I waited a fewminutes for the impact to set in and then said, \"Carl, you have a choice. Youcan look at your brain and think, 'Hell, I already have one screwed-up brain, Imight as well go on drinking.' Or you can say to yourself, 'Thank God I havethis information now. Thank God my wife forced me to get help. My brain has achance to heal if I get away from this stuff now.' Alcohol is clearly toxic toyour brain.\" Carl didn't need much more. He stoppedCHANGE YOUR BRAIN, CHANGE YOUR LIFEdrinking completely, attended a twelve-step program, and started to rebuild hisrelationship with his wife and children.RobRob had been a brilliant geneticist, but in recent years he had been tired allthe time and unable to concentrate, and his work had suf-Rob's Brain, Affected by Alcohol, Cocaine, and Methamphetaminepicture83 [images/picture83.jpg]3-D top-down surface viewNotice the overall holes and shriveled appearance during abuse.picture84 [images/picture84.jpg]3-D top-down surface viewNotice marked improvement after a year of abstaining from drugs and alcohol.picture85 [images/picture85.jpg]3-D underside surface viewNotice the overall holes and shriveled appearance during abuse.picture86 [images/picture86.jpg]3-D underside surface viewNotice marked improvement after a year of abstaining from drugs and alcohol.fered. He sought therapy. The psychologist who saw him quickly sent him to seeme. Rob had been drinking alcohol heavily for the past five years, and he wasalso using cocaine and methampheta-mines for energy. The psychologist told himshe couldn't help him until he stopped drinking and using drugs. Clearly abright man despite the substance abuse, Rob just didn't understand how thesesubstances could be the problem. \"What will I do without them? I feel terriblewhen I try to stop. I feel agitated, depressed, and very anxious.\" I wondered ifRob weren't using the alcohol and drugs to treat underlying brain abnormalities.I convinced him to stop drinking and using drugs for two weeks (I helped himdetox from the alcohol with some medication) so that I could get some picturesof his brain. He clearly had a drug-affected brain with holes across the cortexand the shriveled appearance that comes from alcohol abuse. In addition, off hissubstances for two weeks, he had markedly increased activity deep in his basalganglia and right temporal lobe. I thought that perhaps he was using the alcoholas a way to settle down his overactive basal ganglia and temporal lobe and thenusing the cocaine and methamphetamines as a way to counteract the alcohol. Ishowed Rob his scan. I was surprised at how nonchalant he was in viewing hisbrain. He said, \"Do I really have to stop drinking? What am I going to do?\"During our session I stressed the need for him to completely stop alcohol anddrugs lest his brain deteriorate further. I also told him I would give him somemedication to calm his overactive areas, and odds were that he would be feelingbetter shortly. Concerned that Rob didn't understand the seriousness of hissituation, I called his therapist and reiterated how important it was for him tototally abstain from the drugs polluting his brain. She worked intensively withhim. The more he stayed away from the drugs and alcohol (and the better he feltwith his medication, which was more effective for his problems than alcoholmixed with cocaine and methamphetamines), the more he understood the importanceof the scan and the need to stay away from the substances he had been abusing. Ayear later, he was dramatically improved. His work was better. His relationshipswere more stable, and his overall attitude toward life was very positive. Infact, he sent me many other people to treat. I decided to get a follow-up SPECTstudy on Rob to see what progress we made with his brain. It had dramaticallyimproved, just as he had.KarenKaren, forty-eight, had waged a twenty-year battle with alcohol abuse. She hadgone through three marriages, five alcohol treatment programs, and multiplemedications. She complained of feeling tired, depressed, and angry. Without thealcohol she just didn't feel right. In addition, she had a terrible problem withimpulsivity. Whenever she was placed on a new medication, her doctor could giveher enough of it for only two or three days at a time. Otherwise she would takea whole month's worth of medication, no matter what it was for, within a fewdays. Surprisingly, no one had ever examined her brain to see if it held anykeys to why Karen was so resistant to treatment. Her doctor, after hearing oneof my lectures, sent her to see me for a scan. It showed overall decreasedactivity consistent with the alcohol abuse, but it also showed markedlydecreased activity in the prefrontal cortex. The part of her brain thatcontrolled impulses was damaged. On my intake form she reported that she hadnever had a head injury. I knew that many alcoholics, during blackouts, havehead injuries they are not aware of. I asked her doctor to check further intoher history for head injuries. When he asked her to check with her mother, hermother remembered a time when Karen had been kicked in the head by a horse atage seven and had been unconscious for about ten minutes. Given her history, Irecommended that Karen be given a small dose of a slow-release stimulantmedication to help her with impulse control. Slow-release stimulants, suchKaren's Brain, Affected by Alcohol and Head Injurypicture87 [images/picture87.jpg]picture88 [images/picture88.jpg]3-D underside surface view 3-D front-on surface viewNotice the overall shriveled appearance (scalloping) and markedly decreasedactivity in the prefrontal cortex (arrow).as Ritalin-SR, enter the system slowly and are not associated with any sort ofhigh, thus are not typically abused. I also made Karen poster-size pictures ofher brain to put up on her wall, which effectively reminded her that she reallydidn't want to keep drinking.OPIATESOpiate abuse has also been associated with severe blood flow abnormalities. Someof the worst brain damage I have seen was caused by heroin abuse. Robert's storyat the beginning of this chapter illustrates how serious it can become. In myexperience, heroin and other opiates (such as methadone, codeine, Demerol[meperidine], Dilau-did [hydromorphone], Percodan [oxycodone], and Vicodin[hy-drocodone]) consistently cause overall decreased activity throughout thebrain. These medications are very addictive and can literally take away yourbrain and your life. I often use the term \"brain melt\" to describe the SPECTappearance of opiate abusers. I have also seen similar serious brain damage inmethadone users. Many heroin addicts are medically administered methadone as away to help treat their addiction, decrease crime (if they get their druglegally, they don't need to commit crimes to get money to buy it), and eliminatethe spread of infection from dirty needles. Even though I understand the logicbehind methadone treatment centers, we must do a better job. Dosing drug addictswith methadone perpetuates the ongoing drug brain damage, and I fear thesepatients will be unable to ever get better.DougDoug, age forty, was referred to me by a doctor who worked in a San Franciscodrug treatment clinic. Doug had been addicted to heroin and had subsequentlybeen in a methadone maintenance program for seven years. The doctor continued tosee Doug go downhill, despite treatment. He wondered what seven years ofmethadone had done to his brain. He had wanted to get him off the methadone, butDoug was panicked by the idea and other members of the treatment team wereresistant. Doug's SPECT study showed significant overall decreased activity. AsI showed Doug his brain, his attitude about methadone changed. \"I need to getoff this stuff,\" he said, \"otherwise I won't have much brain left.\" He, and thetreatment team, agreed to take him completely off opiates using a newrapid-detox protocol de-Doug's Brain, Affected by Heroin and Methadonepicture89 [images/picture89.jpg]3-D top-down surface view Notice the large holes of activity across the brain'ssurface.veloped at Yale University. It worked for Doug, and he was grateful to be freeof the drugs.MARIJUANAMarijuana use is common among Americans. It is estimated that 67.4 millionAmericans have tried marijuana, 19.2 million in the past year and 9.7 million inthe past month. Many teenagers and young adults believe that marijuana is safe,despite a number of studies demonstrating cognitive, emotional, and socialimpairment with chronic or heavy usage. Marijuana has also been described as a\"gateway\" drug by several researchers, with one study reporting that 98 percentof cocaine users started with marijuana. Despite these studies, there iscontroversy both in the mind of the general population and in the medicalcommunity about whether marijuana use is harmful. Legalizing marijuana has beena social/political topic for decades.I am truly amazed by the nonchalant attitude our country has toward marijuanausage. Even my home state of California passed a law in 1996 legalizingmarijuana as medicine. I think many people misunderstood Proposition 215,feeling that by voting for it they were allowing people dying from cancer tohave marijuana to soothe their pain and increase their appetites. What they gotwas a law that basically says a doctor can write a prescription for marijuanafor anything including anxiety, stress, moodiness, or irritability. The biggestproblem with the law, as I see it, is that the perception of marijuana'sdangerousness has gone way down. Teenagers tell me that it's medicine, not aproblem. Drug abuse expert Mark Gold, M.D., put it succinctly: \"As theperception of a drug's dangerousness goes down, its use goes up.\"SPECT has been used to study both the short-term and long-term effects ofmarijuana on the brain. These studies report that inexperienced marijuanasmokers had an acute decrease in cerebral blood flow and that chronic marijuanausers had overall decreased perfusion when compared to a nonusing control group.In performing many SPECT studies on marijuana abusers I noticed decreasedtemporal lobe activity that was not mentioned in the above studies, most likelybecause of the lesser sensitivity of the SPECT resolution in older scans. Iwondered if our newer findings were the cause of the memory and motivationproblems often associated with marijuana usage. I decided to study the effectsof marijuana on the brain, comparing patients who had ADD and chronic marijuanausage with people who had ADD with no drug usage. I did this for three reasons:First, the functional brain-imaging studies of ADD have not shown temporal lobeabnormalities. Utilizing a control group with the same diagnosis rather than ageneral psychiatric control group eliminates the possibility of contaminatedfindings. Even a normal control group adds an uncertainty because so manymarijuana users have additional diagnoses. Second, I felt that comparing them toa population with the same, common diagnosis would give useful information.Finally, 52 percent of people with ADD have been reported to have problems withsubstance abuse, a high number of them with marijuana abuse.I compared the scans of thirty teenage and adult marijuana smokers (who had usedit for a minimum of one year at least on a weekly basis) who had been diagnosedwith ADD, with ten control group subjects also diagnosed with ADD, matched forage, sex, and handedness, who had never abused any drugs. In the marijuana/ADDgroup, by clinical history, marijuana was the primary drug of choice and noother drugs of abuse had been used in the prior year; again by history, therewas no significant alcohol use by these patients (significant alcohol use inthis study meant more than three ounces of hard liquor or six beers a week). Theinterval between the most recent marijuana use and the SPECT scan was one to sixmonths, by clinical history. Anyone who met the diagnostic criteria for alcoholorMarijuana-Affected Brainspicture90 [images/picture90.jpg]3-D underside surface viewSixteen-year-old male with two-year history of daily usage; notice multipleareas of markedly decreased perfusion, especially in the temporal lobes (arrow).picture91 [images/picture91.jpg]3-D underside surface viewForty-four-year-old male with twelve-year history of daily usage; noticemarkedly decreased perfusion on undersurface of the brain.picture92 [images/picture92.jpg]3-D underside surface viewThirty-two-year-old female with a twelve-year history of mostly weekend usage;notice areas of decreased perfusion in medial temporal lobes.other substance abuse or dependence was eliminated from the study. Marijuanausage ranged from daily to weekly, and from one year to twenty-two years. Allpatients were medication-free at the time of the study, and participantsreported being at least thirty days free from any marijuana usage. In addition,patients who were taking stimulant medication for ADD had been medication-freefor at least one week.The only abnormality seen in the ADD control group was decreased activity in theprefrontal cortex in eight of the ten subjects. A similar number ofmarijuana/ADD subjects had decreased prefrontal cortex activity—twenty-five ofthirty (83 percent)—but overall, this decreased activity in the prefrontalcortex was more severe. In addition, twenty-four marijuana/ADD subjects showeddecreased activity in the temporal lobes; five (21 percent) were rated assevere, seven (29 percent) were rated as moderate, and twelve (50 percent) wererated as mild. The severe and moderate ratings were in the heaviest users (usehad been greater than four times a week in the preceding year), but notnecessarily the longest users. One teenager who had been a daily user for twoyears showed some of the most profoundly poor temporal lobe perfusion among thegroup. Clinically, four patients had an amotivational syndrome (severe lack ofinterest, motivation, and energy). All four had decreased perfusion in theirtemporal lobes; three were rated as severe, one was rated as moderate.This study was consistent with previous studies mentioned above demonstratingthat frequent, long-term marijuana use has the potential to change the perfusionpattern of the brain. While prior studies showed global decreased brainactivity, I found focal decreased activity in the temporal lobes. (This may beaccounted for by the increased sophistication of the imaging camera used.)Abnormal activity in the temporal lobes has been associated with problems inmemory, learning, and motivation—common complaints of teenagers (or at leasttheir parents) and adults who chronically abuse marijuana. Amotivationalsyndrome, marked by apathy, poor attention span, lethargy, social withdrawal,and loss of interest in achievement have been attributed to marijuana abuse formany years. One teenage male in the study, who had used daily for two years, hadone of the most severe cases of temporal lobe underactivity. He had symptomsconsistent with amotivational syndrome and had dropped out of school in theeleventh grade.Inhalant-Affected Brainpicture93 [images/picture93.jpg]3-D top-down surface view Notice the large holes of activity across the brainssurface.INHALANTSInhalants, such as gasoline, correction fluid, paint thinner, lighter fluid, andglue are also seriously abused. I once had a four-year-old patient who wasaddicted to inhalants. His mother told me that he would go into the garage, takethe gas cap off the lawn mower, put his mouth over the opening, and take a deepbreath, becoming intoxicated by the fumes. His mother reported that he inhaledmany different substances. I first evaluated this child in the playroom of myoffice. He was very hyperactive. During the middle of our session he went overto a white marker board and took the top off a marker. He put the marker up tohis nose and inhaled deeply. He then gave me a big smile like \"Yeah, this feelsgood.\"Inhalants are processed directly into the brain and can cause damage to thebrain, lungs, and liver. They are dangerous! Most inhalants and solvents areshort-term vasodilators; chronic abuse, however, is often accompanied by seriousdecreased cerebral blood flow.The accompanying SPECT scan shows the brain of a forty-nine-year-old patient whohad used inhalants over a twelve-year period. It looks much like a cocaine- ormethamphetamine-affected brain.CAFFEINE AND NICOTINEI know this next section may make many people uncomfortable, but I have to tellit as I see it. Published research indicates that caffeine,even in small doses, is a potent cerebral vasoconstrictor (decreases brain bloodflow). My experience also suggests this to be true. The more caffeine youconsume (caffeine is found in coffee, tea, most sodas, chocolate, and many coldremedies), the more underactivity occurs in your brain. Many people, especiallymy ADD patients, use caffeine as a brain stimulant. They use it to get going andkeep going through the day. The problem with caffeine is that even though in theshort run it may help, in the long run it makes things worse. Then you beginchasing the underactivity caused by the caffeine with more caffeine, worseningan already tough brain condition. Periodic caffeine usage is probably not a bigproblem. Heavy daily usage (more than three cups of coffee a day) is a problemand needs to be stopped in order to maintain a healthy brain. Of interest, thebrain stimulants such as Ritalin or Adderall in therapeutic doses to treat ADDenhance brain activity.There are so many reasons to stop smoking, you probably don't need another one.Yet in my experience, if you want to have full access to your brain, don'tsmoke. Shortly after you stop smoking, blood flow to the brain increases,although long-term smokers have overall marked decreased activity.A successful businessman whom I knew socially came to visit me. He said that hehad recently had trouble concentrating and his energy was low. I knew that hesmoked three packs of cigarettes and drank at least three pots of coffee everyday. For a long time I had suspected he had ADD (he had underachieved in school,did impulsive things, and could never sit still) and that he was medicatinghimself with the stimulant effects of caffeine and nicotine. He was the CEO of avery successful corporation and not used to taking advice from others. I toldhim about ADD and said that it would be a good idea to treat it and stopself-medicating with high-dose caffeine and nicotine. His first comment was thathe didn't want to take medication. Didn't I have a natural treatment for it? Abit amazed, I said, \"You are taking two 'natural' treatments for ADD—caffeineand nicotine—but they might kill you. The medication I prescribe is moreeffective, and when it is used properly, it doesn't kill anyone.\"I suggested that SPECT images of his brain might help him see the reality of thesituation and encourage him to stop. Even I was surprised by how bad his brainlooked. He had markedly decreased activity across the whole cortex, especiallyin the areas of the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes. I told my friend thathe needed to find some way other than using caffeine and nicotine to stimulatehisBrain Affected by Heavy Caffeine and Nicotine Usepicture94 [images/picture94.jpg]3-D underside surface viewNote markedly decreased activity overall, especially in prefrontal cortex andtemporal lobes.brain or it was unlikely he would have much of a brain left to enjoy hissuccess. He took my advice for a few weeks, but shortly went back to his oldways. I wondered whether his poor temporal lobe activity made him unable to holdthe SPECT images in his memory or his very poor prefrontal cortex activityprevented sufficient impulse control. Even though I recommended he try a brainstimulant, such as Ritalin or Adderall, he maintained that he wanted to treathis ADD \"naturally.\"WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU STOP ABUSING DRUGS?Many people ask me what happens to the brain when alcohol or drug abuse isstopped. It depends. Generally, the longer a substance has been abused, the moretoxic its effect. Certain drugs are clearly more toxic than others. It dependson what other toxic substances were also in the drug and on the sensitivity ofthe user's brain. There are rare individuals who can abuse drugs for a long timebefore stopping with few if any lasting ill effects. Others can incur braindamage after a very short period of time. In either case, the sooner you stop,the better chance your brain has to heal.THE POSTER: WHICH BRAIN DO YOU WANT?In 1997 I developed a drug education poster titled \"Which Brain Do You Want?\"Based on my work with drug abusers and SPECT, itwas intended to break through the perception that drugs are not dangerous. Theposter compares a normal brain to those of a heroin addict, a cocaine abuser, analcoholic, and a chronic marijuana abuser. The damage caused by substance abuseis immediately apparent:• Normal brain is smooth, symmetrical, and full.• The heroin brain shows massive areas of decreased activity throughout.• The cocaine brain shows multiple small holes across the cerebral cortex.• The alcoholic brain loo^s shriveled.• The marijuana brain loof^s as though areas are eaten away, especially in thetemporal lobe region, the seat of language and learning.After seeing these images, many of my patients tell me that they have no moreinterest in using drugs. They want the use of their whole brain. \"Not one withholes in it,\" as a nineteen-year-old stated as he saw his brain scan aftercoming out of a sentence to juvenile hall due to marijuana abuse.I use these brain images day to day in my work with drug addicts, especiallyteenagers and young adults who are starting to experiment with drugs. Showingsomeone his or her own drug-damaged brain has a powerful impact. Many of mypatients begin the process of recovery immediately.In testing the effectiveness of the poster, one hundred people, ages twelve toforty, filled out a questionnaire. Over 50 percent of the people whoparticipated in the study said that the poster had changed the way they thoughtabout drugs. Sample comments from the study included:\"I had no idea marijuana could be harmful to the brain. Why did they justlegalize it in California?\"\"I don't want any holes in my brain. Ym staying away from drugs.\"\"Drugs affect your brain in a serious way.\"\"This really changed the way I thinly about alcohol use and marijuana. \"\"If they harm me, I want nothing to do with them.\"\"No one at school told me about this part. They just said drugs were cool to do.Seems pretty stupid to me.\"The poster now hangs in over one hundred prisons, hundreds of schools across thecountry (the L.A. County School District bought one for each school), drugtreatment centers, and hospitals. The criminal court system in Cleveland boughtsix hundred posters togive to people who came through the system. The chief judge said he needed toeducate people on the real effects of drugs.For more information on this poster, call 707-429-7181, write me at 350Chadbourne Road, Fairfield, CA 94585, or see my website at www.amenclin ic. com."},{"pageContent":"The Missing Lin^sDrugs, Violence, and the BrainThere is a well-established connection between substance abuse and violence.Understanding the intricacies of this connection is essential to findingeffective interventions and solutions. Much has been written about thepsychosocial causes of drug abuse and violence, but there have been few studiesof the biological relation of drugs and violence to the brain.Through our brain-imaging work, we have recognized several clinical and SPECTpatterns that may help further the understanding of the connection betweensubstance abuse and violence and the brain. These observations have been madefrom our clinical database of over five thousand SPECT studies on a wide varietyof neuropsychiatry patients, including more than 350 patients who had hadproblems with aggressive behavior during the six months before evaluation. (Theyhad either destroyed property or physically attacked another person.) Inaddition, our clinic has been involved in approximately thirty forensicneuropsychiatric evaluations of violent offenders who have committed murder,rape, armed robbery, assault, torture, and stalking, many of whom hadsignificant substance abuse problems as well. In this chapter, I examine theconnection between substance abuse and violence through the lens of our workwith SPECT.In reviewing the literature on substance abuse it is important to note thatsubstances traditionally linked with violence (e.g., cocaine,245methamphetamine, and alcohol) cause abnormal perfusion patterns in the areasthat have been associated with violent behavior. Nicotine and caffeine may alsobe involved and may magnify the negative effects of other substances.Here are five patterns connecting the links between drugs, violence, and thebrain.1. Using drugs, especially alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamines, phencyclidine,and anabolic steroids, may directly elicit aggressive behavior.This may be especially true when the user is prone to violence due to underlyingbrain vulnerabilities (such as a combination of problems in the prefrontal,cingulate, dominant temporal lobes, and dominant limbic and basal gangliaareas).JohnJohn, a right-handed seventy-nine-year-old contractor, had a longstandinghistory of alcohol abuse and violent behavior. He had frequently physicallyabused his wife over forty years of marriage and had been abusive to theirchildren when they were living at home. Almost all of the abuse occurred when hewas intoxicated. At age seventy-nine, John underwent open-heart surgery. Afterthe surgery he had a psychotic episode that lasted ten days. His doctor ordereda SPECT study as part of his evaluation. The study showed markedly decreasedactivity in the left-outside frontal-temporal region, a finding most likely dueto a past head injury. When the doctor asked John if he had ever had anysignificant head injuries, John told him that at age twenty he'd been driving anold milk truck that was missing its side rearview mirror. He had put his headout of the window to look behind him, and his head had struck a pole, knockinghim unconscious for several hours. After the head injury he had more problemswith his temper and memory. There was a family history of alcohol abuse in fourof his five brothers. None of his brothers had problems with aggressivebehavior.Given the location of the brain abnormality (left frontal-temporal dysfunction),John was likely to exhibit violent behavior. Alcohol abuse, which did not elicitviolent behavior in his brothers, did contribute to John's violence. If John hadseen and understood his SPECT scan earlier, he could have sought help andprevented hurt to his family.John's Brainpicture95 [images/picture95.jpg]3-D left side surface viewNote area of markedly decreased activity in the left frontal and temporal region(arrow).2. Drug or alcohol usage may impair executive function and increase thelikelihood of aggression.BradleyBradley was diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) andleft temporal lobe dysfunction (diagnosed by EEG) at the age of fourteen. Beforethen (from grades one through eight) he had been expelled from eleven schoolsfor fighting, frequently cut school, and had already started drinking alcoholand using marijuana. He had a dramatically positive response to 15 milligrams ofRitalin three times a day. He improved three grade levels of reading within thenext year, attended school regularly, and had no aggressive outbursts. Hisgrandmother (with whom he lived) and his teachers were very pleased with hisprogress. However, Bradley hated taking medication. He said that taking it madehim feel stupid and different, even though it obviously helped him. Two yearsafter starting his medication, he decided to stop it on his own without tellinganyone. His anger began to escalate again, as did his drinking and marijuanausage. One night while he was intoxicated, his uncle came over to his home andasked Bradley to help him \"rob some bitches.\" Bradley went along with his uncle,who forced a woman into her car, then made her go to an ATM and withdraw money.The uncle and Bradley then raped the woman twice. Bradley was apprehended twoweeks later and charged with kidnapping, robbery, and rape.Bradley's Brainpicture96 [images/picture96.jpg]picture97 [images/picture97.jpg]3-D underside surface viewBradley's concentration study (no medication); note decreased left prefrontalcortex and left temporal lobe activity (arrow).Concentration study with Ritalin; notice overall improved activity.As the psychiatric forensic consultant, I agreed with the clinical diagnosis ofADHD and also suspected left temporal lobe dysfunction because of Bradley'schronic aggressive behavior and abnormal EEC I ordered a series of brain SPECTstudies: one while he was doing a concentration task without medication and onewhile he was doing a concentration task on Ritalin. The resting study showedmildly decreased activity in the left prefrontal cortex and the left temporallobe. While he was performing a concentration task, there was marked suppressionof the prefrontal cortex, a common finding in ADHD, and both temporal lobes. Thethird scan was done one hour after Bradley took 15 milligrams of Ritalin. Thisscan showed marked activation in the prefrontal cortex and both temporal lobes,although there was still some mild deactivation in the left temporal lobe.It was apparent that Bradley already had a brain vulnerable to long-termbehavioral and academic difficulties. His substance use may have furthersuppressed an already underactive prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe,diminishing executive abilities and unleashing aggressive tendencies. It ispossible that if someone had explained the underlying metabolic problems toBradley and provided him with brief psychotherapy to address the emotionalissues surrounding the need to take medication, his crime spree might have beenaverted. In prison, he was placed on Cylert (a brain stimulant similarThe Missing LinJ^s Rusty's Brain249picture98 [images/picture98.jpg]picture99 [images/picture99.jpg]3-D active side viewWhile Rusty is on high-dose meth-amphetamine, the left temporal lobe appearsrelatively normal.3-D active side viewWhen Rusty is drug-free, there is markedly increased activity in the lefttemporal lobe.picture100 [images/picture100.jpg]3-D underside active viewNotice hot area in deep left temporal lobe (arrow).picture101 [images/picture101.jpg]3-D top-down surface viewNotice multiple holes across cortex.to Ritalin) and Depakote. He has had no aggressive outbursts in the past twoyears.3. Drugs or alcohol may be used as self-medication for underlying brain problemsinvolved in aggression.Many substance abusers have dual psychiatric diagnoses, and we believe they maybe using their substances as a way to medicate underlying psychiatric orneurological problems, such as depression,panic symptoms, posttraumatic stress anxiety, and even aggressive behavior.RustyTwenty-eight-year-old Rusty was brought to see me by his parents. He had asevere methamphetamine problem that had wreaked havoc in his life. He was unableto keep steady work; he was involved in a physically abusive relationship withhis girlfriend (he had been arrested four times for assault and battery); he wasmean to his parents even though they tried to help him; and he had failed fivedrug treatment programs. In the last program the counselor had recommended a\"tough love\" approach: He had told the parents to let Rusty \"hit bottom\" so thathe would want help. The parents read about my work and decided to do one morething before going the \"tough love\" route. Rusty's lack of responsiveness totraditional treatments made me suspect an underlying brain problem. We scheduleda SPECT scan with the parents, but Rusty didn't know about it until the morninghe was supposed to have it. He showed up at the clinic loaded on high-dosemethamphetamine from the night before. Rusty told me about his drug abuse. Hesaid, \"I'm sorry for messing up the scan. I'll come back next week. I promise Iwon't use anything.\" I had often wanted to do SPECT studies on peopleintoxicated with illegal substances to see their effects on the brain, but dueto ethical concerns I hadn't. But if a person shows up for the scan on drugsthere isn't an ethical issue. I decided to scan Rusty that morning with theeffects of the methamphetamine still in his system and then a week later off alldrugs. It turned out to be a very fortuitous decision. When Rusty was under theinfluence of high-dose methamphetamine, his brain activity appeared suppressed.A week later, however, off all drugs, he had a terribly overactive left temporallobe, probably causing his problems with violent behavior. Likely, Rusty wasunconsciously self-medicating an underlying temporal lobe problem with high-dosemethamphetamine. As I probed deeper into any history of a head injury, whichinitially both Rusty and his parents did not remember. When pressed, Rustyremembered a time when he had been in second grade and had run full speed into asolid metal basketball pole and briefly been knocked unconscious. That couldhave caused his temporal lobe problem. Given this finding, I put Rusty onTegretol (an antiseizure medication that stabilizes activity in the temporallobes). Within two weeks Rusty felt better than heThe Missing Lin\\s Jose's Brain251picture102 [images/picture102.jpg]3-D active side view Note markedly increased cingulate activity (arrow).picture103 [images/picture103.jpg]3-D underside surface viewAt rest; note mildly decreased pfc activity.picture104 [images/picture104.jpg]3-D underside surface viewDuring concentration; note markedly decreased pfc and temporal lobe activity.had in years. He was calmer, his temper was under control, and for the firsttime in his life, he was able to remain gainfully employed. An additionalbenefit of the scan was that I was able to show Rusty the serious damage he wasdoing to his brain by abusing the methamphetamines. Even though the drugs helpedhis temporal lobe problem, they were clearly toxic to his brain. Rusty, likeothers who abuse drugs, had developed holes in activity across the surface ofhis brain. Seeing these pictures was even more incentive to stay away from thedrugs and get proper treatment for his problems. SPECTworked both as a powerful diagnostic tool to better assess one of the rootcauses of Rusty's problem and also as a therapeutic tool to address his denial.A picture is worth a thousand denials. Often, having this type of information isvaluable in helping patients make a more positive move toward sobriety. Iwondered how many people with severe nonresponsive drug problems areself-medicating an underlying problem, yet are labeled by their families andsociety in general as weak-willed or morally defective. \"Tough love\" for Rustywouldn't have solved his problem.4. Cingulate problems, in conjunction with prefrontal cortex and temporal lobeproblems, can exacerbate addictions and potentially violent situations.As mentioned, the cingulate part of the brain is associated with attentionshifting and cognitive flexibility. When it is overactive, people can get lockedinto negative thoughts or behaviors.JoseJose, a sixteen-year-old gang member, was arrested and charged with attemptedmurder after he and another gang member beat another teenager nearly to death.Their gang claimed the color red. One evening, when they were in an intoxicatedstate (from both alcohol and heavy marijuana usage), they approached a boy whowas wearing a red sweater while walking his dog. They asked, \"What colors do youbang?\" (asking him about his gang affiliation). When the boy said he did notknow what they were talking about, Jose replied, \"Wrong answer,\" and he and hiscompanion hit and kicked the boy repeatedly until he was unconscious. Other gangmembers described pulling Jose off the boy because once he had started, hewouldn't stop. They were afraid he would kill the boy.The public defender ordered neuropsychological testing on Jose, which foundfrontal lobe dysfunction and evidence of ADHD, depression, and learningdisabilities. The psychologist suggested a resting and concentration SPECTseries for independent verification. The SPECT series was significantlyabnormal. Both studies showed markedly increased activity in the cingulategyrus, consistent with problems in shifting attention. At rest, Jose's SPECTstudy also showed mildly suppressed prefrontal cortex activity. While he wasdoing a concentration task, there was also marked suppression of theprefrontal cortex and both temporal lobes, consistent with ADHD, learningdisabilities, and aggressive tendencies.Jose had a long history of problems in attention shifting. He was described byothers as brooding, argumentative, and oppositional. \"Once he got a thought inhis head,\" his father said, \"he would talk about it over and over.\" In prison,he was placed on Zoloft (a serotonergic antidepressant to calm his cingulate).He felt calmer, more focused, and less easily upset.5. Drug or alcohol usage may be involved in poor decisionmaking processes orprovocative behaviors that put a person in high-risk situations.It may also decrease a person's ability to accurately perceive a threateningsituation. The probability of aggression between two people is the greatest whenboth are intoxicated and least when both are sober.Jonathan and CarolJonathan and Carol had been married for two years. Both were employed, and theyhad no children. Both drank heavily, and Jonathan also used marijuana andcocaine periodically. From the first month of marriage they had foughtconstantly, mostly over little things. Carol would start complaining aboutsomething over and over again, and Jonathan would react violently toward her.Drinking and drug use made their problems worse. On five occasions the policehad been called to their home by neighbors because of fighting. On the last twooccasions Jonathan had been arrested for striking his wife. Growing up, Jonathanhad had difficulty in school, exhibiting both aggression and learning problems.Carol had grown up in an alcoholic home and had experienced periodicobsessiveness and depression. Through counseling it became clear that substanceabuse increased Jonathan's aggressiveness and impulsivity and made Carol moreirritable and more provoking.As part of a research protocol on difficult couples, Jonathan and Carolunderwent rest and concentration brain SPECT studies. Jonathan's scan showeddecreased activity in his left temporal lobe at rest and marked deactivation ofhis prefrontal cortex when he performed a concentration task (consistent withADHD, aggression, and learning problems). Both of Carol's scans showed markedlyin-creased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, consistent with problems inshifting attention and getting locked into negative thoughts or behaviors.The information from the SPECT studies, along with their clinical history,proved to be helpful. In addition to couples counseling and substance abusetreatment, Jonathan was placed on Depakote (to stabilize his left temporal lobe)and sustained-release Dexedrine (for the impulsivity and ADHD symptoms), andCarol was placed on Zoloft (for overfocus and depressive issues). Over thecourse of treatment, their relationship improved significantly and there were nomore aggressive outbursts.STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVELY DEALING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND VIOLENCEThis chapter highlighted some of the ways that brain dysfunction is intimatelyconnected with violent behavior and substance abuse. Understanding thisconnection is critical to developing more effective treatment strategies andpolicies in dealing with this national problem. Based on this work I offerseveral suggestions:i. Consider the brain. Too often, brain dysfunction is thought of too late inthe evaluation and treatment process. Evaluating brain function through clinicalhistory, neurological exams, and sophisticated brain-imaging studies whenindicated is key to proper diagnosis and effective early intervention.2. Violent individuals and substance abusers should be screened for a history ofhead injuries, since even minor ones can unleash aggressive tendencies(especially when they occur in the left frontal-temporal regions of the brain),and these conditions of the brain can and should be treated.3. Violent individuals and substance abusers should be screened for underlyingpsychiatric and neurological conditions that may contribute to or exacerbatetheir problems (such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, learning disabilities, temporallobe dysfunction, etc.). In Washington state, the criminal court system underJudge David Admire, in conjunction with the Learning Disability Association ofWashington, set up a program for those convicted of crimes to be screened forADD and dyslexia. If they met a high level of suspicion for these disorders onscreening, they were sent through a fourteen-week \"Life Skills\" program to helpthem be more effective in dealingwith these problems. Outcome data presented recently indicated that therecidivism rate had been decreased by 40 percent.4. Do not be shy about obtaining medication for underlying medical andpsychiatric problems when they are present with either substance abuse orviolence. Effective medication is likely to make anger management programs andsubstance abuse treatment more effective. However, in our experience, manysubstance abuse treatment programs and anger management programs shy away fromthe use of medication, and patients are made to feel \"inferior\" for consideringmedication as an option. This attitude hampers appropriate treatment and leavesmany individuals at higher risk for relapse.5. Explore whether victims of crimes may be unwittingly contributing to theirsituation by their own substance use or underlying neuropsychiatric problems. Iknow this is a controversial suggestion, but it is my clinical experience thatsome victims have made bad decisions or exhibited provocative behavior basedeither on their own substance abuse or on their own underlying brain patterns. Iam certainly not suggesting that victims are in any way responsible for whathappened to them. It is my hope that by addressing any underlying problems, theywon't become victims again.6. In complicated cases, brain SPECT imaging may be an adjunctive diagnostictool that can give more information than previously available. In my experience,SPECT can be helpful in the following ways:• by showing cerebral drug damage to abusers to enhance drug treatmentcompliance• by uncovering past brain trauma that may be contributing to the clinicalsituation• by providing help to clinicians in choosing appropriate medications (theseinclude anticonvulsant medications for temporal lobe abnormalities fserotonergic medications for anterior cingulate hyperactivity, and stimulantmedications for prefrontal cortex deactivation. SPECT is not a \"doctorin a box,\" and the SPECT findings always need to be correlated with the clinicalcondition)• by allowing family members and others (judges, probation officers, etc.) tosee the medical contribution to problems so they will encourage appropriatetreatmentThe brain of every individual has a violence \"set point\" determined by a largenumber of interconnected factors: brain system function, genetic factors,metabolic factors, psychodynamic andemotional issues, overall health, history of brain trauma, and the effects ofprescribed medications and abused substances. These factors and their complexinterplay, unique to each person, inhibit or encourage a person's responses toassaults on his or her equilibrium. Any drug—including physician-prescribed—hasan effect on this set point by either increasing or decreasing its reactivity toan insult. The degree of reactivity results from the unique response of anygiven brain to the metabolic changes induced by a chemical. The very short-term,moderately short-term, and long-term changes in brain function, combined withpreexisting factors, result in a greater or lesser propensity for an individualto act on violent impulses.When someone is healthy, he or she has a high degree of control and usuallyneeds intense provocation to elicit a violent reaction. Over time actual changesin brain metabolism as a result of drug or alcohol abuse lead to a diminishedability to regulate aggressive impulses. Finally, a new and lower (more easilytriggered) set point is reached, resulting in more violent, inappropriatebehavioral responses."},{"pageContent":"/ Love You and I Hate You, Touch Me, No, Don't, WhateverBrain Patterns That Interfere with IntimacyOver the past eight years I have conducted a series of SPECT studies on coupleswho have had serious marital difficulties. I have been fascinated, saddened, andenlightened by this research. I now look at marriages and marital conflict in awhole new way, as involving compatible and incompatible brain patterns. I havecome to realize that many marriages do not work because of brain misfires thathave nothing to do with character, free will, or desire. Many marriages orrelationships are sabotaged by factors beyond conscious or even unconsciouscontrol. Sometimes a little bit of medicine can make all the difference betweenlove and hate, staying together and divorce, effective problem solving andprolonged litigation.I realize many people, especially some marital therapists, will see the ideas inthis chapter as radical, premature, and heretical. Frankly, I know of no maritaltherapy system or school of thought that seriously looks at the brain functionof couples who struggle. But I wonder how you can develop paradigms and \"schoolsof thought\" about how couples function (or don't function) without taking intoaccount257the organ that drives behavior. Seasoned therapists who see couples day to dayin their offices will recognize the truths in this chapter, and I hope they willgain new insights into their most difficult cases through the lens of the brain.The stories are real (although I've disguised identifying characteristics toprotect patients' privacy). The problems are real. And the missing link inunderstanding the \"couples from hell\" is often the brain.Mike and Gerry (A Couples Primer)Mike and Gerry had been in marital therapy for four years when they first cameto see me. Their therapist had heard me lecture in their hometown. After mytalk, she'd gone straight to her office, called Mike and Gerry, and told them tomake an appointment to see me. \"Mike,\" she said, \"I think you need to take careof some biological brain problems before we can make any progress.\" This couplehad been in trouble for most of their twelve-year marriage. They foughtconstantly. Mike had had two affairs, seemed prone to pick fights, and had towork excessively long hours because he performed inefficiently. Gerry had atendency toward depression, was angry that their marriage was such a struggle,and would hold on to hurts from years in the past. The therapist had tried allthe techniques she knew. She even went to a conference on \"the resistant couple\"as a way to find help for Mike and Gerry. She was frustrated because shecouldn't make any progress with them.When I first met with them, Mike was the IP (identified patient). The therapistfelt that if she \"fixed\" Mike, they would make progress. Mike, in fact, had ADD.He had underachieved in school. He was restless, fidgety, inattentive,disorganized, and impulsive. He had trouble listening to Gerry. His maritalaffairs had not been planned but impulsive. He tended to seek conflict fromothers and often inflamed situations by making thoughtless comments. In thefirst few meetings with the couple, however, I felt that Gerry also contributedto the marital turmoil. She tended to voice the same complaints over and over.She argued over insignificant things. She had a strong tendency towardrepetitive worry, and when things weren't \"just so,\" she'd be upset for hours.I decided to scan both Mike and Gerry. Mike had markedly decreased activity inhis prefrontal cortex (consistent with ADD symptoms), and Gerry had asignificantly overactive cingulate gyrus (consistent with overfocus issues). Iplaced Mike on Adderall (a brainstimulant to treat his ADD) and Gerry on Zoloft (a serotonergic antidepressantto decrease her tendency to overfocus). Within several days, Mike felt morefocused. He was more organized at work, and he acted in a more positive,thoughtful way toward Gerry. Even Gerry noticed a difference. After severalweeks (Zoloft takes longer to be effective than Adderall), Gerry also felt asignificant difference within herself. Her thoughts no longer tended to loop.She was better able to hold on to positive thoughts. She was more playful, lesseasily set off. Mike and Gerry could spend time together without fightingconstantly. They began to use effectively the marital techniques they hadlearned in therapy.Their therapist was ecstatic to see the couple's progress. She was initiallysurprised that both of them had brain misfires. Although she had at firstattributed the failure solely to Mike, after seeing the brain pictures, she wasstruck by how \"cingulate\" Gerry had been, recalling how she overfocused and hadtrouble letting go of hurts.The missing link for this couple was in their brain pattern and neurotransmitterirregularities. They continued in therapy for several more months to solidifytheir gains. It was important that they really understand the magnitude of thebiological contribution to their problems and that they see each other throughnew eyes. This allowed them to be more forgiving of each other and to heal thepainful memories associated with twelve years of marital struggle. If I hadtreated just Mike and not Gerry, she might very well have stayed stuck in thepain and frustration of the past, seeing herself as a victim of Mike and beingunable to let go of the past.In my work I have seen all of the five brain systems discussed in this bookinterplay within couples. I have found that by properly diagnosing which patternor patterns are present I can develop proper medical and behavioral strategiesto intervene effectively. / want to emphasize that I do not scan every couple Isee. I am often able to pick out these patterns from the clinical presentationand will often intervene based on knowledge without a scan. My hope is that thisbook will help you be more effective in identifying these patterns in yourselfor in those you love and get proper intervention, not a scan. When I have aparticularly resistant couple, I'll order a scan because I want to know whattheir brain patterns look like, especially if there is violence in therelationship.Since, as far as I know, this is the first time any psychiatrist has presented amodel of marital discord based on brain misfires, youmight want to share this book with your marital therapist and see if he or sheis open to new ideas.How do the five brain systems influence intimate relationships? How does oneproblem interact with another? What happens when multiple systems are involvedin one or both couples? Is medication always necessary in this system of maritaltherapy? These are some of the questions addressed in this chapter.Let's start by looking at the relational traits of each brain system when theywork right and when they misfire.LIMBIC RELATIONAL TRAITSWhen the limbic system functions properly, people tend to be more positive andmore able to connect with others. They tend to filter information in an accuratelight and they are more likely to give others the benefit of the doubt. They areable to be playful, sexy, and sexual, and they tend to maintain and have easyaccess to positive emotional memories. They tend to draw people toward them withtheir positive attitude.When the limbic system is overactive, people tend toward depression, negativity,and distance from others. They are more likely to focus on the most negativeaspects of others, filter information through dark glasses, and see the glass ashalf empty, and less likely to give others the benefit of the doubt. They tendnot to be playful. They do not feel sexy, and they tend to shy away from sexualactivity due to a lack of interest. Most of their memories are negative, and itis hard for them to access positive emotional memories or feelings. They tend topush people away with their negativity.Positive Limbic Relational Statements \"We have a lot of good memories.\" \"Let'shave friends over\"\"I accept your apology. I J^now you were just having a bad day.\" \"Let's havefun.\" \"I feel sexy. Let's mahe love.\"Negative Limbic Relational Statements \"Don't loo\\ at me that way.\" \"All I canremember is the bad times.\" \"I'm too tired.\"\"Leave me alone. I'm not interested in sex.\"\"You go to bed. I can't sleep.\"\"I don't feel like being around other people.\"\"I don't want to hear you're sorry. You meant to hurt me.\"\"I'm not interested in doing anything.\"Statements from the Partners of People with Limbic Problems \"She's negative.\"\"He's often depressed.\" \"She lool^s on the negative side of things.\" \"He doesn'twant to be around other people.\" \"She tends to take things the wrong way.\" \"He'snot interested in sex.\" \"She can't sleep.\" \"There's little playfulness in ourrelationship.\"Sarah and JoeSarah's limbic system negatively affected her relationship. She and Joe had beenmarried for five years. They both worked and did not have any children. At theend of the day, Sarah was frequently very tired. Most often she liked to be onher own and didn't want to do anything after work. She usually wasn't interestedin sex, except for one or two days after she started her menstrual cycle. Sarahalso tended to look at the negative side of any situation. Joe complained aboutthe lack of companionship in their relationship. He was very upset by her lackof interest in sex and her nonchalant attitude toward it. He felt she was toonegative, and their lack of connectedness made him feel lonely. Joe tried totalk to Sarah, but she said she didn't have any problems and he just expectedtoo much from her. Joe made an appointment with me. He said, \"I wanted to see ifthere was anything I could do before I saw a divorce attorney.\" I encouraged himto bring Sarah with him to see me. I first got Sarah's reading on the situation.She admitted to feeling chronically tired, overwhelmed, and negative. She justfigured she had a low libido and was destined to live with it. She hadexperienced a major depression when she was a teenager. Her mother had beendepressed, and her parents had divorced when she was five years old. I explainedthe limbic system to her and all about depression. I then placed her on theantidepressant Wellbutrin (bupropion) and saw thecouple in counseling. Over two months, Sarah felt much better. She had betterenergy and more focus, and she also felt more social. In addition, her libidoincreased and she was more sexually receptive to Joe.BASAL GANGLIA RELATIONAL TRAITSWhen the basal ganglia system functions properly, people tend to be calm andrelaxed. They tend to predict the best and, in general, see a positive future.Their bodies tend to feel good, and they are physically free to express theirsexuality. They are not plagued by multiple physical complaints. They tend to berelaxed enough to be playful, sexy, and sexual. They are able to deal withconflict in an effective way.When the basal ganglia are overactive, people have a tendency toward anxiety,panic, fear, and tension. They tend to focus on negative future events and whatcan go wrong in a situation. They filter information through fear and seldomgive others the benefit of the doubt. They tend to have headaches, backaches,and a variety of other physical complaints. They have lowered sexual interestbecause their bodies tend to be wrapped in tension. They often do not have thephysical or emotional energy to feel sexy or sexual, and they tend to shy awayfrom sexual activity. Most of their memories are filled with anxiety or fear.They tend to wear out people by the constant fear they project.Positive Basal Ganglia Relational Statements \"I know things will wor\\ out.\"\"I can speak out when I have a problem. I don't let problems fester.\" \"I usuallyfeel physically relaxed.\" \"I'm usually calm in new situations.\"Negative Basal Ganglia Relational Statements \"I J^now this isn't going to wor\\out.\" \"I'm too tense.\" \"I'm scared.\"\"I'm too afraid to bring up problems. I tend to avoid them.\" \"I cant breathe. Ifeel really anxious in this situation.\" \"I can't ma^e love — I have a headache(chest pain, backaches, muscleaches, etc.).\" \"You're going to do something to hurt me.\"Statements from the Partners of People with Basal Ganglia Problems \"She'sanxious. *HIT* ffties nervous. \"She's uptight.\"\"He cares too much about what others thinly.\" \"He predicts the worst possibleoutcomes to situations.\" \"She complains of feeling bad a lot (has headaches,stomachaches).\" \"He won't deal with conflict.\" \"She won't deal with problemshead-on.\"Ryan and BetsyRyan was a nervous wreck. He tended to see the worst in situations and oftenpredicted failure. He was anxious, nervous, and sickly (frequently complainingof headaches, backaches, and muscle tension). He had been married to Betsy forfifteen years. When they had first been married, Betsy had mothered him, takingcare of his aches and pains and soothing his fears and negativity. She liked tofeel needed. After years of this, however, she had gotten tired of Ryan'swhining and his tendency to be afraid in even the most benign situations. Ryan'sanxiety and medical problems were taking over their relationship. She feltisolated and alone. She became irritable, less understanding, and distant fromhim. Seeing the love go out of their relationship, she made an appointment forme to see them both. Ryan was angry with her about the appointment. Hecomplained that they didn't have the money, counseling wouldn't help, hisproblems were physical and not psychological (actually he was right; this was abasal ganglia problem), and all psychiatrists were crazy anyway (I wouldn't sayall of us are crazy, just a bit odd). When I first saw Ryan and Betsy, it wasclear to me that Ryan's basal ganglia were overactive. The basal gangliahyperactivity was interfering with their relationship. When I explained hisbehavior in medical/brain-physiology terms to Ryan, he relaxed. I helped thecouple with communication and goal setting and then engaged Ryan in his owntherapy. I taught him how to kill fortune-telling ANTs (his were very strong). Iworked with him using biofeedback (teaching him how to warm his hands, relax hismuscles, and breathe diaphragmat-ically). And I taught him self-hypnosis. Ryanwas a very fast learner and quickly soaked up the basal ganglia prescriptions.He no longer used Betsy as his doctor; he began to work with his medical doctorto address his physical issues and started to predict positive thingsrather than fear in his conversations with his wife. Once we treated Ryan'sbasal ganglia problems, the marital therapy became more effective and themarriage improved.PREFRONTAL CORTEX RELATIONAL TRAITSWhen the prefrontal cortex functions properly, people can engage ingoal-directed behavior and effectively supervise their words and deeds. They areable to think before they say things and tend to say things that affect theirgoals in a positive way. They also tend to think before they do things, andtheir actions are consistent with their goals. They tend to learn from mistakesand don't make the same ones over and over. In addition, they are able to focusand attend to conversations, follow through on commitments and chores, andorganize their actions. They are also able to be settled and sit still. They areable to express what they feel. And they tend not to like conflict, tension, andturmoil.When the prefrontal cortex is underactive, people tend to be impulsive in whatthey say or do, often causing serious problems in relationships (such as sayinghurtful things without forethought). They tend to live in the moment and havetrouble delaying gratification (\"I want it now\"). They tend not to learn fromtheir mistakes and to make repetitive mistakes. They also have trouble listeningand tend to be easily distracted. They often have difficulty expressing thoughtsand feelings, and their partners often complain of a lack of communication inthe relationship. It is often hard for people with prefrontal cortexunderactivation to sit still. They tend to be restless and fidgety. In addition,they tend to be especially sensitive to noise, smells, light, and touch. Theyhave difficulty staying on task and finishing projects, commitments, and chores.They are often late. In addition, many people with prefrontal cortex problemshave an unconscious tendency to seek conflict or to look for problems when noneexist. I call this tendency the game of \"let's have a problem.\" They also tendto seek stimulation or indulge in highly stimulating behaviors that upset orfrighten their partner (driving too fast, bungee jumping, getting into themiddle of a fight between strangers).Positive Prefrontal Cortex Relational Statements \"You re important to me. Let'sdo something tonight.\" '7 love you. I'm glad we're together.\"\"I love to listen to you.\"\"I'll be on time for our date.\"\"Letsget these chores done so that we'll have more time together.\"\"I don't want to fight. Let's take a treaty and come bac\\ in ten minutesand work this out.\" \"I made that mistake before. I'm not making it again.\"Negative Prefrontal Cortex Relational Statements \"I'm only a half hour late. Whyare you so uptight about it?\" \"If you want the checkbook balanced, do ityourself.\" \"I'll do it later.\" \"Ifind it hard to listen to you.\" \"Go ahead andtal\\ to me. I can listen to you while I'm watching TVand reading this boo\\.\" \"I can't express myself \"\"My mind goes blank when I try to express my feelings.\" \"I didn't mean to havethe affair (overspend, embarrass you at theparty, make hurtful comments, etc.).\" \"Ijust can't sit still.\" \"The noisebothers me.\" \"I get so distracted (while listening, during sex, when playing agame,etc.).\" \"I need the answer now.\" \"I want it now.\" \"I'm so mad at myself. I'vemade that mistake too many times.\"Statements from the Partners of People with Prefrontal Cortex Problems \"He'simpulsive.\" \"She blurts out and interrupts.\" \"He doesn't pay attention to me.\"\"She won't let me finish a comment. She says she has to say whateverthought comes into her head or she'll forget it.\" \"He has to have the fan on atnight to sleep. It drives me crazy.\" \"She often seems to start a problem for noparticular reason.\" \"He loves to challenge everything!say.\" \"She gets sodistracted during sex.\" \"He teases the animals, and it makes me furious.\" \"Shecan't sit still.\"\"He puts things off and tends not to finish things.\" \"She's always late, rushingaround at the last minute.\"Ray and LindaRay and Linda came to see me on the advice of their marital counselor. Two oftheir three children had been diagnosed with ADD, and the counselor felt thatRay had it as well. Even though Ray owned a very successful restaurant, he wasrestless, impulsive, and very easily distracted. He spent excessive time at workdue to inefficiency, and he had frequent employee problems (often because hehired impulsively without adequate screening). Marital counseling was Ray'sidea, because he saw his wife turning away from him. He told the counselor thathis wife was chronically stressed, tired, and angry. \"She's not the woman Imarried,\" he said to their counselor. In my first session with this couple,Linda clearly explained that it was true; she had changed. It was anall-too-familiar story to me. She had married Ray because he was fun,spontaneous, thrill-seeking (she was actually a bit reserved), and hardworking.She now felt her life had been taken from her. Her ADD children were a handful,and she felt she had no support from Ray. She said, \"When he's home, he's notwith me. He's always working on projects that don't get finished. He stirs upthe kids after I get them settled down. And I can't get him to pay attention tome. He's so restless. When I try to talk with him, I have to follow him aroundthe house.\" In addition, Ray had made several bad financial business decisionsand the family was struggling with debt, despite Ray's successful business. Hehad had an affair several years before they entered counseling, and Linda didn'tbelieve she could trust him. She felt isolated, alone, and angry. There was noquestion in my mind that Ray had ADD. As a child and teenager he had beenrestless, impulsive, hyperactive, and disorganized. He had underachieved inschool and barely finished high school, despite obviously being very bright. Thechronic stress of living in an ADD home was beginning to change Linda'spersonality. She had gone from being a relaxed, happy person to being depressed,angry, and withdrawn. Something had to change. I put Ray on Adderall, astimulant medication, which helped him be more thoughtful, more attentive, andmore efficient at work. I encouraged the couple to continue to see theircounselor to work on healing the hurts from the past. I got involved with thechildren's treatment to make sure they were on the right dosages of medicationand that Ray and Linda used effective parenting strategies (many of Ray andLinda's fights were over disciplining the children). I encouraged Linda to useSaint-John's-wort (the herbal antidepressant discussedin the cingulate prescription chapter) to reset her limbic system back tonormal. Over the next four months, this couple dramatically improved; even thekids noticed a big difference.CINGULATE RELATIONAL TRAITSWhen the cingulate functions properly, people are able to shift their attentioneasily. They tend to be flexible and adaptable. They are likely to see optionsin tough situations. They are usually able to forgive the mistakes of others andtend not to hold on to hurts from the past. They encourage others to help but donot rigidly control situations. They tend to have a positive outlook and see ahopeful future. They are able to roll with the ups and downs of relationships.When the cingulate is overactive, people have a tendency to get locked intothoughts, thinking them over and over. They tend to hold grudges, hold on tohurts from the past, and be unforgiving of perceived wrongs. They tend to beinflexible, rigid, and unbending. They often want things done a certain way(their way), and they may get very upset when things do not go their way. Theyhave difficulty dealing with change. They tend to be argumentative andoppositional.Positive Cingulate Relational Statements \"It's o^ay.\"\"I can roll with this situation.\" \"How would you lihe to do this?\" \"Let'scollaborate.\" \"Let's cooperate.\" \"What would you like to do?\" \"That was in thepast.\"Negative Cingulate Relational Statements \"You hurt me years ago.\" \"I won'tforgive you.\" \"It'll never be the same.\" \"I'm always worried.\" \"I get stucl^ onthese bad thoughts.\" \"Do it my way.\" \"Ican't change.\" \"It's your fault.\" \"Idon't agree with you.\"\"No, No. No.\"\"I won t do it.\"\"I don't want to do it.\"\"I have a lot of complaints about you.\"\"I've never hated anyone more than you.\"\"This will never change.\"Statements from Partners of People with Cingulate Problems\"Nothing gets forgiven or let go.\"\"She brings up issues from years and years ago.\"\"Everything has to be the way he wants it.\"\"He can't say he's sorry.\"\"She holds on to grudges forever.\"\"He never throws anything away.\"\"She's rigid.\"\"If things aren't perfect, he things they are no good at all.\"\"I don't help her because I have to do it exactly her way or she goes ballistic.\"\"He argues with everything I say.\"\"She tends to be oppositional.\"\"He doesn't like to try new things.\"Rose and LarryRose and Larry had been married for twenty-two years. They had been unhappy fortwenty-one of them. I was the sixth marriage counselor they had seen. They werea very persistent couple. Larry had heard me speak in San Francisco at a localconference on children of alcoholics. He said when I talked about problemsassociated with the cingulate gyrus, I was talking about things that affectedhis wife. He bought one of my videotapes and took it home for Rose to see. Rosewas stunned when she recognized herself when I talked about some of my work withcouples who had incompatible brains. She had grown up in an alcoholic home. As ateenager she had also had problems with alcohol and marijuana. As an adult shehad periodic bouts of depression. More damaging to the marriage was herinflexibility: She had to have things a certain way or she'd explode (eventhough she didn't know it and even though she didn't want to be that way). Shewas \"the world's worst worrier\" according to her husband. Her house lookedperfect. \"The president could visit any time of the day or night,\" her husbandsaid. \"I don't know why shecleans so much. It's not like we're dirty people.\" She held grudges. Thingswould get brought up multiple times over the years. If she liked someone, shewas a wonderful friend. If someone rubbed her the wrong way, she would writethat person off and never let go of her anger. She hadn't talked to her ownmother for eighteen years because of a trivial fight one Christmas. Rose neversaid she was sorry. She tended to oppose whatever Larry wanted to do, and theirarguments were frequently over nothing. Larry said, \"We argue just to argue.\"Sex was often an ordeal. The setting had to be just right in order for anythingto happen. \"God help me if I ask for it directly,\" Larry said.When I asked Larry what kept him in the relationship, he said he didn't know. Hehad grown up Catholic and felt it was his obligation to stay. He foundgratification at work and just spent more and more time away. Plus, he felt Rosereally tried. She always set up the counseling appointments, and she wascommitted to staying with him. I was very surprised that no one had sent Rose tosee a psychiatrist. None of her previous therapists had considered the brain tobe an important factor in this couple's struggles. They wanted to help thiscouple with their behavior and never wondered if the hardware that runs behaviorwas working properly. Amazing.Before I tackled this couple, I wanted to see how Rose's brain functioned. Thiscouple had long-term marital dissatisfaction and multiple failures at maritalcounseling. I was betting there were brain patterns interfering with intimacy.As I suspected, Rose had one of the most active cingulates I had ever seen. Nowonder she had so many problems shifting her attention! Her brain's gearshiftwas stuck, unable to shift into new and different modes of thinking. I put heron Zoloft (a serotonergic antidepressant) to help her mood and flexibility. Itaught the couple about how the brain works and how it can interfere withintimacy. I taught them the functions and problems of this part of the brain,along with cingulate prescriptions. In addition, I worked with them ondeveloping a new perspective about their past behavior and healing the memoriesof pain. After four months of medication and therapy, they were much better.They were able to have fun together. Larry was able to ask for sex without fearof rejection. He no longer had to play \"cingulate games.\" He spent more time athome, because the atmosphere was so much more relaxed. Rose called her motherand reconnected with her. Ultimately Rose stayed on Zoloft for three years andthen slowly tapered off. When some of her problems resurfaced, she resumedtaking it.TEMPORAL LOBE RELATIONAL TRAITSWhen the temporal lobes function properly, people tend to be emotionally stable.They are able to process and understand what others say in a clear way. They canretrieve words for conversations. They tend to read the emotional state ofothers accurately. They have good control over their temper. They have access toaccurate memories. Because of their memory, they have a sense of personalhistory and identity.When the temporal lobes do not function properly, people tend to have memorystruggles. They don't have clear access to their own personal history andidentity. They are often emotionally labile (up and down). They tend to betemperamental and have problems with anger. They often have violent thoughts andexpress their frustration with aggressive talk. They often take things the wrongway and appear to be a little paranoid. They may have periods of spaciness orconfusion and misinterpret what is said to them.Positive Temporal Lobe Relational Statements \"I remember what you as^ed me todo.\" \"I have a clear memory of the history of our relationship.\" \"I feel stableand even.\" \"I can find the words to express my feelings.\"\"I can usually tell when another person is happy, sad, mad, or bored.\" \"I havegood control over my temper.\" \"My memory is good.\"Negative Temporal Lobe Relational Statements \"I struggle with memory.\" \"I blowthings way out of proportion.\" \"Iget angry easily. I have a bad temper.\" \"Mymoods tend to be volatile.\" \"I tend to get scary, violent thoughts in my head.\"\"It's hard for me to read.\" \"I often misinterpret what others say.\"\"I tend to be too sensitive to others or feel others are talking about me.\" \"Itend to misread the facial expressions of others.\" \"Ifrequently have troublefinding the right words in a conversation.\"Statements from Partners of People with Temporal Lobe Problems \"He can bephysically or verbally very aggressive.\"\"She's volatile.\" \"His memory is very poor.\" \"She misreads situations.\" \"He'svery moody.\" \"She ta\\es things the wrong way.\" \"He spaces out easily.\"\"She doesn't seem to learn by reading something or hearing directions. You haveto show her what to do.\"Don and ShelleyDon and Shelley had been married for only four years when they sought therapy.Don had a terrible problem with his temper. He had physically abused Shelley onthree occasions and had been charged with felony assault against her. During oneof those times he had been drunk, but during the other two he had not beendrinking at all. Shelley's family and friends thought she was crazy for stayingwith him. Shelley said she loved Don and wanted the marriage to work. She wasafraid when she thought about staying and sad when she thought about leaving,but she knew the violence had to stop. Don was always so sorry after theattacks. He always cried for a long time and seemed truly sorry. When thetherapist learned that Don had had a significant head injury from a motorcycleaccident at the age of seventeen, he suggested that Don see me as part of hisevaluation. Don and Shelley seemed to truly love each other. Don did not have agood explanation for his problems, and he denied that he ever wanted to hurtShelley. \"I just get out of control,\" he said. I found out that Don saw shadows.He had many periods of spaciness. He had difficulties finding the right words.He was very forgetful. He was moody, volatile, and temperamental, and he had oddsensations of deja vu. Don often took things the wrong way, and he thought manyother people were out to hurt him. In Don's motorcycle accident, he had swervedto avoid a deer and fallen against the left side of his helmet. His helmet (withhead inside) had slid for approximately eighty feet. I was convinced he hadtemporal lobe problems (probably on the left), which was confirmed by his SPECTscan. I placed Don on Tegretol (an antiseizure medication) to stabilize theactivity in his left temporal lobe. Within three weeks, he reported he wascalmer, less angry, and less easily agitated. \"It takes much more to get meupset,\" he said. Shelley noticed an almost immediate difference. \"He is morerelaxed. He's calmer, and he's much more mellow. Things don'tupset him like before.\" Their therapist continued to see Don and Shelley forseveral more months and taught them about forgiveness and understanding based onthis new information.It is important to remember that there's no rule that says people get only oneproblem. Some of the toughest couples have multiple system problems in bothpartners. It is always important to consider the brain when thinking aboutcouples who struggle.BETTER RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH BIOCHEMISTRY?One of the underlying messages of this chapter is that many couples struggle notbecause they want to, but because they have underlying brain patterns thatinterfere with intimacy. Sometimes medication can help alleviate these problems.The appropriate medications for each of the brain systems have been discussed inthe chapters on individual brain system prescriptions. I have seen manyrelationships literally saved by the use of medication. Here are severaladditional tips about the use of medication in couples:1. Be aware of when the medications will wear off and be especially cautiousabout conflict then. Some medications, such as stimulants, work for definedperiods of time. If the medication's effectiveness wears off around 8:00 P.M.,do not bring up emotionally loaded topics at 10:30 P.M. Be sensitive to theeffectiveness cycle of the medication.2. Be sensitive to the sexual side effects of medication. Some of themedications we use to treat brain abnormalities can alter sexual function andlibido. Medications that enhance serotonin production in the brain, such asProzac, Paxil, Zoloft, Anafranil, Effexor, and Luvox, often decrease libido ordelay the ability to achieve orgasm. If this occurs, there are strategies yourdoctor can use to counteract these problems, such as adding gingko biloba or theantidepressant Wellbutrin. Talk these problems over with your doctor. Also, letyour partner know that there may be medication side effects and not to take thempersonally.3. Be persistent when medication is required. Too often people will trymedication, then abandon it too early if it isn't immediately effective.Sometimes it takes several trials of medication for prolonged periods of time.Be patient.RELATIONAL THERAPY BRAIN PRESCRIPTIONSIt is clear that using medications is only part of the solution to people'sproblems. Based on my brain-imaging work, I have developed a number of effectivenonmedication brain system prescriptions to help couples. I break them into thedifferent systems we've discussed. Of course, there is overlap between systems,but I think this is a useful way to think about helping couples. The \"Self\"prescriptions here are for those affected by these problems, and the \"Partner\"prescriptions are for the partners of those affected.Limbic Relational Prescriptions for Self1. Spend time together: Bonding is essential to all human relationships. Youneed to spend physical time with your partner. The less you are around eachother, the less bonded or limbically connected you become.2. Smell good: Choose scents your partner likes and wear them. The limbic systemdirectly processes the sense of smell, and it can have a positive or negativeeffect on your relationship.3. Build positive memories: Focus on the times you have enjoyed each other. Thelimbic system stores highly charged emotional memories. When you focus on thenegative in a relationship, you feel more distant from each other. When youfocus on the positive in your relationship, you feel more connected.4. Touch each other: Touch is healing, and couples need to have their hands oneach other. Sexual and nonsexual touching is essential to intimacy. It is likelythat touch cools the limbic system and is involved with the stabilization ofmood.5. Kill the ANTs: Automatic negative thoughts (ANTs) infest and destroyrelationships (see chapter 4). Do not believe every thought you have. Focus onpositive, uplifting, nurturing thoughts about your partner. It makes adifference to your brain function and subsequently affects your relationship.Limbic Relational Prescriptions for Partner1. Don't let your partner isolate himself or herself. Even though isolation is anatural tendency in depression, it makes the situation worse. Encourage activityand togetherness.2. Touch your partner. Back rubs or a touch on a shoulder or hand can be veryreassuring to someone who feels alone. Connectedness is very important.3. If your partner has a loss of sexual interest, do not take it personally.Often depression is accompanied by sexual problems. Work on getting him or herhelp.4. Help your partner around the house, with the children, and so on. Oftenlimbic problems are associated with low energy and poor concentration. Yourpartner may feel overwhelmed and need your help. Many partners, not properlyunderstanding the reality of the situation, become critical and make thesituation much worse. Your partner needs understanding, love, and support, notcriticism.5. Make sure you help get your partner to the doctor if the limbic problemsinterfere with functioning. Limbic problems are often very treatable.6. Take care of yourself. It is stressful to be married to someone who isdepressed. Take time to replenish yourself.Basal Ganglia Relational Prescriptions for Self1. Kill the fortune-telling ANTs: Predicting failure, pain, or an unhappyoutcome often causes erosion in relationships. Clear thinking is essential inrelationships. Do not believe every thought you have.2. Predict the best: Looking to the future in a positive manner is a key tohappiness. Your mind helps to make happen what it sees. People with basalganglia issues have a natural tendency to predict the worst and thus help tomake bad things happen by their predictions. Fight that tendency. When you seegood things happening in your relationship, act in ways to make them even morelikely to happen. Hope for the best.3. Get control of your breathing: Anxiety, tension, and out-of-control behaviorare often preceded by shallow, rapid breathing. Before responding to yourpartner in an anxious or tense situation, take a deep breath, hold it for threeseconds, and then very slowly exhale (taking up to five to eight seconds toexhale). After three or four deep breaths of this type, your brain will befilled with oxygen, you will feel more relaxed, and you will be much more likelyto make better decisions.4. Deal with conflict: Effectively dealing with conflict is one of the keys torelationship health. Whenever couples bury their differencesor put off dealing with conflict, anxiety, tension, and subversive behaviorresult. It is important to develop both negotiation and conflict resolutionskills in relationships (see the basal ganglia prescription chapter). It is alsoimportant to deal with conflict in a kind, respectful manner.Basal Ganglia Relational Prescriptions for Partner1. Help your partner look at the positive side of things. Help him or herpredict good things rather than bad things. Join forces to kill thefortune-telling ANTs.2. Do not get irritated with your partner's anxiety or negative predictions.Soothe him or her with gentle words or a touch.3. Pace your breathing to help your partner's breathing. Often peopleunconsciously mirror their partner. When you breathe slowly and deeply, yourpartner is likely to pick up a more relaxed breathing pattern, automaticallycalming his or her anxiety.4. Encourage your partner to face conflict in an effective way.Prefrontal Cortex Relational Prescriptions for Self1. Focus on what you want: Clear focus is essential to relationships. I havemany of my couples develop a \"two-minute focus statement.\" In this statementthey write down, on one piece of paper, the major goals they have for theirrelationship in the areas of communication, time together, money, work,parenting, and sexuality. Then they post this statement where they will see andread it every day. This helps to keep their behavior on track.2. Focus on what you like about your partner more than what you don't like: Thisencourages your partner's positive behavior. Think about how we train pets. Doyou smack them every time they do something wrong (this will not train them todo anything but avoid you), or do you praise them every time they do somethingright (this encourages new behavior)? Focus on what you like, and you are morelikely to get it. Many couples with prefrontal cortex problems areconflict-seeking as a way to stimulate themselves. Naturally they tend to noticethe problems in their relationships, which makes them more upset andunconsciously gives them stimulation. The problem with focusing on negativebehavior is that you drive the other person away. The negativity kills therelationship.3. Positive stimulation is helpful: Look for new, exciting ways tostimulate the relationship. The prefrontal cortex seeks stimulation. It isimportant to have new, exciting, stimulating experiences to keep therelationship fresh and alive. Look for ways to do new things together, such assharing a hobby, going to new places, or trying new sexual experiences.4. Learn to say \"I'm sorry\": Admitting mistakes and saying you're sorry areessential to relational health. When the prefrontal cortex doesn't work hardenough, people don't have access to good internal supervision, and they may sayor do things impulsively. When that happens, it is important to apologize andlet your partner know you're sorry. Unfortunately, many people aren't good atsaying they are sorry, and they try to justify why they did or said hurtfulthings. Learn to apologize and take responsibility for your mistakes.5. Think about what you say or do before you say or do it: Thoughtfulness andforethought are essential to effective relationships. Before you say or dosomething in a relationship, ask yourself if what you say or do fits with thegoals you have for the relationship. Will your behavior help or hurt therelationship? Supervising your thoughts and actions is essential to relationalhealth.Prefrontal Cortex Relational Prescriptions for Partner1. Do not be your partner's Ritalin: Because the prefrontal cortex seeksstimulation, many partners unconsciously seek stimulation in a negative way.Without knowing it (unconsciously), they try to upset you. They try to get youto yell. They try to make you angry. It is very important if you feel this ishappening to have a calm demeanor. Do whatever you can to not yell or becomeemotionally intense. When you feel as if you are going to blow, take a deepbreath or a break until you can get yourself under control.2. Notice the positive. You change behavior by focusing on what you like a lotmore than what you don't like. Often people with prefrontal cortex problems havelow self-esteem and need encouragement and positive input from those they love.3. Help your partner with organization. Disorganization is often a hallmark ofprefrontal cortex problems. Rather than complain about the disorganization, itis generally much more effective to help your partner become more organized—ifhe or she will allow you to.4. Make the appointment and drive your partner to the doctor. Oftenforgetfulness, procrastination, and denial accompany prefrontal cortex problems.Help may be put off for many years, even/ Love You and I Hate You 2.77when it is obviously needed. Professional help can make a big difference inthese problems, and I often see partners bring their loved ones in forevaluation and treatment. Don't wait for your partner to have the desire, will,or commitment to change; you may wait too long.5. If medication is necessary, help your partner remember to take it. Do not dothis in a condescending way, such as \"Did you take your medicine? Your behavioris way off.\" Instead, help your partner with a gentle (nonsarcastic) reminder,or help your partner come up with a reminder system, such as weekly pillorganizers or calendars.Cingulate Relational Prescriptions for Self1. Notice when you are stuck: The first step in breaking negative cycles is foryou to notice when you are in them. Being aware of repetitive negative patternsof behavior allows you to do something different. Notice these patterns when youhave the same argument over and over and just do something different than youusually would. If you would usually just go on and on trying to make your point,stop and say, \"I'm finished. What do you have to say?\" Then be quiet long enoughto really hear what your partner is saying.2. Take a break when things get hot: When you notice things are getting into anegative \"cingulate\" loop, take a break. When you notice tension in your voice,your body, or your conversation, find a way to distract yourself or take a breakfrom the situation.3. Stop nagging: Nagging erodes a relationship and needs to stop.Nagging—complaining about something over and over—is very common in cingulatepeople. It often has a seriously negative impact on a relationship. When youfind yourself going over the same material again and again, stop it. Beatingsomeone over the head who is not listening to you is ineffective and irritating.Try to find new ways to deal with your frustrations.4. Use good problem-solving techniques: When you are stuck in an impasse, writeout the problem, options, and solutions to the problem. Writing down the issuesthat bother the relationship can often be very helpful. Use the followingproblem-solving model: Write out the issue (such as spending too much money),write out the options and solutions to the problem (spending less, budgeting,cutting up credit cards), and then choose among the options. Writing problemsdown often helps to get them out of your head and out of repetitive relationalarguments.5. Exercise together: Exercise enhances serotonin production in the brain andoften helps a person (maybe even a couple) to become more flexible and lesscingulate.6. Have a carbohydrate snack. Carbohydrates (whole-grain bread, crackers,yogurt, etc.) often improve mood and help cingulate people be more flexible. Lowblood sugar often correlates with anger and irritability.Cingulate Relational Prescriptions for Partner1. Notice when your partner is stuck: The first step to breaking negative cyclesis for couples to notice when they are in them. Being aware of repetitivenegative patterns in your partner allows you to be helpful in the situationrather than inflame it. For example, if you notice your partner is not listeningto you but holding firmly on to his or her own position, take a breath andreally try to listen to your partner. Do something different to break thenegative cycle.2. Take a break when things get hot: When you notice your partner is gettinginto a negative \"cingulate\" loop, change the pace. If you see your partner goingover and over the same territory, or when his or her anger is escalating, find away to distract your partner or take a break from the situation. As I've said,one of the most helpful things I tell people to do is learn how to go to thebathroom when things get hot.3. Deal effectively with nagging. Nagging may be caused by an overactivecingulate, or it may arise because you're not listening to your partner. Whensomeone has repetitive complaints about you, let him or her know you hear whatthey are saying. Ask your partner what steps you can take to make the situationbetter. Also, make it clear that you have heard about the issue and wouldappreciate not hearing about it again. In a kind way, ask what you can do tomake that happen.4. Exercise together: Exercise enhances serotonin production in the brain andoften helps people (couples included) become more flexible and less cingulate.Temporal Lobe Relational Prescriptions for Self1. Use memory helpers to keep the relationship fresh: Reminders can make all thedifference between your partner knowing you care and feeling he or she is notimportant. Given the busy pace of ourlives, we often forget to notice the people who are most special to us. Usenotes, signs, computer reminder systems, ticklers, and so on to keep yourattention focused on making the person you love feel loved. Flowers (limbicsmells), cards, CDs, and loving notes help your partner remember you love andcare for him or her. Temporal lobe partners need constant reminders to keep youlovingly in their memory banks.2. Listen to beautiful music together: Music is healing and often has a positiveimpact on relationships. As we have seen, music can enhance moods and sharpenlearning and memory. Use beautiful music to enhance your connection to yourpartner.3. Move in rhythms together: Moving together helps maintain connection. Dancing,walking hand in hand, and loving are movements that promote bonding in arelationship. They promote connectedness and provide rhythms that help tosolidify memories of togetherness.4. Remember the best times. Develop a positive sense of the history of therelationship. Reread loving cards and letters on a regular basis to maintain anoverall happy sense of the relationship.5. Deal effectively with anger. When you know that you have a temporal lobeproblem and anger is a serious issue for you, practice effective angermanagement strategies. Deep breathing, correcting negative thoughts, and clearcommunication are some anger management strategies that work. In addition, besure to stay away from alcohol and drugs. They can unleash a vulnerable temporallobe, uncorking anger and causing serious problems.6. Know you have a tendency to be extremely sensitive to the behavior of others.Mild paranoia often accompanies a temporal lobe problem. When you feel othersare being negative toward you, check it out. Do not automatically believe yournegative thoughts or feelings. Check them out.7. Protein snacks may be helpful. Often, stabilizing blood sugar with a proteinsnack (cheese, nuts, meat, hard-boiled eggs) helps to settle down the situationcaused by temporal lobe irregularities.Temporal Lobe Relational Prescriptions for Partner1. Do not take this problem personally. Often people with temporal lobe problemsstruggle in relationships because of their negativity, anger, and mild paranoia.Help your partner see situations clearly, but do not take the negativitypersonally.2. Take anger seriously. Sometimes temporal lobe rage can get out of control. Donot escalate the situation when you see your partner is escalating, especiallyif substance abuse is involved. Talk in a soft voice. Take a break. Activelylisten. Offering food may also help. Do not use addictive substances around thetemporal lobe partner. The more you use, the more likely your partner will use.Then things can really get out of control.3. Keep protein snacks around.4. Make sure you help get your partner to the doctor if the temporal lobeproblems interfere with functioning. Such problems are often very treatable.Use these prescriptions to enhance the love in your life. Love makes life worthliving."},{"pageContent":"HELP!When and How to See\\ Professional CareThis chapter will attempt to answer four questions that I am frequently asked:When is it time to see a professional about these problems? What should I dowhen a loved one is in denial about needinghelp? How can I find a competent professional? When do you order a SPECT study?WHEN TO SEEK HELPThis is relatively easy to determine. I recommend that people seek professionalhelp when their attitudes, behaviors, feelings, or thoughts interfere with theirability to be successful in the world, whether in their relationships, in theirwork, or within themselves, and when self-help techniques have not helped themfully understand or alleviate the problem. Let's look at all three situations.As seen in the last chapter, underlying neurobiological problems can trulysabotage relationships. If you or someone you know suffers these problems andthey interfere with the quality of relationships, get help. Often it isnecessary to address psychobiological problems first,281before working on the psychology of the partners. I often use a computeranalogy: you need to first fix computer hardware before it can effectively runsophisticated software. Let's take another look at how each brain system caninterfere with relationships.• \"Depression can cause a person to feel distant, uninterested in sex,irritable, unfocused, tired, and negative. Unless the partners understand thisdisorder, they often have severe relational problems. People who suffer fromdepression have a divorce rate six times higher than those who are notdepressed. •Anxiety causes sufferers to feel tense, uptight, physically ill, anddependent, and to avoid conflict. Partners often misinterpret the anxiety orphysical symptoms as complaining or whining and do not ta\\e seriously the levelof suffering. •Obsessive or overfocus tendencies, as we have seen, cause rigidthinking styles, oppositional or argumentative behavior, holding on to grudges,and chronic stress in relationships. Seeding help is essential to establishing anew ability to relate effectively. •Prefrontal cortex problems, such as ADD,often sabotage relationships because of the impulsive, restless, anddistractible behavior involved. Without help there is a high degree ofrelational and family turmoil. •Temporal lobe problems may be associated withfrequent attacks of rage, angry outbursts, mood swings, hearing things wrong,and low frustration tolerance. I have seen these problems ruin otherwise goodrelationships. These underlying brain problems often need treatment in order forrelationships to heal.The workplace is also affected by underlying and often unrecognized brain systemproblems. If you or someone you know suffers these problems and they interferewith work, it is often essential to get professional help. Addressing theseproblems can literally change the whole atmosphere at work.•Depression can cause people at wor\\ to be negative, unfocused, tired, andunmotivated, and to take things too personally or the wrong way. Such employeesmay negatively affect others' morale and unknowingly skew everyone s perceptionsat wor\\ so they see positive things in a bad light. Depressed people have moresick days than people without depression. •People with anxiety are often tense,physically sic\\, and conflict-avoidant. Their level of anxiety often causes themto be dependent and require too much supervision. Their anxiety tends to beconta-gious, and those around them may also begin predicting negative outcomes tosituations. They can negatively affect a workgroup and tend to be fearful ratherthan hopeful.•Obsessive or overfocus tendencies cause rigid thinking styles, and employers oremployees tend to be more irritable, oppositional, or argumentative. They oftenhold grudges and can be unforgiving, causing long-term workplace problems.•Prefrontal cortex problems, such as ADD, cause many problems at wor\\, includingchronic lateness, inefficiency, missing deadlines, impulsive decision making,and conflict-seeding behavior.•Temporal lobe problems often affect wor\\. I am willing to bet that mostworkplace violence is associated with temporal lobe disorders. More commonly,temporal lobe problems are manifested at wor\\ by mood swings or unpredictablebehavior, low frustration tolerance, misperceptions, auditory processingproblems, and memory problems. The anger, misperceptions, and mild paranoia canwrea\\ havoc in a workgroup.BenLet me give an example of how brain system problems can affect the workplace.Ben was on the verge of being fired. He was frequently late to work,disorganized, forgetful, late on deadlines, and off task. His boss let hisbehavior slide because she felt that Ben had a good heart and wanted to do well.His boss's boss, however, wanted Ben fired. He thought Ben was bad for unitdiscipline and morale. Ben's boss was my patient. I was treating her for ADD.She saw many of her own characteristics in Ben. One day she asked Ben to comeinto her office. She told him her own story, about her problems in school andwith timeliness, organization, distractibility, and procrastination. She toldhim she had ADD and that her treatment had made a big difference for her. Shesaid that her boss wanted her to fire him, but she had convinced him to give Benanother chance. She suggested that Ben seek professional help if he could relateto her story. Ben started to cry. His history was a carbon copy of hers. He haddone poorly in school and had trouble with concentration, organization,completing assignments, and underachievement. He did not expect his boss to careenough about him to try to help. Other employers would just fire him, as theboss's boss wanted to do. Ben came to see me. He had a classic case of ADD. Withmedication and structured therapy, his behavior improved dramatically. His bossandthose higher up in the company saw a wonderful turnaround in Ben. The companysaved money by not having to hire and retrain someone to take Ben's place, andBen was deeply grateful that he was given another chance, along with theinformation he needed to heal. The odds are that he will always be a loyalemployee of this company.All of these brain systems can have a significantly negative effect on internallife, self-esteem, emotional health, and physical health.•Depression (limbic system) clouds a sense of accomplishment (even withincredible accomplishment) and causes intense sadness and internal pain.Depression is not the absence of feeling, but rather the presence of painfulfeelings. Depression is one of the most common precursors to drug abuse andsuicide. Depression often compromises immune system function, leaving peoplemore prone to illness.•The tension and panic associated with anxiety (often a result of basal gangliaproblems) can feel life torture. I have known many patients with panic attackswho become suicidal in hope of escaping their fear. Anxiety is often associatedwith physical tension and an increase in illness. Many anxious peopleself-medicate by drinking alcohol, taking drugs, overeating, engaging ininappropriate sex, and other potentially addictive behaviors.•Overfocus (cingulate) issues cause repetitive thoughts and worries that areoften self-medicated with drugs or alcohol. Internal torture by constant worryis common. When someone says one negative thing, they may hear it in their mindsfive hundred times. They cannot get away from negative thoughts.•People with prefrontal cortex issues, such as ADD, often feel a tremendoussense of underachievement, repetitive failure, and low self-esteem. People withprefrontal cortex issues may use internal problems for self-stimulation and bechronically upset. The stress associated with these problems is oftenaccompanied by increased illness.•Temporal lobe problems can wreak internal havoc. The internal violent moodswings and thoughts often torment the soul. Unpredictable behavior, lowfrustration tolerance, misperceptions, and memory problems are often associatedwith an internal sense of damage. Anger often alienates others, and lonelinessis common.GAINING ACCESS TO YOUR OWN GOOD BRAINThe internal problems associated with these brain system difficulties can ruinlives, relationships, and careers. It is essential to seek helpwhen necessary. It is also critical for people not to be too proud to get help.Pride often devastates relationships, careers, and even life itself. Too manypeople feel they are somehow \"less than others\" if they seek help. I often tellmy patients that, in my experience, it is the successful people who see\\ helpwhen they need it. Successful businesspeo-ple hire the best possible outsideconsultants when they are faced with a problem that they cannot solve or whenthey need extra help. Unsuccessful people tend to deny they have problems, burytheir heads, and blame others for their problems. If your attitude, behavior,thoughts, or feelings sabotage your chances for success in relationships, work,or within yourself, get help. Don't feel ashamed; feel as though you're beinggood to yourself.In thinking about getting help, it is important to put these brain systemproblems in perspective. I tell my patients to get rid of the concept of \"normalversus not normal.\" \"What is normal anyway?\" I ask. I tell my patients who worrythat they are not normal that \"normal\" is the setting on a dryer. Or that Normalis a city in Illinois. Actually, I spoke in Normal, Illinois, at a majoruniversity several years ago. I got to meet Normal people, shop at the Normalgrocery store, see the Normal police department and fire department. I even metNormal women. They were a very nice group, but really not much different fromfolks in California. The Normal people seemed to have all of the problems Imention in this book. I also tell my patients about a study published in 1994,sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, in which researchers reportedthat 49 percent of the U.S. population suffer from a psychiatric illness at somepoint in their lives. Anxiety, substance abuse, and depression were the threemost common illnesses. At first, I thought this statistic was too high. Then Imade a list of twenty people I knew (not from my practice). Eleven were takingmedication or in therapy. Half of us at some point in our lives will haveproblems. It's just as normal to have problems as not to have problems. Again,it is the more successful people who will get help first. The same NIH studyreported that 29 percent of the population will have two separate and distinctpsychiatric diagnoses and 17 percent of us will have three. In my experience,very few people are completely without these problems. In fact, in doingresearch, one of the most difficult challenges is finding a \"normal controlgroup.\"Most of us have traits of one or more brain system misfires. Sometimes theproblems associated with each section are subclinical (they don't get in yourway much), and sometimes they are severe enoughthat they significantly interfere with your life. When they do, it is time toget help. I see many of the problems I treat as medical with significantpsychological and social consequences. This classification is, I believe,accurate, and a lot less stigmatizing for patients.One of the most persuasive statements I give patients about seeking help is thatI am often able to help them have more access to their own good brain. Whentheir brain does not work efficiently, they can't be efficient. When their brainworks right, they can work right. I will often show them a number of brain SPECTstudies to show them the difference on and off medication or targetedpsychotherapy, as a way to help them understand the concept. As you can imagineafter looking at the images in this book, when you see an underactive brainversus one that is healthy, you want the one that is healthy.WHAT TO DO WHEN A LOVED ONE IS IN DENIAL ABOUT NEEDING HELPUnfortunately, the stigma associated with \"psychiatric illness\" prevents manypeople from getting help. People do not want to be seen as crazy, stupid, ordefective, and they often don't seek help until they (or their loved one) can nolonger tolerate the pain (at work, in their relationships, or withinthemselves).Jerry and JennyWhen Jerry and Jenny started to have marital problems early in their marriage,Jenny wanted to get help. Jerry refused. He said that he didn't want to air hisproblems in front of a stranger. It wasn't until Jenny threatened to leave himthat he finally agreed to go for counseling. Initially, Jerry listed manyreasons why he wouldn't go for help: He didn't see that the problems were thatbad; it was too much money; he thought all counselors were \"messed up\"; and hedidn't want to be perceived as crazy by anyone who might find out about thecounseling.Unfortunately, Jerry's attitude is common among men. Many men, when faced withobvious problems in their marriages, their children, or even themselves, refuseto see the issue. Their lack of awareness and strong tendency toward denialprevent them from seeking help until more damage has been done than necessary.In Jerry's case, he had to be threatened with divorce before he would go.rHELP! 287Another factor in Jerry's case was that he had ADD. As a child he had beenforced to see a counselor for behavioral problems at school. He hated feelingdifferent from the other kids and resented his mom for making him talk to thedoctor.Some people may say it is unfair for me to \"pick on\" men. And indeed, some mensee problems long before some women. Overall, however, in my experience motherssee problems in children before fathers and are more willing to seek help, andmany more wives call for marital counseling than husbands. What is it in oursociety that causes men to overlook obvious problems, to deny problems until itis too late to deal with them effectively or until more damage is done thannecessary? Some of the answers may be found in how boys are raised, the societalexpectations we place on men, and the overwhelming pace of many men's dailylives.Boys most often engage in active play (sports, war games, video games, etc.)that involves little dialogue or communication. The games often involvedominance and submissiveness, winning and losing, and little interpersonalcommunication. Force, strength, or skill are used to handle problems. Girls, onthe other hand, often engage in more interpersonal or communicative types ofplay, such as dolls and storytelling. When my wife was a little girl, she usedto line up her dolls to teach them. Fathers often take their sons out to throwthe ball around or shoot hoops, rather than to go for a walk and talk.Many men retain the childhood notions of competition and that one must be betterthan others to be any good at all. To admit to a problem is to be less thanother men. As a result, many men wait to seek help until their problem isobvious to the whole world. Other men feel totally responsible for all thathappens in their families; to admit to a problem is to admit that they have insome way failed.Clearly, the pace of life prevents some men from being able to take the time tolook clearly at the important people in their lives and their relationships withthem. When I spend time with fathers and husbands and help them slow down enoughto see what is really important to them, more often than not they begin to seethe problems and work toward more helpful solutions. The issue is not one ofbeing uncaring or uninterested; it is not seeing what is there.Many teenagers also resist getting help even when faced with obvious problems.They worry about labels and don't want yet another adult judging their behavior.Here are several suggestions to help people who are unaware or willing to getthe help they need:i. Try the straightforward approach first (but with a new brain twist). Clearlytell the person what behaviors concern you. Tell him or her that the problemsmay be due to underlying brain patterns that can be tuned up. Explain that helpmay be available—help not to cure a defect but rather help to optimize how thebrain functions. Tell the loved one that you know he or she is trying to do hisor her best, but unproductive behavior, thoughts, or feelings may be getting inthe way of success (at work, in relationships, or within themselves). Emphasizeaccess, not defect.2. Give the loved one information. Books, videos, and articles on the subjectsyou are concerned about can be of tremendous help. Many people come to see mebecause they read a book of mine, saw a video I produced, or read an article Iwrote. Good information can be very persuasive, especially if it is presented ina positive, life-enhancing way.3. When a person remains resistant to help, even after you have beenstraightforward and given him or her good information—plant seeds. Plant ideasabout getting help and then water them regularly. Drop an idea, article, orother information about the topic from time to time. However, if you talk toomuch about getting help, people become resentful and won't get help, just tospite you. Be careful not to go overboard.4. Protect your relationship with the other person. People are more receptive topeople they trust than to people who nag and belittle them. I do not let anyonetell me something bad about myself unless I trust him or her. Work on gainingthe person's trust over the long run. It will make him or her more receptive toyour suggestions. Do not make getting help the only thing that you talk about.Make sure you are interested in the person's whole life, not just potentialmedical appointments.5. Give new hope. Many people with these problems have tried to get help and iteither didn't work or made them worse. Educate them on new brain technology thathelps professionals be more focused and more effective in treatment efforts.6. There comes a time when you have to say enough is enough. If, over time, theother person refuses to get help, and his or her behavior has a negative impacton your life, you may have to separate yourself. Staying in a toxic relationshipis harmful to your health, and it often enables the other person to remain sick.Actually, I have seen that the threat or act of leaving can motivate people tochange, whether it is about drinking, drug use, or treating underlying ADDor manic-depressive disorder. Threatening to leave is not the first approach Iwould take, but after time it may be the best approach.7. Realize that you cannot force people into treatment unless they are dangerousto themselves, dangerous to others, or unable to care for themselves. You can doonly what you can do. Fortunately, today there is a lot more we can do than eventen years ago.FINDING A COMPETENT PROFESSIONALAt this point, I must get thirty to forty calls, faxes, or e-mails a week frompeople all over the world who are looking for competent professionals in theirarea who think in ways similar to myself and utilize the principles outlined inthis book. Because these principles are still on the edge of what is new inbrain science, such professionals may be hard to find. Still, finding the rightprofessional for evaluation and treatment is critical to the healing process.The wrong professional can make things worse. There are a number of steps youcan take to find the best person to assist you:1. Get the best person you can find. Saving money up front may cost you a lot inthe long run. The right help not only is cost-effective but saves unnecessarypain and suffering. Don't rely on a therapist solely because he or she is onyour managed care plan. That person may or may not be a good fit for you. Searchfor the best. If he or she is on your insurance plan—great. Just don't let thatbe the primary criterion.2. Use a specialist. Brain science is expanding at a rapid pace. Specialistskeep up with the latest developments in their fields, while generalists (familyphysicians) have to try to keep up with everything. If I had a heart arrhythmia,I would see a cardiologist rather than a general internist. I want to be treatedby someone who has seen hundreds or even thousands of cases like mine.3. Get information about referrals from people who are highly knowledgeableabout your problem. Sometimes well-meaning generalists give very badinformation. I have known many physicians and teachers who make light of brainsystem problems, such as ADD, learning disabilities, or depression, anddiscourage people from getting help. One family physician told one of my recentpatients: \"Oh, ADD is a fad. You don't need help. Just try harder.\" In searchingfor help, contact people who are likely to give you good information, such asspecialists in the field, people at major researchcenters, people in support groups about your specific problem. Check outInternet medical support groups. Support groups often have members who havevisited the professionals in the area, and they can give you importantinformation about the doctor, such as his or her bedside manner, competence,responsiveness, and organization.4. Once you get the names of competent professionals, check their credentials.They should have board certification; to become board certified, physicians haveto pass certain written and verbal tests. They have had to discipline themselvesto gain specialized skill and knowledge. Don't give excessive weight to themedical school or graduate school the professional attended to the exclusion ofother factors. I have worked with some doctors who went to Yale and Harvard whodid not have a clue about how to treat patients appropriately, while otherdoctors from less prestigious schools were outstanding, forward-thinking, andcaring.5. Set up an interview with the professional to see whether or not you want towork with him or her. Generally you have to pay for his or her time, but it isworth spending time getting to know the people you will rely on for help. If yousense the fit isn't good, keep looking.6. Many professionals write articles or books or speak at meetings or localgroups. If possible, read their writings or hear them speak to get a feel forthe kind of people they are and their ability to help you.7. Look for a person who is open-minded, up to date, and willing to try newthings.8. Look for a person who treats you with respect, who listens to your questions,and who responds to your needs. Look for a relationship that is collaborativeand trusting.I know it is hard to find a professional who meets all of these criteria and whoalso has the right training in brain physiology, but it is possible. Bepersistent. The right caregiver is essential to healing.HOW CAN I TELL IF I NEED A SPECT STUDY?I order SPECT studies only for very specific reasons. Because of our very largedatabase, I actually order fewer studies now than I did several years ago. Ourextensive SPECT work has given me the clinical experience to diagnose morereadily brain patterns that are responsive to certain treatments. I haveincluded many of these patterns in this book. Here are several common questionsand answers about SPECT.HELP! 291Will the SPECTstudy give me an accurate diagnosis? No. A SPECT study by itselfwill not give a diagnosis. SPECT studies help the clinician understand moreabout the specific function of your brain. Each person's brain is unique, whichmay lead to unique responses to medicine or therapy. Diagnoses about specificconditions are made through a combination of clinical history, personalinterview, information from families, diagnostic checklists, SPECT studies, andother neuropsychological tests. No study alone is a \"doctor in a box\" that cangive accurate diagnoses on individual patients.Why are SPECT studies ordered? Some of the common reasons include:/. Evaluating seizure activity2. Evaluating cerebral vascular disease3. Evaluating dementia and distinguishing between dementia and pseudodementia4. Evaluating the effects of mild, moderate, and severe head trauma5. Suspicion of underlying organic brain condition, such as seizure activitycontributing to behavioral disturbance, prenatal trauma, or exposure to toxins6. Evaluating atypical or unresponsive aggressive behavior7. Determining the extent of brain impairment caused by drug or alcohol abuseIn this book I have listed other examples of SPECT's use, such as in difficultmarital situations. I must emphasize that this is a very sophisticated use ofSPECT and not likely to be found in clinics outside our own.Do I need to be off medication before the study? This question must be answeredindividually between you and your doctor. In general, it is better to be offmedications until they are out of your system before a scan, but this is notalways practical or advisable. If the study is done while on medication, let thetechnician know so that when the physician reads the study, he or she willinclude that information in interpreting the scan. In general, we recommend thatpatients try to be off stimulants at least four days before the first scan andremain off them until after the second scan if one is ordered. Medications suchas Prozac (which lasts in the body four to six weeks) are generally not stoppedbecause of practicality. Check with your doctor for specific recommendations.What should I do the day of the scan? On the day of the scan decrease oreliminate your caffeine intake, and try to not take cold medicationor aspirin (if you do, please write it down on the intake form). Eat as younormally would.Are there any side effects or risks to the study? The study does not involve adye, and people do not have allergic reactions to the study. The possibilityexists, although in a very small percentage of patients, of a mild rash, facialredness and edema (swelling), fever, and a transient increase in blood pressure.The amount of radiation exposure from one brain SPECT study is approximately thesame as from one abdominal X ray.How is the SPECT procedure done? The patient is placed in a quiet room, and anintravenous (IV) line is started. The patient remains quiet for approximatelyten minutes with eyes open to allow his or her mental state to equilibrate tothe environment. The imaging agent is then injected through the IV. Afteranother short period of time, the patient lies on a table and the SPECT camerarotates around his or her head (the patient does not go into a tube). The timeon the table is approximately fifteen minutes. If a concentration study isordered, the patient returns on another day to repeat the process; aconcentration test is performed during the injection of the isotope.Are there alternatives to having a SPECT study? In our opinion, SPECT is themost clinically useful study of brain function. There are other studies, such aselectroencephalograms (EEGs), positron emission tomography (PET) studies, andfunctional MRIs (fMRIs). PET studies and fMRIs are considerably more costly, andthey are performed mostly in research settings. EEGs, in our opinion, do notprovide enough information about the deep structures of the brain to be ashelpful as SPECT studies.Does insurance cover the cost of SPECT studies? Reimbursement by insurancecompanies varies according to your plan. It is a good idea to check with theinsurance company ahead of time to see if it is a covered benefit.Is the use of brain SPECT imaging accepted in the medical community? Brain SPECTstudies are widely recognized as an effective tool for evaluating brain functionin seizures, strokes, dementia, and head trauma. There are literally hundreds ofresearch articles on these topics. In our clinic, based on our experience overeight years, we have developed this technology further to evaluate aggressionand nonresponsive psychiatric conditions. Unfortunately, many physicians do notfully understand the application of SPECT imag-HELP!293ing and may tell you that the technology is experimental, but over one hundredphysicians in the United States have referred patients to us for scans.SPECT RESOURCESThere are not centers like ours around the country. But there are manyforward-thinking physicians and psychotherapists who understand the connectionbetween the brain and behavior.

When thecyst was removed, he returned to his kind, caring, inquisitive self. Insubsequent chapters I have also discussed:•Michelle, a woman who attached her husband with a knife several days before herperiod and who, when treated with Depakote, became her normal, nonviolent self•Samuel, a negative, oppositional ten-year-old who was failing in school andisolated from friends and who, on 10 milligrams of Prozac daily, becamesuccessful at school, at home, and with friends.•Rusty, a man who was arrested four times for assault and failed five drugtreatment programs for methamphetamine abuse and who, since his underlyingtemporal lobe disorder was diagnosed and properly treated, has been able toremain personally more effective as well as gainfully employed.•Sally, a woman admitted to the hospital as suicidal, depressed, and anxious andwho, when properly diagnosed with adult ADD and effectively treated, felt lessdepressed and more focused, and was able to be the mother and wife she hadalways wanted to be.•Willie, a college student who experienced \"minor\" head injuries in two caraccidents and whose whole personality subsequently297changed. He became aggressive and depressed, and nearly filled his roommate.With the proper treatment he was able to return to his funny, happy, effectiveself.•Rob, \"the anger broker of the Valley\" who had severe family problems andsuicidal ideas and actions. On the antiobsessive antidepressant Anafranil, hebecame pleasant, effective, and someone his family wanted to be around.•Linda, a woman who had been raped on two occasions and who suffered fromanxiety, depression, worrying, and drug abuse. With Saint-Johns-wort and EMDRpsychotherapy, her brain normalized and she was able to be much more effectivein her life. •John, a retired contractor, who had been physically andemotionally abusive to his wife during most of their marriage, and emotionallyabusive to his children. At the age of seventy-nine, after a psychotic episodefollowing open-heart surgery, it was discovered that he had had a serious headinjury at the age of twenty that had damaged his left frontal-temporal region.The head injury may have changed his behavior and affected three generations ofhis family. These stories and many others in the book and in my practice havecaused me to question the very essence of who we are. Who are we really? Are wereally who we are when our brain works right? Or are we really who we are whenour brain misfires?I believe, after seeing five thousand SPECT studies (along with the patients andstories that go with them), that we are really who we are when our brain worksright. When our brain works right, we are more thoughtful, more goal-oriented,and more interested in other people. We are kinder, our moods are more stable,and we are more tolerant. Anxiety doesn't rule us, although we have enoughanxiety to get out of bed in the morning and go to work. Even though we may havenegative thoughts from time to time, they do not rule our internal life. Eventhough we may have graphic, violent thoughts, they are not common and we do notact them out. When our brain works right, our spouse may make a mistake, but wedo not hold on to that mistake for twenty or thirty years. We feel sexual, butwe are not ruled by our sexual desires. Our children may still drive us crazy,but we act toward them in a positive, helpful way the vast majority of the time.When our brain works right, we are more able to be who we really want to be.Other questions that this work has stimulated me to ask are: •What choices do wereally have about our behavior? Probably not as many as we thin\\.•Does our relationship with God depend on brain function? Probably it is easierto see a kind, loving, involved God when our brain worlds right. And it isprobably easier to imagine a harsh, punitive God when we have an overactivecingulate and limbic system coloring the world in a negative way. (This willprobably get a few people mad at me —/ am not trying to be conflict-seeding.)•Do we make bad choices as a result of bad training, in defiance of Gods will,as a result of poverty, because of a moral or character defect? Perhaps, butagain, we are more lively to make bad choices when our prefrontal cortex isunderactive as a result of brain trauma or having ADD. Of course this doesn'tmean we cannot ma^e bad choices as a result of bad training, defiance of God,poverty, and the like, but doing so will be more likely when our internalsupervisor is less active than necessary.•Do we ma^ better choices when our brains work right? Of course we do is theobvious answer from this book-•Is our personality a collection of neurons, neurotransmitters, and hormones?Yes and no. Our personality is intimately connected to brain function, but as wehave seen, brain function is also intimately connected to our thoughts andenvironment. They work in a circle and cannot be separated.•What does Mike Tysons brain look l*kf& Did he bite Evander Holy-field's ear inthe heavyweight championship fight in 199J because he wanted to embarrasshimself and seem like an animal? Or did his brain misfire after a head butt anddid his cingulate and temporal lobes consequently go haywire with littleprefrontal cortex supervision? I bet on the latter.•What does Saddam Husseins brain scan look l*kp? What about Adolf Hitlers brainscan?•Should we scan our political leaders? My guess is that we would gain greatinsight into the political process. Odds are President Ronald Reagan's brainwould have demonstrated blood flow patterns indicating Alzheimer's disease inthe early part of his presidency. His forgetfulness became obvious during hissecond term. If we had known about his impending Alzheimer's disease, what then?•Should I scan my son's and daughters' romantic interests? I think so -My k^dsare not thrilled about the idea.The questions could go on and on. The main point is that the brain matters inall we do. The brain is one of the first things we should think about when wetry to understand abnormal behavior. Self-help programs need to consider thebrain. To prevent relapsefrom substance abuse, to cut down on violence in our society, and to curtail thealarming rates of divorce and family discord, we need to think about the brain.Of course, the brain doesn't function in a vacuum—we always need to think aboutthe psychological and social underpinnings of behavior as well—but all behaviorstarts in the actual physical functioning of the brain. Your brain matters."},{"pageContent":"Brain Dos and Brain DontsA Summary of Ways toOptimize Brain Function and Brea\\Bad Brain HabitsBased on my research and that of many other neuroscientists, here is a list ofbrain dos and don'ts to optimize your own brain function and begin to break badbrain habits that hold you back from getting what you want in life.BRAIN DOS:/.

StimulantsIn my opinion these are the first-line medications for treating ADD, especiallyADHD and ADD without hyperactivity, when ADD is the primary problem. They arealso used to treat narcolepsy, help in some postconcussive syndromes, and areused in resistant depression. Our current understanding of these medications isthat they increase dopamine output from the basal ganglia and increase activityin the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes.GENERIC NAMEBRAND NAMEMILLIGRAMSA DAY/ AVAILABLE STRENGTHSTIMES A DAYNOTESmethamphetamine slow-release tabsDesoxyn Gradumets (sustained-release)5-80/ 5>10,151-2ContinuedMILLIGRAMS A DAY/ AVAILABLE TIMESGENERIC NAME BRAND NAME STRENGTHS A DAY NOTESpemoline Cylert 18.75-112.5, 1-2 routine liverup to 150 for adults/ screeningl8 -75>37-5>75 essential• Contrary to popular belief, these are considered very safe medications whentaken as prescribed under a doctor's supervision.• The PDR lists 60 milligrams as the top dosage for Ritalin and 40 milligrams asthe top dosage for Adderall, Dexedrine, and Des-oxyn. Many clinicians, likemyself, feel the range of effectiveness may be much higher for some individuals.• With Cylert it is very important to monitor liver function tests, as 2 to 3percent of people taking this medication may develop chemical hepatitis.• Do not take stimulants with citrus juices (orange, grapefruit, lemon). Theylessen the effect.• Decrease caffeine intake when taking a stimulant. Caffeine and thesestimulants together tend to overstimulate the nervous system.• The common side effects of stimulants tend to be decreased appetite, sleepproblems (if taken too late in the day), and transient headaches orstomachaches.2. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) and Bupropion (Wellbutrin)These medications are effective antidepressants. They tend to decreaseoveractive limbic activity. These medications increase variousneurotransmitters, including norepinephrine (imipramine, desipramine, doxepin),dopamine (bupropion), serotonin (clomipramine), or a combination of these(amitriptyline, nortriptyline). They tend to be more stimulating than the otherslisted. Many of these are now considered second-line medications for depressionbecause they tend to have more side effects than the SSRIs (next section). Yetsome of them also have significant advantages. When depression is mixed withanxiety, imipramine and desipramine may be a better choice. When depression ismixed with ADD, desipramine, imipramine, bupropion, and venlafaxine (see nextsection) seem to be the most effective. Bed-wetting and depression or anxietymay best respond to imipramine. A skilled psychopharmacologist can help you sortthrough these medications.Appendix309• These medications need to be monitored more closely than stimulants,especially their effect on heart function.• Many adults respond to very low doses of these medications for ADD symptoms.This is important because the low doses often produce far fewer side effectsthan the higher \"antidepressant\" doses.• Unlike stimulants, these may take several weeks to a month to becomeeffective.• When Wellbutrin was first released in the United States, a number of peopledeveloped seizures while taking it. It was pulled from the market in the early1980s. The manufacturer figured out that the dosage pattern was wrong, and theFDA allowed it to rerelease it with a different dosage regimen. Do not take morethan 150 milligrams at a time.• These medications are usually not first-line treatments for ADD. I use thesemedications to treat depression, anxiety disorders, bed-wetting, andAppendixthe limbic subtype of ADD, often in conjunction with one of the stimulants.j. Antiobsessive or \"Antistucf( f MedicationsThese medications increase the availability of serotonin in the brain, and theyare often helpful to calm down cingulate hyperactivity. They are typicallymarketed as antidepressants. They also tend to calm down limbic hyperactivity.Except for Effexor, these medications are not first-line treatments for ADD and,in fact, they may make ADD worse. These serotonin-enhancing medications are alsoused to treat eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, oppositionaldefiant disorder, PMS (over-focused type), excessive worrying, temper problemsassociated with things not going a person's way, and other cingulate problemslisted in this book.GENERIC NAMEBRAND NAMEMILLIGRAMSA DAY/AVAILABLESTRENGTHSTIMES A DAYNOTESnefazodone Serzone 100-600 mg/50,100, 150, 200, 250good for depression and anxietyContrary to the negative media attention, Prozac is generally a very safemedication. In our experience, however, people who have temporal lobe problemsmay experience an intensification of angry and aggressive feelings on Prozac orother serotonin-Appendix3 11enhancing medications. Therefore, we are careful to screen for these beforeplacing someone on these medications. If you have side effects on anymedication, it is important to contact your doctor and discuss them.• Unlike stimulants, these may take several weeks to several months in order tobe effective and even three to four months to become optimally effective.• The most common side effect of these medications is sexual dysfunction.Sometimes adding gingko biloba or bupropion counteracts these problems.4. Anticonvulsants or Antiseizure MedicationsThese medications are used to treat temporal lobe dysfunction, seizures,aggression, emotional instability, headaches, resistant depression, and bipolardisorder. They are often very effective in resistant psychiatric conditionswhere all else has failed.GENERIC NAMEphenytoinBRAND NAMEMILLIGRAMSA DAY/AVAILABLESTRENGTHSTIMES A DAYNOTESDilantin30-300/ 1-230, 100monitor blood levels• Tegretol and Depakote/Depakene are used as primary treatments formanic-depressive disorder. Neurontin and Lamictal are now also being used forthis as well.• These are often helpful for people with ADD and violent outbursts or those whohave experienced head trauma.5. Blood Pressure MedicationsThe following blood pressure medications have been used to help with ticdisorders, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, and impulsivity. They are not usuallyhelpful with the attentional symptoms, and they are often mixed with a stimulantmedication when ADD is present.• Clonidine and guanfacine are also used as primary treatments for tic disorderssuch as Tourette's syndrome.• When I use clonidine in addition to a stimulant medication, I order ascreening EKG. There have been several reports that this combination may causeproblems, even though I have found it to be effective and safe.• These medications are also used to treat insomnia, which is very common inADD.6. Combination MedicationsPeople can have more than one problem or more than one brain system involved intheir symptoms. Sometimes one medication seems to be able to treat a number ofproblems, as mentioned above, and sometimes a combination of medications isneeded to obtain full therapeutic benefit.Here are four common combinations of medications I use in my practice.• A stimulant plus an antiobsessive antidepressant (such as Adderall plusEffexor) for patients with ADD plus depression, obsessive-ness, or severeoppositional behavior. In my clinical experience I have seen many people who arechildren or grandchildren of alcoholics benefit from this combination.Frequently, this population presents with cingulate (overfocus symptoms) andprefrontal cortex problems (attentional symptoms).• An anticonvulsant plus an antiobsessive antidepressant (such as Depakote plusZoloft) for patients with temper problems and excessive worrying or depression.• A blood pressure medication, plus a stimulant and an antiobsessiveantidepressant (such as Catapres, Adderall, plus Effexor) for patients withTourette's syndrome, ADD, and OCD.• A tricyclic antidepressant plus a blood pressure medication (such as Tofranilplus Inderal) for patients with depression, anxiety, and hand tremors in socialsituations."},{"pageContent":"BibliographyAbdel-Dayem HM, Abu-Judeh H, Kumar M, Atay S, Naddaf S, El-Zeftawy H, Luo JO:SPECT brain perfusion abnormalities in mild or moderate traumatic brain injury.Clin.
