Your brain decides who is attractive to you, how to get a date, how wellyou do on the date, what to do with the feelings that develop, how long thosefeelings last, when to commit, and how well you do as a partner and a parent.Your brain helps you be enthusiastic in the bedroom or drains you of desire andpassion. Your brain helps you process and learn from a breakup or makes youvulnerable to depression or obsession. When the brain works right, it helps yoube thoughtful, playful, romantic, intimate, committed, and loving with yourpartner. When the brain is dysfunctional, it causes you to be impulsive,distracted, addicted, unfaithful, angry, and even hateful, thus ruining chancesfor continued intimacy and love.Your brain is also the seat of orgasms. Some research implicates the righthemisphere of the brain. In fact, certain forms of epilepsy, especially thosefound in the right temporal lobe, have been associated with spontaneous orgasms.In one case from Taiwan, a forty-one-year-old woman had seizures that wereinduced only when she brushed her teeth. The seizure started with the feelingsof being sexually aroused, then she felt an orgasmlike euphoria wash over her,which was followed by feelings of confusion. Her brain-imaging studies showedproblems in the right temporal lobe, an area that has been associated with bothorgasms and religious experience. When someone has orgasmiclike feelings whenbrushing her teeth, odds are that she will have very clean pearly whites.Scientists agree that the brain is the organ of behavior; as such, it really isthe largest sex organ in the body (about three pounds), and in this case sizereally does matter. Our brain becomes less and less active and decreases inoverall size as we age. This is true for males and females and there appears tobe an equal loss of gray matter (nerve cell bodies) and white matter (theconnections between nerve cells). If you learn to take care of your brain,however, it can be active and healthy throughout your life. With targetedinterventions, you can impact brain health, lose less brain tissue, and keepyour brain healthy well into your elderly years.Why does this matter to sexual function? As the brain dims in activity over thedecades, so, too, does many people’s sexual function. The two go together. Inmen between the ages of forty and seventy studied over a nine-year period, therewas a significant decline in sexual function with age. This is consistent withpast studies that have shown a decline in sexual desire, intercourse, anderection frequency. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is very common and increases withage. Forty percent of men in their forties, and 70 percent in their seventieshad problems. In women, aging and menopause often negatively affect sexualinterest and performance.A major reason underlying both sexual and brain dysfunction is decreased bloodflow. Blood does so many important things. It brings oxygen, sugar, andnutrients to your cells and it takes away waste products. Anything thatinterferes with healthy blood flow will impair an organ’s functioning. Decreasedblood flow to genitals from hypertension; vascular disease; diabetes; toxicexposure, such as drug abuse or smoking; physical trauma; and other causesimpairs sexual function. Increased blood flow, from targeted interventionsincluding exercise, ginkgo, and compounds that increase nitric oxide, such asViagra and ginseng, improves function and reverses aging.Likewise, decreased blood flow to your brain, from any cause, decreases brainfunction, which means you are likely to make impaired decisions and subsequentlyhave less sex. Few scientists have looked at the connection between brain healthand sexual behavior. That’s where I come in. My primary work is as abrain-imaging specialist. I have been doing imaging work for more than sixteenyears and my clinics have the world’s largest database of scans related tobehavior, more than 35,000. We look at the brain on a daily basis using asophisticated study called SPECT imaging. SPECT stands for “single photonemission computed tomography,” a nuclear medicine study that evaluates bloodflow and activity patterns in the brain. We have looked at many healthy brainsand brains in trouble. We have looked at the brains of children, teenagers,adults, and the elderly. We have looked at brains on medications, drug andalcohol abuse, supplements, prayer and meditation, gratitude, and a wide varietyof psychological and biological treatments. We have looked at the brain in love,lust, commitment, divorce, domestic violence, sexual abuse, and loss.At our clinics, our primary work is to help maximize people’s brain function forthe most satisfying and healthy life possible. We help healthy people who wantto improve their own brain function, as well as treat attention deficitdisorders (ADD), mood and anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders,addictions, temper problems, and memory disturbances. We often help individualsand couples who struggle with relationship and sexual problems of all kinds. Itis really possible to dramatically improve brain function, whether your brain istroubled or not, and thus dramatically improve your life. Our guiding principlefor the past sixteen years has been “Change your brain, change your life.”Since most people cannot see the brain, it is often left out of the equations ofour lives. Yet, it is at the core of our personal universe. Connecting sex andthe brain through the lens of brain imaging has been one of the most fascinatingjourneys of my life, and I will share it with you in this book. I became muchmore effective in helping couples when I started looking at their relationshipsand sexuality together with brain function. It is clear that healthy brainfunction is associated with more loving and sexual relationships, while poorbrain function is associated with more fighting, less sex, and higher divorcerates. In committed relationships, sex is a critical ingredient for health andlongevity, but most people never connect the brain and sex.I start with a clear bias: Sex is best in the context of a committed, lovingrelationship. Anthropologist Helen Fisher writes, “Do not copulate with peopleyou do not want to fall in love with, because you might do just that.” Sex bondsyou to others, and in some cases, if you are not careful and thoughtful, it canput you in bondage to others. Although this is my bias, it is not always thecontext of some of the research studies I will share with you on the sexualbenefits for health and longevity, which are based solely on sexual frequency.Having acknowledged that fact, there are other studies that strongly suggest ahappy marriage is also associated with longevity, which usually means notsharing yourself sexually outside your primary relationship. The discussionthroughout the book is on heterosexual relationships, but the same principlesapply to all committed, loving relationships.Based on my latest research, this book will share twelve practical neurosciencelessons to enhance your love and sex life. Practical neuroscience is a term Icoined for the study of applying the latest brain research to everyday life. Iam the type of person, like many of you, who always wants to know why I shouldlearn something. If it isn’t practical or helpful, then I don’t want to expendgreat amounts of neuronal effort on it. The reason to study neuroscience is thatit is immensely practical. Here’s an example:On a recent faculty retreat with the University of California, Irvine Departmentof Psychiatry, where I teach psychiatric residents, I was walking back fromdinner through a shopping district along the quaint cobblestone streets ofTaormina, Sicily, with one of my colleagues and his wife. They were talkingabout buying shoes. The wife wanted her husband to go with her to the shoeboutique and he was balking a bit. I looked at him and said, “You want to gowith her.” He gave me a quizzical look which said, “Why?”I replied, “In the brain, the sensory area of the foot is right next door to thesensory area for the clitoris. Unknowingly, women often feel that buying shoesis like foreplay. Feet are one of the best ways to a woman’s affections.”With my friend’s help, his wife bought three pairs of shoes the next day. He hada smile on his face for the rest of the trip."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_004_r1.jpg]METHUSELAH’S SECRETimage [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_005_r1.jpg]Sexuality, Longevity, Health, and Happiness“Sex . . . what else is free, fun, low calorie, and exercise?”—BARBARA WILSON, MD, neurologist and pain specialistIn August 1982, during my internship year on the sterile surgical floor at theWalter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., Jesse was discharged fromthe hospital. He had been admitted for an emergency hernia operation two weeksearlier and there had been some minor complications. I remember Jesse so vividlynow because he was one hundred years old, but talked and acted like a man thirtyyears younger. Mentally, he seemed every bit as sharp as any patient I hadtalked to that year or since. He and I developed a special bond, because unlikethe surgery interns who spent a maximum of five minutes in his room each day, Ispent hours over the course of his hospitalization talking to him about hislife. The other interns were excited to learn about the latest operatingtechniques. I was interested in Jesse’s story and I wanted to know about Jesse’ssecrets for longevity and happiness.Jesse had his hundredth birthday in the hospital and it was quite an event. Hiswife, actually his second one, who was three decades younger, planned the eventwith the nursing staff. There was great love, playfulness, and physicalaffection between Jesse and his wife. Clearly, they still had the “hots” foreach other.Just before his discharge from the hospital, he saw me at the nurses’ stationwriting notes. He enthusiastically waved me over to his room. His bags werepacked and he was dressed in a brown suit, white shirt, and a blue beret. Helooked deeply into my eyes as he quietly asked me, “How long, doc?”“How long what?” I answered.“How long before I can make love to my wife?”I paused and he continued in a hushed voice, “You want to know the secret tolive to a hundred, doc? Never miss an opportunity to make love to your wife. Howlong should I wait?”A slow smile came over my face, “I think a week or so and you should be fine. Begentle at first.” Then I gave him a hug and said, “Thank you. You have given mehope for many years to come.”Science finally caught up to Jesse twenty-five years later. Now there is awealth of research connecting healthy sexual activity to longevity. The lessonfrom Jesse still rings true today. While there are many ingredients to a longlife—good genes, a positive outlook, a curious mind, and exercise—frequentsexual activity is one of them, too.Like Jesse, Methuselah knew the secret, too. The oldest living Hebrew patriarchmentioned in the Bible, Methuselah was 187 years when his son Lamech was born.According to the author of the book of Genesis, he lived another 782 years,dying at the remarkable age of 969. Since then the name Methuselah has become asynonym for longevity; in this chapter I will illustrate what I considerMethuselah’s Secret—the link between sexual frequency, sexual enjoyment, andlongevity.Can Ten Thousand Men Be Wrong?Why do we have sex on the brain? Why is it the topic of so many conversations?From a scientific perspective, the answer is simple. More than any other basicneed, sexual activity makes it possible for us to live beyond ourselves and forour species to survive. It is one of the most powerful drives motivatingbehavior. Yet, with the changing gender roles in our society and the constantmix of religious and cultural messages, sex has become confusing andfrustrating. Is sex good? Is it bad? Is it important? Is it a luxury forpleasure or just a means of having children? New research shows that sex isimportant, not only to the physical survival of the human race, but to thesurvival of individuals as well. Sex is a natural part of being alive, of beinghuman; it is healthy to want to express yourself in that way. Having a healthy,satisfying sex life is important for each person individually, but also to thehealth of romantic relationships.Sexual interest, activity, and meaning change throughout the lifespan. Teenagersexplore a new, exciting, confusing, and potentially risky (pregnancy and STDs)part of life. While young adults attempt to develop a sense of sexualcompetency, older people strive more for a sense of meaning in their sexuallives. Underlying most sexual contact is a desire for pleasure, release, andemotional connection.Toward the end of Chuck’s marriage, he was in bed reading Dean Ornish’s bookLove and Survival. In the book Dr. Ornish wrote about a study where ten thousandmen were asked one question: “Does your wife show you her love?” The men whoanswered no, in significant numbers, died earlier. “Oh my God,” Chuck thought,“I’m doomed.” He had been in a twenty-year marriage where their libidos werebadly matched, and he was turned away nine times out of ten. At 3 A.M. thatmorning he awoke with crushing chest pain. His heart checked out okay the nextday, but he knew that something had to change. His life might depend on it.Withholding sex, as a weapon of control or punishment, is common inrelationships for both males and females. I have seen it in my practice fortwenty-five years. Unfortunately, it is a deadly weapon and often killsrelationships. After reading this chapter and understanding the researchassociated with frequent sexual activity and sexual enjoyment, my hope is thatyou will honor sex in your life. If you are someone who withholds sex as a wayto punish your partner, my hope is that you will realize two things: One, theact of withholding physical affection is actually bad for you, as you miss outon its many benefits; and two, it puts your partner’s health at risk. Nokidding. I often joke in my lectures that if your partner knew the research, andyou were withholding sex, he or she could potentially sue you for attemptedmurder. There is a lot of nervous laughter at this point. Of course, there areother reasons besides their partner withholding sex that people are not gettingit, such as they are without a partner, there is an illness that affects sexualdesire or performance, or people may be uncomfortable with their bodies.Most of the research discussed here on the health benefits of sex involvessexual activity with a partner. Some of the research, however, has to do withorgasm frequency, which may also be due to masturbation. Sexual gratification orrelease through masturbation may be helpful for the brain. From a psychiatricstandpoint, it is a complex issue. Masturbation can bring on a release oftension, but in some vulnerable people can also lead to excessive or addictiveactivity.Healing: Sex Is the Best MedicineMany studies have investigated the relationship between sexual activity andphysical health. The potential dangers of sexual activity, including sexuallytransmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancies, have been widely reported, andrightly so. However, less publicized studies suggest that thoughtful sexualactivity with a committed partner improves well-being by enhancing longevity,immune system function, joy, pain management, and sexual and reproductivehealth. These studies illustrate that sexual activity may be a preventivemeasure against the two leading causes of death in the United States, heartdisease and cancer. Below are some of the aspects of your health that sex canimprove.LongevityLearning how to enhance the largest sex organ in the body (the brain) and usingit well to intimately connect with others may add years to your life and islikely to make you much happier. Serious research on sexuality began in theUnited States in the 1940s by Alfred Kinsey. He reported that sex reducesstress, and that people who have fulfilling sex lives are less anxious, lessviolent, and less hostile. Current research bears this out, as physical touchincreases the hormone oxytocin, which boosts trust and lowers cortisol levels,the hormone of chronic stress. In a study done at Duke University, researchersfollowed 252 people over twenty-five years to determine the lifestyle factorsimportant in influencing lifespan. Sexual frequency and past and presentenjoyment of intercourse were three of the factors studied. For men, frequencyof intercourse was a significant predictor of longevity. While frequency ofintercourse was not predictive of longevity for women, those who reported pastenjoyment of intercourse had greater longevity. This study suggested a positiveassociation between sexual intercourse, pleasure, and longevity.A 1976 report in Psychosomatic Medicine concluded that an inability to reachorgasm may have a negative impact on women’s hearts. Only 24 percent of women inthe healthy control group reported sexual dissatisfaction; while 65 percent ofthe women who had heart attacks reported trouble with sex. In this study, thetwo most common causes of dissatisfaction in women were due to impotence andpremature ejaculation on the part of their husbands. Sexual health is not justan individual issue. It affects both parties’ satisfaction and overall health.A Swedish study found increased risk of death in men who gave up sexualintercourse earlier in life. The research was done on four hundred elderly menand women. At age seventy they were given a survey of their sexual activity andthen followed over time. Five years later the death rates were significantlyhigher among the men who ceased sexual activity at earlier ages.A daring group of researchers from Queen’s University in Belfast, Ireland,included in a long-term study of health a question about sexual activity. Theauthors studied nearly one thousand men between the ages of forty-five tofifty-nine living in or near Caerphilly, Wales, and recorded the frequency ofsexual intercourse each week and month. The researchers then divided the meninto three groups: high orgasm frequency (those who had sex twice or more aweek), an intermediate group, and low orgasm frequency (those who reportedhaving sex less than monthly). The men were monitored again ten years later.Researchers found that the death rate from all causes for the least sexuallyactive men was twice as high as that of the most active group. The death rate inthe intermediate group was 1.6 times greater than for the active group.Many questions come to mind with this type of study, such as “Is it the orgasmthat is healing? Or, the touch and physical and emotional connection that comeswith intercourse? Does poor health decrease sexual activity? Do other factorssuch as lack of exercise, alcohol, and depression cause both poor health andless sexual activity?” The researchers found that the robustness of theirfindings persisted even after adjusting for differences in age, social class,smoking, blood pressure, and evidence of existing coronary heart disease at theinitial interview. This suggests a more likely protective role of sexualactivity.The Irish researchers wrote, “The association between frequency of orgasm andmortality in the present study is at least—if not more—convincing onepidemiological and biological grounds than many of the associations reported inother studies and deserves further investigation to the same extent.Intervention programs could also be considered, perhaps based on the exciting,‘At least five a day’ campaign aimed at increasing fruit and vegetableconsumption—although the numerical imperative may have to be adjusted.”In a 2001 follow-up study, this same research group found that having sex threeor more times a week reduced by half the risk in males of having a heart attackor stroke. If a drug company came up with a medicine that performed as well,their stock would soar through the roof of Wall Street. The coauthor of thestudy, Shah Ebrahim, PhD, underscored the results by saying, “The relationshipfound between frequency of sexual intercourse and mortality is of considerablepublic interest.” There is truth to the saying that an apple a day keeps thedoctor away. It may also be true that an orgasm a day keeps the coroner away.Fewer Sick DaysA study from the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality conducted byDr. Ted McIlvenna looked at the sex lives of ninety thousand American adults. Hefound that sexually active people take fewer sick leaves and enjoy life more.Boosted ImmunityAccording to gynecologist Dr. Dudley Chapman, orgasms boost infection-fightingcells up to 20 percent. Psychologists at Wilkes University in Pennsylvania foundthat students who had regular sexual activity had a third higher levels ofimmunoglobulin A (IgA), an antibody that boosts the immune system and can helpfight colds and flu.Healthy Sexual and Reproductive BehaviorResearch done by Dr. Winnifred Cutler, a specialist in behavioral endocrinology,indicated that women who have intercourse with a male partner at least once aweek are likely to have more regular menstrual cycles than women who arecelibate or who have infrequent sex. In same-sex couples, women who engaged insexual activity at least three times per week also had more regular cycles. Inher “White Paper for Planned Parenthood,” Dr. Cutler reported that sexual andreproductive health of both women and men is influenced by their sexualactivity. She reports that regular sex can have positive effects also onreproductive health. Here are several examples: Fertility. Frequent sexual activity may enhance fertility. Studies of menstrualcycle variability and frequency of intercourse have demonstrated that regularintimate sexual activity with a partner promotes fertility by regulatingmenstrual patterns. Menstrual Cycle Regularity. A series of studies found that women who engaged inintercourse at least once per week had cycle lengths that were more regular thanwomen who had sex sporadically or who were celibate. Relief of Menstrual Cramps. Nine percent of nineteen hundred women stated thatthey masturbated in the previous three months to relieve menstrual cramps. Pregnancy. A review of fifty-nine studies that were written between 1950 and1996 concluded that sexual activity during pregnancy does not harm the fetus, aslong as there are no other risk factors, such as sexually transmitted diseases,involved. In addition, some research has shown that sexual activity throughoutpregnancy may serve as a protection against early delivery, especially duringthe third trimester (between the twenty-ninth and thirty-sixth weeks). Of morethan eighteen hundred women, excluding those who could not have sex for medicalreasons, preterm delivery was significantly reduced in the women who hadintercourse late in their pregnancy. Healthy Prostate. The prostate gland is responsible for producing some of thesecretions in semen. Sometimes the prostate becomes inflamed and painful(prostatitis). In single men who had prostatitis, more than 30 percent whomasturbated more frequently reported marked or moderate improvement of theirsymptoms. In addition, there is a suggestion that frequent ejaculation may helpprevent chronic nonbacterial infections of the prostate.Higher Youth Hormone Levels (DHEA, Estrogen, and Testosterone)Dr. Cutler also reported that women who enjoy regular sex had significantlyhigher levels of estrogen in their blood than women experiencing eitherinfrequent sex or no sex at all. The benefits of estrogen include a healthycardiovascular system, lower bad cholesterol, higher good cholesterol, increasedbone density, and smoother skin. There is also growing evidence that estrogen isbeneficial to brain functioning.Another important hormone that seems to be affected by sexual activity is DHEA.Before orgasm the level of DHEA spikes in the body to several times higher thannormal. DHEA is believed to improve brain function, balance the immune system,help maintain and repair tissue, promote healthy skin, and possibly improvecardiovascular health.Testosterone is increased through regular sexual activity. Testosterone can helpstrengthen bones and muscles, and is also beneficial to a healthy heart andbrain. The risk for Alzheimer’s disease is twice as high for people with lowertestosterone levels. Low testosterone levels are also associated with a lowlibido. From this connection one could infer that if you are not interested insex, your memory may be in jeopardy as well.Potential Cancer PreventionA study conducted by Graham Giles from Australia concluded the more that menbetween the ages of twenty and fifty ejaculate, the less likely they are todevelop prostate cancer. A study published by the British Journal of UrologyInternational asserted that men in their twenties can reduce by a third theirchance of getting prostate cancer by ejaculating more than five times a week.Researchers have suggested that sexual expression may lead to a decreased riskof cancer because of the increase in levels of oxytocin and DHEA, which areassociated with arousal and orgasm in women and men. A 1989 study foundincreased frequency of sexual activity was correlated with a reduced incidenceof breast cancer among women who had never had a child. The study examinedfifty-one French women who were diagnosed with breast cancer less than threemonths prior to the interview. They were matched with ninety-five controls. Ahigher risk of breast cancer also correlated with a lack of a sex partner andrare sexual intercourse, defined as less than once a month.More Restful SleepSexual release can help people go to sleep. Orgasm causes a surge in oxytocinand endorphins that may act as a sedative. One study found that 32 percent of1,866 U.S. women who reported masturbating in the previous three months did soto help go to sleep. As most women know, men often go to sleep shortly afterhaving sex.Pain ReliefStudies have shown that orgasms can help treat some types of pain. Research byBeverly Whipple and Barry Komisaruk of Rutgers University found that throughregular orgasm women had higher pain thresholds when suffering from conditionsranging from whiplash to arthritis. Immediately before orgasm, levels of thehormone oxytocin surge to five times their normal level. This in turn releasesendorphins, which alleviate the pain. In women, sex also promotes the productionof estrogen, which can reduce the pain of PMS.Dr. Whipple’s research identified the female G-spot, the vaginal “on switch” forfemale arousal, on the front inside wall of the vagina, opposite the clitoris.She showed that gentle pressure to this area raised pain thresholds by 40percent and that during orgasm women could tolerate up to 110 percent more pain.In brain-imaging research to understand this finding, Dr. Whipple found thatduring peak arousal, the pain-killing center deep in the brain is activated.Signals from this part of the brain give orders to the body to releaseendorphins and corticosteroids. These chemicals help to temporarily numb thepain from many different causes. Activating this region also has a calmingeffect and can reduce anxiety. See Lesson Nine for more details on the G-spot.Migraine ReliefResearch suggests that when your partner says, “Not tonight, honey, I have aheadache,” you can help her with a loving roll in the sack. A study from theSouthern Illinois University School of Medicine found that having an orgasmcould help alleviate the pain from migraines. Among fifty-two migrainesufferers, sixteen reported considerable relief after an orgasm and anothereight had their headaches completely gone. Since 2001, a couple of case studiesreported that orgasm did help with pain relief. An earlier study of eighty-threewomen who suffered from migraine headaches showed that orgasm resulted in atleast some relief for more than half of them. Using orgasm to help alleviatemigraine pain is not as reliable as prescription medications, but it does workmuch faster, is cheaper, has fewer side effects, and is more fun.Depression TreatmentOrgasms can also have an antidepressant effect. Orgasms cause intense increasedactivity in the deep limbic parts of the brain, which settle down after sex.Antidepressants tend to calm activity in the limbic parts of the brain as well.People who engaged in regular sexual activity experienced less depression;orgasm frequency may be one reason why. When a man has an orgasm, an area in thelimbic system, called the meso-diencephalic junction, is activated. Cells in theregion are known to produce some of the pleasure chemicals discussed earlier. Atthe same time, researchers have shown that the amygdala, a fear center in thebrain, becomes less active in men’s brains during sex. The region is alsoinvolved in vigilance, so animals and people may need to shut down that part ofthe brain to avoid getting distracted during sex. Calming the fear center mightalso help with a man’s sense of commitment. Prostaglandins, fatty acids found insemen, are absorbed by the vagina and may have a role in modulating femalehormones and moods. In one study it was reported that women who perform oral sexon their mates are less likely to suffer from preeclampsia, a condition thatcauses a dangerous spike in women’s blood pressure during pregnancy. Plus, spermcarries TGF beta, a molecule that can boost the activities of her natural killercells, which attack the rogue cells that give rise to tumors.A man’s orgasm can even be beneficial to women, according to research thatindicates that semen can reduce depression in women. Gordon Gallup, apsychologist at the State University of New York, headed a study that foundwomen whose male partners did not use condoms were less subject to depressionthan those whose partners did. One theory put forth was that prostaglandin, ahormone found in semen, may be absorbed in the female genital tract, thusmodulating female hormones.Other research has indicated that high sexual activity is associated with lowerrisk and incidence of depression and suicide. A Canadian study that examined thecorrelation between sexuality and mental health found that celibacy wascorrelated with high scores on depression and suicidality indexes.Look YoungerRegular orgasms can even help you look younger. According to research done byDavid Weeks, a clinical neuropsychologist at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital,making love three times a week in a stress-free relationship can make you lookten years younger. Dr. Weeks studied more than 3,500 men and women between theages of 18 and 102. He concluded that genetics were only 25 percent responsiblefor how young we look—the rest is due to behavior. In his study, a panel ofjudges viewed the participants through a one-way mirror and then guessed the ageof each subject. A group of men and women were labeled “superyoung” whose ageswere underestimated by seven to twelve years. Among these “superyoung” people,one of the strongest correlates of youthful appearance was an active sex life.They reported having sex at least three times per week, in comparison with thecontrol group’s average of twice a week. The “superyoung” were also found to bemore comfortable and confident regarding their sexual identity. Dr. Weeks, whosefindings are published in Superyoung: The Proven Way to Stay Young Forever(Hodder and Stoughton), says this is partly because sexual activity in womenhelps to trigger the production of a human growth hormone that helps themmaintain their youthful looks. Sexual activity also pumps oxygen around thebody, boosting the circulation and the flow of nutrients to the skin. Moreover,being in a sexual relationship can in itself be a good incentive to look afteryour appearance and stay in shape.Improved Sense of SmellAfter sex, production of the hormone prolactin surges. This in turn causes stemcells in the brain to develop new neurons in the brain’s olfactory bulb, itssmell center, improving one’s sense of smell.Weight Loss, Overall FitnessOne of the most compelling benefits of sex comes from studies of aerobicfitness. It has been estimated that the act of intercourse burns about twohundred calories, the equivalent of running vigorously for thirty minutes. Mostcouples average about twenty-four minutes for lovemaking. During orgasm, bothheart rate and blood pressure typically double, all under the influence ofoxytocin. Muscular contractions during intercourse work the pelvis, thighs,buttocks, arms, neck, and thorax. Men’s Health Magazine has gone so far as tocall the bed the single greatest piece of exercise equipment ever invented.The Key to Health and LongevityRegular sexual contact, especially with a committed partner, helps to keep yourbody and brain healthy. Do not use excuses such as you are too tired or too busyfor physical affection. Also, try to avoid spending too much time at work at theexclusion of social endeavors. A lack of relationships sets up humans to bedepressed or to seek pleasure through solitary sexual activities, such as usingthe Internet, drugs or alcohol, gambling, or other addictions, which are notgood for the brain. Men and women need touching, eye contact, and sexualconnection to stay healthy. When you feel loved, nurtured, cared for, supported,and intimate, you are much more likely to be happier and healthier. You have amuch lower risk of getting sick and, if you do, a much greater chance ofsurviving.HappinessThere is happy news for people who have more activity in the bedroom than intheir bank accounts. After evaluating the levels of sexual activity andhappiness in sixteen thousand people, Dartmouth College economist DavidBlachflower and University of Warwick in England professor Andrew Oswald foundthat sex so positively influenced happiness that they estimated increasingintercourse from once a month to once a week is equivalent to the happinessgenerated by getting an additional $50,000 in income for the average American.In addition, they also reported, that despite what most people think, people whomake more money do not necessarily have more sex. There was no difference, intheir study, between sexual frequency and income levels. The happiest people inthe study were married people who had, on average, 30 percent more sex thansingle folks. The economists estimated that a lasting marriage equated to thehappiness generated by an extra $100,000 annually, while divorce depleted anestimated $66,000 annually worth of happiness. Taking care of your marriage cansave you lots of money.Table 1: Summary of Some of the Health Benefits of Regular Sexual ContactFor women, in research studies, regular sex with a partner has been associatedwith:• more regular menstrual cycles• more fertile menstrual cycles• lighter periods• better moods• better memories• pain relief• better bladder control• fewer colds and flu• reduced stress• staying in shape• increase in the youth-promoting hormone DHEA• increased testosterone and estrogen• better weight control—sex burns about 200 calories per half hour, yoga 114,dancing (rock) 129, walking (3 mph) 153, weight training 153.For men, regular sex with a partner has been associated with:• increased heart rate variability (a sign of heart health and a calmer mind)• improved heart cardiovascular function (three times a week decreased risk ofheart attack or stroke by half )• higher testosterone levels (stronger bones and muscles)• improved prostate function• improved sleep.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lesson #1: Remember Methuselah’s secret—frequent sexual activity is good foryour health.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_006_r1.jpg]NO FORETHOUGHT EQUALS NO FOREPLAYimage [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_005_r1.jpg]Understanding and Optimizing the Brain Systems of Sex“The great sins of the world take place in the brain: but it is in the brainthat everything takes place . . . . It is in the brain that the poppy is red,that the apple is odorous, that the skylark sings.”—OSCAR WILDEAre you:Impulsive or thoughtful?Rigid or flexible?Anxious or confident?Negative or hopeful?Short-tempered or patient?Able to admit problems or in denial?Coordinated or prone to bumping into walls?Attached or afraid?Faithful or a wanderer? The inner workings of the brain influence all we do sexually. Once thought of asa black box too complex to understand, the brain is now being studied andunderstood like never before. We know that within the brain there are systemsthat work together to produce our personality, cares, dreams, aspirations, andsexual competencies. In my work as a neuroscientist, I have found it useful tothink about five different brain systems that relate to human behavior:prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, deep limbic system, basal ganglia,and temporal lobes. Each of these systems interacts with other areas of thebrain to produce the effective or not-so-effective human behavior.The brain is divided into four main lobes or regions: frontal (forethought andjudgment), temporal (memory and mood stability), parietal (sensory processingand direction sense), and occipital lobes (visual processing). There are alsoimportant structures deep in the brain, such as the anterior cingulate gyrus(gear shifter), basal ganglia (anxiety and pleasure center), and deep limbicsystem (emotional center). A useful generalization about how the brain functionsis that the back half—the parietal, occipital, and back part of the temporallobes—takes in and perceives the world, and determines what is sexy to us. Thefront half of the brain integrates this information, analyzes it, decides whatto do, then plans and executes the decision, such as “Shall I go on a date withhim if he asks?”This chapter will give a detailed look at the five brain systems of behavior,including a discussion of the functions, problems, and treatments of eachsystem, especially as they relate to sexual relationships. In addition, I’llinclude a section on common things partners say when these systems are out ofwhack. This section will help readers more clearly identify individualvulnerabilities and problems. For each of the brain systems discussed, I willadd an “at a glance” summary chart highlighting the major functions, problems,and treatments. See my book Change Your Brain, Change Your Life for moreinformation on each system. Appendix A is a self-test to help readers evaluatethese systems for themselves. Obviously, any medication recommendations need tobe discussed with your doctor.image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_007_r1.jpg]image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_008_r1.jpg]Prefrontal Cortex (PFC): No Forethought Equals No ForeplayThe frontal lobes (the front half of the brain) are divided into three areas:the motor cortex, which controls the body’s motor movements, such as walking,chewing, and moving your fingers and toes; the premotor area, which is involvedin planning motor movements; and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the front third ofthe brain, which is involved with executive functions such as planning,forethought, judgment, organizing, impulse control, and learning from pastmistakes.The PFC is the most evolved part of the human brain, representing 30 percent ofthe cortex, compared to the chimpanzee, our closest primate cousin, whose PFCoccupies only 11 percent; a dog’s PFC, only 7 percent; or a cat’s PFC, only 3.5percent. This explains my cat Annabelle, who has no forethought or judgment. Shelives totally in the moment and will drink out of the toilet, no matter how manytimes she has been told “No.”The prefrontal cortex houses our ability to guide our behavior over time toreach our goals. When the PFC works as it should, we are thoughtful, empathic,expressive, organized, and goal oriented. The PFC is often called the executivepart of the brain, like the boss at work. When it is low in activity, it is asif the boss is gone, so there is little to no supervision and nothing gets done.When the PFC works too hard, it is as if the boss is micromanaging everyone, andpeople are left with anxiety and worry. I call the PFC the Jiminy Cricket partof the brain. It houses our conscience and our ability to stay on track towardour goals. It is the part of the brain that, as Jiminy Cricket says in the moviePinocchio, “is the still, small voice that helps you decide between right andwrong.” In the dating, relationship, and sex world, the PFC helps us be patient,thoughtful, goal driven, and empathetic toward our partner.Problems with the PFC result in a “Jiminy Cricket Deficiency Syndrome”: adiminished conscience, poor judgment, impulsivity, desire to seek excitement,short attention span, disorganization, trouble learning from experience, poortime management, and lack of empathy. It has been associated withattention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), antisocial personalitydisorder, sexual addictions, brain injuries, and some forms of dementia. Lowactivity in this part of the brain is often due to a deficiency in theneurotransmitter dopamine; increasing it through supplements or medications isoften helpful.Healthy activity in the PFC is associated with conscientiousness; abnormal PFCactivity is associated with inconsistency and troubled decisions. In reviewing194 studies, Drs. T. Boggs and B. W. Roberts from the Department of Psychologyat the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found that increased deathrates were associated with poor PFC activity due to impulsive behaviors (a lackof conscientiousness)—tobacco use, diet and activity patterns, excessive alcoholuse, drug use, violence, risky sexual behavior, risky driving, and suicide. Youneed a good PFC to live long and be happy!PFC in RelationshipsWhen the PFC functions properly, people are able to engage in goal-directedbehavior and effectively supervise their words and deeds. They are able to thinkbefore they say things and they tend to say things that effect their goals in apositive way. They also tend to think before they do things and learn frommistakes. In addition, they are able to focus and attend to conversations,follow through on commitments and chores, and organize their actions and spaces.They are also able to be settled and sit still. They are able to express whatthey feel. And they tend not to like conflict, tension, and turmoil.When the PFC is underactive, people tend to be impulsive in what they say or do,often causing serious problems in relationships (such as saying hurtful thingswithout forethought). They tend to live in the moment and have trouble delayinggratification (I want it now). They also have trouble listening in relationshipsand tend to be easily distracted. There is often difficulty expressing thoughtsand feelings; partners often complain of a lack of talking in the relationship.They tend to be restless and fidgety. In addition, they tend to be sensitive tonoise and touch. Organization of time and space is difficult and they havetrouble staying on task and finishing projects, commitments, and chores. Thereis also a tendency to be late. In addition, many people with PFC problems havean unconscious tendency to be conflict seeking or to look for problems when noneexist. I call this tendency “the game of let’s have a problem.” They also tendto seek stimulation or do high-risk activities that upset or frighten theirpartners (such as driving too fast, skydiving, getting in the middle of a fightbetween strangers). Also, many people with PFC problems cannot filter out noise,smells, or light and tend to be overly sensitive to their environments, thuseasily distracted.POSITIVE PFC RELATIONAL STATEMENTSYou’re important to me. Let’s do something tonight.I love you. I’m glad we’re together.I love to listen to you.I’ll be on time for our date.Let’s get these chores done so that we’ll have more time together.I don’t want to fight. Let’s take a break and come back in ten minutes and workthis out.I made that mistake before. I’m not making it again.I planned a wonderful evening for us.How do you like me to touch you? I want to please you.NEGATIVE PFC RELATIONAL STATEMENTSI’m just a half hour late. Why are you so uptight about it?If you want the checkbook balanced, do it yourself.I’ll do it later.I find it hard to listen to you.Go ahead and talk to me. I can listen to you while I’m watching TV and readingthis book.I can’t express myself.My mind goes blank when I try to express my feelings.I didn’t mean to have the affair (or, overspend, embarrass you at the party, saythe hurtful comments, etc.).I just can’t sit still.The noise bothers me.I get so distracted (while listening, during sex, when playing a game, etc.).I need the answer now.I want it now.I’m so mad at myself. I’ve made that mistake too many times.STATEMENTS FROM PARTNERS OF PEOPLE WITH PFC PROBLEMSHe’s impulsive.She blurts out and interrupts.He doesn’t pay attention to me.She won’t let me finish a comment. She says she has to say a thought that comesinto her head or she’ll forget it.He has to have the fan on at night to sleep. It drives me crazy.She often seems to start a problem for no particular reason.He loves to challenge everything I say.She gets so distracted during sex.He teases the animals and it makes me furious.She can’t sit still.He puts things off and tends not to finish things.She’s always late, rushing around at the last minute.PREFRONTAL CORTEX (PFC) SUMMARY(the boss in your head, supervising your life)PFC Functions (supervision)Low PFC Problems (lack of supervision)FocusShort attention spanForethoughtLack of clear goals or forward thinkingImpulse controlImpulsivityOrganizationDisorganizationPlanning, goal settingProcrastinationJudgmentPoor judgmentEmpathyLack of empathyEmotional controlFailure to give close attention to detailInsightLack of insightLearning from mistakesTrouble learning from mistakes Tendency to lose things Easy distractionDIAGNOSTIC PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW PFC ACTIVITYADHDSome types of depressionBrain traumaDementia, associated with bad judgmentAntisocial personalityConduct disordersDIAGNOSTIC PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH EXCESSIVE PFC ACTIVITYOverfocused, rigid, and inflexibleAlso, see problems of the anterior cingulate gyrus (Lesson 2)WAYS TO BALANCE LOW PFCOrganizational help, coachingIntense aerobic exercise (boosts blood flow)Goal-setting/planning exercisesNeurofeedback to boost PFC activityRelationship counselingStimulating or exciting activitiesHigher protein dietDeveloping a deep sense of personal meaningStimulating supplements, to boost dopamine to the brain, such as L-tyrosine orSAMeStimulating medications (if appropriate), such as Adderall, Dexedrine, Ritalin,Wellbutrin, Stratterra, or ProvigilWAYS TO BALANCE HIGH PFCSee prescriptions of the anterior cingulate gyrus (Lesson 2)Anterior Cingulate Gyrus (ACG)—My Way or the HighwayThe ACG helps you feel settled, relaxed, and flexible. It runs lengthwisethrough the deep parts of the frontal lobes and is the brain’s major switchingstation. I think of it as the brain’s gear shifter, greasing human behavior, andallowing us to be flexible, adaptable, and to change as change is needed. Thispart of the brain is involved in helping shift attention from thing to thing,moving from idea to idea, and seeing the options in life. The term that bestrelates to the ACG is cognitive flexibility. Cooperation is also influenced bythis part of the brain. When the ACG works in an effective manner, it is easy toshift into cooperative modes of behavior.When there is too much activity in the ACG, usually due to lower serotoninlevels, people become unable to shift their attention and become rigid,cognitively inflexible, overfocused, anxious, and oppositional. When it workstoo hard, people have difficulty shifting attention and get stuck in ineffectivebehavior patterns, where they may be uncooperative or difficult, trapped intheir own mindset. When the ACG works too hard, people plan too much, worry toomuch about the future, and become too serious or obsessed. Difficulties in theACG can cause a person to constantly expect negative events and feel very unsafein the world. When the ACG is overactive, people have a tendency to get stuck orlocked into negative thoughts or behaviors. They may become obsessive worriersor hold onto hurts or grudges from the past. They may also get stuck on negativebehaviors, or develop compulsions such as hand-washing or excessively checkinglocks. One patient who had ACG problems described the phenomenon to me saying itwas “like being on a rat’s exercise wheel, where the thoughts just go over andover and over.” Another patient told me, “It’s like having a Reset button inyour head that is always on. Even though I don’t want to have the thoughtanymore, it just keeps coming back.”The clinical problems associated with excessive ACG activity include obsessivecompulsive disorder, eating disorders, and addictive disorders. All of thesedisorders are associated with problems shifting attention. Worrying, holdingonto hurts from the past, cognitive inflexibility, automatically saying no, andbeing rigid, are symptoms of too much activity in the ACG. Increasing serotoninthrough supplements or medications is often helpful.When the ACG is underactive, people have little motivation and get-up-and-go.They shift gears too easily and can be easily distracted and apathetic.Neurosurgeons at the University of California at Irvine School of Medicinedescribed a set of symptoms associated with damage to this part of the brain,from a stroke, tumor, or brain injury. They called the syndrome akinetic mutism,where patients tend to have little physical movement (akinetic) and producelittle speech (mutism). They also noted indifference and lower levels of anxietyand worry in patients.ACG in RelationshipsWhen the ACG functions properly, people are able to shift their attentioneasily. They tend to be flexible and adaptable. They are likely to see optionsin tough situations. They are usually able to forgive the mistakes of others andtend not to hold onto hurts from the past. They encourage others to help but donot rigidly control situations. They tend to have a positive outlook and see ahopeful future. Basically, they are able to roll with the ups and downs ofrelationships.When the ACG is overactive, people have a tendency to get locked into thoughts,stuck on thoughts, and get the same thoughts in their head over and over. Theytend to hold grudges, hold onto hurts from the past, and to be unforgiving ofperceived wrongdoings. They tend to be inflexible, rigid, and unbending. Theyoften want things done a certain way (their way) and they may get very upsetwhen things do not go their way. They have difficulty dealing with a change.They tend to be argumentative and oppositional. When the ACG is underactive,people can act in apathetic, indifferent, or uncaring ways. Interestingly, oneof the treatments for excessive activity in the ACG with disorders likeobsessive-compulsive disorder is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)medications such as Prozac or Lexapro. One of the side effects of thesemedications is apathy and lack of motivation when it suppresses the ACG toomuch.POSITIVE ACG RELATIONAL STATEMENTSIt’s okay.I can roll with this situation.How would you like to do this?Let’s collaborate.Let’s cooperate.What would you like to do?That was in the past.NEGATIVE ACG RELATIONAL STATEMENTSYou hurt me years ago.I won’t forgive you.It’ll never be the same.I’m always worried.I get stuck on these bad thoughts.Do it my way.I can’t change.It’s your fault.I don’t agree with you.No. No. No.I won’t do it.I don’t want to do it.I have a lot of complaints about you.I’ve never hated anyone more than you.This will never change.STATEMENTS FROM PARTNERS OF PEOPLE WITH ACG PROBLEMSNothing ever gets forgiven or let go.She brings up issues from years and years ago.Everything has to be the way he/she wants it.He can’t say he’s sorry.She holds onto grudges forever.He never throws anything away.She’s rigid.If things aren’t perfect, he thinks they are no good at all.I don’t help her because I have to do it exactly her way or she goes ballistic.He argues with everything I say.She tends to be oppositional.He doesn’t like to try new things.ANTERIOR CINGULATE GYRUS (ACG) SUMMARY (the brain’s gear shifter)ACG FunctionsExcessive ACG Activity ProblemsCognitive flexibilityGets stuck on negative thoughts or behaviorsTransition from idea to ideaWorriesCooperationHolds grudgesAbility to see optionsHas obsessions/compulsionsGoes with the flowIs inflexible, may appear selfishIs oppositional/argumentativeGets upset when things do not go his wayGets upset when things are out of placeHas an intense dislike for changeTends to say no without thinkingLow ACG Activity ProblemsApathy or indifferencePoor motivationLittle speech productionDecreased physical movementDIAGNOSTIC PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH EXCESSIVE ACG ACTIVITYObsessive compulsive disorderAddictionsEating disordersPremenstrual tension syndrome (some types)Chronic painPosttraumatic stress disorderOppositional defiant disorderDifficult temperamentsTourette’s syndromeDIAGNOSTIC PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW ACG ACTIVITYLowered motivation, little spontaneous movement or speechSee problems of low PFC activity (see Lesson 2)WAYS TO CALM EXCESSIVE ACG ACTIVITYNeurofeedback to calm ACG activity (uses measuring instruments to give peopleinformation or feedback on the activity in this part of the brain so they canlearn to calm it down)Intense aerobic exerciseRelationship counseling, anger managementLower protein/complex carbohydrate dietACG supplements, to boost serotonin to the brain, such 5-HTP, St. John’s wort,or InositolACG medications (if appropriate), SSRIs (Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Prozac, Luvox,Lexapro), Effexor, atypical antipsychotics in refractory cases, such asRisperdal, Zyprexa, or GeodonWAYS TO BOOST LOW ACG ACTIVITYSee prescriptions of the PFC (Lasson 2)Use Practical Neuroscience to Enhance LoveA friend of mine recently approached me at a seminar and told me this story.“Daniel, I am so grateful for everything you have taught me, especially aboutthe anterior cingulate gyrus. I am married to a woman who has the anteriorcingulate from hell. No matter what I say, she says the opposite. It has been sofrustrating. For years I just thought that she didn’t love me. Now I know it hasto do with how her brain works. If I asked her to go to the store with me, shewould always say, ‘I am too busy to go. It is so insensitive of you to ask me;don’t you see everything I am doing.’ Rebuffed, I stopped asking her to dothings. Since I have listened to you talk about the anterior cingulate gyrus, Irealize that her brain gets stuck and I need to ask the opposite of what I want.For example, if I want her to go to the store with me, I’ll say, ‘I am going tothe store. You probably do not want to go with me.’ Incensed, she says, ‘Ofcourse I want to go with you. What would ever give you that idea?’ We are doingmuch better now. But I still have one problem. It’s the sex thing. It doesn’tsound right to say, ‘I am going to have sex. You probably do not want to comewith me?’ Do you have any ideas on how to solve that problem?”In response to my friend, I smiled and said, “I am very pleased you have learnedpractical neuroscience to improve your relationship with you wife. I haveseveral ideas on how to get more sex with people like your wife who haveanterior cingulate gyrus problems. First, take her out for a pasta dinner.Simple carbohydrates boost serotonin levels in the brain and help people feelmore relaxed and more flexible. Next, take her for a long walk. Exercise boostsblood flow to the brain and also increases serotonin levels as well. Next, whenyou get home, give her a small piece of Godiva chocolate, which increases achemical called phenylethylamine (PEA), which boosts the brain’s alertingsystem. Then rub her shoulders and never ask for anything directly. Odds arefrom day four to day twenty of her menstrual cycle you are likely to get lucky.”Several weeks later I opened my e-mail and found a note from my friend with astring of hundreds of “thank you” phrases.Understanding the different brain systems, such as the anterior cingulate gyrus,allows you to develop specific strategies to enhance your sex life. When someonehas low PFC activity, for example, they will need to be excited or turned on inorder to be more interested in sex. Taking them to a meditation session or aprofessional lecture is not likely to turn them on. They are more likely to needa scary movie or a ride on a motorcycle in order to get excited.Deep Limbic System (DLS)—Passion Fires BurningThe DLS lies near the center of the brain. About the size of a walnut, this partof the brain is involved in setting a person’s emotional tone. When the DLS isless active, there is generally a positive, more hopeful state of mind. When itis heated up, or overactive, negativity can take over. Due to this emotionalshading, the DLS provides the filter through which you interpret the events ofthe day; it tags or colors events, depending on the emotional state of mind. TheDLS, including structures called the hippocampus and amygdala, have also beenreported to store highly charged emotional memories, both positive and negative.The total experience of our emotional memories is responsible, in part, for ouremotional tone. Stable, positive experiences enhance how we feel. Trauma andnegative experiences set our brain in a negative way.The DLS controls the sleep and appetite cycles of the body and is intimatelyinvolved with bonding and social connectedness. This capacity to bond plays asignificant role in the tone and quality of our moods. The DLS also directlyprocesses the sense of smell. Because your sense of smell goes directly to thedeep limbic system, it is easy to see why smells can have such a powerful impacton our feeling states.Too much activity in the DLS is associated with depression; negativity; and lowmotivation, libido, and energy. Because sufferers feel hopeless about theoutcome, they have little willpower to follow through with tasks. Since thesleep and appetite centers are in the DLS, disruption can lead to changes inhabits, which may mean an inclination to too much or too little of either. Forexample, in typical depressive episodes, people have been known to lose theirappetites and to have trouble sleeping despite being chronically tired. Highactivity in the DLS may be due to deficiencies in the neurotransmittersnorepinephrine, dopamine, or serotonin; increasing these chemicals throughsupplements or medications may be helpful. Low activity in the DLS has beenassociated with lowered motivation, decreased reactiveness, and misreadingincoming information.DLS in RelationshipsWhen the limbic system functions properly, people tend to be more positive andmore able to connect with other people. They tend to filter information in anaccurate light and they are more likely to give others the benefit of the doubt.They are able to be playful, sexy, and sexual, and they tend to maintain andhave easy access to positive emotional memories. They tend to draw people towardthem with their positive attitude. When the limbic system is overactive, thereis a tendency toward depression, negativity, and distance from others. They tendto focus on the most negative aspects of others, filter information through darkglasses, and see the glass as half empty. They tend not to be playful. They donot feel sexy and they tend to shy away from sexual activity due to a lack ofinterest. Most of their memories are negative and it is hard to access positiveemotional memories or feelings. They tend to push people away with theirnegativity.POSITIVE DLS RELATIONAL STATEMENTSWe have great memories.Let’s have friends over.I accept your apology. I know you were just having a bad day.Let’s have fun.I feel sexy. Let’s make love.NEGATIVE DLS RELATIONAL STATEMENTSDon’t look at me in a negative way.All I can remember is the bad times.I’m too tired.Leave me alone. I’m not interested in sex.You go to bed. I can’t sleep.I don’t feel like being around other people.I don’t want to hear you’re sorry. You meant to hurt me.I’m not interested in doing anything.STATEMENTS FROM PARTNERS OF PEOPLE WITH DLS PROBLEMSShe’s negative.He’s often depressed.She looks on the negative side of things.He doesn’t want to be around other people.She tends to take things the wrong way.He’s not interested in sex.She can’t sleep.There’s little playfulness in our relationship.DEEP LIMBIC SYSTEM (DLS) SUMMARY(the mood and bonding center)DLS FunctionsExcessive DLS Activity ProblemsMood controlDepression, sadnessMemoriesFocus on the negative, irritabilityDegree of motivationLow motivation and energyEmotional toneNegativity, blame, guiltAppetite/sleep cyclesPoor sleep and appetiteBondingSocial disconnections/isolationSense of smellLow self-esteemLibidoLow libidoFlight-or-fight responseHopelessnessDecreased interest in things that are usually funFeelings of worthlessness or helplessnessFeeling dissatisfied or boredCrying spellsLow DLS Activity ProblemsDecreased reactivenessMisreading incoming informationDIAGNOSTIC PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH DLS ACTIVITYDepressionCyclic mood disordersPain syndromesDIAGNOSTIC PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW DLS ACTIVITYNoneWAYS TO CALM HIGH DLS ACTIVITYBiofeedback, increase left PFC activity (helps calm the DLS through itsconnections)Intense aerobic exerciseRelationship counselingTherapy to correct and eliminate ANTs (automatic negative thoughts)Balanced diet, such as described by Barry Sears in The Zone DietDLS supplements, such as DL phenylalanine, SAMe, L-tyrosine DLS medications (if appropriate), antidepressants such as Wellbutrin(bupropion), Effexor (venlafaxine), Norpramin (desipramine), Tofranil(imipramine), SSRIs (if ACG also present), anticonvulsants/Lithium to help withcyclic mood changesBasal Ganglia (BG)—You Make Me NervousThe basal ganglia are a set of large structures toward the center of the brainthat surround the deep limbic system. The BG are involved with integratingfeelings, thoughts, and movement, which is why you jump when you get excited orfreeze when you are scared. In our clinic we have noticed that the basal gangliaare involved with setting the body’s idle or anxiety level. When the BG work toohard, people tend to struggle with anxiety and physical stress symptoms, such asheadaches, intestinal problems, and muscle tension. High BG activity is alsoassociated with conflict-avoidant behavior. Anything that reminds them of aworry (such as confronting an employee who is not doing a good job) producesanxiety; high BG people tend to avoid conflict, because it makes them feeluncomfortable. People with high BG activity also have trouble relaxing and tendto overwork. When the BG are low in activity, people tend to have problems withmotivation and attention.In addition, the BG are involved with feelings of pleasure and ecstasy. Cocaineworks in this part of the brain. High activity in this part of the brain isoften due to a deficiency in the neurotransmitter GABA; increasing it throughsupplements or medications is often helpful.BG in RelationshipsWhen the basal ganglia system functions properly, people tend to be calm andrelaxed. They tend to predict the best and, in general, see a positive future.Their bodies tend to feel good, and they are physically free to express theirsexuality. They are not plagued by multiple physical complaints. They tend to berelaxed enough to be playful, sexy, and sexual. They are able to deal withconflict in an effective way. When the basal ganglia is overactive, there is atendency toward anxiety, panic, fear, and tension. They tend to focus onnegative future events and what can go wrong in a situation. They filterinformation through fear and they are less likely to give others the benefit ofthe doubt. They tend to have headaches, backaches, and a variety of physicalcomplaints. They have lowered sexual interest because their physical bodies tendto be wrapped in tension.

They also help with recognizing objects by sight and namingthem. Called the “What Pathway” in the brain, it is involved with recognitionand naming objects and faces. In addition, the temporal lobes, especially on theright side, have been implicated in spiritual experience and insight.Experiments that stimulate the right temporal lobe have demonstrated increasedreligious or spiritual experiences, such as feeling God’s presence. Orgasms havebeen found to activate this part of the brain as well.The hippocampus, situated on the inside aspect of the temporal lobes, encodesnew information and stores it for up to several weeks. When these areas aredamaged, you can neither store new experiences nor retrieve experiences learnedwithin the past several weeks. The hippocampus is one of the first areas damagedby Alzheimer’s disease.In front of the hippocampus on the inside of the temporal lobe is analmond-shaped structure called the amygdala. The amygdala coordinates youremotional responses. Strong emotions can improve the encoding process ofhippocampal neurons and make it easier to retrieve the experience. This isuseful because it allows you to more easily remember events that were“emotionally stimulating,” such as being mugged, having good sex, or recalling afascinating fact you recently heard. I remember a taxi ride in 2005 fromManhattan to JFK airport like it was yesterday. I even remember the cab number,4118. The cab driver had on very irritating music, talked loudly on his cellphone, paid little attention to the road, and nearly got us into two accidents.My emotional response to this terrible ride to the airport got his cab numberstuck in my head. By emphasizing the memory of certain experiences over others,the amygdala allows you to respond more appropriately and quickly in thefuture—being able to recognize a potential mugger or dangerous cab driver aheadof time may save your life. When the amygdala functions appropriately, we tendto react to the world in a logical, thoughtful way. When it is overactive, ourresponses may be exaggerated for the situation. When the amygdala isunderactive, we fail to read situations accurately, and our response may notmatch what has happened. For example, if you laugh upon hearing from your wifethat her best friend died, your amygdala may not be working properly.Trouble in the temporal lobes leads to both short- and long-term memoryproblems, reading difficulties, trouble finding the right words in conversation,trouble reading social cues, mood instability, and sometimes religious or moralpreoccupation or perhaps a lack of spiritual sensitivity. The temporal lobes,especially on the left side, have been associated with temper problems. Abnormal(high or low) activity in this part of the brain is often due to a deficiency inthe neurotransmitter GABA; balancing it through supplements or medications isoften helpful.TLs in RelationshipsWhen the temporal lobes function properly, people tend to have emotionalstability. They are able to process and understand what others say in a clearway. They can retrieve words for conversations. They tend to accurately read theemotional state of others. They have control over their tempers. They haveaccess to accurate memories. Because of their memory, they have a sense ofpersonal history and identity.When the temporal lobes do not function properly, people tend to have memorystruggles. They do not have clear access to their own personal history andidentity. They are often emotionally labile (up and down). They tend to betemperamental and have problems with anger. They often have violent thoughts andexpress their frustration with aggressive talk. They often take things the wrongway and appear to be a little bit paranoid. They may have periods of spacinessor confusion and to misinterpret what is said to them.POSITIVE TL RELATIONAL STATEMENTSI remember what you asked me to do.I have a clear memory of the history of our relationship.I feel stable and even.I have access to the words I need to express my feelings.I can usually tell when another person is happy, sad, mad, or bored.I have good control over my temper.My memory is good.NEGATIVE TL RELATIONAL STATEMENTSI struggle with memory.I blow things way out of proportion.I get angry easily.

The onlything slower than the traffic is your perception of time’s passage.Then you notice her.She appears at the curb, waiting to cross. No, she’s not the love of your life.She’s more like the heat of the moment. It’s fortunate that your wife isn’tthere; you’d be in deep trouble as you take in the stranger’s hips and breasts,and the way her waist scoops in to accentuate both. Time is enhanced; there’s apleasing buzz connecting your temples.Your reaction is automatic, reflexive, and quite possibly the most powerful oneyou’ll have this day. It temporarily blots out your long-range commitments—yourten-year marriage, your sweet child in second grade, your responsibility to keepeyes forward at traffic lights. You’ve surrendered control; you’re captivated bythe pleasure in the vision.“You dog!” you may whisper under your breath, embarrassed by what you’reenvisioning as you sit there in your family van. But it might be more correct tosay, “You dopamine fiend!”When you spot the object of your desire, the neurotransmitter dopamine lights upareas deep within the brain, triggering feelings of pleasure, motivation, andreward. (Cocaine acts the same way.) You feel a rush, and your heartbeatquickens. Attraction, too, is a powerful drug. The brain stem also gets into theact, releasing phenylethylamine (PEA), which speeds up the flow of informationbetween nerve cells. It’s no wonder your neck and eyeballs track her everymovement.But she’s not gawking back at you, and it’s not just because you’re driving afamily bus with a paint scrape on the fender. Her brain acts very differentlyfrom yours. You’re keyed in to beauty, shape, fantasy, and obsession; on somebiological level that she may be unaware of, she’s looking for a mate who willsire healthy children and protect and provide for her and them. And yes, maybeeven buy them a family van. Her goals are programmed for the long range; yoursare often shockingly short term.The whole encounter can leave you quivering with pleasure, hoping for more.It can also ruin your life.Between the “walk” and “don’t walk” signals of delight and disaster, your brainis sorting information, making choices, spurring actions. Pay attention—yourwhole life is riding on the choices you make.Chemical SymphonyIf you have ever listened to a symphony or any other beautiful musicalproduction, you realize how each musician plays an essential part in the overallartistic performance. If any musician plays out of sync with the others, themusic can be ruined. A fulfilling sexual relationship is very similar to awell-conducted symphony with respect to the synergy of many hormones andchemicals that are released at different phases of the love relationship. If ahormone or brain chemical is out of balance compared to the others (over- orunderproduced), the entire sexual experience can be ruined.After looking at the five different brain systems that relate to human behaviordiscussed in Lesson Two, it is time to explore the major chemicals involved withthe primary phases of love: attraction, infatuation, commitment, and detachment.1. Attraction, the craving for sexual gratification, is primarily driven by themale and female hormones, testosterone and estrogen, the chemical nitric oxide,and potentially a group of chemicals called pheromones.2. Infatuation, intense, passionate love—characterized by extreme happiness whenthings are going well, bad feelings when they’re not; focused attention;obsessive thinking; and craving for the new love—is controlled by a cocktail ofneurotransmitters including epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin,and phenylethylamine (PEA).3. Commitment, the sense of connectedness, sustained joy, stability, and peacethat one feels with a potential long-term partner, is created by the hormonesoxytocin and vasopressin.4. Detachment, losing a love through breakups or death, often leads todeficiencies in serotonin and endorphins.This chapter will go through each phase and also give you tips on managing thesephases, especially detachment, so they don’t throw you out of balance.Attraction Chemicals—“You Turn Me On” (Testosterone, Estrogen, Nitric Oxide, andPheromones)When I saw her for the first time, it was hard to catch my breath. She wasstunning. I couldn’t possibly think about anything else. I didn’t want to stare,but couldn’t help myself. “Stop it,” I screamed inside my head. “Look away. No,I just have to look. Be polite, she’ll think you are a pervert.” My thoughtsstarted to run wild. “Her curly brown hair, her sparkling green eyes, her neck,her slender body, amazing . . . Stop it, get a grip, you don’t even know her.”This little intense dialogue is what could be the beginning of the great love inyour life, a horror story of obsession, or momentary fireworks.What happens in the brain when we are sexually attracted to someone new? Ourbrain is programmed for attraction. It is one of the most powerfully rewardingreactions in this history of our species. The brain is a chemical factorylooking for love. Attraction activates the erector sets that live in all of us.Fifty percent of the brain is dedicated to vision, so how people look, how theymove, how they smile, and how their eyes appear are critical to the process ofattraction. When a man or woman sees an attractive person, the visual areas ofthe brain spark with activity, and he or she occupies a large portion of thebrain. Attraction works very much like a powerful drug.Using sophisticated imaging equipment, researchers from Emory University inAtlanta found that the amygdala, an area of the brain that controls emotions andmotivation, is much more activated in men than women when viewing sexualmaterial for thirty minutes, even though both sexes reported similar levels ofinterest in the images. This may be one of the reasons men are much moreinterested in pornography than women. It is also no mistake that women spendmore time caring for their physical appearance. How they look has much moreimpact on a man’s brain than the other way around.Men tend to be attracted to symmetrical, fertile, healthy, younger-lookingwomen. A man’s genetic brain is looking at a woman and deciding whether or nothe wants his children to carry her genes. Unconsciously we look for signs ofhealth, such as clear skin and bright eyes. A number of scientists believe thatbody symmetry also plays a critical role in our view of beauty. The theorybehind this notion is that asymmetrical features give clues to underlying healthproblems, thus yielding more troubled offspring. In a study at the University ofNew Mexico, college males found symmetrical female faces more attractive thanasymmetrical faces. In addition, women who were blessed with symmetry had ahistory of more sexual partners and tended to lose their virginity at an earlierage.There is now scientific proof for something people have long suspected—beautifulwomen make men stupid. Canadian researchers showed men pictures ofconventionally pretty or not-so-pretty women. The men rolled dice—and were toldthey could either receive $15 the following day or $75 after waiting a few days.The men who saw the pictures of the beautiful women were more likely to take the$15—proving, researchers say, that men stop thinking about long-termconsequences once love chemicals kick in. By the way, the same test was done onwomen—and attractiveness had no effect on their thinking processes. It seems asthough beautiful women cause a man’s limbic system to fire up (emotional charge)while his prefrontal cortex (PFC) heads south, leaving the judgment area of thebrain vacant. Las Vegas knows this principle very well. Casinos have beautifulwaitresses dressed in low-cut, short dresses serving free alcohol—both lower PFCactivity. No wonder the house has the edge.A woman’s brain is much less interested in how a man looks than in how he thinksand acts. Women often look to a man’s ability to care for her and her subsequentoffspring. The trappings of a successful man, in whatever society, are moreimportant than just his physical appearance. As always, beauty is in the eye ofthe beholder.The feelings of attraction, desire, arousal, and orgasm are fueled by acomplicated interplay of chemicals, hormones, and other substances that causethe familiar and intriguing sensation of being “turned on.” Testosterone andestrogen were first identified in the 1920s as playing a role in sexualattraction. Since that time, there has been quite an evolution in theunderstanding of the chemistry involved with feelings of lust, from thecontroversial work of Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s, to the first published studieson human sexuality and the stages of sexual response in the 60s, to the present,when substances like Viagra (a medication that increases blood flow to thegenital areas to aid with arousal) and AndroGel (a testosterone gel applied tothe skin for those with low levels of testosterone) are readily used and heavilymarketed.A hormone is a chemical produced by one organ (endocrine gland) that has aspecific effect on the activities of other organs in the body. The major sexhormones can be classified as androgens or estrogens. Both classes of hormonesare present in males and females alike, but in vastly different amounts. Mostmen produce 6 to 8 mg of testosterone (an androgen) per day, compared to mostwomen who produce 0.5 mg daily. Estrogens are also present in both sexes, but inlarger amounts for women.Androgens/TestosteroneAndrogens, of which testosterone is the primary one, are sex hormones producedprimarily by a male’s testicles, but they are also produced in small amounts bythe female’s ovaries and the adrenal glands. Androgens help trigger thedevelopment of the testicles and penis in the male fetus. They jump-start theprocess of puberty and influence the male secondary sex characteristics, thedevelopment of facial, body, and pubic hair; deepening of the voice; and muscledevelopment. After puberty, testosterone plays a role in the sex drive.Deficiencies of testosterone may cause a drop in sexual desire, and excessivetestosterone may heighten sexual interest in both sexes. In men, too littletestosterone may cause difficulty obtaining or maintaining erections. As we age,testosterone levels begin to decrease; as many as five million men suffer fromabnormally low testosterone levels (a condition known as hypogonadism).Unfortunately, most men never seek treatment either because they just think itis a normal part of aging or they are embarrassed to admit that they have aproblem. Very often it is the female partner or wife who encourages her husbandor boyfriend to seek help. This was the case with William, a fifty-six-year-oldmale who came to my office on the advice of his wife who had noticed a decreasein his sexual desire and approaches when he was typically a highly sexualpartner. He noted that he still liked to cuddle with his wife and loved herdearly, but was rarely having erections upon awakening (a normal event inhealthy males) and was not having as many spontaneous erections when feelingaroused. He also described a decreased interest in sex and felt less motivationand interest in other parts of his life as well. Both his blood and saliva testsrevealed very low levels of testosterone; prescribing AndroGel (a testosteronegel applied to the shoulders once daily) restored his levels to normal, and hissexual interest and erectile function returned.In women during their reproductive years, testosterone surges just beforeovulation, in the middle of the menstrual cycle, lead many to a higher level ofdesire when they are most fertile. Some physicians believe that birth controlpills may possibly be the cause of a decreased libido in many women because ofhow they interfere with ovulation to prevent pregnancy through the manipulationof levels of testosterone and estrogen. Low testosterone levels have also beenassociated with Alzheimer’s disease and other memory problems, heart disease,and lowered bone density. If you have a low libido and memory problems, it iscritical to have your testosterone levels checked.EstrogensEstrogens are the sex hormones produced primarily by a female’s ovaries thatstimulate the growth of a girl’s sex organs, as well as her breasts and pubichair, known as secondary sex characteristics. Estrogens also regulate thefunctioning of the menstrual cycle. Estrogens are important in maintaining thecondition of the vaginal lining and its elasticity, and in producing vaginallubrication. They also help preserve the texture and function of a woman’sbreasts. Considering when women with deficient desire are given estrogen andtestosterone separately, the increase in desire is not as dramatic as when theyare given the two hormones together, estrogen is thought to play a synergisticrole with testosterone in increasing lustful desire.In women and men, estrogen is also produced in the brain; though thecontribution of estrogen to male sexual behavior has not been completelyestablished yet, researchers are speculating that estrogen may also be veryimportant for sexual appetite in men. An unusually high level, however, mayreduce sexual interest, cause erectile difficulties, produce some breastenlargement, and result in the loss of body hair in some men. Unfortunately allof us are being exposed daily to a large amount of “xenestrogens,” chemicals inthe environment such as pesticides, which look like estrogen and bind to thosereceptors in the body. Also, inorganic chicken and beef may be injected withmultiple hormones including estrogens to plump them up for the slaughterhouse.If you have the choice, it is better to select organic chicken and beef.Nitric OxideNitric oxide is a chemical released by the genitals when you are “turned on”that causes blood vessels to dilate and increases blood flow especially to thepenis. Drugs like Viagra and Cialis work by stimulating the release of nitricoxide. Though these medications can work very well for some men, results of thestudies that have been done thus far on women have not been compelling. Also,because these medications affect blood vessels, caution must be taken in givingthem to individuals with blood pressure problems or heart disease.PheromonesHave you ever noticed how you have been attracted to the way someone of theopposite sex smells while another’s scent may completely repel you? Pheromones,scented hormones secreted by sweat glands primarily in the armpits, are thoughtto attract the opposite sex. In 1991, a research group from Harvard Universityproved the existence of this “sixth sense,” or human vameronasal system. Howthese hormones work is not clearly understood yet, but they are thought toinfluence how humans mate, bond, and take care of their offspring. Women incollege dorms, or who spend a lot of time together, develop synchronizedmenstrual cycles and pheromones are thought to be responsible for thisphenomenon. In primitive times, scent was one of the first methods ofcommunication, and it is still an important part of how humans relate and whothey will want sexually. According to neurologist Alan Hirsch, smell also has atremendous impact on attraction. “If you smell good, we want you closer; if yousmell bad, we want you to go away. When you think about the sexual organ, youreally should be speaking of the nose.” He goes on to say that we talk aboutlove at first sight, when we really should be speaking of love at first sniff,because there’s a direct connection between the olfactory bulb at the top of thenose and the septal nucleus of the brain, the erection center. Sexual arousal isalso associated with engorgement of the erectile tissue in the nose. Dr. Hirschhas treated patients who have smell and taste disorders, and found that almost aquarter of people who lost their sense of smell develop sexual dysfunction.Measuring penile blood flow with what looks like a small blood pressure cuff, hefound that sexual arousal in men was enhanced by the smells of lavender andpumpkin pie. Doughnuts, licorice, and cinnamon were also on the top of the list.(I will discuss this topic in more depth in Lesson Nine, which coversaphrodisiacs.)Infatuation Chemicals—“I Can’t Get You Out Of My Head” (Epinephrine,Norepinephrine, Dopamine, Serotonin, and Phenylethylamine)Mother Nature formulated a very powerful concoction when she created the potionof chemicals involved with infatuation. The biology is smart because if itweren’t for this forceful surge of chemicals, the inhibitory centers in thebrain (primarily the amygdala), which warn us of potential danger or heartache,would prevail and people would never meet, mate, and procreate. Some havedescribed the infatuation stage as an “altered state of consciousness” or akinto being “intoxicated” or “under the influence.” People in this phase tend tosacrifice sleep, stay up late for hours talking with their lover on the phone,send abundant e-mails daily, and engage in behaviors that they wouldn’ttypically do, such as skydiving when they are afraid of heights or eating sushiwhen the thought of raw fish has always made them gag.Romantic love and infatuation are not so much of an emotion as they aremotivational drives. They are part of the brain’s reward system. These feelingsintensify to compel lovers to seek mating partners. The brain links these drivesto all kinds of specific emotions, depending on how the relationship is going.All the while, our PFC is assembling information, putting the pieces of datainto patterns, coming up with strategies, and monitoring progress toward “life’sgreatest prize.” The chemicals that stimulate the motivation and drive system inthe brain are the neurotransmitters epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine,serotonin, and phenylethylamine (PEA). These neurotransmitters play a role inthe initial phase of attraction as well but it is really in the second phase ofinfatuation where their release becomes more active and predominant.Neurotransmitters are chemicals that help regulate the electrical signalsbetween nerve cells in the brain. The brain is constantly seeking to keep itselfbalanced through increasing or decreasing amounts of these substances, some ofwhich excite the body, for example when you see your new love from a distanceand your heart starts to pound uncontrollably, and some of which calm the systemand allow you to enjoy the moment, “smell the roses,” and have the “warm, fuzzy”feelings associated with a new relationship.Epinephrine and NorepinephrineEpinephrine and norepinephrine, produced in the adrenal glands, spinal cord, andbrain, are considered excitatory neurotransmitters because they cause that“adrenaline rush” feeling when the heart beats faster, blood pressure goes up,and the body is prepared to take action either in the face of a threat or in thepresence of a positive stimuli such as a potential love partner. The feeling ofzest and excitement comes from these chemicals as they help to facilitate bothsexual arousal and orgasm. High levels of these chemicals are associated withanxiety, and low levels with depression. Chronic stress, low levels of the sexhormones estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone, a sedentary lifestyle, poordiet, and genetics can all lead to low levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine,creating interference with “the laws of attraction.” Certain medications, suchas stimulants or supplements like the amino acid tyrosine, can help to increaselevels of these chemicals in those who have a deficiency. Medications and formsof therapy including hypnosis and biofeedback are also used to decrease theselevels when they get too high, such as when individuals refrain from askingsomeone who they find attractive out on a date because they are afraid they willget overly anxious, their palms and face will get sweaty, or they will fumbleover their words.DopamineThe most important and well-studied neurotransmitter associated with infatuationis dopamine. Produced in the central part of the brain, dopamine is associatedwith pleasure, motivation, and concentration. It has been shown to work in thereward centers of the brain. Proper amounts are associated with healthymotivation and sexual drive. Individuals feel “sexy” when they have enough ofthis chemical. A study by Dr. Helen Fisher published in 2002 helps explain theactivity of dopamine in the brain when people are falling in love. She and ateam of experts recruited forty subjects who had just fallen in love—twenty whostayed in love, the other half who had recently split up. She put each of thesepeople into an MRI tube with a photo of a sweetheart and one of an acquaintance.Each subject looked at the sweetheart photo for thirty seconds, then—after adistraction task—at the acquaintance photo for another thirty seconds. Theyswitched back and forth for twelve minutes. The result was a picture of thebrain in love. There was increased activity in the right ventral-tegmental area.This is the part of the brain where dopamine cells project into other areas ofthe brain, including the basal ganglia, part of the brain’s system for rewardand motivation. The sweetheart photos, but not the acquaintance photos, causedthis to happen. In addition, several parts of the prefrontal cortex that arehighly wired in the dopamine pathways were used, while the amygdala in thetemporal lobes, associated with fear, was temporarily put out of commission.While high levels of dopamine are associated with attraction, low levels areassociated with certain types of depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD), and excitement-seeking or high-risk-taking behavior. Bothcocaine and stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), have beenshown to enhance its production. Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is an antidepressantthat enhances dopamine availability to the brain as well as enhances sexualfunction. Also, certain amino acid supplements like tyrosine can be used toincrease dopamine levels and potentially sexual function as well. I have seenboth women and men benefit from Wellbutrin and/or amino acid supplementationeither when sexual function has been diminished from low levels of dopamine orwhen substances like SSRI medications have suppressed sexual interest.SerotoninSerotonin is known as the “feel good” neurotransmitter and is produced in themidbrain and brain stem. Satisfaction with a partner and the positive feelingsafter an orgasm are to a large degree controlled by serotonin. Normal serotoninlevels help people have healthy moods and motivation. Serotonin is involved withmood regulation and emotional flexibility. Low serotonin levels have beenassociated with depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, impulsivity,and excessive activity in the brain’s anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG). Low levelshave also been associated with new love. Unfortunately, this makes loversvulnerable to high anxiety levels and moodiness, common in the initial stages ofa relationship. When serotonin levels are low and the ACG works too hard, peopletend to get stuck on certain thoughts or behaviors. Remember the last time youfell in love. All you could think about was your new love, and no matter howbusy you were, you could always find time for her. Your moods were up when youthought about her and then down when she didn’t answer her cell phone the firsttime you called. You felt more reckless and your friends wondered about yourjudgment. Lowered levels of serotonin make you vulnerable to depression if therelationship ends prematurely.In my clinical practice, I spend most of my time scanning the brains of peoplewho need help. As part of my research, I scan many healthy people as well.Several years ago, one of my friends was scanned as part of our healthy-brainstudy. Several months later he fell madly in love. One day he dropped by myoffice to tell me about his new love. I could hear in his voice that he was sotaken with his new woman that I did a repeat scan on him just to see his brainin love. The second scan showed significant increased activity in the anteriorcingulate gyrus and basal ganglia, indicating his brain was literally obsessedwith the woman; probably a measure of his serotonin levels would have revealedlow levels at that time.High serotonin levels can also be a problem and are associated with loweredmotivation. Medications that enhance serotonin, such as selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Prozac and Lexapro are notorious for decreasingsexual drive and function in part because recipients of these medications canlose interest if there is too much serotonin circulating in the brain, but alsobecause these medications can decrease sensation in the genital areas, making itharder to achieve orgasm.Dopamine and serotonin tend to counterbalance each other in the brain. Whendopamine levels are high, such as in new love, people tend to be motivated anddriven toward dating behaviors that bring people closer together. Higher levelsof dopamine cause lower levels of serotonin, which have been associated withobsessive thinking, hence the feeling of falling in love. When serotonin levelsare high, people tend to have lowered motivation and an almost “I don’t care”attitude.PhenylethylaminePhenylethylamine (PEA), an adrenalinelike substance, the chemical found inchocolate, speeds up the flow of information between nerve cells and istriggered in the process of attraction to help us pay attention to the lovefeelings. PEA is known as the “love molecule” because it is what initiates theflood of chemicals into the brain along with norepinephrine and dopamine tocreate the feelings of euphoria and infatuation when we are highly attracted tosomeone.Commitment Chemicals—“I Love You” (Oxytocin and Vasopressin)For those of us who have had the wonderful experience of falling in love andbeing infatuated with someone, we also know that this amazing high andtrancelike bliss does not last forever. We either progress into deeper love andcommitment or make the decision to break apart and detach. Neuroscientists havedetermined that after a period of anywhere from six months to two years, thebrain downshifts its response and the production of stimulating chemicals andlevels of neurotransmitters like PEA start to drop off. It is the body’s innatewisdom to turn down the volume because it cannot maintain the lust-crazed stateforever or people would eventually collapse with exhaustion. Several of mycolleagues who do family and couples therapy note that a lot of unnecessarydivorces and relationship breakups can occur during this time because peoplemistake the lack of intensity and euphoria as a sign that they have fallen outof love. Also because individuals may feel a withdrawal from the chemicals ofinfatuation, they may look for other sex partners, alcohol, or other substancesto try to re-create the high. Understanding this phenomenon in advance canreally help partners anticipate this phase and help them move into the nextphase of trust and commitment where true love really begins.Once you find an attractive partner, how does your brain decide if you want tokeep him or her? Commitment is usually harder for men than women. Even thoughour goals are the same (continuity of the species, pleasure, and connection),women are more oriented to raising children. There is not one human societywhere men are primary caretakers for kids. Men and women are wired differently.Women have a larger limbic or emotional brain. It doesn’t mean that men are notessential in childrearing or that they won’t help. They just have differentroles. Unless women have experienced emotional trauma, they are usually moreready to settle down and start a family. Men are often frightened by theresponsibilities involved in raising children and being faithful to one woman,which is easier for men who have lower testosterone levels. An American study ofover four thousand men found that husbands with high testosterone levels were 43percent more likely to get divorced and 38 percent more likely to haveextramarital affairs than men with lower levels. They were also 50 percent lesslikely to get married at all. Men with the least amounts of testosterone weremore likely to get married and to stay married, maybe because low testosteronelevels make men calmer, less aggressive, less intense, and more cooperative. Thedesire to commit to someone is strongly linked to two other hormones ofemotional bonding, oxytocin and vasopressin.OxytocinOxytocin is released by the pituitary gland and acts on the ovaries and testesto regulate reproduction. Researchers suspect that this hormone is important forforming close social bonds. The levels of this chemical rise when couples watchromantic movies, hug, or hold hands. Prairie voles, when injected with oxytocin,pair much faster than normally. Blocking oxytocin prevents them from bonding ina normal way. This is similar in humans, because couples bond to certaincharacteristics in each other. This is why you are attracted to the same type ofman or woman repeatedly. In general, levels of oxytocin are lower in men, exceptafter an orgasm, where they are raised more than 500 percent. This may explainwhy men feel very sleepy after an orgasm. This is the same hormone released inbabies during breast-feeding, which makes them sleepy as well.Oxytocin is also related to the feelings of closeness and being “in love” whenyou have regular sex for several reasons. First, the skin is sensitized byoxytocin, encouraging affection and touching behavior. Then, oxytocin levelsrise during subsequent touching and eventually even with the anticipation ofbeing touched. Oxytocin increases during sexual activity, peaks at orgasm, andstays elevated for a period of time after intercourse. This may also be why menare more likely to talk and feel emotionally connected after sex. In addition,there is an amnesic effect created by oxytocin during sex and orgasm that blocksnegative memories people have about each other for a period of time. The sameamnesic effect occurs from the release of oxytocin during childbirth, while amother is nursing to help her forget the labor pain, and during long, stressfulnights spent with a newborn so that she can bond to her baby with positivefeelings and love.Higher oxytocin levels are also associated with an increased feeling of trust.In a landmark study by Michael Kosfeld and colleagues from Switzerland publishedin the journal Nature, intranasal oxytocin was found to increase trust. Men whoinhale a nasal spray spiked with oxytocin give more money to partners in a riskyinvestment game than do men who sniff a spray containing a placebo. Thissubstance fosters the trust needed for friendship, love, families, economictransactions, and political networks. According to the study’s authors,“Oxytocin specifically affects an individual’s willingness to accept socialrisks arising through interpersonal interactions.” The scientists studiedoxytocin’s influence on male college students playing an investment game. Eachof fifty-eight men was paid $64 to participate in the experiment. The volunteerswere paired up, and one man in each pair was randomly assigned to play the roleof an investor and the other to play the role of a trustee. Each participantreceived twelve tokens, valued at thirty-two cents each and redeemable at theend of the experiment. The investors decided how many tokens to cede to thetrustees. Both participants, sitting face to face, knew that the experimenterswould quadruple that investment. The trustee then determined whether to keep theentire, enhanced pot or give some portion of the proceeds—whatever amount seemedfair—to the investor. Among the investors who had inhaled oxytocin, about halfgave all their tokens to the trustees, and most of the rest contributed amajority of their tokens. In contrast, only one-fifth of the investors who hadinhaled a placebo spray forked over all their tokens, and another one-thirdparted with a majority of their tokens. Oxytocin influenced only the investors.Trustees returned comparable amounts of money after inhaling either spray. Thetrustee responses were generous when the investors offered most of their tokensand were stingy when the investment was small. The influence of oxytocin waslimited to social situations. The oxytocin influence is “a remarkable finding,”says neuroscientist Antonio Damasio of the University of Iowa College ofMedicine in Iowa City in an editorial published with the research report.Damasio had previously argued that the hormone acts somewhat as a love potion.“It adds trust to the mix, for there is no love without trust,” he says.Bonding chemicals can also enhance fertility. Increases in oxytocin haveenhanced fertility in some studies in animals. In humans, increased oxytocinlevels are associated with decreased stress levels and increased trust, both ofwhich are likely to enhance conception.VasopressinOther clues to male commitment come from new research on the hormonevasopressin. This chemical is involved in regulating sexual persistence,assertiveness, dominance, and territorial markings. Not surprisingly, it isfound in higher levels in the male brain. Why do some men constantly live withthe discomfort of a wandering eye, while others remain content with fidelity?The difference may have to do with vasopressin, which has been found in malevoles (little rodents) to make the difference between stay-at-home dads andone-night-stand artists, for example. The voles with a certain braindistribution of vasopressin were monogamous, while others with a differentpattern were not.High levels of oxytocin and vasopressin may interfere with dopamine andnorepinephrine pathways, which may explain why attachment grows as mad,passionate love fades. The antidote may be doing novel things together to goosethe two love neurotransmitters. Elevated testosterone can suppress oxytocin andvasopressin. There is good evidence that men with higher testosterone levelstend to marry less often, be more abusive in their marriage, and divorce moreregularly. The reverse can also be true. If a man holds a baby, levels oftestosterone go down, perhaps in part because of oxytocin and vasopressin goingup.The trust, bonding, and persistence created by oxytocin and vasopressin arecritical for a partnership to succeed. However, the release of these hormones isnot enough by itself to keep two people compatible sexually and romantically. Itis at this time when it is critical for partners to communicate their desiresand needs to each other both in the bedroom and outside of the bedroom, tolisten attentively and be mutually supportive of the bond that has formed fromattraction to commitment. If you haven’t seen it yet, see the movie March of thePenguins for one of the best demonstrations of true commitment.Detachment Chemicals: Why It Hurts (Serotonin and Endorphins)When Shawna and Nick broke up, he was a mess. He couldn’t stop thinking abouther, hearing her voice in his head, feeling her touch on his body, and smellingher scent in his clothes. After being together for five years, everythingreminded him of Shawna, from songs to pictures to movies to waking up and goingto bed. She had been wrapped up in most of the thoughts of his day. A part ofhim was okay with her going away, in fact, even glad. They could never get onthe same page in the relationship, and they had broken up several times before.Nick had the sense that she would not always be there for him and that she wouldgo away if things got tough. Yet despite the deep ambivalence in therelationship, he was still a mess when she left. He couldn’t sleep, he feltconstantly anxious and unbalanced, and he even had panic attacks when thelonging for Shawna overwhelmed him.What happens in the brain when you lose someone you love? Why do we hurt, long,even obsess about the other person? When we love someone, they come to live inthe emotional or limbic centers of our brains. He or she actually occupiesnerve-cell pathways and physically lives in the neurons and synapses of thebrain. When we lose someone, either through death, divorce, moves, or breakups,our brain starts to get confused and disoriented. Since the person lives in theneuronal connections, we expect to see her, hear her, feel her, and touch her.When we cannot hold her or talk to her as we usually do, the brain centers whereshe lives becomes inflamed looking for her. Overactivity in the limbic brain hasbeen associated with depression and low serotonin levels, which is why we havetrouble sleeping, feel obsessed, lose our appetites, want to isolate ourselves,and lose the joy we have about life. A deficit in endorphins, which modulatepain and pleasure pathways in the brain, also occurs, which may be responsiblefor the physical pain we feel during a breakup.Getting a Loved One out of Your Head and the Fishhooks out of Your HeartIn Dean Koontz’s novel Velocity, the killer uses fishhooks to torture BillyWilens, a good-natured bartender who finds himself in a random storm of murderand mayhem. The killer, a twisted psychopathic performer, renders Billyunconscious and plants three fishhooks deep in his forehead. The fishhooks wereextremely painful to extricate, requiring alcohol and painkillers, and they leftdeep scars.When a loved one leaves us, or even when we are the ones who instigate abreakup, many of us feel like Billy Wilens. We have deep wounds, like fishhooks,that leave lasting scars. Many of us use alcohol or any sort of painkillers(such as drugs, sex, or excessive work) to medicate the pain. I have firsthandknowledge of what it takes to survive the painful loss of a love. I have leftrelationships and I have been left. Being left is definitely harder.On one occasion after being left, it felt as though I had many fishhooks in mymind and my heart that were painfully pulled whenever I remembered any goodthing my lost lover had done for or with me. Pictures, songs, friends, cars,names (she had a common name), cities, pillows, and restaurants all reminded meof her. I was a neurochemical mess for nearly six months. I even scanned myselfin the middle of the process to see what grief looked like in my brain. Itshowed excessive anterior cingulate gyrus activity (not normal for me), whichwas partially why I felt so sad and obsessed.From my own experience and work with patients who have lost loved ones, here arefive tips to survive and eventually thrive through the loss of a love. 1. Above all, stay healthy. At first, we just want to medicate the pain. We eator drink too much, stop exercising, wallow, and isolate ourselves. Stop thatbehavior immediately. Watch what you eat, exercise more, not less (exercise hasbeen found to be as effective as the antidepressant Zoloft for depression), andspend time with your friends. Make sure you get enough sleep. During my breakup,sleep was very hard for me. The supplement kava kava was helpful on a short-termbasis. 2. Do not idealize the other person. Whenever we just focus on someone’s goodqualities, the pain increases; when we focus on his or her bad qualities, thepain decreases as we are glad to be rid of them. Spend time to write out the badtimes and your ex’s bad points. Whenever we lose someone we love, there is atendency to exclusively remember the wonderful things about her. Idealizingpeople impairs the grieving process and makes us hurt more. Be balanced. You donot have to vilify them, but be honest about their bad qualities and focus onthem to help soothe the pain. One helpful technique I found during the loss of apainful love was to make up a mnemonic that helped me remember her badqualities. That way, when the fishhook memories pulled painfully at my heart, Icould immediately remember, and silently repeat to myself, why I was glad shewas gone. For example, if her name was Hanna, you could use the letters of hername to label the bad or irritating qualities: Hanna could stand for . . . Hairy lipArgumentativeNever able to say she was sorryNo memorable sexAmbivalent about our relationship You may need these memory skills in the midst of grief to remember why you arehappy someone is gone. 3. Cry, then hide the pictures. In the beginning of the breakup, take some timeto allow yourself to feel the pain. Crying can be a wonderful release of thebuilt-up tension in your limbic brain. But after a good cry, eliminate theconstant triggers to your nervous system. Go through the house, your computer,and workplace and collect the pictures and gifts, then hide them somewhere. Hidethem initially, rather than burning them, because you never know what willhappen in the future. If you get back together, you will feel terrible abouthaving burnt them. Time will tell. A few months down the line you will makebetter decisions about whether or not you want to keep some of the things thatrepresent your relationship. But, in the short term, get them out of sight. 4. Love must be tough. When you act weak, needy, or demanding during a breakup,you literally push the other person away. You are no longer attractive orappealing. You seem and act as a victim. Being well is not only the bestrevenge; it is the best way to be well. 5. Do “The Work.” Byron Katie has written a wonderful, wise book titled LovingWhat Is. In the book, written with her husband, Stephen Mitchell, she discussesthe power of asking yourself four questions and doing a turnaround. During mybreakup it was the single most helpful technique to get my usually happy,healthy self back. I learned that I suffer whenever I do not accept what is.When I fight against reality, I am out of my mind. Katie teaches you tounderstand the thoughts that cause the suffering, such as “I miss her,” and askfour questions and a turnaround.• Question #1: Is it true? You bet. I miss her terribly.• Question #2: Is it absolutely true? Not absolutely. I do not miss ourambivalence, her resentment, and her disappointment.• Question #3: How do you feel when you have the thought “I miss her”?Miserable, remorseful, stupid, ashamed—which means my thoughts were what wastorturing me, not her.• Question #4: Who would I be without the thought “I miss her”? I would be myusual happy self.Katie says to then turn the thought around—I miss her becomes “I miss me.” Imiss my normal, happy, sound-sleeping, wake-up-singing, healthy, driven,successful self.These four questions and the turnaround can literally change your life. I haveseen it work for many of my patients as well.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lesson #3: The dance of relationships is both chemically and environmentallydriven.

You can’t look at an fMRI ofsomeone and say, ‘That’s an African-American brain, or a Caucasian brain.’ Butyou can differentiate between a male and female brain.”—STEVEN B. JOHNSONWhen Nicole threatened to leave Christopher, she said that their communicationwas like “a square peg in a round hole.” They came to see me on the advice of afriend. Christopher was completely confused during their first session. He hadno idea what she meant. Nicole said that she was tired of him not listening toher, always wanting to fix her, and not being present for her when she neededhim. Bewildered, Chris argued that he loved her, spent hours listening to her,and just wanted to be helpful to her. I watched in pain as this couple playedout a common gender war. I had once been victim of the same drama myself. Whenthe love relationship I discussed in the last chapter ended, the woman used thesame phrase as Nicole, “square peg in a round hole.” Hearing it again, I felt asharp pain sting my heart.Male-female communication styles are radically different, brain-based, andhardwired. Many people think these differences are culturally defined, yet theyappear very stable across almost all cultures studied and have their roots inthe brain. Men and women evolved different brains over millions of years,because of necessity. Men chased down food for their families and providedprotection. Women cared for the young and old, and provided a nurturingenvironment. Because of these different roles, the sexes evolved to processinformation differently, think in radically different ways, expect differentthings, and have different perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors. In the lastforty years, as the gender roles in our society have been blurred, both malesand females have become more and more confused as to what is normal behavior. Weexpect our partners to be able to read our minds and think as we think.Unfortunately, we are just not wired that way.Knowing about the differences between men and women will help you be moreeffective in interacting with the opposite sex and help you navigaterelationships without feeling hurt or rejected. In this chapter I will look athow male and female brains develop, the differences between the left and righthemispheres (which gives us clues to male-female differences), the differencesin language and intuition, and the answers to commonly asked questions. I willalso give males and females eight rules each for effectively dealing with eachother’s brains.Different from ConceptionThe moment of conception determines gender. Males get an X chromosome from themother and a Y chromosome from the father (XY), while females get X chromosomesfrom both Mom and Dad (XX). Inheriting a Y chromosome triggers two bursts ofhormones, mostly testosterone, that change the brain and body. The first burstearly in the womb differentiates the boy’s brain from the girl’s. From early ininfancy, girl brains are more interested in smiling, communicating, people, andsecurity; while boy brains are more interested in objects, actions, andcompetition. With higher levels of testosterone, the male areas of the brain aremore developed, including the parietal lobes responsible for sense of direction,visualizing objects in three dimensions (good for catching a football), andmathematics. Without testosterone, the language centers of the brain are moredeveloped, which is why girls like to talk and boys like to play catch. Inaddition, testosterone beefs up the area of the brain that is interested in sex.This area is twice as large in men as women. He really is more interested insex.The second burst of testosterone during puberty starts to turn a boy into a man.He now has twenty times the level of testosterone as most girls, his testiclesdescend, his voice deepens, his body becomes hairier, he has more well definedmuscles, and he begins to grow like a beanstalk. His mind becomes highly focusedon girls.Since the female brain is exposed to little testosterone, her sexual developmentis very different. Her brain sends a message to the ovaries that it is time forthe body to change. The ovaries begin to make much higher levels of estrogen andother hormones that cause the body to change in shape and size. They get thebody ready for reproduction. Her breasts begin to grow, the nipples get largerand darker, curves begin to form as fat is deposited in the breasts and hips,and hip bones widen, which makes the waist look smaller. Her moods may begin toshift, she becomes much more interested in her appearance, and boys become theprimary topic of discussion.Two Minds in One Brain: Left Versus RightThe brain is divided into two sides or hemispheres, left and right, connected bythree nerve fiber bundles. The largest nerve bundle is called the corpuscollosum. Each hemisphere specializes in certain functions (although there isconsiderable overlap). We call one hemisphere dominant, usually the left side,because it is responsible for handedness and language, and the other sidenon-dominant, usually the right side, because it houses other functions that arenot as obvious. The left hemisphere is dominant in almost all right-handedpeople and about half of left-handed people. For this discussion I’ll refer tothe left hemisphere as the dominant hemisphere and the right hemisphere as thenondominant.The left hemisphere has received bad press through the years—being thought of asthe uptight, materialistic, controlling, unfeeling, and unemotional side of thebrain. In fact, the left hemisphere is likely responsible for human success. Itis analytical, logical, precise, detail oriented, and capable of conceiving andexecuting plans. The left hemisphere has more gray matter, which means a greaterdensity of nerve-cell bodies. The left hemisphere is communicative and timesensitive, breaks down complicated patterns into component parts, and is heavilyinvolved with planning. It is the happy, cheerful, more optimistic side of thebrain. When there is good activity in the left-frontal lobe, people tend to bejoyful and approach their lives with a positive zest for life. When the lefthemisphere is hurt, people are often depressed, negative, and irritable. Sixtypercent of people who have a left-frontal lobe stroke will develop a majordepression within a year. A consistent brain-imaging finding in major depressionis low activity in the left-front side of the brain.The right hemisphere sees the big picture, or gestalt of situations. It allowsus to see the forest, while the left hemisphere is responsible for the trees.The right hemisphere tends to be dreamier and more artistic. It helps usrecognize familiar faces and is responsible for hunches and intuition. It alsosees patterns at a glance. The right hemisphere has more white matter. Itsneurons are connected from farther distances, which help it to draw on severaldifferent brain regions at a time. This allows the right hemisphere to come upwith broad, multifaceted but vague concepts. The right side of the brain alsoallows people to know when problems are present and when they should be takenseriously. Unlike the left side, when the right hemisphere is hurt, people areoften unduly happy, jocular, and in denial of any problems. People withright-sided strokes may develop “anosagnosia,” failure to recognize disablingconditions. In the face of adversity, people with right-hemisphere damage mayappear unconcerned or even optimistic. The right hemisphere tends to be morenegative, fearful, anxious, mournful, and pessimistic. In looking at thedifferences between the left and right hemispheres, it is as though there aretwo individuals in one skull.There are several practical applications of left-versus-right-hemisphereresearch, such as where to stand in a conversation, or what side of yourpartner’s neck to kiss during lovemaking. Due to how our brain processesinformation, if you stand to someone’s right side, you are processed moreprominently in the left side of his brain, the happier side of the brain. If youstand to someone’s left, you are processed more in the right side of his brain,the more anxious and negative side of the brain. Some research indicates thatsalespeople do significantly better when standing to someone’s right. When youask someone to marry you, interview for a job, try to make a sale, or preachfrom the pulpit, stand to the audience’s right side, so that you are processedmore in the happier left side of the brain; you may have a better chance ofgetting what you want. In a similar way, if you kiss someone on the right sideof the body, she likely processes the kiss more intensely on the left side ofher brain, the happier side of the brain, and she is more likely to want you tocontinue. If you kiss her on the left side of the neck, she processes the kissmore intensely on the right side and may feel more bugged or irritated by thekiss. Pay attention to the reactions of others, depending on where you stand andhow you touch them. It may help.Gender Brain DifferencesSeveral of the gender differences in the brain correlate with the left-righthemisphere differences. It has been reported that men have more total brain cellnumbers, even when corrected for their increased total body weight. It has beenestimated that men have 4 percent more neurons than women do. When I state thisfact in lectures, many women groan and complain. I then tell them about a timewhen I was on the Carolyn Davidson radio show in Dallas, when she asked me,“Tell me Dr. Amen, why do men need one hundred grams more brain tissue to getthe same things done as women?” It has been estimated that women have a greaternumber of cellular connections than men.The corpus collosum, a large fiber band that connects the hemispheres, has beenfound in some studies to be larger in women, allowing greater access to bothsides of the brain. Men tend to be more left sided in their approach to life,while women tend to use both sides more often then men. This is very importantin helping us understand the differences between men and women. In language, mentend to be totally left sided, more detail oriented, and more directly to thepoint. Women, more often than not, use both sides, and tend to be more fluent,which may be why they have more to say. When husbands and wives get intoarguments, their brain hemisphere activation styles often make problems worse.Because women use more words, men often become overwhelmed in disagreements andsay insensitive things like “What’s the point?” or “Specifically, what do youwant?” These statements infuriate women and make communication even more of astruggle. They know the point, they just have more to say about it with theextra input from the right side.The female hormone estrogen encourages brain cells to develop more connectionswithin the brain and between the two hemispheres. Because of these extraconnections, women are better at multitasking. They can talk on the phone whilewatching TV, cooking dinner, and checking their e-mail. Men, on the other hand,are more compartmentalized and do best when they do only one thing at time. Whena man stops his car to read a map, he asks everyone else to be quiet and turnsdown the radio. This allows him to focus. His wife usually doesn’t understand,as her brain can do, and actually enjoys doing, many things at a time.Left-sided strokes, which affect the language area, tend to affect men more thanwomen because many women have language on both sides of the brain. In onebrain-imaging study, when asked to judge whether nonsense words rhymed, men usedonly the left side of the brain, where more than half of the women used bothsides. In another study done at the University of Indiana, when listening to anovel being read, men used the left side of the brain, where women typicallyused both sides.The limbic system, or emotional brain, tends to be larger in women. The limbicsystem is the emotional bonding center of the brain. Therefore, it is noaccident that women in overwhelming numbers are the primary caretakers forchildren. Likewise, women are primary caretakers for the elderly; 70 percent ofelderly people who need care get it from a woman. The larger limbic size makesbonding easier for women. Women tend to have more friends in life, they go tochurch more often than men, and they pray (bonding with God) more than men.Women have a larger nesting instinct than men. They have a greater biologicalneed to have their houses in order. When a couple moves, it is generally thewoman who feels unsettled until everything is put away. Women are usuallyprimary caretakers for the home and take on the bulk of housework. With thelarger limbic size comes a greater incidence of depression. After puberty,females are three times more likely to develop depression than males. Womenattempt to kill themselves three times more often than men. Yet men, due to lackof bonding and use of more violent means, kill themselves three times more oftenthan women.In another brain study, the inferior parietal lobe was found to be larger inmen, especially on the left side. This part of the brain estimates time, judgesspeed, visualizes objects in 3-D (such as catching a football thrown towardyou), and solves math problems. Our direction sense is influenced by this partof the brain. Men are usually better at directions. Women, because of theirgreater access to the right hemisphere, are better at knowing when they arelost. Women are also better at knowing when problems are present. Psychiatristssee three times the number of women as men. Not because women have moreproblems, but because women are more aware that a problem exists and morewilling to seek help. Women, more often than men, call marital therapists forhelp with a troubled marriage, and they bring their children to the childpsychiatrist much more than fathers do. Seventy-five percent of the time,divorces are filed by women.Recent research has shown that men may have a tendency to be moreunrealistically optimistic. Unrealistic optimism is the belief that good thingsare more likely to happen to them than other people. If this way of thinkingdominates a person’s thoughts about life, it can have both positive and negativeconsequences. On the positive side, it is associated with better mental healthas people are more hopeful and optimistic even in the most difficult times.However, this can prevent people from taking preventive measures for a negativeoutcome.Sensory SkillsWomen are better at reading facial expressions and noticing the feelings ofothers. Like most mammals, they are equipped with more sensitive sensoryequipment. In a study by Barbara and Allan Pease, authors of Why Men Don’tListen and Women Can’t Read Maps, they found that women were dramatically betterat reading emotions than men. At a maternity hospital they collected a selectionof ten-second clips of crying babies and asked the mothers to watch the clipswith the sound turned down. This way the mother only had the visual information.Most mothers could quickly identify a range of emotions from hunger and pain togas and tiredness. When the fathers took the same test, their performance wasawful, less than 10 percent of fathers recognizing more than two emotions.Grandmothers also faired much better than the fathers, while grandfathers oftendid not recognize their own grandchildren. On the other hand men have showngreater blood pressure reactivity to sexually arousing pictures than did women.Women also have better peripheral vision than men, which is why they catch theirguys looking at attractive women, but hardly ever get caught when they look athot guys. As hunters, guys have better long-distance tunnel vision. Men are alsomore adept at driving at night.From birth, girls are dramatically more sensitive to touch, and as an adult, awoman’s skin is at least ten times more sensitive than a man’s. Women like andneed to be touched more than men. In one study, a woman is four to six timesmore likely to touch another woman in a social situation than a man wouldanother man. A woman’s senses of taste and smell are also more sensitive than aman’s. Men score higher on salty and bitter tastes, while women score higher onsweet and sugary tastes, which explains why there are more female chocoholics.Not only is a woman’s sense of smell better than the average male, during timesof ovulation she is better at picking up male pheromones that cannot be detectedconsciously. The superior sensory equipment of women allows them to pick up bodylanguage, thus dishonesty, much more than men.She Is Thinking, Thinking, ThinkingNeuropsychologist Ruben Gur of the University of Pennsylvania used brain scansto show that when a man’s brain is in a resting state, at least 70 percent ofhis brain is shut down. On the other hand, when women were resting, at least 90percent of their brain was active, confirming that women are always thinking,thinking, thinking. The man wants the remote control and a little peace andquiet; she wants to talk.In another study, when asked to think of nothing, men’s brains were more activein the more primitive physical activity centers of the brain (cerebellum),women’s brain were more active in the emotional and bonding centers of the brain(limbic system). Left to themselves, men will think about sex, their golf swing,or their jump shot; women will think about their spouse, children, or parents.One common complaint from women is that they do not feel connected to theirpartners. Men would do well to initiate conversations about children andparents.As part of a national talk show on the differences between male and femalebrains that I did with gender expert Michael Gurian, author of the wonderfullyinsightful book What Could He Be Thinking?, I performed brain scans on Jenniferand Brad. They had the typical couple complaints. She wanted more time, talking,and attention. She wanted Brad to help around the house and be more present withthe children. He wanted more peace, quiet, and sex. He wanted to be left alonefor a half hour when he got home from work. Their struggles were clearlyaffecting their marriage. The brain scans showed clear differences. Jennifer’sscan, as Ruben Gur’s research would suggest, showed much higher levels ofactivity. Brad’s scan had significantly lower levels of activity. Jennifer’sworries and overthinking in the relationship were a product of a much moreactive brain, while Brad’s need for rest came from his sleepy brain. A greatcouple activity to help balance both these states is physical exercise. For men,exercise wakes up the brain, while for women exercise enhances brain serotoninlevels and calms the overactivity.Sex Is Like Shooting Free ThrowsWhen I counsel couples, I often say that sex is like shooting free throws,hitting a golf ball, learning how to throw a football or a curveball, or hittinga winning tennis serve. Men like sports analogies; women want their mates to payattention. When boys learn to shoot free throws, or become skilled in any othersport, they practice over and over and over again. They repeatedly work on theirtechnique. They spend hours at the free-throw line, figuring out what to do toimprove their stats. Successful athletes have great coaches and they listen tothem. They spend years perfecting their techniques and are not crushed byfailure; rather they use it as an opportunity to learn. They film theirperformances to see how they can improve on technique and outcome.For optimal satisfaction in the bedroom, women would do best to act like a goodcoach, recognizing that it may take your man some time to perfect his technique.Like a good coach, offer encouragement, praise, and advice. Meet him forpractice on a regular basis and make it a fun experience that both of you wantto revisit again and again.Unfortunately, many women have trouble asking for what they want sexually. Theymay tell their man once or twice, often hesitantly, but then never again bringup their wants and desires. Many women I have counseled believe that if a mandoesn’t get it right the first time around, he probably doesn’t really love,care, or want to please her. Training your lover to please you sexually is animportant goal for your overall health. This is especially true for women, astheir longevity is associated with pleasure, not frequency. Men are often slowto pick up the needs of their partner. They do not have the same access toreading social cues as women, so need more direct communication. Men are notborn knowing how to please their partners; they need to be taught, over andover, like shooting free throws. They need good coaches who help them withtechnique and form. And you need to be satisfied; your life may depend on it.The same principle applies to men. Ask what pleases your partner, listen, andpractice. Tell her what you like, encourage her to talk about what she likes.Talk about what you do together that makes you think about her during the daywhen you are apart.Nine Common QuestionsAs I was writing this book, the daytime television show The View did a programon the male brain. Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Star Jones, Meredith Vieira, and JoyBehar wanted to know why men and women were so different. My segment was onafter talk-show-host Donny Deutsch, whom the girls had just roasted. They askedhim how many times he had been married (which was twice), and why his marriageshad failed (he didn’t know), and whether or not he cheated on his wives (no),and what his problem was (he asked if they had a shrink’s couch nearby).Thankfully, they were easier on me. My interview covered nine questions, whichare included below (these are some of the most common questions women ask aboutmen):1. “Is there really a difference between a man’s and a woman’s brain?”Gathering my composure, I said, “Huge differences, and we can prove it.” Here Ipointed to a set of brain scans that we did of a couple at my clinic.“Typically, the woman’s brain is very active. Thinking, thinking, thinking,especially in the emotional part of the brain. The man’s brain, by comparison,is relatively quiet. A woman’s brain is always working and a man’s brain needsstimulation.”Meredith Vieira chimed in, “Seems like little is happening in the male brain.”2. “Let’s get down to specifics. Why do men think about sex all the time?”“The part of the brain responsive to sex hormones is two and a half times largerin men than women. Men are programmed to be more responsive to sexual feelings.Plus, with the lower activity in the brain, men are looking for excitement andstimulation. What is more stimulating to think about than sex?”3. “You say there is a way you can tell which men have more testosterone thanothers. How?”“According to University of Liverpool researcher John Manning, the size of yourring fingers and genitals are directly related to how much testosterone youreceived in the womb; the higher the testosterone level, the longer they are. Infact, looking at the length of ring fingers in comparison to index fingers willgive an idea of the size of a man’s penis. If the ring fingers are longer, itmeans that there were healthy testosterone levels; if they are the same size orsmaller, it means that there were lowered levels. Women can estimate the lengthof a man’s penis by saying, ‘Show me your hands.’ Those who have unusually longring fingers (indicating very high testosterone levels) are at greater risk forautism, dyslexia, stuttering, and immune dysfunction. A large male member maynot be all that great. On the other hand, a male with an unusually short ringfinger is at higher risk for heart disease and infertility. Size matters, but itcan go both ways.”4. “Why don’t men need foreplay like women do?”“Men are always ready for excitement. With the lower activity levels in ourbrain, and higher testosterone levels, it takes little to get us going. LikeHarrison Ford’s character Quinn Harris said in the movie Six Days, Seven Nights,‘All women have to do is show up.’ We are always idling, waiting to be taken fora ride. Women, on the other hand, have so much going on in their brains thatthey need to be soothed, courted, and encouraged to be in the mood. They need amethod to calm down their brains.”5. “Why don’t men ask for directions when they are lost?”“Men do not know that they are lost, even if they have passed the same gasstation four times. Men have less access to the right hemisphere, which showsthe big picture. The right hemisphere allows people to know when a problemexists. Since men have less access, they are often in the dark when something iswrong. It happens in many other situations besides driving, such as admittingthat there is trouble in a relationship (75 percent of the time women are theones who file for divorce or leave a relationship). Men are also singularlyfocused on finding their way. Admitting that you are lost is admitting failure,something men are very poor at doing.”6. “Why don’t men gossip?”“Men do gossip, just not as much as women. Men have language exclusively on theleft side of the brain, while women have language on both sides. Women have moreto say because more areas of the brain are dedicated to language. Men are alsomore interested in sports than in emotional relationships. Sport talk shows arevery popular sources of gossip for men. In conversations, men often get lost inthe amount of words used by women. When it comes to parenting, using fewer wordsis actually helpful. As a child psychiatrist, I have seen that children usuallylisten to their fathers more often than their mothers. In large part, it isbecause men use fewer words than women and they are more serious aboutconsequences to negative behavior. Mothers want children to understand, theywant to be relational with them; fathers want children to comply, like listeningto the coach during a ball game.”7. “Why can’t a man let go of the remote control?”“With the lower overall brain function, a man needs more stimulation. As heflips through channels, he is often looking for something new, somethingdifferent, something exciting. A woman is often content watching a singleprogram, with a relational story line where characters show emotions. She likesto predict what will happen next and needs the continuity to stay interested.The remote control allows a man to surf the wild looking for fair game. Men alsohave shorter attention spans than women. Men are diagnosed withattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) five times more than women.”8. “A recent survey came out and it said that men lie more than women, but thatwomen are actually better liars. Why is that?”“Given the lower brain function, especially in the front part of the brain (alsoassociated with the higher incidence of ADHD), men tend to be more impulsivethan women. They tend to have more affairs and tend to say things without fullythinking it through and often find themselves in hot water. Women also lie, butthey get caught less. One reason, as I mentioned earlier, is that women havebetter access to the right hemisphere and thus read social cues better than men.They notice the small things, like looking away or down or clearing your throat,that are typical in people who are not telling the truth. Since men tend to bein denial a lot of the time, they do not see when their partner is lying.”9. “Why don’t men remember dates like birthdays and anniversaries?”“Men are men. As such they are thinking about providing for their families,competing with other men, and sex. Opposed to women, who are thinking, thinking,thinking about the relationship, men are busy doing. This does not mean theylove less, they just love like men. This often causes them to forget importantdates, even though they try hard not to.”Rules for Men on Women and for Women on MenGiven the latest neuroscience research, here are eight rules to help men andwomen better understand and navigate the brain differences between the sexes.RULES FOR MEN ON WOMEN1. Recognize women are very different from you. Ask her what she needs to behappy and listen. Remember they leave the relationship 75 percent of the time.2. Women typically need listening, not solutions (she is already competent).3. Never ask a woman to get to the point.4. She needs time, talking, and nonsexual touch for foreplay. (Her skin is tentimes more sensitive. Find out how she likes to be touched. Her reality may bedifferent from yours.)5. Just because she catches you ogling another woman does not mean she is notogling another guy.6. On a long trip do the night driving; usually your night vision is better thanhers.7. She thinks it is sexy if you ask for directions. You win her heart by beingwilling to ask for help.8. She has a keener sense of smell. Find out the smells she likes. Does she likeit if you take a shower before bed, or does she like it if you don’t? Find out.RULES FOR WOMEN ON MEN1. Recognize men are very different from you. Ask him what he needs to be happy.2. He can do only one thing at a time. When you want to talk to him, wait untilthe game is over and ask for a specific time to talk.3. Never try to get a man to admit to losing a fight.4. If you want him to really listen, try to use fewer words.5. He is programmed to compete and win. Make him think he wins a lot.6. Just because you catch your guy ogling another woman does not mean you do notdo it as well. It does not mean he finds you less attractive.7. On a long trip do the day driving. Let him drive at night. His night visionis usually better. (And while you are sleeping, it won’t bother you as much whenhe is lost!)8. Many of his senses are not as keen as yours; tell him if odors or tastesbother you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lesson #4: Understanding the differences between the male and female brain helpsprevent misunderstanding and pain and fosters communication and love.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_011_r1.jpg]LOOK CLOSELYimage [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_005_r1.jpg]Brain Imaging Secrets to Enhance Your Love Life“The brain is a tissue . . . it is a complicated, intricately woven tissue, likenothing else we know of in the universe, but it is composed of cells, as anytissue is . . . the connections that constitute the brain’s woven feltwork canbe mapped. In short, the brain can be studied, just as the kidney can.”—DAVID H. HUBEL (1981 Nobel Prize winner)In the winter of 2005, The New York Times Magazine did a story on mybrain-imaging work. In it the writer quoted me as saying if you date one of mydaughters for more than four months, you have to get a brain scan. After thearticle appeared, I received several pieces of angry mail from people around thecountry saying that I used imaging to discriminate against people with mentalillness. One woman wrote that she hoped my daughter married someone with bipolardisorder. Ouch.It is true that if you date my children for more than four months, you get theopportunity of getting scanned. So far, everyone has taken me up on the offer.Inquisitive people want to know. I never use them to discriminate againstpeople, rather as an opportunity to gather more information, like meetingsomeone’s parents or taking them on vacation.Brain imaging teaches us many important lessons regarding sexuality andrelationships. In this chapter I will share six secrets I have learned fromimaging to enhance your love life.Secret #1:There Is More to Love Than Most People ThinkLooking at the brain has taught me that there is so much more to love than mostpeople think. Biological brain influences are extremely important to how wefeel, think, and act. Over the past sixteen years I have conducted brain-SPECTstudies on more than three hundred couples who have had serious maritaldifficulties. I affectionately refer to this group as “the couples from hellstudy.” I have been fascinated, saddened, and enlightened by these images. Ilook at love and relationships in a whole new way (as compatible andincompatible brain patterns). I have come to realize that many relationshipswork or struggle because of healthy brain activity or brain misfires, and theyhave less to do with character, free will, or desire than most people think.Many marriages or relationships are sabotaged by factors beyond conscious oreven unconscious control. Sometimes targeted brain help can make all thedifference between love and hate, staying together or divorce, effective problemsolving or prolonged litigation.Many people, especially some classically trained marital therapists, will seethis idea as radical, premature, and even heretical. But how can we keep thebrain out of the equation of love, sex, and relationships? Frankly, I know of nomarital therapy system or school of thought that seriously looks at the brainfunction of couples who struggle. But I wonder how you can develop paradigms and“schools of thought” about how couples function (or don’t function) withouttaking into account the organ that drives their behavior, namely the brain.Brain-SPECT imaging is a powerful tool to evaluate brain function. It gives asophisticated look into the function of living tissue. Simply put, the imagesgive three pieces of information, showing areas of the brain that work well,areas of the brain that work too hard, and areas of the brain that do not workhard enough. This information then allows scientists to evaluate different brainsystems.One of the fundamental principles underlying our work at the Amen Clinics isthat defined regions and circuits in the brain tend to perform certain tasks,and problems in these areas tend to give specific types of cognitive,behavioral, or emotional difficulties (see Lesson Two for a detailed look atbrain systems). Balanced activity across the brain increases the chances forhealthy behavior, while overactive or underactive areas of the brain can beinvolved in trouble.Secret #2:Whenever There Is Sexual or Relationship Trouble, Think About the BrainThe idea of scanning unhappy couples was born out of frustration and my internalcritical voice. Bob and Betsy brought their two children to see me for schoolproblems. As I worked with the kids, I came to believe that one of their majorproblems was the conflict between the parents. The chronic tension at home washaving a negative impact on the children, causing anxiety, stress, and physicalsymptoms such as headaches, tummy aches, and problems concentrating. I suggestedto the parents that they see me for marital counseling. They told me that theyhad seen four other therapists and it almost always made things worse for them.I was much younger then, more naive, and had the belief that I could help them.Maybe, I thought, they just hadn’t seen anyone really good (through the years Ihave learned that thoughts like this one are usually a sign of immaturity ornarcissism on my part and often a predictor of trouble).In my office in our Northern California clinic, where I saw them, I have twonavy blue leather couches. On Bob and Betsy’s first visit, and every weeklyappointment thereafter for the next nine months, they sat on opposite ends ofeach couch. That is a bad sign in marital therapy. After seeing this couple forthree months, I started to hate them. Nothing I did with them seemed to make anydifference. In my psychiatric training, my main supervisor said my biggest flawwas that I wanted patients to get better fast. I needed to be more patient. Idislike feeling ineffective. I thought to myself that Betsy had a PhD in grudgeholding. She would go on and on, talk about the same things over and over, andbe unable to let go of hurts from the past. Things from fifteen years ago stillbothered her. I once thought that she would not only beat things to death, butalso beat them into the afterlife as well. Betsy was married to a man I call“the sniper.” He earned that nickname because he rarely seemed to be payingattention. Yet, whenever Betsy would settle down in her complaints, Bob wouldsay things that were so evil, so nasty, just to get her going again. It seemedlike he was purposefully revving her up. After six months of seeing this couple,I started to get physical stress symptoms on the day of their appointment. Mystomach would hurt and my shoulders would get knotted. With no change in theirmarriage by the ninth month of therapy, all of us were feeling frustrated.One day I was taking a shower getting ready to come to work and realized thatthey were on my schedule that morning. My stomach started to hurt. “Damn,” Ithought, “these people are in my shower with me. Today I am going to tell themto get divorced.” I had actually been having that thought for several months.Research shows that it is better for children to be from divorced homes thanfrom homes with chronic conflict. My problem with the thought about divorce,however, was that I grew up very Catholic. Not a little Catholic, but a lot! Iattended Catholic school and was an altar boy for many years. We prayed therosary every week on the way home from Grandpa’s house. Even though I was nolonger a practicing Catholic, I still lived with the Catholic voice in my head,commenting on my thoughts and actions. After I had the thought “Today I am goingto tell them to get divorced,” the internal Catholic voice yelled, “What!Because you are not a good enough therapist, you are going to tell these peopleto get divorced and damn their eternal souls to hell!” I just started to stareat the water faucet wondering, “How much therapy does this take to get over?” Igot out of the shower, dried off, and reached for the telephone. I called myfriend who owned the imaging center and said, “Hey, Jack, will you give me twoscans for the price of one?”He asked why.I said, “I have this couple I have been seeing and have no idea how to helpthem. I am hoping to get some clues from their scans.”“Couple? You want to scan a couple,” he said at first with disbelief and thencuriosity. “How interesting! You know I have been married twice and I cannotfigure it out. Maybe we could even start an Internet dating service and call itbrainmatch.com.”When I presented the idea of the brain imaging, the couple was very interested.They were obviously aware that things were not getting better. Plus they wouldnot have gotten divorced if I had suggested it. They wanted to be married. Afterall, I was the fifth marital therapist they saw.Their scans literally changed their lives and mine as well. The woman’s scanshowed marked increased activity in a part of the brain called the anteriorcingulate gyrus, which is the brain’s gear shifter, allowing the brain to gofrom idea to idea and task to task. When it is overactive, people tend to getstuck on negative thoughts and behaviors, such as worrying or holding grudges.Just by random chance, if you believe in random chance, the night before herscan I had read an article in the American Journal of Psychiatry that reportedincreased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus is calmed by Prozac. I putBetsy on Prozac. Bob’s scan showed low activity in his prefrontal cortex when heperformed a concentration task, a finding very consistent withattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). At the time, in 1991, I wasconsidered one of the experts in ADHD. I was very irritated that I had missed itin Bob. I put Bob on Ritalin. I told the couple to take a month off therapy toallow time for the medications to work (and for my stomach and the Catholicvoices to settle down). When they came back a month later, for the first timethey sat on the same couch. Betsy had her hand on Bob’s leg, which is a goodsign in marital therapy. Now, fifteen years later, they are still married, haveanother child, and get along better than ever. I call this better marriagethrough biochemistry.The work with this couple caused me to rethink my work with all of the couples Isaw. How many of their problems were learned behavior? How much was brain? Howwould I know unless I looked? Obviously, because of costs and availability ofimaging, I couldn’t scan everyone, but when I was struggling with complex cases,scans became invaluable. Over a decade ago, my friend and colleague psychologistEarl Henslin started sending many of the couples he saw to my clinic. He said ofthe first forty cases he sent to me, thirty-nine remained married years later.Secret #3:Something Completely Unexpected May Be Causing TroubleLooking at the brain has taught me that there may be completely unexpectedproblems causing trouble for couples. The following story highlights thisprinciple.Dave and Bonnie saw a psychologist for marital therapy for three years. It was afrustrating endeavor. Try as they might to get closer, nothing seemed to work.The therapy sessions were filled with blaming, bickering, frequent explosions,and a general sense of unhappiness. The therapist, who was very experienced,tried and tried, yet nothing worked. After considerable thought the doctordecided to give the couple an F in marital therapy. She told Dave and Bonniethat in her opinion it was time for divorce. When the couple protested, as theyhad spent years of effort and over $25,000 trying to get better, the therapistsaid there was one more option. She told them about the work at Amen Clinics,where some of her most difficult clients had been helped.After an evaluation we performed brain-SPECT scans on the couple. Dave’s brainscans looked shriveled and full of holes, the same pattern that we see in drugor alcohol abusers. The scan was odd, because in his history Dave said he didn’tdrink and never used drugs. To make sure, in front of Bonnie, I asked Dave if hewas drinking heavily or using drugs. He said no, and repeated that he didn’tdrink and never used drugs.I turned to Bonnie for more information, knowing that alcoholics are often indenial and drug abusers often lie. She said, “He is right. He doesn’t drink andas far as I know has never used drugs. That is not his problem, Dr. Amen. He isjust an asshole.”I chuckled at her comment. But internally my mind started to race. If he was nota drinker or drug abuser, then why did he have such a toxic-looking brain? Iwent through the different potential medical causes in my head: braininfections, near-drowning episode, hypothyroidism, anemia, and environmentaltoxins. My friend psychiatrist Harold Bursztajn, co-director of the Psychiatryand Law Program at Harvard, often says that scans are usually not the answer,they teach you to ask better questions. My next question to Dave was, “Where doyou work?”He replied, “I work in a furniture factory.”“What do you do there?” I asked.“Finish furniture.”“Is there good ventilation in the room?” Oh my goodness, I thought, Dave has adrug-affected brain from the solvents he was using at work; even though he hasnever willfully used drugs, they are eating away his brain. Dave just thinks heis being a good provider to his family, while his brain is being poisoned.“No,” Dave said, “it is often hot and reeks with fumes.”“Do you wear a mask?” I asked.“No, they tell me I should but I don’t think it is important.”“Ouch,” I said. “You really should.”My next question was to Bonnie: “When did he start becoming an asshole?”She thought for a moment. “We were not always unhappy. We have been married forfifteen years. It just seems that the last eight were hard. The first years weregreat. He was so different.”Then Bonnie had a look of “Aha” wash over her face. “Dave started to work at thefurniture factory eight years ago. Do you think his personality change can befrom his job?”“You bet,” I answered. “Something is eating away his brain, and eating away hisability to be kind, thoughtful, empathic, and to love you.”Working with this couple has been an amazing lesson in the brain-loveconnection. I took Dave out of work for six months and would only allow him toreturn to a nontoxic job at the plant. Bonnie developed empathy for her husband,who before in her mind was just an asshole but who had become someone in need ofhelp and understanding. When behavior does not make sense, it is important toconsider brain health issues as a potential cause of the trouble. When peoplehave issues concerning their behavior, the brain is an important place to look.Research done on brain-injured patients revealed that over one-third of themsuffer from depression. In addition, of those people suffering from depression,three-quarters also had anxiety issues and exhibited aggressive behavior.image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_012_r1.jpg]Secret #4:Think About Scanning Potential Partners or Taking Their Brain Science HistoryWhen I was single, whenever I dated someone new, I tacitly took a brain sciencehistory. I wanted to know as much about how her brain worked as I wanted to knowhow her body felt next to mine. If I thought the relationship had the potentialof going further, I asked her to get a scan. Most women had no problem with theidea. In fact, when women really understood my work, most were curious andwanted to know more about themselves. The idea of scanning someone was never torule them in or out; it was to gain a better understanding of the issues thatmight face us in a serious relationship.One of my close friends, Will, had been dating a new woman he met on Match.com.He really liked her and felt they had great chemistry but he was concerned abouta number of issues. She tended to run late, was disorganized, lived on the edgeby riding motorcycles, and was prone to starting fights between them. As much ashe liked her, she was not easy for him to be around. She suspected herself thatshe had attention-deficit disorder. Her scan showed very low activity in the PFCwhen she tried to concentrate, which is a common scan finding of ADD. The deeperunderstanding of his potential mate allowed Will to make a more informeddecision about what he wanted to do with the relationship.Another friend, Katie, started dating a man, Ben, she had met through herprofessional circle of colleagues. Again, the chemistry was powerful, but shewas concerned with his tendency to argue and be oppositional. It never felt easybeing with him. She felt on guard a lot and she was often chastised by her newboyfriend for what seemed to her like minor offenses. After first refusing toget scanned, he later agreed. His scan showed excessive activity in his anteriorcingulate gyrus. His brain tended to get stuck in the loop of negative thoughtsand behaviors. Recognizing the problem after seeing his scan, and admitting ithad been a problem in other relationships, Ben took a supplement (5-HTP) to calmthis part of the brain. Subsequently, the couple got along much better.Since most people do not have access to scans, taking a brain science historycan be of great value. I’ll discuss this more in the next chapter.Secret #5:Brain Health Becomes Part of the RelationshipMy imaging work has led me to want a better brain. I have personally beenscanned ten times over fifteen years. As people age, the brain usually becomesless and less active. In my case, my brain has improved over time, because Ihave taken personal brain health seriously. In my relationships, whether withfriends or potential partners, eventually everyone ends up being scanned. Theimaging work generates intense interest. Most people want to know aboutthemselves and how their own brain works. If one of my friends gets scanned,brain envy starts to invade his or her consciousness. She wants a better brain.She becomes more likely to eat in healthy ways, exercise, take supplements, wearher seat belt, and avoid too much alcohol or caffeine. As brain health entersher consciousness, it is easier for us to be together. We share a common goal,brain health. Ordering at restaurants becomes a collaborative effort andspending time together turns into more walks and word games than getting drinksat a bar.Secret #6:Scans Generate New IdeasScans generate new ideas and new ways of thinking about relationships. Irecently saw a troubled couple. The husband was bipolar and his wife had gottento the point where she couldn’t stand his behavior anymore. Sex was one of theareas of discontent. She came in for the first time on a joint visit to add someinformation about how he was doing. Within one minute of being with her, I feltvery uncomfortable. Her tone of voice had frequencies in it that made me uneasy.I thought it needed to be recorded so we could study the brain reactions ofothers. Years ago, my colleague and coworker Dr. Leonti Thompson saw a number ofmen who had killed their infants in a fit of rage. His research brought upseveral cases where tests had shown that the frequencies of infant criestriggered seizurelike activity in the temporal lobes, arousing feelings ofanger. If the wife and husband in this case were to be scanned when the wife wastalking to him, I wondered if we would see his temporal lobes fire abnormally inresponse to her irritating frequency.I once scanned a man who lit his ex-wife’s house on fire at Christmastime. Hewas on trial for arson. His initial scan showed mild trouble in his lefttemporal lobe (an area of the brain associated with violence). Then, I scannedhim while he listened to a message from his ex-wife. During this scan his mildleft temporal lobe abnormality became severe, providing us with evidence thather voice triggered a negative reaction in his brain. Without the scans I wouldhave never been able to see this connection.The following story was contributed by my friend Barbara Wilson, a neurologistand pain specialist in Austin, Texas. The case illustrates how brain imaging andchanges in brain function alter behavior, which may be positive or negative.“I had a very nice man who had a facial tic. It was just on one side. He smokeda lot of pot because it made his headaches not as bad. I initially trained as amovement-disorder doc—and one-sided tics must be scanned for tumors, even if therest of the physical exam is okay. I got into trouble for ordering the MRI—theguy was in an HMO and they figured he had tics for at least three years so noimmediate testing was necessary—but I stuck to my training and ordered the scan.The patient had a large frontal lobe tumor with a little spot of calcifiedbrain. In neurology that little calcified spot upsets one greatly because itindicates that the tumor probably started out as benign, which would have beencured if it had been taken out earlier.The really interesting part of the story: His girlfriend and I had a long talk.She spoke of how much fun he was—not inhibited like other guys. He was such a“unique spirit—free, wildly sexual, and unreasonably happy with no rigidboundaries like most guys” she knew . . . . Basically she was in love with thepersonality of someone without much of a frontal lobe. The girlfriend wasdevastated that this special wonderful man was diagnosed with a severelylife-shortening tumor. Ironically, if he had not had the tumor, his personalitywould not have been attractive to the girlfriend. Consistent with the effects ofsome brain lesions; the guy wasn’t that bothered by his impending death.Actually it kind of clarified things: He could just spend all his money on drugssince he didn’t need to worry about long-term wealth accumulation. I worriedmore about the girlfriend, destined to go through life looking for another guywith a frontal lobe tumor.This story illustrates how our sexual lives are tied to brain function. Whetherwe are outgoing, uninhibited, uptight, or afraid has to do with themoment-by-moment function of the brain. Looking closely at brain function opensa new world of possibilities for explanations about behavior and potentialtreatment enhancers.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lesson #5: Looking at the brain can enhance your love life.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_013_r1.jpg]USE YOUR BRAIN BEFORE YOU GIVE AWAY YOUR HEARTimage [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_005_r1.jpg]Warning Signs of Trouble“Know when to walk away, And know when to run.”—“The Gambler,” KENNY ROGERSHave you ever made stupid decisions about love? I mean really inane, insane,unbelievably stupid decisions. I have, and some of those decisions have turnedout to be very painful. I am never someone who feels as though I have it alltogether, but in the past I have felt as though I was smarter than I actedregarding some of my romantic decisions. And I have been curious about theseless-than-stellar decisions for a long time. Can neuroscience help us understandthe decisions we make about love? Can it help us know when to hold someone, whento walk away, and when to run? Decisions about love can help extend your life;as a group, people who are happily married live longer. Decisions about love canalso ruin your life, through emotional pain and bankruptcy, and, in some cases,end it through suicide or murder. Decisions about love have potential life anddeath implications.Warning Signs Around the Oasis of LoveWhen we fall in love, many people experience what I call the Oasis Effect.Coming out of the desert of being alone and longing to be in a relationship thathelps them feel more complete (as humans we are wired to be intimately connectedto others), many people find that new love feels like an oasis of beauty andnourishment. When we fall in love, there is a large release of the bondinghormone oxytocin. This chemical has been found to increase our sense of trust,even in situations where perhaps we should be more cautious. Similar to thedusty, dirty, lonely, and thirsty desert traveler who is euphoric upon findingthe oasis, falling in love feels unlike anything else, exciting, fulfilling, andsatisfying. When first coming out of the desert, travelers are often so ecstaticto find the waters that they fail to see anything else. Their anxious state ofeuphoria causes them to overlook or ignore warning signs around the oasis, suchas diseased animals. Those who have drunk from those same waters were sickened,evidence of the poison along the edges of the oasis. So, too, in love, when wecome out of the desert of aloneness, we are often so happy, with love chemicalscoursing through our brain, that we fail to see the trouble before our eyes, themetaphorical dead animals around the oasis of love. Here are two examples.EricEric and Becky were in a tumultuous marriage for ten years. Eric had thoughtabout getting divorced for the last five years they were together. They had seeneight different marital therapists without much help. One day, after going to afriend’s twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, Eric decided he had had enough andsaw an attorney. There was no way he wanted to stay in a marriage filled withdistance and pain for fifteen more years. Even though the divorce was painful,Eric knew it was the right decision. In dating Becky, Eric had ignored manywarning signs of pending trouble. Nowhere in school are people taught to noticeproblematic signs in a relationship. Becky had been severely sexually abused byan alcoholic father. When dating Eric, she failed to tell him of the tension,turmoil, and abuse at home. Without psychological help to process the pain of anabusive past, intimate relationships for an abused person are usually impaired;even with help, it can be a long road. In dating again, Eric vowed it would bedifferent next time and he would make better choices for himself. Yet, his nexttwo relationships were filled with turmoil and pain, prompting Eric to come andsee me.In describing his relationship with Becky, Eric said it was like living in adesert. Becky was not only volatile, she was almost always sexually withholding.Eric said his sexual advances were rebuffed nine times out of ten and he livedin a chronic state of frustration.His first relationship after his divorce was with a beautiful, smart, highlysexualized model, Monica. For the next eight months he felt happier than he hadever been, so he and Monica moved in together. Then the poison in the oasisstarted to make Eric sick. Eric and Monica started to fight. Monica spent moneyafter agreeing not to, hiding it from Eric. Sex, which was free flowing in thebeginning, was now being withheld. And Eric started to catch Monica in a seriesof lies. Even though there were several significant signs of trouble before theymoved in together, the bliss of the sex and the hope of finding a lasting,healthy love blinded Eric to the reality of the situation. He failed to see thewarning signs:Monica had a young child who did not live with her, usually a sign of trouble.One of Monica’s friends told Eric that she lied a lot and could not be trusted.Monica’s oldest child told Eric that she had gone through six of her mother’srelationships and breakups, and that the last time she didn’t come home in orderto avoid the fights.Eric’s children always felt very uncomfortable around Monica.In addition, Monica had posed nude for a famous photographer. Eric wasfascinated by her ability to do this work without embarrassment. One of the nudephotos hung in their bedroom. However, Monica wanted to put her second nudephoto in the living room. When Eric said no way (they both had children!),Monica had a huge fit.Sex and hope for lasting love can cause blindness, even in very bright people.After his breakup with Monica, Eric decided to take time off to discover what hereally wanted in a relationship. He felt emotionally wrung out and had very goodreason not to trust his own judgment. Then, through the Internet, Kate came intohis life. He felt she was different. She was sweet, present, loving, andseemingly sincere. Even though the sex was routine, it was ever present, and sheseemed emotionally healthier than Monica. It felt like another oasis, where thewater was cleaner and more refreshing. But the warning signs were again ignored.Both of Kate’s parents struggled with alcoholism.Kate resented her father, whom she said loved her brothers more than her. Thisfather-daughter dynamic usually causes women to resent other men they start totrust.Kate had left two husbands, blaming them for the problems in the relationship.She said upfront that she cheated the IRS and never reported her cash income.The first few months of the relationship were great; then Eric and Kate wentthrough a series of breakups and getting back together, which was always Kate’sidea. When things didn’t go her way, she left again.Now the warning signs became flashing-red-neon signs. Still Eric ignored them:Kate started pushing Eric to be more committed than he felt ready to be.Kate never once said she was sorry or asked for forgiveness during any of theirdisagreements. It was always Eric’s fault.Kate never seemed satisfied or happy with Eric. When they finally broke up forgood, Eric felt as though he had fallen off a cliff. He was in such emotionalpain that he felt as though his skin was being ripped from his body without anyanesthesia. He couldn’t sleep for six months; he experienced crushing chestpain; felt obsessed with the thought of Kate; had suicidal thoughts for thefirst time in his life; and despaired of ever having a healthy relationship.That’s where I came in for Eric. He needed to do a better job at seeing thosedead animals around the oasis of love. Make no mistake; Eric was a big part ofhis own trouble. He was drawn to women whom, like his father, were distant anddisapproving. Unconsciously, he found these women the most exciting. He tendedto avoid women who were happy with him. His anxiety and actions subtlyencouraged these women to take advantage of him, such as providing significantfinancial support without clear guidelines on what he expected in return. Healso tended to set them up to be perceived as critical like his father by beingexcessively hurt by their criticisms rather than being able to hear them and tryto improve. The work in therapy was about seeing his role in the demise of theserelationships and helping him see the warning signs around any potential newlove so he could be more cautious when he gave his heart away.JenniferCan you see the warning signs?Through the Internet Jennifer met John for dinner on the day after Christmas. Hewas single, had never married, was forty-six years old, and had a history ofshort-term relationships. When he met Jennifer, he just melted. He said he couldnot even talk in her presence and did not want to be apart from her. Thatevening he invited Jennifer to go to Paris with him the next day, which she didnot do. By New Year’s Eve they were talking up to eight hours a day, totallyimmersed in each other. From the moment he came back from Paris, ten days later,they were never apart for the next two months. Jennifer was totally taken withJohn. He was handsome, successful, highly intelligent, young minded, funny,charming, and independent. And, very important to Jennifer, he had the nameJohn. For years, she was convinced that John was the name of her true soul mate.When they met, both of them dove right in without holding back. Jennifer lovedthat he wasn’t afraid to love her. Little did she know about the pain thatawaited her.John was the most generous man Jennifer had ever met. If he gave her flowers, hebrought four bouquets, not just one. He never went shopping for himself withoutthinking of her and buying her something. He was abundantly generous with hiswords and affection. He constantly talked about how much he loved her, how muchhe loved holding her, retelling the story of their meeting over and over againand how special and new this “feeling” was. He asked her to marry him within twoweeks. He told her that she was the woman he had been waiting for. He had beenwaiting for “this feeling” and now knew why he had never married. Whatever wasgood, he’d reinforce by talking about it all the time. They talked for hoursabout how great their relationship was.After two months, Jennifer decided she needed some space and would not sleepover at his house. John became irate. The relationship quickly started tounravel. He liked Jennifer when she was a sweet, soft, loving girl, but when sheacted like the assertive woman she really was, he became angry and controlling.Their fights about their troubles went on and on. He had a challengedrelationship with his own depressed mother, who often did not talk to him, whichmay have been why he needed to talk about problems for a long time. Initially,the relationship was so thrilling that Jennifer jumped in the water withouthesitation. When the warning signs flared, she ignored them because she did notwant to lose the hope of this new love.Jennifer started to realize that everything had to be on his turf and his way orthere was a huge power struggle. He was overly sensitive to her every move,gesture, tone, and mode of communication. If there was something Jennifer didthat he didn’t like, she would hear about it for hours . . . basically until sherecognized the error in her ways and repented. One night, after another fight,she went home. A few hours later John came over, violently banging on the dooruntil Jennifer opened it. Then he got furious at her because she wasn’t excitedto see him. They went into therapy, but after a few sessions the therapist sawit as hopeless.The hope of love often blinds us to the reality of the situation. Losing hope ispainful. Living in a mismatched relationship is usually much more painful thanbeing alone.Look Before You DrinkBefore you give away your heart, use your brain. Notice the warning signs andany evidence that there will be potential trouble at the oasis of love. Neverexpect perfection, as there are very few perfect people in the world. But lookfor toxic symptoms. All of us have some trouble in our past; but how much andhow severe is a score worth noticing. Here is a list of questions aboutpotential new relationships to help you see any warnings.• Do you often feel in trouble when you are with the other person?• Is he or she disappointed in you a lot?• Are you pushed to go faster than you are comfortable?• Are your friends or family concerned about the relationship?• Do you have a nagging, internal voice saying that there is trouble brewing?• Are you ambivalent?• Is there a past history of many short relationships? This indicates troublecommitting or the constant need for someone new and exciting in his/her life.• Is his/her behavior inconsistent?• Does he/she blame everyone else for his/her problems?• Does he/she have trouble telling the truth?• Does he/she never apologize?• Do his/her own children say negative things about him/her?• Do your kids feel uncomfortable around him/her?• Is there any drug abuse?• Does he/she cheat the IRS?• Are there temper problems?• Does he/she act in a demeaning or belittling manner?• Is there evidence of alcohol abuse?• Do you lose yourself in his/her presence?• Do you find yourself trying to mold yourself more and more to make him/herhappy?• Does he/she come forth with interest and then suddenly withdraw and becomeunavailable?Taking a Brain Science HistoryWhen evaluating whether or not a person is a suitable partner for you, assesshow his or her brain and psyche work. Can you really do this without a scan?Yes. Through the questions we ask ahead of time at the Amen Clinics, ourhistorians are uncannily accurate in predicting what the brain scans of ourpatients are likely to look like. We assess brain function by asking the rightquestions. You can, too. I believe it is essential in dating to obtain extensiveinformation on a potential mate before you give away your heart. Think aboutusing your head to protect your heart.What kind of questions should you ask? What follows is the outline of the majorsections of the Amen Clinic Adult Intake Questionnaire that we use to take thehistories of patients who come to our office for help. I will give you tips onhow to gather this information and how to ask insightful questions. None ofthese questions need to feel intrusive. Do not ask them in rapid-firesuccession, but rather weave them into the give-and-take of many conversations.Ask them over the first month of dating someone new. Write down their answers inprivate to obtain a detailed history and fill in the gaps as needed. Anyone whoobjects to this type of probing likely has something to hide.ACI Adult Intake Topics1. Why Are You Here?In this section we ask people why they came to the clinic. What is the problem?For daters, you need to know what the real purpose of the date is. What does theperson really want? This is a critical question to answer. Is the person lookingfor a one-night stand, a friend, a long-term relationship? Do his or her goalsmatch your desires?2. What Have You Done in the Past to Fix the Problem?In this section of the questionnaire we ask patients about past attempts to fixthe problem for which they are seeking help. For daters, you want to learn abouttheir past dating experiences. How have they attempted to meet people? What hasworked and what hasn’t?3. Medical HistoryHere we ask about a patient’s physical health. We ask about general health,current and past medications, surgeries or hospitalizations, past head injuries,sexually transmitted diseases, and allergies. In dating, you want to know thespecifics about the health of a person. A good way to ask these questions is bystarting off with your own health history and then asking about theirs. Thehealth of someone’s brain usually influences the potential health of theirrelationships. Be curious. Past head injuries may help explain impulsive orerratic behavior. None of the information gathered needs to be the finaldecision on ruling someone in or out, but it can help you make a more informeddecision in the context of the whole relationship.4. Past Psychiatric HistoryHas the person ever been diagnosed or treated with a psychiatric illness, suchas ADD, anxiety, or depression? According to the National Institutes of MentalHealth, 49 percent of the United States population at some point in their liveswill meet the criteria for a mental disorder. It is almost more normal to have aproblem than to not have a problem. I never think this should rule someone in orout. But you need to know. If someone has a condition, you absolutely want toknow as much as possible about it.5. Current Life StressesIn this section we ask about the current stresses in a person’s life, such asfinancial, health, work, or family issues. It helps us to understand the wholeperson and perhaps why they are having problems at this time. The currentstresses in a person’s life are something worth knowing for potential daters.What is stressful or difficult in the person’s life at the moment? A friend ofmine once dated a woman who had serious financial problems. She was still beingsupported by an ex-boyfriend who continued to have sex with her as an exchange.It was important information for my friend to know. This can also be a place toask potential partners about financial stability. Even though this is anuncomfortable topic, it is critical nonetheless. Financial issues are one of themost common sources of stress for couples. Truly understanding a person’sattitude and behavior toward money can tell you a lot of information about aperson’s judgment and how he or she deals with responsibilities.6. Sleep BehaviorSleep issues are explored in this section, including nightmares, recurrentdreams, insomnia, and any current problems in getting up or going to bed. Insexual relationships sleep is a very important issue. Is the person a lightsleeper, so any snoring might bother him or her? Is there chronic insomnia, sopartners cannot sleep together, which is a very common problem?7. School HistoryWe want to know all about school. It is such an important part of someone’slife. Here are some questions to ask. What did you like and not like aboutschool? What did your teachers say about you? What were your best and worstsubjects? What were your biggest frustrations and joys in school? How far inschool did you go? Do you have further educational goals?8. Employment HistoryLikewise, we want to know all about a person’s work history. Work says a lotabout a person. Some questions to consider asking include: What were yourfavorite jobs? Worst jobs? What would past employers say about you? What is yourdream job? What are your work goals?9. Legal HistoryThis section explores any legal or criminal issues. For a potential partner itis a good idea to know if there are any ghosts in the legal past, such asbankruptcies, divorce proceedings, child-custody issues, arrests, criminalcharges, and convictions. Even though it seems obvious to ask, sometimes we areblinded by the light of the oasis and fail to do so. If you are in doubt, checktheir background, which can be done easily on the Internet.10. Sexual HistoryThis is often an uncomfortable subject, even for psychiatrists. But it isessential to understanding a person’s life and psyche. It is crucial to know thesexual history of your potential mate. Here are some potential questions toconsider. Age of first sexual experience? Number of sexual partners? Any historyof sexually transmitted disease? Any abortions? Any history of molestation,sexual abuse, or rape? Any current sexual problems? Any fetishes or particularbehaviors I should know about? What is your attitude toward pornography?11. Drug and Alcohol HistoryThis is a critical part of our intake process. Even with us, many patients lieabout their drug and alcohol usage. Of all the issues that damage relationships,drug and alcohol abuse are near the top of the list. Moderate to heavy use ofdrugs or alcohol likely predicts trouble in the future because they damage brainfunction. Whatever damages brain function damages life function as well. Askcandid questions, listen to the answers, and observe the person’s behavior whenyou are together. Questions we ask about drug and alcohol usage include: Howmuch alcohol do you drink? What other drugs have you used? What is your currentusage? Has anyone ever been concerned about your drug or alcohol usage? Have youever felt guilty about your drug or alcohol use? Have you ever felt annoyed whensomeone talked to you about your drug or alcohol use? Have you ever used drugsor alcohol first thing in the morning?12. Significant Developmental EventsIn this section we want to know about the events that help shape a person’scharacter. Here we want to know about marriages, separations, divorces, deaths,traumatic events, losses, abuse, and also biggest joys, greatest moments, andsuccesses. Listen to the events that highlight your potential mate’s past.13. History of Past Marriages and Romantic RelationshipsThis section helps us understand how people connect to past intimate lovers andpartners. It is important to know about a person’s history in relationships. Dothey blame others for all the problems or have they learned from their ownmistakes? What have been the issues, patterns, joys, and sorrows in pastrelationships? The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. Howpeople have been in the past is likely how they will be. This is not alwaystrue, but true enough that you want to know past patterns.14. Family History (Parents, Siblings, and Children)Family history is one of the most important sections of our intake process. Manybrain problems, such as ADD, depression, alcoholism, or bipolar disorder, aregenetic and tend to run in families. Understanding a person’s family usuallygives you good insight into their own character and vulnerabilities. Listen tofamily stories. Specifically, try to understand the relationship between apotential partner and his or her mother and father.How did he or she get along with his or her mother (which is usually the primarybonding relationship)? This relationship usually sets the tone for all otherrelationships for males and females. A positive maternal-child bond helps thebrain feel more settled as it develops; a strained maternal-child bond causesstress hormones to disrupt development. How did he or she get along with his orher father (another crucial relationship)? What about the relationship withsiblings, and children? Meet his/her family and watch the interactions betweenthem.15. SpiritualityIt is unusual for many psychiatrists to ask about a person’s relationship withGod or his sense of meaning and purpose in life. Yet, I feel these are veryimportant topics to discuss. This is certainly a critical issue inrelationships. When people are matched in their sense of meaning and purpose,with their beliefs in God or a higher power, their relationships tend to behappier and more mutual. Ask your potential mate about current beliefs in Godand religion. What was he or she taught growing up? What does he or she believeare the influences of these beliefs on other aspects of life? What is his or heroverall sense of meaning and purpose in life? Why does life matter? Thesequestions often stimulate great discussions. If not, that is more informationfor you to have in evaluating the relationship.BrainMatch.com and Internet DatingInternet dating is the rage, and rightly so. Bars are definitely not the bestplace to meet someone, especially if you are into brain health. Workplaceromances are often trouble from the start. And friends and family can only setyou up so much. The Internet works because you are meeting people who want to bemet—people who are ready, willing, and available (if they are not lying). Peopleon dating sites help you sift through important information. They tell you whatthey like, don’t like, their habits and interests. You can see how they write,how they think, and how creative or not they are. I have many friends andpatients who have made great use of Internet dating.Of course, there are dangers to Internet dating as well. One of myeighteen-year-old patients from Northern California met a man from West Virginiaon the Web. They talked for hours, got engaged, and he sent her a train ticketto be with him. When she told me all of this in a therapy session, the father inme freaked, and the psychiatrist part of me called a family meeting. I had themother and father come into our session and we discussed the pros and cons ofthe pending move. When the girl broke off the trip and the engagement, the manthreatened to kill her. We later found out he had just been released from jail.Children, teenagers, and some young adults need to be protected from the seedyside of the Internet. As sex and gambling can become addictive, so can Internetdating. I have known people who spend hours a day searching for the perfectdate. They can’t stop and it affects every aspect of their lives, includingtheir jobs and relationships with their children.From a neuroscience perspective, here are a few tips for safer Internet dating:1. Really look at the photos posted. If they contain pictures of motorcycles,fast cars, or skydiving, it is likely the person is excitement seeking (perhapslow in PFC activity). If more than one of the pictures has alcohol in it, beconcerned about drinking.2. Look for the truth. Many people lie on Internet dating. If they lie in thatsituation, they are likely to lie in others. Lying breeds mistrust. If a personlies about his age, income, desire for children, be concerned. Lying is adeal-breaker.3. Talk to them on the telephone and by e-mail at least three times. Be patient.Get to know someone before you let them know where you live. Remember the movieFatal Attraction?4. As in all dating, be careful about moving too fast. Dopamine chemicals arebeing pumped out fast and furious in the first few months of a relationship.Falling in love can be so powerful that we ignore the potential pitfalls. Useyour head and your heart when you fall in love. When emerging from the desert,be sure to take care of yourself. Pack your own canteen full of water so thatyou are less dependent on the oasis. Pay attention and take your time beforedrinking the water.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lesson #6: Notice the warning signs in a potential new relationship—use yourbrain and your heart when you fall in love.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_014_r1.jpg]THE BRAIN IS A SNEAKY ORGANimage [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_005_r1.jpg]Addictions, Weird Sex, Fiends, and Fetishes“The brain is a sneaky organ.”—JERRY SEINFELDDoes your brain play tricks on you? Surprise you? Torture you? Appall you? Minedoes. Even at the most inappropriate times. I can be sitting in church, tryingmy best to be thoughtful, prayerful, spiritual, and close to God, and then thenext moment my brain notices the rear end of the young woman in front of me.“Stop it,” my superego yells.“Oh, please, just one more quick look?” My brain pleads.“No, you are in church.”Or, I can be out to dinner with my sweetheart, having spent the day planning tomake it a special evening for us, and then ruin it all by noticing for a halfsecond too long the young, bouncy waitress with the ample cleavage walking bythe table. Poof, the evening is ruined. “What’s the matter with me?” I think, “Idid not want the waitress, I wanted my sweetheart.” Also, I can be driving intraffic and wonder what it would be like to drive into oncoming traffic or slaminto the car next to me. Ouch! Or, I can be walking in a grocery store, noticesomeone carrying an armload of boxes, and wonder what it would be like to ticklethe person. Yuk? The list goes on and on from suicidal thoughts (“What wouldthey think if I jumped off the balcony and splattered myself on the ground?”),to homicidal thoughts (“How would it feel to shoot that person in the face?”),to strange thoughts (“I wonder if it would be erotic to watch anteaters havingsex?”). Before you think I am abnormal or just plain sick, I have been listeningto these “sneaky thoughts” from my patients for more than twenty-five years. Weall have them. They just sneak up on us without planning. I was walking recentlywith a friend, one of the sweetest, most thoughtful women I know. She told meabout a time when one of her daughter’s friends was being irritating and she hadthe thought of pouring a jug of milk over her head. Of course, she didn’t do it,but the thought ran through her brain nonetheless.What causes our brain to have these bizarre, silly, or unhelpful thoughts? Whatcauses our brain to be sneaky? The limbic or emotional brain is alwaysgenerating possibilities, novelties, and interesting hypotheses. Like dreamstates while awake, the brain is constantly churning, imagining, and playing.Thankfully, we have an area of the brain called the prefrontal cortex (PFC),which inhibits these sneaky thoughts and prevents us from saying them or actingupon them. When this part of the brain works right, it can laugh at or dismissthese sneaky thoughts. When there is damage or disease to this part of thebrain, these hurtful, embarrassing thoughts surface in our behavior.I was once at a conference with a close friend of mine, Jillian. She hadexperienced a car accident several years earlier that hurt her PFC. She had areputation for saying exactly what was on her mind without filtering itscontent. Two obese women sitting in front of us at the conference were engagedin a spirited conversation about their weight. One woman said to the other, “Idon’t know why I am so fat, I eat like a bird.”Jillian looked at me and said loud enough for everyone around us to hear, “Yeah,like a condor.”I looked at her in total embarrassment. Horrified, Jillian put her hand to hermouth and said, “Oh my God, did that thought get out of my mouth?”Yes, I nodded.“I’m so sorry,” she said as the women moved away from us.The brain is a sneaky organ. From minor gaffs, to embarrassing moments, to alifetime of trouble, the brain is in the center of our behavior.PFC DamageDamage to the PFC can happen in a number of different ways, such as through ahead injury, some form of toxic exposure, or later in life through diseases ofaging, such as dementia. The most common cause of dementia that is associatedwith difficult behavior is called frontal temporal lobe dementia (FTD). Peoplewith this type of dementia are more likely to act like Jillian. In a study fromUCLA, researchers examined patients with FTD and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).Typically, early in the illness FTD affects the front parts of the brain, whileAD affects the back parts of the brain. When damaged, the front parts of thebrain are more involved in poor judgment and a decreased control over one’sactions. Researchers studied both groups for sociopathic behavior, evaluated thecharacteristics surrounding their acts, and compared the groups onneuropsychological tests and brain-imaging studies. There were twenty-eightpatients in each group. Sixteen (57 percent) of the FTD patients had sociopathicbehavior compared to two (7 percent) of the AD patients. Sociopathic acts amongFTD patients included such things as unsolicited sexual acts, trafficviolations, and physical assaults. When interviewed, the FTD patients withsociopathic acts were aware of their behavior and knew that it was wrong butcould not prevent themselves from acting impulsively. They claimed remorse, butthey did not act on it or show concern for the consequences. Among FTD patientswith sociopathy, brain-imaging studies showed right prefrontal cortexinvolvement. The PFC helps us supervise our behavior and control the sneakythoughts most of us have.I have treated patients with FTD who started sexually abusing children. Thesemen had no prior history of bad behavior. I have treated others with late-onsetPFC disorders who developed unusual sexual behaviors. One case was particularlysad. A pastor of thirty years underwent brain surgery for a tumor to his PFC. Hetook time off from his position in the church. At first the operation seemed asuccess and the pastor went back to work. Then gradually over the next year, hisbehavior started to become bizarre. He had temper issues at church and was lessreliable than before. Through his church he developed a friendship with aseven-year-old boy. Over time the relationship turned sexual. When he wascaught, the whole community was stunned. The investigator for the case saidthere was absolutely no evidence of this type of behavior prior to the surgery.Yet, because of his position of trust, the judge gave this pastor thirty yearsin prison.Tourette’s SyndromeOther areas of the brain besides the PFC can also be involved in sneakybehavior. The PFC helps us think about and supervise our odd behaviors. Thebasal ganglia and anterior cingulate gyrus can also fire abnormally and wreakhavoc. Tourette’s syndrome is an example that involves both of these systems.People who have Tourette’s syndrome (TS) have uncontrollable urges to move theirmuscles (tics) or say exactly what is on their mind. They can control the urgesfor a while, but like tension on a rubber band that needs to be released, theurge builds until it has to be set free. TS is classified as a tic disorderwhere people have both motor (involuntary muscle movements) and vocal tics(involuntary vocalizations). Examples of motor tics include shoulder shrugging,leg movements, hip thrusts, excessive blinking, eyebrow raising, facialgrimaces, head jerking, punching, and even sexual gestures. Examples of vocaltics include puffing, blowing, throat clearing, whistling, animal noises(barking, mooing, crowing), and swearing (termed corprolalia). Several years agoI spoke for the Tourette Syndrome Foundation of Canada on the island ofVictoria. I spoke in front of four hundred people who had TS. It was more thaninteresting to speak in front of that many with tic disorders. In the audiencethere were people who were barking, whistling, and jerking. It taxed my abilityto stay focused on my talk.During the middle of the lecture someone blurted out, “Fuck you.”Taken aback, I just ignored him.A few minutes later, it happened again: “Fuck you” came from the audience.Now, I started to sweat. What should I do?One more time, “Fuck you,” came even louder.I couldn’t stand it anymore and said, “Is that a tic? Or don’t you like thelecture?”The man blushed and said it was a tic. But how is a speaker really to know?TS is a treatable disorder, with medication and behavioral therapy. Withouttherapy it can ruin lives. David Comings, MD, a researcher at the City of Hopein Los Angeles, writes in his book Tourette Syndrome and Human Behavior, thatfamilies of Tourette’s sufferers tend to have other unusual behaviors. Thesehave included unusual sexual behavior, violence and abuse (especially within thefamily unit), obsessive compulsive tendencies, anxiety disorders, manicdepression, and even psychotic symptoms. TS highlights that there are underlyingmechanisms in the brain that correlate with impulse control disorders.Obsessive-Compulsive DisorderObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is similar to TS. In fact, about half thepeople with TS also have OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder affects somewherebetween two to four million people in the United States. This disorder canimpair a person’s functioning and often affects a person’s sexuality. OCD isoften a disorder secretive to the outside world, but not to those who live withthe person. The hallmarks of this disorder are obsessions (recurrent disgustingor frightening thoughts) or compulsions (behaviors that a person knows make nosense but feels compelled to do anyway). The obsessive thoughts are usuallysenseless, repugnant, and invasive; they are sneaky and may involve repetitivethoughts of violence (such as killing one’s child), contamination (such asbecoming infected by shaking hands), doubt (such as having hurt someone in atraffic accident, even though no such accident occurred), or sexuality (such asunusual acts with children or animals). Many efforts are made to suppress orresist these thoughts, but the more a person tries to control them, the morepowerful they become.The most common compulsions involve hand-washing, counting, checking, touching,and masturbating. These behaviors are often performed according to certain rulesin a very strict or rigid manner. For example, a person with a countingcompulsion may feel the need to count every crack on the pavement on their wayto work or school. What would be a five-minute walk for most people could turninto a three- or four-hour trip for the person with obsessive-compulsivedisorder. They have an urgent, insistent sense inside of “I have to do it.” Apart of the individual generally recognizes the senselessness of the behaviorand doesn’t get pleasure from carrying it out, although doing it often providesa release of tension.The intensity of OCD varies widely. Some people have mild versions, where, forexample, they have to have the house perfect before they go on vacation or theyspend the vacation worrying about the condition of the house. The more seriousforms can cause a person to be housebound for years. I once treated aneighty-three-year-old woman who had obsessive, sexual thoughts that made herfeel dirty inside. It got to the point where she would lock all her doors, drawall the window shades, turn off the lights, take the phone off the hook, and sitin the middle of a dark room trying to catch the abhorrent sexual thoughts asthey came into her mind. Her life became paralyzed by this behavior and sheneeded to be hospitalized.New research has shown a biological pattern associated with OCD. Brain-SPECTstudies have shown increased blood flow in the basal ganglia and anteriorcingulate gyrus (ACG). The ACG is involved in allowing a person to shift his orher attention from subject to subject. When this area is overactive, a persongets “stuck” on the same thought or behavior.Like most forms of psychiatric illness, OCD has a biological basis, and part ofeffective treatment often involves medication. At this writing there are eight“antiobsessive medications” and there are more on the way. Before 1987 therewere no good medications to treat OCD. The current medications that have showneffectiveness with OCD are Anafranil (clomipramine), Prozac (fluoxetine), Zoloft(sertraline), Paxil (paroxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Luvox (fluvoxamine),Celexa (citalopram), and Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate). These medications haveprovided many patients with profound relief from OCD symptoms.In addition, behavior therapy is often helpful for these patients. This is wherea patient is gradually exposed to the situations most likely to bring out therituals and habits. Behavior therapy also includes thought-stopping techniquesand strong urging by the therapist for the patient to face his or her worst fear(for example, having a patient with a dirt or contamination fear play in themud).There is a group of disorders that have been labeled as Obsessive CompulsiveSpectrum Disorders. It is based on the premise that these disorders occurbecause the person experiences repetitive unwanted thoughts or behaviors. Theytend to get stuck on thoughts and cannot get them out of their minds unless theyact in a specific manner. OCD spectrum disorders include trichotillomania(pulling out one’s own hair), onychophagia (nail biting), Tourette’s syndrome,kleptomania (compulsive stealing), body dysmorphic disorder (unreasonablyfeeling a part of the body is excessively ugly), compulsive shopping,pathological gambling, fetishes, and sexual addictions.In the past decade the Internet has brought a whole new meaning to pathologicalgambling and sexual addictions. Both are on the rise with younger and youngerpeople. The term addiction used to be used exclusive to chemicals such asalcohol, drugs, or nicotine. With recent research on the brain, we nowunderstand that many behaviors can become as chemically addictive as asubstance. Gambling and pornography can be such an addiction.Pathological gambling includes all betting behaviors that interfere or hurtpersonal, family, or work-related activities. The essential features of agambling addiction include:• increased preoccupation with gambling• a need to bet more money more frequently• restlessness or irritability when attempting to stop• “chasing” losses• loss of control, manifested by continuation of the gambling behavior in spiteof increasingly serious negative consequences• in extreme cases, financial ruin, legal problems, loss of career and family,and even suicide.According to the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, the nationallifetime prevalence of gambling is no less than 1.2 percent of the totalpopulation (2.5 million). In longstanding gambling markets such as Nevada, morethan 5 percent of the population will develop some problem with gambling, aprevalence rate about five times that of schizophrenia and more than twice thatof cocaine addiction.Youth are more troubled and addicted than adults. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) isnot fully developed until age twenty-five, making it much more likely that teensand young adults will have problems controlling their impulses. According to theNational Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, the following are the prevalencerates among youth groups: 16 to 24-year-old males, 4 percent; 11 to 18-year-oldmales, 4 to 7 percent; national average, all ages, 1.2 percent.Sexual AddictionsSexual addiction can encompass a wide variety of activities. Sometimes a sexaddict has problems with just one undesirable behavior, sometimes with many.According to Sex Addicts Anonymous, a high percentage of sex addicts think thattheir unhealthy use of sex has been a progressive process. It may have startedwith excessive masturbation, the use of pornography, or a sexual relationship,but over the years it progressed to increasingly risky behaviors. The coreproblem with sexual addictions, like all addictions, is the feeling ofpowerlessness or helplessness over a compulsive behavior, resulting in aperson’s life becoming unmanageable or out of control. Addicts typicallyexperience shame, guilt, and self-loathing. The addict tries to stop, but isunable to do so. The consequences are often severe, including terminatedrelationships, problems at work, arrests, financial troubles, a loss of sexualinterest in anything not associated with the addiction, low self-esteem, andfeelings of hopelessness.The preoccupation with sex takes up tremendous amounts of energy, draining timefrom other activities and responsibilities; as this intensifies, behaviors orrituals follow, which usually leads to more troubled behavior, such as searchingthe net for pornography, lying about sex, or secretive flirting. There isusually guilt over the behaviors, followed by shame, despair, and confusion.Here are six questions to consider if you think you may have a sexual addiction:1. Do you keep dark secrets about your sexual activities from those who shouldknow? Do you lead a double life?2. Do you frequently feel remorse, shame, or guilt after a sexual encounter?3. Is it taking more variety and frequency of sexual activities than previouslyto bring the same levels of excitement and relief?4. Have you ever been arrested or are you in danger of being arrested because ofyour practices of voyeurism, exhibitionism, prostitution, sex with minors,indecent phone calls, etc.?5. Do your sexual activities include the risk, threat, or reality of disease,pregnancy, coercion, or violence?6. Has your sexual behavior ever left you feeling hopeless, alienated fromothers, or suicidal?If the answer to any of these questions is yes, professional help may be inorder. See an expert in sexual addiction.In a study performed by my colleagues Mark Laaser and Richard Blankenship on sexaddicts, the PFC was clearly involved. The researchers used the Amen ClinicBrain System Checklist, a questionnaire I developed based on our brain-imagingwork, with seventy patients who met the diagnostic criteria for a sexualaddiction. In addition, I performed brain-SPECT studies on eleven of thepatients. The results of the survey were that 67 percent of the participantsshowed prefrontal cortex problems. Fifty percent of the participants hadanterior cingulate gyrus issues (a tendency to get stuck on negative thoughts orbehaviors, like addictions). There was also a high association between limbic(mood issues) and basal ganglia problems (anxiety issues). On the SPECT scans,eleven out of eleven patients with sexual addictions showed low activity in thePFC.Here is an example of a sex addict. Joseph had been married eighteen years whenhe came to see me. During his marriage he had many affairs and spent excessivemoney in strip clubs and on Internet pornography sites. Even though he did notwant to be divorced, and his wife was threatening to leave him if he didn’tstop, he felt he had little control over his sexual behavior. Joseph had afamily history of substance abuse and addiction, common among sex addicts. Whenhe was arrested for soliciting sex from an undercover vice police officer, hesought treatment for his sexual addiction. Traditional psychotherapy wasineffective. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurologicaldisorder that often affects the PFC and that is highly responsive to certainmedical treatments, was suspected and he was sent to my clinic for anevaluation. His scans showed marked decreased prefrontal cortex activity. He wasprescribed stimulant medication and placed on a brain healthy program (healthydiet, exercise, fish oil, and vitamins). With his medical treatment in place, hesought the help of an expert in sexual addiction. Joseph is now ten years soberfrom his sexual addiction. He and his wife have renewed their wedding vows andcontinue to do well.Like Joseph, people with ADHD are likely to engage in some form of addiction.According to ADHD expert Wendy Richardson, “It is common for people with ADHD toturn to addictive substances such as alcohol, marijuana, heroin, prescriptiontranquilizers, pain medication, nicotine, caffeine, sugar, sex, cocaine, andstreet amphetamines in attempts to soothe their restless brains and bodies.Using substances to improve our abilities, help us feel better, or decrease andnumb our feelings is called self-medicating.” Treatment of ADHD and otherunderlying disorders affecting the PFC substantially increase the efficacy oftreating addictive disorders.Unusual SexIn the movie There’s Something About Mary, the main character, Mary, was stalkedby Dom when she attended Princeton University. Dom’s obsessive behaviors led torestraining orders. In addition, Mary had to change her name and buy all newshoes. Dom had taken all of her footwear. At the end of the movie Dom finds Maryonce again. He is seen passionately clutching several pairs of her shoes asMary’s friends are pulling him off her. Dom is clearly over-attached to hershoes.Can neuroscience help us understand these deviations, paraphilias, and fetishes?Unusual sex can have elements of both obsessive-compulsive disorder (repetitivethoughts or behaviors that feel as though they are out of control), andattention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (associated with impulse controlproblems). Obviously, there is more to the story, as most people with OCD orADHD do not engage in these behaviors. Imaging and brain chemistry findings canhelp uncover some the reasons behind these behaviors.Sexual excitement is an individual experience; things that some people findstimulating are not the least bit interesting to others. Within a culture thereare sexual norms that most individuals and couples incorporate into their ownlives. Outside the range of these norms lies an area of more unusual sexual actstermed paraphilias or perversions: sneaky thoughts that get played out inactions. The word paraphilia, coined by Sigmund Freud, has Greek origins. “Para”meaning along the side and “philia” meaning love. It has been estimated that menoutnumber women with a paraphilia 20:1, indicating that brain sex differencesand hormonal factors are likely involved. The medical definition of a paraphiliaconnotes sexual deviance, perversion, or abnormality. It is seen as a medicalproblem only if the behavior interferes with relationships, health, work, orlegal status or causes significant emotional distress. Culturally bound limitsdistinguish between normal and deviant sexual practices. Here is a list ofcommon paraphilias and fetishes.COMMON PARAPHILIASExhibitionism: exposure of genitals to a strangerFetishism: use of nonliving objects, such as Mary’s shoesFrotteurism: rubbing against a strangerHyphephilia: fabricsKlismaphilia: enemaMasochism: pain, humiliation, or punishment of selfNarratophilia: erotic talkPedophilia: childrenSadism: psychological or physical suffering of anotherStigmatophilia: body piercing or tattooingVoyeurism: observation of others undressed or in the act of sexual activityTransvestic fetishism: cross-dressingOTHER TYPES OF PARAPHILIASAcrotomophilia: amputee partnerAsphyxiophilia: self-strangulationAutonepiophilia: diaperismCoprophilia: feces or defecatingMysophilia: filthUrophilia: urine or urinatingZoophilia: animalsFetishesA fetish, defined as “an excessive or irrational devotion to some object oractivity,” such as Dom’s attachment to Mary’s shoes, becomes a problem whenpeople become dependent on the object or practice. It can be an inanimateobject, such as shoes, or an animate object, such as feet or breasts. People usevarious things to achieve sexual excitement. A fetish is when that objectbecomes the preferred or exclusive method of achieving excitement.TYPES OF FETISHESShoes: boots, high heelsClothes: leather, jackets or pants, suspenders, underwear, bras, raincoats,lace, silk, and nylonBody parts: Buttocks, breasts, legs, elbows, ears, feetProfiles in FetishesI Like to WatchWatching unsuspecting people engaged in sexual activity or getting undressedholds an air of appeal to voyeurs because they are aroused by the chance ofgetting caught watching. They seek excitement, often as a way to stimulate anunderactive brain. Exhibitionists find excitement in revealing their genitals tostrangers, also considered an impulse-control disorder. A sixty-five-year-oldman with dementia displayed this kind of behavior and was arrested five times,within one year, because of complaints regarding indecent exposure. Dementiaoften results in a disinhibition due to frontal-lobe deficits.Vacuuming to DeathThe tools of masturbation are as varied as people’s imaginations. I have heardand read stories about vibrators, ice cream scoopers, butter knives, anold-fashion whisk, serving spoon, hairbrush, toothbrush, pillows, stuffedanimals, pens, candles, dildos, tampons, towels, bedding, bottles, cell phones,curling irons, hot dogs, salami, Popsicles, and fruit. The list goes on and on.One case, however, stands above the rest in weirdness. A seventy-seven-year-oldman was found dead in his bathroom due to a heart attack. Next to his body wasfound a vacuum cleaner and hair dryer. Both these electrical devices were stillon and the man’s underpants were actually found lodged in the hose of thevacuum! More than likely, these appliances were used autoerotically duringmasturbation.Don’t Try This at HomePeople will go to almost any means to get sexual pleasure, even strangling orasphyxiating themselves to near death, or in some cases, death itself. For some,inducing a lack of oxygen to the brain while masturbating enhances sexualexperience. The ways to choke off one’s air supply are innumerable. For thispurpose people have used hanging or choking devices, such as ropes, electricalcords, ties, belts; constricting devices around the chest or abdomen; plasticbags covering the face; toxic gases or chemicals that are inhaled; or partial ortotal submersion in water, known as aquaerotic asphyxiation. The problem withthis sort of excitement is that hundreds of deaths each year result from thisbehavior. Sometimes the release mechanisms fail, sometimes people do not knowwhen to quit. This paraphilia can affect people of all ages. In one study of 132people, 6 were in their fifties, 2 in their sixties, and 1 in his seventies.This practice may continue throughout life; frequency may lessen with age, butthe motivation behind the behavior may never be completely gone.Stop Being a BabyParaphilic infantilism or autonepiophilia, also called diaperism, is the desireto be a baby and to talk and act the way an infant does. Onethirty-five-year-old man employed in law enforcement was affected with thisdisorder his whole life. While at his job he did not feel like a baby and noneof his colleagues knew about his desires, he dressed like a child when going outinto public. His desire to become a baby began around the age of twelve. It canbe postulated that the threat of sexual maturity caused regression. Hisinfantlike behavior involved wearing diapers, eating baby food, sleeping in acustom-sized crib, and sucking on a pacifier. While wearing diapers he wouldurinate and defecate in them as a child would and, at other times, he wouldmasturbate while wearing them. This case is an extreme side of a disorder thatcan be looked at as a spectrum ranging from infantile obsession tosadomasochistic behaviors involving domination and discipline.Unusual PlacesLike other orifices in the body, many objects have been used to stimulate theanus and rectum. The oldest reported case dates to the sixteenth century when aforeign object that was inserted into the rectum became lodged, and at that timeremoval of the object was not possible. To this day, physicians find themselvesextracting objects from the rectum, sometimes requiring surgery. Such was thecase of a sixty-three-year-old man who inserted a salami into his rectum.Twenty-six percent of those admitted to the hospital for foreign bodies in theirrectums required surgery. Reports of patients seen in an emergency room for thisproblem vary and do not occur only in young people. In a large study of thesepatients seen at USC and UCLA Medical Centers between 1993 and 2002, the meanage was 40.5 years old. Other reports include an elderly woman at a nursing homewho reportedly inserted utensils into her rectum. She said she was “diggingherself out” and had been doing so for years, which caused her long-termconstipation and stool incontinence. A sixty-five-year-old man who describedabdominal pain had an inverted glass jar lodged in his rectum, which eventuallyrequired surgical removal.Can You Say Mooo . . .Zoophilia, or bestiality, is usually condemned as animal abuse and outlawed as acrime against nature. Scientific surveys, however, have shown that it is morefrequent than most people would think. One to two percent, and perhaps as manyas eight to ten percent, of sexually active adults have had significant sexualexperience with an animal at some point in their lives. In the past, bestialitywas particularly hated for the fear that it would produce monsters. Just overhalf of U.S. states explicitly outlaw sex with animals. In some countries lawsexisted against single males living with female animals. For example, an oldPeruvian law prohibited single males from having a female llama. The Bibleclearly prohibits bestiality. Leviticus 18:23 says, “And you shall not lie withany beast and defile yourself with it, neither shall any woman give herself to abeast to lie with it: it is a perversion.” And 20:15–16 continues, “If a manlies with a beast, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the beast. If awoman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and thebeast; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.”A commonly reported starting age for bestiality is at puberty, which isconsistent for both males and females. Those who discover an interest at anolder age often trace it back to memories or feelings that developed during thisearlier period. As with human attraction, zoophiles may be attracted to onlyparticular species, appearances, personalities, or individuals, and both theseand other aspects of their feelings vary over time.A colleague of mine from North Dakota once treated a man who had an obsessionwith heifers (young cows). It started when he was nine years old. While milkinga cow, the scent and feel aroused him. Later that day he masturbated to theexperience. Thirty years later he had had sex with more than five hundredheifers, but no human females. He had the cows perform oral sex on him byplacing peanut butter or honey on his penis.In October 2005, a Bangladeshi man was sentenced to three months in jail afterpleading guilty to charges of bestiality in the United Arab Emerites. The camelinvolved in the case was put down in accordance with Islamic law. A courtofficial said the man, who worked as a driver, had been spotted going into hisemployer’s barn on a regular basis. His employer became suspicious as his dutiesdid not involve him dealing with animals. The employer followed his driver intothe barn one day and saw him starting to have sex with a female camel. The ownerlost his temper and started beating him. He then took him to the police stationto press charges. The driver confessed to police that he had fallen in love withthe camel and had sex with the animal.Anatomy of a Fetish and the Arousal TemplateAccording to sex addictionologist Mark Laaser, PhD, “the arousal template”underlies many sexual fetishes and paraphilias. The theory of the arousaltemplate says that it is important to understand where you were and how old youwere when you experienced your first sexually arousing experience. This oftenlays the neural tracts for later excitement, even if the experience happened asearly as age two or three. The first experience gets locked into the brain, andwhen you get older, you seek to repeat the experience because it was the way youhad the initial arousal, like the first time you fell in love, used cocaine, orhad to cope with pain. Here are several examples,Adam, a forty-five-year-old stockbroker, grew up with an incredibly demeaning,shaming mother who gave him no love and acceptance. Four little girls lived nextdoor to him when he was growing up. The little girls often came over to hishouse to play. They usually wore white socks and black patent leather shoes.When Adam got married, his fetish was that he wanted his wife to wear laceydresses, patent leather shoes, and look like a little girl. It took him back tothe arousal template of playing with the neighbors. His wife was initially okaywith the sexual play, then not, as he wanted it every time to get an orgasm.Gary also had a harsh and critical mother, plus an alcoholic dad. He grew up inTexas playing rodeo with a neighboring girl. They tied each other up as part oftheir play. It gave him a sense of control and pleasure, control he did not haveover his erratically behaving mother or father. When he became sexually activeas an adult, he wanted to tie women up, which eventually turned into an S&Mfetish.Lucy was an adult woman whose fetish was being spanked, slapped, and tied up.When she was five years old her father sexually molested her, including digitalpenetration. When she told her mother about the abuse, she was slapped becauseshe didn’t want to hear about it. The arousal template got mixed up withmessages of pleasure and pain.When Fred was a little boy, he was molested by an uncle. He felt ashamed andfurious. As an adult he got married and loved his wife deeply, but also went toadult bookstores that had video booths. He would invite strange men into thebooth and offer to do oral sex on them. When they dropped their pants, he wouldgo into a rage and beat them up. His behavior was attempting to right a pastwrong.For children raised in the 1950s, there were some mothers who were overconcernedwith their children’s bowel regularity and gave them frequent enemas. If it wasarousing to them, they would later insert objects into their rectum. I oncetreated a patient whose mother subjected him to frequent enemas. He was also acoffee addict. Twice a day he would brew coffee, put it in an enema bag, insertit into his rectum, and then masturbate.At age thirteen, a boy was coming out of the shower naked and looked out thewindow toward next door. In the window he saw a woman washing the dinner dishes.She saw him and smiled at him. Subsequently, he would shower at the same timeeach night hoping to get a smile from the woman next door. As an adult he becamea male exotic dancer and would also pose nude for art classes.Chuck was a church pastor who got caught looking at porn, exclusively of Asianwomen. He had served in Vietnam in 1965 and 1966 as a medical corpsman. It wascommon for him to deal with death and disfigurement. For R&R he went to themassage parlors in Tokyo where he wanted only local women. He was emotionallylocked into these women from dealing with the trauma and stress of wartime. Partof the arousal template occurs when you go through a stress, such as somethingthat happened at an earlier point in life. Subsequent stress can trigger how thesexual arousal helped you escape the earlier turmoil.The arousal template can happen later in life. For example, when a young collegecouple was driving home from a concert and the woman was masturbating herboyfriend with her feet; he ejaculated in front of a woman for the first time.Subsequently he became obsessed with feet. He collected woman’s running shoesand took pictures of female marathons, but only of the women’s shoes. He had acollection of two hundred pairs of female running shoes and wanted his wife towear them as a part of sex. They came into treatment because she discovered himlooking at Internet foot pornography sites.Further DynamicsOne of the doctors in my clinic, Leonti Thompson, has extensive forensicexperience. He was the former chief of psychiatry for the Department ofCorrections in the State of California. In his role with prisoners he examinedand treated many sex offenders. Often his work involved trying to explainseemingly bizarre and/or offensive behavior in a way that could help to providea basis for more objective dispositions of the inmates. He found that explainingthese unusual behaviors from a developmental point of view was helpful. In thisexplanation he explained that libidinal/sexual drives—not yet given a definitivesexual categorization in the immature brain—could be attached to a variety ofactivities based on co-occurring emotionally laden experiences. These involvedthe tying together in the brain patterns that were out of the ordinary. Anexample comes from Victorian schools in which (probably sadistic) teachers wouldemphasize caning problem boys on their buttocks. As adults a number of these menwould go to receive their “discipline” from the ladies in the leather boots andwhips. He explained that the sexual receptive areas in the brain overlap theareas receiving stimuli from the rectal areas and with punishment an associationwas set up between those two areas. There was confusion then between pleasureand relief from pain. As the individual matured, the previously undifferentiatedlibidinal valences became more clearly defined as erotic. Pain and sex becameconjoined in the mind and relief from pain and pleasure also became conjoinedand confused. In this way one could understand how masochistic experiences mightbe related to sex.Dr. Thompson has seen a number of patients at our clinics who have sexualproblems involving legal considerations, and explanations to the families arehelpful. He uses brain-SPECT imaging findings to explain relevant brain dynamicsas the obsessive aspects represented by the anterior cingulate gyrushyperactivity, for example. He recently had a patient who had a diaper fetish ina small town. Both he and his wife held visible positions and the publicrevelation was painful. The couple was severely traumatized. He had anteriorcingulate behavior that was getting him into potentially serious consequenceswith the court. He was also very depressed. An important part of helping tobring a more therapeutic slant into the process was trying to have the couplesee his behavior in a more logical way.The Brain and ParaphiliasThree different areas of the brain are involved in paraphilias: prefrontalcortex (PFC), anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) and basal ganglia (BG), and limbicor emotional structures. Each of these areas contributes in a different way andthey may, in fact, act together in a circuit or system that reinforces thereoccurrence of the sexual behavior. Hormonal issues are important as well.Paraphilias are what I term an impulsive-compulsive disorder. They have featuresof both a lack of impulse control, that involves the PFC, and compulsion, thatinvolves the ACG and BG.The PFC, as we have seen, is critical to executive function. Damage to this areacauses disinhibition and a lowering of impulse control. Therefore, people aremore likely to behave in ways that are not acceptable and feel no qualms abouttheir behavior. An article in the Archives of Neurology from University ofVirginia researchers described a case of a man with a right prefrontal cortextumor who developed pedophilia and was unable to inhibit his sexual urgesdespite knowing his behavior was wrong. The behavior resolved following tumorremoval.In a study from McLean Hospital in Boston, researchers evaluated 120 men withparaphilias, including 60 sex offenders. As a group, they were more likely toreport a higher incidence of physical abuse (often associated with braininjuries), fewer years of completed education, a higher prevalence of learningand behavioral problems, more psychiatric/substance-abuse hospitalizations,increased work-related problems, as well as more lifetime contact with thecriminal justice system. All of these issues are associated with low PFCfunction.Overactivity in the ACG and BG are associated with compulsive behaviors andcause people to get stuck on negative thoughts and behaviors. In addition, apart of the BG called the nucleus accumbens is associated with pleasuresensations. When it is triggered by something perceived as pleasurable, itreinforces or encourages the behavior to happen again and again.The limbic or emotional structures in the brain, including the hippocampus inthe temporal lobe, add the spice or emotional charge to the paraphilia. Thebrain’s memory centers work through association. One memory can trigger off aseries of emotions, such as how hearing a song can trigger a happy memory ofyour lover, or the same song may trigger the sorrow of a failed relationship ordeceased spouse. Likewise, certain paraphilias can trigger pleasure. There is areported case of a sixty-five-year-old man who became obsessed with the desirefor a peg leg. His fascination with peg legs began when he was young afterseeing people with false legs. He thought they were fascinating (pleasure) andthe prosthetics devices became more and more important over the years. It got tothe point where he was aroused by them. He related the peg leg with positivefeelings, generated from the brain’s limbic system, so that whenever he wouldsee or think about peg legs he would experience very positive feelings. He wasunhappy at the time of his evaluation and believed that if he had a peg leg, hewould be happy.As we saw in Lesson Four, men and women have a number of important anatomicaldifferences in the brain; one important area is called the hippocampus, part ofthe limbic system, on the inside aspects of the temporal lobes. Mostparaphiliacs are men. In men, the hippocampus is known to be involved in thecontrol of erection. There is evidence from animal studies that a largerhippocampus is related to polygamous behaviors. The hippocampus is involved inboth mating strategies of these animals and their “geographic range.”Paraphilacs are often diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, have alarger number of sexual partners, and show greater geographic range than mostmen. Sociobiologists even distinguish their polygamous mating strategies thanthose of other people. Essentially, they are in a class of their own and thesize of the hippocampus may have something to do with it.Paraphilias have been reported with multiple sclerosis (MS). Multiple sclerosisis a disorder of the central nervous system where neurons lose their coveringsand plaques become deposited into nerve-cell fields causing short circuits. MSaffects multiple areas of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex. A widevariety of symptoms are associated with this disease, and usually it affectsmood or cognition. There is a case report in the medical literature of a manrecently diagnosed with MS who began displaying paraphilic behavior. He had noprevious history of sexual abuse or dysfunction and was in a long-termrelationship. As the MS worsened, he began to masturbate incessantly andsexually accosted strangers on the street. His behavior became so out of controlthat it eventually led to his incarceration. In his case, the changes in hisbrain precipitated the sexual behaviors. Paraphilic symptoms have also beenassociated with other brain diseases such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease,dementia, and tumors.Hormones play a significant role in sexual behavior. In the pursuit oftreatments for paraphilias, research has shown that a common birth controlmethod in women, Depo Provera, can help. This synthetic hormone decreases sexualdesire and helps to tranquilize the brain. It has also been found to act in thetemporal lobes and been used to treat epilepsy and rage attacks in men. It doesnot just lower plasma testosterone levels, implicated in hypersexual behavior;it also acts as a method of calming seizure like activity in the brain. In onecase a thirty-eight-year-old man suffered brain damage after falling off hisbike. He had no history of mental illness or sexual dysfunction and his wifethought he had been a good problem solver. After the accident, his behaviorchanged drastically and he began displaying hypersexual tendencies. He harassedhis seventeen-year-old stepdaughter and she became the target of his sexualadvances. His sexual behavior was related to his epileptic seizures and wouldoccur simultaneous with them. After he received the hormone treatment, hestopped seizing and his sexual problems ceased as well.Are Sex Offenders Treatable?The treatment of sex offenders has changed radically in the last decade. Whatwas once considered a hopeless disorder is now thought by some professionals tobe treatable in many cases. The goal is to preserve normal sexual interests andbehaviors while reducing deviant or paraphilic ones. According to Canadianpsychiatrist John Bradford, pharmacological treatments have been shown todecrease the main problem in pedophilia, the preference of children for sexualgratification. Biological treatments, specifically castration and neurosurgery,have been used to treat sexual offenders to reduce their sexual drive and toprevent relapse. The studies of these treatments have reported markedly lowrecidivism rates, of about 5 percent following long periods of time. Theseoutcome studies help us understand these disorders, which involve excessiveresponse to male hormones, and what to do about it. The biological effects ofsurgical castration and male hormone suppression by antiandrogens and hormonalagents have the same effect on sexual behavior. In addition, Dr. Bradford hasfound antiobsessive medications, called SSRIs, which enhance serotonin, to bealso helpful in this population.Dwayne McCallum, a past medical director of a prison in Colorado, has used ideasfrom my brain-imaging research with sex offenders. He noticed that many of themhad ADHD, and treating the disorder decreased their impulsivity and subsequentlytheir recidivistic behavior. He also noted another group of sex offenders whohad anterior cingulate gyrus issues (rigid, worried, inflexible, repetitivenegative thoughts) that responded better to serotonin-enhancing medications,such as Lexapro. When it comes to sex offenders, most people think like myfather, “You should kill all the bastards.” My imaging work and the pioneeringwork of John Bradford, however, suggests a much more radical approach to them.By scanning and treating the abnormal brain function that many possess, we arelikely to decrease subsequent crimes.Getting Sneaky Thoughts out of Your MindAs mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, we all get sneaky thoughts.Sometimes they turn into trouble. One way to rid yourself of the pesky orirritating thoughts is to play them out to their worst conclusion. Here is acase below from my Men’s Health column. One man wrote in with the followingquestion. “I walked in on my sister-in-law while she was changing. Now I can’tstop thinking about her. What do I do?”I wrote, “If you’re thinking about what might happen the next time you’re alonewith your sister-in-law, let that fantasy play out in your mind. But when youdo, give it a negative ending. Getting caught by your wife or sister-in-law’shusband is generally a good start, but take the nightmare a step further byimagining the effect this would have on your relationships with other familymembers as well. It’ll make the whole fantasy less appealing—and allow it to diea natural death. If the thoughts, or even paraphilias and fetishes, cause youdistress, use this technique to decrease their frequency.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lesson #7: We all get unusual or sneaky thoughts; that is normal. When they getout of control, it may be a sign that the brain needs help.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_015_r1.jpg]THE “OH GOD!” FACTORimage [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_005_r1.jpg]Sex As a Religious Experience“If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that,‘it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,’ and take into accountthe fact that I slept with her last night, then I am sure that Hell . . . hasalready frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozenover, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore,extinct . . . leaving only Heaven thereby proving the existence of a divinebeing which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting ‘Oh my God.’”—FROM AN ANONYMOUS SOURCE ON THE INTERNETGod usually comes up at least once in the throes of sexual ecstasy. “Oh my God .. . Please God . . . God don’t stop . . .” are not uncommon phrases precedingintense orgasms. On the surface it might seem as though religious ecstasy andsexual pleasure have little in common, besides, of course, calling out God’sname. Looking under the surface, however, reveals some fascinating similarities.Experiences of God and sex are usually enhanced by rituals, music, and candles.Both experiences involve requesting help, if you consider “Oh God please don’tstop” asking for help, and both experiences can be associated with tremendousjoy.In recent years imaging has been used as a tool for brain scientists to look atbrain function in relation to religious experience and sexual ecstasy.Researchers have come to learn that behaviors that were seen as vastly differentfrom each other have more in common than once thought. Both peak experiencesseem to be processed primarily in the right side of the brain, especially theright temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex. So enhancing one experience may, infact, help the other. Enhancing right-hemisphere function may enhance bothreligious and sexual experience.Is there really evidence to support the connection between religious experienceand sexual ecstasy? Sexual ecstasy or orgasmic pleasure appears to involveprimarily the right hemisphere. Researchers from the University of Kuopio inFinland used brain-SPECT imaging to study eight healthy right-handed men duringorgasm. They found overall decreased blood flow in the brain during orgasmexcept in right prefrontal cortex, where cerebral blood flow was increasedsignificantly! There are twenty-three cases of temporal lobe epilepsy that areassociated with the feeling of having an orgasm, called an orgasmic epilepticaura. Eighty-seven percent of the patients had their abnormality on the rightside, especially the right temporal lobe. A study from the Department ofNeuroscience at Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim,Norway, examined eleven patients with epilepsy who reported auras of ecstasy orpleasure. Four had erotic sensations and five described “a religious/spiritualexperience.”Research from the Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory at Laurentian University inOntario, Canada, under the direction of Michael Persinger has studied religiousexperience and the brain for many years. They have reported that religiousexperience, especially of a sensed presence or being, can be induced by placinga weak magnetic field over the right temporal lobe. Women, who have greateraccess to the right hemisphere in general, reported more frequent experiences ofa sensed presence than did men, and men were more likely than women to considerthese experiences as “intrusions” from a negative alien source. Some of thephenomena generated by the right temporal lobe included “evil entities,” gods,out-of-body experiences, and alterations in space-time.NeurotheologyRayford and Jill have both experienced strong religious visions. He was anagnostic and she was a Christian. He thought that the devil was following him;she thought the Blessed Mother appeared to her. Both have temporal lobe epilepsy(TLE). Like other forms of epilepsy, the condition causes convulsions but it isalso associated with religious feelings, sexual ecstasy, and sometimeshallucinations. Research into why people like Rayford and Jill saw what they didhas opened up a whole field of brain science: neurotheology.Several religious figures are thought to have temporal lobe epilepsy. An exampleis Ellen White, one of the founders of the Seventh Day Adventist Movement bornin 1827. She suffered a brain injury at age nine that totally changed herpersonality and she subsequently started to have powerful religious visions.Author Fyodor Dostoyevsky was reported to have bouts of “temporal lobeseizures.” He felt his affliction was a “holy experience.” His biographer ReneFueloep-Miller quotes Dostoyevsky as saying, that his epilepsy “rouses in mehitherto unsuspected emotions, gives me feelings of magnificence, abundance andeternity.” In The Idiot, Dostoyevsky offers one of the most nuanced descriptionsof the experience:“There was always one instant just before the epileptic fit . . . when suddenlyin the midst of sadness, spiritual darkness and oppression, his brain seemedmomentarily to catch fire, and in an extraordinary rush, all his vital forceswere at their highest tension. The sense of life, the consciousness of self,were multiplied almost ten times at these moments which lasted no longer than aflash of lightning. His mind and his heart were flooded with extraordinarylight; all his uneasiness, all his doubts, all his anxieties were relieved atonce; they were all resolved in a loft calm, full of serene, harmonious joy andhope, full of reason and ultimate meaning. But these moments, these flashes,were only a premonition of that final second (it was never more than a second)with which the fit began. That second was, of course, unendurable. Thinking ofthat moment later, when he was well again, he often said to himself that allthese gleams and flashes of supreme sensation and consciousness of self, andtherefore, also of the highest form of being, were nothing but disease, theviolation of the normal state; and if so, it was not at all the highest form ofbeing, but on the contrary must be reckoned the lowest. Yet he came at last toan extreme paradoxical conclusion. ‘What if it is disease?’ he decided at last.‘What does it matter that it is an abnormal intensity, if the result, if thesensation, remembered and analyzed afterwards in health, turns out to be theacme of harmony and beauty, and gives a feeling, unknown and undivined tillthen, of completeness, of proportion, of reconciliation, and of startledprayerful merging with the highest synthesis of life?’”The brain feels joy and ecstasy. It also feels sadness and pain. Learning how toenhance brain function can enhance all areas of life, even the ones most sacred.Sacred SexSex can be a sacred act. Being inside another person’s body, becoming one withhim or her, allows for the exchange not only of bodily fluids, but also ofenergy forces, thoughts, and intentions. Sexual union can be a spiritualexperience. Many religions of the world discuss sex in a sacred context.Tantra (a Sanskrit word which means “woven together”) is a term applied toseveral schools of Hindu yoga in which sex is worshipped. And tantra has beenapplied to sexual practices of other religions, including Tibetan Buddhism andTaoism.Hindu TantraTantra yoga is thought to date back thousands of years. There were rituals, orpujas, focusing on sex organs, such as yoni puja, a ceremony honoring the vulva,either of a statue or a living woman; and linga puja, honoring the penis, oftenin the form of a natural upright stone. Similar objects of worship have beenfound among the archaeological remains of many neolithic people around theworld, leading some scholars to speculate that “sex worship” in some form oranother is humanity’s oldest religion. An Alaskan friend gave me a long,cylindrical carved statue. It was a walrus ooskis (penis). He said it symbolizedfertility and was a traditional gift given to couples.A major component of Hindu tantra is meditation stemming from a yoga tradition.In general, yoga is a Hindu practice that teaches practitioners to quietactivity of the body, mind, and will so that the individual may realize itsdistinction from them and attain liberation. Meditative yoga schools includehatha yoga (body posture) and bhakti yoga (devotion). Many yoga schools advocatea nonsexual approach to worship, in which visualizing a deity, chanting of amantra, concentrating on symbols called yantras, and the practice of tapas(discipline) are the foremost activities. During a sexual approach to worship,yoni puja, the practitioner may meditate on a yantra—often a downward-pointingtriangle—that symbolizes the vulva of the goddess.Some tantra yoga teachers recommend meditative practices that also shareelements with kundalini yoga, where subtle streams of energy are raised in thebody by means of posture, breath control, and movements. Teachers in this schoolof tantra typically advocate retention of semen even during sexual excitement asa prerequisite for spiritual advancement.Can meditation and prayer really enhance the brain and in turn enhance yoursexual experiences, as suggested here? Research studies by Andrew Newburg fromthe University of Pennsylvania and others have shown that prayer and meditationcan indeed influence brain function in a positive way. Studying Tibetan monksand Franciscan nuns, Dr. Newburg found that these meditative activities dampenedthe outside world (parietal lobes) and brought the focus internally by enhancingthe prefrontal cortex.With the sponsorship of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Research Foundation, mycolleagues and I teamed with Drs. Dharma Singh Khalsa and Nisha Money to studythe impact of meditation on the brain. We chose a simple twelve-minute form ofkundalini yoga meditation, Kriya Kirtan, that is easy for busy people topractice. It is based on the five primal sounds: saa, taa, naa, maa (aa beingthe fifth sound). Meditators chant each sound as they consecutively touch theirthumb to fingers two, three, four and five. The sounds and fingering arerepeated for two minutes out loud, two minutes whispering, four minutessilently, two minutes whispering, and two minutes out loud. We performed SPECTscans at rest one day and then after meditation the next day. We saw markeddecreases in the left parietal lobes (decreasing awareness of time and space)and significant increases in the prefrontal cortex (which showed that meditationhelped to tune people in, not out). We also observed increased activity in theright temporal lobe, an area that has been associated with spirituality andsexuality, which our meditators found amusing. “Of course,” one said, “that iswhy we meditate.”Best known in the West are the several forms of tantra yoga in which worshipservices take the form of sexual rituals featuring slow, nonorgasmic intercourseas a prelude to an experience of the divine. This broad category of tantric sexritualism, which derives from the pre-Hindu religions of Shaktism and Shaivism,has in turn produced two schools of practice: the “right hand path,” ameditational, monogamous rite; and the “left hand path,” in which dozens—ormore—couples engage in the ritual sex act at the same time, sometimes followingthe lead of a pair of teachers.Tibetan Buddhism, Taoism, and TantraA version of tantrism can be found in contemporary Tibetan Buddhism, where ablend of pre-Buddhist goddess worship is interspersed with rituals from theancient Tibetan religion Bon. Like Hindu tantra, Tibetan Buddhist tantraencompasses schools of practice that range from the meditational to the sexuallyactive.Taosim has several tantric schools with different views on the role of sexualactivity. One form of Taoist tantra, sexual alchemy, places emphasis on thesearch for a long life. Taoist tantric alchemy involves breath and musclecontrol and emphasizes the retention of sperm as proof of spiritual attainment.Other Taoist tantra teachers, working out of a paradigm that seems to be derivedfrom Shaktism, claim that Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism, was in fact advocatinga form of yoni puja or worship of the vulva when he wrote about “the valleyspirit.”Religious and Sexual Ecstasy: Practical ApplicationsIf the right side of the brain is involved in both religious and sexual ecstasy,how can you use this knowledge to enhance your own and your partner’s sexualexperiences? Since the right side of the brain helps us process music andrhythm, soft tunes and a romantic dance may help you and your partner get in themood. The right side of the brain also sees in pictures, instead of in words, sobeing in a beautiful environment is usually another plus. The right side of thebrain also tends to be the anxious or nervous side of the brain, so calmingworries, through a warm bath, relaxing back or foot rub, or a reassuring talk,can be helpful.You can also stimulate the right side of the brain by kissing the left side ofthe body. This intervention can be tricky, because sometimes the right side ofthe brain is associated with anxiety and it might be better to kiss the rightside of the body to stimulate a person’s left side. I recommend you run a seriesof experiments on your partner’s body to see what side he or she likes strokedor kissed better. Actually, this principle of experimenting is one of the beststrategies you can use. See what turns your partner on . . . write it down . . .talk about it . . . and remember it.Creating Rituals: Practical ApplicationsCreating sacred rituals for your sex life can yield many long-term advantages.These rituals do not need to be rigid, which stifles creativity, but rather canprovide a fun, safe, intimate environment in which to more fully explore yoursexuality. Start by setting the boundaries of what is acceptable behavior; talkabout what is comfortable and not. It is important for you and your partner todiscuss the things that make you feel relaxed, comfortable, excited, andsensual. It is important to create a safe environment in which to play. Somepartners do this by agreeing on a code word which tells the other that they wantto stop or are feeling uncomfortable, without breaking the mood. As well, it’simportant for you and your partner to talk about the things that make you feelgood, uncomfortable, or that you are just plain unsure about. Sex, at its core,is a form of communication between two people.After you have agreed to safe boundaries, you can take sex to a new level byinvesting in a few books or magazines. I write for Men’s Health magazine and itis always filled with great sex tips for couples. Cosmopolitan and othermagazines have playful ideas as well. Books on tantric sex or role-playing gamescan also be fun. Page through them together, talking about and exploring newideas and techniques for inspiring passion.Once you’ve agreed on the existing and new areas of interest to play in, begincreating your plan of action for that evening (or afternoon or morning). Often,simple rituals can be very exciting, such as a beautiful bath filled with rosepetals and floating candles, along with sensual music, titillating aromas, oilsfor massage, and an aphrodisiac tea or treat. This alone can create a mood ofirresistible desire. There are times, though, that more excitement is requiredto bring on the feelings of arousal. This is where doing something outside ofthe norm can take a really exhilarating form. For instance, going to the oceanor a lake in a private spot and skinny-dipping, pulling the stop switch on anelevator (that doesn’t have surveillance cameras) and making love in a uniquesetting, or playing out a sexual fantasy. This is an area of unlimitedpossibility and fun, if both partners can agree to cooperate with each other onhidden desires. Again, the word cooperation is a very important one. It’scrucial for both partners to feel comfortable but also be willing to be a bitflexible, as long as the method doesn’t compromise a core value or involveunwanted pain for a partner. Sometimes by opening oneself up to newpossibilities, whole new worlds of sensuality are unleashed.Remember, ritual is symbolic of the experience to come, so it can take justabout any form—a phone call to your partner at work, homemade cookies as anafternoon snack, or a walk through the park holding hands. This is your uniquebonding which takes place in order to open up the channels for deeper love andconnection between you and your significant other. Let go, be creative, and useyour brain to have fun.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lesson #8: Sex can be a spiritual experience.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_016_r1.jpg]BRAIN SEX TRICKSimage [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_005_r1.jpg]Sex Potions, Passion, and Finding the “Damn Spot”“Just find the damn spot. All you have to do is find the spot.”—JOY BEHAR, The ViewAccording to Greek myth, Uranus, the father of the Titans, was castrated by hisson Cronus. When his severed genitalia was thrown into the sea, the waters beganto churn. From the sea foam (known in Greek as aphros), Aphrodite was born, thegoddess of love and the mother of Eros (known by his Roman name as Cupid). Thisis the origin of the name aphrodisiacs, the term that describes the many methodsreported to enhance libido, potency, and sexual pleasure. This chapter exploresthe neuroscience of the foods, drinks, drugs, scents, or devices believed toenhance sexual interest and performance.AphrodisiacsViagra, and his pharmaceutical brothers, Cialis and Levitra, have drawninternational public attention to aphrodisiacs. You cannot turn on thetelevision or listen to a radio show without hearing about these medications. Weare constantly reminded of our desire for sex. Images of baby boomer men gracethe screen as they relax by the beach. The suggestive tag lines include “Let thedance begin” and “Relax and take your time.” Viagra even has a frequent-buyercard and you get your seventh prescription for free. It may seem as though thereis a new obsession with sex, but mankind has been focused on sex—and ways tomake it better—since the beginning of time.The search for aphrodisiacs dates back at least five thousand years and hasincluded useful remedies as well as ones that have hurt and killed people, andcost many animals their lives. For example, there are two reports on the effectsof swallowing a substance containing toad secretions. Of seven previouslyhealthy men who took the drug, the active ingredient in the West Indian “lovestone” and the Chinese medication “chan su,” four died. Toad secretions containa substance that causes abnormal heart rhythms in people, which may beresponsible for the high they feel when taking it. Unfortunately, it can alsostop the heart fatally. Which aphrodisiacs are helpful, practical, and haveresearch to show efficacy, and which are dangerous or illegal?One aphrodisiac to avoid is Spanish fly (cantharidin), which has been used for athousand years as a sexual stimulant. It is one of the best known and infamousmodern love potions. Made from the dried body of blister beetles, so named forcausing blistering of the skin, it irritates the urinary tract, sending a rushof blood to the genitals, causing the feeling of excitement. However, it is alsoa poison and illegal in the United States. While most commonly availablepreparations of Spanish fly contain cantharidin in negligible amounts, if atall, the chemical is available illicitly in concentrations capable of causingsevere toxicity. Symptoms of cantharidin poisoning include burning of the mouth,trouble swallowing, nausea, blood in the urine, and painful urination. Priapism(painful erections that won’t go away), seizures, and heart abnormalities arealso possible. The practice of eating live beetles in Southeast Asia and “thekissing bugs” (triatomids) in Mexico may work in a similar way. Similarly, thesebugs are also dangerous and should not be ingested.For increasing libido, ambrein, a major constituent of a gray, waxy secretion(ambergris) found in the digestive tract of some sperm whales, is used in Arabcountries, but it is illegal in the United States. This substance increases theconcentration of several hormones, including testosterone. It was once used as afixative in perfumes, and is used as an aphrodisiac in some parts of the world.When given a dose of ambrien, male rats got a lot more interested in sex, evenwhen no female rats were nearby. When receptive females were put into the cages,the male rats had “recurrent episodes of penile erection, a dose-dependent,vigorous, and repetitive increase in intromissions and an increased anogenitalinvestigatory behavior.” The rats went into a mating frenzy. The researchersfrom King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, concluded that ambrien isindeed a sexual stimulant, adding legitimacy to similar claims by Chinesetraditional medicine. Historically, Chinese noblemen would drink ambreindissolved into a draught. Ambrein is illegal in the United States, where spermwhales are listed as an endangered species.Asian ginseng is commonly used to treat sexual dysfunction in men and isavailable in the United States. Recent lab studies in animals have shown thatboth Asian and American forms of ginseng enhance libido and sexual performance.The effects of ginseng have several probable causes. There is a direct effect ofginseng on the central nervous system and genital tissues. There is goodevidence that ginseng can facilitate erection by directly increasing blood flowto the penis. The effects of ginseng appear to work through the release ofnitric oxide (similar to Viagra). Ginseng also affects the brain and has beenshown to enhance the activity of neurotransmitters and hormones involved insexual behavior. Ginseng is considered an adaptogen that enhances physicalperformance, promotes vitality, and increases resistance to stress and aging.When used appropriately, ginseng appears to be safe. Nevertheless, documentedside effects include hypertension, diarrhea, restlessness, and vaginal bleeding.Most published research studies have used a standardized Panax ginseng extractin a dosage of 200 mg per day. Other sources recommend 0.5 to 2 g of dry rootper day on a short-term basis, with the ginseng taken in tea form or chewed.Capsule formulas are generally given in a dosage of 100 to 600 mg per day,usually in divided doses.The prettiest brains I have seen are those on ginkgo. Ginkgo biloba, from theChinese ginkgo tree, is a powerful antioxidant that is best known for itsability to enhance circulation, memory, and concentration. The best studied formof ginkgo biloba is a special extract called EGB 761, which has been studied inblood vessel disease, clotting disorders, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease.There are also reports that it enhances sexual function. Many psychiatrists useginkgo to counteract the sexual side effects of SSRI antidepressant medications.There are many different forms of ginkgo, making dosing confusing. In the UnitedStates Ginkoba and Ginkgold (Nature’s Way) are brands that have been compoundedto reflect EGB 761. The usual effective dose is 60 to 120 mg twice per day.There is a small risk of bleeding in the body, and the dosages of otherblood-thinning agents being taken may sometimes need to be reduced. Beforetaking supplements, make sure to talk with your doctor.Yohimbine, extracted from Yohimbine bark, can facilitate erections bystimulating the nervous system and increasing blood flow to the penis. But it isnot for everyone. Common side effects include increased heart rate, raised bloodpressure, anxiety, and nausea. Available by prescription, Yohimbine should beused under a doctor’s supervision.L-arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid that is a precursor to nitricoxide. It has been used with some success to enhance sexual function because itis believed to improve blood flow to the genitals. Researchers from theUniversity of Copenhagen in Denmark reported that in rats L-arginine helpedregulate vaginal smooth-muscle tone and also affected blood flow in all areas.L-arginine coupled with yohimbe has been found to make a positive difference inwomen with low sexual desire. Researchers from the University of Texas, Austinstudied twenty-four women using this combination and found it significantlyincreased blood flow an hour after they were given these substances.Sexy ScentsHumorist Dave Barry once wrote, “Of all the human senses—sight, hearing, touch,taste, and the feeling that a huge man with a barbecue fork is lurking in thecloset—perhaps the least appreciated, yet most important, is our sense ofsmell.” In treating patients who suffered from loss of the sense of smell,psychiatrist Alan Hirsch, from the Smell and Taste Treatment and ResearchFoundation in Chicago, found that almost 25 percent had also developed sexualdysfunction, suggesting that odor can have a large impact on sexual arousal.Your sense of smell is the strongest of your five senses and highly involved insexual function, pleasure, and irritation. Scientists discuss the concept of“smell print,” where memories are associated with certain smells. Years later, asmell will vividly cause a person to recall the memory associated with it.Smells are like fingerprints, highly individualized.The deep limbic brain is involved with our sense of smell and interest in sex.The two go hand in hand. The smell of cooked cinnamon, on the one hand, is anatural aphrodisiac for men. The sex organ in the brain that is responsive tosexual-interest hormones is two and a half times larger in men than in women.When I told my mother about cooked cinnamon, she hit her forehead and said,“That is why I have seven children! He would never leave me alone.” The Lebanesecook with a lot of cinnamon.Dr. Hirsch has studied many smells associated with sexual interest in both malesand females. Measuring penile blood flow, with a device that looked like a smallblood pressure cuff, he found that certain scents or combinations of scentsactivated the erector machinery more than others. The combination scent oflavender and pumpkin pie was at the top of the list, increasing penile bloodflow by 40 percent! Other winning scents included doughnut and black licorice,doughnut and pumpkin pie, doughnut and lavender, orange, cheese pizza, roastbeef, and cinnamon buns.Which ones work for females? To uncover this sweet-smelling piece ofinformation, Dr. Hirsch measured vaginal blood flow with a special monitoringdevice. Increased vaginal blood flow is a sign of sexual arousal in women, whiledecreased blood flow is the opposite. He started by measuring the response tomen’s colognes. All of them decreased vaginal blood flow. Don’t waste yourmoney.In my lectures, I ask the audience what scents they think most increase vaginalblood flow and sexual interest. Audience members blurt out some interestinganswers, such as sweat, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, strawberry, and freshlyminted money. The most interesting audience response came from a stunning,redheaded woman in Atlanta, who, in a very sweet southern accent, said, “Thesmell of fresh leather from a new Mercedes Benz.” Very few crowds get the answerright. One of the best scents according to Dr. Hirsch’s research was babypowder. “Baby powder!” I hear people in the audience say in amazement. “Why babypowder?”The brain works through association, which is why certain smells or soundstrigger powerful feelings or memories, such as the smell of fresh baked breadtaking you back to the comfort of Grandma’s kitchen when you were a child. Whatdo women associate with baby powder? Freshly diapered, cute little babies. Then,unconsciously, they want one; thus, the increased vaginal blood flow andinterest! Dr. Hirsch also found that cucumber, licorice, lavender, and pumpkinpie all increased vaginal blood flow, while the smell of cherries and barbecueshad the reverse effect.Despite Dr. Hirsch’s research, many ancient societies believed perfumes wereaphrodisiacs and some new research suggests they may have been right. The Romansand Egyptians used lavish amounts of perfume containing musk. The musk used wasfrom the anal glands of the Ethiopian civet cat. Current research suggests thatthe scent of musk closely resembles that of testosterone, the hormone thatenhances a healthy libido in both men and women.In scent studies performed at Toho University in Japan, Professor Shizuo Toriishowed the impact of floral and herbal essential oils on the nervous system.Sexual arousal and response is controlled by the two parts of the nervoussystem: the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which prepares us for physicalaction or emergencies, also called the fight-or-flight system; and theparasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which stimulates relaxation. For those whoneed to relax in order to get in the mood of sex, the PNS should be dominant,while those who need to be stimulated would do better by enhancing the SNS.Professor Torii found that the PNS was stimulated by the scent of sandalwood,marjoram, lemon, chamomile, and bergamot. The SNS was increased by the scents ofjasmine, ylang-ylang, rose, patchouli, peppermint, clove, and bois de rose.Aphrodisiacs need to be tailored to individuals, not large groups. Find thescents most appealing to you. Buy the essential oils of these substances inhealth food stores and dilute them by putting a few drops into a carrier likeolive or canola oil.Sexy FoodsA romantic meal can put you in the mood for love. The intimacy created bycandlelight and soft music is important, but food also plays a starring role inour sexuality. The sweet texture of melted chocolate, the sweet juice andfragrance of an orange, the shape and smell of a cucumber—all stimulate thetaste buds and the imagination. Additionally, several societies regard foodslike bananas, cucumbers, asparagus, and carrots as erotic stimulants because oftheir penislike shape. The ancient Aztec name for avocado was ahuacatl, ortesticle, because of the fruit’s appearance. Virgin girls were forbidden fromgoing outdoors during harvests of avocados. Today, researchers have verifiedthat some of the ancient aphrodisiac foods do in fact contain certain vitaminsand minerals that contribute to a healthy reproductive system and perhaps even ahealthy libido. Here is a list of several potentially sexy foods.Almonds (or nuts in general)Almonds are a major source of essential fatty acids. These are vital as theyprovide the raw material for a man’s healthy production of hormones and help thebrain work better. The smell of almonds has also been reported to arouse passionin females. Almonds enhance phenylethylamine (PEA) production, as doeschocolate, to increase brain stem activity, enhancing alertness. Try lightingsome almond-scented candles to encourage your partner’s mood and snacking onsome (but not too many) yourself to store up energy for your performance. Eatthem raw (with no added salt or sweetness), or, crush some fresh almonds andsprinkle them on your salad to get the energy you need.ApplesApples have been given as gifts of reverence for years, be it to teachers,friends, or loved ones. They actually belong to the Rose family and have beenused in Yuletide rituals to symbolize fertility in nature. Apples not only cleanthe teeth and inspire the flow of saliva, but they also sweeten the breath,which is always a wonderful stimulus for the foreplay of kissing.ArtichokesArtichokes contain a substance by the name of cynarin, which helps to strengthenthe liver. Artichokes were traditionally used by the French as aphrodisiacs.AsparagusMany foods thought to be aphrodisiacs were considered so because of theirphallic shape. Asparagus, however, has more than suggestive form. It is rich invitamin E, a vitamin considered to stimulate production of our sex hormones andthat may be essential for a healthy sex life.AvocadoThe Aztecs called the avocado tree ahuacatl or “testicle tree.” While avocadoscan indeed look like that body part, they contain high levels of folic acid,which helps metabolize proteins, thus giving you more energy. They also containvitamin B6 (a nutrient that increases male hormone production) and potassium(which helps regulate a woman’s thyroid gland), two elements that help enhanceboth male and female libido. In addition, avocados are loaded withphenylethylamines, even more so than chocolate. Plus, they have omega-3 fattyacids that help the brain work better, so you’ll be more likely to get lucky.BananasBananas contain the bromelain enzyme, which is believed to improve male libido.Additionally, they are good sources of potassium and B vitamins such asriboflavin, which increase the body’s overall energy levels.CabbageCabbage is wonderful for helping to increase circulation, therefore stimulatingsexual energy.CeleryWhile it may not be the first food that comes to mind when it comes to sex,celery can be a fantastic source food for sexual stimulation, as it containsandrosterone, an odorless hormone released through male perspiration that turnswomen on.Chili PeppersChilies may heat up your sex life, too, due to capsaicin—the substance thatgives kick to peppers, curries, and other spicy foods. Capsaicin stimulatesnerve endings to release chemicals, raising the heart rate, making us sweat, andpossibly triggering the release of endorphins, giving you the pleasurablefeeling of a natural high that is conducive to love-making.Chocolate and CheeseIn addition to the silky texture of melted chocolate, this quintessentiallovers’ gift contains PEA, considered by some researchers as the “lovechemical”—it imparts a feeling of well-being and excitement, like endorphinsgiving a natural high—and theobromine, a substance very similar to caffeine. Donot give too much chocolate, however. A little helps your partner focus, a lotgives him or her low blood sugar, which may put them to sleep. Cheese actuallycontains more PEA than chocolate. So order a cheese platter after dinner and seeif it gets you both in the mood. If you still prefer chocolate, make it darkrather than milk. It has a much higher cocoa-solids content (and therefore morefeel-good chemicals). To get him or her ready for sex in the morning, make yourpartner cereal with chopped apple and almonds—both have high levels of PEA,which will help get him or her in the mood.DamianaDamiana, or wild yam, has a traditional use as an aphrodisiac and chemicalanalysis shows that it contains chemicals that can increase sensitivity in thegenitals. Damiana also has a reputation for inducing erotic dreams, when drunkat bedtime, although it has not been proven in clinical trials.EggsAlthough not the most sensual of foods, eggs are high in vitamins B5 and B6.These help balance hormone levels and fight stress, two things that are crucialto a healthy libido. Eggs are also a symbol of fertility and rebirth. Somepeople will eat raw chicken eggs just prior to sex to increase their libido andmaximize energy levels; however, please be aware of the possibility ofsalmonella contamination in uncooked egg products. All bird and fish eggscontain B5 and B6.FigsHigh in amino acids, figs are believed to increase libido. They can also improvesexual stamina. Furthermore, the shape of a fresh fig and its sweet, juicy tasteare two tangible aspects that are highly pleasurable to the human senses.GarlicYes, you might need to stock up on some extra breath mints, but it’ll be worthit. Garlic contains allicin, an ingredient that increases blood flow to thesexual organs. As such, it’s a highly effective herb for increasing libido. Ifthe odor just won’t work for you, or you can’t stand garlic, you can always takegarlic capsules instead.NutmegNutmeg has been mentioned in Indian Unani medicine for enhancing desire. Whenresearchers from Aligarh Muslim University in India gave an extract of nutmeg todifferent groups of male rats daily for seven days, the female rats involved inthe study were made receptive by hormonal treatment. The general matingbehavior, libido, and potency were studied and compared with the resultsproduced by Viagra, showing a significant augmentation of sexual activity. Itincreased erections and mounting frequency. Nutmeg was without any adverseeffects.OystersOysters have long been considered the food of love, and legend has it thatCasanova ate dozens of oysters a day, once even seducing a virgin by sliding anoyster from his lips to hers. Whatever the case, the truth is that oysters arehigh in zinc, a mineral used in the production of testosterone. Not only thehormone behind the male sex drive, testosterone is believed to stimulate thefemale libido as well. Oysters also contain dopamine, a chemical that increasesfocus and motivation for fun.Sea VegetablesSea vegetables such as dulse, kelp, and nori are great aphrodisiacs because theyare chock-full of minerals such as calcium, iodine, and iron, which help inbalancing the thyroid gland and endocrine system . . . as a result,strengthening the libido.Semen Taste TipsCinnamon, cardamom, peppermint, and lemon will improve the taste of semen.Garlic, onions, curry, or asparagus will have the opposite effect. Since womenhave a more sensitive sense of smell and taste, great hygiene is usually thebest policy to reinforce the experience positively.Delicious VulvasSome men say they do not want to give oral sex to women because of the taste orsmell. The variances of tastes and smells depend on a number of factors,including what a person has eaten, where women are in their menstrual cycles,and the pH of the vaginal secretions. Of course, what a person finds appealingis very individual. Natalie Angier writes, in Women: An Intimate Geography, thatour skin’s pH stays between 6.0 and 7.0, while a healthy vagina is between anacidic 3.8 and 4.5. Examples of acidic pH foods are lemons (2.0), coffee (5.0),and wine (4.0). As a woman’s pH climbs, her secretions smell stronger andstronger. Bathing with a hypoallergenic soap that has a low pH is one way tocounteract the strong scent. Strong foods such as asparagus and garlic willincrease the scent, as will multiple vitamins. Lemons, oranges, and grapefruitsmay soften and sweeten the scent. As with everything else about sex, tactfullytalk about what you like and what you don’t. Showering together before oral sexis often an erotic form of foreplay.ExerciseExercise can keep your heart healthy, your body slim, and your psyche sound, andnow studies show it can act as an aphrodisiac, too. Although you may not feel sosexy after a sweaty workout, don’t be surprised if you find yourself feeling inthe mood for love. Research now suggests that along with all of the other healthbenefits exercise imparts, it can also give a big boost to your sex life. Thereason has less to do with getting stronger than with the release of endorphinsin the brain (as a result of physical exertion) that influence how we feel.These are the same neurochemicals responsible for a “runner’s high” or the senseof exhilaration that comes from skiing down a mountain or after an intenseaerobics class. It turns out these brain chemicals may also be linked to therelease of hormones that power the sex drive. Research has shown that women whoexercise regularly tend to have more active sex lives, are more easily aroused,and reach orgasm more quickly than those who don’t work out. Less vigorousEastern forms of exercise take another approach. Instead of stimulating brainchemicals to rev up the sex drive, yoga and tantra provide postures designed tohelp resolve specific sexual problems. Some are said to work by stimulatingblood flow to the genital area while others are directed toward maximizingsexual performance and satisfaction. While there’s no scientific proof thatthese ancient exercises add up to effective aphrodisiacs, practitioners seempleased with the results. If regular exercise has no appeal, then twirlingaround on the dance floor can get the juices flowing just the same. In fact,whether the music is a minuet or mambo, moving to the beat is an age-old,socially sanctioned mating ritual. Whatever your preference—from the treadmillto the dance floor—it seems clear that the more you move your body, the betteryour sex life can be.Touching, Feet, Foreplay, and a Very Strange-Looking Little Man in the BrainTouch is a central aspect of sexual experience. Touching stimulates oxytocin,which in turn stimulates trust and comfort, setting the mood for sex. Knowingwhere to touch can be tricky. Not all areas of the body are created equal whenit comes to sensory neurons, and starting with the genitals is usuallyconsidered bad form, even though they have a bazillion nerve endings.Neuroscience can give us clear guidelines on how and where to touch someone tomaximize erotic stimulation. Our skin has receptors that detect wheneversomething touches us. These “touch” receptors feed into the brain’s parietallobes in such a way as to create a “touch” or sensory map. Certain areas of thebrain have many more touch receptors than others. In medical school I wasintroduced to the concept of the homunculus, a very strange-looking little manthat illustrated the percentage of sensory nerve fibers in the brain (see Figure9.1). From the illustration, you can see that the lips, hands, feet, andgenitals get the lion share of brain space for sensation. The fingertips, forexample, have the highest density of receptors: about 2,500 per squarecentimeter! Using this information, one can see why holding hands, kissing lips,and stroking a face with fingertips can be very stimulating. The brain has wiredthese areas to be very sensitive. In addition to the size of a sensory area, itsplacement and next-door neighbors can also give us important clues. For example,in the homunculus, the genital area is next door to the foot-sensation area.These areas share neural crosstalk and exchange information. This may be whymany women say, “If you want your way, rub my feet.” This anatomy lesson mayalso help explain foot fetishes, why women collect shoes, and why rubbing andkissing feet is so erotic.image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_017_r1.jpg]“Feet have always had an erotic connotation,” says Suzanne Baldaia, a fashionhistorian and professor from Rhode Island in an interview with the ChicagoSun-Times. “Folklore offers us many examples of the shoe being a symbol offemale genitalia. In many cultures, a bride’s shoe was offered to the bridegroomas a symbol of property, and as an exchange of something a little bit deeper.”The prince in the story Cinderella is a classic example of a man chasing after awoman’s feet. Feet are definitely an erogenous zone. Men love spiked heels,patent leather shoes, a glimpse of toes, which some have labeled toe cleavage.When treating sexual dysfunction in women, Masters and Johnson found thatsensual touching helped to focus on the pleasure associated with touch ratherthan genital response. They suggested foot rubs because they are not threateningand more comforting. Little did they know about the real reasons foot rubsworked. Foot rubs have also been helpful in pain management. Massaging feetstimulates the receptors in the muscle that activate the “nonpainful” nervefibers and therefore prevent pain transmission from being felt. In studying thisphenomena, researchers found that a twenty-minute foot massage after taking painmedication significantly decreased pain intensity and distress as compared toreceiving medication alone.Just Find the Damn SpotDuring the middle of my appearance on The View, discussed in Lesson Four, wherewe were talking about the differences between male and female brains, Joy Beharinterrupted me, saying, “Just find the damn spot. All you have to do is find thespot.” She then repeated her observation several more times. I suspected she wasreferring to the clitoris, or perhaps even the G-spot. So, is it true? Do menjust need to find the spot and rub up against it? I suspect not; sexuality ismore complicated. But finding the spot is an important part of the puzzle, forboth men and women.Where is the G-spot? Is it real? The concept of the G-spot (more accuratelyreferred to as an area, instead of a spot) was first discussed by ErnestGrafenberg, MD, in 1944. It was expanded on and popularized by Beverly Whippleand John Perry in the 1980s. Practitioners of tantric sex have been talkingabout this “sacred spot” for more than a thousand years. Even though it remainscontroversial, many women swear by it. To be clear, it is important to note thatDr. Grafenberg did not think there was just one erogenous spot. He wrote,“Innumerable erotogenic spots are distributed all over the body, from wheresexual satisfaction can be elicited; there are so many that we can almost saythat there is no part of the female body which does not give sexual response,the partner has only to find the erotogenic zones.”Okay, there are many spots. But is there a special spot? Dr. Grafenberg thoughtso, “An erotic zone always could be demonstrated on the anterior wall of thevagina along the course of the urethra [the emphasis here is mine]. Even whenthere was a good response in the entire vagina, this particular area was moreeasily stimulated by the finger than the other areas of the vagina. Women testedthis way always knew when the finger slipped from the urethra by the impairmentof their sexual stimulation. During orgasm this area is pressed downwardsagainst the finger like a small cyst protruding into the vaginal canal. Itlooked as if the erotogenic part of the anterior vaginal wall tried to bringitself in closest contact with the finger. It could be found in all women, farmore frequently than the spastic contractions of the pelvic floor . . . . Afterthe orgasm was achieved a complete relaxation of the anterior vaginal wall setsin.”Similar to the male urethra, the female urethra seems to be surrounded byerectile tissues, called the corpora cavernosa in males. In the course of sexualstimulation, the female urethra begins to enlarge and can be felt easily. Itswells out greatly at the end of orgasm. The most stimulating part is locatedwhere the urethra arises from the neck of the bladder.Erotogenic zones in the female urethra are sometimes the cause of urethralmasturbation. I have seen several teenage girls with this problem. Girlsstimulated themselves with hair pins, pens, or pencils in their urethra. Theblunt part of the old-fashioned hair pin, or other small, narrow object, isintroduced into the urethra and moved back and forth. During the ecstasy of theorgasm some girls lose control of the object and it ends up in the bladder. Mostgirls who lose these objects feel ashamed and hide the incident from theirparents until a bladder problem results. These lost objects have caused bladderstones, infections, and tears. Urethral masturbation also happens in boys, men,and couples. I have seen patients with drink stirrers lodged in their urethras.This happens more when the couple is drunk and they have low prefrontal cortexactivity.image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_018_r1.jpg]Another interesting discovery associated with G-spot research is the incidenceof female ejaculation. Milan Zaviacic and his colleagues at Comenius Universityin Bratislava reported research on this phenomena in an article published in theJournal of Sex Research. The study was conducted with twenty-seven women; aG-spot was found in all, and ten of them experienced episodes of feminineejaculation. The accepted theory is that the G-spot is analogous to the prostateand associated glands, as it seems to produce a fluid chemically similar to maleseminal fluid. This phenomenon is one that many women mistake for urinaryincontinence, although the fluid released is actually quite different fromurine. This is not an uncommon occurrence, as is shown in “Female Ejaculation:Perceived Origins, the Grafenberg Spot/Area, and Sexual Responsiveness,” anarticle in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. According to the introduction, 40percent of the participants in an anonymous mail survey of 2,350 women (with a55 percent response rate) reported experiences of ejaculation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lesson #9: Use brain sex tricks to optimize your love life.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_019_r1.jpg]MAKE IT LAST, MAKE IT UNFORGETTABLEimage [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_005_r1.jpg]Embedding Yourself in Your Partner’s Memory“It is not the number of breaths you take that matter, but the moments that takeyour breath away.”—BUDDHIST WISDOMThe brain works through association. It has massive memory banks that tietogether every idea, thought, feeling, action, image, smell, touch, taste, andsound. Every moment we are alive we are a combination of our present state andpast memories put together. Every moment you are together with your partner, andmany moments throughout the day when you are apart, you are embedding yourselfin your partner’s memory circuits. If you want to be a positive force in yourpartner’s brain, it is important to plant the seeds of excitement, happiness,novelty, and joy, rather than boredom, anger, or insecurity. In this chapterI’ll discuss twelve brainy ways to embed yourself into your partner’s brain tomake love last and to make yourself unforgettable.A word of caution: Do these things only if you are sincere and want an emotionaland neurochemical attachment to the other person. When people get tightly bondedto others, which likely will happen if you follow the suggestions below, it isvery hard for them to separate or break up with their loved one. Relationshipbreakdowns are horrible when bits of the other person are stored in every funpart of your brain. The grieving process can be very hard on your immune system.People are known to become sick and even die when an intense relationship ends.Giving someone hundreds of cards and then abandoning him or her is cruel andlikely to cause a person to feel depressed, obsessed, and perhaps even to set upstalking behavior. If you are going to connect yourself to others, be serious.Otherwise, get a dog, get a hooker, or get a vibrator.Twelve Ways to Make Your Love Unforgettable1. Take your partner’s breath away. Do something amazingly thoughtful and out ofthe ordinary. These events solidify you in the person’s limbic brain. A closefriend was dating a new woman. On his birthday, his girlfriend gave him birthdaycards signed by all four of his siblings and his ten cousins. He was stunned bythe thoughtfulness of the gesture. Not only was it unique, it showed that shethought about him and planned something special weeks ahead of time. Herthoughtfulness was embedded in his memory.Once I gave a beautiful flower arrangement to my sweetheart. I knew it would bespecial, because five women who saw the arrangement at the store asked if Iwould be their boyfriend. Flowers are one of the best brain gifts. The scenthelps to soothe and activate the limbic brain. The smells last for days and theyhave no calories to make someone fat. My sweetheart was grateful for weeks.Along the same lines, once I received a huge flower arrangement from a woman Iwas dating. It so surprised me that it embedded her kindness in my heart for along time. Men love getting flowers, too.The thoughtfulness does not have to be about money. It means the most when it isabout the time spent and forethought that goes into making it happen. In asimilar vein, writing poetry or making someone a sentimental CD can also be veryspecial.Taking someone’s breath away involves surprise, in a wonderful way, even if itis a small gesture of love. You can also teach your partner how you want to besurprised. If you like chocolate, tell him to hide some around the house increative places so that you can find them throughout the day and think of him.If you like flowers, tell him or her to send them on occasion.I have a friend who surprised her husband by showing up at his office in atrench coat, with nothing on underneath except fishnet stockings and sexy shoes.This was so much fun for both of them. Another wonderful little surprise is toleave notes in pockets so that he or she can find them throughout the day.Another idea is to pick up your partner from work for a surprise gourmet lunchin a beautiful park. Find out what makes your partner tick and then find a wayto tie it into your little plot to bring more joy and pleasure into his or herworld.2. Do something special on a regular basis. One of the best ways to makeyourself unforgettable is to do things for your partner on a regular basis. Makehis or her nervous system expect your call, want to hear your voice, miss yourtouch or the look into your eyes. Giving someone greeting cards, paper cards, ore-cards on a regular basis is a wonderful way to stay connected. Being yourpartner’s first call in the morning and last call at night helps to solidify youin his or her neural networks. Many greeting card companies and florists haveprograms to remind you on a regular basis to send something special. It is thereinforcement of thoughtfulness that makes a difference.3. Do something special on an intermittent or unpredictable basis. This may evenbe more powerful than doing something regularly. Sometimes, when we do somethingon a regular schedule, people come to expect it and it loses its power, sort oflike living at the beach and seeing sunsets every night. They tend, for some(not me), to lose their special nature. There is a concept in “learning theory”called intermittent reinforcement. It is one of the most powerful learning toolsknown. Here, the reinforcers, such as flowers, are not sent on a regularschedule, but rather on an irregular one, such as once or twice a month. Thetrick is to make it unpredictable and unexpected.4. Frequent, loving eye contact (some cultures call it eye gazing) is anespecially powerful connection tool for bonding. Eye contact enhances intimacy.No eye contact decreases bonding and connectedness. New York psychologistProfessor Arthur Arun has been studying the dynamics of what happens when peoplefall in love. He has shown that the simple act of staring into each other’s eyeshas a powerful impact. He asked two strangers to reveal intimate details abouttheir lives to each other. They did this for an hour and a half. The twostrangers were then made to stare into each other’s eyes without talking forfour minutes. Afterward, many of his couples confessed to feeling deeplyattracted to their opposite number, and two of his subjects even married later.When we are aroused and interested in what we are looking at, our pupils dilate.In medieval Italy, women put the chemical belladonna (literally meaning“beautiful lady”) into their eyes to make their pupils look bigger. However,this is not recommended, as belladonna can be poisonous and eventually leads toblindness. It is better and safer to stick to eyeliner and mascara.5. Learn what pleases your partner sexually. Their pleasure should be yourpleasure, if you want to make your love life unforgettable. Gain skill in thethings that make him or her happy, in what turns him or her on, in what bringsjoy. Making this a priority will give you many, many dividends. Think of it as aclass (yes, there should be tests) on the ins and outs of your partner. This isone of the best ways to keep the relationship young and happy. As part of theclass, you need to know all about pleasing your partner. It shouldn’t be amystery or only talked about when you feel frustrated. It is time for a greatcollaboration. Here is one exercise I use with couples. Do it on each other. Ilike to have couples show the other person what they like. Make it a kinestheticexercise. Show your partner how you like to have your ears kissed, by kissingher ears the way you would like to be kissed. Show your partner how you likeyour back being rubbed by rubbing his back the way you like.Many couples are embarrassed to ask for what they want and what they like. Yourpartner is probably not good at reading your mind. Tell him or her what turnsyou on. Go into detail. Have your partner practice on you. Try this exercise byfilling out the following form and working through each question with yourpartner.1. I like it when you———with my hair.2. I like it when you———with my ears.3. I like it when you———with my eyes.4. I like it when you———with my nose.5. I like it when you———with my neck.6. I like it when you———with my upper back.7. I like it when you———with my lower back.8. I like it when you———with my breast/chest.9. I like it when you———with my belly.10. I like it when you———with my genitals.11. I like it when you———with my butt.12. I like it when you———with my thighs.13. I like it when you———with my lower legs.14. I like it when you———with my feet.6. Teach your partner what you like. Most people get joy by pleasing others. Bean expert communicator by sharing your wants and desires. The brain loves thesounds of excitement. Make sure when your partner is pleasing you that you lethim or her know.When Dr. Irwin Goldstein, an expert in sexual medicine, presented recentresearch findings to a scientific meeting, he said: “It is rare for me to standin front of an audience and say, ‘This is a manuscript that has changed mylife.’ But this one has done that.” The study, published in the Journal ofSexual Medicine, seemed obvious. The results showed that females in committedrelationships with men who were treated with an impotence drug (Levitra) hadbetter sex. But, the women didn’t just like sex better, they liked it betterbecause their bodies worked better. Lubrication was better. Orgasms were moreintense. They lusted more. The women’s bodies reacted as if they were receivingthe drug. So a drug they didn’t even take affected their bodies. “Her physiologyis linked to him,” Goldstein says. “Men share problems with women, and thesolutions . . . . It totally intrigues me. I can change someone’s physiologywithout treating them. It’s the wildest thing!” In fact, the better a man’sresponse to the drug, the better her response to him.“Entanglement” is a physics concept. Subatomic particles have “partners”—othersubatomic particles—with which they can be entangled, sometimes over greatdistances. If you change one particle, the change affects the other one withwhich it is entangled. Dr. Goldstein’s study is a strong indicator that humanscan be entangled. We change when we fall in love, we become one unit, at leastsexually. The two shall become one, as it says in the Bible. “There are no otherphysiologic abilities of men and women that are shared, and that is what is sofascinating about these data,” Goldstein says. He also says there is someevidence that when he successfully treats women who suffer from dyspareunia, orpain with intercourse, their men get better erections and have more sexualsatisfaction. And he suspects that male partners of women with low libido havepoorer erections and that if those women could be treated, the men wouldimprove, too. Taking care of yourself is taking care of your relationship.7. Sexual novelty can boost lasting love. Some people like routine. It makesthem feel safe and comfortable. Others need variation and new challenges.According to Emory University psychiatrist and researcher Gregory Berns, noveltyis a central factor in achieving and maintaining satisfaction in life and inintimate relationships. He thinks the basal ganglia, which uses theneurotransmitter dopamine, hold the key. He published his findings in a booktitled Satisfaction: The Science of Finding True Fulfillment. He starts hisexploration with a simple question, “What do humans want?” He challenges thebelief that we are driven primarily to pursue pleasure and avoid pain. Rather,Berns finds that “satisfaction comes less from the attainment of a goal and morein what you must do to get there.” With a series of experiments usingcutting-edge functional MRI scanning technology, he sees that the interaction ofdopamine, the neurotransmitter secreted in the brain in anticipation ofpleasure, and cortisol, the chemical released when we are under stress, producesthe feelings people associate with satisfaction. Berns ventures into the worldto demonstrate his ideas, studying the bruised and reddened S&M players, as wellas looking at the ultramarathoners who collapse after a hundred-mile run. Bernsthen brings his journey home, looking at issues in his own marriage and thesexual dissatisfaction that so often plagues long-term relationships. Hisconclusion is simple and compelling: People are wired for novel experience, andwhen we seek it out, we are satisfied. Look for ways to bring novelty into yourintimate relationships. Do things differently, from the way you kiss yourpartner, to the way you show love, to the activities you do together.8. Do something a little edgy. Along the same lines as novelty, getting yourpartners heart rate up may make her more interested in you. She might interpretthe rush as a feeling of excitement for you. One experiment showed that ifpeople experience fear on a date, they often misinterpret that feeling as love.So dates at a theme park may be more successful than a science lecture (unlessit is on the neuroscience of sex). A bungee jump might even seal yourrelationship for life. If you do this with an anxious partner, however, he orshe may leave you behind forever to avoid the fear. It is important toindividualize these suggestions to your partner. For example, being a passengerwith someone who drives fast may be exciting for partners who need excitementand speed, but it may be a disaster for someone who is naturally more cautious.9. Use every sense. Utilize all of your partner’s senses to make yourselfunforgettable. Our five senses are the vehicles that bring the outside world in.They are what sees, hears, tastes, smells, and feels so that we can know anotherperson. A large portion of the brain is dedicated to your senses. It has beenestimated, for example, that 50 percent of the brain is dedicated to vision. Usethese senses to embed yourself deeply into the sensory circuits of yourpartner’s brain. Embedding works best if you are helping to encode good memoriesor feelings, rather than annoying ones. Begin by taking a look at how you emiteach sense and see if there is a way to smooth out any rough edges to makeyourself more desirable, more enticing. For instance, it often amazes me when Ihear couples talking to each other. So often the words and voice tone are sograting that I am sure they are embedding anger and irritation day in and dayout.One way to assess your own voice is to listen to it on a tape recorder. Thesound of your voice can be a powerful elixir of passion or an irritant to thosearound you. I used to be surprised when I heard my recorded voice. It soundeddifferent being played back to me than it did when I heard it while I wastalking. Record your voice and listen to the quality of it. Then, focus onadding a bit of richness or lower tonal quality to your voice and record itagain. When you play it back, hear if your voice sounds more pleasing to you. Ifit does, keep working on it. Initially, it takes practice to be conscious ofsuch aspects of your self, such as the voice, but with time it gets easier. Somepeople benefit from a voice coach to help smooth it out. When I started to doradio and television interviews, I used a wonderful voice coach who was ever sohelpful. When a friend from Buffalo decided to lose some of her accent to domore voiceover work, it took her almost a year of conscious speaking before itbecame her natural sweet voice. I’m not suggesting that anyone change who he isto be more appealing, rather than to augment the natural beauty that alreadyexists within. Just because we develop a habit or certain way of doing somethingdoesn’t mean that it’s the best way to do it. So, be open to using the naturaltalents that exist within you to be more of who you truly are in the worldaround you.Once you have found a nice tonal quality and voice level and speed, leave asultry message for your mate on voice mail. By leaving a recorded message thatis fun and appealing, your mate can play it back, over and over, whenever he orshe needs a lift or a smile. This is a wonderful way of embedding yourself inyour partner’s day-to-day life.Next, look at the other aspects of your senses to see if they can be refined forthe purpose of embedding yourself in your partner’s consciousness. For instance,it’s nice to take some time to get a manicure and pedicure, shave and groom afew extra moments, check your breath, keep your lips soft and supple for moresensual kisses, find a scent that your partner likes and wear it to embed yourodor on clothing that he or she will smell throughout the day. If you like tocook or draw, make something special and send it along on his or her journey forthe day. Take pictures of yourself, as well as yourself and your partner, inclothing or environments that would inspire your mate while looking at it. Framethat picture and give it as a gift or place it somewhere where it will be seenoften. In feng shui, it is believed that a loved one’s picture placed in view ofthe bed is good for that relationship. Flowers or little knickknacks that yourmate would like as gifts are nice reminders that you are near, as these itemscan be placed within immediate sight. Use every sense available, be it smell,sight, sound, taste or touch.Here are more sensory specific ideas: Vision. Give pictures of yourself and your loved one embracing. Wear sexyclothes. Go shopping with your partner and let him or her help you pick out partof your wardrobe. Wear clothes that he or she likes on you. Take care of yourappearance. Find out if there are any visual cues that upset your partner andtake care of them if possible. Add candles or a fire to the environment. Thelight from gentle flames often enhances sensuality. Sound. Watch the sound and tone of your voice. Decrease distractions when youare together. Music is a wonderful way to connect with your partner. Byintroducing your mate to new sounds and choosing “your song” together, a switchwill be flipped to remind her of you whenever she hears it. This can be adouble-edged sword if you break up. One woman I dated once made me a fabulousmix CD of my favorite songs and a few of hers. I was so touched by this gesturethat every time I played the CD I had kind thoughts of her. Be conscious of yourpartner’s taste in music and when a new album comes out or that band comes totown that he really likes, buy tickets and experience his favorite soundstogether. Learn to dance together to this music. Perhaps, even create exoticdances that you can do for your partner to melodies that are really impassioningto them. The subconscious power of music is one of the most powerful elixirs ofpassion that can be utilized to strengthen a long-term partnership. Smell. Put sweet fragrances in the environment, such as flowers or potpourri.Cook his or her favorite foods. Use some of the aphrodisiac foods and scentsfrom Lesson Nine. Take a shower, or not, before you make love. Check with yourpartner to see what he or she likes best. Napoleon specifically asked Josephinenot to take baths for two weeks before he came home from battle; he loved hernatural scent. Touch. Touch is very important in the embedding process. Learn to touch yourpartner in subtle, pleasing ways, be it massaging while she is driving orworking at the computer, placing your hand on her while you are talking,brushing your head against his body as you walk by, kissing her in places thatare pleasing to her throughout the day, learning to massage him in ways thatcreate ecstasy, and learning to sleep so that some part of you and your partneris in contact. Every sense is an entry point to embed yourself in your partner’smind. If you take the time to do this practice, it will make all the differencein the world in your intimate encounters and longevity of your relationship.Kisses belong under touch and taste. Remember the very strange-looking littleman, the homunculus, that represented the sensory strip in the brain thatprocesses touch? He has very large lips, because there are millions of nerveendings in the brain dedicated to lips. Kisses are critical to bonding. Do youhave lips that fit your partner’s? Learn to use your lips in ways that pleasehim or her. Pay attention (use your prefrontal cortex) when kissing. Whatstimulates him or her? What causes her to moan and come back for more? Lingerwhen you kiss. I once read a book by Ellen Kreidman called The 10 Second Kiss. Ithought it was a brilliant embedding technique. Her premise was that rather thangiving a quick peck to your partner to say hello or good-bye, spend ten secondsand make the moment last. She says that a “10-second kiss” can transform asimple act into a clear message of “I love you” each and every day. Thetechnique takes communication to a level so deep, it’s magical. Eliminate pecks;we are not chickens. Taste. Avoid bad tastes and enhance great ones. Kissing someone with the tasteof candy or cinnamon on their lips can be very sexy. Take care of bad breath,but see what tastes your partner loves. Someone may really think Listerinemouthwash is the sweet elixir of passion, while others might feel it remindsthem of going into surgery. Check out what your partner likes. Also, keep thegenital area as tasty as possible. Some people love performing oral sex on theirpartner after they have bathed, others prefer a more natural state. Ask. Feedingeach other during meals can also be very exciting. When you taste something youlove, feeding it to your partner with words like, “This is great, try it,” showsher that her pleasure is on your mind. 10. Do something great for someone your partner loves. When we take care ofimportant people in our partner’s life, we take care of him or her. This is oneof the most powerful bonding techniques I know. When you care for your partner’schildren, parents, friends, employees, or even pets, the partner’s limbic brainis grateful and you become more deeply embedded in his or her consciousness. Iam often amazed at how many people do not understand this technique. Given thatthere are many second and third marriages in our society, dealing with apartner’s children is often an important issue. Setting up competition orconflict between a new love and his or her children almost always leads todisaster. In bonding to someone, spend time with his or her children, or helpher parents and you will be much more likely to be solidified in her head.11. Summarize and immortalize loving moments. When you have great moments withyour lover, write them down and send your missive to him or her. When youexperience a great moment, that by itself helps to embed it into memory; whenyou then take the time to write it down, it helps to further engrain it into thememory tracks of the emotional brain.Writing loving thoughts have occurred from the beginning of recorded history.Bridegroom, dear to my heart,Goodly is your beauty, honeysweet . . . .Bridegroom, I would be taken by you to the bedchamber.You have captivated me,Let me stand tremblingly before you.That’s the enticing start to the oldest love known poem in the world. Scholarsdiscovered the poem over a hundred years ago buried in the ancient sands ofIraq. The poem was written around 2030 BC by a Sumerian scribe from the city ofUr using a reed stylus on wet clay, which was then baked, preserving the tabletof passion for forty centuries. The passion, scholars say, was part of aMesopotamian festival ritual of fertility and power called Sacred Marriage.12. Learn from parrots. Neurologist Barbara Wilson has trained and kept parrotsfor years. She says that they have taught her a lot about relationships (nokidding): Share your food with the one that you love, groom each other, singconstantly, build nests together, and repeat each other’s words and actions! Ifpeople would think like parrots, all babies would be planned. Parrots don’t justrandomly mate. First, they have to genuinely like the other bird. Then there hasto be a constant reliable source of food, light, and stability. Then there hasto be a nest box. The male inspects it first, then the female. The female waitsuntil the male feeds her. Only then do they get frisky. If one dies, the otherone in the mated pair grieves and mourns and has been known to just up and die,too.Barbara once had a mealy Amazon parrot that she rescued from a too small cage ata breeder’s farm. Having been stolen from the wild (you can trace their importorigin from the type and numbering on the band on their leg), the female birdhad not seen another mealy (specific subspecies of parrot with its own squawkinglanguage) since its infancy. She was depressed and overweight from being in theconfining cage. Barbara put the bird in a large cage, where the parrot gotsignificantly better, but still she was lonely. Barbara never heard a peep outof the bird, even when she once cut her toenail too short. Barbara did someInternet parrot dating for the bird and found a single male of her subspecies insouth Texas. After several e-mails, phone calls, and high-level bird trading,Barbara drove sixteen hours round-trip to get her parrot a “man.” When shebrought the male back, both birds were ecstatic. They squawked for hours at loudvolume. The two birds dated for three weeks. They would not share a cage.Barbara opened the two cages, they would meet on top, and squawk for hours.Eventually they groomed each other, then each night they would go back to theirown cage. Finally, Barbara says she had a talk with them on the human facts oflife: She only had room for one big cage and was tired of cleaning two cages, solike it or not, they were going to have to live together. They slept on separateperches for three more months despite genuinely loving each other. The femalelost weight and looked years younger due to the affection. Then they slepttogether, ate together, and made a life that worked.When you ask her about parrot behavior, she says, “It’s just your own behaviorand words repeated back to you. And if you ignore them they start to bite andpick their feathers, and you wonder why you have a mean and ugly bird.” Aftershe achieved success with parrots (she had a flock of twelve at one time), shedecided it was time to find a husband. Really cool fact, she tells me, men catchon quicker than birds.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lesson #10: Make it last by leaving enduring impressions on your partner’sbrain.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_020_r1.jpg]FIX THE BRAIN ISSUES THAT GET IN THE WAY OF SEXimage [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_005_r1.jpg]PMS, Depression, ADD, Substance Abuse, Denial, and Being a JerkGet away, get away, get away, get awayGet away cause I’m pms-ing—“PMS,” MARY J. BLIGECelia and Greg fell madly in love for five weeks. They met on Match.com shortlyafter Labor Day. On the surface they seemed like a perfect couple. They wereboth well educated, caring, hardworking, and had similar lifestyle habits. Theattraction was amazing, even between their families. Greg loved Celia’s littlegirl, and Greg’s teenage girls got along very well with Celia. With new lovecomes hope. They were together most days and on the phone for several hours aday when they were apart. Five weeks into the passionate relationship thingsstarted to abruptly change. Celia started to back up. She became distant,irritable, and short tempered. Nothing Greg did seemed right. Even though shewas fully involved with moving the relationship forward, she felt the need tobacktrack. Greg felt disoriented. What happened?, he wondered. Initially, hefelt anxious at the change. He had met few women as wonderful as Celia, fewwomen that took his breath away. But he did as Celia wanted. That still didn’tseem good enough and Celia broke off the relationship. Greg felt very sad. ThenCelia started her menstrual period. She was horrified by her behavior and forlosing Greg. When she called him, he was happy to hear from her, but hurtingfrom what happened. He was gun shy. Premenstrual tension syndrome (PMS) is realand causes real problems in the brain and in relationships.It is not just PMS that can ruin relationships. Other brain problems, such asdepression, ADD, substance abuse, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsivedisorder, and personality disorders also interfere with love. Understanding andtreating these problems is critical to healthy relationships and healthy sex. Inthis chapter, I will explore the most common brain ailments interfering withlove and sex that we see in our clinics and give you a way to think about how toget the best help for them. Some people will need psychotherapy; some will needmedication; others will need more directed guidance with supplements or otheralternative treatments. I will also help you decide if and when you need to seekprofessional help. In lecturing around the world, I am frequently asked thefollowing questions: When is it time to see a professional about my brain? Whatshould I do when a loved one is in denial about needing help? How do I go aboutfinding a competent professional?A Quick View of Common Brain Problems Affecting Love and SexPMSWhen I saw patients with PMS after I started my brain-imaging work in 1991, Ijust had to look. Now I know more about PMS than I want to. I have five sistersand two daughters. Plus, I have an ex-lover (I’ll call her Laura) who sufferedfrom severe PMS. She loved me passionately for the first seven days of hermenstrual cycle, was very neutral on me for the next fourteen days, and justseemed to hate me for the last seven days or so of her cycle. Laura’s behaviorthe first seven days of her cycle kept me hooked into the relationship. Ourrelationship was being intermittently reinforced, a psychological term aboutlearning behavior; when someone is reinforced occasionally or intermittently, itcauses them to want to stay in a relationship, hoping for more.Over the past years we have scanned many women with PMS just before the onset oftheir period, during the worst time of their cycle, and then again a week afterthe onset of their period, during the best time. Even though brain-SPECT scansare very consistent from day to day in most people, they can radically change inwomen with PMS. I knew from my own experience with Laura that likely the PMSbrain changed over the month. When PMS is present, we see dramatic differencesbetween the scans. When a woman feels good, her deep limbic system (emotionalbrain) is calm and cool and she has good activity in her temporal lobes (moodstability and memory) and prefrontal cortex (judgment). Right before her period,when she feels the worst, her deep limbic system and anterior cingulate gyrus(worry center) is often overactive and she has poor activity in her temporallobes and prefrontal cortex!I have seen two PMS patterns, clinically, and on SPECT, that respond todifferent treatments. One pattern is increased deep limbic activity oftenaccompanied by poor activity in the temporal lobes, which correlates with cyclicmood changes and anger. This finding often responds best to anticonvulsantmedications, such as Depakote, Neurontin, Lamictal, or Tegretol. Thesemedications tend to even out moods, calm inner tension, decrease irritability,and help people feel more comfortable in their own skin.The second PMS pattern that I have noted is increased deep limbic activity inconjunction with increased anterior cingulate gyrus activity. The anteriorcingulate, as we have seen, is the part of the brain associated with shiftingattention. Women with this pattern often complain of increased sadness,worrying, repetitive negative thoughts and verbalizations (nagging), andcognitive inflexibility. This pattern usually responds much better tomedications that enhance serotonin availability in the brain, such as Lexapro,Zoloft, and Prozac. Here are two examples. Brittany. Brittany was a thirty-eight-year-old married female referred forevaluation of suicidal thoughts, depression, and temper flares. She alsoexperienced problems with anxiety, excessive tension, and overeating. Theseproblems occurred primarily during the last ten days of her menstrual cycle andabated two to three days after the onset of menses. On several occasions sheseparated from her husband within the seven days prior to the onset of herperiod; on one occasion, she lashed out at him physically. The patient and herhusband confirmed the cyclic changes to her symptoms. Both Brittany and herhusband kept a symptom log over the next month. On Day 27 (of a twenty-nine-daycycle) Brittany called the clinic saying that she was having problems withsuicidal thoughts and depression. She was scanned the same day. Her SPECT studyrevealed significant increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus andmarked decreased activity in the left temporal lobe and prefrontal cortexbilaterally. She was then scanned on Day 8 of the next menstrual cycle when shewas symptom free. Her follow-up scan revealed improved temporal lobe andprefrontal cortex function but persistent cingulate hyperactivity. Due to theclear temporal lobe problems, Brittany was placed on the anticonvulsantDepakote, which stabilized her temper outbursts and suicidal thoughts. Theserotonergic antidepressant Zoloft was then added a month later due topersistent premenstrual sadness. Three years later she remains symptom free. Anne. Anne was a thirty-three-year-old married female referred for evaluation ofsuicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety, and irritability. These problemsoccurred predominantly during the last week of her menstrual cycle andsignificantly let up several days after the onset of menses. She had experienceda postpartum depression after the birth of one child but not after the birth ofher other two children. Anne and her husband confirmed the cyclic changes to hersymptoms. Both she and her husband kept a symptom log over the next month. OnDay 25 (of a twenty-eight-day cycle) Anne called the clinic complaining ofsevere agitation and moodiness. She was scanned the same day. Her SPECT studyrevealed significant increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus and deeplimbic regions. She was then scanned on Day 10 of the next menstrual cycle whenshe was symptom free. Her follow-up scan revealed excess activity in theanterior cingulate gyrus and deep limbic system. Lexapro was very effective incalming her symptoms. Two years later she remains symptom free during thepremenstrual period.Mood DisordersMood disorders severely affect libido and relationships. Depression is oftenassociated with low libido, negativity, and a higher divorce rate. The “up” ormanic phase of bipolar disorder can be associated with impulsivity,hypersexuality, and hyperreligiosity.DepressionBurl, a fifty-two-year-old contractor, husband and father of two boys, wasreferred to me because he was tired all the time. His family physician ruled outthe physical causes of fatigue and thought he was stressed. Additionally, he hadtrouble focusing at work and had trouble sleeping. His caffeine use went way up,but it didn’t help his energy, just made him edgy. His sex drive was gone, hisappetite was poor, and he had no interest in doing things with his family. Burlwould cry for no apparent reason and he even began to entertain suicidalthoughts. Burl had a serious depressive illness.Depression is a very common brain illness. Studies reveal that at any point intime, 3 to 6 percent of the population have a significant depression. Only 20 to25 percent of these people ever seek help. This is unfortunate becausedepression is a very treatable problem.The following is a list of symptoms commonly associated with depression:• sad, blue, or gloomy mood• low energy, frequent fatigue• lack of ability to feel pleasure in usually pleasurable activities• irritability• poor concentration, distractibility, poor memory• suicidal thoughts, feelings of meaninglessness• feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, and worthlessness• changes in sleep, either poor sleep with frequent awakenings or increasedsleep• changes in appetite, either markedly decreased or increased• social withdrawal• low self-esteem.Early detection and treatment is important to a full and complete recovery. Myimaging work has revealed that there are multiple types of depression andtreatment needs to be specifically tailored to the type. See my book HealingAnxiety and Depression (written with Lisa Routh).Bipolar DisorderPatricia is a twenty-eight-year-old married mother of two children. She had aperiod of depression six months earlier and had been prescribed anantidepressant by her OB/GYN. Initially she felt much better. Then she startedslowly having trouble sleeping. Her thoughts raced, she became more irritableand much more sexual. She was used to having sex several times a week with herhusband, but now wanted it every day. She propositioned three of her malecoworkers, which was out of character. Two of her coworkers took her up on heroffer and she ended up contracting herpes, which she gave to her husband. On theverge of divorce, they came to see me. Patricia had bipolar disorder triggeredby the antidepressant, which is not an uncommon scenario. It is sad to thinkthat an improperly treated psychiatric illness can tear apart families. With theright treatment, which included a mood stabilizer and fish oil, Patricia and herhusband did much better.Bipolar disorder is a mood illness where people cycle between two poles ofemotion. There may be periods of depression that alternate with periods of high,manic, irritable, or elated moods. Mania is categorized as a state distinct fromone’s normal self, where there is greater energy, racing thoughts, impulsivity,a decreased need for sleep, and a sense of grandiosity. It is often associatedwith periods of hypersexuality, hyperreligiosity, or spending sprees. Sometimesit is also associated with hallucinations or delusions. In treating thedepressive part of the cycle, both pharmaceutical and supplementalantidepressants have been known to stimulate manic episodes. It is important tovigorously treat this disorder, as it has been associated with marital problems,substance abuse, and suicide.Here is a list of symptoms often associated with bipolar disorder:1. Periods of abnormally elevated, depressed, or anxious mood2. Periods of decreased need for sleep, feeling energetic on dramatically lesssleep than usual3. Periods of grandiose notions, ideas, or plans4. Periods of increased talking or pressured speech5. Periods of too many thoughts racing through the mind6. Periods of markedly increased energy7. Periods of poor judgment leading to risk-taking behavior (separate from usualbehavior)8. Periods of inappropriate social behavior9. Periods of irritability or aggression10. Periods of delusional or psychotic thinking.Bipolar I, which used to be called manic depressive illness, is thought to bethe more classic form of this disorder. In recent years, a milder form of thedisorder, called Bipolar II, has been described; it is associated withdepressive episodes and milder “hypomanic” issues.The treatment for bipolar disorder, both I and II, is usually medication, suchas lithium or anticonvulsants such as Depakote. Recent literature suggests thathigh doses of omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish or flaxseed oil, can also behelpful.Antidepressants and Romantic LoveDepression inhibits romantic love. People who are depressed tend to be negative,socially isolated, and often have little interest in sex. They might also havesuicidal feelings, which are usually a turnoff to potential partners. Treatingdepression is essential for people to have healthy relationships. Yet, thespecific type of treatment can either enhance or hurt attraction in romanticlove. In my imaging work I have discovered that depression is not one illnessand that the treatment needs to be tailored individually. In general, however,bupropion (Wellbutrin) is prosexual and enhances sexual feelings and function.It enhances dopamine availability in the brain and increases attention andfocus. It is useful to treat depressions associated with low energy. SSRIs,useful in treating depression associated with obsessive thinking, can jeopardizeromantic love. Low serotonin levels help explain the obsessive thinking commonin early romantic love. In a study by Helen Fisher, subjects reported that theythought about their loved one 95 percent of the day and couldn’t stop thinkingabout them. This kind of obsessive thinking is comparable toobsessive-compulsive disorder, also characterized by low serotonin levels.Serotonin-enhancing antidepressants blunt the emotions, including the elation ofromance, and suppress obsessive thinking, a critical component of romance. “Whenyou inhibit this brain system,” Dr. Fisher warns, “you can inhibit yourpatient’s well-being and possibly their genetic future.” These antidepressantsalso inhibit orgasm, clitoral stimulation, penile erection, and seminal fluid.From an anthropological perspective, Dr. Fisher concludes, “a woman who can’tget an orgasm may fail to distinguish Mr. Right from Mr. Wrong.” As one woman onan SSRI told me, “I thought I no longer was attracted to my husband.” In astudy, women on SSRIs rated male faces as more unattractive, a process calledcourtship blunting. Seminal fluid contains dopamine and norepinephrine, oxytocinand vasopressin, testosterone and estrogen. Without an orgasm, men may lose theability to send courtship signals. These warnings should encourage us to lookfor alternative treatments in depression.Anxiety DisordersThere are five common types of anxiety disorders that can affect people’srelationships, moods, and sexuality in a negative way: panic disorders,agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, andperformance anxiety. I’ll briefly discuss each of these and their treatments.Panic DisorderHealthy sexuality is usually enhanced by a sense of safety and peacefulness. Butwhat if all of a sudden your heart starts to pound. You get this feeling ofincredible dread. Your breathing rate goes faster. You start to sweat. Yourmuscles get tight, and your hands feel like ice. Your mind starts to race aboutevery terrible thing that could possibly happen and you feel as though you’regoing to lose your mind if you don’t get out of the current situation. You’vejust had a panic attack. Panic attacks are one of the most common braindisorders. It is estimated that 6 to 7 percent of adults will at some point intheir lives suffer from recurrent panic attacks. They often begin in lateadolescence or early adulthood but may spontaneously occur later in life. If aperson has three attacks within a three-week period, doctors make a diagnosis ofa panic disorder.In a typical panic attack, a person has at least four of the following twelvesymptoms: shortness of breath, heart pounding, chest pain, choking or smotheringfeelings, dizziness, tingling of hands or feet, feeling unreal, hot or coldflashes, sweating, faintness, trembling or shaking, and a fear of dying or goingcrazy. When the panic attacks first start, many people end up in the emergencyroom because they think they’re having a heart attack. Some people even end upbeing admitted to the hospital.Anticipation anxiety is one of the most difficult symptoms for a person who hasa panic disorder. These people are often extremely skilled at predicting theworst in situations. In fact, it is often the anticipation of a bad event thatbrings on a panic attack. For example, you are in the grocery store and worrythat you’re going to have an anxiety attack and pass out on the floor. Then, youpredict, everyone in the store will look at you and laugh. Pretty quickly thesymptoms begin. Sometimes a panic disorder can become so severe that a personbegins to avoid almost any situation outside of home—a condition calledagoraphobia.Panic attacks can occur for a variety of different reasons. Sometimes they arecaused by medical illnesses, such as hyper-thyroidism, which is why it’s alwaysimportant to have a physical examination and screening blood work. Sometimespanic attacks can be brought on by excessive caffeine intake or alcoholwithdrawal. Hormonal changes also seem to play a role. Panic attacks in womenare seen more frequently at the end of their menstrual cycle, after having ababy, or during menopause. Traumatic events from the past that somehow getunconsciously triggered can also precipitate a series of attacks. Commonly,there is a family history of panic attacks, alcohol abuse, or other mentalillnesses.On SPECT scans we often see hyperactivity in the basal ganglia, or sometimestemporal lobe problems. Psychotherapy is my preferred treatment for thisdisorder and in some studies has been shown to calm basal ganglia activity.Sometimes supplements or medications can also be helpful. Unfortunately the mosthelpful medications are also addictive, so care is needed.AgoraphobiaThe name agoraphobia comes from a Greek word that means “fear of themarketplace.” In behavioral terms it means the fear of being alone in publicplaces. The underlying worry is that the person will lose control or becomeincapacitated and no one will be there to help. People afflicted with thisphobia begin to avoid being in crowds, in stores, or on busy streets. They’reoften afraid of being in tunnels, on bridges, in elevators, or on publictransportation. They usually insist that a family member or a friend accompanythem when they leave home. If the fear establishes a foothold in the person, itmay affect his or her whole life. Normal activities become increasinglyrestricted as the fears or avoidance behaviors dominate their life.Agoraphobic symptoms often begin in the late teen years or early twenties, butI’ve seen them start when a person is in their fifties or sixties. Often,without knowing what is wrong, people will try to medicate themselves withexcessive amounts of alcohol or drugs. This illness occurs more frequently inwomen and many who have it experienced significant separation anxiety aschildren. Additionally, there may be a history of excessive anxiety, panicattacks, depression, or alcohol abuse in relatives.Agoraphobia often evolves out of panic attacks that seem to occur “out of theblue,” for no apparent reason. These attacks are so frightening that the personbegins to avoid any situation that may be in any way associated with the fear. Ithink these initial panic attacks are often triggered by unconscious events oranxieties from the past. For example, I once treated a patient who had beenraped as a teenager in a park late at night. When she was twenty-eight, she hadher first panic attack while walking late at night in a park with her husband.It was the park setting late at night that she associated with the fear of beingraped and which triggered the panic attack. Agoraphobia is a very frighteningillness to the patient and his or her family. With effective, earlyintervention, however, there is significant hope for recovery. The scan findingsand treatment are similar to those for people with panic disorder. The onedifference is that people with agoraphobia often have increased anteriorcingulate gyrus activity and get stuck in their fear of having more panicattacks. Getting stuck in the fear often prevents them from leaving home. Usingmedications, such as Prozac and Lexapro, or supplements, such as 5-HTP and St.John’s wort, to increase serotonin and calm this part of the brain is oftenhelpful.Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (see Lesson Eight)Posttraumatic Stress DisorderJoanne, a thirty-four-year-old travel agent, was held up in her office atgunpoint by two men. Four or five times during the robbery, one of the men helda gun to her head and said he was going to kill her. She graphically imaginedher brain being splattered with blood against the wall. Near the end of thisfifteen-minute ordeal, they made her take off all her clothes. She picturedherself being brutally raped by them. They left without touching her, but lockedher in a closet.Since that time her life had been thrown into turmoil. She felt tense, and wasplagued with flashbacks and nightmares of the robbery. Her stomach was in knotsand she had a constant headache. Whenever she went out, she felt panicky. Shewas frustrated that she could not calm her body: her heart raced, she was shortof breath, and her hands were constantly cold and sweaty. She hated how she feltand she was angry about how her nice life had turned into a nightmare. What wasmost upsetting to her were the ways that the robbery affected her marriage andher child. Her baby picked up the tension and was very fussy. Every time shetried to make love with her husband, she began to cry and get images of the menraping her. Joanne had posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a brain reaction tosevere traumatic events such as a robbery, rape, car accident, earthquake,tornado, or even a volcanic eruption. Her symptoms are classic for PTSD,especially the flashbacks and nightmares of the event.The worst symptoms came from the horrible thoughts about what never happened,such as seeing her brain splattered against the wall and being raped. Thesethoughts were registered in her subconscious as fact, and until she enteredtreatment she was not able to recognize how much damage they had been doing. Forexample, when she imagined that she was being raped, a part of her began tobelieve that she actually was raped. The first time she had her period after therobbery, she began to cry with relief that she was not impregnated by therobbers, even though they never touched her. A part of her even believed she wasdead because she had so vividly pictured her own death. A significant portion ofher treatment was geared to counteract these erroneous subconscious conclusions.Without treatment, PTSD can literally ruin a person’s life. The most effectivetreatment is usually psychotherapy. One type of psychotherapy that I think worksespecially well for PTSD is called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing(EMDR). You can learn more about this technique in my book Healing Anxiety andDepression or visiting www.emdria.org. Depending on the severity of PTSD,certain types of medications and supplements can also be helpful.Performance AnxietyFeeling anxious or nervous before speaking or performing in front of a group isone of the most common fears of human beings. Many people hate feeling judged,scrutinized, or “on the spot.” As anxiety levels go up in the brain,thoughtfulness usually goes down. This is particularly true with sexualperformance. It is very common for lovers, especially new lovers, to want toplease their partners. They feel anxious and their nerves tend to get in the wayof sexual play and enjoyment. Often this type of anxiety is associated with whatI call Fortune Telling ANTs. ANT stands for automatic negative thoughts. Theseare the thoughts that go through your head automatically and ruin your day.Fortune-telling ANTs are the thoughts that predict a bad turnout, even thoughthere is no evidence for the idea. Examples include, “He will not like my body.”“She will think I have a small penis.” “I will come too quickly.” “I have tofake an orgasm, or he will not be happy with me.” The problem withfortune-telling ANTs is that your brain makes happen what it sees. If youpredict failure, you are more likely to fail. For example, when you see yourselfnot pleasing your partner, the subsequent anxiety will interfere with yourfeeling relaxed and present, in the moment; then you will not read his or herbody language and end up missing important clues to making it a special sexualtime. Learning how to calm performance anxiety, through correcting negativethoughts, deep breathing, and meditation, is essential for great sex.Attention Deficit DisorderIn my lectures I often ask, “How many people are married? Raise your hands.”Usually, a good portion of the audience raises their hands. “Is it helpful,” Iask next, “to say everything you think in your marriage?” Everyone laughs. “Ofcourse not,” I continue, “relationships require tact, they requirethoughtfulness. Saying everything you think is usually a disaster inrelationships.” Unfortunately, you need healthy PFC activity to suppress thesneaky thoughts that just creep through your brain.Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is usually associated with lowPFC activity and people are more likely to blurt out, without forethought.Do you often feel restless? Have trouble concentrating? Have trouble withimpulsiveness, either doing or saying things you wish you hadn’t? Do you fail tofinish many projects you start? Are you easily bored or quick to anger? If theanswer to most of these questions is yes, you might have attention deficitdisorder (ADD).ADD is the most common brain problem in children and adults, affecting 8 to 10percent of the United States population. The main symptoms of ADD are a shortattention span, distractibility, disorganization, procrastination, and poorinternal supervision. It is often, but not always, associated with impulsivebehavior and hyperactivity or restlessness. Until recently, most people thoughtthat children outgrew this disorder during their teenage years. For many, thisis false. While it is true that the hyperactivity lessens over time, the othersymptoms of impulsivity, distractibility, and a short attention span remain formost sufferers into adulthood. Current research shows that 60 to 80 percent ofADD children never fully outgrow this disorder.Common symptoms of the adult form of ADD include poor organization and planning,procrastination, trouble listening carefully to directions, distractibility,short attention span, relationship problems, and excessive traffic violations.Additionally, people with adult ADD are often late for appointments, frequentlymisplace things, may be quick to anger, and have poor follow-through. There mayalso be frequent impulsive job or relationship changes and poor financialmanagement. Substance abuse, especially alcohol or amphetamines and cocaine, andlow self-esteem are also common.Many people do not recognize the seriousness of this disorder and just pass offthese kids and adults as lazy, defiant, or willful. Yet, ADD is a seriousdisorder. Left untreated, it affects a person’s self-esteem, socialrelationships, and ability to learn and work. Several studies have shown thatADD children use twice as many medical services as non-ADD kids, up to 35percent of untreated ADD teens never finish high school, 52 percent of untreatedadults abuse substances, teens and adults with ADD have more traffic accidents,and adults with ADD move four times more than others.Many adults tell me that when they were children, they were in trouble all thetime and had a real sense that there was something very different about them.Even though many of the adults I treat with ADD are very bright, they arefrequently frustrated by not living up to their potential.From our research with SPECT scans, it is clear that ADD is a brain disorder,but not one simple disorder. I have described six different types of ADD. Themost common feature of ADD is decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex with aconcentration task. This means that the harder a person tries, the less brainactivity they have to work with. Many people with ADD self-medicate withstimulants, such as caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, or methamphetamine, to increaseactivity in the PFC. They also tend to self-medicate with conflict-seekingbehavior. If they can get someone upset, it helps to stimulate their brain. Ofcourse, they have no idea they do this behavior. I call it unconscious,brain-driven behavior. But, if you are around ADD people long enough, you willsee and feel the conflict-seeking behavior.The best treatment for ADD depends on the type of ADD a person has. See my bookHealing ADD for a complete description of types and treatments. In general,intense exercise helps, as does a higher protein, lower carbohydrate diet.Sometimes medications or supplements are helpful, but sometimes they can makethings worse if they are not right. When correctly targeted, ADD is a highlytreatable disorder.Being a Jerk or a BitchI know “being a jerk” or “being a bitch” are not medical diagnostic terms. Theyare negative, name-calling phrases about someone’s behavior. Yet, in myexperience, it is possible that these behaviors are the result of poor brainfunction and not completely under conscious will. Sometimes, a head injury,toxic exposure, sleep deprivation, and personality disorders (see below) caninterfere with someone’s effectiveness in social and sexual situations.Our character can be defined in part by the way we interact with others. Whenthe way in which we interact with others doesn’t work, when we notice a patternof multiple relationships and multiple disconnections, it may be that apersonality disorder is at the root of the problem. The term personalitydisorder implies inflexible and long-standing patterns of experience andbehavior (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, or DSM-IV)that impair healthy functioning. They can be the source of great personal painfor the person suffering and those he or she loves. A personality disorder cansabotage relationships, prevent the realization of desired goals, and impede ourmoral development and our spiritual and sexual health. When we are preoccupied,for example, with intrusive thoughts, deep fears of abandonment, or feelings ofparanoia or superiority, it’s hard to reach beyond the self to the expansiveconcerns of spirit and morality. It’s hard to be our best selves. A person witha personality disorder may feel inexplicably apart from a sense of well-being,of closeness to others, and to God. It may be hard for someone with apersonality disorder to feel empathy and thus to feel part of a reciprocallyloving community. Feelings of isolation and disconnectedness can lead to thesense of life being meaningless and to devaluing one’s own individualcontributions. This sense of aloneness and lack of purpose can place people withpersonality disorders at higher risk for suicide. Personality is what we presentto the outside world. It is not the true self, which is broader and deeper thanthe outward-appearance self. When we think of working on aspects of thepersonality, we think not of correcting flaws but of opening doors to greaterjoy and connectedness.Personality disorders have been traditionally resistant to psychotherapy.Traditional psychiatric thought has focused on developmental causes of thesedisorders rather than brain abnormalities. It has been my experience that manypeople labeled as personality disordered are really brain disordered. Theimplications for treatment are immense—do we talk someone through theirdifficult behaviors or try to change their brain? Probably we need both.Antisocial Personality DisorderAntisocial personality disorder is characterized by a long-standing pattern ofdisregard for the rights of others and may be an extension of conduct disorderseen in adolescence. The likelihood of developing antisocial personalitydisorder seems increased in young children with conduct disorder and ADD. Peoplewith antisocial personality disorder frequently break rules, inhabit prisons,and have constant relationship and work problems. They often get into fights.With little or no empathy, they may steal, destroy property, manipulate ordeceive others for their ends. They tend to be impulsive and lacking inforethought. Traditionally, these people are thought of as evil, bad, andsinful. The work of psychologist Adrienne Raine of the University of SouthernCalifornia has seriously challenged this notion. Dr. Raine found that comparedto a group of healthy men, the MRI scans of the men with antisocial personalitydisorder showed decreased PFC volume. They are likely dealing with less accessto the brain part that controls conscience, free will, right and wrong, and goodand evil. A fascinating additional finding of Dr. Raine’s work was that peoplewith antisocial personality disorder also had slower heart rates than thecontrol group and decreased sweat gland activity. Lower heart rates and sweatgland activity are often associated with low anxiety states (your hands sweatand your heart races when you are anxious). Could this mean that people withthis type of difficult temperament do not have enough internal anxiety? Couldthe PFC be involved with appropriate anxiety? Intriguing questions. For example,most people feel anxious before they do something bad or risky. If I neededmoney, and got the thought in my head to rob the local grocery store, my nextthoughts would be filled with anxiety: “I don’t want to get caught.”“I don’t like institutional food.”“I don’t want to be thought of as a criminal.”“I could lose my medical license.” The anxiety would prevent me from acting out on the bad thoughts. But, what if,as Dr. Raine’s study suggests, I do not have enough anxiety and I get an evilthought in my head like, “Go rob the store”? With poor PFC activity (a lousyinternal supervisor with little to no anxiety), I am likely to rob the storewithout considering all of the consequences to my behavior. There is aninteresting treatment implication from this work. Typically, psychiatrists tryto help lessen a person’s anxiety. Maybe we have it backward for people withantisocial personality disorder; for them we should try to increase theiranxiety.Narcissistic Personality DisorderPeople with narcissistic personality disorder believe that they are special andmore unique or gifted than other people. They require constant admiration andrecognition for their achievements. A sense of entitlement derived from abolstered sense of superiority may lead people with narcissistic personalitydisorder to place great demands on others, expecting their needs to be metimmediately, regardless of the inconvenience. Although they may appearconfident, they may in fact have very low self-esteem, which they attempt toboost by association with others they imagine being as gifted as they. They mayseek connections exclusively with those whom they perceive to be as special andform alliances solely to advance their careers or other endeavors. While lackingempathy and ability to listen patiently to others’ concerns, a person withnarcissistic personality disorder may spend an inordinate amount of timethinking about what others think of her or him. People with narcissisticpersonality disorder may belittle or be envious of others’ achievements and beunwilling to acknowledge contributions others make to their own successes. Aperson with narcissistic personality disorder may appear to be rude,condescending, and arrogant, criticizing others while being unable to toleratecriticism him- or herself. A person with NPD often seesaws between a depressedmood because of feelings of shame or humiliation and grandiosity. As with otherpersonality disorders, a person with narcissistic personality disorder maysuffer from additional problems such as anorexia, substance abuse, anxiety, anddepression. People with narcissistic personality disorders may have overactivecingulate systems, disallowing them to see outside themselves and to take abroader perspective. Poor prefrontal lobe activity may cause the lack of empathyso pronounced in this disorder.A feeling of social connectedness is the basis of a healthy soul and character.Clinging to the notion that you might be better than others, somehow moreprivileged or entitled, erects barriers between you and the people to whom youwant to get close and makes it impossible to empathize with others’ needs.Protecting yourself with distancing tactics such as criticism, disinterest inothers’ problems, belittling others, or refusing to acknowledge theiraccomplishments makes it tough to develop a sense of security and companionship,of being loved. It’s very hard to make moral decisions from this place, from theposition of “What I need is most important.” Persistent focus on yourself, yourappearance, how others see you, and the neediness that accompanies theseanxiety-provoking concerns takes you away from your true self, the self that canfocus on what you really care about and what you want your life to be about.Because people with narcissistic personalities disorder may sometimes accomplishexternal goals, it can be hard to discern the reasons for a lack ofconnectedness and a hollow spiritual life. Identifying with others; being ableto be humble, grateful, and kind; to listen; and to truly appreciate others’caring and contributions to your life readies you to receive spiritual learning.Borderline Personality DisorderInstability in relationships, impulsivity, and low self-esteem characterizeborderline personality disorder. People with borderline personality disorder mayquickly switch attitudes toward others, identifications, values, and goals. Forexample, someone with borderline personality disorder may worship a new friendor lover and then drop him or her quickly, complaining that their new friendwasn’t caring enough. Professional goals and interests may change suddenly, asmay moods. Highly reactive and impulsive, they may experience periods of extremeirritability, anger, or anxiety. They may engage in self-destructive behaviorssuch as drinking heavily, driving fast, overspending, bingeing on food, orhaving unsafe sex. People with borderline personality disorder may feel periodsof great emptiness and engage in suicidal or self-mutilating behaviors. Boredommay be intolerable to someone with this disorder, and consequently, he or shemay perpetually seek stimulation. Childhood abuse or neglect or the early lossof a parent may be found in family histories of people with this disorder.The biological underpinnings of borderline personality disorder are complex.People with borderline personalities may have a combination of prefrontal lobeproblems, which accounts for impulsivity, conflict, and stimulation-seekingbehaviors, and the tendency to intensely value or devalue individuals. Anteriorcingulate problems may also exist, evidenced by the obsessive thinking,cognitive inflexibility, and a very strong tendency to hold onto grudges andpast hurts. As well, there may be temporal lobe abnormalities. The left temporallobe is involved with aggressive behaviors toward the self and others.Consistency and control over impulsivity are necessary to developing andsticking to character goals. When you are controlled by your emotions,constantly reacting to outside events in the heat of the moment, you cannotdevelop an overall sense of who you are, what you want, and how you will get it.Contemplation is important to developing a sense of right and wrong, what isgood and bad for you and for others. Likewise, being enslaved by impulses andreactions denies you the opportunity to build a strong sense of self-esteem.When you can control what you do, you can feel greater certainty about youridentity. It’s rewarding to be able to clarify your personal values and to stickto them, to know that you and you alone are in charge of your life.It’s hard to build a sense of security and of being loved when you find yourselfattaching unrealistic expectations to people to whom you’re attracted and thenending friendships before they’ve had a chance to develop. Social connectednesstakes work: It implies forgiving and flexibility. It’s important for all of usto try to develop greater empathy for others by asking ourselves about another’spoint of view and not to automatically assume we know what others feel andthink.When Is It Time to See a Professional About My Brain?This question is relatively easy to answer. People should seek professional helpfor themselves or a family member when their behaviors, feelings, thoughts, ormemory (all brain functions) interfere with their ability to reach theirpotential in their relationships or work. If you are experiencing persistentrelationship struggles (parent-child, sibling, friend, partner), it’s time toget help. If you have ongoing work problems related to your memory, moods,actions, or thoughts, it is time to get professional help. If your impulsivebehavior, poor choices, or anxiety are causing consistent monetary problems,it’s time to get help. Many people think they cannot afford to get professionalhelp. I think it is usually much more costly to live with brain problems than itis to get appropriate help.Pride and denial can get in the way of seeking proper help. People want to bestrong and rely on themselves, but I am constantly reminded of the strength ittakes to make the decision to get help. Also, getting help should be looked atas a way to get your brain operating at its full capacity.Angela came to see me for temper problems. Even though she was very competent atwork, her behavior at home often caused problems with her husband. When herhusband suggested she see me, she resisted. There was nothing wrong with her,she thought, it was everyone else. One day, after exploding at one of herchildren, she realized it was, at least partly, her fault and agreed to come forhelp. She resisted because she did not want to be seen as weak or defective. Thebrain-SPECT scan helped her to see that her brain needed to be balanced. Withthe appropriate help, she got better and didn’t have to suffer from mood swings,and she and her family suffered less stress as a result of her better-balancedbrain.What to Do When a Loved One Is in Denial About Needing HelpUnfortunately, the stigma associated with a “mental illness” prevents manypeople from getting help. People do not want to be seen as crazy, stupid, ordefective and do not seek help until they (or their loved one) can no longertolerate the pain (at work, in their relationships, or within themselves). Mostpeople do not see psychiatric problems as brain problems, but rather as weakcharacter problems. Men are especially affected by denial.Many men, when faced with obvious troubles in their marriages, their children,or even themselves, are often unable to really see problems. Their lack ofawareness and strong tendency toward denial prevent them from seeking help untilmore damage than necessary has been done. Many men have to be threatened withdivorce before they seek help. Some people may say it is unfair to pick on men.And, indeed, some men see problems long before some women. Overall, however,mothers see problems in children before fathers and are more willing to seekhelp, and many more wives call for marital counseling than do husbands. What isit in our society that causes men to overlook obvious problems, or to denyproblems until it is too late to deal with them effectively or until more damagewas done than necessary? Some of the answers may be found in how boys are raisedin our society, the societal expectations we place on men, the overwhelming paceof many men’s daily lives, and in the brain.Boys most often engage in active play (sports, war games, video games, etc.)that involves little dialogue or discussion. The games often involve dominanceand submissiveness, winning and losing, and little interpersonal communication.Force, strength, or skill handles problems. Girls, on the other hand, oftenengage in more interpersonal or communicative types of play, such as dolls andstorytelling. Fathers often take their sons to throw the ball around or shoothoops, rather than to go for a walk and talk.Many men retain the childhood notions of competition and the idea that one mustbe better than others to be any good at all. To admit to a problem is to be lessthan other men. As a result, many men wait to seek help until their problem hasbecome obvious to the whole world. Other men feel responsible for all thathappens in their families, so admitting to a problem is the same as admittingthat they have in some way failed.Clearly, the pace of life prevents many people and particularly men from takingthe time to look clearly at the important people in their lives and theirrelationships with them. When we spend time with fathers and husbands and helpthem slow down enough to see what is really important to them, more often thannot they begin to see the problems and work toward helpful solutions. The issueis generally not one of being uncaring or uninterested; it is not seeing what isthere. Men are wired differently than women. Men tend to be more left brained,which gives them better access to logical, detail-oriented thought patterns.Women tend to have greater access to both sides of their brains, with the rightside being involved in understanding the gestalt or big picture of a situation.The right side of the brain also seems to be involved in being able to admit toa problem. Many men just don’t see the problems associated with anxiety ordepression even though the symptoms may be very clear to others.Here are several suggestions to help people who are unaware of or unwilling toget the help they need. Try the straightforward approach first (but with a newbrain twist). Clearly tell the person what behaviors concern you, and explainthat the problems may be due to underlying brain patterns that can be easilytuned up. Tell them help may be available—not help to cure a defect but ratherhelp to optimize how their brain functions. Tell them you know they are tryingto do their best, but their behavior, thoughts, or feelings may be getting inthe way of their success (at work, in relationships, or within themselves).Emphasize better function, not defect.Give them information. Books, videos, and articles on the subjects you areconcerned about can be of tremendous help. Many people come to see us due to abook, video, or article. Good information can be very persuasive, especially ifit is presented in a positive, life-enhancing way.When a person remains resistant to help, even after you have beenstraightforward and given them good information, plant seeds. Plant ideas aboutgetting help and then water them regularly. Drop an idea, article, or otherinformation about the topic from time to time. If you talk too much aboutgetting help, people become resentful and stubbornly won’t get help, especiallythe overfocused types. Be careful not to go overboard.Protect your relationship with the other person. People are more receptive topeople they trust than to people who nag and belittle them. Work on gaining theperson’s trust over the long run. It will make them more receptive to yoursuggestions. Do not make getting help the only thing that you talk about. Makesure you are interested in their whole lives, not just their potential medicalappointments.Give them new hope. Many people with these problems have tried to get help andit did not work or it made them even worse. Educate them on new brain technologythat helps professionals be more focused and more effective in treatmentefforts.There comes a time when you have to say enough is enough. If, over time, theother person refuses to get help, and his or her behavior has a negative impacton your life, you may have to separate yourself. Staying in a toxic relationshipis harmful to your health, and it often enables the other person to remain sickas well. Actually, I have seen that the threat or act of leaving motivatespeople to change, whether it is about drinking, drug use, or treating ADD.Threatening to leave is not the first approach I would take, but after time itmay be the best approach. Realize you cannot force a person into treatmentunless they are dangerous to themselves, dangerous to others, or unable to carefor themselves. You can only do what you can do. Fortunately, there is a lotmore we can do today than even ten years ago.Finding a Competent Professional Who Uses This New Brain Science ThinkingThe Amen Clinics get many calls, faxes, and e-mails each week from people allover the world looking for competent professionals who think in similar ways tothe principles outlined in this book. Because this approach is on the edge ofwhat is new in brain science, other professionals who know and practice thisinformation may be hard to find. However, finding the right professional forevaluation and treatment is critical to the healing process. The rightprofessional can have a very positive impact on your life. The wrongprofessional can make things worse.There are a number of steps to take in finding the best person to assist you.The right help is not only cost effective but saves unnecessary pain andsuffering, so don’t rely on a person simply because they are on your managedcare plan. That person may or may not be a good fit for you. Search for thebest. If he or she is on your insurance plan, great, but don’t let that be theprimary criteria. Once you get the names of competent professionals, check theircredentials. Very few patients ever check a professional’s background. Boardcertification is a positive credential. To become board certified, physiciansmust pass additional written and verbal tests. They have had to disciplinethemselves to gain the skill and knowledge that was acceptable to theircolleagues. Don’t give too much weight to the medical school or graduate schoolthe professional attended. I have worked with some doctors who went to Yale andHarvard who did not have a clue on how to appropriately treat patients, whileother doctors from less prestigious schools were outstanding, forward thinking,and caring. Set up an interview with the professional to see whether or not youwant to work with him or her. Generally you have to pay for their time, but itis worth spending the money to get to know the people you will rely on for help.Many professionals write articles or books or speak at meetings or local groups.Read the work of or hear the professional speak, if possible. By doing so, youmay be able to get a feel for the person and his or her ability to help you.Look for a person who is open-minded, up-to-date, and willing to try new things.Look for a person who treats you with respect, who listens to your questions,and responds to your needs. Look for a relationship that is collaborative andrespectful. I know it is hard to find a professional who meets all of thesecriteria who also has the right training in brain physiology, but these peoplecan be found. Be persistent. The caregiver is essential to healing.Do not let pride get in the way of getting the help you need. In order to make agood brain great, you have to admit when you need help.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lesson #11: Fix the issues that get in the way of great sex.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_021_r1.jpg]A HEALTHIER BRAIN EQUALS A SEXIER YOUimage [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_005_r1.jpg]Strategies to Improve Your Brain and LifeYou know you’ve got to exercise your brain just like your muscles.—WILL ROGERSI am a sucker for a beautiful brain. Usually one needs to be attractedphysically to a potential romantic partner, but my brain-imaging work has taughtme that it is also a good idea to be attracted to the appearance of a person’sphysical brain as well. Ugly brains usually make for ugly relationships. “Beautyand brains” is more than just a cliché. In 2001, CNN International aired a storyon my imaging work. News anchor Marina Kolbe spent several days in our clinicwatching us work and filming the imaging process; she was even scanned herselfas part of our healthy-brain study. Besides being a smart, attractive woman, shealso had one of the prettiest brains I had ever seen. Now, to a neuroscientist,that is ever so sexy. She and I have been friends ever since. Her behavior isconsistent with her lovely brain. Beauty is much more than skin deep.Roseanne has been a friend of mine for many years. She is an attractive woman,but not attractive to me. I saw her as anxious, worried, and fretful. One dayher doctor put her on the antidepressant Zoloft to calm her anxiety. Severalweeks later I found myself being more interested in her. Something about her wasdifferent. Even though she looked the same, she was more appealing. She had anair of confidence that had been missing before the medication. Her smile wasbrighter and she seemed to have a more genuinely positive internal state. Hereyes had a new, more intense sparkle. Her brain was more relaxed, one of theeffects of Zoloft. A healthier brain is associated with a healthier, sexier you.Since your brain is involved in everything you do, including everything sexual,it follows that a healthy brain is more likely to be associated with moreeffective behavior, at work, at home, and even in the bedroom. A healthy brainwill give you more consistently loving behavior, help you read social cues, andallow you to be a better lover. As in Roseanne’s case, it can even increase yoursex appeal. Working to keep your brain healthy increases your chances for lovingrelationships and great sex.In my work I have seen many things that hurt how the brain functions, ruiningyour chances for love; and many things that help brain function, improving yourchances for love. In this chapter I will explore behaviors that make your brainlook old, ugly, shriveled, and damaged as well as those things that enhance andbeautify the brain. Once you know what helps and hurts the brain, you will havea clearer choice on how healthy you want your brain to be, and subsequently howeffective you will be.Hurtful Brain BehaviorsBrain TraumaOne of the most important lessons I have learned from looking at 35,000 scansthese last sixteen years is that mild traumatic brain injuries change people’swhole lives and virtually nobody knows about it. Virtually no marital counseloron the planet thinks about evaluating brain trauma as part of why peoplestruggle in their relationships. Even what many professionals would considermild trauma can be harmful. The brain is the consistency of soft butter or tofu,somewhere between egg whites and Jell-O. It is housed in a really hard skullthat has many ridges.I recently scanned a nineteen-year-old man who had a skate-boarding accidentwhich caused him to be unconscious for about half an hour. Most physicians wouldconsider that a mild traumatic brain injury. Yet on his scan it literally wipedout 25 percent of the front part of his brain; so the part of his brain that isinvolved with judgment, forethought, impulse control, organization, and planningis dead, from what professionals consider a minor brain injury. Protecting thebrains of our children, our loved ones, and ourselves should be a top prioritybecause brain damage affects us in a very serious way. A high percentage ofpeople in prison have had brain injuries. There is a higher incident of childrenwho struggle in school after a brain injury. There is a higher incident ofdepression and substance abuse after brain injuries.I treat a couple in which the woman had a diving accident when she was eighteenyears old, again something that was considered a mild traumatic brain injury asshe was unconscious for only a short period of time. She was dating hersoon-to-be husband at the time, and he noticed a big change in her behavior overthe next six months. She went from being loving, attentive, sweet, consistent,and reliable to someone who was more emotional, depressed, disorganized, andtemperamental. He felt committed to her and hoped she would change back to theperson she used to be. Unfortunately, she struggled with her mood and her temperfor thirty years, until she came to see me. When I scanned her, she was missingthe function of about 30 percent of her left prefrontal cortex, which is thehappy side of the brain. The left side of the brain has been reported byresearchers to be the happy side, while the right side is associated with moreanxiety and negativity. When you hurt the happy side of the brain, the moreanxious, negative right side has more dominance in your life. This injuryseriously affected this couple’s happiness.I have discovered that you have to ask people five to ten times whether or notthey have had brain trauma. People just forget, even serious injuries. I have afriend who has financial problems that have affected his marriage. His abilityto have sex suffers due to his financial problems. His wife is anxious aboutmoney and she feels insecure about their future. He is an amazing, sweet man,but struggles to make good financial decisions. Before I scanned him, I askedhim seven or eight times whether or not he had had a head injury, which iscommon in people who struggle with finances. He said no, no, no, no, no, no.When I scanned him, I saw a large dent in the function of the front part of hisbrain. The only thing that I could figure is that he had a head injury that heforgot. So I asked him again and he said no. I asked him again and was veryspecific, “Have you ever been in a car accident?”“No,” he said.And then, and it always happens this way, his faced changed, he got this “Aha”look on his face, and said, “I am so sorry. I lied to you. When I was fifteenyears old I was in the front passenger seat of a car when we got in a head-oncollision. I wasn’t wearing my seat belt and my head broke the windshield. Ilost my eyesight for four days. I can’t believe I forgot that incident.” He hurta significant portion of the judgment center in his brain. He’s still awonderful, sweet, loving man, but when it comes to money, he would make baddecisions that increased his wife’s anxiety and decreased her libido.Having a head injury can really ruin your chances for great sex. Protect yourbrain. I work with many couples who have experienced domestic violence. Theincidence of head injuries in violent individuals is rampant and very few peopleknow it. If you have serious problems with your temper and the police come toyour house, the first thing the courts and mental health professionals recommendis anger-management classes. If a head injury is part of the cause of thetrouble, anger-management classes are like trying software programs to fixhardware problems. Not very effective.I once treated a man from Normal, Illinois, who was referred to me by hispsychologist after I gave a lecture at the university there. What a fun visitfor this California boy. I went to the Normal grocery store, was interviewed onthe Normal radio station, and even had the opportunity to meet Normal women—notmany normal women in California . . . . The patient had been arrested for felonydomestic violence. He had broken his wife’s arm. When I met this man, he trulyhated himself. He hated his temper and his inability to control the rage he feltinside. He was suicidal at our first visit. His SPECT scan showed a dent in theleft-front side of his brain and he had very poor function in the part of hisbrain called the left temporal lobe, an area that we have associated withviolence. I had already asked him six times if he had had a head injury, towhich he replied no, but when I had evidence on the scan of a head injury andasked if he had ever fallen out of a tree, fallen off a fence, or dived into ashallow pool, an “Aha” look came over his face and he said, “When I was sixyears old I was standing on top of the railing on our porch, it was raining, andI slipped and fell six feet head first into a pile of bricks. My parents told meI was only unconscious for a little bit. Do you think that could cause thisproblem?” I said it could and asked when the temper problems began. He said hehad always had them. I then asked him to ask his mom if he had them before hewas in kindergarten. It turned out that his temper problems started when he wasin first grade. He had problems nearly his whole life, probably secondary to abrain injury nobody knew about. He and his wife had been to multiplerelationship counselors with no benefit. If you never look at the brain, you maymiss very important pieces of information. The combination of the rightmedication changed his life. The other interesting thing is that it changed hiswife’s life as well because rather than seeing him as a bad person, she saw himas somebody who was sick, that potentially with the right treatment could getmuch better.Emotional TraumaIn a similar way, emotional trauma can change the brain negatively and make itharder for you to get the love that you want. Whenever people have beenphysically, emotionally, or sexually abused, brain changes take place. Being ina fire, car accident, earthquake, or flood can also change the brain. In ourimaging work we have seen specific scan patterns associated with emotionaltrauma. The limbic or emotional centers of the brain tend to become overactive,making people vulnerable to obsessions, anxiety, and depression, all things thatinterfere with our ability to connect with others in a loving way. It has beenwell documented that adverse childhood events affect people throughout theirlife. These experiences disrupt the child’s ability to form secure attachmentsto their parents. This may lead to their inability to form secure attachmentslater in life. These people have multiple partners and are promiscuous in theirsexuality.As with brain injuries, many people forget they have had emotional trauma. Whenwe see the scan pattern associated with trauma, we ask about it multiple times.I have been surprised many times by people who said they never had trauma, laterto remember being sexually molested, in a fire, robbed at knife point, raped, oreven attacked by animals.One of our patients, who saw a colleague of mine at the clinic, had the scanpattern of emotional trauma. She initially denied any past trauma. When givenmore specific examples, such as being in a fire, robbed, or raped, she said no,no, no. Then after a long hesitation she said that there was this one time whenshe was ten years old and went to a friend’s house in the high desert ofCalifornia. Her friend’s father was an actor who collected unusual animals. Theyhad a lion at home and the day she was at her friend’s house, the lion got looseand chased her, pinned her, and actually had her head in his mouth before theygot him off of her.Emotional trauma can impact the brain and wreak havoc in your love life. Gettingthe emotional trauma treated can actually rebalance the brain and improve yourchances for love. Many researchers have seen that early abuse survivors haveoverlapping psychiatric disorders. Therefore, they may suffer from majordepressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Emotionaltrauma, like abuse or exposure to domestic violence, at early ages has beenstudied extensively and has shown that negative behaviors have resulted later inlife. Depression, suicide, and drug abuse in later life are often associatedwith trauma early in life.Drug and Alcohol AbuseDrugs and alcohol clearly damage the brain. They prematurely age and loweroverall function in the brain. Alcohol is toxic to the brain if you drink morethan a couple of drinks a week. A study from Johns Hopkins University reportedthat people who drink every day have smaller brains. When it comes to the brain,size really does matter. Alcohol kills cells in the cerebellum, the back bottompart of the brain that is involved with coordination, learning, and orgasmicpleasure.Many people drink and use drugs as a way to medicate negative feelings. If youhave experienced emotional trauma, you are more likely to drink. In fact, up to30 percent of people with alcohol abuse or drug abuse have emotional trauma intheir backgrounds. As many as 60 percent of women who are substance abusers haveposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is associated with nightmares,flashbacks, emotional numbing, anxiety, insomnia. When they stop their drug oralcohol abuse, their PTSD often gets worse. People also medicate social anxietywith marijuana, painkillers, or alcohol. They feel better in social situations,less inhibited. The problem with using substances for self-medication is thatthey actually damage brain function and subsequently damage the parts of thebrain involved in forethought, judgment, impulse control, organization, andplanning—all things important for healthy sexual behavior.I once saw a woman from Maine who had problems with obsession and anxiety. Herhusband came along and got scanned, in his mind, just to support his wife. Ilooked at her brain and saw the trouble we expected and prescribed a course oftreatment. When I looked at his fifty-six-year-old brain, his brain looked likehe was eighty. I asked him what he was doing to hurt his brain.“Nothing, Dr. Amen,” he said.I said, “Really? How much do you drink?”“Oh, not very much,” he replied.“What’s not very much?”“Oh, maybe I have three or four drinks a day.”“Every day?” I said.“Yeah, every day. But it’s never a problem. I never get drunk. I have nevergotten into trouble with it,” he said with anxiety.I said, “Why do you drink every day?”“Since my son went off to college, I have this empty-nest thing going on. I justget great enjoyment out of going to the bar, seeing my friends. It’s a socialtime, kind of like the show Cheers.”I said, “Well, you are poisoning yourself. You’re fifty-six and you’re brainlooks like it’s eighty. If you keep this up, pretty soon a lot of your brain isgoing to be dead.”It shocked him that his brain looked as bad as it did. Then he developed thisconcept I call brain envy. After learning about the brain, he wanted a betterone. I helped him develop a brain-healthy plan that included abstinence fromalcohol, regular exercise, mental exercise, vitamins, and fish oil. Four monthslater he wrote me back saying that he mentally felt like he was twenty. Hisenergy and memory were better, he felt smarter, more articulate. His work as awriter had also improved.Lisa, forty-two, drank three to four glasses of wine nearly every day. Sherarely got drunk, but felt uncomfortable when she didn’t drink. Her husbandnoticed over the past few years that she was not herself. She was more forgetfuland more irritable. She started to have high blood pressure and was much lesssexual and less sexually responsive. I saw her out of concern for her memoryproblems. Her SPECT scan showed overall decreased activity. She had a toxicbrain. The alcohol was damaging her brain, affecting her memory and moods, andeven her sexuality. High blood pressure is a common side effect of too muchalcohol. With high blood pressure, blood flow to vital organs, such as the brainand genitals, is impaired, so there will be trouble having an orgasm and troublethinking, a bad combination.Sometimes small amounts of alcohol can calm anxiety and help people be morereceptive to social and sexual interactions. Small amounts of alcohol have beenfound useful for a number of issues, including heart health. But small amountsmean one or two glasses a week, not a day as most people think. A little bit ofalcohol is not my concern in this section.My favorite definition of an alcoholic or drug addict is anyone who has gotteninto trouble (legal, relational, or work related) while drinking or using drugs,then continues to use them. They did not learn from the previous experience. Arational person would realize that he or she has trouble handling the alcohol ordrugs and stay away from them. Unfortunately, many people with these problemshave to experience repeated failures because of the substance use, and thus hit“rock bottom” before treatment is sought.In treating substance abuse, it is important to recognize and treat anyunderlying cause of the problem, such as unrecognized depression, bipolardisorder, anxiety disorders, or ADD. New medications have been developed thathave been found helpful in alleviating withdrawal symptoms and decreasingcravings for the substances. Psychotherapy and support groups are often helpful.Drugs and alcohol are a nightmare for brain function.Toxic ExposureToxic exposure hurts the brain. Many substances have the potential to be braintoxic and most people have no clue. Many medications, much caffeine, nicotine,and environmental toxins, such as pesticides, paint fumes, hair-coloringchemicals, and nail polish, can hurt your brain. Understanding the sources ofbrain poisons can help you avoid them.Many medications are brain toxic. From a psychiatric standpoint, I was taught touse a class of antianxiety medications called benzodiazepines, such as Xanax,Ativan, and Valium, to treat patients with intense feelings of anxiety andpanic. As soon as I started performing SPECT studies, I saw that thesemedications were often toxic to brain function. Scan after scan on thesemedications showed an overall diminished or dehydrated pattern of activity, justas there is with drug abuse. It didn’t take long for me to stop using thesemedications and look for other ways to heal anxiety and panic. In much the sameway, painkillers often showed brain toxicity on scans: Vicodin, Darvon,Percodan, OxyContin, and others caused overall decreased brain activity. Nowonder they help pain, they make people feel numb all over. Of course, thisdoesn’t mean that these medications are never indicated. Many people wouldrather die than live with chronic pain. It does mean, however, that we shouldlook for alternatives to painkillers for chronic pain that also numb the brain.Nicotine prematurely ages the brain. Nicotine, found in cigarettes, cigars,chewing tobacco, and nicotine patches, tablets, and gum, causes blood vessels tolessen blood flow to vital organs. We know smokers have more problems withimpotence; it is bad to have low blood flow to sexual organs. Nicotineconstricts blood flow to the skin, making smokers look prematurely older thanthey are. Nicotine also constricts blood flow to the brain, eventually causingoverall lowered activity and depriving the brain of the nutrients it needs.High amounts of caffeine can also be trouble. Caffeine constricts blood flow tothe brain and many other organs. A little caffeine a day is not a problem, butmore than a cup or two can be trouble. Caffeine does three bad things to thebrain. First, brain-imaging studies have shown that caffeine constricts bloodflow to the brain. Since blood is critical in bringing nutrients to cells andtaking away toxic waste products, anything that diminishes blood flow to anorgan causes premature aging. Second, caffeine blocks a chemical calledadenosine and fools us into believing we need less sleep. Less sleep also causesoverall lower blood flow to the brain. In addition, caffeine is a diuretic. Thebrain is 80 percent water. Anything that dehydrates you has a negative impact onbrain function. As little caffeine as possible is a good rule if you want torespect and nurture your brain.Sleep DeprivationSleep deprivation hurts the brain. People who get less than seven hours of sleepa night have lower activity in the temporal lobes of the brain, the part of thebrain involved in learning and memory. Shift workers, those suffering from jetlag, teens who have their sleep schedules off-kilter from school schedules, andthose suffering from sleep apnea are all at risk for poorer brain function.Those who are sleep deprived score poorer on memory and math tests, have lowergrades in school, and are at much greater risks for driving accidents. Sleepdeprivation is also associated with depression and attention deficit disorders.Recently, sleep apnea (snoring loudly, holding breath when sleeping, andtiredness during the day) has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease. This is due tothe direct effect of a lack of oxygen damaging the brain. Work to sleep at leastseven to eight hours a night. Practice good sleep habits, such as avoiding muchcaffeine or nicotine; staying away from alcohol as a sleep aide, as it will wearoff and cause you to wake up in the middle of the night; and avoiding exercisebefore bed; and learn relaxation techniques to calm your mind.Helping your partner get enough sleep is an effective form of foreplay. Helpingwith the children, work, house chores, or other things that interfere with sleepis likely to help your partner sleep better and be more available to you.Untreated Mental IllnessesAs in the case of Roseanne earlier in the chapter, being plagued withdepression, anxiety, distractibility, impulsivity, mood swings, or obsessions isnot very sexy. Having an untreated psychiatric problem can ruin your chances forgreat love. Many people never seek help for their mental or emotional problemsbecause they do not recognize them or think they can control them. All aspectsof sexuality may be affected by the distress of mental illness. In both men andwomen, people who were depressed had half the sexual arousal than their normalcounterparts did. Mental illness is very common, almost the norm. According tothe U.S. Epidemiological Catchment Area Study, 49 percent of the U.S. populationwill experience a mental illness at some point in their lives, with anxiety,depression, attention deficit disorders, and substance abuse being the mostcommon. If you suffer from emotional or behavior problems, get the help.Poor DietsThe increase in fast-food diets and poor nutrition is directly responsible forthe rise in mental illness over the past fifty years. Studies have linkedattention deficit disorder, depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and schizophreniato junk food and the absence of essential fats, vitamins, and minerals inindustrialized diets. These illnesses have a direct impact on sexual andrelationship health. Rates of depression have been shown to be higher incountries with low intakes of fish, for example. Lack of folic acid, omega-3fatty acids, selenium, and the amino acid tryptophan are thought to play animportant role in the illness. Deficiencies of essential fats and antioxidantvitamins are also thought to be a contributory factor in schizophrenia.Helpful Brain BehaviorsProtect Your BrainProtecting the brain from injury is the first step to optimizing its function.Your brain is the consistency of tofu and it is housed in a really hard skull.Wear a seat belt in a car and always wear a helmet when you ride a bicycle,motorcycle, or go snowboarding.Limit Brain ToxinsAs mentioned above, current research has shown that many chemicals are toxic tobrain function. Alcohol, drugs of abuse, nicotine, much caffeine, and manymedications decrease blood flow to the brain. When blood flow is decreased, thebrain cannot work efficiently. Avoid these toxic substances.Get Enough SleepSleep deprivation decreases brain activity and limits access to learning,memory, and concentration. A recent brain-imaging study showed that people whoconsistently slept less than seven hours had overall less brain activity.Getting enough sleep is essential to brain function.Counteract StressScientists have only recently discovered how stress negatively affects brainfunction. Stress hormones have been shown in animals to be directly toxic tomemory centers. Brain cells can die with prolonged stress. Managing stresseffectively through meditation, relaxation, and exercise is essential to goodbrain function.Eat Right to Think RightThe fuel you feed the brain has a profound effect on how it functions. Leanprotein, complex carbohydrates, and foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids (largecold-water fish, such as tuna and salmon, walnuts, Brazil nuts, olive oil, andcanola oil) are essential to brain function. Research has shown that fishconsumption is associated with the prevention of cognitive decline as peopleage. Daily multiple vitamins. With our poor diet, many Americans are overweight butnutrient poor. The American Medical Association recommends we all take a 100percent multiple vitamin everyday. Your brain needs it. Daily high-quality fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential to brain health.Low levels of this nutrient have been associated with depression, ADD, dementia,and even suicide. Fish oil has been found to be helpful for hearts, joints,skin, and brain. Take 1,000 to 2,000 milligrams a day.Kill the ANTs That Invade Your BrainThe quality of your thoughts also impacts brain function. Happy, hopeful,positive thoughts are associated with improved brain function, while negativity(I call these bad thoughts ANTs, automatic negative thoughts) turns off certaincerebral centers. Positive thinking is not just good for you, it helps make yourbrain work better. List five things you are grateful for today.Work Your BrainYour brain is like a muscle. The more you use it, the more you can use it. Everytime you learn something new, your brain makes a new connection. Learningenhances blood flow and activity in the brain. If you go for long periodswithout learning something new, you start to lose some of the connections in thebrain and you begin to struggle more with memory and learning. Strive to learnsomething new every day, even if it is just for a short period of time.Exercise for Your BrainPeople who physically exercise on a regular basis have better memories with age,they have better blood flow to the brain, and many cerebral processes areenhanced. The best kind of exercise improves the pump force of your heart(cardiovascular exercise).It has been known for many years that sex was good exercise, but until nownobody had made a scientific study of the caloric content of different sexualactivities. An anonymous source on the Internet listed, tongue in cheek, thefollowing results.REMOVING HER CLOTHESWith her consent12 caloriesWithout her consent2,187 caloriesOPENING HER BRAWith both hands8 caloriesWith one hand12 caloriesWith your teeth485 caloriesPUTTING ON A CONDOMWith an erection6 caloriesWithout an erection3,315 caloriesPOSITIONSMissionary12 calories69 lying down78 calories69 standing up812 caloriesWheelbarrow216 caloriesDoggy style326 caloriesItalian chandelier2,912 caloriesORGASMSReal112 caloriesFake1,315 caloriesPOSTORGASMLying in bed hugging18 caloriesGetting up immediately36 caloriesExplaining why you got out of bed immediately816 caloriesGETTING A SECOND ERECTION IF YOU ARE . . .20–29 years36 calories30–39 years80 calories40–49 years124 calories50–59 years1,972 calories60–69 years7,916 calories70 and overResults are still pendingDRESSING AFTERWARDCalmly32 caloriesIn a hurry98 caloriesWith her father knocking at the door5,218 caloriesWith your wife knocking at the door13,521 calories Results may vary! Develop a “concert state” for your brainOptimal performance is best achieved when a “concert state” exists in the brain.By “concert state” I mean “a relaxed body with a sharp, clear mind,” much as youwould experience at an exhilarating symphony. Achieving this state requires theability to relax and focus. Ten minutes of slow, deep breathing is usuallyenough to develop this state.Coordinate Your BrainRecently, it was learned that the cerebellum, a structure at the back, bottompart of the brain, is involved not only with physical coordination but also withprocessing speed and thought coordination, or how quickly you can integrate newthoughts. Doing coordination exercises helps the brain overall work smarter andfaster. One exercise shown in scientific studies to help is juggling. People wholearned how to juggle three balls for a minute straight enhanced brain function.Make Love for Your BrainAs discussed in Lesson Two, making love on a regular basis improved mood,memory, and overall health. One study showed that it decreased the risk of heartattack and stroke by 50 percent. Hold the medicine, give me love.Do Not Let E-mail Control Your LifeA recent study showed that constantly checking e-mails and phone messagesactually lowered IQ by ten points, more than double the loss in IQ of cannabisusers. E-mail can be addictive, as one is always waiting for the next goode-mail to hit, like waiting for the next blackjack in the card game twenty-one.The anticipation of something good keeps us checking something routine. It alsodistracts us from staying focused on the person or task at hand. Limit your timeon e-mail.Treat Brain Problems EarlyIf you have learning, mood, behavior, or memory problems, get an evaluation. Thebrain is an organ just like your heart or kidneys. When there are signs oftrouble, work on getting it fixed. Use these strategies to have the best brain possible. A better brain improveseverything else in your life, including your sex life.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lesson #12: Caring for your brain increases your chances for great sex.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Amen_9780307381507_epub_022_r1.jpg]The Amen Clinic Brain System QuestionnairePlease rate yourself on each of the symptoms listed below using the followingscale.

Why are psychiatrists the only physicians who rarely lookat the organ they treat?It is time to change. Amen Clinics, Inc. (ACI) has provided leadership andunderstanding on the clinical use of brain imaging in psychiatry. Since 1991,ACI has built the world’s largest database of brain scans related to emotional,learning, and behavioral problems. The study we do is called brain-SPECTimaging. SPECT stands for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography. It is anuclear medicine procedure widely used in medicine to study heart, liver,thyroid, bone, and brain problems. Brain-SPECT imaging is a proven, reliablemeasure of cerebral blood flow. Because brain activity is directly related toblood flow, SPECT effectively shows us the patterns of activity in the brain.1[Amen_9780307381507_epub_ftn_r1.htm#footnote001] SPECT allows physicians to lookdeep inside the brain to observe three things: areas of the brain that workwell, areas of the brain that work too hard, and areas of the brain that do notwork hard enough. ACI has performed more than 35,000 scans on patients from age10 months to 101 years, and has also scanned many normal, “healthy brain”individuals as well.The procedure guidelines of the Society of Nuclear Medicine lists the evaluationof suspected brain trauma, evaluation of patients with suspected dementia,presurgical location of seizures, and the detection and evaluation of cerebralvascular disease as common indications for brain SPECT.2[Amen_9780307381507_epub_ftn_r1.htm#footnote002] The guidelines also say thatmany additional indications appear promising. At ACI, because of our experience,we have added the indications of evaluating violence, substance abuse, thesubtypes of ADD, anxiety, and depression, and complex or resistant psychiatricproblems for brain SPECT.An important question for today’s mental health clinicians is “When and whywould I order a SPECT study for my patients or get one for myself or a lovedone?” My purpose in this section is to answer this question and to point outsome of the benefits and caveats for using this powerful tool. A SPECT scan canprovide distinct benefits to clinicians, and to the patient and his/her family.(There are also some things that should not be expected from a SPECT scan,listed later.)Benefits for Physicians and Clinicians1. A SPECT scan can show:a. Areas of the brain implicated in specific problems, such as the prefrontalcortex with executive function and the medial temporal lobes with long-termmemory storage.b. Unexpected findings that may be contributing to the presenting problem(s),such as toxicity, potential areas of seizure activity, or past brain trauma.c. Potential seizure activity, in many cases more accurately seen by SPECT thanstandard EEG, especially in the areas of the medial temporal lobe. There aremore than forty-one studies with more than 1,300 patients on SPECT and epilepsy(see www.amenclinic.com for references).d. Targeted areas for treatment, such as overactive basal ganglia or anteriorcingulate gyrus (seen on anxiety and OCD spectrum disorders) or an underactivetemporal lobe (seen in seizure disorders and trauma).e. Specific effects of medication on the brain to help guide us in adjustingdosages or augmenting treatment. Often patients report that SSRIs are helpfulbut also cause decreased motivation or memory problems, seen as decreasedprefrontal or temporal lobe activity on SPECT.f. Changes in brain function with treatment, improved or worsened. You canreview many “before and after” scans at www.amenclinic.com.2. The image occurs at the time of injection and outside the imaging camera,which gives SPECT several significant advantages. Most notably, we are able tosedate people after they have been injected so that they can lie still for thescan, often difficult for hyperactive or autistic children or demented adults(motion artifact ruins the scan in all of these imaging techniques).3. A SPECT scan can provide explanations for refractory symptoms and helpclinicians ask better and more targeted questions (e.g., about toxic exposure,brain injuries, anoxia, inflammation, or infections that patients may havedenied or forgotten).4. A SPECT scan can help us to avoid prescribing treatments that make theproblem worse, such as unnecessarily stimulating an already overactive brain orcalming an underactive one.5. A SPECT scan can help to evaluate risk for dementia—the brain starts tochange long before people show symptoms. There is usually a loss of 30 percentof hippocampal tissue before symptoms occur. Using autopsy data in fifty-fourpatients, Bonte reported that brain SPECT had a positive predictive value forAlzheimer’s disease of 92 percent.3[Amen_9780307381507_epub_ftn_r1.htm#footnote003]6. A SPECT scan can also help to differentiate between types of dementia. Earlyin the disease, Alzheimer’s disease, frontal temporal lobe dementia, Lewy bodydementia, and multiinfarct dementia each have their own patterns. There are morethan eighty-three studies with more than 4,500 patients on this subject (seewww.amenclinic.com for references).7. A SPECT scan helps clinicians understand the rationale for using certainmedications (such as anticonvulsants to stabilize temporal lobe function or tocalm focal areas of marked hyperactivity, or stimulants to enhance decreasedprefrontal perfusion, or SSRIs to calm basal ganglia and anterior cingulatehyperactivity).8. A SPECT scan can identify specific areas of the brain affected by trauma,better target treatment, and help deal with insurance, legal, and rehabilitationissues. There are more than thirty-eight studies with more than 1,300 patientson brain trauma (see www.amenclinic.com for references).9. A SPECT scan can often identify factors contributing to relapse in recoveringsubstance abusers, eating disordered, or sexual addicts. For example, thepatient may have suffered an injury to the prefrontal cortex or temporal lobesor have overactivity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, basal ganglia, limbicsystem, or prefrontal cortex, each of which could indicate comorbid disordersrequiring treatment.10. A SPECT scan can often identify a specific cause or reason that contributesto recovering alcoholics, drug addicts, eating disordered, or sexual addictsrelapse behavior in their recovery from an addictive process. For example, thepatient may have suffered an injury in the prefrontal cortex or temporal lobesor have overactivity in anterior cingulate gyrus, basal ganglia, limbic system,or prefrontal cortex, each of which could contribute to the relapsing behaviors.11. A SPECT scan is also useful to determine if further adjustment of medicationis needed. Scans of patients on medication will reveal areas of the brain stilloveractive or underactive.Benefits of SPECT-Brain Imaging for Patients and Their Families1. A SPECT scan helps develop a deeper understanding of the problem, resultingin reduced shame, guilt, stigma, and self-loathing. This can promoteself-forgiveness, often the first step in healing. Patients can see that theirproblems are, at least in part, medical and physical.2. A SPECT scan allows patients to see a physical representation of theirproblems that is accurate and reliable, and helps to increasecompliance—pictures are powerful. It can influence a patient’s willingness andability to accept and adhere to the treatment program. They can betterunderstand that not taking medication for anxiety, depression, rage, ADD, etc.is similar to not wearing the “correct” prescription glasses.3. A SPECT scan helps families understand when things, such as permanent braindamage from an injury, will not get better, so that they can better accept thecondition and provide accordingly.4. A SPECT scan shows substance abusers the damage they have done to their ownbrain, thus helping to decrease denial, provide motivation for treatment, andsupport perseverance in sobriety.5. A SPECT scan shows patients how treatments have impacted (improved orworsened) brain function.6. A SPECT scan helps motivate abusive spouses to follow medication protocols byshowing that there is a physical abnormality contributing to their problems.7. A SPECT scan is useful for cancer patients suffering with a “chemotherapytoxic brain.” It gives them insight into their cognitive struggles and alsohelps their doctors see the neurophysiologic and emotional effects of havingcancer and its treatment.8. A SPECT scan can help take modern psychopharmacology from mystery and unknownconsequences to reality and more predictable outcomes.9. A SPECT scan allows patients to understand why specific treatments areindicated, which medications are likely to be most helpful, and what otherinterventions may be indicated.What a SPECT Scan Cannot ProvideDespite the many benefits that might be derived from a SPECT scan, there areclearly some things that it cannot provide. For example, a SPECT scan cannot:1. give a diagnosis in the absence of clinical information2. give the date of a head injury, infection, or toxic exposure3. assess or evaluate IQ4. assess or evaluate the guilt, innocence, motivation, or sanity of a criminaldefendant5. guarantee a perfect diagnosis, or a cure.How SPECT Differs from MRIA SPECT scan is similar to an MRI study in that both can show three-dimensionalimages and “slices” of the brain. However, whereas MRI shows the physicalanatomy of the brain, SPECT shows brain functional activity. That is, SPECTyields images showing where the brain is functioning well, where it is workingtoo hard, and where it is not working hard enough. A newer version of MRI,functional MRI or “fMRI,” is also capable of showing brain activity and is usedextensively in scientific research on brain function. fMRI shows instantaneousneural activity so you can see, for example, how the brain responds to aspecific stimulus event. With SPECT we see brain activity averaged over a fewminutes so it is better at showing the brain doing everyday activities such asconcentrating, meditating, reading, etc. PET, another nuclear-imaging technique,is very similar to SPECT but is a slower and more costly imaging technique.Ensuring High-Quality SPECT ImagesAlthough a SPECT scan is simple from the patient’s perspective, it takesconsiderable skill and experience to dependably generate accurate brain-SPECTimages suitable for psychiatric applications. Equally important is the need fortotal consistency in imaging techniques among patients so that results arequantifiable, repeatable, and consistent.Here are some of the factors that need to be considered in SPECT scans.Variability-of-Technique IssuesProcessing protocols need to be standardized and optimized. Motion can ruin ascan, so it is important that there be no motion on the scan. The professionalsneed to know how to identify and deal with image artifacts and othersophisticated technical issues. Variability of cameras. Multiheaded cameras are clearly superior, as they canscan much faster. It takes an hour to do a scan on a single-headed camera,thirty minutes on a dual-headed camera, and fifteen minutes on a triple-headedcamera. Experience of readers. At the Amen Clinics, we have developed a standardizedreading technique for which we have documented high inter- and intraraterreliability. Image display. Scans must be clear, understandable, easily illustrative of brainfunction, and available to the patient on a timely basis. We believe our 3-Drendering software makes the scans easy for professionals, patients, andfamilies to understand. Drugs. Scans can be affected by a number of substances that need to becontrolled, including medications, street drugs, and caffeine. All of the above issues have been addressed at the Amen Clinics by carefullystandardized procedures for all our SPECT scans.Common ConcernsCONCERN: Low resolution—it is commonly said that a SPECT scan is a “poor man’sPET study.” RESPONSE: With multiheaded cameras, SPECT has the same resolution as PET withconsiderably lower cost, better insurance coverage, greater availability, andfewer image artifacts.4 [Amen_9780307381507_epub_ftn_r1.htm#footnote004] Also,it is an easier procedure to do. SPECT provides more-than-adequate resolutionfor our applications. CONCERN: Radiation exposure, especially in children. RESPONSE: The average radiation exposure for one SPECT scan is 0.7 rem (similarto a nuclear bone scan or brain CAT scan) and is a safe procedure, according tothe guidelines established by the American Academy of Neurology.5[Amen_9780307381507_epub_ftn_r1.htm#footnote005] These other procedures areroutinely ordered for many common medical conditions (i.e., bone fractures orhead trauma), further suggesting that the levels of radiation exposure aregenerally acceptable in medical practice. Ineffective treatment of psychiatricillness has many more risks than the low levels of radiation associated with aSPECT scan. CONCERN: What is normal? RESPONSE: In the SPECT literature over the past twenty years, there have beenmore than forty-three studies looking at “normal” issues in more than 2,450patients, including 150 children from birth on (see www.amenclinic.com forreferences). These do not include the thousands of control subjects used instudies of specific neurological and psychiatric conditions. Chiron et al.reported that at birth, cortical regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was lowerthan those for adults.6 [Amen_9780307381507_epub_ftn_r1.htm#footnote006] Afterbirth, it increased by five or six years of age to values 50 percent to 85percent higher than those for adults, thereafter decreasing to reach adultlevels between fifteen and nineteen years. At the age of three, however,children had the same relative blood-flow patterns as adults. Other commonfindings in normal studies suggest that women have generally higher perfusionthan men and that age, drug abuse, and smoking have a negative effect on rCBF.CONCERN: Some physicians say, “I don’t need a scan for diagnosis; I can tellclinically.” RESPONSE: Often, well-trained physicians can tell clinically. But that is notwhen you order a SPECT scan. You order scans when you are confused, the patienthasn’t responded to your best treatment, or the patient’s situation iscomplicated. CONCERN: Lack of reproducibility. RESPONSE: The paper by Javier Villanueva-Meyer, MD, et al. elegantly answersthis question, showing that there is less than 3 percent variability in SPECTscans over time for the same activity.7[Amen_9780307381507_epub_ftn_r1.htm#footnote007] Our own clinical experience,scanning people sequentially, and sometimes twelve years apart, is that SPECTpatterns are the same unless you do something to change the brain. SPECT is areproducible and reliable method for sequential evaluation.ConclusionAt the Amen Clinics we feel that our experience with more than 35,000 brainSPECT scans over sixteen years guides us in being the best in the world forbrain-SPECT imaging.Common Questions About Brain-SPECT ImagingHere are several common questions and answers about brain-SPECT imaging. Will the SPECT study give me an accurate diagnosis? No. A SPECT study by itselfwill not give a diagnosis. SPECT studies help the clinician understand moreabout the specific function of your brain. Each person’s brain is unique, whichmay lead to unique responses to medicine or therapy. Diagnoses about specificconditions are made through a combination of clinical history, personalinterview, information from families, diagnostic checklists, SPECT studies, andother neuropsychological tests. No study is “a doctor in a box” that can giveaccurate diagnoses on individual patients. Why are SPECT studies ordered? Some of the common reasons include:1. Evaluating memory problems, dementia, and distinguishing between differenttypes of dementia and pseudodementia (depression that looks like dementia)2. Evaluating seizure activity3. Evaluating blood-vessel diseases, such as stroke4. Evaluating the effects of mild, moderate, and severe head trauma5. Suspicion of underlying organic brain condition, such as seizure activitycontributing to behavioral disturbance, prenatal trauma, or exposure to toxins6. Evaluating atypical or unresponsive aggressive behavior7. Determining the extent of brain impairment caused by the drug or alcoholabuse8. Typing anxiety, depression, and attention deficit disorders when clinicalpresentation is not clear9. Evaluating people who are atypical or resistant to treatment.Do I need to be off medication before the study? This question must be answeredindividually between you and your doctor. In general, it is better to be offmedications until they are out of your system, but this is not always practicalor advisable. If the study is done while on medication, let the technician knowso that when the physician reads the study, he will include that information inthe interpretation of the scan. In general, we recommend patients try to be offstimulants at least four days before the first scan and remain off of them untilafter the second scan if one is ordered. It is generally not practical to stopmedications such as Prozac because they last in the body for four to six weeks.Check with your specific doctor for recommendations. What should I do the day of the scan? On the day of the scan, decrease oreliminate your caffeine intake and try to not take cold medication or aspirin(if you do, please write it down on the intake form). Eat as you normally would. Are there any side effects or risks to the study? The study does not involve adye and people do not have allergic reactions to the study. The possibilityexists, although in a very small percentage of patients, of a mild rash, facialredness and edema, fever, and a transient increase in blood pressure. The amountof radiation exposure from one brain SPECT study is approximately the same asone abdominal X-ray. How is the SPECT procedure done? The patient is placed in a quiet room and asmall intravenous (IV) line is started. The patient remains quiet forapproximately ten minutes with his or her eyes open to allow their mental stateto equilibrate to the environment. The imaging agent is then injected throughthe IV. After another short period of time, the patient lays on a table and theSPECT camera rotates around his or her head (the patient does not go into atube). The time on the table is approximately fifteen minutes. If aconcentration study is ordered, the patient returns on another day. Are there alternatives to having a SPECT study? In our opinion, SPECT is themost clinically useful study of brain function. There are other studies, such aselectroencephalograms (EEGs), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies, andfunctional MRIs (fMRI). PET studies and fMRI are considerably more costly andthey are performed mostly in research settings. EEGs, in our opinion, do notprovide enough information about the deep structures of the brain to be ashelpful as SPECT studies. Does insurance cover the cost of SPECT studies? Reimbursement by insurancecompanies varies according to your plan. It is often a good idea to check withthe insurance company ahead of time to see if a SPECT study is a coveredbenefit. Is the use of brain-SPECT imaging accepted in the medical community? Brain-SPECTstudies are widely recognized as an effective tool for evaluating brain functionin seizures, strokes, dementia, and head trauma. There are literally hundreds ofresearch articles on these topics. In our clinic, based on our experience forover a decade, we have developed this technology further to evaluate aggressionand nonresponsive psychiatric conditions. Unfortunately, many physicians do notfully understand the application of SPECT imaging and may tell you that thetechnology is experimental, but more than a thousand physicians and mentalhealth professionals in the United States have referred patients to us forscans."},{"pageContent":"GlossaryAcetylcholine (ACh)—a neurotransmitter involved with memory formation, mostlyexcitatory, that has been implicated in problems with muscles, Alzheimer’sdisease, and learning problems.Amygdala—found on the front, inside aspect of the temporal lobes, part of thelimbic or emotional system of the brain, is involved with tagging emotionalvalences to experiences or events.Anterior cingulate gyrus—runs lengthwise through the frontal lobes, brain’s gearshifter, helping with cognitive flexibility.Antioxidants—help to prevent damage from free radical formation.Axon—usually a long process that projects from the cell body to connect withother cells.Basal ganglia—large structures deep in the brain involved with motor movements,anxiety, and pleasure.Central nervous system (CNS)—composed of the spinal cord and parts of the brain,brain stem, thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex.Deep limbic system—deep structures in the brain that influence emotionalresponsiveness.Dendrites—structures that branch out from the cell body and serve as the mainreceivers of signals from other nerve cells, functioning as the “antennae” ofthe neuron.Dopamine (DA)—a neurotransmitter involved with attention, motor movements, andmotivation, has been implicated in problems with Parkinson’s disease, attentiondeficit disorder, addictions, depression, and schizophrenia.Estrogen—a female hormone of reproduction.fMRI—a brain scan that uses powerful magnets to look at brain blood flow andactivity patterns.Free radicals—oxygen combined with other molecules to generate highly toxicsubstances that must be neutralized by antioxidants, or they damage cells.G-spot—a controversial area of the brain on the front wall of the vagina,underneath the clitoris, thought to be extremely sensitive to touch and involvedin intense pleasure and orgasm.Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)—an inhibitory neurotransmitter involved withcalming brain function, has been implicated in problems with seizures, bipolardisorder, anxiety, and pain.Ginkgo biloba—an herb from the Chinese ginkgo tree that is known to improvecirculation and blood flow and has been shown to be helpful in dementia.Glutamate—excitatory (stimulating) neurotransmitter.Hippocampus—part of the inside of the temporal lobes that facilitates memoryfunction.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—a brain scan that uses powerful magnets to lookat the physical structure of organs.Myelin—the whitish protein covering of neurons.Myelination—the act of laying down myelin onto neurons.Nerve growth factors (NGF)—one of several growth factors in the brain thatpromote the regeneration of nerve cells after injury.Neurogenesis—the growth of new neurons.Neuron—synonymous with nerve cell.Neurotransmitter—a chemical that is released from one neuron at the presynapticnerve terminal (the end of an axon), across the synapse where they may beaccepted by the next neuron (on the dendrites) at specialized sites calledreceptors.
