INTRODUCTION THE REVD WILLIAM ALEXANDER AYTON and his wife both joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (hereafter, the G.D.) in July 1888, about four months after Dr William Wynn Westcott, a London coroner, founded the Order. Ayton was, in fact, Westcott's twentieth recruit. W. B. Yeats, who first encountered him not long after he himself became a member of the Order in March 1890, described him (although without identifying him by name) in his autobiographical The Trembling of the Veil (1922, p. 70) as a white-haired old clergyman who was 'the most panic-stricken person' he had ever known. Samuel Liddell Mathers (who later called himself Count de Glenstrae or Count MacGregor), with Westcott a co-founder of the G.D., presented him to Yeats with the words: 'He unites us to the great adepts of the past.' Yeats continued: This old man took me aside that he might say - 'I hope you never invoke spirits - that is a very dangerous thing to do. 1 am told that even the planetary spirits turn upon us in the end.' 1 said, 'Have you ever seen an apparition?' 'Oh yes, once', he said. 'I have my alchemical laboratory in a cellar under my house where the Bishop cannot see it. One day 1 was walking up and down there when 1 heard another footstep walking up and down beside me. 1 turned and saw a girl 1 had been in love with when 1 was a young man, but she died long ago. She wanted me to kiss her. Oh no, 1 would not do that.' 'Why not?' 1 said. 'Oh she might have got power over me'. 'Has your alchemical research had any success?'"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"but it at least provided him with a modest stipend (Â£300 per annum at Chacombe) and sufficient leisure for his strictly private interests. In the Victorian era the Church of England offered a refuge for many young men who had no aptitude for commerce and a passage in one of Ayton's letters suggests that he was already preoccupied with alchemy and occultism at about the time he left Cambridge. He was initiated as a Freemason in Stjohn's Lodge No. 601 at Wellington, Shropshire, shortly before his fiftieth birthday in 1866, when he was Perpetual Curate at Oakengates, a nearby village. However, when he moved to Edingale, yet another village not far from Tamworth in Staffordshire in 1868, he did not bother to join the local lodge (Marmion No. 1060 at Tamworth) until 1871. Again, when he arrived at Chacombe in 1873 two years passed before he joined Cherwell Lodge No. 599 at Banbury in 1875. He was its Master in 1878 but ceased to attend meetings after April 188 I, although he remained at Chacombe for another thirteen years. Evidently his interest in conventional Freemasonry was not very great, although at one time or another he was a member of Churchill Lodge No. 478 at Oxford (joined 187 I) and Westminster and Keystone Lodge No. 10 (London) in 1872. Working the United Grand Lodge of England's more or less standard Emulation Ritual cannot have been very exciting for someone who had actually manufactured the elixir of life. 'A French alchemist said it had the right smell and the right colour ... ,' he told W. B. Yeats, 'but the first effect of the elixir is that your nails fall out and your hair falls off. I was afraid that I might have made a mistake and that nothing else might happen, so I put it away on a shelf. I meant to drink it when I was an old man, but when I got it down the other day it had all dried up.' After his retirement (on a minute pension) in 1894 he and his wife moved to a village in the East Grinstead, Sussex, district. After her death (c. July 1898) he lived briefly in the vicinity of Dartford, Kent, and was for a time in the Shepherd's Bush area in London 1900) before finally moving to Saffron Walden, Hertfordshire, where he died on I January 1909 (aet. 92). With a very few exceptions Ayton's surviving letters (about 10 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn I said. 'Yes, I once made the elixir of life. A French alchemist said it had the right smell and the right colour' (the alchemist may have been Eliphas Levi, who visited England in the 'sixties, and would have said anything). Ayton's letters indicate that he had a formidable knowledge of alchemical and occult literature, which he could read in the original Latin texts, also that he experimented with alchemical procedures. They appear, too, to reflect a feeling of guilt that a beneficed clergyman of the Church of England should engage himself in such unconventional pursuits: he was afraid, as Yeats mentioned, that his bishop would discover what was going on in his cellar. As we will discover, Ayton - Frater Virtute Orta Occident Rarius ('Those that rise by virtue rarely fall') in the G.D.; his wife was Soror Quam Potero Adjutabo ('I will help as much as I can') - had many bees in his clerical bonnet, including an obsessive fear of the machinations of 'the B.B.', i.e., the Black Brethren (Iesuitsl), and a trusting belief in the authenticity of Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky's Mahatmas, her and the Theosophical Society's invisible Secret Chiefs. He believed, too, in Elementals (nature spirits) and the dangerous territory inhabited by 'the gnomes'. By any standard of assessment the Vicar of Chacombe, a small village (population c. 450) close to Banbury in the county and diocese of Oxford, was a strange and remarkable man. W. A. Ayton, the son of William Capon Ayton, was born in the Bloomsbury district of London on 28 April 18 I 6, and was therefore in his 73rd year when he joined the G.D. in 1888. (Westcott was then forty and Mathers thirty-four.) He was educated at Charterhouse School in the City of London (long before it moved to more salubrious surroundings in Surrey in 1872) and matriculated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1837 (Scholar, Latin Prize Essay 1838-9, BA 1841). He was ordained deacon in the latter year and priest in 1843. He served in various rural parishes in the north Midlands before he was appointed Vicar ofChacombe in 1873 (aet. 57). Whether or not he had any particular vocation for the priesthood is a matter for conjecture, Introduction II"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Introduaion 12 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn seventy in all) were written to the much younger Frederick Leigh Gardner (his junior by forty years) between March 1889 and November 1905. They are worthy of publication, I believe, because they throw additional light upon the notable expansion of interest in occultism which began when the mysterious Madame Blavatsky settled permanently in London early in 1887. Together with Colonel Henry Olcott and William Q Judge she had founded the Theosophical Society in New York City in 1875. A London branch was formed three years later but there was little public interest in Great Britain until 188 I when H. P. Sinnett, who had been one of Madame Blavatsky's converts in India, published his Occult World. Sixty years later A. E. Waite recalled its 'remarkable account of strange phenomena and yet stranger claims': 'I remember very well the strange crew that filled Sinnett's drawing room at Theosophical gatherings,' he continued, 'the astrologers, the mesmerists, the readers of hands, and a few, very few only, of the motley spiritualist groups.\" When Westcott founded the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1888 he intended it to be a secret and highly-exclusive alternative to the Theosophical Society; in fact a school of occultism based on the Western hermetic-Qabalistic tradition, and hence without any Hindu or Buddhist elements. The Theosophical Society was open to all who wished to join it, but the door that led to the G.D. was closely guarded. The majority of the early male members of the G.D. (up to c.I892) were recruited from Westcott's friends in the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, known to the initiated as the Soc. Ros., which was exclusivelyMasonic. The S.R.I.A., of which Westcott was Secretary General, although he became its Supreme Magus in 1892, was not a Masonic lodge but, during the 1880s, an increasingly esoteric equivalent of a learned society. There were Colleges (i.e., branches) in the provinces - e.g., at Bristol, York and Newcastle upon Tyne. After 1887 a good many of its members also joined the Theosophical Society. Ayton was never in the Soc. Ros., probably because he found it inconvenient to 1 A. E. Waite, Shadows of Life and Thought (1938), p. 87. 13 travel to London for the Metropolitan College's quarterly meetings. W. B. Yeats was also not a member because he lacked the necessary Masonic qualification and left the Theosophical Society when he joined the G.D. in March 1890. Frederick Leigh Gardner, to whom Ayton's surviving letters were mainly written, was born in 1857 at Highbury in north London and was the son of an accountant. The family had moved to the recently-developed Gunnersbury area of Chiswick by the 1870S because Gardner fils was educated at the Godolphin School at Hammersmith. His first employment was as a clerk in a stockbroker's office ( c. 1875-86) and in the latter year founded his own small stockbroking firm. He married in c. 188 5Â· His parents were both addicted to spiritualism and he made a record of seances held at their home in 1878-9 when a certain Joseph was the medium.' On one occasion 'F.L.G. was slightly controlled by Silver Star' - the latter was no doubt one of the countless Red Indians who manifested themselves as 'spirit guides' - 'and tried all he could to expel the influence by making passes over the medium'. He was one of many who joined the Theosophical Society when Madame Blavatsky arrived in London. He preserved two sheets of paper with an automatic script message scribbled in an unidentified handwriting. It begins: 'Mr Gardner's Mahatma is Koot Hoomi - and we wish him to know it. We have not told you this before. If Mr Gardner will now use the Mahatmas's own name, he will strengthen the rapport, but he must not tell anyone.' He was active in the Theosophical Society milieu, knew Madame Blavatsky personally, belonged to her well-known Blavatsky Lodge in 1890 and attended her cremation at Woking when she died in 1891. In 1902, however, he was reported in the Chiswick Times as having 'latterly taken less interest in the movement owing to his lack of sympathy with the present 2 Notebook in the possession of the late Gerald Yorke. I found a few details about Gardner's family background in the Chiswick Times, 25 July 1902."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Introduction 14 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn management', which meant that he did not have much use for Mrs Annie Besant and her colleagues. According to the same source: 'He has been a journalist, and whilst that journal was under the editorship of Miss Mabel Collins ... he contributed a series of articles to The Lady. He was at one time offered, but declined, the City editorship of Vanity Fair and was a regular correspondent to Lucifer:' Gardner's masonic career was brief. He was initiated in Montefiore Lodge No. 1017 (whose membership was almost entirely Jewish) in October 1886 (aet. 29) but resigned in June 1889, three months after he began to correspond with Ayton. It is possible that Freemasonry did not satisfy his desire for further knowledge of 'the hidden mysteries of Nature and Science' - the phrase is Masonic - and supposed that alchemy and Theosophy a la Blavatsky would provide a better guide to the territory that interested him. In 19Â°2 he claimed to possess a library of over 10,000 books on alchemy and occultism, including 'a fine set of the works of Thomas Taylor, the Platonist'. He found his way to the G.D. in 1894 but resigned from the Isis Urania Temple in London in the autumn of 1897 after a spectacular row with MacGregor Mathers, a co-Chief of the Order with Dr Westcott. I have described his brief but by no means uneventful career in the G.D. at some length in The Magicians of the Golden Dawn, and need say no more here. When he broke with the G.D. Gardner remained on friendly terms with Dr Westcott, who had been obliged to retire into the background, but for different reasons, some months earlier (see p. 86 below). However, the .1 Mabel Collins had been co-editor with H.P.B. of Lucifer, a heavily-subsidised Theosophical periodical, but was 'thrown out' in May 1888 after a row with Madame Blavatsky 'because of her behaviour with two young men'. She became Mrs Keningdale Cook after her departure and sued H.P.B. for libel in 1890, although the suit was dropped just before it was to be heard in court. See A. H. Nethercott, The First Five Lives ofAnnie Besant (1961), p. 330. Mabel Collins was the author of Light on the Path (1885), which was widely read in Theosophical circles. There were many reprints, including a Russian translation (Geneva, 1925). 15 latter remained Supreme Magus of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia until he went to live in Durban, South Africa, in 1920. Indeed, he was still corresponding with Gardner in 19 2 4 a year before his death on 30 June 19 2 5. ' Gardner's early connection with the Soc. Ros. remains obs~ure - for example, why he joined the Bristol College on 12 April 1894 rather than the London Metropolitan College. According to the latter's Transactions for 1897-8, on 13 January 18 9 8 'V[ery] \"yv[orshipful] Frederick Leigh Gardner, having placed at the disposal of the High Council, at a nominal rental a most desirable room for use as a Library and Office, and having undertaken the important duties of Librarian, has been raised to t~e Honorary 8Â° and will act as Substitute Secretary General.' SInce the Soc. Ros. liked impressive titles Gardner was also Librarian General. He was its Secretary General 1901-5 but I have no information about his later connection (if any) with the Masonic 'Rosicrucians'. In 19Â°3 he published (privately) a Catalogue Raisonne of Rosicrucian Books in an edition of 500 copies. Dr Westcott contributed an Introduction. A second edition appeared in the sa~e year. This was followed in 1911 by Astrological Books, which contains information about certainly early nineteenth- ~entury publications that is not available elsewhere, and finally In 1912 Freemasonry: A Catalogue of Lodge Histories, which was merely a pamphlet. Dr Westcott also supplied brief contribu- tions for these. The Preface to Lodge Histories announced a forthcoming bibliography of alchemical works, but this never appeared. He retired from active membership of the Stock Exchange in March 19Â°3 and henceforth operated as an antiquarian bookseller from his home in Chiswick. He regularly advertised his catalogues in the Occult Review between 1912 and 19 25. The text never changed: 'A Private Collector is disposing of his Valuable Library ~~ Occult Books (upwards of 10,000 volumes), on account of failing health. Catalogue free on application. Prices moderate. \"Author\", 14 Marlborough Road, Gunners- bury, London, W.' Judging by the local Chiswick directories he probably died in 1930."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Introduction 16 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn Luckily Gardner was an inveterate hoarder and preserved the letters he received from Ayton, Westcott, MacGregor Mathers and other members of the G.D. Unfortunately his Theosophical Society correspondence, which must have been extensive, did not reach the ultimate destination of his G.D. papers, namely the late Mr Gerald Yorke, a patrician Gloucestershire landowner whom I first came to know well during the 1960s. Yorke acquired them after Gardner's death from the late Michael Houghton (i.e., Hurwitz) during the 1930S. Houghton was the founder and proprietor of the Atlantis Bookshop, then in Bury Street close to the British Museum. I used to visit it occasionally before the war, not to see Houghton but, rather, a German refugee bookseller whom Houghton allowed to occupy a corner of the ramshackle premises and who, much to Houghton's irritation, regularly sold me books that had no connection with occultism. At that time my lack of interest in arcane knowledge was total; indeed, it still is except in relation to the history of ideas or, if one likes, the study of 'intellectual underworlds' or sub-cultures. My preoccupation with the latter began in 1960 when I commenced the research for Urania's Children: The Strange World of the Astrologers; which was eventually published in 1967. In the course of investigating the extraordinary expansion of interest in astrology that began in Great Britain during the 1890S I discovered A. E. Waite's Shadows of Life and Thought (1938), and read his tantalizingly obscure account of the origins of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and his own experiences in the Order. Bewildered by Waite's obfuscations I decided to try to solve 'The Mystery of the G.D.' and The Magicians of the Golden Dawn: A Documentary History of a Magical Order, 1887-1923 appeared in 1972 (to be reissued by the Aquarian Press). When I began to work on the G.D. problem in 1970 there was only one possible point of departure, namely F. L. Gardner's papers, which Gerald Yorke had purchased from Houghton. â¢ Republished as Astrology and the Third Reich (Aquarian Press, 19 84). 17 Apart from Ayton's letters, which form the substance of this book, they included a mass of correspondence relating to Gardner's membership of the G.D. (1892-7) and his enduring relationship with Dr William Wynn Westcott. Gerald Yorke, that most generous of mortals, kindly lent me the complete colle~tion. The story of the. G.D.'s early years ( 18 87-9 2) remained totally obscure until I unexpectedly discovered an important cache of papers for which the occultists had been vainly searching for at least forty years. The story of this trouoaille will be found in The Magicians. In any event, the volume now in the reader's hands represents an extensive 'footnote' to my previous work on the G.D. . I must r~turn.' if only briefly, to Michael Houghton and introduce hIS friend the late Gerard Heym. I rediscovered Houghton in more commodious premises in Museum Street after the war. He was a mildly cantankerous 'occultist' who did a little writing and publishing on the side. The curious are referred to ?is T.he White Brother, An OccultAutobiogra#y (19 2 7), and poet~ m slim volumes: Shoot - and be Damned (1935), and Many Brightnesses (1954). He regularly announced his intention of fou.ndi~g an occult Order, but nothing ever came of the plan. He. died m c. 196~ and after a brief interval his bookselling business was acquired by the friendly members of the Collins family, who continue to specialise in 'occult' literature. It was Heym who advised the late F. L. Gardner's sister to sell her deceased brother's papers to Houghton. The latter introduced me to Heym, but that was some years before I became involved with the G.D. problem in 1968 or I would have questioned him on the subject of Gardner. Heym was a ~nowledgeable and energetic eollector of rare alchemical literature - so knowledgeable and energetic, indeed, that some London (and possibly also Parisian) antiquarian booksellers suspected that some small and easily portable items found their way ~o h~s vast and secre.t (!) library in Chelsea by a process of telekinesis, He used to invite me to take tea with him at the Devonshire Club where he spoke in whispers (literally) about secret plans and connections. I last saw him in Paris in September 1962 but speedily made my escape when he"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"18 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn broached the subject of an investment in an inevitably risky alchemical publishing venture. After all, alchemists should know how to make their own gold. The curious are referred to his articles in Ambix (Journal for the Study of Alchemy and Early Chemistry, I,i, 1937). I was delighted when I discovered a copy of Aleister Crowley's Equinox (j.i) with an inscription in Heym's handwriting to the effect that he was '10Â° = 1Â°. Supreme Magus of the R + C. Paris, 193 I'. The late Gerard Heym was the Supreme Magus of precisely nothing. However, we owe it to him that the Ayton Papers eventually reached the irascible Mr Houghton and proceeded thence to Gerald Yorke. I have preferred to omit any annotation for the many old alchemical books to which Ayton referred in his letters to Gardner. In any case there was often more than one edition and Ayton hardly ever provided dates for the copies in his possession. For detailed biographical and bibliographical information the reader is referred to John Ferguson, Bibliotheca chemica (Glasgow, 1906) and [Denis I. Duveen], Bibliotheca alchemica et chemica (London, 1949). However, I have included footnote references to contemporary publications, personalities and events, and have indicated the location of the very few letters that were not in Gerald Yorke's collection. All the letters are to Gardner unless otherwise indicated. Finally, I must record my thanks to Mr R. A. Gilbert, a learned antiquarian bookseller at Bristol (4 Julius Road, Bishopston, Bristol), whose catalogues have provided both accurate information and occasional gusts of laughter; to Mr John Hamill, Librarian of the United Grand Lodge of England; to the staffs of the London Library (as so often during the past forty years), the Chiswick Public Library and the Library of the Theosophical Society of England. THE LETTERS Device used by Ayton on his writing paper T HE EARLIEST of Ayton's surviving letters was written in 1886 to Captain Francis George Irwin (1828-93), of Bristol. A. E. Waite described him in The Brotherhood of the Ro~y Cross (19 24, PPÂ·568 ff.) as 'a believer in the occult arts within the measure of a thinking and reading person of his particular mental class ... for the rest [he] was satisfied apparently With the pursuits of spiritualism, to the truth of which his circle bears witness in unpublished writings'. Waite mentioned too that Irwin 'was a zealous and amiable Mason, with a passion forRites and an ambition to add to their number'. For Irwin's career (military, Masonic and pseudo-Masonic) see my 'Fringe Masonry in England, 187Â°-85' in A rs Quatuor Coronatorum, vol. 85 for 197 2 . Ayton's letter reached the library of the United Grand Lodge of England, together with about 150 others from various correspondents, a year after Irwin's death. I used them extensively for theAQC article mentioned above.

Irwin, of Bristol], I am very glad to have a letter from you. My time certainly is fully occupied, especially since the discovery that Burgoyne, was an alias for T. H. D'Alton, or Dalton, alias Seymour, a convicted felon. I I too commenced with Spiritualism and worked it out, tho' from my earliest years I had been reading Cornelius Agrippa, Philalethes and others without being able to get any light. As to skeptisism not suiting me, I am an Occultist first of all, & then anything else. I did not know, or had not realised that I was to be chief in the new Rite of Perfection in the Sat B'hai. 2 I have been too harassed with the H.B. ofL. to attend to anything else. I will attend to it as soon as possible. My own experience of Astrology and the Taro, is, that neither is of much use, unless you have developed the inner light so as to see spiritual correspondence of each Symbol as it turns up. If you have not read P. Christian's His to ire de fa Magie you should do so. He gives an account of what Cagliostro did in the way of predictions by the Taro.' It and Astrology are closely interlinked. Unless one has undergone the training which Cagliostro had, we cannot do the same, tho' we may get some kind of approximation to events. Mesmerism is a part only of the Great Science, tho' a most important part, & Cagliostro was also proficient in that. I do not think seances with Eglinton' will do any real good, and possibly harm. Spiritualism is part of the key to Occultism, but only a small part, and a new dangerous part taken by itself only. I do not think P[eter] D[avidson] knew that T.H.B. was a convicted felon, but when he did know it, he still embarked with his family and this felon for America. He has not been over scrupulous and has been making use of Occultism for mere secular gain. I could tell you much of it if I were to see you personally. I know about Thomas.'

Ayton I Thomas Henry Dalton (aet. 27) described as a grocer, was sentenced to seven months imprisonment at Leeds Borough Sessions in January 1883 on a charge of conspiring to obtain money by false pretences. He and another were running a fraudulent 'National Employment Agency and Mercantile Assistants' Bureau' (see the Leeds Mercury, ro january 1883). After his release from prison Dalton, who now used the pseudonym Burgoyne, became Secretary of a spurious 'Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor', which was founded by a so-called occultist called Peter Davidson. According to A. E. Waite (in A New and Revised Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry, new and revised [it was not!] edition, 1923, art. 'Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor') Ayton, whom he clearly identified, although not by name, was unwittingly involved to the extent that he not only joined the 'H.,B. ofL.' but 'appears to have been unwisely active in securing subscribers among people of his own class and remitted their monies to Burgoyne'. There was a scandal, which greatly affected Ayton. Davidson and Dalton fled to the USA, where, according to Waite, Davidson continued to run the H.B. of L. 2 I have described the Royal Oriental Order of the Sat B'hai as 'a comic pseudo-Masonic balloon, which rose a few feet into the air, wobbled briefly and then quietly collapsed without the average member of the Craft knowing that the thing had ever existed' ('Fringe Masonry in England, 1870-85', AQC, vol. 85, 1972). Nevertheless, it recruited a few Freemasons without much sense of discrimination during the period 187 I -80. After the latter date it fell into the hands of John Yarker, a major collector of pseudo-Masonic 'nonsenses', who ingeniously amalgamated its Ceremony of Perfection with the ritual of a recent novely called the Order of Light. The latter had been launched without any audible beating of drums by Maurice Vidal Portman in 1882. It had the same echoes of Hinduism as the Sat B'hai, but with a Qabalistic top-dressing.

It IS inconceivable that the Protestant Vicar of Chacombe would have tolerated the use of incense in the parish church, but his cellar, where he performed his alchemical experiments, may have reeked of the stuff. Private I brought Bronchitis home with me from London and have only had energy enough to get through what was absolutely required of me. As to Alchemical Books the~e are plenty of them but all written with a view of conceahng rather than revealing. There do exist MSS in which it is more plainly revealed, but by no means clear to those who have not s~me k~nd of an initiation.

From this labour I have always s~runk. It re~Ulres the whole man's undivided attention, and having a Profession, I cannot enter upon the practical part without interruption. . I do not recollect what books I mentioned to you. Were I quite at leisure and wishing to know more on this subject, I should 3 Chacombe Vicarage 1St April 1889 The Letters 25 search out all there is in the Brit[ish] Mus[eum] in MS, but this would be a long task. The printed books which will help you most are Basil Valentine's \"Last Will and Testament\" and \"Triumphant Chariot of Antimony\". These are translated into English. Then there are two Commentators who have tried to enlighten his obscurity, who are Kerckringius and Johannes Fabre, but the latter is the best. Paracelcus has written much on it, and revealed much, but he has concealed as much as he has revealed. Cornelius Agrippa has been translated into English, for I have seen a copy which did belong to the poet Dryden. C [ornelius] A[grippa] writes of the whole of Occult Philosophy, and is of very little use for Alchemy in particular. You should read \"The Golden Calf' of Helvetius in which he gives an account of the visit of Vieroont, the brass-founder, to him in 1666 and giving him a small portion of the powder of projection by which he did transmute Cad[?] into silver. This Vieroont was the Nephew of Elias the Artist, and must have learned of him, a fact not generally known. For the short process, Monte Snyder is one of the best teachers, but there are only 2 copies of him in Brit. Mus., and both are in German. Lambsprinck, also in German, teaches a great deal to those who have the clue. Flamel gives the usual symbolical teaching. Bernard Trevisan also teaches much, and rather more plainly. Eugenius Philalethes is very enigmatical. Alexis of Piedmont is more clear. You may read all these and yet fail to get a sufficient perception of what is meant. Even if you get a perception, then comes the great difficulty of the process, in the details of which you may err for ever. Labour and anxiety and disappointment and vexation are the general lot of those who enter this study. Of course, if a student can conquer entirely his lower nature, and develop his higher faculties, he is much more likely to get the full perception of the process. This again is a most difficult thing to enter upon, and all but impossible to those engaged in my business. In the List of works sold by the T[heosophical] P[ublishing] S[ociety] are some on the Yoga Philosophy which will give you some idea of the process for gaining the higher spiritual powers.

What I write about now is as to the symbols [for sulphur, earth and air] ~, );J., 6.. You will do best to get \"A Dictionary of Chemistry\" &c. by Dr Andrew Ure, 1823, in which there is a folding chart giving the Alchemical Symbols and their meaning. You will pick this up second hand for IS., or 15.6d. or 25. There is a second-hand bookseller, Joseph Sakeld, 314 Clapham Road, SW., who would be very likely to have it. I believe he has removed to another No. in Clapham Road, but I have sent away his last catalogue, and it may be that 314 is where he has removed to. There is also a folding chart of the same, but containing rather more in Basil Valentine's \"Two Treatises\" &c. to which the name Johannes Worlidge is signed. This is generally bound up with his \"Last Will & Testament\". It seems to me that as you do not know these first principles, you would do well to belong to the so-called \"Rosicrucian Society of England\". In it all the first principles are taught in successive degrees. It is all from the Holy Qabbalah. There is an examination for every degree, which is a very good discipline. They teach what the T[heosophical] S[ociety] never has done, and never will. You get all the Alchemical first principles, and they have most important MSS upon that great subject, the Taro. This would enable Mrs Gardner to exercise her powers of clairvoyance in a legitimate way without danger, for the Taro prevents the imagination from wandering. A short time ago, an ukase was issued from the headquarters of the T.S., that members of the Esoteric Section should not belong to any other Occult Order. I at once wrote to say that I belonged to the Rosicrucian Society, but I was ordered to give it up, and I felt bound to do so at once without hesitation, and wrote to some of my Yorkshire chelas,' who belonged to it and the T.S., to do the same.

It is extraordinary that Ayton, who confidently informed Gardner that the G.D. taught 'what the T.S. has never done and never will', was nevertheless prepared to resign from the Golden Dawn at Madame Blavatsky's behest. He evidently supposed that she was an Adept of the highest class. 2 Dr Westcott, who was a London coroner had a financial interest in the S~nitary Wood, 'Y0ol C?mpany, suppli~rs of surgical dressings. At that time the G.D. s inner circle met at its Hatton Garden premises. 1 Ayton's 'Yorkshire chelas' (i.e., pupils) were members of the Golden Dawn's Horus Temple at Bradford. By the end of 1888 it had about a dozen members, mainly recruited from the S.R.I.A., although there were a few women. The deputation to H.P.B. would have included T. H. Pattison, 8Â° honoris causa in the Soc. Ros. and Frater 30 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn she had made a mistake and she wrote to me for advice, which I gave, and the consequence was, she withdrew this ukase as regards this Rosicrucian Society. The result was that Dr Wynn Westcott, the head of this Rosicrucian Society, joined the Esoteric Section of the T.S. and with him some 20 others, and about 14 from Yorkshire. All is well that ends well! There is now at Bradford a flourishing Lodge of this Rosicrucian Society and the Lodge is worked very well indeed by men who really know something. Dr Wynn Westcott is well known in Masonry, and MacGregor Mathers, the learned Qabbalist, is also in it. If you think of joining it, the address for all Members and others is:- G. D. Secretary, c/o Sanitary Wood Wool Co,' II Hatton Garden, E.C. Ladies are admitted. Mrs Ayton and I went through an examination this last time in London, Mrs A. passing without making one mistake.

H.P.B. is quite right as to Piazzi Smythe's [i.e., Smyth's] mistakes. He is, I think, not an Occultist, nor even a Freemason, and therefore he must fall into error [see footnote on p. 26 above]. As a Freemason, you would see the use of the Sarcophagus or Coffin, in which the Initiate would [symbolical- ly] lay three days and 3 nights in darkness.

Members abstained from alcohol and tobacco as well as meat. 2 i.e., The Religio-Philosophical Journal, a spiritualist periodical published at Chicago. 'The letters' referred to the correspondence between Dr Elliott Coues and Mabel Collins. Coues was a prominent American Theosophist who was currently intriguing against William Q Judge, the head of the American Section of the Theosophical Society. Mabel Collins had recently been ejected from the Blavatsky Lodge (see p. 32 above). The Cones-Collins letters and other communications published in the Religio-Philosophical Journal made grave charges against H.P.B., e.g., that the so-called Mahatma Letters were faked. The publication of the Coues-Collins correspondence began in the issue of II May 1889 and continued in June. The fact that Ayton knew about the letters very early in June 1889 indicates (a) that rank and file members of the T.S. were greatly interested in what was afoot behind the scenes and (b) puzzled by the sudden disappearance of Mabel Collins. Gardner would have made it his business to pick up all the latest gossip.

Mrs Gardner must avoid anything like mediumship for the present. It takes too much out of one. Quantity is a sine qua non in making the quintessence of Balm, and I fear you must defer it till another year. Household slops continually put on a certain area of soil, and then dug well up, trenched and exposed to frost in winter, make a very good compost. Further digging up so as to mix it well will be necessary. You could get Balm in Covent Garden market I suppose, but it would not have been gathered in the Planetary hour. You must not overdo it with any manure. There is plenty of artificial manure in the market from which you might select. Even a little guano well mixed will do.

Got all hay up yesterday! 1 Wilhelm Heinrich Schussler was a German author of books on homoe.opathy. Ayt?n may have read C. Hering, The Twelve Tissue R~medtes of Dr Sch.lissler (1874). Occultists were particularly identified with hom?eopathic remedies at that time. During the 1890S the membership of the Golden Dawn included at least half a dozen quali~ed p~ysicians who were homoeopaths. The Schussler remedies are stIll available, ~ee Dr G. W. Carey and 1. E.

Lessell (Thorsons Publishers Ltd, 19 8 4). 2 The 'Rosicrucian Society' was the Golden Dawn and not the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. Ayton was not a member of the latter. 3 The Esot~ric Section was an Inner Group, almost a cult, within ll~e T~eosophical Society. It had already created a great deal of dissension and was to cause more. W. B. Yeats joined it in October 1~89.

No doubt the latter end of this century, as of the last, is a culminating point in human destiny. The T.S. itself is an outcome of this crisis, and the 2 things are intimately bound up together. After all, we had not half time enough to talk over things. It is not impossible that Cowes may be mixed up with D' Alton but 1 do not think he is, so far as 1 have seen. It appears to me like a B.B. scheme, but 1 have not yet had sufficient evidence to decide. 'I SHOULD BE very doubtful about Mrs B. but will suspend judgment till I see her,' Ayton wrote on 25 July 1889. Mrs B. was none other than Annie Besant (1847-1933), the Theo- sophical Society's latest and almo~t unbelievably spectac,ul~r recruit. Arthur H. Nethercott descnbed her road to the T.S. III the first chapter of his masterly The First Five Lives of Annie Besant (1961): In 188 5, before she was forty, Mrs Annie Besant was known all over the English-speaking world, and by many people on the Continent, as one of the most remarkable women of her day. She was a freethinker; a consorter with materialists like Charles Bradlaugh; an agitator in Radical political circl,es, agai? .like Bradlaugh; a feminist; an early convert to Fabian Socialism, through the agency of Bernard Shaw; a. teacher of SCience; an author-editor-publisher; the first prornment woman to fight openly for what is now called birth control; a social and educational reformer; and an orator whose power was so compelling and whose charm was so potent that Shaw was only one among thousands who extolled her as the greatest woman speaker of the century. Shortly after 1885 she was to become still more notorious, as a strike leader and union organiser - anathema to the conventional and conservative in both church and state. But by 1893 she had cut completely loose from her rebellious and sensational past and had embarked upon her even more rebellious and sensational future. She was to become the successor to the fantastic Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and the international president of the stormy and mystical Theosophical Society. Later, in ~ndia, she would be a conspicuous and idolised religious, educational, and political leader; one-time president of the Indian National Congress; and an admired older friend. and example to Mohanadas Gandhi; whose eventual break with her over the best methods of achieving Indian independence led to his fame and martyrdom and her eclipse. 12 At Henry Lay Esqre Staverton Court by Cheltenham 25 July 1889"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"38 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn Mrs Ayton and I are tolerably well.

When we think of coming to London is for the week including the Equinox, 2 I st September, to attend the Society I told you of, but it would be so inconvenient to get back to Chiswick if our meeting is late at night, that I think we must just run up on purpose for that ~o our accustomed Hotel, and come to you before or after that time. I will write about that further on. We should like for H.P.B. and the Countess [Wachtmeister] to be at 17 [Lansdowne Road] when we come to visit you, that we might go there together. We have visitors coming as soon as we return home from Brighton, and we should not be free till September. You do not say whether Mrs Gardner's health is better yet. Mrs Ayton joins with me in kind regards to her and yourself. Supposing, by chance, that Schussler's medicines fail you, there is the immense power of Electricity to try. My friend here caught frightful rheumatism by being put into a damp bed when he was on a shooting expedition, and he was desperately ill and suffering. I recommended him to try Electricity. He bought Arnold & Sons apparatus for Â£10. It has quite cured him and he is as well as ever. I i.e., J.-M. Ragon (1781-1862), a prolific writer on French Freemasonry and rituals. His Mafonnerie occulte was published in 1853. 2 George Redway was a small London publisher who specialized in occult books and also sold them second-hand. He published A. E. Waite's digest of Eliphas Levi's works, based upon Dogme et rituel de la haute magic, in 1886 and his TheReal History of the Rosicrucians in 1887. The latter caused much annoyance among the adepts of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. In 1897 he published S. L. MacGregor Mathers' The Kabbalah Unveiled, having bought the copyright for Â£35. (The eleventh impression appeared under the Routledge & Kegan Paul imprint in 1970!). For Redway's unsatisfactory dealings with Mathers (and indirectly with F. L. Gardner) in connection with the The Letters 39 t()rm,e~'s The Sacred Magic of Abra~Melin the Mage ( 18 9 8 ), see my The MagzClans of the Golden Dawn (1972). Redway's business failed c.19 0 0 . ~ Ayton was referring to the recent death of Walter Moseley, of Butldwas Hall, Shrewsbury. According to A. E. Waite (The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, 19 24, p. 569), his 'health had been seriously damaged by the us~ of drugs ~or occu~t purp?S~s'. George Redway acquired his books on Occult Ph.t1osophy and similar subjects, including a number of Hockle~ manuscnpts. A copy of Redway's catalogue is in the library of the United Grand Lodge of England. 4 Countess Wachtmeister was one of the many titled early converts to Theosophy. She joined the T.S. in 1881 and became a close friend and associate of Madame Blavatsky. The 'nobility' included th Ba~oness .de Pal~andt who joined, the Golden Dawn early in 18 9 I an~ resigned III Apnl 1893. A note in a complete list of G.D. members 188 7- 97 described her as 'no good'. 13 Chacombe Vicarage 29 August 1889 You asked me I think to tell you of any of Behmen's [jakob Boehme's] work~, .wherefore I send you by this post a Cat: [catalog~e] co?tammg one at p.z, which I received this morning.

I happened to have preserved the Freethinker/ as I thought it im~ortant. Where it came from was a puzzle to me. I am much obliged to you for letting me know what is going on. I was very doubtful about Mrs Besant, and afraid she was to be another betrayer, but after reading her very able speech, I think much better of her. In fact she has stated the case of the T[heosophical] S[ociety] with the greatest perspicacity and truthfulness. I. retur~ it to you by this post, together with another small affair, which you need not return. These few extraordinary warm days have made a great change in the views of our farmers, and this morning there was a special Meeting, and it was resolved that the Church cleaning &c. must begin this very next Monday, and that they must have the Harvest Thanksgiving Service on Sunday zznd September for special reasons. Consequendy that the Church must be closed on Sundays 8th and r gth, and that if! wanted my Holiday, th~t I must go next week. Therefore, if convenient to you, I should like to come to you next Thursday the 15th September, and if not The Letters 41 too long for you, I .would stay over Sunday, as on that day you would be more at liberty for a long talk. Mrs Ayton will not be able to come .with n:e, as her gre~t friend, the Sister of Major Waterhouse, IS staymg at the Pnory and they are seeing one another every day. Moreover, her Sister may come sooner as she will be alone.

It is very well that I came home, for, mischief would have accrued by my absence. I felt sure of that from Mrs Ayton's letters. We start again on Saturday.

Had my opinion been asked beforehand, I should have said \"Don't\". Somewhere about 30 years ago Eliphas Levi in one of his works said, that Occultism could not be a worldly success, unless some Millionaire took it up. The T.S. has not arrived at that yet, nor do I think that E.L. has contemplated such a case as the T.S. My own opinion is that it is destined to survive, at least during the life-time of the Founders. Beyond that, I cannot see. It has survived a much worse crisis than the present, when it was placed under Dr A. K. [i.e. Archibald Keightley]. The whole of that was by trusting people who ought, by rights, not even to be admitted as Freemasons. Notwithstanding all these blunders, I now perceive that the very blunders committed by the Agents of the Mahatmas tend to carry out their intentions by bringing it before the Public. The T.S. is now most grossly assailed and slandered by all the Spiritist Journals here, and in America, with, in all probability, (unknown to themselves) the B.B. [Bla~k Brethren; Jesuits] in the back-ground. This will probably end m clearing off all the unstable and useless Members, and forming a much stronger and effective, tho' smaller body. Had I only just the means ofliving quietly, in addition to Â£100,000, I would give the latter to help the T.S. As it is, I have only enough to live quietly. We give to it what we can afford, but nothing will induce us to risk any responsibility, for the mismanagement past, and which is sure to recur in the future. I have seen enough of all such affairs in my time, to get a tolerably accurate perception of the whole position, present and future. The appeal from India is most ill-judged and ill-timed. Harte is a very pleasant fellow and very zealous. Altho' he never uses Col. O[lcott]'s name, I doubt very much whether he would have approved of this appeal.' My idea of the position is, that some tremendous crisis is at hand, which is foreseen by the Mahatmas, and which will probably necessitate their interference in a more open way, even as the Count St German [i.e. Saint-Germain] interfered in the first French Revolution. The T.S. by making known the \"Secret Doctrine\" &c. generally, altho' the minds of men are now far too much taken up with worldly gain, and worldly pleasures, will, in this great crisis, and the terrible sufferings and distress The Letters 45 attend.ant u~on it, then turn to the Mahatmas and their pure Doct~mes, instead of the spurious Xtianity which the B.B. [Iesuits] have foisted upon us, and part of which still adheres (without their being aware of it) even to the most Ultra- Protest~nt bodies. The. T.S., as I take it, is only laying a foundat~on for future acnon when the fulness of time has come. Th~re IS a great ~ea.l of wisdom in biding your time, with patience and equarumny. Even su~posing the T.S. to break up a1togeth~r, we can, as you say, st111 carry on its intentions by Conventions amongst ourselves, and this I should be most ready to do.

The British Theosophical Society now changed its name to the London Lodge of the Theosophical Society with Sinnett as its President.

We find the inside of a week in London all too short for what we want to do, and were obliged to forego seeing several friends. Mrs Ayton is very nearly herself again, but not quite. We both walked into Banbury this morning, and drove back, so there cannot be much wrong. \"Suggestive Inquiry\" was really written by South, but I think a Lady had something to do with bringing it out and suppressing it, tho' here my memory fails me. I do not think it was suppressed on account of giving processes too clearly, but because it makes the truth of the whole things so very clear. You will do well to read it. Mesmeric trance'. South pere, however,Â· 'decided that the world was not ready for this great revelation ... and suppressed his daughter's book when less than 100 copies had been distributed. The withdrawn copies were burnt and the authoress spent much time and money obtaining as many of the issued copies as she could, destroying most of these also.' The book was reissued in 1918 with the sanction of Isabelle de Steiger (formerly a member of the Horus and Amen-Ra Temples of the Golden Dawn at Bradford and Edinburgh) who had inherited both Mrs Atwood's papers and, according to Mr Gilbert, her prophetic mantle. 'Such a sanction', Mr Gilbert added, 'accords well with the complete lack of recognition given to the Suggestive Inquiry by more scholarly students of its subject matter.' Isabelle de Steiger (1836-1927) was acquainted with many of the leading personalities in contemporary esoteric circles. Apart from Mrs Atwood she was particularly close to Dr Anna Bonus Kingsford (who requires a biographical study). Her relationship with Madame Blavatsky and Annie Besant was less cordial. Towards the end of her long life she was an enthusiastic admirer of Rudolf Steiner. See her rambling posthumous Meml)rabilia (1927), to which A. E. Waite contributed a preface.

All the old writers tell you \"The regimen of the fire is the most important part.\" From my experience, I believe that without a personal preparation, it is in vain to attempt it. A friend of mine who is upon this line, was making experiments in a room next to that in which were his wife and children, and it did not succeed. He is also in communication with intelligences in or out of the flesh, and gets most extraordinary knowledge given him. One of these intelligences told him that the reason he did not succeed was because of the too great contiguity of his family. There are conditions necessary of which the generality of seekers have no idea. If I felt sure you were in right earnest in seeking the necessary personal conditions, I should be very glad to give you the benefit of my experience and practice, but I dare not do it in writing, nor except under the most inviolable secresy [sic]. The difficulties in the practice are immense and inconceivable except to those who have made attempts at it. Chacombe Vicarage 12 April 1890 - Just a line to congratulate you on your acquisition of books. It is always a good sign when an aspirant attracts to himself books on the one important subject. Langlet Dufresnoy is most useful, one to whom I am always referring. If I see a book in a Catalogue, I refer to Dufresnoy and mostly can see whether it is worth while getting. Pernety is not mentioned by Dufresnoy, I think, but he is by Ragon, and is invaluable. Naude is well worth reading. I do not possess these last 2, but have read Naude. Macerus is mentioned by Dufresnoy, more than two dozen [times?], among which is the Viatorium, which you have. I have 3 of his not mentioned by Dufresnoy, one on Basil Valentine, one of Thos.

Oswald Wirth's Le Livre de Thoth: Les 22 arcanes de Tarot dessines a l'usage des inities sur les indications de Stanislas de Guaita (edition limited to 100 copies with the twenty-two Major Trumps, hand-coloured), in a slip-case, was also published in 1889. It is unlikely that this book was known in Great Britain. A prospectus for K. R. H. Mackenzie's The Game of Tarot, Archaeologically and Symbolically Considered - 'in preparation, in Small Quarto, with lIlustrations in the Text, and lIlustrations in a separate Case. Price One Guinea' - reached at least the proof stage. Mackenzie mentioned the book in a letter to Westcott dated 7 August 1879. If this publication had ever appeared it would have antedated Papus's Le Tarot des bohemiens by a number of years (see my The Magidans of the Golden Dawn, p. 30). A. P. Morton's translation of Papus's work was published in 1892. Waite's revised edition appeared in 1910. Your letter received. It would have been safer for you to stick to Schussler's medicines for Mrs Gardner. I have known so many cases of deafness from Quinine. It also does other mischief. For a tonic and giving appetite, there is nothing like Cascara Sagrada in small doses, say 5 drops a day, and never does any harm. It is impossible to talk of our subject [i.e., Alchemy] in writing. It causes nothing but mutual misunderstanding. If you and Mrs Gardner could come here for a day or two, we could have a further talk. I am perfectly willing to impart what little I know so far as it can be imparted. For the next month, I shall be most particularly occupied with a furnace I am building [for these?] Occult matters, besides having some visitors that we could hardly arrange for it till after this time, and I daresay you will be more at liberty as the Season advances. It is very uncertain when we may be in London again, and when we are, we have special business which makes it most difficult to enter upon these subjects in the short time we have. I mentioned you to Johnson whom you may have seen at 17 [Lansdowne Road], as being able to give him information about 54 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn one on Abbot Cremer, but I have not the Viatorium. All his are valuable. I have also Alexis Piedmontese, who gives some important processes, from which much may be learned. My \"War of the Knights\" is not that published in \"Hermetical Triumphs\". Dives sicut ardens S. is, if [I] recollect rightly, Saunier, not mentioned by Dufresnoy. The third stage as you have been informed, constitutes the difficulty, and in order to get over this, I have an idea you must first discover the Elixir vitae and restore your health, to enable you to pull thro', but this part is necessarily very obscure. I should like to put all these things to the test. I am so frightfully busy just now, I do not know how to arrange for seeing you. We are sorry to hear of Mrs Gardner's illness. There is a new American medicine called \"Radam's Microbe Killer', III Oxford St., W. of which great things are written and said. I am trying to find out about it, but cannot yet. It is 15s. a bottle and a bottle is a gallon. I do not like to venture upon it, without being more sure. Wilson of York is trying to find out. If I were very bad I would venture to try it.

I forgot to mention it to you. He is a very good sort of man. 1 Probably Charles Johnston, of Dublin, who had been at school with W. B. Yeats. At the age of eighteen he read a paper on Theosophical theories of evolution at a meeting of the Dublin Hermetic Society. It was subsequently printed in the Dublin University Review. He helped to form a Dublin lodge of the T.S. in 1886. Yeats did not join it but became a member of the Blavatsky Lodge soon after he came to London in 1887 and was admitted to the Esoteric Section late in 1888. The Golden Dawn appeared to offer more interesting occult experiences and he was initiated in it on 7 March 1890. Charles Johnston married Madame Blavatsky's niece and would have been regarded as a member of the family circle at 17 Lansdowne Road. We are very grieved to hear of your misfortune. Such things must happen to every man I suppose, and are part of our experience and discipline. No wonder at your being upset. We wish you a speedy return of the favours of Fortune. In the mean time, there is nothing like bearing evils with equanimity and fortitude. I do not think that you will make much out of \"Mutus Liber\". I believe I have seen it, but cannot recollect that I got anything out of it. Unless you have arrived at a certain condition, mere Symbolism is not much use. If you have arrived at a certain condition, it teaches everything. I have just had a letter from my most learned friend [unidentified], saying that he is more and more convinced that one must first attain to Spiritual Adeptship, before you can get the Physical Adeptship of [alchemical] Transmutation. I think I have evidence to the contrary, but I should not like to set my opinion against that of a man who, in addition to a natural genius for the Occult, has been at it since childhood, has the best books and MSS, and knows the whole subject. With all these advantages, he has not succeeded, and is very dejected and The Letters 57 thinks the fates are against him. From this you may judge what a difficult task you are entering upon. I do not think you have yet realised the enormous difficulty. We are glad Mrs Gardner is well again. Mrs Ayton has had another fortnight's serious illness, but is now recovering. I am up to my head and ears in a pool of mixed Parochial Saecular and Occult work and do not know which way to turn. ' I will write again about your coming. Chacombe Vicarage 21 June 1890 We have been busy with having Miss Bergson here for the ti~e required .by Law for Publication of Banns of Marriage, which ended m Mr MacGregor Mathers coming down last Monday, marrying her in my Church and carrying her off.' This has somewhat delayed my asking you to come as arranged, but the w~ath~r has not been propitious as yet, and we may now hope it will be warmer and more pleasant. If it would be convenient to you to come the end of next week, say Friday or Saturday, 27th or 28th, and stay over Sunday, it would suit us best. We have Miss Simpson with us now, and early in July we have two female Cousins coming, which would make our bed-rooms scarce, and we could not give you so good a one as you had last time. Please let us know-as soon as you conveniently can that we may be ready for you. We will not talk now but reserve it till you come. 1 I have not been able to discover what brought Mina - later she called her~elf Moina - Bergson, the sister of Henri Bergson, the ~rench philosopher, to London. According to Annie Horniman: 'Early III October 1882 at the Slade School [of Art], University College, Gower Street, I made the acquaintance of Mina Bergson. In the beginning of 1888 she introduced Mr Mathers to me as an interesting man whom she did not want to marry.'

Please excuse me not answering directly, for Xmas brings me such multifarious duties & interruptions that I am not my own master. In your letter, I think there is a solution of continuity, in your having omitted one or two words necessary to the full understanding of your meaning. However, you allude to Davidson and Thomas. I assume you mean Peter Davidson of the H[ermetic] B[rotherhood] of L[uxor] & Thomas, of Frodsham, Cheshire, the Spiritualist and Medium. As you did not belong to the H.B. of L. and I did not send you the particulars of the smashing-up of the whole wretched affair [sic]. It came to my knowledge that Burgoyne, the Secretary, of whom I had always been suspicious, was no other than a man I had known previously under the name of D' Alton who made such a confession of Black Magic that I rejected him altogether as being impossible. Subsequently to that he committed a felony, and underwent many months of imprisonment for it in Armley Gaol, Leeds. I did not know him under the name of Burgoyne and he took care that I should never see him. When I told Davidson that his Secretary was a convicted felon, he made very light of it, so lightly, that I thought he must be as bad as Burgoyne. We got into communication with the detectives in Yorkshire, and it appears they were watching Burgoyne and the HB. ofL. all the time. They told us they knew all the time it was intended to be a very big swindle, and they were ready to come down upon it at the right moment. I saved them the trouble by blowing it out of the water as I could, as soon as I knew that Burgoyne was a convicted felon and that Davidson upheld him. We knew the whole history of Burgoyne, and that he had been a curse to every one who had employed him, a thorough deep-dyed scoundrel. We know all about him since he has been in America. He left a wife and family in England, but has married again there. The last I heard was that if he sees 2 or 3 The Letters 59 men in the distance approaching his quarters he turns pale and trembles. It is supposed he has been guilty of something which puts him in mortal fear, and that he contemplates going off to Australia. It is too long a tale to tell you the whole of it. If you know Thomas of Frodsham and mean him by your allusion, I can tell you about him. He has come entirely to grief and is sending begging letters to every one. He was a Medium in communication with the Colour Spirits with whom he appears to have had a Pact, but on two occasions nearly lost his life thro' them. The most apparently peaceable Elementals, if a storm happens to come on, will become very violent and uncontroll- able. The conflict of the elements seems to excite them to fury, and woe to the mortal, not being an Adept, who encounters them. Thomas has gone the way of all Mediums. I have investigated the circumstances as to a good many, and I find they all go wrong, sooner or later. It is the one thing to avoid. I should have very much have liked to have had a long talk with you personally, as one cannot put all these things down on paper. I am very much occupied in practical Occultism and that and my Profession leave me but little time to spare. This very bad weather has prevented us going to Banbury and we have no cards to send.

This being the case, I will tell you the stage I have now arrived at from which you may learn something. Of course, you will always understand there are certain things I dare not put on paper. . It will be quite convenient to us to receive you on Friday r jth till Monday rtith and we shall be very glad to see you. Mrs Ayton also will be glad to see Mrs Gardner with you if she does not mind this cold season. We have no horse now, and so cannot meet you. If you come alone, you would probably walk from Banbury, and if you will let me know what train, I will walk and meet you about l/Z way. If you do not care to walk, recollect we always employ Warren for Cabs. If you decide beforehand to drive, we will tell Warren to look out for you. The distance is just 3 miles and we always pay 35. You will find it burdensome to bring so many books. I know pretty well about Ripley, LulIe, La Turbe, and some of the others. The Mutus Liber I have not seen tho' I know about it, and it would be as well to bring that. Arnold de Villeneuve is obscure and unsatisfactory, but possibly there may be something in this MS if it were quite convenient for you to bring it, but I would not bother to bring the others. It would be impossible to get an idea of what Hampe is on a mere cursory examination. You are quite wrong about him. He goes on the true Paracelsian lines, only he writes much more clearly. Ifhe were not an Adept for the L[apis] P[hilosophorum] he was for the medicine, and probably did not care to go further. Neither should I, if I could only make the Elixir. The furnace you saw here is only of use for one thing. Nothing has given me more vexation and annoyance than that furnace. I have made another since you were here, which you 60 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn may not do you a positive good, but even a negative good is of advantage as a mental discipline. Ripley's being written, during Monkish times, as, like so many others, never intended to be understood by any but Initiates, and was a kind of advertisement that those who saw his MS, preceiving their utter inability to understand it, might apply to the Monasteries for Initiation. At the same time, the whole of Alchemy is there. The same remarks apply to Raymond Lully. Very much has been made of the fact of the existence of certain Rose Nobles which he made for one of [our?] Edwards. I have seen one. It is said that they have been assayed, and that modern Science proved them not to be gold, but a metal so like it, as to pass for it in those days of ignorance. Still, he must have known the real thing, and perhaps purposely mixed it with some other metal. There are several \"Tractatus\" or \"Traitez\" without Author's name, so that I cannot say anything about this. \"La T [illegible] des Philosophes\" will always be useful for reference. \"La Parole delaisse\" of Bernard Trevisan, I do not know, except by name. He is one who gives some very broad hints to those who have advanced sufficiently. Corneille Drebel, I only know by name. Something might be fished out of him, I daresay. Arnold de Villeneuve was a voluminous writer, and I think the MS you mention is not given amongst his works. He is said to have learned of Raymond Lully. Something may be learned of it, but when these old writers pretend to tell you great secrets, then you may most suspect of them of mystifying. However, altogether you have made a valuable acquisition. It is one of the stages the aspirant has to go through, to have well impressed upon the Mystic and for the most part unintelligible jargon in which this Art is veiled. You say you should like to see me to have a talk. As you seem so bent upon this, it would be as well, if you could, but I hardly see how it can be done just now. I like your tenacity and perseverance, and I would do all I could to help you. We may,be in London somewhere about the jrd week in March, but neither of us have been at all well.

I did not even know of this particular book and I am always glad to have anything of his. We were anxious to know if you arrived safely, and are very glad that all went well.

Fletcher's would be very good to melt or calcine, but it would do nothing more. The one I to~d you of is the thing. Get to understand all about furnaces for this purpose. Three such glorious sunny days we have had. I fear we may suffer by a change the other way next month. I have felt somewhat better yesterday and to-day, and Mrs Ayton is also better. It is still very uncertain whether we shall be in London for the [G.D.] Equinox [ceremony]. Chacombe Vicarage 19June 189 1 It is very good of you to think of us and invite us to your hospitable home for this memorable Convention, I at which we had fully intended to be present, but, on looking at the programme, we were appalled at seeing it went over 2 days,.and that it involved a lunch and dinner each day, and a late mght. The lunch and dinner are to be by contract, which means, of course, nothing fit to eat for anyone, and with our views of diet The Letters 63 and my peculiar susceptibility to certain articles, absolute poison. So, we have been in a state of great perturbation; on the one hand, an extreme desire to be present, and on the other a great fear of the mischief it might do me. We have both had Influenza tho' in a modified form, and I have only just recovered - could not do my Services on Sunday! I do not feel at all flourishing, and dread all locomotion. We had not absolutely decided, but as we must give an answer by the 25th inst., we shall probably write on the zath to say we cannot come. If we did happen to come, it would be very delightful staying with you, but the having to return to Chiswick at night after these meetings seems to us prohibitory. You young people do not mind it. When you get to our age, you will think differently. So, please excuse us if we do not accept your very kind invitation, tho' I should very much like a long talk with you. I have been much delayed in my experiments by illness. Thrice in 3 months in this year have I had gall-stone spasm, which left me very incapable, and now this confounded Influenza. Still, I have made some experiments with my furnace, which have at least opened my eyes to the extreme difficulty to what I am aiming at, and the almost certainty that I cannot complete it whilst my attention is divided and diverted by my position here. The very attempt to do it, and the failure teaches one something for the next attempt. The great difficulty is the graduated furnace. Gas would give much greater facility. In all probability we shall leave here next year. In the mean time I shall experimentalise all I can. When here you mentioned Mattei's medicines.' Since then Bro. Wilson put some evidence before me that made me think it is possible that when I tried them some years ago, I was furnished with spurious medicines. So I tried them again, and corresponded directly with the Count at Bologna. Not only did his medicines do me no good, but they did positive harm as when I tried them before. Upon mentioning this to him, I had an answer from his (supposed) son, very polite and very short, just changing one of the medicines, which was equally useless to my case. There was in the letter a something which seemed to convey to me the impression: \"I make money by the credulity of"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"64 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn mankind, and I suppose you to be one of them.\" My impression of them is confirmed by the experience of a Lady residing in France who tried them. She had a carbuncle on her leg, and Mattei's alter ego, the agent at Marseilles or Nice, I forget which, told her one of the remedies to apply to it. Instead of getting better, it got worse, till the appearance of it was so alarming,that she was obliged to call in the local Surgeon, who said that by neglect, gangrene had set in, and that he must cut it out immediately, or she would lose her leg. This shews the greatest ignorance on the part of Mattei. I have cured lots of cases of carbuncle, in the first stage, by applying either the old Balsam of Sulphur, or the more modern application of tannin, both of which cure it without cutting. This Lady's experience is just like mine. In a French paper sent me not long ago, I saw that a watch had been set upon him, and that no plants, as he pretends, ever entered his house, and various other things not at all to his credit. He may have discovered something, but upon this foundation he appears to me to have erected a super-structure of humbug which he finds very profitable. I shall not try him again. On the other hand, with Schussler's I have made most extraordinary cures. 1 Ayton did not refer to Madame Blavatsky's death on 8 May 1891 in any of his surviving letters to F. L. Gardner .. The. prospectively 'memorable convention' of the European Section of the Theosophical Society was due to meet on 9 July. See The Theosophical Movement 1875-1925 A History and a Survey (New York, 1925), chapters 18-20 for an account of contemporary T.S. politics and personalities. 2 Count Caesar Mattei (b. Bologna, Italy, 18Â°9; d. 3 April 1896) was the author of various works on 'elcctro-homoeopathy' such as Specifiques electro-homoeopathiques du Comte Mattei avec les indications necessaires pour la guerison de toutes les maladies et speaalement des maladies incurables (7th edition, Valence, Combier 1884).

The Letters 65 LETTER No. 33, of 22 June 1891\" needs a brief commentary. W. T. Stead (1849-1912) was an outstandingly able and energetic journalist who became editor of the Pall Mall Gazette in 1883. He soon gave the newspaper a reputation for courageous investigative reporting. Thus in July 1885 an article headed 'The Maiden Tribute to Modern Babylon' exposed the traffic in young girls. To obtain the evidence he nominally procured one (i.e., Eliza Jones) and was prosecuted and sentenced to three months in prison. However, as a result of his campaign Parliament raised the age of consent to sixteen. The story that W. E. Gladstone and his Liberal henchman Sir William Harcourt frequented a brothel in St John's Wood was nonsense and merely indicated that Ayton voted Conservative. It is unlikely that Ayton knew that Gladstone was privately interested in reforming prostitutes (see Joyce Marlow, Mr and Mrs Gladstone: An Intimate Biography, 1977). When H. P. Blavatsky's The Secret Doctrine was published in March 1889 Stead gave it to Annie Besant to review. He knew about her recent interest in Spiritualism and potentially occultism, although at this time she cannot have known much about the latter. Stead had met Madame Blavatsky but did not know her well. Fascinated by H.P.B.'s vast compendium of occult lore, Mrs Besant asked Stead for an introduction to her. When she first visited 17 Lansdowne Road in March 1889 she was accompanied by her younger friend Herbert Burrows. During the previous decade he had been prominent in a wide spectrum of radical groups (e.g., H. M. Hyndernan's pronouncedly Marxist Democratic Federation and the Fabian .Society) and had recently helped Annie Besant to form a trade union for the underpaid girls who made matches. Both joined the Theosophical Society in May 1889. Mrs Besant's 'conversion' attracted enormous publicity. She was by far H.P.B.'s most spectacular recruit, the more so since for many years she had been publicly associated with Charles Bradlaugh's National Secular Society, which preached agnosticism and birth control. It must be emphasized that Mrs Besant was a very public figure. Burrows was hardly known outside radical circles."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Private I have only just seen in Lucifer P.299 that one Herbert Burrows and A.B.

I daresay you recollect he was the hero in the Eliza Armstrong [i.e., Jones] case. As I understand it, the P.M. G. was on its last legs, and Stead in order to advertise it, and reinstate it in the good graces of the Public and increase its 66 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn Annie Besant was soon deeply involved in Theosophical Society business and by the summer of 1889 was practically running the Blavatsky Lodge. She became co-editor (with H.P.B.) of Lucifer in September 1889. Burrows was also active in T.S. affairs. By 1891 they considered themselves sufficiently expert in Theosophical doctrines to appear as co-authors of A Glossary of Theosophical Terms. Annie Besant was clearly destined to be H.P.B.'s successor as Theosophy's leading figure in Great Britain and even internationally, and this in fact happened after Blavatsky's death. However, her meteoric career in the international Theosophical movement was to be accompanied by a succession of internecine quarrels which are outside the scope of these notes. It is hardly surprising that Ayton knew little about Burrows or, indeed, that he informed Gardner that Annie Besant's manner to him was 'most ungracious and forbidding'. For many years past she had had minimal respect for Church of England clerics and was no doubt astonished to encounter one in Theosophical circles. It has been supposed that Burrows was a member of the Golden Dawn. This was not the case. However, he became a Freemason in 1902 when he joined East Anglia Lodge No. 2920 and joined Dr Westcott's Metropolitan College of the .Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia in July 1906. He was an Honorary 8Â° in the Soc.

Harcourt, who were notorious as frequenting a house of very ill fame in Stjohn's Wood. Stead was unconsciously going to expose 2 of the greatest friends of the B.B. They must have plied their usual wiley arts upon Stead, for, all at once, the P.M. G. changed its tactics and became a supporter of W.E.G. and Stead has been coquetting with the Pope ever since. Iri my eyes, it appears suspicious for A.B. and Burrows to have been introduced by Stead. As a rule, a man is known by the company he keeps, but, of course, this may be an exception and the introduction only a matter of accident, meaning nothing but a piece of formality. You will think me very suspicious, but I had so much trouble and annoyance from Dr A[rchibald] K[eightly], an avowed Papist being made President, and her also openly avowed intention to destroy the T[heosophical] S[ociety] if she could, that I cannot help being suspicious. Do you know anything of the antecedents of this Herbert Burrows? I am sure that one evening at No. 17 [Lansdowne Road], there was a young man, who, by his talk, must have been a Jesuit, and I was very nearly telling him so. Of course, the B.B. are doing their utmost to destroy the T.S., and are constantly sending spies there to pick up what they can. That Carter Blake is a most notorious B.B., and about 1880 got in, and was so evidently trying to give pernicious counsel to the T.S. that Colonel O[leott] kicked him out, and yet now I perceive he is put down as one of the Members. They may be quite sure he is doing all the mischief he can. If I had evidence that A[nnie] B[esant] was going to play the same game as Dr A[rchibald] K[eightly] I would denounce her at once. My suspicions may be all moonshine, but do please, just keep your weather eye open, and your ears too that we may know if there be anything wrong. I do not mean to take any trouble, or inconvenience yourself, but, when opportunity presents itself just inquire who Herb: Burrows is. I wish to goodness I could have come to the Convention, but I am anything but well, and it would not be advisable for me to leave home yet. The only two occasions on which I saw A.B., her manner to me was most ungracious and"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"68 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn forbidding.

This seemed to me so extremely improbable that I dismissed the thought, and laid it all to her manner, and thought she most likely was the same to every one. Now, I revert to the same idea. Most likely my suspicions are not worth a rap. Do not give yourself the trouble to answer this, but just bear in mind what I say, and take a quiet look-out. It does me good to let off steam when I get a suspicion into my head. In haste. When your letter came I was trying to finish copying a rare book which was lent me, and which the owner wants returned as soon as possible. I have finished to-day so I answer your letter. Since talking to Johnson [i.e., Charles Johnston?] about my intention to resign this [Living], the position has altered very much, and I find it most difficult to carry out my intention.

Before it was actually passed, the confounded Bps [i.e., Bishops] contrived to have it altered giving them the despotic power to ask all sorts of questions as to private income &c., &c., so as really to make the Act of none effect. I did not notice this at the time, and have been going upon the Act as it was first printed. My attention was drawn to the change by an unfortunate Clergyman, named John Ingle, Rector of St Olave's, Exeter, who, in a temporary illness, sent in to the Bp notice to resign under the Act. He got well, and then did not wish to resign, but the fact of his having sent in the Resignation Paper, gave the Bp power to declare the Rectory vacant, which the Bp did directly, and awarded him as retiring pension iod. per day. The Letters Your letter this morning. I have often been thinking of you, and wondering what you were doing. I have been better in health of late, but bothered much in Parochial matters, which hinder me much inmy experiments which I am working at every Chacombe Vicarage I September 1892 Now, there being an uncertainty about my getting a proper amount of retiring pension, if any, and the Bp having power to declare the Living vacant on my mere application to be allowed to retire, has made me hesitate for the present, as to giving up this house in this delightful country, and not having income enough to get one at all equal to it elsewhere. That is how the matter stands, but I am cudgelling my brain all ways to find a means of retiring, for we are too old for the cares and anxieties of this position. When we do leave, we want a warmer climate, and Hastings is our ambition. We were at St Leonard's this Summer on purpose to make inquiries, but found house-rent very high. As to Chiswick, it is near the Thames, and subject, I imagine, to fogs equally with London. A fog there is death to me. Also you seemed to me a long way from the Station. At your time of life that may be of no consequence, but when you arrive at our age, you will find your views altered. It would be very nice to be near you and able to have long talks and perhaps do a little work [i.e., Alchemy] together, but if one of these infernal fogs finished me off, it would not be of much use. Of all things we must have a warmer climate and free from London fogs. The books and MSS I have, give me [fully?] as much information as is necessary. The only thing is the practice. 1 am having made at Banbury by an Ironmonger there, Joachim Becher's portable furnace. The man is very stupid about it, and I am much afraid he will bungle it so as to make it useless, but I am determined to get it down [i.e., done] somehow. It gives me many a long walk to B. to put him right as he goes on, tho' it is now nearly finished, and I shall try it as soon as possible. 35 Chacombe Vicarage 25 November 1891 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Letters 70 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn opportunity. At this moment I have a B.M. going, which gives me a little leisure to write whilst it is going.

There is intimate connection between liver and kidneys. When I had obstruction of gall-duct by gall-stone and jaundiced bile passed thro' kidneys and bladder. There is reciprocal action between the 2 organs. You must not confound David Becker with John Joachim Becher. The work which mentions his portable furnace is \"Joh. Joach.

Anno M.DCCXIX.\" Becher was of the Jewish Nation, a man of the most extraordinary powers. This book is partly in Latin and partly in German. I should be very glad to look at books that were [the late Walter] Moseley's. How to get up to your place is the difficulty. Locomotion has become very distasteful to me. r should like much to have a talk with you. We are intending to be in London on Monday roth inst. to following Saturday morning, but our base of operations is in the W.e. district and we must be near it. You are only visible in evening, and then, there is the dreadful getting back at night. I must see you somehow, and then I will talk to you about head-quarters [of the T.S.?]. My Becher's furnace answers much better than I expected, and I have succeeded in one important process, and am now upon another. No one, who has not tried, can conceive the extreme difficulty and care required as to practical details. I am sure the proper way is to begin young, have a laboratory, and learn all the ways of subliming, precipitating, revivifying, &c &c &c. I know the theory now well enough, but the practical details bother me sorely with the many interruptions I have. Still, I might succeed at any time. I forgot that not long since this very book of Becher's was offered me by Siegle, as you will see by card inclosed. Siegle 7 1 forgot that he had procured it for me some time since. I wrote to a friend and told him of it, but I doubt whether he would get it, and Siegle might be able still to get it for you, if you care to have it. It reveals more than any book I know. There is a book sold by Philip Harris & Co., Nos. 144 & 14 6 Edmund St, Birmingham, Manufacturing Chemists, \"Bloxam's Laboratory teaching, 45. 6d.\" which, I think might give valuable practical hints and I wish I had got it sooner, and I think I shall do so now. We are glad to hear that you are all well at home. Mrs Ayton has not been quite well since the Influenza but she is much better now. If Cholera gets ahead in London we shall not come. I perceive you are Theosophically active at Chiswick. I I am too busy with my own particular line to do much else. 1 In its issue of February 1892 The Vahan, a Theosophical Society periodical, reported that the Chiswick Lodge of the T.S. had recently celebrated its first anniversary. F. L. Gardner was Hon. Secretary and Treasurer and the lodge met every Friday evening at 8 p.m. at his house at 37 Barrowgate Road. Gardner had resigned from these offices by 1894 and the lodge then met at Adyar Studio, 17 Flanders Road, Bedford Park. The Indian headquarters of the T.S. were at Adyar, near Madras.

What there is in Boerhaave is a kind of negative testimony. Although so able a Chemist in the ordinary sense, he had not the Occult perception in his Karma, and so opposes Alchemy, merely because he was unable to attain to it. Something beyond ordinary intelligence and skill is required to achieve success in that, and above all things - Silence. At p. 9 of Harris, there is a good description of the process of making ~ sublimate, which might be useful. Since my return I have been so occupied with Parochial and other matters, that I have not been able to find time to touch a [retort] or [crucible]. [Ayton drew small diagrams to illustrate the latter.] By this post I send you a copy of a Photograph of the Magnum Opus which I got from Vienna. I had some Photographs made of it, and, as you are one of the few who take an interest in the Divine art, be pleased to accept it. Take care as you undo it that you do not tear it. When the original came to me it was folded, and the mark of the folding has been reproduced in the Photograph. Wherefore, I put it on a roller to send. I have been going to send it for months, but being so very busy, I kept putting it off. I have not yet made out the smallest print in it for want of time. The whole process is there symbolically. Your letter stirred me up to send it. I abominate the B.B. [Iesuits], as you know, but, from my point of view, I should not waste my time in any controversy with or about them. At one time, I was always writing letters to the Papers. Now, the one thing needful appears to me to be to concentrate yourself upon the one thing of attaining to Adeptship of some sort. Olcott and others have said to me \"why I am glad you see what I perceived. The question is how to expel the foe [i.e., an Elemental].

Do not think I underestimate getting knowledge about their doings. In last week's P.O. was a quotation shewing that there are some Frenchmen who know that the B.B. were at the back of Boulanger. I I could see it all the time, but this is the first time I have seen it mentioned. They are plotting all the time. You say Elementals help you to books. If so, you are in a bad way. It is not Elementals who help us to books, but much higher powers. Unless you have attained to spiritual Adeptship so as to be able to command, to accept the services of Elementals is most dangerous, as they are sure to turn the tables on you, sooner or later, and you come to great grief. I fancy you, at one time, did too much of Spiritualism. Just as I took leave of your good wife, a something in the expression of her face struck me, upon which I have since reflected that probably she is vampired by an Elemental. You told me she was a Medium. Now, all Mediums are liable to be preyed upon by Elementals. I have known some dismal cases of it. You cannot be too careful in these matters. I had my Photograph mounted and framed to hang up to contemplate. Mrs Ayton joins me in wishing you both a very Happy New Year and success in x:xxx [i.e., Alchemy].

I was house-hunting most of the time, anticipating the giving up this [house] next year. We are both tolerably well I am glad to say. From your saying nothing I suppose you are both the same. There is nothing in the Cat: exactly answering to my w-ants. In fact, I am so occupied with the practical part [of Alchemy] that I can only read what is necessary for that. Tiffereau is a humbug! You mentioned having picked up Bekker's \"Opuscula chemica rariora\" and then come two more words I cannot read, and then you say \"Rusenstein's Commentary on it\". I do not know what you mean his Commentary to be on. I beg to congratulate you upon securing Opusc: rariora, but the Author of this is John Joachim Becher. A very different person is Daniel Becker or Beckher. If it be a commentary on J. J. Becher by Rusenstein, I should very much like to see it, if it be in any language I can read. I did not know of such a work of his. 4 0 Chacombe Vicarage 26 September 1893 F. L. GARDNER was initiated into the 0Â° = 0Â° or Neophyte grade of the Golden Dawn on 20 March 1894. Although the G.D. was nominally a secret society Ayton had long since disclosed that it existed (see the undated letter printed here as No. 14, p. 40). My hypothesis that Gardner had never been in any great hurry to join the G.D. is based upon the assumption that during H. P. Blavatsky's lifetime he had been satisfied with his membership of the Theosophical Society. It is clear, however, that after H.P.B.'s death he had little sympathy for the new dispensation under Annie Besant's leadership. Further- more, he had recently resigned from the office of secretary of the Chiswick Lodge of the T.S. and now had time to devote to the G.D. In 1894 Gardner was already acquainted with Dr W. W. Westcott, a co-founder of the G.D., and with Percy Bullock,' one of its most active members. Together with Gardner and John M. Watkins, who had recently established himself as a bookseller, they founded the Theosophical Society's Ananda Lodge in November 1893. It was disbanded in November 1895, probably because they all disliked Annie Besant. Hence it was Westcott and Bullock rather than Ayton who brought Gardner into the GD."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn Chacombe Vicarage 3 April 18 94 Care Frater [Gardner], So we of the G[olden] D[awn] address one another, and sign by our Motto or a part of it. I beg to congratulate you on having become one of us. There are many advantages, which it is as well not to put on paper. We could not be present this Equinox, for, Easter fell most awkwardly, and moreover, my Churchwar- den was and is most seriously ill, and my absence might have been taken amiss. When I shall be in London I do not know, but we are preparing for a flit as soon as we can arrange it. In this we have been much impeded by our Squire who begged me to delay it till he could try to effect certain purposes of his own. You do not say that your good wife is also a Member of the G.D. Some of our Lady Members are the most advanced. One of Jewish extraction is, I think, the most advanced of all.' It is a thing to be worked together, husband and wife especially. ' I have told you I have a Jewish learned friend who was very advanced tho' he never would belong to any Order or Society.' I naturally concluded he had arrived at a communication with higher Intelligences and the Powers of Nature by the rules of the Qabbalah. The last time I saw him. I alluded to this, and he astonished me by saying he had never put those rules into practice at all, but that everything came to him naturally. People in general have no idea of what gifted men, the best of Jews are. \"Quam potero\" [Ayton's wife] is as well as usual and so am I. I Percy William Bullock (1868-194Â°) was then a clerk in the employment of Slaughter and May, a firm of solicitors in the City of London. In 1898 he was articled to W. C. Slaughter and his first Practising Certificate was dated 26 January 1904. He disappeared from the G.D. milieu C.1903. 2 Gardner's wife was never a member of the G.D. The 'lady member of Jewish extraction' was Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers's wife Moina. 3 The Jewish learned friend was undoubtedly Julius Kohn. See Letter No. 42. The Letters 77 THE N EXT letter (No. 42) is not in the Yorke Collection but was once in the possession of Mr R. A. Gilbert. It was to Julius Kohn, 'the Jewish learned friend' mentioned in No. 41. In the meantime Ayton, who was close to his 79th birthday, had retired from his living at Chacombe and had moved to West Hoathly, a village 4 V2 miles from East Grinstead in Surrey. It has not been possible to discover anything about Kohn's life, but in the Introduction to his translation of The Prophecies of Pa race/s us: Magic Figures and Prognostications (1915),1 he mentioned that his 'studies in the Occult ... have now extended over forty years', which suggests that he began them c. 187Â°-5. Thus I assume that he was born c. 1850. According to a letter to myself from Mr Gilbert: 'He also wrote an article \"The Adeptship of Jesus Christ\" which appeared in The Medium and Daybreak, 2 September 1881, P.556. This, and other papers, brought a violent response from The Theosophist in October and November 1881. Kohn had attacked Theosophy with gusto - bringing Paracelsus to his aid.' In his 'Hermetica' catalogue No. 25 (Summer 1981) Mr Gilbert described Kohn as an Austrian emigre. In this catalogue Mr Gilbert listed seven of Kohn's alchemical manuscripts. There was evidently a traffic in such manuscripts between Ayton, Kohn and Percy Bullock ('Levavi Oculos' in the Golden Dawn). Thus Kohn's copy of 'Oeuvre de Jean Saulnier a son fils' was described as 'Gardner's MS. copied from Ayton's copy'. Ayton made his copy in September 1903 and sent it to Bullock who, with the exception of Ayton and Gardner, was the GD's most energetic copyist of alchemical manuscripts. Rosebank, West Hoathly, East Grinstead 2 February 1895 My dear Kohn, By this post I shall forward to you vol. i, i.e., really vol. vi of the Fr[ench] MS.2 I was delayed copying it by Bronchitis, or you would have had it a fortnight sooner. I told you I felt Bronchitis coming on, &, in fact, was so ill as not to be capable of writing properly. I had to take to my bed for several days & got over it. I"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"account of the expense of the longer process. I am also anxious to know, ifby any chance you have the other 5 vols. If not, and if by any further chance you happen to perceive who this anonymous author is, we might institute a search abroad. Anyhow, you will know the handwriting and look out for the others. Mynsicht was a Rosi Tan and it has occurred to me whether the original of this MS was not a private affair of the Order, and surreptitiously got hold of by some one out of the Order and copied. All other MS[S] and books on the subject make use of sublimated mercury, antimony and iron, but this Adept seems to use. separately the sophie mercury or soul of each, and this may be the best way. I shall soon copy the other vol. if I keep well, and will send it to you. It is about 30PP. shorter. It contains the process in detail for making the sophie mercury and oil of gold wh[ich] I have nowhere else seen. I cannot imagine such an MS being intended for any but the eyes of members of an Occult Order. Why it should come to such a miserable wretch as myself is curious. You may suppose that the Medical part interests me. According to modern lights he is wrong in some of the particulars of his Physiology, but he has a very good general idea of it. The cures he declares himself to have made, seem incredible, but experience alone could tell us whether it is possible. I suppose Paracelsus did quite as much. This part I care for more than the transmutation. This spell of horribly. cold weather prevents me from doing anything practical. I am obliged to be so careful not to get Bronchitis again. I can employ the time profitably in copying the second vol. of this MS and by the time I have finished it, I hope it will be warmer and allow me to get to work. Your vast reading and general knowledge may cause you to value this MS less than I do. If you do not care for it I shall be glad to have it again. Mrs Ayton joins me in kind regards to you both, and hoping you keep well this trying weather. 78 The Alchemist of the Colden Dawn went out & seemed all right. Suddenly it came on again, & I had to take my bed for a longer period. I perceive what gives it me. The fireplaces are so badly constructed that either they give out too little heat, or else too much. When it is the latter, I get into a lather just before bedtime perhaps, then go into my cold dressing-room, & take a chill at once. No one knows nowadays how to make a fire-place. I shall be more careful in future now that I know the evils of the house. We have a fire in the bedroom now, so as to avoid the great contrast between an over-heated room & an icy cold one. I am convalescent again, & I hope to keep it so. I thought it better to send you vol. I at once, for I am really very anxious to have your views upon it. The spelling, grammar & punctuation of the French are all infamous, but you must not . let that prejudice you against it. I have come to the conclusion that the Adept who enuntiated it employed a scribe to do the writing. The internal evidence of it seems to me to show that, probably, the Adept was not a native of France, but a German domiciled there, & that he probably employed a German Scribe to write to his dictation, that this scribe knew nothing of occultism, for he does not use the Alchemical Symbols, & the mistakes are just such as a Scribe imperfectly acquainted with French, would make, writing the words more according to the sound of them as his master uttered them, than according to the orthography and grammar. However, I long to know what you think of it. I have more carefully compared the Process given with that of Mynsicht's 'Unicorno Milnerale' at p.r of his 'Thesaurus & Armentium Medico-Chymicum' and also 'Tinctura Veneris & Martis ex scriptis Fratris Basilii Valentini in unum processum collecta', at P.73 of Rhenanus' 'Solis e puteo emergentis'. I feel as sure as one can be about anything that it is the same process given in all its details wh[ich] were concealed in Mynsicht and B.V. Supposing this to be the case, I do not see the sense of your reading from the first Greek and other authors as you said, but that your course is to make yourself fully Master by memory of all the details of this Process, so as to be sure of not making a mistake, choosing the first 'Proces accuratoire' to work upon, on The Letters 79"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"I This book (I 28pp) was published by William Rider and Son Ltd.

A YEAR AFTER being initiated in the Golden Dawn's lowest 0Â° = 0Â° degree and after passing a series of examinations Gardner reached the GD.'s Second Order (Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis) and joined its select coterie of Ritual Magicians. Gardner's subsequent unsatisfactory career in the G.D. is commemorated in my The Magicians of the Golden Dawn. Ayton was wrong in supposing that the G.D. had existed from time immemorial. It was a very recent (1888) foundation. The suggestion that Gardner could now use his room 'for all sorts of experiences' implies that he could practise certain rituals, such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, without the participation of other Adepts. This esoteric exercise is apparently not without its therapeutic effects. In 'Suster's answer to Howe', a hostile chapter contributed to Israel Regardie's What )IOU should know about the Colden Dawn (Falcon Press, Phoenix, Arizona, USA, 1983), Mr Gerald Suster wrote: 'Anyone who doubts this should try performing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram daily for six months - it will occupy less than ten minutes a dav. I have done this myself and experienced improvement on everv level of my life. Mr Howe would be well advised to go and do \"likewise, but it is doubtful if he will for he thinks he knows better.'

Moreover, it is an Order that has existed from time immemorial, and included such Adepts as Hadrian Mynsight, Eugenius Philalethes, Sigismund Back- strom, and a host of others. We must, however, never forget that the T.S. has a peculiar Mission for this \"Fin de Siecle\" and Englan? and India in particular. The TS. teaches generally and th~oret~cally for the most part, tho' there are some practical pomts In the S.D. [i.e., H. P.

[i.e., the Jesuits] are most active and have developed a most elaborate and perfect scheme for the destruction of British power and influence, and it is so far successful, and they may get the upper hand temporarily. I believe that it is this which the Mahatmas are trying to provide against. I am thoroughly convinced the B.B. have somehow got at Judge, in or?er tO,destroy the TS ..

The B.B. have failed all along the line, and, I believe, will fail in this. It is the same in politics. My own strong impression is, that Rosebery, Harcourt and the rest are all concealed Papists. Ripon is avowedly so. It is a heavy blow and great discouragement to Harcourt to be turned out of Derby. It is not likely that Harcourt himself really believes in Local Veto, but he knows that Publicans exercise a great influence upon a wide circle of Voters, and that on the Unionist side, and so they want to swamp and get rid of them. It is the same with the House of Lords, which prevents them forcing Rome Rule down our throats, that they may make Popery predominant, and destroy the great Protestant Empire of England.

The London members now became embroiled in a major row with MacGregor Mathers. To make matters worse a Mr and Mrs Horos appeared at Mathers's home in Paris at about the same time. They were American confidence tricksters and succeeded in purloining a copy of the G.D. Neophyte ritual. In September 1901 Mr Horos w~s arrested in London on a charge of raping a young girl and his wife was accused of aiding and abetting him. Much to the distress of Ayton and others extracts from the Neophyte ritual and the text of the G.D.'s Obligation were read at the magistrate's court proceedings and there was extensive press publicity. Many of the G.D.'s members res~gne~ after the Horos couple were sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment.

I was trying to work this at Chacombe, but interruptions and troubles came which made me partly forget it. Perhaps you may have missed seeing this. There was a droll, tho', in one sense, a serious incident here a few days since. Sanger's Circus came and pitched itself on the Common which my house overlooks. There was an Elephant who did wonderful and amusing feats. When the performance was over and all gone to bed, he broke loose, sallied out, went to a farm-yard on the N. side of the common, lifted the gate off its hinges, carried it off for a % mile, returned to the entrance he had effected, broke down part of a barn, and helped himself largely to a quantity of barley which had been thrashed out that very day. The serious part is that the damage is between Â£50 and Â£60 and the Farmer is a poor man. I suppose he will recover it off Sangers who are credited with being very rich. Perhaps the Elephant thought they har' .1Ot given him enough supper. 101 Grove Lodge, Saffron Walden II November 1901 The Letters 66 Grove Lodge, Saffron Walden 17 October 190 1 65"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"I think you must be misunderstanding my position in the G.D.

In consequence, I suppose, of this irregular- ity, some of the MSS were not sent to me, as they ought to have been, but I have the [illegible] of Enoch, the Clavis Tabularum Enochi, Consecration Ceremony, [illegible] Chameleonis, parts of Ritual Z. &c. From my possessing these, it is evident that I was entitled to the whole of them, but, thro' some inadvertence they were not sent to me. I feel sure S.A. [Westcott] would have ordered them to be sent to me, if I had asked for them, but I went off on another track [i.e., Alchemy] which is a legitimate part of Rosicrucianism, the Chemical [i.e., Alchemy], and neglected to ask for them. As you were so long at Bournemouth I applied again at head-quarters, and was told the MSS were not there, but in some one's hands to be revised. This is the real reason I cannot have them, and revision is a long process. I should not have thought of asking you for them, if I had not a right to them. The T. Enochian Calls, I more especially want immediately, and I still hope you will be kind enough to send me them. The G.D. is now so disorganised that the Obligation practically ceases to be binding. The Horos case has given it its death-blow, not so much from the Public Trial, as from the fact that the Ritual and the knowledge MSS are not only in the hands of the Police but also have been printed by the Editor of . \"Wings of Truth' to whom, I suppose, they had been previously sold.

For the Fratres Lucis, the Order of Light and the Sat B'hai see my 'Fringe Masonry in England, 187Â°-85' in Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vo1.85 for 1972. Lord Lindsay (1847-1913), who succeeded to the Earldom of Crauford and Balcarres in 188o, was never a member of the Sat B'hai, He had more sense! Ayton joined it in May 1883 but was admitted without payment of any fee. His Obligation form is illustrated opposite. Grove Lodge, Saffron Walden 18 January 19Â°2 My idea is that the Fratres Lucis and the Order of Light are one and the same. I Portman left this Order in my hands, and I think I can say positvely that U ohn] Yarker and Lord Lindsay were not in it. Tis true Portman at Yarker's request, allowed me to let Yarker see the Ritual and copy it, but nothing further. 2 I think probably you are mixing up the Order of the 'Sat B'hai' (7 brethren) with the Order of Light. Yarker and Kenneth Mackenzie instituted this. Then they quarrelled, and each went on with it in their own way. It was said that Yarker quarrels with every one. I have had much correspondence with him and found him very pleasant and learned, and very intelligent, tho' he worked much at ordinary Spiritualism. To the best of my recollection, the Ritual of the Sat Bhai is so complicated, that it would require an Indian Temple to carry it out thoroughly. It is very likely that (the late) Lord Lindsay as well as Yarker, was in it, but I have no cognisance of it. I keep quite free from Bronchitis here, and am very busy so write in haste. 1 They were not. The Fratres Lucis existed mainly in F. G. Irwin's imagination, even if he managed to recruit a few (half a dozen?) carefully selected initiates. 2 Yarker clearly copied the ritual and handed the Order to some friends in the Bradford area. It still exists obscurely today."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"1Â°4 The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn The Letters 1Â°5 A YT 0 N continued to invent myths. Lord Lindsay was not initiated on the Continent but at Cambridge when still an undergraduate in 1866. The fact that he later became a Senior Grand Warden in the United Grand Lodge of England and Deputy Provincial Grand Master for West Lancashire and a Provincial Grand Master for Aberdeen West merely indicates that noblemen were then almost automatically promoted to very senior offices. I have not been able to identify any specially 'Occult Lodge' in England and doubt whether anything of the kind existed. For Frederick Hockley see John Hamill's forthcoming study The Rosicrucian Seer (Aquarian Press, 1986). Zanoni (1842), a novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, was said to be a 'Rosicrucian' novel and was once greatly admired by occultists although for what reason I cannot fathom. You have asked me a question, which, I fear I am not competent to answer fully. I knew the late Lord Lindsay most by a book published by him, entitled \"Progression by Antagonism\", a very Philosophical work, shewing great learning and acquaintance generally with Occultism. I have not read it for years, and unfortunately I cannot lay my hands on it to refresh my memory. My impression of what I do recollect of it, is, that he had been initiated on the Continent, as so many of our Nobility were at the beginning of last century, especially Scotch Noblemen. I do not think there was any opportunity for him to work practically at any Occult Lodge in England. The late Fredk. Hockley was about the only man doing anything in that line, and his was only with a Magic Mirror and a Clairvoyante. He has told me that often he has had Noblemen come to him to work with him and his Magic Mirror. If there had been anything higher than that going, Hockley would have been in it, and in the conversations I have had with him, he would have told me of what was going on in that way. He knew the original of Glyndon in \"Zanoni\", who was living at Highgate, I think. The late Ld The Revd W. A.

You only give Mylius' \"Anatomia Auri\" &c. In Dufresney's \"Philosophic Hermetique\" he gives \"Opus Medico-Chymicum\" &c. and also \"Philosophia Reformata\" as being by Mylius. I am at work copyingJean Saulnier, and shall send off another 30 pages to L.O.

I should say that his working, if any, was on the Continent. In his said book he makes some strictures on Occultism. The G.D., according to what little I hear, is practically in the hands of the B.B. [the Jesuits] who have worked on their old principle of \"Divide et impera\", and have succeeded in breaking it up, which is always their aim with Occult Orders. The wish to keep it on is not sincere on the part of at least one. It is only a blind to keep it in the hands of the B.B. Be careful as to Bronchitis. I am glad you are getting over it. Here, I have not had a trace of it as yet, and I go out in all weathers. Grove Lodge, Saffron Walden 24June 1903 The Letters 1Â°7 You are quite right to take every precaution for this MS being returned to you in case of anything happening to me. I have ventured to make a slight alteration, as my acting Executor would know nothing about MSS, and might mislay the Memorandum or forget it, which would make it much safer. I will ask my Solicitor to place my instructions to him about it with my Will. Perkins is not only my Solicitor but a personal friend, and will, I know, carry out my instructions to the letter. The rest of what you wished I have embodied as exactly as possible in the accompanying document. If you wish any alteration made, just write it in to it, return it to me, and I will recopy it and send it to you. As an Occultist I am at one with you as to the rule of safeguarding all valuable MSS &c. from the profane. If what I have written meets with your approval, I shall be glad to have the MS as soon as it is convenient to you to send it, that I may begin on it at once. Grove Lodge, Saffron Walden 10 March 19Â°4 I send you the MS formerly in the possession of d'Espagnet. I kept it till I should have my copy of it returned by L[evavi] O[culos: i.e., Percy Bullock] to read as I had not attended to it much in copying it. L.O. has not sent me my copy yet, he has been too busy in preparing for his avocation. I was expecting mine to be returned much sooner. Some parts of the MS are, as I think, valueless and I did not copy them. I am glad that Mrs Gardner and yourself are well, tho' the weather has been abominable and seems likely to continue so. I am only moderately well and cannot walk as I used to do. Yet I do get out every fine day. I do hope England will not be dragged into this Jap-Russ war. The Jesuits are behind it all.

The supposed great power seems likely to turn out to have been a big bubble, which having become too large, bursts. If so, it will make a great difference, a great bully having been removed. There is a noted person coming to reside at Lord Braybrook's princely mansion at Audley End close to Saffron Walden. It is Lord Howard de Walden, whose yearly income is reported to be Â£200,000. His age is just 26 years. He has leased Audley End for seven years. Charles II resided for some time at Audley End, and at Newport, a few miles off, lived his mistress, Nell Gwynne. The house she inhabited is still there. I have the (so-called) Tables of Rotalo, which I obtained at your instigation in 190 I, but, as then you pronounced against it, as you will see by your letter of that date now inclosed, which I found in the MS, I do not see what use it can be to you. I have never given any sustained attention to it, being otherwise much engaged. I do not know anyone who has anything else upon the subject. There is a bare possibility that there might be some account of it in Harmsworth's Cyclopaedia, as there are some allusions to the Occult in that, but it is very unlikely. There is a book you ought to read, if you have not, entitled \"The Law of Psychic Phenomena: a working Hypothesis, &c. &c. by Thomson Jay Hudson, ninth impression. London: G. E. Putnam's Sons. 1905.\" It will cause a great stir in the U.S., where it was first published. It is remarkable, tho' my long experience makes me think he has made some errors. In the September No. of \"Chamber's Journal\" there is a very curious story told by Commander Chambers of a most romantic adventure of a Naval Officer named Anson, entitled \"The Past, the Present, and the Future\". The Occult comes in as a part of it. Anson says the first 2 have come to pass, and he is sure the jrd will, but as that involves a war with Germany and England, it is difficult to believe it. However, the Kaiser is as mad as a hatter, and there is no knowing what folly a mad man may commit. There seems to be some evidence that the Jesuits have got hold of him, and, of course, they would like to bring on a war which would cripple one or both of the great Protestant Powers. Thanks for inquiries as to my health. I have not been at all well. My old complaint has troubled me much, and I am in my oorh year. THE LETTERS now come to an end. There may have been more, but in view of Gardner's hoarding instincts this seems unlikely. Correspondence was not absolutely necessary because at that time Saffron Walden could be reached by rail from London and I imagine that Gardner, Percy Bullock and Julius Kohn would have made occasional visits. By 19Â°3 the Golden Dawn had ceased to exist in its original form. A. E. Waite had gained control of what he called the 'Independent Branch of the Order' - in fact what remained of the membership of the Isis-Urania Temple - and co-opted Ayton as a co-Chief, 'he being the senior Adept among us'.' Living a secluded life in the country he continued to copy alchemical manuscripts and to allow Gardner, Bullock and Kohn to make their own transcriptions. W. B. Yeats certainly had recent news of him when he wrote to Lady Gregory on 20 January 1902. He mentioned that 'my alchemist is very anxious to have a look at that magic book of Robert's. He says that it is really valuable. Can you bring it when you come? He has just made what he hopes is the Elixir of Life. If the rabbit on whom he is trying it survives we are all to drink a noggin full - at least all of us whose longevity he feels he could encourage.\" However, the rabbit died. Ayton published one book. There is no copy of The Life of John Dee, translated from the Latin of Dr Thomas Smith (Theosophical Publishing Society, 1908) either in the British Library or the Library of Congress. For the rest, a small number of his copies of old alchemical manuscripts are now scattered in various collections.
