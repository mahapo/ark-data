[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Historic Lecture - Golden Dawn by V.H. Frater Sapere Aude (Dr. W. Wynn Westcott) The Order of the G.D. in the Oute r is a Hermetic Society whose memb ers are taught the principles of Occult Science and the Magic of Hermes. During the early part of the second half of the 19th Century, several adepti and chiefs of this order in France and England died, and their deaths caused a temporarily dormant condition of Temple work. Prominent among these were Eliphas Levi, Ragon, Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie, author of the Masoni c Encyclopedia and Frederick Hockley, possessed of crystal vision whose M.S.S. we highly esteeme d. These and other adepti received their knowledge and power from predecessors of greater imminence and have hande d down to us this doctrine and system of Theosophy and Hermetic Science of th e Higher Alchemy from a series of practical investigations whose origin is traced to the Frat res Rosae Crucis of Germany, which association was founded by Christian Rosenkreuz about 1398. He and the theologian, Valent ine Andrea, have left us, in the works published about 1614, an account of the exoteric arrangements of the Rosicr ucian Society. It seems likely it was Andrea who p ublished in 1614 the Fama Fraternitatis, or Theo ry of the Society, which must have been derive d from the old records of the pupils of Christian Rose nkrawz. But even this arrival of mysticism was a new development of the older wis dom of the Qabalistic Rabbis a nd of that very ancient secret knowledge of the magic of the Egyptians into wh ich Moses had been initiated. Through the Qabalah, indeed, Europe became possessed of the ancient Wisdom more than from any one other source, fo r the Hebrews were taught at one time by the E gyptians and later by the Chaldees of Babylon. It is a curious fact that the classic nations, the Gr eeks and Romans, have handed down to us but slight glimpses of the Ancient Magic, and this is more notabl e because Greece succeeded to the mastership of Egypt, and Rome to the Empire of both the Gr eeks and Jews. Greece did indee d succeed to a share in the mysteries of the Egyptians for the Eleusinian Mysteries were copies of the ancient ceremonies of Isis, Osiris and Serapis; but they lacked true magic. And further, the classic writings contain but faint glimpses of even the Eleusinian Mysteries, and these disclose the fact that the pupils were partly ignorant of th e true mysteries, a notable exampl e of which is seen in the use o f the words Konx Om Pax, of which they knew not the meaning, the words being the Greek imitation or translation of really ancient Egyptian words, whose meanings has been kept secret for centuries. Hence the 0=0 Grade is found to possess Egyptian characteristics and symbolism and the Highe r Grades will reveal the source of much of the cu lture and illustrate the language of Eliphas Levi, through whose adeptship the study of occultism has been popularized. The First Order is a group of f our grades of which Neophytes ar e admissible when approved by the G.H. Chiefs after showing themselves possessed of sufficient aptitude and knowledge. Beyond the above, there are three grades of Adeptship forming th e Second Order . These have the power o f selecting Candidates, initiating stude nts into the lower grades and their Chiefs have, in addition, the p ower of issuing warrants of Temples such as that of Isis Urania. But the highest of all in this ancient scheme are the Great Rulers of the whole system who severally sustain a nd govern the Third Order, which includes three Magic Titles of Honor and S upremacy. These represen t the Supernal Triad o f the Sephiroth and are shrouded and unapproachable to the profane and to all others but the Chiefs o f the Adepts. In case of a vacancy in this Order, the Chief most learned Adept obtains by decree the well-earned award. The scheme of the G.D. then is formed upon th e type of the Decad of the Sephiroth, the ten Emanations of Deity as figured in the Qabala h whose professors were illuminated by the highe r ma g ic of the ancient world. The g rades of the First Order will be found to be Hebrew in desi g n and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"tendency; and inasmuch as the infl ux of time brought on th e revelation of the Christos, the Tiphareth, the Beauty of Microprosopos, Christian desi gn is reflected in the higher degrees. The Neophyte Grade and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Grad es, which this present Isis Urania Temple is authorized to confer after due examination and approval, posses r ituals and secrets which have been received from the G.H. Chief adepts and these are placed in our hands to use in the tuition of pupils in the ancient methods of this Or der. This Temple (Isis Urania) was consecrated as a successor to Hermanubis No. 2 which had ceased to exist owing to the death of all its Chiefs. The Temple No. 1 of Licht, Liebe, Libra is a group of Continental my stics who have not been in the habit of performing ceremonies in open lodge, but have conferred the grades chiefly in privacy an d in the presence of two or three memb ers, so there is no a ccurate record of name and rank of all these members. Soon after the formation of Temple N o. 3, permission was granted for the consecration o f Osiris Temple No. 4 at Weston-S uper-Mare under rule of V.H. Frat er \"Crux dat Salubrem\" and the West of England has been assigned to him as a province. Almost at the same time, the Horus Temple N o. 5 under the rule of V.H. Fratre \"Vote Vita Mea\" was also consec rated at Bredford in Yorkshire. These three Temples have members also in the Un ited States, Hindustan, Palestine, Denmark, etc. The name of the Order in various languages is: In Hebrew: Morning Light Shining Society (Cha brath (or Chaorah) Zoreh Aour Bakker) which means The Society of the Shining Light of Dawn. In Latin: Aurora. In German: Die Goldene Demmerung. In French: L'Aube d' Or√Ü. Reference may now be made to the Society which was reconstruc ted by Robert Wentworth Little, student of the mysteries. This Society, which has branches in England, Scotland and the Unite d States, is allied with the G.D. It perpetuated one form of Rosicr ucian initiation which was conferre d 100 years ago in England and which was menti oned by Godfrey Higgin s in his work The Anacalypsis, or an Attempt to Wit hdraw the Veil of the Saitic Isis. Fr atre Little was a student of the school of Levi and also an eminent Freemason, a nd the Rosicrucian Societ y as revised by him was made by intention and permission essentially masonic, thus seve ring all connection with those Adepts who have not been Craftsmen, as Basil Valentine, Artephus, Nico las Flamel, Jacob Behmen and Robert Fludd. The Rosicrucian Society in the same manner fa ils to recognize any worth fo r occult research in women. This is also an innovation or the scheme of the Ancient Mysteries in many of which, notably those of Isis priestesses and virgin prophetesses, were prominent ministers. N ote specifically, that there are seve ral instances in the ancient M.S. of our Order, which are written in cypher, where reference is made to the fratres and sorores, the words \"her or him\" occur showing that in olden time, as at the present day, wome n rose to high rank and attainment in the secret knowledge of the Order. Mention ma y be suitably made to Pernelle , the wife and fellow-worker o f N icolas Flamel, of Martine Berthe reau, companion of Baron Jean de Chatelet who died about 1645 and of the widow lady afterwards symbolized by him as Sophia (Heavenly Wisdom), fellow student and inspirer of John Georg Gichte l who died about 1700. The occultists of today can not need to be reminded of the great Hermetists and Theosophists of recent times: of D. Anna Kingsford, who was indeed illuminated by the Sun of Li ght; of Madame Blavatsky, leader of the T.S. No occult student, however wide apart his own favored path of wisdom , could fail to recognize in her a master mind in a woman's frame. I cannot fail to express the lame nt which followed the passing of D. William Robert Woodman, fo r many years known as the supreme Magus of the Society Ros. in Anglia which is exoteric in its oute r grades but whose concerns are regul ated by an inner circle of adepti who still hold the secrets of the R.:. C.:. and its masonic societ y ."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The eastern school of Theosophy and Occultism a nd our own Hermetic Society of the G.D. are fraternities of students whose predecessors must have come from the same stock of magi as the scientific priests of a remote antiquity. The two Societies, diffe rent in modes of teaching and in language, are allied by mutual understanding and respec t, and their aim is si milar.
