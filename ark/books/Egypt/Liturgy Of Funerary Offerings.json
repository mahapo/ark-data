This is known as the \"Book of the Opening of the Mouth\". The ritual consisted of offering a long sequence of foodstuffs, beverages, cosmetics and other consumables, along with a litany recited by the priests. This text was also painted on the walls of the royal tomb. This recitation may be tedious and repetitous, but there is a reason that I've gone to the trouble of creating an etext of this book.

Next: Preface"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next p. vii PREFACE THE present volume contains the Egyptian text and English translations of two copies of one of the most, important documents connected with the dead which have come down to us, namely, a detailed list of the offerings which were made to the dead, and also of the consecrating formulae which were recited by the chief officiating priest, as he presented them to a mummified body, or to a statue of the deceased. The ancient title of the composition, if it ever had one in early days, is unknown to us, but it has been called the \"Liturgy of Funerary Offerings,\" because the document deals exclusively with the presentation of offerings to the dead, and because this title is convenient for reference. This Liturgy is associated in the funerary texts in the tombs and papyri with another work entitled the \"Book of Opening the Mouth\" and this fact suggests that it is a portion of or a supplement to it, and that it is a development of the canonical List of Offerings which we have reason to believe was in existence under the IIIrd or IVth Dynasty. We know that funerary chapels were attached to the. pyramids and mastaba tombs of this period, and that offerings of meat and drink were made in them to the dead daily p. viii by properly qualified priests. It follows as a matter of course that the proceedings of the priests were regulated by some system, and that some kind of written service must have been recited regularly, and we are justified in believing that the Liturgy of Funerary Offerings was that which was commonly said for kings and other royal personages, and for men of high civil and ecclesiastical rank. In the case of the \"Book of Opening the Mouth\" the object of the recital was, in the earliest times at least, to bring about the reconstitution and resurrection of the dead man, and even in later times, when the work was recited before a statue, on which the accompanying ceremonies were performed, the idea of the Egyptians on this matter remained unchanged. It must be remembered also that the Egyptians intended by means of ceremonies and formulae to bring back the Ka, or double, either to the dead man, from whom it had been temporarily separated, or to a statue which represented him; and when this had been done they believed it to be their bounden duty to provide meat and drink for its maintenance. It was the Ka and the heart-soul (Ba), not the spirit-soul (Khu), which fed upon the offerings, and if meat and drink of a suitable character, and in sufficient quantity, were not provided for them, these suffered from hunger and thirst, and if the supply of offerings failed, they perished by starvation. The texts make it quite clear that the Egyptians believed in a dual-soul; one member could not die, but p. ix the other only lived as long as it was fed with offerings by the living and provided with an abode, i.e., a statue. Offerings were brought to the funerary chapels and tombs daily, and additional gifts were presented on the days of all great festivals. In very primitive times offerings of meat and drink were brought to the graves, and laid there for the souls of the dead to partake of at pleasure, just as is the case at the present day in -many places in the Sudan. When the ceremonies connected with the Book of Opening the Mouth were evolved, it became customary for the offerings to be brought forward at a certain place in the service, and afterwards, little by little, the canonical List of Offerings, and its later development, the Liturgy of Funerary Offerings, came into being. As in the Book of Opening the Mouth the words spoken by the Kher-heb, or chief officiating priest,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"were believed to change the meat, and bread, and wine into divine substances, so in the Liturgy also the formula which was said over each element was supposed to change it into a divine and spiritual food, which was partaken of by the souls of the gods and of the dead. The material elements of the offerings were eaten by the priests and the relatives of the dead, and the act of eating brought them into communion with the blessed dead, and with the gods. The age of the belief in the transmutation of offerings cannot be stated, but it is certain that it was well known to the Egyptians under the Vth Dynasty, and there is reason p. x to think that it was not unknown to their ancestors in the latter part of the Neolithic Period, and that it is coeval with the indigenous African belief in the immortality of the soul, and in a life beyond the grave. The life of the Liturgy of Funerary Offerings was long. It is found in a more or less complete form in many mastaba tombs of the Ancient Empire, in a very complete form in the pyramids of Unas and Pepi II., in incomplete forms on sarcophagi and in tombs of the XIIth Dynasty, and in the tomb of Seti I. of the XIXth Dynasty, and in complete forms in the tomb of Peta-Amen-hp of the XXVIth Dynasty and in papyri written in the first or second century of the Christian Era. The changes textually in the complete copies of the different periods are very few, and we may say that this work was used by generation after generation, in a practically unaltered form, for about four thousand years. A description of the labours of my predecessors on this important text will be found in the introductory matter to the present volume. E. A. WALLIS BUDGE. BRITISH MUSEUM, August 5th , 1909.

THE DOCTRINE OF OFFERINGS. THE tombs, temples, and religious literature of all periods of the history of Egypt proclaim with no uncertain voice that the ancient Egyptians believed in the resurrection of the dead, and that they possessed an innate conviction that the souls of the blessed renewed their existence in the world beyond the grave under circumstances and conditions which gave them happiness and prevented them from dying a second time. The consistent, persistent, ineradicable and unalterable belief in immortality is the chief fundamental of the Egyptian Religion, and the attainment of everlasting life was the end to which every religious ceremony was performed, and every funerary text written. Now, although in the Dynastic Period the Egyptians p. 2 believed that the dead rose again because Osiris rose from the dead, and that it was indeed he \"who made mortals to be born again,\" 1 and who bestowed upon the \"re-born\" new life, with new powers, spiritual, mental, and material, they spared no pains in performing the works which they thought would help themselves and their dead to put on immortality and to arrive in the dominions of him who was the \"king of eternity and the lord of everlastingness.\" Every tradition which existed concerning the ceremonies that were performed on behalf of the dead Osiris by Horus and his \"sons\" and \"followers\" at some period, which even so far back as the time, of the IVth Dynasty, or about B.C. 3800, was extremely remote, was carefully preserved and faithfully imitated under succeeding dynasties, and for long after Christianity was established in the northern part of the Nile Valley, and Egypt was filled with Christian monks. The formulae which were declared to have been recited during the performance of such ceremonies were written down and copied for scores of generations, and every pious, well-to-do Egyptian made arrangements that what had been done and said on behalf of Osiris should be done and said for him outside or inside his tomb after his death. No ceremony, however trivial, was considered unimportant, and no p. 3 form of words was thought useless. New ceremonies and words might be added, for it was held possible that they might become a means of salvation, but nothing might be omitted intentionally. The natural result of this religious conservatism was that as centuries rolled on the significance of several funerary ceremonies was forgotten, and the meanings of many liturgical phrases were understood with less and less exactness, until at length they became mere collections of words, which conveyed little to the minds of those who heard them."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Now the oldest religious ceremonies and formulae known to us were invented in connection with the presentation of offerings to the dead. In the Pre-dynastic Period men buried offerings of food, unguents, &c., with their dead, believing that, in some mysterious way, such material gifts would assist their relatives and friends to maintain their existence in the Other World. When this custom first arose cannot be said, but it was certainly general in the late Neolithic Period, and it continued to flourish for several thousands of years. Indeed it is probable that modified forms of it exist at the present day among the pagan, Christian, and Muhammadan inhabitants of the Nile Valley. We cannot tell now what ideas existed in the minds of those who gave offerings to the dead as to the way in which such gifts benefited the dead. There is little doubt that at first they believed that the life which was led by the departed in the Other World closely resembled life in this world, and it may be reasonably p. 4 assumed that they thought that the food which they placed in graves with the dead was actually consumed. They must have known that their funerary offerings would last in the ordinary way but a short time, and it seems as if it was only intended to supply the needs of the departed on their journey to the place of departed spirits. On the other hand, the fact that personal ornaments were buried with the food, and flint weapons of war and the chase, suggests that the living intended them to be used by the dead for an indefinitely long period. The primitive Egyptians appear to have thought that inanimate things possessed spirits like human beings, and if this be so it is probable that they also believed that the spirits of human beings in the Other World fed upon the spirits of the offerings made to them in this world by the living. This being so it would be necessary to renew the supply of offerings of food at regular intervals, so that the spirits of the dead might be prevented from suffering from hunger and thirst, and from dying a second time through exhaustion. There was also another side to the question of an important character. The souls of the dead who lacked food would, it was thought, be driven by hunger to the villages wherein they dwelt during their life, and would eat up such food as they found there, or, in the event of finding nothing suitable for their wants, would cause sickness, disease, and trouble. To avoid such a calamity it was necessary to make offerings at their tombs, and to propitiate them with suitable gifts p. 5 at regular intervals. Thus the giving of sepulchral offerings profited both the dead arid the living. Among the Egyptians of the Dynastic Period the presentation of offerings to the dead was regarded as one of the chief duties in life of the religious man, and it will here be well to illustrate their views on the subject by references to texts of several periods. In the second section of the great text in the Pyramid of Unas 1 the \"Chiefs\" are called upon to give to king Unas in heaven the loaves of bread, cakes, and drink- offerings which he had offered to them upon earth, and Ra himself orders those beings who preside over the products of the year to give Unas wheat, barley, bread, and beer from the supplies which they had collected \"For, for Unas to be hungry and not to eat, and to be thirsty and not to drink, is an abomination to him\" (l. 195). In the text of king Teta 2 the writer addresses hunger and adjures it not to approach Teta, but to depart to the god Nu, for Teta suffers not hunger like the god Shu, nor thirst like the goddess Tefnut, because the hunger which is in the belly of Teta, and the thirst which is on his lips, are destroyed by the four children of Horus, Hap, Tuamutef, Qebhsennuf, and Amset. In a paragraph immediately following allusion is made to the fate which befell the souls of the departed who were not provided with sepulchral offerings, and it is quite clear that the Egyptians thought they were p. 6 driven by hunger and thirst to wander about the desert and eat filth and drink polluted water. Small wonder, then, is it that hunger and thirst were held in abomination by departed spirits. In the text of Pepi I. the king is told that he shall receive each day a thousand loaves of bread, a thousand"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"vessels of beer, a thousand oxen, a thousand geese, a thousand sweet things of all kinds, and a thousand changes of linen, 1 but probably we are not intended to interpret this statement too literally, for such a series of large gifts suggests that these offerings were derived from the supply of the gods who were Pepi's brethren in heaven. In another passage some god is entreated to give bread and beer to Pepi of the bread and beer which are everlasting. 2 All the above extracts are taken from texts which are cut on the walls of the chambers of the pyramids of kings Unas, Teta, and Pepi, under the Vth and p. 7 [paragraph continues] VIth Dynasties, but if we look at the inscriptions on the mastaba tombs of earlier dynasties we shall find the same ideas expressed everywhere. Thus on the walls of the tomb of Seker- kha-baiu, which can hardly have been built later than the IVth Dynasty, and may well belong to the IInd or IIIrd Dynasty, lists of offerings are found, e.g., wine of various kinds, sweet beer, cakes of various kinds, fruit, such as raisins, mulberries ( nebes ), figs, &c., unguents and scented oils, heads of bulls and birds, and various kinds of garments, ceremonial apparel, &c. In one relief the list of offerings appears in a tabular form, and under the name of each offering is the character \"thousand,\" which indicates that the deceased prayed that the various kinds of food, drink, and clothing might be given to him by the thousand. 1 On a wooden panel from the tomb of Hesi, which probably dates from the end of the Archaic Period, we find a portion of an inscription in which the deceased prays for incense and for libations of cool water, wine, unguents, bulls, oxen, &c., by the thousand. 2 On a panel of a relief from the tomb of Hetep-her-s two tables laden with offerings are represented; on the one are fruit and flowers, and on the other joints of meat and loaves of bread and cakes, and on three lower tables, of similar shape, are two dead geese and the head of a bull. This tomb was built in the reign of p. 8 Khufu. 1 In the tomb of Ptah-kha-mert is a tabulated list of offerings ninety-six in number, 2 and in the tomb of Ankh-ma-ka, who lived in the reign of User-en-Ra, (Vth Dynasty) are two tabulated lists of offerings, the one containing ninety-six objects, and the other one hundred and four. 3 From the reliefs which decorate the walls of several of the tombs of the Vth and VIth Dynasties it is certain that in addition to the bread, fruit, wine, beer, &c., which were offered to the dead, living animals were brought to the tombs and offered up as sacrifices on their behalf. In the tomb of Ptah-shepses 4 we see among those who bear gifts to the tomb ministrants leading goats, gazelle, calves, and sheep, and in one of the lower registers is depicted the slaughter of two bulls, from each of which a fore-leg is being cut off. If we compare the lists of offerings given in the various tombs it at once becomes apparent that each list only contains a selection of names of objects; that the man who drafted the inscriptions for the mason to cut on the walls usually included only the most important names, and that the number of these depended upon the space which he had at his disposal. In the case of king Unas the various objects named as offerings are more than one hundred and forty in number, and in the pyramid of Pepi II. the number is still greater. Now in addition to supplying us with the names of the objects which pious men were expected to bring p. 9 to the graves of their dead, the inscriptions on the mastaba tombs and other monuments of the Ancient Empire also tell us the names of the chief festivals of the year, during which they were expected to present their offerings. On the sarcophagus of Khufu-ankh (IVth Dynasty) the following festivals are mentioned:--"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1. Festival of the New Year. 2. Festival of Thoth, (19th day of Thoth). 3. Festival of the beginning of the year. 4. Festival of Uak, (17th or 18th of Thoth). 5. Great Festival, (4th of Mekhir). 6. Heat Festival, (in the month of Mekhir). 7.

Festival of the beginning of the half month. p. 10 12. Every festival on every day for ever 1 . Passing now to the period of the XIIth Dynasty, we find that lists of offerings similar to those on monuments of the Vth and VIth Dynasties are not unknown, and a good example of such is given in the tomb of Amen-em-hat at Beni Hasan. Here on one of the walls is a picture of the deceased seated, with tables and stands loaded with offerings before him, and in the upper registers is a tabulated list containing the names of one hundred and twenty-one offerings. 2 This may for convenience' sake be called the Great List of Offerings. Elsewhere are given three copies of a list containing the names of twenty-two offerings, 3 this may be called the Little List of Offerings. A Great List, containing the names of fifty-four offerings, and a Little List, containing the names of twenty-two, are also found in the tomb of Khnemu-Hetep. 4 The list of the festivals given in the latter tomb is long, and contains the following:-- 1. Festival of the New Year. 2. Festival of Thoth. 3. Festival of Pert Menu. 4. Festivals of Pati, 12 in number. p. 11 5. Great Festival. 6. Festivals of Great Heat and Little Heat. 7.

The 1st, 6th, 15th, and one other day in each month were fixed festival days, and, if to these we add the other 25 festival days, we find that on an average every fifth day was a day of festival. We are, then, justified in assuming that offerings were made to the dead by well-to-do people about once a week, and at some seasons of the year oftener. In the lists of Festivals given in documents of later periods 1 several other Festivals are mentioned, and during the most flourishing periods of Egyptian history the offerings in the tombs of kings and wealthy folk were renewed, wholly or in part, daily. Thus to feed the spirits of the dead who belonged to him was as much the duty of a pious man as to feed the living who depended upon him, and there is no doubt that, when the country was in a settled state, a regulated portion of the produce of each man's estate was set apart for the dead. From several Chapters in the Theban Recension of p. 13 the Book of the Dead many illustrations of the great importance attached to sepulchral offerings may be obtained. In Chapter I. the deceased beseeches the gods \"who give cakes and beer to the perfect souls\" to give him cakes and beer at the \"two seasons,\" i.e. morning and evening, daily. In Chapter LII. he prays that he may not be made to eat what is an abomination to him. \"Filth is an abomination unto me, and let me not be obliged to eat of it instead of the funerary cakes which the Kau (or, Doubles) eat. Let it not"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"touch my body, let me be not obliged to take it in my hands, and let me not be obliged to walk thereon.\" And in answer to a question as to what be would live upon before the gods, he replies, \"Let me live on the seven loaves and cakes which are brought before Horus\" and Thoth, and let me eat my food under the sycamore tree of Hathor. Give me authority over my own fields in Tattu, and over my own crops in Annu. Let me eat bread made of white barley, and drink beer made from red grain.\" In another place he says, \"I live upon what the gods live upon, and I eat of the cakes which are in the hall of the lord of sepulchral offerings,\" (Chap. LIII.). In the Papyrus of Nebseni, Chapter CLXXVIII., is a version of a text to which reference has already been made, but in its later form it is so instructive that one or two passages may well be quoted from it. In it Nebseni is made to say: \"The Eye of Horus hath been presented unto thee, and it feedeth p. 14 thee with the food of offerings. O Osiris, let him not suffer thirst before his god, let him suffer neither hunger nor thirst, and let the god Ahu carry them away, and let him do away with his hunger, O thou that fillest, O thou that fillest hearts. O ye Chiefs who dispense cakes, O ye who have charge of the Water-flood (i.e., the Nile), command ye that cakes and ale be given unto the Osiris Nebseni, even as Ra himself commanded this thing. Moreover, Ra hath commanded those who are over the abundance of the year to take handfuls of wheat and barley and to give them unto him for his cakes, for behold, he is a great bull. . . . They shall give cakes and beer unto the scribe Nebseni, and they shall prepare for him all good and pure things this happy day, things for journeying, and things for travelling, things of the Eye of Horus, things of the Boat, and all things which enter into the sight of the god.... The Eye of Horus hath ordained these things for the scribe Nebseni, and the god Shu hath ordered that whereon he shall subsist, both cakes and beer. . . . The Company of the gods hath offered incense to the scribe Nebseni, and his mouth is pure, and his tongue which is therein is right and true. That which the scribe Nebseni abominateth is filth, and he hath freed himself therefrom even as Set freed himself in the city of Rehiu, and he set out with Thoth for heaven. . . . Sepulchral meals have been given unto him by the lord of eternity, who hath ordered these things for him.\" p. 15 [paragraph continues] In Chapter CLXXX. the deceased says: \"My offerings are in heaven in the Field of Ra, and my sepulchral meals are on earth in the Field of Aaru.\" It is unnecessary to multiply extracts from the religious texts of later dynasties, for, so far as the importance and necessity of providing the spirits of the dead with meat and drink are concerned, the same ideas recur, expressed in almost the same words, century after century, and dynasty after dynasty, until the worship of Osiris came to an end throughout the country of Egypt. It will be seen in another part of this book that the list of offerings which were made to Unas, a king of the Vth Dynasty, about B. C. 3300, is repeated without many variants in the tomb of Peta-Amen-apt, who flourished under the XXVIth Dynasty, some twenty-seven centuries later. Professor Maspero has shown that there are several mistakes in the texts in the Pyramid of Unas, due partly to the ignorance of the masons who cut the inscriptions on the walls, and partly to the fact that the scribes who wrote the drafts for them did not always understand the passages which they were transcribing. The variants in the text of Peta-Amen-apt may be the result of the difficulties experienced by the scribes of his time in understanding some portions of the text, but there is certainly no ground for thinking that they are due to any authoritative change in the readings of the Ritual of Funerary Offerings. All the facts we now have tend to show that at some p. 16 very early period in the history of Egypt the priests drew up a List of the offerings which it was thought right to offer to the dead, and that they composed a series of formulae which were to be repeated by the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"officiating priests when they presented the offerings to the dead. This List, with the formulae, was handed down from generation to generation, and was extant in the Roman Period. In primitive times it is tolerably certain that when the living made offerings to the dead, their sole idea was to provide the spirits with nourishment sufficient to enable them to reach the place where the spirits dwelt in the Other World. As time went on, however, it was thought that the giving of food, and drink, and apparel to the dead, would benefit those who gave them when it was their turn to depart from this world, and proof of this is found in a text cut on the alabaster sarcophagus of Seti I., a king of the XIXth Dynasty. On this fine monument we have an illustrated copy of a \"Guide\" to the Other World, in which the state and condition of those who dwell there are. described. This \"Guide\" is divided into twelve sections, and the texts tell us what beings live in each, how they live, and how they employ their time. The general deduction to be made from them is that under the XIXth Dynasty the Egyptians believed that the bodies, souls, and spirits of the wicked were destroyed, that those of the good were rewarded with everlasting life and great felicity, and that the offerings made by men in this world went c p. 17 before them and awaited them in that which was to come. In the Second Division of the Other World (i.e., the Tuat) we find a class of beings called \"Heteptiutuau- Ra,\" and the accompanying description says: \"These are they who praised Ra whilst they were upon earth. They cast spells (or, used words of power) on [the fiend] Apep. They presented their offerings, [and] they made offerings of incense to their gods after their offerings.\" The text continues: \"They have gained possession of their libations, they receive their meat-offerings, and they eat their offerings in the Gate of him whose name is hidden.\" And each night when Ra passed through that Division of the Other World he said to them, \"Your offerings shall be yours, ye shall have possession of your libations, your souls shall never be hacked in pieces, and your food shall never fail, O ye who have praised [me] and vanquished Apep for me.\" Now, in addition to helping the souls of the dead to reach their appointed place, offerings were made at the tombs at regular intervals with the express object of bringing, the souls of the dead back to this earth to eat the offerings there with the living. The sweet smell of the incense burnt was thought to be grateful alike to the gods and to the souls who were with them, and freshly killed meat, newly baked cakes, fresh fruit, flowers and vegetables, and wine and beer were held to be irresistible attractions to the souls of the departed as they travelled p. 18 about daily in the country. It is known from many texts that souls journeyed from one great sanctuary to another in Egypt, and that they assisted at all the great national festivals, and expected to receive their due share of the offerings which were brought to the altars. From the Papyrus of Nu (XVIIIth Dynasty) we learn that the deceased expected a house to be provided for him on this earth after his death, to which men and women were to bring offerings and oblations daily. And Osiris ordered that beasts for sacrifice were to be brought to him by the south wind (i.e., cattle from Dar Fur), and grain by the north wind, and barley from the ends of the earth. 1 In the papyrus of Takhart-p-seru-abtiu, 2 of the Roman Period, the deceased is addressed in these words: \"Thou journeyest upon earth, thou seest those who are therein, thou inspectest all the arrangements in thy house, and thou eatest bread there. . . . Thou journeyest \"to the city of Nif-urt at the festival of things on the altar, the night of the festival of the Sixth Day, the Festival of Anep. Thou goest to Nif-urt at the Festival of the Little Heat, thou goest to Tattu during the Festival of Ka-hra-ka, on the day of setting up the Tet.\" The same views are very clearly expressed in the Book of Traversing Eternity,\" 3 and we read there p. 19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"that the deceased makes use of his power and freedom in the Other World to explore heaven, earth, and the deep. He visits all the great shrines of Osiris and Ra, holds converse with the gods of every portion of heaven, makes himself acquainted with all their mysteries, and day by day becomes more and more like them. To establish and maintain communication with the spirits of the dead was the heart's desire of pious Egyptians in all ages, and they thought that there was no more certain way of bringing this about than by making offerings to them. By eating the same food as beatified beings, and by drinking the same drink, mortals, they thought, acquired something of the nature of immortals, and the communion of the righteous on earth with the blessed in heaven was effected. In the foregoing remarks it has been said that funerary offerings were made to the \"souls\" of the dead, but it must be remembered that the word \"souls\" (or \"spirits\") is only used for convenience' sake, and that gifts of food and drink were made in reality to the \"Kau\" or \"Doubles\" of the dead. The Ka of a man was his individuality, or personality, to which the Egyptians assigned an independent existence; it took his bodily shape, with all its characteristics, and, when necessary, the form of a mummy. When the body of a man to whom it belonged died, the Ka took up its abode in the portrait statue of the deceased which was provided for it, and well-to-do families were in the habit of appointing p. 20 priests of the Ka whose duty it was to recite the prayers on behalf of the Kau of the dead, and to attend to the supply of offerings for them. The Ka possessed freedom to move whithersoever it pleased, and it could travel from one end of Egypt to the other, or take up its abode with the gods, or re-unite itself with the mummified body to which it belonged, or remain separated from it. The Ka was provided with a chamber, or special resting-place, in the tomb, and it rejoiced in the smell of the incense which was burnt there, and partook of the meat and drink offerings which were presented to it. The common Egyptian word for \"offering\" is HETEP, and its primary meaning seems to be \"something given by one being to another with the view of peacemaking or propitiation,\" in fact, a peace-offering. The word is no doubt connected with hetep , \"to be at peace, to be contented, to be satisfied, to be at rest,\" etc. Hetep is often written with the determinative of \"bread,\" and in the XVIIIth Dynasty the plural is frequently followed by determinatives meaning \"cakes,\" \"cattle,\" \"geese,\" \"beer,\" or \"wine\". Thus it is clear that the ordinary objects which were offered as-funerary gifts are referred p. 21 to. Hetep is also one of the words used for the object on which offerings were placed, i.e., altar, which, though usually made of stone, was sometimes made of wood. Yet although hetep certainly means \"offering,\" it is difficult not to think that in the earliest times the word must have possessed some other signification. If we look at the earliest funerary texts, which are found on the mastabas at Sakkarah, we find that many of them begin with the signs suten hetep ta . Now suten is the common word for \"king,\" hetep we have already seen means \"offering,\" and ta means \"to give,\" and it seems at first sight as if the group of signs must mean something like \"May the king give an offering.\" Frequently, however, these signs are followed by Anpu hetep ta 1 i.e., \"May Anubis give an offering,\" What the king is expected to give is not said, but Anubis is asked, or called upon, to give \"a burial in Amenti,\" and \"to provide the deceased with bread, beer, and cakes at the p. 22 \"festival.\" Elsewhere we find that the king is asked for the hetep , and Anubis for the burial, and Osiris is to give the offerings of bread, beer, and cakes. 1 But it is not said of what the hetep which the king is asked to give is to consist. In another text the king is called upon to give hetep , and Anubis to give the burial as before, and Osiris of Tattu to make the deceased to advance happily over the beautiful roads of the Other World, and Khenti Amenti is to"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"provide him with the funerary offerings. 2 Still there is no explanation of what the king's hetep is to consist. From many passages in texts of the Ancient Empire it is clear that offerings of food were given to the dead, chiefly by Anubis. Thus in Teta, line 387, it is said, \"Anpu Khenti Amenti giveth thee an offering, thy thousands of bread cakes, thy thousands of vessels of beer, thy thousands of vases of oil, thy thousands of oxen, thy thousands of changes of apparel, thy \"thousands of bulls; one cuts the throat for thee of the Smen goose, one shoots for thee the Therp goose.\" p. 23 In Pepi I., line 83, we have: \"SUTEN TA HETEP. May Anubis give an offering: thy thousand bread- cakes, thy thousand vessels of beer, thy thousand vessels of purifying fluid which cometh forth from the Usekh chamber, thy thousand pleasant things, thy thousand oxen, thy thousand things to eat, thy gifts of thy heart. The palm tree followeth thee, and the mulberry tree presenteth its head for thee in that which Anubis doeth for thee.\" In the Vth and VIth Dynasties Osiris is sometimes regarded as the giver of gifts of food, 1 and at a later period he generally takes the p. 24 place of Anubis in the performance of this office. In the text of Teta, line 140, Seb, or Keb, is said to give an offering to the king in his every form and in his every place, but when it is remembered that Seb was the great Earth-god, and the lord of all its products, this is not surprising. A few lines further on (line 150) we have: \"SUTEN HETEP TA. May Seb give an offering to this Teta. May he give to thee offerings of all kinds in sets of four, and a setting forth in abundance of bread-cakes and vessels of beer, and bread of all kinds which thou lovest, and which are fair for thee before the God.\" In Pepi II., line 680, we have the passage: \"SUTEN TA HETEP. May Seb give these chosen haunches of beef and pert-kheru offerings to all the gods, so that they may cause every good thing to happen to Pepi Nefer-ka-Ra.\" This passage is of considerable interest, for in it the words SUTEN TA HETEP occur, although p. 25 the offerings are to be made by Seb, not to a dead man, but to the gods. In a tomb at Sakkarah 1 we have the usual suten hetep ta , followed in the second line by suten hetep ta pert kheru , from which it might be gathered that the hetep which the king was asked to give consisted of pert kheru . Now it is quite clear that kheru means \"offerings\" because the signs are followed by the determinatives of bread, beer, or wine, and cakes. This fact was pointed out by Dr. Birch as far back as 1858, 2 and Egyptologists generally have accepted his rendering of the words pert kheru . Professor Maspero has treated the words with his usual skill in his article \"Sur l'Expression ma-khroou,\" 3 and shown that the primary meaning of pert kheru is the appearance of offerings which \"come forth at [the sound of] the voice,\" and gives the reasons for his opinion thus. The ministrant who performed the ceremony of making funerary offerings called out the names of the objects which were to be offered from a list which he had with him. Having called out a name his assistants brought the object referred to and set it before the statue, or mummy, of the deceased. As each object was presented, p. 26 the ministrant recited over it a short formula which contained words similar in sound to the name of the offering, in fact he played on the words, or punned. By means of these formulae the offerings were consecrated, and then they \"came forth\" on the table of offerings, or on the altar of the god, who was"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"supposed to give a portion of them to the dead. As this \"coming forth\" only took place after the words had been uttered by the ministrant, the offerings became known as pert kheru , or \"things which come forth at the voice.\" On the other hand pert kheru , or pert er kheru , may have another meaning, as we see from a passage in the Biography of Paheri (l. 42). This official addresses those who live upon earth, and declares that they shall hand on their exalted positions and dignities to their children, provided that they say on his behalf, \"SUTEN TA HETEP!\" according to the things which are written in the Books, and \"PERT ER KHERU,\" according to the saying of the men of olden time, \"like unto the PERRT\" (i.e., the things which come forth) from the mouth of \"the god.\" From this we see at once that the words suten ta hetep p. 27 have become a mere formula, and that this formula was to be recited because it was found in the sacred books. Next, it is clear that the words pert er kheru (i.e., \"things which come forth at the word\") were also a formula, which was to be recited because the men of olden time had been in the habit of reciting it. But the text goes on to say that the pert er kheru were to be \"like the perrt from the mouth of the god,\" and its meaning is plain. When the god of creation made the world and the things in it, he merely uttered the names of the things which he wished to make, and these things came into being. Paheri wished the people whom he addressed to say pert er kheru ma perrt em re en neter , so that the things which came forth might be like the things which appeared after the god had uttered their names. In other words, the mere utterance of the words of the formula by the living would cause offerings of every kind to appear in abundance, just as the utterance of the words suten ta hetep would produce a \"royal offering.\" It was unnecessary to place offerings in the tomb, for these would appear as a matter of course as a result of the recital of the formulae. The meaning of pert kheru has also been discussed by Mr. Griffith, 1 who thinks that pert kheru and pert er kheru undoubtedly represent the old form of kheru . Other authorities who accept the general p. 28 meaning of \"offerings\" for pert kheru are Virey, 1 , Am√©lineau 2 and Erman 3 . It now remains to consider how the words suten hetep ta , were understood by the Egyptians. It is true that they occur on almost every sepulchral monument known to us, but there are cases in which they are omitted. To one of these Mr. Griffith has called attention, namely the inscription of Methen, which begins with the words Anpu hetep ta , \"May Anpu give an offering,\" and makes no mention of the hetep of the king. Another is found in the work of Mariette, Les Mastaba , p. 116, where we have \"May the great god give an offering,\" and no mention is made of the king. Both examples come from monuments which are not later than the IVth Dynasty, and it is clear that there was a time in Egypt when men invoked the god and made no mention of the king. It is quite possible, and very probable, that the king sent gifts or offerings when his friends among the nobles, or highly meritorious officials, were laid to rest in their tombs, and a proof of this is perhaps furnished in a text published by Mariette ( op. cit. , p. 396) where we have the following:-- p. 29 \"May the king give an offering! May he give 1000 loaves, 1000 [vessels of] wine (or beer), 1000 oxen (or, bulls), 1000 geese, 1000 swathings, 1000 [vessels of] oil, 1000 linen garments.\" On the other hand, it is possible to regard suten hetep ta merely as a formula of pious import, which is not intended to be understood literally, and to translate it by \"may one give.\" The Egyptians were an eminently practical people, and, however great and powerful they thought their kings, they must have"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"perceived that it was impossible for them to send funerary gifts to the tombs of each and all their subjects. It may be argued that the king was held to be god as well as man, and that he was therefore able to supply every dead person with offerings, like Seb, or Anpu, or Osiris, or Khenti Amenti, but there seems to me to be no evidence in the texts which would support this view. Moreover, there p. 30 is a passage in the text of Pepi II. which makes it impossible. In line 680 a prayer is made that Seb will give pert kheru to all the gods, provided that they give to the king all good things, and make \"this pyramid, this work,\" endure for ever. So long as the gods do this, provision shall be made for them, they shall be adored, they shall possess both soul and vital power, \"there shall be given unto them a hetep ta suten of cakes, bread, beer, oxen, geese, linen garments, and unguent, they shall receive their divine offerings, choice animals and geese shall be slain for them, festal (?) offerings, shall be made for them, and they shall take possession of the Urerit crown like the Great and Little Companies of the gods. In this passage, it seems to me, the words must mean something like a \"royal offering,\" and Professor Maspero's rendering \"offrande royale,\" or \" proscyn√®me royale ,\" is no doubt correct, 1 that is to say, it represents the meaning which the Egyptians attached to them in the time of king Pepi II. The almost universal occurrence of suten hetep ta before p. 31 the prayer to Anubis and other gods for funerary offerings proves that these words were believed to benefit the dead in some way, but it seems that their exact meaning was forgotten in very early times, and that their appearance on sepulchral monuments of the later periods is due entirely to the respect shown by the Egyptians for ancient tradition, and to their religious conservatism. With the dynastic Egyptians they expressed, I believe, the hope that the offerings made at their tombs would, in number and abundance, resemble those made to a king, in fact, a \"royal offering,\" and many Egyptologists have translated them by these or similar words. Thus Birch rendered suten hetep ta by \"royal oblation\"; 1 Bergmann by \"eine k√∂nigliche Opfergabe\"; 2 D√ºmichen by \"k√∂niglich Gnade (wie es ein K√∂nig thut, wie es eines K√∂nigs, w√ºrdig est)\"; 3 Brugsch by \"die K√∂nigliche Gabe eines Opfertisches\"; 4 Baillet by \"don de royale offrande\"; 5 Maspero 6 and de Horrack by \"royale offrande\"; 7 Pierret by \"oblation\"; 8 &c. As an alternative rendering Brugsch gives, \"der K√∂nig gew√§hrt einen Opfertisch,\" 9 and Birch gives, \"act of homage\"; 10 and Ledrain, 11 and Piehl give p. 32 [paragraph continues] \"Proscyn√®me 1 ( œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫ ‚Ä¢ ŒΩŒ∑ Œ± ). The view recently put forward that we must translate by \"May the king give an offering,\" is practically a revival of Brugsch's rendering, \"der K√∂nig gew√§hrt einen Opfertisch,\" which was published in 1868. It is well known that among all African peoples, when a man of importance dies, all his kinsfolk and friends send gifts to swell the amount of food which is intended to be consumed at the funeral feast. In primitive times in Egypt, the king also probably sent gifts of food when his officials were buried, and at a later period it is possible that certain portions or articles of food were described as the \"royal offering,\" whether they were given by the king or not. In fact, no funeral feast was considered to be complete without its \"royal offering.\" This view seems to me to be supported by a vignette on plate xii. of D√ºmichen's Grabpalast, Abth. ii., which contains the version of the Book of Opening the Mouth found in the tomb of Peta Amen-apt. In this we see a ministrant \"preparing the royal offering,\" whilst the Sem, priest stands behind him sprinkling water from a libation vase. Here there is no mention of the king giving the offering, and it is clear that the \"royal offering\" was only one of many which were given to the dead."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Footnotes 2:1 Book of the Dead , Chapter CLXXXII., line 16. 5:1 Maspero, Pyramides de Saqqarah , p. 20. 5:2 Maspero, op. cit. , p. 97. 6:1 Maspero, op. cit. , line 46. 6:2 Ibid. , line 390. 7:1 Mariette, Les Mastaba , pp. 76-79. 7:2 Ibid. , p. 82. 8:1 Mariette, Les Mastaba , p. 90. 8:2 Ibid. , p. 119. 8:3 Ibid. , p. 215. 8:4 Op. cit. , p. 383. 10:1 Brugsch, Kalendarische Inschriften , p. 235. 10:2 Griffith and Newberry, Beni Hasan , pt. i., pl. xvii. 10:3 Ibid. , pll. xviii., xix. and xx. 10:4 Ibid. , pll. xxxv., xxxvi. 12:1 See the lists given by Brugsch, Kalendarische Inschriften , p. 237 ff. 18:1 Book of the Dead , Chapter CLII. 18:2 British Museum , No. 10,112. 18:3 Ed.

THE religious literature of all periods of Egyptian history proves that the Egyptians believed in a resurrection and in immortality, and that from the earliest to the latest times they performed ceremonies at, or in, the tomb, and recited formulae, which were part incantations and part prayers, with the view of assisting the dead to renew their life, to enjoy their existence in the Other World, and to escape from \"dying a second time.\" We have already seen that so far back as the beginning of the IVth Dynasty, about B.C. 3800, it was customary to offer series of gifts of food, and drink, and raiment to the dead, and there is every reason to think that the presentation of such gifts was made by priests, who recited over them forms of words which were believed to sanctify the things offered, and to make them to become suitable for the needs of the dead. We know that certain kinds of food and drink were offered in certain quantities, and in a definite order, and that every detail of the ceremonies connected with their presentation was performed according to a system p. 34 which had then been in use for a very long time. The ceremonies and formulae of the liturgy of funeral sacrifice in their oldest forms belong, no doubt, to the earliest period of Egyptian civilization, and it is very probable that many of them were in existence in the Predynastic Period. Among the oldest of the ceremonies which were performed for the benefit of the dead is that called the \"Opening of the Mouth,\" and its object is explained by its name. The Egyptians realized at a very early period that it was useless to load the tables for offerings in the tombs with bread, beer, meat, fruit, and vegetables unless the dead could in some way partake of them, and the priests invented a series of ceremonies and composed formulae which were intended to bring about this desirable result. The belief in the importance of \"Opening the Mouth\" for the dead has long been known to Egyptologists, in fact ever since the publication of the text of the Sa√Øte Recension of the Book of the Dead by Lepsius in 1842. In the Sa√Øte Recension, as in the Theban, the XXIIIrd Chapter is devoted to the opening of the mouth of the deceased, and in the Vignette a priest is seen standing before a statue of the deceased, to which he addresses certain words. In his left hand he holds a vase of unguent, which played a prominent part in the ceremony performed by the priest whilst he uttered the prescribed formula. The, XXIst and XXIInd Chapters were written with the view of \"giving a mouth to a man in Neter p. 35 [paragraph continues] Khert,\" or the Other World, and in the Vignette the priest is seen standing and holding the Ur-hekau instrument in his right hand, and a vase in his left. He holds out the instrument towards the face of the deceased, and is, as we know from other sources, about to touch his mouth. In the text of the XXIIIrd Chapter the deceased says, \"Ptah hath opened for me my mouth with his instrument of iron wherewith he opened the mouth of the gods.\" This is an important statement, for it shows that in the Ptolemaic Period a legend was extant that at some time during their existence the mouths of the gods needed opening, that the origin of the ceremony of \"Opening the Mouth\" was divine, and that it was performed in the mythological period. The illustrated papyri which contain the Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead supply further details of the ceremony, and in the papyrus of Ani, in the Vignette of Chapter XXIII., we see a SEM"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"priest, clad in a panther's or leopard's skin, performing one portion of it on a figure of the scribe Ani. In front of him are a sepulchral box for holding unguents, three instruments, and the instrument . In another Vignette in the same papyrus is a representation of the performance of the ceremony at the door of the tomb. The mummy of Ani is held upright by Anubis, and three priests are officiating; two hold the instruments to the face of the mummy, and the third reads the p. 36 formulae from a roll of papyrus in his hands. Between the mummy and the priests is a table loaded with offerings, and on the ground round about are the various objects which are used in the performance of the ceremony. Behind the priests are the cow and calf for sacrifice, and an assistant is seen bringing a leg of beef. In the Papyrus of Hunefer this scene is repeated with some modifications and fuller details; these are illustrated by the accompanying block. In the upper register one priest presents to the face of the mummy four vases, and another holds in one hand the instruments , and presents with the other the Ur-hekau instrument, the head of which is in the form of that of a ram. The SEM priest stands behind holding a libation jar in his right hand, and a censer in his left. In the lower register are the cow and calf for sacrifice, two ministrants, the one bearing the heart and the other the leg of a bull, a sepulchral coffer, a table of offerings, and a stand on which are spread out a panther's skin or leopard's skin, and the instruments, vases, &c., which were used in the performance of the ceremony. Above these scenes are several short lines of text, which are entitled, \"The Chapter of performing the Opening of the Mouth of the statue\" [of the deceased]. This chapter contains two extracts from the \"Liturgy of Funerary Offerings.\" The merit of discovering the \"Liturgy of Funerary Offerings\" belongs to Sig. Ernesto Schiaparelli, who in 1877 was able to prove that the contents of Papyrus p. 37 [paragraph continues] No. 3155 in the Louvre were identical in a large number of places with the text on the coffin of Butehai-Amen, in Turin. Butehai-Amen was a priest who flourished under the XXth Dynasty, and he caused a copy of the Book of Opening the Mouth to be written upon the two covers of his coffin in red and black ink. Dev√©ria had examined this papyrus many years before, and he stated in his Catalogue des Manuscrits √âgyptiens (Paris, 1881, p. 171) that it \"contained a liturgical text entirely different from the ordinary funerary works, and that it was noteworthy by reason of the mention in it of the priests of different orders who officiated, and the description of the part which each individual performed in the funeral ceremony.\" In a valuable paper entitled \" Le Fer et l'Aimant en √âgypte ,\" 1 he translated about a page and a half of the papyrus, and Sig. Schiaparelli believes that he cherished the thought of publishing the complete work. The papyrus was-written for a priestess called SAIS. The lower portions of the first few leaves are wanting, and the writing is in places very difficult to read. Being convinced of the importance of the text, Sig. Schiaparelli spent a winter in copying it, and he devoted himself to the preparation of an edition of the text on the coffin in Turin, which dates from the p. 38 [paragraph continues] XXth Dynasty, and that of the Paris papyrus, which was written probably between A. D. 50 and 150. Neither text is accompanied by Vignettes, and many parts of them it is impossible to understand without illustrations. About this time, fortunately, his attention was called to a series of drawings of scenes in the tomb of Seti I. at Thebes which Champollion 1 had made and published. In"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"these priests are represented performing ceremonies on the statue of the king, and the short texts which accompany them were quickly seen by Sig. Schiaparelli to resemble passages in the Liturgy of Funerary Offerings. From a paper by Professor Naville 2 he was able to identify a passage in the text on the coffin of Butehai-Amen, and with the help of the careful copy of all the scenes and texts in the tomb of Seti I., with which Professor Naville supplied him, he was at length able to give a rendering of the whole text, and to describe the ceremonies which were there illustrated. The first part of his work, 3 i.e., the plates, appeared in 1881, and the two volumes of text in 1882 and 1890 respectively. In 1882 Professor Maspero published in his Recueil (tom. iii., p. 171 ff.) the first part of the texts from the Pyramid of Unas, which contains the oldest known form of the Liturgy of p. 39 [paragraph continues] Funerary Offerings, with a French translation of a portion of it. Another copy of this early form is found in the Pyramid of Pepi II. Nefer-ka-Ra, and this Professor Maspero published, with a translation of the whole, in a later volume of the same work, and in his complete edition of the \"Pyramid Texts\" entitled, \"Les Inscriptions des Pyramides de Saqqarah,\" Paris, 1894. In 1884-5 Dr. J. D√ºmichen published the first two parts of his monograph 1 on the tomb of Peta-Amen-apt, a high priestly official who flourished under the XXVIth Dynasty, containing copies of the scenes and texts with descriptions, translations, &c., in German. The first part contains the complete text of the Liturgy of Funerary Offerings, and the second a version of the Book of Opening the Mouth; both works have Vignettes. A year later appeared the first volume of the great French work on the Royal Tombs of Thebes, 2 containing all the scenes and texts in the Tomb of Seti I. Among these were accurate copies of the texts of the Liturgy of Funerary Offerings, as they are found in the tomb of Seti I. at Thebes, and the Book of Opening the Mouth. In 1887 Professor Maspero published a valuable paper in the Revue de l'Histoire des Religions , tom. xv., pp. 159-188, in which he treated the Book of Opening the Mouth at considerable p. 40 length, and explained the Vignettes and the texts of the version in the tomb of Seti I. Since that time the texts of several tombs at Thebes have been published, and the material available for the study of the texts and Vignettes has been greatly increased. The principal versions of the Liturgy of Funerary Offerings and the Book of Opening the Mouth may now be summarized. For the Liturgy there are two copies of the period of the Ancient Empire, one in the Pyramid of Unas, and one in the Pyramid of Pepi II. Nefer-ka-Ra. Several Lists of offerings, more or less complete, from the mastaba tombs at Sakkarah are also available. Of the XIXth Dynasty there are the Lists in the tomb of Seti I. at Thebes and in his temple at Abydos. Of the XXth Dynasty there is the List on the covers of the coffin of Butehai-Amen; of the XXVIth Dynasty the List of Peta-Amen-apt; and of the Roman Period the List in the Papyrus of Sais, the priestess, in Paris. For the Book of Opening the Mouth there are: a copy, with Vignettes, in the tomb of Rekhmara at Thebes, of the XVIIIth Dynasty; a copy, with Vignettes, in the tomb of Seti I. at Thebes, of the XIXth Dynasty; a copy, without Vignettes, written for Butehai-Amen on the covers of his coffin, of the XXth Dynasty; a copy, with Vignettes, in the tomb of Peta-Amen-apt, of the XXVIth Dynasty; a copy, without Vignettes, written for the priestess Sais in the Roman period. The reader who will take the trouble to compare p. 41 the various versions of the Liturgy and the Book of Opening the Mouth will find that, in all essentials, they remained unchanged from the IVth Dynasty to about the end of the first century. of the rule of the Romans in Egypt. The Vignettes, though we owe them to the funerary artists of the XVIIIth, XIXth, and XXVIth Dynasties, illustrate faithfully ceremonies which had been performed for many centuries before"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"they were drawn, and the evidence which they afford may be used as a sure guide in determining the exact meaning of many obscure points in the rubrical directions and texts. We may now give an account of the Liturgy of Funerary Offerings, derived from the texts in the Pyramid of Unas and the tomb of Peta-Amen-apt. The Liturgy was recited in a chamber of the tomb called \"Tuat,\" and when the offerings had been brought there, the table for the offerings, or altar, was purified for the KA, or Double, of the deceased, and the service began. The formulae were recited by the Kher heb priest, who held in his hands a roll of papyrus, on which was written a copy of the service, and who directed the assistant priests; the ceremonies were performed chiefly by the SEM, Or SMER, priest, assisted by one or more ministrants. In the earliest times the ceremonies were probably performed over the mummy, but at a later period a statue of the deceased was substituted.

Next: The First Ceremony"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next p. 42 THE FIRST CEREMONY. To cleanse and purify the statue so that it might become a suitable and permanent dwelling-place for the KA was the object of the first ceremony. The SEM priest took up a vessel filled with clean water, The Sem priest pouring water from a libation vase into a libation bowl held by a ministrant . in which salt or soda had been dissolved, and poured it into a bowl which was held in the hands of an assistant. He next walked round the statue four times, sprinkling the salted water on it on all sides, or perhaps washing portions of it, and meanwhile the Kher heb said four times:-- p. 43 \"O Osiris, everything which is hateful in Unas hath been carried away for thee; for that which was uttered in his name of evil hath Thoth come, and he hath carried it away to Osiris. I have brought that which was spoken in the name of Unas of evil, and have placed it in the palm of thy hand. The SA shall not be separated from thee, and thou shalt not be separated from it.\" From the way in which Osiris is mentioned in this passage it is clear that the cult of this god was general in Egypt when this Liturgy was drawn up, and that be was already recognized as the god of the dead. The effect of the sprinkling of water over the statue, or the washing of it with water, was to remove the sins of the deceased from him, and to cleanse his body and Ka. There can be no doubt that the Egyptians in all periods attached very great importance to the use of water ceremonially, and there is good reason for believing that they regarded it as one of the principal sources of life since the gods were created from water, and Nu, the great god of the celestial deeps, was the father of the gods. They believed that water possessed a mysterious power which made itself manifest under the form of life, and it may be noted in passing that, in the scenes in which Thoth and Horus are pouring out water over the heads of kings, the water is indicated by series of ankh signs , i.e., \"life, life, life.\" D√ºmichen has already in this connection pointed out the fact that in the \"Tale of the Two Brothers,\" Anpu put the heart of p. 44 his younger brother Bata into a vessel of water; when the heart had absorbed all the water it came to life."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Water not only washed away sin, but gave new birth and life to the dead. The Gnostics, who preserved many ancient Egyptian beliefs, attached great importance to the use of water ceremonially, and, according to Irenaeus ( Haeres , 1, 2, ¬ß 5), they threw oil and water over the heads of the dying to make them invisible to the powers of darkness. The ancient Egyptians certainly dissolved salt, or soda in some form, in their \"holy water,\" and it is probable that they pronounced some formula over it before sprinkling it upon the dead. The sprinkling of the dead was the first and most important of burial ceremonies among the Egyptians for thousands of years, and it is probable that it was adopted, under the name of baptism of the dead, by many sections of the Christian Church. For centuries certain Christians actually baptized the dead, and they continued to do so in spite of the prohibitions of many Councils. The exact meaning which is to be attached to the word tu or \"evil\" is not quite clear; 1 it was certainly connected with the words of Unas, but whatever it was this \"evil\" was carried to Osiris by Thoth. Here we see Thoth acting as a sort of advocate for Unas with Osiris, and playing his part as the \"lord of divine words,\" and author of holy books, with which we are familiar from the texts of the Theban Recension of the p. 45 [paragraph continues] Book of the Dead . In the Judgment it was he who \"weighed words,\" and who weighed the heart of the dead man in the Great Balance, and reported the result to Osiris. It is the \"words\" of Unas which are in question here, and in Egypt both gods and men judged a man by his \"words.\" The sprinkling of the water caused Thoth to carry the words of evil uttered by Unas, and place them in the hand of the god. The words which were said by the Kher heb here, as in many other places in the Liturgy, were to be repeated four times. The Egyptians divided the earth into four quarters, over each of which a god presided, and in order to secure for the dead permission to move about freely through these quarters of the world, formulae, whether of blessing or of banning, were repeated four times, once for each god, and certain offerings were made in quadruplicate. The gods of the four quarters of the world at the time when this Liturgy was drawn up were Horus, Set, Thoth, and Sep, and they were probably the gods of the four cardinal points also. Later, however, their places seem to have been taken by the four sons of Horus, Mestha, Hapi, Tuamutef and Qebhsennuf, each of whom presided over one of the four pillars that held up the sky. The priest by walking round the mummy or the statue four times, and sprinkling water as he went, bestowed upon the Ka the power to journey into all parts of heaven and earth, and made him a pure being in respect of the four gods of the four quarters of the earth. p. 46 At the end of the first formula quoted above come the words, \"The Sa shall not be separated from thee, and thou shalt not be separated from it.\" By the word Sa , the Egyptians understood that mysterious energy and life-giving power which existed in the gods, and which for want of a better name we may call the \"fluid of life.\" Its source was the Sun-god, by whatever name he is called, Horus or Ra, and Ra, in the text of Unas 1 is said to be \"Sovereign of the divine Sa \". The gods and goddesses received this Sa from Ra and communicated it to those whom they loved upon earth. According to M. Moret. 2 the fluid of life could be transmitted from the being who possessed it to the person to whom it was desired to transfer it, by embracing that person and by making \"magnetic passes\" along the back. M. Maspero also describes the Sa as a sort of \"magnetic fluid,\" or \"aura,\" which could be transmitted to a person by laying hands on him, or by making passes over the nape of the neck or the spinal column. The phrase setep sa means something like to \"make passes.\" The Sa was transmitted to a king from the statue of a god by placing the arms of the statue round him, and by laying one of its hands on the nape of his neck as he knelt before it. 3 p. 47"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"[paragraph continues] When the statue had exhausted the store of the power which was in it, it was able to obtain a fresh supply from the Other World. The object of making passes before the statue of the dead, or his mummy, was to give a place in the fore-front of the company of the KHU, or \"Spirits,\" in the Other World. This is certain from a passage in the text of Pepi I., wherein it is said, \"The passes by which he obtaineth the fluid of life having been made over him by [Ra] and Horus, he is at the head of the KHU\" (l. 695).

Next: The Second Ceremony"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next THE SECOND CEREMONY. The ceremony of the sprinkling of water having been completed, the second ceremony begins. The SEM priest, or one of his assistants, took in his hand a censer in which incense has been placed, and having set fire in it, and made the incense to burn, he walked with it four times round the statue or mummy, and censed it, whilst the Kher heb recited the following four times:-- \"Let him that advanceth advance with his KA. \"Horus advanceth with his KA. \"Set advanceth with his KA. \"Thoth advanceth with his KA. \"Sep advanceth with his KA. \"Osiris advanceth with his KA. \"Khenti-maati 1 advanceth with his KA. p. 48 \"Thy Tet shall advance with thy KA. \"Hail, Unas! The arm of thy KA is before thee. \"Hail, Unas! The arm of thy KA is behind thee. \"Hail, Unas! The leg of thy KA is before thee. \"Hail, Unas! The leg of thy KA is behind thee. \"O Osiris Unas! I have given unto thee the Eye "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Sem priest carrying the censer of burning incense . of Horus, and thy face is filled therewith, and the perfume of the Eye of Horus is to thee.\" This formula begins with an address to the statue, or mummy, which is bidden to advance, just as do Horus, Set, Thoth, Sep, Osiris, and Khenti-maati, i.e., the dweller without eyes (the Horus of the dark night when neither sun nor moon is visible), These gods are p. 49 not separated from their KAU, and the KA of Unas, as the equal of their KAU, shall be with him. With his KA, however, shall come his Tchet , or Tet , , or , i.e., his backbone, or pillar which supports the backbone. The , as Prof. Maspero has shown, represents the tree-trunk which was worshipped at Mendes in connection with Osiris; it was animated by Osiris, and was all-powerful in supporting the dead because of the presence of the god in it. Under the Middle and New Empires the is often seen painted on the bottoms of the insides of coffins, and when coffins were intended to stand on their feet, the was generally painted on the back outside. Thus when lying down the mummy rested on his and when standing up was supported by it. The KA of the deceased comes with him because it is supported by Osiris, and it comes with one leg and one arm before him, and one leg and one arm behind him. The exact signification of these expressions is unknown, but about the translation of the words there is no doubt. We next see that the incense with which the mummy is censed represents the Eye of Horus, or the Sun, and the use of the expression dates from the time when Horus was the greatest of the gods of heaven, and the sun was regarded as his eye. The sun was, of course, the source of heat and light, and therefore of all p. 50 life, and \"Eye of Horus\" was a synonym for everything which was beneficial for the living and the dead. The hot fumes of the incense surrounded the mummy or statue and gave warmth to it, the smoke rose up before its face, which it covered with a sort of layer, and the general effect of the ceremony was to make"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the deceased pure and warm. The first ceremony removed sin from the new dwelling-place of the KA, and the second continued its purification, and gave to it the quickening beat which was derived from the Eye of Horus. The pungent smell of the incense formed a sort of atmosphere for the dead, and was pleasant to them. Footnotes 47:1 D√ºmichen, \"the dweller in the town of Sekhem (Letopolis).\" Next: The Third Ceremony"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next THE THIRD CEREMONY. The third ceremony of purification was performed by means of water, in which two different kinds of incense had been dissolved. The rubric in the text of Unas mentions \"two balls\" of incense, but that of the text of Peta-Amen-apt says that one ball shall be of incense of Shet pet, i.e., of the incense prepared from the salt found in the Natron Valley, and the other of the salt which is found near the city of Nekheb, or Eileithyiapolis. Shut pet was a portion of the Sekhet-Hemam, or \"Field of Salt,\" known to- day as the \"Wadi an-Natrun,\" which lies about forty-five miles to the northwest of Cairo, and the incense made from the salt deposits here was called \"Incense of the North.\" The incense made from the salt deposits near Nekheb was p. 51 called \"Incense of the South.\" The KA whose statue had been purified by incense from each place was free to journey through the North and South of Egypt, and in a sense it made him \"lord of the Two Lands,\" i.e., of all Egypt. The priest, having dissolved the balls of natron in the water in the vessel, poured it out into The Sem priest pouring water from a libation vase into a libation bowl held by a ministrant . a bowl held by an assistant. He then took the bowl, and, going round the statue four times, sprinkled it with the water of the natrons of the South and North, whilst the Kher heb repeated the following words four times:-- \"This libation is for thee, O Osiris, this libation is p. 52 \"for thee, O Unas; it cometh forth from thy son, it cometh forth from Horus. \"I have come and I have brought unto thee the Eye of Horus, that thy heart may be refreshed therewith. I have brought it [and placed it] under thee, [under] thy sandals, and I have presented unto thee that which floweth forth from thee. Whilst it is with thee there shall be no stoppage of thy heart, and it shall be with thee with the things (or, persons) which came forth at the [sound of the] voice.\" The libation now poured forth represents the moisture which Horus sends forth from himself and from his Eye, and is intended to take the place in the body of the deceased of that which flowed forth from"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"him before death, or during the process of mummification. The deceased is identified with Osiris, and Horus therefore becomes his son. This fluid of Horus will make the heart of the deceased to live again, just as the water in which the heart of Bata was placed in the Tale of the Two Brothers, having been absorbed, made it to live. So long as a supply of it exists in the body of the deceased his heart shall not stop, and this supply was provided among the \"things which come forth at the voice,\" i.e., the offerings. We have already seen that pert kheru is a name given to offerings, because they were believed to appear when the deceased, or the priest, ordered them to appear, and it is clear that the words pertha nek kheru in the text here refer to the offerings. The Egyptians attached great importance to p. 53 spoken words, and they regarded the power of speech and the gift of the voice as mighty weapons, both for the living and the dead. The KAU, or Doubles, of the dead who had learned to utter words correctly, and who knew the proper tones to employ in uttering them, were in a position to go where they pleased and to do what they liked, for no god, spirit, fiend, or devil, and no inanimate object, could help obeying the commands which they uttered. The order for food or water having been given by them, food or water appeared forthwith. In the passage translated above are the words \"that which floweth forth,\" which I have used as the equivalent of the Egyptian word ertu . The exact meaning of the word is \"effluxes,\" or \"outflowings,\" and the determinatives show that by ertu we are to understand the strong-smelling liquid which exudes from a dead body. Several passages in the Book of the Dead support this view, as the following examples will prove. In Chapter LXIII B . 2, we have, \"I have lifted up the efflux from Osiris;\" in Chapter CXIX., \"Pure are the effluxes which are borne away from thee;\" in Chapter CXLVII. 6, \"I have come unto thee, Osiris, pure one of effluxes;\" p. 54 in Chapter CXLIX. (Aat XIII.), \"Like the stream from the effluxes coming forth from Osiris;\" and in Aat XIV. of the same Chapter, \"I shall not be destroyed by the effluxes which come forth from Osiris.\" The effluxes of Osiris here referred to are undoubtedly the humours which were believed to have drained out of the body of Osiris when Horus and his \"sons\" were embalming it. From the above passages it is clear that the Egyptians regarded these humours as pure or holy, for they represented the very essence of the god. Now the Egyptians were not the only people in the world who attached mystic power and importance to the fluid which ran out from the dead, but though the texts make it certain that they did, we cannot learn from them exactly why they should do so. The reason is, however, not far to seek. Mr. Crawley tells us ( Mystic Rose , p. 287) that communion with the dead is most exactly reached, and the identity of eating with a person and eating him most clearly shown, in the common Australian practice in which mourners drink the humours of the decaying corpse, or eat its flesh. The Kurnai anoint themselves with decomposed matter from the dead. It is done in the Kingsmills to \"remember p. 55 him.\" So in Timorlaut mourners smear themselves with the fluids of the corpse. The Aru islanders drink them \"to effect union with the dead man.\" Some of the liquid is kept in order to injure enemies. The object of drinking the liquid is, clearly, to obtain the qualities of the dead man, his strength, and, perhaps, his vital power, and it is possible also that those who indulged in such practices did so with the idea of avoiding injury from the departed spirit. What the Egyptians did with the humours of the dead is unknown, but in the case of great and holy men, that which drained from their bodies was certainly turned to some good account by the living. The custom of draining the dead body of its moisture is common enough among modern peoples of Central Africa, as we may see from the account of a great Baluba chief's death quoted by Sir H. Johnston ( Grenfell and the Congo , ii., p. 655). \"When an important Luba chief expires, every one, great and small, must mourn in a subdued tone; the members of all the brotherhoods come before the house where the body lies to perform dances; the women violently"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"strike their hatchet and hoe against each other. This deafening hubbub lasts a day. . . . During this time a young slave is obtained, his neck is broken by a heavy blow, and he is laid by the corpse for two days. He is the chiefs boy attendant. His wives, squatting near him, do not cease their lamentations. Some days pass in this way without other incidents, after which the stiffened limbs p. 56 are forcibly bent, and the body placed in the wicker 'coffin. In the house two stages are raised, one above the other; on the upper one is placed the coffin, on the lower one a large earthen pot. The body decomposes; a noxious liquid infested with maggots escapes from it and falls into the receptacle; it is left there for several weeks.\" The Belgian missionary who describes the chief's burial does not tell us what was done with the \"noxious liquid,\" but, as human flesh and bones form an important element in the \"medicines\" which are prescribed by medicine men in Central Africa, we are probably justified in assuming that the liquid was used in the same way. Next: The Fourth Ceremony"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next THE FOURTH CEREMONY. The first ceremony removed evil or sin from the body of the deceased, the second gave it warmth, and the third restored to it the humours which had been expressed from it. For the fourth ceremony the SEM priest dissolved five grains of incense made from the salt deposits near the city of Nekheb, i.e., \"Incense of the South,\" in a libation vase of water, and, having poured it into a vessel, walked with it four times round the mummy or statue, and sprinkled it each time. The name given to this libation water is \"Semman,\" and of the five grains of salt, or alum, which it contained, one was for Horus, one for Set, one for Thoth, one for Sep, and one for Osiris, that p. 57 is, for the deceased himself. Whilst the SEM priest walked round the statue the Kher heb said the following words four times:-- \"[Here is] Semman ! [Here is] Semman ! \"Open thy mouth, O Unas, and taste thou the taste thereof in the halls of the god, for Semman is the emission of Horus, for Semman is the emission of Set, The Sem priest pouring water from a libation vase into a libation bowl held by a ministrant . for Semman is the stablisher of the heart of the two Hawk-gods (i.e., Horus and Set). Thou art cleansed with hesmen (natron), and thou art like unto the followers of Horus.\" The libation thus poured out either represented the essence of Horus and the essence of Set, which was the p. 58 source of the strength of their hearts, and the substance which gave them life, or was believed to be transmuted into that essence through the words of power spoken by the Kher heb. The power of the"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Semman water was great, for as soon as it touched the face of the deceased his mouth was opened, and he was able to taste the emission, or life essence, of Horus and Set. Having tasted it, his whole being was changed, and he became a new creature, and henceforth he was a counterpart of the Shemsu Heru or \"Followers of Horus.\" The Horus here referred to must not be confounded with the twin-brother of Set. The Horus who is always associated with Set is \"Horus the Great,\" or \"Horus the Elder,\" the Haroeris of the Greeks, but the Horus mentioned in the Liturgy in connection with \"Followers\" is \"Horus, the son of Isis.\" The \"Followers of Horus\" were a group of beings who were closely connected with Osiris, and having \"followed\" him in this world they passed after him into the Other World, where they became his ministrants and messengers, partaking of his immortal nature, and sharing his life. Horus the Elder was \"followed\" by a group of beings also, but these were of a totally different character, for they were called \"Mesentiu,\" i.e., \"workers in metal,\" or \"blacksmiths.\" In some texts the followers of Horus, the son of Isis, are identified with the metal-workers of p. 59 Horus the Elder, and it is possible that this is the case in the Liturgy. On the other hand, the deduction to be made from our text seems to be that the essence of Horus and Set introduced into the body of the deceased changed his nature into theirs, while the cleansing with natron made him a counterpart of the followers of Horus, the son of Isis. He thus possessed the nature of Horus, the oldest god of heaven, and the nature of a \"follower\" of the son of the man Osiris, who rose from the dead and became the ever- living god and judge of the dead. Next: The Fifth Ceremony"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next THE FIFTH CEREMONY. The next ceremony continued the process of assimilating the deceased with the gods. The priest, having dissolved five grains of incense made from the salt deposit in a place in the Natron Valley called Shet pet,\" \"Lake of Heaven,\" in a libation vase of water, and poured it into a vessel, walked with it four times round the mummy and sprinkled it each time. As he did so the Kher heb said the following words four times: \"Thou art purified with natron, and Horus is purified with natron. \"Thou art purified with natron, and Set is purified with natron. \"Thou art purified with natron, and Thoth is purified with natron. p. 60 \"Thou art purified with natron, and Sep is purified with natron. \"Thou art purified with natron, and thou art stablished among them. \"Thy mouth is the mouth of the sucking calf on the day of his birth.\" It is possible to translate \"Thou art purified with The Sem priest pouring water from a libation vase into a libation bowl held by a ministrant . natron as Horus is purified with natron,\" &c., as did D√ºmichen, but it seems better to render the passage without the addition of \"as\" in each member, for it is clear that the salted water was offered as much to the deceased as to each god. The effect of this sprinkling was to give the deceased power to take his place with p. 61"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"the gods of each of the four quarters of heaven, and to make him their equal. In the last line of the passage, \"Thy mouth is the mouth of the sucking-calf on the day of his birth,\" we appear to have an allusion to the calf figured in the Vignettes to Chapter CIX. of the Book of the Dead , which is entitled \"The Chapter of knowing the Souls of the East.\" In the Theban Recension we see the deceased standing in adoration before Ra-Harmachis, between whom and the deceased is a spotted calf. In the Sa√Øte Recension the deceased stands in adoration before the Boat of Ra, which is about to pass between the two \"Trees of Emerald\" into the sky. In the Boat are: 1.

The text tells us that the Souls of the East are Ra-Harmachis, the Calf of the goddess Khera (?), and Neter-tuai, or the planet Venus. The \"Sucking- calf\" must therefore be the name of a morning star which was associated with the rising sun, and with Isis as a morning star. It seems clear, then, that the passage in the Liturgy signifies that the deceased is identified in it with the star which was born in the sky at sunrise; as its mother was Isis the star was a form of Horus, son of Osiris and Isis, and the deceased is therefore the son of Osiris, that is, Horus.

The wines, being regarded as emanations from the Eyes of Horus, the White and the Black, contained the divine power which existed in the Eyes of the god, and they transferred to the deceased the might of the Day and the Night. Next: The Fourteenth Ceremony"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Index Previous Next THE FOURTEENTH CEREMONY. In the next ceremony the SEM priest offered a bread-cake, of the kind called Hem, which was presented for the \"lifting up of the face\" of the deceased. This name is followed by the word tchaut , the exact meaning of which is not easy to say. In the \"Hem\"-cake D√ºmichen 1 thought he saw the original of a cake in use among the Egyptians which was stamped with a figure of a vanquished hippopotamus; this beast was the symbol of Set, or Typhon, as we know from the texts, and from Plutarch, 2 who says that he was chained. In the pictures of the chained hippopotamus 3 the head of the monster is p. 73 turned back,\" i.e., he is looking behind him, and it is possible that the name \"Hem,\" which means \"to turn back,\" was given to cakes because they were stamped with a figure of the animal in this attitude. The words pat tchaut Maspero renders by \"G√¢teau de passage,\" and D√ºmichen by \"Hem-Brod wohlschmeckendes (?) the former rendering gives the better sense.

The Vignette which illustrates the next ceremony shows us the SEM priest kneeling before a small table p. 75 on which rests a bread-cake, which is called \"the Uten-cake, for the lifting up of the face.\" Whilst this bread-cake is being offered, the Kher heb said, according to the text of Unas, four times:-- \"SUTEN HETEP TA to the KA of Unas.\" These words were followed by:-- \"Osiris Unas, the Eye of Horus hath been presented unto thee--the bread which thou eatest.\" The Sem priest offering the Uten cake . According to the text of Peta-Amen-apt the Uten-cake is to be divided into two equal parts, and the words \"Suten hetep ta, to the KA of Peta-Amen-apt\" are to be said four times in connection with each half. Whilst the SMEN priest offers these the Kher heb says four times:-- \"Osiris, the Eye of Horus hath been presented unto thee--the bread which thou eatest, and thy mouth hath been opened thereby.\" It has been said above ( p. 21 ) that, though the words p. 76 suten hetep ta may at one time have been intended to mean \"May the king give an offering,\" it is clear they had already lost this meaning when the funerary texts were inscribed on the mastabas at Sakkarah. The passage from the text of Unas is an important proof that such is the case, for it is quite clear that the king is not entreated to give to Unas an offering. Here the words suten hetep ta occur some forty lines from the beginning of the Liturgy, where, in the ordinary course of things, we should expect them to appear. From the fact that they are ordered to be recited four times in one text, and eight times in the other, we are fully justified in believing that they are the opening words of a formula which was composed in primitive times and recited by priests and relatives on behalf of the dead, and that they were used by pious folk, as D√ºmichen first pointed out, in much the same way as \"Paternoster\" and"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"\"Ave Maria\" are used in our own times. It may be noted too in passing that the passage from the Liturgy under consideration presents us with one of the oldest examples of the use of the formula \" suten hetep ta en ka en ,\" \"May there be a royal offering to the KA of,\" which is so common on stelae from the XIIth Dynasty downwards.

In the next two ceremonies the SEM priest offers two vessels of wine to the deceased, each containing a Hathes measure; one vessel is made of some white p. 77 material, and the other of black. Whilst the former is being offered the Kher heb says:-- \"Osiris Unas, the Eye of Horus hath been presented unto thee; it hath been snatched from the hand of Set, and thou hast taken possession of it for thy mouth, and thou hast opened thy mouth therewith.\" And whilst the latter is being offered he says:-- \"Osiris Unas, thy mouth is opened by that which The Sem priest presenting a white vessel of wine . floweth(?) from thee.\" The words \"Eye of Horus which hath been snatched from the hand of Set\" refer to the belief that it was Set, the god of darkness, who swallowed the sun and moon during eclipses, and devoured the moon piecemeal after it was fourteen days old. The Eye of Horus was restored to him sometimes by Shu, who snatched it out of the hand of Set, 1 but more p. 78 frequently by Thoth, who is often represented in the form of an ibis-headed man carrying the Eye of Horus before him in his hands. As the Eye of Horus was the abode of disembodied souls and spirits, the presentation of this eye to the mummy, or statue, was equivalent to restoring to it the soul of the deceased. In this passage, and throughout the Liturgy generally, "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Sem priest presenting a white vessel of wine . the fundamental idea of the presentation of objects which are symbolic of the Eye of Horus is to bring back to the deceased his KA and BA, i.e., soul and the various members of his spiritual and mental economy.

They are here restored to him in the form of wine, the nature of which is changed by the words of the Kher heb. Footnotes 77:1 Lef√©bure, Le Mythe Osirien , p. 87; Moret, Rituel , p. 84.

After the presentation of the wine and beer the SEM priest took in his hands a small table, or stand, on which were placed several bread-cakes of different shapes and kinds, called \"Tchesert,\" i.e., \"the p. 80 holy table.\" With this he advanced to the deceased, and whilst he offered it to him the Kher heb said:-- \"O Ra, may the worship which thou hast in heaven and all the worship which is offered to thee be to Unas, and may everything which is offered to thy body be offered to the KA of Unas; and may everything which is offered to his body be thine.\" The Sem priest presenting the holy table of offerings . From this passage we learn that the deceased is identified with Ra, and that it was expected that he would share with Ra the praises, and worship, and offerings which were dedicated to him. The offerings made to the deceased were intended for Ra, upon whom devolved the duty of feeding him with a portion of them. The bread-cakes of earth were transmuted into the \"bread of everlastingness,\" and the wine into the \"wine of eternity,\" whereon Ra lived.

According to Maspero, it was a flat cake mixed with fat, and perhaps sweetened, and folded like a pancake. Whilst the SEM p. 82 priest presents this the Kher heb pronounces a formula, which in the Unas text seems to mean, \"The darkness (or, the night) becometh denser and denser,\" and in the text of Peta-Amen-apt, \"The ah food is spread out before thee like a field.\" It is clear that in the one text there is a play of words in ahah and akka , and in the other in ahah and ah , but the exact meanings of the sentences are unknown because we do not understand the allusions. The Sem priest presenting the Ah meal . [paragraph continues] D√ºmichen thought that the word akka , i.e., \"darkness or night,\" referred to the colour of the ah -cake, and that it might have been baked to a brown colour which was so dark in comparison with the tept cake that it appeared to be black.

THE LITURGY DESCRIBED. WITH the pouring out of the last series of libations the first series of ceremonies at or in the tomb came to an end. In the text of Unas there is no break in the text to indicate this fact, but in the text of Peta- Amen-apt at this place come the following words:-- \"Here shall be set forth the food, and the drink, and the things which are to be placed on the altar, and one shall enter with the 'suten hetep' (i.e., 'royal \"offering').\" This rubrical direction indicates that the ceremonies which have already been performed on the mummy, or statue, have opened the mouth of the deceased, and given him power to speak, and eat and drink, and that they have provided the KA with a pure statue wherein to dwell. The offerings up to this point were intended for the deceased only, and one of the chief objects in presenting them was to prepare the KA for partaking of the funeral feast which was to follow. The relatives of the deceased wished his KA to eat and p. 99 drink with them, because it enabled them to establish and maintain communion with a being who had taken upon himself the nature of the gods. By eating the same food and drinking the same drink the souls of the living and the dead were joined in a bond which brought solace, consolation, and comfort to the living, and destroyed the feeling of separation from their beloved ones which death brought in its train. The funeral feast, that is, the eating of food together by the living and the KA, produced identity of substance, and as the KA was divine by virtue of the ceremonies which had been performed over him and the formulae recited during the presentation of offerings, his living kinsfolk became divine, and they became, for the time being at least, as gods. Since these ideas existed in connection with the funeral feast, there is small reason for wonder at the insistence in funerary texts on the necessity for a regular and constant supply of offerings in the tombs. It must also be remembered that the nature of the material offerings presented to the dead was changed during the act of offering by the sacred formulae which the Kher heb recited over them. The bread and meat, and wine and beer, were transmuted into the essence and substance of Horus, the great god of heaven. When these were eaten and drunk in a place ceremonially pure, which for the time being represented heaven, both the spirits of the dead and of the living ate and drank their god in the form of the spiritual natures of the material offerings, which the living p. 100 absorbed into their material bodies, provided that such bodies were also ceremonially pure.

The second series of ceremonies began with the bringing in of the pert kheru , or offerings of meat and drink, which were to be placed upon the altar, and a The altar on which the offerings are placed . ministrant came with the suten hetep , or \"royal offering.\" Whilst this was being done the Kher heb said:-- \"Thoth returneth bringing it with him, he appeareth with the Eye of Horus.\" \"He hath given the Eye of Horus, and he is content therewith.\" It has already been said that the Eyes of Horus, or the sun and moon, suffered eclipse at times through the p. 101 agency of Set, and that the moon after the fourteenth day was devoured by him piecemeal each mouth. The souls of the dead who lived in the Eyes of Horus shared these calamities with the god, and thus it fell out that when the time had come to make the soul of the deceased to enter his body, the soul would be found to have disappeared with the solar or lunar Eye. Sometimes Horus went to look for his Eyes, and sometimes he sent one of them to look for the other; in every case the Eye was \"found\" and restored to the god. Occasionally Shu \"found\" the Eye in the hand of Set, and having rescued it from him he gave it back to Horus. The god, however, to whom Horus was most often indebted for his Eye was Thoth, who presided over the stars, and knew the times of their appearances and disappearances, and regulated their courses. Thoth was called the \"Heart of Ra,\" that is to say, he took possession of the soul of the god, and it was he who gave back the soul to the deceased, or to a god. 1 In the present case the mummy, or statue, of the deceased is ready to receive back his soul, and the Kher heb announces, as we have seen above, that Thoth hath returned with the Eye of Horus, which he had sought for, and that he hath given it to the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"deceased, who is content therewith.
