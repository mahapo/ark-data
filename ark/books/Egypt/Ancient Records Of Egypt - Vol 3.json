This splendid limestone tomb'was built by the general, Harmhab, who afterward became King Harmhab. His career before he gained the throne is openly narrated in his Coronation Inscription ($§ 22 ff.); but the first step in the study of his life is the demonstration of the identity of the general and the king. This was first proved by the observation that the Vienna fragment inay be fitted upon the Leyden blocksb ($5 2-13). The construction of the tomb and execution of the reliefs belong to a period either just before or just after the Aton heresy of Ikhnaton; for Harmhab, in praising King Ikhnaton, states that he owes his kingdom to Amonc (8 8); furthermore, the gods of Heliopolis - Horus, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, and Hathor-are mentioned. As Amon is not erased in the tomb, this, with the mention of the other gods, would indicate that the tomb was constructed under Ikhnaton's weak successors, after the resumption of the Amon- worship, at a time when the commemoration of Harm- hab's favor under Ikhnaton was not yet a political faux pas. But this is not certain. *It originally stood in Sakkara, but has been ruthlessly destroyed. The few fragments which have survived are now in six different museums. bSee my remarks, Zeitschrift fiJr agyptische Sprache, 38,47 ff. cThis has little or no bearing on the date of the event depicted in the relief, but only on the date of the execution of the relief.

He was the descendant of an old nomarchical house at Alabastron- polis. Rising from such beginnings, throughout the pre- carious reigns of Ikhnaton's successors, Harmhab skilfully maintained himself, and gradually gained a position of such power that by conciliating the priestly party of Amon, which was then again in the ascendant, he finally succeeded in seizing the throne. Thus, after their long struggle with the Aton heresy, we see the Amonite priests seating a second Pharaoh on the throne, as they had seated Thutmose 111.

After the celebration of a feast in Luxor, the king proceeds northward, to restore the temples of the gods- an interesting indication of the destructive work of Ikhnaton's reform, in abolishing the old cults. Thus the old order and, particularly, the unchecked domination of Amon are restored. The calendar of feasts was immediately resumed and before he left Thebes, he celebrated the Feast of Ptah in his Theban temple.

The edict contains the practical legislation of Harmhab by means of which he intended to prevent the oppressive abuses connected with the collection of taxes from the com- mon people, who were continually robbed and impoverished by the fiscal officers. This legislation consists of a series of enactments, each of the following form: a) Statement of the abuse as it existed before this legis- lation and the king's displeasure at it. b) Statement of a hypothetical commission of the offense by the officials concerned. c) Declaration of the penalty to be inflicted. 46. A very interesting question is whether these enact- ments have preserved on the stela the form and language of the original edict in the royal archives.

These reliefs form the most important document surviving from Seti 1's reign, being practically our only source for his wars. Unfortunately, their function was a religious one; they furnish us a series of scenes presenting the wars of Seti I in their religious aspect, accompanied by a few meager explanatory inscriptions annexed to the principal actors in each scene. These scenes, like the Annals of Thutmose 111, again illustrate the nature of the compact between the pharaoh and his god : on the one hand, the god grants the Pharaoh the might which prevails over all the nations; on the other, the Pharaoh offers to the god the captives and the plunder thus gained. According to these scenes, the wars of Seti have but one aspect, and that is religious. Even in the arrangement of the scenes on the wall this is evident.

They have been often published, and a state- ment of the publications will be found inserted in each scene (Fig. r). But none of the publications meets the demands of modern epigraphic accuracy. I arranged all the inscriptions as given by the several publications in parallel columns, and checked these to some extent by photographs; but my photographs were unfor- tunately made after the lower row was again encumbered by dCbris. What purports to be an accurate publication of the inscriptions collated with photographs is given by Guieysse (Recwil, XI, 52-77). I collated over half of Guieysse's pub- lication, and found it so excessively inaccurate that it was useless to insert its vari- ants, and I did not employ it further.

At the two extreme ends, as far from the door as possible, are the battles and marches of the war in distant lands; moving toward the door follow the capture and deportation of prisoners, the arrival in Egypt, the presentation of prisoners and spoil to Amon, and finally on either side of the door itself the slaying of captive princes, who are thus sacrificed in the temple by the king himself in the presence of Amon. 81. The only date in these reliefs is that of the year I, which occurs only with the reliefs of the Shasu campaign. It is absurd to suppose that Seti I[ completed a war with the Libyans, a campaign against the Shasu, the conquest of Palestine and some of southern Syria, and a war with the Hittites, and finally accomplished the return to Thebes, all in one year. In the opinion of the present writer, the arrangement above described indicates at least two great periods of war, each made by the artist to culminate in a human sacrifice before Amon.\" The first (east of the door, Scenes 1-11) is a war in the year against the Shasu, followed by a *This does not overlook the fact that the geographical list accompanying each sacrificial scene is identically the same.

The method pursued is exactly that of Thutmose 111 in his conquest of 130 years before (11,396)) viz., first to gain control of the Phoenician coast, and thor- oughly establish connection with Egypt by sea, so that re- inforcements and supplies for the next campaign might land at one of the Phcenician harbors from which as a base he could move upon the interior of Syria, especially the Orontes alley.^ From the coast the war was now carried inland and northward between the Lebanons, where the Egyptians met the Hittites for the first time in battle.\" It aProfessor G. A. Smith discovered a monument showing Seti I worshiping Amon and Mut in the Hauran, in 1901, at \"Tell-esh-Shih%b9' (Athen~um, July 6, 1901 ; Acad6mie des Inscriptions, October 18, 1901). But see 0 140. bThat Seti follows the method of Thutmose I11 is evident at every step. His &st campaign, like that of Thutmose 111, is through southern Palestine; then, like Thutmose 111, he moves northward through Palestine and subdues the Lebanon. Before Thutmose I11 can move upon Kadesh, he secures the Phcenician coast (fifth campaign), and attacks Kadesh the next season. It can be no accident that the campaign of Seti's first year subdues Lebanon and the Phoenician coast, while the (undated) campaign west of the door shows him in the Hittite country on the Orontes. The undated Hittite campaign here clearly bears the same relation to the coast campaign as in the case of Thutmose 111. cA glance at Fig. I will show that the arrangement of the wars on each side of the door strikingly indicates that they fall into two groups. One row on each side is a preliminary campaign near home, while the other rows on each side are the more important distant battles and conquests, thus: Lost Lost Kadesh Syria (without date) I Door I Libya (without date) Shasu (year I) / I Hittites (without date) I I We thus get two groups of wars: (I) Shasu-Syrian wars; (2) Libyan-Hittite wars.

I. In harmony with the supposition of several cam- paigns in Asia is the fact that Seti numbered his campaigns, or at least began to do so. Furthermore, on returning from the campaign of the year I, a rebellion is announced to him, as in the case of Thutmose IV (11, 826) for example, calling for a further campaign. A stela,\" erected in the Ptah- temple at Karnak in his first year after his return from the first campaign, runs thus: side of the door; on the left-hand side it is probable, for only the Shasu war is dated, and he returns from that war (Scene 8) by land, of course, whereas he would more probably return by sea (as did Thutrnose 111), had he pushed on directly from the Shasu war into Syria, and gained possession of the Ph~nician coast. If, therefore, each row represents a different war, Seti fought at least four Asiatic campaigns (besides the Libyan war), of which one is in the south and three in the north. \"It must not be forgotten that, with the exception of the scene of the capture of Kadesh (Scene 16, Fig. I), the entire uppermost row of Seti's reliefs (that is, about one-third of them) is lost. As the capture of Kadesh shows, this uppermost row dealt with his northernmost advance inland. We may therefore have lost in this row full corroboration of the northern advance claimed in the lists. references to Seti's conquests are few in number: (I) The Wadi Halfa Stela (SQ 157 ff.).

According to Seti's lists (5 I 14), he advanced north- ward along the coast past Simyra and Ullaza, but the upper row of reliefs, which contained the northernmost conquests,d has unfortunately been lost, and we are unable to control the lists or trace this coast march in detail. If Seti really reached Simyra and Ullaza, it was only the intervening mountains on the east which prevented a collision with the Hittites. 93. Having secured the coast,\" as did his great ancestor, Thutmose 111, Seti returned home with his plunder. He was now certain of a harbor for his sea connection with Syria on the next campaign-a connection which would greatly facilitate future operations in the North. In Fortress 94.

The most important item in this scene is the long inscription (8 IOI), which informs us of the reason of Seti's chastisement of the Shasu. It was reported to him that the Bedwin (Shasu) were making common cause against the Palestinians (Kharu), and that this invasion had resulted in the complete overthrow of all authority in Palestine. That these Bedwin are the Khabiric of the Amarna Letters there can be no doubt. The conditions which confronted Seti I in Palestine are exactly those which we should expect in view of what we learn from the letters of Abdkhiba of Jerusalem. There is also further evidence of the same conditions, in the tomb of Harmhab (55 10 ff.). The at- tempt of the Hebrews to gain a footing in Palestine is un- doubtedly involved in the larger movement of the Bedwin, which Seti here records. @For bibliography, see Fig. I, to which may be added Brugsch, Geographische Inschriften, I, Pi. 48. bThe prince who marches behind the Pharaoh whose name is lost ($102 infra), has been identified by Wiedemann with the crown prince of Scene 13; for which there is no evidence, and against which there is conclusive evidence.

This appearance of Ramses with his father was therefore not necessarily in his father's first year, as has been so often assumed. 124. Furthermore, a close examination of the accom- panying figures will show, first, that this scene is no proof that Ramses ever appeared with his .father in battle at all; and, second, that Ramses was not the first heir to Seti's thr0ne.b Behind the Libyan chief whom Seti hurls backward stands an Egyptian prince (Fig. 4, broken lines), facing toward the left, and watching, or possibly taking part in, the conflict. Behind Seti stands Prince Ramses (Fig. 3, dotted lines), facing toward the right, and likewise watching the conflict. Fig. 4 cannot also be Ramses, for he could not appear twice in the same scene. Its accompanying inscriptionc is as follows : \" Hereditary prince, first king's-son, of his body ,\" in which, unfortunately, the name is wanting; where it could have stood before its disappearance is a question, for the skirt of the prince projects under the titles, and the name must therefore have been pushed to aThus Maspero (Struggle of the Nations, 369, n. 3) concludes that Seti I married Ramses 11's mother, Tuya, under Harmhab, and (ibid., 387, n. 5) that Seti I could not have reigned longer than fifteen to twenty years (possibly only twelve or fifteen), because Ramses I1 appears \"as a stripling in the campaign of Seti's first year.\" b.4 full discussion of these questions by the present writer will be found in Zeitschrifl fur agyptische Sprache, 37, 130-39, from which the accompanying figures are taken. cIt is very faint and has been overlooked in Champollion, Monuments, 297, 2, and in Rosellini, Monumenti Storici, 54, 2; the only publication containing it is Champollion, Notices descriptives, 99.

But a further examination of this scene discloses the fact that this figure of Ramses' elder brother (Fig. 4) is not original and does not belong where it stands. The first glance shows that the contracted space between the chariot wheel (belonging to the next scene to the right) and the leg of the falling Libyan is too narrow for another figure, and the artist has barely been able to squeeze the prince in. Thus he is as much in one scene as the other, an anomalous arrangement! He stands with fan upraised in his right hand, as if to smite the falling Libyan. The fan runs directly across the vertical line of text! It is difficult to say where the right arm is; it seems to have been raised, and it may be that he was seizing his father's foe, as his father is doing. Passing through the fan, the large column of text extends down through the prince's head and body, to the bottom. It is clear, therefore, that at some time after Seti had com- pleted these reliefs his eldest son had himself inserted here, as taking part in Seti's Libyan campaign. It is clear also that someone desired his removal, for his figure has been rudely chiseled away. Champollion speaks of himb as a \"prince martel6 et surcharg6 avec debris de 16gende\" (his titles follow), showing that also his accompanying inscrip- tion has been hammered out. The person to whom the figure of the eldest son would be most unwelcome, and who aThere is now no trace of it there, owing to a large fissure in the stone.

We are cer- tainly correct in attributing the mutilation to him. More- over, it is quite certain that he did this in order to have the figure of himself inserted in the same scene, for his own figure (Fig. 3, dotted lines) is not original to this scene. 126. In the first place, we notice in Fig. 3, as in Fig. 4, the narrowness of the space into which the prince's figure has been squeezed, so that his left foot passes through the feather of the fallen Libyan, whom Seti is trampling, and his left hand collides with the other feather. Further, we again notice a column of text extending down through the prince's head into his body.\" Ramses stands with right hand raised palm outward, as usual in salutation, and carry- ing his fan vertically before him in the left hand. A joint in the masonry has obliterated shoulders and face. The accompanying text is partly in one scene and partly in the next. It is as follows: \"Prince (rp . ty), king's-son, crown prince, of his body, his beloved, Ramses.\" The historical con- clusions to be derived from this text will be taken up later. 127. A closer inspection of Ramses' figure shows that, in having himself inserted here, he at the same time improved the opportunity to efface another figure, which we will call X, over which his own has been cut. The motives for this second effacement are undoubtedly the same as for the first, and X was therefore Ramses' elder brother. But, as the elder brother has already been once effaced in this scene, we should expect that this second occurrence of his figure be- longed to another scene, and such is clearly the case. Under Ramses' figure appears a second pair of feet striding in the aThese signs are so clear that they were copied by Rosellini, but in his publi- cation (Monumenti Storici, 54, 2) he has shifted the column above too far to the right."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"64 NINETEENTH DYNASTY: SET1 I [g 128 opposite direction (the left ; see broken lines) ; behind Ramses is the front point of a skirt; behind him is a third arm; across his figure is a quivera with the opening to the left; above him is a fanb, with the tip of the feather turned to the left.\" All these belong, of course, to the figure X (broken lines), facing to the left. A comparison of X with the prince in Fig. 5 shows clearly that X was striding in the same way after the chariot behind which he is. Especially characteristic are his left foot poised for the next step, the arm hanging down in front, and the fan over the shoulder. X therefore belongs to the scene to the left, representing Seti's triumphant return (Scene 14) from the Libyan war, riding in his chariot and driving his prisoners before him, like the prince following Seti in his return from the first Syrian war (Fig. 5). This is what we should expect; be- fore Ramses' interference, the figure of his elder brother appeared once in each of the two scenes: the battle with the Libyans (Fig. 4) and the return (Fig. 3). Ramses preferred to appear in the battle and had himself inserted facing the right. 128. But if the figure of Ramses is a later insertion, that of his brother (X) is equally so; the latter's fan, quiver, and indeed his whole figure cut directly into the original column of text, as the figure of Ramses does. X has had himself inserted here. It is this fact which renders certain the identity of X and Seti's eldest son (Fig. 4); both desired' \"The quiver was always carried on the left side, with the opening in front; hence in this case belonging to a person facing the left. bThe fan was always borne with the tipof the feather pointing toward the front, as in Ramses' figure and in Fig. 5. cThe feet and the quiver were seen and copied by Rosellini and Champollion, and appear in their publications (Rosellini, Monunzenti Storici, 54; Champollion, Mon~~ments, 297, z), but seem to have remained unnoticed since."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"3 1311 KARNAK RELIEFS 65 to appear in Seti's Libyan war, both were the object of Ramses' hatred, and both were effaced by him. 129. TO recapitulate, we find thus far three stages on this wall : I. An uninterrupted column of text on each side of the battle scene; and no princes in either it or the scene of the return. 2. Seti's eldest son inserts his own figure at the right of the battle scene and at the right of the return. 3. Prince Ramses effaces the figure of his elder brother in both places, but over that of his brother in the return scene he inserts his own figure, so facing as to belong to the battle scene. 130. There are evidences of a similar insertion (Fig. 6) at the top of this same wall, on a few isolated blocks at the left of the capture of Kadesh (Scene 16). Here we see a figure (Fig. 6, broken lines) with uplifted arm, like that of Ramses in the battle scene, and wearing a quiver. Before this figure are the arms of a captive bound behind his back, showing that the man follows the king's chariot (as in Fig. s), behind which, however, the king leads a line of captives. But this figure is likewise a later insertion, for a column of text extends down through it, and the head of the Syrian, who has fallen beneath the chariot, projects into the skirt. It is impossible to decide whether this figure is that of ~amses or his brother. 131. The historical results to be drawn from the above facts are not numerous, but are important. It is clear, in the first pIace, that these reliefs offer no evidence whatever that Ramses I1 ever took part in any campaign of his father, of whatever year.

As far as these reliefs are concerned, Ramses might even have been born after Seti's accession. The fact alone that Ramses was obliged to insert his own figure in his father's battle scenes, in order to appear there at all, of course creates a strong suspicion that he had nothing to do with the events they depict;\" and thus Seti's reign may have been considerably longer than is usually attributed to him. He was about to celebrate his jubilee when he died, having left an obelisk unfinished, so that it was completed by his son, Ramses I1 (5 5 544 ff .). If his father reigned two and a half years, Seti's jubilee might have fallen in the middle of his twenty-eighth year. But as he did not live to complete the obelisk and celebrate the jubilee, he may have died a few years before the jubilee, after a reign of over twenty years. A greater maximum is improbable, for the reason that Setau, viceroy of Kush in Seti I's second year,b is known also in Ramses 11's thirty-eighth year, which, if Seti reigned twenty years, makes Setau's term of office at least fifty-seven years-an extraordinary tenure of office. For the extensive building which Seti I accomplished, twenty years are none too long a reign.

Seti's advance between the Lebanons necessarily brings him into collision with the Hittites, and we see him here in the first battle between Egyptians and ' Hittites known to us. Unfortunately, no details of the conflict are given. aMiiller sees in this city the Kadesh on the Orontes (Asien und Europa, 217); but there seem to me conclusive reasons against this identification: (I) The relief shows a city on rocky heights, while Kadesh is in a low valley surrounded by moats (Muller thinks this due to the artist's looseness). (2) It is said to be \"of the land of Amor.\" Now, Kadesh on the Orontes clearly did not belong to the land of the Amorites (see Meyer, Festschrift fiiv Georg Ebers, 69), and the purpose of the addition, \"of the land of Amor,\" is precisely to distinguish the Galilean Kadesh from its more powerful neighbor in the north. (3) Muller's argument that Seti failed to capture the city, which would be impossible if it were a small Galilean town, is refuted by the fact that fb is used by Ramses I1 of a whole list of captured cities (Lepsius, Denkmaler, 111, 156, with metathesis b)). bSee 8 148, 1. 8; and Champollion, Notices descriptives, 11, 76, 77.

The first inscription, dated in the year 9, narrates the successful completion of the well and also the erection of a temple and establishment of a settlement at this station. The heretofore unnoticed motive for all this elaborate equip- ment is stated in the king's words to be (1. 13) : \"on behalf of my beautiful house in Abydos.\" This is, of course, Seti's famous temple at Abydos, which he says was erected \"by oracle of the god\" (1. 13). It is to endow the king's mortuary service in this temple that he is now restoring communications with the eastern gold regions. He therefore prays, as he worships for the first time in the new temple at the newly established station on the road to the mines, that the god may instruct coming generations of kings and princes to respect his establishment, presumably both at Abydos, and at the new station by which communication with the source of revenue for Abydos was to be maintained. This explains why the next inscription of nineteen lines, the longest of the three, is devoted almost exclusively to warnings and curses addressed to those who may in future interfere with the arrangements by which Seti hopes to perpetuate the income of his Abydos temple from the gold mines. Hence at its close (1. 19) he calls down the vengeance of Osiris, Isis, and Horus upon the person, wife, and children of any official of the necropolis (of course, at Abydos) who shall disregard (\"avert the face from\") \"the command of Osiris.\" But, notwithstanding these solemn adjurations of Seti, he had aReclleil, XIII, 79, and PI.

When all is done, Ramses addresses his deceased father, calling attention to all these pious works for his father's welfare in the hereafter (11. 75-93), and showing how it will be to his father's interest to ensure unbroken con- tinuance of these favors, by inducing the gods, among whom he now is, to grant Ramses a long reign. Ramses assures his father that his (Seti's) mortuary offerings shall be main- tained as long as he (Ramses) continues on the throne (11. 93-98).

As Nebunnef was High Priest, this great feast of Amon is naturally recorded in his tomb. It is the same feast, celebrated in the month Hathor, by Thutmose IIIa on his return from his first campaign (11, 54 I, SO), and, this being the first celebration of it in Ramses' reign, it naturally called him to Thebes, whose powerful priesthood he could not fail to conciliate by appearing at their temple in person on such an important occasion. 258.

The speech of Ramses, which merges into the long inscription itself, is of historical importance, and begins the following translation : Speech of Ramses 259. 18Utterance of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Usermare- Setepnere (Ramses 11) in the presence of his father, Osiris: \"I champion thee, Wike thy son, Horus; I have done according to FisIb doing.

In the first of these we find Ramses, after having pushed his Phoenician boundary northward to Beyrut, marching down the Orontes against the Hittites at Kadesh. The remarkable battle which followed was without bene- ficial result. The second period finds Ramses battling for the recovery of Palestine, where there had arisen a general revolt, undoubtedly incited by the Hittites. This revolt suppressed, the third period finds him again in the Hittite country, conquering Naharin as far north as Tunip, where his progress was such that the Hittites were willing to resign all projects of further conquest in Syria and negotiate a aOr: \"They (the reports) were agreeable to [the heart of the king].\""},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"124 NINETEENTH DYNASTY: RAMSES I1 [i 295 permanent compact in a treaty, in arranging which no men- tion of the boundarya adopted is made. 295.

Marching through Pale~tine,~ and along the Phanician coast road, Ramses passed into Amor, where he formed his van of picked men, on the \"shore in the Zund of Anzor\" (Poem, 1. 18). Thereupon he left the coast, perhaps march- ing up the valley of the Litany, and reached the last elevation on the east side of the Orontes, where the high valley (the Buk% a) drops to the level of the plain around Kadesh, about a day's march south of it.\" Here he camped (Poem, 11.

Thus the Asiatics, with a strong fortress on their right for refuge in case of defeat, by their remarkably skilful maneuvering, have gained a ' position on Ramses' right flank, which, properly utilized, means his destruction. 300. As the division of Amon comes up and is settling in camp around the tent of Ramses (Reliefs, $331), an Egyp- tian scout brings in two of the enemy's scouts, who are beaten (Reliefs, $ 330) into confessing the proximity of the foe (Record, § 321). Thoroughly alarmed, Ramses com- mands the vizier to order up the troops from the south of Shabtuna ($324), and the vizier, besides sending a horse- man to hasten them, probably goes also himself in a chariot (Record, $ 324; Reliefs, $8 333 f.).

On the east the enfolding wing of the enemy is evidently weakest. Ramses did not hesitate an instant, but immedi- ately rallied his household troops and charged into the invaders of his camp, in the endeavor to cut his way out, to rejoin his southern divisions. This unexpected onset gained him a moment's respite, during which he perceived how the enemy was massed against him on the south, and he there- fore turned against the enemy's thin line on their extreme right, before they should have time to strengthen it after their rapid advance northward. He charged eastward into the scanty opposing line of chariots so impetuously that he drove them into the Orontes north of the city.\" In so doing he forsook his camp, which immediately fell into the hands of the enemy. It is unquestionably the rich plunder in Ramses' camp which diverts the Hittites for the moment and saves ~akses from being pushed into the river in his turn. 302.

Since reading my account of the incident, Eduard Meyer suggests to me that these troops may be reinforcements from the coast, which have landed at one of the Phcenician harbors, far enough south to be in Amor. It is not possible that these are infantry reinforcements belonging to the troops south of Shabtuna, although they are spoken of as arriving \"from Amor,\" for the text mentioning them clearly distinguishes them from the divisions of Re and Ptah. But the course of the battle and the disposition of the troops are from this point quite uncertain. Ramses' desperate assault with his bodyguard is the sub- ject and the raison d'lre of all these documents, and they depict the whole victory as consisting in this one heroic incident.

The texts are of two kinds: hieroglyphic and hieratic. The hieroglyphic text has been found in three copies on temple walls: at Luxor (Rougb, Inscriptions hi&roglyphiques, IV, 232-48; Brugsch, Recueil de monuments, 11, 40-42; lower ends, Daressy, Revue Lgyptologique, IX, 58); Karnak (Rougb, ibid., IV, 206-31; Brugsch, ibid., 11, 29-32; Mariette, Karnuk, 48-51); and Abydos (Mariette, Abydos, 11, 4., 5). All these originals are excessively fragmentary, especially the one at Abydos, of which only the lower ends of the vertical lines have survived. Of the publications the Karnak copies of Brugsch and Mariette are so incomplete as to be unusable, and RougB's copies are neither accurate nor exhaustive. Besides the above publications, I had a collation of Abydos by Borchardt, and photographs of Karnak also by Borchardt, for which I am indebted to the Berlin dictionary. Of the hieratic text there are two papyri, both belonging to the same roll; Papyrus Raifet, containing only one page of ten lines (published by Rougb, Recueil, I, and Papyrus Sallier I11 (select Papyrus I, 24-34), containing eleven pages. Raifet precedes Sallier 111, but the beginning is lost. I arranged all the texts in parallel columns, and this quadruplex was then carefully collated with the original Papyrus Sallier 111, in the British Museum, by Professor Erman. The texts were once similarly put together by E. de Rouge and published by J. de Roug6 (Revue &gypto- logique, 111-IX), but without the Abydos copy, the lower part of Luxor, or a collation of the original Papyrus Sallier 111. The addition of Abydos has filled a consid- erable number of lacunae, and the collation of Sallier I11 has likewise cleared up many difficulties. As a long passage is misplaced in the hieratic text, and it lacks also the beginning (ten lines), it was necessary to adopt the line numbering from the hieroglyphic for which the Luxor text was chosen.

Shabtuna was therefore on the Orontes a few miles south of Kadesh.

BThis channel is, of course, that of Orontes, the Hittite king having previonsIy led his forces from the west to the east side, now goes back to the west side, in order to get around the city, while keeping it between him and the Egyptians. Being a city which he commanded, he could, of course, go through it, and emerge for his attack on the south side, unless prevented by lack of gates at the proper points: But this would probably have exposed his issuing forces to the view of the marching division of Re, as the city wall was necessarily clearly in view across the moat.

A relief at Karnak represents the storming of the city of Askalon, and the accompanying inscription refers to its rebellion. Of course, Askalon did not revolt alone, but must have been in league with the other cities of Palestine. 354. In the relief we see the king in his chariot charging the bearded defenders, lined up outside a battlemented city, which is located on an elevation. The storming ladders are up, and an Egyptian officer is demolishing the city gate with an ax, while the inhabitants appear on the walls, beseeching mercy. By the city is the following inscription: 355. The wretched city (dmy), which his majesty captured, when it rebelled, Askalon ('-s-k-rw-n'). It (the city) says: \"It is joy to be subject to thee, and delight to cross thy boundaries. Take thou the heritage, that we may speak of thy valor in all unknown countries.\" Over the king's horses appears the usual glorification of his valor. 11. RECONQUEST OF NORTHERN PALESTINE 356. By the eighth year Ramses has reached northern Palestine again, and captures the cities of western Galilee. aThe place of this siege in Rarnses 11's wars is uncertain; but as western Galilee revolted in his eighth year, it is not unlikely that the revolt of Askalon is to be connected with that of west Galilee. Indeed, one name in the list of the eighth year may be Askalon (Champollion, Notices descriptives, 11, 871, I, No. 2 -1 r-) The date \"IXth year\" (Maspero, Struggle of the Nations, 400) for the capture of Askalon is without any documentary support. bRelief and inscription on the exterior of the south wall of the great hypostyle hall at Karnak; Champollion, Notices descriptives, 11, 195 =Lepsius, Denkmaler, 111, 145, C."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"0 3571 THE ASIATIC WAR I59 The only document is a lista showing rows of battlemented cities from which Egyptian officers drive prisoners.

The revolt of these regions, evident from the Ramesseum fragment just translated, was there- fore undoubtedly late in the Asiatic war, and probably had something to do with Ramses' willingness to make peace, later sealed by a treaty of alliance with the Hittites in the year 21, seventeen years after the beginning of the war. aThe date \"year 12,\" usually read here is impossible; it is not supported by any of the three copies. bOn a colossus at Karnak (Mariette, Karnak, 38) and another at Abydos (Mariette, Abydos, 11, 2).

TREATY WITH THE RITTITESa 367. After possibly fifteen years of warfare in Syria, Ramses I1 consents to a peace with the Hittites.

It is not only a treaty of alliance, but also a treaty of peace, and the war evidently continued until the negotiations for the treaty began, which could hardly have been earlier than a year before the date of the arrival of the messengers in Egypt. They reached Egypt in late winter or early spring (twenty-first of Tybi), somewhere around the first of February; and the preceding summer may have seen the last of the hostilities.

After a reference to the treaty of peace, the king of the Hittites is represented as reverting to their defeat by Ramses, and he apparently proposes that they proceed to Egypt. This they do, bringing rich gifts, and the news soon reaches Ramses, who is filled with delight, and prepares to receive his visitors; the chiefs of Kheta, Kode, and \"the chiefs of every land.\" He seems to be concerned for their arrival in the uncertainties of winter travel, and offers an oblation to Sutekh on their behalf. When finally, with the escort he had sent to meet them, they arrive in safety, they appear with the Hittite king's eldest daughter at their head, the troops of Egypt \"mingling with the foot and horse of Kheta.\" A great feast seems to have been immediately held, where those who had once faced each other in combat now eat and drink together, while the Asiatic princes ap- proach the Pharaoh in audience. 417. It is probably at this feast that the Hittite princess thus brought to Egypt was married to Ramses. The his- torical character of this marriage is further evidenced by the colossus of Ramses I1 at Tanis, attached to which is a statue of a queen bearing the inscription:\" aMariette, Reczleil, IX, 13; RougB, Inscriptions hiiroglyphiques, 74; Petrie, Tanis, I, 24, P1. 5, 36 B."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"184 NINETEENTH DYNASTY: RAMSES I1 [9 418 \"Great king's-wife, mistress (hn-t) of the Two Lands: Mat- nefrure (M \"t-nfr'w-R C),a daughter of the great chief of Kheta.\" This inscription, therefore, renders unquestionable the main facts of the following narrative on the Marriage Stela.

To this invitation the Abu Simbel stela (QQ 415-24) makes no reference, and the whole ten-line poem, being of course only the fancy of a court poet to embellish his description of the glories of Ramses' capitol, to which the Hittite visitors came, may have no foundation in fact.

COPTOS STELA^ 427. This document recorded the visit to Egypt of a number of the Asiatic princes bearing gifts for the Pharaoh. It is a visit precisely like that of the Hittite king (5 410) and his neighbors, and reference is made to \"his other daughter,\" as if another princess were being brought to Ramses in marriage.

The pious priests attribute both the visit and the gifts, to the gods (1. g), and particularly, among the gods of Egypt, to Ptah, precisely as is done in the Blessing of Ptah in referring to the visit of the Hittite king with his daughter (5 410, 1. 25). 428. 3b [chiefs ofIC all countries conveying their tribute, of much gold, of much silver, of all costly stones, 5 very many captives of Keshkesh (KS-kS), many captives 6[ofl in writing for King Ramses (11) 7 many Ferds] of goats, many herds of small cattled before his other daughter 8 Ramses 11, given life, to Egypt for the second time.

It is clear that the visit of the Hittite king to Egypt was for the purpose of personally presenting his daughter to Ramses I1 in marriage. This marriage made a great im- pression upon the people, and the story of it circulated among them as the introduction to a legend which had grown up from another incident closely connected with the marriage.

The chief of Kheta sent in like manner to Egypt, desiring that Khonsu be brought to Kheta for the purpose of healing his daughter, the younger sister of Ramses' queen, Matnefrure. This was done,b and although no contemporary record of the incident has survived, it gradually found place among the folk-tales of the time. 430. Some eight or nine hundred years later, in Persian or early Greek times, the priests of Khonsu at Thebes deter- mined to record the story to the greater glory of their god. They put the current tale into language as archaic as they could command, and engraved it upon a stela, which is now our source for the document.\" In doing this they evidently found some difficulty. The current version, of course, spoke of the king only as Ramses or Ramses-Meriamon. The priests, desiring to lend an official air to their stela, attempted to prefix to the king's name his full titulary, and in doing so used that of Thutmose IV! Nor was their knowledge sufficient to correct the errors or remove the absurdities of the popular version of the story.

NUBTAN WARS AND REFERENCES TO NORTHERN WARS 448. The temples of Nubia contain many references of an indefinite character to Ramses I17s Nubian wars, from which it is impossible to gain any idea of them, the localities conquered, or the date of the campaigns. These references are often so mingled with those of the northern wars against the Asiatics and Libyans that it is not possible to separate and classify them all. They are continued through the temples of Egypt a1so.b Of the Libyan war we learn little more than the fact, though the Tanis Stela furnishes an important hint of an alliance of the Libyans with the Sher- den and a naval battlec (i491). To our knowledge of aThe round trip consumed 34 months (I year and 5 months each way, 1. 17), and he had remained in Bekhten 45 months (1. z4), a total absence of 79 months, or 6 years and 7 months. As he left Egypt in the ninth month of the year 26 (1. 13, date of wise man's return to summon him), if that date be late in the year 26, an absence of 6 years and 7 months would put his return in the year 33, as the priestly author of the inscription has done. bScenes showing Ramses sacrificing foreign captives of the north and south are found in practically all his temples; e. g., at the Ramesseum (Lepsius, Denk- maler, 111, 159, b), where we hd beside the scene the words: \"Slaying their chiefs, making them as if they had not been;\" and again: \"The chiefs of the countries of the south and the north, whom his majesty carried away as living captives.\" On hi$ obelisks also there are very general references to his wars; thus at Tanis (Petrie, Tanis, I, VII, No. 45) he is called one, \"capturing Nubia by his valor, wasting Tehenu;\" and \"great in valor like a bull in Retenu;\" again (ibid., No. 47): \"car- rying off the chiefs of Retenu as living prisoners, crushing the land of Kheta.\" At Kurna, in the temple, some divinity addressed Ramses thus (Piehl, Inscriptions, I, 145 A): \"--- the gods of Khenthennofer and Wawat k their ~wmes, and lands; the chiefs of God's-Land, who fashion every splendid costly stone for their son, Ramses IZ - lapis lazuli of Tefrer, every costly stone that is in the two mountains, the products of Nun.

SOUTHERN WAR 472. This series evidently depicts particular events in Ramses II's Nubian war.

Enough of the fragmentary inscription is preserved, to show that, as in the coronations of Thutmose I11 and Harmhab, Amon appeared in public, delivered an oracle proclaiming him king, and proceeded to the palace to crown him. In all probability, therefore, the oracle and the crowning by Amon, were the regular custom at the ac- cession of every king in the Empire. Hence the innumer- able conventional references to Amon's having fixed the diadem upon the Pharaoh's head designate an actual cere- mony.

Wiedemann (Aegyptische Geschichte, 465, n. 5) evidently thinks there are two such inscriptions; one in the temple, and one in the tomb; but that given by Lepsius, Denkmaler, is certainly the same as that placed by Brugsch in the tomb of Setau.

INSCRIPTION OF BEKNEKHONSUd 561. The most important of Ramses 11's officials who has transmitted a mortuary autobiography to us, was Beknekhonsu, the High Priest of Amon.

For this, one of the most serious invasions which have ever threatened Egypt, we possess a series of four documents, which furnish a fairly full account of its course, the ensuing battle, and the resulting relief in Egypt. They are the following: I. The Great Karnak Inscription (8 5 72-92). 11. The Cairo Column (is 593-95). 111. The Athribis Stela (§ § 596-601). IV. The Hymn of Victory (8 8 602-1 7). 570. These sources enable us to see the already aged Merneptah facing the evil conditions on his Libyan frontier, inherited from the decades of neglect which concluded his great father's reign. The Libyans have for years past been pushing into and occupying the western Delta.\" They pressed in almost to the gates of Memphis, eastward to the district of Heliopolis, and southward to the two oases nearest the Fayilm. Worse than this, they had made a coalition aGol6nischeff's interesting and suggestive letter (Zeitschrift fur agyptische Sprache, 40, 101-6) draws geographical data from a new papyrus in his possession, on the basis of which he would place this immigration and invasion (as well as those under Ramses 111) south of the FayQm near Ehnas. His arguments are not with- out force, but the conclusion seems to me to be refuted by the statement that this invasion and the battle which repelled it occurred in the \"western rwd\" (Karnak Inscription, 1. 30, where \"western\" is omitted, and Athribis stela, 1. 7). Rwd is a term used only of the Delta, the two halves of which are called the eastern and western nud (Spiegelberg, Rechnungen). The invasions under Ramses I11 were also in the \"western rwd\" (IV, 405). See also Harris, 10, 8 (IV, 224). Further- more, the improbability that the Libyans would enter Egypt by way of the northern oases, going around the south side of the Fayom, to reach the region of Memphis, is evident. 238"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"9 5711 LIBYAN - MEDITERRANEAN INVASION 239 with the maritime peoples of the Mediterranean, who now poured into the Delta from Sardinia on the west to Asia Minor on the east. The mention of these peoples in these documents is the earliest appearance of Europeans in litera- ture, and has always been the center of much study and interest.\" With the sympathy, if not the direct assistance of the Kheta, the Libyan king, Meryey, put himself at the head of these combined allies and invaded the Delta, bring- ing his wives and belongings, and apparently intending a permanent occupation. Some time during the first half of the tenth month (late in March), in Merneptah's fifth year, a messenger reached him with the news. Rallying his forces immediately, Merneptah met the enemy on the third of the eleventh month (about April 15) at Perire in the western Delta, and in six hours' fighting routed their com- bined forces with immense slaughter. He pursued them from Perire to the rise of the Libyan desert, called the \" Mozknt of the Horns of the Earth.\" 571. It is difficult to understand the exact interrelation of the numbers given in the Great Karnak Inscription and the Athribis Stela, but over 9,000 of the enemy were slain, possibly as many more taken prisoners, while many horses and cattle, and vast numbers of weapons were captured. The Libyan king was forced to ignominious flight, his camp, his wives, and his personal belongings falling into the hands aThe layman has long been misled regarding this event by such titles for it as \"Invasion of the Greeks,\" although there is now no doubt that the early peoples of southern Europe participated in this invasion.' Since the study of Sardinian art by Perrot and Chipiez, as Miiller has shown, we must accept the Sherden as Sardinians; the Teresh may then equally well be the Etruscans (Tyrsenoi), and the Shekelesh might be the Sikeli (if S be an ethnic termination in these western names; but see IV, 59). Maspero has suggested Sagalassos in Asia Minor. The Ekwesh are not impossibly the Achseans, and from Asia Minor are the Luka or Lycians.

After setting fire to the camp, the Egyp- tians carried the plunder in triumph to the king, who viewed the trophies of the dead, the prisoners, and the spoil. He then returned home, and in the royal palace, probably at Memphis, he delivered a triumphal address, to which the court responded with acclamation. The people of the Delta, on hearing the news, break out into rejoicing that peace and safety are restored to them. I. GREAT KARNAK INSCRIPTION a 572. This, one of the longest documents preserved on the temple walls of Egypt, gives the fullest account which has survived to us of the great victory of Merneptah over the Libyans. The prominence of Ptah in the narrative be- trays the Memphite origin of the document, but the original which doubtless once existed in Memphis has now perished. 573. The document does not offer us any idea of the aA long inscription of originally eighty lines, engraved on the inside (west) of the eastern wall connecting the main Karnak temple with Pylon VII (Baedeker's plan), the northernmost of the southern pylons. The upper ends of the lines have lost the space of one course of masonry, equivalent to about four to five words. The text, noted first by Champollion, was partially published by Lepsius (Denk- maler, 111, 199, a; only 11. 44-77 and list of names, Text, 111, 43); Brugsch then purposed to publish the first half, omitted by Lepsius, and inserted 11. 8-43 in his Geographische Inschriften, 11, PI. 25 (not P1. 85, as stated in Records of the Past, IV, 37, nor 35, as given in Maspero, Struggle of the Nations, 432). Brugsch numbered his lines I to 36, but he really omitted 11. 1-7. It was finally completely published by Diimichen (Historische Inschriften, I, 2-6), Mariette (who copies Diimichen's mistakes, Karnak, 52-55), and de Rouge' (Inscriptions hzZrogZyphiques, 179-98). None of these publications is very exact; both Lepsius and Brugsch omit the lower ends of the lines, doubtless still covered in their day, without any indication of the fact. Rouge' found the upper ends of 11.36-41 (on a block redis- covered by Legrain in 1901, see 1. 36, p. 246, n. a), and properly placed them; I arranged all the publications in parallel columns, and the resulting text, while tolerably close to the original and preserving some signs now lost, was not suffi- ciently accurate. Later I secured good photographs of the inscription through the kindness of Borchardt, which added some readings of importance.

Miiller's objections (Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archeology, 1888, 147 ff.) to this rendering, it seems to me, do not take full account of the use of the word in this text. He maintains that krn.t=\"horn\" (long ago suggested by Chabas, Etudes sur l'anti- qzcitb historiqzce, 234, n. z) means simply phallus, because Athribis Stela uses it in the same place where our long text has \"phall~s,\" or interchangeably with \"pW- ks.\" But krn't is something which the Sherden and the other allies did not have (1. 54)! Moreover, it is something connected with the phallus which they did not have. As the phonetic equivalence kn't- ;I~Y is unexceptionable, it seems to me the rendering ''foreskin\" is very probable.

This is the earliest mention of Israel known to us in literature, not excluding the Hebrew Scriptures themselves. It occurs in a clear-cut strophe (# 617) of twelve lines, which forms the conclusion of the composition. This strophe opens and closes with a couplet containing a universal statement of the subjugation of foreign peoples in general, while the eight lines between are a rapid list of certain of the defeated for- eigners, among whom is Israel. The assertion of the defeat of Israel is so brief and bald that little can be drawn from it. Moreover, it is made up of conventional phrases, applied also to other peoples. Much has been made of the second phrase, \"his seed (pr ' t) is not.\" It has been applied to the seeda of Israel and referred to the slaying of the male chil- dren of the Israelites by the Egyptians! But this phrase is aThe treatment which this phrase has received by some biblical scholars furnishes another curious example of the totally misleading use of such evidence, where it is received at second hand. Thus in the Expositor (March, 1897, 161, note) we find the statement that Spiegelberg renders this phrase (\"his seed is not\") thus: \"witbut fear\" (!). An examination shows that Spiegelberg, translating into German, quite properly rendered the phrase: \"ohne Frucht\" (\"without fruit\"). The German \"Frucht\" was then misread by the writer in the Expositor as '6Furcht\"-\"fear\"! From the Expositor this absurdity then passed into other articles and gained currency. Some of the essays on the passage are therefore to be used with the greatest caution; but see: Hommel, Neue Kirchliche Zeitschrijt, VII, 581-86; Miiller, Independent, July 9, 1896, 940; Sellin, New KircMiche Zeitschrift, VII, 502-14; Molandre, Revue des religions, September-October, 1897, Steindorff, Zeitschrift fur alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, XVI, 1896, 330-33; and Miltheilungen des Deutschen Palastinischen Vereins, 1896, 45, 46; Marshall;, Expositor, July, 1896; Petrie, Contemporary Review, May, 1896, 617-27; and Century Magazine, August, 1896; Spiegelberg, Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie, 1896, 593 ff.; Naville, Recud, XX, 32-37; Brandt, Theologische Tijd- schrift, 1896, 505-12; Fries, Sphinx, I, 208 ff.; Daressy, Revue arch6ologique, XXXIII, 263 ff.; Wiedemann, Le MusJon, XVII, 89-107; Hal6vy, Revue sJmi- tique, 1896, 285 ff.

The documents left by Roy are of the greatest im- portance as sliowing when the office of High Priest of Amon was for the first time transmitted from father to son, and thus came to be regarded as hereditary. Moreover, an examination of them discloses the fact that this arrogation of power by the High Priest of Amon took place under Merne- ptah, not at the close of the Nineteenth Dynasty, as com- monly supposed, but at the latest in the reign of Merneptah, and possibly still earlier, in the reign of Ramses 11. Roy lived in the reign of Merneptah (§ 8 628 ff .), and inherited the high priesthood of Amon from his father, Rome, hereto- fore considered his son.b Roy's father, Rome, therefore lived under Ramses 11, and must have been the successor of Bek- nekhonsuc ($ $561-68). Roy's son was named Bekne- aThe meaning of this phrase is rendered evident by an epithet applied to Ramses I1 on his Tanis stela (g 490, 1. 9), viz., \"husband of Egypt,\" meaning, of course, \"protector of Egypt.\" Hence a land may be widowed (=without a \"hzu- band,\" =without a protector), and Palestine had no protector against Egypt. bSince the above was written Wreszcinski's very useful list of the high priests of Amon has appeared (Die Hohenpriester des Amon, von W. Wreszcinski, Berlin, ~goq), in which he also makes Rome the elder, and probably the father of Roy (ibid., 14, note). CBeginning sixty years from some point in the reign of Seti I, Beknekhonsu was High Priest of Amon for twenty-seven years. This brings the close of his term to at least the sixtieth year of Ramses 11's reign, so that Rome must have succeeded him. It can hardly be an accident that one of the prophets of Amon in Ramses 11's forty-sixth year, under the high priesthood of Beknekhonsu, was named Rome (Berlin legal papyrus No. 3047; Zeitschrift fzZ7 agyptische Spmche, 1879, 1. 5)."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"B 6181 INSCRIPTIONS OF HIGH PRIEST ROY 265 khonsu;\" hence, as the name thus appears in Roy's family, he (Roy) may have been the grandson of the Beknekhonsu of Ramses 11's reign, in which case the hereditary character of the office began with Beknekhonsu. Roy survived into the reign of Seti IS; but already under Merneptah he suc- ceeded in gaining high office for his son, with prospects of succeeding to the high priesthood. According to Legrain, his statue recently found in the great Karnak cache bears the following statement: \"Le roi a donn6 que mes enfants soient rassembl6s en corporation (tribu) de mon sang, les 6tablissant parmi les prophetes qui sont sous sa direction. Moi, je suis premier prophMe dlAmon, et mon fils est 6tabli B c6t6 de moi en qualit6 de second prophete et de sous-directeur du palais du roi B l'occident de Thhbes; le fils de mon fils recevra les titres de quatr2me prophete d'Amon, de phre divin, d'offi- cient et de ~r&tre.\"~ Legrain has accepted the current conclusion that Roy was the father of Rome, and hence identifies Roy's son above, who became second prophet, with Rome. The nar- rative of Roy, however, does not give the name of his son; but it is given in the Karnak relief ($620) as Beknekhonsu, who must therefore be the son referred to on this new Karnak statue.\" aBmgsch, Thesourn, Isar. bRacwil, 27, 72. Legrain gives no teat. cAs now published (Reczreil, 27), Legrain's data furnish no evidence that Roy was the father, and Rome his son. The fact that he is able to reconstruct kom Twenty-second Dynasty statues a genealogy reaching back to a second prophet, Rome, has no hearing. We know that our Rome is called High Prie~t of Aman on contemporary monuments; hence the second prophet, Rme, who heads Lcgrain's grnealogy (Recud, 27, 73), was evidently a different person. The monuments found by Legrain, when published in erlelwo, may contain evidence that Rome was the son and Roy the father; for I admit that some difficulties attend the supposition that the reverse W;LE true: hut the evidence now accessible is certainly strongly in favor of this conclusion."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"266 NINETEENTH DYNASTY: MERNEPTAH [$619 619. This document is of importance, first, because of its place, viz., on the walls of the Karnak temple of Amon, where heretofore none but the Pharaoh's name might appear. At the east end of Pylon VIII, built by Thutmose I, was the kitchenb or refectory of the high priests of Amon. In view of the extensive household of the high priests at this time, it must have been a considerable building. In Roy's time it had fallen into ruin; and in the. reign of Merneptah (9 625) Roy rebuilt and enlarged it. On the east end of Pylon VIII, near the entrance to the building, where all who went in would see it, he left a record of his pious work, calling upon all the bakers, confectioners, and the like, who daily entered there, to remember him for it and to pray to Amon for him. To this record he prefixed a hymn of praise to Amon, which he placed in the mouth of his deceased father, Rome. Rome recounts his own long life accorded him by Amon, and adds: \"My son is in my place, my ofice is in his hand, in hereditary succession, )orever\" (1. 6). Rome is thus represented as regarding the hereditary char- acter of the office of High Priest as a matter of course; which would indicate that the beginning of the hereditary suc- cession was earlier, as indicated above (1 618). The use of the temple wall, and the restoration of one of its connected buildings by the High Priest of Amon, are significant symp- toms of the tendency which two hundred years later placed the High Priest on the throne of Egypt. aOn the east end of Pylon VIII, overlooking the sacred lake; published: Lepsius, Denkmaler, 111, 237, c; Stern, Zeitschrift fiir agyptische Sprache, XI, 74 ff.

It was not read by either Stern or Brugsch. If Lepsius has not introduced it from the neighboring adoration of Amon by Seti 11, and it actually stands in our passage, it must be a prayer for the king put into the mouth of the deceased Rome; just as the deceased Seti I is made to pray for Ramses I1 at Abydos. Our inscription in that case dates from the reign of Seti 11. The matter can be settled only by an examination of the original; but historically the reasons against reading Seti I1 are strong, for Roy would then have been High Priest through the reigns of successive kings hostile to each other, Merneptah, Amenmeses, Siptah, and Seti 11, in whose quarrels the High Priest of Amon was, of course, involved. It is not likely that the same High Priest continued under them all. cThe tense of the original permits translating all the following as a prayer until 1. 6, where the nominal sentence, \"my son is, etc.,\" cannot be optative. Hence the whole is historical, and not a prayer. Again, as both Rome and Roy are given the title High Priest of Amon, one of them must be dead; and the deceased is of course he whose son has succeeded him.

He went out to Nubia apparently in his first year, as far as Abu Simbel, to appoint Seti his new viceroy of Kush (No. I), and Neferhor the official who brought the new vice- roy out to his post, recorded his arrival at Wadi Halfa (No. 2). The \"reward\" brought by Neferhor on this oc- casion for the officials of Nubia can be nothing else than the new king's attempt to win and hold them to his support. He evidently succeeded, for in the year 3 the treasury official, Piyay, records his visit at Wadi Halfa to receive the tribute of Kush (No. 3). 640. In the same year Seti is still viceroy, recording his devotion to the king on the rocks at the first cataract (Nos. 5 and 6).

In both the graffiti (Nos. 6 and 7) commemorating Bay, there is attached to his name a relative clause: \"whom the king established in the seat of his father,\" a not uncommon state- ment, indicating that a man has inherited his father's office. Brugsch's rendering, following de Rouge, \" \" in dem er (Seti) den Konig auf den Thron seines Vaters setzte,\" is gram- matically ~ntenable;~ hence the prevailing interpretation in all the histories since de Rouge's time, that the king owed his throne to Bay, is without foundation.

The succession of the kings of the time, supposed to be against Rouge's supposition, is clearly in support of it; but the evidence either has been overlooked or has only recently been published. There is space here to note only some of the main points in the evidence. Amenmeses, the successor of Merneptah, was a usurper and persecuted the memory of Merneptah, for example at the Ramesseum, where he set his own name over that of Merneptah.\" Amen- meses was in turn treated in the same way by his successor, Siptah, who inserted his own name over that of Amenmeses 'Etude sur une sthle legyptienne, 186. bSee note on No. 7, 5 649. clbid., 187. dIndeed, there is a definite connection between the High Priest of Amon and Nubia, for he became viceroy of Nubia as his power increased (Arcnales, IV, 9). elepsius, Denkmiiler, 111, 219, 6, A; ibid., Text, 111, 130."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"276 NINETEENTH DYNASTY: SIPTAH [8 642 in a reliefa at Kurna, showing Amenmeses worshiping the Theban divinities, who are associated with Ramses I1 and Seti I, from whom Amenmeses was probably descended.

On examining the position of Seti I1 with reference to the said two kings, the evidence of his first tomb in the Valley of the Kings is conclusive. Lepsius' careful and exhaustive examinationb of the royal names in the tomb of Siptah's queen, Tewosret, shows conclusively that Seti I1 usurped this tomb.
