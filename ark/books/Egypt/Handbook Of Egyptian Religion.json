The hand - book of the Egyptian Religion seemed especially worthy of a wide circulation. It is a survey by the founder of the modern school of Egyptology in Germany, of perhaps the most interest- ing of all the departments of this subject. The Egyptian religion appeals to some because of its endless variety of form, and the many phases of superstition and belief that it represents ; to others because of its early recognition of a high moral principle, its elaborate conceptions of a life after death, and its connection with the development of Christianity ; to others again no doubt because it explains pretty things dear to the collector of antiquities, and familiar objects in museums. Professor Erman is the first to present the Egyptian religion in historical perspective; and it is surely a merit in, his work that out of his profound knowledge of the Egyptian texts, he permits them to tell their own tale almost in their own words, either by extracts or by summaries. His pages are particularly free from theory, and no theory is needed to enga, oe our attention when the facts and views disclosed are so attractive. The author has written a special preface for the English edition, and has modified one or two points in his text as regards the degree in which burnt sacrifice was customary. A few of the illustrations that were in the original have been omitted, and their places taken by others. Mr. Hilton Price has especialiy to be thanked for his generosity in lending blocks employed in the catalogue of his collection. F. L L . G R I FF I T H .

My endeavour has been to exhibit to a wide circle of readers the development and decay of a great religion through more than three thousand years, and for this task I had only a limited space at my disposal. Any discussion of disputed points was thus out of the question, and I had also to withstand the temptation to linger over points of special interest. The most important phenomena could only be sketched in outline, and where I have cited details in order to render the picture more intelligible, I have been forced to choose almost at random from the abundant material which lay ready to my hand. Other writers undoubtedly would often have differed from me in their choice. A greater difficulty lay in the immature condition of these studies. Of the religions of the ancient world there is perhaps no other for which we possess such an amount of material, so endless and impossible to grasp, as we do for this. It is in fact too great, and in addition to this our comprehension of the ancient religious writings is still very incomplete. All the insight and labour devoted by Brugsch, Budge, Lange, Lef&bure, Lepage Renouf, Lepsius, Maspero, Moret, Naville, Turaieff, Wiedemann, and many others, to the investigation of Egyptian religion, or to its description, have hitherto resulted in little more than the preliminary orientation of this intricate domain, and it will require many more decades of hard work before we shall be able to obtain a clear view.

Vlll religion must make the sketch complete all round, and in so doing must call imagination to his aid more frequently than is desirable. I must therefore ask that too much import,ance may not be attached to this book; I have represented the Egyptian religion as it appears to me after thirty years’ study of its monuments, but I am aware that I am not in a position to insist strongly on every feature of the picture. And one more remark. I considered it advisable to present this sketch of Egyptian Religion as it appears to an un - prejudiced observer, who knows nothing of the theories of the modern science of religions; the reader will here find nothing of animism, or fetishism, of chthonic deities, nor yet of medicine men. The facts should first be established and without prejudice, before we attempt to fit them into a scientific system.

When, at some later period, the needy Bedouins of the Arabian peninsula seized the country - an event which has been repeated in less remote times - the Egyptians adopted their language, but not their civilization, and a people of mixed nationality was formed who abandoned none of their earlier customs. To this we have a parallel to-day in modern Egypt, where invading Bedouins, the Arabs of Islam, have once more imposed their own language on the people, while yet these Arabic - speaking Egyptians have in no way changed their mode of life from that of their Christian and pagan forefathers. For the nature of that marvellous country is stronger than any human power. There is, however, one point in which the modern Arabs appear to have imposed their influence far more successfully than the Bedouin of ancient times. They have succeeded in giving the Egyptians a new religion, as well as a new language, whereas there are no indications of a similar result of the ancient invasion. In the beliefs and conceptions of the ancient Egyptians as me find them in the earliest literature there is nothing that relates in any way to the characteristics of the desert, or to the conditions of life there, while there is very much that can only be explained by the peculiar conditions of Egypt. The religion of Egypt must therefore be considered to be a product of Egypt, whence in large measure it acquired 1-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 INTRODUCTION its special character. Egypt is an agricultural country, that notwithstanding its productiveness demands hard work, and trains its inhabitants to practical life. Their belief9 are thus distinguished by a certain sober earnestness ; on this heavy soil a lively fancy will not flourish, but all manner of superstitions spring up readily. The world inhabited by these people was a limited one, they knew only their long, narrow valley, where each year their marvellous river deposited its wealth over the country ; beyond there was only the desert, with which man - kind had no concern. One thing, however, served to raise the mind of the Egyptian to something above himself, as for us to-day it invests the Nile valley with magic : the sky, with the glory of its sun and the indescribable splendour of its stars. In these stars the Egyptian recognized his gods, and for him no god could rank higher than the sun, which maintains all things and which calls all things into being. Among the objects most familiar to the Egyptian on earth were the animals and birds ; as an agriculturist he would daily be brought into close contact with them, and under their forms accordingly he frequently represented his gods. The peculiar character of the country influenced its religion in another way: it divided it. Lower Egypt is cut up in all directions by arms of the river, marshes and watercourses; while Upper Egypt, the most important part of the country, is a uniform narrow river valley where three to four million inhabit - ants live on a strip of land which may be compared to that which stretches from B$le to the sea. In a country of this description, where the two divisions are so distinct and have but little mutual intercourse, there must necessarily have sprung up in the separate provinces differences in speech, in ideas and in religion. Thus in each larger town of Egypt and in the country sur - rounding it, religion assumed a special form. The principal gods are called by different names in the different provinces. They have different legends and distinctive forms of worship ; besides this there is here and there a town with a special god of its own, not recognized elsewhere. So long as Egypt was divided politically, these religious differences intensified"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 3 from century to century; but when she was united into one kingdom a pecnliar process commenced. The religion of the town that was the royal residence became the official state religion ; the temple was visited from all parts of the country, and its god recognized by all. Before long the wish would arise in other cities to worship a god of such distinction. His worship would then be introduced, or it would be dis - covered that the special god of the locality was in reality the same, and the two would be blended into one. When, with the progress of culture among the Egyptian nation, a uniform intellectual life developed in art, in literature, in science, we might expect to find that it led to a uniform and simplified religion. But this was never attained to. Neither the stress of political circumstances, nor the advancing education of the people, nor the increasing intercourse with other nations, ever brought this about. When the people of Bubastis learnt to worship the god Amon, because he was the deity of the royal city, they did not in the slightest degree abate their reverence for their goddess Bast, and when they began to realize that this ancient goddess is identical with Sekhmet and Isis, they did not on this account alter a fraction of their traditional conception of her, but simply added the new to the old. A strange curse lay on the Egyptians : they could not forget. At the earliest period writing had been discovered by them and had placed them in the front rank of the nations, but the price of this remained to be paid. Every fresh epoch of their long existence brought them new ideas, but the earlier ideas did not, disappear in consequence, It is possible that the latter might fall into temporary neglect, but they were still treasured as sacred possessions, and in another century would once more assume a prominent position. Or again, a book that lay dor- mant in some temple library would one day become a living influence. In this way the confusion of ideas, national and local, old and new, increased with every successive period, and added to the mass of religious details that rejoiced the Egyptian theologians, but which we regard with horror. Yet it will well repay us to follow the beliefs of the Egyptians through the centuries, even if the points we attempt to observe"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4 INTRODUCTION are precisely those which the Egyptian priest would have held in contempt. To notice how the Egyptian in the primitive period believed that he could see his gods still living a natural life ; how later, when his gods, living in their colossal temples, had become strangers to him, he invented for himself certain helpers whom he could treat with greater intimacy; how at one time a ruler of the country bravely attempted to free himself and his people from the yoke of the ancient faith ; how among all the extravagant ideas concerning life after death, the feeling yet obtained that the righteousness of man would then be far more powerful than forms and ceremonies - to see these things appears to us of much greater importance than to know all the names, symbols, and feast days of the gods and goddesses."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION CHAPTER I RELIGIOUS BELlEFS OF THE EARLY PERIOD W H E N the subject of Egyptian religion is mentioned, our thoughts turn instinctively to thc beliefs held at the period during which was achieved the building of the temples of Karnak and Luxor, of Medinet Habu, and Abu Simbel, palaces where the gods sat enthroned, and where their magnificent festivals were celebrated. But this period, so well known to us, is separated by a vast interval from the time when the Egyptian religion first acquired its external forms. An examination of these external forms will show how faithfully the representations of the gods were adhered to, and how modest and simple must have been the conditions of the nation that first created them. The people had already learnt to carve rough figures of gods either in human or animal form, and these they chose to distinguish by a variety of crowns, but as yet their im - agination did not go beyond diadems formed either of handfuls of reeds, the horns of sheep or cows, or of ostrich carried a staff such as every Bedouin cuts for himself at the present day, and their goddesses were contented with a simple 5 feathers.

Their temples were mere huts with walls of plaited wicker work, the front of the roof was adorned with projecting wooden beams. A few short posts and two high masts in front of the building were added to provide further decoration. The altar consisted of a reed mat, and for the celebration of festivals, simple bowers were erected. Where the outward forms were so primi- tive we must expect to find the religious conceptions even more primitive, and all that f ~~~.2. a. BCEPPR&S. b is known to us of the ancient modes of a. Gods'. b. Goddesses'. thought confirms this expectation. Those to whom the following ex - planation of Egyptian ideas may seem far too simple, should remember that for the most part they were conceived by a race of naked, half savage peasants. These ideas were inherited by the Egyptians of historical times, the sub- jects of Cheops, Amenemhat and Ramses, who preserved them for us. In order to understand them it is necessary to transport ourselves to that far-distant infancy of the Egyptian nation, when the inhabitant of the Nile Valley gazed with awe on the ever-moving bodies in the heavens above him, and in those marvellous phenomena recognized the gods who ruled the world. Numerous are the ideas concerning the universe, and the representations by which the people attempted to express their ideas. In one of these the sky appears as an im- mense cow whose feet are resting on the earth. In another the sky is a wornan, FIG. 4 WARRIOR OF THE w.ho supports herself with hands and (Berlin, 15084.) feet on the earth.

While the sky is usually regarded as being feminine, a woman, and a cow, the earth figures as a man on whose back it is that vegetation grows. Apparently the grammatical gender of the two words - pet, “ sky,” is feminine, to, ‘‘ earth,” is masculine - led to this conception. We also meet with a multiplicity of ideas regarding the sun. In the morning it is born, either as a calf of the celestial cow, or as a child of the goddess of the sky; in the evening it is an old man who goes down to the dead. It is the right eye of a great god whose left eye is F~~. 5. XOTaER the moon, and who flies across the heavens like PRIDIITIVE PERIOD. a hawk. Or again a beetle, the great dung - beetle (Berllnl 14441‘) of Egypt rolls the sun before it, as its earthly brother is seen rolling the ball in which it lays its egg. Or, and this is the most brilliant idea, the sun, moon and stars sail in ships over the heavenly ocean. This, however, raises the question how it is possible for the sun which disappears every evening in the West to reappear in the morning in the East; a question usually solved by the Egyptians by imagining a second heaven under the earth, which the sun traverses by night. It is a dark place, inhabited by the dead, lighted at night by the sun when he sails through it in his bark. For even this under - world possesses a river, a mysterious stream which also ascends into the world of the living. At the southern border of Egypt, near the island of Elephantine, it rises in two whirlpools and flows through Egypt as the river Nile. From this we see that in the eyes of the primitive Egyptian even the Nile did not Bow outside Egypt. The cataract formed the extreme boundary of his world. Out of all these in - congruous elements the Egyptian of historical times set himself to compose his picture of the universe, and mixed them haphazard without permitting himself to be disturbed by the incredible nonsense which ensued.

And thus it is with names and forms, which, originally separate"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OF THE EARLY PERIOD g conceptions, become confused. For instance, in immediate sequence and in one sentence the sun god is spoken of as Re, Khepre, Horus, Har- akhti, Atum, etc. Also in the case of descriptions of the individual gods, which we are now about to consider, we shall re- cept this complexity of ideas, as only too often we do not possess the information that would enable us to disentangle them. There is yet another element in this medley, the constant confusion, half serious, half playful, between the gods and their sacred animals. Because in primitive Egypt the water god was regarded as a crocodile, and the moon god as an ibis, these gods were often regarded and represented in later times under these forms, but this did not preclude human forms being also attributed to them. A S a rule a compromise was effected in representing them, and the gods were shown in human form with the heads of their respective animals. The Egyptian artist learnt in very early clays to correct the unnatural nature of such a fusion by clever artistic treatment, so that in good representations of the gods we scarcely find ourselves disturbed by it. To the Egyptians there was no god of higher standing than the sun god, who was regarded as the sole creator, and ruler of the world ; from the bark in which he traversed the heavens, the great god, the god of heaven governed all things, and who- soever in daily life merely speaks of the god, he will think of him. All things exult when he arises, and even the apes pray unto him ; men also raise their hands morning and evening, and laud him thus : Glory to thee, thou who risest in the horizon. . . . “ Praise to thee ’’ say the assembled gods, (( thou beautij%d beloved child.” When he c~rises munkind lives, and the people exult on his account.

From earliest times this god had special localities devoted to his worship, but one of these rose to such fame as to over- shadobv the others. This was On, or - as following the Greek nomenclature it is generally called-Heliopolis, the primeval city, situated not far from modern Cairo at Matariyeh. We believe it is evident that the Egyptian religion was greatly influenced at the earliest period by Heliopolis, and up to the latest times the priests of On were credited with the possession of great wisdom. FIG. 8. THE SUN QOD OF EDFU. Another important centre of the worship of the sun god, was Edfu in Upper Egypt, where even now his temple stands complete. Here originated the remarkable figure of the god which represents him as the sun with multicoloured wings as he flies across the heavens triumphant over his enemies. This figure of norus of Edfu (or, as he was usually styled, he of Edfu) is placed over the gateways of the temples to keep out all evil things. The most general one, R E , denoted the sun itself. HORUS or H AR - AKHTE originally stood for the god, regarded as a bird of prey with blazing eyes, while I~HEPRE denoted t,he god in form of a beetle. Finally the evening sun was represented by A T U M in the form of an old man. The sun god is usually represented with the head of a sparrow-hawk surmounted by the sun; this is en- circled \\vi th its terrible servant, the fire - spitting serpent, who destroys his enemies.

But they cannot obstruct the progress of the god, he accomplishes in triumph his journey across the heavens, and in the evening arrives at the moun - tains of the West, where he is received by the goddess of the West. Here he quits his morning bark in which he travels by day, and enters the evening bark to begin his nightly journey through the under-world. There he shines forth for the great god Osiris, the eternal Lord.

But there are many of whom this cannot be said, of whom some feature is comprehen - sible, but whose characteristics as a whole are entirely obscure to us. In the temple Hat-ke - ptah, where Memphis stood later, a god was worshipped from the earliest times ; on the breast of his rude statue ve can discern two hands holding a sceptre, while the head appears to be shaven and devoid of any ornament, This is Ptah, the divine sculp - tor, who gave and still gives form to all things and all beings on earth. He was regarded by artists and artisans as their patron. In a similar character of creator and sculptor of certain beings we meet with another important god, either as a ram, or with a ram’s head, KHNUM, worshipped in rnany localities. At one of his FIQ. 22. SOBK. :om his temple in the FayBm. (Berlin, 16953.) temples, that on the island of Elephantine, a new characteristic was attributed to him. Here in the midst of the foaming cataract, where it was believed that the waters gushed up from the under - world, he figured also as the cataract god, lord of the cool waters, a character which cer - tainly was not his originally. It must have been far earlier that the god S O B K was worshipped as a water god. He is crocodile- headed as though water were his special element, and in no dis - trict was he more worshipped than in the Payhm, that region of lake and marsh, where the land had laboriously to be redeemed from the water.

In the land of Goshen, which stretches out from the Delta eastward into the desert, a god was worshipped, H A R - S O P D , who, as his name shows, was originally connected with the ancient sun god Horus, but who is only known to us as protector of the Eastern desert. Another lord of the East, the god M I N , was wor - shipped in that part of Upper Egypt where the Nile and the Red Sea approach each other FIQ. 23. , MIN. (Berlin, 2439 most closely, and which was therefore at all periods the starting point of the caravan route to the Eastern world. Those who pursued this route, and who had therefore to brave the dangerous neighbourhood of the rapacious troglo - dytes, naturally committed themselves at Koptos to the protection of Min, the local god, before leaving the Nile Valley. Thus he became also a god of the Eastern desert, the lord of f0reig.n lands. The archaic statues of Min, now at Oxford, found by Petrie in the founda - tions of the temple ut Koptos, prove to us how ancient this conception was; even those rude sculptures of the earliest times have bivalve shell, elephants and mountains represented on the girdles, precisely the things to which the Koptos road led the way. Here again this attribute of Min is certainly not his original one. He is an ithyphallic figure, as if he were intended to beget the world, as according to a myth to be quoted later (see p. 26) the sun god is said to have done. As Min is frequently spoken of also as Horus, it may well be considered probable that Min is another name of the sun god. From another point of view also this figure is remarkable. On his head he wears two feathers, and the right fore - arm, with which he supports a"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OF THE EARLY PERIOD 19 scourge, is held upright. When, therefore, a few miles south of the honie of Min, we meet with another god who wears similar lofty plumes, who is frequently represented as ithyphallic, and who also resembles Min in being of purely human form with dark complexion, it is natural to regard him as another form of Min. This god is no other than AMON of Thebes, king of the gods of later Egypt. In the early times with which we are now dealing, no one could have foreseen the importance that would one day accrue to him. He was the obscure god of a small town, and even his nearest neighbours, the people of Hermonthis, worshipped another god, the hawk-headed M O N T . This Mont figures as the god of war.

Few gods are so famous as he is, and yet his origin is entirely unknown to us. Tradition has introduced him as well as Horus, the ancient sun god, into the Osiris myth, and has blurred and confused both presentments. Horus becomes the son, and Set the wicked brother of Osiris, who is defeated by Horus, but it is exactly in this apposition of the two gods, that we find an indication of an earlier character for Set, to which we possess other clues. When we find the two divisions of the country designated as The two halves of HOTUS and Set, and when according to an ancient title the ruler of these two divisions is styled HOTUS and Set, it appears that we have met with some of the numerous survivals of that far - distant time when Egypt was divided into two opposing kingdompr.

The animal by which Set is represented or whose head he wears, was considered in later times to be a donkey, although at least it could only have been a caricature of one. Probably it was intended for some animal with which the Egyptians of historical times were not familiar. As we find in Set and Horus the protectors of the two ancient divi - sions of Egypt, so also we know their protecting goddesses. In the ancient capital of the Upper Kingdom, the modern El Kab, flew N E K H B E T in the form of a vulture, guarding the king. In Buto, the lower capital, dwelt U T O in the form of a serpent. In common with her city slie is usually called Buto, following a Cnreek transposition.

Later, when she rose to great importance as the wife of Amon, she was represented as a woman wearing the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt which she had borrowed from the kings of her city. Ws have no knowledge of the original nature of TSIS, the goddess who finally superseded almost all others, and appears before us as the sole goddess of Egypt. She has met with the same fate as her husband Osiris, her son Horus, her sister Nephthys and her brother Set; who lost all their original characteristics when they were interwoven in the Osiris myth. Although no goddess is so frequently mentioned as Isis, she appears before us only as the faithful wife of Osiris, and the devoted mother of Horus. She is merely sn adjunct to her menfolk. Another goddess must be mentioned of whom we may safely affirm that she owes her existence to no phenomenon of nature. She is entirely a product of human invention and is thus a pure abstraction. This is MAAT, goddess of truth, whose priests were the supreme judges, and who was regarded as wife of the divine judge Thoth and daughter of the supreme god Re. As early as the Old Kingdom she ranked among the god - desses, nevertheless she is quite as much an artificial product as are the personifications of beauty or wisdom which we frequently find cited in poetry. Many readers will consider that a very large number of the gods have already been mentioned, and yet these €orm but a small proportion of the deities venerated in Egypt. If a list could be made of all those worshipped at one time or another in the temples and shrines of the Nile Valley, they would prob - ably amonnt to many hundreds of divinities.

They are the creations of simple minds, ready to believe that stones, trees, and animals may be the abode of spirits. The unknown power who thus manifests itself has gifts and prayers offered to it, owing to the awe which it inspires, and in course of time when the people of the town have long worshipped it in private, it finds a place in the temple and is added to the number of official divinities. To the great group of such gods of inferior rank belong the sacred animals, of whom traces can be found in the temples as early as the Old Kingdom. We have already seen how the Egyptians of the earliest times frequently conceived of their gods in animal form. The sky as a cow, the sun as a sparrow- hawk, the moon as an ibis, the god of the dead as a jackal, the water god as a crocodile. These were symbols, necessary to mankind when they sought to express themselves metaphorically. We our- selves cannot avoid such figures of speech; we speak of the hand of God, and the mouth of God, and when we think of Him personally, we instinctively think of Him in the form of an old man. Where a divinity and an animal were associated with each other, there was naturally a desire to see that special animal in the temple of the god. In the temple of Sobk there was a tank containing a crocodile, a cat dwelt in the temple of Bast. Sparrow-hawks were kept in the sanctuary of the sun god, where they sat on perches and peacefully pecked their food out of bowls. There were other creatures kept in temples which were not representations of the god but stood in another definite relation to them. They belonged to them in much the same manner that the doves belonged to Aphrodite, or the owls to Athene. This is especially the case with some of the more widely known of these aninials, the heron, Phcenix, and the bull Mnevis, who dwelt in the temple at Heliopolis, and the bull Apis, in the sanctuary of Ptah at Memphis. We cannot now trace why Apis attained to such honour. That Mnevis should be regarded as the animal of the sun god is not surprising, as that god was often addressed as a FIG. 30. SACRED IIAWK."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OF THE EARLY PERIOD 23 bull, to the Egyptians the essence of all strength and virility. With regard to the Phcenix which was born in the pastures1 of the temple and which only occasionally allowed it - self to be seen there, we are tempted to attribute its origin to a chance. Is it not possible that once in those earliest times some herons made their nest accidentally in this most sacred locality, and would not this nest form an object of veneration and curiosity for the simple - FIc. 31 minded worshippers at the temple ? For a long period they would see the nest occupied each successive year, then perhaps the birds would desert it ; and great must have been the joy after many years when another Phcenix once more found its way there, to be a marvel to all the people of Heliopolis. In the case of such a living presentment of the god, some of his divinity would inevitably be trans - ferred to the bird, and the humbler classes would feel almost more attracted by this god who moved among them, and could be seen by his wor - shippers, than by the image which, concealed in the Temple in the holy of holies, was hidden from the eyes of the faithful, and only shown at the great festivals. Eventually these revered animals were recognized as sacred by the official religion, and considered to be incarnations of the Metternich Stela 77. F I G . 32.

Thus, in Apis dwelt the soul of Ptah ; and did one of these bulls die he transferred himself to another, and Apis lives cmew. Animal worship must have arisen in some siwh way, and thus it, came into being at a very early period. It was a remarkable adjunct to the Egyptian religion, but it did riot belong to its original structure. In later times veneration for the sacred cat, monkey, sheep, and serpent increased greatly, and in the last stages of the religion of Egypt, their sacred character extended to all their kind outside the temples, but the ancient faith of the people knew nothing of this craze. The forms of these various divinities we have sketched here do not correspond with the actual beginnings of Egyptian religion, for to that we have no clue, but only to a very ancient official form which survives in the cults, and also in the carvings and inscriptions of the temples. But the carvings and inscriptions contain milch that has to be rejected for this earliest period, and which is the result of the growth of tradition, that inevitable process of transformation which pervaded the Egyptian religion as it does all others. In its youth a nation may well be satisfied with worshipping the gods which it believes it sees on earth, and with winning their favour by means of offerings and prayers, but a mature nation becomes more intimately acquainted with the deity, and the more intimate it becomes, the more it discards the notion of his unapproachable majesty. Then it is that imagination begins its work, and the divine is represented more and more as human ; deities that appear to resemble each other, or that are worshipped in the same locality, are grouped together into one family ; the preferences or hatreds of gods for each other become known ; the manner in which the world originated becomes clearly defined, and also the order in which the gods reigned. From century to century story-tellers and poets develop these stories more fully, the details of the myth become richer and more brilliant, until at last the whole fabric of theology is complicated and adorned by their addition and superstructure. Thus in speaking of Thoth, it is no longer the moon that is thought of, but the god who arranged the dispute in the great Hall of Heliopolis, and justified Osiris before his foes. Anubis"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"RE1,IGIOUS BELIEFS OF THE EARLY PERIOD 25 no longer means the ancient guardian of the dead, but the friend of Osiris who carried out his burial. It was only in the ritual, with its unchangeable customs, that the old ideas survived, only partially comprehended. But in course of time the influence of the myths made itself felt even in the ritual, and the original Osiris and Isis had to make way for the traditional Osiris and Isis, now widely known among the nations. It is in this period of mythology that we first know anything of the religion of Egypt; even our earliest texts are full of allusions to the myth. The day whemin. . . . The might whewin . . . That gad who . . . these are expressions we meet with at every turn. But numerous as these allusions are, we understand little of them, for the stories to which they refer are not told us in the texts. If any literature relating to these stories ever existed, it is entirely lost. It is possible that actual mythological writings never existed; it would be quite un - necessary to write down tales familiar to all, passed on from generation to generation by word of mouth. We are therefore obliged to draw our knowledge of this important side of Egyptian religion from very doubtful sources, from magic spells, which found their magic character on relations of similar deeds of the gods, from isolated inscriptions of the latest times, or even (and this is actually our main source of knowledge) from Plutarch’s account of Isis and Osiris. It is obvious that the form taken by the stories in these texts is not always the ancient one to which they refer, but we are forced to depend on them, and must be satisfied when here and there they enable us to correct or to amplify our knowledge on some point. The myths of which we shall now speak are naturally only a small part of the great mass of stories of the gods with which Egypt at one time must have been flooded, and the reader will not be surprised to find that they do not always fit into each other.

And what he spat out was the god Shu, and the goddess Tefnet, those two beings who, according to Egyptian belief, supported the heavens. Shu and Tefnet then produced Keb and Nut, the earth god and sky goddess, and Keb and Nut produced Osiris and Set, Isis and Nephthys, whose childrren are many on this eayth. This account, taken from a late book of magic; is shown by numerous allu - sions to have been a tradition known at one time throughout Egypt. Yet these allusions prove that the tradition was variously coloured in different localities. According to some a lotus flower sprang out of the primeval waters on which sat the young sun god as a child. In Eshmunh, however, tradition told of a mound in the waters of Desdes,and of an egg laid in a nest there, from which the sun god was hatched 2 in the same way as the waterfowl of the Egyptian marshes. Eight primeval beings in the form of frogs and serpents took some part in this event, and a cow (which must be connected with the celestial cow) was also present; the young god seated himself on her back, and swam across the water.

In Abydos the gods who issued from the mouth of Re himself were not Shu and Tefnet, but Shu and the frog goddess Hekt, the progenitors of the gods.3 There is a variant of the Heliopolitan tradition which is also worthy of notice. Here the god is said to have first appeared as the Bmben stone in the house .f the Phaznix? That he begat of himself may have appeared too incredible to many, and, therefore, from the minor name Yusau, by which the god was distinguished at this occurrence, the name of a consort of the god was formed, Yusas, who was actually worshipped at Heliopolis. Another section of these myths shows how deeply in other respects they had impressed themselves on the official religion. It generally sets forth the family tree of the gods thus- Sun God Shu - Tefnet Keb - Nut Osiris-Isis Set-Nephthys c , < - These gods, who connect the beginning of the world with human times, had by this time become of great importance to the people of Heliopolis, as the immediate descendants of their great god, and they therefore grouped together this family of Re under a special name, the Ennead.

In addition to the Great Ennead a Lesser group was constructed composed of Horus, Thoth, Anubis and others, These two groups form the eighteen gods who figure even in the earliest texts. Later on, other great towns wished to possess enneads 1 London, 567 ; Louvre, C. 3. L.D. III.24d; and L.D. IT. 21 c. 3 Louvre, C. 3 ; London, 567. Pyr.

To do this they displaced one of the nine in order to make room for their local deity, or they even added him to the ennead, undisturbed by the fact that in this way their group of nine actually contained ten members. In connection with the traditicn of the origin of the earliest gods, another is supplied by the magical text already quoted, of which we would-gladly know more, as again and again we meet with references to it. This is the legend of the Eye of the Stun. Unfortunately it has been so niuch altered by the magicians of the late period, who themselves cannot have understood the ancient texts, that we must abandon any hope of understanding the original. This only is apparent, that for some reason the eye of the god had been taken away from him, and that the two modernized gods Shu and Tefnet restored it to him, and it wept on his account and mankind came out of the tears which issued front the eye. And it was enraged, when it mtzLrned and found that another had grown in its place; then if I understand rightly the god took the eye, and set it as the serpent in his forehead, so that the eye of the sun now rules the whole world, for the ser- pent which Re wears on his forehead is verily the symbol of his might. Any attempt to make sense of this myth is useless; but it should be remembered that the Eye of the Sun, as we have just seen, denoted at one time the sun itself, and at another time was a name of Hathor. The statement that mankind originated from his tears arose from a play on the very similar words remyyet, “ tears,” and romet, “ mankind.” Similar punning inventions play an important part in all these Egyptian myths. They underlie the above - mentioned story of Shu and Tefnet being produced by spitting. This peculiarity is explained by the importance attached by the Egyptians to the names of things. The name possesses something of the nature of the object, and it is owing to this that the sun god, for instance, is called his own creator because he himself formed his name? We have seen above how the race of Re was propagated and how his grandchildren, the god Keb and goddess Nut, were the earth and the sky; but the earth and the sky were not yet 1 Totenb. ed.

Therefore her father Shu thrust himself between them, and raised her into the heights, and with her he raised into the heights all the gods that had hitherto been created, and Nut took possession of them, counted them and made them into stars. Even the sun itself was not excepted, and now they all sail in their ships over the body of Nut. This was the actual begin - ning of our present world; when heaven and earth were thus separated from each other, all things fell into their present order. If this myth just quoted gives as a reason for the sun happening to be in the sky, that Shu raised up Nut, a given by another and later tradition. The reader will not have forgotten that there were other conceptions of the beginning of the world, as we have already learnt. In this instance the sky is a cow. Once in ancient days Re, the sun god,ruled as king over men and gods alilce. In course of time, however, he grew old, his bones were silver, his limbs were gold, his hair real lapis-lazuli. This was observed by men, and they thought blasphemously of him, but the god was not ignorant of their thoughts, and he said to one of his followers : (I Call to me my eye, and Shu and Tefnet, Keb and Nut, together with the fathers and nzothers who were with me, when I was in the waters of Nun, and also the god Nun. . . .

But when Nut looked downwards she trembled on account of the height. Then Re called to Xhu, saying, ‘‘ illy so?z Shzc, place thyself under my daughter Nut,place her upon thy head,’’ and Shu did as he was commanded, and since then he has supported the celestial cow, on whose belly the stars glitter, and the sun sails in his ship? The same book of magic from which this myth is taken, also gives us its version of how the moon originated. Once, while Re sojourned in the heavens, he said, ‘( Call Thoth unto me,” and forthwith he was brought. The Majesty of this god said to Thoth, ‘( Be thou in heaxen i.n my place while I give light to the gloriJied ones in the under - world. . . . Thou art in my stead, my representa - tive as thou shalt be called ; Thoth the representative of Re.” And now all manner of things were created by a punning speech of Re. He said to Thoth, ,(I will cause thee to enzbrace (yonh) both the heavens with thy beauty and thy beurns,” so the moon was created (yooh); and again with reference to the fact that for a representative of Re the position held by Thoth was somewhat lowly, &,I will sand (hob) to thee, those that are greater than thou. . . .” TJaen came into being the ibis (hib), the bird of Thoth. Of these traditions, none was more widespread or exercised a greater and more lasting influence on the Egyptian nation than that which tells of the god Osiris, his faithful wife Isis, and his brave son Horus. How this first arose, we cannot con - jecture, for the original character of Osiris is doubtful, and that of Isis is equally impossible to discover. That the ancient sun god Horus should here be represented as a child, shows how utterly everything is dislocated.

But on the whole the endless versions of the Osiris myth agree on the principal points, and these are accurately reproduced, although greatly amplified in Plutarch's Isis and Osiris. As we have already seen, Eeb the earth god and Nut the sky goddess had four children - two sons, Osiris and Set, and two daughters, Isis and Nephthys; Isis became the wife of Osiris, Nephthys of Set ; Osiris, however, ruled the world as king and instructed mankind in all that was good. Keb gave him his inheritance,2 The government over the two Egypts, , . , he made over to him the guidance of the lands to prosperity, and gate this land into his hand; its water, its air, its plants, all its herds, all that $ies and all that hovers, its reptiles and its wild beasts, were given to the son of Nut, and the two lands were contented thereat. For Osiris was an excellent ruler, he shone forth on the throne of his fathem as the sun, when he arises on the horison, when he sheds light on those who were in darkness. He was just and established truth in Egypt; he was moreover (as the Greek version also states) a great warrior, gloriozcs when he overthrew the enemy and powerful when he slew his foes; the fear of him had fallen upon his enemies and he enlarged the boundaries ; in the same way he ruled excellently over the gods, as leader of every god, with excellent laws, the Great Ennead praised him, the Lesser Znnead loved him. Why Set was his foe is not explained in the Greek account, perhaps the reason was considered obvious, for in any oriental royal family of two brothers, if one of them succeeds to the throne, it may be taken for granted that the other will be his natural enemy. We are only told that Set caught Osiris by means of a trick.

Although he could not return to his former life on earth, yet he could enter upon a second existence, and from being king of men, become a king of the dead.

It is the human element, the justification of Osiris, the wifely devotion and mother love of Isis, the filial piety of Horus. These captivated the Egyptian nation at a period which must have been very remote. At the same time they formed the people's conceptions of the future life, teaching them that after death the just and upright were more valued than those who had possessed authority and power Healing by means of spitting is frequently mentioned. 1 Pyr. 145.

Beginning with matters relating to the dead, these conceptions of Osiris and Isis, of Horus and Set, extended their influence more and more widely, until the entire religion was under their dominion. The most ancient form of religion at which we can arrive had been coloured and transformed by the Osiris legend, so much so, that we can almost distinguish it as an Osirian religion distinct from the belief of prehistoric times of which we have no record. From this Osiris legend, and from other legends of the gods which have now disappeared, the misapplied learning of later times constructed a history of primeval events in which the gods are introduced as kings OJ’ QTer and Lower Egypt, each one with the number of centuries and years that he reigned. Keb, Osiris, Set and Horus follow in order, then Thoth and Maat ; then all manner of obscure gods, and, finally, the human kings, the Serwmts of flows, end the primitive period1 These absurdities were carried so far that formal titles were invented for the gods, similar to those borne by earthly kings, and as early as the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, Osiris appears on a gravestone with two correctly formed royal names : Horzis “who set right $he slaughter of the two worlds,” king of Upper aid Lower Egypt ; ‘‘ Osi~is Wennofre.” It must not be overlooked that the first of these names refers to some part of the Osiris legend which is unknown to us ; it appears as if the god, on entering into his kingdom, found Egypt plunged in warfare, and brought peace to it, This sketch of the Egyptian religion would not be complete if we omitted at the close to mention a being of sacred character who, according to our ideas, was certainly not one of the gods, and yet in the official religion was reckoned among them from the beginning; any one reading an inscription of the Old Ringdom, and finding it stated that so - and-so for his merits was beloved of his god, would naturally imagine that in some way the god was intended, whom the aforesaid man, with his household, had served; this, however, is not the case; it is the king who is thus designated. And again, when reading a tomb inscrip- 1 According to the Turin Papyrus. 2 Louvre C. 2. A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OF THE EAF-LY PERIOD 37 tion of the twelfth dynasty, we gain the impression that, to the nobles of this period, the king was actually as much a divinity as mere any of the gods; they never weary of glorifying him, and testifying to their reverence for him, while the gods themselves are only mentioned incidentally. But it was not at this period of rapid changes that this climax of Byzantinisin arose ; the divinity of the kings belongs to the primitive dogmas of Egypt. In two points only is the king distinguished from the actual gods. While Re, Osiris or Horus are styled great god, the king has to content himself with being called good god, and it is only after his death that he attains to the higher title. Also during his lifetime he was accorded no fornial worship with temples, offerings, and priests, at any rate not in the early times. It must have beeri at the close of that period that the following extravagances of poetical comparison were adopted. The king is described as the sun god on earth, his palace is the horizon; when he shows himself he arises, when he dies he sets. Thus he wears as his diadem the fire - spitting serpent, which the sun god bears on his forehead, and which destroys his enemies. Again, the king is compared to Horus, the son of Osiris, when he succeeded his father on the throne as Chief of the living. In this connection he is called HOTUS, the Lo~d of the Palace, and his palace itself is callcd the solitude because Horus grew up in solitude, Then again, the king is called the son of Re; it might be thought that this was only intended to mean that the royal house was ultimately descended from the gods, and therefore from Re. Rut this is not so; in two temples of the New Kingdom 1 we find illustrated texts which show US how this divine paternity must be understood. When the newly - made Queen is established in the beauty of her house, the supreme god approaches her, having taken the form of her hzcsbad. She is awalied lizy the sweet scent which surrounds him, and smiles on the god.

We must confine ourselves to a rapid review of some of the most important characteristics of the outward forms of the Egyptian religion. When the Egyptian named his temple the house of the god, the name was a literal expression of his belief: the deity dwelt in the temple, as a man lives in his house, and the priests, the servafits of the god, who supplied him with food and attend - ance, were his household servants. This appears also in the religious ceremonies, and perhaps in the arrangement of the temple buildings - although in historical times this belief can have been little more than an obsolete idea. Each temple must originally have been dedicated to one single deity who was considered to be its loyd, but owing to the natural anxiety to secure the favour of other gods for the city others were added as secondary deities, and in the greater temples their numbers steadily increased in the course of centu - ries. Two of these, a goddess and a god, were generally regarded as the wife and child of the principal deity. ‘rhus Ptah of Memphis had Sekhmet for his consort, and Xefer-tem for his son, and Arnon had Mut assigned to him as wife, and the moon god Khons as his child. The goddesses had at least one child : thus Hrnt>hor of Denderah had the boy Ehi, and Buto a god Horus. Of the temples of the earliest period, which, as we have already seen (p. 6), consisted merely of simple huts, nothing has of 39"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"40 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION course survived to our times, but of the great buildings of early historical times also very little remains, for during the long course of centuries they were so frequently rebuilt, restored, and enlarged, that as a rule only occasional blocks of stone remain in evidence of the original construction. Nevertheless, from the scanty remains of these early temples which exist here and there, we can form a correct idea of their original plan. In appearance they were essentially the same as tlie great buildings which later arose in their place. The form anciently given to a temple remained the model for all periods, and if we now proceed to describe a temple of tlie Nev Kingdom, it is with the certainty that our description applies equally to one of the early period. At the present day we are accustomed to see the magnificent ruins of Egyptian temples situated in open spaces or on cultivated ground, and we involuntarily picture them in ancient days among such surroundings. In reality, however, these temples were inside the towns, amidst the medley of buildings and the narrow filthy streets of a southern city. The noisy bustle that went on around them was shut out by the high wall that enclosed the precincts, and rendered them pure and peaceful spots in the midst of an impure and noisy world. At one time the way to the temple was through the streets of the town, but it was necessary to make a more open road for the convenience of the processions at festivals. For this a straight broad Toad ofthe god was carried right through the inhabited quarter, and lined on both sides with statues of rams, lions, or other sacred animals, as though they were intended to form a guard of stone to ward off the crowds from the road of the god. At the point where this road reached the surrounding wall of the temple, rose the great gateway, the so-called pylon, an enormous entrance flanked by two high towers with sloping walls. Behind this gateway lay the first large space, an open court surrounded by colonnades. Here the great festivals were celebrated, in which a large number of the citizens were en- titled to take part. Behind this court there was a hall supported by columns, the place appointed for all manner of ceremonies, and behind this again lay the holy of holies, the chamber where"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS OF THE EARLY PERIOD 41 the statue of the god had his dwelling. In adjoining apartments were the statues of the wife and son of the god. This was the essential part of a temple; naturally there would be various additional chambers to contain the sacred utensils, and for special purposes of the religious cults. A further characteristic of every temple is that from front to rear each apartment was less lofty and light than the preceding. Into the court the Egyptian sun blazed with un- interrupted splendour ; in the hall its light was admitted to a modified ex - tent through the entrance and through windows in the roof; in the holy of holies reigned profoundest darkness. The decorations of the temple were essentially the same in all cases. The walls and columns were adorned with brilliantly coloured reliefs, and with inscriptions no less brightly coloured ; on the outside walls were represented the deeds of the king who built the temple ; inside the scenes referred to the cult of the god, and pictured the events that occurred every day within those walls. In front of the pylon, on the outside, stood the obelisks, two stone pillars, such as no doubt it was the custom to place in front of other FrQ. 37. CROUND-Pt.AN OF THE TEaIpLE buildings. Behind them, on the walls OB RA\"SES ''I' KARNAK* of the pylon, there rose four high masts, from whose summit waved bright-coloured flags. In front of the gateway or inside the court there were seated colossal statues of the king, as protector of the sanctuary built by him. Other statues disposed in the different parts of the temple show him worshipping the god with prayers or offerings.

There is, however, a small number of temples entirely divergent from this type mliich we must not omit to mention, as it includes the temple of Abu Gurab, which has so greatly enriched the Berlin Museum. These are the temples of the sun of the fifth dynasty, which have been supposed, with some degree of probability> to be copies of the celebrated teniple of the sun at Heliopolis, which is lost to us. According to tradition the kings of the fifth dynasty were descended from a high - priest of Re, and, in fa&, we find that they accorded special honours to that god.

These temples, which bore names such as fnvozcrite dwelling of Re, were large open courts, at the further end of which stood an immense obelisk on a substructure of pyramidal form ; this was the principal part of the temple, and was no doubt regarded as the dwelling of the god ; possibly it was a copy of the cele - brated Benben stone at Heliopolis, which was of similar form. In front of the obelisk there stood the great altar of the god: in addition the court merely contained some small offices necessary for the cult, so that the worship of the god was carried on in the open air. The decorations of the temple on the whole did not differ greatly from those usually employed but in one of the side passages which led to the base of the obelisk the pictured scenes differed entirely : the seasons of the year are bringing offerings to the king of all the events of each period, both on land and water, the growth of the plants, the increase of animals, the labours of mankind. It is possible that these lively scenes found a place in the temple because it is the sun god who causes all things to live and increase. If these sanctuaries of Re existed without a special cultus statue, because the obelisk was revered as a dwelling - place of the god; according to Egyptian ideas this in itself was a strange departure from accepted custom, for in every other cult the statue of the god was the most important object in the temple. On it rested - as later inscriptions state - the sod of the god when it carne out of heaven, as upon its b0dy.l Frequently, however, as these cultus statues are referred to, and many as are the copies of them that we possess, both large and small, yet not one of them appears to have survived to our day ; all seem to have fallen victims to the hatred of the Christians at the downfall of the Egyptian religion. In the later temples, however, we possess descriptions and representations from which we can form an accurate idea of them. The temple of Hathor of Dendera possessed, among others, the following sacred properties : 1 Dmnichen, Temp.

These ancient sacred statues were, therefore, not of great size - by far the greater number were only one ell, i. e. 16 inches high, and as a rule were made of wood. It was imperative that figures of the god should be drawn about at festivals, and this it would not be possible to do with the heavy stone statues. Then again, most of the figures of the gods were formed on the same model, and were only distinguished by the different heads, crowns, and attributes.

Would that there had been in these long speeches some trace of feeling for the sacred - ness of the place, the majesty of the god ; but all personal feeling had long disappeared from this ritual, and it was celebrated in a way that could not well have been more absurd, as though the whole religion in every temple consisted only of the history of Horus and Set, and that of Osiris. When the priest loosened the sealed cord that closed the chapel, he had to say : The cord is broken, and the seal looseized-I come, and I bring to thee the eye of Horus, thine eye belongs to thee, Horzis. Further, when he broke the clay of the seal, he said : the elriy is looseized, the waters of heaven are opened, the veins of Osiris are strelehed out - I do not come to clrive away the god from his throne ; I conze to set the god on his throne.

He saluted the god with repeated prostrations, and with chanting or repetition of hymns. He then took his vessels, which were close at hand in a box, and began the daily toilet of the god. Twice he sprinkled water over the statue from four jugs, he clothed it with linen bandages which were white, green, red, and reddish in colour, he anointed it with oil, painted it with green and black paints, and com - pleted its toilet in other respects. Finally he fed the god, by setting before him a variety of food and drink, bread, geese, haunch of beef, wine and water. Flowers also could no more be omitted from an Egyptian table of offerings than they could be from the dining-table of a noble. These daily offerings, the so-called permanent ones, were provided for out of the regular income of the temple; but in addition there were special arrangements for supplies for the great offerings on feast days. The amount of these offerings varied greatly, according to the wealth or the poverty of the different temples, and me must not take for granted that so much was everywhere offered to the gods, as was done later in the colossal temples of the New Kingdom. And yet in early times an extraordinary amount of food was disposed of in the great temples, and we cannot refrain from questioning what can have been done with these good things after they had lain the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS OF THE EARLY PERIOD 47 correct time before the god. It is well known that other ancient nations sought to ensure their offerings reaching the deity by burning them, and in Egypt also this custom was not unknown, but judging from the evidence of the later period we find it always remained the exception, and as the food would certainly not be allowed to be wasted, some use must have been found for it. From the grave inscriptions we learn of one method of dispos- ing of it which can only have been a make-believe. The dead desired to share in the food from the altar of the god, afh thegod hnd satisJied hinzselftherowith.l Thus it is evident that the divine offerings were subsequently presented to the distinguished dead of whom there was a statue in the temple (cf. chap. v.). In the same way a man of the New Kingdom desired that his body might be wrapped in clothing, of that which the god had taken of; thus the bandages in which the statue of the god was daily wrapped could also be ofYered to the dead as new clothing. But without doubt the ordinary use of the offerings, and one of which no mention is made, must have been that the priests appropriated them for their own use and that of their house- holds, when they had lain a sufficient length of time before the god. On feast days the assembled crowds in the temples shared this food and the festivals ended with a general banquet. A record of the New Kingdom 3 also tells us that different provision was made for the different ranks of the visitors : meals ready arranged were brought to the god of good bread, meat, cakes, and $at loaves, and of these 15 were in show baskets, 35 in gold bnslcets, and 895 in food baskets. While these and other good things were enjoyed by the princes and high officials, the ordinary visitors to the festival of many days’ duration received 90,250 ordinary loaves as provisions. As we have already seen, it was part of the regular duties of the priests to extol the god in songs in the daily ceremonial as well as at great festivals. We do not know whether these songs were merely recited or whether they were also sung; but we For instance, Cairo, 20514 ; 20642. Tomb of Puheri. B Kah.

It was the same with dancing, when occasionally at special religious festivals the people expressed their joy by leaping and jumping. There was no temple which did not celebrate some such festival. As a rule there were one or more principal feasts, celebrated on appointed days, when some of the most important events of the history of the god had occurred, perhaps the day when he was born, or on which he had defeated his enemies. Also they would celebrate the b@whag of periods of time, such as New Year’s day, or the first of the month. On these days, when the whole town is in festival as was said, the religious ceremonies were more ornate in character. The ritual was en - riched with special hymns, the temple was decorated, and there would also be an illumination, a lighting of lamps, both there and in the town. The offerings, as we have already remarked, would be so greatly increased that even the throng of guests who had crowded to the temple for the festival could be sufficiently supplied. The principal business on such a day was, however, that the people should behold the beauty of their lord; that the statue of the god should be exhibited. It was taken out of its chapel, and carried out of the holy of holies in a light shrine, accompanied by priests bearing a number of sacred objects and symbols on staves.

The litter on which tlie shrine was borne was frequently made in the form of a ship, for the Egyptians, ~7hose traffic, owing to the nature of the country, was almost entirely con - ducted by water, looked on the ship as the natural mode of transport. The god would also possess an actual ship, in case he had to cross the Nile for a festival, or, as sometimes happened, he had occasion to visit the friendly god of another city. As a rule the processions on feast days did not travel so far; they remained in the neighbourhood of the temple, and made their way perhaps to a second temple in the town or to some other sacred place. The reason why such and such a place should be visited, and that such and such customs should be observed there, may be sought in the traditions concerning the god, for the festival was frequently the celebration of some special day in his life. This led in very early times to the performance of scenes taken from the legends of the god. Thus we learn from a memorial stone in the Berlin museum that a distinguished treasurer who held office at Abydos under Sesostris 111.) and who took part in the Osiris festivals, twice had the honour of overthrowing the enemies of Osi~is, on one occasion on the day of the great strife. Ramses IV., however, kindled in the same place a light to Osiris on the day when his mummy was embalmed. He drove #et away from hirn, when he would have robbed him of his limbs. He established his son HOTUS as heir to his throne. And at the Horus festival at Abydos the same king spat on his eye after it had been seized by him who had subdued hirn (see p. 34). He gave him the throne of his father and his heritage in the whole land. He made his word true (see p. 35) on the dry of giving judgment. He caused hirn to pass through .Egypt and the red land as the representative of Har-alchte.l At another performance, the feast of the setting up of the Osiris column (p. 16), which was originally performed at Memphis, one A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION 1 Stela Ramses IT., Cairo (Mar.

It is probable that these were preliminaries preceding the enthronement of Horus, which was performed on the following day. As a fact these performances were later combined with another, that referred to the coming to the throne of the earthly king, to his jubilee, Tal J(INGI, PEPI I.

From the very first the rulers of Egypt considered themselves bound to present gifts to the more important temples of their dominions, and to provide for their building; this was for them a natural obligation. Furthermore it became the custom, in any temple which had been richly endowed by a king, to implore the blessing of the gods upon him before all others, while the temple inscriptions and scenes served as a perpetual reminder of him. But, strangely enough, the fiction soon arose that every temple was built exclusively by the king and was also sup - ported by him, so that all that was contributed by the devout citizens, and the revenues belonging to the temple, were entirely ignored. This continued throughout all periods, and even the Greek kings and Roman emperors were pleased to figure as the builders of all the temples that arose during their reigns. But what was this fiction compared with the monstrous concep- tion which in all the temples caused the king alone to take the place of mankind. For the official religion as it was accepted in the temples, there existed only the god and the king ; he served them, he built their temples, and made offerings to them, and they rewarded their beloved SON for his pious devotion with life for nzillions of yGars, with victory over his enemies and everlasting fame, The gods are no longer the gods of the Egyptian people, they are the gods of Pharaoh theiy son. And this relation of the sovereign to the deities is carried yet farther. If the king built a temple he did it not so much from devotion to the god, as for his own future glorification. He has made this as ?lis monument, thus begins every dedicatory inscription from the earliest times, and then follows the name of the temple which the king has built to the god his father. Certainly these are set phrases and inherited customs, but that suoh phrases and customs could have been evolved during the growth of the nation, and that later no one should have found them incongruous, is an undeniabIe proof of the poverty of this official religion. It is a natural result of this idea that the temple scenes give the impression that the priests are not present, but that the king takes their place, On all the walls the offerings and cere-"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS OF THE EARLY PERIOD 53 monies are represented as they mere performed before the god, but it is always the king who is officiating. Although we can understand that the king on some special occasion may have occasionally exercised priestly functions, yet that he should have taken part in the ceremonies of the countless temples of his dominions can only have been a theoretical possibility. The actrial performers at the Egyptian ceremonies must have been the priests, even though they represented themselves in the rituals as merely the delegates of the king? The natural relationship imposed on the more important families by the charge of a sanctuary which had existed in their town since the memory of man, prevailed in Egypt in the earliest times, and again in the Middle Kingdom we find in the greater temples that the priesthood remained in certain families, whose niembers generally adopted it as a secondary profession. And here we speedily arrive at another development; certain priestly orders are connected with certain professions. Thus the high judicial functionaries of the Old Kingdom are at the same time priests of the goddess of truth, the physicians are priests of Sekhmet, the great artists are priests of Ptah. At the head of every temple was a high - priest who acted as overseer of all the sacrecl o$ices, he is initiated into divine books and divine things and gives directions to the priests as mgulating the festivals. He has a loud voice when he praises the god and a pure hand when he brings $ewers and offem watw and food upon the altar.2 The administration of the temple property is incum - bent on him, and in war he has also to command the contingent provided by his temple. In the great sanctuaries these high - priests frequently bore special antiquated titles. Thus at Heliopolis the high - priest was called He who is great in beholding, perhaps because he could behold at pleasure the Feauty of his lord, i. e. the statue of the god ; while at Eshmunh he was great of tize$ve. At Memphis, where Ptah the god of artificers was worshipped, the title of the high - priest was the chief of the artificers, and in the Old Kingdom he held the position of superintendent of sculpture and all such Mariette, Abydos, I. 24.

The important position held by such high - priests was denoted by the peculiar decoration worn by them, of it character which, as the accompanying sketch shows, must evi - dently have dated from the earliest times. In the snialler temples all these acces - sories were of course less insisted on, and the dynasts of provincial towns were generally contented with the title Super - intendent of the priests. These I‘ priests” (literally divine serv - ants) were not all of the same class.

Other priestly titles which are frequently mentioned, such as that of the divine fathew, offer no explanation of their meaning. As we have said, for the greater number of these clerics the piiesthood was only a subsidiary occupation ; they formed the hourly priesthood of the temple or, as we may perhaps express it, alternating priests, who were divided into four sets, and alternately relieved each other in their duties. This at any rate was the system during the Middle Kingdom, when we have clear inforniation regarding these matters, niore especially from deeds belonging to a temple built by Sesostris 11. to Anubis, in WITH DECORATION ON THE BREAST AND WITH THE SIDE LOCK.

It will be seen that the power of the lay element in religious matters was not absent, notwithstanding the fiction of the king as sole priest. The laity were specially prominent in the wor - ship of the goddesses ; almost every lady of early times styled herself a priestess either of Neit or of Hathor. In this active participation of the people in the relib' QlOUS ceremonies there lay a security that, independently of the official religion, the relationship of individuals to their gods should not be lost. Those who were not connected with the temple as priests, might yet have it in their power to pray and offer sacrifices there to the god of the city."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"CHAPTER I11 RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND CUSTONS OF THE NEW KINGDOM D URING that earliest period, the religious beliefs of which we sketched in our first chapter, the religion of the Egyptian nation became more and more complicated. The principal gods of the people were worshipped as local gods under various names. In the historical period this particularism came to an end owing to the fact that at three periods, which lasted for many centuries, the whole country was united in one great common - wealth. This drew the religion into closer unity, and thus much which originally belonged to one town only, became gradually the common property of the whole nation. The earliest example of such dissemination we have already (p. 27) seen in the Osiris myth; as early as the Old Kingdom the belief in this god of the dead prevailed from the Delta to Elephantine, and in Memphis, Sokar, the ancient local god of the dead, appeared only as another name of Osiris. After the Middle Kingdom we meet with other similar combinations, even among gods who originally had no connection with each other. In the temple at Koptos the goddess Mut of Thebes was called at one time Bast, and at another time Sekhmet of Memphis,l although she was neither cat - nor lion - headed, but figured as a vulture. At the same period the god Min of Koptos was forced to appear merely as another name for the universally beloved Horus.

Few of these combinations can have become popular, but a different fate awaited the most important of them all, and for a thousand years the hybrid Anion - Re re - mained the foremost of all the Egyptian gods. During the early period, the town of Thebes in Upper Egypt was so unimportant that the an - cient religious texts do not refer in any way to it or its gods ; neither did the ancient chiefs of the neigh - bourhood revere its god Amon, but worshipped Mont, the god of the neighbouring Hermonthis. It was only in the Middle Kingdom, when t,wo families came to the throne, both of whom were of Theban ori- gin-they bore such names as He F IG . 45.

It is true that he was not the god of the royal city, for that was situated in Middle Egypt in the vicinity of the Fayum, but an inimense temple was built for him. Amon became an important provincial god, and so did his consort Mut, who was also called Amaunet, a feminine form of the name Amon. She came to the fore with her husband, and, as we have already remarked, was also merged in a com - pound form, with Bast and Sekhmet. But the great period for the Theban deities dawned with the beginning of the New Empire. During the confusion which followed the twelfth dynasty, and during the foreign rule of the Hyksos, Thebes was the residence of a princely family, who worshipped Anion - Re, as he was"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"58 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION henceforth called. It was this family that succeeded in driving out the Hyksos, and as they acquired possession of the whole of the country, and made Thebes their royal residence, it naturally followed that Amon - Re, the Icing of the gods, should forthwith become the official god of the kingdom. Fate also decreed that these kings who had raised Amon - Re to such prominence should also allot him a degree of power which had hitherto been quite unexampled in Egypt. From the Euphrates far away to the Xoudan, all countries paid tribute to the Pharaoh, and over the whole of this immense territory the fame of the god was spread abroad. With some of the wealth which flowed into Egypt, these Pharaohs and their descendants also built the colossal temples of Thebes, as thankofferings for the victories to which he had led them, and in other towns of their dominion they built sanctuaries to him, so that in every place the god of the ruling house might be worshipped. Thus for a long time he was the supreme deity, although originally he was merely an artificial conception, and possessed little individuality which was not borrowed from other gods. There is a hymn of the New Kingdom in which this god, with many names without nuinber,l is adored, and in reading it, one cannot fail to notice that, setting aside his name, and the mention of Karnak, there is not much else which directly refers to Anion. What there is consists only of various plays on his name, as c;rZief of mankind, whose name 4s secret (urnon) from his children, and a mention of his lofty plumes? What is actually said of him belongs peculiarly to two other deities whose names are connected with him-Min and Re. When it is said of hiin that the gods love his saaozcr when he comes forthhorn Punt (the land of incense) and that he is Yich in sweet scents when he returns from the land of the Matoi, or when he is called the Horus of the East for whom the desert provides gold and silver, and lapis lazuli at his desire, all manner of incense in the land of the Matoi, and ficsh myrrh for his nostrils, these are all things which are said in extolling his neighbour, Min of Koptos, the 1 Hymn to Amon, Cairo, 9, 3. 2 All that follows where not otherwise noted is taken from the hymn to Anion at Cairo."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"BELIEFS AND CUSTOMS OF NEW KINGDOM 59 guardian of travellers in the desert. It is true that Min and Amon, as we have already (page 19) seen, were probably of identical origin, but the character of protector of the desert, borne by Min, can never have been shared with Amon, as his town of Thebes did not, lie on the great desert road. Yet more incompatible appears the combination with Re. The god is referred to as Re, Chepre, or Atum ; he is the bull of Heliopolis; or the resplendent one in the house of Benhen (page 27); he traverses the heavens in peace and is lord of the evening- and morning-bark (page 11).

It was inevitable that the priests and worshippers of the ancient gods should resent this. Hac1 not Ptah of Memphis and Atum of Heliopolis previously been the supreme gods, when nothing was known of Amon, god of that obscure town of Thebes ? Was it right that all these other gods should be over - shadowed? It was a matter of course that such jealousies should arise, and had it not been for the existence of a strong party antagonistic to the god, the great upheaval which we must now consider, and hy which the power of Re was overthcown, at least for a time, could only have been carried out with greatest difficulty. This upheaval is the so - called religious reform of Amenophis IV., the most remarkable episode we meet with in the history of ancient Egypt. Unfortunately our information with regard to this period is of the slightest ; it consists only of what we can gather and recover from the inscriptions, and of these the revengeful jealousy of the priests took care that little should survive for the future. Nevertheless we may, without excessive rashness, seek the cause of these events in the extra - ordinary conditions which prevailed at that time in Egypt. The war against Syria was followed in the fifteenth century by an undisturbed period in which Egypt exercised her immense power and acquired a position in the civilized world of that time to which she had never before attained. All this would necessarily produce an impression on the people, and in a short time a greater change occurred in feeling and ideas than centuries had hitherto produced. The horizon of the nation had widened, and there began a breaking up of the old rigid and narrow - minded Egypt. Canaan and Syria now belonged to the great empire, their princes lived at the Egyptian court, and since commerce and communication had rendered the Egyptians familiar with their foreign ideas and language, it was no longer possible for them to be contemned as vile bcwbayians. The position of the kings also was radically altered; the Pharaoh could no loiiger be exrlusively the lord of the two Egypts, the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"62 A 1~ANL)BOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION follower of Horus; he became a human king like his neigh - bours, the kings of Mitani and Babylonia. This appears forcibly in the case of Amenophis III., whose long and peaceful reign was followed by the great upheaval. Although, as tradition compelled, he is still represented in the temple as a demi-god, on the great scarabs which he caused to be made to celebrate remarkable events of his reign, he permits the entirely human side of his career to appear. As though he were no Egyptian king he tells LIS how he slew 110 lions, that he chased a herd of wild oxen, and that a daughter of the king of Mitani was sent to him accompanied by 317 maidens. But above all, he informs the world that he, the all mighty king, has wedded Tyi, daughter of Yua and Tua, the favoured child of private people, and has made her his queen. When we read this, and reflect how little such state- ments are in accordance with the Egyptian sentiment of royalty, we cannot doubt that the king who chose to appear thus, must have gone far towards deserting his national position, Egypt then began, as we should now express it, to become a modern State, and it was under these circumstances that Amen- ophis IV. ascended the throne, and soon engaged in the conflict which was destined for a time to divert all modes of thought into other directions. Was this his own undertaking, or did he merely carry out a schenie commenced bj7 his father ? At any rate, he succeeded in BIG. 47. BROM A BUILDING OB AMENOPHIS Iv. AT THEBES. To the right is the king praying, the sun above him : to the left the sun god in his ancient form, but already with his new name. (Berlin, 2072.) diverging from the paths hitherto followed. His first attempt"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"BELIEFS AND CUSTOMS OF NEW KINGDOM 63 was to reinstate the ancient sun god Re Har-akhte, who, as we have seen, had been superseded by Amon, as supreme god of the State. To this end he built new temples to him at Ttiebes, Memphis, Heliopolis, and other cities. By doing this he no doubt complied with the wishes of the priests of the ancient gods; but that he himself had further views in doing so, is shown by his representing the sun god under a new form, and also introducing a new name. Instead of the old hawk - headed figure of the god, a new one now appeared, consisting of the disc of the sun itself; from this descended rays, ending in hands which held the sign of life. At times the uraeiis serpent is hanging from its lower edge, an allegorical addition, which recalls an Egyptian conception. It was a mode of representing the god which could be understood by Syrians and Nnbians alike, and we may well question whether such a reason did not lie behind its invention. For a great empire of the old world a universal form of religion would prove a powerful bond of union, and if it was desired to invent such a god, it was far easier to introduce a colourless universal sun god, than one which was purely Egyptian, as was the case with Amon. If, however, we study the new name of the god, Har-alchte who tyiuvaphs on the horizon in his name “spleiadozw, who is in the disc of the sun,” we shall see in it the co-operationof learned speculation. No simple-minded worshipper of Re Har-akhte would thus have designated his god. It is a subtle title, which undoubtedly should be interpreted in its abstract meaning, that it was not the actual planet that was worshipped, but the being who manifests himself therein. As later on we find the king describing himself as the teacher of this new faith, we may perhaps ascribe to him personally this theological conception. Also when we observe among the circle surrounding the king in later years, the Queen Mother Tyi, and his favourite the subordinate priest Ei, husband to the king’s nurse, and take into account the peculiarly morbid countenance of the Pharaoh, we are tempted to construct from all this a history which more than once in the annals of the world has proved the end of a great royal house. One thing is, however, clear, that the introduction of the new cult promptly met with opposition, and that this opposition"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"64 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION originated with the followers of Amon. For the king turned with embittered animosity against this god and determined to overthrow him. Nothing should remain in Xgypt which could call to niind Amon or his wife Mut - not even their names. Wherever the word Amon appears in a temple, in a tomb, or upon some object it must be erased, even though the monuments of the king’s ancestors were greatly damaged in so doing. As his own name Amedmtp (Amon is content) by a most unfortunate coincidence contained this hated word, the king discarded it, and called himself instead Ikh - en - aton, “glory of the sun’s disc.” The fanaticism which is here apparent carried him farther in his religious work and led to consequenccs which he cannot have originally intended. His sun god, who bad been refused a position by the side of Amon, must now take his place, and in future he must be represented only as the sui1 with far - reaching rays. The ancient name €Tar-akhte must alone be retained in the official titulary of the god, his ordinary name must be Aton 4 %, the sun’s disc, a word which in sound and appearance might appear adapted to take the place of the wonted Amow Re 9 9. Not only was the new sun god to be the supreme deity, but lie must be tlic sole one. Let those who mill believe in Ptali and I-Iathor, Osiris and Isis, but for the loyal subjects of the king there must henceforth be only the one god whom he worshippcd. And as an oriental king is not accustomed to lack “loyal followers,” it is easy to understand that for ten or twenty years the new faith actually prevailed, at least among the upper classes of the people. The form taken by this new belief we can infer from a long hymn, which beyond any doubt obtained official standing in the cult.

A comparison of this magnificent hymn with the hymns to the ancient sun god, or with those quoted above to Amon - Re, will show the fundamental differences between them. They all alike adore the god. as creator and protector of the world and of all living things. But the later hymn knows nothing of the ancient name of the sun god, of his crowns, sceptres, and sacred cities. It knows nothing of his barks and crew, nor of the dragon Apophis. Nothing of the journey through the realms of the dead, and the joy of those dwelling there. It is a song which might equally well be uttered by a Syrian or by an Ethiopian in praise of the sun. In fact, the manner in which these lands and their inhabitants are referred to in the hymn suggest that it was intended to put an end to the contempt with which the Egyptians had looked down on the vile barbarians. All men are children of the god ; he has given them different complexions and different languages, and has set them in different countries, but he cares for all alike, and if to one he gives his Nile, to another he gives his rain,"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"BELIEFS AND CUSTOMS OF NEW KINGDOM 67 This new faith resembles our own so closely, that we feel our sympathies unconsciously drawn to its courageous founder. And yet if we consider dispassionately what Anienophis IV. actually attempted, we shall eventually realize that justice and common- sense are rather to be sought for on the side of his opponents, however distasteful the cause they represent may be to us. For the time had not yet come for such a religion as that of Akhenaton, which was not national, but based on a universal human standpoint. And again, it was a cruel injustice to over - throw the established historical belief of the people, with which their whole life was interwoven, and to force upon them a doctrine devised with such bold independence. Amenophis IV. was no reformer, he was an enlightened despot, who wished to establish by force the deism of his day in place of the hereditary religion ; such an audacious attempt could only impede the healthy development of the new creed. How the people accommodated themselves to the dogma of their king is shown in two small monuments now in the Berlin Museum. From the tombs all conceptions hitherto held must be banished; that the deceased should implore the sun to grant him the certainty of beholding him, and to give him the fresh breath of the north wind: was quite correct, but of Osiris and his kingdom no more must be heard. Those who have read the fifth chapter, dealing with the funerary customs, and have seen how these numerous funerary customs were the growth of centuries, and the many hopes and fears connected with their observance, will realize what it would cost the Egyptians to renounce them. The consequence was that the people did not lose sight of them in the new religion, but in a spirit of contradiction they even introduced them into their new religious practices, There was no longer an Osiris nor a kingdom of the dead, but even now the great scarab, which was there efficacious (p. 142), was inscribed with a prayer to the Aton and laid near the mummy? The pyramid that enabled the dead man to be - hold the sun (p. 143) is scarcely in accordance with the new religion, and yet it was found desirable to lay this also by the side of the deceased, only ensuring that the figure and name of the Lepaina Uemkmaler, 107a. 2 Berlin, 15089,"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"68 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION Aton were on it.l Those figures intended to work for the dead (p. 141) in the realms of Osiris could not be dispensed with, even the grave of the monarch was provided with them, and on them also a most incongruous prayer to the Aton is inscribed. The king himself could not escape the anomaly that his own position as demi-god and sole representative of mankind was a survival of the ancient religion. From this Amenophis IV. did not free himself. He remains the son of the body of the god, and at the close of every hymn of any length which recognizes the god as the father of mankind, he is introduced in these terms : None other knows thee, except thy son the Icing. We may take for granted that the king was also represented in the usual fashion as the sole yepresentative of the god in the great temple he built to the god, although none of his reliefs have survived t,o our time. This great sanctuary was not situated on any of the sites which had been consecrated places from early days, for all of these were closely associated with recollections not to be tolerated by the adherents of a faith that acknowledged a god beside whom there was no other. The king most wisely built a new capital for the new Egypt, the city whose ruins we now call Tell Amarna. In this great city created by him, Amenophis IV. lived for over ten years surrounded by his loyal subjects who had henrlcened to his tenehing. The brilliant life that was led there during that period is shown in the tombs near the city. On a critical examination we learn from them all that is most characteristic of the whole episode, so that we can here pass it in review. As in the religion the king desired to renounce all the dead traditions, so in art also he attempted to shak2 them off, and in both cases he found it necessary to dispose of the traditions of thousands of years by an entirely independent creation. Here also every man must see the world with his own eyes, and here also must every man rejoice in universal humanity and lay more stress on that than on national life. These scenes therefore show us the king and queen affectionately embracing one another, or drinking wine and eating fruit 1 Eerlin, 14123."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"BELIEFS AND CUSTOMS OF NEW KINGDOM 69 together, and rarely are the children of the king omitted, the young princesses ; the eldest talking to her mother, the second amusing herself with the crown, and the youngest fondled in the arms of the king and kissed by him, as we see them on a relief in the Berlin collection. But prettily as all this is represented, Flu. 48. AMENOPHIS IV. WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN . Over them is the new form of sun god. (Berlin, 14145.) the new art, like the new religion, was on an unsound basis, and neither of them proved permanent. At the death of the king, he was followed on the throne by various successors, who reigned only a short time, and who soon considered it incumbent on them to make their peace with Amon, and to remove once more to Thebes. With the prince Haremheb, who at one time was himself a follower of the Aton, a family succeeded to the throne which had done more than any other for Amon of Thebes. The triumph of the ancient religion was complete, and all the records and buildings of the heretics were now in their turn demolished. Proudly did the followers of Amon extol their god : Woe to him who injures thee ! Thy city"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"70 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION endures, but the city of him who injures thee hasperished. Shame upon him who commits sacrilege against thee in any land. . . . The sun of him who knew thee not has set; but he who 7cnows thee, he shines; the sunetuary of him who injured thee lies in darkness, and the whole earth is in light? It was in very truth darkness which descended upon the horrible blasphevner of Tell Amarna ; every memorial of him vanished, and it was only in modern times that Lepsius undertook to restore his name and his deeds once again to the light of day after more than three thousand years of oblivion. So Amon-Re triumphed, and how magnificent was his triumph is shown by the immense temples erected to him during the next ten years, and by the wealth of which he had command ; but closer examination shows that the great convulsion had not passed without leaving traces behind. The State made peace with Amon and restored him to his rights, but it also supported the ancient gods of the great towns, Ptah of Memphis, Re Har-akhte of Heliopolis, Osiris of Abydos, etc., far more zealously than it had done previously; never had a sovereign built or rebuilt so many temples as did Ramses 11.; there is scarcely a temple in Egypt that did not receive proofs of his pious care, as if to counterbalance what he was doing for Amon in Karnak and Luxor. A political force was at work here. During the latter half of the New Kingdom, Lower Egypt increased greatly in importance, the royal residence was removed to a town in the Delta, and Upper Egypt once more sank into the subordinate position which naturally belonged to it,. And thus in course of time the observance of the god of Thebes naturally declined. In this second half of the New Kingdom, during the nineteenth and twentieth dynasties (about 1350 - 1100 B .c.) we find the Egyp - tian religion more magnificent and brilliant than it ever was before or after. Its gods were enthroned in those palatial temples which have no rivals in any other country or at any other period ; temples that glistened with costly vessels, and where 1 Inscriptions in the hierat.

The property of the principal temples was immense. Under Ramses 111. the temple of Amon at Thebes possessed 926 square miles of land and 81,322 serfs, as well as 421,362 head of cattle. Heliopolis had 166 square miles of land, 12,963 serfs, and 45,544 head of cattle; while the respective numbers for Memphis, which was far behind, were nearly 11 square miles, 3,079 serfs, and 10,047 cattle. Such property and such temples naturally could not be administered in the simple fashion of earlier days, although no doubt it still prevailed in the smaller temples. They required a complete administrative organization, where distinguished persons served as superin - tendents of the treasury, of the land, granaries, cattle, or peasantry, with scribes and soldiers, architects, sculptors, painters, and all classes of minor officials. The superior priests of such a temple had immense power in their hands, and the high-priests of Amon especially were men of almost royal rank. The career of such a prince of the Church is described to us by one of them, Bekenkhons, a contemporary of Ramses 11.) on his statue at Munich. He was apparently successor of another Bekenkhons, who was high-priest of Amon under Amenophis III., and had already lived as an infant in the house of Amon. Although from the first he was destined for the office of apriest, up to his fifteenth year he received, in common with other youths of rank, a military training as overseer of the stables to the king. He then entered as we’b (p. 54) into the service of Amon, and remained four years in this lowest rank of priest - hood, He had then to serve twelve years as divine father, fifteen years as third priest, and twelve years as second. He was thus in his fifty-ninth year when the god made him, on account of his amazing excellence, the high-priest of Amon, an office he was destined to fill for twenty-six years, as a good father of the suboydina tes, who tyained their successors, stretched out the hand to those in misery, who fed the poor, and acted nobly in his temple. Also he was Jirst architect for the king for Thebes, and in this capacity adorned it with buildings and obelisks ; he planted it with trees and otherwise arranged for the lordly equipment of Karnak."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"72 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION In such propitious circumstances, it is no subject for wonder that there should be an increasing tendency among the priests to form themselves into a separate class, distinct from the laity even in external appearance. However distinctive their vestments might be, the priests also avoided the ordinary clothing of the period. While the laity at this time clothed the upper part of the body, the priests merely wore the short skirt of the Old Kingdom, or the longer one of the Middle Kingdom, as though in this way they wished to show their connection with past ages. Ncither did they adopt the elaborate hairdressing which was the fashion of the day, but shaved their heads completely, so that the office of temple barber was so sinecure. The reason for this must be sought, where the later Egyptians themselves found it, in the attempt to attain absolute cleanliness. Purity before all things was demanded of the priests; it is no empty phrase that we find at the entrance of the inner courts of the templcs : .Let every oiLe who enters here be pwe. At the ceremony of initiation OF priests to the temple they actually bathed in the lake that was situated near the temple. During the New Kingdom, one blanch of religious work was retained in the hands of the laity, of the women. Almost every lady took her part in the temple ceremonies as singer, and performed with the sistrum before the beazit$%l countenance of the god. Such singing women existed in every town and every temple, but it is, of course, the singers of Amon whom we meet with most freqnently, and who were united in a special organization. As we have already seen (p. 39), the ceremonial attendance on a god, according to Egyptian ideas, in no way differed from the usual service paid to a man of rank in his own house. His servants provided his food and clothing, while the women who performed music before him may be regarded as the hareem, who cheered their lord with music. In Thebes this fiction was carried farther. Unlike other ladies, the wife of the high-priest was not called a singer of Amon, bub bears the title of his chief coneubina. The queen moreover, or one of the princesses, figures as the wife of the god, or as she is also called, divi?ze votnress."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"BELIEFS AND CUSTOMS OF NEW KINGDOM 73 The duties of these divine wives consisted only of perform - ing music before the god, but their position was one of the greatest dignity, and, what was more, ensured them a large income. As early as the beginning of the New Empire, they appear to have played at any rate a considerable part in politics. As we shall see, they became later actual rulers over an ecclesiastical principality. While we regard with astonishment the immcnse develop - ment of this official religion in the New Kingdom, we shall feel more sympathy with the faith of the lower and upper classes of the people, which pursued its quiet way outside the temple, and of which we occasionally find traces. If we study the small stela dedicated to some god by private people, or the small figures of gods which stood in private houses, or read the inscriptions carved on rocks in the desert, we become acquainted with all manner of sacred beings who were not recognized by the great temples. Among these are foreign gods from Palestine, Phcenicia and Syria, brought to Egypt by soldiers or mer - chants, which figure chiefly as terrible deities, furious in warfare, or stirring up storms at sea. Among these is Baal the terrible, and Resheph, who car - ries lance and shield, Astarte, who drives a was chariot, Ke - desh who stands on a lion, Anat, and that Astarte who as a I goddess of war is F I G . 49.

All this had entailed a loss on those to whom he had first owed his position, for the higher he rose in popular estimation, so much the more he became estranged from the hearts of the people. So great and lofty was he that the humble man could not venture to trouble him with the daily needs of body and soul; he was placed high above the people, like the king, to whom honour was accorded, as ruler and governor of all things, but who could not be confided in by the individual. When religion developed in this direction, the necessity felt by mankind for a superhuman helper and friend led to the introduction of new deities. The great gods were too distant, but there were yet other sacred beings of lower rank, and it was perhaps more possible for thein to share the cares of mankind, Among the names given by the people of Abydos to their children in the Middle Kingdom occur such as these, gqt of the Neshrnet bark or of the Neshmet bark a son, as though in gratitude to the bark of the Osiris temple for the birth of a child; the temple furniture, which was seen during the processions, was also venerated by the people of Abydos as their great god, whom all Egypt w0rshipped.l We find the same in the New Empire, when the Egyptians of the middle classes named their children by preference after the god Bes, and the goddess Thoueris, and placed the figures of these sacred beings in their houses, notwithstanding that this bandy-legged Bes, and this hippopotamus-shaped Thoueris, in the religion of the priests and of the temples were only known as inferior assistants of the great gods. Bes is only one of a number of male and female demons, who may almost be compared to the satyrs of the Greeks. They are half animal and half human, whose duty is to amuse the gods with music and dancing or to tend the divine children.

On the west bank of Thebes, however, where the necropolis city of the royal residence was situated, which gave occupation to a large population of funerary priests, stone- masons, officials employed in the administration, and police, patron saints were found in the kings buried there in earlier tiGes, and whose tomb rites were still observed.

At Berlin there is a memorial tablet which represents a temple official of Heliopolis worshipping before the Mnevis bull, as early as the beginning of the New Kingdom. When the bull or the cat died, it was buried with a certain amount of display, and in a place that already enjoyed the odour of sanctity. We possess the coffin of one of the sacred cats dedi- cated to it by Amenophis 111.1 And for the tombs of the Apis bulls one of the sons of Ramses II., a high - priest of ;Ptah, made most careful provision. Reverence for these tombs was carried so far that the dead oxen were actually provided, as though they had been human beings, with funerary figures to work for them in the next world (p. 141). Gladly would we know what the lower classes, who found satis - faction in these lesser divinities, actually thought of the universe and of the gods. Some insight into this will be afforded us by the stories of the New Kingdom, which, as in all cases, reflect the conceptions and ideas of the lower classes, although it may be the more educated people who have preserved them for US.^ The principal god of the tradition is Re Har-akhte, while Ainon is actually not named. Re is lord of the world, who aids the good people against the wicked. Accompanied by the Znnead of the gods he descends to earth like a king with his followers, to look after the just. Hhnum is also present and creates mankind. At the birth of a child come the seven Hathor goddesses and discover what fate his god has allotted to him, and even though a man attempt to escape his destiny the god verily does what he will. That there should be marvellous trees, and bulls of every beautiful CO~OZLT, and that it is well to bring offerings to them, does not appear surprising after the facts just quoted (p. 78).

Thus, in an official document,l death is designated as the destiny, and there is also a deit*y of this name who indeed appears rather to bestow a happy fate. While the people thus adjusted their own beliefs, the educated classes pondered over their gods, and over the universe, and while they thus analyzed and philosophized their religious beliefs became less fixed. More and more they minimized the differences between the individual ancient gods, and the more complicated became their religion. It was in the house of life, i. e. the school of the learned, that this wisdom was acquired, but that it also flourished outside the schools, among the educated classes, is shown by many songs of this period, which prove by their freshness that they were not composed in the house of life and which yet contain these ideas. We must next hear what is told us by Ramses IT. on his memorial tablet at Abydos of what he had learnt in the course of his researches in the house of life aniong the books, which he did not cease to esteem. He found there that thy nature, Osiris, is more secret than that of all gods. Thou art the moon whichis in heaven. Thou rejuvenatest thyself at thy desire, thou becomest yomg aecoiding to thy wish.

In its place the parts usually played by the moon and the Nile are attributed to Osiris.

He had a soul in his Tight eye, the sun, he had another in his left eye, the moon: he is Shu, the god of the air, with tke noble aspect in the foiw winds. He is Osiris. It is he who can invest his body with all forms as he wishes, and the gods of the provinces are his forms? In a document which was drawn up at Eshmunen, it is set forth how Amon made hiniself a position everywhere, in order that his names might be many.3 His original position had been on the heights of Eshminnen, where he landed from the Descles water, when he emerged out of the flood in a secret egg (p. 26). The goddess of heaven stood behind him as Arnaunet (p. 57)) and he seated himself on this cow and grasped her horns, and swain across the flood and They are upon thy back. A. Z. 38. 32.

In Ehnas, where he first landed, he became the local god Harsaphes ; in Mendes he is the ram which is worshipped there ; in Sais he is the son of Neith, i. e. Sobk; he is the ram of Heliopolis; he is Nun, the primeval waters; he is the god Ptah Tenen of Memphis; he is Ptah, who is worshipped at Thebes ; he is Min of Koptos; he is Mont of Thebes. The Nile, most ancient of the gods, is another form of him, and his is heaven, earth, the under - world, water, and air. Where all the gods are so confused nothing really remains of the ancient Egyptian religion except the external form; the names and figures of the gods are still there, but what they represent are only varying aspects of the universe, and so far this teaching may actually be called pantheistic. The same educated classes who held these ideas now made another departure from tradition. Hitherto whoever prayed to the gods, or sang hymns in their honour, had made exclusive use of the ancient traditional formulq which indeed contained few ideas, but which were hallowed by centuries of use. In the latter half of the New Kingdom this was changed, and the new ideas and feelings which pervaded Egyptian life at this period evoked a new type of religions poetry, that allowed free scope to individual feelings and sentiments. Another proof of its popular character is that it is no longer written in the sacred language of the earlier literature, but is expressed in the later colloquial language. The oldest and finest example of this poetry is the hymn of Arnenopbis IV. (p. 64); also the hymn to Amon-Re, which we have already quoted (p. 58)) where the god is adored as creator and protector of all, and which was already composed in the new style. A comparison of such poems with one of the older compositions, for instance with the hymn to Osiris (p. 48)) will show a very great change. In the one are lifeless references to a variety of tradi - tions, in the other there is individual feeling, and the joy of observing the works and the goodness of God.

I do not follow anxiety in my heart, what Amon - Re saith, eonzeth to pass.3 Thus he unhesitatingly lays before him all the troubles of his heart : Thou wilt save me from the mouth of men in the day when they speak lies? He who is slandered by some rival in order to obtain his ofice, prays to the sun god, or to Osiris, to aid him ; 6 and again another pleads thus : Anzon, lend thine ear to one who stands alone in the eowt of justice, who is poor, and his opponent is mighty. The tribunal oppresseth him ; '' silver and gold for the scribe, and clothes for the attendants !', but he Jindeth that Amolz ehangeth himself into the vizier, whereby the poo~ escape? It is also actually stated in this poetry that the god directly espouses the cause of the poor; when all are against him, then he remains his protector, the judge who receives no bribes, and does not influence the witnesses? In one of these songss there is also observable (as we have already seen on the memorial tablet of Nefer-Abu) an acknowledgment of the sinfulness of mankind. The Egyptians of the early period cannot have been ignorant that we are all sinners, but before their gods they made no use of this know - ledge ; to them they always made assurances of their excellence. It is otherwise with the poet of the New Empire; he knows that he is a guilty man and prays to his god : Chastise me not according to my many sins.

A new epoch of religious conception had been inaugurated by the educated people of that period, the same period whose later development produced the Psalms. In Egypt itself it came to an end before it attained to full development, and in the history of ancient Egypt it is thus only an episode. What were tbe causes that interrupted this development we do not know, for during the next century Egypt vanishes almost entirely from our view. When we see it once more, political misfortunes have broken its power ; the Egyptians had become a decaying nation who lived only in their past. 1 Max. d’dnii. 6. 12. 2 ib. 7. 3. 5 Sallier Papyrus, 1, 8, 2 et seg. ib. 6, 12 ; 2, 3. ib. 3, 2."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV BELIEFS REGARDING THE DEAD, OF THE EARLY PERIOD AND OF THE NEW KINGDOM IF there was a point on which the Egyptians differed from every other nation it was in their excessive care for the dead. Other nations have erected buildings for the worship of the gods, or for practical purposes, which may vie with the colossal temples of Egypt, but such graves as the Great Pyramids, or the rock tombs of Thebes, exist nowhere else in the world. This must also strike any one who observes in our miiseums the immense variety of objects that were laid in the graves for the use of the deceased in his future existence. The Egyptians would not have persisted in these strenuous efforts during three thousand years had they not possessed very special views as to the future destiny of the dead, views which we can comprehend to-day, thanks to their ancient literature which has come down to us in almost immeasurable abundance. It is true that it is not literature in the exact meaning of the word, or only in the slightest degree. At best it consists only of short or long formulze, which from the earliest times were recited at the graves. Of these formuh there are two great collections, from which we gather most of our knowledge of the subject ; the so - called Pyramid texts, and the so - called Book of the Dead. The Pyramid texts is the name given by us to the long inscriptions in certain pyramids of the end of the Old Kingdom, which supplied the deceased kings with something approaching a library of ancient writings bearing on their future destiny. The greater part of these are extremely ancient, and were formulated at the earliest stages of Egyptian civilization.

It is there - fore to the Pyramid texts that we must turn in the first instance to discover what it was that induced the Egyptians to bestow so much care on offerings to the dead. The difference between the living and the non-living was from the earliest times regarded by the Egyptians to be this, that the former were imbued by a special active force, which they called the ka. Every mortal received this ka at birth, if Re commanded it, and as long as he possessed it, as long as he is loyd of a ka, and goes with his ka, so long he is one of the The ka is seen by no one, but it living.

As early as the time when the sun god first came into existence, and formed the two primeval gods by spitting them out of his mouth (p.26)) he laid his arms bel~ind them, and forthwith his ka went up over them and they lived? This stretching out the arms must be specially connected with the investing with a ka, for from the earliest times two outstretched arms sig - nified a ka. When the man died, his ka left him, but it was hoped that it would still concern itself with the body in which it had dwelt so long, and that at any rate it would occasionally re-animate it. Aiid it was probably for the ka that the grave was so carefully attended and provided with food, that it might not hunger or thirst. In addition to this ka, which always remained a vague and undefined conception, notwithstanding the constant allusions to it, the Egyptians dreamed also of a soul, which might be seen under various forms. At death it left the body and flew away, thus it was naturally a bird, and it was only probable that when the mourners were lamenting their loss, the dead man himself might be close at hand, sitting among the birds on the trees 1 Mariette, Abydos, Tableau xvi."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"BELIEFS REGARDING THE DEAD 87 which he himself had planted. The thoughts of others turned to the lotus flowers which had blossomed on the pool during the night, and questioned whether the dead man might not be there; or again to the serpellt which crept out of its hole S O mysteriously as a son of the earth, or to the crocodile that crawled out of the river on to the bank, as though its true home were the land ; who could tell whether the soul was not able to assume any of these forms and others also that it desim?, and whether it did not abide here to - day and there to-morrow in every place where it wosi1d.l Further thought, moreover, as to whether there might not be an abode for the dead similar to our world of the living, would an abode could be situated. Every evening the Egyptian saw the sun sink in the west, to reappear at dawn in the east; during the night it must there - fore have traversed an under-world,a second subterranean heaven. It was only natural to claim this world, which was unapproach - able for the living, as the abode of the dead. The sun sank in the west and sojourned there in a dark country which was only illuminated when he performed his nightly course and travelled through it. This conception early became popular, the realms of the dead were styled the West, and the dead were called the dwellers in the west. It must be confessed that neither of these modes of life can be regarded as happy. Whether a man fulfilled his destiny under the earth, or appeared on earth in a variety of forms, it was in either case a melancholy existence, and no true life. It occurred, therefore, to some bold thinkers to doubt whether 1 It is impossible to doubt the extreme antiquity of this popular belief, although we first meet with it in the Book of the Dead.

Beside the many on earth who were poor and of small account, were there not some who were great and mighty, and might there not be the same distinction after death; there must surely exist better conditions and a better abode for the kings and other distinguished souls, for those who should live accoding to the command of the gods: and this place was in heaven. The Egyptian could watch the stars as they sailed at night in that untroubled splendour vhich is exhibited by the gorgeous sky of his country. Of these he kuew several which shone with especial brilliancy, the dog star, Orion, the morning star, and thought these might assuredly be gods who, like the sun god, had left the earth. But what about the innumerable host of nameless stars that surrounded even the least of these ? Doubtless they were the dead, happy souls, who had found their way to heaven, and who now wandered in eternal glory with the gods. The great god the lord of heaven (i. e. the sun god) hac! held out his hand to them, or the goddess of heaven had taken them to herself, and had ranged them among the inz- perishable stars of her body. Now, perhaps, does the deceased appear to us as that single star which rises on the eastern side of the heavens: and which with Orion and Sothis, the dog star, traverses the sky. \" The imagination of the nation was actively engaged in giv - ing definite form to this idea of the heavenly existence of the dead ; how motley and contradictory was the picture thus formed will be shown in the following sketch, supplied by the earliest of the Pyramid texts.

If among the deceased there is one of whom it can be said, ‘‘ there is no evil which he hath done,” the saying penetrates even to the sun god, and he receives him kindly;6 the deceased also profits with regard to his reception in heaven, @@he has never spoken evil of the king nor slighted the gods?

These examples taken from the pyramid texts are undoubtedly only adaptations of yet more ancient formuls. So accustomed were the Egyptians to these utterances of the ancient dogmas, that they could not omit them from their newer beliefs. An ancient formula which was widely in use runs thus : Happy those who see, and well for those who hehold- say the gods - this god ascending to heaven . . . with his soul upon him, with his knife at his side, and the mayic with him . . . thou ascendest to heaven, and dost meet him, The later adaptation runs thus : Happy he who sees the father-suith Isis - and well for him who beholds the fathev--saith flephthys- to his futher, to Osiris, when he ascends to heaven, among the stars, among the immortals, with the headcloth on the head, with the kntye at the side, and the magic with him.

We must confess that the change has not improved it either in meaning or in beauty. Yet more barbarous is the use made of an ancient formula which extols the sky goddess who, by raising herself up, had snatched up the gods with her into the heights. Averse of this formula ran thus: Nut, thou art crowned as king because thou didst take possession of the gods, their souls, their inheritance, their food, and all that they posses^.^ This has been freely used as follows: Osiris, thou art crowned as king of Upper and Lower Egypt, because thou didst take possession of the gods, and their souls? Although certainly the beneficent Osiris never carried off the gods from the earth. It is also noteworthy that in this variation the old word in Lower Egypt for a king has given place to the official Pharaonic title - a clear sign of the late origin of the compilation. In other respects, again, the ancient funerary literature was not improved by the dissemination of the Osiris beliefs. There had previously been no lack of conflicting ideas, and now the jumble was complete. Read for instance the following text, which affords a good instance of this confusion: Awake for HOTUS and stand up against Set, raise thysex thou eldest son of Keb.

What a muddle it is! In the first sentence the dead man is Osiris himself, in the second he travels to Orion, in the third he is a star with Re, in the fourth he reigns as a king of the dead and of the stars. This was only the beginning of the confusion. During the centuries that followed, the period when the greater number of texts of the so-called Book of the Dead originated, these ideas again assumed an entirely different form. We find all manner of later ideas concerning the fate of the dead and the realms of Osiris introduced and mixed up with them, while the earlier traditional conceptions had by this time become colourless, and their meaning misunderstood. Thus the ensuing confusion was so great that it now scarcely repays the labour of attempting to disentangle it. There is, moreover, one point which is very characteristic of the Book of the Dead ; for the most part it was regarded entirely as a collection of magic formula Should such and such an event happen to the deceased, he utters a spell, in which he identifies himself with such and such a god, in the belief that he will by this means become possessed of his attri - butes. He for instance who utters this spell : \" Jfy name was given me in the great house, and the mmembrance of my ?tarn>@ in the house of jlames, in that ?Light when the years were counted and the months reclconed, 1 am that one therein who sits in the east of heazen, and every god who cloth not follow me, that name I speak ! \" he will renwmber his name in the realms of the dmd.2 This fear lest in the hereafter the dead should no longer remember his own identity, was only one of many strange anxieties which this magic of the Book of the Dead was intended to relieve. He feared also lest he should have no mouth with which to speak to the gods: and lest he should be robbed of his heart? His head might be cut Notwith - standing embalmment, his body might decay! hostile beings 1 Pyr. 220 111. =&IiI. 698 ; 701 et seq.; 710 et seq. 2 Totenbuch, 28. 3 ib. 22. ib. 27. ib. 43. 6 ib. 45."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"roo A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION might desire to deprive him of hisplace and throne in the realms of the dead,l and he himself, like an unfortunate animal offered in sacrifice, might come to the butcher’s block of the gods.2 Food and drink might fail him, and he might be obliged to eat and drink his own filth.3 If he really has water, it may happen to the water to burn when he is about to drink it? Again, his supply of air may fail.5 Against these and all similar perils, the spells of the Book of the Dead are intended to help. Against serpents, for instance, who can bite the dead, it is a safeguard to address them thus : Oh serpent, come not ! Geb and Shu stand against thee. Thou hast eaten mice ; that is loathsome to Rr! ; thou hast gnawed the bones of a putrid cat.6 And against the eating of excrement this chapter guards : lam he who hath bread in Bcliopolis.

Even during life the knowledge of all these spells was of service: Whoever readeth these spells daily over himself, he is whole upon earth ; he escapes from every fire, and never doth anything evil meet him.9 All these anxieties and all this magic scarcely appear in the Pyramid texts, with the exception of a series of spells against snakes. While the Book of the Dead differs so completely in this respect from the Pyramid texts, it shows thereby a popular element which in other respects is very characteristic of the later work. Here primitive conceptions once more appear that were almost lost sight of in the Pyramid texts, as they did not accord with the heavenly existence hoped for by these great lords.

But of far greater importance than all of these is a dogma of later origin, that of the necessary justification of the dead. We have already seen that the dead Osiris was challenged by Set, and that the gods assembled to judge him in the hall of Heliopolis, and made him true of speech, that is, found him guiltless; we learn from the Book of the Dead: that similar judgment halls were established in Busiris, Buto, Abydos, Herakleopolis, in the Sokaris Temple at Memphis, and in other sacred places, and everywhere it was Thoth who vindicated him. This conception led to a desire that the dead, as representing the new Osiris, should also be vindicated by Thoth : as Osiris was found to be just, so the deceased desired to be found pure and sinless in the abodes of the dead - how should he otherwise find acceptance in the realms of that god, who himself owed his position as ruler to his sinlessness ? It is a question of ethics, which in this Osiris myth thus makes its appearance in the Egyptian belief. From henceforth it is not the powerful and distinguished who will triumph after death, but the upright and sinless. That this conception of Osiris as judge of the dead had already appeared in the Old Kingdom is shown by a tomb inscription that speaks of the great god, the lord of jzcstice,6 but it was only during the Middle Kingdom that it acquired definite form and general recognition. In the great chapter of the Book of the Dead we next find it pictured thus : In a large hall, whose roof is ringed round with flames of fire and symbols of truth, Osiris is enthroned in 3 chapel ; before him is the symbol of Anubis 1 Totenbuch, 77 - 89. ib. 92. 6 ib. 18 - 20. ib. 89.' ib. 18 - 64. 0 Mariette, Mastabas, D. 19."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"102 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION (p. eo), the four sons of I-Iorus (p. 94), and the devourer of the It - West, a fabulous animal who serves as protector to the god.

But if we at;tempt to arrive at details we are rebuffed by all manner of contradictions. For instance, according to the Paheri inscription Duat is situated in heaven, while, as we have seen, it was usually considered as being under the earth, and the judgment of the dead, in the inscription of Nachtmin, is placed in the under-world, while that of Paheri places the Hall of the Two Truths in which it was held, in heaven. Any one also who wishes clearly to understand the relation in which body, soul and ka stood to each other - many texts recognize the shadow of the man in addition to these - finds even greater confusion in the later texts than he encountered in the earlier ones, and may well wonder how an intelligent nation could allow itself for so many centuries to be encumbered with such a jumble. But we are now dealing with supernatural matters, and these no nation can define with absolute exactitude. At first they were vivid conceptions, to which names were given by a youthful fresh imagination, but successive generations included new and unforeseen ideas under this fixed nomenclature. We ourselves speak of “heaven” and mean little more by the word than an abode of the blessed ; we speak of the soul, of the spirit, of the heart with little comprehension of the original values of these expressions. We must, therefore, concede to the Egyptians of historical times the right to extend the use of their ancient expressions for what is supernatural and‘ intangible, regardles sof their strict meaning. Could we to-day question an Egyptian concerning these apparent contradictions, he would no doubt tell us that on the whole they scarcely contained a contradiction - or else that it is advisable not to investigate too closely into such sacred and inscrutable matters. They possess a certain attraction for mankind which lies in this very mystery and vagueness, and it is only a lifeless and learned theology that would conceive the idea of drawing up in Philistine"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"BELIEFS REGARDING THE DEAD 109 fashion a kind of geography of the Hereafter. That the Egyptian nation were not exempt from this is proved by the marvellous books, which pointed out to the deceased the road they should take, and explained to him all the various beings he would meet with in the under-world. Whoever entered the realms of the dead by the sacred place of Ro-Setau (p. 15), had, as we learn from a map of the Hereafter: two routes open to him, which would lead him to the land of the blessed, one by water, the other by land. Both are zigzag, and a traveller cannot change from one to the other, for between them lies a sea of fire. There are also by-ways, by which thou must not truuel, for they lead thee into the fire, or they are by - paths. Also before entering upon either of these routes there is a gate of fire to be passed. This idea that gates are placed in the road taken by the dead is also found in the Book of the Dead? The Field of Earu has fifteen or twenty- one gates, and evil gatekeepers stand by them with knives in their hands, and serpents also are stationed there. The literature has developed strangely into two voluminous books, one of which indicates the route of the dead on their journey, while the other conveys the sun through the under - world during the twelve hours of the night. Here we find the old idea that even the unfortunate dead in their darkness shall be allowed once to behold the light, but how greatly is this beautiful conception weakened ! According to the Book of him who is in the tmder-world- usually called Amduat - the under-world is divided into twelve parts, which correspond to the twelve hours, and are spoken of asJields or cuverns. They have a large population of gods, of spirits, and of the dead. In each there is usually a town, and each is ruled by agod. As the Pharaoh sailed through the pro- vinces of his kingdom, so did the sun god sail from one cavern to another ; he issues his commands to the gods who are the~eilt, and divides the land among them. Various gods formed the escoit of Re, and the goddess of that special hour also acted as his 1 The Zweiwegebuch, from a sarcophagus in the Berlin Museum, 2 Totenbuch, 144 - 146. published by Count Schack."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"110 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION guide. On this journey, however, he himself is actually a corpse, his $flesh as tlie text says; this melancboly circumstance is indicated by his now wearing the head of a ram. During the first hour the sun god journeys into the earth, into the gateway of the western horixon: 120 skencrz long is the journey until he !reaches the gods of the under - world. The second hour bears the name of Wernes, it is a field 408 skenae long and 120 skenae broad ; from this point another bark is used by the god, which at first is convoyed by four marvellous boats. The field of the third hour is also of similar extent, and here Osiris dwells, with his followers. Here also ships precede him, and he receives a friendly welcome. The fourth and fifth hour bring us into a strange locality, into the passages, the secret cavemas of the West, where Sokaris, the ancient Memphite god of the dead, has his abode. There dark - ness reigns, and Re does not see who is therein, yet they hear his voice when he gives his commands. It is a sandy desert without water, the abode of serpents. The bark of Re must itself change into a serpent, and thus it is drawn down through a passage, the road by which the body of Sokaris entered, through the mound of sand in which Sokaris is buried, and out of which he still thrusts his head in order to behold the sun. The sixth hour once more affords water for the bark of the sun ; and it arrives in this field near the body of Osiris. The seventh brings him danger, for the great storm dragon Apophis, whose place is in heaven, has established himself here, and lies on a ridge of land which is 450 cubits long, and which he fills with his coils. But his voice guides the gods to him, and they wound him: this great god does not pass over him, but diverts his way from him. Yet this secret way on which the god sails in his splendid bark has yet another difficulty : there is not sufficient water for it, for the dragon has drunk it up and the magic of Isis and of the Elders is required to bring the ship on its way. These caverns still belong, moreover, to Osiris, whose 3es7z we here see enthroned as king, while his enemies lie beheaded or bound before him. It is yet more noteworthy that in this hour and the following the sun god arrives at mounds of sand, under which various gods are buried.

In the ninth hour, the rowers of the sun god land and Test in this city; in the eleventh, where also the torture of the enemies of Osiris is to be witnessed, the rope by which the ship is dragged is changed into a serpent. In the twelfth, the great transformation occurs, which has been prepared during the eleventh hour. In the tenth hour a beetle had alighted close to Re ; nowiin the cavern End of the dawn, the sun bark is dragged through a serpent 1,300 cubits long, and when at last he emerges out of the jaws of the serpent, the sun god himself has become this beetle. He has now become Khepre, god of the morning sun (see p. lo), his former body remains in the under - world, and the god Shu takes the beetle in charge ; the new god comes out from the under - world, and seats himself in the morning bark, and ascends into the bosom of the goddess of heuven. The sun is new-born and begins his new career. These are roughly the contents of the book so far as they can be reproduced. The innumerable quaint details with which the confused imagination of its compilers has loaded it cannot be reproduced, and yet they give the book its special character. Thus, for instance, in pictures of the third hour, of the kingdom of Osiris, in the ninety-seven figures in the illustra - tion me see nothing, actually nothing, of all we find elsewhere associated with the god of the Dead. Neither his table of food, nor the fields tilled by the blessed dead, neither the judgment of the dead, nor Isis and Nephthys. Instead we find on one bank three gods standing with sceptres, a hawk, four women who, according to the explanatory text, weep or lament, four mum - mies having horns and wings on their heads, and four men who, it appears, represent the noble dead; then follows the rich in magic, a papyrus stem on which a piece of meat is lying. Behind is a man who brings the eye and contents the gods, Anubis with his sceptre before him, and a mummy form provided with hands. The ram with the sword is the slayer of his foes; the male and female bringers appear also to be bringing eyeballs, Finally, behind Set and Anubis are two monkeys ; one of which is seated in a hiding-place, the other, as stated in the inscription, is seated"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"BELIEFS REGARDING THE DEAD 113 on his sand. On the other bank we find among others two gods in long garments, one of whom signifies Orion, a god in a short skirt, the Western, the goddess who is upon her flame, the god - dess of birth, the Jive, five bird - headed beings with knives, and others. Between these are two groups of four gods enthroned wearing the crowns of Lower and Upper Egypt, and these eight gods all represent Osiris, to whom this locality belongs, corre - sponding to eight different titles of the god. These are The mightiest of the gods, Jcing of Lower Egypt, We who is seated upon his thyone, Bull of the West, Conqueror of Eternity, Representative of the Xtars, Pirst of Zhe Westerners, Lord of the West. Behind all these again stands a man praying, and the god Khnum. When we turn to the ships which are conducting the sun bark we find in them the serpents Sparkling of face, Pi~e in cowntenance, Fire in eye, and also hawks and female hawks, with Xords of sceptres and HG who is in the country, with the pilots, FZaming Pace, Xn<fe in the ~ountenanee, and Rowel. of rowers. What in the world is the meaning of all this? In vain we search in the text for an explanation; here we are told that those in the upper row create the ocean, make the advances of the Nile, while those below cut up souls, and ensnare shadows, and harry the enemy with fire and sword. We are also informed that these beings worship Re ; he speaks kindly to them, and gives them drink, and when he has passed away from them they lament. But what help does this give us towards understanding the individual figures ? And yet the man who compiled this grand book on the basis of one similar and more ancient, undoubtedly associated ideas with the whole of this and took delight in all the allusions concealed in these pictures. We need not, however, greatly lament our ignorance, for what is incomprehensible to us here does not represent popular ideas, nor does it contain deep speculation. It is the phantasy of a strange people, who have given it the form in which we now see it, and who were nothing more than compilers of magic spells. The titles, with which the whole book is per - vaded, point to this. Whoever knows these pictures and names, to him it is of greatest use. upon earth and of use in the great wnder-world.

Every word, every picture of the book is thus a protection for the fortunate possessor, and without doubt it was dearly paid for as such, to the man who first supplied it. A supplementary book has also survived to our times, called by us the Book of the Gates, according to which lofty fortresses stand between each of the hours, guarded by watchers and by fire - breathing serpents. It retains more of the usual conceptions, and its magic purpose is not so apparent as in the Amduat; it follows it, however, only too closely in its construction and arrangement. In the whole of this literature there is only one point that is of interest for us. It is that there was a time when it was valued and much in request. During the thirteenth and four I teenth centuries, when the kings of the nineteenth and twentieth dynasties caused their tombs to be constructed at Thebes, these texts were painted on the walls and sarcophagi. As we wander to-day through the solemn passages of these colossal tombs, the pictured forms of the Amduat gaze down on us from all sides, as though the ancient Egyptians had no higher ideas concerning life after death than these absurdities. The next century also supplied the dead of other ranks with portions of this book on papyrus rolls to serve as a sure protection. The book, however, never became generally popular, and remained, as it deserved, a secret of the magic art."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"CHAPTER V FUNERARY CUSTOMS OF THE EARLY PERIOD AND OF THE NEW KINGDOM S I N C E the excavations of the last ten years have acquainted us with the earliest cemeteries of Egypt, we have known that even in that country, where such elaborate provision was made for its dead, burial was at first a simple matter. A narrow trench in which the body was laid with the knees drawn up to the body on the left side. There the body decayed, and after a few years any one molesting such a grave would merely find a skeleton with the bones detached. A remembrance, moreover, of this oldest form of burial, in which the body decayed and fell to pieces, influenced the later Egyptian, without his being aware of it ; his prayers for the dead still included the wish that the limbs of the deceased should once more unite themselves, and that his head might a,gain be attached to his body. In the later period, when the Egyptian knew how to preserve the body from decay, by means of mummifying, he still made use of these expressions, employing them as allusions to the body of Osiris rent in pieces by his foes, and it is very possible that the legend of the dismemberment of the body of Osiris may earlier have grown out of this ancient ritual, which in its original form referred to limbs fallen apart from each other. At this time it was customary to place something in the hand of the deceased, which was considered likely to be of use to him. Thus in one hand we find a flat palette, used during his lifetime for rubbing the green paint with which he adorned his body, and in the other hand a leather bottle. Near the body a large number of objects are laid, jars and bowls with food and drink, that the deceased may not go hungry ; harpoons 115"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"116 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION and flint knives, that he may hunt for food, and defend himself against his foes ; a chess board, with which he may wile away the time, hair ornaments and palettes, with which he may perform his toilette as elaborately as in life. In addition to these there were others which could only have been of supernatural service to him. The small clay boat should enable him to cross the lakes which, as we have already seen (pp. 91, 94)) surround the heavenly regions of the blessed. The clay ox is for him to slay ; the clay hippopotamus will afford him good sport; the clay maid - servant in the great tub will there knead with her feet and make barley into dough for him, to provide him with his favourite beverage of beer. And the other crouching figure of a woman is obviously adapted to provide her lord with the joys of love, and for this reason is she so grandly painted with various colours, to appear as though she were decked with garlands and decorations, and therefore are her thighs so enormously de - veloped, a detail which at the present day is regarded by the African as the highest feminine beauty. Other graves of this earliest time already possess elaborations which point to an attempt at improving the disposal of the dead. The bodies were still laid in the crouching position, but they were wrapped in matting or hides, or were buried in two great jars. They would then dry up in the arid soil, and form a kind of natural mummy. Or the grave was dug somewhat deeper, lined with brick, and covered over with a flat stone to protect the contents from being crushed. It was yet more secure when a, short shaft was cut in the rock, which opened below on a small chamber, whose opening was walled up, and a heap of stones piled over it, safeguarding the corpse both from robbers and jackals. Another more elaborate form we find first employed for the graves of the kings. The great tomb at Negada, in Upper Egypt, which was probably occupied by Menes, the first king of whom anything was known by the later Egyptians, is a rect - angular brick building, with strong walls sloping rapidly at the top, This was covered with a slight roofing of palm stalks. In the centre was the chamber containing the body of the king, surrounded by four other chambers containing the great mass of"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"FUNERARY CUSTOMS OF THE EARLY PERIOD 117 food, and of jars of beer and wine, the ivory couches, the magni - ficent stone vases, and all the other household goods which would be required by the king in the hereafter. Similar graves were constructed at Abydos by liis successors, and in one of these we first meet with a circumstance which was destined later to become of importance : the king was not buried alone, but in small chambers near him rest his court; as is shown by the small gravestones in these chambers, the wives of the ruler, his body-guard, and even his court dwarfs and his dogs, are buried around him. But this form of grave construction did not long remain the exclusive property of the king ; the nobles copied it closely, and then the kings for their part adopted a new kind of tomb, the pyramid, which from the end of the third dynasty, about 2800 B .c., became the exclusive form of the royal tombs. The Pyramids, which have so often been called the marvels of ancient Egyptian history, may indeed be so considered. They bear witness to the immeasurable power and dignity to which this ancient kingdom attained. Even the first known pyramid, the step pyramid of Sakkara, built by King Zozer, is a colossal building, whose walls, constructed of blocks of limestone, tower up for no less than 6Om. in height. But what is this in comparison with the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, the building erected by his fifth successor, Kheops? In order clearly to realize its dimensions, we must imagine the great square of Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where the area is exactly that of the Great Pyramid, and covering this space we must imagine a mass of stone building the height of the cathedral at Strassburg. And this colossal building, the design for which was repeatedly enlarged during the long reign of the king, was designed solely to protect the body of the Pharaoh from injury ; it corresponded to the heap of stones piled over the burial chamber. That the king ventured to devote the whole resources of the kingdom to this one object shows that the preservation of the body was at this period considered a sacred duty; an idea obviously in - fluenced by that hope of a possible resurrection of the body which we have previously mentioned (p. 95). But as every extravagance speedily comes to an end, so did"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"118 ,4 HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION the rage for pyramid building. The two immediate successors of Kheops built on the same gigantic scale as their predecessor, but all later monarchs of the Old Kingdom (and among them were some who reigned long) contented themselves with pyra - mids of relatively small size. And we must add that these smaller pyramids accomplished their objects quite as well, or quite as badly, as their colossal rivals, for neither the one nor the other proved able to afford lasting protection to the body. Notwithstanding the masses of granite with which their narrow FIO. (io. PYRAMIDS AND MORTUARY TEMPLES AT ABUSIR.

As the interior of the pyramid could not be entered after the burial, it was necessary that the place set apart for the worship of the dead monarch should be near it on the outside ; a temple where offerings could be brought, and also storehouses and various chambers for preparing the food ; there must also be dwelling-houses and business offices for the priests and officials of the pyramid.

Around the pyramid of the king, according to ancient custom, were buried those who had surrounded him in life, the princes and princesses, and all the great nobles of his court. These graves were arranged round the pyramid like a town, with regular streets, varying greatly in size, in material, and in decoration, but in essentials all of one type, that which the fellaheen of the present day prosaically, but most aptly call the mastaba, i. e. the bench.

A vertical shaft was sunk deep into the rock, and a small lateral chamber chiselled out at the end, in which the body was placed. Above this shaft a rectangular mass of stone blocks was raised, faced with blocks of hewn stone, so that the mastaba resembled in appearance a stone building with sloping walls. The shaft was carried right up to the roof, for on the day of the burial the body had to be let down it ; this having been accomplished, the entrance to the burial chamber was walled up, and the shaft filled to the top with blocks of stone and rubbish."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"120 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION As the realms of the dead were supposed to be in the west, or at least to be accessible from the west (p. 87), so everything FIR. 62.

These places for offerings at the mastabas were marked by the so - called false door, the con - ventional imitation of a door. It represents the entrance to the interior of the tomb, the door through which the dead could emerge to secure the offerings brought by the survivors. In the larger tombs these niches were deepened and form a chamber, with the false door on the far wall. At first these chambers were of small dimensions. The chamber of Meten, now in the Berlin Museum, and which belongs to the third dynasty, is actually only a deep narrow niche, widened out crossways at the end in front of the back wall. It just gave room for the two priests who had to pray and sacrifice at the grave, and also allowed persons offering to deposit their offerings on the right and left sides. The walls of this small chamber are furnished with all manner of suitable pictures. His people are bringing to the deceased food and household furniture, and his dogs (he was a chief huntsman), and supply him with game for his offering, while the mortuary priests perform their ceremonies on his behalf. At the entrance two long inscriptions tell how greatly Meten had succeeded in life, and what a fine house and large garden he had been able to lay out. During the reign of Kheops, several years later, we find that more space and more complicated decoration were considered necessary, and by the fifth and sixth dynasties many of the great nobles constructed actual mansions for their mastabas. Thus the tomb of Mereruka, vizier of king Pepi, contains no fewer than thirty-one chambers, twenty - one of which are devoted to the deceased, six to his wife, and four to his son. Here there are also what are not found in all such tombs, representations of agriculture, of cattle-tending, hunting and snaring birds, crafts - men and sailors, musicians and dancing women, butchers and wine treaders, and whatever would appear interesting and attractive to an Egyptian of the upper classes. No doubt these representations had special reference to the tomb. The cattle, game, fowls, the corn and wine were placed there to be utilized"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"122 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION as oEerings at the grave, the artisans work for his benefit, the ships bring gifts to him, and with music and dancing the deceased can be amused as in life. But close examination shows that this purpose becomes increasingly only a matter of secondary importance. If the boatmen were really only intended to bring gifts, it would not have been necessary to represent how they would fall to fighting and cudgelling each other, and equally unnecessary to perpetuate on the walls of the tombs what the butchers called out to each other, what the sower sang, or what the swaying movements of the dancing girl were called. In all this we recognize an attempt to render the decorations of the grave more varied and artistic, even though the pretext for them had to be forcibly adduced. These changes, however, could scarcely have occurred had there not also been some change of ideas. It is probable that by this time the idea had obtained of celebrating the feast days of the dead as a joyous occasion. For this, the large chambers, with their cheerful and artistic decorations, would be far more suitable than the narrow rooms with their monotonous paintings. But even in the Old Kingdom, everything connected with the offerings and feasts of the dead became more luxnrious during the course of centuries. Of what the earliest offering to the dead customarily consisted can now be inferred by the signs employed in writing the word “offering.” It consisted of a mat, on which was placed a dish containing bread. When, therefore, we find the deceased called upon to come out to the voice, and to take possession of his offering, the thousand loaves, thousand jugs of bee~, thousand oxen, thousand geese, und ull good, pure thiags, it is permissible to doubt whether any one ever con - tributed greatly towards the realization of these words. It was an obsolete form, whose observance cost nothing. Ordinarily the survivors would deposit some loaves on the table of offerings in front of the false door, and pour water over them. At great festivals they would perhaps bring a haunch of beef in addition, and they would then be considered as having completely fulfilled their duty.

The great tombs of the Old Kingdom, which I have just described, were provided for on an entirely different scale. This is shown by the number of ordinary, superior, and chief priests which were attached to them. When so large a staff (in the tomb of Mereruka there were forty - seven mortuary priests) was employed to take charge of the food brought for offerings, the amount of offerings must have been proportionately large. Here also apparently it was the example of the kings, who employed a large number of important people at their pyramids, that was imitated. The old wholesome idea that sons and grandsons should tend the grave was no longer held; these important personages had too many other duties to allow them to under - take the regular charge of a tomb, So there remained no other alternative but to set filial piety on one side, and to provide for the deceased by a business arrangement. A bargain was made with some relatives or employds, or even with those who had no connection with the family, by which some specified land or"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"124 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION property was made over to them, In return they undertook to provide the offerings to the deceased, to perform the prescribed ceremonies, and to guard the tomb carefully. These mortuary priests thus formed a colony at the great tombs, with settled orders, of varying ranks, and with regulations of their own. It can easily be imagined that this custom introduced by the great nobles would soon spread among people of more moderate nieans. A man who himself was only a mortuary priest has left behind a tablet on which he recounts the various persons whom he has provided for his daughter's grave. If we may infer his pecuniary circumstances from the roughness of this inscription, it would not be possible for him to have made such ample provision. Possibly the king came to his aid in this matter, as he often did in the Old Kingdom. This interposition of the king was of so remarkable a character t'hat we cannot well pass it over. In the upper classes of Egyptian society, which principally subsisted on the favour of the Pharaoh, and at Court ate what was excellent, that he gave: it naturally came to pass that on application to the king deserving persons would be assisted in founding and supporting their graves. We frequently hear of such cases; in one instance the king entirely provides for the construction of the tomb, for another (his physician) he gives at least the false for a third he orders a stone sarcophagus to be pr~vided,~ and yet another hopes that in his grave the mortuary ofering will be supplied from the granaries, from the treasuries, from the worJcshops of the royal jewellery . . . and from everyplace of the Court from which an ofering to the dead shall be provided: What was done in isolated cases during the Old Kingdom, must have been almost the rule at the primitive time when the developed system of burial was confined to a very small circle of the highest personages, and it was then hoped, in the case of every deceased person, that the king would supply his tomb with food. As it was expected of Anubis, the ancient god of the dead, that he would supply the dead with provisions, so it was expected of the king: the ofering that the icing gives! the Berlin, 14108. 2 Westcar, 7,21. 3 Mariette, Mustabas, I>. 12.

That is the prayer uttered more frequently than any other at the tombs. And this petition must have come down from a very early time, for its opening words arc almost meaningless, and it became the recognized prayer for the dead of the Egyptians. The ofering that the king gives is, for the Egyptian, the prayer of all prayers. For thousands of years it persisted, meaningless and distorted, but ever with its ancient wording, and it was even employed for the gods in the temples. As long as the Egyptian belief existed at all, so long was it inscribed on all tombs, and on all objects deposited in them. We, therefore, meet with its hieroglyph signs ’$ A from the earliest times until we are weary of them, and would gladly ignore them. However, if we entertain kindly feelings towards the ancient Egyptians, we shall not ignore this petition ; but, on the contrary, read it aloud with emphasis, for this is what the occupants of the tombs request from posterity. They ask us for that breath of the mouth which is of use to the dead and also not diflcult for him who utters it, and charge us to do so by all that is sacred to an Egyptian: even as we desire that our local gods should love and reward us, and that we should bequeath our oflcial positions to our childyen, or even as we love life, and hate death.

A day would inevitably come when his advisers would point out to him that it was already diffi- cultto provide sufficient establishment for the tomb of the Pharaoh himself, and that it was impossible to arrange adequately for all the relations of the king. There would therefore be no alternative but to confiscate the endowment of some half - forgotten ancestor to supply the necessities of the present time. When King Sahure expressed a wish to reward his old palace official Persen with a permanent gift, it might well be most just to appropriate the foundation of the ancient Queen Neferhotpes, and to bestow on this meritorious man the two cakes and the oil which she had secured for her grave as a daily offering from the temple of Ptah? What could not be avoided even in the prosperous circumstances of the royal family would necessarily be doubly unavoidable in private families. Even the most wealthy, after a few generations, must have been forced to employ the revenues of the older graves for the purposes of graves of their own time. The mortuary priests also would only trouble themselves about the more recent graves, for which they received payment ; the earlier ones were closed and neglected, What would then happen we can learn from an instance borrowed from the modern Egyptians. In the fifteenth century of our era the Mameluke Sultans at Cairo built burial places for themselves which rivalled in size the tombs of the ancient Egyptians. They were mosques, and contained schools and accommodation for students. Their maintenance and the salaries of the large staff employed there were provided for by rich endowments. These endowments were confiscated at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and already these tomb - mosques have become melancholy ruins, from which everything worth taking has been torn down and stolen. Some have been inhabited by gangs of beggars, the successors of the mosque officials who once lived there, others 1 Berlin, 11406=Mariette, Mastccbas, I>. 45."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"FUNERARY CUSTOMS OF THE EARLY PERIOD 127 have been profitably made use of by the State as magazines. We have no ground for assuming that things were otherwise in ancient Egypt, when disused tombs would also quickly fall into ruins. A great number of objects found in later tombs show how the earlier ones were pillaged ; the name of the dead man in whose grave they were first placed is erased, and that of a new possessor substituted; coffins, statues, and all the other grave furniture bear traces of this double usage. The tombs themselves show this even more clearly: almost all of them were broken into and plundered in ancient times. We often find that the grave inscriptions have been chiselled out and re- placed by that of a new burial, and even more frequently we find a still rougher usage of the old graves. They were pulled down, and as much of them as could be carried away utilized as building material. There was then nothing to prevent the desert sand drifting into those ruined tombs, rising higher and higher until it formed a new level ou which a later generation once more erected graves. Thus in Sakkara, near the pyramid of King Teti, over the ruined graves of his time there are those of the New Kingdom, and above these again graves were once more built during the Hellenistic period, and all alike are shat - tered and pillaged. It is a melancholy sight, which recalls the pessimistic verses in which an ancient Egyptian poet lamented the uselessness of constructing graves : he who built there in Ted granite, who constructed a hall (?> in a pyramid ; who supplied there what was beauti& in this fine work . . . his altar shall be as enapty as those of the weary, who die on the canal embankment without leaving any surviv0rs.l Now and then a pious successor would undertake to restore some such ruined grave ; thus Entef, prince of Hermonthis, boasts, in the Middle Kingdom : I found the chamber of oferings of the prince Nelchti-olcer fallen down, its walls were old, all its statues were brolcen, there was no one who heeded it.

In fact, what could be the object of restoring ruined graves, when the robbers, as so often happened, had penetrated to the sarcophagus itself, and had torn the body out and destroyed it? This was generally their object, for it was here that they found the objects that could be most easily disposed of. The altar, stone casing, stands, etc., which stood in the chamber above, were of little value compared to the booty which they expected to find in the coffin, and never would the peace of the corpse have been disturbed had not these offerings been placed with it. Notwithstanding this, the Egyptian still continued to place his offerings in that position, and this he must have done not merely to show his reverence for ancient tradition, he must have considered that such offerings were of great importance to the well-being of the deceased ; prayers and offerings were not sufficient. These practices later became more widely developed, but even in the early times they were sufficiently complicated, and they are too characteristic to be passed over without comment. In the treatment of the body attention was concentrated on the attempt to preserve it, and to retain its natural appearance. If this could be done, the soul would find its accustomed abode there, and might once more awake; with this hope the body was treated with natron and asphalt, and the limbs wrapped in linen ; over the face was placed a mask of linen and stucco, intended to give it a natural appearance. The '( mummy )' was then laid in a sleeping attitude on the left side, the head supported on a head - rest, and enclosed in the coffin, a rectangular chest of stone or wood, the sides of which were strong enough to protect the mummy from injury. How it was the dead were not confined to their coffins, how they could go in and out unhindered, to see the sun, was beyond human comprehension, and belongs to the domain of supernatural phenomena. The Egyptians themselves, indeed, felt that there was a contradic - tion here, for on many coffins we find various expedients adopted which are intended to solve the difficulty.

The form of the cofin is generally very simple. It is a pol - ished chest with a flat cover, or it had in addition (and this must have been the appearance of the coffin of Osiris) four corner posts and an arched cover. In the Middle King - dom, when the coffin was generally brightly painted, it was customary to inscribe it on the inside with various chapters from the ancient funerary texts ; the most important of these were always arranged in rows on the outside, and commended FIG. 64.

These four spirits arose from the water in a lotns flower, and the water god Sobk, by command of Re, had to catch them with a net - she, however, who produced them was Isis? Without doubt they succoured Osiris in his misfortunes, and saved him from hunger and thirst, and thus it is their part to do the same for the dead. This gave rise to a peculiar conception, which had already begun in the Old Kingdom, although it was later that it was universally accepted. By them the entrails were prevented from causing the corpse any unpleasant sensa - tions ; they were taken out of the body and placed in special boxes or jars, each of which were placed under the charge of these spirits (p. 146). The deceased was also protected against hunger and thirst, by the same methods employed in primitive times; actual bread, meat, and drink were laid in Steindorff, Grabfiinde ails den Konigl.

We need only mention here the ivory wands on which various strange figures are engraved, the many amulets which yzbarantee pro - tection. One of these figures is called the Jtghter, and appears to be intended to protect the dead from snakes and scorpions. How greatly these dangers were feared for the dead is shown by the endless magic formuke against snakes in the pyramid text, and there is another detail which bears witness to it. So far was this fear carried, that it even extended to the ordinary hiero- glyph signs written in the grave. In many graves the two letters f and z and 7 zre written with the head separate from the body. The sign of the lion also B (rw) is occasionally rendered harmless in the same manner. In other graves the birds were forced to forego their legs in order to carry out this idea, a precaution which does not commend itself to our modern notions, The quantity and nature of the outfit and property given to the dead naturally depended on the wealth and affection of the survivors ; weapons, staves, seats and boxes, articles of toilet and of jewellery, clothes, and scented oil, these are all found in one or other of the graves. And with the actual objects deposited in the mortuary chamber there were others which were only pictorially represented. In the earliest graves short lists are found which recount the various kinds of oil or of linen which the dead must have, while from the end of the Old King - dom all that the deceased may require, such as bracelets, neck- laces, sandals, staves, weapons, materials for handicrafts, and many other objects, are painted or inscribed on the walls of the tombs. But the most remarkable of these offerings is undoubtedly the statue of the deceased, Its meaning can be gathered from"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"132 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION the position it customarily occupies in the mastaba ; it stands in the so - called serdab, a small walled-in chamber near the chamber of offerings, which generally communicates with it only by a narrow slit. Thus the dead abides close to his worshippers, if only in ef%gy, he hears the priests recite, and the fragrance of the incense and the scent of the food can reach him; perhaps it was thought that his soul might quit his body in the mortuary chamber, and inhabit this statue as a second body. In graves which are not of mastaba form, and which do not possess a serdab, a statue is still introduced in some way; in the rock - cut tombs they are often placed in the farthest chamber, while in the smaller graves of the Middle Kingdom at least one figure of the dead is laid on the cofjCin. Of these two forms of graves just mentioned, the second of them, the rock-cut tomb, is scarcely later than the mastaba itself; as early as the fourth dynasty the great nobles occasionally cut their tombs in the cliffs at Gizeh, instead of building them. But on the plateau of Memphis, where most of the large tombs of the Old Kingdom are placed, it was so far more convenient to build a mastaba, that at all periods a rock-cut tomb was ex - ceptional. Its especial locality is in the south, where high, steep cliffs enclose the Nile valley ; here it was simplest to cut a tomb horizontally in the cliff. These rock tombs were decorated, like the mastabas, with inscriptions and pictures, and in them also there was a false door, and a shaft which terminated at its lower end in the mortuary chamber; but this arrangement developed in early times in accordance with another point of view. The rock tomb was looked upon as the house of the dead, and, like the abode of the living, it had in front a spacious reception court, behind was the large chamber, and behind this again was the actual dwelling of the dead man, the niche occupied by his statue. The small brick pyramid, which from the time of the Middle Kingdom was the usual form of grave in provincial towns, was of course an imitation of the great royal pyramids; but they were built by people of small means, for notwithstanding their important appearance this form of grave was the simplest and most convenient. A cavity in the rock served as a sarcophagus ;"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"FUNERARY CUSTOMS OF THE EARLY PERIOD 133 this was covered over with a vaulting, and above it, on a slight substructure, there was built a small pyramid of whitewashed bricks. On the east side a gravestone indicated the place for offerings; on it the deceased is shown sitting at meat, with his wife, and frequently this is followed by lorig rows of children and relatives who pay homage to the deceased. In the sand before the grave lies the table of offerings on which the food was laid and the water poured. In addition to all the arrangements which we have described, greater security and happiness were ensured for the dead man by means of the many ceremonies performed at the preparation of the mummy at the funeral, and at the provisioning of the deceased. They are similar in character to those we have already (p. 45 et seq.) met with in connection with the worship of the gods. Here also every separate action must be accompanied by its proper formula which refers to its prototype in the acts of the gods. Endless and wearisome are these texts, and by no means beautified by the number of puns introduced into them. The ritual of embalming as a whole has come down to us only in a very late form ; we shall not, however, be very much mis - taken if we assume that the embalmer and his assistant, the learned Kherheb (p. 54), here figured as the gods who anointed the body of Osiris and wrapped him in linen bandages. We know far more about the ritual for the ceremonies at the grave, which on the day of the funeral were first performed on the mummy itself, and afterwards on feast days on the statue of the deceased. The principal person at these ceremonies was a priest called the Sem, but the Kherheb and several other personages also took part. When the dead man had been sprinkled with water, and incense had been offered before him, three persons proceeded to the grave, and wakened the Sem, who had swathed himself in wrappings before he laid down. When he had slowly raised himself in the appointed manner, the four together undertook the part of those sons of Horus who had tarken care of Osiris (p. 129). At a further stage of the performance, where the Sem wore a peculiar decora- tion over the breast, and carried a staff, he represented"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"134 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION Horus, son of Osiris. Some called out: Oh Isis, Horus is come, that he muy embrace his father, and the Kherheb cried : hasten that thou mayest see thy father. The Sem then ex - changed his attire for a panther skin, and while the animal to be sacrificed was being cut up near him, he announced to the deceased ; I have rescued this my eye out of his mouth. I have cut of his thigh-thus the Sem presented the thigh of the animal to the deceased, as Horus once presented his own eye, which Set had torn out (p. 34), to his father. But before the deceased could devote himself to enjoying this food, the most important of all the ceremonies must be performed on his behalf. The opening of the mouth and of the eyes. Twice with small oblique axes, and once with a chisel was the face of the deceased touched, and when that and all else had been done, and when the Sem with his little finger had opened mouth and eyes, the dead man was once more enabled to receive food. The Sem raised his staff and assigned to him his food. Finally he anointed the dead man, and burnt incense before him, gave him a headcloth, clothed him in bandages, and gave him a staff and flail, similar to those carried by Osiris. In addition to this ceremonial there was also the actual sacrificial ritual, those endless spells, in which the offerings were termed the eye of Horus in accordance with the performance just quoted : 1 bring thee the eye of Horus, which I have talcen away from Xet, or I bring thee the eye of Eorus, after thou hast counted it, and so forth. If any statement was made concerning the eye, the names of one of the gifts offered was joined to it, for the added word must form a pun. In addition to the tomb, there was another place, in the case of an important personage, where care was bestowed on the pro - visions of the deceased. During his life-time he had on feast days been present when the offerings from the altar of the god were distributed (p. 47), and in death also he wished to share in this meal. Thus in the Middle Kingdom a statue of the deceased was placed in the temple, and request was made for him for all that was furnished for the altar of the god. This matter was not entrusted solely to the prayer, but a perpetual supply of a fixed number of loaves for the feast was prudently"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"FUNERARY CUSTOMS OF THE EARLY PERIOD 135 purchased from the priesthood. These were laid in front of the statue, and no doubt became the property of the mortuary priests. This arrangement often supplied the kings with an opportunity of recognizing faithful service, as on many a statue bearing a priest’s name, we read that it was placed there as a reward on the part of the king. There was also a third place where the Egyptian might hope to secure his hopes for the future life, in the sacred city of Abydos. Since the kings of the first dynasty had resided at Abydos, and were buried there, the idea had gained ground that Osiris, first of the dwellers in the West, who was worshipped there, was a peculiarly benevolent and holy god. The most important of his relics, his head, was there, kept preserved in a box, and at his grave the great festival of the god was celebrated. Lucky indeed were the dead who were buried here, not far from the stairs which led down to the grave of the deity. They were companions of the king of the dead, they were the great ones of Abydos, and his court. They received a place in the ship of the god, they took a share of his food, and to them “ zueleonw ” was spoken by tlae great ones of Abydos. It must therefore have been the supreme wish of every pious Egyptian to be buried in Abydos, and in fact from the end of the Old Kingdom, many people of all classes preferred a grave in this sacred place to one at the Court or at home. He who found it impossible to build a tomb at Abydos,gained at least something by visiting the god at Abydos, and erecting a, stone on the staircase of the great god; in this way he secured a place for himself in the midst of these privileged dead. The Berlin Museum shows us how universal was this idea. The greater number of small gravestones and memorial slabs of the Middle Kingdom are from Abydos. Many of their owners, as they themselves inform us, went to the holy place for pro - fessional reasons, others sought it solely as pilgrims, and others again undertook the pilgrimage for the first time after their death. In the tomb of the priest Khnemhotp, at Beni Hasan, there is a great pictured scene which, as the inscription accom- panying it informs us, represents a voyage made by him in order to learn to how the things of Abydos. His mummy lies on a"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"136 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION vessel under a canopy, and the Sem priest and Kherheb remain at his side throughout the voyage. In the sacred town he was placed before the god of the dead as a new vassal, and also took part in his festival services. Then, accompanied by wives and children, he returned home once more to occupy his magnificent tomb at Beni Hasan. Most of these fimerary customs, which we have here described, were even more widely practised in the New Kingdom, and where occasionally some practice disappears or falls into abey - ance during this period, it is only to make way for some newer and richer conception, which is intended to be equally beneficial for the dead. With regard to the arrangement of the tombs, the two forms are retained which were popular during the Middle Kingdom. Simple folk contented themselves with the small brick pyramid, the more important ones were laid in rock chambers. The kings also constructed these rock tombs for themselves, but the form given to them was new. A long narrow passage, with which ante- chambers sometimes communicated, led to a chamber, the gold house, in the centre of which stood the stone sarcophagus, with the body of the monarch. All the walls were covered with religious texts and scenes, and as these are principally taken from the descriptions of the realms of the dead (p. 109 et seq.), it has been surmised, not without probability, that it was the underworld itself which was in the minds of the constructors of these tombs : a long passage, which became more and more intensely dark, until the gold house was reached where dwelt Osiris, the king. In this must have consisted the only connection between these tombs and the cult of the dead. They are situated in the desolate western valley of Biban el Moluk. Neither their space nor their isolated position are adapted for such ceremonies. Apparently the ceremonies and offerings of the dead kings were carried on in Der el Bahri, Gurneh, and in all those temples on the western bank of Thebes, in which the kings were worshipped in company with the Theban deities."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"FUNERARY CUSTOMS OF THE NEW KINGDOM 137 There is also a marked change in the graves of the common people. Up to this time the scenes in the tombs and on the gravestones were confined to the endless subject of supplies for the dead, and the gifts brought by the survivors or the attend - ants, but these now drop into the background. In their place we find scenes of a religious character: pictures and in - scriptions from the Book of the Dead and similar texts adorn the walls, while on the gravestones we find representations of the dead man adoring Osiris or the sun god. Also those pictures of life on earth, which only appear rarely in the mastabas, now multiply so fast in many of the graves, that they almost form a record of a noteworthy career. How the occupant of the tomb conducted his business, how he was distinguished and rewarded by the king, is all clearly set forth, and even the scenes of the funeral and funerary worship are of a personal character which they did not possess earlier. As in the religious poetry of this period individual character is permitted to appear, so also it appears in these tombs : in them the dead is no longer the illuminated one, whom men honour and feed separately from themselves ; he is the beloved father and hus - band, the friend and man who is taken away from his relatives, and for whom they weep and lament. It is true that the Sem continues to open his mouth, and the Kherheb utters his formulze before him in prayer, as these are necessary for his welfare. But to these formal inscriptions there is added the cry of the wife as she embraces the mummy, before it is deposited €or ever in the tomb : I am verily thy sister, thou great one, do not forsake me. . . Why is it that thou art far from me, thou who didst love to jest with me ; thou art silent and dost not speak. Behind her, and behind the priests, lament the relatives of the dead, and the poor women and children whom he has befriended : Woe, woe , . . alas this loss ! The good shepherd has gone to the lund of eternity; he who had so much society is now in the countyy which loves solitude ! he who so willingly opened his feet to going, is now enclosed, bound and confined.

How it was conducted on the day of the funeral (and also doubtless on feast days when offerings were made to the dead) is frequently shown on the tombs of the New Kingdom. There sit the relatives and friends, in holiday garb, and decked with flowers ; they eat and drink, watch the dancing women, and listen to the song of the harper z2 How peaceful rests this righteous prince, the excellent destiny is entered upon.

But all those to whom they give birth, soon go down to the place appointed for them. And now the singer addresses the deceased himself, as though he were seated among the feasters, and exhorts him to enjoy this short life with his wife : Celebrate the good day, provide ointment for thyself and jne oil for thy nostril and wreaths and lotus jlowers for the body of thy beloved sister, who sits at thy side. Let song and music come before thee. Cast all sadness behind thee, think on joy until that day comes, when man arrives in the land where the people keep silence. Meanwhile the dancing women leap yet more wildly and shamelessly, and the servants offer the wine jars with yet more eagerness : drink until thou art drunken ; one lady calls for more wine, because all within her is straw ; another, alas ! has progressed much further in drunkenness ; dolefully she grovels on the ground, her robe slips from her shoulder, her lotus flower hangs drooping over her arm, and the maidservant who is hurriedly bringing the ominous basin arrives too late !

Nevertheless an opportunity was afforded them of securing a tolerably decorous burial. Since the desire for an orthodox funeral had penetrated the lower classes, enterprising people had undertaken to satisfy their demand. They procured an old empty tomb, enlarged it, and let out places in it. There would soon be no space left, for coffins were piled up over each other from the floor to the ceiling, but yet it was a real tomb which was thus available for the fisherman, the peasant, the artisan, or the dancing girl. They were laid in real coffins, and the survivors could deposit their tomb equipment and other gifts, as was done for wealthy people. But there were again poorer people who could not hope for a place even in such a public tomb. Where their bodies were laid in the sand we do not know, but we believe that we can discern their attempts at participation in the benefits of a tomb. They fashioned small wooden dolls remotely resembling mummies, had them inscribed with their names, wrapped them in a scrap of linen and laid them in a small coffin; this was buried in front of the entrance to a large tomb, in the hopes that by means of his wooden representatives, the deceased would have some share in the benefits enjoyed by the occupant of the tomb. The importance attached to the eternals of the burial, which is made evident by these expedients, appears also in the form of the coffin. Up to this tiine the coffin had merely been what was required for its purpose - a strong box that secured the body from injury. But in the New Kingdom a most unnatural fashion was adopted, and it was made in the form of a mummy, for to the people at this period the form of the mummy was considered something marvellous and sacred ; even where the mummy mas laid for greater safety in several coffins, as from the time of the Middle Kingdom was often done, the form of the outer granite sarcophagus resembled its contents. At the beginning of this period the mummy-shaped coffin often has the appearance of being wrapped in wings; one should be an Egyptian to understand this. As the goddess Isis once 1 AusfLirhl Verz., S. 184."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"140 ,4 HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION protected the corpse of Osiris by taking him between her wings, so will she do to this new Osiris represented by the mummy. Towards the end of the New Kingdom the attempt to give expression to the sacredness of the mummy was made by painting the coffin with countless religious illustrations ; gods, sacred animals and sacred symbols must figure there, and it is easy to see how mechanically and perfunctorily this work was accomplished by the manufacturers. I use the word manufac - turers advisedly, for it is characteristic of the funerary customs of the New Kingdom that the things required for them were manufactured and offered for sale. It is easy to prove that this was the case, On objects where the name of the deceased must appear in the inscriptions the manufacturers left a gap, in which the purchaser could insert the name. As a rule this was done, but it is omitted fairly often, and this omission shows us the mercenary manner in which the old customs were now observed. To this there is one exception, the portrait statue of the deceased, the nature of which precluded the possibility of any such wholesale production. This statue is rendered with great care, down to the most delicate features of the face, the details of the clothing and also of the inscription. All this must have been done in accordance with the directions of the purchaser. A statue and a wooden figure in the Berlin museum, however, prove that even this was occasionally left unfinished. By far the most numerous objects found in tombs of the New Kingdom are the so-called ushebtis, the small figures of mummy form, which to - day crowd our museums. In the Middle Kingdom when they first occasionally appear, they afford no clue as to the object for which they were laid in the graves; they bear only the name of the dead. In the New Kingdom their duty to the dead is clearly indicated by the implements they hold in their hands, hoes with which to work in the fields and a basket, Oh thou ushebti, when I am called, and when I am required to do any kind of work, which is done in the underworld . . . and am required at any time to cause the fields to Jlozcrish, to irrigate the banks, to convey the sand from the east to the west, thou shalt say, The inscription on them tells us more."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"FUNERARY CUSTOMS OF THE NEW KINGDOM 141 here am 1.l The meaning of these specified labours must remain uncertain.

It is a primitive concep- tion which here reappears. Once upon a time, when the nation was a nation of peasants, they dreamed of a paradise for their dead in which barley should grow seven cubits high, with ears two cubits in length ; to be a labourer on such land was the happiest fate conceivable. This idea lasted on, and when Osiris began to be accepted as king of the dead, it was also considered that he would deal with his subjects in the same way as the earthly king did with his vassals. He would draw up lists of them, and from this register he would call first to one, then to another, of the deceased, to come to work in the fields, to irrigate the land and to construct dams.

In this perplexity some ingenious brain hit on this strange alternative - to supply the dead with these figures as substitutes, and let them undertake the work in his place. Even the king could not dispense with them, and any one who has observed the crowd of ushebtis of Sethos I. in our museums, will realize that they must have been made for him by the thousand. Among ushebtis of private people we find some single ones of especially careful workman- ship, which are almost treated as portraits of the deceased. These would be laid with special care each in a small coffin, while the usual rougher ones are merely placed together in wooden boxes. As superstition increased, a new terror connected itself with these figures ; what if the dead man met in the hereafter with an enemy who rendered the ushebtis disloyal to him, as had once occurred to him with his servants during his life 1 An especially cautious man would therefore write on his ushebti after the usual formula these words : Obey him only who made thee, do not obey his enemy.l As the principal intention in depositing these figures was to enable a man to escape his future destiny, so a similar result was aimed at in providing the so - called heart scarabs. We have already seen how the conception of Osiris as king of the dead led to a demand for the ethical purity of the deceased, and also how a judgment of the dead was believed in, where the heart of the dead was weighed in the scales. That this idea was not universally acceptable is easily understood, but the means used to escape this pressing danger is far more difficult to reconcile with our ideas. An attempt was made to get rid of that inconvenient witness. On the breast of the corpse, over the position occupied by the heart, was laid a large stone beetle, which was a sacred symbol representing the sun god ; on it was inscribed these words: Oh heart that I have from my mother! Oh heart that belongs to my syiyit, do not appear against nze as witness, provide no oyposition ugyainst me before the judges, do not 1 Ausfurhl.

Considering all those things as a whole, we observe that the burial customs of the New Kingdom have, to a large extent, lost their primitive simple character, while their religious and magical characteristics have greatly developed. This is shown also in the changes in the funerary literature. We have seen how the kings at the end of the Old Kingdom secured for themselves a collection of these writings in the inscriptions in their pyramids, and again later how private people had similar documents inscribed on their coffins. In the New Kingdom not only the walls of the tombs were in great measure decorated with these religious texts, but also long rolls of papyrus were placed with the dead, containing spells, the knowledge of which was considered specially useful for him, as is stated at the end : he who knotueth this spell he shall enjoy this or that good fortune. These texts form the so-called Book of the Dead, of which we have quoted so much in the fourth chapter, when describing the later conceptions regarding the realms of the dead. By the end of the New Kingdom other papyri are added, that Book of Amduat, which was first compiled as a useful protection for the royal tombs (p. 109).

This did not prevent these Books of the Dead, which contained so many ancient sacred sayings, from being themselves for the next few centuries regarded as in some way sacred, and from being treated accordingly. Thus further mystifications were continually introduced into the funerary customs of the Egyptians, until by the time of the New Kingdom we expect to find them stifled ere long in their own absurdities.

It is not difficult to see how the belief in such a possibility could arise. On one occasion it appears that a prayer has been heard by the deity, on another it is apparently ignored ; thus the idea naturally arises that the words in which the prayer was uttered on the first occasion must have been specially acceptable to the god. This construction is therefore accepted as the most effective, and becomes a formula which is regarded as certainly successful and able to control destiny. This erroneous conclusion leads further to the adoption of certain actions or prohibitions. To-day we have been lucky in some particulars in which we were unlucky yesterday : obviously we offended the deity yesterday in some way, whereas to - day we have pleased him. Could we only discover how this was, we might in future avoid the misfortune and secure the good luck. He who ponders over these matters, and understands the nature of the gods, may soon discover this point, and he who is most intimately acquainted with the gods must necessarily be the best magician. In the case of the Egyptians, it was the “chief kherheb” (p. 55), the priest who knew the sacred writings from beginning to end, who was considered to be the man best qualified. When once the ideas of a nation have struck out in this direction - and it is precisely the youthful unsophisticated nations that are most readily attracted by it - there is no check on it, and by the side of the noble plant of religion there flourishes this fantastic weed of magic, With nations of limited 14%"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"MAGIC I49 understanding it completely stifles religion and there ensues a barbarism, where the magical fetish is the supreme object, and where the sorcerer with his hocus - pocus takes the place of the priest, No one would wish to ascribe a similar condition of affairs to such a youthful nation as the ancient Egyptians; it would be as incongruous as it would be to compare the imbecility of a childish old man with the folly of a promising youth. But the Egyptian people shared very fully, and also at an early period, in this absurdity. It is true that it is di6cult to define the limits; not every custom that deals with the supernatural must be immediately stigmatised as magic. To give food to the dead, or to paint pictures for him on the walls of the tombs, of a life of sheltered ease, is not to deal with magic, and to recite the formula of offerings at the grave is to offer up a prayer, lifeless and formal though it may be. Apart from the worship of the gods, and the cult of the dead, and also setting aside the Book of the Dead and its magical developments of which we have already spoken (p. 147), we shall find enough remaining. The simplest and perhaps the most primitive are those in which the magician himself informs the evil principle that he will exorcise it. One of the primitive spells against serpents, which we find in the Pyramids, runs thus: the serpent sinks which comes out of the earth, thejlume sinks which comes forth from the sea. Sink down!l Or the sorcerer assures the dead, who have haunted a house and brought illness into it, that he can in turn injure them; he can destroy their graves and deprive them of their offeringsq2 He explains to one malady that it would be perilous for it to attack this patient since there is no member of his body which is not uncanny.

He appeals to Re, the all - seeing, that he will keep watch on the evil spirits? or he accuses the serpent to Re on account of its evil deeds. It has bitten the earth, it has bitten Keb? or he details to the diseases how such and such a limb of a man is under the charge of a god. He also frequently speaks as though he himself were a god : FZow forth, poison, come, $ow to the growad ! Horus commands thee, he destroys thee, he spits at thee.

And as it was only common-sense to allude directly to these prototypes, a form of spell was composed which consists of an episode out of the history of the gods, from which practical application can be drawn. This is the case with the following spell, which cures those who are stung by a scorpion, by means of the goddess Bast (p. 13) : Oh Re! come to thy daughter, whom a scorpion has bitten on a lonely road !

Naturally, however, those gods were most frequently appealed to whose lives were more especially the divine prototype of human life-Osiris and his family group. The crocodile will retreat in alarm when he is reminded how the body of Osiris lay in the water, and was guarded by the gods : Osiris lies in the water, the Horus eye is with him, the great beetle spreads itself oaer him . . . he who lies in the water, comes out of it whole; who draws near to him in the water, draws near to the Horus eye.

Horus was now established as the divine child before all others, and all things that a mortal boy was obliged to do in Egypt could be ascribed to him. In other respects also the authenticity of these references to the legends which occur in the spells is doubtful. So far as we have quoted the assistance of the gods appears as a gift which they grant when the magician addresses them in the correct terms, but other instances show a remarkable reversal of natural relations; in order to force him to do his will, the magician threatens the deity. Even in the ancient funerary literature we find similar threats. Oh, ye gods of the horizon! begins a spell which has come down to us from the pyramid texts. Verily, if ye desire that Atum (your lord) should live, that ye may anoint yourselves with oil, that ye may put on garments, that ye may receive your food; then take his A.Z. 1898. 129. Mag.

As in the pyramid texts we have already quoted, he threatens to speak to men this name, so he does in later magic. For these names of the gods possess terrible powers. If one of them is uttered on the bank of the river, the torrent is set free, and if one is uttered on land $ashes of light are emitted. When a crocodile attacks the magician who knows this name, he will by its power cause the earth to fall into the river, the south will become north, and the world will turn round? Where, however, did the magician learn these secret names, on the knowledge of which he so greatly prides himself! This question must often have been asked, for a magical text of the New Kingdom undertakes to answer the question candidly. It relates how the secret name of Re was once told. Once upon a time, when Re still ruled on earth over gods and men together, Isis was the most subtle of all women, more subtle than men, gods and the illuminated one. There was nothing in heaven or upon earth which she did not know, only she did not know the real name of Re, who possessed so many names ; she determined however to learn it. When the god had grown aged, his mouth quivered and his spittle fell to the ground. This Isis kneaded with her hand together with the earth which was with it, and made of it a magniJcent serpent. . . . This she laid on the path 6y which the great god passed when he wished to visit the two lands. Thus when Re, followed by the gods, walked there, as he did every day, the serpent stung him. Tho voice of his Majesty pierced even to heaven. His gods said, Pyr. 246 = P. 161. Totenbuch, 6. 5. ib. 293 = P. 439. 4 Mag.

Something unwholesome hath wounded me ; I feel it, but mine eyes do not see it. . . . I have never suffered pain equal to this. . , .

It is not $re, and it is not water, but my heart is on$re, my body trembles, and all my limbs quiver.” Thus Re lamented and caused the divine children to be called, those oj excellent speech and learned tongue, and all drew near sorrowfully. Also Isis came with her excellence, whose mouth is full of the breath of l@, whose spells drive away disease, and whose speech is beloved by those who have no breath. She said, (‘ What is it ? what is it, divine father Z Behold a serpent hath wounded thee, one of thy children Iaath lifted up his head against thee, I will overthrow it by means of powerful magic.” The glorious god opened his mouth: ((As I was on the way, and was talcing my walk in Egypt and the desert, for my heart desired to see what I had created, then was I wounded by a serpent that I did not see.

It is probably otherwise with a primitjive spell which ensures for the dead the use of the celestial ladder (p. 96): Come ladder (moket), come poket, thy name, which the gods uttered? may here mean that the gods do not call the ladder moket, as men do, but polcet, and also the strange words, more especially of the late period, which occur repeatedly in the magic spells, were certainly for the most part considered as the secret names of the gods.

During the eleventh and tenth centuries B . C . Egypt was divided into a number of small and feeble states. The high priests of Amon reigned at Thebes, a king reigned at Tanis in the northern Delta, and there were also other rulers, most of whom were probably leaders of Libyan soldiery. Finally, about 950 B .c., one of these Libyan rulers, the powerful Sheshonk, whose capital was at Bubastis in the Delta, acquired the supremacy, and his family continued some time in power. In consequence of this, the cat-headed Bast, goddess of Bubastis, rose to be the oflicial deity of the kingdom and the other gods of the Delta also profited by the favour of the monarch. But, on the other hand, the glory of the former capital of Upper Egypt and of its god had by no means disappeared, and the Bubastite rulers gave proof of their devotion for Amon : they once more resumed work at the colossal buildings of Karnak and thereby showed that they also were adherents of Amon. In doing this they must have been influenced by practical considerations, for Thebes was a site that rewarded any trouble expended on it. It is true that none of the royal houses of the later period took formal possession of Thebes, for a remarkable fiction had arisen during these centuries to which they all were forced to submit. Thebes could never again be the property of any earthly prince, for it had a divine ruler, Amon ; and his representative in the government on earth was not, as we should naturally suppose, his high priest, but his diwine wve, the mortal bride of the god (p. 72). Thus Thebes had become a sort of spiritual principality, governed by a lady of high 165"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"166 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION rank, and it was the ambition of every royal house to secure this lofty position for one of its princesses.

This-occurred repeatedly during this century and those that followed, and it is not without amusement that we read in an inscription of Psammetichus I. how he accounts for such an event. Owing to his profound gratitude to the god Amon, he feels compelled to present him with his daughter Nitokris ; therefore he gives her to the divine wife Shepen-wepet as her great daughter, and in the year 655 sends her with great ceremony to Thebes, where the whole population welcomes her. When she came to the divine wqe Shepen - wept, she beheld her, was contented with her, and loved her.l The remarkable influence exercised by this dominion of Amon shows itself in another direction, in the oracles given by him ; we meet with these declarations of the will of Amon as early as the beginning of the New Kingdom, when, contrary to all precedent, he appointed Princess Hat- shepsut successor to the throne. During the following centuries this institution appears to have further developed, and we find the gods interfering in the doings of mankind. Under Ramses 11. a high official and ambassador of the king erected a memorial to Isis because she had prophesied of him while he was the great one of the Matoi, that he should rise still higher. If I understand rightly, he was taking part in a procession among the princes when the sacred image in its bark halted before him and bowed to him; and in a letter which must date from the end of the twentieth A.

But it was in this decadent period in Egypt, with which we are now concerned, that the oracle in Thebes became the supreme dispenser of advice and judgment. When it was found necessary to fetch wood from Lebanon to repair the temple barks, Amon said to the high-priest, “send me,” and a figure of the god specially adapted for such a journey, the Amon of the roads, was dispatched in charge of a temple official? Should a person of high standing wish to arrange for the future disposal of his property, the god would graciously accord him a command : Thus saith Amon - Re, the great god, the great primeval being ; this landed property which belongs to N. is acquired in such a manner, and situated in such a place - it is all carried on actively-1 establish it to his son . . . and whoever yemoves this decree, which is placed in the temple, he is a fool and far from altering my word.

Then offerings were made to him and he wus greeted, and the high-priest laid before him how those unfortunates were banished from the oasis, and how that the god might forbid further banishments from the oasis, and how this decree might be inscribed on a memorial tablet, and to each request the great god nodded greatly, greatly: In another case, Thutmosis, one of the special priests of Amon, lay under strong suspicion of having embezzled from the granaries of the god.

On a subsequent day the high - priest lays before the god orally another matter of which Thutmosis is accused, and at each petition, the god, if I rightly understand, pronounces an acquittal. By this means Thutmosis at length obtains a general pardon, and finally the god is pressed to instal Thutmosis in the office of a divine father of Amon, a szqerin- tendent of estates, superintendent of the granaries, chief scribe of the commaiads of Amon and overseer of the archives of the granaries of the estates of Anton, and to these propositions also the great god assented. Re may hope that he never had occasion to regret his consent? We thus find a theocracy in its most absurd form established at Thebes; it took the place of a moribund government, and there is no doubt that the more powerful rulers of later times put an end to it, although the external forms of the rule of Amon continued even into the Persian period. When we examine into the history of the Egyptian religion in foreign lands we shall see how this theocracy struck even deeper root in another part of the world where it was transplanted. Before we leave this period of transition, another phenomenon must be considered which becomes specially apparent at this time, although its beginnings belong to an early period : the murderer of Osiris was at last overtaken by his punishment. For thousands of years the Egyptians had quietly accepted the fact that Set had murdered Osiris, and had unjustly brought an 1 Naville, Inscription .EFistoviqw de Piiaodjem, 111."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"RELIGION OF THE LATE PERIOD 169 action against him, and, nevertheless, had continued to include him among the gods. Indeed, during the latter half of the New Kingdom his cult received new life owing to his being con- sidered the same as the Hyksos god Sutekh and to the circum- stance of Sethos, who was named after him, obtaining the throne. But the evil character fastened on him by the legend still made itself felt, and when King Sethos constructed his great rock tomb, it did not appear befitting that the name of Set should appearin those chambers ruled overby Osiris, god of the dead ; the king therefore arranged that in his own grave he should not be called Sethos, he of Set, but he of Osiris. It was not long before the popular dislike of Set rose to such a pitch that a man writing his detested name would himself erase it.l Finally, his figure and name were erased from the temple reliefs, for the ancient god had become a devil, the enemy of all the gods : he had taken over the rdle hitherto played by the storm- dragon Apophis. Any one who had followed the Egyptian religion up to this point would naturally imagine that it was hastening to final decay and a speedy end, and that the nation itself was power - less and out of date, a prey for foreign aggressors. And yet the ancient nation roused itself once more, and the religion was endued with new life; a renewed youth it cannot be called. Towards the end of the eighth century we find marked symp - toms of a reaction in the ideas of the people. Until then the reign of Ramses 11. had been looked upon as the culminating period of Egypt’s greatness, and served as a model in external matters, but now the Old Kingdom came into vogue as the ideal to be followed. Everywhere in Upper Egypt where Ethiopian kings were paramount, as well as with their neighbours, the princes of Sais, we find this same endeavour ; and when Egypt once more became a flourishing state under the house of Psam- rnetichus, this tendency was so strong that looking at the monuments produced at this time we might well imagine our- selves back in the Old Kingdom. It seems as though the ancient nation was struggling after its lost youth, when it lived apart undisturbed by any foreign aggression, that time to the This is seen on the twenty - second dynasty papyrus at Berlin."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"170 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION magnificence of which the pyramids bore witness. But, how - ever pathetic this search after a dreamed - of ideal may appear, the way in which it asserted itself had an unsound element. From the first the imitation assumed the character of learned anti - quarianism, men wrote in the language of the Old Kingdom and employed its orthography, which was fully two thousand years out of date; the modern population was represented in the antique costume, and the contemporaries of Psammetichus were given the titles and names of the court of Kheops. By this reversion to the Old Kingdom, religion received fresh impetus, and it pervaded the entire life of the nation as its sole purpose to a degree it had never done before, so that the Egyptians were termed the most pious of all men and became the wonder of their Greek contemporaries. They carefully ob- F I G . 78. SACRED F I S H . FIO. 79. SACRED SRAKE AND (Berlin, 2750.) ICHNEUMON.

With what eagerness all the deities were worshipped by the people is shown by the innumerable bronze figures of gods and of temple furniture which at this time were dedicated in the temples by the poorer people, and of which our museums are full. It was the strange side of the Egyptian belief, such as the worship of animals, that developed most strongly during this phase in the minds of the people. The great time had arrived for sacred snakes, birds, rams and cats : they were petted by the people, and it was a meritorious work to provide for their burial.

In other ways also the Saite kings vied with each other in their devotion to the gods ; they commenced lavish buildings, and provided immense revenues for the sanctuaries, especially at the new residence of the king at Sais, where the local goddess Neith now rose into great prominence. These Pharaohs also restored all the monuments of ancient piety, from the pyramids and temples to the ancient wooden tablet, of the worle of the ancestors, which the worms had eaten away, and which was now replaced by a basalt tablet.2 Priestly orders that had long dis - appeared, were once more reinstated, and to read an inscription of this late time with the endless titularies of the priests fills US with amazement at the way in which all these details were revived.

Notwithstanding its very different form, Lower Egypt was divided into the same number of nomes as Upper Egypt, and in some respects there was a remarkable similarity between all these nomes: a god and a relic of Osiris, a high - priest and high - priestess, a sacred ship, a sacred tree, and a sacred snake, an inundated land and a swamp. And all of these had special ancient names which a man must know, and also he must know the dates of the great festivals, and what was for - bidden in them. What pleasure there was in ascertaining all these details and grouping them together, and what useful knowledge it was ! It was not only details from the actual ancient religion, and the actual ancient cults, which were thuv col- lected and revived; but it is evident that anything was accepted that was old and strange, no inquiry of any length was made into its origin, or whether it had ever been really accepted. Offshoots of magic such as strange compound forms of different gods were admitted into the religion: and also deliberate jests were not disdained. Because the gods are often represented as birds - Horus as a hawk, Nekhbet as a vulture, Thoth as an ibis - a bird form can be given to the great gods of each nome. Therefore Khnum is a hawk with the head of a ram, Wepwawet a jackal-headed sparrow. Bast is a cat-headed hawk, and so forth, while in addition each of these heads has its own proper crown.

Before the scribe dipped his pen in the water - jar he poured out a few drops as a libation to Imhotep? the physician venerated him as patron of their science, and the people finally accepted him wholly as a god of medicine, Asklepios as the Grzco-Egyptians called him. For a long time after this the new deity bore obvious signs of his human origin; he was represented clothed in the ancient garments of man, of antique fashion, without crown or sceptre, or the beard worn by the gods ; and his cult still retained the forms of the worship of the dead, as they mere performed in the tombs of people of rank.

We have given here a very scanty sketch of the later religion, and, had we only Egyptian sources to rely on, it would be difficult to follow it farther. While there is so much in the inscriptions and papyri of this epoch relating to the gods and their cults, we nevertheless learn little from them regarding the actual belief of this time. They are reproductions of extremely ancient ideas, and it would be a hazardous enterprise to attempt to discover which of them all were actually believed at this period. But here, where our Egyptian sources fail us, we receive for the first time help from outside: about 450 B . C . Herodotus, an indefatigable and careful observer, travelled in Egypt. He observed exactly those things which are of special interest to us, for he was convinced that these Egyptian gods were no other than his own. Osiris and Isis are in his eyes Dionysos and Demeter, Horus is Apollo, Set, the enemy of the gods, is the gigantic Typhon, Neith of Sais is Athene, Min is Pan, and Amon Zeus, while even the cat - headed Bast must reconcile her - self to being Artemis. As may be expected at that time, Isis and Osiris form in his eyes the central points of the religion ; they are the gods worshipped by all Egyptians? He is proudly conscious that a glimpse into the mysteries of the priests was afforded him, even while he is faithful to his vow to divulge none of them.3 1 Manetho, in Josephus c.

In a conflagration the rescue of the cats is of more import - ance than putting out the fire?

Also the partial burning of the offering was certainly an innovation, brought into Egypt by foreigners. It is true that the earlier Egyptians sought to supply the deity with provisions by means of burning, but this was only in exceptional cases, perhaps for a god who tarried far off, but now the burnt-offering had become a regular part of the temple ceremonial. Whence the later Egyptians had acquired this custom is shown by its name-glil-which is Canaanitish. It must have been due to foreign influence that the oracle, that played so important a part in the Greek world at this time, was also thoroughly established on the banks of the Nile. Herodotus knew of no fewer than seven gods in Egypt who spake by oracles. Of these, the most reliable was considered to be that of But0 in the town of the same name.2 The gods also give an intimation of their intentions by means of remarkable events. These are carefully observed by the Egyptians, who write down what follows upon these prodigies? They aIso consider that the fate of a person is fixed by the day of his birth, for every day belongs to a special god? In every way they are more religious than other nations: to whom, however, they imparted many of their customs and ideas. This is the case with circumcision, which they were the first to introduce, from motives of cleanliness: and again with their abhorrence of swine: which must have been connected with the wounding of Horus by Set in the form of a bZacl%pig,s and finally and chiefly in their reverence for the cow, which was never eaten or sacrificed, because thus Isis of the cow’s horns would be injured.

According to ancient custom they wear sandals of papyrus and linen clothes - woollen ones are abhorrent to the gods.3 In reading these descriptions at the present day it is obvious that the Greek traveller entertained that feeling of respect for the Egyptians which was necessarily aroused by their extremely ancient civilization, but that he regarded this religious nation very much as we to - day consider the Chinese or the natives of India. To him the Egyptians appeared as the survivors of a bygone phase of humanity. They regarded other nations round them with narrow - minded contempt as unclean, and not so intimate with the gods as they themselves. In the new life pulsating in the world around them they neither could nor would take their share, but they still desired to pursue their life in the service and under the care of their gods. So long as this was permitted them, they cared little for anything else. All the various rulers, who followed upon the downfall of the Saite rulers in Egypt, endeavoured therefore to maintain a good footing with the priests as the special representatives of the nation. Even Kambyses, whose madness had at first so deeply injured the Egyptians (he had actually slain the Apis bull with added insults), had not been able entirely to ignore this religious faction; and they possessed a remarkably able representative who was close to his person, in the body- physician Uza-hor-res-net, He knew at any rate how to gain his interest for Sais; he had shown his Majesty how great is Sais . . . and how gyeat is the temple of Neith, and had instructed him in all the sanctuaries of Sais.

And when Uza-hor-res-net informed Kambyses that all manner of foreigners lived upon the ground and pavement of the temple, and that their presence was an abomination to the pious Egyptians, the Persian king did what the native kings had not done, he commanded that the houses of the foreigners should be destroyed, and ordered them to settle outside the boundary walls of the temple area. Under Darius also the body - physician played his part success - fully : as a physician he proved to him how excellent is this art of Egyptian medicine 4% order to keep every suferer in life; the king sent him to Egypt that he might once more establish in Sais the House of L+%, as the school of the priests was called, the former seat of medical learning.

TheEgyptian dynasts, contemporaries of thePersian conquerors, did all they could to secure assistance for the religion of the country. The piety of the two Pharaohs of the fourth century, whom we, in common with the Greeks, call Nektanebus, is mani- fest in all parts of the country. However uncertain their political status might be - the Persians had, in fact, subjugated them - the building of temples was carried on by them, as though the ancient supremacy of the Pharaohs were as unques - tioned as it had been in the time of Amenophis and Ramses.2 The hardest and most costly material was employed for these buildings, and to build a temple entirely of the red granite of Assuan, as was done by Nektanebus I. in his native town of Behbet, was a feat unparalleled even among the Egyptians, skilled architects as they were. In the inscriptions of this king also we find the same anxiety to continue in favour with the priesthood. At Abydos the Statue in Vatican; for the latter part see Schafer, A. Z., 37. 72.

As a result of that complaint Nektanebus I. issued a decree in the year 378 that any malefactor guilty of further insult to the hills should be hewn to pieces. Also when Nektanebus 11. came to the throne in 361 B . C . he immediately showed his great love for the gods of his country, and hatred of foreigners. His predecessor had of necessity levied a tax of ten per cent. on all imports and manufactures, and Nektanebus himself was in no position to forego it. But two important items of this he assigned to Neith for her offerings : the tax on the imports from the Greek seas and that obtained from the artisans of the Greek town of Naukratis? If a Pharaoh of the fourth century found it impossible to dispense with these active, industrious and skilful foreigners, if he could not prevent their settling on the sacred soil of Egypt, they should at least pay a penalty to the gods. What hatred to the foreigners on the part of the pious Egyptian is shown here ! But it was a powerless, senile hatred, fated soon to perish.

All kinds of funerary literature that had ever existed was sought out and placed with the dead, either on papyri or in the endless inscrip - tions on the coffins and tombs. The pyramid texts (p. 88) which had almost fallen into oblivion since the Old Kingdom, once more re-appeared; the texts of the Book of the Dead were embodied in a codex, for which a papyrus roll, very nearly twenty metres in length, was required ; the chapters of the Voyage of the Sun were introduced with their usual illustrations on the great stone sarcophagi. And to all this ancient literature smaller books were now added, which claimed to be ancient, although many of them were certainly of recent fabrication, Among them was the lament of Isis and Nephthys over their brother Osiris, which we have already quoted in part (p. 33) ; there was the Book of Breathings, which was specially popular in Thebes; there was the lament over Sokaris, the ritual of embalming, the Book of the conquest of Apophis, and many others. There must have been much of the early literature which was incomprehensible at this time, for most of the texts were distorted to the verge of meaninglessness; but it was precisely this that made them appear so mysterious, and at this period mystery and incomprehensibility were considered to be the distinguishing marks of what was sacred and venerable. The royal tombs of the late period are lost to us, but the 184"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"THE DEAD AT THE LATE PERIOD 185 graves of rich private personages afford abundant proof of the way in which obligations to the dead were fulfilled at this time. They exceed in grandeur all earlier graves. Not one of the royal tombs of Thebes can vie with the tomb of a certain Peta- menope, who lived in Thebes during the Saitic period, and, according to old custom, called himself a chief Kherheb. We enter this tomb through two forecourts, with large gateways, behind which are two chambers supported by columns cut out of the cliffs, and we then reach a double line of passages, halls and chambers. At the end of one of these we come upon a mass of rock fifteen metres in length and ten metres wide, and in the form of an immense sarcophagus. This indicates the place beneath which the dead man lay. To reach the place it is necessary to descend a shaft leading from one of the earlier chambers, to cross three rooms, and then to descend another shaft. This opens into a chamber behind which is situated the great hall, where the sarcophagus once stood. The graves of this period which survive at Gizeh and Sakkara are contrived with equal skill. Their superstructure has now disappeared, but the most important part is still there, the deep, wide shaft, at the bottom of which the sarcophagus stands like an independent edifice. No doubt the arrangements of these graves contain weighty mysteries ; some may be models of the under - world, while others represent the grave of Osiris in the shaft of Ro - Setau. The decoration of these tombs is, of course, of a religious character, and is borrowed from the mortuary literature. In many graves, also, there are series of scenes of daily life, which we hail with joy, as we possess elsewhere nothing of any sort to illustrate the daily life and occupations of the late period. But our delight is of short duration, for these pictures of the slaughter of sacrificial animals, or the offering of birds, with their accompanying inscriptions, are copied from some grave of the Old Kingdom; in the case of the remarkable series of handicrafts in the grave of Aba at Thebes, we can actually recognize the original source from which they were copied by the later artist.

It was the antiquarianism of the period that painted these pictures, the same tendency that also dominated religion and art. The magnificence of the Saite tombs corresponds with that of their coffins. For people of rank, dark granite or black basalt was considered necessary, and frequently they are positive marvels of technical skill. Some are of mummy form, as was customary from the time of the New Kingdom, while others are made in imitation of the box - like coffins of the earlier times, but all are distinguished by a characteristic peculiarity.

How great was the demand for such stone sarcophagi is shown by the fact that means were found for securing them for people who could not themselves pay for them. For them some early grave was plundered of its coffin, the inscription erased, and another substituted in keeping with the demand of the time.

The greater the number of these things the dead possessed, the better it was for him, and they were made as dainty and costly as possible.

An Osiris figure was occasionally laid between the legs of the mummy; it was made of mud, and was filled with grains of corn, whose sprouting would typify the resurrection of the god.

In other tombs we find wooden standards surmounted by figures of sacred animals, as they were carried at the head of processions, in order to prepare the road.2 The papyrus which was laid with the body was at this time enclosed in the pedestal at the foot of a wooden figure of Osiris, and the cover that closed the aperture was an imitation of the co6n of the god.

We who look back at these things after an interval of two thousand years are constantly in danger of judging by such external evidence as survives to us from that far distant time. We see the tombs and their equipments, we see their professional guardians at their duties and their business, but if we wish to judge correctly of all this, we must take into account a side of which no inscriptions and no pictures tell us anything - that which Herodotus met with in Egypt, the loud wailing on the day of death, when the women cast earth on their heads, and ran through the town howling and smiting themselves; the quiet time of mourning, when the beard and hair were allowed to grow: as though the mourners wished to distinguish themselves from the joyous world around them, and also the long, sad remembrance of which Herodotus says nothing.

Evidently he is officiating aniong the barbarians as a skilled musician. Another trace is less certain. As we have seen, the ancient funerary cults of the Egyptians were based, primarily, on the idea that the dead must be fed by the survivors. This idea finds expression in the principal scene in all the tombs, where the deceased is represented eating his meals, either alone or with his wife. It can scarcely be a coincidence that in the tomb reliefs of northern Syria, which certainly date back to the 13 I93"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"194 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION twentieth century, we find the same representation, and that the figure of the deceased eating his repast occurs also on GrEk tomb reliefs.

The elaborate arrangements provided by the Egyptians for their dead would necessarily impress and influence other nations who had intercourse with them. Of course it remains very doubtful whether it resulted in anything more than a superficial acceptance of a foreign idea. It is quite possible that the northern nations modelled their gravestones and cofins according to Egyptian ideas ivithout knowing anything of the kingdom of Osiris ; and this remark applies to all that is found in Etruria, in Northern Africa, or even in Western Asia, that is Egyptian in character. When the Egyptian sign of life, the jackal - headed god, the winged sun, or the crowns of the gods are employed on monuments, it does not follow that the people who uied them had any other reason for doing so than the supposition that symbols that satisfied the pious Egyptians would surely prove pleasing to their own gods. We will turn first to Palestine and Phcenicia, where we are on firm ground, for we know for certain that Egyptian cults existed there in certain localities up to the end of the New Kingdom. There the Pharaohs built temples to Amon, and for a time Egypt dominated everything ; there Egyptian gods are figured on the seals, and even the tombs are painted after the fashion of Egypt.l But with these nations the foreign religion 1 There is a fragment of such a tomb scene in the Kennard collection, London."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"RELIGION IN ADJACENT COUNTRIES I95 can never have really gained the supremacy over their national beliefs, nor over those which had previously reached them from Babylon; not even at the port of Byblos, which from primitive times onward had especially close intercourse with Egypt.

In vain did he announce that the father and grandfather of the prince of Byblos had regarded Amon as their lord, and that they bought their lives to offer to him, and that the prince himself was a servant of the god. The prince acknowledged all this without hesitation, and also added that Phcenicia had acquired art and learning from Egypt, but it did not concern him any longer, and as Amon had omitted to send any money, the desire of the god was nothing to him? Undoubtedly much survived in Ph_cenicia for a long period that in externals was borrowed from the Egyptian religion, and even in 400 B . C . the people of Byblos represented the ancient goddess of their city as a Hatlior. In the oases of tlie Sahara the Egyptian religion was supreme during the New Kingdom, for Amon, the god of this epoch, was the supreme god of their temples, and when in Egypt itself Amon gradually decreased in importance, the Libyans of the oases remained faithful to him, and from the fifth century his cult once more revived here to a remarkable degree.

But as the population of these oases had scarcely sufficient wealth to undertake such buildings on their own resources, we must suppose that the money for them was sup - plied from Egypt. It is possible that these mysterious temples hidden away in the desert were considered by the Egyptians to be especially sacred, and that therefore in late times they may have been employed in connection with the belief in oracles. It is certain that it was the case with the oasis of Jupiter Amon, the oasis that lies farthest from Egypt, and which is now called Siwa. The oracle of Amon which was situated there had an appreciative public in the Greek colonists of Cyrenaika who lived only a few days’ journey from it, and who spread its fame throughout the Mediterranean world. From Asia Minor, Greece and Cnrthage his advice was sought, and a special stroke of good fortune must have rendered his fame yet more lofty. When Alexander came to Egypt in the year 332, he was anxious to see the place, and he undertook that journey into the desert, which so greatly impressed the Greeks. When the high-priest greeted Alexander on his arrival according to Egyptian ideas as the son of the god, the king chose to regard it as more than a conventional phrase : to him it was an utterance of the god, which bestowed on him the dominion of the world. From this time forth the oracle of Jupiter Amon formed one of the great marvels of the ancient world, with its temple and its blazing sun, and while Amon in consequence was regarded more and more by the Greeks as Zeus - already the ancient coins of Cyrene represent him thus - the natives theinselves adhered firmly to the Egyptian conception of him, the statue of Anion imparted his decisions exactly as it was done at Thebes, the temples were Egyptian temples, and in their graves the Am- monians depicted the scenes and texts of the Book of the Dead, But by far the most appreciative soil and the richest develop - ment was found by the Egyptian religion where once it had been forced upon races of lowest culture and meanest endow - ments, the land of the Nubians and negroes.

In the New Kingdom,"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"RELIGION IN ADJACENT COUNTRIES I97 when conquest extended greatly to the south and Nubia was organized as a province under the rule of a vizier, the religion of Nubia was Egyptianized. The great gods of the Empire, Amon, Ptah, and Re Har - akhte, were introduced into the coun - try with Isis and Hathor, and in addition to these the Nubians were given the Pharaohs themselves to worship as deities of the country. At Semneh the people were forced to worship Sesos- tris III., the first conqueror of their country, and also Thothmes 111. who had recently conquered them. At Soleb, Amenophis 111. established himself as a god ; at Abu Simbel, Ramses 11. was enthroned with the gods in the holy of holies in the great temple, while in like manner his wife is worshipped in the smaller temple with Hathor. Magnificently did the government maintain the dignity of their gods before the eyes of the Nubians. In this sparsely populated, poverty-stricken country, they bnilt temples which could bear comparison with the celebrated marvels of architec - ture of Egyptian towns, and when the narrow valley could not provide sufficient space, the cliffs themselves were hollowed out, and thus formed the marvellous rock temples of Abu Simbel, Gerf Hush, or D6r. Quite in the south, however, somewhere near the place where the Soudan railway leaves the desert and strikes once more into the Nile valley, at the town of Nepata in the pure mountain, a temple was founded which received the same name, throne of the two lands, which was borne by the great temple of Karnak. It was obvious that it was intended to be the southern counterpart of Karnak, the official temple of Nubia. It was a matter of course that the priesthood of this temple should receive a corresponding endowment of land and revenues, however little such a provision might be in accordance with the poverty of the country. It is conceivable that these magnificent developments of the Egyptian religion made a lasting impression on the circum - scribed inhabitants of the southern lands.

For the Ethiopian at this time looked on himself as the sole orthodox representative of the Egyptian religion. Most of those who called themselves Egyptians were in his eyes impure apostates; when the defeated nobles of Egypt came to the Ethiopian king to do homage, this barbarian only allowed one of them all to enter his tent, for the others were uncircumcised and eatus of fish, which is an abhomnce in the Palace: and in every town overrun by his wild hordes the king visited his gods and made offerings to them, for the gods of Egypt were also his.

By the advice of the learned Imhotep (p. 174) Zoser had once presented this god with twelve tracts of land on both sides of the river, with all their revenues and taxes, in order that he should once more send a rich Nile into the country which was suffering from its seventh year of scarcity. But later, when Isis and Osiris had won the hearts of the people, they also attained the highest rank among the Nubians, and the temple of Isis, on the small island of Phil=, which lies at the other end of the cataract, threw the neighbouring temple of Elephantine into the shade. Under Ptolemy Philadelphus the building of a new temple was begun at Philae, which, owing to its complete state of preservation and its position in most glorious scenery, formed one of the most beautiful objects of the present day, only to be drowned by European barbarians in a reservoir. This temple on the boundaries of Egypt occupied a unique position at this time, for it served simultaneously the religious requirements of two nations. Its lords were the Greek kings and the Roman emperors, but the Ethiopians also were per - mitted to make use of it.

They settled down quietly, exactly as they do at the present day, working, bargaining, and advancing money on usury, hated by the Orientals, and yet bound to them by a thousand ties of business relationship. As early as the time of Amasis it proved necessary to found a special Greek town in Egypt, Naukratis, the wealthy city frequented by all nation - alities, and when Herodotus travelled in Egypt he found the people completely accustomed to their foreign guests. Thus when Alexander’s campaign in 332 B . C . made the Greeks masters of the country, it only brought to a political conclusion what their enterprising commercial spirit had prepared long before. From this time the Greeks were the dominant people in Egypt, and the government, and part of the population of the towns were Greek. The greater part of the Egyptians remained true to their nationality and above all to their inherited belief. They remained, as they had ever been, the pious Egyptians; indeed they clung more closely to their religion than before, and when in the course of centuries these beliefs became remodelled by contact with Greece, in essentials they remained what they had always been, and instead of losing ground they actually made some advance: the Egyptian gods even gained some adherents among the Greek population., 203 . * -”.”-----=-. __*- I.."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"204 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION Owing to this position of affairs there was for the Greek kings and the Roman emperors only one possible method of governing the country : by maintaining a good understanding with the religious leaders of the people. As the State took the spiritual power under its protection and assisted it in every way, so it in turn was bound to support the secular power. This mutual support, which lasted for more than five hundred years, secured to the Egyptian church a peaceful evening of life; up to the last it dwelt in its temples in glory and splendour, protected by the State even when its own people began to forsake it. An opportunity of befriending the temples presented itself to the earlier Ptolemaic kings. In their expeditions into Asia, the three first Ptolemies found statues, temple furniture and books, which had been taken away froin the temples during the Persian times, and they gladly took the opportunity OJ return- ing them to the temyles fyom which they had been talceqt. Then the temples had ancient claims to estates, and these they now presented to them. Thus Khabbash, one of the opposing dynasts of the Persian time, at one time made a grant to the temple at Buto of a district in the immediate vicinity, but when he was overthrown by Xerxes this gift was annulled by the Persian king, It is true that the gods of But0 took their revenge on Xerxes and ordained a disgraceful end both for him and for his son - but this did not restore the property, The loss inflicted on them by the withdrawal of the gift of Khabbash had never been made good, The priests of But0 represented this to Ptolemy I., and the artful Greek thought well to grant them their request. Other undertakings of the same nature had been left behind them by the native dynasts of' the Persian time in the partly finished temple buildings. They had provided the temples with means to begin some mag- nificent buildings, and it now devolved on their Greek suc- cessors, as a point of honour, to finish what they had begun. But when they had thus provided the building for one temple, they had to consider the claims of some neighbouring god, whose ambition was no less lofty and whose sanctuary was equally in need of new buildings.

He had sailed in the bark of the god on the waters belonging to the temple as tlze Icing lzacl clone who came before him, and had fid$lled all the ceremonies of the visit as they are written down. He then observed that they were employed at the temple in repairing the damage which the feeble barbarians had done to it, and forthwith he gave coin- mand to rebuild the temple. Then his Majesty returned to his place of residence, full of joy concerning tlzat which he had done for his fathers, the very great living ram of Meiades.

When a tax on shipping was imposed on the whole country, the province of Mendes was exempt, for the priests said to his Majesty that hitherto they had never paid a tax, and all that came in and out of their city belonged to their god, and that Re had formed the land for that purpose. And, moreover, when a part of the revenues of all the nomes had to be paid into the exchequer, the king arranged that for the future Mendes should not be required to pay its share.

Finally, during the reign, an event of great good fortune occurred for Mendes : a new sacred ram was discovered. The king was informed of this, in order that he might have it tested by the college of the learned. He announced it therefore in all the temples. They examined the ram and found that its form corresponded to the requirements of the ancient writings. They gave it the title: (‘ living soul of Re, living soul of Shzc, living soul of Ke6, and living sozd of Osi~is,” as had been done since the time of the ancestors. When this was reported to the king, he commanded that the new ram should be set on his throne, and he celebrated this king of the animals of Zgypt with a great feast, at which the statue of Arsinoe had the honour of being placed next to that of the ram in the procession. While memorial tablets of this description tell us what the kings did for the gods, others show us in what manner the priests testified their gratitude. On special occasions the entire body of priests assembled at one temple, and decided in cere - monious conclave what extraordinary honours they could bestow on the king. Apart from this high honours had already been accorded to him. Even during their lifetime the kings were recognized as gods, as the gods who love as brethmn, or the beneJicent gods as was demanded by the ideas of the Hellenistic court.

They huve beneJited the temples in the land and greatly increased the dignity of the gods.

In addition to the three monthly festivals already established for the beneficent gods, a great yearly festival was now to be cele - brated in the temples and throughout the country, and this was to be on the new year’s day of the ancient year.

It was in fact unnatural and disproportionate that the most accomplished and educated monarchs of that time should appear as the friends of sacred sheep and cattle, and that the most ancient priesthood in the world should pay greater honour to kings of a foreign nationality than they had accorded to their own dynasts. Both sides went very much too far, and yet both sides gained thereby. As the priests held firmly to the antiquated forms of their cults, so in their buildings they would make no concessions to modern times.

Simi - larly in the later work in Egyptian temples we observe dete - rioration in artistic feeling, exaggeration of form, and excess of ornamentation. Another point in which these later temples differ from the early ones is the subject of their inscriptions. If we read through the whole of the inscriptions in a temple of the New Kingdom at Abydos, for instance, and examine all the scenes depicted there, we gain very few facts: the names of the gods worshipped there and of special ceremonies, a list of the offerings, and, in the best instances, the text of the ritual employed. 14 1 Dumichen, Resultate, 38 - 41."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"210 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION What besides took place in the temple (and in such an immense institution much must have occurred) is concealed from us, or rather it is omitted as self-evident, or as a matter of no import - ance.

They consist of a small raised temple, where the goddess must have been enshrined, and where she was clothed and anointed; a court where offerings were made to her, and an ante - chamber which probably contained the valuables used at this festival. Of the stairways leading to the roof the long one was used for the processions at festivals. Here the statue of the goddess was carried with great ceremony on to the roof, and deposited in a small open temple in order that the sun might behold her, and that Hathor might meet with her father. On another part of the roof lay the small sanctuary of Osiris, at this time an essential part of every large temple, for it was this god who for a long period stood first in the confidence of the Egyptians. Here in the month of Khoiakh, according to an ancient and widely diffused custom, ceremonies were observed, representing the resurrection of Osiris. A mummy figure was made of earth and grains of barley; this was moistened, and before long the grain germinated and sprouted, and the inani - mate figure became green and living. There is no doubt that this place on the temple roof, which we now invade with profane footsteps, was a spot of the deepest mystery, but there were others even more secret which are now open to us. In the thickness of the massive walls of the temple narrow secret passages were concealed, whose existence no one could surmise from the outside. In these secret places, whose contents no stranyer knows, and whose doors are colzcealed,l were kept the statues and sacred vessels when they were not required for the ceremonies. Thus these temples with their rich adornments towered over the teeming streets of the Egyptian towns, and served as witness to the crowds that centuries might come and go as they would, but within these sacred precincts all remained unchanged ; the priests daily performed their functions in the holy of holies, as had been done for thousands of years, and on the same days and in the same way as of old the people would see the great 1 Dnmichen, Resultate, P1. 36."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"214 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION deity carried out of the temple to go to some sacred spot, or to pay a friendly visit to the divine majesty of some neighbouring temple. Thus, for instance, Horus of Edfu 1 left his temple on the day before his great festival at his temple, accom- panied by his companion god Khonsu, and by the four spears with which the god fought with Set, and journeyed to meet the two deities who were on their way from other cities to visit him, Horus of El Kab, and Hathor of Denderah. These gods were to com - memorate in company, during a festival lasting many days, the triumph over Set or Set's confederates and the enthronement of Horus. But it is by no means clear that they were concerned merely with these matters, for it was a sheer unending round of cered monies that was ordained by custom for these days. Thus when the gods of Edfu wished to embark on the ship with the new arrivals in order to enter the city with due ceremony there had first to be read the spells which protect the sJbip, sacrifices were offered, distributions of wine and distributions of land were made, geese were sent flying as messengers, bunches of flowers were bought, and there were many other details to be observed.

It is further carefully chronicled which of the high officials of Upper Egypt took part as representatives of the king, and what was the correct sailing order of the ships. The musicians were on the ship of the princes of Edfu ; on landing at the temple it fell to the prince of El Kab to grasp the forepart of the ship containing the gods, while the prince of another town mas responsible for the stern.

When these had arrived, they sat down and drank, and celebrated a festival for these honoured gods; they drank and anointed themselves and shouted very loud, together with the inhabitants of the town. On the first day of this festival the group of gods with their followers, who had passed the night near the temple, were led to the upper temple, which must have been situated somewhere on the desert level. Here a11 settled down on the ground and performed offerings and ceremonies. The gods were set up and the scribes of the sacred booles performed the victory of Horus. Four times they called out, “Horus has come in triumph, and everything that was commanded him has been done. His mother Isis rejoices because he has undertaken this his charge with a glad heart. The gods of Edfu, the living souls, sit on their throne and gaze upon the lord oj the gods and joy pervades Edfu.” The priests also say in answer very often, “Rejoice, ye living souls ! Horzcs is triumphant. All that was eommarded him is aceom- plished.” Thus calling, the procession breaks up and goes to the halls of the school. First there is brought an unclean goat and an unclean ox ; the intestines are taJcen out and a great burnt sacri- $ce ofered, when the belly is &led with all manner of szueet- smelling herbs, and must and wineJow out of it.

This ends the ceremonies at the school for this day : those taking part can now rest. The people drink in the evening before this god and spend the night gaily in tlzis place. Thus thirteen days are spent until at last the strange gods depart to their homes, and those of Edfu return to their temple and peace once more reigns in the city. In all these proceedings there must have been much which the crowd that took part in the festival could not understand, notwithstanding the accompanying meaning ; and the ancient language employed by the priests in the singing and praying must have been entirely incomprehensible to them. But it must have been precisely this incomprehensibility that greatly enhanced the general impression produced. The contrast between the ancient piety and reverence and the profane modern world, between the priests with their antique garb and the Greek police and Roman officials, could only strengthen the people in their veneration for the ancient faith. Neverthe - less, as time went on the Egyptians were unable to preserve their religion altogether free from the influence of the foreigners who ruled them. The first influence that made itself felt appears to us to-day to have been the work of an able man who acted as a connect - ing link between the king and the clerics. At the court of the first two Ptolemies lived Manetho, a priest of Sebennytus in the Delta; one of those people whose education was con - ducted on two entirely different lines, very similar to the up- bringing of the modern effendi, who has studied in Paris. In order to acquaint his employers with the history of their new"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD IN EGYPT 217 country, Manetho compiled a Greek history of Egypt, a melan - choly piece of bungling which, however, he contrived to invest with an air of authority by his attitude of criticism towards Herodotiis. When the king beheld in a dream the dark god of Sinope, who bade him convey his statue to Egypt, it was Manetho who with the Greek Timotheus knew how to interpret this marvel correctly. The god who thus hankered after Egypt was at home there, even though his appearance was entirely different on the Nile and on the Black Sea. The bearded, wavy - haired god of Sinope was no other than Wser - hap, the deceased sacred Apis bill, whose grave was so greatly venerated by all people, and Wser- hap,or as he is called in Greek, Serapis, was thus a god equally sacred both to Greeks and Egyp - tians, the true god for the empire of the Ptolemies. There is no doubt that the other priests ac- cepted this explana- tion, for the Osiris Apis from this time ranked among the greatest gods of Egypt. That he was originally only a dead sacred bull was forgotten and he was confused with Osiris until finally Serapis became nothing more than the Greek 1 1ZIQ. 101. QRAVESTONE OF A MAN NAMED IYHOTEP.

In the temple, the Osiris-Serapis was known as a mummy figure with a high crown and plaited beard, but the small figures in the houses represent him in Grecian style with curly hair and beard, and with the modirxs on his head, and as this was the more beautiful figure, the Egyptian must also have pictured him under this form when he prayed to him. It was Greek art that made this breach in ancient Egyptian ideas. For this period we also possess the evidence of a Greek traveller, Strabo, who visited Egypt about the time of Angustus.

First there is his account of the worship of animals. According to him they play a more important part than we should gather from Herodotus, and he professes to know that in the Egyptian temples, taken on the whole, there are no statues of gods, but only of sacred animals? The reason for this statement may possibly be that the foreigner would naturally observe the most peculiar features of the Egyptian faith, and also it cannot be doubted that the veneration of animals had actually increased and become more prominent since the time of Herodotus. For this is the time when an inscription - full of feeling - was composed in verse for the gravestone of a poisonous serpent that had been slain: in which a Roman who had inadvertently killed a cat was put to death by the mob, and in which the people of two neighbonring provinces carried on a death feud because one worshipped a fish and the other a dog? In this veneration there was much that was no longer entirely unworldly. If the people of Denderah were able to tame crocodiles, it was good so long as it was done in accord - ance with religious traditions ; but they were well aware that money might be made of this, and that in Rome a man could exhibit as a crocodile tamer.5 It is clear also that the sacred animals in the temples were regarded as sights to be exhibited. Apis and his mother lived in small sanctuaries opening on to a court, and people were permitted to look at Apis through the door. For strangers, however, he was allowed to go free for a time in the court : no doubt for substantial payment? How the sacred crocodile was treated at Arsinoe we will leave Strabo himself to tell. He was fed witlz bread, meat and wine, which are perpetually brought hinz by strangers when they come to see Jzinz.

As another siranger cante, who had also brouglbt c~n ofering, the priest ran quickly round Zlze lake with it, and presented it in the same manner.1 An additional object of interest to educated Greeks was to see the learned priests from whom the Greeks must have learnt so much. Strabo had their houses at Heliopolis pointed out to him, but the pldosophers and astronomers themselves were no longer there ; all he met were merely sacri$eers and expoundem to stYungers.2 The Theban priests on the contrary were regarded as sages who were at the head of every branch of knowledge.3 He also mentions priestesses in Thebes, and what he relates of them is too remarkable to be ~mitted.~ The most beautiful and distinguished of the maidens there must be nominally conse - crated to the god Amon; for a whole month she may then bestow her favours on any one she choses, after that mourning is made for her and she is given in marriage. Instinctively we are reminded here of the divine wives, the chief concubines, and the singing women who formed the household of Amon during the New Kingdom, and we question whether this strange account may not have had a somewhat similar basis. But who can tell whether Strabo had not merely misunderstood the ancient custom, for no other of our sources tells anything of this strange institution ; and of the priesthood of this latest period we have abundant knowledge, such as we scarcely possess for any other period ; for, in addition to all the inscriptions which these priests themselves left behind, we have the remarkable confirmation of the Greek papyri which also illustrate this side of Egyptian life. On their gravestones, their coffins and dedi - catory inscriptions we read how they served numerous gods of such and such a temple, and others in the vicinity, that they were priests to this king, and that queen, and how they attended on the divine children of the temple, and provided for the sacred animals. And all these priesthoods connected themselves with the highest titles of the ancient Pharaonic times and proudly state that father, grandfather, and all relations both on the 1 Strabo, 17. 38. 3 ib. 17. 46. 2 ib. 17. 29. 4 ib. 17. 46."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"222 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION paternal and maternal side were also priests of high rank. And this distinguished and esteemed position, .whose burden cannot have been altogether overpowering, was doubtless combined with a good income, for a great temple of this period was in a position richly to remunerate its staff. This is shown, for instance, on an inscription at Edfu, which enumerates with great detail lands possessed by the temple in the first century B . C . There is much here which is incomprehensible to us ; but we find that they consisted of at least thirty-three square miles in land, distributed in large or small portions over various parts of Upper Egypt. We have also to remember that it is only the landed estates that are here recorded ; we do not know to what the rest of the property may have amounted, in actual gold, in rents and tribute. In any case in the Greek period it was no bad fortune to belong to the priestly body of a great temple. But if we examine the papyri1 we shall find that there were other temples where the priests had not such a brilliant lot, On the western border of the Fayum, on the lake of Moeris, was the temple of Sobk of the Island, Xoknopios as it is called by the Greeks. It had a high-priest who received a small stipend of 344 drachm=, and all the other priests together received daily about one bushel of wheat as remuneration for their trouble. They were not even immune from the statute labour on the embankments, and if these were lessened for them, it was owing to the 5 good offices of their fellow-citizens.

A magician of this time could also understand the language of birds and reptiles, he could open earth and the under-world, and summon the dead from the under-wor1d.l According to the belief of this time the dead could by other means return to the world and to life ; and a story explicitly tells us how Osiris, when he was prayed to by the Prince Khamoes for a son, sent him a dead man skilled in magic, who was born to him as his son Si-usire. Si-usire aided his father by means of his magic, and on one occasion took him down to the under - world. What the prince saw there is too remarkable to be passed over. Before the father and son entered the under-world in the necropolis of Memphis, they saw two funerals being carried out there; one was of a rich man, with a large following of mourners richly bedecked, the other was of a poor man being carried to his grave merely wrapped in a mat, and with no follower to mourn him. As they went through the various halls of the under - world, they saw in the fifth the gloriousjtcsti$ed ones. In the sixth sat Osiris himself, on his golden throne, with Anubis and Thoth standing by his side with his counsellors. Before him stood the balance on which the deeds of mankind are weighed ; he whose evil deeds are more in number than the good, is given lo the Devourer of the under - world; hissod and his body are destroyed and he shall live no longer. He whose good deeds are more in number than the evil, he is received among the divine counsellors of the Lord of the under - world, while his sozcl goes with the glorious just$ed ones to heuven. And Khamoes saw also a number of damned ; some were standing in the fourth hall, and over them hung bread and water, and they reached out for them, but men dag away the ground under their feet, and they could not reach the food. And in the door of the fifth hall there was a man whose right eye was pierced through by the pin of the door socket, so that he prayed and lamented. And Xi-usire said 1 Grifith, 8tories of the High - priests, p. 20. ib. p. 42 et seq."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD IN EGYPT 231 to his father that this condemned wretch was the rich man whose grand funeral they had witnessed ; his evil deeds had been more numerous than the good; at the throne of Osiris, however, stood a distinguished man, royally clad in finest linen ; this was the poor man who had been carried to the grave in a mat ; his good deeds had exceeded his evil deeds : therefore the outfit of the rich man had been given to him, and he had been set among the gloriozcsjtcstiified ones as a man of god who accompanies Sokharis, for he who is good upon earth, to him good is done in the under - world; but he who is evil to him evil is done.

But it is enough to show us that the under - world at this time is very different from the under-world of the earlier periods. Osiris still dwells there with his gods and spirits, but now it is only the deeds of inen which can decide their fate ; for a sinner, all the coffins and amulets and ushebtis cannot avail.

Others who were changed in this way are incompre - hensible to us. Thus Hathor now figures as a goddess of the dead, and a dead woman is no longer called an Osiris, but a Hathor. Bes now protects the dead, and a god who, according to a figure in the Berlin Museum, lets down a chaldron, possibly provides the deceased with the \" cool water \" which at this time is regarded as the most essential gift of Osiris. Every burial - place shows that during the Roman period the funerary customs were still considered of great importance. It is true that large tombs built in the new Grzco-Egyptian compound style have only rarely been found - by far the most important in Alexandria itself - but in the simple pits and shafts of cemeteries we find mummies of great splendour.

Also the features of the deceased are painted on a panel, or on a piece of linen, and laid over the face.

However atrociously they are depicted, or however little conception the man who manufactured them had of them, yet doubtless they would secure much happiness for the dead. This gorgeous outfit of the Roman mummies is probably connected with another peculiar custom, which may safely be attributed to this period? The mummies of relatives were kept at home for some time, as though the mourners were unwilling to part with them. For this purpose they were placed in coffins provided with a door that opened like that of a cupboard, or they were laid on those magnificent biers with open - work sides which we find in graves of this period.

These people, mummified according to pagan rites, and buried among pagans, were yet Christians ! The customs of paganism were still scarcely relinquished by the adherents of the new faith. When a change occurred in this respect we do not know. In any case mummifying con - tinued for a long time in Egypt. Any one who observes the mummy case represented here will be inclined to place it in the fourth century, and therefore in a period when the greater part of the Egyptians mere Christians. Yet these gilded designs with which it is adorned show nothing that is Christian, but all manner of paganism, the bark of Osiris, the ship of the sun, and the three graces, and we must therefore consider this to be the mummy of a pagan. It is not improbable, for although from the end of the third century the nation as a whole was Christian, yet paganism lingered even after that time, Among the higher classes and the people of Greek education it might even yet preponderate, and in the fourth and fifth centuries we must not imagine even the people of the lower classes to have been all Christians. As a matter of fact, very little that is distinct has come down to us concerning their faith. In Alexandria the sanctuary of Serapis was the principal temple. In Memphis the god chiefly worshipped was Asklepios, the god who had once been the sage Imhotep (p. 174) ;I but who had now almost taken the place of Ptah at Memphis. At Abydofi the little god Bes had almost superseded Osiris, and imparted oracles which were highly prized? In the neighbour- hood of Akhmin in Middle Egypt, a god named Petbe was worshipped, whom his Christian opponent compared to Kronos, and to whom he ascribed all the evil that he knew of the Greek god. In this last phase of Egyptian religion, the Greek element appears almost to have had the supremacy, for the same monk of the fifth century in his explanation mentions, in addition to Petbe and Ptah, the goddess Rhea, whose priests castrate themselves ; Apollo, the unclean, obscene performer on Ammonins Marcell., xxxii. 14. 7. 2 ib. xviii. 12. 3."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"236 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION the lyre, Zeus and his son Ares, as though they were the gods ordinarily worshipped by his pagan fellow-countrymen. Other things against which he declaims are entirely Egyptian, such as the custom of lighting a lamp at a town festival, or a howe festival, and that people call out greeting to the sun and victory to the m0on.l It was such preaching as this that brought about the clown - fall of paganism. Notwithstanding all official prohibition it had actually continued supreme for a length of time, its adherents were peaceable folk, who were quite contented to be left alone to worship their ancient gods. But the fanatical followers of the Christian religion stirred up the populace, and the temple histories of four thousand years came to an end among dis - orderly tumults. The horrible scenes that brought the ancient religion to a close in Alexandria are well known, the street fights and the storming of the temple of Serapis. But the events in the provinces of which we have any knowledge were of the same character. There Shenute? the holy man famous among the Copts, boasted that he himself had destroyed the temple of Atripe, in the neighbourhood of his cloister, and that this deed had proved an example to other people. In another case the pagans implored his forbearance with regard to their temple. He however drove them out and completely ransacked the temple ; it was a rich booty of utensils, statues and books that he brought back to his cloister. When the priests summoned courage, and brought an action against him on account of his pillaging raids, such an overwhelming crowd of Christians assembled in the town on the day of the trial that it was impossible to proceed with the case. In other places also we find the same state of affairs,which is universal wherever a minority is hated by a majority. Of the priests of a certain god Kothos the Christians set abroad a report that they stole their children and dew them, that they sprinkled the altar with their blood, and made of their guts strings for their lutes. The holy Makarios of Tkou thereupon destroyed their temple, and burnt on the same funeral pyre the god Kothos and his high - priest, whose name was Homeros.

Naturally it came about that these ruins were haunted; thus we hear of one temple where there was cm evil demon by name Bes. Many saw him as he moved about the temple, assuming all manner of forms, and many a time he issued forth and struck at passers by, and then they would become blind or lame or deaf or dumb, but the holy Moses knew how to exorcise him.2 Thus the gods of t8he ancient faith had become the ghosts of the new, and the very word enter, which once meant a god, in the language of the Christians actually signified an evil spirit. And even now, when they had become abhorred of their own nation, they yet retained a place of refuge in Egypt, albeit a melancholy one - magic. We have seen that the magicians dealt as they chose with the names and legends of the ancient gods, and that later they added to them the arts of the Jews and Greeks. Now that they vere Christians, they eagerly employed the names and forms of the new faith, but they did not abandon every - thing of the old, of which they had so long availed themselves. If a child had stomach - ache, the man who undertook to exorcise it still referred to the child HO~US, who had to undergo so many hardships in his forsaken condition. He began his magic with a long story of how the little god ‘caught a bird and devoured it raw, and how he thus got a pain in his stomach. He therefore sent the third spirit Agr@pccs, the one eyed unci? one handed, to his mother Isis, who was vpon the hill of Heliopolis, and he told her of her son’s misfortune, She said to the spirit : If thou hadst not found me, and ty thou hudst not discovered my name, the true ncme, that wJhh draws the suiz to the west and the moon to the east, and thut draws the six stars of atonement ihat Jmve their place below the sun, then ty thou hudst conjured the three thousand vessels that surround the navel, every disease and every ache and every 1 Meinoire de la Mission Arche’ologique, iv. 112 et sey. 2 Zoega.

Some knowledge of these gods had long before been introduced by Egyptian sailors and merchants who had settled in the ports and great towns of the Mediterranean. Here they formed Egyptian communities, and their fellow citizens must have felt the contagious attraction of their mysterious festivals. But this would have had no further development had not the atten - tion of the educated classes been arrested. They would in the first place be drawn to the Egyptian beliefs by the vague feeling of veneration which in those countries was accorded to ancient culture and remarkable monuments : in the Roman world there was scarcely any landscape so often represented as that of Egypt with its temples, reed huts and crocodiles. It would, moreover, be supposed that the Egyptians possessed ancient and profound learning; and it was believed that the leaders of the religious world, the Greek philosophers, had acquired the best of their learning from the Egyptian priests. Finally - and for thoughtful minds this was the principal at - traction - it was surely among this devout people that the some - thing was to be found, the lack of which was vaguely felt by S O many. Religion itself had almost perished among the educated classes, but in many individuals there was a quiet seeking after the supernatural, and anything that could gratify this would be welcome. At the present time we can observe a similar feeling among many of our contemporaries. They have lost the repose 239"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"240 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION of traditional beliefs, and they are looking for a substitute. The weak-minded fall into Spiritualism, the more powerful cling to Buddhism. Here, again, in both cases the circumstances are similar: the educated classes do not simply accept the foreign religion as it is, for it cannot adapt itself to their critical sense; the ‘I esoteric Buddhism ” of the educated woman of the present day is in fact only a garbled philosophy in Buddhist attire, and FIG. 124. SCENE ON THE NILE, FROM A ROMAN RELIEF (Berlin Antiquariunr.) IN TERRA COTTA. over the Isis belief of Plutarch the priests of Memphis and Thebes would certainly have shaken their heads. The respect manifested by the educated classes secured greater prominence for the poor priests of Isis of the Greek and Italian cities, and for their marvellous teaching, than was enjoyed by other Eastern priesthoods who also celebrated their rites on Roman soil. A further attraction was attached to the enjoyment of the"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"THE EGYPTIAN RELIGION IN EUROPE 241 Egyptian faith. For a long time the official religion opposed it, and senate and emperor tried to stamp out this ‘‘ superstition ” by means of prohibitions and restraints. It was unavailing, for if the people could not sacrifice openly to Isis, they did so all the more eagerly in secret, and they certainly had not long to wait before the prohibition was withdrawn. Finally there was no objection made when some one built a temple to Isis and Serapis, and what had been mere tolerance became open recog - nition. By the end of the first century A . D . no obloquy attached itself to the Egyptian gods, and by the close of another century they were styled those deities once Egyptian, now also Roman? The reign of Hadrian must have contributed much to this development, for he himself had travelled in Egypt, and had an enthusiastic admiration for that country and its gods. His villa on the Tiber contained an Egyptian pleasure - ground which was called Canopus. Statues of the gods in black stone in semi-Egyptian style, and subterranean halls and a sanctuary of Serapis were intended to remind the visitor of the valley of the Nile. During this journey, Antinous, the favourite of the Em - peror, was drowned in the Nile, and he con - sidered it the highest possible honour to raise the poor lad to be throne companion of the gods of Egypt? In the Greek towns the new demi - god might be represented as a melan- choly-looking youth, but in his temple in Egypt he appears as an Egyptian god; and the mausoleum in Rome, which was dedicated to him by the Emperor, was Egyptian and bore hieroglyphic inscriptions. To this day the graceful obelisk of Monte Pincio3 informs us that Osiris Antinous, the deceased, who rests in this place, which is situated within the boundaries of fortunate Rome, is recognized as a god in the sacred places of Egypt.

And in this temple food is laic1 for him upon his altars, and he is extolled by the priests and all men make pilgrimage to him because he hears the requests of those who c~y to him and the sick man is healed by means of a dream that he smds to him. It is the founding of the Graxo-Egyptian town of Antinoe which is thus described. This worship of the Greek youth at their festivals struck root, and even in the third century Antinous was still highly revered as one who healed the sick and worked miracles.1 Thus Europe, for its part, had given a god to Egypt, and who could now call the Egyptian belief a foreign one. And yet even now there were many who could not entirely overcome their horror of the animal-headed gods. This is shown by the jeers of Lucian. There sit the gods in council upon Olympus, but there is uneasiness among them, for the ancient gods of Greece cannot restrain their vexation with the individuals of doubtful standing who have obtruded themselves into their brilliant company, the unmannerly companies of Dionysos, the deities from barbarous countries, and the abstract ideas, such as “virtue” and ((fate,” invented by the philosophers. At the banquet a noisy crowd is assembled, little in accordance with the tastes of the ancient gods: ambrosia runs short, nectar becomes more and more dear ; and Momus, who makes himself spokesman for the discontented party, sets out all this grievance in a long speech, reviling especially the barbarian horde, Attis, Sabazios, Mithras, and all this company who knew no Greek and did not even understand when their healths were drunk. But he says all this may be passed over. But thou, thou dog - headed one, thou, Ebyptian wrapped in linen, who art thou Z and how canst thou, howling dog, wish to be a god ?

The reply of Zeus to Momus is evidently the answer given to scoffers by the educated adherents of Isis: You see only the external, strange features of our belief, and cannot guess what lies hidden behind them. Plutarch also says that he who takes these matters literally, and does not attempt to understand their higher meaning, must spit and purify his mouth. Then who is Osiris ? Osiris is the principle of moisture and the fructifying power of generation. He is the reasoning power of the soul and law and order in the world. Yea, he is Good itself. But Typhon is aridity, drought, sterility ; he is the lack of sense, the indiscretion of the soul, and disease and disorder in the world : he is Evil. Isis has the fruitful earth as her body, she is the feminine, the receptive half of generation in nature ; the elements for good and evil, which, in accordance with their nature, however, incline to good? All goodness and order are the work of Isis and a figure of Osiris.3 Nothing, however, is so pleasing to this goddess as inquiry into truth and right know - ledge of the divine ; she assists divine learning while Typhon wars against it. He who lives a disciplined, temperate, and chaste life devoted to the service of her temple, can attain to the knowledge of the first and highest spiritual ideas, and to this she invites us by means of her ~hrine.~ It is not the linen gar- ment and shaven head that make the Isis worshipper, although these contain profound meanings ; but the true Isis worshipper is he who ponders over sacred matters, and seeks therein for hidden truthse5 For in these matters there is nothing which is 3 ib. 64. 4 ib. 2. 6 ib. 3. possible !

Also because the sistrum is frequently decorated at the top with a cat, the profane imagine it is on account of the cat - headed, joyous Bast (p. 13). Plutarch, how - ever, knows the true reason : the cat also has a significance connected with the moon, because it is a fickle, nocturnal, prolific animal, or because it widens its eyes at the full moon.

Notwithstanding his triumphs, in which his European friends acquiesced, he is in reality no more than the deceased husband whom Isis laments. In addition to this, the human side of his character, which this god possessed in earlier days, has once more gained the ascendency to such a degree that non - believers make objection to the man Osiris.4 C.

It was naturally still more pleasing to the goddess to have her temple rebuilt by some devout worshipper. Thus at Malcesina, on the Lake of Garda, one G. Menatius restored her temple and built a porch to it at his own charges.B At Benevento one Lucilius built GI, magni$cent palace for the great Isis, the misihss of Benevento, and to her companion gods, and erected to her two obelisks of red granite, which are still in existence, with hieroglyphic inscriptions, from which we gain this information.

A smaller building stood in one corner of the courtyard, and near this was a large altar. On two sides the court was surrounded by chambers which served as dwelling-places for the priests, for storehouses, and similar uses.

By the side of Isis, Osiris, Harpo- krates, Anubis, the sacred animals and the priests, there were to be seen Dionysos and Narcissus, Chiron with Achilles, and repre- sentations of the delightful stories of Ares and Aphrodite. Two pictures which represent the history of Io effect a compro - mise ; this unfortunate favourite of Zeus, who fled to Egypt in the form of a cow, had long been recognized as the cow-goddess of Egypt, and had by a strange development been credited with giving birth to the Apis bull. The landscapes show Egyptian scenes with shrines and sphinxes or sea pieces with ships, of which Isis was the patroness. Among the marble statues of the temple, besides Isis we find Dionysos, Aphrodite, and Priapus. Five other statues have only the faces, hands, and feet of stone, the bodies being made of wood; obviously these were the statues which were arrayed in linen and carried in procession at the feasts. The largest of these wore gold earrings and carried a sistrum. While the buildings of the temple and the paintings on it were thus half or entirely Greek, great importance, on the other hand, was laid on the importation of works of actual Egyptian art. Therefore in Benevento, Pompeii, Rome, and, in fact, wherever a temple of Isis was built, ancient tables of offerings, sphinxes, statues, and other sculptures were by some means pro- cured from the inexhaustible stores of the Egyptian temples and tombs, and set up for the gratification of Isis. It was of no consequence that the old inscriptions on these monuments bore no reference to their new surroundings, for none of the people were able to read these hieroglyphs. Thus monuments of all periods of Egyptian history were brought across the sea; the Egyptian priests converted what they considered the superfluous possessions of their gods into money, and thus proved themselves to possess as few scruples as the Italian priests of the eighteenth century, who sold the altars of their churches to foreign coun - tries. From this traffic we can now discern what style of sculp - ture was most valued. If possible, the pieces must be of black or dark stone, colouring which, while it differed from that of their own statuary, appeared best to express the mysterious ideas that were ascribed to the Egyptian religion."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"THE EGYPTIAN RELIGION IN EUROPE 249 The daily rites consisted principally of simple offerings and incense burning. According to ancient custom it fell to the women who were in attendance on Isis to play the sistruni before the goddess, and sprinkling with water must also have been part of their duties, for they are represented with sistrum and water jug. Two of the great festivals connected with the worship of Isis enjoyed special fame. One was the three days’ feast in Novem - ber, when a performance was given representing the death of Osiris, the search for his body, and its discovery. What an impression was made on distant countries by these feasts is shown by the allusion to them in literature. Thus Ovid speaks of Osiris who is never szcfleiently sought for.’ Juvenal mentions the shout of the people when Osiris is found,2 and Lucan intro - duces us to the dogs who are demi-gods and the grief - compelling si~trums.~ Also from them arose the remarkable idea that the Egyptian gods found their pleasures in songs of lament- ation and not in joyous dances as did the Greek deities? It is clear that these festivals were performed in the sight of all, although their more secret ceremonies may have been confined to the restricted circle of the (( Isiaci,” those true believers who formed a religious brother- hood, and had their “school” close to the temple. Of the great feast that occurred in March, when Isis inaugur - ated navigation for the year, we have a clear account dating from the second century. It describes the festival as it was held at Kenchrea, the eastern port of K~rinth.~ The feast was opened by a group of mummers, soldiers and huntsmen, gladi- ators and philosophers, an ass as Pegasus, a she-bear as a lady, and a monkey as Ganymede.

After six officials carrying a lamp, an altar, and other sacred objects, there followed the gods themselves. As was befitting, the dog-headed Anubis came first, black with a golden head, and with caduceus and palms as his symbols. An attendant who followed with blissful steps bore a standing cow, the statue of the all - productive fruitful goddess. The casket, borne by a second attendant, con - tained the mysteries of the gloriozcs religion, and the third held to his fortunate bosom the revered image of the supreme deity: it is the model of a very sacred relic, a small gold vase, decorated with wonderful Egyptian figures, Behind, at the rear of the whole procession, came the priest with a sistrum and a wreath of roses in his hand. Thus they make their way to the sea, where a beautiful ship, adorned with Egyptian figures, awaits them. The high-priest with chaste mouth utters a pious prayer, purifies the ship, and de- dicates it to the goddess. Its mast is trimmed and the sail, and all the people sprinkle it with sweet scents. The cables which hold it are then cut, and as it sails away the people gaze after it till it has disappeared. The procession then returns to the temple, and the priests and votaries enter the chamber of the goddess, while the crowd waits in expectation. After a time the scribe of the temple comes out and proclaims the health of the emperor, the senate, the Roman nation, ships and seamen. The crowds shout as these are proclaimed, the people decorate them- selves with flowers, they kiss the feet of one of the statues of the goddess and then disperse. If this description sounds somewhat extravagant there is suffi - cient reason for it ; Lucius, the man who describes it in a romance, was one of the fortunate people who was especially intimate with the goddess; he had been accepted into the innermost circle of the faithful. Isis, to whom he owed gratitude for deliverance from a long period of distress, had previously admonished him in a dream to become one of her followers, but Mithras, the aged high - priest of Kenchrea, would not agree to receive him, as he himself had received no command from the goddess. When this"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"252 A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION at length occurred he received the lucky novice the following day into the temple. There he took from the holy of holies several books which were inscribed with animals and wonderful scrolls : from these he learned all that was necessary for consecra- tion. When Lucius had purchased all that was necessary he was led' in the company of the religious to the bath, and purified by means of lustrations. In the afternoon, at the feet of the goddess, he was instructed in the mysteries, and he was enjoined to abstain for ten days from animal food and from wine. When this time had elapsed the faithful assembled towards evening ; he put on a thin linen garment and was taken by the priests into the holy of holies. What took place there he can only indicate to us : he went into the realms of the dead and returned through all the elements. In the middle of the night he had seen the sun shining, and he had gazed upon the greater and lesser gods and had prayed to them. When he came out in the morning he had to stand on a pedestal placed in the middle of the temple before the statue of Isis; he was clothed in bright-coloured garments decor - ated with figures of animals, in his hand he held a torch, a garland of palm leaves adorned his head, and surrounded it like rays of light. Then the hangings were drawn back, and the people saw him, as he stood there, adorned like the sun. Later Lucius received a second. consecration in Rome, which also was arranged by means of dreams, After a ten days' fast he was admitted by the priest Asinius Marcellus in the Isis temple of the supreme things of the great god and fatlm of the gods, the invincible Osiris.

Most willingly did he ex- tend the preliminary fast greatly beyond the requisite time, and also ’no expenditure was too great for him. Osiris then appeared to him in his actual form, and received him into the college of the pastophori, the bearers of the divine statue,” and also into their council. This was an ancient college, founded in the time of Sulla, and Lucius was fortunate ia belonging to it. Henceforth, wherever he went, he prided himself on his shorn head, which he wore without concealment, as a sign that he was a priest of the Egyptian gods? It can only have been very rarely that Isis was worshipped with such intense enthusiasm as by this devotee, but while others worshipped her with merely superficial devotion they added at any rate to the number of her adherents. There can have been no province in the wide Roman empire where the Egyptian gods were not worshipped, and Tertullian could assert the whole world now SWKWS by Xerapis.2 We meet with them in every part of Asia Minor. In sacred Delos, which was devoted to the service of other gods, there were yet some who worshipped Isis - Astarte-Aphrodite and Eros-Harpokrates-Apollo? In Athens we find gravestones of’ female worshippers of Isis. In Northern Africa, in Spain, in the land of the Danube, in France, and even in England we meet with inscriptions relating to Isis and Serapis. Among the Alps and in Germany they obtained foot - hold in various places. The Nonsberg, close to Botzen, as we learn in terms of reproach from a Christian source: was full of the nzndness of Isis and the extravagance of Xerupis. At Prelst, in the Corinthian Glantal, there was a shrine of the Norican Isis.5 At Marienhausen, in the Rhine Province, there stood an altar of Serapis, erected by a Roman officer: while small bronze images of Egyptian gods are repeatedly found on the banks of the Rhine.

And when we find not far from this church the grave of an Egyptian, Horus, the son of Pabek, we naturally wonder whether this man, who had wandered from the Nile to the Rhine, may not have been a priest of the great goddess. Thus Isis worship flourished in Europe so long as the worship of other pagan deities continued. And also in the last attempt to revive expiring paganism Isis worship played its part. Julian acknowledged the Egyptian gods, and when, in the year 392 A.D., Arbogast the Frank placed Eugenius on the throne, and thus secured a short triumph for the pagan aristocracy, Isis was not forgotten. In the year 394 Nicoinachus Flavianus, as consul, celebrated the last official festival in Rome of the Magna Mater, and of Isis. In the same year, however, Theodosius triumphed and all was over. Even then a quiet company of adherents to the Egyptian belief existed in the Roman world. This was the circle of the mystic philosophers, who, even as late as the sixth century, taught in the chief places of culture. They 8 delighted in everything that was _, mystic, ecstatic and marvellous, and how could they fail to be in raptures with Egypt ? For was not Egypt agodly land, where the altars were supplied with all things, where there were innumerable priests, who observed all the ceremonies, and where the altars burnt continually ? The Egyptians had taught the worship of the gods to almost all the world, and we know, says the naive author of the fourth century, who supplies us with this information, that there the gods huve dwelt.and still dwell? Thus this sacred land formed the ideal of these mystics.

He composed hymns to the Egyptian gods, and wrote a work on the Egyptian religion. But however studiously he might carry on investigations, there was one thing to which he could not attain, which his more for - tunate friend Heraiskus possessed by nature. It is true that Heraiskus did not know so much of the Egyptian wisdom, but his essence was more clivine. It was given to him to feel, when he saw a statue of a god, zuhcther or not it lives. If the statue was aniinated by the god (p. 43) then his heart was roused by the sight, and body and soul were seized with ecstasy CLS though he were inspired by the god. And when he died and was being buried his body suddenly shone through the linen wrappings, as a sign that he was united with the gods. Like an ancient Egyptian of former days he was illunzinated (pp. 89, 91).i But even the mystics could not deceive themselves into thinking that any power in the world could re - establish the supremacy of these gods. They knew that they were the last of the pagans, and also that sacred Egypt itself, the copy of the heavens . . . the temple of the assembled universe, henceforth belonged to the Christians.
