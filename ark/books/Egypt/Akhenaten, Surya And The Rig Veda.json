[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Akhenaten, Sπ urya, and the R . gveda Subhash Kak July 17, 2003 A sad consequence of the colonialist historiography of the 19th century Indologists is the comparative neglect of India's interaction with Africa. Cyril Hromnik's Indo-Africa 1 (1981) is the only book on the Indian contribution to the history of sub-Saharan Africa that I am aware of, but it is just an exploratory study. The story of India's interaction with Egypt is better known, if only to scholars. Two important Øgures in this story are the Mi- tanni king Tushratta and the New Kingdom pharaoh Akhenaten. But even this encounter between the Indoaryan speaking Tushratta and the Egyptian Pharaoh is not well understood although it was to have far-reaching impli- cations for world history. The Sun King Akhenaten of Egypt (ruled 1352-1336 BC according to the mainstream view) was a son-in-law of Tushratta, the Mitanni king of North Syria, through queen Kiya. 2 (The name Tushratta is spelled Tui∑ srata in the Hittite cuneiform script, which does not distinguish between \\d\" and \\t\" very well. Some have suggested that the Sanskrit original is Da∂ saratha ,a fewothersthatitis Tves . aratha (having splendid chariots), a name which is attested in the R . gveda. Letters exchanged between Akhenaten and Tushratta have been found in Amarna in Egypt 3 and other evidence comes from the tombs of the period, which have been discovered in excellent condition. The Amarna age is one of the best-known and most romantic periods of ancient Egypt. Akhenaten was revolutionary in his religious beliefs, and many argue that his ideas mark the beginnings of the Western monotheistic tradition. This period also saw the fabulously beautiful Nefertiti, Akhen- aton's Ørst queen who came from a mixed Mitanni family, palace intrigues, artistic triumph and great personal tragedy. In this essay, I shall investigate the question whether the worship of the 1"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Sun introduced by Akhenaten might have had connections with the Indic beliefs of the Mitannis. Implications of this early encounter between the Indic and the Western worlds will also be examined in view of the widely accepted opinion amongst biblical scholars that Akhenaten's beliefs were the model for the later Jewish and Christian beliefs. 4 I shall present evidence indicating that the famous hymn to Aten by Akhenaten which is seen as a precursor to Psalm 104 of the Bible was in∞uenced by the \\Vedic\" hymns that were a part of the Mitanni heritage. In view of the important role that biblical ideas have played in history, the question of the relationship between Akhenaten's monotheism and Vedic ideas is of great signiØcance. It provides a lesson that the past consists of unexpected complexity and that in∞uences have ∞owed in diÆerent directions. I am not suggesting that the encounter between India and West Asia was one-sided; India must also have been changed in many ways. The Mitanni The Mitanni, who worshiped Vedic gods, were an Indic kingdom that had bonds of marriage across several generations with the Egyptian 18th dynasty to which Akhenaten belonged. The Mitanni were known to the Egyptians as the Naharin (N'h'ryn'), connected to the river (nahar), very probably referring to the Euphrates. At its peak, the Mitanni empire stretched from Kirkuk (ancient Arrapkha) and the Zagros mountains in western Iran in the east, through Assyria to the Mediterranean sea in the west. Its center was in the region of the Khabur River, where its capital, Wassukkani was probably located (Figure 1). The Ørst Mitanni king was Sutarna I (good sun). He was followed by Baratarna I (Paratarna, great sun), Para∂ suks . atra (ruler with axe), Saus- tatar (Sauks . atra, son of Suks . atra, the good ruler), Paratarna II, Artadπ ama (R . tadhπ aman, abiding in cosmic law), Sutarna II, Tushratta (Da∂ saratha), and Ønally Matiwazza (Mativπ aja, whose wealth is thought) during whose lifetime the Mitanni state appears to have become a vassal to Assyria. The early years of the Mitanni empire were occupied in the struggle with Egypt for control of Syria. The greatest Mitanni king was Sauks . atra who reigned during the time of Tuthmose III. He was said to have looted the 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Assyrian palace at Ashur. Under the reign of Tuthmose IV, more friendly relations were established between the Egyptians and the Mitanni. The daughter of King Artadπ ama was married to Tuthmose IV, Akhen- aten's grandfather, and the daughter of Sutarna II (Gilukhipa) was married to his father, Amenhotep III, the great builder of temples who ruled during 1390-1352 BC (\\khipa\" of these names is the Sanskrit ks . ipπ a , night). In his old age, Amenhotep wrote to Tushratta many times wishing to marry his daugh- ter, Tadukhipa. It appears that by the time she arrived Amenhotep III was dead. Tadukhipa was now married to the new king Akhenaten, becoming famous as the queen Kiya (short for Khipa). The Egyptian kings had other wives as well. Akhenaten's mother, Tiye, was the daughter of Yuya, who was a Mitanni married to a Nubian. It appears that Nefertiti was the daughter of Tiye's brother Ay, who was to become king himself. The 18th dynasty had a liberal dose of Indic blood. But how could an Indic kingdom be so far from India, near Egypt? A plausible scenario is that after catastrophic earthquakes dried up the Saras- vati river around 1900 BC, many groups of Indic people started moving West. 5 This idea of westward movement of Indic people is preserved in the Vedic and Purπ an . ic texts. 6 We see Kassites, a somewhat shadowy aristocracy with Indic names and worshiping Sπ urya and the Maruts, in Western Iran about 1800 BC. They captured power in Babylon in 1600 BC, which they were to rule for over 500 years. The Mitanni, another group that originated thus, ruled northern Mesopotamia (including Syria) for about 300 years, starting 1600 BC, out of their capital of Vasukhπ ani. (For Mitanni names, I give standard Sanskrit spellings rather than the form that we Ønd in inscriptions in the inadequate cuneiform script, such as Wassukkani for Vasukhπ ani, \\a mine of wealth\".) Their warriors were called marya , which is the proper Sanskrit term for it. In a treaty between the Hittites and the Mitanni, Indic deities Mitra, Varun . a, Indra, and Nπ asatya (A∂ svins) are invoked. A text by a Mitannian named Kikkuli uses words such as aika ( eka , one), tera ( tri , three), panza ( panca , Øve), satta ( sapta , seven), na ( nava ,nine),vartana( vartana , round). Another text has babru ( babhru , brown), parita ( palita , grey), and pinkara ( pi_ ngala , red). Their chief festival was the celebration of vi∂ suva (solstice) very much like in India. It is not only the kings who had Sanskrit names; 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"a large number of other Sanskrit names have been unearthed in the records from the area. Documents and contract agreements in Syria mention a warrior caste that constituted the elite in the cities. The ownership of land appears to have been inalienable. Consequently, no documents on the selling of landed property are to be found in the great archives of Akkadian documents and letters discovered in Nuzi. The prohibition against selling landed property was dodged with the stratagem of \"adopting\" a willing buyer against an appropriate sum of money. Information of the mythology of the Hurrians of the Mitanni is known from related Hittite and Ugaritic myths. The king of the gods was the weather god Teshub who had violently deposed Kumarbi paralleling the killing of Vr . tra by Indra. Major sanctuaries of Teshub were located at Arrap- kha (modern Kirkuk) and at Halab (modern Aleppo) in Syria. Like Indra, Teshub also had a solar aspect. In the east his consort was the goddess of love and war Shaushka (Venus), and in the west the goddess Hebat (Hepat). In addition, a considerable importance was attributed to impersonal gods such as heaven and earth as well as to deities of mountains and rivers. Temple monuments of modest dimensions have been unearthed. The general Indic in∞uence in the area may also be seen in the comprehen- siveness of the god lists. The most \\o±cial\" god list, in two Ugaritic copies and one Akkadian translation, consists of 33 items, 7 exactly as is true of the count of Vedic gods. These gods are categorized into three classes, some- what like the three classes of the Vedic gods, although there are diÆerence in details. Greek accounts tell us that the Ugaritic believed in a cosmic egg out of which the earth emerged which is reminiscent of brahmπ an . n . a of the Vedic view. How do we know that the Mitanni were Indic and not Iranian? There are several reasons, but to be brief, I shall only give three: 1. the deities Indra, Mitra, Varun . a, and Nπ asatya are Indian deities and not Iranian ones, because in Iran Varun . a is unknown and Indra and Nπ asatya appear as demons; 2. the name Vasukhπ ani makes sense in Sanskrit as a \\mine of wealth\" whereas in Iranian it means \\good mine\" which is much less likely; 3. satta, or sapta, for seven, rather than the Iranian word hapta, where the initial `s' has been 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"changed to `h'. Why could not the Mitanni be the descendents of a pre-Vedic people as in the Gimbutas model 8 of the spread of the Indo-Iranian people from the Kurgan culture of the steppes of Central Asia? They would then have had no particular a±nity for Indic deities. If the pre-Vedic people in Central Asia already had Indin deities, how would these small bands of people impose their culture and language over what was perhaps the most densely populated region of the ancient world. Furthermore, that view does not square with our knowledge of the astronomical tradition within India. The Vedic Sam . hitπ as have very early astronomical and its geography is squarely within India. The Vedπ a_ nga Jyotis . a, a late Vedic text, already belongs to the middle of the second millennium BC. The earlier texts remember events within the Indic geographical area going back to the third and the fourth millennia BC. 9 The theory of a proto-Indoaryan people in Iran from whom the Aryans of India descended 10 in the second millennium BC does not work for the same reasons. The idea of invasion or large-scale immigration of outsiders into India displacing the original population in the middle of the second millennium BC has been rejected since it is not in accord with archaeological facts, skeletal records, and the continuity of the cultural tradition. 11 In a recent synthesis 12 , it was concluded that \\there is no archaeological or biological evidence for invasions or mass migrations into the Indus Valley between the end of the Harappan Phase, about 1900 BC and the beginning of the Early Historic period around 600 BC.\" Other scholars see no break in the cultural tradition between 4500 BC and 600 BC. The Indian textual tradition also does not permit us to accept the Gimbu- tas model because of the length of time required for the rise of the voluminous Indian literature. 13 Pπ an . ini already in the 500 BC knows 14 of the Bhπ arata and the Mahπ abhπ arata in one of his sπ utras (6.2.38). This means that the epic was substantially complete by 500 BC, although it may have undergone further modiØcations and interpolations in subsequent centuries. The evidence of the sπ utra by Pπ an . ini seems to have escaped most historians although V.S. Agrawala did call attention to it decades ago. 15 The Mahπ abhπ arata tradition itself acknowledges that the text was origi- nally 8,800 verses, composed by Kr . s . n . aDvaipπ ayan . aVyπ asa, when it was still called Jaya. Later, it was enlarged to 24,000 verses and came to be called 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Bhπ arata. It was transmitted by Vyπ asa to Vai∂ sampπ ayan . a and Ønally recited by Ugra∂ sravas as the familiar Mahπ abhπ arata of the 100,000 verses; the two latter bards appear thus to be responsible for its enlargements. Since the enlargements of the Mahπ abhπ arata are likely to have stretched over several centuries, it is unlikely that the text would not remember the migrations out of Central Asia as is required in the Gimbutas model. 16 Furthermore, the astronomical references 17 related to the A∂ svamedha rite in the Mahπ abhπ arata point to its extreme antiquity going back to the 4th millennium BC, which cannot be squared with the Gimbutas model. Indic Names in West Asia Over Øfty years ago, Roger T. O'Callaghan and W.F. Albright published in Analecta Orientalia of Rome a list of 81 names (13 from the Mitanni, 23 from the Nuzi, and 45 from the Syrian documents) with Indic etymologies. Out of this list, Dumont provided the etymology of 45 names in the much more readily available Journal of the American Oriental Society of 1947. 18 Afew of these names with the Sanskrit cognates in parentheses are: Abirata (Abhirata, pleased, contented) Aitagama (Etagama, with the gait of an antelope) Aitara (the son of Itarπ a) Artamanyu (R . tamanyu, revering the divine Law) Ardzawπ ≥ya ( π Arjavπ ≥ya, straight, honest) Bπ ≥rasπ ena (Vπ ≥rasena, possessing an army of heroes) Biridπ a∑ swa (Br . hada∂ sva, possessing great horse) Barda∑ swa (Vπ arddhπ a∂ sva, the son of Vr . ddhπ a∂ sva) Bπ ayawa (Vπ ayava, the son of Vπ ayu) Bπ ≥rya∑ sura (Vπ ≥rya∂ sπ ura, the hero of valour) 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Bπ ≥ryawπ adza (Vπ ≥ryavπ aja, owning the prize of valour) Bπ ≥ryasauma (Vπ ≥ryasoma, the moon-god of valour) Bπ ≥rya (Vπ ≥rya, valour) Indarota (Indrota, upheld by Indra) Kalma∑ sπ ura (Karma∂ sπ ura, the hero of action) Purdπ aya (Purudπ aya, giving much) Ru∑ cmanya (Rucimanya, revering light) Satuara (Satvara, swift) ∑ Saima∑ sπ ura (Ks . ema∂ sπ ura, the hero of security) Subandu (Subandhu, being good kinsmen) Sumπ ala (having beautiful garlands) Sumπ ≥da (Sumπ ≥d . ha, bountiful) Swardπ ata (Svardπ ata, given by heaven) Tsitriyara (Citrya-rai, having distinguished property) Urudπ ≥ti (Urudπ ≥ti, having wide splendour) Warasama (Varasama, equal to the best) Wπ asasatta (Vπ asasπ apta, possessing seven dwellings) Wasdπ ata (Vasudπ ata, given by the Vasus) Yamiuta (Yamyπ uta, favoured by Yamin) 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Analyzing the names, Dumont concludes that the names are clearly Indic and not Iranian. The initial s is maintained and the group ∂ sv is represented by the similar sounding ∑ sw and not the Avestan aspπ o . Also, most of the names are bahuvrπ ≥hi or tatpurus . a compounds. Considering the language, it is clearly an Indic dialect because the initial v is replaced by b , while medial v becomes the semivowel w . Like Middle Indic (Prakrit) dialects, the medial pt transforms into tt , as in sapta becoming satta. Dumont stresses its relationship to Sanskrit in the characteristic patronymic names with the vr . ddhi-strengthening of the Ørst syllable, like in Saumati (the son of Sumati) or Saus . apti (the son of Sus . apti). The worship of the Vedic gods like Indra, Vπ ayu, Svar, Soma, R . ta, Vasus has already been noted. The fact the the Mitanni names suggest a Middle Indic dialect is support- ive of the thesis that the emigration of the various groups from India took place after the early Vedic period had come to an end. Vedic Religion in West Asia Our argument actually goes beyond the presence of people in West Asia whose languages were Indic, as was the case with the Mitanni. There is evidence that Indic religion and culture had adherents even outside of groups with Indic speech. The Avesta speaks of the struggle between the worshipers of Ahura Mazdπ a and the daevas . This opposition in the Zoroastrian texts is expressed as one between the Mazdayasnas and the Daπ evayasnas. It is a con∞ict in which Zoroaster wished to defeat and convert the worshipers of the daπ eva religion. The Ya∑ sts speak of legendary heroes and kings who participated in this strug- gle. The wars against the Daπ evayasnas by Vi∑ stπ aspa (Yt. 5.109, 113; 9.30-31), Jπ amπ aspa (Yt. 5.68-70), and Vistaru of the Naotara family (Yt. 5.76-77) rep- resent this ongoing con∞ict in the historical period. 19 In the Vendidad, the Zoroastrians are encouraged to take possession of the lands, waters, and harvests of the daπ eva worshipers (Vd. 19.26). Elsewhere (Vd. 7.36-40), it is recommended that the art of medicine should be Ørst tried on the daπ eva-worshipers and if they survive then it should be attempted on the Mazdayasnians. 20 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Although the Zoroastrian heresy triumphed in Iran and the great Per- sian kings of the middle of Ørst millennium BC followed the religion of Ahura Mazdπ a, the daπ eva worshipers survived, especially in the West, in the Mesopotamian religion. Whether Zarathu∑ stra belonged to the second millennium BC or later, 21 it is clear that the Vedic gods survived for a pretty long time in corners of Iran. The evidence of the survival of the Vedic gods from the daiva- inscription of Xerxes (ruled 486-465 BC). The revolt by the daπ eva worshipers in West Iran is directly referred to: Proclaims Xerxes the King: When I became king, there is among these countries one which was in rebellion. Afterwards Ahura- mazda bore me aid. By the favor of Ahuramazda I smote that country and put it down in its place. And among these countries there was a place where previously daiva were worshiped. Afterwards, by the favor of Ahuramazda I destroyed that sanctuary of daiva , and I made proclamation: 'The daiva shall not be worshiped!' Where previously the daiva were worshiped, there I worshiped Ahuramazda at the proper time and in the proper manner. And there was other business that had been done ill. That I made good. That which I did, all I did by the favor of Ahuramazda. Ahuramazda bore me aid until I completed the work. The analysis of early Persian history has shown that the Mπ azandarπ an, the region south of the Caspian sea and the Alburz mountain range, remained for long a centre of daπ eva worship. It has been suggested that the Xerxes inscription refers to the suppression of these people. Burrow takes the daπ eva worshiping people to be proto-Indoaryans and sees them as the remnants of a population that stretched from West Asia to India. The Iranians coming down from the northeast drove a wedge between this belt, leading to the eventual assimilation of the western daπ eva worshipers in the course of centuries. Irrespective of what the original movement of the Indoaryans was before the fourth or Øfth millennium BC, it is clear that since their Indian branch recognizes the geography of only their region, it is either necessary to push 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"back the proto-Indoaryan phase to the fourth or the Øfth millennium BC or to postulate their movement out of India as is suggested in the Purπ an . as. Akhenaten's Rule Akhenaten (\\glory of the Aten\") ascended the throne as Amenhotep (\\Amun is content\") IV but he changed his name to honour Aten (\\One god\" repre- sented as the solar disk) in his sixth regnal year. Aten is the deiØcation of the disk of the sun god, Ra, who was also represented by the eye. Akhenaten moved his capital from Thebes to Akhetaten (\\Horizon of Aten\"), now known as Amarna, where palaces and buildings were built from mud brick, and in which he built a splendid temple to Aten Ølled with reli- gious art. After his father's death, he built temples on the perimeter of the famous Temple of Amun at Karnak and dedicated them to Aten, rather than Amun (\\the Hidden One\", the principal deity at the time, also known as Amen). He erased the names of other gods, particularly Amun, and he also erased his father's name wherever he found it. Some argue that Akhenaten introduced monotheism by the banishment of all deities excepting his chosen one. He has been seen as a precursor to the Old Testament prophets, and thus to the Abrahamic religions. 22 But it is equally plausible that he was in∞uenced by the belief in \\One Truth\" behind appearances of the Vedic system through the three generations of queens in his family from the Mitannis. The importance of the Vedic element appears to be re∞ected in the mys- ticism of the Egyptian Book of the Dead (from 1600 BC on). Nevertheless, the cult of the dead and resurrection remained the most important element of the Egyptian religion. This cult continues to form the cornerstone of the three Abrahamic faiths. Akhenaten was succeeded by Smenkhkara, believed by some to be Ne- fertiti herself, and soon afterwards by Tutankhaten, Akhenaten's son by Tadukhipa (Kiya) under the regentship of Ay. Akhenaten was a fanatic and the country had suÆered a great deal during his reign. The nobles now reversed course. Tutankhaten changed his name to Tutankhamen (to invoke Amun), but before he could consolidate power he was dead at the age of 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"sixteen after a rule of just nine years. His tomb was discovered intact in 1922, and now he is widely known as the Boy-King. Tutankhamen was followed by Ay, Nefertiti's father, who ruled for four years. He, in turn, was followed by the general Horemheb, who now erased all records of Akhenaten, and his successors. The new city was abandoned, and worship of the Amun was reestablished. Akhenaten's disappeared from Egyptian history, and he was referred to as \\that heretic\" or \\rebel\", until the reconstruction of the history in modern times. Yet, his idea of a jealous god lived on, and prospered. Letters, Religion, and the End of Tushratta The context to the Amarna correspondence, in which there are letters be- tween the Egyptian, Mitanni, and other neighbouring kings, is provided in the book edited by Cohen and Westbrook. 23 These diplomatic letters, to- talling nearly 400, were written in a space of about thirty-Øve years from about 1370 to 1335, from the end of the reign of Amenhotep III to the death of Tutankhamen. The texts were written in a dialect known as Western Pe- ripheral Akkadian which was the lingua franca of the Near East, though one letter from Tushratta, is written in Hurrian. Here is an extract from a letter by Tushratta to Amenhotep III, Akhen- aten's father: \\My father loved you, and you loved my father still more. And my father, because of his love, has given my sister to you... Behold, one chariot, two horses, one male servant, out of the booty from the land of Hatti I have sent you. And as a gift for my brother, Øve chariots and Øve teams of horses I have sent you. And as a gift for Gilukhipa, my sister, one set of gold pins, one set of gold earrings, one gold idol, and one container of sweet oil I have sent her.\" Another letter accompanies the image of goddess of Shaushka of Nineveh (Ishtar), Tushratta's is . t . a-devπ ≥ , sent to Amenhotep III to restore him to health during illness. Ishtar is Venus, and the Vena hymn of the Rigveda (10.123) anticipates her Mesopotamian mythology. 24 A message of greetings from Tushratta to Akhenaten: \\To Napkhuria (Akhenaten), king of Egypt, my brother, my son-in-law, who loves me and whom I love, thus speaks Tushratta, king of Mitanni, your father-in-law who loves you, your brother. I am well. May you be well too. Your houses, Tiye 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"your mother, Lady of Egypt, Tadukhipa, my daughter, your wife, your other wives, your sons, your noblemen, your chariots, your horses, your soldiers, your country and everything belonging to you, may they all enjoy excellent health.\" The Vedic presence via the Mitanni in Egypt and West Asia occurs several centuries before the exodus of the Jews. This presence is sure to have left its mark in various customs, traditions, and beliefs. Small Indic groups remained in the general area for centuries after the disappearance of the Mitanni. Thus Sargon defeats one Bagdatti of Ui∑ sdi∑ s in 716 BC. The name Bagdatti (Skt. Bhagadatta) is Indic and cannot be Iranian because of the double `t'. It may be that the continuing encounter between Indic and West Asian groups explains some parallels in mythology and ritual, such as worship of the goddess, circumambulation around a rock or the use of a rosary of 108 beads. 25 These practices are easily understandable within the Vedic system, whereas they are remembered as commandments to be believed without un- derstanding in the Western faiths. This encounter was facilitated by the trade that continued between these two regions of Asia. There is ample evidence for this trade during the Harap- pan period and earlier. Harappan objects have been found in numerous places in West Asia. Weights of the highly accurate Harappan system, which was diÆerent from the one in use in Mesopotamia, have been found in Dilmun in West Asia. 26 It is likely that such trade continued in the second and Ørst millennia BC. In the Amarna Letters, the correspondents are from Egypt, Mitanni, Babylonia, Hatti, and Assyria. Mitanni was also called Hanigalbat and Na- harin; Babylonia is also named Karaduniyash or Shanhar; Hatti (of the Hit- tites) was sometimes named after its capital of Hattusha. In the Letters, Amenhotep III is called Mimmureya or Nimu'wareya or Nibmureya, while Akhenaten is also called Naphurureya. The Hittite king Suppiluliumas launched a surprise attack on the Mi- tanni kingdom. In the course of his victorious march, Mitanni began to crumble and Tushratta was assassinated. His son ∞ed through various lands, returning at long last to Vasukhπ ani as a vassal. Mitanni as an independent kingdom ceased to exist. As the vassal of the Hittites, the rump state was called Hanigalbat. Soon afterward, however, it was captured by the Assyrian 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Adad-nirari I (probably during the reign of Horemheb) and later by Shal- maneser I (during the reign of Ramesses II), at which time the area east of the Euphrates was turned into an Assyrian province. Hymns to the Sun/Yahweh I shall now present a partial translation of the Great Hymn to the Aten , 27 attributed to Akhenaten, from the Amarna tomb of Ay. This hymn is one of the most important early markers of the Western monotheistic tradition because of the manner in which it presents the Sun as the master and lord of human destiny. According to most biblical scholars, Psalm 104 of the Old Testament to Yahweh is derived from this hymn. To see the continuity with the R . gveda it may be noted that Yahv∂ ah . is a Vedic epithet associated with movement, activity, heaven and earth; it means the sacriØcer and Agni, the chief terrestrial god. 28 Yahv∂ ah . as an epithet occurs 21 times in the R . gveda. It may be compared to ∂ Sivah . , an epithet for auspiciousness in the R . gveda that later is applied regularly to Rudra.

The relationship of this hymn to Psalm 104 of the Old Testament becomes striking when \\Lord\" of the King James version is changed into the proper \\Yahweh\". There is mention in both of the absolute power over the life of animals and man, of the providing of natural bounties, and the responsibility 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"over personal destiny. It is also signiØcant that the Sun is also supposed to be in the poet's heart. It should be remembered that Yahweh assimilated the characteristics and epithets of previous gods of the region. For example, El was the chief god at Ugarit. Yet El is also the name used in many of the Psalms for Yahweh. In 2 Kings 22:19-22 we read of Yahweh meeting with his heavenly council. The Ugaritic texts have a similar account, with the diÆerence that the \\sons of god\" are the sons of El. Other deities worshipped at Ugarit were El Shaddai, El Elyon, and El Berith. Since all these names are applied to Yahweh by the writers of the Old Testament, it means that the Hebrew theologians assimilated the earlier mythology into their system. Besides the chief god at Ugarit there were also lesser gods and goddesses. The most important of these lesser gods were Baal, the goddess Asherah, Yam (the god of the sea) and Mot (the god of death). It is interesting that Yam and Mot are the Hebrew words for sea and death, respectively. It is less well-known that Yam may be connected to the Vedic Yama who in RV 10.10.4 is seen as being born from the waters, and Mot to the Vedic Mr . tyu, death. We have mentioned the Vedic Yahv∂ ah . before; one may also note that Il . ∂ a represents Agni as in Yajurveda (VS) 2.3; ∂ Ilπ a represents Earth, speech, and ∞ow. These parallels indicate a shared history and these names may have entered the Ugaritic religion through the Mitannis. The idea of the goddess was central to the West Asian people until the end of the Ørst millennium BC. Asherah, a very important character in the Old Testament, is called the wife of Baal, although she is also known as the consort of Yahweh. Inscriptions found at Kuntillet `Ajrud (dated between 850 and 750 BC) say: \\I bless you through Yahweh of Samaria, and through his Asherah!\" And at `El Qom (from the same period) this inscription: \\Uriyahu, the king, has written this. Blessed be Uriyahu through Yahweh, and his enemies have been conquered through Yahweh's Asherah.\" The Elephantine Papyri inform us that the Hebrews worshiped Asherah until the 3rd century BC. Baal's name occurs frequently in the Old Testament. Some Israelites viewed Yahweh as a God of the desert and so when they arrived in Phoenicia they thought it only proper to adopt Baal, the god of fertility. One of the 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"central Ugaritic myths was the story of Baal's enthronement as king. In this story, Baal is killed by Mot (in the Fall of the year) and he remains dead until the Spring of the year. His victory over death was celebrated as his enthronement over the other gods. The Old Testament also celebrates the enthronement of Yahweh. As in the Ugaritic myth, the purpose of Yahweh's enthronement is to re-enact creation. That is, Yahweh overcomes death by his recurring creative acts. The major diÆerence between the Ugaritic myth and the Biblical hymns is that Yahweh's kingship is eternal and uninterrupted while Baal's is inter- rupted every year by his death. Since Baal is the god of fertility the meaning of this myth is quite easy to understand. He dies with the vegetation and he is reborn with it. Christianity took an element from Baal's death and made it a singular event. When one reads the Psalms and the Ugaritic texts one Ønds that Yahweh is acclaimed for things previously associated with El. These Psalms appear to have been originally Ugaritic or Phoenician hymns to El which were adopted by the Jews. El is called the \\father of men,\" \\creator,\" and \\creator of the creation,\" attributes also granted Yahweh by the Old Testament. This discussion tells us how the hymns of the second millennium BC became a part of the Old Testament and thus can be close the older texts in style and form, even though the language may have changed. Psalm 104, Old Testament Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a ∞aming Øre: 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Who laid the foundation of the earth, that it should not be re- moved for ever.

Here, we list just a few. \\When you set in the western horizon. earth falls into a deathly darkness... Every lion comes forth from its lair, the serpents sting.\" (Hymn to Aten, stanzas 2-3). \\Thou makest darkness, that it is night; wherein all beasts of the forest do creep forth. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from god.\" (Psalm 104: 20-21) \\Your works are manifold, though hidden from sight, O One God, beside whom there is no other. You created the world as you wished, you alone.\" (Hymn to Aten) \\O Yahweh, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.\" (Psalm 104: 24) In 1937, Freud published his essay, Moses and Monotheism , in the journal Imago 29 proposing that the biblical Øgure of Moses was an Egyptian linked to the court of Akhenaten. Freud provided much stimulating evidence to support his argument, including the fact that the Jewish word for \\Lord\", \\Adonai\", becomes \\Aten\" when its letters are written in Egyptian. The other details of Freud's reconstruction are disputed but they are signiØcant for estimating the importance of the Egyptian ideas within the Judeo-Christian tradition. According to Freud, Moses was a believer in the monotheism associated with Aten, but with the death of Akhenaten the suc- cessor Pharaohs reverted to their old religion. Moses (from mose ,Egyptian for \\child\") now went to exile as the head of an oppressed Semitic tribe and in order to set these people apart, he introduced the Egyptian custom of cir- cumcision. His unruly followers killed Moses, and the tribesmen now adopted the volcanic deity, Yahweh of another tribe, as their national god. Yahweh was now endowed with the universal and spiritual qualities of the Moses's god, though the memory of Moses's murder remained repressed amongst the Jews, reemerging in a very disguised form with the rise of Christianity. There is general agreement that Moses - who is said to have lived a staggering 120 years - was a composite character created out of the faded 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"memories of a variety of diÆerent individuals, some Hebrews, others Egyptian in origin. The Egyptian component included the memory of Akhenaten's worship of the single god in the sky. According to Freud, the death of Moses became central to the experience of the Jews and it deØned the structure of Christianity as well. Says Freud: 30 \\Original sin and salvation through sacriØcial death became the basis of the new religion founded by Paul. After the Christian doctrine had brust the conØnes of Judaism, it absorbed constituents from many other sources, re- nounced many features of pure monotheism, and adopted in many particulars the ritual of the other Mediterranean peoples. It was as if Egypt had come to wreak her vengeance on the heirs of Ikhnaton [Akhenaten]. The way in which the new religion came to terms with the ancient ambivalency in the father-son relationship is noteworthy. Its main doctrine, to be sure, was the reconciliation with God the Father, the expiation of the crime committed against him; but the other side of the relationship manifested itself in the Son, who had taken the guilt on his shoulders, becoming God himself beside the Father and in truth in place of the Father.\" Sπ urya in the Vedas The Rigvedic hymns 1.50, 4.13, 10.37, all addressed to Sπ urya provide fasci- nating counterpoint and parallels to the Aten hymn and Psalm 104. These parallels include viewing the Sun as superintending each creature's welfare. For example, RV 1.50.6 says: \\You keep strict watch upon the man who moves among the peoples.\" In contrast, the Atharvavedic Sun hymns of Book 13 are strictly solar. The eye of Sπ urya is mentioned and he is himself called the eye of Mitra, Varun . a and Agni as in RV 1.115. Although, hymns to the Sun from independent sources can be expected to have inevitable parallels relating to the motion in the sky and the warmth that it oÆers, the idea of the Sun superintending individual lives is surprising enough to have had the same source. It is also noteworthy that in the Vedic view the universe has a tripartite division and the objective of human life is to reach the heaven, which is equated with the Sun. The representation of the Sun is in the form of a disk. 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Vedic Hymns to the Sun For the sake of easy comparison, I reproduce RV 10.37 in R. Panikkar's translation. 31 Homage to the Eye of Mitra and Varun . a! To the mighty God oÆer this worship to the farseeing emblem, born of the Gods. Sing praise to the Sun, the oÆspring of Heaven. [1] May this word of Truth guard me on all sides, while earth and heaven and days endure. To its rest goes all else that moves, but never do the waters cease ∞owing or the sun rising. [2] From ancient days no godless man obstructs your path when you drive the winged sun-horse. Your one dark side is turned eastward; with the other the light-Ølled side, you arise, O Sun. [3] By your light, O Sun, which scatters gloom, by your rays which arouse the whole creation, dispel from our hearts all languor, all neglect of worship, all grief and evil dreams. [4] Sent forth as an envoy upon your course, you superintend each creature's welfare, rising with calm unvarying. May the Gods grant us to achieve your goal today! [5] This prayer of ours may Heaven and Earth, the Waters, Indra, and the Maruts heed! May we never be deprived of the Sun's shining, may we attain old age in happiness!

[7] O farseeing Sun, the bearer of Light, the joy of every single eye, may we live to see your glorious radiance ∞ooding in as you ascend on high! [8] You shine, all living things emerge. You disappear, they go to rest. Recognizing your innocence, O golden-haired Sun, arise; let each day be better than the last. [9] Bless us by your gaze, your brightness and shining. Bless us in cold and in heat, O Sun, grant us blessings at home and, when we are traveling, bestow upon us your wonderful treasure. [10] Protect both our species, two-legged and four-legged. Both food and water for their needs supply. May they with us increase in stature and strength. Save us from hurt all our days, O Powers. [11] Whatever grave oÆense we have committed against you, by our tongue, O God, or by carelessness of mind, lay the burden of this sin on the one who plans evil, on him, O Vasus, who wishes us ill. [12] It is clear from this hymn that Sπ urya is not only the outer Sun, but also the source of life and warmth and the overseer of the individual's personal life. This latter conception is Sun as Lord who resides within the individual. In the Vedic view, the inner Sun is π atmanwhoisthesameasBrahman,asin the Upanis . adic ayam π atma brahma. The double reference to the inner Sun 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"is clear in R . gveda 1.50 where it is stated: \\O Sun, maker of the Light, who illumine all the radiant sky. You shine upon the host of Gods and likewise on the race of men, that all may see the heavenly Light.\" The similarities between these three important compositions are striking. The imagery has many parallels. The Lord or the Sun is not only a distant object that provides light and warmth with ceaseless punctuality, it also rules our individual destinies. The Sun is in the sky and also within the heart. Another interesting R . gvedic hymn describing Sπ urya is 7.63. Here it is in the Gri±th translation: 32 Common to all mankind, auspicious Sπ urya, he who beholdeth all, is mounting upward; The God, the eye of Varun . a and Mitra, who rolled up darkness like a piece of leather. [1] Sπ urya's great ensign, restless as the billow, that urgeth men to action, is advancing: Onward he still would roll the wheel well- rounded, which Etas . a, harnessed to the car-pole, moveth. [2] Refulgent from the bosom of the Mornings, he in Whom singers take delight ascendeth. This Savitar, God, is my chief joy and pleasure, who breaketh not the universal statute. [3] Golden, far-seeing, from the heaven he riseth: far is his goal, he hasteth on resplendent. Men, verily, inspirited by Sπ urya speed to their aims and do the work assigned them. [4] Where the immortals have prepared his pathway he ∞ieth through the region like a falcon. With homage and oblations will we serve you, O Mitra-Varun . a, when the Sun hath risen. [5] Now Mitra, Varun . a, Aryaman vouchsafe us freedom and room, for us and for our children. May we Ønd paths all fair and good to travel. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings. [6] 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Some hymns to the π Adityas stress the conception of personal overlordship even further. For example, AV 4.16 speaks thus: The mighty overseer on high espies our deeds, as if he were quite close at hand. The Gods through him know all men do.. [1] ...Two men may hatch a plot together; Varun . a knows it all, being present as the third one. [2] Varun . acontains within his body both the oceans, and yet he also is contained within one droplet. [3] Seize and bind with a hundred cords, OVarun . a, the one who utters falsehood...[7] Varun . a is the warp of the loom, Varun . a is the woof of the loom of this universe. Varun . a is of us, Varun . a is foreign, Varun . a is divine, he is also human, Varun . a the King. [8] It is also notable that the Sun was represented as a golden disk (rukma) with a golden image of the purus . a on it in the Agnicayana ritual which forms a large part of the Yajurveda. This was the period when the Vedic religion did not have monumental images of divinity. It is not impossible that the poetic imagery associated with the Sun in the Sπ urya and the Aten hymns was conceived independently, but it is unlikely. The idea of the Sun somehow appearing within the heart of the individual is a revolutionary one, and since we do know of the presence of a people (the Mitanni) who believed in the Vedic pantheon together with its sophisticated understanding of the inner world, it is more likely that the genetic relationship of the idea is as follows: R . gvedic Sπ urya ) Aten ) Yahweh of Psalm 104 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"We are not suggesting here that the R . gveda as it has come down to us was carried to the West Asia by the Mitannis, although that cannot be ruled out; rather that hymns with similar themes must have been a part of the Mitanni culture as they went westwards from India. During this passage to and sojourn in West Asia, their religion is bound to have been aÆected by the local beliefs. The worship of Ishtar points to a Babylonian gloss over their original Vedic system. It is clear that all aspects of the Vedic conception of Sπ urya could not be a part of the idea of Aten. In the Indic view, cosmic law ( r . ta )anda personal God are intertwined together through the mystery of sacriØce. In the later ampliØcation of the Vedic ideas, Purus . a is apart and the unfolding is a consequence of the law acting through Prakr . ti. In the Aten hymn the idea of personal God is the predominant one although it is clear that the cosmic law is also implied. The hymn appears perfectly consonant with the conception of Sπ urya. Nevertheless, from Akhenaten's banishing of other gods in his rule suggests that he was inspired by an incomplete idea. It is possible that the parallels between Sπ urya and Aten are entirely coin- cidental due to the similarities between the Egyptian and Vedic conceptions about the universe and divinity. The pre-Akhenaten religion had a spiritual basis and the Egyptians formed several syncretisms between the sungod Re and other gods, resulting in such names as Re-Harakhty, Amon-Re, Sebek- Re, and Khnum-Re. The Vedic gods, being projections of the One Divinity, also are combined together. But there was one distinct diÆerence of em- phasis between the Vedic system where the gods were more heard than seen whereas in Egypt system their representation in images was the predominant expression. If the seen was accorded the most signiØcance in Egypt; in India, the heard (∂ sruti) was likewise supreme. The conceptions of paradise were diÆerent. In Egypt, the body was raised to it upon death; in India, the body in paradise was a subtle golden body, unconnected to the life on earth. The diÆerence was, no doubt, due to a diÆerence in the underlying cosmologies of the two cultures. It was re∞ected in the diÆerent funerary practices in the two regions. Given the matrimonial alliance across several generations between the \\Vedic\" Mitanni (whose fondness for monumental representation of gods must have been limited) and the Pharaohs, it is plausible that many elites 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"in the court had become favourable to the Mitanni religion. This is likely to have made it possible for Akhenaten, early in his reign soon after his mar- riage to the Mitanni princess Kiya, to declare his religion, which had much similarity to the Mitanni. This also explains why, after his death, the religion, being of foreign origin and popular only with a minority, was suppressed violently and successfully. Conclusions There are important lessons to be drawn from the study of Akhenaten and his hymn to Aten. Scholars see in Akhenaten the beginning of the Judaic monotheistic tradition. Our examination of the facts shows that it might, equally plausibly, be a retelling of the improperly understood ideas, or ideas modiØed by the prevailing ones in their new land, in the journey to West Asia by the Mitannis. We are basing our conclusions not only on the connection to the Mitanni through Akhenaten's wife but also on the pervasiveness of the Vedic concepts in West Asia as in the notion of 33 gods, the use of the disk to represent the sun exactly as is done in Vedic ritual, and the conception of the sun who superintends personal destiny which is perhaps the central idea of Vedic thought. We have also alluded to the similarity between the Vedic Yahv∂ ah . and the Hebrew Yahweh and between other gods. These parallels are signØcant enough to demand a thorough investigation of the 2nd millennium BC connections between India and the West. The interaction between the Indic (Mitanni and other groups) and the Egyptian and West Asian can help us in understanding the evolution of the Western religions. It may also helps us understand the parallels between Indic and Babylonian and Greek sciences. For example, if the early ∂ Satapatha Brπ ahman . a gives centrality to the number 432,000 (also the supposed number of syllables in the R . gveda) then one can understand how this may have been adopted by the Babylonians as a count for their Great Year. Both India and Babylon divide the civil year into 360 equal parts. This is seen in India in the R . gveda itself and in Babylon in the middle of the Ørst millennium BC. Likewise, it may help us understand the Babylonian adoption of the idea of tithi of Indian astronomy which is mentioned in the R . gvedic Brπ ahman . as. An interesting question related to the spectrum of religious belief rang- 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"ing from India to Egypt is the split between the Vedic and the Zoroastrian religion. The Zarathustrian demonization of Indra and the Nπ asatyas was a rejection of the interiorization of divinity since Indra is the lord of the senses and the Nπ asatyas are the rulers of hearing. In the Vedic system elements of materiality and divinity are in a hierarchical system: the physical body (ruled by the Asura) comes Ørst and the spiritual body (ruled by Indra, the senses) comes later which is why the Devas are younger to the Asuras. 33 Zarathu∑ stra's innovation was to create a system that was midway between the Vedic with its emphasis on the spirit and the West Asian/Egyptian which is body-centered (with its visions of being raised to life in one's body in par- adise). But the system brought in the devas through the backdoor as the yazatas (Skt. yajata ). It is also possible to see Zarathu∑ stra as providing a synthesis in terms of just two categories as was done in a diÆerent way in the Purπ an . as. The Vedic view is to see the world in triple categories. Later Purπ an . ic gloss simpli- Øed this into dichotomies like that of deva versus asura (including rπ aks . asa). Zarathu∑ stra made a similar simpliØcation using the dichotomy of asura (in- cluding deva under the label yazata) and daeva. The asuras are the ground on which the devas emerge; likewise, without proper action one can slip into the false path. The term daeva as a synonym for rπ aks . asa survives in Kashmir. Within the Indo-Iranaian world, the memory of India's interaction with Egypt persisted. In Chapter 48 of his book on India 34 written in 1030, al- Bπ ≥rπ unπ ≥, speaking of chariots of war, mentions the Greek claim that they were the Ørst to use them and insists they are wrong because \\they were already invented by Aphrodisios the Hindu, when he ruled over Egypt, about 900 years after the deluge.\" This reference cannot be taken to be literally true but it is, nevertheless, signiØcant. It preserves the memory of a \\Hindu\" (Indic-inspired) king of Egypt prior to the Greek state. The reference to the chariots of war of this king (Akhenaten) seems to remember the foreigner warlords Hyskos who ruled Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period just before the New Kingdom to which Akhenaten belonged. 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Notes 1.
