The siege, which must have lasted many years, was interrupted by the rebellion of some disaffected noble in Upper Egypt; but the city was finally captured, and the Hyksos, fleeing into Asia, were pursued to the city of Sharuhen (Josh. 19:6). Here they were besieged for six years by Ahmose I, and this stronghold was also captured. It was probably at the conclusion of this siege that Ahmose I pushed northward and invaded Syria, as narrated by Ahmose-Pen-Nekhbet (5 zo), probably still in pursuit of the last remnants of the Hyksos. 5. The king now returned, and carried his army to the other extreme of his domain, invading Nubia. He was recalled from a successful campaign there, to quell two successive rebellions, the last of the internal dissensions which had distracted the country since the fall of the Middle Kingdom.

Another proof is that m, the preposition here, is used all through the Beknekhonsu inscription (Munich) for \"during\" or \"for\" a period of years. This throws a new light on the whole Asiatic campaign, for the stubbornness of the besieged and the persistence of Ahmose are almost certainly an indication that the siege is an exten- sion of the campaign against the Hyksos, who, having retreated to Shamhen, are here making their last stand.

In any case, he had charge of the \"tribute\" from Wawat, which was later in the hands of the \" king's-son of Kush\" (Q Q 1034 ff.). Although the inscription mentions no king, it clearly belongs to the Eighteenth Dynasty before the first appointment of a \"governor of the south countries, and king's-son of Kush,\" by Thutmose I (0 Q 61 ff.). Hence we are not far wrong in placing it under Amenhotep I, though Harmini must of course have served under Ahmose I, also. 48. After the usual mortuary prayer, the inscription continues, in Harmini's own words: I passed many years as mayor (h'ty-? of Nekhen (Hieraconpolis).

He then built a fortified station for his troops at Tombos, remains of which still survive, and thus estab- lished his southern frontier at this point (cf. 1. IO).~ 3. His empire extended from this point on the south to the Euphrates on the north (cf. 1. 13); the Asiatic peoples are already subdued (cf. 11. 3, 4, and 16), but his Asiatic campaign did not take place until after this Nubian expe- dition (see Q 81, l. 35).

The latter is the more probable supposition. 68.

He first sails the royal transport in the campaign against Nubia (Q 80), resulting in his appointment to the head of the naval forces. They returned in triumph with the Nubian foe hanged head downward at the bow of the royal barge. 79. It was not until after this Nubian campaign that the famous expedition to Naharin set out. Our only sources for this event are the biographies of the two El Kab Ahmoses. Thutmose I11 states that he set up his boundary tablet be- side that of his father (Q478), and it must have been on this campaign that this first boundary tablet was set up by Thutmose I.b For it is always supposed that this cam- paign was the only Asiatic expedition of Thutmose I; but as the Tombos inscription (8 5 67 ff.) speaks of the conquest of Asia as far as the Euphrates, before the Asiatic campaign narrated by the two Ahmoses, we must suppose either that Thutmose I had already made a still earlier campaign in Syria; or that his predecessors, Ahmose I and Amenhotep I, had achieved greater conquests in Asia than our scanty sources for their reigns would indicate.

This pair stood before the pylon (IV) of Thutmose I in the great Karnak temple; the northern obelisk, which Pococke saw still standing, has since fallen. Their erection by Thutmose I is narrated by the chief architect in charge, Ineni (see 8 105). Both Ineni and the standing obelisk refer to \"two great obelisks,\" so that there can be no doubt that Thutmose I erected both.b The work must have been done just before his demission of the crown-an event which left the northern obelisk still uninscribed. It is cer- tainly very significant that it was later inscribed by Thut- mose III! If he did not reach the throne until after the reigns of Thutmose I1 and Hatshepsut, the northern obe- lisk remained uninscribed for some twenty-three years at least! This is improbable, and the fact that the northern obelisk was not usurped by Thutmose I1 or Hatshepsut would indicate that they had no opportunity to do so, be- cause Thutmose 111, having succeeded Thutmose I for a few years, had already taken possession of it himself (see Sethe, Zeitschrift fur agyptische Sprache, 36, 39 f.).

The Karnak hall, which Ineni constructed, is of great historic interest, as it was the first hall on entering the building, and served as the chief hypostyle, or colonnaded hall, of the temple throughout the reign of Thutmose I. It was in this hall that Thutmose I11 was proclaimed king by the priests of Amon ($0 131 ff.), thus putting aside either its builder, Thutmose I, or the weakling Thutmose 11, and in this hall Hatshepsut erected her two great obelisks. The description of the erection of the hall itself is unfortunately lost in the lacuna at the end of 1. 7, and 1. 8 begins with a reference to the \"great pylons on its either side,\" the erection of which follows. But Thutmose I11 informs us of the inter- esting fact that he replaced with stone columns the cedar columns erected by Thutmose I in this hall (8 601). Indeed, Thutmose I himself was obliged to replace the northernmost two of his cedar columns by stone ones before the end of his reign. a The fact is recorded by him on one of the new col-. umns (see Piehl, Actes du 6\"\" congrhs des orientalistes h Leide, 1883, IVm\" partie, section 3, 203-19).

The close of Thutmose 1’s independent reign was followed by years of conflict and strife among the Thut - mosids, in which the parties of Thutmose I (not yet deceased), Thutmose 11, Thutmose 111, and Hatshepsut were all push - ing the claims of their respective candidates for the throne at the same time. As they all succeeded for longer or shorter periods, there is the greatest confusion of royal names on the monuments dating from this period. It seems to the author that Sethe’s explanation of the problem is the first correctly to solve the difficulty. It is the first, and thus far the only, scientific study of the problem employing and reckoning with all the materials. Sethe maintains the fol - lowing propositions: I . The instigator of the insertion of a royal name over another royal name is the king bearing the inserted name; hence 2. The systematic insertion of the names of Thutmose I and Thutmose I1 together, over the name of Hatshepsut on buildings erected by her together with Thutmose 111, shows that Thutmose I and I1 reigned €or a short time together, after the joint reign of Hatshepsut and Thutmose I11 had begun. 3. The earliest monuments of Thutmose I11 show that he at first reigned alone, Hatshepsut being called merely “ great Kirtg’s-wife,” until she later became king coregent with him. 129.

Thutmose 111, with Hatshepsut now associated with him permanently, holds the throne, and they rule together at least twelve years more, till the death of the queen, when Thutmose I11 finally holds undivided possession.

It will be seen that in this readjustment of the reigns practically all of the reign of Thutmose I falls before, and the bulk of Thutmose 111’s reign after, the period of the family conflict; while the reign of Thutmose I1 falls in the midst of this period of conflict that lies between. Hence the old numbering of these three kings need not be changed, and for this reason also their inscriptions are taken up in the old order.

In the course of these reminiscences, the king in one phrase only (1. 3) compares himself to the youthful Horus in the Delta marshes. This very common comparison of the king with Horusa in the Delta, together with the following con- text,b was misunderstood by Brugsch as literal.“ This error was exposed by Masperod in 1880, and since then the inscription was left for twenty years untouched, as if its significance and content had been finally settled.

The procession passed around the hall where the young priest was, while the god” sought for him (1. 6).

Then followed the oracleb of the god, proclaiming him king; it is unfortunately lost in the lacuna, but immedi - ately following is a reference to the “secrets in the hearts of the gods” now revealed, namely, their intention to make him king (1.

But the young priest, Thutmose, is more highly favored; for him the gates of heaven are opened, he flies thither to be received by the sun - god (1. 9), who then crowned him (11. IO , 11 ), and fixed his four royal namesd (in addition to the fifth, Thutmose, which he al - ready bore), in accordance with divinely conferred qualities 01. 12 - 14). Thus he is installed in the kingship, and his authority established at home and abroad (11. 15, 16), in aOr possibly the then king. bThis oracle is referred to by the court in their reply (1. 23), and by Thutmose I11 himself in his inscription of year 23 at Halfa: “He (the god) hath assigned to him his inheritance as a body which he begat; he uttered an macle concerning him (tu$) r 3 hr.A that his coronation might be established for him (as) king upon the Hwus-throne of the living” (11. 3, 4, from a photograph by Steindorff).

This remarkable narrative, under a cloak of alleged divine interposition, like that in the life of Harmhab (111, 22 ff.), records the elevation of Thutmose I11 from a posi - tion of humble rank in the priesthood of the Karnak temple of Amon to the throne of Egypt. This is unquestionable fact. The only difference between this elevation of Thut - mose I11 and that of Harmhab is that Harmhab reached it after a long official career, culminating in great political power, while Thutmose I11 rose to it directly from his priestly rank in the temple. Any attempt to explain this is to pass distinctly from fact to theory. Suppose that Thutmose I11 was the oldest son of Thutmose I, born before the latter’s accession; his mother being, as we know, a lady not of royal blood, named I+ This would explain why we find him as a priest in the Amon temple. When his father, Thutmose I, after marrying the royal princess Ahmose, gained the throne, and Hatshepsut, his daughter by her, grew up, she (Hatshepsut) was given in marriage to the king’s eldest son, still a priest in the temple. Thus was the young priest immediately invested with a future claim upon the throne - a claim which a young man of the ability which we know he possessed, would surely make effective. Queen Ahmose dies, and with her perishes Thutmose 1’s right to the throne. The young priest imme - diately claims his right to reign, through his wife, precisely as his father, Thutmose I, had d0ne.a And now we pass from theory to fact again. aHarmhab also gained his right to the throne through his wife, a royal princess, who is referred to in his coronation inscription (111, 28, 1. IS)."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Q 1381 CORONATION INSCRIPTION 59 136. On the occasion of a great feast, when the god appears in procession, the future Thutmose I11 has all ar - ranged so that the god shall stop before him as he stands in his place among the ranks of priests in the colonnaded hall, and shall indicate him as the future king. The plan is carried out successfully, and a superb stroke of imagination adds also the visit to the celestial realm there to be crowned and ‘named by Re, the sun - god himself.

The inscription refers to offerings of the fifteenth year; it is important to note that already at this time, be - tween this date and the beginning of his great campaigns (year 22), Thutmose I11 possessed forest domains in Syria (1. 34), from which he drew cedar for his temple doors. He was also receiving captives and the children of native princes from Syria at this time.

As the campaign in Asia was already over by Amenhotep 11’s third year, and it was certainly made necessary by Thutmose 111’s death, it is clear that Amenhotep I1 reigned his first year with Thutmose 111, fought out his war in Asia in his second year, and went to Nubia in his third (OB 780 ff.).

It is probable that this interpretation was pressed at first only by kings whose claims to the throne through their mortal parents were ques - tionable. Naturally, there gradually grew up around so fruitful a theme a literary version of the story, as well as pictures of the various incidents in the drama. These finally took stereotyped form, and the pictures, accompanied by explanatory text, made up of fragmentary quotations from the story in poetic form, have been preserved to us by Hatshepsut at Der el - Bahri and by Amenhotep I11 at Luxor. 188.

CThat these pictures are composed of conventionally current scenes is shown by the fact ( I ) that both Hatshepsut and Amenhotep I11 used almost identically the same scenes in their birth reliefs; (2) that the sculptor of Hatshepsut’s scenes, copied his traditional models in every detail, including the sex of the child (of course, a boy! This was not to conceal the child’s sex, for all the pronouns in the accompanying texts are feminine!); had he been sketching something new, prompted by this particular occasion, his sketches would have been made to suit the occasion."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"0 1901 THE BIRTH OF QUEEN HATSHEPSUT 77 folk - tale in which the state fiction found expression and circulated among the common people. The explanatory texts, accompanying the reliefs of Hatshepsut and Amen - hotep 111, unfortunately furnish us only the merest frag - ments of the fine poem in which the court and the higher classes heard the story of the monarch’s divine paternity. The meagerness of the surviving fragments of the court poem makes a comparison with the folk - tale a very brief matter, but enough of the former is preserved to show that one quotes from the other, or both quote from a common source in traditional stock phrases long orally current. For the same gods figure at the birth in both, and at least in two incidents the same words are employed by both. 189. Later every king claimed Amon (successor of Re) as his physical father, and in Ptolemaic times the incidents in the divine birth of the king were regularly depicted in the temple reliefsa The most notable example in late times, Alexander the Great, who journeyed to the Oasis of Amon that he might be recognized as the god’s son, was therefore merely acting in harmony with a state fiction as old as the Fifth Dynasty. He thus became the legitimate king of Egypt by the only possible means. 190. In the case of Hatshepsut, it was, of course, a violent wrenching of the traditional details to apply the fiction to a woman, for the entire legend was fitted only to a man.

Ac - cording to the date of her jubilee (year IS), she must have spent fifteen years as crown prince (being nominated thirty years before the jubilee).a After references to her godlike appearance and blooming beauty, having grown from child - hood to maidenhood, the journey is barely mentioned, but it is stated that all the gods came to her as she journeyed northward. Following this, over half of the inscription (11. 8 - 15) is occupied with the splendid promises of the gods regarding the greatness of her future kingdom. That this journey northward is represented as primarily in order to visit Heliopolis, and there be acknowledged and crowned by Atum, is shown by the accompanying scene, in which she is crowned in his presence. 222. The same incident occurs in the coronation of Amen - hotep 111. This was undoubtedly an old custom, for Atum was the solar deity, who was always associated with the kingship; and, as we noticed in the preceding birth series, Atum’s successor at Heliopolis, Re, became the father of all mortal kings of Egypt. In accordance with this old custom, Amenhotep I11 also visited Atum, and was crowned by him, before his accession. The visit of Piankhi (IV, 871) was due to the same custom, and Thutmose III’s ascension to heaven (9 141) to be crowned and receive his royal names is but a splendid variation of the customary fiction. aSee Sethe, Zeitschrift fur agyptische Sprache, 36, 65."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"$2251 THE CORONATION OF QUEEN HATSHEPSUT 91 The Queen’s Growth and Beauty . 223.

These are undoubtedly the most interesting series of reliefs in Egypt, and form almost our only early source of information for the land of Punt. They are as beautiful in execution as they are important in content. They record an important expedition of the queen thither, which was successfully concluded just before her ninth year (8 292,l. I). 247. The only earlier evidences of intercourse with Punt are as follows: In the Fourth Dynasty a Puntite negro appears as the slave of one of the sons of King Kh~fu;~ in the Fifth, King Sahure sent an expedition thither (I, 161, 8), aIn the Der el-Bahri temple, occupying the south half of the middle terrace (corresponding to the Birth and Youth on the north half, Q$ 187 ff.). See accom- panying plan (p. 105). First copied by Dumichen and published by Diimichen, Histmische Inschriften, 11, 8-20, and Fleet, 1-3, and 18, a; then by Mariette, Deir - el - Bahari, 5-10. The excavations of the Egypt Exploration Fund since 1894 have for the first time uncovered all the Punt reliefs, and they have all now appeared in the superb publication of the Egypt Exploration Fund (Navilfe, The Temple of Deir-el-Bahari, Introductory Memoir, Pls. 7-10, and Vol. 111, Pls. 69-86). Unfortunately, the old publications have not been collated and the por- tions'since lost, added. It is therefore still necessary to collate Mariette and Dumichen; I have placed all copies in parallel columns as a basis for the present translation. The inscriptions and reliefs have suffered, not merely from the hand of time and modern vandalism, but the inscriptions and figures of Hatshepsut were hacked out by ber political enemies.after her fall, and the figure and neighboring inscriptions of Amon, wherever occumng, were later erased by Amenhotep IV. The faint traces remaining on the wall are difficult to read; hence the numerous errors in the old publications. The most useful treatments are Erman (Life in Ancient Egypt, 505 ff.), Maspero (Struggk of the Nations, 247-53, with very full citation of the older bibliography); and for Punt especially see Miiller (Mittheil- ungen der Vwokrasiatischen Gesellschaft, 111, 42; also Orientalistische Litteratur- zeitung, 11, 416) and Krd (Reitrage zur Geschichde der Blemyer und Nubier, \"Denkschriften der Wiener Akademie,\" Philologisch-historische Classe, Vol. XLVI, 4te Abhandlung) to which is added an excursus on Punt). blepsius, Denkmder, 11, 23; see Erman, Aegypten, 670."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"! 2481 THE PUNT RELIEFS 103 and King Isesi sent another, which brought back a dancing dwarf (I, 351); in the Sixth, an officer of Pepi 11, named Enenkhet, was killed by the Sand-dwellers on the coast, while building a ship for the Punt voyage (I, 360), and another expe- dition thither under the same king was led by the assist- ant treasurer, Thethy (I, 361); in the Eleventh Dynasty, Henu, chief treasurer of King Senekhkere-Mentuhotep 111, dispatched an expedition to Punt, which he accompanied only to the coast of the Red Sea (I, 430); in the Twelfth Dynasty, an officer of Amenemhet 11, named Khentkhetwer, records his safe return from Punt (I, 604-6);a and finally there was also an expedition under Sesostris I1 (I, 618). None of these sources contains more than the meagerest ref- erence to the fact of the expedition. 248.

THE KARNAK OBELISKSf 304. Of the queen's four obelisks at Karnak, one pair has entirely disappeared from the temple; their position is unknown, and only the summit of one is now preserved in Cairo (8 320 and Zeitschrift fiir agyptische Spache, 30, P1. 11); of the surviving pair one still stands behind the great Nineteenth Dynasty hypostyle hall, and the summit of its fallen companion lies near by. Standing Obelisk The standing survivor is now the largest obelisk in Egypt, being 974 feet high.8 The history of these two important monuments can be followed for a long period.

Whether this fact influenced her in the following procedure is, of course, purely conjectural, but in order to introduce her obelisks into this hall, she broke away the southern wall, removed all the cedar col- umns of Thutmose I on the southern side and four on the northern, of course unroofing all but the northern quarter of the hall,\" and thus totally dismantling the place, which could no longer be employed for religious ceremonial. 305.

On erection, the obelisks were supplied with the usual single, central column of inscription on each face. Later, side columns were added. Some time before the completion of the side-column inscriptions, the obelisks were surrounded by masonry up to the fifth scene from the top, and the inscriptions never were finished (see Sethe, Untersuchungen, I, 54, 55). During the extermination of the Amon cult by Amenhotep IV, he had the name of Amon erased from them,a and two or three generations afterward the name of the dishonored god was recut by Seti 1.b 307. The inscriptions on the shaft will be clear from the translation below; those of the base are of unusual interest. They furnish the date of the obelisks, viz., the end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth year of the queen's reign. Their erection celebrates \"the first occur- rence\" of the queen's jubilee, a feast marking the thirtieth anniversary of the sovereign's appointment as crown prince.

Among his works in Karnak he erected the queen's great obelisks (§Q 304 ff.), the largest now in Egypt, and went personally to the granite quarries at Assuan to secure the two vast blocks, leaving on the rocks a record of his visit there (8 359 ff.). 346.

Judging from the titles on the Karnak statue ($8 349 ff.), he controlled many of the functions of the vizier himself, and all but held that office. There is no doubt that the queen's remarkable career as king in opposition to Thutmose I11 was in some measure due to him, and in great measure to the coterie of legitimists, of which he was the most powerful member.

Thutiy was a loyal supporter of Queen Hatshepsut (see 5 348), and hence throughout his tomb his name and that of the queen have been entirely erased. He was the successor of Ineni ($5 340 ff.) as \"overseer of the double gold- and silver-houses,\" and this brought him many monu- mental enterprises, for which he furnished the metals, at the same time having the construction of a large number of such monuments under his charge. He was probably the builder of the queen's ebony shrine (1. 24 and 5 126 ff.) ; he furnished the metal-work on two great obelisks (1. 28), superintended many other monuments, and was charged with the measuring of the splendid returns in precious metal from the queen's southern expeditions, particularly the famous one to Punt (11. 33-38). That Thutiy is strictly veracious in this statement is most strikingly shown by the scene of weighing and measuring in the Punt reliefs ($275), where the traces of his figure, busily engaged in taking his notes, is identifiable by means of his name and title, \"Scribe and aThis probably refers to the death of Thutmose 11, the predecessor of Thut- mose 111 and Hatshepsut.

Unfortunately, this fulness in excerpting is confined to the Megiddo campaign, and even toward its end the abbreviation and omissionb already begin.

This is evident even in the English. It is a question whether Thaneni could have been the author of the earliest cam- paign records, for he is still in active service under Thutmose IV (see Recueil, IV, 130)~ so that, supposing he began with the Megiddo campaign at twenty-five years of age, he would have been over eighty years old at the accession of Thutmose IV, under whom he completed a census of the people and live-stock in all Egypt (see Champollion, Notices descriptives, I, 487), which is recorded as follows: \"Mustering of the whole land before his majesty, making an inspection of everybody, knowing the soldiers, priests, rroyal serfs', and all the craftsmen of the whole land, all the cattle, fowl, and small cattle, by the military scribe, beloved of his lord, Thaneni.\" On his wide powers, see also the inscription in Brugsch, Recueil de monuments, 66, 2, a.

The excerpting scribe, being a priest, is more mter- ested in the booty than the strategic operations which led to its capture, because this booty was largely given to his temples; hence he pares down his extracts to the meagerest statement of the king's whereabouts, adding a tolerably full summary of the booty and tribute. Indeed, it may be said that, although the king did command that this permanent record of his campaigns should be made on the temple wall, yet the entire record which we call the Annals serves as little more than an introduction to the list of feasts and offer- ings (§§ 541 ff.) by which the Annals are continued. They merely explain whence came the magnificent offerings to Am0n.b It is therefore frequently impossible to distinguish between a serious campaignc like that of Megiddo and mere expeditions for inspection. 395.

Thutmose I had been able to march to the Euphrates without meeting any serious PThis register of daily supplies is, of course, not the ephemerides of Thaneni; but the fact of excerption is equally clear, nevertheless. This interesting statement finds a parallel in the tomb of Hui, where it is said concerning his praises: \"One mentions them (one) time (each) by its mme, (for) they are too numerous to put them in writing\" (Lepsius, DenkmaZer, 111, I I 7 = DenkmaZer, Text, 111, 302). bThere is on this same wall a relief showing Thutmose I11 presenting to Amon a magnificent array of costly gifts in gold and silver.

The results of his conquest had not been permanent; that is, they could not endure indefinitely without further campaigning, especially in the extreme north. This Hatshepsut had not done, although the Lebanon or a part of it was still held in the year IS. Then the kingdom and city of Kadesh, on the upper Orontes, quietly organized a formidable revolt, which united all Egypt's Asiatic enemies from Sharuhen on the south to the Euphrates on the north. It is clear also that the powerful kingdom of Mitanni assisted this general revolt with men and means. For the Mitannian king natur- ally feared to see the armies of the Pharaoh in Naharin at his very threshold. Early in the year 23, Thutmose I11 met and overthrew the allied Syrians at Megiddo, which he besieged and captured, and although he marched northward to the southern end of Lebanon, he was far from able to reach and punish Kadesh. But he established a fortress in the southern Lebanon, to prevent another southward ad- vance by the king of Kadesh, and then returned home. 396. Of the next eighteen years the summers of sixteen were spent campaigning in Syria, making a total of seven- teen campaigns. The next three campaigns (2, 3, and 4) are meagerly recordedlb but in the year 29, on the fifth campaign, we find the king plainly making preparations for the conquest of Kadesh, by first securing the coast and getting possession of the harbors of Phenicia.

The foothold in north Syria necessary for an advance into the Euphrates country had now been gained, and Kadesh, the dangerous enemy who would have threatened his rear on such a march, had been subdued. The next year (31) was therefore spent in equipping the Phcenician harbors with supplies and quelling any smouldering embers of rebellion there. 398. It was not until the second year (33) after these preparations that the great king landed in Phcenicia for his march into the heart of Naharin. Already in the year 24, as a result of the great Megiddo victory, the king of Assur had sent presents, but now the Egyptians were again to plunder the Euphrates countries---a feat which had not been repeated since Thutmose I. The long and arduous marcha was successfully made, the king of Mitanni, who had, with Kadesh, been the heart and soul of the Syrian resistance, was totally defeated, Carchemishb was reached and taken, the Euphrates was crossed, and at last Thutmose 111 sets up his boundary tablet, marking the northern limits of his empire, beside that of his father, Thutmose I.

Only a voyage of inspection along the Phcenician coast was required in the next year (34), but the revolt of the king of Mitanni called Thutmose into Naharin in the following year, and after a decisive defeat the people of Naharin were again brought under the Egyptian yoke. The records of the next two years (36 and 37) are lost, but in the year 38 we find the king punishing the princes of the southern Lebanon region, in order to protect the road north between the Leba- nons. On this occasion, for the first time, he receives gifts from the prince of Cyprus, and also Arrapachitis, the later Assyrian province. 400. The punishment of the raiding Bedwin of southern Palestine forms a preliminary to the usual journey of inspec- tion in the next year (39), and the record of the next two yea,rs (39 and 40) is too fragmentary to show more than that the tribute was paid as usual. 401. Finally, the long series of revolts in Syria culminates in a last desperate rebellion, in which Thutmose's arch- enemy, the source of most of his trouble in Syria, Kadesh, is the leader. Naharin sends allies, and Tunip likewise, so that the whole of north Syria, at least inland, is again combined against Thutmose. In the year 42 he proceeded first against Tunip, and after its subjugation besieged Kadesh, which was finally captured. Thus the nearly twenty years of Syrian campaigning was concluded, as it had begun, by the humiliation of Kadesh, which during all that time had been Egypt's thorn in the flesh. This last down- fall was final; Kadesh no longer stirred revolt in Syriala and Thutmose I11 could relax his ceaseless efforts continued during seventeen campaigns.

This fifth campaign begins with a new caption, as if a new period of the wars had begun here, and it is clear that the revolt suppressed in the south in the year 23 was after six years not yet subdued in the cities of Zahi, which the king had not yet visited. The wars in the Annals are thus divided into two great groups, the first group being in the south, and the second group, beginning in the year 29, being the wars in the north. ' After the capture of a city the name of which is lost (W '---), which was supported by troops from Tunip, contained a sanctuary of Amon, and yielded rich plunder, the king proceeded southward and captured Arvad. The rich gardens and fields, now in the season of fruitage, were plundered, and the army spent the days in rioting and feasting. The king seized some Phoenician ships, and the expedition returned by water.

Probably Carchemish marks the northern limit of the advance in this campaign, and the two other battles mentioned by Amenemhab occurred on the march thither ($5 581, 582).

The last campaign, which happened not later than the year 42, shows the old king, now probably over seventy years of age, suppressing a revolt of Tunip and Kadesh, who are supported by auxiliaries from Naharin. He marched from the northern coast of Syria, after capturing the coast city of Erkat~,~ directly against Tunip. Having subjugated it, he then marched up the Orontes against his old enemy, Kadesh, whose prince led the allied forces, which Thutmose I11 had routed at Megiddo on the first campaign, nearly twenty years before. There was a stubborn defense, but, according to the narrative of Amencmhab, the walls of the city were breached, and it was taken by storm (§ 590). From it and surrounding towns great plunder was secured, among which were the Naharin auxiliaries and their horses. aRestored from the character of the tribute. blepsius, 83.

In this inscription Thutmose I11 records the new feasts and additional offerings which he established during the period of his splendid conquests in Asia. The record, therefore, begins with his return from the first campaign in the year 23, and continues till the year 42, when his cam- paigning ~eased.~ In order to connect the record with the occurrence of the first campaign, it goes back to the march to Lebanon after the fall of Megiddo, refers to a fortress which he built there, and proceeds then to his return and landing at Thebes. All this leads up to the establishment of three great \"Feasts of Victory,\" for which it furnishes the motive. After fixing the calendar of these three feasts, with the lists of oblations to be offered at their celebration, the king proceeds to the gifts which he made to Amon at the feast of his voyage to southern Opet, which are exceedingly rich and numerous, including the three cities just captured in the Lebanon, fields and gardens, slaves, precious metals and stones, and the doubling of some of the old offerings (11. 5-14). It would seem as if this feast was the first cele- brated by the king after his return from the first campaign, for it is among its gifts that the acquisitions of that campaign appear. aWall inscription im the Karnak temple on the back of the south half of Pylon VI (Baedeker, plan opp. p. 239).

It forms a very important supplement to the Annals of Thutmose 111, but unfortunately does not insert the dates of the campaigns nor follow a chronological order. The old soldier seems to have narrated to some scribe, who recorded them, the more important incidents and ad- ventures of his career as they occurred to him, without attempt at order, beyond the involuntary association of events that belong to the same campaign. This narrative he had engraved beside his own figure on the wall of his tomb, as he is represented standing in the presence of Amenhotep 11, to whom this recital of his life is evidently directed. 575. Beginning with a battle in the Negeb (year 39), he proceeds to three battles in Naharin, and the capture of Senzar (year 33), followed by the capture of Kadesh (year 30). The name of the next country ( h') is mutilated, and this is followed by a battle in Tikhsi (prob- ably year 35), and the elephant hunt at Niy (year 33); while the whole series concludes, as it should, with the siege of Kadesh on the last campaign of Thutmose I11 in the year 42.

This biography affords us fleeting glimpses of the arduous tasks which beset, the remarkable campaigns of Thutmose 111, of which the Annals offer us little or nothing. The first campaign in Naharin (year 33) brought three suc- cessive battles in which Amenemhab distinguished himself; of these the Annals mention only one, without referring to the place where it occurred. 577. These adventures of Amenemhab are, of course, typical of a host of others, which fell to the lot of the Egyp- tian soldier in Syria. Some of them found place in folk- tales, and one has survived in the story of the capture of Joppa by Thutiy, one of Thutmose III's general^,^ whose apart of the reverse (the first three pages) of the British Museum papyrus, known as Harris 500.

But fs't ~(\"heigltt\") does not mean \"Ufer,\" and Mons Casius could have been much more easily identified by the scribe by mentioning the Orontes, rather than the distant Aleppo. Evidently some height not far from Aleppo is meant, for which Gebcl Sim can (2,700 feet high) answers admirably. It is but slightly north of west of Aleppo, but the Egyptian did not carry a compass, and any traveler of today would speak of it as west of Aleppo, and refer to his table of bearings for the exact direction.

Another form of this dedication is an epitheton attached to Thutmose 111's name: Establishing the house of his father, Amon-Re, of fine white limestone of Ayan. 604.

This inscription records how Thutmose I11 found the Ptah-temple, just north of the great hypostyle in Karnak, built of brick, with wooden columns and doorposts, falling to ruin. The occasion of rebuilding, or at least of new offerings, was the return from the first campaign, and the inscription contains interesting references (5 616) to the in- vestment and capture of Megiddo on that campaign. From the plunder thus obtained the temple was also newly and richly furnished. As this temple was one of the stopping- places of Amon, when his processions moved out from the Karnak temple, on all feast days, offerings are provided for Arnlon on such occasions (9 0 61 5, 61 7). At such times also the lay priesthood was to receive an offering, as well as the royal statue which was carried in procession (8 618) ; and the usual daily offering was made to Ptah (9 619), increased by certain new offerings now established for the first time aOver two-thirds line. b.4bout three-fourths line.

These were further increased on the king's return from a subsequent campaign late in September ($621). With offerings for Mut-Hathor ($ 622), the inscription closes. These offerings are all \"for the sake of life, prosperity, and health\" of the Pharaoh; that is, they are the official sacrifices in his behalf, which were begun as soon as a king was crowned (cf. $5 7). 610. The stela was badly defaced, when the persecution of Ikhnaton caused the chiseling out of the entire relief and every occurrence of the names of other gods. This defacement is important as showing that the persecution of Ikhnaton was not confined to Amon. The restorers of Seti I at Thebes were so accustomed to inserting the name of Amon that they have here inserted it where the titles clearly show that Ptah was original. 611. The dedication inscription on the wall of the Ptah- temple also attributes the building to Thutmose 111, of whom it says: a [He made (it) as his monumentIb for his father, Ptah, the beautiful of face, lord of \"Life of the Two Lands.\" presiding over the great seat; erecting for him the house of Ptah anew [of] fine white sandstone, doors of new cedar of the best of the terraces.

The geography of Nubia is too little known to determine the limits of the territory in- cluded in these lists, and it is uncertain how far up the Nile Thutmose 111's conquests extended.

Unfor- tunately, these instructions, which occupy twenty long lines, are very fragmentary, and at the same time extremely obscure. The following version omits a number of passages which may not be safely rendered, and even so translates much more than can be understood, without a longer com- mentary than it is possible to offer here.

The instructions are remarkably humane in temper and show a surprisingly high appreciation of justice. As they present the fundamentals of Egyptian government, it is greatly to be regretted that they are so fragmentary and difficult.

This, the most important inscription known on the organization of the state under the Eighteenth Dynasty, is unfortunately incomplete. Two duplicates \" found by Newberry fill out many of the lacunz, but the last fifth of the text is very fragmentary. This is especially unfortunate, as the latter part of the inscription is by far the most intelli- gible and deals with functions easily understood. 672. The inscription is an outline of the duties of the vizier, of the greatest interest. After prescribing the external arrangements for the vizier's daily sitting in his \"hall,\" as his office is termed, the document proceeds to the daily conference of the vizier with the king, and, immediately aThis is the same advice given by Amenemhet I to his son Sesostris I (I, 479, 11. 3-5). bSee Duties of Vizier, 5 683, 1. 14.

These daily duties are now followed by a long list of exceedingly varied functions to be discharged by the vizier, making in all at least thirty. There seems to be no logical order in the enumeration, and the varied character of the list will be evident from a reading of the marginal heads, which may serve in lieu of a table of content here. It will be seen that the vizier is grand steward of all Egypt, aind that all the activities of the state are under his control. He has general oversight of the treasury, and the chief treasurer reports to him; he is chief justice, or head of the judiciary; he is chief of police, both for the residence city and the kingdom; he is minister of war, both for army and navy; he is secretary of the interior and of agriculture, while all general executive functions of state, with many that may not be classified, are incumbent upon him. There is, indeed, no prime function of the state which does not operate through his office. He is a veritable Joseph, and it must be this office which the Hebrew writer has in mind in the story of Joseph. The only person other than the king to whom he owes any respect is the chief treasurer, to whom he seems to offer a daily statement that all is well with the royal possessions. Such power is, of course, possible only in a highly centralized state, and Egypt is shown by this inscription to be in the Empire simply a vast estate of the Pharaoh, of which the vizier is chief steward. The vizier's functions are distributed promiscuously throughout the d~ocument, as follows : I. Judiciary (§§ 675, 681, 685-6, 688-91, 700, 704, 705). 11. Treasury (9 9 676, 680, 706, 708). . 111.

It is impossible to discuss this inscription without raising the question of its origin and exact character. The fact that it is known to exist in two other tombs also, would suggest that it was not an informal enumeration of the vizier's duties drawn up by himself especially for his tomb, but a close examination of the document itself shows that it could not possibly have been a state document to the decrees of which the vizier was amenable. It was evidently no more than we have suggested, viz., a list of the vizier's duties, compiled by himself, for recording in his tomb. It must, of course, have been based upon the existent laws, from which it may, in places, contain extracts. In any case, it contains the purport of certain of the laws in .force at the time, some of which, like those regulating the criminal docket, are very interesting and important. The only other surviving example of the laws of Egypt are in the Decree of Harmhab (111, 45 ff .), for of the \" 40 skins, \" undoubtedly rolls containing \" Utis law which is in his hand\" mentioned by our inscription, nothing has ever been found.

V. INSPECTION OF TAXES OF UPPER EGYPT 716. These important scenes,a representing the only tax- lists we possess, show the local officials of Upper Egypt paying their dues (yp'w) to the vizier. Just what part of the total revenues of Upper Egypt these dues formed, it is impossible to state; but that they were only a part is certain. For the inscription clearly indicates that they are only the dues exacted from the local officials (as a tax upon their offices), and not the taxes paid by the people, for which we find a different designation (bk'w), from that employed here. This tax (yp'w) upon the officials is the one remitted by Harmhab (111, 63). It was collected by the vizier, while the tax (bk'w) upon the people was, of course, collected by the chief treasurer. It is noticeable that the vizier has charge of these revenues (yp-w) only in Upper Egypt, showing clearly the extent of his fiscal jurisdiction. There was, of course, another vizier for Lower Egypt from below Assiut to the sea.b Owing to the loss of a large portion of the lower rows, it is impossible to summarize and determine the total income aPls.

It has long been evident, both from its language and content, however, that it belongs to the Eighteenth Dynasty. The discovery of Intef's tomb at Thebes by Newberry shows that this conclusion is correct, and that Intef lived in the reign of Thutmose 111.

The stela contains, in a less formal list than the \"Duties of the Vizier\" (!$675 ff.), a similar statement of the duties of the \"royal herald\" (whm-Stnyc = lit., \"royal reporter or repeater\"). This statement, far from being an extract from the government archives, is but a random rehearsal, in a boastful style, of the powers of the court herald. It is evident that his office is only partially expressed by our word herald, for the duties of the Egyptian herald show him to have been of ministerial power and importance; they were the following: I. The management of the formalities and ceremonies of court and palace (11. 4-7, only part of 1. 5). 2.

Syria, of course, revolted on the death of Thut- mose 111, and already in his second year we find his ener- getic son, Amenhotep 11, on the march into northern Syria to quell the rebellion. Doubtless the harbor cities had also rebelled, and hence the young king is forced to proceed by land. Leaving Egypt in April, as his father had done on the first campaign thirty-three years before, he had already in early May won a battle at Shemesh-Edom in northern Palestine. On the twelfth of May he crossed the Orontes, and gained a skirmish near the river. He cele- brated a feast of thanksgiving to Amon there, and fourteen days later (May 26) he arrived at Niy, which opened its gates to him and received him with acclamation. June 5 he reached and punished the rebellious city of Ikathi, which was plotting against its Egyptian garrison. Some- where in Naharin he set up his tablet of victory, a as his father and grandfather had done before him. Here the sources fail, and the further course of the campaign is unknown until the king's return to Egypt; but it is clear that the coalition against Egypt was crushed in Tikhsi, probably at the battle on the Orontes, for on his return in the autumn the king brought back with him to Thebes \"the seven princes who were in the district of Tikhsi,\" and sacrificed them himself before Amon.

The route by which Amenhotep advanced northward from Shemesh-Edom is not certain, but the crossing of the Orontes is doubtless the last one as he turned toward the Euphrates. This would be most naturally at Senzar. He would then march by way of Aleppo to Niy, which was about 175 miles from Senzar. That he reached Senzar is shown by his list in Q 798A. This suits his marching speed also, as he would have made about 124 miles a day from Senzar to Niy. aThere may be a reference here to the common designation of this remote region as the \"end of the earth,\" but it more probably refers merely to the king's shading his eyes that he might scan the horizon. bLit., \"behind.\" clegrain's lacuna of 24 cm. is of course impossible; it is improbable also at the head of the next two lines. dhntw. eLit., \"his span\" (htryj. fRestore n, \"to,\" according to Amgda tablet, 11. 16, 17 ($ 797). eThere is no line omitted here, as Champollion indicates. hThe same word (shntw) applied to the corselet (It n~) is found in Thutmose 111's first campaign, 1. 23 (shnw-ty 7). iThe texts of de RougB, Bouriant, Wiedemann, and Brugsch's translations show \"month II,\" not 111, as usually read from Champollion.

BUBASTIS INSCRIPTION a 846. The fragment preserved to us belonged to an historical inscription of unusual interest, containing the account of an advance into Nubia, with descriptions of the battles and the stages of the advance in the same style as that of the Annals of Thutmose 111. Indeed, it is not unlikely that the walls of the Bubastis temple contained annals of the wars of the Empire in Nubia, like those of the conquest of Syria on the walls of Karnak. The fragment unfortunately contains no royal name, and has been conjecturally assigned to Sesostris 1II.b This is impossible, for the orthographyc shows beyond doubt that the inscription dates from the Empire. Moreover, its content indicates a time when the Egyptian conquest extended far into the upper regions of Nubia, that is, from Amenhotep I1 on. A hitherto unnoticed reference to the coronation anniversary is here of great service. It is men- tioned (1. 6) as occurring just after the first battle and before the advance to \"the height of Hun\" began. They reached this point in the third month of the first season (1. 11); the coronation anniversary therefore occurred not long before. Now, the coronation of Amenhotep I11 occurred in the third month of the first season on the second day; and the above inscriptions (6 6 844 ff .) show that he also celebrated a coronation festival on his Nubian campaign.d It is aOn a block of granite found at Bubastis; published by Naville (Bubastis, XXXIV, A). The block is from the middle of an inscription in vertical lines; not merely the beginning and end of the inscription are lost, but also the upper and lower portions of the lines, of which this block bears the middle portions. bBy Naville (Bubastis, 9).

The expedition is very difficult to follow in the scanty fragment preserved to us, but its course was probably as follows: Early in October, when the river is high, the army is already far up in Nubia. Before a battle the king makes a speech to his troops, after which the battle occurs, the king personally taking part in it (ll. 1-5). The expedition then started southward for the \"height of Hua\" on the coronation anniversary; reference is made to the first camp (1. 6). The king commanded that people (Nubians ?) furnish certain things for the expeditions 0. 7), and reference is made to former troops; his majesty held a council (1. 8). A branch expedition of 124 men was sent out from the river to a certain well (1. 9); whether to destroy the well or attack the villages which would naturally be found near a wellb is uncertain, but it was evidently the customary procedure to go out to these outlying wells, for in his expedi- tion of the sixteenth year, Sesostris I11 \"went fmth to their wells\"b (I, 658, 1. 15) ; here also the purpose is not stated. The expedition then proceeded southward for \"the height of Hua\" (l. IO), taking captives and spoil on\\ the way (1. I I). They were favored by a high north wind, and not more than a month after the coronation feast the desired \"height whereas Amenhotep I11 apparently actually celebrated the feast in Nubia (Q 844, 1. 5). The question arises whether the cataract stela ($5 843 ff.) represents the party as having actually arrived at the &st cataract on the return from the campaign, on coronation day. If so, we then have two different expeditions of Amenhotep 111. In attributing both inscriptions to the same expedition, I am assuming that the cataract inscription gives the date of the battle, which is coronation day in both. acornpare the muster of Nubian troops by the viceroy Mermose (Q 852, U. 1-4). bMany villages in Nubia are unreached by the water of the Nile, and are supported by wells."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"0 8491 NUBIAN WAR 339 of Hua . . . . came jmth,\" that is, rose from the horizon (1 12).

Both Hua (hwC) and the land of Khesekhet (b'sb. t) occur close together in the lists of the regions of Khenthennofor, placed on the Karnak walls by Thutmose 111 (see § $645 ff) ;a the occurrence of Punt along with these names, and the narrative of the expedition, would indicate that they denote localities in the extreme south beyond Karoy on the Nile (above the Atbara ?). 849.

Amenhotep I11 celebrated at least three royal jubilees: the first in the year 30; the second, although not recorded, probably like that of Ramses 11, in the year 34; and the third in the year 36. The celebration of the first jubilee is recorded in the tomb of Kharnhet,' in two remark- able reliefs. 871. The first shows the king enthroned in state at the right; before him is the inscription: aFull fivefold titulary. bThis name was long misread \"Zaru,\" with which it has nothing to do (cf. Steindorff, Zeitschrift fiir agyptisch Sprache, 1901, 64; and Breasted, ibid., 65, 66). The statements regarding the presentation of \"Zaru\" to Tiy, current in the histories, are all to be rejected.

At Benihasan, the rmn-sign occurs in door dimensions, where it is clear that the cubit is meant; see my remarks (Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archceology, March, 1900, 88-90). dThus the lake must have been completed in fifteen days! eCf. further examples by Spiegelberg (Rechnungen, Text, 81-86), who has compiled a very useful list of these barges, also Breasted, Zeitschrift fiir agyptische Sprache, 1901, 66. flepsius, .

Erected by Amenhotep I11 in his temple behind the Memnon colossi, to record his buildings in honor of Amon, its inscrip tion was almost totally obliterated by the reforming zeal of his son, Amenhotep IV.b It was restored by Seti I, who recorded his restoration thus: \"Restoration of the monu.ment whkh the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, itfenmare (Seti I), made for his father Amon-Re, King of all Gods.\" In restoring the monument, the sculptor of Seti found the old lines sufficiently traceable to be recut with tolerable certainty, not without some glaring errors, which cannot always be corrected. Four or five generations later, Mer- neptah demolished the splendid temple of Amenhotep 111, containing this stela, and used the material, including the stelad in a building of his own, where it fell down and remained until taken out by Petrie in February, 1896. 879.

The treatment of temple floors with silver (11. 3, 11, and 22) and the walls with gold or electrum (11. 3, II), although very vaguely described, is important. The settle- ment of Syrians around the temple of the (Memnon) Colossi is historically of importance also. The king's selection of his Soleb temple in Nubia, to be mentioned in preference to his Egyptian temples outside of the be^,^ shows his strong interest in the region above the second cataract, where he was so active, and where he caused himself to be worshiped. It is furthermore noticeable that the king makes no reference to his other Theban buildings, the temple of Mut and the temple at the northern gate of the Karnak inclosure, of either of which very little now remains. aThus he omits all reference to his Memphis temple, where he was evidently worshiped, for he appears with Ptah as one of the gods of Memphis (Papyrus Sallier, IV; Brugsch, Thesaurus, V, 961, No. 23); and his temple there was called \"House of Nibmare\" (Brugsch, Thesaurus, V, 963). A cultus statuette which he dedicated to himself as a god in this Memphis temple is in Alnwick collection; it bears the dedication: \" Nibmare (Amenhotep ZII); he made it as his monument for his living image in 'The House of Nibmare\"' (Birch, Cetalogue Alnwick Castle, 5658). The El Kab temple, which he is often stated to have built, was erected by Thutmose IV, his father, for whom he only decorated it, as the inscription states: \"Lo, the majesty of King Nibmare decorated this monument of his father, Thlltmose IV, forever and ever\" (Lepsius, Denhmaler, 111, 80, b= J.

Not only do the above dedications show that the lions were originally erected at Soleb (Khammat), but the breast of one bears the inscription of the Ethiopian, stating that he removed it, as follows: \"Good God, Lion of Rulers, fierce-eyed Lion when he spies his foes treading his path - (cartouche, name lost), who brought it.\" Below this, is the double name: \"King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Enekhneferibre (C nb-nfr-yb-R c), Son of Re, Amenisru (Ymn-ys-r-w ').'I (Published Lepsius, Aus- waltl der wiclttigsten Urkunden, XIII; I had also my own copies of the originals.)

He was: \" Governor of the (residence) city, vizier; \" \"hereditary prince, count of Horus in his house; a doer of truth, a hater of deceit, wearer of the royal seal, chief of works among the great monuments, chief of prophets of North and South, vizier, just judge; sole companion, approaching his lord, whom the Lord of the Two Lands loved because of his remarkable traits, who enters the palace, and comes forth with favor, with the utterances of whose mouth one (= the king) is satisfied;\" \"(mr't-ntr-) priest, the mouth that makes content in the whole land, (sm-) priest, master of all wardrobes, enter- ing into the secrets of heaven, of earth [and of the nether world];\" \"master of secret things of the palace;\" \"attached to Nekhen, prophet of Mat, chief justice.\"' -- =!See Hammamat Stela of Ramses IV, 1. 14 (IV, 466); also Brugsch fAcgyp- hlogie, 216 f., note).

It was inadequately published by Stuart in The Funeral Tent of an Egyptian Queen, 89 ff.; and Egypt after the War, PI. 27, and pp. 386-88. Bouriant has some notes on the tomb in Revue archiologique, 1882, N. S., XXIII, 279-84. and Recueil, VI, 55, 56.

Ramose, as head of the religious, judicial, and administrative organization, must have been the most powerful official at the court of Ikhnaton. He had been vizier under the king's father, Amenhotep III;° he was early won over to the Aton faith, and the particular value of his tomb lies in the fact that we may trace in it this con- version of Ramose at a time when -1khnaton still called himself Amenhotep, and still permitted references to Amon and \"the gods.\" This last term, as well as the name of Amon, haibeen expungedb at a later date. The materials in the tomb are as follows: Relief Scenec 938. A king sits enthroned on the right, his face and figure executed in the usual conventional style; behind him the goddess Mat; before him, with upraised arms, Ramose. aIt must be the same Ramose who, in an inscription on the island of Sehel, is called: \"Hereditary Qrince, the two eyes of the king in the whole land, governor of the (residence) city and vizier, Ramose\" (Brugsch, Thesaurus, V, 1216, gg= de Morgan, Catalogue des monuments, I, 90, No. 79). See also Wiedemann, Recueil, 17, 9; Mariette, Monuments divers, 70, No. 21; ibid., 72, No. 50; and Petrie, Season in Egypt, 13, No. 334. bThis expungement is very significant; for it is not the name of a particular god, but the word \"gods,\" which is expunged. I have found this same erasure of the word \"gods\" at Karnak in the long offering inscription of Amenhotep I11 on Pylon 111, and in the Coronation Inscription of Thutmose 111; also on a number of Eighteenth Dynasty monuments in European museums. With this fact com- pare the erasure of the gods' names at Karnak as noted by Lepsius: \"Auch hier [Temple of Ptah, northern Karnak] waren die Namen des Ptah und Amon wie auch der Hathor und ihre Figuren alle ausgekratzt; so auch auf dem Architrav der Thiire die Namen des Ptah. Ebenso sind shmtliche Gotter im Tempe1 zu Med.

By comparing Leyden Stela, V, 26, and Vienna Stela, 53, it will be seen that the wife of a certain \"overseer of the cattle of Amon\" was a \"musician of Upwawet;\" but when her husband became \"arerseer of the cattle of the house of Aton,\" she was obliged to drop her title (see Baillet, Notice sw la collection igyptienne de 1'Abbi Desnuyers, 40, and Recueil, 23, 144; also Bergmann, Recueil, IX, 42).

This Nubian city survived a thousand years under the name \"Gem-Aton,\" and is mentioned several times on the Nastesen Stela (see my remarks, Zeitschrijt fiis agyptisch Sprache, 40, 106 ff.)."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"Q 9471 TOMB OF THE VIZIER RAMOSE 389 the king, and finally issuing from the palace, when he is met by congratulating friends, rejoicing and carrying flowers.

The inscriptions were very brief, and are now mostly too fragmentary for translation, but the speech of the king to Ramose contains interesting references to the origin of the Aton faith, unfortunately much broken. It is as follows : \" &The words of Re are before thee, of my august father, who taught me their hessencea, - - them to me.

The existence of thy monuments is like the exist- ence of the heavens; thou art the Only One of [Aton], in possession of his designs.

This tomb at Thebes is in arrangement, style, and subject of reliefs exactly like those of Amarna, for which it doubtless served as a model.

THE TELL EL-AMARN.4 LANDMARKSb 949. Having finally broken with the Theban priesthood of Amon, Ikhnaton abandoned Thebes as capital and royal residence, and determined to found a new city devoted exclusively to the service of Aton, the new solar god. The site selected for the new residence and holy city was about one hun- dred and sixty miles above modern Cairo, on the east bank of aNo. 11 in Daressy's list (Recueil, XV, 50); I copied the inscriptions in the tomb (doorway, thickness, right hand), and they give this Ramose the titles: \"Commander of the army of the Lord of the Two Lands, roverseer of the White House1 of Amenhotep 111,\" which do not correspond with those of the Theban Ramose; but the rapid and sudden changes of the time may have transferred him to the head of the army.

No one stela contains a completely preserved text, but by combining all those thus far published, a complete text of the second class of stelae (the original six) was obtained.

For this purpose he established, above and below the two points where the cliffs leave the river, a northern and southern boundary line, the two being about eight miles apart, and running from cliff to cliff clear across the Nile valley, which here varies from twelve to seventeen and a half miles in width. The boundaries were then marked by fourteen splendid stelae cut into the cliffs, some of them being as high as twenty-six feet.

Finally, the irregularity of the cliffs forced the erection of no less than eight more, all on the east side, chiefly where the cliffs are broken by incoming valleys, across which the new stelae carry the line (total, fourteen). It is not improbable that there are others yet undiscovered. 951. In form these stelae are practically all of one design, showing at the top a relief scene in which appear the king, queen, and either two or three daughters, standing before an altar and adoring Aton, whose rays, terminating in hands, extend to them the symbol of life. All, including the god, are accompanied by their names in cartouches, and their titles. The inscription, beginning in the relief-field with a few vertical lines, continues below in horizontal lines. On either side of the stelae were often altars with statues of the king and his family. The stelae (called \"landmarks\" in the translation) fall, according to content, into two classes. 952. The first class is represented by two stelqb contain- ing a detailed endowment of the god, probably not confined to the gift of Akhetaton.

There is no doubt regarding which stela: are meant, as some have averred. The discovery of the northeastern stela, high above the river at Shekh Sac fd, by Mr. Davies, gives us the northern terminus on the east side for the first time. Previous calcula- tions, starting at the next stela southward (V), have been based on too short a total measurement. The discovery of the Shekh Sacfd stela makes the east and west sides of Akhetaton of about the same length as the stela states they were, viz., some 45,830 feet, roughly, over 8b miles. This makes the iter here used equal some 4,400 cubits, or 7,587 feet =roughly, IZ miles. This is longer than the iter as given by Gri5th (Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archceology, XVI 3034, and Sethe (Untersuthungen, 11, 3, 11) could now strike out his minimum of I) km.

Like all ancient Egyptian cities, the life of Akhetaton, so much of it as has survived, must be sought rather in the - city of the dead than in the city of the living; and far more of Akhetaton has survived in its cemetery than in its streets. The tombs are themselves the product of the king's bounty, and we find frequent statement of this in such iemarks as this of a relative of the deceased official: \"We see the good things which the Good Ruler hath done for his table-scribe (Ani), commanding for him goodly burial in ,4khetaton.\"b The tombs are themselves therefore tangible evidence of the royal favor in claiming which, each of the owners of these tombs has used so much space on their walls. aThese tombs are cut into the limestone cliffs surrounding the plain of Amarna on the east side of the river. They are twenty-five in number, and fall into two groups, a northern (six) and a southern (nineteen). See Petrie's map, Tell el-Amarna, P1. XXXV; and excellent description, Baedeker's Egypt, 1902,19599. The hymns here translated are usually engraved on the thickness or edge of the doorway (see Mariette, Voyage dans la haute Egypte, I, P1. V); Davies, Amarna, I, 47, 48). The relief scenes occupy the walls of the chambers. Neither scenes nor inscrip- tions have ever been completely published. Lepsius published twenty-one plates of selected material (Denkmder, 111, 91-111), the first basis for study of Amenho- tep IV's reign. The French Mission Archhlogique au Caire spent a few days there and published some new material (Bouriant, Mtmoires de la mission frawaise au Caire, I, I ff.), but it is not reliable. Finally Daressy has furnished a useful sketch of the tombs with some new material (Recueil, XV, 3650). Many scenes have also appeared in the old publications (see list in Davies, Amarna, I, 3 ff.). On the basis of the above publications I published a study of the hymns: De Hymnis in Solem sub Rege Amenophide IV Conceptis (Berlin, 1894). For the following translations, I had also my own copies of all the hymns at Amarna, made in the winter of 189495. A full and accurate publication of all the tombs has been begun by N. de G. Davies, for the Egyptian Exploration Fund, and two volumes have appeared. bTomb of Ani (RecueiZ, XV, 45). Such a practice is very old (see e. g.

Of the inscribed tombs at Amarna many show the owner standing before Ikhnaton and receiving rich decora- tions and gifts of gold. It is clear that Ikhnaton was hold- ing all his great officials faithful to his reform, only by such means. These tombs contain, besides these scenes, many pictures from the life of the town, as illustrated in the func- tions of this or that official: the houses and gardens, the palaces and temples, even such a scene as that of the chief of the gendarmes bringing in prisoners. a All such scenes have been studied, and their inscriptions as far as possible, or useful, translated below. 979. The long inscriptions contain all that we know of the Aton faith, in the form of hymns. These hymns are of two classes: (I) those recited by the king; (2) those recited by his officials. The hymns of the first class are of chiefly religious interest, and contain almost exclusively praise of Aton. Those of the second class, besides praise of Aton, contain also encomiums of the king and queen, mingled with an account of the reciter's faithfulness and favor with the king, prayers for the king, as well as for prosperity and \"goodly burial\" for the reciter himself. Facts of historical importance are thus brought out. These hymns, therefore, have been included herein as historical documents; but the hymns of the first class, although they contain the religious ideas which characterized a great historical movement, have not been translated here.b 980.
