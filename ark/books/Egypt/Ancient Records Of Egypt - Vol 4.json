This building is the most completely preserved temple of Egypt, antedating the Ptolemaic period. With its in- scriptions and reliefs, it forms a vast record of the reign of Ramses 111, parallel with the other record which he has left us in the great Papyrus Harris (§ $151-412). It was dedicated by the king in his twelfth year, by the introduc- tion of a new calendar of feasts, with richly endowed offer- ings (§§ 139-45). It was entirely built by Ramses 111, as its inscriptions show. To this fact, as well as to its fine state of preservation, is due its importance. That imposing line of similar temples, of the Eighteenth Dynasty, which once extended eastward and northeastward from Medinet Habu, has now almost entirely vanished. The one exception is the ruined temple of Thutmose 111, beside the Medinet Habu temple. The Nineteenth Dynasty temples, crowded into the same line, have likewise perished, leaving the wreck of the Ramesseum and the Kurna temple of Seti I. Each of these temples was, with slight exception (Kurna), the work of one king, and the scenes on the Ramesseum pylons, as well as those at Medinet Habu, indicate what an irreparable loss we have suffered in the destruction of these records of indi- vidual reigns. The Medinet Habu temple is therefore unique, and we must intensely regret that it was a Twentieth rather than an Eighteenth Dynasty temple which survived. 2. We shall first notice the inscriptions which concern the building (Q § 3-34) ; second, the historical records preserved on its walls (9 § 35-138) ; and, third, the great calendar of 3"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"4 TWENTIETH DYNASTY: RAMSES I11 ti 3 feasts ($0 139-45). The inscriptions of earliest date (year 5) are found farthest back, viz., in the second court; while the second pylon, which forms the front of this court, bears an immense inscription of the year 8. The first pylon, the final front of the temple, carries records of the eleventh and twelfth years; so that the gradual growth of the temple from rear to front is clear. At the same time, it must be remembered that the cutting of the scenes and inscriptions was sometimes delayed. Thus the door of the treasury in the oldest part of the temple bears a scene depicting events of the eighth year or later. Besides the records of the building on its own walls, there is also a record of it in Papyrus Harris (Q 189). 3. In all the dedicatory inscriptions which follow, the traditional formula is introduced by the king's name, pre- ceding the pronoun \"he.\" This has been omitted in the translations throughout. Beginning at the rear, with the oldest portion of the building, we find a dedicatory inscrip- tion running around the holy of holies, which is as follows : 4. \"He made (it) as his monument for his father, Amon-Re, king of gods, making for him a great and august temple of fine, white sandstone, its doors of genuine electrum; an august palace for his image, which is in his house.

Had these wars been reported in the sober and intelligible style of Thutmose 111's Annals, we should have known much of them which it is now safe to say we shall never know.

The record must be a poem. This would not be an unmixed misfortune, if the poem were intelligible; but the style is such as to render not merely whole lines, but entire strophes and whole passages, utterly unintelligible. This is due to two facts: first, total lack of order or progress in the narrative; second, the figurative character of the language. The first fault renders the reader's impressions fragmentary and confused in the high- est degree. The texts consist almost exclusively of praise of the king and exultation over the conquered foe. The court and priestly flatterers of the king either put all this in the mouths of the Egyptians, or the discomfited enemies are made to express their wonder and terror at the king's valor, mingled with lamentation at their own undoing. All this is mingled in rapid alternation, so that one is often in doubt which party is speaking; and deep in the midst of this con- fused mixture there may be a few connected phrases stating whether the enemy came by land or water, or where the battle took place, or what were the names of the hostile chiefs. This utter lack of progress or continuity is rendered still more troublesome by the second fault of these texts, viz., their figurative language. Like Arabic poetry, they contain so many epithets of a highly pictorial character as frequently to make even a common word unintelligible. When the text speaks of the \"ficll flame,\" who could divine that it means the Egyptian fleet; or when it mentions the \"wall of metal,\" who could infer that the Egyptian army is intended ?\" Just as some old Arabic poetry is unintelli- gible without a native commentator, who stood nearer the author than we do, so, much of these Medinet Habu texts is likely to remain unintelligible, without some obliging =See inscription of the year 8, 1. 23, # 66, note."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"14 TWENTIETH DYNASTY: RAMSES TI1 l5 2s Egyptian familiar with their style, to explain their overdrawn metaphors and metonymies. 22. Fortunately, the temple contains, besides its vast quantity of historical inscriptions, also no less than forty important relief scenes depicting the achievements of the king, in the conventional style common since the days of Seti I. These reliefs are accompanied by the usual explana- tory inscriptions, which are commonly couched in such general terms that the total of their historical content is small. 23. The fraction of this great mass of documents which has been published, was copied without any approach to accuracy. Champollion's publication overleaps whole lines, or transposes two successive lines; Rosellini is next to un- readable, so badly are the signs drawn. Chabas bewailed this condition of things thirty years ago,\" but it is no better today. Over half of the historical reliefs which the temple contains are unpublished. One of the most pressing needs of Egyptology is an exhaustive publication of this entire temple. I was able to procure large-scale photographs of all of the unpublished scenes and inscriptions. Twelve of these were made for me through the courtesy of Baron von Bissing, by Mr. Arthur Weigall; and to both these gentle- men I would express my sincere thanks. 24.

The scenes themselves have not yet been published (except the weighing scene), but the accompanying inscriptions are as follows:\" 26. bUtterance of King Ramses I11 to his father, Amon-Re, king of gods: \"I have built for thee an august treasuryC in my house in Thebes, which I611 with every real, costly stone, in order to brighten thy beauty therewith, forever. dUtterance of King Ramses I11 to his father, Min-Amon: \"I bring to thee myrrh for thy temple, a statue kneeling upon the ground,\" my figure of gold and every cosl:ly stone, mounted in Asiatic gold, to make ointment for thy majesty in my house, which is in Thebes.

FIRST LIBYAN WAR, YEAR 5 35. The materials for this war are extensive, but they are so unsatisfactory that we can only see in vague outlines a repetition of the conditions which led to Merneptah's Libyan war. The Libyans under their king, Themer, have made common cause with the roving sea robbers of the Thekel and the Philistines. Some of the latter joined the land forces of the Libyans; others entered the Nile mouths with their ships. The Libyans had improved the genera- tion of laxity which preceded the rise of Ramses 111's reign, to push eastward farther into the Delta, and, as in Merne- ptah's time, to settle on both banks of the \"great river,\" the Canopic branch of the Nile. They had plundered the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Q 361 MEDINET HABU: FIRST LIBYAN WAR 19 towns of the western Delta from h4emphis on the south to Kerben (probably in the vicinity of Canopus) on the north. This plundering had been going on for years unremittingly; but the invasion of the Libyan army forced Ramses I11 to act. He marched against the allies, met them in the western Delta at a town called \" Usermare-Meriamon-is-Chastiser- of-Temeh\" (5 52), and con~pletely defeated them, slaying 12,535 men and taking at least 1,000 prisoners. After a great triumph on the field, the captives and spoil were brought to the palace, where the king inspected them from the balcony, and the people rejoiced in their new-found security, as in the days of Merneptah. The materials are these: I. Great Inscription in the Second Court, Medinet Habu (§§ 36-47). 2. Relief Scenes in the Second Court and Outside North Wall, h4edinet Habu (55 48-58). 3. Papyrus Harris, 76, 11-77, 6 (5 405). I. GREAT INSCRIPTION IN THE SECOND COURT (YEAR 5)= 36. This inscription is the longest in the Medinet Habu temple, filling seventy-five lines. It is also by far the most difficult in this collection of difficult texts. It represents the last extreme of those peculiarities mentioned above (§ ZI), aoccupying a large portion of the south wall, behind the columns of the south- ern colonnade in the second court of the Medinet Habu temple; in seventy-five vertical lines, not too well preserved. It was first published by Rosellini (Monu- meltti Storici, 139-41, but omitted by Champollion) and then by Burton (Excerpts hieroglyphics, 43-45) ; later by Diimichen (Historiche Znschriften, II,46) ; de Rouge (Inscriptions hihoglyphiques, 139-47) ; Bmgsch (Thesaurus, I 197-1 207), and extracts (including names of chiefs, 11. 47 and 48) by Lepsius (Denkmaler, Text, 111, 178). Bmgsch states that he used his own copy, and collated Burton, de Rouge, and a copy by Eisenlohr; but he inserts lacunae at the ends of 11. 15-20, where they do not belong, and other slips show that we have still to await an adequate edition of this text. I collated the various editions for all questionable passages, and was able to use photographs of some portions."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"20 TWENTIETH DYNASTY: RAMSES I11 [Q 37 so that whole passages are unintelligible. Nor would they, if translatable, furnish any new facts of importance concern- ing the war; for almost the entire inscription consists of praise of the king, mingled with exultation over the fallen foe and the lamentations of the conquered. Only here and there appear incidents of the campaign, or references from which its course and character may be inferred. They are chiefly four: the king's triumph as he views from the palace balcony the prisoners and the trophies of the slain (9 42, 11. 36-41); the names of the hostile chiefs (Q 43, 11. 48 and 49); the brief mention of the northern sea-roving allies (1 44, 11. 51-54); and the security of the people, even of a woman alone upon the road (9 47, 1. 73).

If this is the case here, it would leave \"th chief of Amor\" without a verb. I have supposed it to mean \"horned,\" both pos- sessing horns or gored with them. The paragraph certainly concerns some for- eign chief, but the space in which he is abruptly introduced is very small; and the mention of Amor is a mere conjecture, based on the hst two letters, the last letter (r?) being lost. Examination of the original would determine the matter in all probability. If Amor is correct, its desolation then refers to the invasion of the sea-peoples, by whom Amor was wasted, as narrated in the long inscription of year 8 (5 64, 1. 17). This fits well the mention of the sea-peoples as allies of the Libyans in the year 5 (below 11. 51 ff.). They had already reached Amor at that time, and some of their vessels had pushed on to Egypt in time to assist the Libyans in the war of the year 5.

But the other Libyan kings above mentioned are new. They seem to be mentioned in chronological order. But as we know that Meryey was the son of Ded, Meshken is likely to have been the brother of Meryey. Themer was probably the contemporary of Rarnses 111, and Wermer reigned during the ephemeral kings of Egypt, between Merneptah and Ramses 111, but survived into Ramses 111's reign. Maspero thinks they are all contemporaries (Struggle of the Nations, 456). ~Brugsch gives Wr as the Grst sign of this name (evidently following Burton), but he first read \"Za\" (Geschiclzte, 597). This first sign is indicated as lost in all the other publications, including Lepsius (Denkmder, Text, 111, 178). Only Chabas (Etudes sw l'antiquite' historique, 236) gives The (T 3) as the first syllable. But as it is wanting in Rosellini and Burton, whose publications Chabas used (ibid., 227 f.), the reading must be a restoration which has passed from Chabas into the histories without inquiry as to its source, e. g., lastly in Maspero's Struggle of the Nations, 459. dSee Miiller, Asien und Europa, 360, n. 4.

We have in the entire passage, first the approach both on land and water, and then the destruction of both parties on land and water. The passage is referred by Maspero (following Chabas) to the war of the year 8. But it is evident that in an inscription of the year 5 it can only refer to the Libyan war of that year; and that we must conclude that the sea-peoples already assisted the Libyans in this war. This is again rendered evident by the hands cut off as trophies as in the Libyan war of Merneptah. Had there been only Libyans in the battle, we should have had only phalli. Again, when we consider that the sea-peoples were already in the Libyan ranks in Merne- ptah's day, there is, of course, no reason why they should not be there now.

Each time it thus records the capture of 1,000 and the slaying of 6,000 men. Taken together, they record a total of 28,000 men killed and captured. This is, of course, impossible. Moreover, the third relief on the north wall (out- side, 8 57) gives 12,535 as the number of slain.

Owing to pressure from uncertain sources without, large numbers of these peoples, accompanied by their wives, children, and belongings, in clumsy ox carts, left their homes, and moving eastward along the coast of Asia Minor, pene- trated Syria. They were accompanied by a strong fleet also. In the author's opinion, this movement was really a \"Vol- kenvanderung,\" not merely an invasion, with a few families of the chiefs. They were strong enough to hold all northern Syria at their mercy; from Carchemish, through the Syrian Hittite conquests to the coast, as far south as Arvad, and inland as far south as Amor, they plundered the country. They had a central camp somewhere in Amor 60. Ramses evidently still held the coast south of Arvad. Mustering his forces, he dispatched his war fleet to this coast, possibly with his motley army of various mercenaries and Egyptians on board, or in transports thus convoyed. At some pointc on the coast he inet the enemy; a land and naval action took place. Possibly the two battles were near together. In any case, Ramses, after the land victory, was able to station his archers on the strand and aid in the destruction of the hostile fleet. His victory over both forces seems to have been complete, for we do not hear of any further trouble from this source during the remainder of his reign. aBut see 111, 570, note. bSee 111, 306, and Miiller, Asien und Europa, 360 ff.

Of the long inscriptions in the Medinet Habu temple, this is by far the most clear and intelligible, both in language and arrangement. After the date and the usual encomium of the Pharaoh, which occupies about one-third of the in- scription (11. 1-12), the king is introduced as addressing his court and the people of the land, in a speech very similar to that which concludes Papyrus Harris (Pls. 75-79). After reverting to Amon's choice of him for the throne, with which the Pharaohs so often introduce their addresses, he narrates the northern invasion of Syria (§ 64, 11. 16-18), his prepara- tions to repel it (Q 65, 11. 18-23), and then, in highly figura- tive language, briefly describes the overthrow of the invaders by land and sea ($ 66, 11. 23-26). He closes with a song of triumph as long as the account of the war, occupying one- third of the inscription ($8 67, 68,ll. 26-38).

But in the year I I they were themselves invaded by the Mesh- wesh, a related tribe living on their west, and the Mesh- wesh chieftains, Keper and Meshesher, father and son, laid waste the Libyan country. The Libyans were then forced to join the Meshwesh in an invasion of Egypt. The allies pushed eastward as far as the canal of Heliopolis, called the \"Water of Re,\"\" doubtless at some point near its departure from the Nile. Here, at a place called Hatsho (b ' t-S ' t), in the early part of the twelfth month of his eleventh year, Ramses defeated them in a disastrous battle, in which Keper was captured and his son Meshesher killed. Ramses pursued the routed enemy over eleven milesb aThe name of the herd of Amon in Papyrus Harris, 10, 8 (5 224), shows that the battle was fought near this canal. bIf the terminus of this eleven miles is the margin of the Libyan desert, the point on that margin must be well south in the narrow part of the Delta; other- wise it would be more than eleven miles from the canal of Heliopolis to the Libyan"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"50 TWENTIETH DYNASTY: RAMSES 111 [g 84 westward as far as his own town, on a rise of ground called ''The - Tom -of - Usermare-Meriamon -Which - is-upm - the - Mounta-of-the-Horns-of-the-Earth.\" He slew 2,175 men, and took 2,052 prisoners, of whom 558 were women and girls; among these were the survivors of the household of the hostile chief. Returning, flushed with victory, Ramses indulged in the usual triumphal celebrations.

The narrative then begins with the invasion of Egypt (8 95, 11. 23, 24), followed by Ramses' attack (§ 96, ll. 24-27), the capture of Keper, the father of the Meshwesh chief (8 97, 11. 27-30), the defeat of the enemy (8 98, 11. 30-32); and the poem concludes with Ramses' victorious return (§ 99, 11. 33, 34)- Dale 94.

These scenes are of the conventional order, but furnish some facts that are new, regarding the campaign. Some of the accompanying inscriptions also are of the great- est importance; e. g., the short line over the battle scene, giving the limits of the pursuit (8 102). The long inscrip- tion over the same scene (is 103, 104) is almost exclusively laudation of the Pharaoh for his prowess, but mentions aMeaning the Pharaoh. bMeaning doubtless Keper and his son; the latter is mentioned ($ go, 1. I I), and his name given as Meshesher. Our narrative describes the capture of his old father, who afterward appears in the list of 'captives as \"chief of the Meshwesh, 'I man,\" but without name appended (Q 111). In the inscription belonging to the battle the son is said to have been killed (8 go, 11. 11, IZ), and the father driven pinioned before the Pharaoh's horses. He is depicted so pinioned in the line of foreign chiefs on the pavilion (8 114, No. 6). cDe Rouge's copy here inserts the words: \"in their ploce.\" dThe head of the conquered foe, perhaps the Libyan chief.

The closing section (5 105, 1. 24) also furnishes the date of the battle, between the tenth and twentieth of the twelfth month in the year 11.

In the conventional manner the king is shown charg- ing the enemy in his chariot, in which he stands with drawn bow. Two lines of Egyptian chariots accompany him, with occasional bodies of infantry; and the enemy, driven before them, or falling pierced by the king's arrows, are scattered in the wildest confusion, as the king drives over the fallen. 102.

CSome such words must have begun this title of the charge; but some six or eight words have really heen lost, for some early vandal has cut out a large rectangle here, carrying away a third of this little inscription. This important line was overlooked by Diimichen in his first publication; but appeared in his Photogra~hiscke Resultate (PI. 26), too small to be read. It was used by Brugsch in his Geographic (35, 36), where he misunderstood the portion he published (PI. IV, No. 242). He then ~ublished it entire in the Wiistwbwh (Supplement, 164)~ and in Aegyp- tologie (472); again by Levy, Recueil, IS, 171. dThis town, the name of which means \"House of Sand,\" is depicted on the north wall (5 107). It was a stronghold on the western road, 8 iters from the edge of the plateau.

The invasion from Asia RIinor had broken the strength of the North-Syrian peoples. Ramses I11 therefore improved the opportunity to invade them. The reliefs show him storming no less than five strong cities. One of them is called \"the city of Amor,\" with perhaps the name of the city lost at the end; two others are defended by Hittites; a fourth is surrounded by water, and is, therefore. thought to be Kadesh; the fifth stands on high ground, but offers no other characteristic by which it might be identified. aRelief on the fa~ade of the left wing of the pavilion; published by Champol- lion, Monuments, 202 =Rosellini, Monumenti Storici, 142 = Lepsius, Denkmder, 111, 209, a; pendant to the similar relief on the other wing (g 12~)."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"5 1181 MEDINET HABU: SYRIAN W.4R 69 116.

The question of the date of this campaign will be found discussed in § § 132, I 33. 117.

This document is the pendant of the one of the year I I (0 0 93-99). It is dated in the year I 2, and the presence of the date would indicate that it records some specific occur- rence; but it is difficult to determine what this occurrence was from our inscription, as it is copied from that of Ramses I1 at Abu Simbel (111, 394-414). 133. This brings up the whole question of the date of the Amorite war. The arrangement of the records in the Medi- net Habu temple in chronological order from rear to front is so evident that the location of those reporting the Amorite war is of the first importance. We find them all (with one exception) on walls in front of-that is, later than-the second pylon (bearing records of the year 8), and among records of the Libyan war of the year I I. Had the Amorite campaign immediately followed the defeat of the sea-peoples in the year 8, it is certain that the very full records of that year would have contained some reference to it. But the long row of scenes depicting the campaign of the year 8 (outside north wall) contains nothing from the Amorite war, and the arrangementb of the whole wall clearly indicates that the Amorite war is at least as late as the year 11. But as the second Libyan war occurred in that year, the Amorite war would have probably been later. We have to remember, ahscription at Medinet Habu temple of Ramses 111, cut into the front of the first pylon, on the south (left) tower, just at the left of the entrance. It exactly matches in form and size the inscription of year 11 ($a 93-99) on the right of the entrance.

But he is here in company with'a Libyan king, and as we cannot suppose that the Amorite war occurred as early as the year 5 (first Libyan war), it is evident that this Libyan king was taken in the Libyan war of year 11, when Ramses I11 actually did capture a Libyan king ($97), whereas no such capture is mentioned in the records of the year 5. Thus this relief on the treasury again connects the Amorite war with the Libyan war of year 11. They must thus have occurred close together, from the testimony of the reliefs. 134. Returning now to our monument, copied, as we have stated, from an Abu Simbel stela of Ramses 11, we find that the slight changes in it, necessary to suit the times of Ramses 111, are not in favor of the above conclusion. Especially is this true in one case, where Ramses II's stela refers to the Hittites thus, (Ptah speaks) : \"I have made for thee the land of Kheta into subjects of thy palace\" (111, 410). Here Ramses 111's redactor has changed \"Kheta\" into \"every land;\" although, according to the reliefs and the lists, Ramses I11 must have fought the Hittites. The relief at the top of our stela contains a list of names of three African and ten Syrian towns, a.ccompanying thirteen Asiatic (sic !) prisoners, and Miillera refers the latter without hesitation to the Amorite war. The presence of the African names with Asiatic figures would lead one to suspect this list to be nothing more than decorative. Against this stela one must now weigh the evidence of the reliefs, which seems to me conclusive for dating the Amorite war in or shortly after the year I I. This conclusion is thus reached rather in spite of than because of our stela. aMiiller, Asien und Ewopa, 394 (\"S. 227\")."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"80 TWENTIETH DYNASTY: RAMSES I11 [8 135 135. All changes in the version of Ramses I1 have been indicated in the footnotes to the translation of the Abu Simbel stela (111, 594-414), which may therefore serve in place of a repetition of the document here. The relief at the top shows Ramses 111, \"smiting the chiefs of dl countries\" in the presence of Ptah-Tatenen, who presents to him a sword, and leads up thirteen Asiatic cap- tives, represented in the conventional form with ovals, the first three of which contain the names of African places. VI. THE NUBIAN WAR 136. The materials for this war, like those of the Amorite war, are solely relief scenes. These permit no definite con- clusions regarding it. Nubia had now been so thoroughly Egyptianized that Ramses 111's war or wars there were doubtless confined to quelling unimportant insurrections on the extreme southern frontier, or to expeditions against the outlying tribes on the east of Nubia. Besides the material below, see also the Nubian chiefs represented with the Meshwesh chief captured in the year r I, on the pavilion (8 I 14).

It had meantime been expanded by Seti I (111, 113-18); his version was now slightly elaborated by Ra.mses III.b His additions, however, contain nothing of historical importance.

It was intended to secure to the departed Pharaoh the favor of all the gods in the hereafter, by showing them his numerous benefactions in all their temples, and his great deeds among men. Prayers for the king's well-being in the world beyond continually appeal to these good works as ground for the favor of the gods, on whose good-will the king's happiness after death depends. Ramses IV, the son to whom the document clearly owes its preparation, does not forget to put into his deceased father's mouth long prayers in his own (the son's) behalf, entreating for him from the gods, whose companion the departed king now is, a long and prosperous reign. So prominent are these prayers for Ramses IV that they must also have formed a strong motive for the preparation of the document by him.\" 153. The document is dated on the day of the king's deathjb as will be evident from the following considerations: The long lists of gifts cover thirty-one years; all annual traditional feasts of all the temples recorded were celebrated thirty-one times. It is thus evident that Ramses I11 died so early in the year 32 that the small fraction of gifts presented during the beginning of that year were not considered; nor did the king survive long enough in the year 32 to cele- brate any of its feasts. To this last observation there is one exception: a certain feast founded by Ramses I11 himself was celebrated in the year 32. It began on the aIn precisely the same way the deceased Seti I prays for his son, Ramses I1 (111, 280); and we find the latter petitioning his deceased father to pray to the gods, whose companion he (the father) now is, for his (the son's) welfare (111, 279). bThis was long ago recognized by Birch (Zeitschrift fur agyptiscke Sprache, 1872, 119 ff.), although his data, as he took them from the papyrus, were seriously in error. But, this conclusion of Birch has since been entirely overlooked, and and it has been generally held that the papyrus was written and dated some time before the king's death, although it over and over again, with all the euphemisms known to the Egyptians, states that he was already dead.

This feast must therefore have fallen early in the year 32, and the king lived at least twenty days of that year. Now, in Ramses 111's calendar of feasts at Medinet Habu the feast of the anniversary of his coronation is recorded as beginning on the twenty-sixth of Pakhonsa (ninth month), so that the twenty-day feast in our papyrus is the celebration of the coronation anniversary; its first day, the twenty-sixth of Pakhons, is the first day of each year of the reign. This feast, which began the year 32, the old king celebrated in that year; but no more. When the Feast of the Nile-god,b which fell just ninety-five days after the close of the Feast of Coronation, was celebrated, the Pharaoh had been gathered to his fathers, for the papyrus records this feast no later than the year 31. We have thus fixed the date of the king's death within ninety-five days, and the papyrus is dated on the sixth of Epiphi, which falls within that period. 154. When, furthermore, we remember that the papyrus continually represents the king as stating that he is deceased, it is evident that the date at the head of the' document is that of the king's death, the last date which could be recorded in his reign.

CThat Ramses I11 ruled in round numbers thirty-one years is also shown by the Papyrus Mallet (Recueil, I, PI. I, 11. 2, 3), which contains a statement of pay- ments made \"from year 31 to year 3, making 4 years.\" Had Ramses 111 led far into year 32, the above limits would have included more than four years; but the scribe ignores the forty days of year 32. There is no coregency with Ramses IV here (Maspero, Struggle of the Nations, 480); and the dates as they stand are clear proof that there was never any coregency at all. Still less is there a shadow of proof that the coregency lasted four years (Maspero, Struggle of the Nations, 481), making Ramses 111 reign thirty-six years.

One of these scribes was perhaps also the artist of the three vi- gnettes. The haste with which the document was compiled is evident both from the fact that some of the greatest of the minor temples are entirely omitted, and from the nu- merous errors in the footings of the lists, as well as some glaring omissions. It is evident, also, that the scribes at Heliopolis and Memphis were unable to render as full re- ports as that of the Theban scribe; doubtless owing to the shorter time allowed them because of the delay involved in the journey from Thebes with their instructions, and the return thither with the finished report, beforc the day of the king's funeral. The entire omission of many of the more important smaller temples is probably to be accounted for in the same way; their reports failed to arrive in time.b 156.

Each of these sections, except the first and last, is arranged on the same general plan. At the beginning of each of the sections 11, 111, and IV is a vignette, showing the king wor- shiping the gods to whom the following section is devoted. The text of each section is then introduced by a prayer, which merges into a recital of the king's buildings and other benefactions for the god, concluding with an appeal to him, calling attention to the following lists. These lists contain six different classes of material: (I) the god's estate; (2) his income; (3) the king's new gifts to him; (4) grain for the old feasts; (5) offerings for new feasts founded by him; and (6) offerings to the Nile-god. 158. The statement that the first class of material con- stitutes the god's estate will need some demonstration. It is clear that the papyrus enumerates old income of the god merely confirmed to him by Ramses 111, in the offerings of grain for the old annual feasts like that of Southern Opet at Thebes (16b, 13-15); for these are not only separated aBold figures indicate the plates of the papyrus."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"$1601 PAPYRUS HARRIS 93 by a rubric from the new feasts founded by Ramses I11 (e. g., 17a-zrb), but they refer distinctly to \"that (income) which zetas before7' (I 6b, 14), which is included in them. If this be true, we inay expect to find old possessions of the god elsewhere in the lists. Thus among the king's gifts we find the statement that he \"made\" for Amon the great vineyard called \"Kanekeme\" (8, 5). Had we no other information regarding this vineyard, we must have supposed that it was a new possession of Amon, equipped and given him by Ramses 111. But we know that it was in existence long before Ramses III's time, and in possession of Ramses 11's mortuary temple, the Ramesseum, also a temple of Amon at Thebes.\" We thus see that Ramses I11 enumerates as his own gifts, property long in the possession of the god before Ramses I11 was born, evidently viewing his con- firmation of it to the god as the conveyance of a gift.b To us it is indifferent whether such confirmation really did constitute a gift; it is enough for us to know that all prop- erty so confirmed was an old possession belonging to the earlier estate of the god. With this fact in mind, let us see if such property as enumerated can be distinguished from the new donations actually given by Ramses 111. 159.

We see that these \"gifts\" are distributed through thirty-one years, while the \"property\"\" of the first heading is, as far as the heading is concerned, each time merely once given, and is never called \"gifts of the king.\" On looking at the lists themselves, under the first and third headings, we find, for example at Heliopolis, lands under both; while at Thebes we find cattle under both. Why were these not put together ? Evidently because some of the land was former \"property\" of the god, while the rest was a \"gift of the king.\" Now, the estate of the god, as Erman has noticed, is of course given as it was found at the king's ,death, using the names then in vogue; hence we find the keepers of a herd named after Ramses 111's victory over the Meshwesh (10, 8) included in the estate. Evidently the 971 Meshwesh slaves who kept this herd were a gift of Ramses 111, and other gifts of his, not discernible because not accidentally so distinguished, are thus, of course, in- cluded in the estate.

To do this, we must compile a condensed summary of their property, taking first the temple estates (see table, p. 97). 166. With these data we can safely deal only in the case of people and land. The cattle are lumped together with- out showing what proportion of sheep, goats, etc., the num- bers contain. We do not know the size of the gardens and groves, or towns; nor the size and value of the ships and workshops. But with the people belonging to the temples, and the lands, we can operate with tolerable precision, as compared with our former total lack of data. The popu- lation of Egypt up to within the last five or six years was reckoned at toward six millions, but the latest census places aFor example, Amon owns but nine Syrian towns, and we know that Thut- mose 111 alone gave Amon three Syrian towns (11, 557)."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"CLASSIFICATION OF THE PROPERTY OF THE TEMPLES I I I I , 11.

The political significance of these lists largely attaches to the question of Amon's share in them. The estate of the god embraced over 10 per cent. of the lands of Egypt,\" and at most about 14 per cent. of the population, or perhaps even a little less than I per cent. This meant a fortune in land of over five times that of Heliopolis, and over nine times that of Memphis, while in people the dis- proportion was still greater. That this disproportion was due solely to Ramses 111 is impossible. If we are correct in concluding that the above income was derived from Ramses 111's new endowments, there is nothing in these figures which would indicate that Amon's vast wealth was due to Ramses 111 alone. Amon's annual income in gold, of which the other temples received none, is something less than 26,000 grains. Of other items Amon received roughly: I 7 times as much silver; 21 times as much copper; 3 times as many garments; 2 times as much incense, honey, and oil; 9 times as much shedeh and wine; 13 times as much grain; 10 times as much flax; 8 times as many water- fowl; 7 times as many cattle; about the same number of geese; 10 times as many ships; as all the other temples combined. This disproportion, if maintained through the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, would account for the enormous wealth of Am~n;~ but that wealth was not the result of the donations of one reign. 172.

This list shows immensely more gold, silver, copper, garments, cattle, grain, and land given to the other temples than to Amon, while it is only in a few less valuable com- modities that Amon is in the lead. Even including Amon's income with the above gifts, Heliopolis was yearly receiving twice as much gold as Thebes from all sources. Amon's superiority is, however, in the aggregate decidedly main- tained, as a combination of the income and the gifts shows. It is evident also that, while the gifts of land to other temples have been enumerated in this list, the lands given to Amon are not included here, but are counted in Amon's estate, as it was also clear from the names of the herds that the cattle given Amon were to some extent included in the estate. In using the list of gifts, therefore, it must not be forgotten that in the items of land and cattle it is incomplete, and that it is in~possible to determine exactly the extent of Ramses 111's gifts in these two forms of property. But, judging from those gifts of which we are able to determine the amount, the wealth of .Amon in Ramses 111's day, was not due to his donations, nor can we aver that the fortune of Amon of necessity constituted such a menace to the state as alone to threaten its overthrow-a conclusion now current, and everywhere accepted. 174. An important question suggested by these lists is the relation of income and expenditure. The following tables indicate the total income of three great temples in grain : GRAIN FOR OLD FEASTS DURING TEIIRTY-ONE YEARS Thebes Heliopolis Memphis Small temples 2,981,674 16-fold heket 1,097,624 \" < L 947,688 \" cc Not given"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"106 TWENTIETH DYNASTY: RAMSES I11 [5 175 The total annual income in grain was therefore as follows: Thebes { For the old feasts 96,183 16-fold heket Income (from Ramses 111) 9,998 \" (6 Total 106,181 \" (6 1 For the old feasts 35,407 \" Id Heliopolis For the offerings to the Nile 3,598\" \" (L Income (from Ramses 111) 2,487 \" (6 Total 41,492 LL I( For the old feasts 30,570 '( (1 For the offerings to the Nile I,PII~ \" (6 Income (from Ramses 111) 1,207 \" CL Total 32,988 \" L 6 17s. From these figures it will be seen how far the income of Ramses I11 was from furnishing enough grain for the old feasts. They must have been drawn from the old in- come, which, in view of the vast extent of the temple lands, was greatly in excess of these amounts contributed to the offerings. Erman suggests that the Surplus was used in building Ramses 111's temples,' like that at Medinet Habu, Karnak, and other places. But the question arises whether it was not consumed in the maintenance of the other temples of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties. We know that some of the Eighteenth Dynasty Theban temples, like that of Amenhotep I11 behind the Memnon colossi, had already perished at the vandal hands of the Nineteenth Dynasty kings. We can understand, too, how the mortu- ary temples, which were so largely the personal sanctuaries of earlier Pharaohs, might be desecrated.

This brings up the question: What Theban temples are known to the papyrus as sharing in Amon's income and Ramses III's bounty? They are referred to in three differ- ent places: the narrative of buildings and good works (§§ 189-214), the list of people (QQ 223, 224), and the in- come (§ 227) ; and they include six different temples: No. I.

From this it is evident that the income and the people of the great Karnak temple must be included else- where. When we notice that the Medinet Habu temple is credited with 62,626 people (10, 3), or three-fourths of all the people belonging to Amon, it is evident where the people belonging to the Karnak temple are to be found. Again, when we see that the people attached to the Khonsu-temple aThe Luxor temple is omitted, and yet Ramses I11 built n chapel on the river side of this temple. The lower part of a sandstone stela (Recueil, 16, 55, 56), used in antiquity to prop a falling statue of Ramses I1 at Luxor, contains a record of building by Ramses I11 in the same temple: \"Ramses ZIZ, doubling offerings in Luxw. . . . . . maker of monuments, profitable to him that begat him. . . . . building a house in Luxor on the right of his augztst father, Amon-Re. . . . . .

Indeed, this common estate is unequivocally men- tioned, for we find the five herds belonging to the five temples of No. 3 spoken of as \"the five herds made for this house\" (~zu, 3, 4). \"This house,\" therefore, comprised the property of five different temples, and beyond doubt desig- nates the estate of Amon, irrespective of the different temples among which it was divided.

This fact once established for Thebes, the same may be true of Heliopolis and Memphis; and the vast income of these great sanctuaries, which we may compute from the temple lands, may have been distributed among far more temples than those mentioned in the papyrus. This dis- tribution of income we cannot control (even if it were all counted in each case as income of the chief sanctuary alone), because the income lists evidently contain only a part of the income, as we have already shown; and the outgo covers only the maintenance of feasts, not the support of the great army of priests and officials.\" This discussion of the lists might be carried much farther, but doubtless the subject is above sufficiently introduced to make the importance and proper significance of the lists evident. 181.

It is especially instructive, despite its obscurity, in its account of the anarchy preceding the rise of Ramses 111's father.

This feast was at first only one day long, but in the year 22 it was made twenty days long. bAs this feast fell within the 40 days during which Ramses I11 survived in his thirty-second year, it was, therefore, celebrated in that year also; but none of the old feasts, as he did not survive to celebrate them in the thirty-second year. cThis feast was not 27 days long, throughout the reign, but only 24 at first (see Breasted, Zeitschrift fur agyptische Sprache, 37, 126, where this passage in Harris was not yet noted). Under Thutmose I11 it lasted only II days (ibid.); it was an old feast, but because Ramses I11 lengthened it he includes it among feasts founded by himself. As he lengthened it from 24 to 27 days, it is not likely that the lengthening from 11 to 24 days was also due to him. If lengthened further in later times, it was prolonged at the end, for in the Twenty-first Dynasty it still began on the nineteenth.

Ramses 111's stela is dated in Phamenoth of the sixth year, and, like Ramses 11, he celebrated the two feasts on the fifteenth of Thoth and the fifteenth of Epiphi (Lepsius, Denkmaler, 111, 218, d, 1. 15). a1 am unable to explain this addition: \"making 31 years,\" unless it is a dittog- raphy from the end of the 1.4.

Fragmentary and brief as these documents are, they afford a glimpse into the court intrigues and conspiracies if the Orient three thousand and two hundred years ago, which is as picturesque and interesting as it is important. Here are all the materials for a novel or a drama, with the full dramatis personae all present. The first question which arises is: Against whom was the conspiracy, here unfolded, directed? The king who empowers the prosecuting court to try the conspirators is called \"ruler of Heliopolis\" (5 423), a terni applied to several kings, but especially to Ramses 111. One of the conspirators, in the course of their machinations, secured a \"magic roll of Ramses 111 . . . . his lord.\" It is clear, then, that the conspiracy was directed against this king, and, as we shall see, toward the close of his reign. One of his queen^,^ named Tiy, plots to make way with the old king and to place her son Pentewerec upon the throne. aThese records are contained in two documents: (a) the Judicial Papyrus of Turin; and (b) Papyrus Lee and Papyrus Rollin, both parts of one document. The Judicial Papyrus of Turin is a magnificent document, containing six columns, the first being but a mere fragment of the ends of all the Iines. The papyrus roll is about twenty inches high, the letters about an inch to an inch and a quarter high, and the horizontal lines are two inches apart. It was published, and for that time well treated, by DevEria in the Journal asiatique, in 1865-68, (but see Chabas' valuable corrections, Milunges d'archkologie igyptienne, 3- sQ., Tome I, 5-47), and again revised by the author, as a \"tirage b part\" in 1868. The last was republished in the author's collected works (Biblwth2que 6gyptologique, V). Papyrus Lee contains the lower part of two columns, published by Sharpe (Egyptian Inscriptions, 11, 47, 48) in 1855; shortly after by Lee (Hartwell House Catalogue, P1. 11); by Chabas, Papyrus Magique, Harris, 169-74; and M6langes $archt?ologie 6gyptienne, I, g, 10; by Devgria, op. cit.; and by Newberry (Amherst Papyri, P1. I1 and 111, and pp. 19-22); Papyrus Rollin (No. 1888) in the Biblio- thdque Nationale at Paris contains one short but complete column, published by Chabas, op. cit., by DevQia, op. cit., and by Pleyte, Les Papyrus Rollin, P1.

The former procured from the overseer of the royal herds, Penhuibin, a number of magic wax figures of gods and men, which were able, in the belief of the owner, to disable or enfeeble the limbs of people. Two other men furnished similar materials, which were smuggled into the harem, and by such agencies the conspirators were empowered, as they thought, to disable or evade the people of the guard, who might otherwise have discovered and betrayed the plot. 417. Pebekkamen and Mesedsure secured the co-opera- tion of ten harem officials of various ranks, four royal butlers, an overseer of the treasury named Pere, a captain of archers in Nubia named Binemwese, who was inveigled by the influ- ence of a sister of his in the harem; Peyes, a commander of the army, three royal scribes in various offices, Pebekka- men's assistant, and several subordinate officials. As most of these people were in the personal service of the Pharaoh, the dangerous character of the complot is evident. Six wives of the officers of the harem-gate were used in securing the transmission of messages, and outside relatives of the inmates, not mentioned by name, are clearly implicated. Binemwese's sister sent him a letter urging him to incite the people to hostility against the king, and such was the pur- port of all the messages which left the harem. Evidently a revolution outside of the palace was intended to accompany their own coup within it. That the latter involved the assassination of the king is nowhere stated, but is self- evident. 418.

The king ordered their prosecution,"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"210 TWENTIETH DYNASTY: RAMSES I11 10 419 but before they came to trial he died.\" It would almost appear that he knew his days were numbered when he gave instructions for the prosecution of the conspirators, for at the close of the commission constituting the special court there- for, he uses the remarkable words: (Go on with the prosecu- tion, etc.), \"while I am protected and defended forever, while I am ramolzgl the just kings who are before Amon-Re . . . . and before Osiris, ruler of eternity;\" that is, while I am among my deceased fathers. That the plot went so far that the king was injured, and survived his injuries only long enough to direct the prosecution of his assassins, is improb- able, in view of a remark in the records, that Re did not per- mit the hostile plans to s~cceed;~ but we may easily believe that it hastened the old king's end, even if he escaped unscathed. 419. The court commissioned to try the conspirators received its instructions directly from the king, and was given not only full discretion as to the verdict, but also final power to execute punishment, which was otherwise usually fixed by the Pharaoh after trial ($541). At the same time Ramses cautioned the judges to be certain of guilt, by the usual procedure in every case, and to punish none but the guilty. The court, thus constituted with such unusual powers, consisted of fourteen officials, viz., two overseers of the treasury, two standard-bearers of the army, seven royal butlers, a royal herald, and two scribes. Among them were a Libyan, a Lycian, a Syrian named Maharbaal (\"Baal hastens\"), and another foreigner, Kedendenna by name, of uncertain nationality.

In the documents containing the above facts, the chief conspirators are given fictitious names, indicative of the abhorrence in which they were held. Thus Mesedsure means \"Re hates him,\" and Binemwese is \"WicKed ilt Thebes.\" Pentewere, the name applied to the guilty prince, who was in all probability only an unfortunate tool, is not a term of opprobrium, but is not his real name (Col. V, 1. 7, Q 447). 422. As to the character of the following records, the first document (Turin) omits the evidence, and is, therefore, not a full record of the trials, but forms merely an abstract of the proceedings, evidently for filing in the royal archives.

BUILDlNG INSCRIPTIONS 488. In continuance of the privilege already gained by the high priests of Amon under the Pharaohs of the end of the Nineteenth Dynasty, Amenhotep, High Priest under Ramses IX, undertook the rebuilding of the High Priest's dwelling, connected with the Karnak temple of Amon. It had been erected by Sesostris I, some eight hundred years earlier. The kitchen, or refectory, had been solidly rebuilt by Roy, nearly a hundred years before, but the dwelling itself was now in a ruinous state. It stood on the south of the sacred lake (1. 7), east of the southern pylons, and its scanty remains were found there by Mariette.b At the east end of the neighboring pylon (VIII), by the similar record of Roy (111, 619-26), Amenhotep inscribed the following recordc of his building: bSee Mariette, Karnak, 11. This must be the strange building south of the lake (Mariette's plan, P1. 2, R), the purpose of which was left uncertain by Mari- ette. He afterward (op cit., 62, 63) suggests this building as the one meant in our inscription, but strangely states that our inscription furnishes no indication of the location of the building, although it clearly states that the building overlooked the southern lake (1. 7).

Such impost is now placed directly in the hands of the High Priest, who can collect it irom the people into the temple treasury, without its passing through the royal treasury. This enactment was either twice recorded, or it was repeated and made more sweeping in its scope; for Amenhotep has twice represented the scene of his royal rewards on the tem- ple walls, each time accompanied by this enactment of the king, though in varying lang~age.~ In both scenes, con- trary to the immemorial custom that the representations of the king should show him of heroic stature, towering far above his court and officers; the High Priest is here repre- sented with the same heroic figure as the king.

The riches lying in the royal tombs, in the form of splendid regalia adorning the dead, rich coffins, and elaborate furni- ture, which had been accumulating for five hundred years, furnished an irresistible motive for the violation of such tombs. How far the corrupt officials, by indirect con- nivance, may have been involved in such robberies we can- not now determine. In our first document there are indica- tions that all was not as it should have been among the officials of the government. Their apparent helplessness, and total inability properly to protect the necropolis, how- ever interpreted, are clear evidence of the decadence in gov- ernment now in progress. A coffin in the British Museum, doubtless of this age, furnishes significant evidence of the conditions in the Theban necropolis, as shown by the follow- ing remark, \" recorded upon it by a scribe : Year 3, fourth month of the first season, day I 5; day of renewing the burial of Osiris, Tesitnakht (T ' -s ' ' t-rtht) ; after it had been found, the children of the cemetery having taken its coffins and violated the name thereof.

The west side was, like- wise, under the control of a second mayor, who was also responsible for the necropolis. Under Ramses IX he was a certain Pewero. Peser, mayor of the east side, had in some way gained information of robberies among the royal tombs and he promptly handed in his information to the vizier, as aBritish Museum coffin, No. 15659; Budge, Catalogue of the Egyptian Col- lection in the Fitnvilliam Mzlseum, Cambridge, 189.3, 18.

The duty was probably not an unwelcome one, for he seems to have had no love for his rival, Pewero, whose administration of the necropolis he was thus able to compromise. 501. Pursuant to this information, the vizier sent a com- mission to inspect the cemetery, on the eighteenth of Hathor, in the sixteenth year of Ramses IX. Their report covered ten royal tombs, four tombs of the singing-women of the Amon-temples, and a number of tombs of the nobles and people, the exact number of which is not stated. The last were all found to have been plundered; two of the four tombs of the singing-women were in the same condition; but of the royal tombs, only one, that of Sebekemsaf, had been robbed, although two had been unsuccessfully mined into by the robbers. The part of the royal cemetery visited was the district of Drali abu-'n-Neggah, on the northern margin of the western plain of Thebes, and the royal tombs inspected were those of the Eleventh, Thirteenth, Seven- teenth, and early Eighteenth Dynasties. The report on them, besides being historically valuable, affords a most interesting glimpse into the royal cemetery at this time. Perhaps the most remarkable reference in it is the descrip- tion of the stela of Intef 1's pyramid, hearing in relief the figure of the king, with his hound Behka between his feet (5 514, 11. 9-11). This very stela was found by Mariette still bearing the figure of the king, and the hound with the name Behka inscribed beside it (I, 421 ff.), as described in the report of three thousand years ago. 502.

A similar test applied to a coppersmith who had confessed to robbing the tomb of Queen Isis, wife of Ramses 111, indicated that the man knew nothing of this queen's tomb, and had evidently confessed that he might be momen- tarily relieved of the torture. As a matter of fact, the tomb of Queen Isis had been robbed by eight thieves, who can hardly be any other than the eight robbers of Sehckemsaf's tomb, although this fact was not discovered until the next year (45 542, 543). Then followed an inspection of \"The Place of Beazrty,\" a portion of the cemetery where the fam- ilies of the Pharaohs were buried; they were found to be uninjured. Regarding the royal tombs as the most impor- tant, the officials of the necropolis considered the fact that nine of the ten reported robbed were found uninjured, as a great victory for the administration of the necropolis. They therefore sent the whole body of the necropolis em- ployees over to the east side as an embassy of triumph. Some of these rejoicing subordinates went to the house of the mayor of the east side, Peser, who had furnished the information against them to the vizier, and loudly exulted before his door. Meeting three of them in the streets in the evening, Peser was unable to control his anger and, in the presence of witnesses, quarreled with them, told them their inspection of the necropolis was a farce, and accused them vaguely in grave charges, of which he said he was about to send notice to the Pharaoh. This was irregular, as all such charges could legally be reported only to the vizier. 503. Hearing of his enemy's charges immediately, Pewero"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Q 5051 RECORDS OF ROYAL TOMB-ROBBERIES 249 was quick to see the opportunity of again humiliating Peser. He reported the whole affair in a long letter to the vizier, dated the next day, the twentieth of Hathor. The vizier called the case the following morning, the twenty-first of Hathor, and, incensed at Peser's reflections upon an inspection which had been sent out from his office and par- tially conducted by him, the vizier quickly brought the pro- ceedings to a close by summoning the three coppersmiths whom Peser had accused of robbing the ten royal tombs, and placed them at the disposition of the court; at the same time introducing the evidence of his own personal knowledge, gained on his visit to the necropolis. The unhappy Peser, who was himself a judge, and sitting on the bench with his colleagues in this case, was obliged to see the coppersmiths acquitted in their examination, which now followed. Whether he suffered any penalty for his indiscretion is not evident, but his allegations regarding the cemetery were all declared untrue, while the vague charges which he had threatened to make to the Pharaoh were ignored, as they had no legal status at all, unless presented in writing before the vizier. 504. It is clear that the state of affairs in the cemetery was sufficiently bad to justify charges against the officials of the necropolis, and although all the tombs indicated by Peser had not been robbed, the investigation had overlooked the robbery of at least one tomb, that of Queen Isis, so that the action of the vizier in completely exonerating Pewero was not justifiable, and arouses the suspicion that there was some reason for such action not apparent on the surface. It certainly was not calculated to preserve the royal burials from similar depredations in the future. 505. The results were, therefore, what might have been anticipated. Three years later, in the nineteenth year of"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"250 TWENTIETH DYNASTY: RAMSES IX [$so6 Ramses IX, just after he had associated with himself his son Ramses X as coregent, Pewero, the mayor of the West, who had learned wisdom, handed in to the vizier a list of sixteen people to be tried for robbery in the necropolis; while less than two months later he reported twenty-nine more, whom we find on the docket. Twenty days later sixa of these men were convicted of robbing the tombs of Seti I and Ramses 11. This robbery, therefore, carries us for the first timeb from the western plain of Thebes to the Valley of the King's Tombs behind the western cliffs. The robberies were, therefore, spreading from the modest pyramids of the kings just before and after the Twelfth Dynasty in the plain, to the magnifi- cent and, of course, more richly equipped cliff-tombs of the great emperors in the valley behind. Five more men were tried two days later and found innocent. 506. Eight months now elapsed without apparent dis- turbance among the royal tombs; but the usual contingent of tomb-robbers then appears on the court docket, this time numbering twenty-two persons (two women), who had robbed \"the tomb of Ptzaraoh.\" Which royal tomb is thus designated we do not know, but a thief, whose confession follows the above list of names, states that he robbed the tomb of a Queen Nesimut, and also that of Queen Bekurel, wife of Seti I. Twenty-seven days later a long list of rob- bers, the wives of eleven of whom were also implicated, and imprisoned, fills the docket, and a fragmentary record of uncertain date refers to the robbery of the tomb of Amen- hotep 111. 507.

When Pharaohs like Ramses I1 and Merneptah were guilty of wholesale appropriation of the mortuary equipment of their great ancestors, the officials were naturally not above conniving at similar robberies for their own profit. The occasional prose- cution and conviction of the \"small fry\" were, therefore, of no avail. Such were the conditions under the last three Kamessids in the royal cemetery at Thebes. The pious, and evidently sincere, efforts put forth on behalf of the royal bodies at the close of the Twentieth and the beginning of the Twenty-first Dynasties (§ $595 ff ., 636 ff .) saved them from destruction only after they had been bereft of their splendid furniture and stripped of their rich regalia, by the thieves whose prosecution is narrated in the following documents. So persistent and thorough was their work of plunder that of all the Pharaohs buried at Thebes, only one, A~nenhotep 11, has been found still in his sarcophagus in his own tomb. Rut his body had, in ancient times, already been stripped of all valuables. The tomb was securely closed with an iron grating and locked door by the modern government of Egypt, and the body of the great king left undisturbed in its ancient resting-place, where it had slept 3,400 years. 508. Hearing rumors of fabulous wealth on the person of their great ancestor, the tomb-robbers of modern Thebes, doubtless with the connivance of the necropolis guard, forced the tomb door, entered, and subjected the body of Amenhotep 11, after an interval of three thousand years, to a second rifling, which was to all appearances entirely fruit- less.

Mr. Carter's official reporta on the whole matter is a striking modern commentary on the ancient conditions exposed in the following documents, and forms the last chapter in the long and dramatic history of the royal tombs at Thebes. 509. This document is really the vizier's abstract, taken from his files, recording the case between the two mayors, Peser and Pewero, as narrated above (95 499-504). The condition of the royal necropolis is, therefore, only incidental to the demonstration of the truth or falsity of Peser's charges against the necropolis administration. The whole case is concluded with the defeat of Peser, recorded at the end. The conditions in the necropolis, revealed in the document, led the scribe to consult it again after it had been lying for three years in the vizier's files, and on this occasion he recorded upon the back of the roll a list of tomb-robbers then awaiting trial, which had been handed in by Pewero, the mayor of the West.

This unique document is our most important source for the position of Egypt in Syria at the close of the Twentieth Dynasty. It belongs to the fifth year of the last of the Ramessids, when he is but the shadow of a king. Hrihor, the High Priest of Amon, although not called king, is in control at Thebes, and Nesubenebded (Smendes), after- ward the first king of the Twenty-first Dynasty, living at Tanis, rules the Delta. Under these circumstances Hrihor dispatches one of his officials, named Wenamon, to prdcure cedar from the Lebanon forests, for the construction of a new sacred barge for Amon. In accordance with an oracle of Amon, the messenger was intrusted with a certain image of the god called \"Amon-of-the-Wuy,\" which he was to take with him as an embassy to the prince of Byblos. As the envoy met with extraordinary difficulties in the execution of his commission, he made out an elaborate reportt on his return home to explain the long series of accidents which apapyrus found in 1891 by fellahin at el Khibeh, opposite Feshn in Upper Egypt, now in the possession of M. W. Golinischeff, of St. Petersburg. It consists of a part of one column, and another almost complete. It was published in tran- scription by M. Golinischeff in a collection of essays in honor of Baron V. de Rosen's jubilee, with a facsimile of the first twenty-one lines; and again by GolCn- ischeff in revised transcription (Recueil, XXI), with translation. It was translated without alteration of Gol6nischeff's arrangement of the fragments, by W. M. Miiller (Mittheilungen der Delctschen Vorderasiatischen Gesellschaft, 1900, I); and by Erman (Zeitschrift fiir agyptische Sprache, 38, 1-14) with a rearrangement of the fragments which seems to me unquestionably correct. The following translation, based largely on Erman, I published first in the American Journal of Semitic Lan.guuges and Literatures, 1905. bThat our document is Wenamon's authentic report there seems to me, after a study of its characteristics, not the slightest doubt; but there is not space here to discuss the question.

Arrived at Dor, the gold and silver which he had brought with him as payment for the timber was stolen from him. 1)or was now a petty kingdom of the Thekel, who, with the I'eleset-Philistines, had begun entering Syria under Ramses 111 seventy-five or eighty years before. They had con- stantly pushed southward after their defeat by Ramses I11 in his eighth year, and had settled along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean as subjects of the Pharaoh. After the death of Ramses 111 they must have soon gained their inde- pendence. The Thekel chief of Dor gives Wenamon little satisfaction for the loss of his valuables, and after waiting nine days he sails northward to Tyre. 559. The account of the voyage from Dor to Tyre is lost in a lacuna. On the way from Tyre to Byblos he in some way met some of the Thekel with a bag ( ?) of silver. It weighed thirty deben, and, as he had lost thirty-onea deben of silver, he seized it as security.

After nineteen days, one of the noble youths in attendance upon the prince fell into a prophetic frenzy and demanded that Wenamon and his god, \"Amon- of-the-Way,\" be summoned and honorably treated. 560. About to return to Egypt, Wenamon was summoned to Zakar-Baal's palace, but, being without money and with- out credentials, which he had foolishly left with Nesubeneb- ded at Tanis-having only the above-mentioned image of Amon, supposed to confer \"life and health,\" but not likely to impress the Syrian-he was treated with scant respect. The claims of Hrihor and of Amon upon the Lebanon were scouted, and Zakar-Baal proved from his records that his fathers had been paid for their timber. Wenamon therefore sends to Nesubenebded for money, and the prince shows his good-will by dispatching to Egypt at once the heavy timbers of the hull. The messenger returned from Nesubenebded within forty-eight days (perhaps only nineteen or twenty days) with partial payment of the timber desired, whereupon Zakar-Baal sent three hundred men and three hundred oxen to fell and bring the rest of the timber. 561. Some eight months after Wenamon left Thebes the timber was ready. Zakar-Baal delivers it to him, and with grim humor tells him that he has been better treated than the last envoys from Egypt, who were detained at Byblos seven- teen years and died there. The prince charges an attendant to conduct Wenamon to their tomb and show it to him. But Wenamon demurs and takes his leave, promising to see that the balance due on the timber is paid. As he is about to sail, a number of Thekel ships appear, for the purpose of arresting him, doubtless for his seizure of the silver.

In some way he evades the Thekel, but is driven by a contrary wind to Cyprus (Alasa), where he is about to be killed by the Cyprians, when he finds someone who speaks Egyptian, succeeds in gaining the favor of the Cyprian queen, and is spared. 562. Here the remarkable report is broken off, and how Wenamon reached Egypt we do not know. It will be seen that in the Lebanon region, once conquered and controlled by the Pharaohs, they are no longer feared. Thus, at the close of the Twentieth Dynasty Egypt, while respected as a source of civilization (8 579), cannot secure even ordinary protection and civility for her messengers in Syria, and this state of affairs had already existed, probably as early as the reign of Ramses IX, a generation earlier. Besides the earliest known instance of prophetic ecstasy known to us, the document contains also another significant datum, viz., the princes of Byblos had, for two generations, been keeping their daily business records in a book or roll (: r). Moreover, among the gifts brought to the prince of Byblos from the Delta were five hundred rolls of papyrus paper. Of course, the Phcenician did not write cuneiform with pen and ink upon these rolls; for a script worse suited to such writing materials than cuneiform can hardly be imagined. It is evident that he wrote upon papyrus the hieratic hand customarily written upon it in Egpt, the only method of writing then known which contained alphabetic signs for the whole alphabet.

While these volumes are not intended to furnish discussions and reconstructions of the dynasties, the Twenty- first Dynasty is, nevertheless, so unusual in character, that it is impossible to classify the brief and fragmentary docu- ments which it has left us, without some indication of its peculiarities. 605 Already under the last Ramessid (before his fifth year) we have seen, in the report of Wcnamon, that a local dynast of Tanis, Nesubenebded, had assumed the sov- ereignty of the Delta. When Ramses XI1 died and the Twentieth Dynasty was ended, Nesubenebded became king of Lower Egypt, and the founder of the Twenty-first Dynasty of Manetho. At Thebes, the High Priest of Amon, Hrihor, became king of Upper Egypt. Of the Tanite kings we know next to nothing; but we are at least able to follow the high priests at Thebes from generation to generation without a break. They form the only connected thread along which we can trace the course of the dynasty. At Hrihor's death they were not able to maintain thcir royalty, and Nesu- benebded ruled the whole country for a time. Hrihor's grandson, Paynozem I, having, while High Priest, married Makere, the daughter\" of Pesibkhenno I of Tanis, likewise became sole king for a long reign. Otherwise the Tanites were dominant; hut probably not on hostile terms with the high priests, who remained powerful princes, more or less independent, and boasting many of the titles of royalty. 606. Possessing only a few names of Tanite kings in northern monumcnts of their own, we are obliged to turn to Thebes for the materials with which to reconstruct the dynasty. The difficulty with these materials is that they \"See Maspero, Monies royales, &p+8 295"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"296 TWENTY-FIRST DYNASTY [B 607 frequently, indeed prevailingly, record royal dates with only the year, omitting the name of the Tanite king to whom the year belongs.

An asterisk with a number indicates that the king's name accompanies it in the original document; and the dagger, that the name of the High Priest occurs with it. It will be seen that there are only three dates with both. The numbers show that the Twenty-first Dynasty lasted 134+6x years. As one x is the entire reign of Hrihor (Nesubenebded), we must credit it with not less than 145 years. 607.

A modification of Maspero's reconstruction was proposed by Petrie, who proved that Hrihor and Siamon were distinct (Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archeology, XVIII, 59, 60). New material found on the priestly mummies discovered in 1891 confirmed this conclusion. This material was published by Daressy (Revue arch&oZog+ue, 28, 75-78), who furnished further modifications of Maspero's reconstruction, but did not employ all the available material. Another modification was proposed by Tom (Rmue archdologique, 28, 296-g8), who added a new High Priest. The above table agrees in the main with Daressy, but employs all the material and adds some corrections. No com- parison with the data of Manetho is here necessary, as his account of the dynasty is almost worthless. cThe order of these kings is certain, but the connections between them are very loose, so that there is room for an ephemeral king who may be inserted some- where in the second half (especially between Amenemopet and Siamon or Siarnon and Pesibkhenno 11), to make up the seven kings given by Manetho in this dynasty."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"% 6071 TWENTY-FIRST DYNASTY 29 7 PHARAOHSa YEARS HIGH PRIESTS I 7 Zekhonsefonekh (son of King 8* } Paynozem)b Paynozem I 16t Masaheret (son of King Pay- 40 years +x nozem) 4ot Menkheperre-Pesibkhenno (son I of King Paynozem) I 6t 48 years + x Amenemopet 49 years+% Siamon 16~ years +x 7t J Nesubenebded (his son) Paynozem I1 (son of Menkhe- perre) aSee note c, p. 296. bNoticed by Mr. Cecil Torr on a now missing coffin, on which the deceased calls himself: \"son of the High Priest Zekhonsefonekh, son of King Paynozem\" (Revue archCologique, 1896, 28, 298). His position above is not quite certain, but as we do not know who was High Priest in Paynozem 1's seventh and eighth years, he may well fall in that gap. cAs Torr (Revue arch6ologique, 1896, 28, 296ff.) has noticed, Paynozem I1 as High Priest under King Amenemopet calls himself in several places both son of the High Priest Menkheperre and son of King Pesibkhenno, showing that both the latter names belong to the same man. As Menkheperre occurs in a cartouche, e. g. (Revue arch6ologique, 28, 75), and likewise Pesibkhenno in a cartouche is once called High Priest, there is no doubt that Torr is correct in supposing that Menkheperre is the prenomen of Pesibkhenno. He thus assumed royal honors, and may possibly have ruled for a while alone. As he would not assume the throne- name till he had gained the throne, that is, until after Paynozem 1's death, the High Priest Pesibkhenno whom we find in a fourth and twelfth year must be a dif- ferent man. Hence I cannot agree with Tom that this Pesibkhenno is the same as Menkheperre, whose father regularly has the cartouche, while this Pesibkhenno is called simply son of Paynozem (without cartouche). dA graflito at Karnak records year 17 of a king Siamon who may be our above king (Recueil, 22, 51 ff., No. 3 B). eMaspero, Momies ro yules, 725. fRecued, 22, 61, No. 33; a graffito at Karnak; the king's name is almost broken away.

The adytum and rear- most chambers of the temple were built by Ramses I11 and his immediate successors ($0 214, 472). The hypostyle, the court before it, and the pylon were the work of Ramses XI1 and Hrihor, the hypostyle having been built by them both in common, and the court and pylon by Hrihor alone. Hence, in passing from the hypostyle outward to the court, the politi- cal change can be traced on the walls as one goes. We have seen the dedications of Ramses XI1 on the architraves of the hypostyle ($5 601-3).

He appeared before Khonsu with a petition for \"life, prosperity, health, and many good things,\" the bless- ings usually desired; but it is evident that some great event in Hrihor's favor was to take place within a year; though it is not clear what that event was. Khonsu's approval was expressed by numerous nods of the god's head, and news of this was taken to Amon, who also nodded violently in approval, adding the audible promise that he assured Hrihor twenty years, meaning, of course, twenty years' more of power; but whether as king or High Priest is not stated in the scanty fragments preserved. However, it is highly probable that this is the narrative of the divine oracle declaring Hrihor king.

The dynasty thus reigned not less than 200 years in round numbers. But it should be noted that between the twenty-first year of Sheshonk I and the eleventh year of Takelot 11, or a period of 93 years according to the above table, there ruled seven high priests of Amon. This is giv- ing about 13 years to each, and would indicate that the table is within the truth for this period. The second half of the dynasty is nearly certain as to length; the period from the accession of Sheshonk I11 to that of Pemou is exactly known, and the uncertainty chiefly concerns the last two kings, especially Pemou. It should be noted that from the reign of Osorkon I1 (probably toward its end), to the year 37 of Sheshonk IV, there were six generations of high priests at Heracleopolis (8 787, Nos. a! 755. There is no year 29 of Takelot I1 as given by Maspero (Empires, 165, note 2); the year 29 belongs to Sheshonk 111, as correctly seen by Maspero formerly (Momies royales, 741). b!3 778.

The ephemeral reign of Osorkon 11's son Sheshonk (11) was thus a coregency with the father, followed, on Sheshonk 11's death, by a second coregency of the father (Osorkon 11) and the deceased Sheshonk 11's brother, Takelot 11, which perhaps lasted at least 7 years (No. 15). bThe traces that remain make the name of Osorkon I1 certain. The year is, of course, not less than 30, if Legrain's arrangement be correct. cWe know that Takelot 11's son, Osorkon, was High Priest of Amon in the years 11, 12, and 15 of Takelot 11, and 22, 26, 28, 29, and 39 of Sheshonk I11 ($8 756 ff.). Hence the High Priest Harsiese must have displaced Osorkon for a, time, as explained below ($ 758). The occurrence of a Harsiese in the sixth year of Pemou (No. 24) is uncertain. If accepted, it must either be another Harsiese, or his term was interrupted at least from the year 22 to the year 39 of Sheshonk 111. dThis cannot be a year of Sheshonk 111, as it would involve a coregency with Pemou of some 46 years; nor can it be year 12 of the High Priest Harsiese, if he be the same as the Harsiese of Sheshonk 111's sixth year (No. 22). Hence I am inclined to doubt the reading of Harsiese here which Legrain himself questions. If, however, we accept it, then there must be another king between Sheshonk I11 and Pemou-the Sheshonk with the new prenomen, of No. 25 ? This would not increase the length of the dynasty, as we know from the Apis stela (8 778) that there were 26 years from the twenty-eighth year of Sheshonk I11 to the second year of Pemou. Thus, according to No. 25, the new Sheshonk would have reigned at least 6 years, and the Sheshonk I11 not more than 46 years (the highest recorded date of Sheshonk I11 is year 39, $ 777); or if No. 24 belongs to the new Sheshonk, he reigned at least 12 years, and Sheshonk I11 not more than 40 years"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"4 6981 RECORDS OF NILE-LEVELS AT KARNAK 343 -- - Setepnamon, Meriamon-Siese-fPemoula High Priest of Amon-Re, king of gods, rHarsiese1.

C., must have taken place in the latter half of the reign of the founder of the new dynasty. He possessed no monument in Thebes, upon which he might record the achievement until his twenty-first year (about 924 B. C.), when he built the Bubastite gate in the Karnak temple and the first court to which it leads ($5 701-8). Its wall then received a victorious relief of the conventional character, the inscriptions in which are made up of stereotyped phrases drawn from earlier monuments of the same kind, which are, therefore, too vague, general, and indecisive to furnish any solid basis for a study of Sheshonk's campaign.

It enables us to control the statement of Amon in the relief (9 722, 1. 19), crediting Sheshonk with having captured Mitanni. No towns so far north can be found on the list. The reference to Mitanni is unquestionably drawn from older inscriptions, and the Egyptian scribes of this period probably knew little more of the vanished Euphrates k.ingdom than the authors of the Bentresh stela (111, $9 429 ff .), a little later, knew of the same distant region. 711.

Why it is still read with m by Maspero (Transactions of the Victmia Institute, 27, 108, 109) in 1892, I do not know. eP is the Egyptian article. fEven if this word be Aramaic, it would not militate against the identification of the second part of the name with Abram. But its frequent occurrence in this list, quite justifies Bondi's conclusion that, although not found in the Old Testa- ment, 5pn is an old Canaanite word. The strange ending > in which Miiller would see the Aramaic status emphaticus, is of no significance here, for it is added to many names in the list, which we know existed in Palestine many centuries before the Aramaizing of the Palestinian dialects began. It is not unlikely that it is a feminine ending (for the undoubted feminine termination n exists in the list only in those words in which is is still preserved in Hebrew.

We already have the name of Jacob in the lists of Thutmose 111, and probably also that of Joseph. We might, therefore, expect to find the name of Abram, especially at this time, when we know that the traditions of their ancestors were especially cherished and daily current among the Hebrews, and were beginning at last to take permanent form. But the narratives of Genesis are all later than this list of She- shonk; hence this is the earliest mention of Abram's name in an historical document-his first appearance in history. 716. The remainder of the list, as we have stated, offers very little which can be geographically determined. No. 100, ' -d-r ' - ',' is doubtless 178 in Judah, while of two ending is a feminine ending in this list is indicated by the fact that this very word $Yn, while four times written with the ending J, is once written with no ending, and once with t and the landdeterminative. Such a t was at this time, exactly as in modern Arabic, not pronounced, but indicated merely the vowel d or 2, the connection between the lost feminine t and the word to which it belonged. Finally it should be noticed that the plural of the word in this lit is ~53~ (IO~), which I need hardly state is a Hebrew and not an Aramaic plural. While masculine, it may still belong to a feminine noun like n3d, pl., P~W. aThis word is explained by Maspero (Transactions of the Victoria Institute, 27, 83) as a plural of 539, which he gives as \"~~5ag .\" This equivalence is phonetically perfect, but nevertheless impossible. This plural is given its vowel-points as if it were an existent form, but the plural of 3@, \"meadow,\" does not occur. The word is used in Hebrew only as the first member of an annexion in geographical names, e. g., D7Q?? 539, and never occurs in any other combination. This is also its use in all of the other names in which it occurs in our list. Moreover, if this were not so, we must demand for the second number some specific term, name, or epithet. bOn showing this identification to Erman, he looked up his own studies on this lit, and to his own surprise he found in his manuscript that he had made the same identification in 1888.

The historical conclusions to be drawn from the peculiarities in the language and writing of the list seem to me to have been misunderstood. The alleged Aramaisms are very doubtful; but even if they be admitted, their use by the hieroglyphic scribe is so utterly opposed to the usage of Aramaic that they would prove only the personal peculiarity of an Egyptian scribe, slightly acquainted with Aramaic, and absolutely nothing as to the pronunciation of the name of a given town current in Palestine. The con- clusion that this list shows that Aramaic had already become the leading language of Syria, therefore, seems to me, to be without basis. aBethAnath (Josh. 19: 38; Judg.

This monument is dated under a Sheshonk whose prenomen is not given. As his nineteenth year is mentioned he cannot be Sheshonk 11; so that the uncertainty lies be- tween Sheshonk I and Sheshonk 111. Of the two, Sheshonk I seems to me the more probable, as the document mentions a revolt in the oasis, and a reorganization, which would be especially likely to occur at the advent of a new dynasty, and we find Dakhel under the control of Sheshonk 1's successor, Osorkon I. The document is really the record of the successful claim of a certain priest of the Southern Oasis, Nesubast, to a well alleged to belong to his family. The case is tried before Khonsu, the god of the oasis, and a legal decision sought from him, in the manner customary since the Twenty-first Dynasty. As a legal document it will be taken up in a later volume of this series, devoted exclusively to such documents. The stela interests us here, because Nesubast presented his claim on the arrival of the new governor of the oasis, Waye- he~et,~ a priest of Diospolis Parva, whom Sheshonk sent to reorganize the oasis, then in a state of rebellion, and probably plundered and wasted.

STATUE INSCRIPTIONa 745. This inscription contains only a prayer of the king, but the blessings for which he prays are of great political sig- nificance. He desires that his descendants may rule over the high priests of Amon, the chiefs of the Meshwesh, and the prophets of Harsaphes. The power of the last is evident from the long genealogy of Harpeson, whose ancestor, Nam- lot, a son of Osorkon 11, was appointed by this king as High Priest of Harsaphes at Heracleopolis and governor of the South, with military command ($787, No. I i).b 746. The distribution of territory among these nobles was evidently thus: Thebes controlled at least from lower Nubia to Siut;' Heracleopolis, probably from Siut to the Delta; and the Meshwesh chieftains held the Delta cities, as formerly. Egypt was thus clearly divided at this time into feudal principalities, more or less responsible to the Bubast- ite Pharaoh. It is for the control of this tottering state by his descendants, that Osorkon I1 prays as follows: =Granite stela, held by a kneeling statue of Osorkon 11, at Tanis, doubtless the one published by Petrie (Tunis, XIV, No. 3; VI, 41, A.C.D.), as Daressy has noticed (Recueil, 18, 49); although Petrie thought the statue was one of Ramses I1 usurped by Osorkon I1 (op. cit., 25). It was seen and copied by de RougC (Inscrip- tions hi6roglyphiques, 71, 7z), and published again by Daressy (106. cit.). bThe same Namlot was High Priest of Amon, and thus ruled at Thebes also (1 789). cThe northern boundary is fixed by the will of Yewelot ($741); the southern is probable from the mention of \"gold of Khenthennofer\" given by the High Priest of Amon, Osorkon (8 770)~ although this gold might have been secured in trade.

The walls of this building bore a long series of reliefs depicting the elaborate ceremonies accompanying the cele- bration of the jubilee. These are almost all of religious significance and connection; but one of the ceremonies is of great historical importance. It was, perhaps, the opening rite of the jubilee, for it commemorated the assumption of power by the king. He is shown in a reliefa seated on a portable throne, of the greatest simplicity, and borne on the shoulders of his servants. The scene is accompanied by the words : Carrying the king, sitting upon the portable throne; procession of the king to the palace. Beneath the throne are inscribed the words: All lands, all countries, Upper Retenu, Lower Retenu, all inacces- sible countries are under the feet of this Good God.b 750. Above the scene is an inscription which indicates clearly the nature of the particular event commemorated, viz., the assumption by the king of the responsibility for the protection of the land. That this was a characteristic, if not the chief, ceremony of the jubilee (hb-Sd) is shown by the words of the conquered Hermopolitans to Piankhi: \" Cele- brate for us a jubilee (hb-Sd), even as thou hast protected the Hare nome\" ( 5 848, 1. 61). It is not evident why the min- istering women of the Theban temple should be given so much attention. The prominence of Amon, who dominates the ceremony, is noteworthy. Probably the most important fact furnished by the inscription is the statement that Thebes is exempt from inspection by the royal fiscal officers, who do not even go thither.

The narrative now passes over a long period and begins a retrospect of Osorkon's benefactions from the beginning of his rule at Thebes, which Osorkon himself states as a \"list of all the benefactions which I did for them for the first time, from the year 11 under [the majesty of Takelot II]C 7to the year 28, under the majesty of Sheshonk 111.\" After a list of myrrh, incense, honey, and oil (1. 7) follows a statement of precious metals given to Arnon, Mut, and Khonsu, among which \"fin.e gold of Khenthennofer\" twice appears (11. 8 and 9).

Osorkon's term of office at that time, from year 11 of Takelot I1 to year 28 of Sheshonk 111, thus rests on better evidence than that hereto- fore drawn from this inscription (Maspero, Momies royales, 741, 742).

This brief document is a graffito such as the officials of this age were wont to cut upon the walls at Karnak, in commemoration of their installation or promotion in office. It bears the latest surviving date of the High Priest Osorkon, and also informs us that his brother, Bekneptah, was com- mander at Heracleopolis in the year 39 of Sheshonk 111. Bekneptah must, therefore, have interrupted the succession of Harpeson's family in that office at Heracleop~lis.~ Osor- kon and Bekneptah are here making common cause, \"over- throwing all who fought against them.\" 776. This can hardly be a reminiscence of the trouble which interrupted Osorkon7s rule at Thebes (Q 758). The interim in the power of the ruling family at Heracleopolis, by the installation of Osorkon's brother, Bekneptah, doubt- less explains the origin of the trouble referred to. Osorkon and Bekneptah, sons of Takelot 11, probably expelled from Heracleopolis the line established there by Osorkon 11. This offers an interesting parallel to the expulsion from Thebes of the High Priest Osorkon himself, and suggests, at least, that he may have owed his expulsion to the Heracleo- politans, on whom he has now retaliated.

Back of Osorkon 11, therefore, the genealogy of Harpeson becomes that of the Twenty-second Dynasty, and the Libyan, Ruyuwawa, the father of his line is, therefore, the ancestor of the Twenty-second Dynasty.

It is evident, therefore, that for at least a hundred years before the Twenty-second Dynasty, Heracleopolis had been the seat of a powerful family. Of the fortunes of its rulers during the first three reigns of the dynasty we learn nothing; but our genealogy shows Osorkon I1 appointing his son Narnlot as High Priest and military commander there, with the title of governor of the South, like the High Priest of Amon. Indeed, this Namlot became also High Priest aAs the name of Namlot's mother, Mehetnusekhet, and the name of his father, Sheshonk, are the same in our genealogy and in the Abydos stela, there can be no question about their identity. bOn the Ahydos stela, 5 677. cWe can only suppose that during the Twenty-first Dynasty the fami!y had gained control of Bubastis, and that Sheshonk I, perceiving the necessity of a stronghold in the eastern Delta, took up his residence there, thus gaining for his family the name Buhastites; but the family was clearly not of Bubastite origin."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"i 7901 - SERAPEUM STELA OF HARPESON 397 of Arnon, as Lepsius long ago saw.\" The principality of Thebes, added to that of Heracleopolis, gave to one man the control of all Upper Egypt, from the Delta into Nubia, creating a dangerous rival of the royal house. How long Namlot held both principalities is ~ncertain,~ but the family held possession of Heracleopolis for five generations more, six in all ($ 787, Nos. I I and 16). 790. But in the thirty-ninth year of Sheshonk 111, Bekne- ptah, a son of Takelot 11, not appearing in our genealogy, was in control at Heracleopolis ($9 775, 776) and making common cause with Osorkon, High Priest at Thebes. Nam- lot's descendantsc must therefore have lost and recovered control at Heracleopolis. The support of their enemy, Bekneptah, by the High Priest of Amon at Thebes, suggests earlier hostility between the two principalities, and is evi- dently only one example of the petty wars in which the dynasts of Egypt were now constantly embroiled. Thus, while Thebes did not succeed in maintaining a dynasty under the Bubastites, that of Heracleopolis, beginning early in the Twenty-first Dynasty, continued for fifteen genera- tions, interrupted for four generations by the accession of the line to the throne as the Twenty-second Dynasty, and by the probably short usurpation of Bekneptah (see §$ 745, 746).

Petrie (Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archeology, XXVI, 284) thinks this couple the same as that of the eleventh generation, so that the genealogy stops at the seventh and goes back to begin again with the eleventh (= sixth) and carries it back (6 to I) parallel with 11 to 7; 11 to 7 being the ancestry of Namlot, and 6 to I the ancestry of his wife Tentsepeh. To this reconstruction there are three fatal objections: (I) If 6-1 is the genealogy of Tentsepeh alone, why has her husband's name been inserted before hers in 6? (2) If 6-1 is the genealogy of a woman, why does it proceed (fifth generation) with \"son\" and not daughter?

It is unfortunate that the above possibility of evading the Libyan origin of the Twentysecond Dynasty should be used as an argument for the Assyrian origin of that dynasty; although we have proof positive that at the rise of the Twenty-second Dynasty, Assyria was in a state of decline, and had absolutely no power in the west."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"THE TWENTY-THIRD DYNASTY"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"RECORDS OF NILE-LEVELS AT KARNAKa 793.

The occasion of the Nubian conquest of the farther North, narrated in our document, was a disturbance in the situation just described, occasioned by the aggressiveness and rapid rise of Tefnakhte, a local dynast of Sais in the western Delta, whose career at this point illustrates that of almost every founder of a Pharaonic dynasty. -Had the Nubian conquest not put an end to his brilliant career, he, too, like Ahmose of Thebes, and Sheshonk of Heracle- opolis (later Bubastis), would have headed a dynasty of Pharaohs. In Piankhi's twenty-firstc year, in the first month of the calendar year, his vassals in Upper Egypt reported to him that Tefnakhte had defeated the dynasts of the entire western DeIta, and of both shores of the Nile above the Delta, almost as far south as the vicinity of Benihasan. Besides these, he had also gained control of all the eastern and middle Delta princes (1. rg), so that he was practically king of all lower Egypt, and of the lower portion of Upper =Or possibly a little later. The reasons why Thebes could not have fallen much later will be found at the close of this discussion, $815 The correctness of this dating of Piankhi's appearance in Lower Egypt some fifty years later than has been heretofore done by other historians, is not only rendered certain by the chronological data of the preceding period (dead reckoning from accession of Eighteenth Dynasty), but also by the fact that Piankhi was the father of Taharka, who began to reign in 690 or 691 B. C.; the fact that Bocchoris, the son of Tef- nakhte, Piankhi's enemy, was the opponent of Shabaka; so that Piankhi and Sha- baka cannot have been far apart. bThe Ethiopian period in Egypt thus includes Dynasties 23 (excepting the first reign), 24, and 25, the last of which only, is called Ethiopian by Manetho, because it was not until the overthrow of the ephemeral Twenty-fourth Dynasty, in the Delta that the Ethiopians established themselves permanently there. cAs he must have been holding Upper Egypt for some time before this, we must place his occupation of Thebes a year at least before these reports."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"$8011 THE PIANKHI STELA 4ag Egypt. Only Heracleopolis was holding out against him, and was suffering a siege at his hands, all his vassal princes lending him aid against it. 799. The wily Piankhi, desirous of drawing his enemy far southward, away from the safety of the impenetrable Delta swamps, quietly awaited developments. A second appeal from the north ($ 819) then informed Piankhi of the submission of Namlot, king of Hermopolis, to Tefnakhte (§ 820). Piankhi thereupon sent his commanders, with the troops then in Egypt, northward to check Tefnakhte's fur- ther southern advance, and besiege Hermopolis (§ 821). This they did, while Piankhi was, at the same time, dispatch- ing from Nubia a second army for their support ($822). Having left Thebes, the second army met Tefnakhte's fleet coming up, and defeated it, capturing many ships and pris- oners (8 825). Continuing northward, probably down the Bahr Yusuf,\" they struck Tefnakhte's army, which was besieging Heracleopolis, with the assistance of the Delta dynasts, as we have already stated. The northerners were defeated, both by land and water, and fled to the west side of the Bahr Yusuf (§ 831), whither they were pursued by the Nubians the next morning, again discomfited and forced to retreat toward the Delta. 800. Namlot, king of Hermopolis, escaped from the dis- aster, and returned southward to protect his own city, Hermopolis, which had not yet surrendered; whereupon the Nubian commanders returned up the Bahr Yusuf to Her- mopolis which they closely beset ($833). 801.

Mean- while, his commanders in Egypt captured Oxyrhyncus, Tetehen, and Hatbenu (5 Q 837-39), although Hermopolis still held out against them. 802. Piankhi then proceeded northward early in the cal- endar year, celebrated the Feast of Opet at Thebes in the third month, and went on to assume charge of the siege of Hermopolis, which had now been going on for certainly four, and probably five months (Q 840). He pressed the siege so vigorously that the city was soon at his mercy, and Namlot, finding that gifts, even his own royal crown, availed nothing with Piankhi, sent out his queen to plead with Piankhi's women that they might intercede with him in Namlot's behalf ($ 0 842-44). This move was successful and, assured of his life, Namlot surrendered and turned over all his wealth to Piankhi, who immediately entered the city ($0 845-50). One of the most remarkable touches in this remarkable inscription, is the wrath of Piankhi as he visits Namlot's stables and finds that the horses have suffered hunger ($850). All of Namlot's wealth was assigned to the royal treasury of Piankhi and the sacred fortune of Amon (Q 851). 803. Heracleopolis, being already exhausted after a siege at the hands of Tefnakhte, its king, Pefnefdibast, now came to greet Piankhi and praise him for his deliverance (Q 852). The advance to the Delta, sailing down the Bahr Yusuf, was then begun, and all the chief towns of the West sur- rendered one after another on seeing Piankhi's force, except Crocodilopolis, in the Fayilm, which would have carried him too far from his course by Illahun.

Piankhi offered sacrifice to the gods in all the cities which he passed, and took possession of the available property for his own treas- ury and the estate of Amon. 804. On reaching Memphis, it was found to be very strongly fortified and, in answer to Yiankhi's demand to surrender, the Memphites closed the gates and made a sortie, which was evidently not very effective (D$ 857, 858). Under cover of night, Tefnakhte entered the city, and exhorted the garrison to rely on their strong walls, their plentiful sup- plies, and the high water which protected the east side from attack, while he himself rode away north for reinforcements (5s 859, 860). Having landed on the north of the city, Piankhi was surprised at the strength of the place. Some of his people favored a siege, others desired to storm the walls upon embankments and causeways raised for the pur- pose (5 861). Piankhi decided to storm, devising a shrewd plan of assault which speaks highly for his skill as a leader. 805. The lofty walls on the west side of the city had been recently raised still higher, and it was evident that the east side, protected by high waters (artificially raised ?) , was being neglected. Here was the harbor, where the ships now floated so high that their bow-ropes were fastened among the houses of the city. Piankhi sent his fleet against the harbor, and quickly captured all the shipping. Then, taking command in person, he rapidly ranged the captured craft and his own fleet along the eastern walls, thus furnishing footing for his assaulting lines, which he immediately sent over the ram- parts and captured the city before its eastern defenses could be strengthened against him (5s 862-65).

The entire region of Memphis then submitted (9 867), whereupon the Delta dynasts also came to Mem- phis with gifts for Piankhi, and signified their submission (5 868). After dividing the wealth of Memphis between the treasuries of Amon and of Ptah, Pidnkhi crossed the river, worshiped in the ancient sanctuary of Khereha-Babylon, and followed the old sacred road thence to Heliopolis, where he camped by the harbor. Among the important religious ceremonies here was his entrance alone into the holy of holies of the Re-temple, that he might view the god and be recognized by him as king, according to the immemorial customa ($ 871). 807. Before he left Heliopolis, King Osorkon I11 of Bubastis surrendered and visited Piankhi. Having moved his camp to a point just east of Athribis, by a town called Keheni, he there received the submission of all the petty kings, princelets, chiefs, and dynasts of the Delta (Q$ 872, 873). Among these, Pediese of Athribis showed himself especially loyal to Piankhi and invited him thither, placing all his wealth at the Nubian's disposal. Piankhi, therefore, entered Athribis, received the gifts of Pediese, and, in order to choose for himself the best horses, especially entered the stables, which the shrewd Athribite, observing his love of horses, had particularly invited him to do. Fifteen Delta dynasts were here dismissed, at their own request, that they might go back to their cities and return to Piankhi with fur- ther gifts, .in emulation of Pediese ($ $ 873-76). 808.

Rather than have them captured by Piankhi, he burned the ships and supplies which he could not save. Piankhi then sent a body of troops against Mesed, and they slew the garrison. Tefnakhte had, meanwhile, taken refuge on one of the remote islands in the western mouths of the Nile. The season was far advanced; many miles of vast Delta morass, and a network of irrigation canals, separated Piankhi from the fugitive. It would have been a hazardous undertaking to have dispatched an army into such a region. When, therefore, Tefnalihte sent gifts and a humble message of submission, requesting that Piankhi send a messenger with whom he might go to the neighboring temple and take the oath of allegiance to Piankhi, the Nubian king was very ready to accept the proposal (8 880). In this less humiliating, not to say much less dangerous manner, Tefnakhte then accepted the suzerainty of Piankhi, and when the two kings of the FayQm and Aphroditopolis, whom he had not molested on his way northward, appeared with their gifts (8 882), a Nubian Pharaoh was lord of all Egypt- 809. The vassals, having paid Piankhi a last visit, he loaded his vessels with the wealth of the North and sailed away for his southern capital, amid the acclamations of the people. Arrived at Napata, he had erected in the temple of Amon our magnificent granite stela, recording how he, the son of Ainon, had humiliated the rivals of that god in the North. The language of the inscription is good, and clear E;gyptian in the narrative portions; but in the speeches, especially those of Piankhi himself, it is in places quite unin- telligible, and produces the in~pression of a composition by one not perfectly familiar with the language.

The Twenty- third Dynasty ruler, Osorkon 111, is a Bubastite, and not a Tanite, as Manetho states. a Hence the Twenty-third Dynasty, being clearly Bubastite, could not have been par- allel with the close of the Bubastite Twenty-second Dynasty, but must have followed it. Again, both Pedibast and Osor- lion I11 of the Twenty-third Dynasty, controlled Thebes (§ $ 793, 794) as did all the later kings of the Twenty-second Dynasty. Hence they could not have been c~nternporary.~ There are two other possible parallels: first, the last few years of the Twenty-third Dynasty, with the reign of Boc- choris,\" but Bocchoris could not have been regarded as the founder and sole king of a new dynasty, if he had not ruled the country as a whole for a time; second, the early years of Shabaka may have been parallel with the close of Bocchoris's reign. The whole period involved by these two parallels could not have been more than ten years, and was probably less, if it existed at all. 814.

A woman, stand- ing with uplifted right hand, preceding Namlot, represents \"the king's-wives,\" the women of Namlot, who appeared before Piankhi in the palace at Her~nopolis (11. 62-64). Three kings, with the royal uraeus upon their foreheads, are kissing the earth at Piankhi7s feet. They are designated as: (I) Ki~zg Osorkon; (2) King Yewepet; (3) King Pefnefdibast. 815. Five other princes approach Piankhi, of whom one, without the uraeus, but wearing the sidelock of youth, was \"[rPrincel] Teti.\" The other four, who are also without the uraeus, but wear the feather plume on the head, are: (I) The prince (h ' ty -c ) ,a Pethenef (P ' -infy) ; (2) The prince (h ty -'), Pemou (P' -m3); (3) Great chief of Me, Akenesh C -k - n-S ') ; (4) Great chief of Me, Zeamamefonekh. The words of these conquered dynasts, or at least of Namlot, inscribed before them, are too fragmentary for restoration, but they began: \"Be appeased, Horus, lord of [the palace],\" in which we recognize the opening words of Namlot's speech before Piankhi (11. 55, 56). The figure of Piankhi has been chiseled away by his political enemies. Beneath the relief the great inscription then follows, as translated below : Date 816.

Piankhi, having cele- brated the New Year's feast at Napata, departed for Thebes, which in turn he left in the third month, for his campaign in the north. The above date, nine months later, would allow enough for his campaign and the return to Napata. Again, if it be the date of the first report of Tefnakhte's aggressions, Piankhi's departure was a year later (his commanders operating in Egypt meanwhile), so that his depar- ture and campaign fell in the year 22. cFor this name I have retained the traditional spelling, although it is evident"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"0 8181 THE PIANKHI STELA 419 Introduction 817.

That their control of Thebes did not begin at the death of Pedibast and precede the invasion of Piankhi, is evident from the fact that Yewepet, who ruled in Thebes with Pedibast, survived him, and would have continued there.

Many years then elapsed before he became king, during which he did not see his mother, and must, therefore, have spent these years in the north.

This document has thrown a flood of light on the dynastic connections in the Ethiopian and Saitic period, and its discovery was especially welcome, in view of the paucity of contemporary monuments from this age. It may be described as a decree of adoption and property-conveyance. It records the adoption of Nitocris, the daughter of Psamtik I, by a Shepnupet, daughter of Taharka, the Divine Votress, or sacerdotal princess, at Thebes. Shepnupet transfers all her property to Nitocris, and the purpose of the adoption was that the family of Psamtik I might legally gain control of this property, as well as the position which it entailed at Thebes. 936. The beginning of the document is lost, and it now commences in the middle of a speech of Psamtik I to his court, announcing his purpose to have his daughter Nitocris adopted by Shepnupet. The court responds with the usual encomiums. In the ninth year of Psamtik I, therefore, Nitocris proceeds to Thebes, where she is received with acclamation, and the property of Shepnupet is formally con- veyed to her, a full invoice of her estate being appended. 937. The stela shows that Psamtik had gained full control of Thebes by his ninth year, and that Tanutamon had, there- fore, lost Upper Egypt before that time.

The adoption of Nitocris, and the similar adoption of her predecessor, Shepnupet, as well as the adoption of Amenirdis by the same Shepnupet, render it clear that this was the usual method' of succession in the Ethiopian and Saitic periods, and much simplifies the royal family con- nections of the time.

He arranged the affairs of the princess, and she spent a day with him in the temple, looking over her papers. He then conducted the restoration of her palace, involving the erection of one building a hun- dred cubits high (over I 72 feet !). This is the only literary reference to the height of a dwelling in earlier Egypt.

The army of Apries was scattered, but the dethroned king escaped, and his troops continued to rove the North, infesting the roads and, of course, living by plunder.

If this reconstruction be correct, then this second battle, as being much like the first, was not properly distinguished by Herodotus, who says nothing of it. This seems to me more probable than to identify the battle of our stela with that of Herodotus, in which case Amasis had ruled over two years, at least, before he was attacked by Apries; and there would also be no sojourn of Apries in the custody of Amasis, as so particularly related by Herodotus. \" The account of Apries' death, as given by Herodotus, is difficult to harmonize with that on our stela on any hypothesis; but both sources agree in the statement that Amasis gave Apries honorable burial, according to Herodotus, among his ancestors at Sais. 999.

He claims the consideration of the god and his priesthood, because he constantly presented the needs of Abydos to King Amasis and secured wealth and buildings for the ~b~dos temple. Some of this work he personally super- intended at Abydos, and he participated in the presentation of the Osirian drama there. His incessant activity for the cult of Osiris, although he was not a member of the royal family, is a striking example of the excessive religious zeal of the age, pictured so graphically by Herodotus. 1016. One of his achievements on behalf of Osiris is striking. A descendant of the ancient Thinite family, whose counts we still find in the Eighteenth Dynasty, was dispos- sessed of his income from the Great Oasis and from the local ferry, and Pefnefdineit had these revenues diverted to the treasury of Osiris. The income from the oasis was then devoted to meet the funeral expenses of the people of Abydos.

The historical value of these stelae consists solely in the chronological data which they furnish. From these data it is possible to establish the exact length of the Twenty- sixth Dynasty, and also the length of the reign of Apries, otherwise uncertain. The calculation is as follows: Psamtik was sixty-five years, ten months, and two days old at his death in the twenty-seventh year of the reign of Amasis, on the twenty-eighth day of the eighth month. He was, therefore, born thirty-nine years, two months, and four days before the accession of Amasis. Now, the date of his birth is given as the first day of the eleventh month in year I of Necho; hence, Necho's accession was exactly fortyb years before that of Amasis.
