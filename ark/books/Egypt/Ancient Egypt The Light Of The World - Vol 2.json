B OOK IX A T first sight the general effect of the innum erable deluge - legends is to sugge st the existence of a primitive kind of catastrophobi a resulting from fear of the water - flood. The arkite sym bol ism originated in the mount and tree, the cave or enclosure being a natural place of refuge when the waters were out upon the earth; and these were follow ed by the raft, the boa t, or ark that swam the waters as a means of hum an safety. Before the legends of a deluge coul d have been formulated, th e deluge as an ove rwhelming flood of water had becom e a figur e used in sign - langua ge to expr ess the natural fact in a variety of phe nom ena to which the type might be and was applied. It is expr essed in Engl ish still by what is termed “a floodi ng. ” But a de luge is not only an ove rflow of water. There is a deluge of blood (bot h Egypt ian and Polyne sian). Night brings its deluge of darkne ss, and dawn lets loos e the floods of day. The so - called deluge - legend com prises a hundr ed legends and a hundr ed appl ications of the same type, from one singl e origin in sign - langua ge as the primitive mode of representing a fact in nature. The deluge is uni versal because it was not local. The hum an race spread out ove r all the earth woul d not have been greatly troubl ed about an excessive ove rflow of water onc e upon a time in Mesopot amia. The legend is coeval with all time, and current amongs t all peopl e, because the deluge did not occur “onc e upon a time.” On the grand scale it was the mythical representation of the endi ng and su bm ergence of an old order of things in the astronom ical mythol ogy; but there were various distinct deluge s with that meaning, and not merely one . The Egyp tian deluge in the so - called “destruction of manki nd” is described as cont inui ng for three night s and days. The time is measured by three days’ lengt h in navigation through a deluge of blood ( Records of the Past, 6, 103) . Now , three night s and days is the lengt h of time that was com put ed for the mont hly absence of the moon in the nether - world. Hence there was a deluge of darkne ss on that scale in mythol ogy. But the deluge occurred in at least four categor ies of phe nom ena. There was a deluge of blood and a deluge of darkne ss, as well as a deluge of water. There is also the deluge that was a type of periodic time; and by no black art of bibliolatry can these four kinds of deluge be com bined in one . A deluge being an endi ng of a cycle in time, we can unde rstand the 545 langua ge of the Code x Chimalpopoc a (translated by the Abbé Brasseur de Bour bour g) conc erni ng the flood , when it says, “Now the water was tranqui l for forty years plus twelve.” “All was lost. Even the mount ains sank into the water, and the water remained tranqui l for fifty - two springs .” In this account , the well - know n Mexican cycle of fifty - two years is measured by means of a deluge at the end of the period. In Inne r Africa the year was reckone d by the periodi c great rain; in Egypt by the inunda tion; and a deluge , we repeat, became the natural type of an endi ng in time in the uranogr aphi c represe ntation. In Indi a, a solar pralaya, in which the waters rise till they reach the seven Rishis in the region of the pol e, is of necessity kronian, and appl ies solely to the keeping"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"of time and period astronom ically. The Assyrian deluge is described as lasti ng seven days. This agrees with the seven days’ silence in the Wisdom of Esdras, by which the cons um mation of the age, or endi ng of the period, was to be com memorated “like as in the former judgm ents,” deluge s, or endi ngs of the cycle or age in time. The f lood of Noah is on the scale of the year or thereabout s. The deluge of time, as it was called by the Chaldean magi, is a breach of cont inuity, a pha se of dissolution. It was a period of negation that was filled in with a festival as a mode of memorialising the dies non or no time. It was a condi tion of the lawlessness of misrule, of prom iscuous intercour se, of drunke nne ss, that characterized the saturnalia by which it was celebrated. There is a Kamite prototype in “the destruction of manki nd” for the wom an who is the reput ed cause of a deluge in the Egypt ian mythos . This is Sekhe t the avenge r. She is the very great one of the liqui d dom ain. No one is master of the water of Sekhe t, which she lets loos e as an element of death and destruction. She was the grea t mistress of terror in fire and flood . In “the destruction of manki nd” it is said, “There was Sekhe t, dur ing several night s, trampling the blood unde r her feet as far as Heracleopol is.” Ra, the solar god, “ordered the godde ss to slay the evil race in thre e days of navigation.” “And the fields were entirely cove red with water through the will of the majesty of the god; and there came the godde ss (Hathor ) in the morning, and she found the fields cove red with water, and she was pleased with it, and she went a way satisfied and saw no men” ( i.e., none of the exterminated evil race). This is a form of the Egypt ian deluge designa ted a great destruction, but with no earthly appl ication to the hum an race. In the African legend relating to the origin of Lake Tanga nyi ka, that was told to Stanley by the Wagigi fishermen, it was a wom an, to whom the secret of the water - spring had been entrusted, who was the cause of the deluge . Possibly this woman was the earth as mother of the waters, seeing that Scom alt is the earth - mo ther of the Okanagaus, and that she also was charged with letting in the deluge . Scom alt is a form of the primordial genetrix, equi valent to Apt in Egypt. Long ago, they say, when the sun was no bigge r than a star, this strong medicine - wom an ruled ove r wha t appe ars to have becom e a lost cont inent. Her subj ects rose against her in rebellion. Whereupon she broke up the land, and all the peopl e but two met with their death by drow ning. A man and a wom an escaped in a canoe and arrived on the mainland, and from this pair the Okanagaus are descende d (Bancroft, vol. III, 149) . 546 A starting - poi nt in various deluge - legends is from the world all water. This originated with the firmament as the celestial water that was called the Nnu, or Nun. Now one meaning of th e word Nun in Egypt ian is the flood. Thus the water of heaven is synonym ous with the deluge . In one aspect the deluge , as a figure in the sign - langua ge of the astronom ical mythol ogy , was a mode of representing the sinki ng of the pol e in the celestial ocean which was figur ed as the world of water. This is the world all water in the legenda ry lore. The flood upon which Jehova h sat as king was no other than the firmamental Nun (Ps. XXIX. 10) . So the throne of Osiris was based upon the flood, that is upon the N un. In the vigne ttes to the Ritual Osiris sits upon the throne in Amenta as the great judge and ruler, and his throne is “balanced” as it is described, upon the flood. Water being the primary element of life, it was also based on figur atively; and Osiris w ith"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"his throne resting on the water takes the place of the earlier Nnu, or later Noah, resting in his ark as master of the deep. Nnu was god of the celestial water. The wateress in one form was the godde ss Nut. This, then, and not hing shor t of it, is the r oot of the matter when, as in the Navajo - Indi an legend, certain persons , who are so often one female and one male, make their escape from the ove rwhelming waters by climbing up a reed to the land of life which, as a land of reeds, was the primal paradise, or the fields where the papyr us was in flow er above the waters of a uni versal deluge , as represented in the veriest drawing of mythol ogy . We have to learn the sign - langua ge before we can unde rstand the nature of mythol ogy. When it is said that Horus inund ates the world like the sun each morning, that is with the light as the deluge of day. There is a white water and a black, equi valent to the white bird of light and the black bird of night , as oppos ite figur es of Sut and Horus for the dark and the day. The evil Apap, who drinks the water cubi t by cubi t at each gul p as the sun goe s dow n, is slain by Horus at daybr eak, when he onc e more sets free the waters of light which are designa ted the waters of dawn. In like manne r, the waters of day rush forth when Ind ra slays the serpent of darkne ss, who was thought of as the swallow er of the light =water of heaven. Osiris is called the “ove rflow er,” the “great extende r,” the “shor eless one ,” who in this imagery of the deluge “brings to its fulness the divine force whic h is hidde n within him” (Rit., ch. 64, 13 - 15, Renouf ). Thus , in cont inui ng the primitive mode of thingi ng the conc ept, Osiris is the water - force personi fied, instead of being represented as a crocodi le, which was also one of the primal type s of water. “Th e deluge ” is onl y singl e as a type . There are various deluge s know n to mythol ogy, and various agents who are held responsible for causing them. In one legend or folk - tale it was the mischievous monke y. In another it was the tortoise, who sank in the waters and drow ned the peopl e who had their dw elling - place upon its back. In anot her it is caused by the killing of a sacred bird, which might be the vul ture or cygnus . In a four th the fount ains of the great deep are ope ned by the taking out of the star, whereup on the deluge follow s. A cause of the deluge is attribut ed to the star - gods , Sut in Egypt and Bel in Babyl oni a. It was caused by a failure in keeping time, and the failure is follow ed in a num ber of legends by the 547 new heaven, in which the supr eme tim e - keeper is the moon or the luna r divinity who is Taht in the Kamite representation. Som e most precious remains of the primitive wisdom now extant out side of Egypt are preserved by the oldest races of the world. Much of the matter is found amongs t the peo ple of the Polyne sian islands , far more to the purpos e than anyt hing to be found in the Hindu or the Hebrew sacred books . The Samoans have what may, in a sym bol ical sense, be termed a deluge legend. Tanga loa, the originator of the heavens, was the bui lder. Of old the heavens were always falling dow n when they cons isted of water without any bul wark or embankm ent. To put a limit, to build or make any firm enclosure, was to circum scribe the waters and secure a place of refuge from the dreaded deluge . In the ti me of Ptah, their great architect, the Egypt ians were adva nced enough in craftsmanship for the enclosure formed by him to keep out the waters of the deluge in Amenta to be made of either iron or steel, called the ba - metal. An ark was a primitive enclosure formed in the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"celestial water. This, as Egypt ian, is the ark of Nnu, and Nnu is heaven, as water, also a name for the deity of the celestial water. In the Samoan legend, an ark is bui lt before there was any water or water - flood, or before the firmament had been figur ed as water. “Tanga loa of the heavens and his son Lu= Shu bui lt a canoe or vessel up in the heavens.” When the vessel was finished there was no water to float it. Gaoga o, the ancient mother, told her son Lu to have the vessel ready and she woul d make the water. She then gave birth to a lake, or the water of life, and also to the salt water, as it is said “there was no sea at that time.” The lake we identify with “the lake of the thigh, ” or the meskhe n of the water - cow . Sea and lake imply bot h salt and fresh water, the two waters of earth and heaven that were repeated in the two lakes of Amenta. The Samoan deluge lasted unt il the seventh day, like the Babyl oni an. As it is said of Lu, “He was not many days afloat, som e say six, when (on the seventh) his vessel rested on the top of a mount ain called Malata” (Turner, Sam oa, p. 12) . In a papyr us at Turin the god who claims to be self - existent says, “I make the waters and the Mehur a com es into being. ” That is heaven as the celestial water. In a hym n to Pt ah it is said, “The waters of the inunda tion cove r the lofty trees of every region. ” These, how ever, are the waters of Nnu or the Nun (Renouf , H. L., pp. 221 - 2), and not the ove rwhelming flood of water on the earth. When the Mehur a first came into existenc e it was a heaven imaged as the water that was undi vided by the astronom ers, the islands or other land - limits that were figur ed in the aërial vast; and heaven as the celestial water was the Nnu or Nun. A “true expl anation of the world - wide deluge myths” no longe r need be sought for in the book of Genesis or in the tradition of a great flood that swept the plains of Mesopot amia; nor in any vast cataclysm that might have been caused by the melting of the ice at the close of the glacial period (Huxl ey, Ninetee nth Century, 1890 , pp. 14 - 15). We find by the Egypt ian wisdom that “the deluge ,” as it is com monl y termed, belongs neither to geogr aphy, nor geology , nor history. Geology, the latest of the sciences, was com paratively unknow n to the early world. Geology di d not furnish the kind of fact with which the ancient science was conc erned. Whatsoever 548 the Egypt ian “mystery - teachers of the depths” may have know n of mines and metals, mythol ogy was not geologi cal in the least degree. Neither did the Kamite chronol ogy include the com put ation of geologi cal time. It was conf idently asserted by Buns en that the deluge legend was unknow n to the Egypt ians. But they had all the deluge s that ever were, as the Hir - Seshta informed Solon, includi ng the “great deluge of all,” whereas the Greeks coul d onl y muster two. But in no case were these geologi cal catastrophe s. M. Lenor mant asserted that the story of the deluge was unknow n to the black race, and that “while the tradition hol ds so cons iderable a place in the legenda ry memo ries of all branches of the Aryan peopl e, the monum ents and original texts of Egypt , with their many cosmogoni c speculations , have not afforded one even distant allusion to this cataclysm.” The statement sounds author itative, but it is not true. Professor Sayce, follow ing Lenor mant, asserts that “no tradition of a deluge had been preserved by the Egypt ians” ( Fresh Light from the Monum ents, p. 47) . This com es of raking for hum an history, and for not hing else, in the Semitic débris of the Kamite astronom ical mythol ogy. Both are wrong, and bot h were equa lly misled through looki ng"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"for the deluge with the Semitic versions for their determinatives. Bibliology has gone perilous ly near to ruining Assyriology and Egypt ology for the first generations of stude nts in th is count ry. It is fortuna te for genui ne schol arship that there are livers out of Bible - bur dened Britain. To identify the deluge - legend in Egypt you must know how to look for it; no use in peering through the Semitic spectacles. The legend of Atlantis re - t old by Plato in Timæus was Egypt ian, and no doubt with the legend came the name of lost Atlantis, transliterated through the Greek. As Egypt ian, the word atr=atl has several meanings in relation to water. Atru is the water, the water - flood , the water - bound ary, limit, measure, front ier, embankm ent. Egypt ian in the early stages had no sign of l. But by subs titution of the later letter l for r the word atr becom es atl, the root of such names as Atlantis and Atlantic. With this change of letter the Atarantes of Africa becom e the Atalantes. The word antu or anti signi fies a division of land. Thus Atlanti, whence Atlantis, as a com pound of two Egypt ian words, denot es the land divided by the waters, or canals of water. Now the earliest nui t or nomes of Egypt were s even in num ber, and these were seven territories marked out, limited, and bounde d by the atlu (atru) as river, canal, condui t, or water - bounda ries. In the valley of the Nile, the land was bounde d first by water as the natural bounda ry, and seven nom es woul d be enclosed by seven atlu, long before the land limit was marked out by the bound ary - stone s or stelæ. And atl - antu, we sugge st, is the original for the names of Atlantis and the Atlantic Ocean. It is not iceable that in the Nahua tl voc abul ary atl is also the water name, and that atlan denot es the bor der or bounda ry of the water (Baldw in, Ancient America, p. 179 ). Atlan thus becom es a name for the mound , island, or tesh that was placed as a limit to the water in Egypt . This woul d be the land of Atlan, as we find it bot h in Africa and America. There were seven such water limits to the land in Egypt when it was 549 divided into seven nom es. And seven astronom es named after these becom e the seven islands of the lost Atlantis, which sank in the celestial water s, the heptanom is of the seven lands below having been repeated in the mappi ng out of heaven in seven astronom es. The heptanom is above , like the one below , was formed of seven lands that were divided by the seven waters, canals, or atlu (atru), and bot h to gether cons tituted the Atlantis of Uranogr aphy , the onl y one that coul d ever be lost by the celestial waters ove rflow ing the celestial lands . The seven rulers of the astronom es attained the status of divine princes in the celestial heptanom is. And among th e nom es of Low er Egypt we find the nom e of the Prince of Annu; the nom e of the prince of Low er Egypt ; the nom e of Supt i (Sut); the nom e of Samhut it (Horus); the nome of Sebek; the nom e of Shu; the nom e of Hapi. Here then, if anyw here on earth, we find a ge ogr aphi cal prototype for the Atlantis that was lost in seven islands , according to the records kept by the astronom ers, which are preserved in the mythog raphy. Among the many type s of the heptanom is and its septenary of pow ers and stations of the pol e may be enum erated: — A mount with seven caves; seven islands in the sea; the seven - headed serpent whelmed beneath the waters; a tree with seven branches; a fish with seven fins; a pole with seven horns; a cross with seven arms; the seven suppor ting giants; the a rk of seven cubi ts; the boa t with seven Kabiri on boa rd; the group of seven cities."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" It is not necessary to suppos e that the Egyp tians were the helpless victims of their ow n sym bol ism, who lived in mortal dread of the celestial waters falling dow n and ove r whelming them in a deluge onc e for all. But there can be no doub t that the water - flood on earth against which the early race was pow erless produc ed a profound and permanent impression, so that the deluge idea became associated with the firmamental water. T his can be prove d by the mythical deluge dramatically represented in the Ritual. “I am the Father of the Inunda tion, ” says Anup at the nor thern pole, whence the waters issued in the deluge of the Milky Way, or White Nile of the Nun. The Egypt ian Ritual aff ords a study of the deluge mythos in the pha se of eschatology. The passage for the soul in death has long and uni versally been likened to a river or som e dark water flow ing betwixt the two worlds of earth and heaven. This in Egypt was the Nun. The way of t he gods in their ascent and descent to earth was by water. The way of soul s in their ascent to heaven is equa lly by water, whether in the ark of the moon, the bark of Orion, or the boa t of the sun. The manes on entering the other life thus addr esses the sa ilors of the solar bark, “O ye seamen of Ra, at the gloaming of day let me live after death, day by day, as dot h Ra.” That is by means of the boa t which keeps the sun or the soul of the deceased afloat upon the drow ning element (ch. 3). In the chapter for travelling on the road which is above the earth (ch. 4), the speaker says, “It is I who voya ge on the stream which divideth the divine pair.” These are the two sisters Isis and Nepht hys , whos e stations in the Osirian solar mythos were at the western and ea stern sides of the river which ran nor th and sout h in heaven as in Egypt . Som e proph etic tableaux show the deceased in his fune ral bark, speeding 550 before the wind with all sail set, having started on his way to the next world the very day that he took pos session of his new abode in death (Maspero, Egypt. Arch., p. 120) . Amongs t the words that are said on the day of bur ial to bring about “the resurrection and the glory,” the deceased asks that he may see the ship of the hol y Sahus traversing the sky; th at is, the ark of soul s represented in the cons tellation of Orion. He also pleads, “Let the divine vessel Neshemet adva nce to meet me.” The Osiris tells us that the name of his bark is “Collector of Soul s.” “The picture of it is the representation of his g lorious jour ney upon the canal” (ch. 58) . Safe in the ark, he crosses the waters in which the helpless soul s are wrecked. In the chapter by which the ship is sailed in the nether - world, the speaker not onl y sails across the water of Nnu, for he says, “I c om e from the lake of fire and flame, from the field of flame,” and he stands erect and safe “in the bark which the god is piloting, at the head of Aarru,” that is, on the sum mit of the mount , or final resting - place of the ark (Rit., ch. 98, Renouf ), which the deceased had safely reached through fire and flood. On entering the solar bark the Osiris says, “I have com e myself and delivered the deity from the pain and suffering that were in the trunk, in shoulder, and in leg. I have com e and healed the trunk an d fastened the shoul der and made firm the leg. And I embark for the voya ge of Ra.” The leg of Osiris, like the leg of Nut or the leg of Ptah, imaged the suppor ting pow er of the pole. The manes pleads, “Let not the Osiris Nu be shipw recked on the great voya ge” (ch. 130) . “Let not disasters reach him.” “May the steering be kept clear from misadve nture.” “Let me com e to see my father Osiris” (ch. 99). “O, thou ship"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"of the garden of Aarru, let me be conve yed to that bread of thy canal as my father, the great on e, who adva nceth in the divine ship” (ch. 106, Renouf ). “Lo, I sail the great bark on the stream of the god Hetep. I took it at the mansion of Shu” — the starry heaven (ch. 110, Renouf ). “I sail upon its stream and range within the garden of Hetep” (ch. 110 ) . When about to enter the bark of Ra, the speaker says, “O great one , let me be lifted into thy bark. Let me make head for thy staircase. Let me have charge of thos e who conve y thee, who are attached to thee, and who are of the stars which never set” (Rit. , ch. 102 ). These are the seven that pul l at the rope , or as we shoul d say, that keep the law of gravitation and equi poi se; the seven arms of the balance, or the seven bonds of the uni verse; the seven tow - ers that became the later seven row ers, sailors, or Kabiri. These are som etimes called the seven spirits of Annu, that is at the pol e, the mount of glory in the stellar mythos . Four of the seven can be identified as Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef, and Kabhs enuf (Rit., ch. 97). “Said at the bark: Staff of Anup, may I propi tiate thos e four glorified one s who follow after the master of all things ?” These are four of the seven that pul led the bark up to the landi ng - stage upon the summit with the primitive rope , who are afterwards statione d as the four oars at the four c ardinal poi nts, in a later heaven, and also as the children of Horus, who had previous ly been his brothers. There is a great bursting forth of the floods in Amenta, described in the Ritual as a vast and ove rwhelming inunda tion. This 551 passage of the wa ters show s the deluge - legend in the Kamite eschatology. The Osiris calls upon the lord of the flood, “the great one who is shor eless,” to save him. “Do thou save me!” “I who know the deep waters” is my name. But “I am not one who drow neth. Blessed are they who see the bou rne. Beautiful is the god of the motionless heart who causeth the stay of the ove rflow ing — or the flood. Behol d! there com eth forth the lord of life, Osiris thy suppor t, who abideth day by day.” “The tunne ls of the earth have given me birth. ” This ove rflow of the great waters called the flood also occurs in Sheol amongs t the other trials and tribul ations of the sufferer represented in the Hebrew book of Psalms. “The channe ls of waters appe ared, and the founda tions of the world were laid bare” (ch. 18) . “He drew me out of great waters.” As one means of salvation from the ove rwhelming waters the manes clings to the sycamore - tree which stande th in the lake of Akeb. He exclaims, “I embrace the sycamore, I am uni ted to the sycamore - tree.” That is, to Osiris in the tree, the tat or pol e, the type of fixity to be clasped for safety amid the waters rising round the soul in death and in the darkne ss of the nether earth. Sufficient mythical matter for a legend of the deluge and the ark may be found in th e 64t h chapter of the Ritual. It is recorded in the rubrical directions appe nde d to the chapter that it “was discove red on a plinth of the god of the Hennu - bark by a master - builder of the wall in the time of King Septi the victorious .” Septi, or Seti, was a king in the first dyna sty who lived and ruled in Egypt from 6,000 to 7,000 years ago. At that time the chapter was rediscove red as an ancient writing. We learn from this that the bursting forth of the waters in an ove rwhelming flood was based upon the na tural fact of the inunda tion in Egypt . The imagery had been reproduc ed in heaven, and also in Amenta, the low er Egypt of the nether - world. A great catastrophe caused by the waters that have broke n out of bounds is more than onc e referred to in the Ritual. The Osiris says to the pow ers, “Grant"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ye that I may have the com mand of the water, even as the might y Sut had the com mand of his enemies on the day of disaster to the earth. May I prevail ove r the long - armed one s in their (four) corners, even as that glori ous and ready god prevailed ove r them” (Renouf , ch. 60) . The bur sting forth of the waters is described as a great disaster. In this chapter there is an appl ication of the deluge imagery to the sun in the mythos and the departed soul in the eschatology. Wit h the Egypt ians, the supr eme type of helpfulness and charity, or of love to the neighbour , was an ark or boa t that offered safety to the shipw recked amidst the waters. Hence, when pleading in the Hall of Judgm ent the speaker claims to have “done the right thing in Tamerit” (Egypt ), he clinches it by saying, “I have given bread to the hungr y, water to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, and a boa t to the shipw recked” (ch. 125) . The subj ect - matter is very ancient. It belongs to that early time when Sut was a pre - Osirian form of the Good Being, in relation to the pol e, the dog - star, and the inunda tion of the Nile. Here the deluge of the inun dation is a deluge of destruction directed against the workers of evil. In shor t, it doe s what the 552 inunda tion did fo r Egypt in washing away the result of drought , in cleansing from corrupt ion and restoring a healthy new life to the land. Hence the deceased desires to have the same com mand ove r the waters in Amenta that Sut had when they bur st forth in a drow ning flood. Thus , 6,000 years ago the so - called “deluge legend” was ancient in Egypt , and it belonge d to the time when Sut, in command of the waters, had not lost his place in glory; and his deluge was employe d to destroy the Sebau, the Sami, the Apap - dragon, the long - armed one s, and other evil enemies of God and man who were not hum an beings . In the same chapter Osiris has supe rseded Sut as lord of the flood . Further, the two divine sisters Isis and Nepht hys were imaged as two birds. The ark of Nnu described in the Ri tual is conduc ted ove r the Nun by two birds which represent the two sister - godde sses Isis and Nepht hys . It is said to these in relation to the inunda tion, “Ye two divine hawks upon you r gables, who are giving attentive heed to the matter, ye who conduc t th e ship of Ra, adva ncing onw ards from the highe st place of the ark in heaven.” It is also said to Osiris, “Thy two sisters Isis and Nepht hys com e to thee, and they conve y to thee the great extent (of the waters) in thy name of the great extende r as lord of the flood (Teta, 274) .” These allusions show that there was an ark to which the two birds were attached as conduc tors. They are represented as hawks, but as the birds of east and west, or the earlier sout h and nor th, are equi valent to the dove of day and t he raven of night in Semitic tradition. Isis was the lady or bird of dawn, and Nepht hys the lady of darkne ss. In this, the solar pha se, the passage of the ark was from west to east, where it was conduc ted by the two birds or godde sses of the west and east. Heaven was floode d with a deluge of light at daybr eak, and the nether earth was inunda ted with a deluge of darkne ss. The ark conduc ted through the waters by the two birds of light and darkne ss, or east and west, is described in a twofold character as the shrine of Osiris in the centre of the earth, and also as the ark of Ra that reaches the highe st poi nt in heaven (ch. 64, lines 5 - 8). It is the ark of the “lord of resurrections , he who com eth forth from the dus k and whos e birth is from the hous e of death,” or, from Amenta, as the re - arising solar god . The ark that rested on Mount Nizir in the Babyl oni an legend, or Mount Ararat in the Hebrew"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"version, and on Mount Manu in the Hindu account , is described in the Ritual as the “ship of Ra” which attains “the hig hest place of the ark in heaven,” with the mount of glory for anchor age and the pol e for moor ing - pos t. The deceased in the character of Nnu repul ses the water of the deluge . “He is the image of Nnu, lord of the inunda tion and father of the gods ” (Rit., ch. 136 A ). He manœ uvr es the ark or bark with which he voya ges in heaven. “He turns back the deluge ” that “devastates the leg of Nut,” and “brings back strengt h to the fainting gods ” by such means of dealing with the waters. In this chapter of the Ritual the d evastating deluge is also allude d to (in line 1) as a mode of judgm ent. It is directed against the rebels. Thos e who are in the ark or the solar bark are saved from the great cataclysm which “devastates the leg of Nut” or sweeps away the suppor t of the cel estial waters, whilst the rebels are ove rthrow n and reduc ed to non - existence. The rebels against Ra are identical with the “men” or the “race” that spoke and plotted 553 evil against him in anot her version of the deluge myth. After the deluge of devastat ion there is a renewal, rejuve nescence, and rebirth. Seb and Nut (earth and heaven) are pleased at heart; they grow young again. The leg of Nut, which the deluge devastated, was a very early type of the celestial pol e, as the bulwark, prop, or mainstay aga inst the waters of the firmament. In one pha se the ark of Nnu is the ark of the Nun as the celestial water. It is depicted in chapter 44 crossing the water of Putrata, the lake of darkne ss, and cutting its way through the coils of the Apap - dragon. The spea ker is one of the manes in Amenta about to embark on boa rd the boa t of soul s. He says, “O thou who sailest the ship of Nnu across that gul f which is voi d, let me sail the ship; let me fasten the tackle in peace, in peace. Let me fasten my tackle and com e f orth.” “The place is empty into which the starry one s fall dow n headlong upon their faces and find not hing by which they can raise themselves up. ” The ship of Nnu is facing the west, where it has to cross the lake of darkne ss, or the great gul f of the wate rs, by night , the lurking - place of the devour ing dragon, into which the setting stars go dow n, also the hum an soul s that have not attained salvation on boa rd the ark. We learn previous ly that the deluge is imminent. In other words, the waters of the Nun ar e traversed by the ark at night with the rescued soul s on boa rd. The shrine at the centre of the earth is one with the shrine in the ark of earth, and the ark of earth in one character is the ship of Nnu in the other; it is the ark of Osiris or Ptah in Ame nta, and the ark of Ra in heaven, when “it com es forth in the east.” But whether in the depth or height , the bark of inert Osiris or the living Ra woul d still be the bark of Nnu, the ark that swam the deluge of the celestial water. It is said that the bark of Ra is in dange r of the whirlwind and storm, which affords a glimpse of the tempest com monl y associated with the deluge in the legends and traditions of the great disaster. But the Osiris - Nu, or Nnu as god of the inunda tion, turneth bac k the water - flood , the deluge that has nearly ove rwhelmed the “leg of Nut” (or the pol e) which suppor ts the firmament; and he keeps the com panions safe who are on boa rd the bark unt il the resting - place is finally attained upon the sum mit of the mount . The land that is reac hed at last by the mariners in the ark of Nnu is called the “tip of heaven,” at the place of “com ing forth from the swathings in the garden of Aarru,” and the “com ing forth in exul tation. ” These are the names of that celestial count ry for which the bark or ark of Nnu was sailed (ch. 99) . It is also called the ship of the garden of Aarru (ch. 106) . The speaker in chapter 98"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"says, “I stand erect in the bark which the god is piloting . . . at the head of Aarru.” This is the Aarru of spirits perfected in the es chatology, the sum mit of which is in the region of the never - setting stars at the highe st poi nt of heaven. In the various deluge legends the ark was strande d on the top of the mount , as it was on Ararat and Nizir, Manu and Malata. Here the ark of Nnu becom es the bark of the blessed, whos e landi ng - place in heaven is called Mount Hetep, at the sum mit of the pol e. The pol e is the mooring - pos t to which the cable of the vessel was made fast. The voya ge com eth to an end, and praise is uttered to the gods who are in the garden of everlasting peace and 554 plenty. When the passenge rs appr oach the landi ng - stage, Heaven ope ns its embracing arms; the lamps of heaven are lighted, the Khabsu gods rise up to offer acclamations . The “old one s” and thos e who have gone bef ore are said to welcom e the voya gers at their arrival on the mount of assembly and reuni on. These are the two classes of spirits, supe rhum an and hum an, elemental and ancestral, otherwise called “the gods and the glorified.” There was no need for an altar t o be raised at this landi ng - stage upon the sum mit at the moment of debarkation to com plete the parallel with the landi ng on Mount Ararat or Nizir in the Semitic versions . The Ritual preserves the astral mythos in the form of drama. The voya gers who land u pon Mount Hetep are soul s of the departed, and not hum an beings . The rende ring in the Ritual is not historical, not merely mythical, not simply astronom ical. Sacrificial ceremoni es are performed upon the altar and offerings made at the mom ent of debarkatio n. These are in two categor ies. In one Noah, Nnu, or the Osiris - Nu presents the obl ation in propi tiation to the gods upon the mount . In the second, thos e who have gone before as the ancestral spirits make offerings of the sacred cakes and other forms of fo od to the new - com ers whom they welcom e as their fellow - citizens to the eternal city (ch. 98, Renouf ) on their landi ng from the ark of Nnu. Thus far we trace the deluge - legend and the ark of Nnu in the phas e of eschat ology by means of the Ritual . We now tu rn to representations of the subj ect in the astronom ical mythol ogy which in earlier ages preceded thos e of the eschatology. In several chapters of the Ritual a breaking forth of the celestial waters in a typi cal deluge is allude d to or described. In chapt er 136 A it is said of the god who has the mastery ove r the inunda tion, “He turneth back the water flood which is ove r the thigh of the godde ss Nut at the staircase of Seb.” The ove rwhelming water has here ascende d to the sum mit of the mount or staircase, w hich, like the leg of Nut, was a figur e of the pol e. Thus the deluge is portrayed as subm erging the pol e when this was figur ed as the leg of Nut, and the water flood was then turned back by Nnu, the lord of the celestial water, whos e ark of salvation from the deluge is the ship of heaven by name. How soever cons tellated, the bark of Nnu was the ark of heaven on the celestial water. Now when the change was made from a heaven of seven divisions to one of eight , as described in the very ancient papyr us cont aini ng the hym n to the god Shu, it is por trayed as supe rseding the ark of seven cubi ts with an ark of eight cubi ts, or the heptanom is by the octona ry. This also indi cates a change of pol e, the pol e that was imaged by the staff of Shu the giant. The hym n to Shu include s the legend of a deluge . It is called “a chapter of the excellent songs which dispel the immerged,” that is, thos e who were drow ned in the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"deluge as the evil creatures of darkne ss (Magic Papyr us, Records of the Past, vol . X, p. 137) . It is said, “ Thos e who are immerged do not pass along. Thos e who pass along do not plunge . They remain floating on the waves like the dead bodi es on the inunda tion of the Nile, and they shut their mout hs as the seven great dunge ons are closed with an eternal seal.” Now , there is reason to suppos e that these seven great dunge ons , sealed with an eternal seal, were a form of the supe rseded heaven in seven divisions answering to 555 the seven caves in the Mexican mount , and to the book of seven seals in Revelation. In the same papyr us there is “a book of magical spells for remaining as dw ellers in the count ry” where the great catastrophe occurs; it is said that “Horus has given the warning cry,” “subs idence of the count ry!” This, as we interpret the text, is at the catacly smal endi ng in time and space that was mythically dramatized as a deluge or inunda tion which ove rwhelmed the land above and effaced certain landm arks in the celestial waters. The cubi t may stand for a general measure. Four measures or cubi ts typi fied an ar k of the four qua rters in space. Seven cubi ts were a four th of twenty - eight measures in the circle of twenty - eight luna r signs . Thus seven cubi ts or measures in an ark, shrine, or tabernacle formed a figur e of heaven in seven divisions . And when the heptan om is was follow ed by the heaven of Taht, the ark of eight cubi ts supe rseded the shrine of seven cubi ts, and the ape became the type of Taht in the octona ry instead of in the heptanom is. The ark of seven cubi ts was cont inue d as a sacred type in the religiou s ceremoni es. For instance, it is com mande d by the rubric to chapter 133 , Papyrus of Nnu, that this chapter shall be recited ove r a boa t four cubi ts in lengt h on which the divine sove reign chiefs of the cities have been painted and a heaven with its stars por trayed. But in the Papyr us of Ani the boa t is ordered to be made seven cubi ts in lengt h. This, then, is a figur e of the ark of seven cubi ts which preceded the ark of eight cubi ts and the heaven of four qua rters that was imaged by the boa t of four cubi ts . The heptanom is had been figured as an ark of seven measures in the waters of heaven, and this was follow ed by the ark of eight measures as the shrine of the kaf - ape, a zoot ype of Taht the luna r god , after there had been “a subs idence of the count ry” and the “secret abys ses of the Nun” and the founda tions of the deep had been laid ope n at the time of the deluge . There had been no moon established in the stellar mythos . Otherwise stated, time was not yet com put ed by the luna r reckoni ng, or by Taht, the rec kone r of time. In this sense the moon was not created unt il after the deluge. Thus , in som e of the legends the moon becom es a resting - place or ark of safety riding on the waters. At Hawaii the typi cal deluge was called “the flood of the moon. ” Meru is like wise show n to be a form of the mythical mount that reached up to the moon. Also it is related in one of the Hebrew legends that paradise was exempt from the deluge or was preserved from the great disaster because it was planted on the sum mit of a mount ain reaching to the moon . In the Egypt ian inscription called “the Destruction of Manki nd” there is a rebellion against Ra, the sun - god, follow ed by a great destruction and a deluge . Atum - Ra had been established as the king of gods and men, the god by himself. There is a revol t against his supr emacy. He called the elder gods around him for cons ultation, and says to them, “You ancient gods , behol d the beings who are bor n of myself; they utter words"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"against me. Tell me what you woul d do in these circum stances. Be hol d, I have waited, and I have not destroye d them unt il I shoul d hear what you have to say.” The elder gods advi se that they may go and smite the enemies who plot evil against Ra, and let none remain alive. The rebels are then destroye d “in 556 three da ys of navigation.” When the deluge of blood is ove r it is said by the majesty of Ra, “I shall now protect men on this account .” “I raise my hand (in toke n) that I shall not again destroy men.” The rebel pow ers, headed by the coiling and cons tricting Apap - r eptile vom iting the deluge of the dark by night , were always in revol t against the lord of light , and this legend com memorates their ove rthrowal in a deluge of blood . The chief agent in the work of venge ance is Hathor , the luna r godde ss, who is aided by th e solar godde ss, Sekhe t, in executing the com mands of Ra. The godde ss started; she smote the enemies ove r all the land because they had plotted evil against the majesty of Ra. These enemies are drow ned in the deluge then pou red out ; “the fields were entire ly cove red with water through the will of his majesty the god. And there came the godde ss (Hathor ) in the morning, and she found the fields cove red with water; and she was pleased with it, and drank to her heart’s cont ent. She saw no more of the enemies, w ho were sunk in the waters that represented the flood of light which was now pour ed forth by Ra at dawn, and in which the creatures of the dark were drow ned. It is said by his majesty, living and well, to his follow ers, “I call before my face Shu, Tefnut, Seb, Nut, and the fathers and mothers who were with me when I was yet in the Nun, and I prescribe to Nnu, who brings his com panions with him”; these are the instructions given by the god to Nnu: “Bring a small num ber of them (his com panions ), that the bein gs may not see them” – these beings are the creatures about to be destroye d in the com ing flood – “and that their heart may not be afraid, thou shalt go with them into the ark or sanctuary unt il I shall go with Nnu to the place where I stand, ” or to the sum mit of the moun t on which the legenda ry ark at last was safely lande d. The ark or sanctuary here indicated is the figure of a newly founde d heaven which follow s the deluge by which a previous world was wrecked. The inscription is very dilapidated, nevertheles s it obvi ous ly cont ains a creation of “the men,” as in the Assyrian revol t in heaven in the place of the creatures thus destroye d. When “his majesty arrived in the sanctuary,” “the men” were goi ng forth and bearing their bow s and shoot ing their arrow s agai nst his enemies. These were not the enemies but the defende rs of Ra. Hence it was said to Ra by “the men,” “Let us smite the enemies, the rebels.” The celestial water was primarily assigne d to the female Nu or Nut. Her heaven was imaged as the cow . At fir st it was the water - cow, and afterwards the milch - cow . And there was Nut (with) the “majesty of Ra on her back”; she was carrying the god in her form of the cow . This mode of locom otion on the cow ’s back or between the cow ’s hor ns (see the pictures) is now to be supe rseded by the building of the solar bark. “Said by the majesty of the god , I have resolved to be lifted up.” “Who is it that Nut will trust with it?” i.e., with the new ark or sanctuary of the god. “Carry me, that I may see.” Said by the majesty of the god , “Let a field of rest extend itself,” and there arose a field of rest. “Let the plants grow there,” and there arose the Sekhe t - Hetep, or fields of the papyr us - reed. The beings who were destroye d were Sebau and Sami, representatives of the plagu es of"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Egypt . The men who are created in their place are of the starry race. “The majesty of the god saw the inne r part of the 557 sanctuary in which he had been lifted up” (or the ark in which he made his voya ge ove r the celestial waters), and he said, “ I assemble and give pos session of these multitude s of men, I establish as inha bitants all the beings which are suspende d in the sky, the stars,” and Nut began to tremble very strongl y. “I assemble there the multitude s that they may celebrate thee,” and the re arose the multitude s. These are stars in one categor y, and in the other soul s that were collected in the ark of salvation (Rit., ch. 58) or the ark of Nnu — that is, the ark of heaven and of the god of the celestial water. “Said by the majesty of Ra, My s on Shu, take with thee my daught er Nut, and be the gua rdian of the multitude s which live in the noc turnal sky. Bear them on thy head, and be their fosterer.” This is an allusion to his raising ove rhead the beautiful creation of the starry firmament which S hu sustains, whether in the form of the cow of Nut, the water of the Nun, or the ark of Nnu. After the destruction there is to be a new creation, and Ra is in need of suppor t from Nnu and his com panions . “Said by the majesty of the god (or his majesty) to the majesty of Nnu, My limbs have suffered long; I cannot walk without suppor t, or have others to suppor t me.” This will show that Nnu occupi es the place of Noah in relation to the bui lding of the ark or sanctuary, and in accordance with the instructions r eceived from Ra. Ra informs Nnu that he needs som e other means of suppor ting himself than the back of the cow . He calls upon Nnu and his three sons to assist him against his enemies the rebels. Thus the cow of Nut was to be supe rseded by the ark of Nnu whe n he became the representative of the heavenly water and master of the inunda tion. Nut says dut ifully that she will act as it seems good to her father Nnu (l. 30). There had been various kinds and forms of the celestial or astronom ical ark that was at firs t necessitated as the means of carriage for the gods , because the heavens had been imaged as the firmamental water. The great mother Apt, who was the image of all firstness bot h by name and nature in the likeness of the pregna nt hippopo tamus, was a kind of ark, and pos sibly the earliest that ever crossed the waters of the Nun. She carried her young one s in the cabin that was uterine. Child - Horus on his papyrus - reed was in the ark that saved him from the waters, as the sign was cons tellated in the planisphe r e of Dende rah. The Pleiades formed an ark as cons tellation for the Khut i; the Lesser Bear for Anup and the seven voya gers round about the pol e. Orion was the ark of the hol y sahus , with Horus at the look - out . The ark of Taht was in the crescent moon that s ailed the azure deep by night. Then Ra, the solar deity, resolved on being lifted up as god alone , the onl y one , who supe rseded all the elder pow ers. A new heaven was to be his tabernacle. This was the ark of Nnu. The change from one heaven to the other im plied a great destruction of the rebels. A deluge was the modus ope randi , and the ark the means of safety for the few just men and true, toge ther with their cons orts, who were saved from the catastrophe . As a sym bol in sign - langua ge the ark was bui lt by Nn u, the master of the firmamental water, for the means of safety in the world all water against the com ing flood and the subs idence of land, which was the land of Nnu. 558"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" In space it was the ark of the four qua rters that was prope lled by the four paddl e s of Hapi, Tuamutef, Kabhs enuf , and Amsta. Hence Seb (or the earth) “abideth stably” by means of the four rudde rs or oars (Rit., ch. 99). Hence also the four - squa re box that imaged the ark of Noë on the well - know n Apamean coin. In Akar, or Amenta, it was t he ark of Osiris; in earth the ark of Seb; in heaven the ark of Ra. Its mainm ast was the pol e. The night light on the masthead was the pol e - star. In the myth it was the ark of Ra, “the bark of millions of years”; in the eschatology it is the ark of salvatio n, the refuge for eternity. The sinki ng one s had looke d for their deliverance from the waters to the bark of Anup, voya ging round the pol e; also to the crescent - shaped arc of Taht seen in the new moon; then to the ark of Horus and the “hol y sahus ” cons tel lated in Orion; and finally they sought salvation in the ark which Nnu and his three sons , Shu, Taht, and Seb, were now to bui ld for Ra, the solar god . The Egypt ian ark or ship of Nnu is the ark of heaven, or, conve rsely stated, the ark of heaven is the s hip of Nnu; and the ark of heaven was the revol ving sphe re conf igur ated as a sailing vessel with two masts as we have found it figured by the mystery - teachers in their uranogr aphi c imagery of the celestial deluge . The ark is por trayed in the act of sailing ove r a vast, unf athomable, hol low void of formless space; as it is said, “the place is empty.” Into this the helpless one s fall headlong unl ess they are saved on boa rd the ark. In a vigne tte to the Papyrus of Anha i, it is Nnu that is seen upl ifting the bo at of the gods with seven persons on boa rd, besides the beetle and the solar disk. The figure of Nnu in this drawing is bot h male and female, Nnu and Nut in one figur e (Budge , Papy rus of Anhai , pl. 8). Among the Assyrian fragm ents there is reference to a l egend which has not com e dow n to us. In this it is said that Ishtar couns elled the destruction of manki nd, whereas in the extant account of the deluge the godde ss bewails their destruction and grieves bitterly ove r the loss of her children. Now Ishtar is a n Akka do - Assyrian form of the godde ss Hathor , who in the Egypt ian mythos couns els the destruction of the beings , and executes the judgm ent passed upon them by the gods , with no wailing or weeping afterwards. This poi nts back to the Egypt ian original of ano ther Akka do - Assyrian version. According to the Hebrew reading of the legend, the deluge was provoke d by the sins of men. “The Lord saw that the wickedne ss of man was great in the earth,” and he determined to blot out and obl iterate the race; . . . . “but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord” (Gen. VI. 5 - 8). The Chaldean and Hindu legends know not hing of hum an sin as a cause of the deluge . The sin against the gods , however, is described as the cause of a deluge in the so - called “destruction of men.” Ra says to Nun and others of the elder pre - solar gods , “Behol d the beings who are bor n of myself; they utter words against me.” That is, they are in rebellion against the one true god. But these beings in this case were elemental, not mortal, and the sin was not hum an. When the deluge or destruction is ove r and past, Ra swears that he will not again destroy men. “Said by Ra: I now raise my hand that I shall no more destroy men.” “I 559 "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"shall now protect men on account of this.” So the Hebrew deity prom ises t hat he “will not again curse the ground any more for the sake of men: neither will I again smite any more any living thing,” as in the “deluge of destruction. ” This is the same thing, onl y written out large and told as if it were a hum an history, whereas the original is mythol ogi cal. It relates to the supe rseding of the earlier gods , Nnu, Seb, Shu, and Taht, by Ra as the supr eme being, or rather these old gods and elemental pow ers are to becom e the servants of his majesty Ra in the new heaven now establish ed for the keeping of perfect time, with Ra as the head ove r all. Ra had resolved to be lifted up in an ark or sanctuary. Nnu and his small number of com panions who enter the ark or sanctuary are eight in num ber, four male, Nnu, Seb, Shu, and Taht, and fo ur female, Sekhe t, Nut, Hathor, and Tefnut , who can be paired thus : — (1) Nnu with Sekhe t, (2) Shu with Tefnut , (3) Seb with Nut (4) Taht with Hathor . Nnu was the deity of the heavenly water, and Sekhet is in pos session of the water on the night of the great disaster or the deluge (Rit., 57, 1, 2); Sekhe t is also called the “very great one of the liquid dom ain” (149) . These are certainly a pre - Semitic form of the eight in the ark, and as Nnu was the first - bor n of these gods , he may be called the father of the other three in the ark as represented in the biblical version. The whol e world, how ever, that was divided between the three sons of Nnu, Shu, Seb, and Taht, was not on our earth; was not in Africa, Asia, or Europe . Shu was to be the gua rdian of the multit ude s in the noc turnal sky, Seb of the serpents in the cycles of time, and to Taht were assigne d the nations of the north. Taht had a doubl e por tion. Ra says, “I shall give thee to raise thy hand in the presence of the gods . I shall give thee to embrace the two par ts of the sky. I shall give thee to turn thys elf tow ard the nor thern nations .” This looks as if Taht were the prototype of Japhe th. Shu, whos e name signi fies shade, and who was to be the gua rdian of thos e who are in the sky of night , agrees with Ha m, the dark of colour or black. It was Shu who might have seen his father Nnu by night with his person expos ed, as it was his work to lift up the noc turnal heaven or Nnu. This leaves Shem as the representative of Seb. Seb is the father of Horus on earth, a nd, as it was suppos ed, the Hebrew Messiah was to descend from Shem. Thus it is pos sible to identify the new poi nt of departure for the threefold human race derived from Shem, Ham, and Japhe th, cons idered to be the fathers of three different and diverse ra ces of mankind. Ra describes the group of elder gods who preceded him as the fathers and the mothers. “Said by his majesty, I call before my face Shu, Tefnut , Seb, Nut, and the fathers and mothers who were with me when I was still in Nun, ” or previous ly to his issuing from the lotus in the bos om of the heavenly water. Here we have the “fathers and mothers” of the new race or races in the new world that follow ed the flood ready to the hand of the “sacred historian.” These fathers and mothers are eight in num ber all told, who are mentione d by name: Nnu and Sekhe t, Seb and Nut, Shu and Tefnut , Taht and Hathor . These are eight persons in four pairs of cons orts, exactly the same as the eight cons orts in the ark of Noah. 560 The moon - god Taht becom es the enlarg er of the dom ains of Ra, as his luna r representative by night . Ra calls Taht before him: “Said by the majesty of the god (or his majesty) to Taht, Com e, let us leave the sky and my abode , because I wish to make a lum inary in the inferior sky and in the dee p region where thou inscribest the inha bitants,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"and thou art the gua rdian of thos e who do evil . . . . . the follow ers whom my heart abhor s. But thou art my abode , the god of my abod e: behol d, thou wilt be called Tehut i, the hous e of Ra. I shall give thee to send (lacuna ) . . . . and there arose the ibis of Taht. I shall give thee to raise thy hand in presence of the gods , and there arose two wings of the ibis of Taht. I shall give thee to embrace the two parts of the sky with thy beauty and thy rays, and t here arose the luna r crescent of Taht. I shall give thee to turn thys elf tow ards the nor thern nations , and there arose the cynoc epha lus of Taht which is in his escort. Thou art unde r my dom inion.” This was written in the Book of Atum - Ra, who was also the g od Huhi =Ihuh . Thus , in this new creation of Ra which was established after the old heaven had been ove rwhelmed by the deluge , the moon - god Taht was made the enlarger of the dom ains of Ra. As we read in the texts, “Ra created him a beautiful light to show t he name of his evil enemy,” the Apap - dragon of darkne ss. This enlargement turns on the moon - god becom ing the ruler for Ra by night and establishing his sove reignt y ove r the black race in the dom ain of Sut and in the inferior hemisphe re. The “enlarging” in the Hebrew version is at the expe nse of Ham (=Kam, the black): “A servant of servants shall he be unt o his brethren,” but “God enlarge Japhe th.” Ham is treated in the märchen as the “evil enemy” Apap, or the black Sut in the mythos , thus making the legend ethni cal by this perversion of the meaning. Enlargement of the world denot es the formation of a heaven on a larger scale. Thus Taht, like Japhe th, was the enlarger or the enlarged. Also one mode of the enlarging was by Taht becom ing a lum inary in the infer ior sky and in the region of Amenta. And here we com e upon the probable origin of the cursing of Canaan in the Semitic travesty. Ham=Kam represents the pow er and the peopl e of darkne ss. Taht is to enlarge the bor ders of light at the expe nse of the dom ain o f darkne ss. It is said to Taht by Ra, “In the deep region where thou inscribest the inha bitants, thou art the keeper of thos e who do evil, the follow ers whom my heart abhor s.” These were the darkies and the “black - heads” in the dark land of Amenta, who are to be subj ect to the rule of Taht by night , which has been conve rted in the Semitic perversion of the mythos into the servitude of Canaan and the children of Ham. When it had been discove red that the moon derived its light and glory from the uns een sun t here was a change of status for them both. The moon was previous ly a mother to the child of light whom she was una ble to affiliate. And now , as it was mythically rende red, she learned that she was a wife (hemt) as well as a mother, and that her infant was begot ten by the solar god. The transaction is por trayed as one of the mysteries of Amenta in the Ritual (ch. 80) . The lady who gives light in darkne ss by night and 561 ove rthrow s the devour ing mons ters describes herself as a kind of ravisher to Hu the so lar god. She retires with him to the vale of Abydos when she goe s to rest. She seized upon the sun - god in the place where she found him. The result of this is that the twins Sut and Horus, the pow ers of darkne ss and light , that were previous ly bor n of the mother alone , are now attribut ed to the sun - god Hu or Ra as his children. Hathor had been the luna r lady, the slayer of the evil pow ers of darkne ss, and now the male god Taht is equi ppe d in the hous e or ark of the moon as the teller of time for Ra. He is d esigna ted the “teller of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"decrees which Ra hath spoke n in heaven” for Horus to execute on earth and in Amenta, with Taht and Anup as his two chief witnesses. After the deluge in “the destruction of manki nd” the god Ra establishes a cove nant with thos e who have escaped from the flood. He says that what he com mande d is well done , and that the destruction of his enemies remove s destruction from themselves. “Said by the majesty of Ra, It is well done , all this. I shall now protect men on account of this. Said b y Ra, I now raise my hand that I shall not destroy men,” i.e. not again. The making of this cove nant after the deluge is follow ed by the establishm ent of the New Year’s festival unde r the direction of the young priestesses of Hathor . “Hence com es it that l ibations are made unde r the directions of priestesses at the festival of Hathor through all men since the days of old,” (line 25) . When the luna r orb has been conve rted into the abode of Ra by night it is said, “And there arose the crescent moon of Taht.” Now the luna r crescent is the mythol ogical bow ( Proc. Soc . Bib. Arch., vol . VI, p. 131) . When this was written it had been appr ehende d that the moon derived its light from the hidde n sun, and shot the arrow s forth with the grow ing, stretching crescent that was drawn bow - like to the full with all the force of the young lion - god . It was for this that Taht the luna r deity was wanted by Ra as his bow man by night to shoot the arrow s of his light with the crescent of the mont hly moon for his bow . For this the bow was set in the noc turnal heaven by Ra: “And there arose the crescent moon of Taht”=the bow . The crescent moon was figur ed as the bow in heaven for a sign that there shoul d be no further deluge of destruction, because the keeping of time and season did not now depend upon the setting or non - setting stars. When time was reckone d by Tehut i the teller, by means of the dua l luna tion, a pow er was established that no flood which had subm erged the pol e or drow ned the heptanom is, or the heaven in ten divisions , cou ld in future ove rwhelm. Thus the deluge in the stellar mythos being ove r, and the pow ers of darkne ss being defeated and destroye d, chiefly through the direct agency of the luna r godde ss Hathor , the bow of Taht was set in heaven with its promise that the wa ters of the wrath of Ra shoul d not again cove r the earth. This, like all that is Egypt ian, was true mythos , not false expl anation of natural fact. It doe s not mean that the moon was actually created there and then to give light for the first time. 562 Th at woul d not be mythol ogy, but fictitious history. The Kamite account of this ancient wisdom is mythol ogi cal; the biblical is pretende d history. It has now to be show n that the bow in the Kamite mythos , which we look upon as the original, was not the rain bow , which was afterwards subs tituted as more natural by thos e who kne w no better. The luna r crescent was not onl y the bow of the deluge and sign of prom ise for all future time, it was also an ark of safety from the waters of the Nun, in which the young ch ild of light was bos om ed and rebor n of the luna r virgin mother. In the Osirian cult Osiris was rebor n in an ark of crescent shape which was a figur e of the crescent moon. It is said to Osiris in the preparatory pangs of birth, “Taht is a protection for the e. He placeth thy soul in the lunar bark in that name which is thine of god Moon” or god An, anot her name of Osiris ( Records, vol . II, p. 119) . The ark of the new moon was a means of resurrection for Osiris on the third night after his death, if we"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"count t he 17t h Athyr as one . The priests brought out the sacred coffer cont aining a little gol den ark. They also mode lled a little image of the crescent moon. The luna r mythos follow ed the stellar and preceded the solar, and in this the luna r crescent was an ark . In relation to which, the twin birds of light and darkne ss meet as it wee in one when the black and white ibis is the typical bird of the dua l luna tion, because, as Plutarch says, its feathers resembled the halves of the moon as the bird of light in one half and in the other half the bird of darkne ss. Now the ibis or hebi in Egypt ian is the messenge r by name, and the crescent moon was the ark of the lord of light upon the waters of night . In the “Destruction of Manki nd” Ra says to the moon - god , “Thou art my abode (his luna r ark), the god of my abode ; behol d, thou art called Taht, the abode of Ra. And there arose the ibis. I shall give thee to raise thy hand (Taht is also the hand of the gods ) in presence of the gods . And there arose the two wings of the ib is of Taht. I shall give thee to embrace the two parts of the sky. ” The one white and black bird, as representative of the moon in the Egypt ian rende ring, was the white bird of the new moon and the black bird of the old moon, equi valent to the dove of ligh t and the raven of darkne ss in the other legend. The moon was the ark on the waters as the abode of Ra by night or dur ing the deluge of the dark. The bird that was given by Ra for Taht to send forth from the ark was the bird of light and the bird of darkne ss. In the latter half of the luna tion, when the moon was renewed in its crescent shape, out flew the bird as messenge r of light across the waters of the Nun, and in the dark half of the disk, the bird was of raven hue . Such, we sugge st, was the genesis of the two birds, or the doubl e - feathered one , that issued from the luna r ark in the original mythos , which preserved the representation of the deluge and the ark and the two birds of day and night in the cult of Osiris or of Atum - Ra and Nnu. In the Chaldean account of the deluge the swallow is sent forth from the ark in addi tion to the raven and the dove . This also is a bird of the two sisters. In ch. 86 the manes makes his transformation into the swallow , when Horus is in 563 com mand of the bark (line 5). But in the Vigne tte (Pap. Of Ani) the bird called a swallow is a martin, anot her type of the white and black bird in one , like the ibis of the luna r ark. There is a chapter of the Ritual to be recited “when the moon renews itself on the first day of the m ont h,” the day, therefore, on which the luna r ark was launc hed upon the waters of the Nun and had to face the deluge . As it is said, “Osiris is enve lope d in storm and rain; he is enve lope d. But the beautiful Horus lende th succour daily. He driveth off the storm from the face of Osiris in the moon . Behold him com ing. He is Ra on his jour ney. He is the four gods who are ove r the uppe r region.” The Osiris arriveth at his ow n time, and by means of his rope s is brought to the light of day (Renouf , ch. 135 ). The ark of Osiris on the waters is described as a kind of hous e - boa t with gable ends , and the gable ends sugge st that from this particular form of the hous e and boa t in one may have descende d the well - know n children’s toy of Noah’s ark, as the ark of Noah in w hich eight soul s, four males and four females, were saved from the deluge , and the ark of Nnu in the Kamite astronom y. The new heaven was established on the four qua rters that were founde d upon the solstices and equi noxe s by the great architect Ptah. Thus the teba or squa re box is a figur e of the heaven that was based upon the four qua rters which follow ed the ark of seven"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"cubi ts, the ark of eight cubi ts, and other type s of the ark that floated on the celestial Nun or is said to be carried on the back of th e cow (Nut). The eight on boa rd were not hum an beings , but four gods and four godde sses, or eight heavenly bodi es. It is not the Hebrew Noah, as such, who will account for several other Noahs in different count ries, but the Kamite Nnu, the “lord of the pri mordial water” — Nnu who is designa ted the father of the gods . By aid of the Kamite Nnu we can more fully identify the Hottentot Noh, who, as they told Kolben (in 1713 ), “had entered the world by a sort of window .” The god Nnu of the Egypt ian mythos will exp lain why the hero of Polyne sian legend has the same name. The story is told by bot h Ellis and Fornande r. The survivor s from the deluge of Raiatea were saved on an island or mount called the tree reaching to the moon . In this version the mount and tree of t he Ritual are identical, the island being named after the tree, whilst the tree that reaches up to the moon corresponds to the mount of Am - Khemen and the establishm ent of luna r time. In the Hawaiian version, when Nnu had left his vessel, like Noah and Xisu thrus, after the flood, to offer sacrifice to the god Kane, he looke d up and saw the moon in the sky, and he thought this was the god, saying to himself, “You are Kane, no doubt , though you have transformed you rself to my sight !”, so he made his offering a nd ador ed the moon. Then Kane descende d on the bow and spoke reprovi ngly to Nnu, but , on account of it being a mistake, Nnu was forgiven by Kane, and the bow was left above in toke n of the god’ s forgiveness. It was natural for thos e who kne w not hing of th e Egypt ian wisdom to suppos e that the deluge , the ark, and the character of 564 Nevid, Nav, or Nevion, in the British mythos , was derived from the Hebrew records. But the true and final expl anation is that bot h were derived from the Egypt ian on separate lines of descent. The Druids were teachers of the wisdom of Egyp t in the British Isles ages before the Bible was heard of in Europe . The ark of Nnu, Noë, or Noah was the ark of the celestial waters. An ark with the Ali, or Ari, was an ark with the seven on boa rd who were rulers in the heptanom is. This is extant as the ark of the seven Kabiri and the seven Hohga tes, the seven who in Britain were the com panions of Arthur in the ark. When we unde rstand that the Hebrew ark of Noah (or xn ) was the ark of Nnu in Egyp t, and is the ark of heaven by name in the astronom y, we are on the track for the first time to learn how certain later races of manki nd coul d be said to issue from the ark of Noah after a particular form of the deluge in which the heaven in ten divisi ons was supe rseded by the heaven in twelve divisions , the birthpl ace as an ark being a geom etrical figure of the cont empor ary heaven. The deluge legend in the book of Genesis can be directly traced to its Egypt ian origin. Nnu was the master of the celestia l water. Unde r the same name, and also as Num , lord of the inunda tion, he was master of the water in the Nile on earth. The deluge , all the deluge s, and the whol e of the arkite imagery, toge ther with Noah himself in very person, are depende nt on the beginn ing of creation with the water of the Nun or Nnu, and on heaven being the celestial Nnu by name in the Egypt ian langua ge. In the Ador ation of the Nile it is Nnu the deity of the heavenly water that is invoke d as mythical sour ce of life and not simply the f low ing river. The obj ect of religious regard as element or place or person was the celestial Nnu or Nun, who when personi fied was the giver of the Nile and all its gifts. Nun or Nnu was the inunda tor of"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Egypt by means of the Nile. Moreove r, the god Num who is lord of the earthly inunda tion was preceded by the ancient deity Nun (or Nnu) , who had an ark or shrine, but was not worshippe d in any temple hitherto discove red. It appe ars from inscriptions of Tahtmes III at Thebes that Nnu the deity of the deluge an d the ark had been cont inue d in the character of Num as the lord of the inunda tion of the Nile, with his ark or teba represented by the city of Thebes, that “heaven on earth,” as it was designa ted by the Queen Hatshepsu. From these inscriptions we learn th at Tahtmes rebuilt the sanctuary of Nnu, or rather that he bui lt the temple of Amen - Ra at Thebes on the site of the ancient shrine. This, we are told, had a circuit wall of brick, and a canal which conduc ted the water of the inunda tion “to the shrine of th e god Nun (Nnu) on the arrival of his season, ” which show s that Nnu was one with Num as the elder pre - solar god, and that Nun (Nnu) passed into the god Num as a solar god associated with the inunda tion. The temple bui lt by Tahtmes was a shrine of Nnu and A men, as in “No - Amen,” the name of Thebes. In laying the founda tion stone of the new temple Tahtmes records the fact that he had to remove the older shrine of the god Nun (or Nnu), and divert the cour se of the water that flow ed to the shrine of the god Nnu, because 565 it was in the way (inscription cited by Brugs ch, Egypt unde r the Phar aohs , p. 178 , Eng. tr.). Brugs ch calls this shrine of Nnu the temple of the god; other Egypt ologi sts tell us that no temple was ever raised to Nnu or Num . But whether terme d a temple or not , this ancient sanctuary was an ark - shrine and a type of protection from the waters. The ark of Num is called his lordly bark. It is said that with the inunda tion “he brings onc e more his lordly bark” (verse 5). Also, “Thou art the augus t ornament of the earth, letting thy bark adva nce before men and lifting up the heart of women in labour ”; “All is change d by the inunda tion; it is a balm of healing for manki nd” (verses 9 and 11) . Thus Nnu as deity of the heavenly water was represented by t he Nile as river and by Num as divinity when the sun - god was uni ted with the water - god in Num or in Amen - Ra at Thebes. But the main poi nt here is the ark of Nnu that com es again with the inunda tion onc e a year to Egypt . And if no temple of Nnu is know n, he was expr essly associated with a shrine which originated in an ark that was a means of safety to the ancient lake - dw ellers of Africa. In the Papyr us of Nefer - ube n - f (Budge ) the god of the inunda tion is described as “the old man Nnu. ” The deceased is standi ng in the water and hol ding the sail of breath in his left hand. He prays that he may have pow er ove r the seven divine princes who dw ell in the place of the god of the inunda tion — that is, of Nnu the lord of the celestial water as bui lder of the ark. He say s, “I have pow er with my father, the old man Nnu. He hath granted that I may live.” This is the father Nnu as Egypt ian who became father Noah in the Hebrew version. Noah was a just or right eous man, and perfect in his generations . This statement is put in the forefront of the Hebrew deluge legend. In the Ritual it is granted to the Osiris Nnu that he shall “carry maat at the head of the great bark and hold up maat among the associate gods .” Maat stand s for justice and right fulness; and this is bor ne aloft upon the bark by the spirit of the just man made perfect, right up to the sum mit of the mount which is the landi ng - place for thos e who are in the ark. “And so it com eth that the Osiris - Nnu hath reached every one of his stations ” in the ark that rests at la st upon Mount Hetep,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Mount Nizir, Mount Meru, or the Mount of Ararat. Nnu is identified with Noah by the Arab writer Murtadi (1584) , who related that Num - Kufu, the bui lder of the Great Pyramid, dreamed of a com ing deluge , and bui lt the Pyramid as his ark o f safety. He then “made his abode in the maritime pyramid along with Noah” ( Nat. Gen., vol . II, p. 226) . That is along with Nnu, the god of the ark and the inunda tion, who was earlier than Num , and who had his teba in Thebes. This poi nts to the pyr amid of Num - Kufu being also a form of the ark, or rather to the ark of earth and heaven in several of its successive forms that were ultimately com bined in one cons um mate figur e of the heavens and earth as a stupe ndous monum ent and imperishable register of the ast ronom ical mythology. And, if so, it becom es appa rent that the sarcopha gus at the centre was a co - type with the coffin, shrine or ark of Osiris in the midst of Amenta. This may help to show how fragm ents of the astronom ical mythol ogy have been 566 put tog ether in the book of Genesis without key or clue, and the old dark sayings of the ancient wisdom repeated minus the necessary know ledge for enlight ening the world. Earlier deluge s than this of Noah are allude d to in one of the Jewish Hagga dot h, which rela tes that in the time of Enos , as in that of Cain, a great tract of land was floode d by the sea. Which is but the end of a patriarchate described in terms of the deluge . ( Encyclopæ dia Biblica, col. 1297 .) Items from several deluge s are include d in the Hebre w versions . For instance, the animals are said to enter the ark seven by seven, and also two by two. Here the num bers belong to two entirely different deluge s, the one from which the seven (or eight ), the other from which the pair, were saved. There is no such incongr uous mixture in the Avesta. In this version Yima the shining is com mande d by Zarathus tra to “make a circle to all four corners as a dw elling - place for all manki nd, ” and stock and store it against the deluge , which is the evil work of the destru ctive serpent of darkne ss. All forms of life that enter this enclosure do so in imperishable pairs. A lofty wall is to be made around it, and a window that gives light within. The one window we take to be the pol e - star. The lofty wall answers to the high w hite hall of Ha - Ptah - Ka. It is light ed with self - created and eternal light s that shine above , and the created light s below (Farg. II, l. 131) . These correspond to the Kamite Urtu - Seku, the setting stars, and the Akhe mu - Seku, or stars that never set, the ev erlasting self - created light s. The window of Yima’s enclosure in heaven is repeated in a Jewish legend that after the deluge two animals came out of the ark which were not among the twos or sevens that went into it. These two were the cat and the pig. And they belonge d to the new creation of Atum - Ra. The cat, as solar type , is a sym bol of Atum - Iu. It is said in the Ritual (ch. 17) the cat is Ra himself. It was in that form of the seer by night that the sun - god ove rcame the evil Apap in the darkne ss of Ament a. The pig or boa r in the Osirian mythos is a type of the evil Sut, the oppone nt of the Good Being in Amenta. Amenta is the low er deck of an ark in which the pig of Sut was present. This is in an ark that could not be bui lt until Amenta had been hol low ed o ut by Ptah, the father of Atum - Ra, who was represented by the cat. Thus the addi tion of the cat and pig to the previous denizens will help to identify which ark it was they came out of after the deluge of Noah. As Egyptian, it was the ark in which Ra had r esolved to be lifted up as “god alone ,” and the cat and pig were type s belongi ng to the new creation that follow ed the “destruction of manki nd. ” This was the ark of Nnu. The"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"description of Noah’s deluge is an aggl om erate compounde d from the mythical data a nd the actual inunda tion. The waters flow ed in Egypt dur ing a certain num ber of days. It is proba ble that the fullest flow was reckone d at forty days and night s (see Hor - Apol lo). In a fragm ent of the Melchizedekian literature, found by Professor Sokol ov, a nd appe nde d to the Slavoni c book of Enoc h, the ark of Noah “floated forty days.” And it is adde d, altoge ther they were in the ark 120 day s. This is the exact lengt h of the water season in the Egypt ian year of 360 days, which was first divided into three 5 67 tetramenes of 120 days each. It may also be not ed that out side of Egypt rain took the place of the inunda tion, and the deluge of Noah cons ists of forty days and night s of rain. Fifteen cubi ts of fresh water cons tituted a good if not a perfect Nile, and this is the measure appl ied to the flood of rain - water in the book of Genesis. Fifteen cubi ts upw ard did the waters prevail, and the mount ains were cove red (ch. VII, 20). Fifteen cubi ts of water, how ever, coul d be no measure for a flood that cove red all “ the high mount ains that were unde r the whol e heaven” (ch. VII, 19). The waters that prevailed on the earth for 150 days are also equa l to an abunda nt inunda tion of the Nile, but these have been mixed up with the waters of the celestial Nun. Also the fiftee n cubi ts of measure on the earth woul d be conf used with the fifteen cubi ts, measures, or days in the half - circle of the luni - solar mont h of thirty days, in which the luna r crescent was the ark that is entered by Osiris, on the third day, to spread the actu al water of life and light , not that deluge of destruction which was entirely mythical. After the deluge , according to the euhe merizing of the mythos in the book of Genesis, Noah began to be a hus bandm an, and planted a vineyard; and he drank of the wine a nd was drunke n; and he was unc ove red within his tent, and Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedne ss of his father, and told his two brethren without . And Shem and Japhe th took a garment and cove red the nakedne ss of their father (ch. IX, 20, 24). “And th eir faces were backw ard, and they saw not the nakedne ss of their father.” Now in the mysteries of Amenta Osiris is cove red by his son Horus to conc eal his nakedne ss. “I am with Horus,” says Taht, “on the day of cove ring Tesh - Tesh,” one of the names of Osir is (Rit., ch. 1). It is also said to Horus, “O thou who cove rest (or clothest) Osiris and hast seen Sut, O thou who turnest back” (ch. 28) . Here the adve rsary of Osiris is present with Horus in this scene of conc ealing the father’s nakedne ss, and the bad c haracter of the black, evil - minde d Sut appe ars to have been given to Ham as a son of Noah. In the Chaldean account of the deluge a sacrifice is offered at the com ing forth from the ark. Hasisadra says, “I pour ed out a libation. I bui lt an altar on the peak of a mount ain. Seven jugs of wine I took . At the bot tom of them I placed reeds, pines, and spices. The gods collected at its bur ning, the gods like Sumbe gathered ove r the sacrifice.” (Deluge , Tab., col. 3, Smith.) The basis of the oblation in the Kamite sacrifice is the blood of the beings that have been destroye d. “Said by the majesty of the god, Let them begin with Elepha ntine, and bring to me the fruits in qua ntity. And when the fruits had been brought they were given . . lacuna .” The sekti (miller) of Annu was grindi ng the fruits, while the priestesses pour ed the juice into the vases; and those fruits were put into vessels with the blood of the beings , and there were seven thous and pitchers of drink. “And there came the majesty of the king of Uppe r and Low er Egypt , with the gods , to see the drink after he"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"had ordered the godde ss to destroy the beings in three days of navigation.” Instead of the Assyrian seven jugs of wine the Egypt ian has 7,000 pitchers of drink, and this is brewed from the blood of the massacred beings mingl ed with the juice of the fruits of the earth; and here, as in the later version, the gods gather over the 568 sacrifice “to see the drink.” Sheddi ng the blood of the wicked, in this great slaught er of the evil beings , was a mode of offering the obl ation to the Good Being. Blood and the fruits of the earth were the two primitive forms of the offering, and these are blende d toge ther in a deluge of intoxi cating drink. A most primitive representation of this sacrifice which follow ed th e deluge is made by the Ovaherero, an African tribe adjoining that of the Bushm en. They claim to have issued from the typical tree of the beginni ng, which is said by the missiona ry Reiderbecke to be a kind of Yggd rasil. The Ovaherero say that the sky was o nce let dow n in a deluge , by which the greater part of manki nd were drow ned. This they attribut e to the Old Ones in heaven, whos e wrath was appe ased by the sacrifice of a black sheep ( Sout h African Folk - Lore Jour nal , vol . II, pt. 5, p. 95) . When the deluge of darkne ss had passed away at dawn, the black sheep was offered to placate and pacify the pow er of darkne ss, which exhi bits the deluge and the deluge - legend in their most primitive forms. The sacrifice doe s not merely celebrate the return of light, as in a later pha se, but is also a petitiona ry offering for future protection from the deluge of the dark. Before ever man appe ared on earth, a feeling of joy and thankf ulness had been expr essed by the apes at the return of the light , whether luna r or solar; an d when man came he follow ed on the track of the monke y in feeling thankf ul for the return of day. In the Egypt ian hieroglyphi cs the word tua, to ador e, is figur ed as a salutation to the dawn or morrow - day, and the typi cal ador er is the Kaf - ape, the saluter of the gods . Primitive worship signi fied salutation and sacrifice from the beginni ng. In various traditions , Babyl oni an, American, Hebrew, and others, the deluge is follow ed by a sacrifice, and this sacrifice after the flood has been conf igur ated in the s tars of heaven in a picture of the far - off past, with the offering laid upon the altar at a poi nt where the actual inundat ion in Egyptian annual ly cam e to an end. In the Hebrew account of the thanks giving sacrifice it is said, “Noah bui lt an altar unt o Jeh ova h, and took of every clean beast and of every clean bird, and offered bur nt - offerings upon the altar, and Ihuh smelled the sweet savour .” The typi cal imagery derived from the actual seasons in Egypt , repeated in the planisphe re, will also account for th e Hebrew story conc erning Noah’s planting the vine and getting drunk immediately after the inunda tion. The vine that Noah is said to have planted may be seen in the decans of Virgo, where the star Vinde miatrix denot es the time of vintage in Egypt . It is a version of the mythos in which the water of the deluge was turned into wine by Horus, the ripening soul of the sun, that has been most pitifully vul garised in the story of Noah’s intoxi cation after the deluge . According to the planisphe re Noah was on the w ater of the inunda tion, or he might have just lande d when the grapes were ripe, and he got intoxi cated appa rently for the pur pos e of cursing Ham and cons igni ng the dark race to the doom of never - endi ng slavery. Hebraists tell us that the name of Noah signi fies rest, which leads to not hing in Hebrew. Whereas, in Egypt ian, the same word Nnu is a name of the inunda tion, the deity"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"of the celestial waters, and also for rest or repos e. As natural fact this was the season of rest or of Nnu because of the deluge , d uring which the 569 god was resting in his ark upon the waters, or, as might be, in his Teba of the Southern Apta at Thebes. The natural fact was formulated in a legend such as that of Nnu, Num , Noah, or Vishnu resting on the waters dur ing a deluge in th e course of a new creation; that is, during the Hindu period of Pralaya, when this was figur ed on the grand scale as described in the Puranas. For instance, Vishnu is said to repos e in slum ber dur ing four mont hs of every year, bor ne up by the seven - headed Naga - serpent Sesha (Kenne dy, Hindu Mythol ogy , p. 228; Moor ’s Hindu Pant heon ). The four months of the inunda tion is historical in Egypt ; the deluge in mythol ogy is typi cal, and the type was various ly appl ied to a natural phe nom enon as a mode of measuring ti me. Nnu or Nu had becom e an Egypt ian persona l name. There is a papyr us of Nu in the British Museum cont aining various chapters of the Ritual. In these the speaker calls himself the Osiris - Nu, and, as the subj ect - matter show s, the manes here com bines the tw o characters of Osiris and Nnu. Moreove r, he is Nnu in the ark or bark, as lord of the inunda tion and victor ove r the deluge (Rit., ch. 36 A ). The Osiris - Nnu is the speaker; not merely Nnu of the papyr us, but Nnu of the celestial water, or Nnu as THE Osiris . He says the Osiris - Nnu is strong to direct the ship of the gods , here called the boa t of the sun, in which he com es forth from Amenta into heaven. Nnu saileth round about the heaven and “voya ges along with Ra.” Thus the mythos merges into the eschatology of the Ritual. The water of the deluge in the Assyrian legend was not terrestrial. It is said in the ope ning lines: Then arose the water of dawn at daylight; It arose like a black cloud from the horizon of heaven. It was a deluge feared by the go ds themselves because the waters were celestial. Hence they sought refuge in the highe st heaven. “They ascende d to the heaven of Anu, ” the enclosure at the Pole. This was the heaven of the stars that never set; the heaven, the enclosure or ark of refuge , w hich is said to have rested on the mount when the flood subs ided. It was Bel, the wise one , the couns ellor of the gods , who caused the deluge , and he is a pol e - star god , equi valent to Sut or Anup the judge , whos e seat was above the sum mit at the north cele stial pol e. The deluge here was evidently the result of a change in the pol e - stars; hence the tree re - planted in a circle by the gods . If Bel made the deluge when he represented the pol e - star a change in the pole - star woul d be as the letting in of waters, otherwise called the flood. The ark was bui lt against this cont emplated change . The Greek tradition include d two legends of the great deluge or cataclysm by which the race was destroye d. One of these was the flood from which Ogyge s escaped with a few com pa nions in a vessel. The other is know n as the deluge of Deucalion, from which he escaped with Pyrrha his wife. Ogyge s with his few com panions are equi valent to Horus with the seven great spirits who were saved from the deluge in the ark of Orion. Deucalion and Pyrrha are equi valent to Atum and his cons ort Hathor - Iusâas. Among the Californian Indi ans they tell of a great flood ( i.e., heaven all water) from which onl y a"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"coyot e survived and a feather that was seen floating on the vast expa nse of water. As the c oyot e looke d at it the feather became an eagle which 570 joined the coyot e on the “Reed - Peak,” and these two were the creators of men (Bancroft, vol . III, pp. 87, 88). The reed - peak also answers to the Kamite field of reeds upon the sum mit of Mount Hetep and the Japanese “mid - land of the reed - expa nse.” The papyr us - reed or lotus - flow er is a cradle or ark in which the Child - Horus was upl ifted from the water of the Nun and saved from drow ning. This becom es the mythical reed in various legends , which is a co - type with the tree as a means of emergence from the flood . The Navajo Indi ans have pious ly preserved an account of the ascent from the waters of the deluge , not by means of the tree or tow er, but by building a huge mound of earth to make a tall mount ain in the nor th. Their tradition is that the men of a world before our ow n, on being warned of an appr oaching flood, resolved to bui ld a place of refuge . “They took soil from the four corner - mount ains (qua rters) of the world, and placed it on the top of the mou ntain that stood in the nor th; and thither they all went, includi ng the peopl e of the mount ains, the salt - wom an and such animals as then lived in the third world. When the soil was laid on the mount ain the latter grew highe r and highe r, but the waters bega n to rise and the peopl e climbed upw ards to escape from the flood . At lengt h the mount ain ceased to grow , and they planted on the sum mit a great Reed, into the hol low of which they all entered. . . . At the end of the four th night from the time it was plan ted the reed had grow n up to the floor of the four th world, and here they found a hol e through which they passed to the surface” and were saved. The great reed evidently imaged the celestial pol e. It grew by night and did not grow in the daytime. The turke y was the last to enter the reed, and the deluge rose and rose unt il the water wetted the tip of his tail (W. Matthews, American Antiquar ian, 1883 , p. 208 ). The tree had been an actual refuge for the hum an race. Hence it became a typi cal refuge that was fi gur ed in the astronom y and eschatology. Salvation from the deluge by means of bot h the reed and the tree is a mode of escape from the waters in the Ritual. The deceased is one who know s the deep waters. But he is not to be drow ned. He exclaims, “I embrace the sycamore - tree. I am uni ted to the sycamore” (Rit., ch. LXIV). The sycamore is the tree of dawn, and the speaker escapes from the waters just as the young sun - god escaped from the deluge of darkne ss by climbing the tree or mount ing his papyr us - plant; th e one as solar in the mythol ogy, the other as a soul in the eschatology. This mode of ascent goe s back to the time when there was neither a bridge of heaven nor a boa t upon the waters of earth, nor a tow er that was bui lt to reach to heaven. In the Norse my thos the ash - tree is called “the Refuge of Thor,” because it caught and saved the young god when he was being swept away by the ove rflow ing waters of the river Vimur. This is the same typi cal tree as in the Ritual, where it is the mainstay of the Osiris, w ho is well - nigh drow ned by the deluge of the inunda tion, but who escapes by laying hol d of the tree. We need to know in what sense the reed or tree in heaven was a type of safety during the deluge before we can interpret the Arawak version, in which it is said the waters had been conf ined to the hol low bol e of an enor mous tree by means of an inve rted basket. The mischievous monke y saw this basket, and thinki ng it cove red som ething good "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"571 to eat he lifted it up, whereupon the deluge bur st forth from the tree. The monke y is charged with being the culprit in several of the legends and märchen that we show to be survivals of the Kamite mythos , in which Hapi was the ape that brought the deluge of the inundat ion, and was also in com mand of the celestial water in the mythol ogy (Rit., ch. 57) . In a Red - Indi an story of the deluge , Manaboz ho escaped from drow ning by climbing to the top of the tallest pine - tree on the highe st mount ain in the world and waiting till the flood subs ided. It is related in a Taoist legend that “one extraordinary antediluvi an saved his life by climbing up a mount ain, and there and then, in the manne r of birds plaiting a nest, he passed his days on the trees, while all the count ry below him was one vast expa nse of water. He afterwards lived to a very old age, and coul d testify to his late pos terity that a whol e race of hum an beings had then been swept away from the face of the earth” ( The Chinese Repos itory, v. 8, p. 517) . In this legend we have bot h the tree and the mount ain used as means of escape in the same ascent. They were distinct as Egypt ian type s, but afterwards were som etimes fused in one , as the tree or reed upon the sum mit of the mount . The Indi an tribes of Guiana say that when the great waters were about to be sent forth the chief Marérewána was informed of the com ing flood , and he saved himself and his family in a large canoe . In order that he might not drift ove r the ocean far from the ancestral hom e he prepared a long cable of “bus h - rope ” and made his vessel fast to the trunk of an enor mous tree, so that when the waters subs ided he found himself at no great distance from his former abode . His canoe had been tied up to the pol e, here represented by a tree. The reed - type also takes the form of the canoe as well as the tree. It is r elated in a Mexican tradition that the coyot e, a co - type with the jackal and the dog, got wind of the com ing deluge . To save himself from drow ning he gna wed dow n a large cane that was grow ing on the bank of a river. This he entered, and then stoppe d up the end of it with a kind of gum to keep the waters out . Thus , at the time of the Chaldean deluge it is said that the great god Nera “tore up the Stake” — that is, the pol e or moor ing - pos t which is here represented by a stake, and a change of pol e - star by the u proot ing of the stake. Nera is a form of Nergal, the great Nera. The legends of the deluge show that the primal paradise was an enclosure on the sum mit of the highe st mount ain, that of the pol e, as a place of safety midst the celestial waters, which was t ypi cal of the refuge sought for on the hill - top when the floods were out on earth. The enclosure might be an ark, or palisade of wicker - work, a nest of reeds, or a city, walled and fortified, an island, a group of seven islands , or ten, or a zodi ac, the id ea of the deluge was ever present. And this had been the dom inant idea in the bur ial of old Egypt ’s dead amidst the waters of the inunda tion. Every figur e of the ark and every mode of arking or enclosing are extant som ewhere or other in the astronom ical my thol ogy. Take the cave for example. In the Mexican version the seven who are saved from the deluge found safety in the seven caves of the celestial mount , the mount which toppl ed ove r at the sum mit with the changi ng of the pol e. The cave was one of the nat ural type s of the ark that preceded any form of refuge made 572 "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"by the hand of man. And there were seven of these altoge ther as a figur e of the celestial heptanom is. The Welsh Bardda s ascribe the bui lding of an ark to Menw yd, who is called the dragon - chi ef of the world in the ancient British mythol ogy. Menw yd is described as forming the ark by means of serpents joined toge ther ( Nat. Gen., vol . II, p. 253) . An ark is the means of safety amidst the waters whatsoever its formation may have been. Such an ark may be seen in the Sesha Nag - serpent with seven heads that bears up Vishnu dur ing the deluge . This is a figur e of the fore - world which preceded a great flood . Here the seven - headed serpent is likewise a figur e of the heptanom is, or heaven in seven division s, which sank in the celestial waters. The same great serpent in the waters with seven heads is also Akka dian. A principle of arking, so to call it, was established when the great Bear, as the mother of the revol utions or time - cycles, and mistress of the waters, made the circle of the year in turning round “the Atlantean Pole.” She, as the pregna nt water - cow , was herself an ark of life that might be looke d to as a divine type of safety by the sufferers from the water - floods on earth. The mother of time and station was the mistress of the firmamental waters; the mistress therefore of the enclosure in the waters which in the later rende ring is a park, a garden, a paradise, or a harvest - field. In the Uganda legend it was a palisade of reeds around a spring of fresh water, the secret of which the wom en kne w, but failed to keep. When the circle of the bear was found to be unt rue, and time was more correctly measured by the moon - god Taht, she, the mother of time and the mistress of the waters, was accused of being unf aithful to her trust, of letting in the deluge and losing the primeval hom e. As we have seen, she phi lande red with the moon - god Taht, who supe rseded Sut in her affections and in keeping time. The twins as Sut and Horus were re - born of her as luna r in t he dark and light halves of the moon — the light eye of Horus and the dark eye of Sut. Apt had been the mistress of the waters in the stellar mythos from the first, and when it was found out that she was keeping time unf aithfully and incorrectly she was char ged with betraying the secret to her love r, with ove rthrow ing the bul wark and with letting in the deluge . This suppl ied the matter of sundr y deluge - legends . The Egypt ians always kept on bui lding closely in accordance with som e primal type like this of the ark. In the beginni ng the earth itself was a mount or table - land that rose up out of the abys s as a kind of ark amidst the waters of space, an ark of one story. But when Amenta had been hol low ed out by Ptah the ope ner of an unde rworld, there was an ark of two stories, fixed or floating. Whether called an ark or a hous e, it was two - storied. It was doubl e - decked like a ship. It was also a hous e of two stories for Osiris in Abydos . With heaven adde d ove r all it becom es three - storied or triple - decked, with Ame nta, earth and heaven answering to the three stories of the triple - deck. Now , it is com mande d that the ark of Noah, or Nnu, shall be bui lt “with low er, second and third stories,” like the ship with three decks. This is a fragm ent of the genui ne mythos whic h tends to show that it was the ark here identified as the figur e of three worlds, viz., Amenta, middl e - earth and heaven; a figur e that agrees 573 with the typi cal tree of the Akka do - Assyrian and the Norse mythol ogy which had its root s in the nether - worl d, its stem in middl e - earth and its branches high in heaven. But"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"did the Egypt ians ever launc h this three - decker, and get it afloat in space? or did it remain a fixture in the mythical abys s? It was argue d in the Natural Genesis that the Kamite astronom er s had measured the earth and kne w it to be a globe rotating in space. It is now sugge sted that the ark of three stories was a com pound image of the three regions bui lt up deck by deck and com pleted by the arch - craftsman Ptah in a vessel that is called the ship of heaven in the Ritual. In the words of M. Lieblin, the Egypt ians “kne w that the earth circulated in the great ocean of heaven.” And as the earth was the sekru - bark of Osiris in Amenta, it was the ark afloat upon the waters of the Nnu ( Nat. Gen., vol . II, pp. 60 - 61) . In the time of Neb - Ka - Ra of the four th dyna sty the fact must have been a familiar one for a com mon peasant to call the king “the helm, or pilot of the earth which he navigates in space as the second brother of Taht,” who was the navigator of the luna r bark. The ark of Nnu, which Ra com mande d to be bui lt for him when he was about to be lifted up upon the heavenly water, may be seen on the sarcopha gus of Seti, in the Soane Museum . “The boa t,” says Lefébur e, the translator of the text, “is su ppor ted by Nnu, whos e bus t and arms onl y are to be seen. The arms issue from the water and bear up the god . The entire scenes are surrounde d by the waves of Nnu, which show s that the Egyp tians looke d upon the earth as a sphe rical body floating through the air. The boat is directed, as a passage made through the waves indi cates, tow ards a spot where a disk is represented on a band. This band, studde d with points, represents the earth as a landi ng - place for which the ark is bound” ( Book of Hade s, Records of t he Past, vol . XII, p. 16) . There is also a description of the ship of Nnu in the chapter of the Ritual by which one saileth a ship in the nether - world. In this the nature of the three decks as “low er, second and third stories” is described. The vessel is d escribed in chapter 99 as the ship in which the abys s or voi d of Apap the devour er may be safely crossed. This is an empty space into which the starry one s fall dow n headlong to find not hing by which they can raise themselves up again. The manes suppl icate s the god: “Oh thou who sailest the ship of Nnu ove r the voi d, let me sail the ship. Let me be brought in as a distressed mariner, and go to the place which thou know est.” As previous ly show n, he has to know each part of the bark by name and to repeat the name of each before he is adm itted on boa rd. From this examination in the judgm ent - hall we learn the nature of the Ark and its three stories. The name of the low est story is “akar,” that is, the low er earth. The pos ts at stem and stern are “the two colum ns of the nether - world.” The ribs, also called the four paddl es, image the gods of the four corners, Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef and Kabhs enuf . These are the four who row the bark, and it is said that Seb, the earth, abideth stably by means of their rudde rs or oar s. The “patrol who goe th round” is “he who piloteth the doubl e earth.” The “moor ing - pos t,” which represents the pol e, is designa ted “the lord of the doubl e earth in the shrine,” that is, Osiris as the pow er of the pol e. The doubl e earth is the earth of Ame nta and the earth of Seb, or two 574 of the three stories, the third of which is celestial. Hence Nut, or Heaven, is the name of the sail. Thus the three stories are identified with Amenta, earth and heaven, that were figur ed in the ark of Nnu which floa ted (earth and all) upon the waters of the firmament. This, when represented by the cons tellation Argo Navis, was an obj ect - picture of the ark"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"upon the great stream of the Via Lactea, by means of which the manes reached “the tip of heaven” at the pol e, and after all the row ing and the voya ging attained the realm of rest upon the eternal shor e. The Jewish Kabalists have a tradition that Noah’s ark embodi ed an image of the world or was a figure of the whol e uni verse. This IS the ark of Nnu in the astronom ical mythol ogy, the ark of Nnu that is described in the Egypt ian Ritual as a subj ect of examination in the Mysteries of Amenta. According to the Bhâgavata Purana (1, 3, 15) , the ship of Manu was the earth itself. The “ship of the world” is a title given by th e Bardda s to the enclosure of Stone henge , which poi nts to its includi ng an image of the earth as a form of the ark amidst the waters of heaven, like that of Seb which abideth stably in space by means of the four oars or paddl es at the four cardinal poi nts. An ark of the four qua rters is described in the magic papyrus. It is said, “There are four mansions of life at Abydos ,” the mythical birthpl ace of Osiris in Amenta. In this we find anot her group of the four gods Nnu and Shu, Taht and Seb. The eternal city on the sum mit of the Mount of Glory was the final form of the ark in heaven. And after the Babyl oni an deluge when the ship touc hes the shor e and its occupa nts have lande d, as it is said, Gilgames “collected great stone s,” “he piled up the great stone s.” I nstead of piling the mound of earth, or planting the typi cal tree, or launc hing the ark, the survivors now are the bui lders of a city with stone s. They lande d and “left the ship by the shor e. They jour neyed a stage of twenty kaspu. They made the stage asce nt of thirty kaspu. They came to the midst of Erech Subur i.” Then follow s the bui lding of Erech, the ark - city on the sum mit; or the new heaven that was divided into three parts; “one measure for the circuit of the city, one measure for the bounda ry of the temple of Nantur, the hous e of Ishtar; three measures toge ther (for) the divisions of Erech” ( Records, v. 7, 148 — 9). In Africa a coni cal hut like an ant - heap is the primeval type of a dw elling made by hum an hands . This was cont inue d by the Egyp tians in the cone of Hathor and the conical pyr amid, or Ben - Ben of Sut - Anup as a figur e of Polaris or Sothis surmount ed by its star. This may be seen in the lake - dw ellings of Africa, which are coni cal hut s bui lt on piles in the water of the divine land of Puanta as po rtrayed in the inscriptions of Hatshepsu’s temple at Deir - el - Bahari. The reason given for such a type of hous e, says Sir John Kirk, is that the count ry at times is floode d (Lockye r’s Daw n of Astronom y, p. 348 , note 3), and thus the inha bitants escape the i nunda tion. The coni cal hut is com mon in Africa bot h on land and water, and this is a figur e of the primitive paradise and of the celestial pol e, which was cont inue d in Egyp t as the round pyramidion, a co - type with the circular mound and coni cal cairn. Thus an ark on the firmamental water in the shape of a cone , a figur e that represents the pol e, crow ned with its star, is identical with the pile - dw elling of the 575 African lakes, and images the same mode of escape from the waters, according to the mythos a nd eschatology of the Egypt ians, as doe s the primitive lake - dw elling of the Inne r Africans. The earliest ark of Nnu, or heaven, is an enclosure in the water of the Nun; the latest is a paradise on piles; we might say seven piles or pol es which are co - type s with the seven mount ains or seven pyr amids. But an ark, as a means of refuge in relation to a deluge of water, is not limited to the boa t - type . The ark of Noë on the Apamean coin is figur ed as a box four - squa re. This, in Egypt ian, is a Teba, Hebrew Thebah , the name of"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Noah’s ark, and of Thebes as a form of the eternal city. There was an ark of the sphe re which is described in the Thlinke et legend as a vast floating bui lding. At the time of the deluge it struck on the mount , or was driven on the rock and br oke n in two halves by its ow n weight . This agrees with the division of the heaven into nor th and sout h between Sut and Horus, as their two divine dom ains. In several of the legends it is made know n beforehand and announc ed that a deluge is com ing, and wit h the warning instructions are given to bui ld an ark or prepare som e sort of refuge and means of escape for a favoured few. According to the Marque san version, the lord ocean, or Fatu - Noana, who is like Nnu, lord of the celestial water, when about to send the devastating deluge , allow s seven days for preparation. A tall building is to be erected which will tow er above the reach of the waters. Cattle of all kinds are collected in pairs and marched into a vessel called the “Long Deep Wood .” In this there is a family of four males and four females saved; the same as in the ark of Noah, and of Nnu. The storm burst. The “sacred suppor ter” of the uni verse slum bered dur ing the night of dissolution, as doe s Vishnu or Brahm a in the Hindu version. A coffin on a sledge was a pre - Osirian type of the ark which was periodi cally drawn round the walls of the great sanctuary of Ptah the coffined one in the Mysteries of Memphi s. The sledge or raft was naturally earlier than the boa t, and the passage through Amenta, when this w as imaged as solid earth, was represented by the sun - god Sekari in his coffin resting on a sledge . In the Ritual (ch. 100 ) the Osiris says, “I clear the path of the solar orb and tow along Sekari (a form of Ptah) upon his sledge .” The Norsemen were accusto med to bur y the bodi es of their dead chiefs in boa ts on the hills, as a typi cal mode of crossing the celestial waters after death. The Garrow s of Benga l, who cremated their dead, used to place the corpse in a dingy or small boa t on the top of the fune ral p ile, for the typi cal crossing of the waters. The word ark in Egypt ian signi fies a circle, to encircle, bands , enclosings , encirclings , also num ber thirty, thence a mont h. Arkai is to appoi nt a limit, fix an end by decree. This was appl ied in measuring a cy cle of time, which might be mont hly, as in the Assyrian Arkhu. From this com es the arc, as part of a circle, which in Egypt ian is to encircle or to make the circle. And thus the enclosure and ark are bot h forms of the circle. The enclosure made by Yima was an ark - circle but not an ark, or bark upon the waters. Still, the meaning is the same. It was the type of an enclosure and of safety from the deluge whether figur ed as stationa ry or afloat; 576 and the heaven bui lt upon four corners as a circular enclos ure was an ark in space, we might say, the ark of space, when space was the celestial water. An ark of seven cubi ts was a figur e of the celestial heptanom is, or heaven in seven divisions . An ark of eight cubi ts was a figur e of heaven in eight divisions , ei ther as Am - Khemen or the octona ry of Taht. An ark of four cubi ts was a figur e of heaven as the teba, or box of the four qua rters. There was an ark of twenty - eight nights to the luna r mont h. This was the ark of the moon in which Osiris was rebor n, or the ch ild - Horus was preserved from the waters. The cubi t was a measure in time for a day, as well as in space for a degree. Three hundr ed and sixty five cubi ts in circum ference was the measure of a year of 365 days, on the tom b of Osym andya s (Diod. I, 49) . Simil arly, four teen cubi ts were equi valent to four teen days, or a half - moon , a tenat in the luna r mont h of twenty - eight days, and therefore equa l to"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"four teen degrees. Thus the ark of the moon is not limited to the orb itself as a vessel that cont ained the new - b orn child of light . It is also the circle of a luna r zodi ac, in which there were twenty - eight measures in time and space, = twenty - eight cubi ts that were divided into two four teens, and four sevens. During four teen days Osiris (or Horus) grew in glory, and dur ing the other half of the luna tion he was torn in four teen pieces by Sut, the pow er of darkne ss. An ark of twice four teen cubi ts is equa l to a circle with twenty - eight stations , that is a luna r enclosure or zodi ac. No dimensions of the ark are directly given in the Ritual, but there is an allusion which proba bly unde rlies the measurement of the luna r mont h or zodi acal circle of twenty - eight measures. One - half of the circle was marked out in four teen divisions correspondi ng to one - half of the luna r hous e s. Also, the divine dom ain of Aarru was divided into four teen sections (Rit., ch. 149) , or, to put it in anot her way the mount of earth had fourteen steps to it: seven up and seven dow n. This woul d be the measure of one - half the circle, which was made out in twenty - eight luna r signs : four teen in the low er and fourteen in the uppe r hemisphe re. Suns et and sunr ise were half - way round the circle, hor izont ally and perpendi cularly, at the level called the sum mit of the mount . Now there is a scene at suns et descri bed in the Ritual (ch. 108) . Ra and the reptile of darkne ss watch each other, Ra from his ark, the mons ter from the mount . The depth of water unde rneath the solar bark at this, the level of suns et, is said to be seven cubi ts in its liqui d part. This also s erves to measure the low er half of the circle by seven cubi ts, or measures, dow nw ard and seven upw ard to the level of the mount , or the hor izon. Seven steps dow n, appl ied either to the mount or to the low er half of the circle, woul d be identical with the c our se of the luna r god dess Ishtar, when she made her descent into the Assyrian Hades and was despoi led of all her ornaments and raiment as she passed through the seven gates dow nw ard, to be reclothed again in all her glory as she made the ascent through th e seven upw ard gates. The obj ect sought to be established here is the luna r circle divided into twenty - eight lengt hs of time, whether measured vertically by the mount of the earth or by the pathway of the moon. The seven measures answer to one - four th 577 of the entire circle of twenty - eight cubi ts or measures of time; four teen below and four teen above ; four teen from suns et to sunr ise, and four teen from sunr ise to suns et. The luna r measurement and ark were earlier than the solar, and these were afterwards appl ied to the luni - solar cycle of time. In the luni - solar mont h, the days, degrees, measures, or cubi ts, woul d be fifteen instead of fourteen to the half - circle. Thus , if the low er half of the circle cont ains fifteen measures called cubi ts, instead of fo urteen in the luna r reckoni ng, there woul d be fifteen measures above the mount ain - sum mit on which the level of the equi nox was marked, and this may be the meaning of the Hebrew and Toltec statements that the waters of the deluge prevailed fifteen cubi ts ab ove the highe st mount ains; the waters being celestial, the waters of Nnu or Noë. We hear most of the ark as a teba or box , which is a figur e of the four corners, and as the measures of twenty - eight , fourteen, and seven show , was a type of the luna r heaven that follow ed the stellar; the ark of Taht which superseded the ark of Sut; the ark of eight cubi ts, or the octona ry, which took the place of the heptanom is. The luna r nature of the Babyl oni an ark is also indi cated by its measures. On the deluge tablet, a s rende red by"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Smith, the bui lder of the ark relates that, “in its circuit it was fourteen measures”; “its frame fourteen measures it measured.” Now , as the cubi t was the typi cal measure, this was equi valent to four teen cubi ts. Boscawen has it: “Two sides w ere raised. In its enclosure four teen ribs, also fourteen they num bered above ” ( The Bible and its Monum ents, p. 117) . In this reckoni ng the ark of twenty - eight measures corresponds to the circle of twenty - eight luna r measures, or stations of the moon . Thus num erically the ark is identified as one with the arc by the four teen measures below and four teen above , and the ark of the moon was the ark of Osiris in the luna r mythos . As the luna r circle was divided in four qua rters, and these four were each subdi vid ed into seven, that may expl ain the statement of the bui lder, who says he divided the interior seven times and in a later version its passages or parts seven times (later version by Professors Haupt and Sayce). This ark of abode is adm ittedly bui lt “in a c ircuit” (col. 2), which has fourteen measures above and four teen below , sub - divided by seven in the interior and by seven in its parts or passages. There are two fourteens sub - divided by the two sevens, equa l to the luna r circle of twenty - eight measures, t he two luna tions of fourteen days, and the four qua rters of seven days each. And if the measure of four teen refers to one - half the luna r circle, it is pos sible that the measure of fifteen cubi ts appl ied to the rising waters in the Hebrew version is a measu re taken from the soli - luna r month of thirty measures or days, especially as the height of Noah’s ark was to be thirty cubi ts. The ark of twenty - eight measures woul d be luna r onl y, the ark in which Osiris rose again on the third day after his body had been torn into four teen parts and gathered toge ther in the sekru (or ark) chest, coffin (teba), for the revivification and resurrection in the ark of the moon. The ark of thirty measures (a measure in the hierogl yphi cs is a cubi t) woul d be soli - luna r in accord ance with the thirty days to the mont h; this, then, woul d be an ark of the sun and moon, which follow ed the luna r ark of twenty - eight cubi ts. The ark of seven 578 measures was the stellar heptanom is. The ark of eight measures is the octona ry of Taht, the luna r god; a heaven of four qua rters subdi vided by eight semi - cardinal poi nts into stations for the four wives, sisters or godde sses. Then follow ed an ark of the sun and moon and seven stars. Now , it is said in the Persian Rauzat - us - Safa that the Almight y fixed two luminous disks, one like the sun and the other like the moon, on the wall of the ark, and thus the hou rs of the day and night were ascertained (O’Neill, The Night of the Gods , p. 173 ). This is a mode of describing the additions made in the soli - luna r mythos to the ark of heaven, that was stellar at an earlier time, and is solar in its final pha se. The arkite sym bol ism culminated as Egyp tian in the ark of Nnu. This was the ark that was bui lt “with low er, second, and third stories” (Gen. VI. 16), b ecause it was a threefold figur e of Amenta, earth and heaven in one , as it is represented in the Ritual. Once it is show n that Noah’s ark is a geom etrical figur e of the heaven, there is no further difficulty respecting its size or cont ent. The beasts of th e earth, the birds of the air, the fish of the waters, and the hum an beings were all represented by the four type s at the four corners, by Tuamutef, the jackal; Kabhs enuf , the hawk; Hapi, the ape; and Amsta, the man. These were accom panied in the enclosure by their cons orts, Isis, the cow ; Serkh, the scorpion; Nepht hys , and Neith. Salvation from the deluge in the unde r - world is sought for by the Manes in the ark, whether called the ark of Osiris, or Ra, or Nnu. The expe rience"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"attribut ed to Osiris as the god in Amenta, is also assigne d to the soul of the deceased. In setting by night into the waters, the sun - god entered into the ark of earth, which is called his coffin or sarcopha gus , in which he was enclosed by Sut, the pow er of darkne ss. In one form this wa s figur ed as the coffin - mount ain, or neb - ankh, that was represented by the hill, Bakhu, the dimensions of which are given in the Ritual (ch. 109) . The hill Bakhu was the place of sunr ise where dawn broke on the coffin - lid; and the lengt h of this coffin, or ark of earth, was 300 cubi ts. It is stated in the papyr us of Nebseni that the hill is 300 cubi ts in breadth. In other papyri it is said to be 300 cubi ts in lengt h. This is conne cted with the measurement of the earth. Thus the ark of Osiris in the earth, a nd the ark of Noah are identical in lengt h. The ark being also a figur e of heaven, the 300 count ries in Yima’s kingdom are an astronom ical measure equi valent to the 300 cubi ts of Noah’s ark, and likewise to the area of 300 cubi ts of the Egypt ian hol low hil l, or ark of earth. It is pos sible to identify the cons tellation of Argo - Navis as the obj ect - picture in the night ly heaven of the ark that Nnu cons tructed for the great god Ra, and thence the ark of Noah in the Hebrew version of the legend. In the pictures of the planisphe re, which still remain on the celestial globe , it may be seen that the figurehead of the vessel is a ram. This was the type of the ram - headed Num , lord of the inund ation, and Num was the later form of Nnu, the god of the celestial water, w ho was the builder of the ark for Ra. By day the solar orb was carried on the ark of Nnu, and by night the gods and glorified were seen in Argo - Navis on its voya ge, as the “collector of soul s” sailed upw ard for the circum pol ar paradise along the river of t he Milky Way. Now , Argo - Navis is the onl y cons tellation that is figur ed hind - before on the celestial globe . As 579 Aratos describes the vessel, “Argo by the great dog’s tail is drawn; for hers is not a usual cour se, but backw ard turned she com es, as vess els do when sailors have transpos ed the crooke d stern on entering harbou r; all the ship reverse. And gliding backw ard on the beach it grounds sternforward, thus is Jason’ s Argo drawn” (Aratos, Phainom ena, R. Brow n, lines 342 - 348 ). But, what can be the mean ing of an ark or ship that makes its voya ge through the firmamental waters in this hindward way? We can but infer that it was an obj ect - picture of the ark of Nnu, as “the bark of millions of years” receding in this backw ard fashion as it made the circuit o f Precession.

In the great year of precession there are seven sta tions of the celestial pol e, six of which are still identifiable in the cons tellations of Draconi s, the Lesser Bear, Kephe us, Cygnus , Lyra, and Herakles. The pol e change s, and its pos ition is appr oxi mately determined by anot her central star about each 3,70 0 years. Seven times in the great year the station of the pol e was raised aloft as land - mark amid the firmamental waters in the shape of an island, or a mound; a tree, a pillar, hor n, or pyr amid. Whichever the type this was repeated seven times in the circ uit of precession, to form the com pound and collective figur e of the celestial heptanom is, so that the heaven rested, or was raised, at last upon the seven mount ains or seven mounds ; seven islands , seven giants, seven caves, seven trees, seven pillars, or other structures of suppor t, as seven figures of the all - sustaining pol e. Seven gol den isles emerged from out the watery vast, or wisdom reared the seven pillars of her hous e; the heavens were bor ne upon the backs of seven giants, or the eternal city was b uilt upon the seven hills. It woul d take som e six - and - twenty thous and years to bui ld the heptanom is on the suppor t of the seven pol es. These were adde d one by one and figur ed collectively as seven sustaining pow ers of the heavens, such as seven hippopot am i; seven crocodi les; seven bears; seven mount ains; seven mounds of earth; seven trees or a tree with 580 seven branches; a serpent with seven heads; a fish with seven fins; seven hor ns of Sesheta the foundr ess; seven pillars; seven giants; seven cyclops , with pol aris for a singl e eye; and lastly, there are the seven divinities called “the lords of eternity.” Seven periods in precession correspond to seven stations of the pol e. The lengt h of time in each when measured by the changi ng pol e - stars is about 3, 700 years. Seven times the “Atlantean pol e” sank in the waters of the deluge dur ing the great year. This was figured as the seven sunke n islands of the lost Atlantis. But there is another lost land of Atlantis, that passed away in ten islands , imaging a va nished heaven in ten divisions . The first was the heptanom is of the seven kings or rulers. The second is the heaven in ten divisions which ende d with the deluge of the ten kings or patriarchs in the Semitic legends . These two vanished heavens will account for two great years, or two - and - fifty - thous and years of time. The pol e and equi nox are travelling par i pas su, one in the uppe r circle of the heavens, the other in the larger low er circle of the ecliptic, and the shifting of the equi nox was correlated more or less exactly to the changi ng of the pol e - star. The pow er that presided ove r the pol e as Osiris was given rebirth as Horus in the vernal equi nox. The pol e - star sym bol ized the lord of eternity. Horus in the equi nox (or the doubl e equi nox) was a traveller of eternity manifesting in the sphe re of time; in the Han - cycle of 120 years; in the hous e of 1,000 years; in the sothic cycle of 1,460 years; or in the change from sign to sign, each 2,155 years. For two thous and years and more the pol e - star in the Lesse r Bear has coincided with the vernal equi nox in the sign of Pisces. Previous ly the pol e in Draconi s coincided with the vernal equi nox in the sign of the ram or the bul l.

So, in the celestial drama portrayed in the boo k of Revelation, the fall of the dragon, or, astronom ically, the change of pole - star, when a - Draconi s was supe rseded, is follow ed by the exaltation of the lamb upon the solar mount of glory. The longe r one dw ells in presence of Egypt , the older grow s the face of her unve il ed antiqui ty. Not fifty merely, but more like a thous and centuries look dow n upo n us from her sum mit of attainm ent, the pyr amid of her glory, that she bui lt for ever in the highe st heaven of her heavens. It was asserted by Martianus Capella that the Egypt i ans had secretly cultivated the science of astronom y for 40, 000 years before it was made know n to the rest of the world (Lewis, Astronom y of the Ancients, p. 264) . As time - keepers, the astronom ers of Egypt had thought and wrought , obs erved and registered o n the scale of the great year of the uni verse. The circuit of precession first out lined by the move ment of the celestial pol e was their circle of the eternal, or seven eternals, that was imaged by the Shennu - ring, and likewise by the serpent of eternity, w hen this was figur ed with tail in mout h and one eye always ope n at the centre of the coil. They not onl y laid great bases for eternity in this way, they bui lt upon the basis of all time which culminated in the cycle of precession. When Herodot us was in Egy pt, the “mystery teachers of the 581 heavens” told him that during a certain lengt h of time which had been reckone d by the Egypt ian astronom ers, “the sun had four times risen out of his usual qua rter; that he had twice risen where he now sets, and twice set where he now rises. Yet, that no change in the things of Egypt had been occasione d by this, either in the produc tions of the earth ‘or the river.’” And he adds , the Egypt ians say, they know these things with accuracy because they always com put e and reg ister the years (B. 2, 142 and 145) . Now there is no cycle in astronom y, save the circle of the precessional move ment in which the phe nom ena thus unw ittingl y described by the faithful old chroni cler coul d occur. One such cycle is certain, two are not impro bable, and three are pos sible. After long study of the whol e matter one sees perforce that the science of astronom y in Egypt , with its obs erved and registered cycle or cycles in precession, is actually older than any race of men on earth out side of Africa. The Book of the Dead (chs. 114 and 123) not onl y prove s the ancient Egypt ians to have been acqua inted with the precessiona l move ment, it also gives us an account of the actual changi ng of a pol e - star. The god Taht, the measurer of time, by means of the m oon and the Great Bear, is to be seen in the midst of his mysteries, which are here described as thos e of keeping the chrono logy for the gui dance of pos terity. There is a change in the pos ition of the Maat, or judgm ent - hall, which in the stellar mythos was at the station of the pol e, and was shifted with the shifting pol e. On account of this change , Taht com es as the messenge r of Ra in the soli - luna r mythos to make fast that which was afloat upon the Urnas (Greek Ouranos ) water; to re - adjust the reckoni ng a nd to “restore the eye” (Rit., ch. 114) by making it “firm and permanent” (ch. 116 ) onc e more for keeping time and period correctly on the scale of the great year. The backw ard motion of precession is described when Taht says to Atum - Ra,” I have rescued th e Atu from his backw ard cour se. I have done what thou hast prescribed for him.” As Renouf remarks, “I do not think any astronom er woul d hesitate to say that precession is meant,” by this"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"“backw ard cour se” (Rit., ch. 123 . Notes). The Atu is a mythical fish with som e relation to the cour se of the solar bark; that is to its backw ard cour se, the cour se of Argo - Navis. Taht has “rescued the Atu from his bac kward cour se.” He has allow ed for this retrograde motion in precession, and has made the eye firm and fixed onc e more by means of his reckoni ngs as a gui de to pos terity. Taht also says at the same time, “I have equa lly balanced the divine pair, (Sut and Horus) and put a stop to their strife.” This changi ng of the pol e occurs onc e every 3,714 years, or, in the ro und num bers of the out siders, every 3,000 years. This is allude d to by Theopom pus , who tells us that “according to the Magi,” “one of the gods shall conque r, the other be conqu ered, alternately for 3,000 years; for anot her 3,000 years they shall fight , war , and undo one the works of the other; but in the end hades will fail, and men will be happy, neither requi ring food , nor cons tructing shelter; whilst the god who hath cont rived all this is qui et, and resting himself for a time” (Plutarch, Of Isis and Osir is, 47) . The conf lict is identical with the battle of Sut and Horus on the grand scale. Three thous and years in round num bers with a surplus know n to the Urshi, poi nt to a period in precession 582 (3,714) equi valent to a change from one pol e - star to anot her, in the station of the pol e, onl y the lengt h of time is now appl ied to soul s in the eschatology, passing through the astronom ical cycle of the prove rbial 3,000 years. The Chinese “peach - tree of the gods ” is a magni ficent image of the pol e. It has seven branches that bear the fruit of immortality, the fruit which ripens onc e in 3,000 years. Three thous and, we repeat, being a round num ber for the cycle, where 4,000 woul d not have answered when the exact num ber is 3,714 years. The peaches from this tree of time or know ledge were seven in series, as is show n by the seven peaches which were brought by the mythical Wang - Mu when she visited the equa lly mythical Emperor Wa Ti. Also the seven peaches as total fruit of the tree tend to prove that the figur e was em ploye d as a round num ber in thous ands , near enough for the non - initiated and the surplus allow ed for in reckoni ng the total com bination. It is feasible to suppos e that the hangi ng and suspendi ng pow er of the firmament was an earlier sour ce of wonde rment t han even the revol ution of the heavenly bodi es. There is a passage in the Argona uticon (2, 296 ) which appe ars to show that the not ion of suspension preceded that of revol ving. “And so it is that men call thos e isles, the isles of turning, though aforetime they called them the floating isles” (Pilotes). These were the islands figur ed in the firmamental sea. Thus unde r one image groups of the revol ving stars were thought of as the gol den isles afloat in the celestial waters of the firmament. A typi cal floatin g island called Chemmis was show n to Herodot us in the deep broad lake, near the precinct of the temple of Buto, where it represented the place of refuge in which the infant Horus (Apol lo) was conc ealed and saved when sought for by the devour ing Apap (Herod otus, B. 2, 156) . This place of birth was first figured in the stellar mythos as a floating island of the pol e. The islands of Atlantis, whether seven or ten in num ber, woul d not have becom e the sunke n islands unl ess they had been floating isles at first; and they were floating as formations in the water of heaven. The earliest foot hol d in the infinite had been phys ically attained amongs t the stars that do not set. This was a place of"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"refuge and of safety from the deluge of the firmamental deep whenever the catastrophe occurred. It may sound a paradoxi cal thing to say, but it is true that according to the mythical representation the earliest earth was a bit of ground solidified in the celestial waters for the planting of a stake, or tree, or bui lding, raisi ng a pile, or som e kind of bul wark against the ove rwhelming water - flood. The Egypt ian hierogl yphi c - sign of land, locality, or station is the well - know n cake, that looks like our Easter hot - cross bun, and is a figur e of the land that was caked or coagul ated amidst the waters. This first formation in the waters of the Nun was cons tellated at the place of equi poi se and fixity, when this was at the pol e. And in the Osirian mythos this first standi ng place remained as a throne of the Eternal on the moun t amid th e water of the uppe r deep. In what is termed the Japanese “Cosmology” there is a primitive rende ring of this beginni ng. Two of the Kami - deities, Izanagi and Izanami, the brother and sister correspondi ng to the Egypt ian Shu and Tefnut , who lifted up the par adise of Am - Khemen, 583 are divinely deput ed to make, cons olidate, and give birth to the island of Japan. For this pur pos e they were provided with a heavenly spear made of a jewel; a dua l figur e of the pol e and pol aris. Thus equi ppe d, the pair stood on t he “floating bridge ” of heaven, and chur ned the Isle of Onogor o from the waters. This is the earth or ground that was cons tellated in an island called “the self - curdled.” (B. H. Chamberlain, Kojiki, 18, 19. ) The matter that was conde nsed around the spear o r pol e with which they chur ned the waters formed the land of Nippon, or Japan. Onog oro, says Hatori Nakatsune , a native com mentator, was originally at the nor th pol e, but was afterwards shifted to its present pos ition. (E. M. Satow , Pure Shi nto, p. 68. ) Th at is when the island which was “self - curdled” in the celestial ocean gave its name to an earthly island in the Yellow Sea. To see that the jewelled spear was an emblem of the pole we have but to com pare this legend with the Indian version called “the chur ning of the ocean,” in which a mount ain (the mount of the pol e) takes the place of the spear as the typi cal chur ning - stick. (Moor e’s Hindu Pant heon. ) But this was no cosmical creation of the earth itself amidst the waters of space. Such an interpretation i s onl y an errone ous literalization of the legenda ry lore. When the primal pair of the Japanese Kami took possession of the island which had been coagul ated from the deep, they stuck the spear into the ground or earth. This was a mode of planting the tree o r establishing the pole as a primary founda tion in the water of heaven, that was now repeated in the resting - place on earth as a likeness of the pol e above . (B. H. Chamberlain, Kojiki, pp. 18, 19.) Garcilasso de la Vega relates that the Inca told him how “ Our Father” sent two of his children, a brother and sister, dow n from heaven. He gave them a gol den rod, two finge rs thick and half an ell long , and when they desired to rest anyw here they were to stick this into the ground , and wherever it entered the ear th at one pus h, there they were to halt, establish themselves, encamp, and hol d their cour t or bui ld the city. Here the brother and sister are anot her form of Shu and Tefnut . In a Dog - rib Indian myth a planting of the pol e occurs. It is said that the divin e hero, Chapewee, stuck a piece of wood in the earth, which became a fir tree, that grew and grew unt il it reached to heaven. Then Chapewee ascende d the tree, and at the sum mit found a fine large plain and a beaten road to travel on."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" The present writer co ntends that the deluge - legends of the world are based upon the astronom ical mythol ogy of Egypt , but that in the isolation of the primitive emigrants the ancient wisdom lapsed and the deluge as a mode of sym bol ism in astronom y was more or less lost sight of ; and, from lack of know ledge , the mythical deluge was conf used with the primitive conc ept of heaven as the water overhead. With the know ers the deluge was a typi cal figur e; with the ignor ant it was an actuality that might at any time recur, as did the wat er - flood on earth. The chief cont ribut ion made by the Semites to the astronom ical mythol ogy was in literalizing the legends which originated with the mythical mode of representation, and in put ting forth an exot eric version of the ancient wisdom . Thus it w as natural that in a count ry like Babyl oni a where the winter rains were held to be a curse the typi cal deluge of Nnu in the celestial waters shoul d be conf used 584 with the flood of Bel or Noah on the surface of the earth. Pliny calls Belus the “inve ntor of sidereal science” (N. H. 6, 26), and Belus as the elder Bel was a form of the Egypt ian Bar, a name of Sut. As Diodor us relates (I. 28, 29) , the Egyp tians claimed to have taught the science of astronom y to the Babyl oni ans, and declared that Belus and hi s subj ects were a colony from Egypt . Belus (the first Bel) being identified with Bar=Sut, this means that the coloni sing of Babyl oni a from Egypt was during the reign of Sut, or at least in the time of the primordial pole - star one great year ago, when the p ole - star was previous ly in the Lesser Bear or the male hippopot amus. In astronom y the status of an arch - first depende d on being foremost in time, and Sut was first as bul l of the mother, or the male hippopot amus with the female. We hold the found er of astr onom y to have been the establisher of the pol e, whether as Sut, in the sout hern, or Sut - Apap in the nor thern heaven. And the most profoundl y impor tant of all the deluge s was that which took place at the subs idence and subm ergence of the pol e and changi ng o f the pol e - star, the star that fell from heaven, according to the astronom ical mythol ogy. The Book of Enoch says that, previous ly to the Noachian deluge , Noah saw that the earth became inclined and that destruction appr oached. Then he lifted up his feet an d went to the ends of the earth, to the dw elling of his great grandfather Enoc h (ch. 64). The “Ends of the Earth” was an expr ession for the two pol es — the dw elling of Enoch being equi valent to that of Sut at the sout hern pol e. The beginni ng, how ever, was no t with boa ts or arks as a means of crossing the celestial water of the Nun. Islands were figur ed earlier. Typi cal heaps of earth were raised by the mound - bui lders as ground to go upon , like steppi ng - stone s in the celestial deep. These eventually were seven in num ber. The structure also range d from seven mounds at first to seven cities finally. Naturally the mount or mound of earth, the tree, the papyr us - reed, or island was a type of emergence from or amid the waters earlier than the bui lding of a boa t or an ark in the celestial sea. The first ideas were thos e of suspension, fixity, and foot hold in the liqui d vast. In various primitive legends the bul wark was raised against the waters but was ove rthrow n because the faithless wom an failed to keep the secret w ith which she had been entrusted. We have already cited one or two American and African instances. In a Muys cas myth, Huyt haca was the old first mother who ruled when there was as yet no sun or moon . She is described as a very wicked woman who malicious ly love d to spoi l the work of her hus band. It was she who caused a flood from which but a few persons"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"escaped by seeking refuge on the moun tain - tops . Bochica, the solar god , then put a stop to the deluge , and, being very wroth with Huyt haca, drove her from th e earth and change d her into the moon. The result of the flood, in this case, was the same as in the “Destruction of Manki nd, ” viz., the establishm ent of solar time. When the earth was dry again Bochica gave the year and the periodi c sacrifices and the wor ship of the sun to the peopl e who survived the flood. (Tylor, Primitive Culture, vol . I, pp. 318 - 319 .) Nut, the celestial wateress in the Ritual, was a keeper of the waters which the wom en of the legends failed to gua rd. Hence “the leg of 585 Nut” is a figure of the pol e. In one of the legends the children of Nut, that is the stars, have failed in keeping prope r time, and been the cause of conf usion and strife. This is in an addr ess to the moon - god Taht, who succeeded Sut the star - god as reckone r of time by means of the moon . “Hail, Taht! what is it that hath happe ned to the divine children of Nut? They have done battle, they have made strife, they have wrought evil, they have created the fiends , they have made slaught er, they have caused troubl e; in all their doi ngs the might y have worked against the weak. Grant, O might of Taht, that that which the god Tum hath decreed may be done . Thou regardest not evil, nor art thou provoke d to evil, nor art thou provoke d to ange r when they bring their years to conf us ion, and rush in and disturb their mont hs; for in all that they have done unt o thee they have worked iniqui ty in secret” (Rit., ch. 175, Budge ). When the pol e - star change d the bulwark woul d be ove rthrow n, and the mistress of the waters woul d be charged wit h causing a catastrophe by which the “bul warks” of her cons ort, who was Sut in the Egypt ian astral mythos , were subm erged. The blame, of cour se, in after - times, was laid upon the wom an, that is when the wom an had taken the place of the primitive zoot ype , s uch as the water - cow or crocodi le. In Amenta Ptah is the builder of the bul wark that was raised against the waters, or to keep out the Apap - reptile. But Sut - Anup, as a ruler at the pol e, was an inde finitely earlier god who raised the bul wark to keep out th e deluge . In later ages, when Anup had becom e the son of Ra, one name for his dw elling - place upon the mount ain, that was on the solar mount of glory, is called Ut, the “Tow n of the Embankm ent,” which is equi valent to the pile of earth that was heaped up by the mythical mound - bui lders in seven mounds that formed the bul warks or embankments at the seven stations of the pol e in the circuit of precession. When the deluge occurred at the celestial pol e the type of stability and fixed foot hol d on land was whelmed beneath the firmamental waters. If this was an island or a tree it sank and was lost sight of. Hence the tree of the pol e had to be replanted, or the embankm ent was to be raised anew when the deluge was ove r. It is related by the Miztec tribe of Indi ans t hat “in the day of obs curity and darkne ss the gods bui lt a palace which was a masterpiece of skill, and made their abode upon the sum mit of a mount ain. The rock was called ‘the Place of Heaven.’ It was the primary dw elling of the gods . The children of the gods planted a garden with fruit - trees. But it is the old uni versal tale: there came a deluge ; the happy garden was subm erged, and many sons and daught ers of the gods were swept away” (Bancroft, Native Races, vol . III, p. 71) . Inevitably, at times our eart h gets subs tituted for the mound, the island, or the earth - heap piled as a fixture for foothol d in the celestial waters. The mound of earth was follow ed by the pyr amidion of brick, wood, or stone , the earliest figur e of the tow er that was bui lt to"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"reach th e sky. Thus , when the flood of Noah came to an end, the tow er of brick was raised by the survivor s in the land of Shinar. In this version we see the tow er succeeding the mount ain, and the mound as a typi cal figur e of the station at the pole. After the Assy rian deluge the tree was replanted in the circle or enclosure, and to replant the tree was to re - establish the pol e in its new station; the tree or wood that was said 586 to be eternal. Noah likewise planted the tree which in his case was the vine. In th e book of Enoc h it is said the por tion of Noah (in time) has ascende d up to God, and now “the ange ls shall labour at the trees” (or tree) and “the seed of life shall arise from it.” This may likewise be taken to denot e a replanting of the tree as sym bol of the pole. Xisuthrus, the Chaldean Noah, is called the King of Surippa k, the ship - city, the city of refuge that was represented by or as an ark upon the waters. The bui lding on land was earlier than the boa t upon the waters, and when the gods decide to mak e a deluge it is said, upon the Chaldean tablet, “O man of Surippa k, son of Ubarratutu, destroy the hous e and bui ld a ship.” Here the ship or ark on the waters succeeds the dw elling - place on land. And bot h the ark and hous e were uni ted in Surippa k, the ark - city, or “City of the Ship.” After the Babyl oni an deluge , Hasisadra says, “I bui lt an altar on the peak of a mount ain,” and there he offered a sacrifice to the gods . The altar - mound , we repeat, is a figur e of the pol e. The structure ove rthrow n by the delu ge is rebui lt in several ways, the type s rangi ng from the mound to the metropol is. Not onl y is the typi cal altar of the pol e erected on the mount ain - peak, but the structure was finally rebui lt on the scale of the eternal city. Thus , the ark - city of Surippa k is succeeded by the city of Erech - Subur i. In raising this, “great stone s” are dragge d for a long distance to where the wall of the new enclosure is to be erected, on the sum mit of the ascent, in the midst of Erech - Subur i. Seven such structures were raise d in the cour se of precession, at seven stages of the pole, and the jour ney from one stage to anot her is described in the legend of Gilgames (Deluge Tablet, colum n 6, George Smith, Records, vol . VII, p. 133) . In the Noachian version the deluge is follow ed by the bui lding of “an altar to the Lord” (ch. 8, 20) . There is also a jour ney made to “a plain in the land of Shinar where the generations of Noah came to dw ell. And they said one to anot her “Go to . . . Let us bui ld us a city, and a tow er whos e top may r each to heaven, and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whol e earth.” In this account we find three figur es of the pole, the altar - mound , the tow er, and the city; also the migration of the survivors to anot her station of the pol e; which is a com mon feature in the astronom ical mythos , particularly in the Aztec, Peruvi an, and Mexican legends . So ancient was this erection and re - erection of the pol e, which signi fied anot her station fixed in the celestial jour neyings , that the erection of a pole in the earth became a sacred mode of marking the station and the camping - place for the wande rers ove r the surface of the earth, as with the two pol es of the Australian Arunta, and the stave or rod of the Inca. The Tow er of Babel was a s ym bol of the pol e which had been ove rthrow n or shifted by the waters of the deluge . To bui ld the tow er, then, was to replace the pol e. The tow er was the Babyl oni an Bab - illu, which the Hebrew writer has turned into the tow er of “babbl e” and conf usion. The s tory itself is found on an Assyrian tablet in the British Museum , with this difference: In the older legend the structure is a mound, whereas in the Hebrew version it is a tow er bui lt of brick. It is expl ained that Babyl on corrupt ly turned to sin. “Great a nd"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"small com mingl ed on the mound. ” There was a revolt against the great god Anu, “king of the hol y 587 mound. ” The rebels are described as bui lding a stronghol d, but they were conf ounde d in their work. What they did by day was all undone by night . The su preme god gave a com mand to make strange their speech. “For future time the mount ain,” or the mound, was ove rthrow n by Nu - nam - nir, the god of lawlessness or no rule, and the destruction occurred, though not in the form of a deluge ( Records of the Past, vol . VII, p. 131) . In the Mexican pictures there is an earlier type of the pole as a poi nt of departure than the tow er of brick. It has been called the starting - poi nt of the Aztecs after the deluge . In this the mount or mound of earth rises from the water, li ke an island from the ocean, with a tree upon its sum mit. The mount is thus identifiable with the pol e by means of the typi cal tree. It is likewise identified with the pol e as the mount that toppl es ove r, the crooke d mount Culhua can, upon which the ark of Tezpi rested after the deluge . In one drawing the male and female pair are por trayed with the boa t waiting for them on the water. In the other a man in the boa t is paddl ing away from the poi nt of departure. The pair are know n to tradition as Cox - Cox and hi s cons ort. The picture is also said to illustrate the migration from a starting - poi nt in Atlan, or Aztlan, the white mount ain. Without recurring for the present to the beginni ng of astronom y in the equa torial regions , we look on Sut (or Sut - Anup) , the firs t - born son of Apt (Kep or Kefa), the most ancient form of the Great Mother, as the founde r of the celestial pol e, or the eternal tree in the paradise, the garden or cultivated enclosure of the northern heaven. Sut and his mother became the primal pair in t he Egypt ian mythol ogy . Although the mother of all living things , one of whose names, Khefa, survived in Hebrew as Chavva h (Eve), the primal pair of beings were not cons tellated as the hum an parents of the human race, but as male and female hippopot ami, or Behemoth and Leviathan, and later as the Greater and the Lesser Bears; she as the maker of the circle, and he as the first to plant the tree, or erect the pol e, the pillar, or the mound within the circle; Job says of Behemoth, “he is the chief of the ways of God” (ch. 40, 19). Now , Behemoth is the Egypt ian Bekhm ut, the hippopot amus. This was female as the zoot ype of the Great Mother, and male as the image of Sut her son, who as the founde rs of the pol e were “the chief of the ways” in heaven as establishers of a gui ding - star at the pol e. When the primal pair are represented in the book of Genesis by Adam and Eve they are the hus band and wife in a later mythos that was solar. But in the primal legends the descent of the hum an race is traced to the primal pair when these were mother and son, or the brother and sister as represented in the Japanese creation of the pol e. The earliest flood , caused by the declination of the pol e - star, set afloat a large num ber of legends . One of these relates that the new world w hich follow ed was peopl ed by a brother and sister. The Chins, on the Burma front ier, preserve the tradition of a uni versal deluge that was co - eval with the origin of their race. According to the Haka tradition all the hills were subm erged, and every person was drow ned except one brother and sister, who floated in a large earthen jar, and when the waters subs ided settled on the Mun Ktlang mount ain ( Pione er, Allahabad, October 22nd, 1897) . The old earth - "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"588 mother, who was represented as the bringe r - forth of life from the waters in the shape of a pregna nt hippopot amus, was imaged astronom ically as the genetrix who brought forth her young from the firmamental water amidst the fields of papyr us - reed which formed the Sekhe t - Aarru. The same in Apta at the nor th ern pole as it was in Apta at the equa tor. This old mother of beginni ngs in the waters of earth and heaven was also repeated as the dragon - hor se in the Chinese version of the astrono mical uranogr aphy as well as in the Babyl oni an remains. It is recorded in the sacred books that a supe rnatural dragon - hor se issued from the waters of heaven and made know n the eight mystical diagrams of Tai - Hao, the first mythical or celestial ruler, who corresponds to Sut, the inve ntor of astronom y in Egypt , and Bel in Babyl oni a. The mother and son were the pair that preceded the indi vidua lising of the fatherhood; and the son was mythically represented as bot h the child and cons ort, the adul t or bul l, of the mother. According to the Indi an tribes of Guiana, the primal pair were a male and female, saved from the Deluge in a canoe . This is a legend of the Tamaracks. It is the same representation in the ancient British tradition. The Welsh first parents, named Dwyva n and Dwyva ch, are a male and female who found safety from the Delu ge in an ark. Also on the Apamean coin the pair as Nu, or Noë, and his female cons ort are portrayed upon the waters floating in a box or teba, accom panied by a raven and a dove . There is also a primal pair conne cted with the tree in a legend of New Guinea who are called “the man and his mother.” The man is so might y that he thrusts a spear through the earth right into the heart of the rock, where the pair live in the condi tion of trogl odyt es. The spear evidently images the pol e, which is mixed up, if not id entified, with the tree, as is the spear of the male and female pair in the Japanese legend. The man and his mother climbed to the top of the tree, and there the strong man slew the giant, the Apap - mons ter slain by Horus, and the giant slain by Jack (H. H. Rom ily, My Verandah, p. 118) . The giant is a co - type with the Apap - serpent of drought and darkne ss; and in anot her legend the mons ter is a serpent coiled about the tree. This may help us to unde rstand the presence of the evil serpent with “the man and his mother” unde rneath the tree in the Assyrian garden of Edin. The mother is the old first genetrix, one of whos e titles is “mistress of the mount ains” as well as of the moun t. The Samoans say that the first of the hum an race were a wom an and her son. Turner tells us they have many tales about the doi ngs of that wom an and her son, from whom the race of men descende d ( Sam oa, p. 330 - 1). Thus , man and woman originated as the mother and her son, or the sister and brother, who afterwards became the mythical mother and father in the solar legends , which reflect the later sociology. In one tradition of the Ainu it is related that the race originated with a primal pair of ancestors, who were a female bear and a dog . This is, of cour se, in accordance with the totemic s ym bol ism, onl y the totemic sym bol s were not limited to the hum an groups . Totems of the nature - pow ers were also figur ed in the planisphe re. In Africa the great first mother of all was cons tellated as the female hippopot amus, or as a crocodi le. In 589 "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Gree ce she was imaged as the female bear. Sut, her son, was represented by a jackal which became the dog through change of fauna . These can now be traced to the Greater and Lesser Bears as two surviving cons tellations of the Great Mother and her dog , who cons t itute the primal pair of the Ainu, with the bear as the Great Mother and the dog (or jackal) as her son or cons ort when the pol e was in the Lesser Bear, we might say one great year ago. Sut, as ruler of the primal pol e - star, was the Arch - First in heaven, as a male. This is the title of Tai - Yih, the Chinese great one . It is said that among all the shin, or spirits (the Japanese shintu gods ), of the heavens, the highest one dw ells in the star Tai - Yih of the cons tellation Draco (O’Neil, Night of the Gods , vol . I, pp. 513 , 517) . It is not enough, how ever, to identify the deity with the pol e in general. There were seven of these gods , and everyw here the que stion is, which of the seven stations of the pol e was the seat at the time? Draconi s was the cons tellation of Horus - Sebek, the crocodi le - dragon. Sut was the first - bor n child of the great mother Apt or Khep, and thos e two formed the primary dua d that is som etimes called Sut - Typhon, the nearest appr oach to which name in Egypt ian woul d be Sut - Tept, or Sut and his mother as the primal pair. According to one account of the origins in the Book of Genesis, Seth, Set, or Sut was the first - bor n child of Chavva h, as he had been of Kep or Kefa in the Kamite mythos. Sut was the primary ruler or ove r - lord, the earliest repre sentative of pow er in heaven figur ed in an image of the male, or the lord, whos e name was first called upon when Sut became the backbone of the uni verse, as establisher of the pol e. He was the lord as male hippopot amus and cons ort to the lady who was his m other as the female. And here we may perceive that a fragm ent of the true tradition survived in the biblical statement that in the time of Seth “Men began to call upon the name of the Lord” (Gen. IV. 26) . Sut, as male, was first of the seven brothers who i n the Babyl oni an legend “came as begetters.” This fact also is recogni sed in the text when it is said that “a son was bor n to Seth,” or Sut, Egypt ian, who was the first form of the father as the elder brother with whom the fatherhood began. It is said of I aldabaoth that, being incensed with men because they did not worship or honour him as god and father, he being the oldest brother onl y, he sent forth a deluge upon them that he might at onc e destroy them all ( Irenae us, Book I, ch. XXX, 10) . Sut acqui red an evil character in later times, and became the original form of an anthropom orphi c Satan. He was looke d upon as the fallen leader of the ange lic hos t because he had been first in glory as the ruling pow er at the primary station of the pol e. This is the Sat an worshippe d by the Izedis in Mesopot amia, for whom there is to be a restoration as well as a fall, which poi nts to an astronom ical origin in bot h aspects of the character. Sut, in the Ritual (ch. 175) , is proclaimed as having been the first in glory. It is said “the pow er of Sut which hath departed was greater than that of all the gods .” He was first as primary pow er of the pol e, the first to sit upon “the mount of congr egation” as the “most high” in “the uttermost parts of the nor th,” or at the pol e of h eaven. Hence he was the reput ed author of astronom y. Thus , when the pol e - star of Sut in the jackal (or the hippopot amus) had fallen away from the true pol e and 590 lost its place as gui de of ways in heaven, there was matter for the legend of a fall as a fable founde d on a fact in the astronom ical mythol ogy. When so read, the fall of man"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"from heaven is resolved into the fall of Sut, or Lucifer, the light - bringe r, or the light that was upl ifted at the primary station of the pol e, the wom an who was the found ress being charged by the Semites, the Chinese, and others with being his accom plice and instigator, a mode of unc ons cious ly show ing that she, the Great Mother, was the move r, which she was, but onl y as the primum mobi le, not as the wom an urging the man to his eternal misery. The follow ing citation show s the primal pair as Ishtar and the elder Bel in relation to the mount of the pol e and the mount ains of its different stations . “O lady, mistress of the mount ain, goodl y stronghol d of the mount ains, might y lo ck of the mount ains, que en of the land of the four rivers. O lord, the might y mount ain, Bel!” (Tablet S. 954 , B. M. Budge , Babyl oni an). In this imagery the Great Mother as Ishtar, is mistress of the mount ain, and Bel is the lord, identical with the moun t i tself, which imaged the pol e, when Bel was the star. In one of the Assyrian hym ns this enclosure of the “lady of the eternal tree” and her com rade is spoke n of as “the park of Ishtar.” Nergal, the destroye r, is thus addr essed, “O lord, the park of Ishtar t hou establishest not ” (Sayce, “Hym n to Nergal,” Hib. Sect.), Nergal having been one of the ove rthrow ers at the time of the Deluge . In the Assyrian hym ns to the gods it is said that the lady of the eternal tree is the com rade of the bul l, the great bul l, th e supr eme bul l. The tree is the pol e; “the eternal wood” or Gis - Zida, which also seems to mean a mast, is the pol e (Sayce). Now , it is a form of this pair of founde rs at the pole that we think may be dimly discerned on the Assyrian cylinde r (see p. 453) . T he tree with seven branches represents the pol e as a figur e of the total heptanom is, and is cons eque ntly late. The pair beneath the tree are the mother and son, or male and female, of the legend as the primal pair who fell from heaven because they failed a s keepers of the tree of know ledge at the pol e. There is also a form of this primal pair to be seen in a drawing on one of the Greek vases which com es nearest to the Hebrew version of the wom an tempting the man. The Great Mother is por trayed in nobl e nudi t y, Greek fashion, as divinely tall beside a yout h to whom she is offering the fruit which she has plucked from the tree of know ledge , the tree that represented the pol e when the know ledge was astronom ical. The pair, like the female and male in the Assyrian garden, are unde rneath the tree, about the root of which the serpent coils. As Kamite, or as Greek, the ancient genetrix was the teacher who in later legend is misrepresented as the tempter. We now claim to have recove red the natural origin of the prime val paradise with the primal pair, the tree and serpent in the enclosure at the station first established at the fixed poi nt of the celestial pol e, of which so many versions and perversions are extant without one of them being scientifically correct or ver ifiable from lack of the long - lost data in astronom y. Egypt ian mythol ogy , the sour ce and fount ainhe ad of all the ancient wisdom and legenda ry lore, coul d not be unde rstood apart from this, neither can the astronom y be expl ained apart from the mythology. To repeat. The garden is the enclosure at the pol e that was first figur ed in the circle of the ancient genetrix. 591 The pol e itself was represented by the tree. The evil serpent sym bol izes the drought , the darkne ss, and the dearth in phys ical phe nom ena. T he reptile coils around the tree or is present in all the pictures, Egypt ian, Babyl oni an, Hindu, Red Indi an, Norse, and Greek,"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"also as described in divers ancient legends . The mother brought forth her child of life as the oppone nt of the evil serpent and p rotector of the tree, and the saviour in the Kamite mythol ogy was conve rted into a saviour in the Semitic eschatology. The Chinese have a tradition in which original sin is attribut ed to a woman who ove rthrew her “hus band’ s bul warks through an ambitious de sire for know ledge.” As in the Book of Genesis and the legend of the wicked Huyt haca, the sin is ascribed to the wom an. But we need to know what the bul wark was before we can see how it could ever have been ove rthrow n. She was Primus, as bui lder of the bul wark or as planter of the pol e, and, above all, as mistress of the waters which were unde r her cont rol, or shoul d have been, unless she had neglected them or entered into a league with the Apap - reptile, which was the primary evil pow er that ove rthrew the e nclosure with the deluge of the dark or the waters of the firmament. We meet with a form of the primal pair in Stanley’s legend of Lake Tanga nyi ka, one of the oldest in the world. In this the wom an had been trusted with the keeping of the waters. But she betrayed the secret to her love r and the waters broke forth in a deluge of destruction, the proof of which catastrophe remains to this day in Lake Tanga nyi ka. The Khonds of Orissa have a divinized form of the primal pair in their ancient godde ss, Tari Penn u, and her son, Buri Pennu , who answers to a pol e - star god inasmuch as he was called “the light .” These can be identified with the prototypa l pair, that is with Sut the establisher of the pol e and his mother, because he is credited with creating a primal p aradise, and she is charged with having malicious ly caused its destruction, which is elsewhere rende red as a deluge of water or a fall from heaven. Amongs t the mum meries still religious ly performed in Rom e, and also by the Engl ish Ritualists, which are my stical at present from lack of meaning, there is a ceremony of “the seven stations of the cross,” which is suppos ed to com memorate the seven resting - places of the cross on the way to Calvary. But the same, or a similar procession, was celebrated at Abydos or Memphi s when the tat - cross was carried round the seven resting - places that marked and memorized the seven stations of the pole. In one of the ancient Chaldean oracles the seven stations of the pol e are spoke n of as the seven pol es. “The Chaldeans call t he god (Dionys ius or Bacchus ) Iao in the Phœ nician tongue (instead of the intelligible light ), and he is often called Sabaoth, signi fying that he is above the seven pol es, that is the Demiurgus ” (Taylor, “Collection of the Chaldean Oracles,” Classical Jour nal , No. 22) . As Iamblichus says of the Chaldeans, “they not onl y preserved the memorials of seven - and - twenty myriads of years, as Hippa rchus tells us they have, but likewise of the whol e Apoc atastes and periods of the seven rulers of the world” (Nat. Gen. , vol. II, p. 321 ). It certainly was so with the Egypt ians. These rulers were the seven bor n of the Great Mother as the seven pow ers of earth. They were re - bor n of Nut, the mother - heaven, as the seven glorious ones, who 592 were called the Khut i; the sev en with Anup at the pol e who were the executione rs for the great judge ; the seven wise masters of art and science in the luna r mythos with Tehut i; the seven sahus with Horus in Orion; the seven as moul ders with Ptah in the making of Amenta; the seven as th e soul s of Atum - Ra who were the creators of man."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" These are the seven that were uranogr aphi c figur es in the astronom ical mythol ogy as the seven old, old one s; the seven patriarchs of enor mous age; the seven giants of colossal stature; the seven rulers of t he world; the seven lords or masters of eternity. In later times the seven planets have been mistaken for the seven stars. But these ancient pol e - stars we cons ider to be “the seven stars” of which it is related in the tradition reproduc ed by Plato that af ter many ages they would return and meet toge ther again in their old places as in the beginni ng, and appa rently at the time of the last deluge of all, or, as we read it, at the end of the great year. It was these and not the seven planets that coul d ever return to an original station at the starting point. The planets were but five in num ber and not seven in the most ancient astronom y. The sun, moon, and seven stars were not the seven planets of mode rn science. The seven, called the first of the stars, whi ch in the beginni ng were in heaven, are conne cted with the great year according to the book of Enoc h, as is show n by their being cast out unt il the day of the “great cons um mation” in “the secret year,” also called the “period of the great judgm ent.” The s even that were separate and singl e as rulers of the pol e were also groupe d toge ther as a pictorial illustration in the planisphe re. These are the seven in the cons tellation of the Lesser Bear who follow the bier or coffin of their lord, Osiris, in the Grea ter Bear. These are they of whom it is said, “Their places were fixed by Anup on the day of Com e thou hither” (Rit., ch. 17) , who became the seven lords of eternity, and who were looke d up to as seven divine ancestors of Atum - Ra. The names of seven supe rse ded watchers in heaven are given by Enoc h as: Azazyel, Amazarak, Armers, Barkayel, Akebeel, Tamiel, and Asaradel. Here also is evidence that the seven rishis who meditated and forgot were the representatives of seven pol e - stars. Dhruva was one of the rishi s who was assigne d a pol e - star by Vishnu. He is said to have meditated himself into forgetfulness of his identity (or ceased to be a pol e - star). The seven who slum bered and forgot are also represented by the seven sleepers in the cave at Ephe sus with their dog, who answer to the seven with Anup and his jackal at the pol e. The seven who slum bered and forgot likewise recur in the Norse mythol ogy. These are the seven sons of Mimir who gua rd the land of Odainsakr, the land of the ever - living. They are represent ed as the smiths who forged the primitive weapons and who correspond to the seven Khne mmu or divine metallurgists of Ptah. Though sleeping till the dus k of the last day, they keep the enclosure safe unt il the final conf lict com es betwixt the pow ers of good and evil. Then they are to wake and rise and help to establish the new heaven and rejuve nated earth. The seven unde r whatsoever name or type , watching or slum bering, are still the keepers of the world’s great year and the enclosure of the seven never - sett ing stars that marked the seven stations of the shifting pole. 593 Before the bui lding of the boa t the seven had to keep their heads above water as the seven mythical, immeasurable giants, equi valent in the supe rhum an gui se to seven great mount ains imag ing the seven starry sum mits. One of these giants is Ogg in Jewish legend, who is said to have waded through the deluge , clingi ng with one hand to the ark to keep afloat. The seven giants, as figures of seven colossal cons tellations , were tall enough to ho ld their heads, which are the seven pole - stars, above the waters that were"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"deep enough to drow n the other peopl e of the heavens. But when the boa t was bui lt there was an ark of safety that coul d float upon the waters, and the primordial seven were mythical ly represented as being saved from the deluge in an ark as seven com panions , Ali, Kabiri, Hohga tes, or other groups of the seven which had one origin in the astronom ical mythol ogy of Egyp t. And when the boat was launc hed upon the water of earth the type co uld be appl ied to the water of heaven. Seven giants, in one rende ring of the mythos , bore the world of the heptanom is upon their backs, each standi ng at his station as one of seven great props personi fied as giants. The unhum an huge ness of the giant was mo st naturally derived from the enor mous pre - anthropom orphi c type s or zoot ype s of supe rhum an pow er. Sut, as the hippop otamus, is a giant. But the seven primal pow ers as Egypt ian in the earliest hum an form are pigm ies and not giants. Moreove r, the giants were not hum an, whereas the pigm ies are. In an Arthurian legend the Welsh Owein com es to a side, ope n clearing with a great mound in it where there is a black giant, who stands upon one foot , and has onl y one eye in the middl e of his forehead (Rhys , Arth. Lege nd ). The mound , the giant with one foot and Cyclops ’ eye are perfect figur es of the pol e and pol e - star, which have here been groupe d toge ther in a later legend. The Irish Crom , Crom m Cruiach, “the crooke d or bent one of the mound ,” equa tes with the Mexican “crooke d mount ain” as the figur e of a falling or deflected station of the pol e. The Mexican tradition affirmed that it was in the first age of the world that the giants began to appe ar on the earth. These are the giants of the cons tellations who had been hum anized as magni fied non - natural men, and then transferred to our earth in the märchen that took the place of the gnos is, or science of the mythos . In the Aztec and Mexican versions of the deluge myths we find that when the great calamity occurred the la nd was peopl ed by giants. Seven of these who were brothers found safety by enclosing themselves in the seven caves of the mount ain Tlaloc. The Indi ans of Chol ula likewise relate that onl y seven inha bitants of this fore - world of the giants survived the delu ge. In Sout hern California the Indi ans have a tradition of the beginni ng in which Quaor, the Lord, when he created the world, or the new order of things , placed it on the shoul ders of seven sustaining giants ( Nat. Gen., vol . II, p. 220) . This world of the giants was the celestial heptanom is beyond the deluge . In a tradition of the American Indi ans it is told that at the close of the deluge the last mammoth sprang across Lake Supe rior at a singl e bound and disappe ared for ever in the wilds of Canada. Thus th e last of the seven astronom es, or its mammoth - type , disappe ared in the great deluge of all with the last of the giants. 594 The giants, who were seven in relation to the stations of the pol e, are curious ly identified with the mount ains themselves as pla ces of birth by Sanchoni athon. He says they were beings of vast bul k and stature, “whos e nam es were given to the mount ains which they occupi ed.” Of these, he tells us, children were begotten through intercour se with their mothers, “the wom en of thos e times without shame having intercour se with any man they might chance to meet.” Here the giant and the mountain as hum an birthplace are identical as figur es of the pol e (Cory, Ancient Fragm ents, 1876, p. 6). These, then, are a form of thos e giants called the so ns of God who “came in unt o the daught ers of men” (book of Genesis, also book of Enoc h)."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" In the Hebrew märchen, the seven old one s who were the primordial pow ers, the seven wise masters, watchers, judge s, rishis, manus, moul ders, masi, Ali, Elohi m, or Kab iri are the seven patriarchs of Genesis who lived for such enor mous lengt hs of time. They are the typi cal old one s in the Ritual, the fathers in the first and highe st circle of the gods . The seven patriarchs were identified in the Natural Genesis (vol . II, section 12) with the seven rishis in the luna r mythos of the Hindu astronom y. These, as measurers of the precessiona l move ment of the pol e by means of seven pol e - stars, were also represented as making a revol ution of the great year in the twenty - eight ast erisms or mansions of the moon . The patriarchs had now been hum anized. The Hindu patriarchate was a period of 71 - 2 years, or a mortal lifetime. Seven of these were the measure of a phœ nix - cycle, a period of 500 years. Seven by seven the rishis or manus tra vel round the zodi ac of 28 hous es, in the circle of precession. Thus the time of their stay in each asterism woul d be a twenty - eight h part of the great year of 25, 868 or, in round num bers, 26, 000 years. This woul d give the patriarchs or manus som ething ove r 900 years in each of the 28 luna r stations , which is qui te near enough as astronom ical data to account for the age of the seven patriarchs in the book of Genesis. The age of Adam is 930 years. The age of Seth 912 years. The age of Enoc h 905 years. The ag e of Kenan 910 years. The age of Jared 962 years. The age of Methus elah 969 years. Thus , the age of six of the seven patriarchs is ove r 900 years each, and in the first list of two the patriarchs are seven in num ber. No reason has been adduc ed for rejectin g this expl anation. If the seven patriarchs, like the seven rishis, the seven taasu, or the seven masi, were astronom ical characters, it is certain their ages are likewise astronom ical. Noah, who is tenth in the second list of patriarchs, is the man of 500 years who never coul d be mortal. But it can be show n in what way he was an astronom ical figure, like the rest of the seven, or the ten, according to the mode of measuring by the typi cal lifetime. The hum an lifetime was reckone d at 71 - 2 years; the age of a patriarch in human form. Seven of these periods in precession made a phœ nix - cycle of 500 years, the age, therefore, of a divine or mythical man like Noah or the Buddha . A legend of the Jayas, in the Vayu Purana, relates, in after times, that the astronom i cal rulers were created by Brahm a as his divine assistants, but that they got lost in meditation and forgot to fulfil his ordinances. On this account they were doom ed to be cont inua lly reincarnated and rebor n in each manva ntara or patriarchate up to the se venth, and thus they con - 595 tinue d to be rebor n in successive series of sevens all through the cycle of precession. The seventh was always rebor n as a manu or a Buddha in the Puranas, and in the Hebrew version Noah is the man of 500 years as a typi cal measurer of time, and in this instance it is the particular period of time that is ende d with a deluge (Gen. V. 32). Now among the Hebrew fragm ents of the ancient wisdom in the book of Genesis is the story of these patriarchs that was told according to the measuring by the lifetime. Previous to the deluge of Noah the lifetime of man or of the old, old one s was reckone d at som ething like 1,000 years. As we are told, “there were giants in the earth in thos e days.” But after the deluge , time, or the age of man , was to be com put ed by shor ter lengt hs. This is expr essed in uranogr aphi c formulæ: “Yet shall his days be an hundr ed and twenty years,” which period as Egypt ian is the doubl e Han - cycle. Thus the change from a lifetime of 1,000"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"years to a period of 120 yea rs is obvi ous ly related to the doubl e Han - period of the Sothiac - cycle. The doubl e Han - cycle is a period of 120 years. Cons eque ntly the lifetime of man after the deluge is measurable by the lengt h of this period, which was made use of in reckoni ng the cycle of Sothis. And whether the lifetime is reckone d at 120 years in the Sothiac cycle, or at 3,714 in the circle of precession, bot h are astronom ical. The lifetime of the patriarch was a period in precession. Noah’s lifetime was a phœ nix - cycle of 500 years wh ich ende d with the Noachian deluge . After this the lifetime of man (who takes the place of the Bennu as an astronom ical figur e) was to be the Han - cycle of 120 years. Thus the heaven or zodi ac in twelve divisions was proba bly based on the Sothiac - cycle. Twe lve Han - cycles were twelve lifetimes in the year of Sothis, round num bers being employe d and the fractions gathered up to be quot ed in the total com bination, or filled in with the festivals, such as the Sut - Heb. This was a seven days’ festival celebrated e very thirty years. At the end of each Han - cycle it was seen that the legal year had gained a whol e mont h on the actual year, and the 1st of Taht anticipated the heliacal rising of Sothis by thirty days. But this had been measured, allow ed for, and ticked o ff by means of the four Sut - Heb festivals celebrated dur ing the Hanti period of 120 years. By this intelligible change in the lengt h of the lifetime the biblical text itself affords indubi table evidence that the lifetimes of the patriarchs were astronom ica l. If the Han - cycle of 120 years was a time - cycle, it is absolutely certain that the previous periods were so likewise, the one being reduc ed from the other by the Hebrew a - gnos tic literalizers. The cutting up of time into smaller por tions or shor ter lengt hs is likewise indi cated in the Chippe wa legend, when the slayer of the giants is described as hacking their bodi es into little bits, and saying to the fragm ents, “In the future let no man be larger than you are now ” ( Nat. Gen., vol . II, p. 240) . This is e qui valent to the lifetime being cut dow n to 120 years. Thus the lifetime of the patriarch, which in round num bers was 1,000 years in the old, was reduc ed to 120 years in the reckoni ng of the new cycle which follow ed the deluge of Noah. The “seven rulers o f the world” manifested one by one at great colossal scale. The age of each, as representatives of the successive 596 pol e - stars, woul d be from three to four thous and years, or one - seventh part of 25, 868 years. The seven, beginning as the Kamite Khut i, a re well - nigh uni versal. The Japanese have seven gods of fortune and givers of good gifts, called the Shi chi Fukujin, who sail each New Year’s Eve as passenge rs on boa rd the ship called The Float ing - Bridge of Heaven, that carries the seven magical treasures , which include the lucky coat, the hat that makes invi sible, the inexha ustible pur se, and other pos session s which are obvi ous ly the prope rty of spirits prom ised condi tiona lly to mortals on the earth. The two groups of Hebrew patriarchs which precede the d eluge , seven and ten in num ber, correspond to the seven and the ten in Babyl oni an legend, who were rulers in the antediluvi an world — that is, in the fore - world of the astronom ical mythol ogy. The seven fish - men, ascendi ng one by one at vast intervals of time from the Nun or deep that was locally represented by the Persian Gulf at Eridu, we look upon as the seven rulers of the ancient pol e - stars taking their stations successively in the circuit of precession, with the fish for their zoot ype . Unque stiona bly the seven fish - men are a form of the seven prediluvi an kings , hence the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"appe arance of the Anne dot i at the same time with the king, the fish as zoot ype being earlier than the title of king. Thus the seven as fish - men, of whos e “appe arances Abyde nus has made no mention, ” were follow ed by the three other rulers named Amom psimus, Otiartes, and Xisuthrus, and “so the sum total of all the kings is ten,” seven of whom had been figur ed as Anne dot i, or divine rulers in the celestial waters, who were afterwards com plete ly hum anized as kings . So in the book of Esdras, the Son of God is seen ascendi ng from the sea to take his stand upon the mount , here called Mount Zion, as the man “whom God the highe st hath kept a great season, ” and who was to regain the fish - type as icht hus “within four hund red years” (2 Esdras, VII and XIII). The seven Assyrian masi are know n to have been stars in different cons tellations , as were the pol e - stars. One was “the star of the eagle,” one “the star of the wain,” one “the star of the shephe rd o f the heavenly flocks,” that might be com pared with the “key of the crow n” as first of the seven pol e - stars in the heptanom is of Sut. Tai Hao, the great celestial, was the first mythical or astronom ical ruler in the Chinese divine dyna sties. With him com m enced the mystic diagrams called the Yi or change s, which were eight in num ber. These were revealed to him by the dragon - hor se that issued from the Yellow river or the Milky Way (Mayers, Manual , 366 , 44, 56). Tai Hao corresponds to Sut, the inve ntor of ast ronom y and ruler of the first pol e - star; the dragon - hor se answers to the water - hor se that was com bined with the crocodi le in Apt, godde ss of the Great Bear and mother of the seven rulers. According to M. Philastre in his version of the Yi king (p. 3), the name of the Chow dyna sty and of the Chow Yi divining - book signi fies circular move ment, the revolution embracing the whol e uni verse. This revol ution, we think, doe s not merely mean that of the starry sphe res, but the move ment of the pol e. Chow Yi woul d then mean the change s of the pol e and pol e - stars in the circle of precession. Thus the Chow dyna sty of the sons of heaven woul d be the seven successive rulers of the pol e, who reigne d for six and twenty thous and years as scientific fact. 597 In the Vision o f Scipio Cicero has preserved som ething of the ancient doc trine conc erning the derivation of soul s from above . The spirit of Africanus tells his son that soul s or spirits were suppl ied to men from the eternal fires, which are cons tellations and stars. Now there are seven soul s, because the elements were seven all told, and seven primary cons tellations , with seven stars for soul s, otherwise called the seven great spirits or seven glorious one s. These became the seven begetters in the creation legend of Cutha — one to each of the seven representative cons tellations in which the elemental pow ers had acqui red their soul s and thus becom e the typi cal transmitters of soul s to hum an beings . Sut, the soul of shade in the hippop otamus; Horus, the soul of light ; Shu, the soul of breath; Hapi, the soul of water — such were the begetters of a soul in totemism. Thus the Ainu are the bears, the Arunt a are the emus, the Zuni are the turtles. They have their totemic zoot ype s on earth, which also imaged the elemental spirits or so uls in heaven that were represented by the cons tellation or the star for thos e who had preserved the primitive wisdom . Thus derivation from the tree and rock, which is mentione d by Hesiod and Hom er, woul d, if astronom ical, be derivation from the pol e; wher eas derivation from the hippopot amus, bear, vul ture, ape, water - bird, jackal, tortoise, or other"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"of the uranogr aphi c type s woul d denot e the par ticular station of the pol e, and be a time - gauge to the beginni ngs according to the racial reckoni ngs in the astr onom ical chronol ogy. For instance, the Khatties of Central Indi a trace their descent from a proge nitor named Khat, who sprang from a staff that he had fashione d from the branch of a tree (Folkard). Descenda nts from a god whos e hauling or tow ing force was r epresented by a rope would naturally be the rope men. And the Spartans claimed to be the rope men, from σ π α ρ τ ογ =rope . As they sprang from the teeth of the dragon sow n by Kadm os, it is pos sible that they dated from the rope man who was ruler of the pole - star i n the dragon from 4,000 B.C. to 1,000 B.C. in round num bers. When Ra calls on thos e who pul l the rope of the solar boa t in Amenta to tow him “tow ards the dw elling of stable things ” and free themselves upon “the mysterious hor izon,” they say to Ra, “The rop e is with Ak”=the pol e - star. The uppe r end of the rope was fastened to the pol e, whilst the bark was being tow ed round the ecliptic. The imagery here doe s but invol ve one rope and one pol e - star at a time; but as the pol e - stars in the cour se of precession w ere seven, there were seven rope s or bonds , all reckone d, and in one character the seven primal pow ers are called the seven Tesu or Tasu. These are the seven who hauled at the rope and who were the makers of the seven ties, bonds , knot s, or fastenings of t he cable to the pol e when the rope was a primitive link of conne ction that preceded Newton’ s law of gravitation; the rope that is carried in the form of a noos e by Shu - Anhu r, who also carries the staff of the pol e with which heaven was upl ifted. The seven Egypt ian Tesu are a kind of seven rope men, who passed into the Babyl oni an mythol ogy as the seven bonds by which the uni verse was bound and held toge ther by the seven lords at the seven stations of the pol e. In the Hindu representation the seven pow ers that hauled round the solar bark by means of the rope have been conve rted finally into the later seven hor ses which draw the chariot of the sun (Moor ’s Hindu 598 Pant heon ). The seven became the first com pany of the gods in the Aarru fields as the rulers of t he seven pol e - stars, who were the formers or creators in the dom ains of space and time. These were the seven great in glory called the Khut i or spirits, represented by beautiful white water - birds, the prototype of Cygnus the swan. The seven Khut i still sur vive in the seven swans of legenda ry lore, more especially in Indi a. The seven Khut i, as white birds on the celestial waters, represented soul s or spirits, but as star - soul s, not hum an soul s, external to hum an beings , and so they became seven soul s as seve n swans in the folk - tales. At every stage of developm ent the tree of mythol ogy has shed the leaves of legend that were blow n about the world as the märchen of many lands . Before the boa t was bui lt the swimmers were water - birds, crocodi les, or hippopot ami. The mode of thinki ng coul d not have been otherwise. When Anup as eight h was adde d as the pow er above the pol e, and therefore the supr eme one in the character of the great judge , the gods of the seven pol e - stars were figur ed as “the seven arms of the balan ce” in the maat of eternal law and justice. When the boa t was bui lt and Anup became the master ove r the waters, the com pany of seven were placed pictorially on boa rd the bark of the Lesser Bear as figur es of the never - setting one s that were safe for ever f rom the waters of the deluge . The seven now were typi cal eternals in two categor ies of astronom ical"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"phe nom ena. They were stationa ry in the circle of the seven ancient pol e - stars, and seven as row ers, boa tmen, or kabiri groupe d in the bark revol ving round t he pivot of the pol e. This was in the stellar mythos . When luna r time had been made out by Taht the measurer, the typi cal seven were adva nced in status. These are his assistants as the seven Taasu, the sages or wise masters. They appe ar on boa rd the bark i n the shape of seven hawks called the offspring of heaven. The bird of air had then succeeded the water - bird as the type of the seven soul s on boa rd the bark in the luna r mythos. In the solar mythos the seven are pygm ies or patakoi , the little sailors on b oard the bark with Ptah. Martianus Capella tells us the Egypt ians painted on their ships the seven pilots who were all alike and brothers, who are no doub t identical with the seven pygm y - patakoi or kabiri of Ptah. These were represented in the boa t of Anup that voya ged roun d the pol e as the seven rulers that were thus groupe d toge ther as a picture of the stars that never set. Sydi k the just and the seven called his sons are the Phœ nician form of Anup the judge and the seven khut i. The seven were not navigat ors as the seven hawks, jackals, apes, giants, planters of the tree, or bui lders of the mound. Navigation began with the boa t or ark, and the seven in the Lesser Bear, with Anup or Sydi k, head ove r all, as an eighth to the seven. In one character the seven stars were regarded as watchers watching solemnly aloof . A non - setting star was imaged as a never - closing eye. In the Ainu legend of the god upon the sum mit, the watchers, who are the 6+ 1, are hares, and the hare was reput ed to be so watchful that it slep t with its eyes ope n. In Babyl oni a the deluge - makers are the seven with the ancient Genetrix, who is called “the mother of the seven gods ,” the seven that “heaped up the seat” or 599 bui lt the mounds which were ove rthrow n, as fabled, by the deluge . Astro nom ically these were the gods of the seven pol e - stars whos e seats were in the never - setting stars around the throne of Anu. Thus , and in no other way, the seven pow ers caused the deluge , and then ascende d to their seats in the heaven of Anu and assum ed the ir throne s on high as rulers in the realm of eternity. The seven survivor s are exactly the same in the astronom ical mythos as if they had made their escape from drow ning in a boa t, like the seven hohga tes or kabiri, or any other group of the seven com panio ns. But the boa t or ship is here employe d for the use of the hum an survivor s who are suppos ed to have been carried away on boa rd the bark of Hasisadra “to be like the gods ” — that is, as manes and not as mortals. The seven who are charged with causing the de luge in Babyl oni an legend – Bel, Ea, Rimmon, Nebo, Marduk , Ninib, and Nerra – may be com pared with the Egypt ian seven — Sut, Sebek, Shu, Hapi, Tuamutef, Kabhs enuf , and Amsta. The tradition of the seven founde rs of the heaven that was based upon the water went f orth to the ends of the earth. They were seven children of the old Great Mother, seven brothers or com panions when the social status was totemic and the fatherhood was not yet indi vidua lised. In Egypt they are “the seven children of the thigh” — the sign by which we can identify the ancient Genetrix with the birthpl ace of beginni ng astronom ically in the circle of the Bear and the constellation called the Meskhe n, or “the thigh. ” These are the seven brethren called “seven kings ,” who appe ar as “begetters” in t he Cuthean legend. That is as begetters in group - marriage, who were the totemic fathers that preceded the father as a know n indi vidua l.

They were born as seven sons of the Great Mother, and were her boys when she was “a mither but na wife.” No matter in what part of the world we discove r this tradition of the se ven founde rs and seven stations of the pol e, it invol ves at least one bygone Great Year in the circle of precession inde pende ntly of where the astronom ical mythol ogy originated. In the later stage of the eschatology, when Osiris was supr eme as god ove r the pol e, and all other pow ers had becom e his pow ers (Rit., ch. 7), there are seven arits or mansions in the great hous e of the eternal city. The seven watchers, of the astral mythos , dw ell in these; the seven who are called the khus , the divine princes; the seven glorious one s who stand behind Osiris, and who are called the makers of the seven mansions for the god (chs. 17, 83 - 107, and 144) . Before Osiris was, these were the seven lords of law, of right, of truth, and justice: otherwise stated, the seven lord s of maat (judge s), the seven arms of the balance (executione rs), the seven eyes (watchers), the seven pillars (suppor ts); and as they were also the makers of the seven arits, they are likewise the seven mythical bui lders of the heptanom is; the seven pow er s that 600 can be follow ed as the seven with Anup, with Taht, with Ptah, with Horus, and with Ra, according to the series of phe nom ena. It is now propos ed to trace and tentatively localize the seven (or a seven ) stations of the pol e on which the heptano mis was founde d in the circuit of precession. In the circle of precessiona l move ment drawn by Piazzi Smythe, he has filled in onl y six out of seven stations of the pol e — one in the Dragon , one in the Lesser Bear, one in Kephe us,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" one in Cygnus , one in Lyra, and one in Herakles, or the Man. It is here we have to recons titute and fill in a cons tellation as a first one of the seven. Various legends lead us to think that there was an ancient pol e - star in “Corona Borealis,” or the nor t hern crow n. A crow n is a sym bol of the highe st, which at the pole woul d be the highe st poi nt. Then the star Alpha in this cons tellation is called “Clava Corona, ” the key of the crow n; and a key - star at the crow ning poi nt is, to say 601 "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"the least, equi val ent to the key - stone of an arch. Moreove r, “the crow n of heaven” was an Assyrian title of the pol e - star, which tends to identify the pol e - star with a cons tellation called the crow n of the northern heaven. Appa rently the pol e and crow n are also conne cted by an Akka dian expr ession conc erning “the Bear making its crow nship” in its revol ution round the pol e - star. The crow n of heaven, how ever, was by no means limited to a singl e pol e - star, although it may have originated as the crow ning - poi nt at the pivot of the pol e. The seven pol e - stars in their circle formed a crow n for the supr eme being, of whom it is said his diadem predom inates at the zenith of the starry heaven. This was his crow n upon the sum mit of the stellar mount of glory (Rit., ch. 133) . The seven po le - stars themselves did not form one cons tellation, but the crow n woul d be figured typi cally as a group of stars that told the story in the custom ary way, even as we find it in Corona Borealis. Moreove r, to the naked eye the cons tellation of the Crow n, con sisting of seven large stars, woul d present a picture of the other seven — the crow n of stars upon the sum mit of the mount which is so prom inent in the eschatology. It is said in the Ritual, “Here is the cycle of the gods (as the seven glorious one s), and th e vul tures (or kite) of Osiris” (ch. 136 B ). This is where the balance was then erected at the place of judgm ent in the circum pol ar maat, and also at the poi nt where the crow n of life was conf erred upon the spirits perfected at the sum mit of the mount . It i s also said of the glorified elect, “He follow eth Shu and calleth for the crow n. He arriveth at the Aged One on the conf ines of the moun t of glory where the crow n awaiteth him” (ch. 131 ). This is the eternal crow n in the eschatology which had its origin in the seven never - setting stars of the mythology. In the Kabalah it is the crow n of crow ns pertaining to the Aged in which he had incised the forms and figur es of the primordial kings who reigne d aforetime in the land of Edom , but who coul d not preserve the mselves and cons eque ntly passed away, “one after the other” (Ginsbur g, The Kabal ah, 21) . The pol e and crow n are certainly associated in the May - pol e with its framework of flow ers always shaped in the likeness of a crow n at the sum mit of the tree or pol e. W ithout being able at present to prove it, we sugge st that a key - stone , or key - star, to the arch or coni cal mount of heaven was first laid in the heptanom is as primary pole - star of the seven which formed the circle of the crow n; that a figure of the crow n w as cons tellated in the som ewhat circular group of Corona Borealis, and that the key to the mystery may at last be found in the star represented by name as Clava Coronæ . Now , if we take the island, for example, as the type of a station or place of landi ng, there was a subs idence of the land in the celestial waters, or, in sign - langua ge, there was a deluge at each declination of the pol e - star. Otherwise expr essed, one of the seven mount ains was subm erged, one of the seven provi nces or patalas was drow ned, on e of the seven pol e - stars fell, or one of the seven rulers was dethrone d in heaven. The earliest station of the pol e may be assigne d to Sut as the hippopot amus, or as bui lder of the mound; the crow n woul d be a later figur e of the highe st pos ition. There wa s a cons tellation of the hippopo tamus as male, to match the mother in the Greater Bear; this was a zoot ype of Sut, her first - bor n son, how ever difficult it is at 602 present to define the group of stars — that is, to distingui sh the male hippopot amus from Draconi s, which, by the bye , were two zoot ype s of Sut and Horus, the twin brothers."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Though now uns een on the celestial globe , it is certain that there was a male hippopot amus among the circum pol ar cons tellations, and this, as bul l of the mother, represente d Sut, the son of Apt, the water - cow (see “Calenda r of Astrl.

As Japanese Buddhi st myth, the island of Japan might be localized astronom ically by means of a legend in which it is related that an Apsaras appe ared in the clouds ove r a spot that was inha bited by a dragon. An island suddenly rose up from the sea. The Apsaras descende d on the island and was wedde d to the dragon , which may be interpreted as a folk - tale of the time when the island of the pol e was in the cons tellation Draco.

The dragon that falls from heav en in the book of Revelation and goe th into perdition is said to be one of the seven who are imaged as seven kings , seven heads, seven hor ns, seven mountains, seven islands , seven lamp - stands , seven stars, seven eyes, or seven ruling powers. The myth of l ost Atlantis is Egyp tian. This was told to Solon by Egypt ian priests, and afterwards retold by Plato in Timaeus. It cont ains the story of two heavens that were sunke n in the waters of the deluge . The first was in seven, the latest in ten divisions ; the hea ven of the ten lost tribes, ten sons of Jacob, the ten patriarchs, and the ten Assyrian pre - diluvi an kings . There is no deluge - legend of twelve islands that were lost or sunke n in the sea, because the heaven in twelve divisions , based on the solar zodi ac o f twelve signs , was never sunk nor supe rseded. This has not passed away to leave the subj ect matter for the mythos . But there is a dragon with twelve heads to be met with in folk - lore who evidently images the solar god in the final heaven in ten nom es. In the Hunga rian folk - tale of Eisen Laezi, the hero is identical in character with Bata in the “Tale of the Two Brothers,” and the wife of the twelve - headed dragon - king is one with the false accuser in the Egypt ian story, and with Potipha r’s wife in the Hebre w version.

Also, as the law was given at the pol e or the tree, there woul d be seven trees of the law established in the cour se of Precession. Finally the cel estial trees were twelve in num ber when the zodi ac of twelve signs had been established. (2 Esdras, II, 18). The seven trees that stood around the moun t of the pol e are met with in a Chinese legend. Tradition says they grew upon the slope s of the Kun - Lin m ount ains; and one of them, which conf erred the fruit of immortality, was a tree of jade, the imperishable stone that was a type of the eternal ( Baby loni an and Oriental Record, June , 1888) . Seven woul d be the num ber in precession which were afterwards unifi ed in the tree of seven branches. Other circles, other numbers. Seven trees woul d form the sacred grove or asherah - tree which is surmount ed by the seven serpent hoods conve ntiona lized on the Chaldean cylinde rs as co - type of the seven branches (D’Aviella, M igration of Symbol s, figs. 63, 64, 79, etc.). It is proba ble that the tree of the pole - star was know n in Egypt as the kha bsu tree, or tree of the star, signi fying the pol e. Renouf says that kha bsu is the name of a tree held sacred in various places in Egyp t; and according to one reading (Rit., ch. 133) , the tree of paradise that breathed the refreshing air of the nor th were kha bsu trees. If so, these were seven in num ber, like all other type s of the heptanom is, or the stations of the pol e. There is a group of the kha bsu gods who were a form of the seven great spirits, on the moun t of glory and who receive the ascendi ng spirits of the just made perfect at the summit of the hill. They are identified by name as the gods of the lamp or the light , which were seve n in num ber in the circum pol ar heaven, equi valent to the seven lamp - stands or seven - branched candl estick upon the mount ain in the book of Revelation. The seven isles of the blessed were also know n as seven forms of the oasis. The lords of Thinis and Abydo s bore the title of masters of the oasis (Brugs ch). Thus the ruler of the pol e - star woul d be the lord of an oasis, or later paradise. The altar - mound was also an image of the pol e. And periodi cally the Mexicans sacrificed seven batches of children on seven hills that served for altars. The Hebrews offered seven bul ls and seven rams on seven altars. The Assyrian Lu - Masi were proba bly represented by seven rams of sacrifice. Blood was sprinkl ed seven times as an oblation. Wherefore seven times?

The seven altars are also identified by Hom er with the pol e when he calls the ark - city of Mycenæ “the altars of the cyclops .” Cyclops were one with the giants, which are seven in num ber, and thus the altars of the cyclops are equi valent to the seven mount ain - altars of the Phœ nicians and the Mexicans, groupe d in the seven - por tione d city of the ark at Mycenæ .

Seven sacred black stone s, pos sibly aërolites, were the images of the seven chief gods at Uruk, the great one s or the might ies (Conde r, Heth and Moab, pp. 209 , 210) . Herodo tus speaks of the seven stone s which the Arabians smeared with bloo d in making a cove nant (B. 3, 8.) Naturally, the stone , as the rock of eternity, remained a permanent figur e of the pol e, and doubt less seven precious stone s were among the type s. Hence we meet with the emerald mount ain, the diamond mount ain, the pearl mou ntain, the mount ain of gol d, the lotus mount ain, with the jewel of the pol e - star at the centre or “in the lotus.” The Mexicans also worshippe d a class of gods who had been turned into stone . Three of these are mentione d by name as Tohi l, Avilix, and Hacav itz. And it is said of these petrified pow ers that they coul d resum e a movable shape when they pleased. These gods were three in the group of seven which is so often divided into two groups of three and four each, and which are the seven rulers of the pol e . Becom ing petrified as stone s woul d denot e the condi tion in which they stood as fixed figures of the pol e, and if they were figur es of the pol e it was know n to the astronom ers that all in turn woul d again resum e a move able shape as gods of the pole - stars. The seven stone s set up at Stone henge and elsewhere represent the giants that were also petrified and change d into enor mous stone s. These, too, stood for the seven stations of the pol e in the circuit of precession, or the circle of Sidi. Unde r one title “ Stone henge ” was called the circle of Sidi, or the circle of seven. These are a form of the seven giants that were turned into stone , thos e who were the bui lders of the heptanom is and the suppor ters of the uni verse, and whos e megalithic monum ents are found as witnesses in many lands . The seven stations sank with the heptanom is of Atlantis in the great deluge of all, but the stone s remained as monum ents called the “stone s of the deluge ,” and four of the seven pow ers survived in the new heaven that was raised upon the four - fold founda tion of the celestial tetrapol is which follow ed. The Rom an palladium that fell from heaven has its origin, not simply as an aërolite, but as a copy of the stone that was a type of the divine abode established at the pal, or pol e. P alladia in various other shapes are said by Phyl arcos to have been flung dow n from heaven dur ing the war of the giants. These cons tituted the typi cal founda tions of the heptanom is that was bui lt on high and repeated by the mound bui lders of many lands and copi ed by thos e who heaped the earth or raised the stone and shaped the pillar as the palladia of the dead. The capital of Maha - Bali or Great Baal, onc e famous on the coast of Malabar as Maha - Bali - pur am, had a name which signi fied “the seven pagoda s.” Thes e are anot her equi valent to the seven arits, churches, or other groups of seven sacred structures that imaged the heptanom is according to the period and the cult. The pol e of heaven, as an image of sustaining pow er, was also figur ed in the cons tellation of Uarit, the leg. This at one time was the leg of Nut, the cow of heaven. At anot her it is the leg of Ptah, at anot her the leg of Osiris. As the leg of Nut, it is the leg of a cow , which may be seen in the drawing from the zodi ac of Dende rah (fig. on p. 311 ) in which the 605 milch cow and leg are blende d toge ther in one figure. This suppor ting pow er of the pol e was represented by King Hop, “lord of the heavenly hos ts” in an annua l ceremony of the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Siamese dur ing which the lord of the heavenly hos ts, as the pow er of the pol e, stood on one foot for three hour s. If he let dow n his foot it betoke ned instability to the throne , but if he stood firm he was thought to gain a victory over the forces of evil (Frazer, Golden Bough, vol. I, p. 230) . Many mysteries that were mythical or eschatologi cal when first acted peter out finally in popul ar pastimes and provincial games. The writer has collected a vol um e of such, but will not be able to find room for them. The game of hop - scotch is a good example of the pow er that c oul d stand upon one foot as that of the pol e in the heaven of seven divisions . It has been sugge sted that the seven cour ts which are chalked out on the ground in this game represent the seven planetary heavens. But this expl anation was put forward by a wri ter entirely ignor ant of the celestial heptanom is and the seven heavens or astronom es that were preplanetary (paper read at the Anthropol ogi cal Institute, Nov. , 1885 ). The seven cour ts thus memorized we hol d to be the seven cour ts which are identified with the seven divisions of heaven and seven stations of the pol e. The que stion, if any, can be determined by the sym bol ical act of hoppi ng on one foot . The seven foot prints of Budd ha also denot e the seven steps in precession which are a co - type equi valent to the seven stations of the pol e. The writer know s of no group of seven legs, or feet, but there is a giant who strides through space as the wearer of seven - league boot s. Moreove r, the Ritual pos itively identifies the pol e with the leg by calling it the leg of the seven non - setting stars. Now the pol e - star being a star that did not set, in the cour se of the great year there woul d be seven of these that never set: the seven who are the lords of eternity. These were beyond the ken of ordinary know ledge , but an obj ect - picture coul d be cons tellated, as in the seven stars of the Lesser Bear. Dhruva is the Hindu name of a pol e - star; it is also the name of the pow er divinized in Dhruva , the god, who maintained himself upon one foot motionl ess as a stake=pol e, unt il the earth inclined with his weight , or the station of the pol e leaned ove r and sank dow n with the declination of the star that was Polaris at the time. Thus the sustainer at the pol e as a pow er was able to stand on one foot for the period of 3,714 years on end ( Bhâgav ata - Purana, ch. VIII). There are seven mount ain peaks and seven foot prints, and a foot print on the peak is the sym bol of a station in precession. Thus the foot print of Buddha upon Adam’s Peak in Ceylon tends to show that this was one of the sev en annul ar mount ains in the seven - fold system of Mount Meru. Also, when the Buddhi st footprint is represented by the sacred hor seshoe it has in one form seven gems or nails, which still preserve a figure of the seven prints on one image. Seven foot prints w ere assigne d to Abraham. These are depicted on the sout h side of the Sakhr ah rock at Jerusalem, and were show n to Nasir - i - Khus ran in the year A.D. 1047 . (Pal. Pilgrim’s Text Society, p. 47, 1888) . 606 The sun, moon , and seven stars are freque ntly groupe d toge ther on the Assyrian monum ents. The Chinese call the sun, moon , and seven stars the nine light s of heaven. The same groupi ng is obs ervable in the nine pyramids of the Mexicans — one for the sun, one for the moon , and seven small one s for the seven star s. The three pyr amids of Gizeh answer to thos e of the sun, moon , and seven stars elsewhere. The Great Pyramid is in itself a sign of seven, com prising, as it doe s, the square and the triangl e in one figure. There is a tradition that the Great Pyramid was d esigne d by the Har - seshu, or servants of"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Horus. These were the seven Khut i in the stellar mythol ogy who had been the rulers in the celestial heptanom is before they became the seven servants of the solar god. The seven periods of the pol e - stars were also im aged by seven eyes, in cons eque nce of an eye being a figure of the cycle. This type is presented to Joshua in the book of Zechariah in the shape of seven eyes upon one stone : “Behol d, the stone that I have set before Joshua ; upon one stone are seven eyes.” These are the seven eyes of the Lord; also the seven lamps, the same as in the book of Revelation (Zech. III. 9; IV. 1 - 12). As a mode of measuring time and period on the colossal scale of the great year, the eye came to the full, “as at first,” seven time s at seven stations of the pol e in the cycle of precession. As a type , the eye might be full onc e a mont h, onc e a quarter, onc e a year, onc e in a thous and years, in 2,155 years, 3,714 years, or, as the great eye of all, the eye of the Eternal, onc e in 26, 0 00 years (Rit., chs. 140 and 144) . Hence the seven eyes of the Lord in the blue stone of the firmament. The subm ergence of seven pol e - stars invol ved the same num ber of deluge s in the cycle of precession, which culminated in “the great deluge of all.” Appa r ently this was the deluge of Manu in the Hindu version, for the Manu, whos e vessel was made fast to a stupe ndous hor n, i.e., the pole, was Vaivasvata, the seventh Manu, and the seventh Manu corresponds to the great deluge of all, as the latest of seven cat aclysms in the world’s great year. There were seven stations to the pol e in measuring the circuit of precession; cons eque ntly each type or sym bol of the pol e may be repeated seven times, or is finally a figur e of the num ber seven. Thus the pole, when eleva ted seven times as a tree, woul d be represented ultimately by the typi cal seven trees, or by a tree with seven branches; if by the mound, the mound woul d be erected seven times ove r; if by the hor n, there woul d be seven hor ns — hence the dragon with seven ho rns; if by the fish, there woul d be seven fish or fish - men, finally sym bol ized by the fish with seven fins, or by the crocodi le Sebek, whos e name as Sevekh also signi fied the num ber seven. If by the star, as Stella Polaris, this woul d be repeated seven tim es and groupe d as the seven stars of a typi cal cons tellation at the pol e, like that of Ursa Minor or Corona Borealis. If the eye be a figur e of the pol e - star as direct image or as emblem of the repeating cycle fulfilled in 3,700 years, there will be seven eyes=seven stars or seven light s in the circle of precession. Seven eyes becom e the seven watchers, jackals, judge s, urshi, or rishis; and seven light s on one stand, or a candl estick with seven branches, forms an image of the seven singl e pol e - stars in a c luster at the pol e. If the figur e is a cave, there woul d be seven caves to the mount ; if it was a hall, there would be seven 607 halls in the great hous e; if a chur ch, there woul d be seven chur ches; if a city, there woul d be seven cities. Other type s mig ht be enum erated in relation to the mystery of the seven stars. The great deluge of all was that by which the total heptanom is was finally subm erged; “every island fled away, and the (seven) mount ains were not found” (Rev. XVI. 20, 21). In this the giants, the dogs , the apes, the birds, the tortoises or turtles, and the “men” were drow ned, and lost Atlantis sank beneath the waters at first as the heptanom is, and later as the heaven in ten which was succeeded by the heaven in twelve divisions . The seven sta tions of the pole were likewise marked as seven mounds or seven mount ains, each of which in turn was a type of the birthpl ace on high and an image of the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Great Mother who brought forth her child upon the mount as the hippopot amus, the crocodi le, the serpen t, the vul ture, the water - bird, or other type that was astronom ical in heaven and totemic on the earth. One title of the Great Mother was “mistress of the mount ain” when the mount ain was the pol e, and this celestial mount ain was repeated seven times in the circle of precession; hence there are seven sum mits in one form or other, as mount ains, mounds , altars, stone s, menhi rs, pillars, or pyramids, answering to the seven stations of the pol e. There is an allusion to the seven stellar sum mits or mount ains in o ne of the Assyrian hym ns. Ishtar exalts her glory in several pha ses of phe nom ena. Hers was the glory from the beginni ng. She was the godde ss of the doub le hor izon, imaged in the glory of the morning and evening stars. As que en of heaven in the moon, her gl ory is said to “glow in the clouds of heaven” and to “sweep away (or efface) the mount ains altoge ther,” as the flood of moonl ight might put out the stars. These mount ains, therefore, were celestial; onl y as such coul d mount ains be obl iterated by the glory of the godde ss imaging the moon. The Japanese have the group of seven mount ains, which were the seats of the gods of seven pol e - stars. These are Ma - Saka - Yama, Odo Yama, Oku Yama, Kura Yama, Ha Yama, Hara Yama, and To Yama ( Kojiki, II, 7, 8; O’Neil, Night of the Gods , vol . II, p. 892) . “These,” says O’Neil, “seem to be alternative mythical names for the heaven’s - vault mount ain.” But as a figure of the heptanom is the mount of heaven’s vault was also seven - fold in seven stations of the shifting pole, determin ed by the seven successive stars, one for each of the seven mount ain sum mits. At the back of Shan - ling, about sixty miles west of Canton, seven isolated limestone peaks abrupt ly rise up from the low green plain. These are called The Seven Stars. They were onc e a favour ite resort for pious peopl e, who went there to worship at the temples and the caves (Colquhoun, A. R., Across Chrysê, I, 37) . These also we look upon as monum ents of the seven ancient pol e - stars, which are identified with seven mount ains in th e books of Enoc h and of Revelation. There were seven mount ains upon which the ark of safety rested as the place of landi ng from the waters dur ing the vast cycle of precession; this may expl ain the Armenian tradition that Noah’s ark was visible at various t imes, first upon one mount ain peak, then upon anot her, includi ng Mount Baris, Urdhu , Gudi , Nizir, and Ararat. Proba bly there were seven altoge ther 608 identified, like the seven Alban Hills, with the seven rulers of the world in their watchtow ers of the celestial heptanom is. The mount, or a moun t of the pol e, was know n as the white mount ain. The Alban Hills are the white mount ains. They are seven in num ber, and equi valent to the seven stations of the pol e which were imaged by the seven mount ains of the he ptanom is. The Chréais or Jaray race, who inha bit the high plateau which separates Cambodi a from Anna m, preserve a curious com memorative custom in relation to the seven mount ains. They have two mysterious mona rchs, whos e func tions are of that mystical order which we so often find to be astronom ical. The two are know n as the king of fire and the king of water. They inha bit successively seven tow ers bui lt upon seven mount ains, and every year they pass from one tow er to anot her, never meeting each other and nev er seeing a hum an face. The kings hip lasts for seven years, and the offices are hereditary in one or two families (Frazer, Golden Bough, vol . I, pp."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"55 - 56, who cites Le Royaum e du Cam bodge , by J. Mour a; also Aym oni er’s Notes ). Seven forts erected on seven mount ains are equi valent to the seven altars raised on seven mount ains by the Mexicans. The two kings of fire and water correspond to the two different cataclysms by fire and flood, described by Berosos as happe ning in the cour se of the Great Year. Accord ing to the missiona ry Gill, the Manga ians hol d that the seven inha bited islands of the Hervey group are the body or outward presentment of anot her seven in the spirit - world of Avaiki ( Myths and Songs of the Pacific ). These correspond to the seven sunke n is lands of the lost Atlantis, and bot h are a localized earthly form of the celestial heptanom is, which sank dow n in the cour se of one Great Year. The name of Manga ia signi fies peace, and Manga ia in Avaiki was the paradise of peace, like the Egypt ian Hetep. T his, therefore, was a form of the paradise lost in the form of seven islands sunk in the Pacific as well as in the Atlantic Ocean and other waters, which were firmamental from the first. Egypt began in the form of seven Nui, a most ancient Egypt ian name fo r the nom es or water bounda ries. And in Polyne sia Nui or Rapa - nui is the native name of Easter Island, where the colossal statues left by some mysterious race of primitive bui lders have been found . Nui is also the name of a group of the Nui as islands =nom e s, which are found as seven in num ber in the seven islands or islets of Onoa toa. Each one of these has its ow n particular name, but Onoa toa embraces the whol e seven. The seven Nui as islands in a group called Onoa toa offer a parallel to the seven islands o f Avaiki, with the addi tiona l fact that they have the same name as the most ancient nom es of Egypt , which were seven in num ber. After the septenary of pol e - stars had been identified and established in the circle of precession, six of these were ever movi n g with the sphe re, and there was always one remaining a fixture at the centre. If we take them as representatives of the seven Manus or Buddha s, it becom es evident that the condi tion of the motionl ess or sleeping Buddha was attainable by all the six, each in turn, that moved round the stationa ry one ; and in the seventh stage of precession the true Buddha , the prince, the Rishi or Manu, was re - bor n, and his birth was indi cated by the stationa ry star that show ed the new pos ition of 609 the changi ng pol e. In his visions Enoc h sees the “seven splendi d mount ains which were all different from each other.” These are described as six, with “the seventh mount ain in the midst of them.” In furnishing the ark of testimony according to the pat tern seen in the mount , in structions are given for the lamp - stand to be made with six branches goi ng out of the candl estick. But it is adde d, “Thou shalt make the lamps thereof seven” (Ex. XXV. 37) ; this, then, was likewise a figur e of six encircling the one that was a fixture in t he centre. The six stars that kept revol ving whilst the seventh stood or rested on one foot are to be met with in a legend of the Ainu. “Sudde nly there was a large hous e on the top of a hill wherein were six persons beautifully arrayed, but cons tantly qua r relling (always in motion) . Thereupon Okikur um i (a name conne cted with the wheel) seized a firebrand and beat each of the six with it in turn. Whereupon the six all ran away in the shape of hares” (B. H. Chamberlain, Memoirs of Tôkyô University, p. 32) . I t is stated in the Chow Ritual that the Chinese rules for divining were cont ained in three books — the Lien - shan, the Kwei - Tsang, and the Kwei - chang. The name of the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"first signi fies “United Mount ains,” a title that is said to have been derived from its first mystical and divining six - fold sign K ă n (O’Neil, The Night of the Gods , vol . II, p. 892) . These uni ted mount ains, determined, as stated, by the six - fold sign, appe ar to be a form of the six which, with the seventh at the centre, marked the seven stations of the pol e in the circle of precession. The Zuni Indi an system of the seven mount ains is the same. These cons ist of six mount ains which are statione d round the central one . When Remus saw the flight of the six vul tures he was standi ng on the rock of the A ventine Hill — that is, the Bird - hill, which looks as if it represented the seventh to the six stars; the one that was stationa ry on the pivot of the pol e, whilst the other six were moving round it with the sphe re. Thus there is a central mount ain and a cent ral land to the seven mount ains. One of the seven uni ted mount ains is the tree - mount ain. Elsewhere we meet with the stone - mount ain, the mount of the papyr us reed, the ever - white mount ain whence the Korean peopl e came, the mount of the white wall, the pearl mount ain. The mount of Saturn= Sebek, in the Dragon , was one of the seven hills in Rom e. A “festival of the six” is made mention of in the Ritual (ch. 136 , Pap. Of Nu). This occurs in a chapter for making a spirit perfect, which memorizes the birth of a go d who is called the newly - bor n, as the lamp in Annu at the pol e. He is described as a god of the rope . It is said, “He is bor n, he of the strong cord. His cable is com plete” (ch. 136 , Renouf ). This we unde rstand to be a god of the rope that was made fast a t one end to the solar boa t and at the other to the star Ak at the pol e. The lum inaries in Annu are addr essed. They are the seven Khus . One of these seven is newly - bor n, or his star is just light ed, as god of the lamp and likewise of the rope , and the even t is celebrated at “the festival of the six” — not of the sixth. Moreove r, he is called “the Prince of the inunda tion. ” There had been a deluge , and he has turned back the water - flood which had risen ove r the thigh of Nut at the staircase of Seb, god of the earth. This figur e of the one at the centre of the six will enable us to 610 expl ain a mystery of the cyclops . These in one version of the mythos were seven in num ber, therefore they are a form of the seven giants or pow ers of the pole - stars — the seven t hat were 6+ 1. Now , it was fabled that all the seven coul d see with one singl e eye, and the singl e eye we take to have been the pol e - star for the time being that was fixed at the centre as the eye of the group. The mythical unicorn was anot her figur e of the hor n - poi nt at the pol e. As such it was a type of Sut, the founde r of the pol e. Sut being first as founde r, his was the singl e hor n. It was as the sym bol of sustaining pow er statione d at the pol e that the unicorn became a suppor ter with the lion of the roy al arms in British heraldry. The uni corn has but one eye, and thus it became a co - type with the cyclop as a figur e of the one star of the pol e. The uni corn is associated with the tree, because the tree also stands for the pol e. Som etimes its singl e hor n is stuck fast in the tree, which pos ition intensifies the figur e of stability at the pol e. Futile attempts have been made to show that the uni corn was an emblem of the moon . But thou gh the luna r orb might be imaged as a singl e eye, it woul d not , coul d not , b e represented by a singl e hor n. The ancients kne w the moon was doubl e - hor ned when it was figur ed as the celestial cow . The hor n is anot her of thos e figur es which, being singl e at first, became seven - fold as type s of the heptanom is. Thus there is a group of seven hor ns to add to the rest. This group is"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"por trayed above the head of Sesheta, a godde ss of laying the founda tions , which are seven in num ber, as figur ed by means of her seven hor ns upon a pol e. In the heaven of the heptanom is the ancient Genetrix ha d seven sons . The figur e is repeated in the seven sons of Japhe th (Gen. ch. X), the seven sons of the divine lady of the hol y mound in Babyl oni a, the seven sons of Quanw on in Japan, the seven sons of Albion, the white land in the north, and various other g roups of the seven on boa rd the ark, which was earlier than the founda tions that were laid in the four qua rters. The heptanom is came to an end with the great deluge of all; and in the book of Genesis the deluge of Noah is follow ed by the new kingdom that w as reared on a four - fold founda tion, the seven cities on the other side of the flood being succeeded by the cities of the four qua rters bui lt on this. When Nimrod or Gilgames became “a might y one in the earth” “the beginni ng of his kingdom was Babel and Er eck and Akka d and Kalneh, in the land of Shinar,” and out of that land he went forth and bui lt four other cities in Assyria. A heaven of the four qua rters had then supe rseded the heptanom is or heaven founde d on the seven stars or astronom es, and this was t he figur e follow ed in the building of the four cities on earth. After the great deluge of all had taken place and the inha bitants of the heptanom is generally were drow ned, it was seen that the seven pol e - stars kept their places in the circum pol ar heaven. And thus the seven gods sat in their circle round the tree of the pol e, the fixed and never - setting stars for ever safe from all the deluge s of time, as the seven lords of eternity. These are the seven that were saved when all the world was drow ned. The Sh enin in the Ritual are a group of spirits that surround the seat of the highe st. The name denot es the circle of thos e ministers or officials that surround the 611 throne of the god or the king. In one text this circle is called the shenin of fire. They a re the spirits of fire=the saluting apes in the circle of the eternals. Their num ber is not directly given, but they are the princes who elsewhere are a form of the seven great spirits that surround the throne . Now , there is a stellar enclosure or circle o f stars in the northern heaven which the Chinese recogni ze in the region of Draco and Ursa Major. These bear the names of ministers and officers who surround the sove reign, and therefore are identical with the Egypt ian circle of the shenin. This is very pr oba bly the cons tellation of the Northern Crow n, in which the seven were grouped as a num erical figur e of the pole - star circle. The circle of the seven lords of eternity was first; the throne of the highe st was erected in the centre. Thus the seven as serva nts (seshu) , khut i, uræus - gods , saluting apes or ange ls, spirits, or lamps of fire, are depicted round the throne of God according to the mystery of the seven stars in Revelation. As already said, the earliest form of an enclosure in heaven called the Aar ru is depicted as a field of reeds, the habitat of the water - cow , who brought forth Sut, her first - bor n bul l, upon the sum mit in a field of reeds that rose above the waters at the station of the pol e when this was represented by the bed of reeds. Thus the ancestral pair that were saved from the deluge by climbing up the reed - mount ain, like the Navajo Indians, woul d derive their origin from the reed. The main signi ficance of the reed as a sym bol of the pol e depends upon its being a plant that grow s up throug h the water and flow ers above the surface to present the type of an ark or station or other means of escape from the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"mythical water that flow ed betwixt this world and the other. We have now to sugge st that the seven stars of the rulers were neither in the Great Bear nor the Pleiades, but that they were the past representatives of Polaris in the cycle of precession, and to show that the mystery of the seven stars in the drama of “revelation” was a mystery of the celestial heptanom is in the astronom ical mytho logy. As we have seen, in various myths the land enclosed in the celestial sea was lost because the wom an betrayed the secret of the waters, which then burst forth and ove rthrew the bulwarks that had been erected by the male, who in the Egypt ian mythos was her son, the founde r Sut. In other legends paradise was lost by the unw atchful dog. This, as the jackal, was the dog of Sut. Thus in one case the deluge was let in by the mother, and in anot her by the son, who were the primal pair as founde rs of the pol e. Whilst in som e parts of the world it was the dog (as typi cal gui de) who let in the deluge , in Fiji it was the race of men that had tails like dogs who were destroye d by the deluge . In other legends manki nd were change d into dogs after one of the several d eluge s. The Bona ks or root - digge rs said the first Indi ans that ever lived were coyot es or prairie - dogs . The Chichimecs of Sout h America are the dogs by name. In Africa these woul d have been totemic jackals. But without goi ng back so far in time and space a s the subm ergence of the sout hern pol e and the declination and disappe arance of its star below the horizon for thos e who travelled northw ard, there is anot her origin pos sible for the legend of the dog. The jackal or Egypt ian dog was also cons tellated as th e gui de of ways in Sothis, and as 612 Stella Polaris at the nor thern pol e. As the planisphe re of Dende rah show s, the dog’ s tail in which the pol e - star Cynos ura shines to - day was the tail of the jackal. Twenty - six thous and years ago the pos ition was the s ame. The jackal of the mythos or dog of later legend was then the watcher in the circum polar paradise or garden of the Tree. Now , whichever zoot ype represented the pol e - star of the period – hippopot amus, jackal, ape, bird, tortoise, or dragon (crocodi le) – it might be held respons ible for the loss of paradise or enclosure through letting in the waters. This would be rende red according to the mythical mode , and afterwards related in a legend or a folk - tale. In the precessiona l move ment the celestial pol e passed out of the jackal or dog into the group of stars now called Kephe us. There were seven stations in the circle of precession, though one , as we have said, is om itted or uni dentified in the diagram drawn by Piazzi Smythe, betwixt Herakles and Draconi s, which we have tried to fill in with the male hippopot amus of Sut as a group of stars that include d Clavis Corona , but only as a stop - gap. We now pass on to the Lesser Bear. In the Egypt ian eschatology (Rit., ch. 44, 2 - 3) the jackal Ap - uat represents a pow er of salvation from the drow ning deep. In crossing the gul f of Putrata into which the helpless dead fall headlong and the sinki ng stars are swallow ed by the dragon , the manes says, “Ap - uat lifteth me up.” This pow er is show n to be localized in the region of the pol e by the speaker saying (after being saved by Ap - uat), “I hide myself among you, O ye stars that never set” — that is, in the circum pol ar paradise at the pol e, where the jackal or the dog was the gui de of ways. When the pol e had passed from the cons tella tion of Ursa Minor the pow er of salvation woul d have gone from the jackal to whatsoever type might represent Kephe us, and Ap - uat the gui de as Cynos ura woul d no longe r be look ed up to as a deliverer from the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"drow ning waters of the deep. Com mentators on the Korân repeat the ancient traditions conc erning the Adite ancestors of the Arab race. These were the giants or kings of prodi gious size and stature, like the mons trous figures of the primitive cons tellations in the heptanom is. After the deluge these were c hanged into monke ys. Now the Arabs claim descent from one Kahten or Kaften the Adite, and Kaften in Egypt ian is a name of the great ape that was one of the seven giants of the pol e - star cons tellations and a zoot ype of Shu, whom we identify with Kephe us. It is also said in the Code x Chimalpopoc a that men were transformed into monke ys as the result of a deluge or great hur ricane. As the pol e was figur ed at seven successive stations in the heptanom is, it is pos sible that the Navajo Deluge myth cont ains a time - gauge . In this it is related that when “the men of a world before our ow n” were warned of an appr oaching flood they were living in “the third world” or station of the pol e, and the place of refuge which they raised against the com ing deluge was in “the fou rth world” or station of the pol e, which, according to the present reckoni ng, was in the cons tellation of Kepheus. The turkey just escaped, although the water was close enough after him to wet the tip of his tail. Now , it happe ns that the next pos ition of the pol e is in the cons tellation of the bird cygnus , also named the hen, the kite, 613 and other forms of ornis. Moreove r, the star Alpha was called Dzeneb in Arabic, or the tail. And this, according to the present reckoni ng, we cons ider to have been the four th world or four th of the seven stations of the pol e. When the pol e passed from the cons tellation Kephe us into Cygnus the swan it would give rise to a legend like that of the Gipps land blacks, who assert that the first lot of men were turned into duc k s by the wicked moon. Cygnus the swan was know n as Ornis the bird, the bird of Jupi ter, and also as the kite. The kite is equi valent to the hawk in Egypt , and the “kite of Osiris” is mentione d in the Ritual by the speaker, who is in the region of the glori ous one s, the circum pol ar gods or seven great khus . He is at the place of the balance, “which is maat,” the stellar poi nt of equi poi se, otherwise at the pol e. He exclaims, “Here is the cycle of the gods and the kite of Osiris” (ch. 136 B ). The name of Osiri s may be a later insertion, but the kite remained, and this is a name for the cons tellation Cygnus or the Swan, the fifth of the seven pol e - stars, beginni ng with Corona (or its equi valent) as the first. The pol e - star was in the kite som e seventeen thous and years ago. And here, says the speaker who has attained the sum mit of the mount , “here is the cycle of the gods and the kite (=cygnus ) of Osiris.” Four teen thous and years ago Polaris was the star Vega in the cons tellation now know n as Lyra. Vega or Wega=W aki denot es the falling one . As vultur cade ns it was the falling vul ture. The Arabic name signi fies the falling eagle, An - nasz - al - waki. Now , the vul ture as Egypt ian can be identified with the pol e and pos sibly as a pol e - star. The leg cons tellation was a fi gur e of the pole. It is mentioned in the Ritual (ch. 149, 11t h Aat, line 8) as the leg of the lake, and a co - type with the tree of the lake on which the glorified spirits alight ed in the form of birds, and there is a chapter in the Ritual for assum ing the form of a vulture and perching on the leg, a landi ng - place equi valent to the pol e. “I am the divine vul ture,” says the speaker, “who is on the leg” or the pol e. And a star know n as the vul ture statione d on the leg of the pol e must be Polaris. We see that s om e fourteen"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"thous and years ago the pol e was in the cons tellation Lyra, and the pol e - star was the “falling vul ture” Vega. This may have a bearing on the legend of the vulture in the Mexican tradition of the deluge . It is related of the American Noah, named Coxc ox or Tezpi, that he made a bark or, still more primitively, a raft, with which he saved himself, his wife, and children from the ove rwhelming waters of the deluge . When the god Tezcatlipoc a decreed that the waters shoul d retire, Tezpi sent forth a vu lture from the bark. The bird did not return, but stayed to feed upon the bodi es of the drow ned. He sent out the hum mingb ird, which came back with a leafy branch in its beak. Then Tezpi, seeing that land was visible and grow ing verdant, left his ark upon t he Mount of Culhua can. This was the mount ain of the seven caves in which the seven giants or great spirits dw elt. The name denot es the mount ain that leans ove r at the sum mit, as it is depicted in the Aztec doc um ents, a picture of the pivot toppl ing ove r wi th the change of pol e - star. If we suppos e the change to have been made and the deluge to have occurred when the 614 pol e - star was shifted from a Cygnus to the cons tellation Lyra the next pol e - star woul d be the vul ture, which afterwards became the fallin g one. Thus the vul ture indi cated the new land that was grow ing green across the water of the deluge , the mount on which anot her landi ng - place was found; anot her altar was erected, and the sacrifice was offered up upon the sum mit of the mount by thos e who had escaped the great calamity, as it was mythically represented, whether the mount might be Culhua can, Tulan, Annu, Ararat, Nizir, or Meru. And a pol e - star know n as the vul ture woul d in the cour se of precession becom e the “vul ture falling” whos e “fall” is chroni cled in the name of vulture cade ns. If thos e who follow ed in the wake of the Egypt ians, like the Euph rateans, Greeks, and Arabs, were not always masters of the gnos is, they coul d at least trans literate the anc ient nam es and thus bring on part of the meaning. The Arabic name for the “falling vul ture” was also the “falling eagle.” And in som e of the legends it is the eagle that foretells the com ing deluge . A myth of the Pima Indi ans relates that a prophe t was warned by the eagle of a vast cataclysm or deluge then at hand; but the prophe t took no heed, and the waters came that ove rwhelmed the world. This also we might call the deluge that occurred when the pol e passed from its station in Cygnus into that of the eagle or vul ture. The legend of the eagle i s also extant amongs t the Kamilaroi of Australia, who tell of a deluge from which two human beings onl y made their escape by climbing up a tree. And here the deluge is attribut ed to Pundj el, the eagle - hawk. The tree we unde rstand to be a figur e of the pol e . Williams tells us that “the highe st poi nt of Koro Island has a name conne cted with the idea of a bird sitting there and lamenting ove r the subm erged island. ” It is said in a chant, “the qui qui laments ove r Koro because it is lost” ( Nat. Gen., vol . II, p. 241) . Thus the eagle is one of the seven cons tellations of the pol e - stars, and in the ancient British mythol ogy the eagle is one of the seven Welsh old one s of the world, called the eagle of Gwernabw y, who perched upon the rock he found there, pecking eve ry evening at the stars. There he is said to have remained unt il the rock was worn dow n to the height of a man’s palm. Such legends we sugg est originated when the rock of the pol e was in the cons tellation of the Eagle, which represented one of the old one s of the seven pol e - stars or rulers of the pol e. The earth is som etimes described as having been created"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"on the back of a tortoise, and when the tortoise sank in the water there was an ove rwhelming deluge . A Manda n medicine - man told Catlin that the earth wa s a tortoise carrying dirt upon its back ( Nat. Gen., vol . II, p. 195). The mother of beginni ngs is por trayed in a legend of the Tuscarora Indians as an enceinte female in labour =Apt the pregna nt hippopot amus godde ss, who sank from an uppe r region and was r eceived on the back of a tortoise which had a little earth upon its back, and this became an island upon which she bor e twin sons , who correspond to the Egypt ian Sut and Horus, and then passed away. The tortoise was a zoot ype of the earth itself amidst the waters of space, which was repeated as a figur e of land or the landi ng - place in the heavens at the pol e. It was onc e an Egypt ian sign of the balance or 615 scales in the zodi ac at the poi nt of equi poi se where the land emerged from the deluge of the Nile . The tortoise was likewise a type of the constellation Lyra, in which the star Vega was the Stella Polaris four teen thous and years ago (W. H. Higgins, Stars and Cons tellations , pp. 22, 23). In the signs of the North American Indi ans a landi ng after a voya ge is typi fied by a tortoise. Thos e who found safety from the deluge on the turtle’s back or on the tortoise woul d reckon their descent from the mount ain of the pol e when it was statione d in the cons tellation of the Tortoise or Lyra. Thus the Delaware Indi ans gave precedence to their turtle clan because it descende d from the great original tortoise, not from any com mon turtle. The Iroquoi s turtle clan are likewise descende d from a great fat turtle which threw off its shell and gradua lly develope d into a man . This is exactly what did occur when the tortoise Lyra sank in the waters or the turtles were drow ned, and the typi cal man was created at the next station of the pol e. If we suppos e the end of the period to have com e for the pole to move out of Cygnus int o the cons tellation Lyra or the Tortoise, the next landi ng - stage in the course of precession, the end was with the subm ergence of the pol e - star or a deluge ; and thos e who escaped from drow ning when this station of the pol e in Cygnus went unde r naturally so ught a place of safety on the back of the tortoise or its co - type the turtle. Evidently this was what did occur when the deluge took place in the myth of Manaboz ho. The deluge was let in by the “black serpent mons ter,” the representative of evil in phys ica l phe nom ena. “At the island of the turtle or tortoise was Manaboz ho, the grandf ather of men and beings .” As he was bor n creeping, he is “ready to move and dw ell in turtle land.” Then “the men and beings ” all go forth toge ther “on the flood of waters, movi n g afloat everyw here seeking the back of the turtle.” “All toge ther on the back of the turtle then, the men were altoge ther. Much fright ened, Manaboz ho prayed to the turtle that he woul d make all well again. Then the waters ran off: it was dry on mount and plain, and the great evil went elsewhere by the path of the cave.” ( Nat. Gen., vol . II, pp. 180 , 181 .) According to the Mexican version, there were seven caves in the celestial mount , which answer to the seven stations of the pol e. One of these was the cav e of the turtle. In anot her account that was preserved in pictogr aphs it is the turtles that declare war on Manaboz ho and produc e the deluge . Manaboz ho first carried his grandm other to the summit of a lofty mount ain. He himself climbed to the top of the ta llest pine tree and waited unt il the waters had subs ided. Then he created an island which suppor ted him and became a new world. This was the new station of the pole, and the tallest pine was the tree of the pol e that was planted or re -"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"erected in heaven whe n the flood was ove r. One of the most striking survivals is that of the tortoise and its legend conne cted with the deluge in the religious ceremoni es of the Indi ans. They say, “The world was onc e a great tortoise, bor ne on the waters and cove red with earth . One day a tribe of white men had made hol es in the earth to a great depth whilst diggi ng for badge rs; at lengt h they pierced the shell of the tortoise, and it sank. ” The deluge follow ed, and drow ned all the men but one , who saved himself 616 in a boa t, and when the earth re - emerged, he sent out a dove which returned to him with a branch of willow in its beak. The tortoise was a Manda n image of the ark in which peopl e were preserved from the waters at the time of the deluge . That is, according to the anc ient wisdom , when the pol e was resting in the cons tellation of the Tortoise, after the deluge that drow ned the land and subm erged the mount in Cygnus or the Swan. There is no hint of the turtle in the planisphe re, but the turtle and tortoise are equi valent and interchange able type s, and there is a tortoise in the heavens. The Arabic name of the cons tellation Lyra is the Tortoise, and but for the shell of the tortoise there woul d have been no Lyre. Some sixteen or seventeen thous and years ago the celestial p ole passed out of the cons tellation Cygnus or bird, and a new gui de - star was established as Vega in Lyra. In other words, when Cygnus sank the tortoise or the turtle offered its broad back for a landi ng place amid the waters of the deluge . Other of the Ame rican Indi an tribes claim that their primeval hom e was in the old turtle land= the island of the tortoise. The Lenni - Lenape or Delaware Indi ans sing the song of the flood. In this it is related that the Being bor n creeping and the men all went forth from th e deluge swimming afloat in the deep or crawling in the shallow water. Taking refuge on the back of the turtle or tortoise, when read astronom ically according to the move ment in precession, agrees with the passage of the pol e out of Cygnus into the cons tel lation of the Tortoise. The Samoans tell a tale of the wom an and child who were transformed, and afterward came to the peopl e of the village, when called for, in the shape of turtles (Turner, Sam oa, p. 108 ). This is a co - type with the tortoise; and when t he pol e passed from the sign of Cygnus , the new - born child woul d be brought forth by the old mother in the shape of a tortoise or a turtle, in accordance with the mythical mode of re - peopl ing the planisphe re. Thus the primal pair woul d be said to have been change d into turtles, as the folk that dated from the period when the pol e was in the tortoise or turtle and who were affiliated to the pow er above , the “big brother,” the tortoise or turtle that never died, as the totemic tortoises. The “great original,” whether of the turtles or hippopo tami, crocodi les or jackals, apes or vul tures, and finally of men, was conf igur ated in the heavens on one or other of the mount ains or islands that represented the seven stations , nom es, or seven heavens of the pol e in the celestial heptanom is. The Hindu drawings (Moor ’s Hindu Pant heon, pl. 49) show a form of the pol e or central coni cal peak that rests upon the tortoise, which, as here interpreted, denot es the pol e - star in the cons tellation Lyra, that was otherwise know n as the Tortoise. The tortoise suppor ting the pol e in the shape of a tree=mount or island standi ng in the water is also a Japanese figur e of the sustaining pow er at the pole. In the temple of Meaco there is a Japanese representation of a tortoise in the water at the bottom of a tank or artificial well, with a"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"tree springi ng up from the back of the tortoise. Thus the abys s of the waters, the earth at the bot tom of the abys s, and the tree of the pol e are uni que ly imaged in one picture. There was a tortoise - head ed god in Egypt who has left his likeness in the tom bs, but not hing else is know n of him. The animal itself 617 was a type of immobi lity, therefore of sloth or fixity, as a representative of the pol e. In a Chinese myth the island of Pung - Lai was brought one day in all its mass by the tortoise. A tortoise or turtle appe aring from the waters of earth was appr opr iate, as it was primitive to image the bit of land emerging from the waters of the firmament. This, how ever, was the mythical not cosmical earth tha t was suppor ted by the tortoise amid the waters. The tortoise beneath the tree or the mound show s it was not our earth that is suppos ed to rest or to have been formed upon its back in the beginning. It is pos sible for the tortoise or turtle as a type of th e earth itself to get mixed up in the irrespons ible legends with the tortoise or turtle as an astronom ical figure. Still the earth, as turtle, never was subm erged by the mythical deluge , whereas the tortoise or turtle that was a type of station in the cele stial water did sink dow n when that particular station of the pole was ove rwhelmed. Som e four teen thous and years ago the pol e in Lyra or the Tortoise corresponde d to the vernal equi nox in Leo. This is proba bly connot ed in a plate of Lajard’s Mithra, where the zodi acal lion is found with the star Radiatartakhu or Lammergeier=Vega as Polaris in Lyra (pl. 56, 3). An instructive example of the way in which the astronom ical mythos may dislimn and lose its shape in later legend is appa rent in the curious narrat ive found on a cune iform tablet in the British Museum . This has been called “the revol t in heaven” which occurred at som e time before the creation of man. The ange lic hos t has previous ly existed in a state of perfect harmony. “The god of hol y songs , lord o f religion and worship, had seated a thous and singe rs and musicians, and established a chor al band who to this hym n were to respond in multitude .” “The divine being, god of the bright crow n, spoke three times the com mencement of a psalm. With a loud cry of contempt they broke up his holy song, spoi ling, conf oundi ng his hym n of praise.” Then the god of the bright crow n “stoppe d their service, and sent them to the gods who were his enemies” and prohi bited their return. “In their room he created mank ind. ” This is a legend of the ange ls so called who fell from heaven, and of whom it is said in the boo k of Jude , “They kept not their ow n habitations ” (Jude . VI). These in the book of Enoc h are the seven stars which transgressed the com mandm ent of God and came not i n their prope r season; and therefore they were bound and cast out unt il the time of the last judgm ent (Enoc h, XVIII. XXI. XXII). It is said in the cune iform text, “May the god of divine speech expe l from his five thous and thos e who in the midst of his heav enly song had shout ed evil blasphe mies,” and the translator argue s that there were but five thous and. But anot her reading is pos sible. There may have been six thous and altoge ther. For instance, in the Cuthean story of creation there is an allusion to anot h er legend of the seven pow ers. It is said the proge ny of Tiamat “grew up in the midst of the moun tains and became heroes and increased in num ber.” “Seven kings who were brethren appe ared as begetters. Six thous and in num ber were their armies” (col. 1), and these we take to have include d the five thous and loya l ange ls, “his five thous and” from whom the rebel thous and are to"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 618 be exclude d thenceforth and for ever as the sixth thous and. It is said of the god Ashur that he had seen the malice of thos e gods who deserted their allegiance to raise a rebellion, and “he refused to go forth with them.” In one character Ashur is know n to have been a representative of the pole; and according to the present interpretation he was the god of the com ing pol e - star, the s eventh in our reckoni ng, the one that had not fallen away from the true pol e. This woul d appl y if Ashur at the time was a representative of the seventh pol ar pow er, the one that remained true whilst one thous and of the six thous and has risen in rebellion. As we interpret the mythos , the chor al band who sang the hym n of praise, one thous and in num ber, are the sixth thous and of the six thous and correspondi ng to the sixth of the seven stars or stations in precession. At the time of the change from the sixth po le - star to the seventh the revol t of the thous and that was sixth in the series coincided with the falling away of the sixth star from the true eternal pol e. Ashur as the seventh remained the god seven, who is re - bor n as the child cons idered to be the eight h; he refused to go forth with the one thous and of the past pol e - star. And now follow s the statement, “In their room , he, the god of the bright crow n ( i.e. the solar deity), created manki nd. ” This, the seventh creation, we associate with the passage of the pol e into the cons tellation Herakles, or the Man. The “lyre” imaged in the cons tellation Lyra had been fashione d from the muscles torn from Sut by Horus dur ing the war in heaven. Thus the condi tion of harmony represented by the lyre, harp, or lute corresp onds to the avoc ations of the thous and who are expe lled from com panions hip with the other five thous and and who are described as “a thous and singe rs and musicians.” These we now sugge st were the denizens of “Lyra,” whos e lapse in allegiance is attribut able to the falling away of the pol e - star when the pol e was passing out of that constellation into the sign of Herakles in which occurred the creation of man. It is a saying of Orphe us, repor ted by Plato, that “in the sixth creation closes the order of song” ( Plato, Philebus , 66) . That is, according to the present reckoni ng, when the pol e passed out of the cons tellation Lyra into Herakles or the Man. In the Bunda hish, the deluge or a deluge takes place in heaven before the creation of man on earth. This saying can be read for the first time on the theory that man was the latest of seven creations , and that the man figured in heaven was the seventh in the series as a ruler of the pol e and pol e - star. Thus interpreted, there had been six deluge s prior to the creat ion of man. Both in the book of Genesis and in the Bunda hish the prototypa l pair are created “man.” Ahur a - Mazda says to Mashya and Mashyoi , “You are man.” “You are the ancestry of the world.” They were now the ancestors with a hum an soul instead of the ear lier elemental soul of life in water, air, earth, heat, plant, or animal; otherwise stated, the descent was now traced to the divine man or father in heaven instead of to Seb the god of earth, who was the representative of vegetation, and the gnos is was no w appl ied on the scale of the Great Year. The Tlascatans say that after their deluge thos e who had been previous ly change d into monke ys were afterwards transformed into men. Now , 619 "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"if the hypot hesis here put forth holds good, that the six zoot ype s and one hum an being were set in the circle of precession, it follow that at the time the pol e passed into the cons tellation of Herakles or “the Man,” the deluge took place when the tortoises, the apes, and other forms of the zoot ype s were transformed into hum a n beings . This woul d correspond perfectly to the seventh creation in the later legends , which was the creation of manki nd. If we take the oldest record in the world, the Egypt ian, we shall find that in the mythol ogy the creation of man was the latest. Amo ngs t the seven primordial pow ers one alone is hum an. In the cons tellation - figur es man is scarcely to be found . Not unt il the time of Seb was the produc ing pow er of earth por trayed as male. Not unt il the time of Atum - Ra is the divinity impersona ted in the f orm of a perfect man. Earth had been huge ly imaged as a pregna nt hippopot amus, a sow as the suckler, a goos e that laid the egg for food, a sloughi ng serpent that was an image of self - renewal, but not by man as the measure of all things , includi ng the eleme ntal forces and pow ers of external nature. And not unt il the image of man had been adopt ed as a type of divinity in place of the totemic zoot ype s coul d men have traced their descent from man in the mythology. This occurs in Egypt when the hippopot amus of S ut, the crocodi le of Sebek, the lion of Shu, the ibis of Taht, the beetle of Ptah were follow ed by the hum an likeness that was perfected and divinized in Tum or Atum , the original of Adam. In the Egypt ian langua ge the word tum signi fies man, manki nd, creat ed man. The Egypt ians also called themselves the Ruti, or the men; the race par excellence, in contradistinction to the bul ls, lions , crocodi les, serpents, apes, jackals, hawks, and other of the zoot ype s in totemism. They had attained this stage at the beg inni ng of monum ental times. Man, the hum an being, was preeminently the creation of Atum - Ra, the father - god. Various names of races signi fy man, or the men. The name of the Inoi t, the Ainu, and other primitive folk means man, or the men. Descent from wom an unde r the matriarchate had been represented by the zoot ype s, and when the fatherhood was indi vidua lized the hum an descent was from man. The birthland of man on high was figured astrono mically as the island or nom e or bit of earth, which was a station of th e pol e - star in the cons tellation of Herakles or the Man, from thirteen thous and to eleven thous and years ago, at the end of which time the great deluge caused the destruction of mank ind. Instead of the races that were imaged by pre - hum an and totemic type s, the tortoises, the apes, the birds, the dogs , it was now “the men” who were drow ned in the last great deluge of all, when the pol e - star in the Man or Herakles went unde r. It is stated in the Chimalpopoc a MS. that the creator produc ed his work in successi ve epoc hs, man being made from the dus t of earth on the seventh day . Here again man is created or com es into existence in the last of seven periods , whatsoever the lengt h of time or signi ficance assigne d to the cycle, which is one day in the book of Genesi s and three thous and seven hundr ed and four teen years in the astronom ical mythology. In all the versions of the seven creations that of man was last. This is repeated when the mount 620 or island of man is last of the celestial seven stations in the hept anom is. Now we can say the final word conc erning “the destruction of mankind” in the great deluge of all, which put an end to the heaven in seven divisions that preceded the eight , the nine, the ten, and"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"the twelve. At the endi ng in time when Vega in Lyra (the vulture and tortoise) ceased to be the pol e - star, there was a deluge and subs idence of land at the pol e and a change of star. The races drow ned in this and previous deluge s were totemic, therefore pre - hum an, therefore the predecessors of man in the as tronom ical mythol ogy, the märchen, and legenda ry lore. Six races had been destroye d in half - a - doz en deluge s before it came to the “destruction of manki nd” that was memorized and mythically rende red in the Egypt ian deluge when the pol e - star was washed unde r in the cons tellation of the Man, the one of seven might ies, now for the first time in the hum an form. This is the one star group in all the heavens that was figur ed as “the man,” the last of the seven rulers of the pol e, correspondi ng at this poi nt to the attainm ent of the hum an image in the last of seven so - called creations , which is that of Adam=Atum in the zodi ac just where the Sekhe t - Aarru or garden of Eden has been localized in the solar, which follow ed and com pleted the luna r and stellar mythos . Thus we can rough ly trace the poi nt at which the last of seven pol e - stars coincided with the creation of man in heaven which was succeeded by the creation of Atum =Adam (or man) at the point of a new beginni ng in the zodi ac. Such type s of the pol e - stars as the tortoise or vul ture (in Lyra), the swan, the lesser bear (or jackal and the dragon) , were figures of thos e creations which preceded that of the man who was mythical and astronom ical. The Samoans relate that Tanga loa was the originator of men. He is their g od in the height , or the eight h heaven. As a primitive way of saying how @plucky he was and of show ing how the eight pow ers, seven plus one , were all com bined in him, he is called “eight - livered Tanga loa.” A temple was bui lt for him and termed the hous e of the gods , which was carefully shut up all round, and therefore is equi valent to Am - Khemen, the Egypt ian enclosure of the eight great gods . These characteristics identify Tanga loa as deity of the pol e and as eight h to the seven earlier pow ers. Now Tanga loa is said to have com e ove r the ocean with a crew of seven others in a canoe , and to have taken up his abode in the bus h inland of the settlement. Here the migration is the same as that of the 7+ 1 Kami, the 7+ 1 Kabiri, the 7+ 1 Toltecs, the 7+ 1 with Arthur i n the ark. The migration in each instance is pur ely mythical, and the data are simply astronom ical. Lastly, descent from the mount or mound, the tree or the papyr us - reed, the enclosure or paradise of the pole, was follow ed in the Semitic versions of the de luge legends by a descent of the hum an race from the ark which was strande d on the mount ain top of Nizir or Ararat. The ark of Nnu had then been bui lt to float upon the waters of the firmament and to be figured in the ascendi ng stars of Argo - Navis. This is the ark with eight on boa rd, four females and four males, which was inde finitely later than the boa t of the Mexican primal pair or the papyrus - reed of the four brothers in Egypt . When the seventh station of the pol e subs ided, the seventh island 621 of Atlantis sank, and all the seven were reckone d then to be ove rthrow n in the celestial waters. Unde r the other figur e of the mount , the seven mount ains now were totally subm erged. This com plete catastrophe is described by Enoc h, who identifies the seven mou ntains with the seven stars and the seven great spirits. He likewise gives the reason for their ove rthrow al. “I beheld seven stars, like great blazing mount ains, and like spirits (the Khamite khus are spirits), entreating me.” The stars are thos e which “ca me not in"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"their prope r season” (ch. 18) . Again, “I beheld seven stars of heaven bound toge ther like great mount ains” (ch. 21, 3). Their crime is that they “transgressed the com mandm ent of the most high. ” Therefore they are bound unt il the time of the great judgm ent and the cons um mation or end of all things , which we shall find particularly recorded in the book of Revelation. From thirteen thous and to eleven thous and years ago the vernal equi nox was passing through the Lion sign. Pari pas su in the move ment o f precession, the nor th celestial pol e was leaving its station in Lyra, or the tortoise, and passing into the sign of Herakles or the Man. Thus the creation of man or Atum in the zodi ac can be partially paralleled in the cycle of precession at a certain st ation of the pol e in the cons tellation of the heavenly man, who is Atum or Adam in the astronom ical mythol ogy . All the conj unc tions , the mythical characters, the scenery of this beginni ng – the Great Bear, sun, moon, and seven stars, toge ther with the inunda tion – met in that sign and were cons tituted a fixture for two thous and one hundr ed and fifty - five years. Ten thous and seven hundr ed and seventy - five years ago the equi nox began to move out of the Lion sign into that of the Crab, and then and there a legend ary catastrophe occurred. This was the conc lusion of an astronom ical period which, like the year in Egypt , ende d with a deluge . It occurred eight thous and two hundr ed and seventy - five years before the date of the conve rsation in Egypt betwixt Solon and the Hir - Seshta, and seven hundr ed and thirty - five years shor t of the nine thous and, but near enough when we are dealing with round num bers. The astronom ical facts were so well know n that in speaking of the inunda tion at the end of the cycle it was foretold th at the “deluge woul d take place when the heart of the Lion entered the first minut e of the Crab’s head at the declination of the star” — that is, the star Regul us, the law - giver, in the Lion sign. At this poi nt or readjustment the great deluge of all was mar ked by the subm ergence of the last of the seven pol e - stars in “the Man” just when the shifting of the pol e coincided with a deluge as a typi cal endi ng in the solar zodi ac. For when the heaven of Atum - Ra was established on the four corners, the typi cal endi ng previous ly marked by the changi ng pol e - stars was dupl icated in the zodi ac by the precession of the equi noxe s, and both went on toge ther in two mode s of measuring the move ment. As the type of an endi ng in time, a mythical deluge occurred when a pol e - star was subm erged in the celestial waters, and the great deluge of all took place at the end of the cycle in precession called the Great Year of the World. It was mythically rende red as the sinking of Atlantis in seven islands which 622 represented the seve n astronom es in the celestial heptanom is. The last “great deluge of all” is the subj ect of the story told to Solon by the priests of Sais. Of this, and the conf lagration that was caused by the fall of Phaethon, they sagely said, “This takes the form of a m yth, but in reality it signi fies a declination of the bodi es movi ng round the earth in the heavens.” The astronom ers kne w that the deluge was mythical and the myth was astronom ical, whether the end of the particular period was represented by fire or by flo od. Moreove r, this greatest deluge can be approximately dated. Plato’s account of what the priests of Egypt said to Solon identifies the “great deluge of all” as having occurred about nine thous and years before that time — i.e. about 9600 B.C. , or eleven tho usand five hundr ed years ago. That date was given by the Egyptian priests with particular precision. They said the city of Sais had been founde d eight thous and years before the time when"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Solon was in Egypt . After carefully examining their sacred registers, they told him that the city of Sais was eight thous and years old, and that it was founde d a thous and years after the cataclysm called the “great deluge of all.” In their account we get to the bot tom of the “lost Atlantis.” According to the present diagnos is, then, the primary pol e - star in the nor thern heaven may be Clava Coronae , the key of the crow n, when this was in the enor mous cons tellation of the male hippopot am us — that is, of Sut, the first - bor n of the female hippopot amus. Polaris in its second form w as the star Alpha in the Dragon . The third station was in the Lesser Bear, the four th in Kephe us, the fifth in Cygnus the Swan, the sixth in Lyra or the Tortoise, the seventh in Herakles or Man. Each of these in turn had been a station of the pol e, a landi ng - place for foot hol d in the firmamental waters; each had been the sufferer from a deluge at the declination of the pol e and cons eque nt change of pol e - star. Hence the num ber of deluge legends in the astronom ical mythology, includi ng “the great deluge of al l” as the last of the seven. If we take the lengt h of the Great Year in round num bers at twenty - six thous and years, and divide the total into seven equa l parts, this gives som e three thous and seven hundr ed and fourteen years as the time for the pol e to res t in each of the seven signs . Six thous and years ago the pol e - star was in Draconi s. Three thous and seven hundr ed and fourteen years earlier the pole had entered the Hippopot amus (or Crow n), and three thous and seven hundr ed and four teen years earlier still it was in the cons tellation of Herakles or the Man. Thus , eleven thous and four hund red and twenty - eight years B.C. the pol e was represented by the last of the seven pol e - stars in the cons tellation of the Man. The end of the Great Year determined by the great deluge of all then occurred in that sign, according to the Egypt ian account , about 9600 B.C. , or nine thous and in round num bers, with various surpluses to be adde d in the total reckoni ng. Naturally, the deluge that destroye d manki nd instead of the t otemic tortoises, jackals and dogs , vultures and swans, apes, crocodi les and hippopot ami, occurred when the pol e was in or was passing from the isle of the Man. Thenceforth the deluge woul d be looke d on as a literal destruction of the hum an race, and was s o 623 cons trued in the Semitic legends , as it still is by the Christian clergy. This is but the rough sketch of a pione ering pen. Greater exactitude in dates must be left to the scientific astronom er who may have mastered the mythol ogy. My sugge stion is that one Great Year in the circle of precession was reckone d to have been ende d with the passing of the pol e from the cons tellation of Herakles eleven thous and years ago, which is near as need be, for the present pur pos e, to the time assigne d by the Egypt i an priests for the sinki ng of the lost Atlantis in the last great deluge of all. Now , the hum an birthpl ace had been localized according to the different stations of the pol e, which were seven in num ber altoge ther. There were seven count ries, nom es,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"or cit ies, determined by the pol e - stars. Each race claims a particular place for a starting poi nt in the migration from the mount , or the tree, or the back of the tortoise, and various races have preserved som e fragm ents of the stories told about the wande rings and migrations from one land to anot her, as in the legends of the North American Indi ans, the Aztecs, and the Arunt a of Central Australia. The so - called “primitive cradle of the hum an race in Ararat or Urdhu, the district of the mount ain of the world” ( Tra ns. Soc iety Bib. Archae ology , vol . VI, p. 535) , had its prototype in the planisphe re and the birthpl ace at the pol e. Ararat is but one form of the mythical mount . We derive the name from the Egypt ian root “rat,” which signi fies the ascent, the steps of asc ent, the foot stool , the figur e of ascent. In the develope d form, Arrut or Ararat also denot es the staircase or steps of ascent, which is the mount of seven steps, or the staircase=the mount . In one form the ark of Ararat was the circum pol ar paradise; in an other it is the eternal city, like Thebes, which is called the “augus t staircase of the beginni ng of time, the utat of the uni versal lord” which led up to the particular region where the Eye was then at full as the figure of a period in precession. When th e pol e had passed into the sign of Herakles the Man, the typi cal mount which had been figured in the Hippo pot amus, in Draconi s, in the Lesser Bear, in Kephe us, in Cygnus , and in the Tortoise naturally became “the mount ain of mank ind” by name. This was the birthpl ace of the hum an race who descende d from Atum , Adm u, or Adam as the man, and eventually the men who descende d from “the mount ain of manki nd. ” The giant with his staff who figur es in the popul ar pastimes is proba bly a survival of Herakles with his c lub, as one of thos e old giants that imaged the sustaining pow er of the pol e, the last of whom was in the likeness of a might y man. The mount , as a poi nt of emergence from the waters, is looke d up to and addr essed by the manes in the Ritual (ch. 42) at th e com ing forth from Amenta. It is called “the pedestal of the gods ,” “the land of the white crow n,” and “the land of the rod or staff” =pol e. That this is the land (Rit., ch. 42) of the celestial pol e, the moun t, or the tree is prove d by the vigne tte in whi ch the deceased is drawing a cord around the tat emblem of stability, which is anot her figur e of the pol e to which he clings for safety in the waters. The mount of migration from which the various races claim to have descende d, like the Aztecs from the is land - mount ain Colhua can, is 624 finally the pole which had seven starting - poi nts and stations in the circuit of precession. According to a Norse legend, the land of the immortals was to the north of Finland, in the neighbour hood of the White Sea. That, h ow ever, does not signi fy the original hom e and birthpl ace of an Aryan race in Europe . It is but a local representation of the paradise in the nor thern heaven and the white water of the Milky Way or sea of solar light . The mythical birthpl ace on the mount o f heaven for the peopl e of the pol e will expl ain how it was that the ancient Britons coul d claim that they were emigrants from Troy. In the true tradition this woul d mean the celestial, not the munda ne Troy — the Troy that is still figur ed by seven circles c ut in the sod by children in Wales. Troy was one of the forms of the enclosure on the sum mit, in the astronom ical mythol ogy which was Terui in Egypt ian as a name of Sesennu. It is a com mon tradition that the hum an birthpl ace was in paradise,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"and the descen t from thence has been misrepresented as the fall from heaven. This in the astronom ical mythol ogy was the enclosure of the circum pol ar Aarru around the tree upon the sum mit of the stellar mount , descent from which was from the mount ain, or one of the seven mount ains, of the pol e. One most fertile sour ce of conf usion has been the result of the mythical legends having been conve rted into ethni cal traditions . This birthpl ace above belonge d to the astronom ical mythol ogy, and it has been conve rted into the hum an birthpl ace on the mount ain and high places of our earth by the hum an child being laid in the cradle of the beginni ngs that were not hum an. That is, by the astronom ical tradition being made ethni cal, the pol ar paradise being made geogr aphi cal. Thus , the de scent from the circum pol ar paradise in the astronom ical mythology has been the cause of a wild - goos e chase in search of man’s lost heaven at the North Pole of the earth, by the usual literalizing of the legend in its Hebrew gui se. The mount from which the different races claim descent has been sufficiently identified as the astronom ical mount ain of the nor th, the mount of paradise, the one fixed poi nt for landi ng at, or launc hing from , the sum mit of the pol e. This also is the Babyl oni an “mount ain of the nat ions .” The Babyl oni ans at first were mound - bui lders. The mount of heaven was imitated in the mound, the hol y mound called the mound of Anu and Nebo and Ishtar. Afterwards they bui lt the tow er of Babilu, and the temple called Kharsag - Kalama, the “mount of t he nations .” This show s that the name of the astronom ical mount was given to the bui lding that was afterwards reared above the mound . The “mount of the nations” was the mount of a starting - poi nt, and of the divisions or ways in the heavens which we now tra ce to the station of Polaris in Herakles. The starting - poi nt of the Aztec migration is from the mythical one - tree - hill of the pol e. According to the picture - writing, bot h mount and tree are com bined in one figur e. In the Boturini and Gamelli Careri copi es the mount of earth is por trayed with the tree upon the sum mit. The tree on the mount (a teocallis) is very rude ly represented in the Aztec picture - writing as the starting - poi nt of the migration by water from the mount in the beginni ng. From this poi nt also the seven Toltecs com menced their wande rings in a boa t, like the seven Hohga tes, the seven Ali, Ari or Kabiri, the seven 625 dw arf sons of Pinga , and other forms of the seven in the celestial heptanom is. The poi nt of departure for the mythical migratio n is made ethni cal in the märchen. The Navajo Indi ans derive their origin from the top of the divine moun tain in the nor th, where the pol e is represented in their mythol ogy by the great reed which saved their proge nitors from the waters of the deluge in th e region of the stars which never set (Matthews, “The Navajo Mythol ogy, ” American Antiquar ian, 1883, p. 208) . The Ainus descende d from the region of the bears, which was at the sum mit of the very lofty mount ains in the north — that is, at the pol e. They like wise claim to derive their origin from the bear as their mother and the dog as their father, which can be read astronom ically. The she - bear took the place of the female hippopot amus, the original Great Mother of the Egypt ians, whos e cons tellation was the G reat Bear. The dog represents the earlier jackal, the zoot ype of Sut or Anup, as Apua t the gui de of ways. The jackal=the dog in the planisphe re of Dende rah still remains a figur e of the pole. One of the mythical Chinese emperors, Hwang - ti, was bor n in the bear - count ry and inhe rited the bear, the original type of which, as male, was the hippopot amus of Sut, the first deity of a"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"pol e - star. Hwang - ti was the first celestial bui lder, the first to cons truct an astronom ical instrum ent. He is said to have been the inve ntor of wheeled carts; hence his name of Hien Yuan. Now Sut, in the male hippopot amus, as already expl ained, was the primal pow er of the pol e - star; he was the inve ntor of astronom y, and first of the seven who heaped the mound and made his seat upon it. He was the first of all the star - gods , and was the fixed one at the centre of the revol ution or hub of the wheel, and therefore the inve ntor of the wheel. The Dyak chief whos e name denot ed “the bear of heaven” may be claimed to have been a descenda nt from the celestial bear, whos e title was cons eque ntly astronom ical and not simply totemic (C. Brooke , Ten Years in Sar awak, vol . I, 189) . The bear and wolf clans of the Iroquoi s descend from the primal pair who were represented by the great bear as mother and the jackal=wolf or prairie - dog as her son and cons ort. The type s of totemism had attained to a celestial setting in the astronom ical mythol ogy. They were no longe r merely of the earth, but also represented the “big brothers” in the sky, from whom descent w as claimed by the totemic groups . These were the bear that lived again in future food, the serpent that renewed itself, the panes bird that never died, the turtle of eternity, and other type s of supe rhum an pow ers that were cons tellated round the pol e of he aven. Thence came the races that descende d from their stations in the mount , or from the circum pol ar paradise, as the bears (or hippopot ami) and crocodi les, the jackals (or dogs ) and apes, the swans and tortoises, each from the mount according to the perio d. In Greece the Merope s were the peopl e of the thigh, and the thigh or leg of heaven was a figure of the pol e: thus the birthpl ace of a stellar race was figur ed in the meshke n of the “thigh, ” the group of stars now represented in the nor thern heaven by th e lady of the seat or chair in the cons tellation Cassiope ia. One title of the pol e was the Mount of the Khut i, or Mount Khut i. Thence the Khut i or Guti woul d suppl y a race - 626 name of lofty lineage for thos e who dated their descent from Mount Khut i. The Egypt ian Khut i came to be looke d upon as seven divine ancestors who did not originate as spirits of hum an beings , but were the ancestors of Ra. Now there is a Mount Gudi =Khut i in the nor th - east of Babyl oni a, and an ancient widely - spread tradition affirms that when the deluge was ove r the ark of Noah rested on this mount . The name is obvi ous ly one with that of the Guti or Khut i of the tablets; whence the gut im and the Hebrew goi m as a name for manki nd, and also for the mount ain of manki nd. Again, Mount Shen nu is anot her title of the pol e as the mount of the Shenni n, who were spirits or gods of the highe st order, and who might be called the uppe r seven, from whom we shoul d derive the Japanese and Chinese Shin and Shintu gods , which were originally seven, as w ere the Shenni n round the pol e or mount of the Most High in Egypt . Various difficulties that have been felt regarding the other world of Hom er can be met and vanqui shed when we know from whence the system of Greek mythol ogy was derived. The doubl e paradise , one in the subt erranean Amenta and one in the celestial garden of the gods , will expl ain the dua lity of the Hom eric other world. Hades prope r, like Amenta is beneath the earth; the happy other world of the dead is across the “divine sea” or oke anos , the celestial water of the Kamite Nun. Hesiod in the Theogony describes the Greek Tartarus as being “in a recess of earth having broad ways,” which can be identified with the dark parts of Amenta. The mount of the immortals called Olym pus is one with Mount Het ep in the Egypt ian"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"representation. Hence the Kimmerians of Hom er may be derived from the Egypt ian Khemi or Akhe mu, the dw ellers in the nor thern heaven, whether as never - setting stars or spirits of the glorified — that is, the Khut i. The city of the Kimmerian s in the nor th is described as being cove red with shadow and vapour. The sun doe s not behol d them when he goe s tow ard the starry heaven, nor when he turns back again from heaven to earth. It is always night in the land of the Kimmeroi. It was after suns et that the vessel reached the extreme bounda ry where stood the city of the Kimmerians ( Odyssey, books 11 and 12) . The Akhe mu are the soul s of the dead, or the never - setting stars that circle round about the nor thern pol e of heaven, but not in the arctic regi ons of the earth nor on the hor izon of the nor th. The dead were thos e who voya ged in the bark of heaven for the city of the Akhe mu at the sum mit of the pol e. When the Osiris deceased has attained the sum mit at the head of Aarru, he exclaims, “I stand erect in the bark which the god is piloting . . . and the Akhe mu (stars or spirits) ope n to me, and my fellow - citizens present to me the sacred cakes with flesh” (Rit., ch. 98) . In anot her chapter the speaker says, “I arrive at my ow n city.” This was the city o f the glorious one s who had risen to the region of the Akhe mu - Seku or never - setting stars. And this, it has now to be sugge sted, was the city of the mythical Kimmeroi. The voya ge was the same in the Greek, the Irish, or Assyrian legends as in the Egypt ian astro - mythos . And as the Khemi or Akhe mu were the nor therners in this pol ar sense, the same origin may well account for the peopl e of the nor th, in Chaldea, Japan, or Britain, being named the Kami, the Kimmeroi, or the Kymry, who derived their 627 nor the rn name on earth from that celestial birthpl ace in the northern heaven. Lastly, the dragon - mound was know n to the Druids as a type in the astronom ical mythology. Thence came the Dracont iae and the serpent - mounds of Britain, which, it may be feasibly inferr ed, were heaped up as images of the pol e and its station when α - Draconi s became the pol e - star about 4,000 years B.C.  "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"  628 THE EXODUS FROM EGYPT AND THE DESERT OF AMENTA W HEN roughl y classified, the myths and legends generally show two poi nts of departure for migrations of the hum a n race, as these were rende red in the stellar and solar mythol ogy. One is from the sum mit of the celestial mount , the other from the hol low unde r - world beneath the mount or inside the earth. The races that descende d from the mount were peopl e of the pol e w hos e starting - poi nt in reckoni ng time was from one or other station of the pol e - star, determinable by its type, whether as the tree, the rock, or other image of a first poi nt of departure. Thos e who ascende d from the nether - world were of the solar race who came into existence with the sun as it is represented in the legenda ry lore, that is, when the solar mythos was established. The tradition of the pol e - star peopl e found in various count ries is that they were bor n when no sun or moon as yet had com e into e xistence. That is, they were pre - solar and pre - luna r in their reckoni ng of time. These are they, as was said by the Egypt ians, who issued from the eye of Sut, or Darkne ss, the earliest type of which we reckon to have been Polaris, whether as the pol e - star in the sout hern or the nor thern heaven. These were the Nahsi and the Blackhe ads of the dim beginni ngs in the stellar mythol ogy . Following them, com e the peopl e born from the eye of Horus, which was a sym bol of the moon . These were held to be the luna r race . Lastly came the children of the sun. Thus , the eye as sym bol of a repeating period was stellar as the eye of Sut ; it was lunar as the eye of Horus; it was solar as the eye of Ra. In the stellar mythos men descende d from the sum mit of the mount , which was an image of the pol e. And still in legenda ry lore they try to tell us from which of the seven stations they descende d as a time - gauge in the prehistoric reckoni ng of their beginni ngs . But in the solar mythos they ascende d from the unde r - world which had be en hol low ed out beneath the mount of earth for the passage of the sun. Thus there are two poi nts of"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"departure in the astronom ical mythog raphy, one from above and one from below . The oldest races that have kept the reckoni ngs are descende d from one or other of the seven stations in the mount ain of the nor th, and in the later mythos men ascende d from the earth below , or from below the earth; the hum an ascent being figur ed in the upw ard pathw ay of the sun. These were the solar race 629 who follow ed the luna r and stellar peopl e of the past. These, when bor n in Egyp t, were the children of the sun - god Atum , who became the Hebrew Adam as the father of the hum an race. Before Amenta was created by the excavator Ptah within the nether earth there was no typi cal asc ent of man. Inde ed there were no men unt il the time of Tum , since which time the race has been cons idered hum an. When the sun - god Ra arose up from the earth, or from the Lotus, as the father of created man, or man the mortal, the legend of the hum an ascent was established. In the “creation” of Atum , instead of being reckone d as the offspring of the old First Mother or the group of the seven pre - solar gods , men became the children of Ra, who are said to have come into existence as tears from his eye, or as g erms of an elemental soul proceeding from the solar god . Stars were the children of Ra the sun - god in the solar mythos . Souls were the offspring of Ra the hol y spirit in the eschatology; and here we may pos sibly delve dow n to one of the tap - root s of the le genda ry “Exodus .” The stars were looke d on as a race of beings having soul s of light that emanated from the sun. To these the solar race, as hum an beings , were affiliated by means of the totemic type s, which include d the crocodi le of Sebek, the beast of Be s, the hawk of Horus, the scarabeus of Kheper. Hence it is said by the god Ra to the right eous in Amenta, “You your selves are tears of mine eye in you r person of supe rior men. I have shed abroad my seed for you” ( Book of Hade s, 5th division, D). These were the seed of Ra, who, as figur ed, were born like a tear from his eye, as a mode of effluence, and being solar they were the supe rior race of men, the Ruti, or men par excellence. Unde r the name of Khabsu in Egypt ian the stars are synonym ous with soul s. The se in their night ly rising from Amenta were the images of soul s becom ing glorified. They came forth in their thous ands and tens of thousands from the low er Egypt of the astronom ical mythos , the earliest exodus being stellar. Thus we can realise the leader Shu, who stands upon the height of heaven, rod in hand, and who was imaged in the cons tellation Kephe us as the Regul us or law - giver at the pol e. In the “Destruction of Manki nd” the stars are said to be “the multitude s which live in the noc turnal sky. ” In this unde r - world Taht, the moon - god, is called the lum inary of Ra “in the inferior heaven,” and in the deep region where he “inscribes the inha bitants”; and it is said to him, “Thou art the keeper of thos e who do evil, whom my heart abhor s” (pl. C., lines 65 - 70) . Taht was the reckone r of the stars here called the inha bitants of the noc turnal heaven, or sky of Amenta, whos e names or num bers were inscribed by him, pos sibly as six hundr ed stars, which num ber was extende d by the Jewish Kabalists to their six hu ndr ed thous and soul s in Guph. Be this as it may, here are the soul s in Amenta represented by stars as inha bitants of the unde r - world. And in the new creation by Atum - Ra, god of the noc turnal sun, they are spoke n of as “these multitude s of men.” Ra orders t hat his heaven shall be depicted as a field of rest, and there arose the elysian fields or"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"paradise of plenty on Mount Hetep. In this new heaven, says Ra, “I establish as inha bitants all the beings which are suspende d in the sky, the stars! said by the maj esty of Ra (to Nut), I assemble there the multitude s that they may celebrate 630 thee, and there arose the multitude s.” These multitude s as stars had been the inha bitants in the deep region of the inferior sky. Ra having been “lifted up” as god alone in this new heaven of the astronom ical mythos , the stars that were in the low er are to be assembled and groupe d toge ther in the uppe r heaven. This is follow ed by the stellar exodus from “low er Egypt and the desert of Amenta” unde r the leadership of Shu - Anhu r, the upl ifter of the sky toge ther with its inha bitants, the stars, called the children of Nut, or heaven. It is said by Ra “my ow n son Shu, take with thee my daught er Nut, and be the gua rdian of the multitude s which live in the noc turnal sky,” or the sky i n the low er Egypt of Amenta; “put them on thy head and be their fosterer,” or sustainer. (pl. B, line 42. ) Then, as said in the hym n to the god Shu, “Uplifted is the sky which he maintains with his two arms” as “king of Uppe r and Low er Egypt ” in his new ch aracter of Shu - si - Ra, who, in the solar mythos , had becom e the son of Ra. In the Ritual, ch. 110 , heaven is described as the mansion of Shu, “the mansion of his stars,” which was night ly renewed as “the beautiful creation which he raiseth up. ” We have now delved dow n to an origin for the Egyptian exodus in the stellar mythos . Shu was the upl ifter of the sky unde r his name of Anhur with his rod. As raiser of the firmament he upl ifts the starry hos t or multitude of beings know n as the offspring of Nut, or la ter, the seed of Ra, or later still, the children of Ra. These were previous ly the dw ellers in the low er Egypt of the mythos who are to be set free from this realm of darkne ss and gathered toge ther in the land of light , the starry heaven of Nut on high. Th eir deliverer was Shu - Anhu r, the leader up to Heaven, with his rod, as “repeller of the dragon com ing out of the abys s.” (p. 2, lines 5 and 6.) This exodus belongs to the rende ring in the mythol ogy , and unde rlies the Peri - em - hru or com ing forth to day acco rding to the Book of the Dead, in which the mythos has becom e the moul d of the eschatology. The resurrection of soul s has taken the place of the stars in the stellar, and of the sun in the solar mythos . The exodus was now the com ing forth of the Manes from “Egypt and the desert” as localities in the mysteries of Amenta. This was then made geogr aphi cal and practical by literalization in that exodus of the Israelites from the land of the Pharaohs which has hitherto passed as biblical history. In reviewing M. Renan’s work on Israel, a recent writer asks, what then is the origin and signi ficance of the exodus and its attendant plague s and prodi gies? “When did they com e, where or when were they inve nted? The monum ents are never likely to tell us.” No, not if we are looki ng for the Palestinian Jews in Egypt as an ethnol ogi cal entity, or for the ancient Egypt ian fables as biblical facts. But when we get clear of that cloud of iridescent dus t which the Jewish writings have interpos ed betwixt us and the monum ents, we shall find they do tell us more or less what was the origin of the wonde rful tale by which the world has been begui led so blindl y through mistaking verifiable myth for God’ s ow n historic word. The sufferings of the Chosen Peopl e in Egyp t and their miracul ous exodus out of it belong to the celestial allegor y of the solar drama that was"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"performed in the mysteries of the divine nether - world, and had been performed as a mythical representation ages before it was conve rted into a 631 history of the Jews by th e literalizers of the ancient legends . The tale of the ten plague s of Egypt cont ains an esoteric version of the tortures inflicted on the gui lty in the ten hells of the unde r - world. We have seen som ewhat of the descent of manki nd from a celestial birthpl ac e that was cons tellated as an enclosure on the mount ain of the pol e. We have now to trace the ascent from the regions of the nether - earth, which, as Egypt ian, is an exodus from Low er Egypt and the “desert” of Amenta. We shall have to make the jour ney throu gh this nether - earth onc e more in follow ing the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt in the character of the manes issuing from Amenta. The legend of the exodus or com ing forth to - day, like thos e of the creation, the deluge , and the lost paradise in the boo k of Genesis, belongs to that mythology which unde rlies and is the sour ce of all the märchen and the folk - lore of the world. The clue, as will be show n, has been preserved in what is com monl y termed the wisdom of the ancients, which we hol d to be Egypt ian in its origin and derivative on all the other lines of its descent. We find the mythos , the legends , and the folk - tales of the world are all invo lved in the Egypt ian wisdom , and the Hebrew traditions are demons trably the débris of Egypt ian myth and eschato logy. But, of all the various versions of the com ing forth or exodus from out the unde r - world, not one has caused such deep perplexity as this of Israel issuing from Egyp t, in which the mythos has been misappr opr iated and conve rted into an ethni cal history . As Egypt ian, it was not pretende d that the children of Ra were ethni cal, or that the mysteries of Amenta were transactions in the earth of time. The way up from Amenta was various ly portrayed as an ascent by means of steps; by scaling a mount , or by cli mbing a tree, a grape - vine, a reed, a bean - stalk, or a papyr us reed. In the legends of many races we find the tradition of a deliverance from som e subt erranean dw elling - place which was their primeval hom e. This exodus from the unde r - world is com mon in the märchen of the red men. With the Lenni Lenape Indi ans, the beginni ng was in a subt erranean abode up out of which they were led by the wolf as their chief totemic zoot ype . Now , the wolf is an equivalent for the jackal. In Egypt ian the wolf and jackal (Seb) are synonym ous ; and the jackal was the gui de of roads in Amenta who led the peopl e through its wilderness, and showed a way for them to ascend into the world of light . All the myths and legends of an und er - world depend upon there being an unde r - world, or n ether - earth, and this again depends on there being a doubl e - earth which was hol low ed out by the God who represented the noc turnal sun for the passage through the mount of earth by night , and who as Egyp tian was Ptah, the founde r of Amenta. In the Manda n t radition of their origin, it is related that the whol e nation onc e resided in one large village unde rground beside a subt erraneous lake. A grape - vine extende d its root s dow n to their habitation, and gave them an upw ard view of the light . Som e of the more a dve nturous spirits climbed up the vine, and found themselves in a love ly region full of buffaloes, and rich with every kind of fruit. From this they returned with the grapes they had gathered, like the men who had gone forth to spy out the land in anot her "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"632 version of the mythos . Their fellow - count rym en were so delight ed with the taste of their newly - found fruit that men, wom en, and children determined to leave their low er earth and ascend to the uppe r by means of the grape - vine. But when the peopl e wer e about half - way, a corpul ent wom an who was clambering up the vine broke it with her weight . This closed the aperture upon herself and the rest of the nation, and shut out the light of the sun. But when the Manda ns die, they expe ct to return to this, the o riginal count ry of their forefathers, the good reaching the ancient village of the vine by means of the lake which the wicked will not be able to cross by reason of the bur den of their sins (Lewis and Clarke). This land of the forefathers was that of the a ncestral spirits, the count ry of the tree of life, here identified with the vine. The subt erranean lake is one with the lake in Tattu. The corpulent wom an is the Great Mother, who was the enceinte Apt or Hathor in Egypt , whos e tree is the sycamore - fig. The doubl e - earth is the same as in the ritual. Cons eque ntly the vine is the tree of dawn up which the sun and soul s ascende d from the Tuat by means of the tree. The exodus from the nether - earth, or Low er Egypt , is the same as in the Hebrew and other versions of the mythos , the original of which is prova bly Egypt ian. The Quiché “Popu l Vuh” portrays the ancestors of the race as wande rers in the wilderness upon their way to the place where the sun was to rise. They also crossed the water, which divided whilst the y passed, and which they went through just as if there had been no sea. They passed on the scattered rocks rolled on the sands , that served for steppi ng - stone s. This is why the place was called “range d stone s and torn - up sands ,” the name that was given to it on their passage through the waters that divided as they went. “At last they came to a mount ain where, as they had been told, they were to see the sun rise for the first time” (Bancroft, vol . III, p. 51) . This was the mount of glory in the solar mythos , and the waters which were crossed were thos e of the celestial Nun. The “range d stone s” in the waters correspond to the twelve stones that were set up by Joshua to mark the spot where the waters were held up for the Israelites to pass dry - foot ed through th e river Jordan. In the Hawaiian tradition the king of the count ry, named Honua - i - lalo, was the oppr essor of the Menehune peopl e. Their god Kane sent Kane - Apua and Kanaloa the elder brother to bring away the oppr essed peopl e, and take them to a land which K ane their god had given them. The legend further tells how they came to the Red Sea of Kane, Kai - ula - a - Kane, and were pur sued by Ke - Alii Wahanui . Thereupon Kane - Apua and Kanaloa prayed to Lono, and then they waded safely through the sea, and wande red in th e desolate wilderness unt il at last they reached the prom ised land of Kane, called “Aina - Lauena - a - Kane.” This, says Fornande r, is an ancient legend, which also cont ains the story of water being made to gus h forth from a rock (Fornande r, An Account of the P olynesian Race ). The passage of the Red Sea and the destruction of thos e who follow the fugi tives are also found in a Hottentot fable. Heitsi - Eibib was onc e travelling with a great num ber of his peopl e, when they were pur sued by the enemy. On arriving at the water which 633 had to be crossed as the onl y way of escape, the leader said, “My grandf ather’s father! ope n thys elf that I may pass through, and close thyself afterwards.” So it took place as he"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"had said, and they crossed the water safely. Then the pur suing enemy tried to pass through the ope ning likewise, but when they were in the midst of the divided water it closed upon them and they perished. (Bleek, Hottentot Fabl es, p. 75. ) In this the personi fication of the water as the first father, God the g randf ather, is in accordance with the Egypt ian Nnu or celestial water, who is represented as the primordial male divinity, the father of the fathers, includi ng Ra the solar god . The Nnu or Nun identifies the water as celestial, and it is this that divides to let the sun - god and his follow ers pass through dryshod. These in the Ritual are pur sued by the Apap and the Sebau to the edge of the hor izon. Then the water of day ove rwhelms the powers of darkne ss, and Apap the dragon with all his evil hos t are ove rthr ow n, subm erged, and drow ned in the waters of the low er Nun (Rit., ch. 39) . They are described in the “Magic Papyr us” as the “immerged,” who do not “pass,” or go along, but remain floating on the waters like dead bodi es drifting on the inunda tion; with thei r mout hs for ever shut and sealed ( Records, vol . X, 151) . In anot her version of the Hottentot legend a Nama wom an and her brothers are pur sued by an elepha nt. “Stone of my ancestors,” cry the fleeing one s, “divide for us.” The stone ope ns and they pass. Th e pursuer used the same words, and the rock ope ned for him also, but it closed on the elepha nt and crushed it to death (Bleek, Hottentot Fabl es, pp. 64, 65) . The fable can be read by means of the Egypt ian wisdom . It belongs to the war that was waged for ev er betwixt the pow ers of darkne ss and light . In the Egypt ian mythos the pur suing mons ter as the Apap - dragon of the deep, in place of the elepha nt, pur sues the children of light who are escaping from the unde r - world. They reach the rock of the hor izon or th e Tser - hill, which ope ns for the “com ing forth” and closes again when the pur sued one s have passed through in safety. Shu= Moses stands upon the rock to smite it with his rod, with the result that the waters of day gus h forth in light . This is the water of heaven set flow ing from the rock of the hor izon for thos e who are follow ed by the Apap - reptile of darkne ss and cons um ing drought . The sun - god in the Ritual stagge rs forth upon the mount with many wounds , but Apap is caught and crushed and cut up piecemeal in the place appoi nted for the dragon to be drow ned in the red lake of the mythos (Rit., ch. 39) . Through this Red Sea the follow s of Ra, of Heitsi - Eibib, or Jehova h, pass in trium ph on their way to the land of prom ise on the moun t of glory. But the hos ts of evil are cont inua lly ove rthrow n. The starting - poi nt of the Manga ian migration was from Savaiki in the shades. The natives of the Penrhyns speak of goi ng dow n to Savaiki in death, and they say their first ancestors came up as heaven - bur sters from the sa me count ry. All such origins are mythical, not historical or geogr aphi cal, although the mystical land gets localised on the surface of the earth as it is in the heptanom is of the Hervey Isles. Savaiki was know n as the hom e of the ancestors, but the onl y an cestors first know n were the ancestral spirits, and it was these as manes that sought deliverance from the unde r - world. In one of 634 the traditions the Egypt ians were reput ed to com e from the land of Puanta, the Ta - neter or count ry of the gods , the land of glory, or the gol den land. When it is said to the sun - god , “Ador ation to thee who arisest out of the gol den,” it means out of Puanta, the nether - land of dawn (Rit., ch. 15, hym n 1). This land of the gods as a mythical locality was in the unde r - world, n ot on the surface of our earth; it is not the Puanta that was geogr aphi cal in"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"the sout h. The peopl e from Puanta, the land of the gods , are thos e who had a solar origin. They issue from the land of glory with the sun. The gods and the glorified came up from this divine land when they emerged from Puanta in the Orient. One title of the first chapter in the Ritual is “The chapter of introduc ing the mum my into the Tuat on the day of bur ial.” This appl ies to the mum my interred on earth, and also to the Osiris o r manes in Amenta, who was figur ed in the mum my - form. The Tuat is a place of entrance to and egress from the unde r - world. And in the Pyramid Texts (Pepi, I. 185) thos e who are in the Tuat are called the Tuat a. Now , as the Tuat was in Tanen, the land (ta) b eneath the waters of the Nen, they are the Tuat a - Tane n, in whom we propos e to identify the Irish mythical heroes or divine ancestors called the Tuatha de Danan. In the oldest account of the Tuatha it is said they came from heaven. Therefore their origin wa s not hum an. In issuing from the Tuat of Amenta they came from the low er paradise of two from which they brought the wisdom and the sym bol s of the Egypt ians as their sacred treasures, includi ng the four precious things belongi ng to the Tuatha de Danan. The Tuatha are described as the gods and the not - gods , a title that exactly corresponds to the Egyp tian two classes of spirits called the gods and glorified. According to Giraldus in his Topogr aphi a Hibernia, it was a gue ss of the learned that the Tuatha “wer e of the num ber of the exiles driven out of heaven,” and if they were of thos e who came from the land of prom ise and issued from the Tuat, they woul d com e from the subt erranean Aarru or earthly paradise. The hills and mounds of Erin are the places of entra nce to and exit from the invi sible world of elfin - land, which answers to the hidde n earth of the manes in Amenta. When euhe merised by tradition, the Tuatha de Danan are said to have retired into the hills and mounds after they were utterly defeated in batt le. In other legends Dagda and his sons were onc e the rulers ove r this nether - land, and they are said to lie bur ied there with “the síd or fairy - moun d of the brugh as cove ring for their resting - place” (Rhys ). The brugh was originally the place of burial. H e who sleeps at Philae is he who sleeps in the brugh , the bur gh, or bur y. The name written in hierogl yphi cs is Piruk= brugh , and there the mum my slept in the bur gh of Amenta, or with the Tuata in the Tuat of the nether - world. The divine mother of the Tuatha is know n by the name of Danan. The Tuatha are the tribe or peopl e of the godde ss Danan, who is also the deëss of death. Now , there is an Egypt ian godde ss Tanan who is a form of Hathor =the amorous que en in the earth of Tanen, the land of the noc turnal sun and the dom ain of the dead. The god Tanen is lord of that land, and the godde ss is identified with Hathor by her headdr ess. The name of Tanan may also be written Tann. This agrees 635 with the naming of the Welsh and Irish godde ss Danu or Danan. Her name s takes the form of Don in Welsh, and the deities who descend from her, like Gwydi on and Arianrhod, are called the children of Don. The Tuatha de Danan are also termed the Fir Déa, or men of the godde ss. Hence we propos e to identify the godde ss Tanen with Danan or Danu, the Great Mother of the Tuatha de Danan, who were the peopl e of the godde ss as the soul s of the dead in the divine Neter - Kar, i.e. in Tanen, and who issued from the Tuat with the sun or solar god as the men of the Godde ss, who was Tanan in E gypt , Danan in Ireland, and Don in Britain. The men of the godde ss, as we sugge st, were the Tuata of the Pyramid Texts, who as divine ancestors becom e the Irish Tuatha de Danan."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The same word is represented by the Irish Tuath for the tribe; Breton Tud, Got hic Thiuda , Saxon Theod, for a peopl e; the Oscan Tauta for a com muni ty; it is also extant in the name of the Teutons . One of the chief attribut es of the Tuatha de Danan is the pow er they have of assum ing any form at will, and this is a supr eme trait of tho se who com e forth when the Tuat is ope ned (Rit., ch. 2). Chapter 64 is the one by which the Tuata take all forms that each desireth, whether on entering or com ing forth from this wom b of Amenta. The transformation of the manes has com e to be called shape - s hifting, but there is no beginni ng with it as a faculty of the wizards in Ireland. There are various hints in the Irish fairy - lore of the Tuatha de Danan being one with the spirits of the dead. Their relation to the prehistoric mounds is the same as that o f the Tuata with the moun t of Amenta. There is also a still prevailing conf usion in the Irish mind betwixt the fairies and the ghos ts, which is very natural when we know that the fairies originated in the spirits of the elements which have got mixed up wit h the manes of the dead. According to Cæsar, the Druids taught the Gauls that they were all descende d from Dis Pater, the Demiurge — that is, from the god of Hades or Amenta, who is Tanan as cons ort of the godde ss, and whos e name was taken by Ptah - Tanan, the better know n Dis Pater, who was earlier than Osiris in the Egypt ian cult, and from whom the solar race ascende d, whether from Puanta or from the Tuat. Thus interpreted, the Tuatha or tribes who brought the ancient wisdom out of Low er Egypt or the Tuat may have been genui ne Egypt ians after all, as the much - derided traditions of the Keltæ and the Kym ry yet allege and strenuous ly maintain. “The oasis of Tuaut” is anot her bit of ancient Egypt still surviving in the count ry of Morocco, where it testifies, like som e strange boul der on the surface, to the bur ied past. The birthpl ace of the stellar races was in the celestial nor th. The solar race were they who came forth from the East. In goi ng dow n to Amenta, as manes, they were the westerners; in com ing forth th ey are the easterners. Thus , when we are told that Abraham came from Ur of the Kasdim, or the Magi, which was his birthpl ace, that goe s far to identify him as a solar god , just as Laban, the white one , was a luna r deity, and Ur a mythical locality. Ur is a n Egypt ian name for that which is eldest, first, great, principal. The cour se of the sun - god by day is reckone d to run from Ta - Ur to Am - Ur, i.e. from east to west. Ta - Ur then is Egyp tian for the land of the east, and the migration thence is solar, that is – mythical, – and woul d be astronom ical when the 636 birthpl ace is designa ted “Ur of the Kasdim” or Chaldees. Ur of the Kasdim is self - identified by name with the Magi, astrologe rs or astronom ers. Moreove r, the freque nt coupl ing of Ur and Martu in the astrol ogi cal tablets poi nts to Ur as a name for the east being juxt apos ed to Martu for the west, “Ur and Martu” meaning east and west, and not Ur a city on earth and Martu a qua rter in the heavens. It has been poi nted out by translators that various place - names in the Egypt ian Book of the Dead denot e celestial localities, and are not geogr aphi cal. They are names in the astronom ical mythol ogy which had been first derived from Egypt on earth, that were afterwards appl ied to Uppe r Egypt in heaven and Low er Egypt in Amenta. The heaven above and Amenta below were divided into Uppe r and Low er Egypt . The Egypt ian cities of Thinis, Hermopol is, Memphi s, Thebes, Annu, and others were repeated in the planisphe re as mythical localities which furnish place - names for the escha tology in the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Ritual. When Osiris trium phs , and “joy goe th its round in Thinis,” that is the celestial, not the earthly city (Rit., ch. 18). When the deceased in Amenta exclaims, “May Sekhe t the Divine One lift me up so that I may arise in heaven and issue my behest in Memphi s” (Rit., ch. 26) , it is the heavenly Memphi s, the celestial Ha - ka - Ptah, or spirit hous e of Ptah, the enclosure of the white wall on high, that is meant. When the priest says in the first chapter of the Ritual, “I baptize with water in Tattu, and anoi nt with oil in Abydos ,” the scene of the baptism is in Amenta, not on earth. Rekhe t, the place where the two divine sisters waited and wept for the lost Osiris, was a locality in the earth of eternity, but Rekhe t was also geogr aphi cal in Egy pt. At first the localities, as Egypt ian, were topog raphi cal, next they were cons tellated as uranogr aphi cal, and finally they cons tituted a doubl e Egypt of the other world in the earth and heaven of eternity. The Egypt ian Exodus is a mystery of Amenta. I t is described in the Ritual as the Peri - em - heru or “com ing forth to day” from “the Hades of Egypt and the desert” ( Records, vol . X, p. 109) . Thus when Horus com es forth in his resurrection it is said that “Egypt and the desert are at peace” (Rit., ch. 183 ). Egypt and the desert were the two parts in the doubl e - earth that was divided between Sut and Horus, betwixt whom was internecine war that onl y ende d temporarily at the com ing of the prince of peace who came to set the prisone rs free from the land of bon dage, of drought and darkne ss, of Apap and the plague s of Egypt in the unde r - world. The sufferers depicted in the mythos were at first the stars that fell dow n headlong into the abys s to be swallow ed by the dragon , of whom it is said, “Eternal Devour er is his name” (Rit., ch. 17) . This was in the astronom ical mythol ogy. In the eschatology the prisone rs are the manes or body - soul s of the dead who passed into Amenta, the earth of eternity, as it were by way of the grave. Both were the children of light , myth ical or eschatologi cal, otherwise the children of Ra, at war for ever with the creatures of darkne ss in the nether - earth. The exodus or com ing forth from 637 this nether Egypt is represented astronom ically on the great Mende s Stele. On one side Horus Beh utet, the great god, lord of heaven and giver of life, is described as com ing “out of the hor izon on the side of Uppe r Egypt,” and on the other side of the Stele “the com ing out of Low er Egypt” is spoke n of instead. That is the exodus from Kheb or Low er Eg ypt , which is Amenta in the eschatology ( Records, vol . VIII, 91) . This is the exodus from Egypt of the low er earth according to the representation in the solar mythos that preceded the version in the eschatology by which it was follow ed and enforced. In th e making of Amenta the Egypt ians mappe d out Egypt in the nether - world in accordance with Egypt on earth, onl y on a vaster scale. They had their Low er and Uppe r Egypt s in the other life as they had in this. But Khebt, the Egypt ian original of the Greek Egup tos, is more expr essly the Low er Egypt , hence the low er of the two Egypt s in the mythical representation. This was the Egypt below , through which the noc turnal sun and the soul s of the deceased passed on their way up to the land of liberty and light . This was the Egypt where the Lord (as Osiris, or the elder Horus) was crucified in the Tat (Rev. XL. 8), or where the solar god suffered his mortal agony , his death and bur ial; the Egyp t from which he rose again. Here was the wilderness of the wande rings dur ing the forty days of the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Egypt ian Lent, which represented the forty days of the seed that was bur ied in the earth to attain the new life in the regermination of Osiris, which forty days were disgui sed as forty years in the historic version of the Jewish exod us. It is unf ortuna te and humiliating to us as a nation that Egypt ology and Assyriology in England shoul d have first fallen into the hands of devout believers in the biblical “history.” Archæ ology had to call itself “biblical” in order that a society might be founde d for the study of Egypt ology and Assyriology, and Egypt ian expl oration was for a long time limited to looki ng for “biblical sites” in Egypt , which are only to be met with as mythical localities in Amenta. Nor is this mania of the historic - minde d yet entirely extinct! Jewish or Gentile com mentators who know not hing of the astronom ical mythol ogy , or the Egypt ian origin of the Hebrew legends , have never been able to appl y the com parative method to these writings . There is but one Egyp t for them. But there was anot her Lower Egypt , anot her Red Sea, anot her dragon, anot her deliverance from Rahab and the Apap - mons ter, and anot her exodus , which have not hitherto been taken into account by the Hebraists. It was not to Egypt topogr aphi cally that the ransom e d of the Lord were to return singi ng the songs of Zion. There is anot her and a truer version of these mystical matters pos sible, even as there was of old. The creation of Amenta in the Egypt ian mythos has been already expl ained as the work of Ptah and the seven Knemmu or navvi es who were his assistants in ope ning up the unde r - world, and who in the Hebrew rende ring becom e the seven princes that digge d the well, referred to in one of the fragm ents of ancient lore (Num . XXI. 18) , which seven princes in the Se mitic legends are identified with the chariot of the Lesser Bear. Amenta was a second terra firma for the soul s of the departed, a mental fulcrum to the eye of faith laid on the phys ical founda tion of the solar mythol ogy for 638 thos e who travelled the e ternal road. Thus the origin of the exodus , as Egyp tian, was in the com ing forth of the heavenly bodi es from below the hor izon in the mythical representation. This was follow ed by the com ing forth of the manes from dark to day, from death to life, from bon dage to liberty, from Low er to Uppe r Egypt in the eschatology. In the com ing forth of the Israelites from “the Hades of Egypt and the desert,” it is said the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud , to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light : that they might go by day and by night : the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night departed not from before the peopl e” (Ex. XIII. 21, 22). It is pos sible that the zodi acal light suppl ied a natural image for the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire described in the book of Exodus . The zodi acal light is a phe nom enon visible in Egypt at certain seasons of the year. It is seen as a coni cal pillar of cloud tow ards the east in the morning, just before sunr ise, and t ow ards the west at suns et. In the pale light of dawn it is a pillar of cloud, and in the ruddy glow of sundow n it becom es a veritable pillar of fire. It is said of the Great One God, “the living one , who liveth everlastingl y,” and who was Atum - Huhi in his temple at On, “He traverseth the heavens, and com passeth the nether - world each day; he travels in the cloud to separ ate heaven and earth, and aga in to uni te them” — that is, at morn and evening in making the passage of Amenta. The “Lord of the Cloud” is also addr essed as the gui de of navigation. The flame of the sun is the protection of thos e who cross the doub le - earth. He"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"who “com mands heaven causes his disk to appe ar in the desert” (Rit., 99) . “He who pur ifies the water” “appe ars on the liqui d abys s” (101) . “He marches for the dead; for thos e who are ove rturned” (L.). The ope ning chapters of the Book of the Dead are called the Peri - em - hru or com ing forth to day. In other words, this was the Kamite exodus of the manes from Amenta in the eschatologi cal pha se o f the mythos , which has been conve rted by literalization into the “history” found in the boo k of Exodus . The Hebrew märchen are the legenda ry remains of the Egypt ian mythos , whether in the book of Genesis or the book of Exodus . The “com ing forth to day” wi th which the Ritual ope ns is the Egypt ian exodus , and the Hebrew exodus is likewise the coming forth to day. An entrance to the mythical Amenta, previous ly show n, was localized at Abydos as the cleft or the mout h of the rock, a narrow gor ge in the Libya n range of hills. Oppos ite this entrance stood the temple of Osiris Khent - Amenta, a name which denot es the ope ning to the interior of Amenta. Through this gor ge the solar bark passed into the mount ain of the west, and bor e the image of the dying solar god on boa rd. Once a year also there was a feast of the dead, or, as we have it in survival, of All Soul s, and there came a fune ral flotilla to the mout h of the cleft on one of the first night s of the year. This answers in the mythos to the starting - poi nt in tim e of the Jewish exodus as history, in the first mont h of the year. Two ways of entering the other world are represented in two different categor ies of the ancient legend, bot h of which are derived from the same funda mental origin. One is by means of the d ividing 639 waters, the other by means of the passage that ope ns and closes in the earth at evening or in the equi nox. In the Egypt ian mythos the entrance to Amenta is bot h by land and water. The god on boa rd the solar bark, or the children of Ra=Israel on boa rd the bark of soul s, passed through the clove n rock by water. Previous ly the water had to be divided for the travellers to pass. But the waters thus divided were celestial, being mythical. They are the waters divided by Shu - Anhur with his rod as lea der of the manes from Amenta up to heaven. It is not written in the Old Testament what the Lord did for Israel in the vale of Arnon, but the Targum of Jerusalem tells us that when the Beni - Israel were passing through the gorge or defile, the Moabites were hidde n in the caverns of the valley, intendi ng to rush out and slay them. But the Lord signe d to the mount ains, and they literally laid their heads toge ther to prevent it; they closed upon the enemy with a clap, and crushed the chiefs of the might y one s, s o that the valleys were ove rflow ed with the blood of the slain. Meanw hile Israel walked ove r the tops of the hills, and kne w not the miracle and the might y act which the Lord was doi ng in the valley of the Arnon . Thus the miracle of the Red Sea was reverse d. In the one case the waters stood up in heaps and were turned into hills; in the other the solid hills flow ed dow n and were fused, whilst Israel passed ove r them as if they were a level plain. In the one miracle the Red Sea was turned into dry ground; in the other the dry ground was turned into a red sea of blood . The hills that rushed toge ther to make a level plain are a familiar figur e of the equi nox, to be found in varied forms of legenda ry lore (Book of Beginni ngs , vol . II, pp. 356 - 357 ). This account therefore is as good as the biblical one, and it tends to prove that bot h belong to the astronom ical mythos , and that the crossing here was in the equi nox."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" In the mythos of Amenta the promised land of plenty, the land of corn and wine and oil, was the Aar ru - field of divine harvest that awaited the right eous who had been wande rers in the wilderness and who fought their way to it through all the obs tacles of the unde r - world. These obs tacles can still be traced in the Jewish narrative com pared with the books of Amenta and the mysteries of Taht. All through the jour ney of this Egypt unde rground, the obj ects besought and fervently prayed for are a good passage through the waters and all other hindrances, and a safe way out upon the eastern side, where lay the pr om ised land. One great obj ect of the manes in know ing the words of great magical pow er in Amenta is to obt ain com mand ove r the waters. The deceased prays that he may have com mand ove r the waters which he has to pass through, even as Sut had com mand of forc e on the “night of the great disaster” (Rit., chs. 57 and 62). These waters are the Red Sea of the Jewish exodus , in which the Apap - dragon lurks and lies in wait. The later schol iasts tell us that the habitation of this mons ter was the Red Sea. Thus the Re d Sea is identifiable with the lake of Putrata in which the dragon lurked that lived upon the drow ned, the dragon that was turned into the cruel Pharaoh in the Hebrew version of the exodus . It is evident that the Jews were in pos session of an esoteric ren dering of the same mystical matter as is presented exot erically in the books ascribed to Moses. There were two versions of the dark 640 sayings and the hidde n wisdom , the esoteric and the exot eric, amongs t them, as there were amongs t the Egypt ians, and t hese have doubl ed the conf usion. The Christian world has based its structure of belief simply and solely on the exot eric version; thus the doo r of the past just now being ope ned anew in Egypt was closed to them and locked; they were left out side without th e key, and in the darkne ss of the grossest, crassest ignor ance the Christian faith was founde d. We have now to recove r such “history” as is pos sible from the Pentateuch by eliminating the mythos and the eschatology. Fragm ents of the original mythos crop up in the Hagga dot h, the Kabalah, the Talmud, and other Hebrew writings , which tend to show that in the earlier time and low ermost strata the sam e matter had been know n to the Jews themselves as non - historical. Thus it is prova ble and will be prove d that “bi blical history” has been mainly derived from misappr opr iated and misinterpreted mythol ogy, and that the mythol ogy is demons trably Egypt ian which can onl y be expl ained in accordance with the Egypt ian wisdom . This is not to say that the books of Genesis, Exo dus , and Joshua are intentiona l forgeries, but that the data were already more or less extant as subj ect - matter of the mysteries, and that an exot eric version of the ancient wisdom has been rende red in the form of historic narrative and ethni cally appl ied to the Palestinian Jews. The most learned of the Rabbi s have most truthfully and persistently maintained that the books attribut ed to Moses do but cont ain an exot eric expl anation of the secret wisdom , though they may not trace the gnos is to its Egypt ian so urce. The chief teachers have always insisted on the allegor ical nature of the Pentateuch. Two laws, they tell us, were delivered to Moses on Mount Sinai. One was com mitted to writing, as in the Pentateuch; the other was transmitted orally from generation to generation, as is acknow ledge d by the Psalmist when he says, “I will ope n my mout h in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old, which we have heard and know n"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"and our fathers have told us.” Parables and dark sayings of old are the allegor ies of mythol ogy and enigm as of the ancient wisdom uttered after the manne r of the mysteries. Now the subj ect of this psalm is the story of Israel in Egypt and the exodus from the old dark land. The plague s of Egyp t are described. “He set his sign in Egypt ; he turned t heir rivers into blood. ” “He sent them swarms of flies which devour ed them, and frogs which destroye d them.” He also gave their increase to the caterpillar and their labour to the locust. He killed their vines with hail and their sycamore - trees with frost, and “smote all the first - born in Egypt .” The com ing forth is also described. The Psalmist tells of the marvellous things that were done “in the land of Egypt .” How the Lord “clove the sea” and “caused them to pass through” whilst the waters were made “to stand as an heap.” How he led them forth with a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night. How he clove the rock in the wilderness “and gave them drink abunda ntly as out of the depths,” and “ope ned the door s of heaven” and “rained dow n manna upon them to eat.” This was heard and know n orally as a tale that is told in dark sayings of old which did not originate in the biblical history of the exodus . They are “tried as silver is tried” in the refineries of the nether - earth. They go “through fire and throug h water,” and are “brought out into 641 a place of abunda nce” in the pleasant Aarru fields. This jour ney is described in various psalms. “Working salvation in the midst of the earth, thou didst divide (or break up) the sea by thy strengt h; thou breakest t he heads of the dragons in the waters. Thou breakest the heads of Leviathan in pieces” (Ps. LXXIV. 12 - 14) . In the Hebrew Song of Moses we are in the same nether - earth, where the matter is eschatologi cal. The adve rsaries are the same oppone nts of the chos en peopl e — the same, that is, in the book of Deuterono my as in the Book of the Dead. Ezekiel (XX. 36) makes an allusion to “the wilderness of the land of Egypt,” which poi nts to the low er Egypt of the mythos in Amenta. Egypt itself, as the land of the living, the cultivable land, was the very oppos ite of the wilderness. Amenta in the Book of Hades, and also in the Ritual, is described as cons isting of two parts, called “Egypt and the desert land or wilderness.” This latter was the dom ain of Sut in the Osirian mysteries. One part of the dom ain, named Anrutef, is self - described as the place where not hing grow s. It was a desert of fruitless, leafless, root less sand, in which “there was no water for the peopl e to drink” or, if any, the water was made bitter or sal t by the adve rsary Sut or the Apap - dragon. The struggl e of Sut and Horus (or Osiris) in the desert lasted forty days, as these were com memorated in the forty days of the Egypt ian Lent, during which time Sut as the pow er of drought and sterility made war on Horus in the water and the bur ied germinating grain. Meantime “the flocks of Ra” were famishing for lack of pasture and for want of water in the wilderness. These forty days spent in the desert of the mythos have conf essedly been extende d into the forty y ears of the history. They were the forty days of suffering in the wilderness of the unde r - world which lay betwixt the autum n and the vernal equi nox. And when it is threatened by Ihuh that onl y the children shall go forth with Joshua , it is said, “Your chil dren shall be wande rers in the wilderness even forty day s, for every day a year” (Num . XIV. 33, 34) . The low er Egypt of Amenta was a land of dearth and darkne ss to the manes. It was the dom ain of Sut at the entrance in the west. Here was the typi cal wilde rness founde d on the sands that envi rone d Egypt . Aarru or the garden far to the eastward was"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"an oasis in the desert ready for the manes who were fortuna te enough to reach that land of prom ise. The dom ain of Sut was a place of plague s; all the terrors of na ture were congr egated there, includi ng drought and famine, fiery flying serpents and uni maginable mons ters. There were the hells of heat in which the waters were on fire; there were the slime - pits, the blazing bitum en, and brimstone flames of Sodom and Gom orrah. The desert of engul fing sands , the lakes of fire, and the deluge of ove rwhelming waters had to be crossed, and all the pow ers of death and hell oppos ed the passage of the glorified elect, the chos en peopl e of the Lord, who were bound for bliss in th e land where their redemption dawned upon the sum mit of the mount . This then was the land of bonda ge where the manes were in direst need of a deliverer. The typical tyrant and taskm aster in the Hebrew “history” has never been identified on earth, and it ma y be som ewhat difficult to identify him in Amenta, but it is not impos sible. The devour er of the peopl e in that land takes several forms. The Apap - 642 mons ter lies in wait and has to be encount ered at the entrance to the valley of the shadow of death. B ut there is one typi cal devou rer. The Red Sea is his dw elling - place, and “eternal devour er is his name.” Anot her of his names is Mates, the hard, cruel, flinty - hearted. He is described as having the skin of a man and the face of a hound. His dw elling is in the red lake of fire, where he lives upon the shades of the damned and eats the livers of princes. As he com es from the Red Sea, his ove rthrow al is in the Red Sea, like the ove rwhelming of Pharaoh and his hos t. The same typi cal devour er has anot her figur e in the judgm ent hall, where it is named Amemit. Here it has the head of a crocodi le. Where we might speak of the jaws of death, hell, or destruction, the Egypt ians said or show ed the jaws of the crocodi le. Thos e who are conde mned to be devour ed pass into the jaws of the devour er. Thus the crocodi le is the devour er, the typi cal tyrant, the cruel, hard - hearted mons ter who bars the gate of exit and will not let the suffering peopl e go up from the land of bonda ge. When the manes seeks his place of refuge in Am enta or in the Ammah (Rit., ch. 72) , he prays for deliverance from the crocodi le in the land of bonda ge. He also says, “Let not the pow ers of darkness (the Sebau) have the mastery ove r me,” and he prays that he may reach the divine dw elling which has been prepared for him in the Aarru - fields of peace and plenty, where there is corn of unt old qua ntity in that land tow ard which his face is set. This is the chapter “by which one com eth forth to day and passeth through Ammah or the Ammah” in seeking deliverance from the crocodi le or dragon in the land of bonda ge. Protection is sought in Ammah because the god who dw ells there in everlasting light is the ove rthrow er of the crocodi le. The crocodi le is the dragon of Egypt to the Hebrew scribes, who use it as an imag e of the Pharaoh. When Ezekiel writes, “Thus saith the Lord God: Behol d, I am against thee, Pharaoh, King of Egypt , the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers,” the imagery is derived from the Egypt of Amenta, how ever it may be afterwards appl i ed. The great dragon, as typi cal devour er in the land of bonda ge, is here identified with the Pharaoh of Egypt , as it also has been in the book of Exodus . Amenta is spoke n of at least onc e in the Ritual as the place wherein the living are destroye d. It is also described as the Kâsu or bur ial - place. One of the twelve divisions of this unde r - world was know n as “the sandy realm of Sekari,” the place of interment. The"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"dead were bur ied unde rneath their mounds in this dom ain of Sekari, which was a wilderness of sand. This is the proba ble origin of the wilderness full of bur ied corpses in the book of Num bers. For, after all the prom ises made to the children of Israel, they are sudde nly turned upon by the Lord and told that their carcases shall fall in this wildern ess. “Your little one s will I bring in, but as for you, you r carcases shall fall in this wilderness” (Num . XIV. 31, 32) . Now , the carcases that were to rot in the wilderness are equi valent to the mum mies bur ied in the sandy realm of Osiris - Sekari, god of t he coffin and the desert sand. In the Kamite eschatology thos e who made the exodus from Amenta to the world of day are thos e who rise from the dead in the desert called “the sandy realm of Sekari”=the wilderness. Moreove r, they rise again as children who a re 643 called “the youngl ings of Shu. ” And Shu was the leader and forerunne r of this new generation of divine beings , called his “youngl ings ,” from the “sandy realm of Sekari,” when their redemption from that land of bonda ge dawned (Rit., ch. 55) . The wi lderness of the nether - earth being a land of graves, this gives an adde d signi ficance to the que stion asked of Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt , hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness?” (Ex. XIV. 11), which as the domain of Osiris - Se kari was depicted as a cemetery of sand, where the dead awaited the coming of Horus, Shu, Ap - uat (or Anup ), the gui de, and Taht, the luna r light , as servants of Ra, the supr eme one god , to wake them in their coffins and lead them from this land of darkne ss to the land of day. Amenta, as the place of graves, is freque ntly indi cated in the Hebrew scriptures, as in the description of the great typi cal burial - place in the valley of Hamon - Gog. This was in the Egypt described in the book of Revelation as the city of dead carcases, where also their lord was crucified as Ptah - Sekari or Osiris - Tat. Amenta had been conve rted into a cemetery by the death and bur ial of the solar god , who was represented as the mum my in the low er Egypt of the nether - earth. The manes were likewise imaged as mum mies in their coffins or beneath their mounds of sand. They also rose again in the mum my - likeness of their lord, and went up out of Egypt in the cons tellation of the Mum my (Sahu - Orion) , or in the coffin of Osiris that was imaged in t he Greater Bear. In the Ritual the pow er of darkne ss called “the devour er of the ass,” which was a solar zoot ype , is Am - ā - ā , the great, great devour er by name. Am signi fies the devour er, of whom it is said eternal devour er is his name (Rit., ch. 17). This Am - ā - ā , the great, great devour er, is appa rently the Amalek of the biblical legend: Melek, the lord of rule, being suffi xed to the name of Am, to describe the character. “Then came Amalek and fought with Israel in Rephi dim,” in the region of the Repha im, Sheol or Amenta (Ex. XVII. 8). “The Lord hath sworn he will have war with Amalek from generation to generation. ” These ar e the two great oppone nts, who were Apap, the devour er of the ass, and Ra in the wars of Amenta. The wars of the lord, as Egypt ian, were waged against the adve rsaries of Ra or Osiris in Amenta. These adve rsaries were the pow ers of evil, the Apap - dragon of drought , the serpent of darkne ss, the Sebau, the Sami, toge ther with Sut and his co - cons pirators in the later rende ring of the mythos . The adve rsaries of the Good Being are anni hilated in the tank of flame (ch. I). Osiris is thus addr essed: “Hail to thee, the great, the might y, whos e enemies are laid prostrate at their blocks! Hail to thee, who slaught erest the Sebau and anni hilatest Apap! Thou hast utterly destroye d all the enemies"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"of Osiris” (Rit., ch. 15). Chapter 18 is in celebration of the trium ph of O siris ove r all his adve rsaries, who are slaught ered and destroye d. The great slaught er of the adve rsaries is carried out in the nether - world (ch. 41) or secret earth of Amenta, at a place called Suten - Khen. Also the plague s of Egypt had previous ly been let loos e by the Lord on Abram’s account . “And the Lord plague d Pharaoh with great plague s” before “Abram went up out of Egypt ” (Gen. XXI. 17; XIII. 1). This is a bit of the same myth of Amenta, which was earlier than the 644 Mosaic exodus . The scenery of S odom and the pits of bitum en may be found in the Ritual, toge ther with the night of reckoni ng, which is the “night of fire against the ove rthrow n, the night of chaining the wicked in their hells, the night on which their vital principles are destroye d” (Ri t., 17) . In the Hebrew version this “reckoni ng” on the fatal night when the Typhoni ans (or Sodom ites) were destroye d in the hells of fire and sulphur takes the shape of “reckoni ng, ” whether there are fifty, forty - five, forty, thirty, twenty, or ten right eo us persons to save the doom ed city from destruction (Gen. XVIII. 24 - 32). In the legend of the monke y, the god who repos es in Amenta and traverses the darkne ss and the shadow s, when he rises gives up the pig to the plague (Book of Hades). Now the pig was a type of the evil Typhon. In one of the pictures a pig called the devou rer of the arm (of Osiris) is being driven by the monke y, which was a luna r zoot ype . Thus the pig which is here given to the plague s show s that in the true mythos the plague s of Egypt we re let loos e on the Typhoni ans or pow ers of evil, the Sebau, the Sami, the cons pirators of Sut, the children of darkne ss, whether from a phys ical or moral poi nt of view, and that this was in the low er Egypt of Amenta. These in the Hebrew version have been transformed into ethni cal Egyp tians who so cruelly oppr essed and preyed upon the suffering Israelites. Thus the plague s of Egypt occurred twice ove r in a land which was not the Egypt of the Pharaohs , and the peopl e who suffered from them were not Egyp tians . This agrees with the hidde n gnos is in the Wisdom of Solom on, and also in the book of Revelation, where the plague s are of the same mystical nature, but are onl y seven instead of ten in num ber. The “wilderness” was obvi ous ly a place or state in which the shoe s and clothes of the peopl e did not wear out . This was onl y pos sible to the manes in the desert of Amenta. The two regions of the clothed and unc lothed are named in relation to the judgm ent hall of Mati. The clothed and unc lothed are well - know n terms f or the elect and the rejected manes; the children of light and the offspring of darkne ss. In the trial scenes the spirits who are judge d to be sound and pur e are told that they may pass on as the clothed, whilst the conde mned are designa ted the unc lothed. Thus the clothed one s pass safely and freely through the desert region of the unc lothed. In the Hebrew version we read, “I have led you forty years in the wilderness, (and) your clothes are not waxen old upon you , and your shoe is not waxen old upon your f eet” (Deut. XXIX. 5). There can be no doubt about these being the divinely clothed and fed, as described in the Ritual, where they eat of the tahen and drink of the water made sweet by the tree of life, and pass, as the clothed, through the wilderness whic h is called the region of the naked. To say that the clothes and shoe s of God’ s ow n peopl e did not wear out during a period of forty years is a mode of show ing they were divinely made for everlasting wear, but not on earth, where now adays they wear out all too fast for Gentile as for Jew. Appa rently the Hebrew manna"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"represents the Egypt ian tahen which was given to the manes for food in the wilderness of Amenta. In passing through the desert or the region of the unc lothed, the manes tells of the tahen that w as given for sustenance (ch. 124) . So far as the tahen is 645 know n, it agrees well enough with the Hebrew manna . “When the dew that lay (on the ground) was gone up, behol d, upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoa r - frost on the ground, ” which was “like unto wafers made with hone y.” Wafers made of tahen were also eaten sacramentally as food of heaven in the Osirian eucharist. In the mystery of ope ning the mout h and of giving breath to the breathless one s in Amenta, the Egypt ia ns made use of an instrum ent called the ur - heka, or great magical pow er. It is som etimes a sinuous , serpent - like rod without the serpent’s head. At others it has the head of the serpent on it, uni ted with the head of a ram. Both ram and serpent were type s of the deity Khne f, who represented the breath of life or the spirit, Nef, Hebrew Nephe sh, which was assum ed to enter the Osiris when the mum my’s mout h was typi cally ope ned to inha le the breath of future existence. Here then is a magical rod that turned in to a serpent, which may be seen figur ed in the Vigne ttes to the Ritual as a form of the magical rod with which the mout h of the deceased was ope ned in the mysteries of Amenta. It is held by the tail in the hand of the magician or priest who performs the ce remony of apru, i.e., ope ning the mout h, in illustration of the chapters by which the mout h is ope ned in the nether - world (Vigne ttes to chs. 21, 22, 23). The rod is change d into a serpent at the time when the Lord is desirous for Moses to becom e his mout hp iece. Moses obj ects, whereupon the Lord asks, “Who hath made man’s mout h? Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mout h and teach thee what thou shalt speak.” The cont est ends in Moses having his ow n way, and in Aaron becom ing a mout h to Moses. Moses is t o take in his hand the rod wherewith he is to “do the signs ” (Ex. IV. 1 - 17) . Here then we identify the serpent - rod of the Egypt ian priests that was know n by name as the great magical pow er, and it was som etimes a rod, at others a serpent. This we take to be the original of that rod with which the tricks are played in the Hebrew märchen by the Lord God of Israel for the pur pos e of frightening Pharaoh. “And the Lord said unt o him (Moses), What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. And he said, Cast it o n the ground. And he cast it on the ground , and it became a serpent: and Moses fled from before it. And the Lord said unt o Moses, Put forth thine hand and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand and laid hol d of it, and it became a rod in his hand” (Ex. IV. 2 - 5). The type of great magical pow er is thus turned to account in astoni shing the natives and in giving lessons to the magicians of Egypt . In bot h scenes we have the ope ning of the mout h. In bot h we have the serpent - rod with which the signs and w onde rs are wrought . And it is adm itted that Pharaoh had wise men, sorcerers, “magicians of Egypt ,” who had rods which became serpents as type s of transformation. These rods are to be seen in the hands of the wise men portrayed in the Ritual, but not for an y such fool ’s play as is described in the book of Exodus . There are two serpents in Egypt ian sym bol ism — one is a type of evil, the other is the good serpent. One is the Apap of drought , darkness, and death or negation; the other is the Uræus - serpent of lif e, that was worn on the front lets of the gods and the glorified manes as a sign of protection and salvation or safety (ch. 34) . In"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 646 the chapter by which a person is not devour ed or bitten to death by the eater of the head, which is a snake, an appe al is addr essed to the solar Uræus as the sour ce of life, the flame which shineth on the forehead of the glorified. In the seventh abode there is a serpent named Retuk (the cartouc he in my copy reads Ruruk or Rerek), that lives on the manes and is said to “an nihilate their magical virtue” (149). The speaker says, “I am the master of enchantments” (149) . He is the magician, the prototype of Pharaoh’ s, who worked by enchantment (Ex. VII. 11) . The “fiery serpent” of the wilderness may be traced in this great serp ent of Amenta, whos e name is “dw eller in his flame.” How ever rende red, the hierogl yphi cs identify the mythical serpent of fire as the fiery serpent of the Hebrew märchen. The lifting up of the serpent can also be paralleled in the text when the speaker exc laims, “I am raised up to (or as) the serpent of the sun” — that is, the Uræus, the good serpent when com pared with Apap. The serpent Aker is joined to the noc turnal sun as he traverses the Amenta (or the wilderness) by night . Thus Aker, the serpent of fire, is the good serpent that is raised up as the fiery serpent in the exodus . The evil serpent Apap is then told that he must retreat before this upl ifted solar serpent (which accom panies the orb in the Egypt ian triad) and in presence of the revivifying sun. And in this way the mythos furnished matter for the märchen and the folk - tales about the evil serpents that bit the wande ring Israelites, and how they were saved and healed by an image of the good serpent, which always had been lifted up in Egypt as a sola r sym bol of healing and of life. In playing off the serpent of fire against the serpent of darkne ss, the deceased anticipates Moses with Nehus htan the brazen. He exclaims trium pha ntly, “I unde rstand the mystical representations of things , and by that means I repul se Apap” (108 ). Also in the zodi ac of Esné fiery flying serpents are to be seen on the wing in the decans of Cancer as the sign of heat and drought (Drummond, Œd. Jud. , pl. 8). The children of Israel, as follow ers of the solar god , are the children of Ra, or Atum - Ra, unde r whatsoever racial name; and these are to be met with even by name, making the passage through the low er Egypt of Amenta on their way to the prom ised land. Peopl e named the Aaiu, an Egypt ian plural equi valent to our word Jews, are described in the unde r - world. Their god is the ass - headed Aiu, or Iu, who was one of the gods of Israel that led the peopl e up out of Egypt — that is, the ass was one of the zoot ype s of the god Aiu, as the calf, bul lock, or ox was anot her. We had to dredge t his nether - earth for much of the sunke n treasure of Egypt ian wisdom that has long been lost in its authentic shape. And in Amenta we find the ass - headed god of the Jews, respecting whom they have been so ignor antly derided and maligne d. His name, we repeat , is Aiu, Au, Aai, or Iu, bot h as god and as the ass in old Egypt ian; and this name survived in the forms of Iao, Iau, Iahu, Ieou, and others. The god was Atum - Ra in Egypt , and Aiu the ass - headed is one of the type s of the solar god. Aiu appe ars ass - headed in Amenta as a god stretched out upon the ground who has the solar disk upon his head, with the ears of an ass projecting beside the disk. He is hol ding the rope by which the solar boa t was tow ed up from the nether - world (Lefébur e, Records, vol . X, 647 "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"p. 130) . The figur e lying on the ground denot es the god who was Atum - Aiu, the sun by night in the earth of eternity. The peopl e who are with Aiu in this scene are amongs t thos e “who gua rd the rope of Aiu, and do not allow the serpent Apap to mount tow ards the boa t of the great god. ” These are the Aiu as the peopl e of Iu. It is said of them, “Thos e who are in this scene walk before Ra (Atum - Iu). They charm (or catalepse) Apap for him. They rise with him tow ards the heavens.” The Book of Amenta, called the B ook of Hades by Lefébur e, show s this god in his mum mied form as one with Osiris in the body and with Ra in soul ; otherwise it is Atum in the body, or mum my, and Iu in soul . And just as Ra the hol y spirit descends in Tattu on the mum my Osiris, and as Horus places his hands behind Osiris in the resurrection, so Iu com es to his body, the mum my in Amenta. Thos e who tow Ra along say, “The god com es to his body; the god is tow ed along tow ards his mum my” ( Records, vol . X, p. 132) . The sun - god , whether as Atum - Iu ( Aiu or Aai) or Osiris - Ra, is a mum my in Amenta and a soul in heaven. The imagery is quite natural: the noc turnal sun became a mum my as a figure of the dead, and a soul or spirit in its resurrection as a figur e of the living. Atum , or Osiris, as the sun in Amenta, is the mum my buried dow n in Khebt or Low er Egypt, and Iu in the one rende ring, or Horus in the other, raises the mum my - god . This is the meaning of the ass - eared Aiu when he is por trayed in the act of hauling at the rope of the sun or raising the mu mmy in Amenta. The god Aiu is represented mum mified upon the tom b of Rameses the Sixth — that is, in the character of Atum the father, bur ied as the mum my in low er Egypt . Thus we identify the ass - god Aiu or Iu (an ancient Egypt ian name of the ass) in low er E gypt , and his follow ers, who are the Aiu by name. The follow ers of Iu= Aiu then are the Aiu, Ius, or the later Jews. They fight the battle of the sun - god in the nether - earth, where the dragon Apap was the cruel impious opp ressor; and when they do escape fro m this, the land of bon dage for the manes, they are the Aaiu or the Jews, who “rise behind this god to heaven,” and their exodus is from Khebt, the low er Egypt of Amenta. The whol e story of the faithful Israelites who woul d not bow dow n to the gods of Egyp t is told in a few words relating to the Aiu (or Jews) in Amenta. As it is said, “These are they who spoke the truth on earth and did not rise to (prohi bited) ador ations ” or heresies (Lefébure, Book of Hades, Records of the Past ). The legends of the exodu s, like thos e in the book of Genesis originated in the astronom ical mythol ogy, in which the making of Amenta is follow ed by the Peri - em - hru or com ing forth to day from the low er Egypt of the unde r - world and the wilderness or desert. The story of this exodu s is inscribed in hierogl yphi cs on the sarcopha gus of Seti, now in the Soane Museum . The Book of Hades, or Amenta, and the Book of the Dead suffice of themselves to prove that “the Egypt and the desert” of the exodus were in Amenta, and not in the land of the pyramids. This was “the Egypt and the desert” in which the flocks of Ra were shephe rded and fed. “Horus says to Ra’s flocks, Protection for you , flocks of Ra, bor n of the great one who is in the heavens. Breath to your nos trils, overthrowal to your cof fins” (Book of Hades, 5th division, 648 legend D). These are the manes in Amenta called the flocks of Ra, who are shephe rded by Horus as Har - Khut i, lord of spirits. The ove rthrow al of the coffins show s that this was"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"the deliverance of the dead, and that the exodus or com ing forth to day was synonym ous with the resurrection from the dead. Amenta had been mappe d out in twelve domains, according to the twelve astronom ical divisions and the twelve gates which the sun passed through by night . “As it is said, the great god travels by the roads of Hades, to make the divisions which take place in the earth” (Book of Hades). There are various groups of the twelve as divine persona ges or children of Ra in this low er Egypt of Amenta. As characters in the mythos , Ja cob and the ten tribes, sons , or children correspond to Ra the solar - god , with his ten cycles in the heaven of ten divisions (Rit., ch. 18) , whilst Israel – the same persona ge – with the twelve sons , answers to the same god, Ra, in the heaven of twelve divisio ns or twelve signs of the zodi ac. It has now to be adm itted that the twelve sons of Jacob are not historic, and the historical exodus must follow them, for that is founde d on the twelve sons goi ng dow n into Egypt as historic characters, and the peopl e of Israel com ing out of it as their direct descenda nts huge ly multiplied. The twelve, as sons of Jacob, go dow n to Egypt in search of corn, and in the Book of Amenta we get a glimpse of the twelve or their mythical prototypes who make the jour ney as character s in the astronom ical mythol ogy. Twelve gods of the earth are to be seen marching tow ards a mount ain, which show s they are on their way to the nether - world, as it is depicted ups ide dow n. Twelve gods in the earth of Amenta are marching tow ards anot her moun tain, and these two mount ains form a sort of forge tow ard which the divine boa t voya ges. This is the entrance to Amenta, and these are the twelve as sons of Ra, who are on their way dow n to the low er Egypt of the mythos , the prototypa l twelve who are the s ons of Israel in the Hebrew version. These are said to be “thos e who are bor n of Ra, bor n of his subs tance, and which proceed from his eye.” Thus Ra is the father of the twelve. Ra has prepared for them “a hidde n dw elling” in this Egypt of the low er earth or desert of Amenta. Twelve mum mies standi ng upr ight , each in a chapel with ope n door s, are “the holy gods who are in Amenta.” Twelve men walking represent “the hum an soul s which are in Amenta.” Twelve bearers of the cord with which the allotments are meas ured for the glorified elect are represented by twelve persons carrying the long serpent Nenut i. These bearers of the cord in the Amenta are thos e who prepare the fields for the elect. Ra says, “Take the cord; draw, measure the fields of the manes, who are the elect in your dw ellings , gods in you r residences, deified elect, in order to rejoin the count ry, prove d elect, in order to be within the cord.” Ra is satisfied with the measurement. “Your ow n pos sessions , gods , and your ow n dom ains, elect, are your s. Now eat. Ra creates your fields and appoi nts you your food .” “The gods are cont ent with their pos sessions , the glorified are satisfied with their dw ellings .” The follow ers of Har - Khut i, lord of spirits, are the twelve, who take the 649 place in the solar mythos of the earlier seven Khut i in the stellar mythos , five more being adde d to the seven. These are the twelve as the children of Ra, who cultivate the fields of divine harvest in the plains of Amenta, where they reap for Ra as follow ers of Horus the b elove d son: “They labour at the harvest, they collect the corn. Their seeds are favour ed in the land by the light of Ra at his appe arance.” Thus the twelve are the cultivators of corn in Egypt . They give food to the gods and to the soul s of the elect in Am enta. As the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"bearers of food they are twelve in num ber. In one scene the twelve are por trayed in two groups of seven and five persons . The seven are the reapers. The five are seen bendi ng tow ards an enor mous ear of corn. These are described as the twelve w ho labou r at the harvest in the land of corn which is in the earth of eternity. The scene with the twelve in a pos ture of ador ation sugge sts the sheaf of corn in Joseph’ s dream. “Behol d, we were bindi ng sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose, and als o stood upright ; and behol d, your sheaves came round about , and made obe isance to my sheaf” (Gen. XXXVII. 7). In one form the Aarru enclosure was por trayed as the field of divine harvest, and the twelve were the typi cal reapers of the corn that grew there seven cubi ts high (Book of Hades, Records of the Past, vol s. X and XII). This is sufficiently sugge stive of the twelve enor mous sheaves in Joseph’ s dream, and of the reapers being a form of the twelve harvesters. The twelve as gods were also rulers in the twelve signs which formed the final circle of the Aarru paradise. And in Joseph’ s second dream his star is greeted with obe isance like his sheaf. “Behol d, the sun and the moon and the eleven (other) stars made obe isance to me,” he who was represented by th e twelfth star as well as by the twelfth sheaf (Gen. XXXVII. 6 - 9). Horus in the harvest - field of low er Egyp t has two characters, one pertaining to the mythos , one to the eschatology. In the first he is one of the twelve as harvesters: the twelve who row th e solar boa t, the twelve to whom the stations were assigne d or throne s were given in the zodi ac. In the other character he is Har - Khut i, lord of spirits, and in this pha se he is the supr eme one at the head of the twelve, who are now his servants. The pict ures show the children of Ra bot h as the group of twelve and also as the twelve with Horus. In one scene Horus is depicted leaning on a staff, and eleven gods are walking tow ards Osiris. These are the twelve altogether, of whom Horus is one in presence of the father. But on the tom b of Rameses the Sixth the twelve appe ar, preceded by Horus, the master of joy, leaning on his staff. These are the harvesters: seven of them are the reapers, the other five are collectors of the corn (Book of Hades). Thus the fie lds of divine harvest are twelve in num ber; the cultivators are twelve in num ber; the reapers and bearers of food are twelve in num ber; the children of Ra=Jacob - El or Isiri - El are twelve in num ber. So it was not left for the historic Israelites to map out the land of prom ise in twelve allotments betwixt the twelve tribes and twelve children of Ihuh . Amenta in twelve sections with twelve gates represented the heaven in twelve divisions , and the chart was as old as the solar zodi ac of twelve signs that was al ready in existence, as we reckon, in the heaven of Atum - Ra som e 13,000 years ago. Not onl y was the prom ised land mappe d out in twelve divisions in 650 accordance with the twelve signs of the solar zodi ac or the twelve pillars raised by Moses round the mo unt — not onl y did the chos en race, as children of the one god Atum , take pos session of the land allotted to them, or the land appoi nted them by lot, as Joshua rende rs it; title - deeds were also issued to the glorified elect. This low er Egypt , the land of co rn, in the Book of Hades is not geogr aphi cal. Like Annu, Thebes, and Memphi s in the Ritual, it is a mythical locality in the earth of eternity. It is the low er dom ain of the doubl e earth, the coun try of the manes called Amenta that was hol low ed out by Ptah the ope ner. It is the low er Egypt named Kheb, to which Isis"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"was warned to flee by night as the place of refuge for the infant Horus when his life was threatened by the Apap - mons ter. Low er Egypt is the land of death or darkne ss, leading to the world of lif e and light . It is here that “Horus says to the flocks of Ra, which are in the Hades of Egypt and the desert,” “Protection for you, flocks of Ra, bor n of the great one who is in the heavens” as Atum - Ra. These flocks “in the Hades of Egypt and the desert” a re the chos en peopl e, the deified elect, as the children of Ra. Amenta was a land of darkne ss unt il it was light ed by the noc turnal sun. This was the origin of the typi cal “Egypt ian darkne ss.” But in the Egyp t of this low er hemisphe re the god prepared a se cret and mysterious dw elling for his children where the glorified elect were hidde n in the light . “Ra says to the earth, Let the earth be bright . My benefits are for you who are in the light . To you be a dw elling. ” “I have hidde n you. ” (Book of Hades, 1st division. ) Food is given them because of the light , in which they are enve lope d. This divine dw elling created by Ra for the elect is entitled “the Retreat.” As it is said, “The earth is ope n to Ra, the earth is closed against Apap. Thos e who are in the Ret reat worship Ra.” This Retreat is equi valent to the biblical land of Goshen, where the chos en peopl e dw elt in light . In the book of Exodus there is a three days’ solid darkne ss ove r the land of Egypt , “but all the children of Israel had light in their dw el lings ” (ch. X. 22, 23) . The land of Goshen in the Hebrew version represents the Retreat of Ammah in the Ritual. Ammah is a locality that is traversed in know ing the spirits of Annu or of attaining the garden eastward. Thos e who belong to the state of the e lect are hidde n in Ammah. They are described as being conc ealed in light by Ra. Ammah is a region reserved for the gods and the glorified spirits who are the children of light bound for the land where there is no more night . It is a place impenetrable to t he creatures of darkne ss and to thos e who are twice dead — dead in their sins as well as in the mortal body . These are they who do not rise again from the low er Egypt . There is no deliverance or exodus for them; they do not enter Ammah, or follow Shu, the li on of strengt h, who leads up the elect into the land of light . Ammah is the sixth one of fourteen abode s in the 149t h chapter of the Ritual. It is an abode of peace reserved for the blessed, where the evil dead canno t enter. It is a mystery to the manes. T he god who is there is called the ove rthrow er of the crocodi le or dragon. The deceased in saluting Ammah asks that he may take pos session of its stuffs in peace. “O Ammah! Reservation of the gods ; mystery for the manes where the dead may not enter. Hail to thee, O Ammah 651 the augus t. I com e to see the gods who are there. Open to me, that I may take pos session of your stuffs.” (Cf. the spoi ls.) Ammah is the Goshen of the Ritual, reserved and set apart for the glorified as a place impenetrable to the pow e rs of evil or the dead who do not rise again, and for whom there is no exodus or com ing forth to day (149 ). It is the work of the worshippe rs in Amenta to destroy the enemies of Ra and defend the great one against the evil Apap. They “live on the food of R a, and the meats belong to the inha bitants of Amenta. Holy is that which they carry unt o the dw elling where they are conc ealed.” This divine food is appa rently repeated in the qua ils and manna that were sent from heaven, according to the biblical account . Dreadful massacres are perpetrated in taking pos session of this prom ised land mappe d out in twelve divisions . Ra says, “I have com mande d that they shoul d massacre,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"and they have massacred the beings .” He orders his follow ers to destroy the impious one s in a suppr ession of blood . But these beings are not the hum an inha bitants of Canaan or any other land on earth. The wars of the lord in these battles of Amenta are fought by his true and faithful follow ers on behalf of Un - Nefer the good being. The enemies wh o are doom ed to be slaught ered by the invaders are the Sebau and Sami, the creators of dearth and darkne ss, who were in pos session of the land, and who are for ever rising in rebellion against the supr eme god Ra. It was these dw ellers in the ways of darkne ss who were to be anni hilated by the children of light , the glorified elect, the chos en peopl e, who are then to take pos session of the land. Ra says to them, “Your offerings (made on earth) are you rs. Take your refreshm ents. Your soul s shall not be massacr ed, your meats shall not put refy, faithful one s who have destroye d Apap for me.” Thus the massacres by which the Israelites were enabled to clear out the inha bitants of Canaan and take pos session of their lands had been previous ly com mitted by the follow e rs of Ra. Ra says to thos e who are born of him, and for whom he had created the dw elling - place in the beautiful Amenta, “Breath to you who are in the light , and dw ellings for you. My benefits are for you. ” But the beings there massacred were not hum an. In the biblical version it is said of a mythical event, “It came to pass, when Pharaoh woul d hardly let them go, that the Lord slew all the first - bor n in the land of Egypt , bot h the first - born of man and the first - bor n of beast” (Ex. XIII. 15) . This insane pr oceeding on the part of the Lord may be expl ained by reference to the original. From this we learn that amongs t the beings massacred or sacrificed were “quadr upe ds and reptiles” (Book of Hades, 1st division, legend E). The Hebrew historian has discreetly o mitted the first - bor n of the reptile, unless it is include d as a beast. Again, one name of the keeper of the 17t h gate is “lord of the massacre and of sacrificing the enemy at midni ght !” (Rit., 145) . With this we may com pare the passage, “And it came to pa ss at midni ght that the Lord smote all the first - bor n in the land of Egypt . . . and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a hous e where there was not one dead” (Ex. XII. 30). Now , amongs t the glorified elect or chos en peopl e who are the child ren of Ra, the ass - god, Aai, or Iu, there is a group of his 652 defende rs and follow ers who accom pany him, and who are said to rise with Ra tow ards the heavens to be “for him in the two sanc tuar ies,” and to “make him rise in Nu” (heaven). These are among the worshippe rs of the ass - headed god Iu, who are called the Aaiu (the Ius or Jews) by name. Apap is threatened thus , “O impious cruel one , Apap, who spreadest thy wickedne ss. Thy face shall be destroye d, Apap! Appr oach thy place of torment. The Nemu are against thee: thou shalt be struck dow n. The Aaiu are agai nst thee: thou shalt be destroye d.” It is these Aaiu as worshippe rs of the god Iu that we claim to be the Ius or later Jews of the mythical legends so long suppos ed to have been historical. Thus the glorified elect, the blessed, the right eous , who are in Amenta, that is in the low er Egypt of the mythos , are the chos en peopl e of the most high god , who was Ra in his first sove reignt y as the ass - headed Iu= Iao, Aiu, or Iahu; Atum - Huhi as god the father, Atum - Iu as god the ever - com ing son. The Aaiu or Jews, then, are amongs t thos e who “rise for Ra.” “They beat dow n Apap in his bonds .” Apap is stricken with swords. He is sacrificed. Ra rises at the finishing hou r; “he ascends when the chain is fixed.”"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Thos e who are in this scene drag the chains of this evil - doe r (Apap). They say to Ra, “Com e Ra; adva nce Khut i! The chain is fixed on evil - face (Neha - her), and Apap is in bonds ” (Book of Hades, 10t h division) . This is the scene of making fast the dragon in the p it which is preparatory to the rising of Ra. These Aiu or Jews accom pany the sun - god when he makes the jour ney through the valley of darkne ss, the lake of Putrata, and the desert in “the Amenta of Egypt ,” where they are protected as the “flocks of Ra.” Ami dst the peopl e that dw ell in darkne ss and black night they are the glorified elect, enve lope d and conc ealed in light , and fed mysterious ly in the wilderness with food suppl ied from heaven. Earth ope ns to let them pass when they are pur sued by their old ene my, and closes to protect them against the devour ing dragon. Hence it is said by thos e who rende r the great serpent impotent by their magic, “Earth opens to Ra! Earth closes to Apap!” The monum ents of Egypt are as truly and hone stly historical as the geolo gical record. Both have their breaks and their missing links , yet are perfectly trustworthy on the whol e. And these monum ents, from beginni ng to end, have no word of witness that the Jews or Hebrews ever were in Egypt as a foreign ethni cal entity. They kno w not hing of Abraham as a Semite who went dow n into Egypt to teach the Egypt ians astronom y. They know not hing of Jacob except as a Hiksos Pharaoh, or a divinity, Jacob - El, whos e name is found on one of the scarabei. They know nothing of Joseph and his vizi ership, nor of the ten plague s, nor of the goi ng forth in trium ph from the hous e of bonda ge to attain the prom ised land. These and many other wonde rful things related in the Word of God are know n to the Egypt ian records, but not as history. There is anot he r Egypt not yet expl ored by the bibliolaters: the Egypt of mythol ogy and the Kamite eschatology. Unless we take into account the mound of the Jew in the neighbour hood of On and the temple of Atum - Iu (W. M. F. Petrie, Hyksos and Israelite Cities ), the onl y way of identifying the Jews 653 in Egypt is by the name of the Iu or Aiu in the low er Egypt of the mythical Amenta, where we find the twelve sons or children of Israel, unde r the name of the Ius or Aiu, as worshippe rs of the god who was know n in Egypt a s the ass - headed Iu, Aiu= Iao, Ieou, or Iahu, and who, as we see from the scarabei, may also have been know n in Egypt as Jacob - El, the father of the twelve who were reapers of the corn in the harvest of Amenta. The writer has previous ly sugge sted, in A Boo k of the Beginni ngs , that Jacob represents the god Ra as Iu in Kheb, the low er Egypt of Amenta. Jacob was know n as a divinity in Northern Syria by the name of Jacob - El, and Joseph by the name of Joseph - El. The El is a Semitic suffix to the names, denot ing the divinity of bot h, versus the ethni cal origin of Jacob and Joseph. These, according to the present show ing, were among the gods of Egypt as Huhi the father and Iu the son, or sif in Egypt ian, Iu - sif being= Joseph in Hebrew. Thus we propos e to identify th e mum my of Jacob in Egypt with the mum my of Atum or Osiris as a form of the mummy - sun that was por trayed as being carried up from Amenta. Jacob, as we read, was embalmed in Egypt, and the mum my in its coffin was taken up by Joseph and carried to the land o f Canaan. This was the land of prom ise, which is the Aarru - paradise, the field of the tree of life up which the sun - god climbs in his resurrection from the coffin. The “bur ying - place” of Jacob is “before Mamre,” where the tree of Atum in the garden or mead ow , the Sekhet - Hetep, is represented by the oak or"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"terebinth unde r which Abraham dw elt. Joseph the son (Iusif) is the same character in carrying up the mum my of Jacob that Horus the belove d son is to the dead Osiris in his coffin. Horus acts as the raiser - up of the mum my. This is expr essed when the speaker says, “I am he who raises the hand which is motionless” (Rit., ch. 5). Elsewhere Horus com es to raise the mum my of Osiris. Thus the carrying up of Jacob out of Egypt by the son may be paralleled by the re surrection of Osiris, coffin and all. One name of the bur ial - place for the mum my - Osiris in the Ritual is Sekhe m. The deceased is enve lope d as a mum my in Sekhe m. He rises again and goe s, as pur e spirit, out of Sekhe m. Also the well of Jacob near Shechem ans wers to the water of Osiris, and the oak or terebinth in Shechem to the tree of life in the pool of the persea or the water of life. The fields of Shechem correspond to the Sekhe t - Hetep or fields of peace and plenty, the oasis of fertility which prefigured the celestial paradise. “The parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph” was in Shechem, also called Sichem. This is a parallel to Sekhe m as place of bur ial given by Osiris the father to Amsu - Horus the son, who rose again as the living mum my or sa hu after the bur ial, and went up from the low er Egypt of Amenta and the sandy wilderness of Sekari as the god in the coffin or sekeru - bark. The Egyp tian Sekhe m was no doubt localized as a sanctuary when Jude a and Palestine were sow n ove r with the old Egypt ian names. Osiris was the reput ed hol der of prope rty in Sekhe m, unl ess we unde rstand that his mum my, the body of the lord, cons tituted the prope rty that was held in that sanctuary (Hym n to Osiris, lines 1 and 2). The low er Egypt of Amenta is a land of bon dage to the manes who were doom ed to labour in the harvest - field. Chapter 5 is 654 called the chapter by which work is not impos ed upon a person in the nether - world. But provi sion is made for the work being done by proxy. Chapter 6 is the chapter by whic h the fune ral statuettes may be made to do work for a person in the nether - world. “Be thou count ed for me,” says the speaker, “at every mom ent, for planting the fields, for watering the soil, and for removi ng the sands .” Thus there was a system of enforced labour in the low er Egypt of Amenta. The land of bonda ge is likewise allude d to as the land of rule in the Book of the Dead. In the chapter by means of which the manes com e forth to day and pass through Ammah or the Ammehit it is said, “Hail to you , ye lo rds of rule (or ruling pow ers), living for ever, whos e secular period is eternity. Let me not be stoppe d at the Meskat (or place of pun ishm ent); let not the Sebau have the mastery ove r me; let not your door s be closed upon me.” And amongs t other pleas in t his invoc ation it is said, “Deliver me from the crocodi le of this land of rule,” or, as it got interpreted, this land of bonda ge in the low er Egypt of Amenta. In this chapter the crocodi le has an evil character, and the evil crocodi le is the mythical drago n, the dragon of Egypt , a figur e of the Pharaoh who kept the peopl e in bonda ge and woul d not let them go from out their prison - hous e in the Meskat where the evil Sebau had the mastery ove r the manes, who plead, “Let not the pow ers of darkne ss obt ain the ma stery ove r me. . . . . I faint before the teeth of thos e whos e mout h raveneth in the nether - world” (Rit., chs. 72 and 74, Renouf ). The Apap - dragon of Amenta is the real Pharaoh who held the peopl e in bonda ge, but in certain of the Semitic legends Atum - Ra, the great judge and puni sher of the wicked, has been mixed up with the cruel Pharaoh who woul d not let the peopl e go."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"According to the Arab traditions , the name of the Pharaoh who detained the chos en peopl e, the elect children of light , was know n as “Tamu zi.” Castell gives this as the Arabic name of the Pharaoh who hinde red the exodus of the Israelites, which name goe s to the root of the matter, for Tamuzi appe ars in the Ritual as Atum - Ra, com monl y called Tum . The name of this Ra or Pharaoh is derived from “tum u” to shut up, to close. Tum as the setting sun was the closer in the western gate. As shut ter up of day or of autum n he wears the closing lotus on his head, the antithesis to Horus rising out of the ope ning flow er of dawn. Atum was the closer as well as the ope ner of Amenta by name. Thos e who were captives in his keeping dow n in the Amenta were hinde red from making their exodus unt il the plague s were passed or the condi tions of freedom had been all fulfilled. The entrance to Amenta figured in the Egy ptian itinerary was “the mout h of the cleft,” as it was termed at Abydos . This is appa rently represented in the Hebrew legend by the mout h of the gor ge at Pi - ha - hiroth, “which is before Baal - Zephon. ” Thus the ope ning in the mount of the swallow ing earth is at the same poi nt as the passage of the Red Sea which also ope ned for the Israelites to pass when pur sued by Pharaoh and his hos t. There are, how ever, two starting - points in the biblical exodus of the Israelites. No soone r had they set out on the old road that ran from Rameses to Succoth (or Thuku ) and Etham or Khetam, the bor der - fortress in the land of Thuku , than they were com mande d to turn back for a fresh de - 655 parture from Pi - ha - hiroth, the pass or gorge which was entered by the mout h of the cleft . At this poi nt of divergence the local topog raphy is brought to conf usion and serves no further use for localizing the journey. We have to go back and start from the entrance to Amenta by the mout h of the cleft in the rock that was figur ed at Abydos as th e beautiful gate of entrance to Khent - Amenta. This two - fold starting - poi nt at least coincides with the two mode s of entrance, one by land and the other by water. At Pi - ha - hiroth we enter the Red Sea of the mythos , the water of the west that was red at suns et, but not the geogr aphi cal Red Sea. This was entered by the boa t of the sun and the boa t of soul s which passed through the cleft by water as depicted in the vigne ttes (Maspero, Daw n of Civ., Eng. tr., p. 197) . We are now upon the track of the exodus from the low er Egypt of the nether - earth, which was mythical in the lesser mysteries and mystical in the greater, and able to show where and how and why the children of Israel pur sue the same rout e through Amenta as do the children of Ra in the Book of Hades ( Records of the Past, vol s. X. and XII). At Pi - ha - hiroth the Israelites com e to the mout h of the cleft and enter on the passage of the Red Sea, pur sued by Pharaoh the dragon and his evil hos t. In the book of Exodus the Israelites, of course, are treated as the glorified and the Egypt ians as the pow ers of darkne ss, the cons pirators against the elect, the chos en, the children of light . Or, according to the Ritual, by the Apap - dragon and the Sebau, whos e habitat is in the Red Sea of the mythos and therefore was not geogr aphi cal. The Egypt ians made the passage by water, but by subs tituting the miracle for the mythos , “the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.” After crossing the waters they enter the wilderness, which is true to its chara cter in the Egyptian books of the nether earth. When the land that flow ed with milk and hone y is prom ised to the children of Israel, it is said by Ihuh, “I will send my terror before thee — I will send the hornet before"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"thee, which shall drive out the Hivit e, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before thee” (Ex. XXIII. 27, 28) . Now the hor net, wasp, or bee was a type of Ra the solar god , and thence of the Egypt ian Pharaoh. Hor - Apol lo says, “They depict a bee to denot e a peopl e obe dient to their king” (B. I, 62) , the force of the creature’s sting being emblematic of the supr eme pow er. Also the abait or bird - fly, a bee, wasp, or hornet, was their gui de to the Aarru - garden in the Ritual. “I have made my way into the roya l palace,” says the Osiris” (ch. 76), “and it was the bird - fly (abait) that led me hither” — that is, to the land flow ing with milk and hone y. Appa rently this sym bol ic abait or bee as gui de to the Aarru - paradise has been turned into the hor net that drove the peopl e out of the land in the Hebrew rend ering of the story. When Moses sends the expl orers ahead to spy out the land of Canaan, and they com e back afraid because it is inha bited by the Anakim or giants, “Caleb stilled the peopl e before Moses, and said, Let us go up at onc e and pos sess it, for we are well able to ove rcom e it” (Num . XIII. 30). Caleb the expl orer who had been sent forward by Moses to spy out the land of prom ise is anot her of these conve rted divinities. In the Semitic langua ges Caleb is the dog , and the dog as Egypt ian was the jackal , apua t, the gui de of ways, the zoot ype which was the gui de of 656 ways in the solar mythos , and the gui de of soul s to the garden of Amenta, wherein grew the grapes of paradise in Brobdi ngna gian clusters which are to be seen in vigne ttes to the Ritual. S hu as son of Ra is the great leader of the peopl e to the prom ised land; Anup the jackal=dog was the gui de; and these two are represented in the book of Num bers by Joshua (or Hoshea) the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunne h. Thos e two, the leader and the gui de, bot h in the astronom y and the eschatology, are the only two in the Hebrew version that are to go forth in the exodus from the wilderness and bur ial - place of the dead. “And they came unt o the valley of Eschol, and cut dow n from thence a branch wi th one cluster of grapes, and they bare it upon a staff between two” (carriers). “And they returned from spyi ng out the land at the end of forty days.” They show ed the fruit of the land to Moses and the Israelites, and said, “We came unt o the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it flow eth with milk and hon ey, and this is the fruit of it” (Num . XIII. 23 - 28). The colossal cluster of grapes seen in Eschol by thos e who were sent to spy out the promised land is of itself almost sufficient to prove the mythi cal nature and Egypt ian origin of the land that flow ed with milk and hone y and bore the grapes that took two men to carry one cluster. Not onl y was the circum pol ar paradise the land of the seven cow s, called the provi ders of plenty; as Egypt ian it was also the garden of the grape - vine by name. Not as Eden, but as Aarru the garden of the vine or the grapes. In one of the Hebrew märchen it is said that when the expl orers of the prom ised land returned they related, “We have seen the land which we are to conque r with the sword, and it is good and fruitful. The stronge st camel is scarcely able to carry one bunc h of grapes; one ear of corn yields enough to feed a whol e family; and one pom egranate shell woul d cont ain five armed men. But the inha bitants of the land and their cities are in keeping with the produc tions of the soil. We saw men the smallest of whom was six hund red cubi ts high. They were astoni shed at us, on account of our diminut ive stature, and laughe d at us. Their hous es were also in propor tion, walle d up to heaven, so that an eagle coul d hardly soar above them” (Baring Goul d’s Legends of the Old Testam ent Char acters, vol .

This grand dom ain was cons tructed for the manes who as the glorified one s have joined the powers of the east at the poi nt of com ing forth where Shu uplifts the sky for Ra and blow s off the divine barge with favour ing gales. The great or glo rified one s are said to be each nine cubi ts (about 18 feet) in height , and therefore this is the land of the giants to which the Israelites were bound unde r the leadership of Joshua and the gui dance of Caleb the dog. This region of things gigantic may be f ound in the mystical abode s of the Ritual through which the manes have to pass on their way to the world of light and blessedne ss. The second abode is called the “greatest of pos session s in the fields of the Aarru. The height of this corn is seven cubi ts; the ears are two, its stalks are three cubi ts.” The spirits also are said to be seven cubi ts in stature (ch. 149 ). Of the fifth abode it is said, “Hail, abode of the spirits, through which there is no passage. The spirits belongi ng to it are seven cubi ts l ong in 657 their thighs . They live as wretched shades.” “Oh, this abode of the spirits.” In chapter 109 the inha bitants are nine cubi ts in height . The passage through the Hades in the eleventh abode is described as the belly of hell. “There is neither co ming out of nor goi ng into it, on account of the greatness of the terror of passing him who is in it.” That is, the devour ing demon, the Am - Moloch. The same fear is reflected in the faces of the spies from the land of giants; they had seen the same sight . The Moabites called the giants who dw elt there in times past the Emim (Deut. II. 11), and the Am - am in Egypt ian are the devour ers. Am is the male devou rer, Am - t the female devour er in the Ritual. As said in chapter 109, “It is the glorified one s, each of w hom is nine cubi ts in height , who reap the Aarru fields (in the divine dom ain of the promised land) in presence of the pow ers of the east” (Renouf ). The giants as Repha im are also Egypt ian (Rit., ch. 149 , 5th Abode ). These giants of Amenta and the religiou s mysteries still survive in the grotesque masks of the Christmas pantom ime, which represent the hug e inha bitants of an unde r - world that is the low ermost of three, the highe st of which is on the mount of glory. Emim, Anakim, Repha im, and Zamzum mim are all giants — hence the Anakim unde r different names, nine cubi ts high; and this land of the giants as Egyptian was in the nether - earth, the original of the Hebrew Sheol, in which the giants are identifiable as non - hum an inha bitants of a foreworld that had passed away. It is to that foreworld and its peopl e, the children of darkne ss, that the writer of Deuterono my refers, and as its inha bitants were altoge ther mythical (or eschatologi cal), the children of Israel, and of Lot, who drove them out and destroye d them u tterly, coul d not be hum an nor the transaction hum anly historical. The land of the mythical giants can be localized in Amenta, but not elsewhere. The low er or sub - terrestrial paradise, otherwise called the garden of Aarru, was the garden eastward, the gar den of the mount in Amenta, which was in prospect throughout the jour ney. This was the paradise to which Shu - Anhur was the leader from the western mount ain and Anup - Ap - Uat was the guide as dog or jackal. It was the paradise of all good things , includi ng th e gigantic grapes and grain, the milk and hone y, as type s of food and drink in everlasting plenty. The poi nt of emergence from Amenta was at the doubl e gate of glory on the sum mit of the eastern mount ; otherwise expr essed, this was the place of exit from the"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"low er to the uppe r Egypt of the mythos as celestial localities. Anhur was the upl ifter and suppor ter of the heaven and its inha bitants by night. Shu was the deliverer by day who brought the solar orb to the hor izon. In the Hebrew rende ring Moses sustai ns the rôle of Anhur , and Joshua that of Shu, the halves of the whol e round being extende d to the circle of the year. The earthly paradise was planted as the Allu or elysian fields to the eastward of the nether - earth where stood the tree of life, and where the moun tain of the doubl e earth was climbed to get a glimpse of the land of prom ise that was visible ove r - sea. Upon this mount ain “Moses stood, to view the lands cape o’er,” or rather the skys cape. The low er paradise was but a picture and a prom ise for th e wande rers in the wilderness of Amenta. The uppe r was the paradise 658 of all the ancient and pre - solar legends . Thus far the deliverer as Anhur or as Moses was the conduc tor of the children of Ra or Israel. High on Mount Hetep, in the heaven of eternit y, was the paradise of spirits perfected. This was the land of prom ise and final fruition bot h in one , the land ove rflow ing with milk and hone y. The milk, called “the white liquor which the glorified one s love ,” was suppl ied by the seven cow s, provi ders of plenty in the meadow s of the uppe r Aarru. Here also was the land of corn in limitless abunda nce. No words coul d say how much. Low er Egypt was a land of corn, but the legenda ry prom ised land of corn, hone y, and oil was in the Aarru fields of the mythos . Th ese were the fields where the corn grew seven cubi ts high, with ears three cubi ts long and in eternal plenty for all com ers. The landi ng - place upon Mount Hetep at the sum mit of attainm ent is called “the divine nome of corn and barley” (Rit., ch. 110 ). The Egypt ians were already tillers of the ground when Ptah laid out and planted the low er Aarru - paradise, as their other field of work, in an earth that was ruled or tyranni zed ove r by the pow ers of evil, headed by the Apap - dragon. This was the earth of the a bys s, the primeval desert which had to be reclaimed by the pione ers and planters of that unde r - world. It was laid out strictly on the allotment system. Each one of the manes had a por tion in which to plough and sow and reap. The seed grow n in the harvest - f ield of life on earth was garnered up to sow and bring forth a hund redfold in this, the field of divine harvest, which was so magni fied by tradition because its bount y had been divinized. The Egypt ian author ship of a paradise of peace and plenty is pre - emi nently show n by their conve rting the “earth of eternity” into a world of work, the harvest - field that was cultivated by the manes, who dug and hoe d and sow ed in it, and reaped the corn according to their labour s (Rit., ch. 6). Amenta was made from sand con verted into fertile soil well watered by the all - enriching Nile. It was like low er Egypt , the land of hone y, the land of the sycamore fig - tree, which was a veritable tree of life to the Egypt ians. It was the land of the grapes that grew in clusters of prod igious size. It was the count ry of abunda nt corn. Not that the Egypt ians thought the other world a replica of this, but such was the natural plan on which they wrought in making out the unknow n by the know n. They dramatized anot her intermediate state, and acted the eschatologi cal drama in accordance with condi tions familiar to them in this world. The Aarru - paradise in Amenta is copi ed from Egypt in the uppe r earth. The fulfilment of all blessedne ss was in its being a likeness of the dear old land made perma nent and perfect in the spirit - world. It was the prom ised land for thos e who were prepared to take pos session of it and to drink of the"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"sacred Nile at its celestial sour ce. Its tree of life was the same sycamore fig - tree that had always been the tree of li fe and food in season. The jour ney from the low er Egyp t of the mythos through the deserts of Amenta was from west to east, from the place of suns et to the poi nt of sunr ise which was called the solar mount of glory. At suns et Anhur - Shu upraised his mansion of the starry firmament which he upl ifted night ly, standi ng on the steps of Am - Khemen. This presented a stellar picture of the uppe r Egypt or the uppe r 659 paradise for which the wande rers in the wilderness were bound. At dawn the mount of sunr ise in th e garden eastward was attained. This was the mount ain of Amenta, also called Shennu or Shenni =Sinai. Shena in Egypt ian signi fies the poi nt of turning in the orbit of the solar cour se. This poi nt was figur ed on the mount ain where the lions rested as suppor t ers of the solar disk at dawn, or Shu upl ifted Ra from out the darkne ss of Amenta and held the orb aloft with his two hands . At this point Anhur ’s place as leader of the chos en peopl e was taken by his alter ego Shu. The Magic Papyr us describes the warrior - god as “king of uppe r and low er Egypt ” in his two characters of Anhur and Shu - si - Ra. By night Shu - Anhu r was the upl ifter of the firmament for the Egypt ian exodus or com ing forth to day from out the darkne ss of Amenta or of “Egypt and the desert” (Rit., ch. 110) . (See the figur e of Shu as the upl ifter, p. 315. ) Under the name of Anhur he is the leader of the uppe r heaven, rod in hand. His starry image proba bly was seen as Regul us in the cons tellation of Kephe us, the ruler there, arrested with the rod or staf f still lifted in his hand. He repels the crocodi le or dragon com ing out of the abys s, the crocodi le that is the dragon of Egypt and the Pharaoh of the Hebrew writers. This repelling of the crocodi les that issue from the abys s corresponds to the ove rthrow a l of Pharaoh or the dragon and his hos t in the Red Sea. Anhur is the lord of the scimitar. He is designa ted “smiting doubl e hor ns”; “the god provided with the two horns,” like Moses. “Uplifted is the sky which he maintains with his two arms,” like Moses. T his two - fold character of Anhur is indi cated when he is described as “the king of uppe r and low er Egypt , Shu - si - Ra.” This was the Egypt of Amenta. Thus , as the king of low er Egypt he was Anhur the upl ifter of the firmament for the chos en peopl e to com e for th. At daybr eak he assum ed the character of Shu, the son of Ra, who lifted up the solar disk at dawn on the horizon, otherwise upon the mount of sunr ise. As Regul us on the hor izon in the zodi ac the leader of the manes change d to Shu, who is then called “th e doubl e abode of Ra.” The Magic Papyr us, which cont ains “the hym n of the god Shu, ” is called “the chapter of the excellent songs which dispel the subm erged.” It is the celebration of the great victory ove r the Apap - reptile and all dange rous animals lurkin g in the depths of the mythical Red Sea. It is said to Shu in the hym n, “Thou leadest to the uppe r heaven with thy rod in that name which is thine of Anhur . Thou repellest the crocodi le com ing out of the abys s in that name which is thine of repeller of cro codi les.” The crocodi le, of cour se, is the dragon of Egypt . The wicked are ove rthrow n by Anhur the valiant as the lord of events. His sister Tefnut accom panies him. She is a form of Sekhe t, “the godde ss in her fury,” the “chastiser of the wicked.” “She giv es her fire against his enemies, and reduc es them to non - existence.” She is the Kamite prototype of Miriam, the sister of Moses. Tefnut accom panies her brother in his battles with the Sebau and the subm erged. Elsewhere she change s her shape into a"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"weapon o f war. She shout s her defiance against “the wicked cons pirators,” exclaiming, “I am Tefnut thunde ring against thos e who are anni hilated for ever!” and against thos e that “remain floating on the waves, like dead bodi es on the inunda tion,” just as it was on that 660 day when “Israel saw the Egyp tians dead upon the sea - shor e” (Ex. XIV. 30) . Tefnut, the prototype of Miriam, “gives her fire” against her brother’s enemies to reduc e them to non - existence by their being subm erged in the waters, where “Miriam the prophe tess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the wom en went out after her with timbrels and with dances. And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath trium phe d glorious ly; the horse and his rider hath he throw n into th e sea” (Ex. XV. 20 - 21) . Moses corresponds to Anhur . He is the leader of the children of Israel during the first part of the jour ney tow ards the prom ised land. He conduc ts them through the Red Sea where Israel saw the Egypt ians dead upon the sea - shor e; thro ugh the sandy wilderness, the waterless wastes, and the ways of darkne ss. “Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephi dim.” This, as we reckon, was the great battle of the autum n equi nox. It was not a battle fough t by hum an beings onc e for all on mun dane ground, but a war betwixt the Lord and Amalek, that went on for ever, from generation to generation, because it was periodi c in the phe nom ena of external nature, and not a due l betwixt the Lord of heaven and an earthly potentate or peopl e. The descrip tion of hol ding up the hands of Moses to maintain the equi librium show s the equi noc tial nature of the conf lict. The goi ng forth at the equi nox is further identified by the mont h of the year. The Jewish new year still begins about the time of the autum n equ inox, a little belated in cons eque nce of its not having been carefully readjusted. “And the Lord spake unt o Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt , saying, This mont h shall be unt o you the beginning of mont hs: it shall be the first mont h of the year to you” (Ex. XII. 1, 2). This was the year that ope ned with and was determined by the full moon nearest to the autum n equi nox. For six mont hs thenceforth the moon was ruler of the year as the great light in the darkne ss of the doubl e earth. Again, at the time of t he vernal equi nox there is anot her poi sing of the scales, if not a standi ng still of sun and moon , and anot her great battle in which the sun - god finally overcom es the dragon of darkne ss and all the evil pow ers that war against the light of life and welfare of the world; also against the children of Ra on their journey as soul s or manes from the low er Egypt of the mythical Amenta to the uppe r heaven on the mount of glory. The present writer has previous ly sugge sted that the name of Moys es, or as som e Hebrew s pronounc ed it, Moui shé, was derived from the dua l name of Shu, one of whos e names as Ma, the other Shu, and Ma - Shu denot es Anhur , who manifests in the two characters of Ma and Shu. In the address to the god it is said, “Thou blow est the divine barge off with a favour able wind in that name which is thine of the godde ss Ma.” Thus Ma, the godde ss of truth, law, and justice, is here identified with Shu in a feminine character. The feather of Anhur also reads bot h Ma and Shu — Ma as light and Shu as shade. But, after all, the origin of the name is of little impor tance com pared with the traits of character. This female character of Ma - Shu has also been assigne d to Moses. There is a tradition, repor ted by Suidas, that the Hebrew lawgiver and author of the Jewish la ws was a Hebrew wom an named Musu, which is equi valent to Ma - Shu"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 661 in Egypt ian. Shu is the very personi fication of light and shade. The name reads bot h light and shade. This dua l character of the god is to be read in the face of Moses, who wears the glo ry on it when in presence of the Lord upon the mount , and who cove rs or shades his face when he turns to speak with the peopl e in the valley. He likewise is the personi fication of light and shade: Moses unde r the veil is Shu in the shade; Moses wearing the glory of God upon his face is Shu who “sits in his father’s eye,” the eye of the sun; Shu - ari - hems - nefer – who keeps his residence radiant – which is a title of Shu at Philae. (Pierret, Le Pant héon Egyptien, pp. 22 - 3.) “When Moses had done speaking with the p eopl e, he put a veil on his face. But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he took the veil off unt il he came out .” And when he came out and spake unt o them that which he was com mande d, they saw the skin of Moses’ face. “And Moses put the veil upon his face again unt il he went in to speak with him” (Ex. XXXIV. 35). The glory on the face of Moses is described as sendi ng forth horns, which is a way of por traying the god provi ded with “two hor ns,” that is a title of Anhur . Moses performs the s ame act as Shu the suppor ter of the firmament, but in the heaven with twelve suppor ts instead of the earlier four erected by Shu - Anhur , which follow ed a readjustment that was made by the Hir - seshti of On in the heaven of Atum - Ra. Anhu r was the elevator and suppor ter of the heavens, and Shu - si - Ra is the uphol der of the solar disk. Moses with his arms upl ifted on the mount , or with the “rod of God” in his hand, is the Hebrew version of Anhur the sustainer of heaven standi ng on the mount . Joshua , who becom es t he suppor ter of Iah the solar god , is identical with Shu when he is the son and suppor ter of Ra upon the hor izon east and west. Shu was at first the son of Nun, the deity of the celestial water, who was also called the father of the gods . He afterwards bec ame the son of Ra as the suppor ter of the solar disk on the horizon “with his two hands .” Joshua also had a doubl e character, like Shu. In the first he is called Hoshea, the son of Nun. In his later rôle Joshua becom es the uphol der of Ihuh and his change o f name is conne cted with the change in character. The name of Joshua or j v > v h y cont ains the name of Ihuh uni ted to a word signi fying assistance or help. In the form X v > it denot es a lifting up, an uphol ding, as in the Egypt ian name of Shu, to uph old, which describes him in the character of the upl ifter to Ra the solar god . This shoul d suffice to demons trate the identity of Joshua , the son of Nun and the suppor ter of Ihuh , with Shu, who became Shu - si - Ra as the upl ifter of the solar disk. Thus Shu, the son of Nun and suppor ter of the firmament as an elemental pow er, was afterwards persona lized as the suppor ter of the sun - god Ra. Ra is Ihuh . The name of Shu denot es the suppor ter, and the deity whom he suppor ted on the moun t was Atum - Huhi ; and in this character Shu became the leader of the children of Ra (or of Israel) as Io - Shua , who proclaims himself to be the suppor ter of Ihuh in the book of Joshua (XXIV. 15, 16) . The firmament is the Nun by name, and Shu the upl ifter of the firmament is called the son of Nun. Thus Shu in his upl ifting of the firmament is the upl ifter of his father. Now , to show onc e more how widely fragm ents of the Egypt ian wisdom were scattered to becom e the later legends of many lands , let us glance for 662"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" a mom ent at “the expl oits of Mau i,” a Polyne sian form of Shu. Shu was the son of Nnu (Nun) , and in Manga ia the name of Nnu is rende red by Ru. Ru is the father of Maui, and one of the expl oits of Maui is to hurl his father Ru aloft, sky and all, to a tremendous height , so high inde ed that the sky coul d never get back to earth again. Now for the conve rsion of the Kamite myth into the Manga ian märchen. Nnu or Nun was also the firmament upraised by Shu. Nnu as firmament was persona lized in Nnu the father of Shu; and where Shu uplifts the sky, now persona lized, Maui is hum orous ly described as assum ing gigantic propor tions , and exerting prodi gious strengt h to toss his father so far aloft that he was for ever entangl ed and suspende d among the stars of heaven, and never coul d com e dow n again (Gill , Myths and Songs , p. 58) . Various legends derived from the Egypt ian mythol ogy were com pounde d in the Hebrew book of Exodus . One of the most remarkable of all the parallels to be adduc ed is to be seen in the fact that in one particular type there is a bl endi ng of Shu with Horus in Horus - Shuti, and that this is repeated in the story of Moses, who represents the deliverer as Horus in the ark of papyr us, and Anhur in other aspects of the character. Moses is the water - bor n. Josephu s expl ains the name as signi fying one who was taken out of the water. Pharaoh’ s daught er called the name of the child Mosheh, and said, “because I drew him out of the water” (Ex. II. 10) . Shu - Anhur likewise is the water - bor n. He is addressed in the Magic Papyr us as “the uni que lord i ssuing from the Nun,” which is the firmamental water, and from which Shu as the breathing - force was bor n as the son of Nun. The grow th of a legend from its sour ce in the primitive representation or mythicizing of natural phe nom ena dow n to its becoming hum anized at last as biblical and historical may be exemplified by the story of the child who was saved from the waters in a little ark of bul rush or papyr us - reed. It is told of Sargon in Assyria, of Maui in New Zealand, and various other children who were dr awn forth from the water at the time of their birth. It is the myth of the child - Horus, first and far away the oldest in the world. The story has to be read backw ard in Hebrew a very long way before its primal meaning can be com prehende d. In goi ng back we meet at first with the child - Horus floating in an ark upon the waters. The speaker in the Ritual at the time of his re - birth says, “I am coffined in an ark like Horus, to whom his cradle is brought .” This cradle is often represented as a nest of papyr us - re ed= the ark of bulrushes in the biblical version (Rit., ch. 130) . This in its most primitive Egypt ian form was the flow er of the papyr us - plant, or later lotus. On this child - Horus is upbor ne from out the waters, which led to the Egypt ian ark or boa t that wa s made of papyrus - reeds. When the legend of child - Horus on his papyr us, or in his nest of reeds, took its Hebrew form, the little ark in which the child was saved is made of bul rushes, or som e other form of rush called a m N , which proba bly represents the Eg ypt ian kama, a reed, the reed of Egypt , therefore the papyr us - reed. According to the legenda ry lore, repeated with a wise word of caution by Josephus , the young child Moses, saved from the river in the ark, was adopt ed and named by Thermutis. This name is a title 663 "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"of the Great Mother Mut in Egypt ian, the cons ort of Amen - Ra. But the genesis of the name from Mut the mother and Ta - Ur, which signi fies the first and oldest, she who was persona lized in Ta - Urt, show s that the Mut or mother, Thermutis, in her primordial form was Ta - Ur - Mut=Thermutis. Again, we learn from the same sour ce that the black or Ethiopi an wom an who became the second wife of Moses was named Tharuis or Tharvis. In the Greek rende ring of the Egypt ian Ta - Ur (or Ta - Urt) this name becom es Tho ueris, and in Ta - Ur(t) we can identify the prototype of Thermutis and the original of Thoue ris or Tharuis ( Antiq. B. 2, 10, 2). Both the foster - mother and the wife of Moses are here traced back to the old First Mother as Taurt and Thermutis, who are one an d the same, in the Egypt ian godde ss that first brought forth the divine child from the waters or from the marshes and the bul rushes, as Uati or as Apt, the water - cow , the most ancient form of the Great Mother in Egypt ian mythol ogy. In the Hebrew legends th e same old mother, unde r two names which are resolved into one , suppl ies two characters as the foster - mother and the cons ort of Moses. Now , the old First Mother Ta - Ur - Mut, who saved the young child from the waters in her primitive ark, is designa ted “the m other of him who is married to his mother.” In like manne r the mother (or foster - mother) and wife of Moses are one and the same god. Moses is saved from the water by Thermutis (Ta - Ur, as Mut, the mother), and he was married to Thaueris, who is the same by name and nature as Thermutis. Thus Moses also was bot h the child and the cons ort of his mother, which had been the status of the young sun - god from the time when the human fatherhood had not been indi vidua lized. Lastly, the two characters of the old First Mother are the two divine sisters, Isis and Nepht hys , into which the old First Genetrix was divided as the water - mother and the mother - earth. Isis is an earth - mother who carries the basket of seed on her head. As it is said in the Ritual, Horus the child i s produc ed by Isis (from the water) and nour ished by Nepht hys (on the earth) (Rit. 17). And these two forms of the divine mother can be detected even in their biblical gui se as the mother and the foster - mother of the young child Moses, one of whom saves hi m from the waters in the ark of bul rushes, just as Isis mothers Horus in the element of water and Nepht hys nour ishes and mothers him on land. There is not hing hum an or historical about the you ng child saved from the waters unde r any name whatsoever, in an y kind of ark, no matter in what langua ge the legend may be told or in what waters the little ark may float. The same legend is related of the mythical Sargon in the cune iform tablets. He says, “My mother the Princess conc eived me; in a secret place she br ought me forth. She placed me in a basket of reeds; with bitum en my exit she closed; she gave me to the river, which drow ned me not .” When Sargon says, “My mother kne w not my father” ( Records of the Past, vol . V, p. 3, First Series), he is claiming to be t hat divine child whos e onl y parent was the divine virgin mother, like Neith, the bringe r - forth of Horus (or Helios) without the male proge nitorship. 664 The hidde n birth of the Child - Horus is also repeated for the Hebrew infant, of whom it is said that when his mother saw that he was a goodl y child “she hid him three mont hs” (Ex. II. 2, 3), to preserve him from the death decreed by the cruel Pharaoh. The time may not be given in any know n hierogl yphi c text, but the lengt h is correct according"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"to the astr onom ical data. Child - Horus at a later time was bor n in the winter solstice and the conc ealment in the nether earth came to an end in the vernal equi nox . Therefore his mother hid him in the marshes and the rushes of Amenta for three mont hs. When the babe wa s placed in the ark of bulrushes and laid in the flags by the river’s brink his sister was in charge of him. “And his sister stood far off to know what woul d be done to him” (II. 4, 5). And in the Hym n to Osiris it is said of the Child - Horus, “His sister t ook care of him by dissipating his enemies and repelling bad luck. She is wise of tongue , and beneficent of will and words” ( Records, vol . IV, p. 101) , as was the sister of Moses in her sugge stion to the daught er of Pharaoh. Horus on his papyr us is the you thful god uplifted from the dark waters and saved from the coils of the Apap - reptile — a salvation that is effected by the two divine sisters Isis and Nepht hys , one of whom was the conc eiver of the child, the other being the nur se. Here as elsewhere it is th e same in the mythos as in the “history.” In the biblical version the daught er of Pharaoh and the sister of Moses take the place of Isis and Nepht hys . Here the cruel Pharaoh in the book of Exodus plays the same part as Herod and other tyrants who massacre the innoc ents, inasmuch as he com mands the two midw ives to kill all the male children at the time of their birth by drow ning (Ex. I. 22) . The hum an innoc ents were to be murdered en masse so as to include the divine child in the massacre. Only two midw ives were appoi nted to deliver all the parturient wom en of Israel in Egypt . The mythos will also answer for this limited num ber. In the Osirian system the divine child was brought forth by the two sisters Isis and Nepht hys . In an earlier rende ring these were Se khe t and Neith. Josephus states that the two midw ives given to the Jewish wom en by the Pharaoh were Egypt ians (Ant. II. 9, 2). And as the midw ives were but two for all the multitude of the children of Israel, they are evidently a form of the two mythical b ringe rs - forth, who were Isi s and Nepht hys in the Osirian religion and Ius ā as and Neb - hetep in the cult of Atum - Ra. In certain of the extra - biblical features of the Mosaic mythos the low er Egypt of Amenta is plainly indi cated as the real land of the exodus . For example, when Moses w ent into India, he and his army enjoye d the light of the sun dur ing the night - time, and this coul d onl y occur in the low er earth which the sun illum inated by night — that is, the land of Amenta. Indi a, Sindhu and Hendu each represent the Egypt ian Khentu, whi ch is a name for the interior. Thus , we identify the mythical Indi a with Khentu, and Khentu is the interior within the earth where the sun shone at night for Moses and his warriors in the Osirian Khentu - Amenta. Also when Moses is identified with Shu - Anhur this may account for his legenda ry reput ation out side the Bible history as a mighty warrior. Anhur in Egypt is Har - Tesh, the red god Mars, or Arês, who passed into the Greek mythol ogy by name as the great warrior Onour is=Anhur . Shu - Anhur is addr essed unde r 665 various names conne cted with his deeds. “Thou wieldest thy spear to pierce the head of the serpent Nekau, in that name which is thine of the god provi ded with horns.” “Thou seizest thy spear and ove rthrow est the wicked (the Sebau), in that name whic h is thine of Horus the striker!” “Thou destroye st the An of Tokhe nti in that name which is thine of Doubl e abode of Ra.” “Thou strikest the Menti and the Sati in that name which is thine of Young - elder!” “Thou strikest upon the heads of the wicked in that name which is thine of Lord of Wounds !” (Mag. Pap., pp. 2 and 3)."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" In one of the Rabbi nical legends it is related that when Moses was conde mned to lose his head for killing an Egypt ian, the Lord permitted that his neck shoul d becom e as hard as a pillar of marble, which caused the sword of the executione r to rebound and kill the wilder of the weapon . This in the mythos is the state of the justified manes in Amenta, who prays that his neck may be invul nerable at the block of execution. In the Hebrew märchen the Manes becom es a man called Moses. Fragm ents of the ancient wisdom survive in many fool ish - looki ng legends . The Rabbi ns relate that Moses was bor n circum cised. So the kaf - ape is said to have been bor n in the same condi tion. “It is bor n circum cised, whi ch circum cision the priests adopt .” (Hor - Apol lo, B. I, 14.) Now Shu in one of his divers characters is said to have taken the form of a kaf - ape (Magic Papyrus, p. 8, Records, vol . X, p. 152) . Thus Shu, or Ma - Shu, as the ape in the mythos becom es the man Mo ses or Mosheh, who is said in the märchen to have been bor n circum cised, when the anthropo morphi c type had taken the place of the zoot ype . In anot her legend Shu the giant is portrayed as acting the part of a crazy man. The two characters are coupl ed toge th er when it is said, “Though didst take the form of a kaf - ape, and afterwards of a crazy man” (Magic Papyr us, pp. 8, 9). This may pos sibly suppl y a gloss to the action of Moses when he waxed angr y and smashed the tables of the law (Ex. XXXII. 19) . For this reason: Shu in this character is called “the giant of seven cubi ts” (or he represents a shrine of seven cubi ts), and he is then com mande d to make a shrine of eight cubi ts. And Moses, after breaking the tables of the law and acting unc om monl y like a crazy m an, is com mande d by the Lord to hew two other tables of stone like unt o the first, so that the Lord might write upon the second tables the words that were on the first set which the crazy man had broke n. Shu - Anhur is described as he “who put teth a stop to them whos e hand is violent against thos e who are weaker than themselves” (Rit., ch. 110 ). This is the character in which Moses begins his persona l history. The first thing he doe s is to slay an Egyp tian whom he saw oppr essing a Hebrew (and bur y his body i n the sand) . On the “second day” “behol d two men of the Hebrews strove toge ther, and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow ?” (Ex. II. 11 - 13). This cont ention in the Ritual is betwixt the twin - brothers Sut and Horus when Shu - A nhur reconc iles the two warrior gods where Moses tries to reconc ile two fight ing men who were fellow - Hebrews. Moses is said to have bui lt and altar, and to have called it “Jehova h - Nissi, the Lord is my banne r.” This, to say the least, is sugge stive of a t itle of Anhur , to whom it is said, “Thou com est here upon 666 thy stately stand in that name which is thine of being in thy stately stand, ” or on the standa rd (Am aat). Here there is the same dua l rendering pos sible as in the Hebrew, the stately stand an d standa rd being equi valent to the banne r. Moses carries the “rod of God” in his hand. With this rod he divides the Red Sea for the peopl e to go ove r on dry ground . With this he smites the rock in Horeb, and causes the water to spring forth abunda ntly. The plague s descend on Egypt at the stretching forth of Moses’s wonde r - working rod. Shu - Anhur is likewise the bearer of the rod. He is represented with the rod in his hands , and is designa ted “Lord of the rod. ” In the Hym n to Shu it is said, “Thou leadest the uppe r heaven with thy rod in that name which is thine of Anhu r,” the upl ifter of heaven"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"(Magic Papyr us, 2, 5). The origin of smiting the rock to make the water com e forth is conne cted with the rock of the Tser Hill, the moun t of sunr ise. The first waters that issued out of this rock were the springs of dawn and the floods of day. In the Ritual we meet with the hero who causes the water to gus h forth. He says, in the character of the great one , who has been develope d into a chief, “I make the water to issue forth,” or “I make water to com e” (117) . The striker of the rock with his rod or staff was Shu - Anhur , the impersona tor of the force that burst up out of the rock at sunr ise when the waters of day were onc e more set free. The water of dawn is called the “w ater of Tefnut,” she who is the twin - sister of Shu, and of which water the children of light “drink abunda ntly.” As one of these – who are the prototype s of the children of Israel – says, “I drink abunda ntly of the waters of Tefnut .” The waters of dawn (or the tree) were ascribed to the female sour ce, whether as Tefnut or as Hathor . And it is noticeable that in the Hebrew version the first to make the water com e forth by miracle for the peopl e to drink is Miriam, whos e relation to Moses is identical with that o f Tefnut to Shu. The legend of the one god who reveals himself upon a sum mit of a rock, whether to Shu or Moses, is a matter of mythol ogy, not a subj ect of hum an history, and as such the mythos is Egypt ian. “And God spake unt o Moses and said unt o him, I am Iahu, and I appe ared unt o Abraham, unt o Israel, and unt o Jacob as El Shadda i, but by the name of Iahu I was not made know n to them” (Ex. VI. 3). In the original rende ring of the mythos Ra reveals himself to Shu and the elders as the deity in spirit, livin g in truth. He has becom e greater than the god who created him. He tells them that although later in point of time, he is the one primeval sour ce who has been giving them light all the while, and in this new character he assum es his sove reignt y as god ove r all, the one beside whom there is none other. This is the deity in the Ritual who says, “I am the self - originating force. Behol d me, how I am raised upon my throne ” (ch. 85). He is no longe r merely solar, or one of the seven elemental pow ers. He is the go d in spirit — the spirit that is divine, and a type of that which lives for ever. This account s for the change of name or title which follow s the change in status. Ra was know n by other titles in the mythos , but as Huhi the eternal he was previous ly unknow n. In this character the god reveals his secret self as the supr eme one , whos e name is then 667 expr essed by the titles of Huhi the eternal and Ra the hol y spirit. The Hebrew deity Ihuh was not simply the one god in a singl e form of persona lity; he is the Egypt ian one god in his various attribut es. He is the one god bot h as the father and the son, who in the words of Isaiah (IX. 6) is the everlasting father and the prince of peace, who as Egypt ian was Atum - Huhi the eternal father, and Iusa the ever - com ing s on; Atum - Ra as closer on the hor izon west, and Atum - Horus as ope ner on the horizon east. He is the Egypt ian god of Sinai as the lord of Shenni ; the god who was “lifted up” in his ark - shrine of the sanctuary on the mount . He is the god of the Urim and Thum m im, or lights and perfections ; the Urai or Urur, of the winge d disk and other figures of the Egypt ian sym bol ism; the one god who was solar in the mythos and the hol y spirit in the eschatology. In the book of Exodus the one god Ihuh supe rsedes all other god s, El - Shadai and the Elohi m; and, like the Egypt ian Ra, he assum es the sove reignt y as Ihuh the eternal. It was in this new character Ra issued his com mands for an ark, shrine, or sanctuary to be made, in which he was to be lifted up by Shu, the suppor ter o f Ra."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" Ages before the Hebrew Pentateuch was written and ascribed to Moses, the one god had been worshippe d at On or Annu as Egypt ian unde r the title of Atum - Ra, and if he was made know n to Anhu r by revelation, whatsoever that may imply, the revelation was Egypt ian. This is the god who was one by nature and dua l in manifestation; one in the solar mythos as the closer and ope ner of the nether - world; one in the eschatology as Huhi the everlasting father, and Iu the ever - com ing son as prince of peace; the one god , called the hol y spirit, who was founde d typically on the hum an ghos t. This is the living (Ankhu) , self - originating, and eternal god . This is he who was to be lifted up as god alone in his ark or tabernacle on the mount of glory — that is, as Ra - Harmakhu on the doub le hor izon or in the dua l equi nox; the deity who gave the law upon Mount Shenni through the intermediation of Anhur or Ma - Shu, the son of Ra. In the so - called “destruction of manki nd” the solar god resolves to be lifted up in an ark or sanctua ry by himself alone . This sanctuary is carried on the back of Nut, the celestial cow . “There was Nut. The majesty of Ra was on her back. His majesty arrived in the sanctuary. And his majesty saw the inne r part of the sanctuary.” This creation of the sanctu ary for the one god Ra upon the moun t is follow ed in the Hebrew book. Ihuh says to Moses, “Let them (the children of Israel) make me a sanctuary, that I may dw ell among them. According to all that I show thee, the pattern of the dw elling and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so ye shall make it.” “And they shall make an ark of acacia - wood. ” The two toge ther, the sanctuary and the ark, cons tituted an ark - shrine of the true Egypt ian pattern. As Egypt ian, the ark of Ra - Harmakhu represented the dou ble equi nox in the two hor izons . This was the “doubl e abode of Ra” in the dua l dom ain of light and shade, the mode l of the Jewish arks or tabernacles that were to be erected equa lly in sun and shade. The part ope n to the rays of light was exactly to balanc e the shade or veil of the cove ring, and not to have more sun 668 than shade (Mishna , Treatise Succah, ch. 1). This was in accordance with the plan of the Great Pyramid in relation to the lum inous hemisphere and the hemisphe re of shade at the two equi nox es. The sanctuary of Ra was a figur e of the heavens. The Hebrew ark was a por table copy, a tabernacle fitted for an itinerating deity. It was the Kamite custom to represent the heaven in miniature as an ark of so many cubi ts. There is an ark of seven cubi t s, one of eight cubi ts, anot her of four cubi ts, in which the god was “lifted up” or exalted. Inside the ark there was a shrine for the deity, with a figur e of the god within the sanctuary. As water was the primary element of life, the nature - pow ers were he ld to have com e into being by water. Hence their images were placed within the shrine that was carried on boa rd the papyrus bark and bor ne upon the shoul ders of the priests. These tabernacles, cons isting of a boa t and shrine, were the sacred ark - shrines of Egypt . Thus the beginni ngs were for ever kept in view. The ark - shrine on the water represented by the boa t became a type of heaven as dw elling - place of the Eternal. Thus an ark of Nnu was cons tellated in the stars and pictured on the waters of the inunda t ion. The ark of Atum - Ra was depicted with the solar orb on boa rd, which was always red. In the religious mysteries, as already show n, an ark of four cubi ts imaged the heaven of four qua rters or, as the Egypt ians phr ased it, of four sides. As we have seen, there was an ark of seven cubi ts for the heptanom is, and one of eight cubi ts for the octona ry. This ark - shrine of"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"eight cubi ts is to be bui lt for the god to float in after there has been a great subs idence of land in the celestial waters. So likewise in th e “destruction of manki nd, ” when Ra becom es the supr eme one god, he orders an ark or tabernacle to be made for his voya ge ove r the heavens. The inscription was engr aved in the chamber of the cow that was herself a form of the ark as the godde ss Nut. Willi am Simpson in 1877 called attention to the Japanese ark - shrines or mikos hi, “which have many poi nts of likeness to the Jewish ark of the cove nant, and which are carried on men’s shoul ders by means of staves. Mikos hi signi fies the high or honou rable seat. T emo - sama may be translated ‘heaven’s lord’” ( Trans . Soc . of Bib. Arch., vol . V, p. II, 550) . Now , the first type of heaven’s lord that is know n to astronom ical mythol ogy was the ruler of the pole - star, whos e high or honou rable seat was at the pol e, like th at of Anup on his mount ain. In som e of these arks, we are told, there is the small figur e of a deity, which is no doubt the “heaven’s lord” intende d by the name. There were seven of these lords of heaven altoge ther, who, as here sugge sted, had been rulers of the seven pol e - stars in succession. Now , Simpson tells us that there are seven of these arks preserved in the temple of Hachiman at Kamakur a, Japan. “They are said by som e to be state - nor imans, but as these shrines are conne cted with the deified Mikado, they are most proba bly temo - samas or mikos his as well as nor imans.” This is conf irmed by a statement of Kaempfer’s. He says, “The mikos hi themselves being eight ,” the eight seats or ark - shrines answer to the Kami when the eight h one had been adde d to the seven as ove r - lord, but seven was the primary num ber of the Kami as of the Egypt ian Akhe mu or never - setting one s. We infer that seven ark - shrines or seats were typi cal of the seven rulers, in addi tion to all the other forms of the septenary, mounds , mount a ins, islands , 669 menhi rs, tow ers, temples, or cities that were raised on high to sym bol ize the seven stations marked by pol e - stars in the circuit of precession. Now , Israel is charged by Amos with having bor ne an ark - shrine that was obvi ous ly the tabern acle of a star - god or gods who were onc e the Elohi m after which she went a - whor ing (Amos. V. 26) . The passage in the revised version runs thus , “Yea, ye have borne siccuth your king and chiun you r images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.” The most proba ble rende ring depends on siccuth being a tabernacle or ark of the god, correspondi ng to the Egypt ian sekhe t, for an ark, shrine, or cabin, and on chiun, from chun, denot ing the pillar or pedestal of the star. Kûn signi fies to found , set up, erect, heap up, and establish; it denot es the highe st poi nt, at the centre, and is appl ied to the foundi ng of the world. The name was assigne d to Saturn as god in the highe st. But Sut was the earlier founde r of a world as god of the pol e, in conj unc tion wi th his mother, who first represented the mount . The siccuth as tabernacle, ark, or female abode is equi valent to the ben - ben or beth of the child, the god or king who as Sut was figur ed at times within the cone . The chun as pedestal woul d be the pillar of the star, and the images woul d signi fy the ark of the pol e and its star — in shor t, the Great Mother and her child, who were the primeval female and male as Apt (or the Egypt o - Semitic naked godde ss Kûn) and Sut, later Sut - Anup . The so - called tabernacle was a “hut ,” which agrees with the coni cal pillar or ben - ben as a figure of the pol e. The god of the pillar originated as god of the pol e; Sut was primarily and pre -"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"eminently god of the pillar, and El - Shadda i we hol d to have been a form of Sut - Anup on his mount ain of the pol e. In the solar mythos the moun t was figured on or as the hor izon at the poi nt of equi nox, the poi nt of turning and returning from Amenta in the circuit of the year, or from the low er Egypt of the mythos . Hence it was named Mount Shenni =the Hebrew Sinai. This was the place of crossing or passing ove r the line in the exodus or com ing forth from the land of bonda ge when com memorated as an historical passove r. The first day of the first mont h was the day of the equi nox. The Hebrew dua l year, sac red and civil, was based upon the doubl e equi nox. Hence the ark - shrine of Ihuh (Jehova h) is identifiable with that of Atum - Huhi , whos e title of Ra - Harmachis show s that he was the deity of the doubl e horizon, the doubl e abode , or doubl e sanctuary, first as Horus, next as Ra. This may be gathered from the statement, “And the Lord spake unt o Moses, saying, On the first day of the first month thou shalt rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony ” (Ex. XL. 1) — that is, on the mount which was the equi noc tial meeting - poi nt upon the sum mit, the point at which the rescued spirits went on boa rd the bark of Ra, as represented in the Ritual. “The tabernacle of the tent of meeting” is the full title of the portable d welling - place that was bui lt for Ihuh on Sinai, according to the imagery show n to Moses in the mount . “Moreove r, thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains. The lengt h of each curtain shall be eight - and - twenty cubi ts, and the breadth of each curtain four cubi ts.” These num bers correspond to the ark of heaven in ten divisions , with the four corners and the twenty - eight measures of a luna r zodi ac. Ten cubi ts also 670 was to be the lengt h of each boa rd of acacia - wood. The seven - fold candl estick we look on as a figur e of the celestial heptanom is and its mystery of the seven stars. It was thus the sym bol ism was com pounde d and cont inue d in the later rende ring of the imagery. The mount of the hor izon in the equi nox was the place of the two lions called the Sheniu, which also tend to identify the mount with Sinai. These two lions , the two khe rufu or khe rubs that suppor t the sun upon the horizon, are repeated in the two cherubi m that were por trayed upon the ark of testimony. One sym bol of Mount Hetep is a tab le piled with food. This is reproduc ed in the table of shew - bread that was to be always set as the obl ation in the presence of the Lord. Ihuh was to com mune with Moses from between the two cherubi m. The pos ition is that of Atum - Ra - Har - Makhu in the equi nox when he rises as the sun - god from betwixt the two khe rufu or lions on the mount (Rit., Vig. to ch. 18). Atum - Ra - Har - Makhu was the lion - god of the doubl e force, or the pow er and glory of the sun upon the mount of the hor izon. He rose up betwixt two lions wh ich imaged the doubl e solar force, and was also represented by the fore - part and the back - part of the lion. The lion in sign - langua ge was an Egypt ian type of the terrible (Hor - Apol lo, I, 20) . This was appl ied to the sun or solar god as an image of his dou ble force, and represented by Anhur and Tefnut . The hinde r part of the lion that is carried on the head of Anhur is a sign of force. But the fore - part, the face and front of the lion, which reads peh - peh, denot es the glory of the doub le force. The fore - par t of the lion or lion - god being the sym bol of his glory, this was not to be seen by Moses, who is told to stand in the cleft of"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"the rock whilst the glory of the Lord, or fore - part of the lion, passes by, and he is onl y to see the deity’s hinde r part. As Eg ypt ian, the cleft in the rock was the place of entrance to and egress from Amenta. The solar god who rose again as lord of terror was the lion of the doubl e force, the pow er and the glory of the god being figured and differentiated by the hind - part and the fore - part of the lion. In strict accordance with Egypt ian sym bol ism, the dua l nature of Ihuh was made know n to Moses — that is, if the prom ise was kept and the Lord revealed his hinde r part (Ex. XXXIII. 18, 23) . Moreove r, it was made know n by means of the l ion or the man - lion as zoot ype . Moses asks to see the glory, and the Lord replies, “Thou canst not see my face” and live, so terrible was the glory imaged by the lion’ s face. The glory being in front , the pow er was behind, and this alone coul d be seen by t he mortal who desired to live. The unbe arable glory obvi ous ly depende d on the Lord as solar lion because he had first show n his face to Moses “as a man. ” “And the Lord spake unt o Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend” (Ex. XXXIII. 11). On on e occasion, when Anhur com es into the presence of the solar god, it is said, “Turn thou back, O Rehu; turn thou back from before his mightiness=the glory, or, as otherwise said, “from him who keepeth watch and is himself uns een,” or is not to be seen, whic h is equi valent to the Hebrew “Man shall not see me and live.” Now , according to the astronom ical mythol ogy – with the twin lions statione d east and west – the lion of the hinde r part was to the west, the lion with the face of glory to the east, the place of s unr ise. The entrance to the nether earth was in the west. This 671 was the side of the Amenta through which the first of the two leaders was Moses; he was to see the back part onl y, whether of the doubl e horizon, or the god in person, or the lion of Atum - Ra. Thus , the statement that Moses was not to see the glory or fore - part is equi valent to his not being allow ed to enter the promised land upon the other side of the water, which was visible from the mount ain of Amenta that reached up to the sky. As show n by the Vigne ttes, there is an Egypt ian origin likewise for “the bur ning bus h” in which the one god was manifested to Moses in Mount Horeb. The Lord as Iahu - Elohi m was previous ly revealed to Moses in his solar character. As it is said, “Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro,” and he “came to the mount ain of god unt o Horeb.” “And the ange l of the Lord appe ared unt o him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bus h: and he looke d, and behol d, the bus h bur ned with fire, and the bus h was not cons um ed. And Mose s said, I will turn aside now , and see this great sight , why the bus h is not bur ned” (Ex. III. 1, 3). Now , this “bur ning bus h” is to be seen full blaze in pictures to the Ritual. There is a vigne tte to chapter 64 in which the bur ning bus h is saluted (figur e, Papyr us du Louvr e, III, 93; Renouf , Book of the Dead, pl. 17). In the texts the gol den unbu is a sym bol of the solar god. It is a figur e of the radiating disk which is depicted raying all aflame at the sum mit of a sycamore - fig tree which thus appe ars to bur n with fire, and the tree is not cons um ed. It images the lord of the resurrection goi ng forth from the state of the disk to give light (Rit., 64). The manes, withou t shoe s on his feet, saluting the tree with the flaming disk in or upon it, from which t here issue tongue s of flame, addr esses the god conc ealed in the solar fire, who is goi ng forth from the state of the disk, saying, “Shine on me, O unknow n soul !” “I draw near to the god whos e words were heard by me in the low er earth” (64). This was the bu rning bus h in which the sun - god manifested as"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Tum , whos e other name is Iu or Unbu , the bur ning bus h being the solar unbu. There are two corollaries follow ing this identification: the one is that the god of the burning bus h is the same as the god of the fla ming thornbus h named the “unbu, ” and the god being the same, the person addr essed by the god is the same in bot h versions , and the lion - god who is Shu - Anhur in the Ritual is the prototype of Moses in the book of Exodus . Further, in the manifestation of the bur ning bus h dual ity of person is implied. First it is “an ange l of the Lord” that appe ars “in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bus h.” Then the Lord or Elohi m speaks in person and calls on Moses by name (Ex. III. 4). These two correspond to the divin e dua lity of Ra and Unbu in the original representation, when Unbu (Horus or Iu) as the ever - com ing son of god the eternal father (Huhi ), is the manifestor for Ra in the flow ing thor n. The burning bus h, then, is identical with the “gol den unbu” of the Egyp tian Book of the Dead, and the “gol den unbu” of the Pyramid Texts is literally the “gol den bough” of later legends — as in the Engl ish work of that name. Here we may say in passing, that The Golden Bough cont ains a learned, large, and serviceable collection of data, but the theories of interpretation derived from the writings of Mannha rdt are futile. Besides which, mythol ogy is not to be fathom ed in or by a folk - 672 tale, and The Golden Bough is but a twig of the great tree of mythol ogy and sign - langua ge — a twig without its root . The reception of the work in Engl and served to show how prevalent and profound is the current ignor ance of the subj ect - matter. It was hailed as if it had plum bed the depths instead of merely extendi ng the supe rficies. The writer ne ver onc e touc hes bot tom ; never traces the com parison hom e either in the Assyrian or the Egypt ian version. In the former, for example, Gilgames goe s to the other world in que st of the tree of life and the fount ain of yout h. His desire is to learn how to bec om e immortal. In that other world across the water, not in the nether - earth of Arali, there grow s the tree of renewal. Like the Kamite Unbu, it is described as similar to the bus h of hawthor n in flow er, and its thor ns are said to “prick like the viper.” Wh en Gilgames touc hes the shor e of that uppe r paradise, he is told of this tree, shrub or plant, and it is said that if he can lay hol d of it without his hand being torn, gather a branch and bear it away, it will secure for him eternal yout h. The tree is ide ntical with that which grew in the sacred grove at Nemi, from which no branch was to be broke n. And beyond the Babyl oni an legend lies the Egypt ian myth in which the tree is root ed. The Egypt ian gol den bough is a bus h of flow ering thor n. It is a sym bol of t he young solar god who says, “I am Unbu, who proceedeth from Nu (heaven), and my mother is Nut” (Rit., ch. 42; Pyramid Texts, Teta 39). “I am Unbu of An - ar - ef, the flow er in the abode of occultation” (Rit., ch. 71) . This identifies the gol den bough with Ho rus in the dark and the bus h that flow ered at Christmas like our Glastonbur y Thorn. The golden bough or bur ning bus h is a solar sym bol of Atum - Huhi , who says to Anhur , “O lion - god, I am Unbu, ” and who thus identifies himself with Ihuh in the bur ning bus h. “I am Unbu, ” says the Egypt ian deity in the flow ering thorn, where the Hebrew god announc es that he is Ihuh from the midst of the burning bus h. The gol den calf in Israel had also been the gilded heifer in Egypt . Hes, the sacred heifer, was ador ed unde r th e name of Isis in the time of the old empire. This was also a type of the gol den Hathor , the habitation of Horus, her calf. The setting up of the gol den"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"calf for worship is likewise evident in “The destruction of manki nd.” It is “said by the majesty of Ra (to the calf - headed Hathor ), Com e in peace, thou godde ss, and there arose the young priestess of Amu.” “Said by the majesty of Ra to the godde ss: I order that libations be made to her at every festival of the new year unde r the direction of my priestesses. Hence it com es that libations are made unde r the direction of the priestesses at the festival of Hathor , through all men, since the days of old” (pl. B., lines 24 - 6). This was the worship of the gol den calf, thus instituted as Egypt ian. There was a specia l form of the cow - headed godde ss called the gol den Hathor, and a particular type of her child or calf know n as the gol den Horus. Both were imaged in one by the virgin heifer, or, as in the Exodus , by the golden calf, the image of the godde ss of Amu. A dua l type of deity originated with the child that was pot entially of either sex, or bot h. Hence the boy like Bacchus with the female mammæ, and the lad in Revelation with the feminine paps and girdle, or Horus with the female breasts. Also the lock of childhoo d, or the long hair 673 of the Egypt o - gnos tic Christ, represented this dua l type of deity, as well as “the long garment in which was the whol e world,” because it had been the clothing of bot h sexes for the child. Hathor in Egyp t was the godde ss of the go lden calf, or heifer with the gol den neck. One of her titles was Nub the gol den (Wilk., vol . III, p. 115) , and the godde ss Ius ā as, cons ort of Atum - Ra and mother of Iusa in the cult of On, was a form of the gol den Hathor , as is show n by the ears of the heifer in her headdr ess. Hathor was the Egypt ian Venus , also the godde ss of music and dancing, and of female ornaments, includi ng precious stone s, particularly the turquoi se. The calf or heifer of gol d was a befitting figur e for the cult whos e gods were Iu the calf, Ius ā as the cow , and Atum - Iu the bul l — the gods which they, the Jews or Ius, brough t out of Egypt in the Hebrew exodus . So soon as the metal was fused, the image fashioned, and the calf set up, the festival of Hathor - Ius ā as follow ed. “And Aaron made proclamation, and said, To - morrow shall be a feast to Ihuh . And they rose up early on the morrow and offered bur nt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the peopl e sat dow n to eat and drink, and (then) rose up to play” (Ex. XXXII. 5 - 6). The festival was pha llic, for the peopl e remembered Ius ā as, the cons ort of Ihuh and the divine mother of the non - ethni cal Jews, who were bor n Egypt ian. In conne ction with peace offerings , one might mention that Ius ā as was also called Neb - hetep, the lady of peace, and her son, Iu - em - hetep, was the prince who com es with peace. But the libation to the cow - headed or calf - headed godde ss was turn ed into waters of bitterness when Moses, according to the story, “took the calf and bur nt it with fire, ground it into pow der and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it” (XXXII. 20) . There is but one calf mentione d in the b ook of Exodus , but in the first book of Kings we see the type is dua l. “The king took coun sel, and made two calves of gol d; and he said . . . Behol d thy gods , O Israel, which broug ht thee up out of the land of Egypt ” (1 Kings XII. 28) . These in Egypt were the heifer that imaged the mother as the godde ss Ius ā as, and the calf of Iu, her sa or su – that is, her son – Ius ā as being a form of the gol den Hathor , who was the godde ss of Mount Sinai. Also it was pardona ble, if not pleasing in the sight of Ihuh, that Jehu did not forsake the gol den calves of Jeroboa m (2 Kings X. 29, 31) . The gol den calf was the great sym bol of sin in the eyes of the monol ators, because it"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"was a figur e of bot h sexes and pre - eminently sacred to the divine mother, Neith, Hathor, or Ius ā as. Al though the one god as the god in Spirit was evol ved in the Egypt ian cult of Ptah and Atum - Ra as Huhi the eternal, he was com pounde d with the child and mother of an earlier religion. His cons ort Ius ā as was a form of Hathor , the mother of fair love , who was the Egypt ian Venus , and the child was Iu (em - hetep), the wise yout h who became the Hebrew prince of peace. These were the gods which brought the Hebrews up or were brought up by them out of Egyp t. The later monot heists sought to exclude the child and mothe r from the nature of the deity, which was a holy family in itself, cons isting of the father, mother, and child. The mother was cast out , for the god to be imaged by a figure of the father alone . But the godde ss was cont inue d in her type s of the birthpl ace. Hers were the ark, the tabernacle, the 674 sanctuary, the temple, the meskhe n, the hol y of holies, as the abode of the divine child or rebor n god . Hence the Hebrew tabernacle or ark - shrine is the mishke n, which as Egypt ian is the meskhe n, the chamber of birth, that was imaged in the cons tellation of the “thigh” or haunc h of Nut in the astronom ical mythol ogy . This change had been made in the theology of Annu , as witnessed by the legend of the cow in the tom b of Seti I., in which the god is “lifted up” in his sanctuary as male alone. Nevertheless, there was a cont inua l recrude scence of the old Egypt ian cult, and a return to the worship of the mother, as is show n in Israel by the setting up of the gol den calf, and the denunc iation of it by the later writers. This worship of Hathor in the mount had already extende d from Sinai to Jerusalem as an Egypt ian cult. Eusebius relates that when Cons tantine was about to bui ld the Basilica, he discove red a “mound of Venus ” already raised above the Saviour’s tom b ( Life o f Cons tant ine ). This was a mount of the mother, who was Hathor - Ius ā as in Egypt ; and no one was bur ied in or born from the typi cal mount of Venus except child - Horus, or his other self, Iu - em - hetep, whos e mother was a form of the Egypt ian Venus . The primitiv e mound had been perpetuated, as it was in the Tel - el - Jehudi eh (near On). The mount which typi fied the means of ascent from the valley of Amenta to the sum mit where the glorified elect were taken on boa rd the bark of Ra is various ly represented in the Hebr ew version of the exodus . As in the astronom ical mythos , it is the one mount ain with several names, and, being celestial, it may be localized in num erous sacred sties on earth as the place of worship. The mount upon which Moses stood in conve rsation with I huh is identified with the celestial height , when it is said to the children of Israel, “Ye your selves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.” This, again, is celestial as the mount on which the pattern of the divine dw elling, or ark and tabern acle of the Lord, was show n to Moses. In the Ritual it is the mount ain of Amenta that touc hes the sky. It is said almost in the ope ning of the book of Exodus , when the call is made to Moses by Ihuh, “When thou hast brought forth the peopl e out of Egypt , ye shall serve God upon this mount ain” (Ex. III. 12) , which is here called Mount Horeb, the mount ain of God. It is also said of the chos en peopl e, in this ancient fragment of the mythos , “Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mount ain of their inhe ritance, the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for them to dw ell in, the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established,” where “the Lord shall reign for ever and ever.” This was in the mount of"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Jerusalem on high, the celestial mount of the gatherin g and congr egating toge ther in the Aarru - Salem=Aarru - Hetep in Jerusalem below by thos e who bui lt the city as out casts or coloni sts from Egypt . The mount ains are several. Elsewhere it is Mount Zion or Sinai. But the mount ain of God, the hol y mount ain, is on e, because it was astronom ical; therefore in the eschatology it is the mount for which they were bound as spirits, and not as leprous and abom inated mortals fleeing from the land of the Pharaohs . In making the passage from Amenta, the supr eme obj ect of att ainment is the mount of peace and plenty, called Mount Hetep in Egypt ian. Hetep is a word of various meanings besides peace and plenty. It is the mount of the obl ations , 675 one sign of which is a table piled with prove nde r. The mount itself presents the obl ations to the gods and the glorified upon the sum mit, on a scale that is worthy of the eternal feast. And this, we woul d sugge st, is the prototype of the Oblation described by Ezekiel (XLVIII), which is colossal in its magni tude . It is com mande d that a huge obl ation shall be offered to the Lord, with the sanctuary in the midst thereof. It is to be “an obl ation from the obl ation of the land, ” just as Hetep was the obl ation to the heaven from the offerings made by the worshippe rs on earth as cont ribut ions to the table of the Lord. The mound - bui lders raised their mount or mound of oblation in Britain the size of Silbury Hill. Here it is to be a city the size of paradise, or the New Jerusalem, the eternal city bui lt upon the squa re, and therefore a heaven of the four qua rters, raised upon twelve pillars erected round the mount . The difficulty of identifying Sinai as a geogr aphi cal mount , according to the book of Exodus , may be expl ained when we know that the beginni ngs were not geogr aphi cal, and that the moun t on which Shu - Anhur shared the throne of Ra his father was the mount ain in Amenta, not on earth. It was the stellar mount of glory in the eschatology which had been the mount of sunr ise in the mythol ogy. After the passage of the Red Sea, in the exodus , t he children of Israel arrive at “the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai” (Ex. XVI. 1). This wilderness can be identified in the Ritual with Anrutef, the region of sterility. After passing the red pool , lake, or sea, we com e to the desert of Anrutef, which is said to be near She ni. Here there is som e evidence to show that the Hebrew Sinai is derived from the Egypt ian Sheni. Ra, the solar god , is designa ted lord of Sheni in the Ritual. The speaker in chapter 36 says, “I am Khnum , the lord of S heni,” or Shennu , equi valent to Sinai in Hebrew. When Osiris becom es the supr eme lord of the mount ain in Amenta he is also described as the “com mande r in the region of She ni.” He is a form of that lord ove r all who gave the Com mandm ents on Mount Sinai. Hor us also issues from the region of Sheni with the other divine chiefs who repul se the enemies of Osiris in these battles against his enemies. He also is the lord who came from Sinai. The word Shennu or Sheni in Egypt ian also denot es an orbit, the circuit or circle, to turn and return. Hence the solar god was designa ted lord of Sheni. Mount Sheni, as the place of turning and returning, is the mount of the equi nox . This was the mount of the two lions, and these also are the Sheni by name. Ra may be Khnum or Am en or Atum , according to the cult. The Ra of Annu was Atum , otherwise Huhi , whom we also identify as the Hebrew god Ihuh . In the vigne ttes to the Ritual, Atum - Ra, the one god living in truth, is por trayed upon the sum mit of the mount of glory, with the sev en spirits praising him upon the mount (Naville, Todt enbuc h,"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Kap. 16, A .), the mount of the circle of turning and returning and of the lions , therefore Mount Sheni=Sinai. The mount of glory in the Ritual is represented in the book of Exodus as a mount of f ire or the mount on fire — that is, with the solar glory. The circuit of fire about the mount is the “sheniu of fire.” This occurs as the title of a chapter in the Ritual. Thus the sun - god Ra or Atum - Huhi =Ihuh was the lord of Sheni. His throne was on the 67 6 mount of glory where he sat surrounde d by the Sheniu who form the divine circle of the celestial cour t. “The Sheniu of this chapter,” says Renouf , “are living persona ges who attend upon the Osiris and greet him (on the moun t of glory) with their acclama tions . The word is often translated ‘princes,’ ‘officers,’ but it signi fies thos e who are in the circle of a king or god, hence ‘ministrants,’ ‘cour tiers,’ as in the rubric to ch. CXXV.” (Renouf , Book of the Dead, XXX. Note 1). These Sheniu constitute the uppe r circle round the throne of God upon Mount Sheni in Egyp tian, or Sinai in Hebrew. Here it may be not ed that the Japanese call their divine Kami, the 7+ 1 primeval pow ers, the Shin, whence came the Shintu gods , which as stellar correspond to the Egypt ia n Sheniu, who are a group of gods in the uppe r celestial circle, and of whom it is said “the Sheniu marshal the Osiris” on his way to the “mount of glory” (Rit., ch. 130) . The descriptions of Mount Sinai in the book of Exodus show that it was the mount of glory in the solar mythos — that is, the mount of sunr ise in the daily cour se, and the mount of the equi nox as the horizon of the annual sun. Various meanings of the word Sheni coincide in show ing that the typi cal Mount Sinai, Sin, or Ba - Shen was the Mount Sheni in the Egypt ian astronom ical mythol ogy . We have to remember that as far back as the time of the first dyna sty Egypt include d the mount and surroundi ng region of Sinai as a part of the doubl e kingdom . Thus the Sarabit el Khadem was cons idered very hol y ground by the Egypt ians seven thous and years ago. It was the seat of Hathor there, whos e sanctuary of the mother was a primitive cavern in the rock. The turquoi se mines of the Sinaitic peninsula were also worked by the Egypt ians for the gems of the godde ss to whom they were cons ecrated. In fact, Mount Sinai was Egypt ian at any time from seven thous and to thirteen thous and years ago, bot h as a geogr aphi cal locality and as a sacred site. The deities who were worshippe d on it were likewise Egypt ian. It was t he seat of Hathor , of Atum - Ra, and Horus the calf. There is a vigne tte to the Ritual in which this dyna sty of divinities from On or Heliopol is may be seen groupe d toge ther on the moun t. The scene por trayed is on Mount Sheni, which became the Hebrew Sinai. In this, as in the Osirian dyna sty of deities, Atum the father was the bul l, Ius ā as the mother was the cow or heifer; and the calf as a type of renewal for either sex was an image of all three, as was the child - Horus in the anthropom orphi c representation. The calf is again represented in anot her vigne tte in presence of the god with the worshippe r (Naville, Todt ., Kap. 108 and 109) in the attitude of ador ation behind the calf. This is literally the worship of the gol den calf, which was a dua l image of bot h Hathor the Egypt ian Venus and of Horus as her calf (ch. 108 ). So ancient is it , when measured by the mythos , that Horus is the crocodi le - headed Sebek as the son of Hathor , who was represented at Annu by the heifer - headed Ius ā as. These three are designa ted the pow ers of the east. Horus of the solar mount is represented by the calf in presence of the great god Atum - Ra and the star of"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"dawn, or of Hathor as the morning - star. Professor Petrie’s expl orations show us that a trans formation of this old Egypt ian religion into a Semitic or Syrian cult took place at 677 Sinai amongs t the miners, many of whom were no doubt slaves who were sent to work the mines, according to the Egypt ian practice of devot ing captives to the service of the gods . But the godde ss Hathor and her child Horus, who were the obj ects of worship at Sarabit el Khadem in the Sinaitic peninsula, did not originate as Syrian or Semitic deities. They were Egypt ian from the first, and were cont inue d wheresoever the Egy ptian miners went, whether as the digge rs for the turquoi se gems of Sinai, the tin of Cornw all, or the gol d of the Zimbabw e in Mashona land. The sum mit of Amenta at the head of the valley was attained upon the hor izon in the east. It was the mount of glory in the solar mythos , which is Sinai, the mount of the glory of god and the seat of judgm ent in the book of Exodus . (“Now these are the judgm ents which thou shalt set before them,” Ex. 21. 1.) This is the height on which the kne eling Anhur , in the characte r of Shu - si - Ra, upl ifts the solar orb upon the hor izon, called the mount , from the sum mit of which the hosts of darkne ss were hur led dow n the steps and for the time being anni hilated. Also from this Pisgah - height the prom ised land was visible as the paradi se across the firmamental waters, which are represented by the river Jordan in the Hebrew exodus . A peak of Mount Sinai in Arabia Petrea is know n by the name of Djebel Mous a, the mount of Moses, which is traditiona lly identified as the scene of the events and occurrences on the mount described in the book of Exodus . Taking Mous a or Moui shé to be the Hebrew equi valent for Ma - Shu, the lion - god Shu, Mount Sinai is a localized form of the typi cal mount on which the lion - god stood to upl ift the heaven or sustain the solar disk with his two hands . This in the annua l course was at the equi nox, and therefore on the mount at the poi nt of turning and returning, or on Mount Sheni=Sinai. From the peak of Pisgah Moses is show n the land here called Canaan as the land flo wing with milk and hone y, oil, corn, and wine, which was one and the same in all the legends of this paradise of peace and plenty at the sum mit of the mount . Thos e who went up from the valley to the top of the mount ain neither died there nor were bur ied th ere. They were the glorified spirits of the dead, or the leaders of the starry hos t, like Shu upon the mount of Am - Khemen. Upon the solar mount of glory or Mount Sheni, the mount of the Sheniu, was the Egypt ian maat in which the law was given on the mount . This is the hall of justice. The maat was a doubl e law cour t, first erected for Anup at the pol e; but in the solar myth the place of equi poi se was change d, and the maat was represented where the annua l or periodi cal assize was held. This was at the poi nt of equi nox , which was at one time imaged in the sign of the Scales. Maat or mati in Egypt ian is the law. The maat was the hall of justice or of law. The tablets of mati in the maat were the books of the law. Ages before Osiris was enthroned as the great ju dge in the maat, Atum - Iu the son of Ptah was the divine law - giver in the great hall of justice which was figur ed on the mount , with Anhur as the intermediary. A divine law - giver was worshippe d in Egypt as Atum - Iu, the original giver of the law which was gi ven first by him to Egypt , not to Israel. But when Atum - Huhi had becom e the Hebrew Ihuh, the law was repeated at second - hand in Israel. The"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 678 tables of the law are identical by name with the tablets of mati, and the com parative process will show that t he matter is the same so far as the Hebrew records go; and if the law were divinely revealed and had any supe rhum an author ity, it woul d be as the law of mati, which was first inscribed in the papyrus of Ma - Shu or Anhur , and not as the law of the Hebrew Mos es, written in the later letters of the Pentateuch. Several meanings are connot ed by the word maat or mati in Egypt ian, such as law and justice, truth and right . The equi librium of the uni verse was expr essed by maat, which represented the natural immutable and eternal law. The balance is a sym bol of maat and its one ness in dua lity. It was erected as a figur e of the equi nox, or the two halves of night and day at equa l poi se. Makha is a name for the scales and to weigh. The scales were erected at the place of poi se and weighi ng in the equi nox. Har - Makhu was the deity of the doubl e equi nox, who represented the dua lity of mati in the one ness of the equi nox. The Sphi nx was a figure of this dua lity in one ness at the equi nox. The feather of Shu (or Ma) was anot her type of the same dua lity, in this case the dua lity of light and shade which meet and mingl e in one at twilight . The Hebrew “two tables of the testimony, the tables of stone , written by the finge r of God” (Ex. XXXI. 18) , are the equi valent of the laws, or t ruths and com mandm ents that were “cons igne d, performed, engr aved in script, and placed beneath the feet of Ra - Har - Makhu in the great temple at On to last for ever. The tables of the law and com mandm ents represent the tablets in the hall of maati. The table ts in the Ritual (ch. 28) are expressly assigne d to the god Atum - Ra. “This whol e heart of mine is laid upon the tablets of Tum , who gui deth me to the caverns of Sut” or through the dark passages of Amenta. The tablets of Tum are records of the law or maat. They are kept by Taht the divine scribe in the hall of judgm ent. We learn from the Ritual (ch. 28) that the Egypt ian tables of the law are the tablets or kanu of Atum - Iu; the same word denot es carving in ivor y and engr aving on stone , and Atum - Huhi is the Kamite original of the Semitic Ihuh . The tables of Moses were the tables of the law, and the law in Egypt ian is ma (mati in the plural). The tables or tablets of the law were produ ced in the judgm ent hall, and we know from the pleadings of the deceased in what is called the negative conf ession that these tables of the law cont ained the com mandm ents or prohi bitions conc erning the things which the manes says he has not done because of the “thou shalt not ” in which the law originated. The speaker, addressing T aht - mati, the recorder in the great hall, says: “O thou bearer of peace offerings , who ope nest thy mout h for the presentation of the tables (or tablets), for the acceptation of the offerings and for the establishm ent of mati (law or justice) upon her thron e; let the tables be brought forward and let the truth be firmly established” (Rit., ch. 41) . These tablets, we repeat, were the tables of the law (ma, maat, or mati); they are produc ed at the trial before the judge s when the heart (character) of the decea sed is weighe d in the balance of Mati and the godde ss (of law or justice) is established on her throne . Otherwise stated, when the law was given in the judgm ent hall upon Mount Sheni or the mount ain of Amenta. The religion of Egypt was based on maat, that is, on law, or more abstractly on 679 "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"truth and justice. And the law was impersona ted in the godde ss Mati, the Kamite original of the Greek Themis. It is said in the Ritual, “The gods and their sym bol s com e into existence by virtue of law” (ch. 50) . This in one sense was by means of Ma or Ma - Shu, the intermediary betwixt the great god and the people; who is represented in Israel by Moses. It is said that the Ten Com mandm ents were given by Ihuh, the Egypt ian Huhi , to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Jewish Com man dm ents, how ever, are not limited to ten in num ber. The ten are follow ed by a series of judgm ents or laws (Ex. XXI, XXII, and XXIII). And here it may be obs erved that the laws and judgm ents are identical in Hebrew, as in the dua lity of maati for law and jus tice in Egypt ian. Also in the book of Deuteronom y (XXVII) twelve statutes are enacted unde r the form of com mandm ents, enforced with twelve curses. And in the Papyr us of Ani there is a com pany of twelve gods sitting on twelve throne s as judge s in the maat o r judgm ent hall upon the mount — a picture that sugge sts “the Hous e of the Lord” in the celestial Jerusalem, of which it is said, “there are set throne s for judgm ents, the thrones of the Hous e of David” (Ps. CXXII. 5). These, as described in Revelation, were likewise twelve in num ber. The maat is identified with the mount of God by Zechariah when he says, “Jerusalem shall be called the city of truth (maat) and the mount ain of the Lord of Hosts the hol y moun tain” (VIII. 3, 4). The law was given to Israel on Mo unt Sinai, where the sanctuary or divine dw elling answers to the maat. Also when Ihuh com es “to judge the world with right eous ness, and the peopl es with his truth” (Ps. XCVI. 13) , that is according to maati in the maat. “Thou shalt have no other god but Ih uh,” in the book assigne d to Moses, was preceded ages earlier in the books of Ma - Shu and Taht at On by “Thou shalt have no other god but Huhi the eternal one ,” besides whom there was none other in the cult of Atum - Ra. Thus the god Ihuh is one with Atum - Huh i the eternal. Mount Sinai is one with Mount Sheni, whether as the mount of the lions or of turning in the solar orbit; and Moses is one with Anhur . The tabernacle or sanctuary of Ihuh is one with that of Atum - Huhi . The tables of the law that were given to Moses are identical with the tablets of the law in the hall of mati. This taps onc e more the sealed - up sour ce of “God’ s Word,” which was derived from the Egypt ian wisdom written in the books of Taht and Shu that were preserved in the great library of On ( Annu) , where Atum - Huhi was god the father, and Iu was the ever - com ing son, the prince of peace in person, the Egypt ian Jesus, Iusa, or Iu - em - hetep. Most of the Hebrew com mandm ents are acknow ledge d and fulfilled by the speaker, who protests in the judgm ent hall that he has neither said nor done any evil thing against the gods , but the follow ing quot ations will show that the Hebrew com mandm ents were com piled directly from the Egypt ian. The pleadings are in reply to the com mandm ents which the deceased declare s he has kept. The follow ing parallel will briefly indi cate how directly the Mosaic com mandm ents were bor row ed from the wisdom of Egypt : — 680 Egyptian. Hebrew. “I have not blasphe med a god. ” “I have not com mitted adul tery.” “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.” “Thou shalt not com mit adul tery.”"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" “I have not com mit ted theft.” “I have not bor ne false witness (or told lies) in the tribuna l of truth.” “I am not a murderer.” Ritual of the Resurrection, ch. 125 . “Thou shalt not steal.” “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour .” “Thou shalt do no murder.”  Exodus , ch. XX. Shu - Anhur , the prototype of Moses as giver of the law, has been som ewhat ove rlooke d as a god of the writings in which the revelation of Ra was made know n by him to men. When he is mentione d in the Ritual as the author of writings called “his rules (or laws) and his papyr us,” Renouf cons iders this to be an error of the scribes, and moots the opi nion that the god Taht is meant (Book of the Dead, ch. 110) . Nevertheless, Renouf is wrong. Shu is said to work in the abode of the books of Seb, that is, of earth (Rit., ch. 17) . This we can identify with the great library at On or Annu . (Se e Records, X. 138. ) “The papyr us or writing, mahit, of Shu” are mentione d in the Ritual when the speaker says, “I am in uni son with his successive chang es, and his laws (or rules) and his writings ” (Rit., ch. 110) . The book of the laws is the book of ma or mati, which was presented by the dua lity of Shu - Anhur and represented in that of Moses and Joshua . Shu is called “truth” (Magic Papyrus, p. 1, line 9). And as is show n by “the hym n to the god Shu, ” among the records that were kept in the great temple libr ary or, as it is called, “the roya l palace at On,” there were writings ascribed to Shu - Anhur , the lord of truth or mati. It is said of him, “He made hereditary titles” for Ra, “which are in the writings of the lord of Sesennu” — that is, in the collection of Taht, here called “the scribe of the king Ra - Har - Makhu” ; and these titles were “cons igne d, performed, engr aved in script unde r the feet of Ra - Har - Makhu, ” or beneath the feet of the statue of the god . Moses likewise is the writer of “hereditary titles” for Ihuh . He also fulfils the same rôle as transmitter of titles in the book of Exodus . When he asks for the name of the new divinity “God said to Moses, I am that I am.” And he adde d, “Thus thou shalt say unt o the children of Israel: I am (Eyeh) hath sent me unt o you . This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial for all generations ” (Ex. III. 13 - 16) . The writings of Shu - Anhur were preserved at On among the 36, 000 books that were traditiona lly ascribed to Taht. He wrote them as the mout hpi ece of Ra, or At um - Huhi the father of Iu, who was carried into Jude a as Ihuh the god of the Ius, Aaiu, or Jews, who brought on the sacred writings that had been “cons igne d, performed, engr aved in script,” and memorized for ever in “the roya l palace of On,” or Heliopol is M agna . Now the priest named Osarsiph by Manetho, who was afterwards called Moses, is reput ed to have been born at On (Annu) , and 681 to have been a priest of the great temple there, the temple of Atum - Ra - Har - Makhu, where the writings were kept, including thos e in which Ma - Shu had made hereditary titles for Ra - Har - Makhu to be transmitted from generation to generation for time and eternity. The most perfect rende ring of the name “I am” woul d be “the self - existent,” and in the hym n to the god Shu Atum - Ra is d esigna ted “the self - existent” (p. 1, l. 9). Also his other title of Kheper signi fied “he who is” in the Egypt ian tong ue. Amongs t the subj ect - matter of the exodus is the revelation of the one god that was made to Moses on the mount , which revelation had pre vious ly been made to Anhu r. It is to Anhur that the one god Ra who is"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"to supe rsede all other gods and elemental pow ers is revealed as Huhi the eternal. Anhur is represented as being the medium of com muni cation betwixt the god and mortals. “His subs tance is blende d with the subs tance of Ra” as intermediate pow er. He makes divine law know n to men (Magic Papyr us). As it is said, the peopl e present their offerings to the god with Anhur ’s ow n hands . Moses is represented as being the same to Ihuh that Anhur was t o Atum - Ra — his medium for com muni cation with the peopl e, the medium that was the hum an mout hpi ece for the god. So the ancestral spirit that inspires the Zulu Inya nga says to the medium , “You will not speak with the peopl e; they will be told by us everything they com e to inqui re about ” (Callaway). We learn from the very ancient magical texts that amongs t the 36, 000 books ascribed to Taht by tradition there was a particular collection know n as “The Four Books .” These had the titles of (1) The Old Book, (2) Th e Book to Destroy Men, (3) The Great Book, (4) The Book to be as God. There was also a group of four books that were astronom ical and astrologi cal. Whether these were the same or not , the “Four Books ” were in the temple of the sun at Annu or On, where Osar siph is said to have been a priest. The num ber doe s not coincide with that of the Pentateuch. But then the books originally assigne d to Moses were onl y four in num ber, not five. The wisdom of Egypt , in which Osarsiph was so profoundl y learned, woul d natura lly be written upon rolls of papyr us in the library at On, from which it was carried forth in one of the exode s from Egypt . The original nuc leus of the Hebrew collection cons isted of “the precepts of the Pentateuch” (by which the law was given), “toge ther with their traditiona l implications ” (Mont efiore, C. G., Hib. Lect., p. 469) . This, in a limited or pos sibly primitive sense, was the Jewish torah. In Egypt ian the Teruu is a roll of papyr us and the torah has the form of the papyr us - roll. Also torah, hrvt , denot es the whol e law, and in Egypt ian teruu signi fies all, entire, the whol e. There is a tradition of the assum ption of Moses in the so - called apoc rypha l “Assum ptio Moys is” ( Apoc ryphal Literature, vol . II, p. 177) . Such a mode of translation bodi ly doe s not appl y to any hum an being, unde r whatsoever name. But it was the way in which Anhur made his exit from the mount or from the mout h of Ra. Anhur is an entirely mythical character, and if he be the prototype of Moses, it woul d seem to follow that this is the origin of the legend conc erning his disappe arance on the mount . The present writer doe s not attempt to fathom the meaning of the mythos in the form of märchen to which the 682 tradition belongs , but the disappe arance of Moses from the mount may be t aken as identical with that of the god who represented wind and in the solar mythos was the breathing force of the rising sun personi fied. With the cessation of the breeze, or, if very fierce, the tornado, Shu - Anhur might be said to pass away, as a current saying has it, “like the devil in a high wind. ” It is recorded (Deut. XXXIV. 5) that Moses died hvh y yp li , literally “upon the mout h of the Lord” (Ihuh) . And Shu - Anhur was the breath of the Lord. He was the spirit of Ra as the breathing solar force emane d from the very mout h of the god, or, as might be, he was represented by the panting lion on the mount of dawn. At sunr ise on the mount the all - embracing, all - absorbing fires of Ra did veritably swallow up the force of Anhur , who passed away as breath from the mout h of the solar god . The"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"persona lity of Shu - Anhur is uni ted with that of Ra, the supr eme lord. His very subs tance is blende d with the subs tance of Ra (Magic Papyr us, I. 6), and is absorbed into it as nut riment when he passes away upon the mount or makes his change in character. Also there is a legend of Anhur ’s final disappe arance from the mount , an occurrence that took place dur ing a nine days’ tempest, and of which Maspero says, “We may here not e the most ancient know n reference to the tempest who se tum ult hid from men the disappe arance or apot heosis of kings , who ascende d alive into heaven” (Maspero, Daw n of Civilisation, Eng. tr., p. 178) . Thus Shu - Anhur as an elemental pow er had represented breathing force with lion - like capacity, the equi noc tia l wind, the breeze of dawn, but in the solar myth the increase of the twilight current was attribut ed to the sun; it was cons idered to be breath of Ra, the lord of all, which died upon the mount of sunr ise. This becom es the vanishing of Moses on Mount Pisg ah, Alphi - Jehov ah, in the Hebrew märchen. In rende ring the fact, which was scientific in relation to Ra and Shu at sunr ise, without due know ledge , the Hebrew writer has appa rently made Jehova h swallow Moses bodi ly as a hum an being, although the statement i s som ewhat reticently made, in causing him to die like breath upon the mout h of the lord. This was the “bur ial of Moses,” and there need be no wonde r that “no man know eth of his sepul chre to this day.” When Moses passed away or was dislimned upon that mou ntain of the Abarim, his rôle as army leader of the Israelites was taken ove r by the young man Joshua , who answers perfectly to Shu when the part of Shu is carefully discriminated from that of Anhur . Anhu r was the upl ifter of the stellar heaven in various forms – his “upl iftings ” are mentione d in the texts – whereas Shu was the suppor ter of the sun - god in the solar mythos . In the first character he pus hes up the heaven with his rod, as prototype of Moses with his rod. In the second he upl ifts the solar disk upo n the hor izon as the servant and suppor ter of the great god Ra. Shu had been all that Joshua is goi ng to be when he tells the children of Israel to “put away the gods which you r fathers served beyond the river and in Egypt . But as for me and my hous e, we w ill serve the Lord” — the Lord being Ihuh , one with the Egypt ian Huhi , the new god Atum - Ra. When Shu becom es the leader in his name of Shu - si - Ra there is a river to be crossed. “I am Shu,” he says, “the image of Ra,” “sitting in the inside of his father’s sa cred eye,” or the solar disk. 683 “I am the chos en of millions com ing out of the low er heaven. When my name is spelt on the bank of the river, then it is dried up. ” This in the Hebrew account is Joshua com ing to the river Jordan. After the death of Moses “Ihuh spake unt o Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’s minister,” saying, “Arise; go ove r this Jordan, thou and all this peopl e, unt o the land which I do give them, even to the children of Israel” (Joshua . I. 2). The white bull was the bul l of Shu, who was calle d the bul l, the master of strengt h. And according to one of the Jewish märchen, at the conque st of Canaan Joshua rode upon a bul l. When they came to the river “all Israel passed ove r on dry ground. ” It is the same with Joshua at the river as with Shu, at w hos e name “spelt on the bank” the waters dried up for the passage. Shu is the ope ner of the gates for egress from Amenta on behalf of Ra and the glorified elect who made their exodus from the low er Egyp t of Amenta pur sued by the Apap - dragon and all the hos t of darkne ss. The Osiris thus addr esses Shu: “O thou who leapest forth, conduc tor of the manes and glorified one s from the earth, let the fair path to the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"tuat (poi nt of egress) be granted to me which is made on behalf of thos e who are in pain” (Rit., ch. LXIV) — that is, on behalf of the sufferers in the Egypt of the low er world. The earth here mentione d is Amenta, from which the manes and the glorified were conduc ted first by Anhu r to the presence of the solar god upo n the mount of glory, and afterwards by Shu on boa rd the solar bark. Shu became the harbinge r of Ra and leader in the com ing forth from low er Egyp t cons idered as an astronom ical locality that was afterwards represented to be geographi cal in the Hebrew exodus . Thus , in the round of night and da y Shu - Anhur enters the Amenta at evening to conduc t the children of Ra up from the low er Egyp t of the mythos . His alter ego, Shu, takes up the leadership upon the hor izon east at dawn, to end the journey in the prom ised land or uppe r paradise of plenty and perpetual peace. The land of promise on the other side of Jordan is that paradise across the water which was on the sum mit of Mount Hetep at the pole, hence the circum pol ar paradise of the heptanom is, or heaven in seven astronom es. Thus in the book of Jo shua the prom ised land is mappe d out and measured in accordance with the astronom ical mythol ogy of the heptanom is. When the racial names are adde d in place of the divine, the seven divisions are called the seven lands of “the Canaanite, the Hittite, and th e Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebus ite” (Joshua III. 10). The final heaven attribut ed to Atum - Ra, as an astronom ical formation, was in twelve divisions . This formation had been repeated in the making of Amenta. T he previous heaven, cons idered to be antediluvi an, was in ten divisions . These were represented by the ten circles of Ra in the Ritual (ch. 18) and by the ten divine dom ains of the blessed in the paradise upon the sum mit of Mount Hetep (Rit. ch. 110) . This celestial formation was also represented by the ten tribes that were lost upon the other side of the waters, and by the ten sons of Jacob who preceded the twelve sons of Israel. But the later formation was repeated when Moses set a bounda ry to the mount a nd erected 684 twelve pillars, “according to the twelve tribes of Israel” (Ex. XXIV. 4). The same figur e of formation is again repeated when Joshua is com mande d to set up twelve stone s in the midst of the waters, and also in the Gilgal - circle which becam e the lodgi ng place (Joshua IV. 20) of the Israelites, who were cont inua lly on tramp in making the journey of the manes through the subt erranean world, which was in twelve sections of space, with the twelve gates through which Ra passes with the blessed on his right hand and the damned upon his left, in accordance with the Egypt ian rule of perspective (Book of Hades). In one form of the mythos , then, the Israelites divide the prom ised land into twelve lots among the twelve tribes. This is in accordance with the ground - plan of Amenta, in which twelve sections of space are show n to be successively enclosed as the pos sessions of the glorified elect, the chos en peopl e who originate as the children of the sons of Ra, headed by the twelve who reap the harvest - fiel d with Horus in the low er Egypt of Amenta. The gods of this nether earth in twelve divisions are twelve in num ber. The fields of divine harvest are twelve, the harvesters are twelve. The bearers of the measuring cord are twelve. The lots are also twelve. A ll being in accordance with the heaven that was mappe d out in twelve dom ains. Thus the land of prom ise in the solar mythos was the terrestrial par adi se of legenda ry lore. This was the land mappe d out in twelve divisions"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"where the type of plenty is the harv est - field of Amenta, and the cultivators are the twelve with Horus as the children of Ra. They formed the twelve coloni es altoge ther unde r the suzerainty of local gods , and were the prototype s of the twelve tribes called the children of Israel. In the seco nd stage the prom ised land is that more ancient circum pol ar paradise upon Mount Hetep first mappe d out in seven divisions , where the water - plants (aarru) suppl ied a primeval natural type of plenty. Both forms of the doubl e paradise have been reproduc ed as Hebrew, one in the book of Exodus , the other in the book of Joshua . The land that was to be inhe rited by the children of Israel is also described as a form of the celestial heptanom is which preceded the heaven in twelve divisions . Mount Pisgah represents t he mount ain of Amenta, the sum mit of which reached up to the sky (Rit., ch. CXLIX). This was the top of attainm ent for Moses, whos e jour ney here com es to an end midw ay. But from this poi nt the second uppe r land of prom ise might be seen. This is the circum p olar paradise or the celestial city in seven divisions , and in attaining this upon the stellar mount of glory Joshua brings the mythical exodus to its ow n prope r endi ng. Hence the men who were prospecting on behalf of Joshua “went and passed through the l and, and described it by cities into seven por tions in a book” (Joshua XVIII. 9). The prom ise made to Moses (Ex. III. 17) was that the Lord woul d lead the children of Israel “up out of the affliction of Egypt unt o the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittit e, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite and the Jebus ite; unt o a land flow ing with milk and hone y.” The Girgashite is omitted from this list of names. But when Joshua had crossed the Jordan “he came unt o Jericho, ” and the men of Jericho who f ought against Israel are said to be the 685 Amorite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebus ite. Thus Jericho in itself becom es a form of the heptanom is in which the tribes and totems are but seven in num ber, correspondi ng to “the seven por tions in a book. ” This may account for seven priests encom passing the city seven times upon the seventh day, blow ing seven times on seven trum pets of rams - horns in order that the city walls might fall dow n flat. Here let it b e remembered that in the astronom ical mythol ogy the localities are primarily celestial (Joshua XXIV. 11) . The descriptions poi nt to the heaven thus taken by storm as being a form of the celestial heptanom is or uppe r Egypt of the seven astronom es — the uppe r paradise that was inde finitely more ancient than the twelve divisions of the solar heaven established by Ra in his first sove reignt y, who is Atum - Huhi , the Hebrew Ihuh . In shor t, the siege of Jericho as a subj ect of the astronom ical mythol ogy is identical with the siege of seven - circled Troy. In various survivals of the self - same mythos there is a Delilah who betrays the city when it is besieged, and who becom es the consort or the ally of the captor. This in the Greek version is Helen of Troy. We learn fro m Plutarch that in the wars of Sut and Horus, Ta - Urt (Greek Thauris), the conc ubi ne of Sut, deserted and came ove r to the side of Horus, and was pur sued by a serpent (of Isis and Osiris, 19) . Ta - Urt was the Great Mother in the cons tellation of the Great Be ar, the old harlot of the heptanom is who deserted Sut and joined herself to the solar Sebek - Horus as “the great mother of him who was married to his mother.” Rahab the harlot, who dw elt on the top of the wall in Jericho,"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"the city of the seven tribes, is an other survival of the pre - monoga mous Great Mother, the whor e of later langua ge. Rahab in the Psalms and the book of Job is the crocodi le, a sym bol , a nickna me for Egypt . In Assyrian, rahâbu is a mons ter of the waters=the crocodi le. The crocodi le was a type of the old Great Mother Apt or Ta - Urt, not onl y in low er Egypt (Kheb), but in the uppe r Egypt where the waters were celestial; and Apt the godde ss passes into Hathor as the amorous que en (Ps. LXXXVII. 4, LXXXIX. 10; Job XXVI. 12) . The scarlet signa l place d in the windo w by Rahab is of the true typhoni an colour , the prope r hue of the red dragon or hippop otamus — that is, of the old harlot sitting on the waters of heaven (Rev. XVII. 15) . In conc lusion, the children of Israel, unde r Moses, travel through Ament a. They take pos session of a land divided into twelve dom ains, which the Egypt ian manes had already cultivated in the nether earth as a map of heaven in twelve divisions . Unde r Joshua they cross the water to take pos session of the ancient heptanom is which had been conf igur ated by the Egypt ians as the uppe r circum pol ar paradise. They are led to this land flow ing with milk and hone y by the hor net=the Kamite wasp or bee. This was the heaven mappe d out of old by the Egypt ians as the pastures of the seven cow s w ho provi ded milky abunda nce in the Sekhe t - Hetep, or the evergreen meadow s of divine Aarru. And it is the Great Mother, whether in her stellar or luna r character as Apt or Hathor in the mount , who plays the part of traitress and surrende rs the city to the s olar god. 686 The paradise looke d up to by the most primitive races was a heaven of perpetual plenty. That type was preserved by the Egypt ians in the fields of celestial food upon Mount Hetep, but , as before said, there was no une arned increment to be d erived from these elysian fields. “I am master there,” says the beatified spirit who has attained his allotment and bui lt his hom estead. “I am in glory there; I eat there; I plant and I reap there; I plough there; I take my fill of love .” “I net the duc ks and I eat the dainties.” “I am uni ted there to the god Hetep,” the good Osiris, as the deity of plenty and of peace (ch. 110, Renouf ). The Aarru was their oasis in the desert, well watered, with the sand turned into soil for seed by ceaseless hum an labour , and transferred into the nether earth or into the uppe r paradise. But in transmogr ifying Kamite mythol ogy into the Semite history, a remarkable om ission has been made by the inspired writers of God’ s Word. In the Egypt ian original the elect peopl e are cho sen as the cultivators of the Aarru fields, which are measured out and the allotments made for the expr ess pur pos e of cultivation. “Holiness to you, cultivators,” says the god Ra. The Egypt ians in their low er paradise of plenty reaped the produc e of their labour s, but they had to earn it indi vidua lly first. In the Jewish version of the Aarru it is a land flow ing with milk and hone y, corn, oil, and wine. But there is no demand for work, no thought of cultivation, or of earning an eternal living. On attaining this land of prom ise they were to enter into an inhe ritance prepared by the labour s of others, with no need to becom e the cultivators on their ow n account ; and this pos ition of the chos en peopl e as non - cultivators of the soil has been religious ly preserve d by the non - agricultural Jews for this world and by the Christians for the world to com e. Also the Jews have been and are to - day the victims of their misappr opr iated mythos . The mount was a stone of stum bling in their path, the rock on which they split.

THE SEED OF YSIRAAL. Only one mention of the people of Isr ael occurs by name on all the monuments of Egypt. This was discovered a few years since by Professor Petrie on a stele erected by the King Merenptah II. Not that there is any possibility of identifying these with the Israelites of the biblical exodus. The “people of Ysiraal” on the monument belong to those who were amongst the confederated Nine Bows, the marauders, North Africans, the Kheta, the Canaanites, the Northern Syrians, and others with whom they are classed. “Every one that was a marauder hath been subdued by the King Merenptah, who gives life like the sun - god every day.” This inscription gives an account of the Libyan campaign, and concludes with the following description of the triumph of King Merenptah: “Chiefs bend down, 687 saying, Peace to t hee; not one of the Nine Bows raises his head. Vanquished are the Tahennu (North Africans); the Khita (Hittites) are quieted; ravaged is Pa - kanana (Kanun) with all violence; taken is Askadni (Askelon?); seized is Kazmel; Yenu (Yanoh) of the Syrians is made as though it had not existed; the people of Ysiraal is spoiled — it hath no seed (left); Syria has become as widows of Egypt; all lands together are in peace (Petrie, Contemp. Review, May, 1896). The people of Ysiraal (Israel) are here included, together wi th the Syrians, and amongst the confederated “Nine Bows” who made continual incursions into Egypt as invaders and marauders, and who are spoken of as having been exterminated. Hence it is said, “The people of Ysiraal is spoiled; it hath no seed.” But there is nothing whatever in the inscription of King Merenptah corresponding to or corroborative of the biblical story of the Israelites in the land of Egypt or their exodus into the land of Canaan. The campaign against the Libyan confederacy had been undertake n by Merenptah, who, according to the inscription, was born as the destined means of revenging the invasion of Egypt by the Nine Bow barbarians. In proclaiming the triumph of the monarch the inscription says, “Every one that was a marauder hath been subdue d by the King Merenptah.” The people of Ysiraal in this inscription are identified by the Pharaoh with the nomads of the Edomite Shasu or shepherds, and are classed by him with the confederate marauders who invaded Egypt with the Libu, and were defeated wi th huge slaughter at the battle of Procepis (Pa - ar - shep, which is also recorded on the monuments. They were a tribe or totemic community of cattle - keepers, one of “the tribes of the Shasu from the land of Aduma” who went down into Egypt in search of grazin g ground to find sustenance for their herds in the eastern region of the Delta. At this very time, when the people of Ysiraal and their seed were being “wiped out” or annihilated as the Israelites in Syria, there was an exodus of the Edomite Shasu which ha s been pressed into the service of false theory on behalf of biblical “history.” These tribes had considered the eastern region of the Delta, as far as Zoan, to be their own possession, until they were driven out by Seti I. Now they bestirred themselves an ew, under Meneptah II (Merenptah), but “in a manner alike peaceful and loyal.” “As faithful subjects of Egypt, they asked for a passage through the border fortress of Khetam in the land of Thuku (Heb. Succoth), in order that they might find sustenance for themselves and their herds in the rich pasture - lands of the lake districts about the city of Pa - Tum (Pithom)” (Brugsch, Egypt under the Pharaohs, Eng. tr., one vol., p. 317). An Egyptian official makes the following report on the subject. He says: “Another matter for the satisfaction of my master’s heart: we have carried into effect the passage of the tribes of the Shasu from the land of Aduma (Edom) from the fortress (Khetam) of Merenptah - Hetephima, which is situated in Thuku (Succoth), to the lakes of the city Pa - Tum, of Merenptah -"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Hetephima, which are situated in the land of Thuku, in order to feed themselves and to feed their herds on the possessions of Pharaoh, who is there a beneficent sun for all peoples. In the year 8 . . . Sut, I caused them to be co nducted (according to the list of the days on which the fortress was opened for their passage).” (Brugsch, citing Pap. Anastasi; 6). Merenptah also had his royal seat in the city of Ramses. Here we meet with the field of Zoan and the store - cities of Pithom and Ramses which have been imported into the second book of Moses, and futile efforts have been made to show that this record corroborated the biblical version of the exodus. But in this exodus we find the Shasu or shepherds are peaceful and loyal people, faithful subjects of the Pharaoh, who are politely conducted from the land of Edom through the fortress (Khetam) to the lake - country of Succoth (or Thuku), the first encampment assigned to the Israelites, where they would find abundance of food and fodder for themselves and their flocks and herds instead of wandering in the wilderness for forty years, according to the other story. At the same time, or thereabouts, the people of Ysiraal in Syria were cut up root and branch by Merenptah. The passage through the land of Thuku, Hebrew Succoth, here described is apparently the route adopted by those who converted the “coming forth” from Amenta into the biblical exodus from Egypt, and it tends to affiliate the cattle - keepers in the land of Goshen to the nomadic t ribes of the Edomite Shasu (Gen. XLVI. 32). But we shall not overtake the children of Israel as an ethnological entity on this line of route, nor as the people who perish by the million in the wilderness of sand that formed the land of graves in the desert domain of Sekari. For that we shall have to “turn back” and encamp before Pi - ha - hiroth, and pass through the mouth of the cleft into the wilderness of Amenta. But it is useless trying any further to confuse the Jewish exodus with the 688 mythical “comin g forth” from the lower Egypt of Amenta, with intent to reestablish a falsely - bottomed history. The eruption of the Libyans and their confederated invaders in the time of Merenptah is a matter of historic fact. That they were vanquished and driven back by Merenptah is equally historical. They at least made no triumphant exodus from Egypt as 600,000 fighting men, for they never got there, but were fatally defeated on the borders of the land. The only people, then, known by the name of Israel to the Egyptian monuments are the people of Ysiraal who had their very seed destroyed, as claimed by the Pharaoh beloved of Ptah. These can be identified as a North Syrian contingent of fighting men who had joined the Libyans, or the old confederation of the Nine Bows, in their attacks on Egypt, and were hunted back in wreck and ruin, if not entirely destroyed, by Merenptah, the so - called “Pharaoh of the exodus.” Thus, if these were the same people as those of the Hebrew exodus, the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt would be turned into the deliverance of Egypt itself from the Libyan confederacy of raiding barbarians amongst whom the Israelites were a hardly distinguishable unit. What then was “the seed of Israel” as an ethnological entity in the eyes of Merenptah, o r the writer of his inscription? They fought as mercenaries and marauders for the Libyan king, who had made war on Egypt collectively, and were driven backward all together in one common, overwhelming rout. They came and went, and left no record of their p ast. Israel in Syria was not Israel in Egypt. Israel in Egypt is not an ethnical entity, but the children of Ra in the lower Egypt of Amenta, who are entirely mythical. THE TITLE OF PHARAOH. By the bye, so far as hitherto known, the name of “Pharaoh” i s only found in Hebrew. Some Egyptologists derive it from Par - ao, the great house. The present writer is of opinion that this title of the Ra was more probably derived from Paru the lion than from Para the house. The Pharaoh personated the lion, or the lio n - god, and sometimes wore the lion’s tail as the emblem of royalty. Then he was Paru as the lion and the hak as ruler. Thus the king as lion - ruler would be the Paruhak=Pharaoh. Moreover, and this seems conclusive, the lion - god is addressed as the god Paru (Rit., ch. 162), and the full spelling of the name (Paruhak) is extant in the Ritual. In an address to Sekhet (ch. 164) the goddess is called the divine mother of Parhakasa, who is the royal wife of Paruhak - Khepera, the king as lion - ruler or Pharaoh. Proba bly the Paruhak originated with Kheper - Ptah and his consort Sekhet, who were the parents of the lion - god Atum - Ra, and therefore of Ihuh in Israel. The chapter in which the lion - ruler appears as the Paruhak is one of the most ancient in the Ritual. It is sa id to have been written partly if not entirely in the language of the blacks"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"(the Nahsi) and the Antiu of Nubia (ch. 164), which takes us beyond Egypt as now known to the country of Sut - Nahsi, whence the Egyptians came in their course of descent from the e quatorial regions where they had dwelt in a land of equal day and night, the prototype of their double earth and of time in Amenta. We find from chapter 162 that this lion of the double force, the Paruhak, is invoked as the protector of his people. His whi p is used against their enemies. He is saluted as the lion of the double power who answers prayer and comes to those that call upon him and invoke him as the “protector of the wretched against the oppressor” (Rit., 162). These were the manes in Amenta. A c orroboration of this origin of the Pharaonic name may be found in Ezekiel (XXXII. 2): “Son of man, take up a lamentation for the Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou was likened unto a young lion of the nations.” Which he was as the lion - ruler Par uhak. 689 EGYPTIAN WISDOM IN THE REVELATION OF JOHN THE DIVINE B OOK XI THE process of making Scripture history from the Egypt o - gnos tic remains, without the gnos is or science of the ancient wisdom , may be seen appr oaching its climax in the Book of Revelation attributed to John the divine. It has been com monl y assum ed that this book cons tituted an historic link between the Old Testament and the New; but the Sarkol atræ, or worshippe rs of the word made flesh in one historic form of persona lity, th e carnalizers of the Egypt o - gnos tic Christ, have never yet discove red what the revelation was intende d to reveal. It has been taken as a suppl ement to the Gospels as if the history of Jesus had been cont inue d into the wedde d life after the marriage of the bride with the lamb, and that they dw elt toge ther ever after in that new Jerusalem which came “dow n out of heaven” “as a bride ador ned for her hus band, ” when the tabernacle of God which was to dw ell with man took the place of the old Jerusalem that was des troye d by the Rom ans. The present cont ention is that the book is and always has been inexpl icable because it was based upon the sym bol ism of the Egypt ian astronom ical mythol ogy without the gno sis, or “meaning which hath wisdom ,” that is absolutely necessar y for an expl anation of its subj ect - matter; and because the débris of the ancient wisdom has been turned to account as data for pre - Christian prophe cy that was suppos ed to have had its fulfilment in Christian history. For example, the lamb alone has pow er to ope n the book of seven seals. His pow er com prised the pow ers of the “seven spirits of God, ” the primordial seven. And, as represented astronom ically, when the vernal equi nox passed from the sign of Taurus into the sign of Aries the son of God was image d as a lamb, instead of the earlier calf or still earlier lion; thenceforth his was the pow er and the glory and the majesty, and his the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"book of life then newly - ope ned, in the cycle of precession for anot her 2,155 years.

The book as it stands has no intrinsic value and very little meaning unt il the fragm ents of ancient lore have been collated, correlate d, and com pared with the original mythos and eschatology of Egypt . To som e extent we are now able to identify the wisdom of Egypt 690 in the Book of Revelation and to “make sense” of the apoc alypt ic visions , so long and so errone ous ly assum ed to have be en unve iled to a Christian named John in the isle of Patmos, for the first time since the ancient astrono my was made nons ense of in the futile and fatuous attempt to turn the hidde n wisdom into prophe cy intende d to prove the truth of a spur ious history. T he apoc alyps e of John might be described as “scenes and characters from the mysteries of Taht - Aan,” who was literally Aan= John, the divine penm an. This was the sacred scribe to whom the 36, 000 books or papyrus - rolls were attributed by tradition. In shor t, Taht - Aan was the pre - Christian John the divine. His typi cal bird, the ibis, is still know n in Egypt by the name of John. His other zoot ype , the kaf - ape, is Aan by name. The name of Aani signi fies the saluter. This is the character persona lized in John. Spe aking of the ange l, he says: “And when I saw him I fell at his feet as one dead.” “And when I heard and saw, I fell dow n to worship before the feet of the ange l.” To salute was a primitive mode of worshippi ng; hence the ape, Aan, was an ideogr aphi c figur e of the saluter. The obj ect of the present section, then, is to show that the matter of “revelation” was derived from the Egypt ian astronom ical mythology and eschatology, and that the Jesus of this book is one with Iu, the su or son of Atum - Ra, who was por t rayed as the divine man and bringe r of peace to earth a many thous and years ago. The prototype of Patmos is to be seen in the Ritual (ch. 175) . John is in the isle of Patmos, “for the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus.” He writes of the god who died a nd is alive again, saying, “Behol d he com eth with clouds ; and every eye shall see him” “and they which pierced him” are to mourn (I. 7). To see how ancient this is, let us turn to the 175t h chapter of the Ritual of the Resurrection. It is “the chapter of n ot dyi ng a second death.” The divine sufferer is thus addr essed: “Decree this, O Tum , that if I behol d thy face I shal l not be pai ned by thy sufferings .” This Tum decrees. The great gods have given him the supr emacy, and he will reign “on his throne in the isle of flam e for eternities of eternities” (Naville, Rit., ch. 175) . The mission of Taht - Aan, the saluter of Horus, could not be better stated than in the words of John the divine conc erning the Christ of the gnos is called the Word. “That which was from the beginni ng, that which we have heard, that which we beheld, and our hands handl ed, conc erning the Word of life (and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare unt o you the life eternal which was with the Father, and was ma nifested unt o us); yea, and our fellow ship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ: and these things we write that our joy may be fulfilled” (1st Ep. John I. 1 - 4). Taht - Aan had inde ed beheld and heard and handl ed “the Word of eternal life” manife sted in Horus or Jesus, the ever - com ing son, for, as bearer of the sym bol ic Utat, he carried Horus in his hands and held him aloft as the true light of the world, and the sym bol ic"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"likeness of a soul in hum an nature that was begot ten by Ra, the hol y spirit and the father in heaven. Such was the revelation of Tehut i - Aan or Taht - Hermes. The pos ition of Aan, the divine scribe, in relation to Horus, the onl y - begotten son of God, is repeated on behalf of John in the Gospel. It is in the character of Taht - Aan that “there came a man, sent from 691 God, whos e name was John. ” The same came for witness of the light . He was not the light , but came that he might bear witness of the light (ch. I), as did Taht - Aan, who carries the Eye of Horus in his hands and testifies that Horus is the true light of the world, as son of Ra the solar god , and of the hol y spirit in the eschatology. John likewise gives his persona l testimony, not without hard swearing, regarding “that which was from the beginni ng, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, and our hands handl ed, conc erning the Word.” But the testimony of Taht - Aan conc erning the Word or logos as Horus was far anterior and just as persona l. Moreove r, he handl ed it by carrying in his hands the eye of ligh t, the talismanic maatkhe ru, and the papyr us - roll or book of life. The Ritual is the book which cont ains the divine words that bring about the resurrection to the glory of eternal life. It is a book of the mysteries in which the revelation was dramaticall y enacted. As before said, the chief revelation made by Aan, as we have it in the now recove red Book of the Dead, is made by the father in heaven on behalf of Horus, the divine son on earth and in Amenta. Horus as the Word gives voi ce to the decrees which Ra hath spoke n in heaven. In his form of the divine son Horus executes thos e decrees, and Taht - Aan, the giver of the written words (Rit., ch. 151 A ), is the recorder of the decrees for hum an use. It is announ ced in the ope ning chapter of the Ritual that Ra, the hol y spirit, “issued the manda te which Taht - Aan hath executed” (ch. 1, Renouf ). This was the revelation made by the father in heaven as testifier to Horus the son who is the “word made truth” in the books of Aan. It is the same ope ning in the Book of Revelation. The manda te is divinely given to John that he shall write “the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show unt o his servants,” and John, like Aan, bears “witness of the word of God,” which was primarily persona lized in Iu as the son of Ptah at Memphi s. The revelation of Taht - Aan in the Ritual begins with the resurrection or com ing forth in Amenta from the life on earth. The ope ning chapters cont ain the words which bring about the resurrection and the glory, the recorder of which is T aht - Aan. It is Aan, as writer, who effects the trium ph of Osiris ove r his adve rsaries on the day of weighi ng words, or on the judgm ent day. “Ra issued the com mand to Aan that he shoul d effect the trium ph of Osiris against his adve rsaries, and the com mand i s what Aan hath executed” in writing the Ritual (ch. 1). The Revelation of John is termed “the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show unt o his servants; and he sent and signi fied it by his ange l unt o his servant John, who bor e witness of th e Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, of all things that he saw” (Rev. I. 1, 2). Jesus is accom panied by the seven great spirits whos e place is before the throne of God. As Egyp tian these were the seven servants or seshu of Horus. Thus “the Reve lation of Jesus Christ” was given to John by God the Father “to show unt o his servants,” the first of whom are the seven spirits which are before his throne . This is the same as the revelation of Horus that was given him by"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Ra to be written dow n by Taht - Aa n, the scribe of the gods . Therefore we hol d that John the divine, as seer in the isle of Patmos, is a form of Aan (or Taht) upon the Mount of Glory in the 692 Isle of Flame. Not onl y are the seven seshus of Horus given to Jesus as his servants in Revela tion; they are also groupe d around him in their various characters by name, as (1) the seven spirits of God; (2) the seven as spirits of fire; (3) the seven as stars; (4) the seven as eyes; (5) the seven as gol den lampstands ; (6) the seven ruling pow ers, a s heads of the dragon; (7) the seven as ange ls of the seven chur ches. Thus the book ascribed to John the divine pur ports to cont ain “the Revelation of Jesus Christ”=Horus, that was given him by God the Father to show unt o his “bond - servants,” and these bo nd - servants answer to the seshu or servants of Horus in the original scripture. The subj ect - matter of this revelation is sent by Jesus to “his servant John, who bor e witness of the Word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ” to be set forth as a prop hecy of things about to happe n that were seen by him in vision; but which had been unf olded by the mystery - teachers of the heavens in an inde finitely earlier time, and in accordance with the gnos is by means of which alone it coul d be unde rstood. For the H ebrew versions of the astronom ical mythology in Revelation and in the Book of Enoc h coul d not have been com prehende d while the world lasts without the restitution of the Egypt ian original as gloss and gui de. Enoc h, like John, was in the spirit. His interna l sight was ope ned, and he beheld a vision which was in the heavens. But his vision was adm ittedly astronom ical. In it he “beheld the secrets of the heavens and of paradise according to its divisions ” (ch. 41). The record of his visions is called “the book of the revol utions of the lum inaries of heaven”; and is said to cont ain “the entire account of the world for ever, unt il a new work shall be effected, which will be eternal” (ch. 71). Enoc h says, “I beheld the ancient of days, whos e head was like white wo ol, and with him anot her whos e count enance resembled that of man,” and who is called the “Son of Man” in cont radistinction to the “son of the wom an” (ch. 46) . “I beheld the ancient of days, while he sat upon the throne of his glory, and the book of the liv ing was ope ned in his presence, and while all the pow ers which were above the heavens stood armed and before him” (ch. 47, 3). Enoc h was “elevated aloft to heaven.” He saw the new Jerusalem. It was a spacious habitation bui lt with stone s of crystal, with w alls and pavement all of crystal. He saw that the new heaven cont ained an exalted throne , the appe arance of which was like that of frost. To look upon it was impos sible. One great in glory sat upon it, whos e robe was bright er than the sun, and whiter than the snow . No mortal coul d behol d him. “Then the Lord with his mout h called me, saying, Appr oach hither, Enoc h, at my hol y word” (ch. 14) He sees the giants who had been the watchers in heaven as rulers of the seven colossal con stellations of the heptanom is in “their beginni ng and primary founda tion” (ch. 15) . Seven watchers are called up for judgm ent, and when tried are found to have been unf aithful to their trust because they came not in their prope r season. They are judge d, found gui lty, and cast dow n int o the flaming abys s like the seven mount ains ove rthrow n in Revelation. There is also anot her great judgm ent day com memorated in the "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"693 Book of Enoc h. This is the judgm ent of the seventy. Enoc h says, “I saw the throne erected in a delectable land. Upon this sat the Lord of the sheep, who received all the sealed books , which were ope ned before Him. Then the Lord called the first seven white one s, saying, Take thos e seventy shephe rds; and behol d, I saw them all bound, and all standi ng before Him. First cam e on the trial of the stars. Then the seventy shephe rds were judge d, and, being found gui lty, were thrust into the flaming abys s into which the primary seven had been previous ly plunge d” (Enoch, ch. 89) . The seventy were rulers, ange ls, princes, watchers, timekeepers, here called shephe rds in a heaven of ten divisions , which preceded the twelve and the seventy - two. This is the heaven of the Ritual, attained by spirits perfected upon the moun t of glory; the paradise of peace upon the sum mit of Mount Hetep at the “Atlantean pol e” cons isting of ten divine dom ains which answer in the eschatology to the ten islands or celestial nom es in the Astronom y. Thus , it is appa rent that a great judgm ent of Maat upon the mount , as represented in the Ritual, was uttered in o r at the end of the heaven in ten divisions . And this had previous ly taken place when the seven rulers were ove rthrow n, and the heaven in seven divisions passed away. The day, or a day of judgm ent, was periodi c, like the deluge . It was the endi ng of a tim e, an age or æon, som etimes called “the endi ng of the world” by thos e who were ignor ant of the sign - langua ge. It was but an endi ng of the world, according to the astronom ical mythol ogy, when the time had com e for “the dead to be judge d” and for “them that destroy the earth” to be exterminated like the Sebau in the Ritual. This endi ng was also announc ed by “a great earthqua ke, when a tenth part of the city fell” (ch. 11, 13) . There was a judg ment annua lly in the solar mythos . This is still celebrated yearly by the Jews: the same assizes that were held each year or periodi cally in the Egypt ian great hall of dua l justice. But the drama appe ars so tremendous in the Book of Revelation because the period endi ng is on the scale of a great year. It is not the endi ng of the world, but of a great year of the world. It is the day of doo m, the “time for the dead to be judge d,” upon the huge st scale (11, 18) . The last great day of judg ment is know n to all the genui ne books of wisdom com monl y called apoc rypha l, but the nat ure and mode of judgm ent were onl y made know n to the initiated in the mysteries. The great judgm ent of all, like the great “deluge of all,” was held at the end of the great year of all, in the cycle of precession. At the termination of this vast period it was the Judgm ent Day. Then follow ed the conf lagration by fire or the catastroph e by water, or the subs idence of the mount ains, islands , nom es, provi nces and other types of the Heptanom is; or the ove rwhelming deluge of the pol e. The Revelation of John and o f Enoc h bot h preserved a fragm entary version of the drama ascribed to Taht - Aan as the mysteries of Amenta, such as: the mystery of the Great Mother who sat on the celestial waters; the mystery of the dragon, with seven heads and ten hor ns, upon which the w om an rode ; the mystery of the seven stars; the mystery of the first - bor n from the dead who rose again as the faithful and true witness on behalf of God the Father. 694 In the first place, the subj ect of Revelation was not derived from the canoni cal gos p els. The funda mental matter existed ages on ages earlier. The cult of the lamb and"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"the bride is at least as old in the astronom ical mythology as the time when the vernal equi nox entered the sign of Aries, and the lamb of Sebek succeeded the calf of Horus o n the mount as the type of sacrifice in the cult of the Sebek - heteps in Egypt ( Nat. Genesis ). The doc trinal teaching of the mysteries is also partially appa rent in Revelation and in the other writings ascribed to “John. ” A fragm ent of the genui ne pre - Chris tian gnos is previous ly cited is retained almost intact in the First Epistle of John, who says of Jesus the Christ, “This is He that came by water and blood, not in the water onl y, but with the water and with the blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth wit ness, because the Spirit is the Truth, for there are Three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the Water and the Blood; and the three agree in one ” (1 John 5, 6, 7, 8). After the poo r pitiful apol oge tics of the Patristic obf uscators in this, as in a myriad i nstances, it is a com fort to touc h the truth upon Egypt ian ground. Horus came by water, as the child of the mother and bringe r of food, when he was represented by the papyr us - shoot , or by Ichthus , the fish of the inunda tion. He also came by blood as the in carnate mortal child of Isis. Lastly, in his second adve nt, Horus or Iusa came in the spirit as the onl y - begot ten son of Atum - Ra, the hol y spirit, who was the father of spirits in the Egyptian eschatology. In Revelation it is said, “Be thou faithful unt o death and I will give thee a crow n of life” (Rev. II. 10) . The crow n of Horus was the crow n of life that was the gift of his father Tum . Horus was lord of the diadem. Throug h him the deceased is made master of the doubl e crow n. The Son of Man has on his he ad a gol den crow n (Rev. XIV. 14) . The doubl e crow n worn by Horus of the kingl y count enance is magni fied into many crow ns upon the head of the Logos or “word of God” in Revelation (XIX. 12) . It was Atum who conf erred the crow n of triumph on the faithful fol low ers of that example which was set before them by his son. “Thy father Tum hath prepared for thee this beautiful crow n of trium ph, the living diadem which the gods love , that thou mayst live for ever” (ch. 19, Renouf ). The deceased, in presence of the gr eat cycle of the gods , is the “great one who seeketh the crow n” (ch. 133) . “He follow eth Shu and calleth for the crow n” (ch. 131) . “He arriveth at the Aged one , at the conf ines of the mount of glory, and the crow n awaiteth him. The Osiris raiseth it up” (c h. 131) . This crow n of life was always in view, not onl y to the mind’ s eye; it was also figur ed as an obj ect - picture to the climbers up the mount of glory. Proba bly our Corona Borealis is an extant representative of the ancient cons tellation that was image d as the crow n, which, when figured in the stars that never set, was a likeness of the eternal diadem that was conf erred on thos e who had attained the mount of glory. It was an Egypt ian practice to place a floral crow n upon the mummy in the sheta or coffin . The mum my of Aahm es I, the first king of the eight eenth dyna sty, was found to have been garlande d with roses for its bur ial. The “chapter of the crow n of trium ph” (Rit., ch. 19) show s the cont inuity of the custom in the nether - world, where the 695 garl and of earth becom es the crow n of trium ph for eternal wear. In the Ritual the judgm ent is designa ted that of the clothed and the naked. The right eous are clothed in the white robe of the worthy by the hands of Taht, and the wicked are synonym ous with the n aked in antithesis to thos e who are the clothed. There is a com ment on this in Revelation, “Blessed is he who watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame” (Rev. XVI. 15). The ransom ed spirits in the Ritual who are"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"redeemed f rom the mum my condi tion and all the ills of the corrupt ible flesh put on the pur e white robe of right eous ness, called the vesture of truth, which is given to them by Taht for their entrance into and com ing forth from the boa t of the sun. And being assimila ted to Horus, who fought his battle against Sut with a branch of palm, the sym bol of victorious renewal of life, the right eous also have the branch of palm given to them as typi cal of their conque st ove r death and Hades. The crow n of trium ph and eternal li fe, which is called the crow n of Makhe ru as an emblem of the word made truth, is placed by Atum on the brow s of thos e who are justified because they were faithful unt o death and thus have won the crow n of life, to live for ever with their God in heaven sin ce they lived for God, for truth, for right , for justice, and hum anity, on earth (Rit., ch. 19, 1 - 3). In one chapter of the Ritual it is said of the deceased, “The mout h of N has been thirsty; but he will never hunge r nor thirst any more; for Osiris - Châs d elivers him and doe s away with hunge r.” In Revelation it is said “they shall hunge r no more, neither thirst any more, for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall be their shephe rd, and shall gui de them unt o fount ains of the waters of life” (Rev. VII. 17). These take the place of the water - spring and the vases in the Ritual (ch. 178) . A second death is spoke n of several times, called the “Extinction of the Adve rsaries of the Inviolate God, ” “on the night when judgm ent was passed on thos e who are n o more” (ch. 18) . Thos e who suffer the second death are also spoke n of as thos e who are bur ied for ever. That is, they have no part in the resurrection from Amenta. The deceased says in ch. 42 “I am he who dieth not a second time.” In the rubr ic to ch. 135 it is said of the defunct “he dieth not a second time in the nether - world.” In Revelation (XX) it is proclaimed that the part of the conde mned gui lty shall be in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone ; which is the second death. This, in the Ritual , is the lake or tank of flame in which the evil Sebau and the enemies of the good being are anni hilated or extingui shed for ever. On the judgm ent day, in the Ritual, thos e that ove rcame are thos e who passed in trium ph through the searching examination of the judgm ent - hall. As we read in Revelation, “he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith. To him that ove rcom eth, to him will I give of the hidde n manna, and I will give him a white stone , and upon the stone a new name written, which no one k now eth but he that receiveth it” (II. 17) . This was given to the initiate bot h in the totemic ceremoni es and religious mysteries. In the mysteries of Amenta a white stone, or “a pillar of crystal” is given to the initiate. As he com es forth in trium ph from the examination he is asked what the judge s have awarded him, and he replies “a flame of 696 fire and a pillar of crystal” (ch. 125) . It is said of the Lord and his servants “his name shall be upon their foreheads.” In the Ritual “the name of Ra is upon the Osiris (ch. 130 ), and his toke n of honour is on his mout h.” This is said in the book of life, which is here called “the book by which the soul is made to live for ever.” It is also said that the Osiris has been initiated in the mysteries, but he “hath not repeated what he hath heard in the hous e of the God who hideth his face” (Rit., ch. 133). He keeps the secret sacredly. But the original book of life was no mere vol um e in which a name might be written. The words of pow er in the Ritual were derived fr om the Holy Spirit itself by Horus, and inscribed by Taht for hum an use. These divine words were to be made truth in the life"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"lived on earth, so that the spirit, when it entered the hall of judgm ent, was, as it were, its ow n book of life, written for the a ll - seeing eye. It did not live because Osiris died, but because the divine words or immortal seed had qui ckened and taken root , and been fulfilled= made truth in the indi vidua l hum an life (Rit., ch. 94) as the gnos is of Salvation. In Revelation we read of t he voi ce which was heard from heaven, “I heard it again speaking with me, and saying, ‘Go! take the book which is ope n in the hand of the ange l that stande th upon the sea and upon the earth.’ And I went unt o the ange l, saying unto him that he shoul d give m e the little book. And he saith unt o me, ‘Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mout h it shall be sweet as hone y.’ And I took the little book out of the ange l’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mout h sweet as hone y; an d when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter” (Rev. X. 8 - 11). A mode of obt aining know ledge by swallow ing the book was also employe d by Ptah - Nefer - Ka in the Egypt ian “Tale of Setnau.” “He placed a new piece of papyr us before him. He copi ed each word whi ch was on the roll. He had it dissolved in water. When he saw it dissolved he drank it. He (then) kne w all that it cont ained” ( Records, vol . IV, p. 138) . In the original rende ring the book of life was figur atively the food of soul . In the Hebrew version th e book of life is turned into an edible and eaten actually as a result of literalising the ancient gnos is. It was not a man named Jesus who was crucified in Egyp t as the Lord (Rev. XI. 8). These are the mysteries of Amenta, and the Egypt signi fied is the E gypt of that nether - world. It is the place of burial in the sandy realm of Sekari that will account for the streets that were choke d with dead bodi es. The lord who was crucified in that Egyp t was Ptah - Sekari, in the cult of Memphi s, Osiris in the religion of Abydos and Iu at Annu. The “crucified” belongs to a later terminol ogy . The cross as Christian was preceded by the Tat; the cross of Ptah or of Osiris - Tat — the god who was immanent in the wood or tree of the cross, and who gave up his life periodically in or on the cross as the sustainer of the uni verse. In the mysteries of Amenta, the Tat - cross was annua lly ove rthrow n and re - erected as the sym bol of salvation; and it was there the Lord was crucified in Egypt . A brief synops is will suffice to show that the Book of Revelation cont ains a version of the astronom ical mythol ogy which was derived from the Egypt ian wisdom . The vanishing heaven is the celestial heptanom is that was formed in seven astronom es, on seven hills, or seven islands , which 697 sank and pa ssed away like the lost Atlantis in the last great deluge of all. The most ancient genetrix is reproduc ed as the great harlot. She is the beast that sat upon the waters as a pregna nt hippopot amus. Her seven “sons of the thigh” are here as the seven kings w ho were made drunke n with the cup of her fornication or prom iscuous sexua l intercour se. These, as pow ers, are the seven heads of the scarlet - colour ed beast or solar dragon upon which the wom an rode . By a change of type , the scarlet - colour ed beast becom es t he “Scarlet Lady” of later theology; the wom an in red being subs tituted for the red water - cow . The Great Mother is now denounc ed as the great whore living in adul tery with her ow n children who originated in the seven elemental pow ers, to pass through sever al pha ses of phe nom ena as the seven with Anup, with Ptah, with Horus, or with Jesus and with Ra. In Revelation the mother of mystery is called “Babyl on the Great, the mother of harlots and of abom inations of the earth,” who has the name of mystery written"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"on her forehead (XVII. 5). But there was an earlier Babyl on in Egypt , know n to the secret wisdom , which is traditiona lly identified with the locality of Copt os, nom inally the seat of Kep, the Kamite mother of the mysteries. The mother of mystery did not or iginate with the scarlet wom an of Babyl on (nor as the red rag of the Protestants), although the title of the Great Harlot was appl ied to her also, who was the mother of harlots and to whom the maiden - tribut es were religious ly furnished in that city. Hers i s a figur e of unknow n antiqui ty in the astronom ical mythol ogy , which was cons tellated as the red hippopot amus that preceded the Great Bear. The red hippopot amus (Apt) had already becom e the scarlet lady in the Ritual. Hence the Great Mother, as Sekhet - Bast , who is highe r than all the gods , and is the only one who stands above her father, is called the lady of the scarlet - colour ed gar ment (Rit., ch. 164 , Naville). The Kamite Cons tellation of the “birthpl ace” may also serve to show cause why the “great harlot ” shoul d have been abus ed so badly in the Book of Revelation. The creatory of the Great Mother was depicted in the sign of the meshke n to indi cate the place of bringing forth by the cow of heaven whos e “thigh” is the emblem of great magical pow er in the hi erogl yphi cs. The mother of mystery also carries “in her hand a gol den cup full of abom inations , even the unc lean things of her fornication” (XVII. 4), such as the mystery of fecundat ion by water, which was the primitive mystery of Kep. This was sym bol ised in Egypt by the water - vase, and cons tellated in the sign of Krater, the urn of the inunda tion. It has been show n that the gods of the Egypt ian mythol ogy originated in seven elemental forces that were bor n of earth, the mother of life, and who were then con tinued in a variety of characters as the primordial seven pow ers. These are reproduc ed as the proge ny of the mother - earth, where they are called “the kings of the earth” ove r whom “the first - bor n of the dead” is to becom e the ruler (I. 5) as Jesus in the B ook of Revelation, the same as Horus (or Iu) in the Ritual, the god “who giveth light by means of his ow n body” (ch. 83) . The astronom ical mythol ogy was taught in mysteries by the mystery teachers of the heavens. One of the chief of these was “the mystery of the seven stars”; the seven that are described in the Ritual as “the seven glorious one s,” “the 698 seven spirits of fire,” “the seven great spirits,” who are also termed “the lords of eternity.” As never - setting stars the seven were beyond the bounds of time; hence they became the witnesses for eternal cont inui ty. Thus seven stars that never set were made a group of witnesses for the eternal in the eschatology. These in the Book of Revelation are the seven spirits of God, the seven spirits of fire, th e seven eyes, the seven gol den lamps, or lampstands ; as various ly typi fied “before the throne ” on the celestial sum mit. Certain deities in the Ritual are called the Khabsu gods of light , or of the lamp. When the risen Osiris passes ove r heaven unt o the we st, it is said the Khabsu gods of the lamp rise up to greet him with their acclamations . “Acclamation com eth from the mount of glory, and greeting from the lines of measurement” (Rit., ch. 130 and 133) . This is when the light arises in Kher - Aba and the chi ld, “he of the strong cord,” is re - bor n upon the mount of resurrection (ch. 136 A ). The num ber is not directly given in the “Book of the Dead.” But the gods of the lamp are obvi ous ly reproduc ed in “Revelation” as the spirits of the gol den lam pstands , whethe r as the group of seven or as the “two witnesses,” which are “the two olive trees and the two lam pstands standi ng before the lord of the"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"earth” (Rev. XI. 4). The word Khabsu is the name for a lamp, but , in the present instance, the determinative show s that a heavenly body is meant. Also, if a plausible correction, made by Renouf , be allow ed, there were Khabsu trees upon the mount of glory as well as deities of the lamp. Khabsu is the well - know n name of a sacred tree (Renouf , Rit., ch. 133, Note 4). This may be com pared with the two olive trees in Revelation, which were also two lampstands , as the two witnesses whom we shall identify with Anup the stellar god upon his mount ain, and Taht - Aan as the luna r lamp of Ra. Moreove r, the word Khabsu signi fies the soul or spirit as well as the star. Hence it is proba ble that the seven stars called spirits, the spirits of God, and spirits of fire, were represented by the seven Khabsu stars, or lamps, which were held in the hand of the young solar god as head of the seven , whether as Jesus or as Horus. No matter how these things were show n, or are said to have been show n, to John in Patmos, what we are conc erned to know is their funda mental signi ficance and to identify them with the lesser or greater mysteries, which are t he mysteries of Taht - Aan in the Egypt ian Book of the Dead. The writer John, who follow s afar off in the wake of Taht - Aan, makes an attempt at show ing som e of the mysteries in his Book of Revelation. Amongs t the more prom inent are (1) the mystery of the se ven stars; (2) the mystery of the wom an, and the beast with seven heads; (3) the mystery of the two “witnesses” and the four “living creatures”; (4) the mystery of the war in heaven; (5) the mystery of God (X. 7); (6) the mystery of renewal in the ancient heavens when every isle and mount ain vanished and the heptanom is passed away. In the mysteries of Amenta there is a resurrection of the body - soul , or manes, and a transformation into spirit. This was on the day upon which the god in spirit, Ra, calls from heaven to the mum my - Osiris in Amenta. This sum mons to the transformation of the mum my into spirit, “Com e thou hither!” or “Com e thou to me!” (in “Pistis Sophi a” it is “Com e thou to us!”), that was 699 uttered in the mystery of Tattu, is repeated and appl ied to John in Revelation as the mode of resurrection into the spirit. John says: “I saw and beheld a door ope ned in heaven, and the first voi ce which I heard, a voi ce as of a trum pet, speaking with me, one saying, ‘Com e up hither, and I will show thee the things that must com e to pass hereafter.’” Obvi ous ly this was the transformation into spirit that was represented in the mysteries. Hence the saying of John, “Straight way I was in the spirit” (Rev. IV. 1, 2), as was the Osiris at the call of Ra (Rit., ch. 17) . This cry of “Com e” is repeated by each of the four “living creatures,” who are the same in the mount that the divine pow ers, Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef, and Kabhs enuf , were in the resurrection from Amenta (Rit., ch. 1). John says “there came one of seven ange ls that had the seven bow ls and spake with me saying: ‘Com e hither, I will show thee the judgm ent of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters; with whom the kings of the earth com mitted fornication’ ” (XVII). The kings of the earth were the seven spirits of earth who were at onc e the children and the cons orts of the mother in accordance with the primitive polyandr y. “I will tell thee the mystery of the wom an, and of the beast that carried her, which hath the seven heads and the ten hor ns. The beas t that thou sawest was and is not ; and is about to com e up out of the abys s, and to go into perdition.” That is follow ing the final judgm ent. It is expl ained that “the wom an whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigne th ove r"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"the kings of the earth.” T his was the kingdom of the seven (Rit., ch. 17) , who ruled with the Great Mother in the celestial heptanom is. Som e light may be shed on the mystery of the four - and - twenty elders, seated on their four - and - twenty throne s, by the Egypt o - gnos tic gos pel, “Pisti s Sophi a.” In this crypt ic work the “mysteries” are said to be four - and - twenty in num ber. The mystery of God the Father is the first, the mystery of God the Son is last. These two are the first and the last in Revelation, the closer and ope ner of Amenta in the Ritual. And all the twenty - four are include d in the one great, uni que , ineffable mystery of the Father, manifested by the Son, as the dove , or the calf, or the lamb, upon the mount of sunr ise in the mythos , and on the stellar mount of glory in the esc hatology. In Revelation the heaven in seven divisions com es to an end when the seven thunde rs have uttered their voi ces and the seventh ange l has sounde d the trum pet of doom . Then was “finished the mystery of God, according to the good tidings which he de clared to his servants the prophe ts” (X. 7), which show s the interpretation of the Kamite astronom ical mythol ogy by means of biblical prophe cy conc erning the com ing Messiah. The heaven that “was remove d as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mount ain and island were move d out of their places” (VI. 14, 15), is also imaged as a book which had been closed and sealed with seven seals. This was the book of doom sday; the record pos sibly kept for six - and - twenty - thous and years. The book is seen in the right ha nd of him that sits upon the throne , “a book written within, and on the back close - sealed with seven seals” (V. 1, 2). We may not have all the necessary details for perfecting the parallel and provi ng the prototype to have been Egypt ian, but we obs erve tha t in the end of the world or the 700 “subs idence of a count ry,” described in the “magic papyr us” ( Records, vol . X, 151 - 2) as an ove rwhelming deluge , there is mention made of “the seven great dunge ons that were sealed at the time with an eternal seal.” It is also evident that these seven dunge ons were sealed singl y one after the other, as it is said of the evil beings who are at the time subm erged: “What is immersed, do not let it pass out ! Seal the mout hs, choke up the mout hs, as the shrine is sealed up f or centuries.” There is an echo of this in Revelation (X). “And when the seven thunde rs uttered (their voices) I was about to write: And I heard a voi ce from heaven saying, ‘Seal up the things which the seven thunde rs uttered, and write them not .’” The rec ord is to be sealed not onl y for centuries, but with the seal of eternal silence, or, as it is imaged, with the sevenfold seal. Seven times ove r in the great year the typi cal catastrophe occurred. The station of the pol e was change d. The island was subm er ged, the mount ain was dislimned. Then was the day of judgm ent when one of the seven dunge ons of eternal doo m was sealed, and this was repeated unt il there were seven altoge ther. It is in this papyr us that the ark or shrine of seven cubi ts is supe rseded by the ark of eight cubi ts, and the heptanom is of Sut is to make way for the octona ry of Taht. In Revelation the heptanom is of seven astronom es is sym bol ed by the book of judg ment sealed with seven seals. Seven seals are broke n for the ope ning of the book .

At the end of each three thous and seven hundr ed years in the cycle of precession the pol e - star change d, or, as represented, a star fell from heaven. Thus , when the second ange l sounde d, a mount ain (one of the seven) sank dow n flaming to be que nched in the celestial sea. This was one of the seven mount ains upon which the ancient harlot sat. At the same time a great star fell from heaven, which was one of the seven pol e - stars. When the fifth ange l sounde d anot he r pol e - star fell. The fall of the total seven has not been follow ed out one by one in stars. But the fall or wreck of the heptanom is piecemeal has been otherwise described; Enoc h saw it as seven blazing mount ains ove rthrow n. Seven type s of the ove rtoppl ing mount or station of the pole may be assigne d appr oxi mately: (1) to the mount of the hippopot amus (or northern crown); (2) to the mount of the dragon; (3) the mount of the ape; (4) the moun t of the jackal (or dog) ; (5) the mount of the bird (cygnus ); (6) t he moun t of the tortoise (or lyra); and (7) the mount ain of manki nd. To revert for a mom ent to the beginni ng of the Book, the drama ope ns in Revelation the same as in “the Book of the Dead,” with “the resurrection and the glory” of the com ing Son. “Behol d He com eth with the clouds , and every eye shall see Him.” It is the risen 701 Lord of Resurrection who says: “I was dead, and behol d I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of hades” (I. 18) . This is Horus of the resurrection risen from Amenta in his trium ph ove r death and hell or Sut and Akar. He proclaims himself to be the all - one , Har - Sam - taui - Neb - Uâ. Jesus, like Horus, is the “faithful witness” for the Father, the first - bor n of the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth who wer e the seven elemental pow ers that were bor n of the ancient mother, and afterwards elevated in anot her character to the sphe re, as spirits in glory, and lastly, as the seven lords of eternity. Risen Horus com es as the anoi nted onl y - begot ten son of God; His revelation is to make know n the Father which is in heaven as the God in Spirit. We learn from Irenæ us that the Egyp to - gnos tic Christ (or Horus) came to teach the seven pow ers who preceded him and who had no know ledge of the Father, and to create in them th e desire to inve stigate the divine nature and to make that nature know n. This was the revelation through the Christ who is the “faithful witness, the first - born of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth,” who taught it as a mystery of revelation . The secret of the mysteries was with Aan. The mysteries of Amenta in the Ritual are chiefly eschatologi cal. But som e of them are plainly astronom ical. In one of the texts it is said of Taht - Aan, “And now behol d “Taht in the secret of his mysteries. He is the maker of endl ess reckoni ngs ” (ch. 130) . As Egypt ian, the day of judgm ent was the day of reckoni ng, and the books were kept by Taht - Aan, who was called the reckone r of all things in earth and heaven. An item in precession is likewise recogni sable in R evelation in the statement conc erning the seven rulers of the heptanom is. “They are seven kings : the five are fallen, one is, the other is not yet com e” (XVII. 10). There is a date in the statement as it stands . The time indi cated is"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"that of the sixth pol e - star, which as here reckone d out was the pol e - star Vega in the cons tellation of the lyre or tortoise som e four teen thous and years ago. The “mount of glory” has been well preserved in the “Revelation of John. ” It is described as a throne set in heaven wit h “one sitting on the throne , and round about the throne were four - and - twenty throne s, and upon the throne s were four - and - twenty elders sitting arrayed in white garments; on their heads were crow ns of gold” (IV. 4). And in the midst of the elders was the l amb “standi ng on the mount Zion,” which show s the identity of the throne and moun t and astronom ically with the zodi acal sign of Aries. The mount in Revelation has been turned into the throne of the Father and the Son, but it is the same throne as that of O siris, from beneath which the water of life wells up, with the four genii standi ng before the shrine. These becom e “the four living creatures full of eyes,” around the throne , in the four corners of the mount . The proba bility is that the four - and - twenty el ders had been obj ectified in the astronom y by four - and - twenty stars, which represented twenty - four divine judge s who appe ar in the Babyl oni an calenda r. These were twenty - four zodi acal stars, twelve to the nor th and twelve to the sout h (Diodor us, II, 30; Sa yce, Hibbe rt Lectures, p. 72) . As characters in the Egyp tian wisdom , the earliest pre - solar pow ers were 702 called the old one s or the elders. As Egyp tian, they are traceable to the two different groups of the twelve described in “Pistis Sophi a” as the s ubj ect of four - and - twenty mysteries. These were the twelve who had their throne s as rulers (or æons ) in the zodi ac and the twelve as spirits with Horus - Khut i, lord of spirits, in the harvest - field or heaven of eternity. The Mount is inde ed the place of co ngr egation, not onl y for the spirits of the just made perfect, but also as the final gathering - place for all the principal persona ges in the Pantheon of the Kamite mythog raphy. The old great mother and her seven sons are there; the seven great spirits or t he glorious one s, the Khus with Horus - Khut i; the four who kept the qua rters as Egypt ian gods or pow ers ages before they were christened “ange ls”; the twelve as rulers in the zodi ac; the dragon, the wom an with child, and others, which are identifiably Egyp t ian, are all include d in the astronom ical imagery of the Celestial Mount . The seven Halls, Arits or watch - tow ers assigne d to the seven spirits in the Great Hous e of Osiris, are utilised as the seven chur ches which are assigne d to the seven ange ls in the Bo ok of Revelation. The seat of justice in the solar mythos was shifted to the poi nt of equi nox, and the balance was erected on the later mount of glory in the zodi ac. This is the mount ain of Amenta in the eschatology. It is described in the Ritual (ch. 149 ) as the exceeding high mount ain of the nether - world, the top of which touc hes the sky. Whether stellar of solar, this was the mount as judgm ent - seat. “And I saw a great white throne , and him that sat upon it. And I saw the dead were judg ed out of the thing s which were written in the books , every man according to their works” (Rev. XX. 11 - 14) . In the Ritual, it is said, the gods “fashion anew the heart of a person (in spirit) according to what he hath done ,” i.e., according to his works, in the body (ch. 27 and 75). There is also a call to judgm ent in the Ritual (ch. 136 B ). “Com e! com e! for the Father is uttering the judgm ent of Maat,” says the speaker, who is Horus in the Osirian myth and Iu in the cult of Atum - Ra."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" There is a description of the books being brought into the judgm ent - hall upon the Mount . “Oh, thou who callest out at thine evening hour s, grant that I may com e and bring to him (the Father) the two jaws of Rusta, and that I may bring to him the book s which are in the celestial Annu , and add up fo r him his hosts.” Bringi ng away the jaws of Rusta is equi valent to carrying off “the broke n bonds of Death and of Hades” by him who was dead and is alive for evermore (Rev. I. 18) . He who has conque red death and hell and carried away the gates of the priso n - hous e has also vanqui shed the evil dragon. He exclaims, “I have repul sed Apap and healed the wounds he made.” There was a great Egypt ian library at On or Annu, the Greek Heliopo lis. Hence in heaven itself, or the Celestial City, the books of Taht were ke pt in Annu. Thus , speaking of the judgm ent, the Osiris says: “Grant that I may bring to him, the Judge, the books which are in Annu, and add up for him his heavenly hos ts.” The deceased says: “I am com e to thee, O my Lord, that I may look upon thy glory. I know thee, and I know the names of the forty - two gods who make their appe aranc e with thee in the hall of right eous ness.” But in the papyr i 703 of Ani and of Unne fer, the judge s or assessors in the Maat appe ar as Twelve in number sitting on twelve throne s instead of the forty - two, or the twenty - four , which offers a prototype for twelve judge s on the twelve throne s in Revelation and in the canoni cal gos pels. In one of the pictures to the Ritual Horus stands upon the Mount in presence of his father as the c alf, which was a type of sacrifice in the Osirian religion earlier than the lamb (Naville, Todt , Kap. 108) . “I com e,” says the speaker, “so that I may see the process of Maat, and the lion - forms.” These are the Kherefu= Cherubs (ch. 136 B ) statione d at the s eat of judgm ent on the Mount . “Let the fathers and their apes (the spirits of fire) make way for me, that I may enter the Mount of Glory and pass through where the great one s are.” “Here is the cycle of the gods .” “I poi se for him,” the Judge , “the balance , which is Maat.” “Com e! com e! for the Father is uttering the judgm ent of Maat.” This was the final judgm ent on the Mount , where the spirits of the just were passed as perfected. The invi tation to “Com e, com e,” and hear the judgm ents delivered on the day o f doom , is equi valent to the words in Revelation, “Com e up hither, and I will show thee the things which must com e to pass hereafter. Straight way I was in the Spirit: and behol d, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne .” “And I sa w in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close - sealed with seven seals” (Rev. IV. 1, and V. 1). It is said in the Ritual (ch. 133) , “R ā maketh his appe arance at the Mount of Glory with the cycle of his gods a bout him. The strong one issueth from his hidde n dw elling. ” “Be thou lift up, O R ā , who art in thy shrine, on the day when thou discernest the land of Maat”; that is, where the hall of judg ment stands upon the Mount of Glory. The ancient of days in the Sem itic version is Ra, the solar god , who typi fies the eternal in the Ritual. He is called “the aged one at the conf ines of the Mount of Glory” (ch. 131 ). He is the aged one upon his throne , as in the books of Enoc h, Daniel, and John the Divine. The ancient o f days toge ther with the Son of Man preparing for the judgm ent is described by Enoc h. “At that time I beheld the ancient of days, while he sat upon the throne of his glory, while the book of the living was ope ned in his presence, and while all the pow ers w hich were above the heavens stood around and before him” (ch. 47, 3).

This is the Son of Man to whom Right eous ness (or Maati) belongs . It is said of thi s great judgm ent in the Ritual, “The glorious one s are right ly judge d, and the evil dead are parted off” (ch. 18) . In the mysteries of the Ritual, “He that sitteth upon the throne ,” as the great judge in Amenta is Osiris, with Horus as the belove d onl y - beg otten Son. But in the earlier cult at Annu , Atum - Ra was the judge , as God the Father, with Iu - em - hetep as God the Son, that is, as Iu the Su= Jesus the ever - com ing Son. At the ope ning of the book for the Judgm ent Day in Revelation we read, “I saw a strong a nge l proclaiming with a great voice, ‘Who is worthy to ope n the book, and to close the seals thereof?’” “And one of the elders said unt o me, ‘Behol d, the lion that is of the tribe of Juda h, the root of David, hath ove rcom e to ope n the book and the seven se als thereof’” (Rev. V. 2, 5). This was the 704 book cont aining “the things which the seven thund ers uttered” (Rev. X. 4). The book therefore of Seven Great Mysteries. Now , among the other writings ascribed to Taht there was a book of the seven mysteries of Amenta, or of the seven festivals with which the seven mysteries were celebrated. (1) The day of the Mont hly festival of the sixth - seventh; (2) The festival of the fifteenth; (3) The festival of Uaka; (4) The festival of Taht; (5) The festival of the bi rth of Osiris; (6) The festival of Amsu; and (7) The festival of “Com e thou hither.” Thus there were seven great mysteries correspondi ng to the seven festivals for which the record was written. It is a book by which is revealed all that has happe ned from t he beginni ng, cons eque ntly it was a book of Revelation that was written by Aan, the divine scribe. By means of this book the Manes for whom it was written can enter what John calls “the spirit” by becom ing a Spirit, so that the gods are able to com e near h im and touc h him, “for he has becom e as one of them.” It is this book of Revelation conc erning the seven mysteries and their celebration of which Aan is speaking when he declares it is to be copi ed in its entireness and is not to be adde d to by com mentarie s. This we cannot but associate with the book of the Seven Great Mysteries that is sealed with seven seals in Revelation. The book that was sealed with seven seals is a record of all time, or of the seven ages in the cycle of precession, that was kept by T aht the measurer, reckone r and divine recorder; the god who “rescued the Atu from his backw ard cour se,” and who “repeated the ancient ordinances and words for the gui dance of pos terity” as teller of time by means of the moon (Rit., ch. 128 ). Seven stars i n a group were witnesses to the pow er that was permanent at the pol e, the pow er of stability, of equi librium , and of the scales of justice which they served as “the seven arms of the balance” on the day of judgm ent. But there are “two witnesses” particular ly specialised in Revelation. These are said to be “the two olive - trees and the two lampstands standi ng before the Lord of the earth” (XI. 4). These two witnesses are to be met with in the Egypt ian judgm ent scenes. In the second tale of Khamuas, a scene of the Osirian judgm ent is por trayed. The seven halls or mansions of Osiris and the lords of eternity are here described as the seven “arits” or watch - tow ers, the same as in the Ritual (ch. 144 ). The seven are represented as a series, the seventh being the l ast. It is said that, “They entered the seventh Hall, and behol d! Setme saw the figur e of Osiris the great god seated upon his throne of fine gol d, and crow ned with his atef - crow n”; “Anup the great god being on his left, and the great god Taht on his right , with the gods of the counc il"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"standi ng in their places: standi ng and making proclam ation. ” The Balance was set in the midst before them, and they were weighi ng the evil deeds against the good deeds, the great god Taht (Aan) recording, with Anup giving the word to his colleague (Griffith, Second Tale of Kham uas , pp. 46, 48) . These are the prototypa l “two witnesses” stellar and luna r for the Father and son in the solar mythos. Taht - Aan was the witness for Horus, the onl y - begot ten son of the father. In the my thos , which preceded the eschatology, Taht - Aan was the light of the world as the god whos e luminary was the moon . Read doc trinally, he was not the true light , but he came that he 705 might bear witness to the true light . The luna r god was one of the pow e rs in nature that was bor n of the motherhood; whereas Horus, of the resurrection, was begot ten by the father, and Taht bor e witness that Horus, not Aan, was the true light of the world, and the one direct representative of the father - god , who was Ra the ho ly spirit in the eschatology. Horus (or Iu) is the Word that was with God the Father in the beginni ng. He is the onl y Son who issued from the Father; the Son who conv erses with the Father; the Son who was instructed of the Father to reflect and reveal the nature of the God in Spirit as the One Eternal Pow er. Anup may be traced in Amenta as the witness for Horus the child, who was the Word; Aan is the witness for Horus the adul t who is the word made truth. Hence, he is the giver of the talismanic makhe ru; al so the divine scribe who avouc hes the truth of the Word in the writings . These, as Egypt ian, are the “two witnesses” who were present in the hall of judgm ent. In the astronom ical mythol ogy the earth was the coffin of Osiris; the coffin of Amenta which Sut , the pow er of darkne ss, closed upon his brother when he betrayed him to his death. Then the four “living creatures” or “four glorified one s” who rose again with Horus from the dead were statione d at the four corners of the coffin of the earth, in which Os iris as the elemental god was bur ied. In the Egyptian drawings , the earth is represented by the lotus or papyr us - plant on which the four attenda nt spirits stand. This is equi valent to the four corners on which a new heaven had been based in the creation of Atum - Ra. These were four of the primordial pow ers which had been the brothers of Horus in the earlier mythos who are now called his children, when Horus is said to have “com e to light in his ow n children.” This is in the resurrection as it was rende red in the Osirian eschatology (Rit., ch. 112 ). Thus , when Horus rose again upon the mount of resurrection in Amenta he was accom panied by the spirits of the four corners with whom his fold was founde d (Rit., ch. 97). The scene of the mystery on the mount is rep roduc ed in the Gospels. According to Matthew, when Jesus “ope ned his mout h” to deliver the Sermon on the Mount , onl y four of the disciples accom panied him. These were Simon - Peter, Andr ew, and the two brothers John and James (IV, V and X). The Kamite four a re also reproduc ed in Revelation as the four living creatures. “The first creature like a lion, the second creature like a calf, and the third had the face of a man, and the fourth creature like a flying eagle” (IV, VII). As Egypt ian, they are also four gr eat spirits at the four corners of the mount ; and in Revelation they are the “four ange ls standi ng at the four corners of the earth, hol ding the four winds of the earth” (VII. 1). Also, their names unde r each form of the four are the same. In their primary form they are the “four living creatures” with the eyes, which, as Egypt ian, are ape - headed, jackal - headed, bird - headed"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"and hum an - headed. In a seconda ry pha se they were given the hum an figur e; and bot h forms of the four are repeated in the Revelation of J ohn. According to Revelation, the four living creatures are full of eyes, round about and within, and they have no rest day and night , as they were movi ng round for ever with the sphe re. Being astronom ical figur es, the eyes of these were stars. And in the Ritual, the four are eyes or stars to the four qua rters. The vigne ttes to ch. 148 show them as the 706 four eyes, or gui ding - stars, one to each qua rter: north, sout h, east and west. When the heptanom is, or heaven in seven divisions , passed away, as rend ered in the mysteries of the astronom ical mythol ogy , the seven ruling pow ers were fabled to have fallen, as described by Enoc h in his book of the heavens. But in anot her representation the pow ers of the seven were uni fied in one great sove reign pow er. This was assigne d to Horus, the primordial solar god who was bor n of the Old Mother as one of the seven that were uni fied in him, and re - bor n as Horus of the resurrection. Horus, in his earliest image, was the crocodi le - headed Sebek, as the fish of the inunda t ion, and the crocodi le was the Kamite prototype of the solar dragon . The seven pow ers were various ly por trayed as seven stars, seven eyes, seven spirits, seven islands or mount ains on which the “wom an” sat; seven uræus - deities, seven fins of a fish. Accord ing to the ancient wisdom , or the gnos is, says the writer, the seven heads of the beast on which the wom an sitteth are seven mount ains, and they are also seven kings , elsewhere called the kings of the earth, the kings who com mitted fornication with the wom an, and were made drunke n with her wine. “I will tell thee the mystery of the wom an and of the beast that carried her, which hath the seven heads and the ten hor ns. The beast that thou sawest was, and is not , and is about to com e up out of the abys s, and g o into perdition. And they that dw ell on the earth shall wonde r, when they behol d the beast, how that he was, and is not , and shall com e!” The seven heads of the beast “are seven kings ,” that were rulers in the celestial heptanom is. “Five of these are fall en, the one is, the other is not yet com e. And when he com eth he must cont inue a little while.” There woul d have been no dragon with seven heads but for Sebek the crocodi le - headed deity, whom we look upon as the oldest type of the solar Horus in the Egypt ian mythol ogy. The seven pow ers bor n of the Old Mother as the spirits of earth or gods of the elements, here called the kings of earth, were com pounde d into one great pow er as the sun - god Horus who preceded Ra. This was the crocodi le - headed Sebek in relati on to the ancient Mother, and thus the crocodi le became the solar dragon, upon which the wom an rode ; the seven pow ers being at the same time seven kings and also seven mount ains “on which the wom an sitteth,” each type being a representative of the celestia l pol e. The godde ss Apt, who is the female dragon , inasmuch as the crocodi le was one of her zoot ype s, is called “the great mother of him who is married to his mother,” that is, to Sebek - Horus, the crocodi le or dragon as male. He, as child of the Great Moth er, was made her cons ort in the mythos of the mother and child. He became the hus band of the mother as the divinised adul t, and seven pow ers are equa l to the seven heads of the male dragon or crocodi le. By the bye , there is an Egypt ian talisman or fetish i n the Berlin Museum com pos ed of a sevenfold figur e of the crocodi le. The crocodi le was an image of the god Sebek, being the prototypa l dragon; and seven crocodi les are equi valent to the"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"beast with seven heads, on which the wom an rode , in the Book of Revela tion, as the great harlot of primitive prom iscuous intercour se (Erman’s Egypt, p. 149) . During the change s that occurred in heaven, the seven - 707 headed beast on which the wom an rode is represented as losing one of its seven heads. Thus , the change of t ype from an image of the beast to that of the hum an figure which occurred when the crocodi le - head of Sebek was replaced or adde d to by the head of the hum an Horus is plainly indi cated. It was given to the second beast, or to the first beast in a second cha racter, that an image shoul d be made to the beast who had the stroke of the sword, and lived. “And it was given unt o him to give breath to it, even to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast shoul d bot h speak and cause that as many as shoul d no t worship the beast shoul d be killed.” Naturally, the image that coul d speak was of the hum an type, as is Horus An - ar - ef when por trayed as the seventh of the group who were represented in the image of the beast before the human figur e was adopt ed for “the first beast whos e death - stroke was healed.” Thus the beast that came up out of the waters, called the sea, as a crocodi le, or dragon, having ten hor ns and seven heads, and upon his hor ns ten diadems, was smitten unt o death, as it seemed, in one of its head s: “And I saw one of its heads, as though it had been smitten unt o death; and his death - stroke was healed; and there was given to him a mout h speaking great things ” (XIII. 5). The beast that came up out of the sea is the solar dragon und er two different ty pes, but in bot h characters it is the dragon or crocodi le. In the first, it has seven heads and ten horns, and is like unt o a leopa rd, and his feet are as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion. In the second shape he had two horns like u nto a lamb, but he spake as a dragon (XIII. 11). This was Sebek, who, unde r one type , was the crocodi le, and unde r the other, a lamb. The dragons are som ewhat mixed in Revelation. There are five altoge ther: (1) the Apap - dragon (XII. 9); (2) the dragon that gave power and dom inion to the beast (XIII. 2); (3) the dragon on which the wom an rode ; (4) the lamb that spake as a dragon; (5) the dragon cons tellated in Draconi s as a uranogr aphi c sign in heaven. There was at first no hum an type in the septenary of pow ers. They were figur ed as seven serpents, seven hawks, seven apes, seven crocodi les, or other forms of the typical seven, but with no hum an head amongs t them; when there was as yet no Horus as the hum an child, or Atum as the divine man, all seven had been imaged by zoot ype s. But in the later mythos the hum an type was introduc ed, as that of Horus, the child of the Virgin Mother. The seven - headed beast then lost one of its pre - hum an heads. Sebek - Horus, the crocodi le or dragon - headed, was change d into the hum a n Horus. As crocodi le, he was the child of Apt. As Har - si Hesi, he became the child of Isis in a hum an gui se. Thenceforth the hum an type was one amongs t the seven, and the beast, qua beast, lost one of its original heads, which, as Egypt ian, was seen to be replaced by the hum an type when the wound was healed. The acclaiming of Horus or Jesus above the seven previous pow ers is a subj ect of the first chapter in Revelation. He is exalted as “the first - bor n of the dead.” This is “the faithful One,” who is the True Witness for the Father in Heaven as Horus or Iu in his resurrection. The other seven did but represent a soul in matter. The soul that rose up from the dead was an immortal spirit, and as an eight h one it was adde d to the seven. This was as the sun th at rose again from the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 708 unde rworld in the mythol ogy , and as the Divine Endur ing Spirit in the eschatology. In one cult, it was the crocodi le - headed Sebek - Horus who is the seven - headed dragon in Revelation. As it is stated clearly enough, “the beast th at was and is not , is himself also an eight h, and is one of the seven” (Rev. XVII. 11). This, as Egyp tian, became “the ruler of the kings of the earth,” as did Horus in his resurrection from the dead at his second com ing, which was from the Father in Heave n. Time was when the eight h one was the highe st pow er. Sut - Anup was the highe st as an eighth one to the seven great spirits in the stellar mythos . Taht – follow ing Sut – was an eight h one to the seven in the luna r mythos . Lastly, Horus was the highe st in the s olar mythos as the lord of resurrections , and as eight h one to the seven, he whos e sym bol was the eight - rayed star of the Egypt o - gnos tic Plerom a, which was first made historical when it was called the star of Bethlehem. As the Egypt o - gnos tics said, “Seven pow ers glorify the Word.” These pow ers were the cont ribut ions of the seven spirits which out of gratitude to the Propa tor had cont ribut ed whatsoever each one had attained in himself of the greatest beauty and precious ness; they skilfully blende d the whol e in produc ing a most perfect being, and the very star of the Plerom a (namely, the gnos tic Jesus, the Christ, the Saviour , Logos — everything ), because he was formed from the cont ribut ions of all the powers that preceded him who was the Horus or Jesus of the R esurrection, the out com e and first fruit of all (Iren., Bk. I, ch. 2, 6). The faithful and true witness, as Egypt ian, is Horus - Maat - Kheru, the word made truth; he who made the word truth by his resurrection, in the likeness of the Living God. The first Ho rus, or Horus in his first adve nt, was the Word; and the prom ise made by him as founde r was fulfilled by Horus at his second coming as the “faithful witness,” the first - bor n from the dead. In Revelation, this “faithful and true witness” is called “the begi nni ng of the creation of God” (III. 14) . That is as a creation of the god in spirit, who, as Atum - Ra at Annu, was the Holy Spirit. Har - Ur, the elder Horus, was the child of the virgin godde ss; Horus in spirit was “the beginni ng of the creation of God, ” the lord of resurrections who had wrested “the keys of death and hades” from the grasp of their grim keepers for the deliverance of the Manes from Amenta (Rit., ch. 64) . The scales or balance was erected in the Maat or Hall of Twofold Justice for the weighi ng of hearts and also of words, and in Revelation one of the four living creatures is por trayed with the scales in his hand. “I saw, and behol d, a black horse, and he that sat thereon had a balance in his hand” (VI. 5). The balance, as Egypt ian, was the scal es of justice. In Revelation, the scales are turned to com mercial account for the weighi ng out of grain by the pennyw orth. “And I saw the heaven ope ned, and behol d, a white hor se, and he that sat thereon called Faithful and True; and in right eous ness he do th judge and make war. And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems; and he hath a name written, which no one know eth but he himself. And he is arrayed in a garment sprinkl ed with blood; and his name is called the Word of God. And t he armies which are in heaven follow ed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and pur e. And out of his mout h proceedeth a sharp sword, that 709"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" with it he shoul d smite the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he treadeth a winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of Almight y God. And he hath on his garment and on his thigh a name written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords” (XIX. 11, 16) . The sign - langua ge of Egypt will tell us why the name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lor ds was written on his Thigh. The thigh or khepsh was a type of pow er. In one shape it is called the Ur - heka, or great magical pow er, which was feminine at first. It is a thigh - shaped instrum ent made use of to ope n the mout h of the dead in the resurrection (Rit., ch. 23) . At the time of his re - arising the Osiris exclaims: “Let me seize the khe psh which is unde r the place of Osiris, with which I may ope n the mout h of the gods ” (ch. 69). In anot her rôle Horus is the divine hus bandm an, the sow er and the reaper, as the pow er of germination; of harvest and of vintage. In this character he is know n as the god Amsu, who is por trayed in the hum an form like him who is described in Revelation as the Son of man. “I saw, and behol d, a white cloud, and on the cloud one si tting like unt o the Son of man, and wearing on his head a gol den crow n, and in his hands a shar p sickle, and anot her ange l came out from the temple crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, ‘Send forth thy sickle and reap, for the hour to rea p is com e, for the harvest of the earth is ove r ripe.’ And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reapt. And anot her ange l came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle,” and it was said to him , “Send forth thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe” (XIV. 19). Horus usually carries the fan or flail as hus bandm an, but he is also the reaper and the vintager; hence the fig - leaf was his emblem. Horus the reaper in Amenta has twelve follow ers in two groups of seven and five. These are the reapers in the Aarru - fields, where the corn grow s seven cubi ts high and the harvest is reapt for eternity. The twelve are called the “blessed,” who reap with Hor us for his father Ra, and therefore are the blessed of his father. The harvest - field is in the earth of eternity, where Horus appe ars in hum an form with the fan in his hand as the master of joy and lord of the twelve, who are likewise por trayed in human fo rm as the Manes. In the gos pels Jesus is depicted in this character of the reaper. As such he com es like Horus with the fan in his hand that show s him to be the thresher and winnow er of the corn. As lord of the harvest - field he calls to him the twelve and cons titutes them reapers of the harvest on earth which was reapt in Amenta, the other earth, by Horus and the twelve. It is made doubl y certain by the cont ext that the twelve in the gos pels were astronom ical characters. Their names were written in heaven l ike thos e of the twelve gods , the twelve kings , or the twelve apos tles that are coeval with the foundi ng of the zodi ac. The twelve in the gos pels were follow ed by the seventy and the seventy - two ( cf. the two versions ), which represent the two different div isions of the planisphe re into its ancient seventy, and later seventy - two parts that were assigne d to thos e whos e names were written in heaven and had been read there for ages on ages of time by the astronom ers and the men who kne w. So ancient was the matt er as mythical representation in the Egypt ian 710 wisdom that the reaper of the harvest in Amenta, who has twelve follow ers there, had been set aloft in the planisphe re as Horus the reaper in the fields of food , who is extant"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"to - day as the hus bandm an and reaper on the stellar map; but as Boöt es, and not as the “historic” reaper of the harvest. Horus appe ars in the various characters of Har - Tema, the revealer of justice; Har - Makhe ru, the word made truth; Har, the red god who orders the block of execution. These are pha ses of Har - Makhu, the god of bot h hor izons , all of which are reproduc ed in Revelation. Michael, the warrior ange l who ove rthrow s “the dragon and his ange ls,” is the Hebrew form of Har - Makhu, who is Atum - Huhi in the person of his ow n son. This is Har - Tema, he who makes justice visible, in the cult of Osiris. He is the avenge r of the wrongs inflicted on his father by the Apap - dragon and his dark hos t of the Sebau or fiends by the evil Sut, and also by the criminals who on account of their ow n de eds are self - conde mned to die the second death upon “the highw ay of the damned” (Rit., ch. 18). The mythol ogy of Egypt has preserved the prototypal unc orrupt ed version of what has been termed the “awful tradition of a war in heaven.” This was made out mag nificently at last in Milton’ s epic poe m, but the original war in heaven was simply elemental and had no more awfulness or terror in it than a thunde rstorm. We can trace this warfare of the elements from the beginni ng in chaos; the terrors were evoke d from the mind of man. A battle was fought each four - and - twenty hour s betwixt Har - Makhu, the sun - god of bot h horizons , and the dragon of darkne ss, who is hur led dow n from the hor izon of the east into the pit with all his ange ls or fiends called the Sebau or Sam i. This great battle, fought in the Ritual dur ing the last hours of the night , becom es a typi cal last great battle in a cont ention that is fough t out on the scale of the great year in the Book of Revelation called “the war of the great day of God the Almig hty,” when “the kings of the whol e world,” or the seven kings who ruled in the celestial heptanom is, are to be “gathered toge ther into the place which is called in Hebrew Har - Magedon” (XVI. 14, 16). Now it is feasible to infer that the name of this battle - ground was derived from that of Har - Makhu as the place where the Makha , or scales of justice, was erected for the judgm ent on the night of the great battle when the Sebau were defeated and the day when the adve rsaries of the good being were finally anni hil ated. This was at the poi nt of equi nox (Rit., ch. 18) . The battle of Har - Magedon is preceded by the pou ring out of the seventh bow l and the sound of the great voi ce from the throne that said: “It is done !” “And every island fled away, and the mount ains wer e no longe r found ,” for this was the end of the heptanom is and the subs titution of the heaven in twelve divisions , which was the heaven of Atum - Ra or Atum - Iu, who says: “I am he who closeth and he who ope neth, and I am but one . I am Ra at his first appe ara nce. I am the great god self - produc ed,” and who became the Hebrew deity Ihuh (Rit., ch. 17, Renouf ). The war in heaven, or in external nature, was first. Next it was made astronom ical. Lastly, it was eschatologi cal or theologi cal, as in Milton’s version of the Paradi se Lost. In the Ritual the evil Apap is bound in chains each morning. “Chains are flung upon thee 711 by the scorpion godde ss, and slaught er is dealt out to thee by Maati. Apap is fallen and is in bonds ” (ch. 39) . The same drama was represente d yearly in relation to the annua l sun and the autum n gathering of All Soul s. In Revelation the drama represents a larger period of time. A thous and years intervene betwixt the first and second resurrection. “I saw throne s, and they that sat upon them, and judgm ent was given unt o them.” Thos e who"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"rise again are said to “reign with Christ a thous and years,” or with Horus in the hous e of a thous and years, and the rest of the dead lived not until the thous and years shoul d be finished. This is the first resurre ction. Then follow s the last judgm ent, the second death, and the new Jerusalem bui lt for the children of Israel, whos e throne s are twelve in num ber as founda tions of the final heaven. We read in Revelation that the great dragon is that “old serpent” who i s called the devil and Satan (XII. 9). And again, it is said: “I saw an ange l com ing dow n out of heaven, having the key of the abys s and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hol d on the dragon, the old serpent which is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thous and years, and cast him into the abys s, and shut it and sealed it ove r him” (XX. 2, 3). These are the two type s of the Egypt ian devil. The Apap - reptile was that old serpent, the devil in pre - anthropom orphi c gui se. Sut was the anthropom orphic Sat an or evil adve rsary in the later theology. Also the dragon and Sut are treated as if identical in the Ritual (ch. 108) . In the chapter of chaining the evil one , this is the Apap in one aspect and Sut in the other. It is said: “Then Sut is made to flee wit h a chain of steel upon him. Then Sut is put into his prison. ” The evil one is said to be “pierced with hooks , as was decreed against him of old.” Horus makes war upon the pow ers of evil on account of what they have done against his father Osiris in Amenta . But especially on Sut the pow er of drought and darkne ss now represented as the adve rsary Satan in an anthropom orphi c shape, which brings us to the latest stage of the war in heaven, earth, and Amenta. “Horus says to these gods , ‘Strike the enemies of my father, puni sh them in you r pits (in the bot tom of hell) for the evil they have done to the great one , my father. Your particular dut ies in Amenta are to keep the pits of fire in accordance with Ra’s com mand, which I make know n to you. ’” To the conde mned, he says: “You are boun d for ever, you are tied by strong cords. I have ordered your detention. My father prevails against you, your curses are judge d against you before Ra. Your cont empt for justice com es back to you. Bad for you is the judgm ent of my fath er. O Ra! praise be to Ra! thy enemies are in the place of destruction! ” ( Book of Hade s, Second Division, Legends .) The battle of Har - Magedon was not a mortal conf lict to be fought at som e far - off inde finite future time. It had been fought already in the Ritual, and was periodi cally repeated in the mysteries as the final struggl e betwixt light and darkne ss, or the solar god and apap - reptile. The great battle depicted in the Ritual is fought by Har - Makhu (Gr. Har - Machis) and the evil dragon . Har - Makhu was t he solar god of the doubl e hor izon or equi nox, and the night ly battle was ende d on the horizon east. In the Ritual the dragon of darkne ss is show n at night and morn in relation to the doubl e hor izon on two 712 sides of the mount . At the close of day, whe n the sun - god sinks into the water of the west as Ra or Horus, he is conf ronted by his natural enemy, the evil serpent Apap, the destroye r or devou rer that rises up gigantic from the bot tom less abys s. Daylight is described as com ing to a stand (Hâu) like a tidal wave at the poi se. With suns et the Apap “turneth dow n his eyes to Ra; for there com eth a standi ng still in the bark and a deep slum ber within the ship. And now he (the dragon) swallow eth seven cubi ts (in som e texts three) of the great water” (Rit., ch. 108) . This is the mons ter that drank up all the water in the world, whether as dragon, toad, snake or other reptile, here caught , as Kamite, in the"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"act, and the water that it drinks is daylight ; the great water flow ing round the mount of earth by day. The war of light and darkne ss goe s on through the night dow n in Amenta, the lurking - place of the dragon who seeks to destroy the tree of life at its root s, but is for ever foiled by the god who represents the noc turnal sun in the shape of a great cat, as s eer in the dark, and protector of the persea or ash, which is the Kamite Tree of Life by name. All night the war goe s on betwixt the solar god and his old adve rsary. At dawn the hos t of darkne ss is repul sed and beaten for anot her day. The last great ove rwh elming wrecking, ruining charge is described in the Ritual (ch. 38) . It is the prototype of the war in heaven described in Revelation, when Michael and his angels went “forth to war with the dragon; and the dragon warred, and his ange ls; and they prevailed not . And the great dragon was cast dow n, the old serpent, he that is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whol e world. He was cast dow n to the earth” (Rev. XII. 7, 9), which in the Ritual is the Nether Earth of Amenta. “The stormy voi ce of bell ow ings ” is heard from the dyi ng mons ter, and Ra the conque ror stagge rs forth upon the horizon, fainting with his many bleeding wounds . But Apap has fallen, and the song of triumph is raised, “Apap is fallen! fallen! fallen!” Apap, the enemy of Ra, goe th do wn to be cut up piecemeal and drow ned in the lake of heaven. The “gods who are on the roads” overthrow him. There are ten groups of the Tata - gods of a heaven in ten divisions (Rit., ch. 18) . The gods of the four qua rters bind him. The avengi ng godde sses fa ll on him furious ly. Chains are flung upon him by Isis - Serkh. Death is dealt out to him by Maftit, the lynx - godde ss. Ra is satisfied; he makes his progr ess peacefully. The mons ter has relinqui shed his hol d on the Tree of Life and also disgor ged the waters of light , and the solar bark is onc e more sailing joyf ully across the heaven of day. The Apap - dragon with the chains upon him is to be seen in pictures to the Ritual, also on the sarcopha gus of Seti (Bonom i, pls. 10 and 11). In pl. 11 the scorpion - godde ss Serkh is put ting the chain upon the Apap - reptile in presence of the executione rs, who include the four children of Horus. The ange l who com es dow n out of heaven, having the key of the abys s and a great chain in his hand, who lays hol d of the dragon and bin ds him for a thous and years (Rev. XX. 1, 2, 3) is “Akar” in the Ritual, the chief of the gate of the abys s, who has ove rthrow n and bound the dragon of the deep, so that Ra can navigate in peace. Such was the Egypt ian battle of Har - Magedon as fought by Har - Makhu against his old enemy, the Apap - dragon. 713 We find the breaking loos e from the pit, the recapturing and chaining dow n of the dragon or serpent of evil in the abys s, is described in the magic papyrus as well as in the Ritual. It is Amen - Ra, who is addr essed as the Egyptian Apol lo, piercing the pyt hon of the abys s when he rises in revol t. “Thou dispos est of the Abut - Unti. Nubi shoot s his arrow s against him. Akar springs forward and watches ove r him, and restores him to his prison, devour ing the two huge eyes by which he prevailed. A fierce devour ing flame cons um es him, com mencing from his head and wasting all his members with its fire.” From this text we learn that one Egypt ian name of the huge typhoni an reptile in the abys s is Abut - Unti, from which we may suppos e the name of the Abaddon in Hebrew was derived; Abut or Abtu being a form of the Apap which typi fies non - existence or Unti (Rit., 93) . The beast that was taken and cast alive into the lake of fire that bur neth with brimstone is to be found, l ake and all, in the seventeenth chapter of the Ritual (lines 67 -"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"68) in Baba, the eternal devour er, whos e dw elling is in the lake of fire, the red lake, the pool of the damned, in the fiery pit of the “recess” in Amenta. The banque t of Baba, lord of gor e, w ho extracts the heart and other viscera from the corpses doom ed to be cons um ed at his feast, and who eats the livers of princes, becom es the “great suppe r of God” in Revelation, at which is eaten the flesh of kings and captains, and all kinds of men, great or small (XIX. 17, 18) . It is the same war in the Book of Revelation betwixt the serpent and the seed of the wom an that it was in the Book of Genesis, without having any signi ficance in the fulfilment of suppos ititious prophe cy as hum an history. After th e great dragon the old serpent was cast dow n to the earth; he cont inue d the battle. “The dragon waxed wroth with the wom an (the great mother in a later character) and went away to make war with the rest of her seed” (Rev. XII. 17). The appl ication to the s eed has been extende d, but the wom an and her child remain the same as when she was Isis and he was Horus, and bot h were pur sued by the dragon, or crocodi le, in the marshes of low er Egypt , and the mother made her escape with her infant upon the two wings of the Vulture or the Hawk. This war made by the evil dragon on the Great Mother is reproduc ed directly from the Egypt ian Mythos . When mortal Horus was brough t forth among the reeds or bus hes of the marshes he and his mother were pursued by the Apap - dragon. Isis tells Osiris that a very great crocodi le was follow ing after his son, and that she hid herself among the bus hes for the pur pos e of conc ealing the young child bor n to be a king or to becom e the Roya l Horus, whatsoever the oppos ition. In this text he is said to be bor n for repul sing Tebha , a form of the devour er who seeks to destroy the divine heir, for answering on behalf of his father Osiris. (Budge , “The Book of Overthrow ing Apap,” Proc. Soc . Bib. Archy., 1886 , p. 17). In Revelation a great sign is d escribed in heaven; “a wom an arrayed with the sun and the moon unde r her feet, and upon her head a crow n of twelve stars; and she was with child; and she cried out , travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered. . . . And the dragon stood before the wom an which was about to be delivered, that when she was delivered he might devour her child; and she was delivered of a son, 714 a man - child who is to rule all nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught unt o God and unt o his throne , and the wom an fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God.” (XII). This marks the cour se of developm ent and the change from the Great Mother in the stellar to the bringe r forth of the child in the luna r mythos . As Egypt ian, the first Great Mother A pt was imaged in the likeness of the water - cow , the cow of earth. In her later luna r character as Hathor , she was imaged in the likeness of the milch - cow . And in the vigne tte to the last chapter of the Ritual this Great Mother is por trayed in these two of her forms, as Apt the water - cow and Hathor the milch - cow , in which two forms she receives the Manes in the mount ain of Amenta as the mother in earth and in heaven, the mother in the Great Bear and the mother in the Moon. Hathor has now the uppe r and Apt th e low ermost place of two, as it was when the stellar was succeeded and to som e extent supe rseded by the soli - luna r Mythos . But Apt was never cast out of heaven in the genui ne version as the drama is represented in the Book of Revelation, although the matri archate was supe rseded by the fatherhood of Atum - Ra."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Thus it is demons trated little by little, item by item, that the main subj ect - matter of the Book of Revelation is the drama of the last judgm ent, of which we get great glimpses in the mysteries of Amenta . The judgm ent seat is set upon the highe st hill in heaven called “the mount of the resurrection and the glory” (Rit., ch. 1). The one eternal judge is seated on the throne . He also appe ars in the two characters of God the Father and God the Son; the lion and the lamb; the first and the last; he that was dead and is alive again for evermore. The lords of eternity are round about him on their throne s; the shenni n or officials of the celestial cour t are present as the seven spirits of fire; the two witnesses, who are Taht - Aan and Anup in the Egypt ian judg ment scenes; the keepers of the four corners of the mount ; the old, old one s, or four - and - twenty elders, with various other Kamite prototype s, are all there. The old Great Mother and her seven earth - bor n spiri ts are judge d, rejected and cast out of heaven. Apt, so to say, is now succeeded by Hathor as the Great Mother in the later mythos , and Sebek the dragon by Horus as the lamb of the godde ss. In this new heaven it is Horus, or Jesus, of the resurrection who was raised to the supr emacy as lord ove r all. And in such ways did the Egypt ian wisdom suppl y the original data for the Christian Revelation. The heaven in seven divisions is not the onl y celestial formation that declines and passes away as a mystery in Re velation. When the seventh bow l was pour ed out and the heptanom is came to an end with a might y earthqua ke the celestial city “was divided into three parts,” or, as we read it, into the triangul ar heaven of Sut, Horus, and Shu as gods of the sout h, nor th, a nd equi nox. Also the ten hor ns or pow ers of the solar dragon indi cate a heaven in ten dom ains, ten islands , or ten circles of Ra, in the Ritual, which preceded the ultimate heaven in twelve divisions . This is intimated when “the tenth part of the city fell ” as one of the ten divisions passing away in the cour se of precession. The ancient heaven passed away “as a scroll,” or as the book of the eternal sealed for the great judgm ent with the seven seals. There is a new heaven bui lt on twelve founda tions in pl ace of the earlier seven 715 or ten. “He that sitteth on the throne said, ‘Behol d I make all things new!’” (XXI. 5). This, in the Ritual, is the son of God who is rebor n upon the mount of glory as the lamb, or the child that was the conne cting link with the eternal parent in the sphe re of time. The new heaven in the Book of Revelation is based upon the twelve zodi acal signs for its twelve founda tions . This was as old as the heaven of Atum - Ra, in which the twelve kings row ed the solar bark around the eclip tic thirteen thous and years ago. Follow ing the making of Amenta by Ptah, the creation of a new heaven and earth was ascribed to Atum - Ra, the highe st deity develope d in the Egypt ian theology previous to Osiris Neb - er - ter. Hence the creation, or a creation w as proclaimed to be the work of Atum by the priests of Heliopol is. In the eschatology it is said of the hous e on high, “Tum bui ldeth thy dw elling, the Lion - faced God (Tum or Atum ) layeth the founda tion of thy hous e, as he goe th his round” in fulfilling the solar circle, which was com pleted with the twelve throne s, twelve stars, twelve gates, or twelve founda tions of the final zodi ac. This founda tion, as the imagery show s, was extant at the time when the solar lion - god first rose up in the strengt h of the do ubl e lions , and the mount of the vernal equinox was in the sign of Leo. In Revelation the equi nox has travelled to the sign of Aries, which will account for the lamb"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"upon the mount in place of Horus the calf. In this new rende ring the earth was thought of as the lotus of the nun from which the sun of dawn arose. This is show n by the four keepers of the cardinal poi nts or corners of the earth that stand on the papyr us - plant in the presence of the Lord of all things , who was Atum in the earlier and Osiris in the later cult. These, in Revelation, are “the four living creatures full of eyes” that were “in the midst of and around about the throne .” The throne was now upon the mount of glory in the equi nox, with the four corner keepers “round about the throne ”; th e solar heaven being founde d on the four qua rters previous ly established by Kheper - Ptah. The ope ning day of this new creation in the cult of Atum - Ra, at Annu, was called the day of “com e thou to me,” or “com e thou hither.” It is described in the Ritual (ch . 17) as the day on which their places were fixed by Anup for the seven glorious ones who follow the coffined one in the Osirian mystery of the resurrection, as previous ly set forth. These are the seven great spirits who are represented by the seven never - setting stars in the right hand of him who move s in the midst of the seven gol den lampstands or kha bsu lamps as the Supr eme One, the onl y God - begot ten Son, in whom the seven powers in the mythol ogy were unified to image an eight h one in the eschatology. As the elder Horus and child of the Mother he had been one of the seven, and in Horus of the resurrection he is now the Son of the Father, divinised in spirit as eight h one to the seven. This is the twofold figur e seen upon the mount in Patmos as “the Son of man.” In one pha se, Horus or Iu - em - hetep was the type of an eternal child, the raison d’être of which was in the hum an child being an image of bot h sexes, or, as the Ritual expr esses it, bot h soul s of the god and godde ss in one figur e. As it is said in t he Ritual (ch. 115 ), Horus assum ed the form of a female with the sidelock of childhood. Horus was also por trayed as a male child with feminine mammæ. It is said in the pyr amid texts, “Hail, Unas, the nippl es of the bos om 716 of Horus have been given to t hee, and thou hast taken in thy mout h the breast of thy sister Isis.” This was the mystical divine male - female of the gnos is; the yout h with female paps like Bacchus , or Serapis; Horus with the cteis; Venus with the beard; the Christ as Charis or Jesus as Saint Sophi a (Didron, fig. 50). The Son of man por trayed in Revelation is the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus. The garment worn by him is that “long garment in which rests the whol e world”; the garment that was worn by Iu - em - hetep, in the temple at Annu , as the son o f Atum - Ra. This long garment was the sign of bot h sexes, like the sidelock of the child in Egypt ; and it is worn by a figur e that is bot h male and female as show n by the feminine paps and gol den girdle, and was worn originally on account of the female natu re of the type . This is the very effigy of child - Horus or Iu - em - hetep, the son of Ptah, who was the dua l representative of the biune parent. But in no case coul d such a dua l figure have becom e “historical” or been “made flesh” except in som e hermaphr odi ta l shape of mons trous persona lity, whether in Egypt , Nazareth, or Rom e. It is now propos ed to show that God the Father in Revelation was Atum - Huhi , the Eternal Being in the religion of On, who had becom e the Jewish god Ihuh , and that the Jesus of this book was Iusa, the com ing Son of god and demons trator of eternal life upon the mount of resurrection in the Ritual and in the Book of Revelation. Atum - Huhi (Atum -"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Iu or Atum - Ra) was the onl y deity in all Egyp t who was expr essly worshippe d by the title of the “A nkhu, ” or the ever - living one eternal god . This is he who is reproduc ed by name in Revelation, saying, “I am the first and the last, and the living one ” (Rev. I. 17). In the com ing forth to day from out the dark of death which is the resurrection in the Ri tual, Atum - Iu, the closer and the ope ner of Amenta, carries in his hands the keys that close and ope n the unde rworld. These are the Ankh - key of life, and the Un - sceptre, with which Amenta is closed and ope ned. These are repeated in the Book of Revelation a s the keys of death and hell. The god in spirit was the highe st type of deity attained as the “hol y spirit” in the cult of Atum - Ra. Now , there is a typi cal character in Revelation called “the spirit,” but which is not otherwise identified. “Hear what the s pirit saith: ‘To him that ove rcom eth, to him will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God’ ” (Rev. II. 7). It is this god in spirit who proclaims the blessedne ss of the dead “which die in the Lord” to “rest from their labour s” (XI V. 13) and calls on thos e who are athirst to com e and take of the waters of life freely (XXII. 17). He is also the spirit with the bride, but distingui shed from the lamb. “The spirit and the bride say ‘Com e’” (XXII. 17). As Egypt ian, then, “the spirit” in the eschatology was Atum - Ra the hol y spirit, in the cult of Annu; Ius ā as, a form of Hathor , was the bride, and Iu - em - hetep, he who com es with peace, was their son, whom we identify as the Egyptian Jesus in the Book of Revelation, in Pistis Sophi a, in the A poc rypha , and in the Book of Taht - Aan. The “entire god” was a mystical title of Amen - Ra as the child and hus band of the mother. According to the gnos is, there was a triune being, distinct from the male trinity, cons isting of the mother, child, and adul t m ale, in one person. The figure - head of this triad might be either the mother, the father, or the child, according to the 717 cult; and whereas the know ers worshippe d the “entire god” who was three in one , one sect woul d exalt the mother; on the other han d, the Jews became monot heists by eliminating bot h the mother and the son from the godhe ad, and setting up the father by himself alone as the “entire god, ” the Kamite Neb - er - ter. Irenæ us cachinna tes in a gha stly fashion at the gnos tics who assigne d but one cons ort to bot h the father and son. But, it is the same with the spirit (father) and the lamb (son) in conne ction with the bride in Revelation, as it was in Egypt and as it still remains in Rom e. Fortuna tely, the mystical bride had two characters not to b e easily taken away by the Bishop of Lyons . She was the virgin in one , the gestator in the other. As virgin she was the bride of Horus, the lamb of god. As gestator she was the cons ort of the lion - faced man or man - faced lion who was Atum as god the father. According to the Kabalists these two were the macrocosm and microcosm. The two figur es are said to com prehend three persons — namely, the father, the son, and the mother, who was the bride of bot h. The lesser man or microcosm was a figur e of doubl e sex, the feminine half being conj oined to his back as the hinde r female part. This is equi valent to the Horus of bot h sexes, and to Jesus as Saint Sophi a. This was he whom the gnos tics called Pan and Totum, the all - one , who became the manifestor as the ever - com ing son. This all - one ness of the son is described in the Ritual and proclaimed by Atum the father, when it is said that “Horus is the father! Horus is the mother! Horus is the brother! Horus is the kinsman! Horus is seated upon the throne , and all that lives is subj ect to him. All the gods are in his service. So saith Atum, the sole"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"force of the gods , whos e word is not to be altered” (Rit., ch. 78) . Horus was now the all - one as manifestor in phys ical and spiritual phe nom ena for all the pow ers which had been su mmed up in Atum as the one god in spirit and in truth. This same triad of the mother, father, and son was know n to the Sethians. With them the father of all is styled the first man= Atum or Adam. “His Ennua , goi ng forth from him, produc ed a son, and this is the son of man — the second man,” or second Adam. “The father and son bot h had intercourse with the wom an, whom they call the mother of the living, ” and the triad cons tituted the “entire god, ” in accordance with the Egypt ian doc trine (Irenæ us, Agai nst Heres ies, Bk. I, ch. 30) . Atum , who was god the father in spirit, had assum ed the sove reignt y of Ra, the creator as god almight y, the one true god, the onl y one , because he was the god in spirit, not merely in phys ical phe nom ena, but in that new heaven which wa s ope ned on the day of “Com e thou to me.” This is the pos ition acknow ledge d by the worshippe rs in the new temple of god (Rev. XI. 17) . “We give thee thanks , O Lord God, the Almight y, which art and which wast, because thou hast taken thy great pow er and did st reign. ” That is he who had assum ed the sove reignt y as sole ruler in the luni - solar heaven that follow ed the passing away of the heptanom is and the heaven in ten divisions . Atum Ra is not onl y to be identified as the closer and ope ner of Amenta; the fir st and the last, and the “living one ”; the spirit with the bride; the god who sat upon the throne was also of a red com plexion. He was like unto “a sardius” to look upon, which is 718 the especial colour of Atum in the vigne ttes to the Ritual. In Revelat ion, when the “throne is set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne ,” there was a rainbow round about the throne like emerald to look upon (IV. 3). Also in the original mythos the throne “like emerald to look upon” was a figur e of the Egypt ian dawn tha t was imaged as a great emerald sycamore tree, a lake of emerald, green fields, and other evergreen things upon the mount of glory. Ra, in the Ritual, is said to be “encircled with emerald light ,” which was the emerald dawn surroundi ng him on the solar mou nt. As it is said, “thy body is of gol d, thy head of azure, and emerald light encircleth thee” (ch. 15) . The gods who are in the green light of dawn are also called “the emerald one s” (Rit., ch. 110) . When Horus at his second com ing rises from the dead it is as the son of God to whom was given the throne of the eternal with power to share the sons hip with his follow ers. He is received with “a cry of ador ation to him in Suten - Khen.” There is exul tation in the place of Horus in his darkne ss, previous ly descr ibed as a world “without water and without air; all abys s, utter darkne ss, sheer bewilderment” (ch. 175 ), as the condi tion of the soul in matter that was imaged by the mortal Horus without sight . “He of the strong cord is bor n (ch. 136) , his cable is com pl eted,” and the ark of earth made fast to heaven onc e more for anot her period in precession, or the shennu - circle of eternity. “Glory is given to the inviolate one ,” “by generations yet unbor n.” “Ra exalteth him.” The gods of the lamps “rise up to greet him with their exclamations of great joy” ; he who com es was in raiment like the dawn as the true light of the world newly kindl ed for the night of death. “He put teth an end to the oppos ition of Sut,” the pow er of darkne ss (ch. 137 B , 2, 3). This, then, is Horu s the son of God in the Osirian cult or Jesus in the religion of Atum - Ra, with God the father in the great judg ment scenes upon the mount . He com es “to witness the process of Maat (or the judgm ent) and the lion - forms which belong to it.”"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"He com es to erect the scales of justice for his father, who is “uttering the judgm ent of Maat.” He now appe ars as Horus trium pha nt who has torn out the jaws of Rusta, conque red the evil Apap, and brought the books which are kept in Annu to his father in the hall of judgm ent called the Maat. Here, says the speaker, “here is the cycle of the gods , and the kite of Osiris,” which represents his son Horus. “Grant ye that his father may judge in his behalf; and so I poi se for him the balance, which is Maat (that of law and justice ) and I raise it that he may live. Com e! com e! for the father is uttering the judgm ent of Maat. O thou who callest out at thine evening hour s, grant that I may com e and bring to him the two jaws of Rusta, and that I may bring to him the books which are in Annu, and add up for him his heavenly hos ts”(ch. 136 B , Renouf ). These are the books of Taht - Aan that were examined on the great day of reckoni ng called the judgm ent day (Rev. IV). In the parallel scene, the father sits, Osiris - like, upon his throne , with t he four - and - twenty elders, the seven great spirits, and the four living creatures round about . A striking picture of the god in his characters of the closer and the ope ner is presented by John in the Book of Revelation. The 719 father - god, he who closes , is seated on the throne. In his right hand he hol ds the book that is closed with seven seals; the book which “no one in the heaven or earth, or unde r the earth” is able to ope n. In his other character, that of the son, represented by the lamb, “he taketh it out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne .” This is the ope ner of the book and the breaker of the seven seals thereof. “And when he had taken the book , the four living creatures and the four - and - twenty elders fell dow n before the lamb,” who a lone has pow er to break the seals and ope n the book. His taking of the seven - sealed book from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne is follow ed by the “addi ng up for him his hos ts.” In this reckoni ng it is declared that the num ber of ange ls round the throne “was ten thous and times ten thous and, and thous ands of thous ands ” (V. 11) . These in the astronom ical mythol ogy woul d signi fy the soul s that had attained eternal setting as the hos ts of heaven, represented by the Akhe mu - Seku or stars which never set. The spirits in glory, called the Khus , are num bered in the Ritual as in Revelation. In the Papyr us of Nebseni, the num ber of the Khus or spirits is reckoned as “four millions , six hund red thous and, and two hund red” (Rit., ch. 64, Papy rus of Nebseni ). It is not said on what grounds the com put ation was made. In Revelation the num ber of the saved and sealed is com put ed at one hundr ed and forty - four thous and. The mysteries of Osiris, Isis, and Horus, though the latest in evol ution, have been given the for emost place in the Ritual and have somewhat obs cured the pre - Osirian mythol ogy. But Atum was the great judge upon the mount of Amenta at a far earlier period than Osiris. And one of the judgm ents in the Ritual is described as that of Atum - Ra. This takes pl ace “when the eye is full on the last day of the mont h Mechir”; on the night wherein the eye is full and fixed for the judg ment (Rit., ch. 71) . “Ra makes his appe arance on the mount of glory with his cycle of gods about him.” “Atum rises pour ing out his de w.” “His majesty gives orders to the cycle of his follow ers.” “They fall dow n before Atum - Harmachis,” or Atum - Horus. “His majesty orders them to praise the eye.” “His glorious eye rests in its place on his majesty in this hour of the night .” At the fourth hour of the night , on the last day of Mechir, “the majesty of the eye is in the presence of"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"the cycle of the gods , and his majesty rises, as in the beginni ng, with the eye upon his head as Atum - Ra.” The Khabsu - gods lift up their lamps by night . When Ra pas ses ove r heaven unt o the west upon his daily round , these gods of the lamp rise up with exclamations of delight to show the way. They are stars upon the sum mit of the mount which are said “to receive the cable of Ra from his row ers.” Twelve row ers row ed th e bark by day around the zodi ac. At night the seven starry pow ers at the pol e took the rope in hand to haul the vessel through the unde rworld. Thus a mystery of the seven stars, as servants of the solar god , was interpreted in the astronom ical mythos befor e the law of gravitation coul d be know n (Rit., ch. 130) . As it is said, “Oh Ra, who smileth cheerfully, as thou com est forth in the east, the ancients, and thos e who are gone before acclaim thee” (ch. 64). These “ancients,” who came from the “primeval wom b ” as earlier pow ers than Ra (ch. 133) , appe ar in Revelation as “the elders.” They are also called “the fathers.” The 720 Osiris in the character of Horus risen on the mount , says “Let the fathers and their apes make way for me, that I may enter the mount of glory, where the great one s are” (ch. 136 B ). Naturally enough , “the apes” do not appe ar as apes in Revelation. But we may discern them in “the seven spirits of fire,” or the seven lamps of fire, bur ning before the throne , which are the seven spirits of God (IV. 5). As Egypt ian, the apes are spirits of fire. In sign - langua ge the hot - natured or fiery - tempered Kaf - Ape was made the image of a spirit of fire. Thus seven apes are equi valent to seven spirits of fire. They coul d “make way” for the Osiris in the mount , as they were keepers of the way and ope ners of the gates of dawn for Ra in his rising. The num bers vary. But there is a picture to the Ritual in which the seven spirits of fire around the throne of Ra are seven ape s around the mount of glory (Navil le, Todt . Kap. , 16 A ). In Revelation, the son of God prom ises to give the morning star to him that ove rcom eth. “As I also have received of my father; I will give him the morning star” (Rev. II. 28). The morning star was equa lly identified with Horus. “I kno w the pow ers of the east: Horus of the mount of glory, the calf in presence of the god , and the star of dawn” (Rit., ch. 109) . The pow ers represented in the vigne tte are Atum - Ra, the father, with Horus (or Jesus) the son, as a calf, the later lamb. This is Horus of the morning star. In the vigne tte to the previous chapter (108) the pow ers are Atum , the father, Horus (as Sebek), the son, and Hathor as the bride (Naville, Todt . Kap., 108, 109) . Here is an appl ication of the imagery to the deceased which is as old as the Pyramids. The morning star was given by Horus to his follow ers who were reborn in Sothis. The rebirth of Pepi was in or as the morning star. And “his gui de the morning star leadeth him to paradise, where he seateth himself upon his throne ” (Bud ge, Book of the Dead, Introd. , pp. 141 , 143) . When Pepi goe th forth into heaven he is led by Septet, the female Sothis, and his gui de is the morning star. She is the bride whom he calls his sister. He seats himself upon his throne of ba - metal. This throne has lions ’ heads, and feet in the form of hoof s called the hoof s of the bul l, Sema - Ur. Thus the lion and the bul l, or bul lock, meet in the throne of Pepi, which is the throne of god upon the mount of glory ( Pyram id Texts, 304 ), and the type s are equi valent to Atum the man - faced lion and Iu the son, as calf, later lamb, toge ther with the bride in Sothis."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" As Egypt ian, then, Atum - Huhi was the God in Spirit, who was ador ed at On, as God the Holy Spirit, with Hathor - Ius ā as, the bride, and Horus as the calf. And in one of the vigne ttes to the Ritual (Naville, Todt . Kap. , 109) these three are groupe d toge ther o n the mount , the same as in the Book of Revelation (Naville, Todt . Kap. , 108 ). About the year 2410 B.C. the vernal equi nox was movi ng out of Taurus into the sign of Aries, and the type of Horus change d from the calf upon the hor izon to the lamb upon the m ount . Horus is called “the Lamb, Son of a Sheep.” As a fact in the astronom ical mythol ogy the lamb was then exalted to the highe st place, and Hathor - Sothis became “the bride, as the wife of the lamb.” In the Book of Esdras we com e very near to the fulfillm ent of a Sothiac cycle. “These toke ns shall com e to pass, and the bride shall appe ar, 721 and she com ing forth shall be seen that now is withdr awn from the earth,” and “my Son Jesus shall be revealed with thos e that be with him, and they that remain shal l rejoice within four hundr ed years. And the world shal l be turned into the old silence seven day s, like as in the former Judgm ent: so that no man shall remain. And after seven day s the world, that yet aw aketh not , shal l be raised up, and that shal l die th at is corrupt . And the earth shal l restore thos e that are asleep in her, and so shal l the dus t thos e that dw ell in silence; and the secret places shal l deliver thos e soul s that were com mitted unt o them. And the Most High shal l appe ar upon the seat of Judgm ent.” In this reckoni ng “my son Jesus” is no more historical or ethni cal than the bride. The bride, who was now withdr awn from the world in fulfilling her period, identifies Sothis and her cycle, which is to be com pleted in four hund red years, when the Com ing One will be rebor n as the Bennu or Phœ nix, the Messu or Messiah, whos e rebirth was reckone d and redated by that cycle. The bride or Shtar, the betrothed, as Egyp tian, was Hathor - Sothis, who was “withdr awn” from the world in com pleting the Sothiac cycle ; and Ius ā as - Neb - hetep, the mother of Iusa, was a form of Hathor in the cult of Atum - Ra. Thus , Atum was the God in Spirit, Hathor - Ius ā as is the bride, and Iusa is the son who was imaged by the calf or lamb according to the time and pos ition on the ecliptic . As Egypt ian, the mystical bride and child were astronom ical. The prophe cy of their return to earth and reappe arance within four hund red years, in the secret wisdom of Esdras, is astronom ical. Cons eque ntly, the fulfilment with the marriage of the bride an d the lamb or Virgin Mother and Child in Revelation was likewise astronom ical, and Jesus was that character in the astronom ical mythol ogy which was and is, and is to com e for ever as the Son who is the manifestor for the Father unde r whatsoever type or nam e, whether as the lamb, calf, the crocodi le, the beetle, the dove , the hawk, the fish, the green corn, the grapes, the shoot of the papyr us - plant, or as Horus in the hum an image of the eternal Child. To all appe arance “John” has reproduc ed the astronom y i n “Revelation” so as to agree with the entrance of the vernal equi nox into the sign of the Ram which occurred about the year 2410 B.C. , when the starry dragon as Draconi s ceased to be the station of the pol e star and so was fabled to have fallen from heave n; and the lamb became the typi cal victim that suffered death and rose again in the sign of the ram at Easter, as Horus in one cult, Sebek in the other, and as Jesus the “Lamb of God” in the Book of John."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" The drama com es to an end with the marriage of the bride and the lamb. This is the same in the astronom ical reckoni ng as shifting the birthpl ace of the child in the circle of precession from the sign of the bull to the sign of the ram, as it actually took place four thous and three hundr ed years ago. The n atural result of this change was that the lamb from that time became the type of Horus instead of the calf. And the great change was marked in Egypt by the crocodi le - headed Sebek being por trayed by the Sebek - heteps with the head of the lamb now adde d to th e form of the dragon ( Book of Beginni ngs , also Nat. Genesis ). The biblical writings abound in phr ases too inde finite for anyt hing 722 but the faith that can suppl y its ow n fulcrum . One of these is the “founda tion of the world.” Can any Christian expl ain this “founda tion of the world”? For them, this had to be historically laid or relaid som e nineteen centuries ago. But, according to the Book of Revelation, the sacrificial lamb was slain from the “founda tion of the world.” In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is made to say, “Com e ye blessed of my Father, inhe rit the kingdom prepared for you from the founda tion of the world” (Matt. XXV. 34) . Here the kingdom of the elect was already prepared and in no wise depende nt upon any slaying of the historic lamb. On the other hand, the lamb (or calf, or other animal) had been slain for ages annua lly, as the type of the founda tion laid in blood - sacrifice; and Sebek or Jesus in Egypt had been the lamb that was slain as the foun dation of the world. He is addr essed as the la mb, son of a sheep, and as such was the Lamb of God who did not take away the sins of the world, and did not profess to have the pow er. It is in totemism that we find a first founda tion laid in sacrifice which is afterwards religious ly described as the fou nda tion of the world. The lamb was one of the sacrificial type s; Osiris, in the hum an form of his son Horus, is anot her; and from the Osirian mysteries we may learn the meaning of this “founda tion of the world” which, like so many other mysteries, has been impor ted into the Christian scheme, to be cont inue d as one of the mysteries of ignor ance and wonde ring faith, and to be accepted on the condition that it was never to be expl ained. In the Book of Revelation Jesus is “the lam b that hat h been slain from the foundat ion of the world” (XIII. 8). But in the Epistle to the Hebrews (IX. 26) this founda tion is shifted. Here the lamb has not “suffered since the founda tion of the world,” but “now onc e at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.” In that way the astronom ical was turned into the suppos ed historical Lamb of God. In the new heaven that is finally established the mother and child are re - enthrone d in glory as the lamb and the bride who is the wife of the lamb, toge ther with “the Lord God, the Almight y” (Rev. XXI, XXII; cf. ch. I. 8). And these were the three persons who previous ly com pos ed the “entire god” in Amen, the hidde n Ra, who was a form of Atum - Ra, or Huhi the Eternal. The prevalence and persistence of the lamb in the gnos tic - Christian iconogr aphy poi nt to a starting - poi nt when the vernal equi nox occurred in the sign of Aries. In the early ages of what is termed Christianity the lamb, not the man, upon the cross was the sacrificial type of the divine vi ctim, as it had been of Sebek - Horus in Egyp t at the time of the Sebek - hetep dyna sty. “And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a lamb standi ng as though it had been slain,"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"having seven hor ns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.” The lamb is but a type that is here employe d at its current value in sym bol ism, like the calf, as a sign of sacrifice, which like other type s in Revelation has to be read by me ans of the mythol ogy . As Egypt ian, the lamb, “son of a sheep,” had been a type of Horus who was called the child. This was Har - Ur, the first or elder Horus, who was “bor n but not begot ten” of the virgin 723 mother. The seven pow ers, or spirits, that were uni fied in Horus who became the all - one as “an eight h to the seven,” are now represented by the seven hor ns and seven eyes of the lamb, which are correctly described as the seven pow ers or “seven spirits of God. ” The new Jerusalem was bui lt upon the squa re. “The city lieth four - squa re, and the lengt h thereof is as great as the breadth; the lengt h and the breadth and the height thereof are equa l.” This was the heaven of Atum based upon the four qua rters of the solstices and the equi noxe s which follow ed the making of Amenta (Rev. XXI. 16). At first the form impressed upon the uni verse, in the Kamite mythol ogy , had been feminine. It was the wom b, the meskhe n, or creatory of the Great Mother, as bringe r - forth of life and the elements of life. Finally, this wa s supe rseded by the image of the man; the divine man described by Plato, who bicussated and was stamped upon the uni verse in the likeness of a cross. Now the new heaven in the Book of Revelation was formed according to “the measure of a man” (Rev. XXI. 17) . This was the heaven founde d on the four cardinal poi nts, which were represented by the cross of the four qua rters. The cross of the four qua rters, or the earlier Tat - pillar was a figur e of the pow er that sustained the uni verse as the Osiris - Tat or as the later man upon the cross. Thus the divine man, as the cruciform suppor t of all in Ptah - Sekeri or Osiris, was the prototype of the Crucified. This god of the four qua rters is por trayed as Atum - Ra in the Ritual (ch. 82) . It is he who says (by proxy) “My hea d is that of Ra and I am sum med up as Atum , four times the arm’s lengt h of Ra, four times the width of the world.” Thus Atum , the divine man, was a qua drangul ar figur e of the four qua rters in the heaven founde d according to “the measure of a man” which is reproduc ed in Revelation. We learn from the Ritual that man became the measure of the uni verse in cons eque nce of the god being divinised in the hum an form, who in his com ing to earth as the heir of Seb says, “I com e before you and make my appe arance as the god in the form of a man” (ch. 79); he who is identified in the same chapter as Atum - Ra. As Atum was the first god who assum ed the form of man, that may account for the new heaven being designe d according to “the measure of a man, ” as described in Revelat ion (XXI. 17, and Rit., ch. 82) . This was what took place at Annu when Iu, the son of Atum - Ra, designe d the “temple,” as the new heaven was called. Moreove r, as Atum - Ra was the divine man, this tends to prove that “the son of man” who is Jesus in Revelatio n was one with Iu, the Su or son of Atum - Ra. And here it is pos sible that we com e upon the origin of the Swastika cross as a typi cal figur e of the heaven that was founde d on the four corners according to the measure of a man. From the most primitive forms of the Swastika know n we learn that in its origin it was derived from the hum an figur e. The Swastika found in Egypt prove s it to have been derived from the form of a man. The four limbs, which eventually became four feet or four legs, were at first the two arms and two legs of the hum an figur e ( Pro. Bib. Arch.,"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Nov. 1900) . This, then, is the divine man whos e image was extende d crosswise on the uni verse as a type of creation, and who, as Atum in the character of Iu the son, was the Egypt ian Jesus. A por trait of the Good Shephe rd has been discove red in an unde rground 724 Rom an cemetery with the Swastika figur ed twice upon his tuni c. He carries the pan - pipes in his right hand and com es in the attitude of dancing (Lanciani, Rodol fo, New Tales of Old Rom e, p. 1 17) . This in the mythos was the you thful solar god , and Horus of the resurrection in the eschatology. “The tabernacle of God” is now “with men, and he shall dw ell with them.” As it had been ever since the child, as Horus, was incarnated in the blood of Isi s, to assum e the hum an figure when “the Word was made flesh” in the beginni ng. The mystery of Messiahship, which had been rendered in the Kamite wisdom thous ands of years before, was now repeated as Hebrew prophe cy in the Book of Revelation. In the sign o f the bul l, the bride had been represented by the sacred heifer, and Horus the child was imaged as the calf upon the hor izon. “The calf in presence of the god” is as we have seen with Horus of the solar mount , in a vigne tte to ch. 109 (Naville, Todt . Kap. ) . The victim as the sacrificial calf is also spoke n of in the Ritual (ch. 84) when the speaker says, “I am the calf painted red on the tablets.” Again he speaks of being the calf or the bul l of the sacrificial herd with the mortuary gifts upon him (ch. 105 ). One sign later in precession, there was a change of type . The vernal equi nox now entered Aries and the lamb upon the mount was subs tituted for the calf as the sacrificial victim, just as the fish was subs tituted 2,155 years later for the lamb. The new heaven of Revelation is the “heaven of eternity” in the Ritual, at the sum mit of Mount Hetep; the moul d of the mythos being cont inue d in the eschatology. For this reason there was no night there, and no more sea, and “death shall be no more.” “Neither shal l there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain any more; the first things are passed away.” And this is the vision of a spirit - life in the heaven of eternity that is no longe r simply astronom ical. The astronom ical enclosure of the non - setting stars; the tree o f life, the water of life, the sacrificial lamb, remain as type s of salvation and eternal sustenance in what the “Revelation” terms “the paradise of God” (II. 7), which is identical by name with the garden of the beginni ng in the Book of Genesis. In som e of the Papyr i, the dw elling - place upon the sum mit of eternal attainm ent, described in the Book of the Dead (ch. 110 ), is called the City of the Two Eyes, or Merti the Doubl e Eye, the two eyes that we hold to have been the stars of the two pol es seen in Equ atoria. Merti was also a place - name in Egypt . Thus , the stellar paradise upon the mount that was established in the region of the pole before the time of moon or sun remained the type of a future heaven described in Revelation which had “no need of the sun , neither of the moon to shine upon it: for the glory of God did light en it,” and the light of it, or the lum inary, “was like a stone most precious ” — otherwise it was the star Polaris. The light of the pol e - star in the primal paradise is likewise referred t o in the Talmudi c Legends of the future heaven. It is said, “There is a light which is never eclipsed or obs cured, derived from that uppe r light by which the first men coul d view the world from one end to the other” ( Avodat h Hakodesh, F, XLVI, C, 1, 2; Ste helin, Vol. II,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"pp. 20 - 24). Only one pol e - star is reproduc ed in Revelation, but in the elder legend, as we see, the first 725 men coul d view the world from one end to the other, which include d bot h pol es (or pol e - stars) that were seen at first upon the l evel of the equa torial plain and are repeated in the latest eschatology. Finally, the injunc tions at the end of the book shoul d be com pared with the Rubr ical Instructions of the Ritual. The writer of Revelation says, “Blessed is he that keepeth the words o f the prophe cy in this boo k. I testify unto every man that heareth the words of prophe cy of this book . If any man shall add unt o them, God shall add unt o him the plague s which are written in this book; and if any man shall take away from the words of the b ook of this prophe cy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the hol y city, which are written in this book ” (XXII. 7, 18, 19). In the Ritual, at the end of the book by which the soul of the Osiris is perfected in the bos om of Ra, it is said, “Let not this be seen by anyone except the minister of the fune ral and the king. By this book (or according to it) the soul of the deceased shall make its exodus with the living and prevail amongs t, or as, the gods . By this book he shall know the secrets of that which happe ned in the beginni ng. No one else has ever know n this mystical book or any part of it. It has not been spoke n by men. No eye hath deciphe red it, no ear hath heard it. It must onl y be seen by thee and the man who unf olded its sec rets to thee. Do not add to its chapters or make com mentaries on it from imagination or from memory. Carry it out (or execute it) in the judgm ent hall. This is a true Mystery, unknow n anyw here to thos e who are uni nitiated” (Rubr ical Directions to Rit., ch. 149, Birch; 148, Pierret).

B OOK XII T HE Messianic mystery which has caused unpa ralleled mental troubl e to the world did not originate with, nor was the solution to be found in, the biblical collection of the Hebrew writings . The Egypt ian “mesu,” to anoint, and as a name for the Anoi nted, is earlier than the Jewish Messiah. Nor woul d there have been any typi cal Christ the anoi nted but for the making of the Karest - mumm y. We have to look a long way beyond these books to learn how salvation came into the world by water, or a saviour coul d be represented by the fish. It was thus salvation came to Egypt periodi cally in the new life of the Nile, and thence the saviour , who w as imaged in the likeness of a fish. According to the mythical rende ring Horus - Iu - em - hetep was a saviour because he came with plenty of food and water in the inunda tion, as the shoot of, or as the child on the papyr us. In the eschatology he represented the saviour who show ed the way by which the Manes might attain eternal life, when immortality was held to be condi tiona l and depende nt upon right conduc t and true character. A doc trine of messiahship was founde d on the ever - com ing Messu, or child of the inund ation in the pre - anthropom orphi c pha se of sym bol ism, in which the type might be the fish, the papyr us - shoo t, the beetle, hawk or calf, each one of which bears witness that when the infant - likeness was adopt ed as a figur e of the ever - com ing saviour or messi ah the hum an type was just as non - historical as any of its predecessors. The adve nt of the Messu (the Hebrew Messiah) was periodi c in accordance with the natural phe nom ena: not onc e for all. Once for all coul d have no meaning in relation to that which was ever - com ing from age to age, from generation to generation, or for ever and ever. Eternity itself to the Egyp tians of the Ritual was æoni an, and synonym ous with millions of repetitions , therefore ever - com ing in the likeness of perenni al renewal, whether in the water - spring of earth or the day - spring on high, the papyr us - shoot , the green branch, or as Horus the child in whom a saviour was at lengt h embodi ed as a figur e of eternal sour ce. At the foun dation of all sacrifice we find the great Earth - mother, foll ow ing the hum an mother, giving herself for food and drink. Next the type of sacrifice was that of the ever - com ing child. Ten thous and years ago a divine ideal of matchless excellence had been por trayed in elder Horus as a vol untary 727 sacrifice of self, not for the sins of the world, but for hum an sustenance. This volunt ary victim took the parent’s place, and suffered in the mother’s stead. Thenceforth the papyr us - plant was represented by the shoot ; the tree by the branch; the sheep by the lamb; the savi our by the infant as an image of perpetual renewal in life by means of his ow n death and transformation in furnishing the elements of life. Next Horus, as the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"foremost of the seven elemental pow ers, passed into the solar mythos , where the typi cal virgin an d child were reproduc ed and cons tellated as repeaters of periodi c time and season in the Zodi ac. The Jesus - legend is Egypt ian, but it was at first without the dogm a of historic persona lity. We have now to follow it in the circuit of precession, where it m ight be traced back to a beginning with the sign of Virgo. But for the present pur pos e, the birthpl ace of the virgin’s child was in the sign of Leo when the vernal equi nox was resting in the lion cons tellation. The Messu, or the Messianic prince of peace, was bor n into the world at Memphi s in the cult of Ptah as the Egypt ian Jesus, with the title of Iu - em - hetep, he who com es with peace or plenty and good fortune as the type of an eternal yout h. Here we may not e in passing that this divine Child, Iu - em - hete p, as the image of immortal yout h, the little Hero of all later legend, the Kamite Herakles, had been one of the eight great gods of Egypt who were in existence twenty thous and years ago (Herodot us, 2, 43) . This wondr ous child, who is the figur e of ever - co ming and of perenni al renewal in the elements of life, was also know n by name as Kheper, Horus, Aten, Tum or Nefer - Atum according to the cult. He was cont inue d at On or Annu. The title likewise was repeated in the new religion, when Iu - em - hetep became the re presentative of Atum - Ra. His mother’s name at On was Ius ā as, she who was great (as) with Iusa or Iusu, the ever - com ing child, the Messiah of the inunda tion. Such doc trine, how ever, did not originate as uterine or com e the hum an way, although it might be e xpressed in hum an terminology. We have now to track the ever - com ing child Iusa, Iusu or Jesus in the sphe re of time as the son of Ius ā as and of Atum , who was Ra in his first sove reignt y; not merely in the round of the lesser year, but in the move ment of p recession as determined by the changi ng equi nox or by the shifting pos ition of the pol e. As we have show n, the Zodi acal signs were set in heaven according to the seasons of the Egypt ian year and in the annua l circuit of the sun. The birthpl ace of the Inund ation and the Grapes was figur ed in or near the sign of Virgo or the Virgin, the mother of the child who brought the new life to the land in water as Ichthus the fish and in food as Horus on his papyr us. But Horus the traveller of eternity has to be tracke d and follow ed in the move ment of Precession. And thus the new beginni ng for the present que st is in the sign of Leo. The priests of On attributed a new creation of the world, or the heavens, to Atum - Ra. This was the cultivated enclosure or garden of a ne w beginni ng. And this garden of a new beginni ng or creation was visibly featured in the sout hern heaven. There ran the river Nile as the one water from its hidde n sour ce, as it flow ed in the starry stream Eridanus , and meande red through the Aarru - garden th at was 728 made for Atum, in the likeness of which the future paradise was represented in Amenta (Rit., ch. 150, Vigne tte). According to the Osirian rende ring, the later Aarru - field is the garden of the grape (Rit., Vigne ttes). The typi cal tree of life i n an Egypt o - Greek planisphe re is the grape - vine. This is the tree still represented by the female vine - dresser and the male grape - gatherer in the Decans of Virgo (Higgi ns, W. H., Arabi c Nam es of the Stars ). Orion rose up when the grapes were ripe to repres ent the Deliverer, who was"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"com ing “full of wine.” The gobl et or “mixing - bow l” in which the drink was brewed to huge ly celebrate the Uaka - festival of the Inunda tion is cons tellated in the sign of “Krater.” The ancient enemy of man, the evil dragon of Drough t, is imaged in the form of “Hydr a,” waiting to devour the Virgin’s child the mom ent it is bor n. At one time the birthplace in the stellar mythos was where Sothis rose as ope ner of the year and herald of the Inunda tion. This was the star of Hathor and her Messu or Messianic babe who came to make war on the dragon and to bruise the serpent’s head. And Ius ā as was a form of Hathor . The fulfilment of the primitive prom ises of the com ing child as bringe r of all good things was annua l in the astronom ical mythol o gy. The babe, the birth, the birthpl ace and the bringe r to birth, were all cont inue d in the solar cult, from this, the starting - poi nt, with Sothis now as the announc er of the Inunda tion, and the life of vegetation figur ed as the young deliverer Horus on hi s papyr us, or the later Atum - Horus issuing from the lotus on the day of “com e thou to me,” the first day of the Egypt ian year or new creation. Time in the old year of the Great Bear and the Inunda tion had not been subj ect to the change s in Precession. In this year there was but one birthpl ace for the typi cal child who originated in Horus of the Inunda tion as the figur e of food and bringe r of the water, and therefore of salvation. Also there was but one date for the birthda y of the child, namely, the first of the mont h Tekki (or Thot h) which we equa te with July 25, when the five dies non are also count ed in the reckoni ng of the year. If Ra had not discove red the co - partnery of the Great Mother and Sebek - Horus the Fish of the Inunda tion, and subs tituted the t ime of the sun, the birthpl ace of the babe might have remained for ever fixed in heaven. Time in the ordinary year was always kept and reckone d by the recurring season s; firstly by the Inunda tion. In the great year this time was rectified by the retrocessi on of the equi noxe s and the changi ng pos ition of the pol e. Thus time was kept by doubl e entry. And when the birthpl ace of the Messianic child was made zodi acal it travelled round the backw ard circuit of precession to fulfil a course of six - and - twenty thous and years. The great year might have gone its way unr ecogni zed but for this change of pol e - stars or the backw ard lapsing of the equi noxes being obs erved and registered by the astronom ers. It was solar time, which had to be cont inua lly revised and readjuste d by means of the stars. The Inunda tion was a fixture in relation to the earth, and a primary factor in the year of the Great Bear, the end and re - beginni ng of which were memorized by means of the “Sut - Heb” or “festival of the tail” — that is, the tail of th e Great Bear as poi nter at its sout hernm ost longi tude , 729 which was depende nt on the revol ution of the sphe re. The Great Bear, hippopot amus or crocodi le, was then the Stellar bringe r - forth to Horus of the Inunda tion. But with Horus, bor n of Virgo in the Zodi ac, the birthpl ace of the babe was figur ed in the vernal equi nox, and thus became subj ect to the change s in precession. It parted com pany with the lesser year of the Inunda tion to travel from sign to sign around the circuit of the world’s great year. Four teen thous and years ago the vernal equi nox coincided with the sign of Virgo and the autum n equi nox with the sign of Pisces. And here the learned writer Eratosthenes has a word to say upon this poi nt. He is a most unimpeachable witness for the Egyp tian s;"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"a better coul d not be subpœ naed. He was bor n in the year 276 B.C. He was keeper of the great Alexandr ian library and the most learned Greek in Egyp t at the time. Amongs t other subj ects he wrote on was astronom y, and he testifies to the fact that the fes tival of Isis, which was celebrated in his time at the aut um n equinox , had been celebrated when the Easter equi nox was in Virgo. This perfectly agrees with the pos ition of Isis, the Virgin Mother in the Zodi ac. During thos e six mont hs in the great year=six signs , the child as periodi c fulfiller of time and season in the Zodi ac, toge ther with the birth and birthpl ace, was receding through the six signs in precession, from Virgo to Pisces. Thirteen thous and years later the autum n equi nox coincided onc e more w ith the sign of Virgo. Now there is no meeting - poi nt of the mythol ogy with the astronom y more obv ious than in these two signs of the Zodiac. But it is impos sible that this imagery shoul d have been cons tellated in the planisphe re the last time the equi noxe s entered them, which was about the year 255 B.C. , where they still linge r at the present mom ent. And the time before that, in round num bers, was 26, 000 years previous ly. It is a fixed funda mental fact that the death and rebirth of the year were com memorat ed at this time from the 20t h to the 25th of July, when the birth of Horus was announc ed by the star Sothis or the Bennu= Phœ nix. It is equa lly a fact that when the solar Horus had entered the Zodi ac the birthplace was shifted from sign to sign, according t o the movement in precession, from Virgo to Leo, from Cancer to the Gemini, from Taurus to Aries, from Aries to Pisces. The pathw ay of eternity was now depicted in the circle of precession. In this the sons hip of Horus was cont inue d after the fatherhood of God had been established, and Horus became the manifestor for the eternal in the sphe re of solar time. Hence the sayings of Horus in the Ritual. “I am Horus, the prince of eternity.” “Witness of Eternity is my name” (ch. 42). He calls himself “the persist ent traveller on the highw ays of heaven,” which he surveys as “the everlasting one .” “I am Horus,” he says, “who steppe th onw ards through eternity” — without stoppi ng or ever standi ng still. This was Horus, otherwise the Egypt ian Jesus, as the ever - com ing so n (Iu - sa) in all the years of time that culminated in the all - inclusive cycle of precession. Horus as the shoot , or the later wheat - ear (spica), had been brought forth when the birthpl ace was in Virgo. If we look on this as a sign in precession, the next b irthpl ace in the bac kward cour se is in the sign of Leo, in which Horus was the lion of the solar pow er that was doubl ed in the vernal equi nox . When the Osiris com es to witness 730 the judgm ent on the mount of glory (Rit., ch. 136 B ), he sees “the lion fo rms” called the Kherufu, which are three in number. Two of these are figur es of the Doubl e Force, as show n in the vigne tte to ch. 18, and the one in the centre is the lion of the doubl e lions =the doubl e force, as the lion or as the solar disk. Now Atum is this solar lion on the mount which is in the equi nox , and which can be thus identified with the lion - sign or sign of the lions in the Zodi ac. Atum is the god with the lion’ s face, who is also called the man - faced lion. He is said to lay the founda tions of the eternal hous e (Rit., ch. 17). That is, in bui lding the new heaven which was based upon the equi noxe s in the circuit of precession, at a certain starting - poi nt, includi ng all the previous founda tions laid by Ptah and Taht, Shu and Sut, and by the first great Mother in the Heptanom is."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" It is a tradition com mon to the Quichés, the Aztecs, the Bushm en, the Australian abor igines and other ancient races that their ancestors existed before the creation of the sun. The Bushm en say that the sun did not shine on their count ry in the beginni ng. It was onl y when the children of the first Bushm en had been sent up to the sum mit of the Mount that the sun was launc hed to give light to the Sout h African world (Bleek, Bushm en Folk - Lore, p. 9). So in Egypt it might be said there was no sun before the creation of Ra, when Atum issued from the lotus on the day of “Com e thou to me.” It is stated in the texts that light began with this new creation, when the sun - god rose up from the lotus; that is, the solar light which follow e d the luna r and the starlight which preceded day in accordance with the mythical representation. Atum - Horus sinks at evening in the waters as the closer of day, with the lotus on his head. At dawn he rises from the lotus, the ope ning flow er of dawn. But, i nstead of com mencing with the sign of Virgo, the present writer traces this new beginni ng in the solar mythos to the time when the vernal equi nox was in the sign of Leo, now som e 13, 000 to 15,000 years ago, according to the reckoni ng in the greater year. B y this, how ever, it is not meant that equa l day and night were then coincident with the birth of the Inunda tion or the heliacal rising of the dog - star on the 25t h of July. The pos ition of the equi nox has to be made out according to the precessiona l year, n ot by the lesser year. This difference cons titutes the difficulty of the reckoni ng. The time of equi nox was determined in the lesser year by the recurrence of equa l day and night , but the pos ition of the equi noxe s in the annus magnus was determined by the risings of the herald stars. Amongs t other figures of the god Atum, he is por trayed standi ng on a lion, in others he is accom panied by his mother the lioness, Sekhe t or Bast. The annua l resurrection of the solar god was always in the Easter equi nox, and wh en the fune ral couc h is figur ed in the lion - form, and the rising of the dead is from the lion - bier, the fact is registered in the eschatologi cal pha se of the astronom ical mythol ogy. It is said in the Ritual (ch. 64), “He who lulleth me to rest is the god i n lion - form.” Anot her not e of this zodi acal beginni ng with the birthpl ace in the sign of the lion is recogni zable in the arrange ment of the twelve signs as doubl e hous es for the seven planets. In ancient astrology five of the planets had each one a hous e o n either side of the Zodi ac excepting the sun and moon; these had but one hous e between the two — that is, in the 731 lion - sign; or rather, the lion - sign was the onl y dou ble hous e of the Zodi ac, and this was of necessity founde d at the place of the equi nox . The doubl e hous e of the astrologe rs is identical with the great hall of Mati, the place where the balance was always set up in whichever sign the equi nox occurred for the time being. The place of the equi nox was the hall of Mati, or rather the doubl e equ inoxe s formed the doubl e hous e of Mati. The Egypt ian founde rs of astronom ical science did not begin with mathematical calculations . They had to verify everything by obs ervation through all the range of periodi c time, and this was the onl y method that was funda mental or practical at first. It was by direct obs ervation, not by calculation, that the wise men of Egypt and Mero ē attained their know ledge of precession. By ages on ages of watching and registering they perceived that the backw ard move ment of the e qui nox, as immense in time as it is slow in motion, had to be reckone d with as a factor of vast magni tude ; and that this long hand on the face of the eternal horologe was a determinative of the huge st cycle of all, so far as"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"they coul d measure periodi c tim e. By imperceptible degrees the move ment itself had becom e appa rent, and the poi nt of equa l day and night was obs erved to be passing out of one group of stars upon the ecliptic into anot her; which som etimes coincided with a change of pol e - stars. We have n ow to trace the vernal equi nox in precession, from the sign of the lion through the signs of the crab, the twins, the bul l, the ram, unt il it entered the sign of the fishes, about 255 B.C. For 2,155 years Atum - Horus manifested, as Iu - sa, the com ing son in the vernal equi nox, or as the lion of the doubl e force, when this was in the cons tellation Leo. The next sign in precession is the crab, the Kamite original of which was the beetle, and the beetle was an emblem of Ptah and Atum as a type of the God who cam e into being as his ow n son, that is Iu - sa, the child of Ius ā as. When the equi nox had receded from the lion - sign to the hous e of the beetle – our crab – the young Jesus of the Zodi ac was there brough t forth as Kheper the beetle, the “good scarabæ us,” which typ e and title he retained unt il the Christian era. In this sign of the beetle we find the crib or mange r of the infant figured in an early form. The star called “El Nethra” by the Arabs, and “Prœsepe” by the Greeks, which is in the eight h luna r mansion, is t he crib or mange r by name. In Cancer, then, the Horus of the Zodi ac was rebor n in his solar character as the beetle of the Nile, the reproduc er of himself by transformation. Thus Horus had been bor n in his solar character as a young lion in the sign of Leo , in the mont h of the lions ; and rebor n 2,155 years later as a beetle, see Hor - Apol lo, I, 10) . Also the ass, anot her zoot ype of Iu, is figur ed in this sign of the beetle or crab. Here, then, we find the crib, or mange r, of Iu, the ass, in the sign which wa s the birthpl ace in the vernal equi nox from 12, 000 to 10, 000 years ago, and therefore the original birthpl ace of the divine infant that was bor n in a mange r or a stable, and was attende d by the ass of Atum and the bul lock of Iu. When the equi nox entered t he sign of the Twins, it no longe r coincided by a mont h in the great year with the birthplace in the crab; and there was now a difference of two mont hs betwixt the day 732 of the equi nox in the twins and the ope ning day of the sacred year, on the 25t h of July, at the time when the equi nox was in the sign of the lion. And two mont hs in the great year are equi valent to 4,310 lesser years. Next Iusa, the com ing son, the second Atum , was bor n where the equi nox rested from the year 6,465 to the year 4,310 B.C. In this sign the divine child was brought forth in the stable as a calf or a bul lock. The luna r cow was in the stable of the solar bul l, where the young babe was bor n and laid in a mange r now as Horus or Iu, the calf. Mother and child might be and were po rtrayed in human form, but it is the cow that gives the name of “Meri,” and but for the cow - headed Hathor - Meri there woul d have been no hum an Mary as a virgin - mother in the Jesus - legend. Hathor - Meri was the mother of Horus, the Su in the “hous e of a thous a nd years,” bor n in the stable or the mange r of the bul l. He had been brought forth as a young lion in the hous e of the lions , as a scarabæ us in the sign of the beetles, and now was manifested as the calf in the sign of the bull. And it was as the luna r cow in the “hous e of a thous and years” that the mother brought forth her child as a calf in the stable which was rebui lt for the oxe n, that is, for the bul l, the cow and calf, when the birthpl ace passed into the zodi acal hous e,"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"stable, or byre of Taurus.

In this stable of the templ e the mystery of the birthpl ace was sacredly performed, and the child bor n in a mange r (the Apt) was exhi bited to the worshippe rs every year. The ox and the ass that were present at the birth of the Divine child in the stable at Bethlehem were extant in th is sign. The ass had been present without the ox when the birthpl ace was in the sign of the lion; and again when the birthpl ace was in the sign of the crab. The mange r in which the little Jesus lay is figur ed in the sign of cancer, and the birth of the bab e in that sign with the mange r for his cradle had occurred 8,875 years B.C. Also the ass on which the child Iusa rode is standi ng by the mange r in the stable. The ass in the birthpl ace is a representative of the sun - god Atum - Iu, and when the ass and ox are found toge ther in the stable the birthpl ace is in the sign of the bul l. Horus or Iusa in the “hous e of a thous and years” was the bringe r of the millenni um , which was renewed in the follow ing cycle. Sut or Satan was loos ed for a little while, seven days a t most, dur ing the Saturnalia; then he was bound in chains for anot her cycle of time, whilst Horus took pos session of the hous e onc e more on a lease of a thous and years to establish his reign of peace, plenty and good luck in the dom ain of time and law, ju stice and right by the inaugur ation of anot her millenni um . The Divine mother and child had been hum anized in the Egypt ian religion when the stone monum ents begin for us, at least ten thous and years ago, but the zoot ype s were still cont inue d as data in sign - langua ge. This was the know ledge that was in pos session of the Wise Men, the Magi, the Zoroastrians, Jews, Gnos tics, Essenes and others who kept the reckoni ng, read the signs , and kne w the time at which the adve nt was to occur, onc e every four teen lifetim es (14 × 71 - 2 years), in the “hous e of a thous and 733 years,” or onc e every 2,155 years, when the prince of peace was to be rebor n as the lamb in the sign of the ram, or as Ichthus the fish in the sign of Pisces. He had been bor n as a calf in the sign of t he bul l; as the beetle in cancer; as the lion in Leo; as the red shoot of the vine in Virgo; as lord of the balance in the Scales. And when the Easter equi nox had move d round slow ly into the sign of the ram, the com ing fulfiller of the cycle was Jesus or H orus, that “Lamb of God, ” who is suppos ed to have becom e historical 2,410 years later to take away the sins of the Christian world. Before passing on to follow the vernal equi nox into the sign of the fishes (we may add the corn, of which this also was the sign on account of the harvest in Egypt ), we must glance back for a mom ent to the birthpl ace and the beginni ng with the Inunda tion, which was the sour ce of so much astronom ical mythol ogy that necessitated cont inue d readjustment of the reckoni ng in precess ion. The fish, a figure of plenty brought by the Inunda tion, was cont inue d as a sym bol of Atum - Horus. The type might be change d from the crocodi le of Sebek to the silurus or electric eel of Atum , but the fish remained as an emblem of Ichthus , or of Ichthon , that saviour of the world who came to it first in Africa by water as the fish. We have already seen that the mystical emblem called the “Vesica Pisces,” as a frame and aureole for the virgin and her child, is a living witness to the birth of Jesus from t he fish’s mout h, as it was in the beginni ng for Iusa or Horus of the"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Inunda tion. This will also expl ain why Ichthus , the fish, is a title of Jesus in Rom e; why the Christian religion was founde d on the fish; why the primitive Christians were called Piscicu li, and why the fish is still eaten as the sacrificial food on Friday and at Easter. There is evidence to show the impos sibility of this sign having been founde d in the year 255 B.C. as the sign of the vernal equi nox, either in relation to Horus the fish o r Horus the bread of life, or Iu the Su (son) of Atum - Ra. For instance, the wheat - harvest in Egypt coincides with the Easter equi nox , and always has done so since wheat was grow n and time correctly kept. In the Alexandr ian year the month Parmuti, the mont h of the mother of corn, begins on the 27t h of March, or about the time of the equi nox when this had entered the sign of Pisces. According to the table of the mont hs at Edfu and the Ramesseum , Parmuti was the very ancient godde ss of vegetation, Rannut . Rann ut was the godde ss of harvest and also of the eight h mont h in the year, which ope ned with the mont h Tekki or Thot h. From Thot h, the first mont h, to Rannut - Parmuti, the eight h mont h, is eight mont hs of the Egypt ian year, equi valent to two tetramenes in the year of three season s. When Horus had fulfilled the period of 2,155 years with the Easter equi nox in the sign of Aries, the birthpl ace passed into the sign of Pisces, where the ever - com ing one , the Renewer as the eternal child who had been brought forth a s a lion in Leo, a beetle in cancer, as one of the twins in the sign of the Gemini, as a calf in the sign of the bul l, and as a lamb in the sign of the ram, was destined to manifest as the fish, bor n of a fish - mother, in the zodi acal sign of the fishes. Th e rebirth of Atum - Horus or Jesus as the fish of Ius ā as and the bread of Nepht hys was astronom ically dated to occur and appoi nted to take place in Bethlehem of the Zodi ac about the year 255 B.C. , at the time 734 when the Easter equi nox entered the sign of Pisces, the hous e of corn and bread; the corn that was brought forth by the gestator Rannut in the eight h mont h of the Egypt ian year, and was reaped in the mont h named from Parmuti the Corn - Mother; and the bread that was kne aded by Nepht hys in the hous e o f bread. Horus, or Jesus, the fulfiller of time and law, the saviour who came by water, by blood and in the spirit, Horus the fish and the bread of life, was due according to precession in the sign of the fishes about the year 255 B.C. A new poi nt of depa rture for the religion of Ichthus in Rom e is indi cated astronom ically when Jesus or Horus was por trayed with the sign of the fish upon his head, and the crocodi le beneath his feet (fig. p. 343) . This woul d be about the year 255 B.C. (so - called). But the pe rverters of the Jesus - legend, in conc octing the Christian “history,” had falsified the time in heaven that the Egypt ians kept so sacredly on earth dur ing the ages on ages through which they zealous ly sought to discern the true way to the infinite through e very avenue of the finite, and to track the Eternal by follow ing the foot prints of the typi cal fulfiller through all the cycles and epicycles of renewing time. The type of sacrifice onc e eaten in the totemic or mortuary meal, as the fish, is still partake n of on Good Friday as the image of Ichthus ; the same in Rom e at present as in Heliopol is or Annu in the past. The type was change d from sign to sign, from age to age in the cour se of precession. The com memorative custom s light us back as far at least as t he sign of the Gemini, when twin turtle - dove s, two goa ts, or twin children were"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"sacrificed. Inde ed, there is som e evidence extant to show that the ass, a figur e of Atum - Iu, which may be found cons tellated in the decans of cancer, was at one time the type o f sacrifice, and which, to judge from its pos ition, was of cour se anterior to the “twins.” (Petrie, Egyptian Tales, p. 90.) The ass has been obs cured by the lion and other sacred animals, but it was at one time great in glory, particularly in the cult of A tum - Iu, the ass - headed or ass - eared divinity. The ass has been badly abus ed and evilly treated as a type of Sut - Typhon, whereas it was expr essly a figur e of the solar - god , the swift goe r who was Iu the Sa of Atum ; and Iu - Sa is the com ing son or the Egypt ia n Jesus on the ass. Mythically rende red, he made his adve nt as a lion, or it might be said that he came riding on an ass. Horus, the sacrificial victim, as the calf, was an especial type in the Osirian cult. The lamb is heard of as expr essly Jewish; the la mb that was roasted on the cruciform spit to image the Crucified upon the cross at Easter, when the lamb was yet the typi cal victim. When the equi nox passed into the ram - sign Horus or Iusa became the lamb “son of a sheep,” who as son of the father was the son of God, an especial type with the Sebek - heteps. When the vernal equi nox entered onc e more into the sign of the “fishes” the time had com e for the type to change back again to the fish which had been eaten as a typi cal sacrifice thous ands of years befor e when the crocodile was eaten onc e a year as the zoot ype of Sebek - Horus, “the almighty fish in Kamurit” (Rit., ch. 88) , the bringe r of plenty in the inunda tion of the Nile. The adve nt of a Jewish Jesus, as the fish Ichthus , was depende nt on the Messu or Messiah - son being incarnated when the vernal equinox 735 was entering Pisces in the circuit of precession, where the female bringe r - forth was figur ed as the mother - fish, instead of the sheep, the cow or the lione ss. The astronom ers kne w and foretold tha t the Divine babe was to be born in the sign of the fishes, the sign of the Messiah Dag, of An, of Oan or Jona h. It is proba ble that the name of Rom e was derived from an Egypt ian name for the fish, and that Rom a was the fish - godde ss. Rem, Rum , or Rom e sign ifies the fish in Egypt ian. Be this as it may, the fish - man (or wom an?) rules in Rom e. The ring with which the Pope is inve sted, his seal - ring, has on it the sign of the fish, and Ichthon the Saviour was brought on in Rom e as Ichthus the fish, or otherwise personi fied as the “historical Jesus.” This is illustrated in the Catacom bs, where the fish emaning Jona h from its mout h has been suppos ed by Christians to represent the resurrection of an historical Jew. The name of the Piscina given to the baptismal fon t likewise show s the cult of the fish. Thos e who were baptized in the Piscina as primitive Christians were know n by name as the Pisciculi. “Ichthus ” also was the secret password and sign of salutation betwixt the Christian Pisciculi. Bryant copi ed from an ancient Maltese coin the figure of Horus, who carries the crook and fan in his hands and wears a fish - mitre on his head. This was Horus of the Inunda tion, who was emaned from the water as a fish and by the fish, but who is here por trayed in a hum an form w ith the fish’s mout h for a mitre on his head. (Bryant, v. 5, p. 384. ) The wearer of the os tincæ on his head is not onl y the fish - man in survival, the petticoated Pope is likewise a figur e of the ancient fish - wom an; she who sat upon the waters and on the s even hills of the celestial Heptanom is as a water - cow , who brought forth from the mystical mout h of the fish. The Pope is dressed in the likeness of bot h"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"sexes. The “os tincæ” of the papal mitre, equa lly with the star Fom alhaut in Piscis Australis of the p lanisphe re, and the mout hpi ece of the divine Word, is still the same antique as when the ancient Wisdom was first figured as the female fish, the crocodi le, and the male fish was a likeness of the Saviour who came by water in the Inunda tion before Horus co uld com e by boa t, or float on the papyr us - plant in hum an form; so long has the fish been a zoot ype of emaning sour ce in the Egypt ian eschatology. The Pope impersona tes the mout hpi ece, the fish’s mout hpi ece of the Word, and, as the imagery show s, the Word, or Logos , is the same that was uttered of old as a fish by the ancient mother - fish with the os tincæ or mout h of utterance from which a child is bor n; so that the mother - chur ch in Rom e, as represented by the Pope , is still the living likeness of the fish - m other, who brought forth Horus of the Inund ation as her fish in the Zodi ac, at least som e 12, 000 or 13, 000 years ago, and had never ceased to do so annua lly up to the time of rebirth in the sign of the fishes, when Papal Rom e took up the parable but suppr e ssed or om itted the expl anation conc erning the Christ now apot heosized as Ichthus the fish. Thus , as previous ly demons trated, the prope r date for the com mencement of Christianity or equi noc tial Christianity is som ewhere about 255 B.C. One of the most perf ect illustrations of fulfilment attained by the mythos may be studi ed in a scene that was copi ed from the Rom an 736 Catacom bs by De Rossi ( Rom . Sot t., 2, pl. 16) . In this the seven great spirits appe ar in hum an gui se, who are elsewhere represented by the seven fishers or the seven lambs with Horus, ignor antly suppos ed to be an historic personage. These seven are with the fish in the sign of the two fishes, who are figur ed as the two fishes laid out on two dishes. Moreove r, lest there might be any mistake in reading the picture it is placed between two other illustrations . In one of these the lamb is por trayed as the victim of sacrifice; in the other a fish is lying with the bread upon the altar. So that the central picture show s the result of the trans fere nce from the sign of the ram to the sign of the fishes. In anot her scene the seven who were follow ers of Horus are portrayed toge ther with seven baskets of bread (Bosio, pp. 216 , 217) . In relation to the group of seven spirits in the Rom an Catacom bs it mus t be not ed that the com pany of twelve, as follow ers of Horus, or disciples of Iusa, was not a primary formation. It was preceded by the group of seven, the seven who were with Horus, the leader of that “glorious com pany, ” from the beginni ng; the same in th e eschatology as in the astronom ical mythol ogy. They are the seven with Horus in the bark of soul s or Sahus that was cons tellated in Orion. In the creation attribut ed to Atum - Ra, which ope ned on the day of “com e thou hither,” otherwise upon the resurrectio n day, the seven great spirits are assigne d their place in this new heaven; they are called the seven glorious one s “who are in the train of Horus”; and who follow after the coffined one , that is Osiris - Sekari, whos e bier or coffin was conf igur ated in the greater bear. They who follow ed their lord as his attenda nts in the resurrection were also groupe d as seven khut i in the lesser bear. In his various adve nts Horus was attende d by the seven great spirits termed his seshu, or his servants. So Jesus, accordi ng to Hebrew prophe cy, was to be attende d by the seven spirits called (1) the spirit of the Lord; (2) the spirit of wisdom ; (3) the spirit of unde rstandi ng; (4) the spirit of couns el; (5) the spirit of might ; (6) the spirit of"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"know ledge ; (7) the spirit of the fear of the Lord (Is. XI. 1, 2). These, as Egypt ian, were they who had originated as the seven elemental powers and who afterwards became the Khut i as the seven great spirits. But in their Hebrew gui se they are evapor ized and attenua ted past all recogn ition except as a septenary of spirits. The seven with Jesus as a group of attenda nt pow ers or follow ers may be seen in the seven dove s that hove r round the child in utero; the seven solar rays about his head; the seven lambs or rams with Jesus on the moun t; the seven as stars with Jesus in the midst; the seven as fishers in the boa t; and lastly, the seven as com muni cants who solemnize the Eucharist with the loaves and fishes in the mortuary meal of the Rom an Catacom bs. There are various pictures in the Cat acom bs which can onl y be expl ained by the pre - Christian gnos is. This alone can tell us why the divine infant shoul d be imaged as a little mum my with the solar halo round his head, or why the so - called “Star of Bethlehem” shoul d be figured with eight rays. Such things are Egypt o - gnos tic remains belongi ng to the Chur ch in Rom e that was not founde d on the Canoni cal Gospels, but was pre - extant as gnos tic; the Chur ch of Marcion and of Marcelina. Several of these pictures cont ain the group of the seven great spir its who were with 737 Horus of the Resurrection at his adve nt in the sign of Pisces, as they had been with him in the previous signs when he was the lamb, the calf, the beetle or the lion. Two pictures are copi ed by Lundy , one from De Rossi’s Rom an Sot te rane a Christiana (vol . 1) and one from Bosio ( Rom . Sot t. ). In the one scene seven persons are seated at a semicircular table with two fishes and eight baskets of bread before them. In the other scene, seven persons are kne eling with two fishes, seven cakes and seven baskets of bread in front of them (Lundy, Monum ental Christiani ty, figs. 169 and 171). Now , there is not hing whatsoever in the canoni cal Gospels to account for or sugge st the eight baskets - full of cakes which are som ewhat com mon in the Catacom b s. These we claim to be a direct survival from the Egypt ian; the eight loaves or cakes which are a sacred regul ation number in the Ritual. According to the Rubr ical directions appe nde d to chapter 144 it is com mande d that eight Persen loaves, eight Shenen l oaves, eight Khenfer loaves, and eight Hebennu loaves are to be offered at each gate of the seven arits or mansions of the celestial Heptanom is. These offerings were made for the feast of illum ining the earth, or elsewhere (ch. 18), the coffin of Osiris, a nd therefore for the festival of the Resurrection and solemnizing of the Eucharist. The seven persons present with the Lord are identifiable with the typi cal seven follow ers of Horus as the seven khut i or glorious one s. The speaker, who persona tes the lord of the seven, says “I am the divine leader of the seven. I am a khu, the lord of the khus .” The Osiris Nu thus celebrates the mont hly festival by offering eight loaves or cakes at each of the seven halls. The khus were seven in num ber or eight with Horus their lord, in whom Osiris rose again from the condi tion of the dead. The chapter is to be repeated ove r a picture of the seven sove reign chiefs, which we now claim to be the original of the seven persona ges that keep the sacramental ceremony in the Cataco mbs when the eight cakes are figur ed on the table of the seven persona ges who have been termed the “Septem Pii Sac erdot es” (Northcote and Brow nlow , Rom . Sot t., vol . 2, pl. 17, p. 68) . But to return, our starting - poi nt for tracking the move ment in precessio n was with the vernal equi nox in the sign of"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Leo, on the birthda y of the year that was determined at the time by the heliacal rising of the star which announc ed the birthpl ace of Horus, now figur ed in the solar zodi ac, nigh where the evil dragon Hydr a lay in wait to devour the babe as soon as it was bor n. This was about 11, 000 years B.C. , or 13, 000 years ago. During these eleven thous and years, by the change s in precession and the cont inua l rectification of the calenda r from old style to new, July 25t h at s tarting had receded to December 25t h in the end. That is, the birthda y of the com ing child Iusa or Horus in the Lion sign, celebrated on the 25t h of July, came to be com memorated on the 25th of December at the end of this period, by thos e who kept the reck oni ng, and this, as will be show n, is precisely what did occur in the evol ution of the Jesus - legend. Two birthda ys had been assigne d to Horus of the doubl e hor izon, one to child - Horus in the autum n, the other to Horus the adul t in the vernal equi nox. Thes e were the two times or teriu of the year. But when the solstices were adde d to the equi noxe s in the new creation of 738 the four qua rters established by Ptah for his son Atum - Ra, there was a further change . The place of birth for the elder, the mortal H orus who was bor n child of the Virgin Mother, now occurred in the winter solstice and the place of rebirth for Horus the eternal Son was celebrated in the vernal equi nox , with three mont hs between the two pos itions instead of six. If the birth occurred at Christmas with the winter solstice in the sign of the Archer, the Resurrection at Easter woul d occur in the sign of the fishes as at present. The equi noxe s, of cour se, remained upon the doubl e horizon, whereas the winter solstice took place in the depths o f Amenta, and this became the place of rebirth for the child - Horus as Iu - sa, the com ing son in the astronom ical mythol ogy. Horus in the autum nal equi nox was now succeeded by Horus who suffered in the winter solstice. The Jews still celebrate their mysterie s annua lly as mysteries. And it is instructive to not e that with them the two times remain equi noc tial, and have never been change d to the winter solstice and Easter equi nox. The Jews have subt erranean reasons for not accepting the Messiah bor n at Christma s. Theirs are the mysteries of the doubl e horizon; or of Ra - Harmachis. The doubl e birth of Horus at the two times, or the birth of the babe in the winter solstice and the rebirth as the adul t in the Easter equi nox is acknow ledge d in the Egypt ian Book of th e Divine Birth. The celebration of the Nativity at the solstice is referred to in the calenda r of Edfu, and it is said that “everything is performed which is ordained” in the “Book of the Divine Birth.” Also, it was com mande d in the calenda r of Esné that t he precepts of the Book on the Second Divine Birth of the child Kahi “were to be performed on the first of the mont h Epiphi ” (cited by Lockye r, Daw n of Astronom y, pp. 284 - 6). The child Kahi is a pseudonym for the child - Horus. He is the revealer, the logos or word, and the “Revelation of Kahi” is associated with New Year’s day, when this occurred on the 26t h of the mont h Payni . Now the first and second “divine births” (or the birth and rebirth) of Horus were celebrated at the festivals of the winter solstice and the Easter equi nox , and these are the two times of the two Horuses identified by Plutarch, the first as manifestor for Isis, the Virgin Mother, the second as Horus, the Son of God the Father, when he tells us that “Harpoc rates (Har the Khart, or child ) is born about the winter solstice, immature and infant - like in the plants that flow er and spring up early, for which reason they offer to"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"him the first - fruits of grow ing lentils; and they celebrate her (Isis) being brought to bed after the vernal equi nox ” (Of Is. and Os., ch. 65). Here are the three mont hs between the two birthda ys which were celebrated at the two festivals now know n as Christmas and Easter. Two different birthda ys were likewise assigne d to the Greek Apol lo. One of these was com memorated by the Delians at the time of the winter solstice; the other by the Delphi ans in the vernal equi nox . According to the decree of Canopus ( B.C. 238) the date of Osiris’s entry into the moon at the annua l resurrection had then receded to the 29t h of Choi ak, equi valent to December 26t h, in the Alexandr ian year, which was established in the reign of Augus tus, B.C. 25. “The entry of Osiris into the sacred bark takes place here annua lly at the 739 defined time on the 29t h day of the month Choi ak.” In this way t he Christmas festival, by which the “Birth of Christ” is now celebrated, can be identified with the yearly celebration of the rebirth of Osiris (or Horus) in the moon. Moreove r, we can thus trace it, follow ing the cour se of precession, from the 17t h of Ath or (Octobe r 5th in the sacred year; Nove mber 14t h in the Alexandr ian year), mentione d by Plutarch, to the 29t h of Choi ak, our December 26t h. The next day, December 27t h, was the first of Tybi , and this was the day on which the child - Horus was crow ned, and the festival of his corona tion celebrated. If we reckon the 25t h of December (28t h Choi ak) to be the day of birth, the day of resurrection and of the crow ning in Amenta is on the third day. In the month - list of the Ramesseum , Tybi is the mont h dedicated to Amsu, the Horus who arose from the dead in Amenta, and who was crow ned as conque ror on the third day — that is, on December 27t h= Tybi 1st. There are several sym bols of this resurrection on the third day. First, Osiris rises on that day in the new moon . Next , Amsu figur es as the Sahu - mum my risen to his feet, with right arm free, as ruler in Amenta, the earth of eternity. Thirdly, Horus the child is ruler in Amenta, the earth of eternity. Thirdly, Horus the child is crow ned in the seat of Osiris for anot her ye ar. Fourthly, the Tat was erected as a figure of the god re - arisen, and a type of eternal stability in the depths of the winter solstice. Thus the resurrection on the third day was in Amenta and not upon this earth. The Egypt ians celebrated their festival of the resurrection every year, called the feast of Ptah - Sekari - Osiris, in the mont h Choi ak (Nove mber 27t h, December 26t h, Alexandr ian year). The rite is otherwise know n as “the erection of the Tat - pillar.” Erman recove red a description of the festival fr om a Theban tom b. Of this he says: “The special festival was of all the greater impor tance because it was solemnized on the morning of the roya l jubi lee. The festivities began with a sacrifice offered by the king to Osiris, the “L ORD of Eternity,’ a mum mie d figure, wearing the Tat - pillar on his head.” It lasted for ten days, from the 20t h to the 30t h of the mont h Choi ak, the 26t h being the great day of feasting. The roya l endow ment of the temple at Medinet Habu for the sixth day of the festival include d 3,6 94 loaves of bread, 600 cakes, 905 jugs of beer and 33 jars of wine. This was the great day of eating and drinki ng, correspondi ng to our Christmas gor ging and guz zling, but on the 22nd December, instead of the 25t h, of a som ewhat later period. The festival was devot ed to the god Osiris - Ptah - Sekari, who had been dead and was alive again; cut in pieces and recons tituted with his vertebræ sound and not a bone of his body found to be broke n or missing. The festival of the sixth day is clearly the Ha - k - er - a feas t"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"that was celebrated on the sixth night of the Ten Mysteries. Moreove r, the ten days of the festival that was sacred to the god Osiris - Sekari are also in agreement with the ten night s of the mysteries (Rit., ch. 18) . In the scene copi ed from the Theban to mb the “Nobl e Pillar” of the Tat - cross is to be seen lying prone ly on the ground where it had been ove rthrow n by Sut and the Sebau. The obj ect of the festival was to celebrate the re - erection of the Tat and turn the Cross of death onc e more into the Cross of life as the sym bol of resurrection. The king, as representative of Horus who recons titutes 740 his father, with the aid of the roya l relatives and a priest, pul ls the pillar upr ight . Four priests bring in the usual table of offerings and place them in front of the Tat. So far, says Erman, we can unde rstand the festival. But the further ceremoni es refer to mythol ogi cal events unknow n to us. Four priests with their fists raised rush upon four others, who appe ar to give way; two more strike each other, an d one standi ng by says of them, “I seize Horus shining in truth.” Then follow s a great floggi ng scene, in which fifteen persons beat each other mercilessly with their sticks and fists; they are divided into several groups , two of which, according to the in scription, represent the peopl e of the tow n Pa and of the tow n Tepu. This is evidently the representation of a great mythol ogi cal fight , in which were enga ged the inhabitants of Pa and Tepu, i.e., of the ancient city of Buto, in the north of the delta. “Th e ceremoni es which close the sacred rite are also qui te probl ematic; four herds of oxen and asses are seen driven by their herdsmen, and we are told in the accom panyi ng text four times they circle round the walls on that day when the nobl e Tat - pillar is re - erected.” Raising the Tat - pillar was typi cal of Horus in his second adve nt raising the dead Osiris from his sepul chre and calling the mum my to com e forth alive. The gods in Tattu on the night of the resurrection, sym bol ized by this re - erection of the Tat , are Osiris, Isis, Nepht hys , and Horus the avenge r of his father. Thus in re - erecting the Tat, Amenhe tep III, with his que en Ti and one of the roya l princesses were persona ting Horus the avenge r and the two divine sisters in the resurrection of Osiris. (R it., ch. 18. ) The Christians celebrate the birth of the divine babe at Christmas and the death and resurrection at Easter; whereas the birth and death were com memorated at the same season in the Egypt ian mysteries of Ptah, and later of Osiris — as it was in the beginni ng, when the death was that of the old year and the rebirth that of the new year; otherwise, the death of Osiris and the birth of Horus, or the death of Atum and the rebirth of Iusa. The new year came to be reckone d from the shor test day when t he sun had reached its low est poi nt and the shadow of darkne ss or the dragon its utmost lengt h. The sufferings of the Sun - god were naturally accredited to him at that time, and the death and resurrection in Amenta were bot h timed to the solstice. The sun w as lord of light as ruler of the lesser year. The Apap - mons ter was the reptile pow er of darkne ss, and of desert drought . This dreaded adve rsary of the sun was now the uppe rmost, Osiris in Amenta was the victim in the winter solstice. The suffering and deat h of Osiris were the cause of the long period of mourning, of fasting and suppl ication that was memorized in the mysteries. In the winter solstice the birth took place below , in Amenta, the earth of Sut, and habitat of the Apap - reptile. In the equi nox at E aster, Horus the fulfiller was transformed from the hum an child to the divine hawk - headed Horus, who rose from the"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"unde rworld as the spirit of life and light and food, and who was then re - fleshed or re - incorpor ated anew on earth, conc eived of the Virgin, i ncarnated in her blood onc e more, to be brought forth in hum an shape again at Christmas; and by the gestator 741 in the divine form, as Horus of the resurrection now rebor n at Easter. The last night of the old year (July 24th), “the night of the child i n the cradle,” had been named from the new birth as the Mesiu; also the evening meal of the next day, the first of the new year, was called the “Mesiu.” These were the exact equi valent of our Christmas Eve and Christmas Day on December 24th and 25t h, after a lapse of 11, 000 years in time according to the move ment in precession. The sacred old Egypt ian year, which ope ned on the first of Tekki (or Thot h) as the year of the great Bear and the inunda tion, began upon the 25t h of July in the year of 365 days. The refore July 24t h was the last night of the old year and the 25t h (or the 20th in the year of 360 days) was New Year’s Day, the birthda y of Horus the child, or fish of the inunda tion. Time was sacredly kept by means of the festivals, and these were redated age after age from old style to new. The decree of Canopus is bot h expl icit and empha tic on the necessity of correctly readjusting the calenda r to the lapse of time, whether in the Sothiac cycle or the move ment in precession so that “the case shall not occ ur that the Egypt ian festivals by which time was kept – now celebrated in winter – shoul d be celebrated som e time or other in sum mer, as has occasiona lly occurred” in times past, in cons eque nce of the calenda r being incorrectly kept ( Records, vol . 8, p. 87) . For example, a new year was introduc ed by the Egypt ian priests B.C. 25, in the name of the Rom an Emperor Augus tus, which is know n as the Alexandr ian year. When this new year was established a readjustment was made to allow for the lapse in precession and t o correct the calenda r. At this time the so - called “sacred year” was for the last time readjusted. This was that year of 360 days which was based on the twelve moons or mont hs of thirty days each and on the reckoni ng permanently figur ed in the 360 degrees of the ecliptic that was to be kept in endl ess sanctity how soever suppl emented by other reckoni ngs in the total com bination to be uni ted in the great precessiona l year of 360 × 71 − 2= 26, 000 years. In this corrected calenda r the first of Choi ak, which fell on Octobe r 18 th in the sacred year is shifted to November 27 th in the Alexandr ian year, and there is a rectification of time to the extent of forty day s. These forty days in the lesser year represent nearly 3,000 years in the cycle of precession. In other wor ds stellar time was corrected by the time of the sun and determined on the grand scale by the pos ition of the vernal equi nox. This had now receded to the sign of Pisces, when Horus or Jesus, who had been the “Lamb of God” in the previous sign, and the calf in the sign of the bul l, was figur ed as the fish by the Egypt o - gnos tic artists (fig. on p. 343 ). Thus the cult was cont inue d without a break in Rom e. Augus tus persona lly pos ed himself in the character of the expe cted one , the Prince of Peace, the Messiah of the astronom ical mythol ogy and thence in the eschatology. At the time when the change of equi nox from Aries to Pisces occurred in the great year, or in conne ction with this event, the birthpl ace was rebui lt as the crib or cradle, meskhe n, or hol y of ho lies in the temple for the new - bor n babe. Now the temple of Hathor at Dende rah was last rebui lt in the time of the Ptolemies, a century or"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 742 so B.C. The inscriptions show that this rebui lding of the temple was attribut ed to Augus tus. He never was at De nde rah in person, but the ruler in Rom e was assigne d the place of the king or Pharaoh in Egypt as rebui lder of the temple for Hathor and her babe, and the king on earth was the roya l representative, first as the Repa, then as the Ra, of the king, who was d ivine or astronom ical. Augus tus was inve sted with this divinity, and thus the Egypt ian doc trine was cont inue d in the person of the Emperor in Rom e. Augus tus proclaimed himself to be not merely a hum an likeness, but the very God himself on earth. “The rever ence due to the gods ,” says Tacitus ( Annal s, I, 10) , “was no longe r peculiar; Augus tus claimed equal worship. A mortal man was directly ador ed, and priests and pont iffs were appoi nted to pay him impious hom age.” Thus the apot heosis of a mortal had begun an d a kind of papacy was already established as a bridge betwixt Alexandr ia and Rom e. The vernal equi nox was now in Pisces, and Horus, as type , was the fish instead of the lamb or ram. “Ichthus the fish” had been a title self - conf erred by Alexande r in his ap otheosis 300 years earlier. So Augus tus, in relation to the same fulfilment in astronom ical time was Ichthus the fish in Rom e before the title was conf erred upon a suppos ed historical Jesus of Nazareth. Thus the festival now dated Choi ak 29th in the Alexan drian year had been celebrated 3,000 years earlier in the sacred year, and we behol d it being readjusted according to the reckoni ng in precession as it had been aforetime. It has often been a matter of wonde rment why the birthda y of the Son of God on eart h shoul d be celebrated as a festival of unl imited gor ging and guz zling. The expl anation is that the feast of Christmas Day is a survival of the ancient Uaka festival, with which the rebirth of the Nilotic year was celebrated with uproarious revellings and rejoicings , as the festival of returning food and drink. It was at onc e the natal - day of the Nile, and of the Messu or Messianic child unde r his various names. It is called the birthda y of Osiris in the Ritual (ch. 130 ). Osiris, or the young god Horus, cam e to earth as lord of wine, and is said to be “full of wine” at the fair Uaka festival. The rubr ic to chapter 130 states that “bread, beer, wine, and all good things ” are to be offered to the manes upon the birthda y of Osiris, which, in the course of time, became equi valent to our New Year’s festival, or Christmas Day. The grapes were ripe in Egypt at the time the imagery was given its starry setting. This offers a datum as determinative of time and season. The times might change in heaven’s “enor mous year” ; other doc trines be develope d unde r other names; the grapes be turned to raisins. But the old Festival of Intoxi cation still lived on when celebrated in the name of Christ. The babe that is born on Christmas Day in the morning is Horus of the inun dation s till. The mythical ideal of a saviour - child was Egypt ian. But this ideal did not originate in the hum an child. The child was preceded by other type s of eternal, ever - com ing yout h. Each year salvation came to Egypt with the waters just in time to save the land from drought and famine, and the pow er that saved it was represented by the shoot of the papyr us, or the fish as the bringe r of food and drink 743 "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"on which the salvation of the peopl e depende d; and the bringe r of these was Horus the saviour , as the Messu of the inunda tion. Horus the jocund who rose up as Orion “full of wine,” with Krater for his cons tellated “cup” that held 7,000 gallons of intoxi cating drink; Horus who brought the grapes to make the wine; who drow ned the fiery dragon Hydr a, was he w ho came to Egypt as a veritable saviour onc e a year. The same mythical character passed into Greece and is also repeated in the Canoni cal Gospels as the wine - bibbe r who com es eating and drinki ng. In this way the birth of the child at Christmas and the reb irth at Easter came to represent the keeping of time in the great year, which can be calculated by a twofold process of reckoni ng, from the original starting - poi nt. On the one hand, the lapse of time in the cour se of precession is five months=the equi nox p assing through the five signs , that is, from July 25t h (the first of Taht) to December 25t h. On the other hand, the time taken for the equi nox to travel through the five signs is the exact equi valent in the great year to the five mont hs’ lapse in the solar year of 365 days. The reckoni ng has to be made one way by the lesser year, from July 25t h to December 25t h in accordance with the natural fact. The other way it has to be com puted on the scale of the great year in the cycle of precession. The total result of this twofold and verifiable com put ation is that on the one side we are ultimately lande d with a birthday of Iusa in the solstice at Christmas, and on the other hand we are lande d with the birthday or day of rebirth for Iusa at Easter, when the equi nox was entering the sign of the fishes, about 255 years before the time that has been falsely dated “ B.C. ” One know s well enough that Christian credul ity is qui te capable of still assum ing that this Jesus who manifested dur ing 10,000 years in the astronom ica l mythol ogy , and who was accreting the typi cal character of the uni que person all that time, is but the fore - shadow cast bac kwards by the historical figure in whom they believe as the one reality of all realities. Nevertheless, the fact remains that, such being the character pre - extant, there was not hing left to have any historical hum an origin at the wrong end of 10,000 years. This is a strictly scientific and not - to - be - cont rove rted demons tration of the indubi table truth that the birthda y of the Messiah n ow celebrated on the 25th of December had been celebrated for at least 10,000 years on the correspondi ng day as the birth of the Egypt ian Messu at the feast of the Messiu on the first day of the Egypt ian year, which was the 25th of July, from the time when the Easter equi nox was in the sign of the lion. There is evidence also that the lapse of time was religious ly rectified in the readjusted calenda r according to the cour se of precession from July 25t h dow n to December 25t h, when the winter solstice coincid ed with the sign of Sagittarius and the vernal equi nox first entered the sign of Pisces, in the year that was errone ous ly dated. Through all the ten or eleven millenni um s intervening the Messu had periodi cally manifested in the annua l inunda tion and as the fulfiller of time in the hous e of a thous and years, whilst the Easter equi nox kept travelling and the birthpl ace shifting, 744 from Virgo to the lion, from the lion to the crab, from the twins to the bul l, from the ram to the fishes. All that went to th e making of the latest legenda ry saviour , barring the false belief, was pre - extant on entirely other grounds in the Egypt ian mythol ogy and eschatology; and when the Easter equi nox entered the sign of the fishes, about 255 B.C. ,"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"the Jesus who is the one ver ifiable founde r of so - called Christianity was at least 10, 000 years of age and had been travelling hither as the Ever Com ing One through all this period of time. During that vast lengt h of years the young Fulfiller was periodi cally mothered as mortal by th e Virgin with Seb for his reput ed earthly father and with Anup the baptizer as his precursor and announc er in the wilderness. All that time he had fought the battle with Satan in the desert dur ing forty days and night s each year in every one of thos e 10, 00 0 years as a matter of fact in the natural phe nom ena of time and season in Egypt . During thos e 10, 000 years that ideal of the divine incarnated in Iusa the Com ing Son had gone on grow ing in the mind of Egypt preparatory to its being rende red historically a s the divine man of a later cult by those delude d idiotai who dreamt the astronom ical forecast had been fulfilled in Hebrew prophe cy and in veritable hum an fact, through their ignor ance of sign - langua ge and the wisdom of the past. The two birthda ys at Chr istmas and Easter which were assigne d to Iusa in his two characters of child - Horus and Horus the adul t, Horus the Earth - bor n and Horus the Heaven - bor n in the Osirian mythos , were brough t on as the two birthda ys of Jesus. But there was a diversity of opi nio n amongs t the Christian Fathers as to whether Jesus the Christ was bor n in the winter solstice or in the vernal equi nox. It was held by som e that the 25t h of March was the natal day. Others maintained that this was the day of the incarnation. According to Clement Alexande r, the birth of Jesus took place upon the 25th of March. But in Rom e the festival of Lady - day was celebrated on the 25t h of March in com memoration of the miraculous conc eption in the wom b of a virgin, which virgin gives birth to the child a t Christmas, nine mont hs afterwards. According to the Gospel of James (ch. 18) it was in the equi nox, and cons eque ntly not at Christmas, that the virgin birth took place. At the mom ent of Mary’s delivery on what is designa ted “the day of the Lord” the birt h of the Babe in the cave is described. It occurs at Bethlehem. Joseph went out and sought a midw ife in the count ry of Bethlehem. “And I, Joseph, walked, and I walked not : and I look ed up into the sky, and saw the air violently agi tated; and I look ed up at the pol e of heaven, and saw it stationar y, and the fow ls of heaven were still; and I look ed at the earth and saw a vessel lying, and workmen reclining by it, with their hands in the vessel, and thos e who handl ed did not handl e it, and thos e who took hol d did not lift, and thos e who presented it to their mout h did not present, but the faces of all were look ing up; and I saw the sheep scattered, and the sheep stood, and the shephe rd lifted up his hand to strike them, and his hand remained up; and I look ed at the stream of the river, and I saw that the mout hs of the kids were dow n, and not drinking; and everything which was being impelled forward was intercepted in its cour se.” There can be no doubt of this description being equi noc tial. It is a picture of the 745 perfect count erpoi se between night and day which onl y occurs at the level of the equi nox when the Lord of the balance is rebor n in the hous e of a thous and years, or at som e other fresh stage in the circuit of precession: and the Messiah Dag was now in the hous e of the fish and of bread, with the prophe cy fulfilled according to the astronom ical reckoni ng. This dua lity of the divine birth at Christmas and Easter has been the cause of inextricable conf usion to the Christians, who never coul d adjust the falsehood to the fact; and now at last we recove r the fact itself that will be fatal to the falsehood."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" It will be elabor ately demons trated that the conc octers of Christianity and its spur ious records had a second - hand acqua intanceship with the Egypt ian R itual, and that they wrought into their count erfeit Gospels all that coul d be made to look more or less historical - like as a sacerdot al mode of obt aining mastery ove r the minds of the utterly ignor ant, who were held to be the “better believers.” But they n ever coul d determine whether the divine child was bor n at Christmas or at Easter, which was naturally impos sible to the one - man scheme of suppos ed historic fulfilment. Again, in the Christian version the crucifixion= the death of Osiris, has been pos tpone d unt il Easter. This makes the period of mourning wrong . In Egypt there was a time of fasting for forty days dur ing the Egypt ian Lent. The mour ning and the fasting naturally follow ed the suffering and the death of Osiris, which suppl ied the raison d’être. Bu t when the death was shifted to Easter, to be celebrated in accordanc e with the Jewish Passover, to which it was hitched on, the long time of fasting remained as in Egyp t, and for the first time in this world the death was preceded by the mourning with whi ch the murder is suppos ed to have been com miserated and solemnized. The four th Sunda y in Lent is com monl y obs erved in Europe by the name of “Dead Sunda y.” But the death then celebrated or “carried out” has no relation to a persona l crucifixion that is assu med to have occurred onc e upon a time at Easter. Such custom s follow ed Christmas or the death in winter with a prehistoric signi ficance varying in accordance with the old style and new in the keeping of the festivals; whereas there is no death at Christmas in the Christian scheme to be celebrated before Easter or to account for the mour ning - festival dur ing Lent. The death and rebirth at Christmas, or New Year, and the resurrection at Easter can onl y be expl ained by the Osirian mysteries, and these are still celebrated throughout Europe , precisely the same as in Asia and in Africa. The Ritual also has a word to say conc erning the Jewish Sabba th of Saturday, and the Christian Sabba th sacred to the sun. The ancient Egyp tians celebrated festivals on the first, t he sixth, the seventh, and the fifteenth of the mont h. The feast of the first and the fifteenth was a festival of Ra and the day was dedicated to Horus, who represented the earlier sun, and whos e Sabba th was the seventh day, or Saturday in the earlier cult . It is said in the Ritual, “I am with Horus on the day when the Festivals of Osiris are celebrated, and when offerings are made on the sixth day of the mont h, and on the Feast of the Tenait in Heliopol is” (Rit., ch. 1). This Tenait was a feast associated with the seventh day of the mont h. Here then is a feast of the sixth and 746 seventh, or night and day, correspondi ng to the Jewish Sabba th. Osiris entered the moon on the sixth day of the mont h. The seventh was the feast - day, when “coupl ings and conc ept ions did abound. ” This was celebrated in Annu, the city of the sun, and thus far the day was a sun - day. The word tenai t denot es a measure of time, a division, a week or a fortnight . A feast - day on the seventh, dedicated to the solar god, woul d be the sun’ s day, or Sunday onc e a mont h. Now , two great festivals were dedicated to Ra, the solar god , upon the seventh and fifteenth of the mont h. Here, then, is a fifteen - day fortnight, or solar half - mont h (fifteen days), which was correlated with the half - mont h, o r tenai t, of four teen days in the luna r reckoni ng. The sixth of the mont h was a moon - day, on the night of which the love - feast of Agapæ began with the entrance of Osiris, earlier Horus, into the moon , or the conj unc tion, say, of Horus or Hu with Hathor . Th is was on Friday"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"night . The next day was a pha llic festival in celebration of the celestial conj unc tion; it was the day assigne d to Sebek= Saturn in conj unc tion with his mother. The festival was luni - solar; hence it was celebrated on the sixth and seventh o f the mont h, like the Sabba th of the Jews, which is repeated later on the sixth and seventh day s of the week. Now , if we start with Sunda y as the first of the mont h, the tenait festival fell on Saturday as a Sabba th of the seventh day. The second festival of Ra, that of Sunda y, was on the fifteenth of the month, which woul d be eight days after the Tenait - feast upon the seventh of the mont h. The tenait on the Saturday and a feast of the 15t h on a Sunda y show the existence of a Sabba th celebrated on Saturday, the 7th, and anot her, eight day s later, on Sunda y, the 15th of the mont h. These, how ever, were mont hly at first, as the festivals of Osiris or Ra, and not weekly, as they afterwards became with the Jews and the Christians. The festival of Saturday as the seventh day of the mont h is Jewish. The Sabba th of Sunda y, the day of Ra, is a survival of the festival celebrated on the 15t h of the mont h in ancient Egypt as the sun’ s day, or Sunda y, onc e a mont h. It was the custom at one time in Rom e for the mummy, or corpse of the dead Christ, to be exhi bited in the chur ches on Holy Thursday, the day before the Crucifixion, and if the sym bol ical corpse is not now expos ed to the publ ic gaze, the Holy Sepul chre is still exhi bited. This has the appe arance of com memoratin g two different deaths, the onl y expl anation of which is to be found in the Egypt ian mythos . Osiris was the Corpus Christi at Christmas or in the solstice. He died to be rebor n again as Horus in various phe nom ena on the third day in the moon; also from the water in his baptism; after forty days in the bur ied grain; and at the end of three months, in the Easter equi nox . In the Kamite original the night of the Last Suppe r, and of the death of Osiris, and the laying out of his body on the table of offerings ar e identical. It is the “night of provi sioni ng the altar” and the prove nde r was the mummy of the god provi ded for the mortuary meal. That was the dead Christ, or Corpus Christi (Rit., ch. 18). Holy Thur sday is especially cons ecrated by the Rom an Cathol ic C hur ch as a com memoration of the Last Suppe r and the institution of the eucharistic meal, at which the corpus of the Christ already dead was laid out to be eaten sacramentally. It is similar in the Gospels. 747 The Last Suppe r is there celebrated, and the body and blood of the Christ are there partaken of before the Crucifixion has occurred. This, in the Egypt ian original, woul d be the corpse of Osiris, the karest - mummy of him who died in the winter solstice three mont hs before the resurrection in the equi nox occurred at Easter. Seven days of mour ning for the bur ial of Osiris were also celebrated at the end of the mont h Choi ak. This was know n as the “fêtes des ténèbres,” which, according to Brugs ch, com memorated the “sept jour s qu’ il a pas sé dans le ventre de sa mère, Nût” — equi valent to Jona h being in the belly of the fish, onl y the days of darkne ss in this pha se are seven instead of three. These seven days of mour ning are the prototype of Passion week in the rubr ical usage of the Rom an Chur ch, during which the pictures of the cross (and Crucifixion) are all cove red up and veiled in darkne ss. Here the fune ral ceremony follow ed the burial of Osiris, whereas in the Christian version the fêtes des ténèbres precede the death and bur ial of the suppos ed historic vi ctim."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" According to the synopt ics, it was on the 15t h of the mont h Nisan that the Crucifixion occurred. But according to John , it was on the 14t h. These two different reckoni ngs are solar and luna r. When time was reckone d by the luna r mont h of twenty - eight days, the 14t h was the day of mid - mont h, or full moon , the day of the equi nox and of the Easter Pasch. In the luni - solar reckoni ng of thirty days to the mont h, the 15t h was the day of full moon in the equi nox . The two dates for the Crucifixion are identic al with these two pos sible dates for the equi nox . There was a fortnight , or half - moon of four teen days, and a half - mont h of fifteen days. The French fortnight is qui nze jour s, or fifteen days, and this is the fifteen - day fortnight of the Christian festival s, the Passion and the Resurrection. The 14t h Nisan was true to the luna r calculation of time, but the 15t h was also needed for the solar reckoni ng, and, as usual, the Christian founde rs have brought on bot h in aiming at the one suppos ed event. It has late ly becom e know n, from a lexicogr aphi cal tablet belongi ng to the library of Assurbanipal, that the Assyrians also kept a Sabba th (Shapatu) of the 15t h day of the month, or full moon in the luni - solar reckoni ng. Thus the crucifixion assigne d by the synopt ic s to the 15t h Nisan was according to the solar mont h, and the 14t h assigne d by John was luna r, bot h being astronom ical, and bot h impos sible as dates in hum an history. The festival of the seventh day is Jewish, and a festival of the eight h day was cont inue d by the Christians. Barnabas (Ep. 15) says, “We obs erve the eight h day with gladne ss, in which Jesus rose from the dead.” This identifies the eight h day as a Sunda y, and onl y in the Egypt ian way of celebrating the 15t h follow ing the Tenait on the seventh c an the eight h day be a Sabba th. The seventh day was Saturday, the day of Sebek. The eighth day was Sunda y, onc e a mont h, the day of Ra, and thus the eight h day became the Lord’s day in the pre - Christian religion; and the origin of bot h festivals or Sabba th s of the seventh day and of the 15t h, eight days afterwards, can be traced to the sun - god as Horus and the sun - god as Ra (Rit., ch. 113 , 7). “The ancients speak of the Passion and Resurrection Pasch as a fifteen days’ solemnity. Fifteen days (the lengt h of time) was enforced by law of 748 the empire and com mande d to the uni versal Chur ch” (Bingha m, 9, p. 95; Gieseler, Cathol ic Chur ch, sect. 53, p. 178) . Fifteen days include the week of seven days and the period of eight days. Both days – Saturday the day of Horus and Sunda y the day of Ra, as the seventh - day feast and the eight h - day Sabba th – were being celebrated as their two feast - days by the Christians in the middl e of the fifth century, and these were know n as the feasts of Saturday and of the Lord’s day, or Sunda y (Socrates, Hist. Eccles., lib. V, cap. 22, p. 234) . When Dionys ius the Areopa gite arrange d the dates for the Christian celebration of the festivals he had onl y the pre - Christian data to go upon. Both the dates and data were Egyp tian, and these had been cont inued with the calenda r and the festivals more or less correctly. But the early Christians never really kne w which was the true Sabba th, the seventh day or the eight h, so they celebrated bot h. As now demons trated, according to the record of the my stery - teachers in the astronom ical mythol ogy of Egypt the legend of a child that was bor n of a mother who was a virgin at the time is at least as old as the cons tellation in the zodi ac when the birthpl ace (in precession) coincided with the sign of Virgo so me 15,000 years ago. The virgin, in this categor y, was the godde ss"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Neith. The child was Horus - Sebek, the great fish of the inunda tion that typi fied the deliverer from drought and hunge r, and was, in other words, the saviour of the world. Thus , by aid of eq uinoc tial precession, the origin and developm ent of the Christian legend and its festivals can be scientifically traced in the pre - Christian past from the time when the virgin birth of the divine child and the house of birth were in the sign of Virgo, or i n Leo for the present pur pos e, reckone d by the move ment in precession. We shall find the virgin motherhood of Jesus, the divine sons hip of Jesus, the miracles of Jesus, the self - sacrifice of Jesus, the humanity of Jesus, the com passion of Jesus, the Sayin gs of Jesus, the resurrection of Jesus had all been ascribed in earlier ages to Iusa, or Iusu, the son of Ius ā as and of Atum - Ra. Thus Egypt was inde ed the cradle of Christianity, but not of the current delusion called “historic Christianity.” The saying at tribut ed to the Hebrew deity “out of Egypt did I call my son” was true, but in a sense undr eamt of by the Christian world. Such was the founda tion of the Jesus - legend in the astronom ical mythol ogy with Horus of the inunda tion on his papyr us, or Iusa=Atum - H orus in the zodi ac. As we shall see, not hing was adde d to the Egypt o - gnos tic “wisdom ” by the carnalizers of the Christ in Jerusalem or Rom e except the literalization of the mythos and perversion of the eschatology in a fictitious hum an history. A religion of the cross was first of all established in the mysteries of Memphi s as the cult of Ptah and his son Iu - em - hetep, otherwise Atum - Horus, who passed at Annu into Atum - Ra, the father in spirit, with Iusa, son of Ius ā as, as the ever - com ing Messianic son. We have evidence from the pyr amid of Medum that from 6,000 to 7,000 years ago the dead in Egypt were bur ied in a faith which was founde d on the mystery of the cross, and rationa lly founde d too, because that cross was a figur e of the four fold founda tion on wh ich 749 heaven itself was bui lt. The Tat - cross is a type of the eternal in Tattu. But whether as a four fold, a fivefold, or a twelvefold suppor t it was a figur e of an all - sustaining, all - renewing, all - revivifying pow er that was re - erected and religious ly besought for hope , encour agement, and succour , when the day was at the darkest and things were at the worst in phys ical nature. The sun appa rently was going out . The life of Egypt in the Nile was runni ng low and low er tow ard the desert drought . The spirit of vegetation died within itself. The rebel pow ers of evil gathered from all qua rters for the annua l conf lict, led by Apap and the Sebau in one dom ain, and by Sut and his seventy - two cons pirators in anot her. At this poi nt began the ten mysteries grouped t oge ther in the Ritual (ch. 18) . The Tat for the time being was ove rthrow n. The deity suffered, as was represented, unt o death. The heart of life that bled in every wound was no longe r felt to pul sate. The god in matter was inert and breathless. Make ye the word of Osiris truth against his enemies! Raise up the Tat, which por trayed the resurrection of the god; let the mum my - type of the eternal be onc e more erected as the mainstay and divine suppor t of all. It was thus that the pow er of salvation through Osir is - Tat was represented in the mysteries. Funda mentally the cross was astronom ical. It is a figur e of time, as much so in its way as is the clock. It is a measure of time made visible upon the scale and in the circle of the year instead of the hour .

Anot her cross is a figure of time in the winter solstice. It is a modi fied form of the Tat of Ptah on which the four qua rters are more obvi ou sly por trayed in the four arms of the pedestal. This was re - erected annua lly in the depths of the solstice where the darkne ss lasts som e sixteen hour s and the daylight onl y eight — the measure of time that is imaged by this Tat - figure of the cross. These two are now know n as the Greek and Rom an crosses, and unde r thos e two names the fact has been lost sight of that the first is a type of time in the equi nox , the other a sym bol of the winter solstice. The two crosses are scientific figur es in the astronom ical mythol ogy. They were sym bol s of mystical signi ficance in the Egyp tian eschatology: and they formed the ground plan of the Ka - chambers of King Rahetep and his wife Nefermat in the pyr amid of Medum (Petrie, Medum ). The tree was first of all a sign of susten ance when the sustainer was the Great Earth Mother; Apt in the Dom Palm, Uati in the papyr us plant, Hathor in the sycamore, or Isis in the persea - tree. On this the type of Ptah was based as the Tat - image of a pow er that sustained the uni verse. Osiris - Tat t hen typified the pow er that sustained the hum an soul in death. This was bur ied with the mum my as a fetish in the coffin, where the dead were seen to lie at rest in the eternal arms. And thus a cultus of the cross was founde d many thous and years ago. The Ch ristian doc trine of the crucifixion, with the hum an victim raised aloft as the sin - offering for all the world, is but a gha stly simulacrum of the primitive meaning: a shadow y pha ntom of the original subs tance. The doc trine had its beginni ng with an idea of up - bearing, but not in the moral dom ain. When the sky was suspende d by 750 Ptah in Amenta the act was sym bol ized by raising up the Tat - type of stability and suppor t. This not onl y sustained the sky of the nether - world, it also imaged the divine backbone of the uni verse. The Tat, was a figur e of the pol e and the four corners, which uni ted in one the “five suppor ts” or fivefold tree of the Egyp to - gnos tic mystery ( Pistis Sophi a, B. 1, 1 - 3). Otherwise stated, it was a sym bol of the pow er that sustained the h eavens with the suppor ting pol e and the arms of the four qua rters. This pow er was personi fied in Ptah as well as figured in the Tat. Hence the god is seen within the type as Ptah - Sekari or the later Asar - Tat. Then the type of the eternal is the eternal’s o wn self: the pow er that sustains the uni verse in very person who is Ptah in one cult, Osiris in the other. The supe rincum bent weight and pressure on the sustaining pow er is proba bly indi cated by the sque lched face and com pressed features of the Osiris - Tat (Wilkinson, Ancient Egyptians , vol . 3, pl. 25) . The sustaining pow er within the Tat woul d make the god and the cross to be one as they are in the Osiris Tat. The deceased arises from the tom b as the Tat. He says “I am Tat, the son of Tat” (Rit., ch. 1), or of the eternal who establishes the soul for eternity in the mystery of Tattu (Rit., ch. 17) . Hence the figure of a god extende d crosswise as the sustainer of the universe coul d be equi valent to the cross. The Hindu figur e of Witoba , for example, is por tra yed in space as the Crucified without the cross (Moor ’s Hindu Pant heon ). On the other hand, the Swastika is a form of the cross without the crucified. In the Christian Iconog raphy, as Didron show s, Christ and the cross are identical, as were Horus and the Tat.

When the Tat was annua lly ove rthrow n it was raised again by the upl ifting pow er of the god represented by the Son as the sign of resurrection. Thus the genesis of the legend of the cross, lik e to that of the Christ, can be traced in Egypt to the cult of Ptah at Memphi s, where the religion of the cross originated; and to Annu or On, where it was cont inue d in the cult of Atum - Ra with Iu - em - hetep as the Egypt ian Jesus. This, as we show , was Iusa the Jew - God brought out of Egypt by the Ius or Aius, or when the name is spelt with the letter J, by the Jews. For 13,000 years has Iu the Egypt ian Jew been com ing astronom ically as Iu the Su or Iu - sa, the son of Atum, or rather as Atum manifesting in the person of the son. For 13, 000 years he has been the bringe r of good - will and peace and plenty to the world in accordance with the meanings of his title, Iu - em - hetep. And as this Jesus is the ever - com ing - one who is always figur ed one foot before the other a nd best foot foremost in the act of com ing, never - hasting never - halting, and as Iu is the Jew we see in this wande rer of eternity with no rest for the sole of his foot through all the cycles of time, the original personi fication of him who lives in later l egend as the “Wande ring Jew.” 751 How often has it been conf idently declared that the idea of a divine fatherhood was introduc ed into the world som e time after A.D. by an historical Jesus; whereas it is a matter of scientific demons tration that the doc t rine was established in the cult of Ptah, and perfected in the religion of Atum - Ra; in bot h of which Iusa or Jesus was the ever - com ing son as demons trator for the eternal in the sphe re of time. The doc trine of a future life, or in mode rn phrase, the immor tality of the soul , was also taught at Memphi s many thous and years ago unde r at least four different figur es of the re - arising human spirit. One of these was the Apis called “the second life of Ptah”; one the Scarabæ us termed “the old one who becom es young ”; a third was the Hawk of soul emerging from the mortal mum my; and a four th Iu - em - hetep, as the type of an eternal child. Until the time of Ptah, the Totemic type s prevailed in the Egypt ian astronom ical mythol ogy. There was onl y the Great Mother, in seve ral characters, with her children, the same as in Totemism. But when the fatherhood was founde d in Ptah his predecessors were designa ted his children. We learn from a hierogl yphi c inscription on the temple of Iu - em - hetep at Philæ that he was called “the gr eat one , son of Ptah, the creative god, made by Tanen (a title of Ptah), begot ten by him, the god of divine forms, who giveth life to all men.” On one line of developm ent he became the father - god as Atum - Ra at Heliopol is; on the other he was God the son as Atum - Horus or Iu - em - hetep, he who com es with peace or rest. Christian ignor ance not withstandi ng the Gnos tic Jesus is the Egypt ian Horus who was cont inue d by the various sects of gnos tics unde r bot h the names of Horus and of"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Jesus. In the gnos tic iconogr a phy of the Rom an Catacom bs child - Horus reappe ars as the mum my - babe who wears the solar disc. The roya l Horus is represented in the cloak of roya lty, and the pha llic emblem found there witnesses to Jesus being Horus of the resurrection. The resurrection of Osiris, the mum my - god, is reproduc ed in the Rom an Catacom bs as the raising of Lazarus. Amongs t the num erous type s of Horus repeated in Rom e as sym bol s of the alleged “historic” Jesus are “Horus on his papyr us” as the Messianic shoot or natzer; Horus the br anch of endless ages as the vine; Horus as Ichthus , the fish; Horus as the bennu or phœ nix; Horus as the dove ; Horus as the eight - rayed star of the Plerom a; Horus the Scarabæ us; Horus as the child - mum my with the head of Ra; Horus as the black child, or Bam bino; Horus, of the triangl e (reversed) ( Lapi dar ian Gallery of the Vatican, Lundy, p. 92) . Horus in his resurrection betwixt the two trees; Horus attende d by the two divine sisters, or two wom en; Horus as the lion of the doubl e force; Horus as S erapis; these and others were reproduc ed as Egyp to - gnos tic by gnos tic artists in illustration of Egyp to - gnos tic tenets, doc trines, and dogm as. The Catacom bs of Rom e are crow ded with the Egypt o - gnos tic type s which had served to Rom an, Persian, Greek, and Je w as evidence for the non - historic origins of Christianity. To Marcion of Pont us, for 752 example, the epicene Serapis woul d represent the soul of both sexes which was the non - historical Egypt o - gnos tic Christ. Horus of the inun dation brings the fish and grapes for the Uaka festival (“Called Christ as a Fisherman,” Lundy, fig. 54) . Horus still issues from the mum my as the young sun - god with the head of Ra, the same as in the Ritual. The soul of Ra still issues from the sepul chre as the phœ nix=bennu; and Os iris com es forth at the call of Horus from the tom b. Amsu still rises from betwixt the trees of Nut and Hathor as the good shephe rd with the lamb upon his shoul der, wearing the cloak of roya lty, and carrying the panpi pes in his hand as a figur e of the All - one , that is, as Horus of the resurrection. Doubl e Horus, as the child of the virgin and the son of God the Father, is por trayed in bot h his characters as the heir of Seb, god of earth, and the heir of Ra, the father in heaven. As the heir of Seb he is sea ted on a throne that is suppor ted on the head of an aged man, who represents the god of earth (“Sarcopha gus of Juni us Bassus,” Lundy, fig. 41) . As the heir of Ra he is enthrone d in heaven, or on a figur e of heaven (Nut), as Horus divinized (Lundy , fig. 42; Didron, figs. 18 and 66) . The ox and the ass which appe ar in the Rom an Catacom bs with the worshippe rs of the new - bor n infant are witnesses for Iusa, and not for an historical Jesus. Iusa in Egypt had been represented by bot h the ass and the ox, or the sho rt - hor ned bul lock, in the cult of Atum - Ra at On. In a sculptured sarcopha gus of the fourth century, the three Magi are offering gifts to the divine infant, or mum my - child. These, according to their caps, are Zoroastrians. They are worshippe rs, how ever, of the risen Christ. Only the risen one in this case is Mithra, son of the sun, and not the Jewish Jesus. The story of Jesus riding on two asses, or on an ass and the foal of an ass, in the trium pha l procession to Jerusalem also show s that he was one with Ius a, the Egypt ian Jesus. It has been sugge sted that the Gospel narrative was derived"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"from the Greek tradition of Dionys ius riding on two asses. But it is of incom parably greater likelihood that it was derived from the Hebrew prophe cy being conve rted into an historical event. Either way, there was one origin for bot h in the Egypt ian mythical representation. As already show n, Iu, the ass in ancient Egypt , was a type of Atum - Ra, and his son Iusa in the Kamite mythos . It was a zootype of the swift - goe r where ther e was no hor se, and bearer of the solar god who was Atum in the two characters of the father and the son, the old one and the young one , or, in sign - langua ge, the ass and the foal of the ass, upon which the Messu, or Messiah rode , in com ing up to day from Amenta. Iusa is por trayed with asses’ ears. Iu is both the ass and the god unde r one name, and if not por trayed as riding on an ass, or, according to the Märchen, on two asses, he is represented by the ass with the solar disc upon his head, at the sides of which are the two ears of an ass. According to Lefébur e “he seems to raise himself by means of a rope ” (“Book of Hades,” Records of the Past, v. 10, 130) . Thus , and in no other way, the yout hful sun - god rode upon the ass as Iusa or as “Horus with the roya l count enance,” cons idered as the son of Ra ( ib., p. 131) . The twin - lions form anot her tell - tale type . Ciampini says two lions used to be statione d at the door s of ancient chur ches and basilicas in Italy, not as mere ornaments, but for some mystical signi f ication ( Vet. Mon. I. C. , 3, p. 35). As Egypt ian, the type is as old 753 as the Kherefu, which were statione d in the sign of Leo at our poi nt of beginni ng in the Jesus - legend where Iusa was bor n as Atum - Horus, the lion - faced, suppor ted by the two lions o n the ecliptic, which imaged the doubl e force of the young sun - god com ing in the strengt h and glory of the father, Atum - Ra, whether suppor ted by the two lions or riding on the ass. Thus the two lions suppos ed to be gua rding the door s of the chur ch in Rom e were at that time gua rding the doubl e - door s of the hor izon, through which the solar god came forth at Easter in the equi nox . Naturally it was for mythical not for historical reasons that the child - Christ remained a starrily - bejewelled blackamoor as the ty pical healer in Rom e. Jesus, the divine healer, doe s not retain the black com plexion of Iu - em - hetep in the canoni cal Gospels, but he doe s in the Chur ch of Rom e when represented by the little black bambino. A jewelled image of the child - Christ as a blackamo or is sacredly preserved at the headqua rters of the Franciscan order, and true to its typi cal character as a sym bol ical likeness of Iusa the healer, the little black figur e is still taken out in state, with its regalia on, to visit the sick, and demons trat e the suppos ed healing pow er of this Egypt ian Æsculapius thus Christianized. The virgin mother, who was also black, survived in Italy as in Egypt . At Oropa , near Bietta, the Madonna and her child - Christ are not white but black, as they so often were in Ita ly of old, and as the child is yet condi tione d in the little black Jesus of the eternal city. According to local tradition the image of the black bambino was carved at Jerusalem out of the root of a tree from the mount of Olives. This suppl ies anot her illu stration of Egyp tian origin. In the solar mythos the divine babe rises from the emerald tree of dawn. In the Ritual he issues from the Asru - tree (ch. 42) . But unde r one Egyp tian type the tree of dawn is the bakhu or olive - tree, the “son of oil,” from which the solar light was bor n. Hence mount Bakhu, the solar birthpl ace, is the mount of Olives, and the infant bor n from the tree of dawn was represented by the image carved"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"out of the tree upon mount Olivet. In this, as in unnum bered other instances, the myth os lives obs curely in the legend which is still capable of reconve rsion. The cult of the child who was black is further illustrated at the festivals of the Bambino in Rom e, when sermons are preached from the pul pit by “the mout hs of babes and sucklings .” T here is a little black dol l in the hierogl yphi cs which is a determinative of the word “men” to be conc ealed. This appe ars alongs ide of Atum as variant to the Ankh - sym bol of life, and is very sugge stive of the little black bambino as a figure of child - Horus in his darkne ss, or Iu - em - hetep in Amenta. From this standpoi nt it is pos sible to see how it came to pass that the Jew - God coul d have a son born to him with a black com plexion, and thus account for the black Jesus that is worshippe d in the cult of papal R om e. Surely the profounde st sigh of an ever - warring world went up to heaven in the cult of Iu - em - hetep, who was worshippe d as the giver of rest, the Kamite prince of peace. The bringe r of peace was the giver of rest to the weary; the word hetep having both meanings . From the time of the fifth dyna sty the Egypt ian dead were buried “em - hetep” or “In pac e” in the great resting - place of Amenta. This giver of rest was the leader of his follow ers into the kingdom of rest, 754 where they reigne d with him in the glory of the father. In one of the sayings of Jesus, or Iu - em - hetep, “Jesus saith” of him who seeks, “Astoni shed he (the seeker) shall reach the kingdom , and having reached the kingdom he shall rest” (“New Sayings of Jesus”). It is also said in the Gospel according to the Hebrews, “He that wonde rs shall reach the kingdom , and having reached the kingdom he shall rest.” “The prom ise of Christ (or Jesus) is great and wonde rful and rest in the kingd om to com e and life eternal” (Clement II, Epis. v. 5). And in t he Acts of Thom as it is said that “they who worthily partake of the goods of this world have rest, and in rest shall they reign. ” Iu - em - hetep is portrayed as the yout hful sage and precocious teacher. He is the “heir of the temple,” depicted as the teacher in the temple; the boy of twelve years who wears the skul l - cap of wisdom , and sits in the seat of learning. He hol ds a papyr us on his kne e and is in the act of unr olling it for his discour se. This is he who persona ted the divine Word in hum an form as the wise and wondr ous child of whom the tales of the infancy were told. Hence he was the mythical teacher, and reput ed author of the “Sayings ” and writer of the Books of Wisdom . But it cannot even be pretende d that any historic persona ge named Jesus, alleged t o have been bor n into the world in the year one , or four, of the present era, coul d have been the author of “the wisdom of Jesus” in the Apoc rypha . But there is the book , and there is the name to be account ed for. In the “New Sayings of Jesus,” found at Ox yrhync hus , it is said in the ope ning paragraph, “These are the words (or logoi ) which Jesus the living spake to . . . and Thom as, and he said unto (them) ‘Every one that hearkens to these words shall never taste of death.’” And this is the com mon formula i n the rubr ical directions of the Ritual. For example, the 64t h chapter is to be recited in order that “the soul of the person may not die a second time” or may not suffer the second death. It is also said of ch. 20, “Let the person say this chapter and he will com e forth by day after death, and escape from the fire.” These are the words of life that deliver the soul from second death in Amenta. Of chapter 70 it is said, “If this scripture is know n upon earth he will com e forth by day (from the dead) and wal k among"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"the living. His name will be uni njured for ever.” By means of ch. 180 the manes takes the form of a living soul . In truth one half of the Ritual cons ists of the magical words of pow er that save a soul from the dreaded second death; the rest describ e the way of salvation toge ther with the transformations and trials which have to be unde rgone in the cour se of working it out. Iu - em - hetep was pre - eminently the divine healer, the medicine - man amongs t the Egyp tian gods . He was the good phys ician of soul s as well as the healer of bodi ly disease. He was the caster - out of evil demons , the giver of sleep and rest to sufferers in pain. Æsculapius was a Greek version of Iu - em - hetep, “the great son of Ptah.” The Greeks called his temple near the city of Memphi s “ The Æsculapion. ” “Unde r the Ptolemies a small temple was bui lt in honour of Iu - em - hetep on the island of Philæ”; and a Greek version of the hierogl yphi c 755 inscription was placed ove r the door by the com mand of Ptolemy V (Budge , Gods of Eg., vol . I, p. 23). Iu - em - hetep is not mentione d by name in the “Book of the Dead,” but it is said to the deceased in “the Ritual of Embalmment” “thy soul uni teth itself to Iu - em - hetep, whilst thou art in the fune ral valley,” where he takes the name of Horus as lord of t he resurrection. The cult of Iu - em - hetep was eclipsed or much obs cured by the Osirian religion. In fact Iu - em - hetep was but a title of him who was the bringe r of peace and good luck, and who was Atum - Horus as the son of Ptah; hence Iu - em - hetep is far bett er know n as Horus the son of Osiris. Nevertheless, this cult of Iusa the child, the little hero sayer and healer, had a remarkable recrude scence and a cons iderable increase in Saitic and Greek times. We find that a temple was erected for his worship at @Sa kka ra between the Serapeum and the village of Abus ir. This is near enough in time to help in establishing a link betwixt the Egyp tian Iusa and the Jesus of the Gospels, who was brought on from Memphi s as Iu the Sa or son of Ptah, to Annu as Iu the ever - com ing sa or son of Atum - Ra, thence to Alexandr ia as Iu - em - hetep, and to Greece as Imuthes, or Æsculapius, the god of healing there as he had been in Egypt , and to Rom e as Jesus the Egypt o - gnos tic Christ. In the transition from the old Egypt ian religion to t he new cult of Christianity there was no factor of profounde r importance than the worship of Serapis. As the Emperor Hadrian relates, in his well - know n letter to Servianus , “thos e who worship Serapi s are likewise Christian s; even thos e who style themselves the Bishops of Christ are devoted to Serapi s.” The very Patriarch himself (Tiberias, head of the Jewish religion) , when he com es to Egypt , is forced by som e to ador e Serapis, by others to worship Christ. “There is but one God for them all.” Clearly this w as but a difference in type and title. According to inscriptions at the Serapeum of Memphi s, the ancient Egypt ian Serapis was bor n of the Virgin Mother, when she was represented by the sacred heifer — a far earlier type than the mystical hum an Virgin. Serapi s was “the second life of Ptah. ” Hence, as Diodor us says (I. 25) , Serapis was a name given to all persons after their death or in their resurrection. Prehistoric Christianity was founde d, as Egypt ian, on the resurrection of the hum an soul from the deaf an d dum b, the blind and impot ent inertia imaged in death, and its com ing forth to day as demons trated by the reappe arance of the eidol on or doubl e of"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"the dead. The Egypt o - gnos tic Christ onl y existed in the spirit as a spirit or a god. Their Christ was repres ented by the supe rhum an type s of the risen mum my; the eight - rayed star of the plerom a; the divine hawk; the mystical dove ; the sacred beetle; the lion, fish or lamb; not by the man in an indi vidua l form of historic persona lity. That is why there is no por t rait of the man Christ - Jesus. There is no hum an por trait for the reason that there was no man. T HE J ESUS - L EGEND IN R OME . Before it coul d be for the first time unde rstood, the story out lined so elusively in the canoni cal Gospels had to be retold in accor dance 756 with the astronom ical mythol ogy, and more especially in terms of the Osirian eschatology. The legend was so ancient in Egypt that in the time of Amen - hetep, a Pharaoh of the 18t h dyna sty, it was hum anly appl ied to his child and to his cons ort M ut - em - Ua in the character of the divine wom an, the mother who, like Neith, was ever - virgin. A passage and a picture from the “Natural Genesis” (vol . II, p. 398) may be repeated here. The story of the Annunc iation, the miraculous conc eption (or incarnation) , the birth and the ador ation of the Messianic infant had already been engr aved in stone and represented in four cons ecutive scenes upon the innermost walls of the hol y of hol ies (the Meskhe n) in the temple of Luxo r (which was bui lt by Amen - hetep III. abou t 1700 B.C. , or som e seventeen centuries before the events depicted are com monl y suppos ed to have taken place. In these scenes the maiden que en Mut - em - Ua, the mother of Amen - hetep, her future child, impersona tes the virgin - mother, who conc eived and brought forth without the fatherhood. The Annunciation, Co nception, Birth, and Adoration of the Ch ild. The first scene on the left hand show s the god Taht, as divine word or logos , in the act of hailing the virgin que en and announc ing to her that she is to giv e birth to the com ing son. (That is, to bring forth the roya l Repa in the character of Horus or Aten, the divine heir.) In the second scene the ram - headed god Kneph, in conj unc tion with Hathor , gives life to her. This is the Holy Ghos t or spirit that cause s conc eption, Neph being the spirit by nature and by name. Impregna tion and conc eption are appa rent in the virgin’s fuller form. Next, the mother is seated on the midw ife’s stool , and the child is suppor ted in the hands of one of the nurses. The four th sce ne is that of the Ador ation. Here the infant is enthrone d, receiving hom age from the gods and gifts from men. Behind the deity, who represents the hol y spirit, on the right three men are kne eling offering gifts with the right hand, and life with the left. The child thus announc ed, incarnated, bor n and worshippe d was the 757 Pharaoni c representative of the Aten - sun or child - Christ of the Aten - cult, the miraculous conc eption of the ever - virgin mother imaged by Mut - em - Ua. (The scenes were copi ed by"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Sharpe fr om the temple at Luxor .) Thus the divine drama was represented hum anly by the roya l lady who persona ted the mother of God, with her child in this particular religion. And here a dogm a of “historic persona lity” may be seen in the germ. Inde ed, when the Pha raoh first assum ed the vesture of divinity and a doc trine of historic persona lity for the Messiah coul d be and was established, Ra was the representative of God the Father and the Repa was a type of God the Son, as heir - appa rent for the eternal. The father was the ever - living and the son the ever - com ing one . These, in the cult of Annu, were Atum - Ra the father, and Iusa, the Egyptian Jesus, the com ing son. The eternal existence of the father was thus demons trated by the ever - com ing of the son. These divine c haracters of the Ra and Repa, so to say, had becom e historical in Usertsen First according to a record of the twelfth dyna sty. In this the king says of his God, the doubl e Har - makhu, “I am a king of his ow n making, a mona rch long - living, not by the Father. He exalted me as lord of both parts; as an infant not yet gone forth; as a yout h not yet com e from my mother’s wom b.” This was in the character of the unbe got ten Horus, the Virgin’s child, who had no father ( Records, vol . 12, pp. 53 - 4), and who as Har - mak hu was earlier than God the Father, Ra. We learn from a still older doc um ent that the Son of God may be said to have becom e historical in Egypt early in the fifth dyna sty; that is, as the Son of Ra. The earlier Pharaohs were not the sons of Ra, they were H orus - kings . The “Son of Ra” then gave historic persona lity to the god who was first imaged in the hum an form of Atum - Iu. Thenceforth the Repa, or heir - apparent, was the representative of that ever - com ing son who was the child of Ius ā as in the cult of Annu, and who was, in fact, the Egypt ian Jesus or Iusa, the com ing son in historic persona lity as the roya l representative of Ra. Anot her version of the ancient legend that was at lengt h conve rted into Christian history has recently been discove red in Egypt . T his was written in Demotic, but how ever late the copy, the internal evidence show s that it is an Egypt ian folk - tale cont aining matter of the inde finitely more ancient mythos . That is the all - impor tant poi nt. The story is told of one Si - Osiris, the son of K hamuas, a famous high priest of Ptah at Memphi s who was head of the hierarchy of his time, about 1250 B.C. The tale of Khamuas, so far as it goe s, is a perfect parallel to the story of the marvellous child that is told in the Gospels, canoni cal or apoc ryph al, which cont ain som e portions of the mythos reduc ed to the status of the Märchen. There was one origin for all — that is, Egypt ian. The mythos is the parent of the Märchen, and the uni ty of the Märchen is traceable to the Egypt ian mythol ogy and eschatology — there, and now here else. It is the story that had been dramatized and narrated by the Egypt ians during many thous and years in the cult of Ptah - Sekari at Memphi s; of Aten and of Atum - Iu at Annu, and of Osiris in Egypt generally. Only minds com pletely craze d or fatally conf used 758 by the current Christom ania woul d suppos e that the details of the story, which is as old at least as the cult of Ptah in Memphi s, were derived from the “historic” version that was canoni zed at last as Christian. The Ritual is a permanent reply to all such false assum ptions . At least the “Book of the Dead” is not a forgery of pos t - Christian gnos tics."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" The folk - tale here is told of Si - Osiris, son of Setme - Khamuas, who was incarnated as the hum an representative of Horus the divine. It is said of Horus, son of Pa - neshe, “he being in the shape of Si - Osiris made an effort of written magic against the man of Ethiopi a.” Moreove r, this Horus com es up from Amenta on pur pos e to cont end against the black art of Hor, son of the negress, and in doi ng this assum es the shape of the hum an Si - Osiris. As the translator remarks, “the end of the story show s that Si - Osiris is really Horus, son of Pa - neshe, who had obt ained leave from Osiris to revisit the earth.” Setme - Khamuas, the son of Pharaoh Mer - m a - ra (King Rameses II) took to wife his sister Meh - wesekht , whom he love d devout ly, but they had no child, and their hearts were grieved because of it. The childless wife is spoke n with one night, by supe rhum an visitants, in a dream. They tell her (or wor ds are spoke n to the effect) that she shall conc eive and bear a child. Khamuas, her hus band, is also informed in a dream that his cons ort, who is called his sister, just as Isis is the sister of Osiris, has conc eived and will bear a son. “The child that wi ll be bor n, he (shall be named) Si - Osiris (Osiris’ son) ; many are the marvels that he shall do in the land of Egyp t” (Griffith, Stories, p. 43). Meh - wesekht is told that she will find a melon - vine, which shall be to her for medicine, and she is to give of it to Khamuas. Then “she lay dow n by her hus band and she conc eived seed of him” ( Stories, p. 43) . In this account of conc eption the melon - plant, its gour d or its flow er, takes the place of the papyr us, lotus or lily presented to Isis the virgin and to Mar y. This is referred to after his birth by the child Si - Horus, who, in speaking of his com ing forth, says, “I grew as that melon - vine, with the intent of returning to the body again that I might be bor n into the world” for a purpos e various ly described in t he different texts. In this he becom es incarnate to com bat the pow er and influence of evil in the form of black magic ( Stories, pp. 43 - 65) . Si - Osiris is really Horus, the son of Osiris in Amenta. This he leaves to visit earth and becom e the son of Meh - wese kht , the sister and cons ort of Khamuas. He says, “I prayed before Osiris in Amenta to let me com e forth to the world again. It was com mande d before to let me forth into the world. I awoke ; I flew right up, to find Setme, the son of Pharaoh, upon the Gebel of On and the Gebel of Memphi s, the place of burial in the desert.” Si - Osiris, like Jesus in the “history,” has the pow er of sudde nly becom ing invi sible; as it is said, “Si - Osiris passed away as a shade or spirit out from the land of Pharaoh and Setme, his father, nor did they see him” ( Stories, p. 65) . Like the young Jesus in the Gospel (Luke II. 40) , the child grew and waxed strong. The exact words are, “The child grew big; he waxed strong; he was sent to the school . He rivalled the scribe that had been a ppoi nted to teach him.” “The child, son 759 of Osiris, began to speak with the scribes of the House of Life (in the temple of Ptah); all who heard him were lost in wonde r at him” ( Stories, p. 44) . “Now when the roya l Si - Osiris had attained the age of twe lve years it came to pass that there was no good scribe (or learned man) that rivalled him in Memphi s in reading or in writing that com pels”; that is, in uttering the Ur - hekau or mystical words of great magical pow er. As the translator remarks, it is curio us to find that lingui stically the tale is som ewhat closely related to the new Egypt ian of the twelfth century B.C. ; that is, to the time of Khamuas, one of the chief characters, as the date of the original doc um ent."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" But not onl y in Egypt was the divine h ero, the Prince of Eternity, represented by the roya l child bor n heir - appa rent to the throne . It was the same in Rom e. For instance, the birthda y of Augus tus Cæsar was hailed in Rom e as that of the Messianic Prince of Peace. In a well - preserved Greek inscr iption of eighty - four lines, in which an ancient account is given of the introduction of the Julian calenda r on the birthda y of the Emperor Cæsar Augus tus, September 23r d, it is written: — “On this day [ i.e., the birthday of Augustus] the world has been g iven a different aspect.

That Providence which presides over the destinies of all living creatures has fitted this man for the salvation of humanity with such gifts that he has been sent to us and to coming generati ons as a saviour. He will put an end to all strife and will restore all things gloriously. In his appearance, all the hopes of the ancestors have been fulfilled. He has not only surpassed all former benefactors of mankind, but it is impossible that a great er than he should ever come. The birthday of this god [ i.e., Augustus ] has brought out the good news of great joy based upon him. From his birth a new era must begin.” The Egypt ian Repa or the Rom an Cæsar was enacting on this earth, appr oxi mately, the ch aracter assigne d to the son of God in the Egyp to - gnos tic mysteries. The world woul d have been doo med to destruction but for the rebirth in time of the Messu or Messiah, the Repa or divine heir, who represented the eternal as the child, the ever - com ing prin ce of peace, who is also imaged as the living link which conne cts and uni tes the past and future in the present, by means of him who became the representative of the deity on earth, whether in Egypt or in Rom e, in India or Japan (Rit., ch. 42, 4, 5). But t he man whos e com ing change d the world, and saved it by renewal, was mythical, and his adve nt was æoni an from age to age, unde r whatsoever name. Thus , in Rom e the Emperor Augus tus persona lized the com ing prince of peace in an historical character. The repe tition of this as Christian legend in the Gospels is no mere replica of “heathen” sentiments, images, type s, and phr ases. It is a reproduc tion of the Egypt ian astronom ical mythol ogy and eschatology in the disgui se of a pretende d history. In Egypt the Phar aoh and his son for ages had represented Ra and 760 the Repa, the divine heir - appa rent or the prince. As Egypt ian the fatherhood and sons hip of the one god were founde d on the Pharaoh and the heir - appa rent, the Ra and Repa, who cons tituted the King that never died. The son of God was bor n as manifestor for the eternal, and the ruler as Pharaoh, emperor or king, was the earthly representative of the God with whos e divinity the new historical ruler was inve sted as the Anoi nted, the Repa, the Prince, the Cæs ar, the Mikado, the Cyrus, or the Christ. This birth of the eternal in time was astronom ical. But it was hum anized for the birthda y of Amen - hetep in Egypt , for Alexande r in Greece, and for Cæsar - Augus tus in Rom e before the era that was designa ted Christian . The virgin - mother in mythol ogy, and there never was any other, is she who made her proclamation in the Temple of Neith at Sais that she proceeded from herself and bor e the child without her peplum being lifted by the male. The myth reflects"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"the matriarch ate from a time when the fatherhood was not yet indi vidua lized. The mother with child, the great or enceinte mother, is at the head of the Kamite Pantheon as the mother of life and a figur e of fecundi ty. This type of the mother and child retains its pos iti on in the Christian iconogr aphy when the child Jesus, like Kheper, is exhi bited in the Virgin’s wom b surrounde d by the seven spirits as dove s (Didron) . The mother with her child in utero or in her arms was inde finitely earlier than the typi cal father and s on whos e worshippe rs were oppos ed to the more primitive representation of nature. Horus, at first, is the child of Isis onl y, with Seb as put ative or foster - father, who was not the begetter. Thus the mother might remain a virgin. Horus, the child, was an image of the god, made flesh in hum an gui se. He is the mortal Horus, very imperfect, som etimes sight less, at others a crippl e, but divine; the divine victim in a hum an shape, which was now the manifesting mask of the deity or supe rhum an pow er, instead of t he totemic zoot ype . And naturally the divine child thus hum anly featured invol ved the mother of the god in a hum an effigy. The child assigne d to the earth - father Seb= Joseph is Horus up to twelve years of age, and then he passes from the mortal sphere. A v irgin mother in the ancient wisdom is she who was fecunda ted by her ow n child as bul l of the mother in the moon , in the earth, or in other phe nom ena that were at first entirely non - hum an. But the doc trine survived when the divinized mother and her child we re rende red anthropom orphi cally. Thus the gnos tic Jesus in the Pistis Sophi a says, “I found Mary, who is called my mother, after the material body; I implanted in her the first pow er which I had received from the hands of Barbêlô, and I planted in her the pow er which I had received from the hands of the great, the good Sabaoth” (Mead, B. 1, 13) . That is in the character of the mythical child who fecunda tes his ow n mother. And here the ove rshadow ing of Mary by “the pow er of the Most High” (Luke I. 35) is sug gestive of anot her ove rshadow ing of the Virgin who conc eives. This is described in the magic papyr us ( Records of the Past, vol . 10, p. 141) as a “conc ealment” of the mother in the process of generation. “On Horror’s head hor rors accum ulate” in manuf acturi ng history from the mythos . Horus, the fatherless, was the fecunda tor of his ow n virgin mother, but neither as the hum an Horus nor the divine 761 Horus was it presented that he was other than the typi cal figur e in a mystery, or that the doc trine came the hum an way. Jesus in the same character, called the Mamzer rzmm by the Jews, is the same fatherless fecunda tor of the virgin mother when the two are Jew and Jewess. To the truly religious sense this is a most profane parody of the sacred Osirian drama. Thu s the fragm ents of a great com plex in dogm a and doc trine were collected toge ther in relation to the conc eption of the Messianic child. First, the virgin mother was the insufflator of a soul . Secondl y, there is a begettal in which the offspring fecunda tes t he mother — this of cour se is in the mythical representation. Thirdly, according to Matthew, the divine child was either conc eived or begot ten of the Holy Ghos t. It is the type that tells so many secrets of the non - historical beginni ngs : and not hing has bee n bot tom ed, not hing coul d be fund amentally expl ained with the Egypt o - gnos tic wisdom still unknow n. The dove that laid the egg is pre - eminent as a type in the"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"conc eption and the birth of Jesus. At first the insufflating spirit of life, whether called hol y o r not, was female. This was demons trated by the Mother - nature. In the Gospels the Holy Spirit as female suffices for the miraculous conc eption of the child - Jesus who is generated without a father. But Pistis Sophi a witnesses that the gnos tic Jesus proceede d from the father in the likeness of a dove . And that the mystery of all mysteries, the first and final mystery, was this of the dove , cons idered to be the bird of God the Father. By this means the Holy Spirit is por trayed as male, whereas according to the secret wisdom the dove had been a female type of spirit from the first. The gnos is was so ancient as Egypt ian that the dove had been succeeded by the hawk as the bird of Ra, the Holy Spirit as male. The hawk was now the sym bol of the father and the son, t hat is, of Ra and Horus. Whereas the dove as mother - bird was primary. The female nature of the mystic dove is also show n by its co - type the pigeon, still employe d in mode rn slang as a survival of sign - langua ge. Thus the earliest hum an soul was insufflated by the mother, and the mother divinized was represented by the Dove , the bird of soul when soul was first attribut ed to female sour ce. Lastly, the same bird was given to the Holy Spirit as God the Father, and as a type of the Trinity cons isting of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, with the mother veiled and hidde n by the dove . It may be noted in passing that the dove was not necessarily a type of sensual desire although it became associated with Venus in Greece. There was not hing licentious in Hathor or Ius ā as. The earliest Venus was a personi fication of the enceinte mother, not a godde ss Lubr icity provoc ative of lust, but in all simplicity and serious ness a type of tende rest maternity. The dove had been the bird of Hathor as the insufflator of a soul of breath. In this character it is por trayed with broodi ng wings extende d on the bos om of the mum my as quickener of the spirit for a future life. On the tom b of Rameses IX the dove appe ars in place of the hawk as a co - type of Horus at the prow of the solar boa t. Also , in a statuette of the 19t h dyna sty there is a hum an - headed dove which takes the place of the hawk as a zoot ype of the soul . It is seen hove ring ove r the bos om of a mum my. The divine Horus rises again in the form of a dove , as well as in the shape of a ha wk. “I am the 762 Dove: I am the Dove,” exclaims the risen spirit as he soars up from Amenta, where the egg of his future being was hatched by the divine incuba tor (Rit., 86, 1). Here the bird of Hathor is also the bird of Ra, and thus the dove became th e bird of the Holy Spirit, female in the mother, and male in the divine child Horus, and finally in the Father. In the Counc ils of Nice and Cons tantinopl e, the fathers conde mned Xenor a, who derided the imaging of the Holy Spirit by the dove . And to show ho w the type will persist, in The Cathol ic Layman for July 17t h, 1856 , there is a Papal picture of the Christian Godhe ad that was extant in that same year, as the trinity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. In this, God the Father and God the Son are represe nted as a man with two heads, one body and two arms. One of the heads is like the ordinary pictures of Jesus, or Serapis, the other is the head of an old man surmount ed by a triangl e. Out of the middl e of this figur e is proceeding the Holy Ghos t in the for m of a dove ( Cathol ic Layman, July 17th, 1856) . The dove , then, as an emblem of the Holy Spirit, also show s the gnos tic nature of the beginni ngs in the Gospels termed Canoni cal. “Now the birth of the Christ was on this wise. When his Mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came toge ther"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"she was found with child of the Holy Ghos t,” or, as rende red in sign - langua ge, with the dove as emblem of the Holy Spirit. Hence, in the Iconogr aphy, child - Jesus is represented in the Virgin’s arms or wom b, su rrounde d by the seven dove s as sym bol s of the Holy Spirit (Didron, fig. 124) . We might say that the dove of Hathor - Ius ā as came to Rom e on boa rd the papyr us - boa t, in which the mother Isis crossed the swamps to save her little one from the pur suing dragon (Plutarch, Of Isis and Osiris, 18) . For the papyr us - boa t is obvi ous ly the bark of Peter in the Rom an Catacom bs (Lundy , Mont. Christ, fig. 139 ). Ius ā as, the mother of Iusa=Iusu, the Egypt ian Jesus, was a form of Hathor - Meri, and was brought on in the cult of Rom e as Mary, the mystical dove and mother of Iusu, now believed to have beco me historical. A dove cote was the dw elling where she brought him forth in Rom e. As Cypr ien Robe rt says, “The first basilicas, placed generally upon eminences, were called dom us colum bæ , dw ellings of the dove , that is, the Holy Ghos t” (Didron, 1, 439, Eng. tr.). Now Atum was the hol y spirit in the eschatology of Annu; the first who ever did attain that status in theology . His cons ort was Ius ā as, who, in the character of Hathor , was the female hol y spirit, as the dove . Their child was Iusa, the Egypt ian Jesus. Thi s was he who says, on rising from Amenta as a spirit, “I am the dove , I am the dove ” (The “Menat.” Rit., ch. 86) . Thus , the gnos tic mystery of the dove is traceable to Atum as the hol y spirit, and to Ius ā as - Hathor as the Mother of the Com ing Son (Iusa), he who emanated from them as the dove . This mode of incarnation is follow ed by a second descent of the hol y spirit in the baptism of Jesus. “Lo, the heavens were ope ned unt o him, and he saw the Spirit of God descendi ng as a dove , and com ing upon him; and lo, a voice out of the heavens saying, This is my belove d son in whom I am well pleased.” Thus , the child that was conc eived of the virgin in the first descent of the spirit is authenticated as son of the father at the time of the second 763 descent of the hol y spirit as the dove . And this, as Egypt ian, is the doc trine of the dua l Horus, who was bor n of Isis, the virgin, and afterwards begot ten in spirit as the belove d son of Ra, the hol y spirit. Jesus when mothered by the virgin - dove , whether at On or Bethl ehem, is Iusa the com ing child of Hathor - Ius ā as; and Jesus when authenticated by the bird from heaven is Iusa as the son of Atum - Ra, the holy spirit who is fathered by the dove . This fatherhood of Jesus in his baptism is vouched for by the writers of the C anoni cal Gospels. And in “the Gospel according to the Hebrews,” Jesus speaks of His “Mother, the Holy Ghos t.” He says, “the Holy Spirit, my mother, took me and bor e me away to the great mount ain, called Thabor.” Which can be unde rstood as a saying of Iusa, the Egypt ian Jesus. Iusa of Annu went to Rom e as Ichthon of Annu. Jesus went to Rom e as Ichthus , the fish. The black Iusa went to Rom e as the Bambino. He went to Rom e as the ass - headed Iu, and also is the dove as bird of resurrection in the Catacom bs. He is found there in the several characters of Horus, Serapis, Mithras, and unde r various type s. But now here is the “historic” persona ge discove rable, living or dead, in subt erranean Rom e. According to the Osirian eschatology in the Ritual, Horus, the son o f God, was with his father in heaven before he descende d to our earth as the bringe r of peace and"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"goodw ill (hetep) to men. In com ing forth from heaven, he is said to reveal himself by disrobi ng himself to present himself to the earth. He issues forth as Ho rus, the son of Isis, the child of the Virgin Mother, saying, “I am Unbu .” That is, “I am the Branch.” He also describes himself as the mortal Horus who was bor n blind and dum b in “the abode of occultation, ” En - arar - ef (Rit., ch. 71). Jesus is bor n at Beth lehem, in the hous e of bread. Horus com es forth in Annu, the place of bread. The vesture of Horus is girt on him by Tait, the godde ss of food. This answers to the swaddl ing - clothes in which the child was wrappe d when the mother laid him in a mange r. Offeri ngs were made to the child who is received by the worshippe rs with “bendi ngs of the head in Annu” (Rit., ch. 82) . The reason why the divine child shoul d be born in a mange r is not because there was lack of room in the inn, but because the child had been pr evious ly bor n as a lamb or a calf before the type was hum anized, and when the crib, or mange r, was the earliest cradle of the little one . The birth of the babe in a mange r was anciently exhi bited in Egypt , and the origin is traceable to - day. The mother can be identified with the cattle - shed and the mange r. For instance, Hathor was the hat or hut ; Nepht hys is the hous e; Isis, the seat; the old first mother Apt was the crib; and Apt the crib is also the mange r which was a type of the cattle - shed when her offs pring was a calf. The Apt was the birthpl ace when this was the wom b of Apt, the water - cow . The name was then appl ied to the mange r, the crib, the hol d of a vessel, and to the city of Apt, or Thebes, in Egypt , which is the city of the mange r by name. The ch ild bor n in a mange r or Apt=crib is the wise way of show ing a cont inui ty of type which survived in Egypt dow n to Ptolemaic times. The child was incarnated to live and eat the bread of Seb= Joseph beneath the tree of Hathor — one of whos e names is Meri. In var ious legends , the child was brough t forth beneath the tree, and in our ancient carols the tree, as a cherry - tree, 764 bow s dow n for Mary to eat of its fruit at the com mand of the child, who is yet in the mother’s wom b. The obl ations offered in Tattu and the ador ations made in Annu are the same as in the story of the Magi, who bring their presents and bow dow n before the babe in Bethlehem. This rebirth is referred to in the tale of Sanehat: “Thou shalt see thys elf com e to the blessed state, they shall give thee the banda ges from the hand of Tait, the night of appl ying the oil of embalming” ( Egyptian Tales, p. 114, Petrie); where the making of the Karast - mum my is a type of the birth of the Christ or Anoi nted. Horus com es to record the words of God the father with his mout h; the same mout h that draws to it the spous e of Seb as wet - nur se for the child. Like Jesus in the Christology of John, he is the Word made flesh; and the spous e of Seb is the prototype of Mary, the spous e of Joseph, who is por trayed as the s uckler of Jesus in the Christian version of the legend. At his com ing there are cries of ador ation in Suten - Khen, the roya l birthpl ace, and of exul tation in An - arar - ef, the city of the blind. The whol e cycle of the gods is filled with satisfaction at seein g Horus inhe rit his throne to rule ove r the earth. There are bendi ngs in Annu where the different generations of the Rekhe t, the Pait, and the Hamemmat bow dow n before him. The evil Sut is filled with cons ternation at what has taken place. This reception o f the child in Annu, the hous e of bread, as a celestial locality, is the prototype of the jubi lation heard in Bethlehem when, “Sudde nly there was with the ange l a multitude of the heavenly hos t praising God” (Luke II. 13) . These are the acclamations"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"uttere d in Annu , on the divine babe making his appe arance there (Rit., ch. 125) , and being declared the heir of Seb, the god of earth, from whom he issued in the character of Iusa, the child of Ius ā as. At his adve nt Horus says the gods com e to him with their acc lamation, and the female deities with jubilation, when they see him. Horus, in the litany of Ra, is called the son of Ra, proceeding from Tum . “He has placed your offerings before you; he accords you the favour of receiving your por tion as his father Ra co mmande d. He is his darling. He is his descenda nt upon the earth.” “Show the way to his spirit. Show him his dw elling in the midst of the earth.” What we may term the hum an history of Horus is passed in the earth of Seb, his foster - father on earth, whos e br ead he eats, and in whos e hous e he dw ells with Isis, the virgin mother. There is neither date nor history of Horus betwixt the age of twelve and thirty years. The child - Horus qui ts the hous e of Seb and the virgin to reappe ar in the hous e of his father Osir is in the earth of eternity. This will expl ain why the yout hful Jesus leaves his mother and his earthly father Joseph to be about his heavenly father’s bus iness when he is twelve years of age. Also, this fact in the mythical representation will account for there being no further mention of Joseph in the Gospels after the jour ney to Jerusalem (Luke II. 43, 50) . Seb ceases to be the foster - father and protector of Horus, who disappe ars from the earth of time (or Seb) to reappe ar in the earth of eternity. The infant Horus was suckled by Isis in solitude . She is said to have nursed him in secret. No one kne w the hiding - place, but it was somewhere in the marshes of Amenta, the low er Egypt of the mythos . As an earthly locality, the place where Isis hid herself to suckle her 765 child was identified in the marshes of the Delta. This part of the progr amme is fulfilled in the Gospel according to Matthew, and there onl y, by the flight into Egypt . So soon as the babe was bor n, “an ange l of the Lord appe ared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt .” And the child was there unt il the death of Herod, “that it might be fulfilled which was spoke n by the Lord, through the prophe t, saying, Out of Egypt did I call my son ” (Matt. II. 13, 16). The child of the mother had to be taken dow n into Egypt in order that the Son of God might be brought up out of it, and for the mythos to be fulfilled as biblical history. At the birth of Horus the life of the young child was sought by the evil Sut. The mother was warned of the dange r by Taht, the luna r god, called the great one . He says to her, “Com e, thou godde ss Isis, hide thys elf with thy child”; and he tells her it is well to be obe dient. She is to take the child dow n into the ma rshes of low er Egypt , called Kheb, or Khebt. There, says Taht, “these things will happe n: his limbs will grow ; he will wax entirely strong; he will attain the digni ty of prince of the doubl e earth, and sit (or rest) upon the throne of his father.” Then the child and mother make their way to the papyr us - swamps. It is said that the plants were so secret that no enemy coul d enter there. “Sut coul d not penetrate this region, or go about in Kheb.” Nevertheless the child was bitten by the reptile, as the story is rende red in the sorrows of Isis, the pre - Christian mater dol orosa (Budge , The Gods of the Egyptians , vol . II, ch. 14). “Horus in Kheb” (Egypt ) was a title of the divine child. Kheb was in the nor th of Egypt , and it was there that Horus passed his early da ys, and was reared in secret by his mother Isis. Horus lands upon the"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"earth of Seb at eventide. He sits upon the seat of Ra, which is on the western horizon, and receives the offerings upon the altars. He says, “I drink the sacred liquo r each evening, in t he form of the lord of all creatures” (Rit., ch. 79) . The descent of Horus, as a child, to earth was daily or yearly according to the mythos . Every night the sinki ng sun was received by the mother in the breeding - place, or Meskhe n, of the western mount , wh ere she prepared him (or he her) for his new birth daily in the East. The poi nt at which the god descends to earth at evening is well por trayed in the obl ong zodi ac of Dende rah. In this the child - Horus is seated on the mount of the western equi nox in the s ign of the Scales. The sign of the Scales, Makhu, was onc e the sign of the autum n equi nox , and at that poi nt child - Horus touc hes earth for his descent from heaven. In this sign the child is por trayed sitting on the mount in the disc of the full moon. As se en by night , the mount of earth, or the horizon, is the mount of the ecliptic, the meeting - poi nt of earth and heaven. The full moon is the mother who is Virgo in the previous sign, and in the sign of the Scales she has brought forth the child. In the Gosp el of pseudo - James (ch. 22) it is John, the child of Elizabeth, who is sought for by Herod. “And Elizabeth groaned and said with a loud voi ce, Mount of God, receive a mother with her child. And sudde nly the mount ain was divided, and received them. And ligh t shone through to them.” It is the sam e story of the mother and child when appl ied to the infant John instead of Jesus. 766 The ope ning of the mount is in the equi nox , and it is there the pursued one s attain safety by entering the earth to escape from A pap, the devour ing dragon . Seb is the Egypt ian Joseph, as cons ort of Isis, the earth - mother and foster - father of the child; and at this point in the western equi nox where Horus enters the earth or the earth - life, Seb, as god of earth, takes charge of the c hild and mother to conve y them on the way to the low er Egypt of Amenta. Going dow n into Kheb or low er Egypt , as rende red in the Ritual, is descendi ng to the secret earth of Amenta, where the mother hid her infant in the marshes, when they were pur sued by Sut, otherwise the crocodi le. Now it is related in the Gospel of pseudo - Matthew (ch. 18) , that when Joseph and Mary were on their way to Egypt with the child - Jesus they came to a certain cave, and “Behol d there sudde nly came out of the cave many dragons , s eeing which the yout hs cried out with excessive fear. Then Jesus descendi ng from the mother’s lap stood on his feet before the dragons , and they adored Jesus.” In this scene, Jesus saves his father and mother from the dragons , which obe y him; and the drago ns we may cons ider to be crocodi les in accordance with Hebrew use and wont . In the Ritual, there is a chapter on repul sing the crocodiles in which Horus saves his father from the four crocodi les (these are eight in the Turin text of the Ritual). “I am the one ,” he says, “who saves the great one from the four crocodi les. I am the one who delivers his father from them.” “I am the one who cannot be overthrow n by the principles and pow ers of evil” (Rit., ch. 32) , or, as it is otherwise rende red by Renouf : “O so n who conve rsest with thy father, do thou protect this great one from these four crocodi les. I know them by their names and their way of living, and it is I who protect his ow n father from them.” He orders the crocodi les to go back, one by one , to their qu arters, and they obe y him with doc ility. Ra has given him pos session of low er Egypt , in which the living are destroye d,"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"and the crocodi les or dragons of the waters do not trium ph ove r him (ch. 32, 9). Com ing, as Horus, to make ready the horizon, he repul se s the crocodi les of darkne ss (ch. 136, 8, 9). The dragons of a “certain cave” that is found upon the way to Egypt are an Egypt o - gnos tic version of the crocodi les of Amenta in the Ritual. Thus , the animals in attenda nce on the child - Jesus in the apoc rypha l Gospels are witnesses for the child - Horus. Horus, as the yout hful sun - god on the hor izon, is accom panied by the two lions , Shu and Tefnut . He is attende d by the two lions . He is light ed in their recesses by the two lions (ch. 3, 1, 2). The pow er of two lio ns is represented by the head - dress of Horus. He is strengt hened by the doubl e force of the two lions . He arrives each day in the dw elling of the two lions (ch. 78, 20 - 22) , with the two lions who are his protectors. It is also said of the Osiris, “He is fu rnished with two lions ” (ch. 144 ). The lions are likewise in attenda nce upon Jesus in the Gospels of the Infancy. The lions ador ed him, and kept him com pany in the desert. They walked along with the child; bow ed their heads before him, and show ed subj ecti on by waggi ng their tails (Gospel of pseudo - Matthew, chs. 19 and 35). The “apoc rypha l” Gospels are not a mere collection of “foolish traditions ” or fables forged or inve nted to suppl y an account of that 767 period in “our Lord’s” history, respecting whi ch the accepted Gospels are almost silent. They are disjecta membra of the original matter; the mythos reduc ed to the state of Märchen; the story of the miraculous child told as a folk - tale which was at last repeated as a history in the Gospels with matter like the above om itted because it was too naturally incredible, and coul d not be utilized by the most desperate expe dient of miracle. When, or where, the mythos was no longe r interpreted astronom ically, from lapse of the necessary know ledge , the folk - tal es and legenda ry lore began to take the place of the ancient wisdom that was scientifically verifiable. Celestial localities were made geogr aphi cal. The descent of the little sun in the lower hemisphe re is described as the jour ney of the child - Horus into l ow er Egypt , accom panied by the Virgin Mother and Seb, or Joseph, the earthly father. It is obs ervable that in an Egypt ian planisphe re, according to Kircher, the god Seb is figured, on a large scale, in the Decans of Scorpio, with the sym bol ic goos e of eart h upon his head. This, at one time, marked the western equi nox; the poi nt at which the earth of Seb, or the mount ain, ope ned to protect the mother and child, when they sought refuge from the dragon, the scorpion, or serpent that stung the infant on the way to Egypt in the nether earth, and where “earth helped the wom an” (Rev. XII. 16) in her flight . The origin of the “Holy Family” can be traced to this initial poi nt of the jour ney dow n to Egypt. The moon at full was the mother with the child who rode upon the ass attende d by the old man Seb. This was the “wom an clothed with the sun and the moon unde r her feet, and upon her head a crow n of twelve stars,” who was persecuted by the crocodi le of darkne ss. At the autum n equi nox the Apap - reptile reared its loathl y form from out the abys s to pursue the mother and destroy her Babe. But the earth ope ned and helped the wom an, or Seb protected her as foster - father to the child of light . According to the astronom ical mythos , the Pool of Putrata, or lake of darkne ss, lay upon the western side of the mount . This was the habitat and lair of the dragon, “eternal devour er is its"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"name” (ch. 17, 40, 44). Here the reptile lurks and watches the “bight of Amenta” for its prey. With wide - ope n jaws of the crocodi le it swallow s the s inki ng stars (in the mythos ), and the soul s that fall into darkne ss (in the eschatology) . Above all, the dragon of darkne ss lies in wait for the virgin mother and her forthcom ing child, who is the saviour of vegetation and preserver of the light. The journ ey into Egypt can be follow ed a little further in the Gospels of the Infancy. The Arabic Gospel says the mother and child remained three years in Egypt , and the Lord Jesus wrought very many miracles in Egypt , which are not found written either in the Gospe l of the Infancy or in the perfect Gospel (Cow per, H. B., The Apoc ryphal Gospels, p. 191) . The child - Jesus in Egypt is the child - Horus in Egyp t, and the traditions of Horus have been assigne d to an “historic” Jesus. “These,” as Wiedeman put s the cart befor e the horse, “have affected a series of Copt ic texts which, in making use of the well - know n apoc rypha l account of Christ’s jour ney through Egyp t as a child, describe the trium pha l march of the Saviour along the valley of the Nile, and relate how he drove h is foes from place to place, 768 destroyi ng them as he went” ( Religion of the Ancient Egyptians , p. 77, Eng. tr.). According to the Gospel of pseudo - Matthew, the Holy family, fleeing from the murderer Herod, came into the bor ders of Hermopolis and “ente red into a certain city of Egypt which is called Sotinen.” Nothing has been made of this statement geogr aphi cally. But Sotinen evidently represents the Sutenhe n (earlier Suten - Khen) of the “Book of the Dead” (ch. 17) . This is a celestial locality of great impor tance to the legend of Horus in Kheb. In “the childhood of Jesus, according to Thomas,” one year is thus account ed for. “Now when they had com e into Egypt they found a lodgi ng in the hous e of a certain widow , and they lodge d one year in the same place ” (ch. I). It may be remembered that in one of her characters Isis is the widow of the dead Osiris. In a small papyr us now at the Louvr e there is an incantation against the evil serpent that stung the infant, in which the godde ss Isis is the speaker. She s ays, “I am Isis the widow , broke n with sorrow ” (Deveria, Catalogue des Manus crits Eg. Du Louv re ). Isis is the original widow who has an onl y son, and it is she who seeks the lost Osiris, and brings him to rebirth as Horus, her child, in the hous e of the wi dow . In the Kamite version of the journey into Egypt the Herrut - reptile takes the place of Herod, and the child - Horus is bitten by the serpent, though not stung to death. This event occurred when Isis was about to go dow n into Egypt for the safety of her c hild. M. Revillout (in 1881) described a Demotic papyr us at Leyde n, which gives an account of the attack made on Horus by the serpent. This text corrobor ates the statement of Plutarch and Aristides ( Apol ogy , par. 12) that the scene of the serpent’s attack was in Syria. It occurred when Isis was about to go dow n into Egypt , for Horus, the divine heir, to take pos session of his father’s kingdo m. When Isis and the child were setting out , Horus began to weep and cry because the serpent had stung him ( Proceeding s of the Soc iety of Biblical Archy., May, 1892 , p. 372) . Isis protects her child and heals his wound. This is the journey of the virgin mother from Syria dow n into Egypt , as represented in the mythos . The massacre of the Innoc ents is a com mon legend. In th e Jewish traditions there is a massacre of the little one s at the time of Moses’ birth, in which the Pharaoh plays the part of the mons ter Herod. So uni versal was this murder that no distinction was made betwixt the children of the Egypt ians and the Jews. On the day"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"that Moses was bor n the astrologe rs told Pharaoh they had seen in the stars that the deliverer of the Jews had been bor n that day, but they coul d not tell whether his parents were Egypt ian or Jewish. Therefore Pharaoh kills not onl y all the Jewi sh boys bor n that day, but also all the Egypt ians (for authorities see Proceedings of the Soc iety of Biblical Archæ ology , December 4, 1888) . It is the old, old story of the child that was bor n to be king in defiance of all obs tacles. The origin of the inn ocents that were massacred by the mons ter Herod can be traced in accordance with the ancient wisdom . A primitive soul of life was derived from the elements; the soul of Shu from wind or air; the soul of Seb from the earth; the soul of Horus, son of Ra, fro m the sun, which became the supr eme sour ce of the 769 elemental soul s that preceded a hum an soul . When the solar force was looke d upon as the highe st soul of life in nature, the soul s of future beings were cons idered to be emanations from the sun as a so urce of life in external nature that was supe rhum an. This gave rise to the class of beings know n as the Hamemmat, which originated as germs of soul that issued from the sun. They are described as circling round the solar orb in glory. The word hamemmat sig nifies that which is une mbod ied or not yet incorporated. We might say the hamemmat were pre - existing soul s when soul s were derived from the elemental forces in the germ, and the highe st of these was solar. They are the germ - soul s of future beings which ori ginate as children of the sun por trayed in a hum an form. As offspring of the sun, they are called the children of Horus, who, as the child - Horus, is one with them; and if they can be destroye d in the germ, or, as the Ritual has it, in the egg, the devour er of soul s may succeed in slaying the divine heir himself, who is destined to bruise the serpent’s head and win the victory ove r all the pow ers of evil as the lord of light and link of cont inui ty of life. Being at enm ity with the sun, the reptile of darkne s s seeks to devour the new - bor n child of light . For that pur pos e he lies in wait till the wom an clothed with the sun shall bring forth. He seeks the life of the young child - Horus, and other lives are invol ved in taking this. For Horus is the head of the sol ar race, the hamemmat or future beings that issue from the Eye of the sun. These future soul s are called the “issue of Horus.” They are the Innoc ents of the legend that are suppos ed to suffer, whereas the child of light , the divine offspring of the solar g od, is sure to escape from the coils of the mons ter who has been rende red anthropom orphi cally as the ruling tyrant — the mons ter Herod in a mortal gui se. Thus , if any little children were murdered by the Apap - mons ter, the dragon of darkne ss, these woul d be t he offspring and issue of the solar disk in the dom ain of phys ical phe nom ena — little one s that were neither hum an nor spiritual beings , but the seed or germs of soul s about to be. The parallel to the slaught er of the innoc ents can be traced in what is terme d “the slaught er which is wrought in Suten - Khen”; that is, in the khe n or birthpl ace where the young child - Horus was rebor n as the roya l Horus. Each one of the manes or the “youngl ings of Shu” had to pass through this place of rebirth where the Herrut - rept ile lay in wait. Chapter 42 is the one “by which one hinde reth the slaught er which is wrought in Sut en - Khen.” Here the manes speaks in the character of Horus the babe. “I am the babe” is said four times. As hum an manes, he is one of thos e who may be destro yed, but is safe so far as he has becom e assimilated to Horus. He tells the reptile, the herrut=Herod, that he is not to be seized or grasped by"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"him, and that neither men nor gods , neither the glorified nor the damned can inflict any injury on him who is H orus the divine child, born and bound to fulfil his cour se as the ever - com ing One, who “steppe th onw ard through eternity” (ch. 42) . Sotinen, “a certain city on the borders of Hermopol is,” is the dreaded place in Amenta, where the slaught er of the innoc ents was periodi cally wrought . The would be destroye r of the child is addr essed in one of his reptile - forms, “O serpent Abur !” (the name rende red “great thirst” is 770 equi valent to that of the dragon of drought ), thou sayest this day “the block of execution is furnished (Rit. ch. 42) , and thou art com e to cont aminate the Might y One.” In anot her chapter Horus exul ts that in making his descent to the earth of Seb for put ting a stop to evil his nest is safe. “Not to be seen is my nest. Not to be broke n is my eg g. I have made my nest on the conf ines of Heaven” (Rit., ch. 85) . He rejoices on account of his escape from the slaught er of the innoc ents which follow ed his descent into the earth of Seb. Thus in the Osirian mythos the child - Horus was with the widow in Su ten - Khen, and in the Gospel of the Infancy it is the child - Jesus with the widow in Sotinen. T HE E GYPTO - G NOSTIC J ESUS . On one line of its descent the Jesus - legend was brought on to Rom e from Egypt by the mystery - teachers whom we term Egypt o - gnostics, an d whos e Jesus was no Word - made - flesh in one historic form of persona lity, either at Nazareth or at Bethlehem, but was absolutely non - historical. One of the most important of all the written gnos tic remains is the Pistis Sophi a. And whether we look on this as the work of Valentinus or anot her, it cont inue s the Jesus - legend from the Egypt ian sour ce, and cons titutes a further link betwixt the genui ne mythos and the spur ious history. These books of Ieou are the books of Jesus, like the “Wisdom of Jesus” in the Apoc rypha and the lately discove red “Sayings of Jesus,” that is, when the onl y real Jesus has been discove red in Iusa the son of Ius ā as, he whos e Jewish name is Ieou, Iao or Iah, as derivatives from Iu, in Egypt ian. The two books of Ieou are said to cont a in the Mysteries, the first being the lesser, the second the greater mysteries, as the Pistis Sophi a carefully expl ains. Here we reach the Egypt ian rootage of the Jewish Ieou, whom the Pistis Sophi a calls “Ieou the first man, the legate of the first order” (p. 333 ). Now as Atum was the first man, the created man, who und er one of his names was Iu, the Egypt ian Jesus, this also tends to identify the Egyp to - gnos tic Ieou with Iu - em - hetep, the author of the Sayings and the books of wisdom which include d The Boo k of the Great Logos , according to the Mystery, an equi valent for the Logo i or Sayings of Jesus, which were Christianized as the Logi a Kuriaka or Sayings of the Lord, and on which the canoni cal Gospels were eventually founde d. Pistis Sophi a, like the Ritu al, is mainly pos t - resurrectional , with the briefest allusion to the earth - life. It begins with the after - life in which Jesus has risen from the dead, like Amsu the good shephe rd. It ope ns with the resurrection on the Mount of Glory, the same as the Ritual . The localities, like thos e in the Egypt ian books , are not of this"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"world. They are in the earth of eternity, not in the earth of time. Pistis Sophi a begins where the Gospel story com es to an end. Jesus rises in the Mount of Olives, but not on the mount 7 71 that was localized to the east of Jerusalem. The Mount of Olives, as Egypt ian, was the mount ain of Amenta. It is termed Mount Bakhu, the Mount of the Olive - tree, when the green dawn was represented by this tree instead of by the sycamore. Mount Bakhu, the Mount of the Olive - tree, was the way of ascent to the risen Saviour as he issued forth from Amenta to the land of spirits in heaven (Rit., ch. 17) . So when the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus takes his seat upon the Mount of Olives or the Olive - tree, he is said t o have “ascende d into the heavens” ( Pistis Sophi a, Mead, G. R. S., whos e version is the onl y one in Engl ish: London, 1896) . Jesus “descende d into hell,” according to the Christian creed. This forms no part of the Gospel - legend, but we find it in the Book o f the Dead; also in Pistis Sophi a. Hell or Hades in Greek is the Amenta, as Egypt ian. Horus descends into Amenta, or rather rises there from the tom b, as the teacher of the mysteries conc erning the father, who is Ra the father in spirit and in truth. This descent into the unde r - world is spoke n of by Horus in the Ritual (ch. 38) . He goe s to visit the spirits in prison or in their cells and sepul chres. Thos e “who are in their cells,” the manes, “accom pany him as his gui des.” His obj ect in making this descent is to utter the words of the father in heaven to the breathless one s, or the spirits in prison. The passage show s the speaker as the divine teacher in two characters on earth and in Amenta. Speaking of Ra, his father in the spirit, Horus says, “I utter his words to the Men of the present generation, ” or to the living. He also utters them to thos e who have been deprived of breath, or the dead in Amenta. So in the Pistis Sophi a the gnos tic Jesus passes into Amenta as the teacher of the greater mysteries. As i t is said of his teaching in this spirit - world, “Jesus spak e these words unt o his disciples in the midst of Amenta” (p. 394, Mead). Moreove r, a special title is assigne d to Jesus in Amenta. He is called Aber - Amentho. “Jesus, that is to say Aber - Amentho, ” i s a formula several times repeated in Pistis Sophi a. According to the Ritual, a glorious “vesture” is put on in the place where the hum an soul becom es eternized or is made immortal. This is represented in the mystery of Tattu, where the body - soul in matte r (Osiris) is blende d with the hol y spirit Ra; the female with the male (Tefnut with Shu), or Horus the child of twelve years with Horus the adul t of thirty years. The transaction occurs on the day that was termed “Com e thou to me” (Rit., ch. 17). This cal l is reproduc ed in the Pistis Sophi a as “Com e unt o us” on the day of Inve stiture, when Jesus put s on the divine vesture in his character of Aber - Amentho, or Lord ove r Amenta, a title which identifies the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus with Horus in Amenta. The call is made to him by the attenda nt spirits, “Com e unt o us, who are thy fellow - members”; “Com e unt o us, for we all stand near to clothe thee with the first mystery (that of the father) in all his glory”; “Com e therefore qui ckly, that thou mayst receive the ful l glory, the glory of the first mystery,” the mystery of God the father ( P. S., 16 - 19) . The Pistis Sophi a is a book of thos e Egypt o - gnos tics with whom the Father - God is Ieou= Ihuh, and God the son is Iao= Iah ( P. S., B. 2, 192, 193, Mead). It cont ains an Eg ypt o - gnos tic version of the mysteries, astronom ical and eschatologi cal."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" 772 Relics of the ancient wisdom have been pious ly preserved in this, the most impor tant of all the gnos tic remains, i.e., for the purpos e of establishing a link betwixt the Egypt ia n origins and the canoni cal Gospels, and for show ing how the “History” was conc octed. The Jesus who is teacher of the twelve in Pistis Sophi a is the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus who had been from of old the ever - com ing son of the eternal father, whom we trace by n ature and by name as far back as the time of Ptah in Memphi s. This is the Jesus, or the Horus, of the Egypt ian mysteries, and not of any Jude an biogr aphy. In the religion of Atum - Ra the names of Horus and of Iu or Jesus were employe d to denot e the same cha racter, and bot h names were cont inue d for the one type by the Egypt o - gnos tics. The gnos tic Jesus is the son of God who had been with the father from eternity. Hence it is he alone who know s the father and is able to expound the mystery of his nature to the Twelve. This is the first, great and onl y ineffable mystery, which is before all others and embraces all the rest. Jesus proceeding from the father as a spirit, divine in origin, impersona tes the soul that became incarnate in the hum an form. The great pri mordial and ineffable mystery, from which the others radiate, and in which the total twenty - four revol ve as the central sour ce of an eternal evol ution and invol ution, is the mystery of God the father becom ing God the son. God the father is the hol y spirit represented by a bird. This bird in the Egypt ian sym bol ism was the hawk, or dove . In the gnos tic version it is the dove . One chief difference between the two birds is in the dove being a type of the mother and child, whereas the hawk was the bird of the fa ther, Ra, and the son; the holy Spirit, and Horus the son of the father. In the Pistis Sophi a the son proceeds from the father in the likeness of the dove where Horus proceeded from the hawk - headed Ra in the likeness of a hawk. Unde r whichever type the dua lity of the father and son was indi cated by one bird as sym bol of the God in spirit, who was ove r all the pow ers which had been (elemental or astronom ical) rulers in the realms of matter from the beginni ng. The gnos tic Jesus utters the Sayings or Logi a Ku riaka on the mount , and is also the revealer of the greater mysteries of Amenta. According to the Pistis Sophi a, when Jesus expounde d the greater mysteries to the twelve it is said “Jesus spake these words to his disciples in Amenta” (Books of the Saviour , P. S., 394, Mead). He had previous ly taught the lesser mysteries to the twelve disciples in the life on earth. It is the same with Jesus as with Horus in Amenta. When Horus passes from the life on earth he rises from the tom b wearing the doubl e feather an d wielding the whip as his sign of sove reignt y. He is Amsu - Horus, Lord of Amenta. This is the title of the gnos tic Jesus, who is designa ted “Jesus, that is to say Aber - Amentho” — which we take to be Jewish - gnos tic for Jesus, the might y or great one , who in h is resurrection is the Lord or Master ove r Amenta (Books of the Saviour , Pistis Sophi a, 358 , Mead). And Jesus “Aber - Amentho” is an Egyp to - gnos tic equi valent for Osiris “Khent Amenta.” The mysteries of Amenta, as in the Book of Revelation, are more or less repeated in the mysteries of Pistis Sophi a which cont ains sufficient data to identify a gnos tic version with the Kamite original. 773 "},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"There are twelve divisions in Amenta correspondi ng to the twelve hour s of darkne ss. Twelve gates or doo rs successively enclose twelve sections of space, and the door s are gua rded by twelve serpents, one serpent “to each door .” These twelve divisions of the nether regions are repeated in Pistis Sophi a as twelve dunge ons of infernal torment. The surroundi ng gloom is represen ted by the Apap - dragon of darkne ss. As it is said, “the out er darkne ss is a huge dragon with its tail in its mout h” (B. 2, 320) . There are twelve rulers or gua rdians to the twelve dunge ons who take the place of the Egypt ian twelve serpents ( Book of Hade s, Records, vol . 10) . They have the faces of serpents, dragons , basilisks, crocodi les, cats, vul tures, bears and other beasts; for, as it is said of the rulers of “these twelve dunge ons which are inside the dragon of out er darkne ss,” “each hath a name for eve ry hour , and each one of them change th its face every hour ” (B. 2, 322 ). A dog - faced demon, called the eternal devour er, who lives upon the damned, is described in the Ritual (ch. 17) . The deceased prays to the great Osiris, “Deliver me from that God who l iveth upon the damned, whos e face is that of a hound, but whos e skin is that of a man, at the angl e of the pool of fire.” This “dog - faced one ” and his rivers of fire reappe ar in the Pistis Sophi a. Certain sins are to be renounc ed in order that the manes ma y escape from “the judgm ent of that dog - faced one ” and from the “judgm ents of Amenta,” “from the fires of Amenta,” and “from the torments which are in Amenta” (B. 2, 255 - 256) . Know ing the magical names in Amenta has the same pow er, according to the Pistis Sophi a, as with the Book of the Dead. For instance, the dragon of out er darkne ss has twelve names written on the door s of its dunge ons , and, as it is said, whos oever shall unde rstand the mystery of one of the names, if he is abandone d in the out er darkne ss and he pronounc eth the name of the dragon , he shall be saved and receive the treasure of light (B. 2, 335 , Mead). To know the name was to obt ain pos session of the magical word of pow er which meant salvation. In the Egypt ian hall of judgm ent there are for ty - two assessors, and the deceased has to plead in their presence that he has not broke n any of the forty - two com mandm ents (Rit., ch. 125) . A version of these is retained in the Pistis Sophi a in the shape of forty - four renunc iations , two having been adde d to the Egypt ian forty - two. By renounc ing these forty - four sins the deceased is saved from the dog - faced devour er of soul s, from the dragon of out er darkne ss, from Ialdabaoth= Sut, prince of the pow ers of darkne ss, and from the torments of the twelve dunge on s of the outer darkne ss, all of which are Egypt ian. The lesser mysteries were astronom ical; the greater mysteries are spiritual. The astronom ical nature of the “lesser mysteries” is convi ncingl y show n in the Pistis Sophi a; also the astronom ical origin of t he Twelve who were taught thos e mysteries by the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus sitting on the mount . The mystery of the five suppor ters, the mystery of the seven amens or seven voi ces (in the heptanom is), the mystery of the nine gua rdians of the three gates of the treasures of light (=the Put - circle of the nine gods who were in three threes), the mystery of the great forefather, the mystery of the triple pow ers or of the trinity, and lastly the mystery of the twelve saviour s who preserve the treasure of light 774 in heaven and on earth, are all identifiable as primary type s in the astronom ical mythol ogy of Egypt ."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" The teacher of the mysteries is an Egypt ian type .

Brugs ch enum erates seven classes of such teachers: (1) the mystery - teachers of h eaven; (2) the mystery - teachers of all the lands , which were first of all celestial; (3) the mystery - teachers of the depth (Amenta); (4) the mystery - teachers of the secret world; (5) the mystery - teachers of the sacred langua ge; (6) the mystery - teachers of Pharaoh; (7) the mystery - teachers who examine words. The divine child manifests to men as expounde r of the mysteries or revealer of the hidde n wisdom of which he is the word, the sayer, or the teacher. The teacher of the lesser mysteries was child - Horus or Iusa, the yout h of twelve years. These were the mysteries of matter and of mythol ogy revealed by the child of the mother at his first adve nt. The teacher of the greater mysteries was Horus the adul t, who expounde d the nature of the fatherhood, the begetta l or dupl ication of the divine soul , and all the other mysteries of the resurrection in and from Amenta, as the son of God the father in heaven. But the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus is the fulfiller of bot h the first and the second adve nt; the first as the child o f twelve years, the second as the Horus of thirty years; the first in the life on earth, the second in Amenta; the first as solar in the astronom ical mythol ogy, the second as spiritual in the eschatology; the first as the utterer of parables, the second as the expounde r of the greater mysteries. In vain do we try to make out the doc trinal mysteries of the eschatology, whether it is called Egypt ian, Hebrew, Copt ic, Gnos tic, or Christian, unt il we have mastered the mythol ogy. Withou t this founda tion there is no foothol d. Neither is there any help in an exot eric version of the esoteric wisdom . The group of pow ers was seven or eight , nine or ten, before it include d the twelve. And the character is the same in the mythos when the group is twelve as when it was t en or nine, eight or seven or four — that is, it was astronom ical. Pistis Sophi a com mences formally after the manne r of an historic doc um ent, whilst being, from beginni ng to end, entirely non - historical. It ope ns with a date that is astronom ical, and also w ith what the Ritual terms “the manifestation to light” at the time of full moon — that is, when the eye was full or the circle com plete in Annu , where the divine heir was bor n. “It came to pass, when Jesus had risen from the dead in the first adve nt, that he passed eleven (shoul d be twelve) years speaking with his disciples and instructing them up to the regions of the first statutes onl y and up to the regions of the first mystery – the mystery within the veil – the veil that was rent in death, which is before al l mysteries, because it is the mystery of the One Eternal God and the son who issues from the father in the likeness of a dove , just as Horus issued from the father in the likeness of the hawk or dove , or the @canoni cal Christ as the dove . “It came to pass , therefore, that the disciples were sitting toge ther on the Mount of Olives, speaking of these things , rejoicing with great joy, and being exceedingl y glad, and saying one to anot her, ‘Blessed are we before all men who are on earth, for the Saviour hath r evealed this unt o us, and we have received all fulness and all perfection’ ” — 775 as these were received upon Mount Bakhu, the Mount of the Olive - tree, in the ascent of Horus from Amenta. “And while they were saying these things the one to the other Jesus sat a little apart from them.” “It came to pass, therefore, on the fifteenth day of the mont h, Tybi (or Tobe ), the day of the full moon , on that day when the sun had risen in its goi ng,"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"that there came forth a great stream of light shining exceedingl y.

This has an impor tant bearing on the statement in the first part of Pistis Sophi a. The time spent by Horus the elder in the great hall of Seb, or on earth, in mortal form, was twelve years in the original mythos , this being the Egypt ian limit of child - life. It is twelve years in the tale of Kham uas . But in the Pistis Sophi a the time is given as eleven years, which has t he vague ness of the märchen. This tends to show the origin of the tradition repor ted by Irenæ us, that the ministry and teaching of Jesus extende d ove r a vague period of ten or more years, and that the Lord lived on to be an old man, the old man being a lit eralized version of the old child, Har - Ur, the elder Horus (Iren., B. 2, ch. 22, 5). During thos e twelve years he was the child of the mother onl y, as in the Gospels of the Infancy. He is her Word or logos , and the teacher of thos e lesser mysteries that le d up to the one great ineffable mystery which was now held to be the sour ce of all the rest. We hear little of the wonde rful child as divine teacher in the canoni cal Gospels, but som e of the exclude d matter appe ars in the apoc rypha l Gospels. In the canoni cal Gospels the child - Jesus is the teacher at twelve years of age. This corresponds to Horus as wearer of the lock, and to Iu - em - hetep, the yout hful sage, each of whom had been por trayed as the typi cal teacher twelve years old. It was dur ing thos e years th at the child - Horus or child - Jesus taught . Som ething of this may be read in the so - called “apoc rypha l Gospels,” ignor antly suppos ed to cont ain the lying inve ntions conc octed by the gnos tic heretics to discredit and destroy a veritable hum an history. There i s a very naï ve conf ession in the “Arabic Gospel” that, dur ing the first three years of the infancy, the child - Jesus” wrought very many miracles in Egyp t which are not found written either in the Gospel of the Infancy or in the Perfect Gospel” (ch. 25) . Suc h stories had been told for ages of the child - Horus, who was a miracle - worker in and from the wom b; and also of the 776 child as Iusa, son of Atum - Ra, and earlier still of Iu - em - hetep, the son of Ptah. The miracles were a mode of demons trating the divini ty of the ever - com ing little one , Iu - Su. At three years of age he performs the miracle of making a dead fish live (Latin Gospel of Thom as, B. 3, ch. 1). At five years of age he takes clay and mode ls twelve sparrow s, which he com mande d to fly, whereupon the y lived and flew aloft (Latin Gospel of Thom as, B. 2, ch. 2). Horus or Jesus, Egypt ian, Jewish, or Gnos tic, the little hero of the mythos , is one and the same divine son of the Virgin in mortal gui se."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" Horus, at his com ing - froth from Amenta, as the Word or Teacher, says: “I make my appe arance on the seat of Ra, and I sit upon my seat which is upon the hor izon” (Rit., ch. 79) . The hor izon and the mount are identical in Egypt ian, and this seat of Ra, the father in heaven, assum ed by Horus in his ascent from A menta, is the mount of earth according to the solar mythos — that is, the mount of sunr ise, which is Mount Bakhu in Egypt ian, the Mount of the Olive - tree, the prototypal Mount of Olives. In the Pistis Sophi a Jesus takes his seat upon the Mount of Olives as t he divine teacher, word or logos , who utters the Sayings to his disciples. This is the adve nt of Jesus which is dated the fifteenth day of the Egypt ian mont h Tybi , the day of full moon , by which the resurrection or new birth was always reckone d. This mont h in the Alexandr ian year ( B.C. 25) began December 27t h, which is near enough as a date for the nativity at Christmas, when measured in the circle of precession. The “com ing - forth to day” is illustrated by the great flood of light that emanated from the lig ht of light s and “enve lope d him entirely.” “The multitude of the heavenly hos t praising God” (Luke II. 13) is described. “And all the ange ls with their archange ls, and all the pow ers of the height , all sang from the interior of the interiors, so that the w hol e world heard their voice.” “But the disciples sat toge ther and were in the greatest pos sible distress” (B. 1, p. 6, Mead). In the Ritual when Horus stands or is seated (on the Mount of the Olive - tree) “in the (hum an) form of that god who is raised alof t upon his pedestal” or his papyrus, it is said “the gods com e to him with acclamation, and the female deities with jubilation. ” “They rejoice at his beautiful com ing - forth from the wom b of Nut,” or, as it might be rende red, the wom b of Meri, for Meri=Mary is anot her name for Nut the mother - heaven (Book of the Dead). The gnos tic Jesus, on emerging from Amenta, takes his seat as teacher of the twelve disciples on the Mount of Olives. The way up from Amenta for the sun - god in the solar mythos was on the east ern side of the four - faced mount of earth which on that side was know n as Bakhu, the Mount of the Olive - tree. The way of ascent, worked out in the mythos , served for the manes in the eschatology. Thus Jesus in the ancient character of sun - god, or as the di vine child who taught , or who was the word in mortal gui se, attains the landi ng - stage upon the Mount of Olives or the olive - tree of dawn, when he issues in or from Amenta, like Horus in the tamarisk, as Jesus of the resurrection. The divine child is not me rely born in hum an guise, but also as the yout hful solar god . Hence in the beginni ng of the narrative the disciples are sitting round him on the Mount of Olives 777 with Jesus shining like the sun in glory ( P. S., B. 1, 4). The scene had been already set in the astronom ical mythos . He images the sun - god on the mount ; the twelve are round him in the zodi ac. And, as it is not ed, although Jesus is in their midst, he is “a little apart from his disciples.” Thus Pistis Sophi a show s the phys ical founda tion of the mysteries. Astronom ical science was taught as matter of the mysteries, but the science being phys ical these were classified as the lesser mysteries, whereas the greater mysteries were eschatologi cal. The twelve on earth, or in matter, were the com panio ns of elder Horus, the son of Isis, the suffering saviour . The twelve in Amenta are the associates of Horus, the trium pha nt saviour , the belove d onl y - begot ten son of God the father. The twelve with Horus or Jesus risen from Amenta are freed from the envi ro nm ent, the darkne ss, the stains of matter, as"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"pur e spirits to be whol ly perfected. They have attained the beatific vision, as the children of light . They have passed through death and the purgation of matter to becom e clear spirit when risen to the status of Horus the immortal. With Horus or Jesus, in the character of the young sun - god , the twelve were astronom ical pow ers, rulers, or saviour s of the treasure (light ) in the phys ical dom ain. With Horus or Jesus, the saviour as son of God the father, they are the twelve glorious one s or gods of Amenta, the twelve who as spirits are the children of Ra the hol y spirit; in shor t, they are the twelve in the eschatology who were the chos en twelve with Horus on earth as sow ers of the seed, and the twelve with Horus a s reapers of the harvest in Amenta. Our starting - poi nt, then, is that Jesus or Horus in com ing to earth and assum ing the vesture of mortality issues forth in Amenta; not the Greek Hades, nor the Hebrew Sheol, but the Egypt ian Amenta, that other world in w hich the dead as sleepers wake to life in spirit, and where the mortal Horus makes his transformation and arises as the first - fruits of them that slept — a resurrection of Horus that was celebrated in Egyp t when the “first - fruits of the earth” were the shoot s of the papyrus - plant or sprout s of the lentils, as described by Plutarch. When Jesus, in his second adve nt, issues from Amenta to becom e the teacher of the twelve upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples are already seated on the mount . Jesus sudde nly app ears to them, a little apart from them, in such a dazzle of glory as to be at first invi sible to them. This glory of light was com pos ed of various light s. “The light was of every kind, and of every type , from the low er to the highe r” ( P. S., 1, 5). It was the glory of the yout hful solar god upon the mount of sunr ise, with the lesser light s surroundi ng him. So in the Ritual it is said of the sun - god , who was Horus in his beautiful com ing - forth, “Ra maketh his appe arance at the mount of glory, with the cycle of gods about him” (Rit., ch. 133 , Renouf ). This was upon the Mount Bakhu or the olive - tree of dawn, and the cycle of gods about the “gol den form” of Horus are the astronom ical originals of the disciples with the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus on the mount of sunr is e called the mount of glory. The twelve disciples of the Lord are no more hum an than was their teacher. But when the word was made flesh and Jesus assum ed the hum an gui se, his follow ers likewise conf ormed to the anthropom orphi c 778 type of Horus the mort al in the life that was lived, as mythically represented, for twelve years as the child of Seb on earth. The twelve with Horus in the harvest - field are reapers, and reapers, mariners, fishers, or teachers demande d the anthropom orphi c type . The hum an type , how ever, doe s not necessarily imply the hum an persona ge, either in the teacher or as the taught , any more than the zoot ype s imply that the god was a crocodi le, a hawk, a lion, or that the godde ss was a water - cow , a serpent, a tree, or a cleft in the rock. As the gnos tics truly declared, in reply to the pretende d “History,” the twelve apos tles were a type of the twelve æons , who were set in the zodi ac as timekeepers and preservers of the light . (Irenæ us, Bk. 2, ch. 21, 1.) That is, they who kne w vouc hed for the apos tles being the same as the æons who were the twelve pow ers of the twelve saviour s of the twelve treasures of light with the gnos tic Jesus on the mount , whos e twelve stations were figur ed in the zodi ac; and who were the twelve pow ers in matter, in phys ics, or in the astronom ical mythology which preceded the twelve as great spirits with Jesus or Horus in the eschatology. Even if there had been twelve men as a group of"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"teachers, fishers, or harvesters, in every city, tow n, or village of the earth who called themselves the disciples, or apos tles, of Jesus, Horus, or the Lord, it coul d not change one jot or tittle of the fact that the twelve were teachers of astronom y, whos e names were written in heaven as attenda nts on the yout hful solar god; and who in the second pha se became the twelve great spirits in Amenta as reapers of the harvest for Har - khu ti, the Egypt ian lord of spirits. The god at the head of a group or cycle of pow ers was a teacher from the first. Sut, Anup , Taht and Ptah were typi cal teacher s of astronom y in the stellar, luna r and solar mythos , when the group was seven, eight , or nine in number. Jesus (or Horus) is the onl y teacher in the heaven of twelve astronom es. He was the onl y - begot ten son in spirit who was made flesh in his incarnation to enter the hum an sphe re as child of the mother, that is of matter as the matrix of spirit. He became the greatest of all the teachers in the astronom ical mythos , and “the twelve” who had been pre - solar teachers and preservers of the treasures of light w ere now his servants (Seshu) , his follow ers, his apos tles. And being the Only Son of God it was Jesus alone who kne w the nature of the Father, which know ledge he now expounde d to the twelve in the highe r mysteries of Amenta. Jesus describes the twelve in t he two different categor ies, astronom ical and spiritual, and says, “When I first came into the world I brought with me twelve pow ers. I took them from the hands of the twelve saviour s of the treasure of light ”: that is, from the twelve who are called the æ ons in the astronom y; the twelve who had been the pow ers in phys ical phe nom ena. These were uni fied in him; he gathers their pow ers to himself in passing through the twelve signs of the zodi ac as the yout hful solar god. At an earlier stage of the mythos the pow ers that were gathered up in the one supr eme pow er were but seven in num ber, called the seven soul s of Ra; in the final zodi ac they are twelve. Jesus also describes the foundi ng of the twelve as his ministers on earth in matter, or in the low er range o f the mysteries. The first Horus imaged a soul in matter; the second was the likeness of an immortal spirit. Jesus 779 brought the primary soul to the twelve who are his associates in the life on earth. But that was before he was inve sted as a Sahu or sp iritual mum my to becom e the lord of the resurrection as Jesus Aber - Amentho. The typi cal twelve, who latterly became the teachers of, and for, the Word, were as ancient as the signs of the zodi ac, or the twelve great gods of Egypt , which according to Herod otus were extant som e 20, 000 years ago. They were the twelve as kings , who row ed the solar - bark for Ra, with Horus on the look - out at the prow . They were the twelve in various characters and in several count ries into which the gnos is of the mysteries passe d from out the birthpl ace of the ancient wisdom ; although the twelve have no such uni versal radius as the seven, or the four , because of their com parative lateness in Egypt . They were the twelve princes of Israel (Num. I. 44), the twelve sons of Israel; th e twelve judge s on twelve throne s with the Son of man sitting on the throne of his glory (Matt. XIX. 28) ; also the twelve that sit at the table with the son in the new kingdom founde d by him for the father (Luke XXII. 14) . They are the twelve knight s that gathered round the table of Arthur ; the twelve gods with Odin in their midst, with others that need not be enum erated now . At his second adve nt, which is in the spirit, the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus says to the disciples, “I am com e now , and not (as) formerly b efore they had"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"crucified me.” That is when he was represented as the afflicted mortal suffering in the flesh. ( P. S., 1, 10.) He has now com e in the spirit which was imaged by the dove , and not as formerly or aforetime when he was incarnated in matter, for the twelve years on earth, as the lifetime of the child was reckone d. Becom ing a spirit is described as put ting on the vesture of everlasting light . And the com ing forth of Jesus as a spirit, or the Christ, is described as his inve stiture, the same as wit h Horus in Amenta. He says, “The times are fulfilled for me to put on my vesture. Lo, I have put on my vesture, and all pow er hath been given to me by the first mystery” — or God as the one eternal sour ce. He issues from this sour ce as the light of all the l ights; a light that is infinitely beyond the star - fires, the moon - light , and the splendour s of the sun, in the mythical representation. All the previous pow ers of light had cont ribut ed to fulfil the glory of this vesture. These pow ers belong mainly to the astronom ical mythol ogy as the light s that were revealed and set forth in the lesser mysteries of the phys ical dom ain, which, according to gnos tic terminol ogy , were designa ted the rulers in matter. Amongs t these are “the seven amens which are the seven voi c es”; the five suppor ts, the nine gua rdians, the three pow ers, the twelve saviour s of light , all of whom are recogni zably astronom ical. ( P. S., B. 1, 14, 18, 19. ) He wears the glory now , “as of an onl y - begot ten from the father.” In making this transformatio n Jesus presents an out er view of God the father as the first ineffable mystery of all the mysteries. When he came previous ly, in his first adve nt, it was from the mother as the mortal, or the moul d of soul in matter. Now he issues from the father in spiri t as revealer of the mystery of which he alone has ever had an inne r view. He is now inve sted with the glory of the father. This inve stiture of Jesus in spirit might be claimed as pre - eminently 780 Egypt ian if all the rest were not pre - eminently so. As a mystery of Amenta this inve stiture took place when the deceased became a Sahu and put on the divine vesture of a spiritual body, or the soul of Horus. The Sahu signifies the inve sted, and it is identical with the Karest or the Christ. There is one datum which by itself alone might dispel any doubt respecting the Egypt ian origin of the Pistis Sophi a. It is this: the day of inve stiture is the day of “Com e thou to me.” (Rit., ch. 17. ) In the Pistis Sophi a this is the call, not onl y of Ra but of all the pow er s of light who raise the cry of “Com e unt o us” that Jesus may receive the glory of the Father as his vesture for the resurrection. In the so - called earth - life “Jesus had not told his disciples the whol e distribut ion of all the regions of the great invi sibl e, and of the three triple pow ers, and of the four - and - twenty invisibles.” “Nor had he told them of their saviour s, according to the orders of each (of the twelve) as they are; nor had he told them of the region of the saviour of the twins; nor the region of the three amens; nor thos e of the seven amens, which are also the seven voi ces. Nor had Jesus told his disciples of what type are the five suppor ters, or from what region they had been brought forth. Nor had he told them how the great light had emanated , nor from what region it had been brought forth.” (B. 1, 2, 3, Mead.) In brief, as the data when identified will show , he had not instructed them in the spiritual nature of the mysteries, which is the obj ect of the second com ing. But now the teacher in Am enta says to the twelve, “Rejoice and be glad from this hour . From this day will I speak with you freely, from the beginni ng of the truth unt o the com pletion thereof; and I will speak to you face to face without parable. From this"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"hour will I hide not hing from you of the things which pertain to the height .” (B. 1, 3, 1, 8, 9, Mead.) This is said by Jesus Aber - Amentho, or Jesus in the spirit - world of Amenta, who had “Com e forth to day” at his second adve nt. When he is expoundi ng the profounde r mysteries, Jes us says to the disciples, “As for the rest of the low er mysteries, we have no need thereof, but ye shall find them in the Two Books of Ieou, which Enoc h wrote when I spoke with him from the tree of kno wledge , and from the tree of life, which were in the pa radise of Adam.” (B. 2, 246, Mead.) In this passage Jesus identifies himself with Iao the son of Ieou= Ihuh — and also in the character of the solar god who spoke with Moses from the midst of the burning bus h. It was show n in the mysteries why and how the Tw elve Immova bles, or Unspeakables, “rent themselves asunde r,” to move , to manifest, to reveal, to find utterance by means of God the Son as teacher of the mysteries in Amenta (B. 2, 219 - 226) . Pistis Sophi a marks the change of the twelve rulers from one cate gor y to the other. These things , said Jesus, speaking of the change which he had com e on earth, or entered the low er dom ain of matter, to effect, “these things shall com e to pass at the time of the com pletion of the æon (or cycle), and of the accession of the Plerom a. The twelve saviour s of the treasure, and the twelve orders of each of them, which are the emanations of the 781 seven voi ces and of the five trees (or suppor ts) shall be with me in my kingdo m,” which was in the heaven of eternity. Jesus spea ks of thos e “who receive the mystery of light when they shall have qui tted the body of the matter of the rulers” (B. 2, 201) , who were the rulers in matter versus the life in spirit, or in Horus as the lord of light who was the witness to the light of life eternal. Jesus is described in Pistis Sophi a as passing through the twelve signs of the zodi ac. The ram, bul l, twins, crab, lion, balance, scorpion, bow man, goa t, and waterer are all mentione d by name. ( B. of the S. in Pistis Sophi a, 366 - 372 , Mead.) He p asses through the twelve signs in his character of solar god. He takes a por tion of their light from the twelve æons who were the Kronian rulers. “And the twelve pow ers of the twelve saviour s of the treasure of light , which I had received from the twelve m inisters of the midst, I cast into the sphe re of the rulers . . . and I bound them into the bodi es of your mothers.” The rulers of the Decans thought that these twelve were “the soul s of the rulers.” But, when in the fulness of time they were brought forth into the world, there was no soul of the rulers in them; they were recogni zed as beings of a supe rior nature. Jesus is to reign as king ove r these twelve saviour s, the twin - saviour , the nine gua rdians, the three amens, the five suppor ters, and the seven a mens and all the other characters, which had been “light - emanations ,” and which woul d have no meaning if Jesus had not likewise had an astronom ical character. (B. 2, 230 , 231 .) For these names connot e the seven rulers of the Heptanom is; the five suppor ts o f a heaven that was based upon a figure of the pole and the arms of the four qua rters; the solar trinity; the nine gods of the put - cycle, the Twin - Horus, and the heaven that was perfected at last as the heaven of the twelve tribes, twelve sons , twelve brot hers, twelve kings , twelve reapers, twelve row ers, twelve fishermen, twelve voi ces of the word, twelve teachers, who began as saviour s of the treasure of light in phys ical phe nom ena; and who were assigne d a spiritual status with Jesus in that"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"kingdom of th e Father which they had assisted in establishing for ever; and finally in the heaven of eternity. These, how ever, are mysteries that never coul d be unde rstood whilst a fictitious history of Jesus barred the way. Horus or Jesus in Amenta is the founde r of a kingdom for his Father in heaven, and for his followers in spirit - world, at the head of whom are the typi cal twelve who now becom e the children of Horus. This heaven for spirits made perfect is built upon founda tions that were laid in the mythol ogy . The R itual show s us how the four founda tions of this new heaven were laid by Horus in establishing the kingdom of God. First, he himself uni ted the “doubl e earth,” or the two worlds in one , by his death, burial and resurrection. Then he prays to his Father in h eaven that the “four brothers” of “his ow n body” or flesh and blood may be given to him as protectors of his ow n person “in dut iful service.” (Rit., ch. 112 , 11, 12; and 13, 8.) These four who were his brothers previous ly are the first of the twelve with H orus “on his papyrus,” or monol ith, or on the mount . The four brothers of Horus who were first chos en to becom e his children had been astronom ical as the ancient gods or divine suppor ts of the four qua rters, Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef and Kabhs enuf . With these four as suppor ts the founda tions of the kingdom of 782 heaven were laid, and “the fold” of the good shepherd established in Amenta, the earth of eternity. The expl anation here is that Horus was born one of the twelve like Joseph, but as the young solar g od, and belove d son of the father Ra, he obt ained his supr emacy as the head ove r all the rest of the brethren. Then the twelve became his founde rs, reapers, fishers, his disciples, pupi l - teachers or his children. As it is said in the Ritual (ch. 112 , 9, 10 ), these are “the circle of gods who were with him when Horus came to light in his ow n children”; that is, when the twelve pow ers were assimilated to the son of God, who was in them as they were in him at the second com ing. The gnos tic Jesus, the mystery - teacher of heaven, issues from the father in Amenta in the likeness of the dove as the expounde r of the greater mysteries to the twelve disciples. He now says to the disciples, “I will tell unt o you the mystery of the one and onl y ineffabl e, and all its ty pes, all its conf igur ations, all its regul ations . . . for this mystery is the suppor t of them all” (B. 2, 226 , Mead). This first ineffable mystery – looki ng within, as Pistis Sophi a phr ases it – is the mystery of God the Father. The first ineffable mystery – lo oki ng without – is the mystery of God the Son. It is the mystery of the one God in the two aspects of the Father and Son; hence the mystery of the one and onl y ineffable, “looki ng within,” is also the mystery of the one and onl y word or logos “looki ng withou t” (B. 2). Jesus says, “I am com e from the first mystery which is also the last” (B. 1, 1). The pow er now given by the first mystery, within the veil, to him who persona tes the mystery to men, looki ng without , is received by the Son from the Father, from w hom he emanated in the likeness of the dov e, or the hawk and not as previous ly in the likeness of a puny mortal, the human Horus — born of the virgin mother as her blind and deaf, her dum b and impube scent child. Pistis Sophi a show s the twofold character of the teaching on the earth and in Amenta. The “wisdom of Jesus” in the Apoc rypha was taught in parables. Jesus in the canoni cal Gospels speaks to the multitude in parables, and “without a parable spake he not hing unt o them” (Matt. XIII. 34) . But he says, “T he hour com eth when I shall no more"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"speak unt o you in parables, but shall tell you plainly of the Father” (John XVI. 25) . This prom ise is fulfilled by the Egyp to - gnos tic Jesus after his return to the regions from whence he came into the earth - life. He says to the disciples, “I have gone to the regions whence I came forth. From this day I will speak to you face to face without parable” (B. 1, 8, 9). Henceforth he speaks to them plainly of the Father, and, as it is freque ntly said, “without par abl e.” This is after that second adve nt which the Jesus in the Gospels is not permitted to fulfil, but which is still expe cted by the millenarians. Various sayings that were uttered aforetime in the earth - life are now expounde d by Jesus in Amenta “without parable.” He s ays to the disciples, “When I shall be king ove r the seven amens, the five suppor ts (or trees), the three amens, and the nine gua rdians; king ove r the child of the child, that is to say, ove r the twin - saviour s (or the doubl e Horus); king ove r the twelve sa viour s and the whol e num ber of perfect soul s — then all thos e men who shall have received 783 the mystery in (or of) that ineffable, shall be fellow - kings with me. They shall sit on my right hand and on my left in my kingdom ; therefore I said unt o you afor etime, ‘Ye shall sit on my right hand and on my left in my kingdo m, and ye shall reign with me’” (B. 2, 230) . Speaking of the greater mysteries, which are spiritual, Jesus says, “I hav e brought the mysteries which break all the bonds of the coun terfeit of the spirit ( i.e., the bonds of matter) and all the seals which are attached to the soul , the mysteries of which make the soul free, and ransom it from the hands of its parents, the rulers, and transform it into the kingdom of the true Father, the first Fat her, the first One, ineffable and everlasting mystery.” “For this cause have I said unt o you aforetime, ‘He who shall not leave father and mother to follow after me is not worthy of me.’ What I said then was, ye shall leave your parents the rulers, that ye may all be children of the first, everlasting mystery” (B. 2, 341) . This is the esoteric true interpretation of a saying that has been used exot erically (Matt. XIX. 29; Mark X. 29) . The par ents signi fied were not hum an, but thos e rulers in matter who prec eded the one God, the Holy Spirit, whom the Son made know n in the mysteries of Amenta unde r his title of Jesus Aber - Amentho. Again, he exclaims, “I said unt o you aforetime, ‘Seek that ye may find. ’” When he said that it signi fied “Ye shall seek out the mys teries of light , which pur ify the body of matter. I say unt o you , the race of hum an kind is material. I tore myself asunde r, I brought unt o them the mysteries of light to purify them . . . otherwise, no soul in the whol e of hum an kind woul d have been saved ” (B. 2, 249, Mead). Salvation here is brough t by means of the Son of God the Father becom ing incarnate to redeem the hum an race from matter by inculcating the virtues of purification which were taught by Horus or Jesus in the mysteries of Amenta. The gno stic Jesus also gives an esoteric rende ring of the Resurrection when he says that “All men who shall achieve the mystery of the resurrection of the dead which healeth from demoniac pos session s, and sufferings , and every disease, which also healeth the blin d, the lame, the halt, the dum b, and the deaf, (the mystery) which I gave you aforetime — whos oever shall receive of these mysteries and achieve (or master) when if he asks for anyt hing whatsoever . . . it shall at onc e be granted unto him” (B. 2, 279) . In t he resurrection the deceased transforms into a spirit, and it was in the mysteries of Amenta, and in the spirit - life, that these miracles were achieved, not in the life on earth."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"In the Ritual the deceased goe s where he pleases, doe s as he please, and assu mes whatsoever form he please as he masters mystery after mystery according to the gnos is. In the canoni cal Gospels we find an exot eric rende ring of these mysteries of Amenta, which the lie - enchanted Christian world believe in as historical miracles perfor med on earth by an historical Saviour named Jesus. There were seven preservers of the treasures of light in the celestial heptanom is, whether as rulers of cons tellations or as lords of pol e - stars, who first upr aised the starry firesticks which were kindl ed on the seven hills of heaven. The Pistis Sophi a show s the way in which an addi tiona l five were adde d to the seven in com pleting the first twelve saviour s of the treasure of light . This is indi cated when it is said (B. 2, 189) , “The twelve saviour s of the treasure, and the twelve 784 orders of each of them, which are the emanations of the seven voi ces and of the five suppor ts, shall be with me in the region of the inhe ritance of light ; they shall be kings with me in my kingdo m.” Which show s that the first twelve were com bined as the 7+ 5 that were pre - zodi acal, and that they are to becom e kings in the kingdom of eternal light ; which twelve were statione d in the solar zodi ac, or round the mount of glory. There is freque nt reference in Pistis Sophi a to the my stery of the five suppor ts. These are also figur ed as five trees, one of which is said to be “in the midst” (B. 1, 3 and 18, B. 2, 191 , 196) . These five tree - suppor ts, with the great one in their midst, are equi valent to the tree - type of eternal stability imaged as the Tat of Ptah (or as Ptah himself), which is a figur e of suppor t at the four corners with the pol e as the central great pillar of suppor t. It is also equi valent, as a sym bol , to the group of Horus and his four children in the Osirian mysteries. The Kamite twelve, as reapers in the harvest - field with Horus in Amenta, were also put toge ther from two earlier groups of seven and five, the same as in the gnos tic mysteries of the twelve suppor ts or the pol e - tree of heaven with twelve branches in the z odi ac. A sketch, how ever tentative, may be drawn of the original characters in the astronom ical mythol ogy, that were given the twelve throne s unde r one name or anot her in the final zodi ac. (1) Sut, (2) Horus, (3) Shu, (4) Hapi, (5) Ap - Uat, (6) Kabhs enuf , ( 7) Amsta, (8) Anup, (9) Ptah, (10) Atum , (11) Sau, (12) Hu, as the Kamite originals of the twelve who row ed the solar bark for Ra. We claim, then, to show that the typi cal Twelve, who are called apos tles or disciples in later langua ge, originated in twelv e characters which had represented twelve stellar pow ers in the astronom ical mythol ogy , and that these were afterwards given throne s or seats as rulers in the twelve signs of the zodi ac or in heaven. These, in the Pistis Sophi a, are designa ted twelve prese rvers or saviour s of the treasure of light. They form the cycle of twelve lesser gods around the sun - god on the sum mit of the mount , and are the same in signi fication, whether called gods in the Ritual or disciples of the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus in the Pistis Sophi a. These are at first the twelve with Horus the mortal, Horus in matter, Horus in the mythos , Horus the yout hful solar god . But when he makes his transformation and becom es the Son of God the Father, in the spirit life, they are his com panions in Ame nta; the twelve great spirits to whom he expounds the mysteries of the fatherhood; in shor t, they becom e the typi cal twelve as characters in the Kamite eschatology."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" According to Pistis Sophi a the localities of the teachings , whether in the midst of Amenta , or on the Mount of Olives, were celestial, and not munda ne. As it is said, “Jesus and his disciples remained in the midst of an aerial region, in the paths of the ways of which is below the sphe re.” This is the starting - poi nt from which the twelve accom p any him, through the regions that are mappe d out by the zodi acal signs ( Book s of the Sav iour in Pistis Sophi a, 359 - 371) , when they “go forth three by three to the four qua rters of heaven to preach the gos pel of the kingdom ” (390 ). It is also said that “Jes us stood at the altar, and cried aloud , turning tow ards the four angles of the world” (358 ). Here the “altar” is urano - 785 graphi c.

It was a saying of Philo’s that “the logos is doubl e.” This it is as the doubl e Horus, or as Jesus and the Christ, who was dua l as manifestor for the Virgin Mother and afterwards for God the Fa ther: doub le by nature, hum an and divine; doub le in matter and in spirit; doub le as child and as adul t, doubl e as the soul of bot h sexes. But when the word “logos ” com es to be used for the divine Reason we are in the midst of Greek metaphys ic and doc trinal mystification. These two, blende d in one person, cons tituted the doubl e Horus who was that doub le logos spoke n of by Philo, the figur e of which was founde d, as Egyp tian, on the two halves of the soul , or pair of gods in the mystery of Tattu (Rit., ch. 17) . Horus in these two characters was Horus with the tress of infancy, and Horus who becom es bird - headed at the transformation in his baptism. In his first adve nt Horus is the sow er in the seed - field of time; in his second he is the lord of the reapers in th e harvest of eternity. In the astronom ical mythos Horus was the king of one year. Naturally that was as ruler of the seasons in the annua l circuit of the sun. As the prince of eternity he was the typi cal adul t of thirty years, and lord of the Sut - Heb festi val, who is called “the living Horus, the pow erful bul l, lord of the festivals of thirty years,” which are termed “the years of Horus as King” ( Rec. of the Past, vol . 10, 34) . This was the roya l Horus in whom the child that was destined to be a king attain ed his manhood and assum ed his perfect sove reignt y. As already show n, the genesis of the doubl e Horus is por trayed in the Ritual (ch. 115) . In this description “two brethren com e into being. ” One of these was the wearer of the female lock, as the child - Ho rus. His birth was mystical. He was bot h male and female in person, or, as it is said, “he assum ed the form of a female with a lock,” the sign of pre - pube scence in either sex, and hence a type of bot h. He is also called “the Afflicted One,” which denot es t he mystery of the Virgin’s child. The second is “the active one of Heliopol is.” He is “the heir of the temple.” The first is also called the heir, and the second the heir of the heir. He was the divine might of “the son whom the father hath begot ten.” This was “the onl y - begot ten of the father.” Thus the “two brethren” were Horus the child"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"who wears the long tress that is the sign of either sex, and Horus the adul t who images the pow er and glory of the father as the god in spirit. Iusa, the Jesus of On, lik e Horus in the Osirian cult, was bor n bi - mater. His two mothers were Ius ā as and Neb - hetep, the two cons orts of Atum - Ra. These two mothers were at first two sisters in the mythos . One of them was the mother in the western mount ain, or later in the winter so lstice; the other gave birth to Horus on the hor izon in the eastern equi nox. It follow s inevitably that the Gospel - Jesus has two mothers who were sisters, and two places of birth and rebirth. When 786 the mythol ogy was merged in the eschatology, and Ra b ecame the father in heaven, he is described as having two com panions who are with him in the solar bark. In this text the two sister - mothers with whom Ra cons orts in the “divine ship” are Isis and Nut, who are the bringe rs - forth of Iusa or Jesus in his two fold character: child - Horus at his first adve nt being the son of Isis (Har - si - Hesi) the earth - mother, and in his second adve nt, or rebirth in spirit, the son of Nut, the heavenly mother. Such is the origin of the two mothers who were two sisters, and two c ons orts in two places of birth and rebirth represented in the “historic” narrative by Nazareth and Bethlehem as the birthpl ace of the shoot or natzer in Virgo, and the hous e of bread in Pisces, which two places of birth corresponde d to the two seasons of s eedtime and of harvest in the old Egypt ian year. Not onl y had Horus two mothers, Isis the virgin who conc eived him, and Nepht hys who nur sed him. He was brought forth singl y, and also as one of five brothers. Jesus has two mothers, Mary the Virgin who conc eived him, and Mary the wife of Cleopa s, who brought him forth as one of her children. He, likewise, was brough t forth singl y, and as one of five brethren. Horus was the son of Seb, his father on earth. Jesus is the son of Joseph, the father on earth. Horu s was with his mother the Virgin unt il twelve years old, when he transformed into the belove d son of God as the onl y - begot ten of the father in heaven. Jesus remained with his mother the Virgin up to the age of twelve years, when he left her to be about his father’s bus iness. From twelve to thirty years of age there is no record in the life of Jesus. Horus at thirty years of age became adul t in his baptism by Anup. Jesus at thirty years of age was made a man of in his baptism by John the Baptist. Horus in hi s baptism made his transformation into the belove d son and only - begot ten of the father, the holy spirit, represented by a bird. Jesus in his baptism is hailed from heaven as the belove d son and onl y - begot ten of the father God, the hol y spirit that is repre sented by a dove , which denot es the mystery of all mysteries conc erning the origin of the Egypt o - gnos tic Christ. The elder Horus came to earth in the body of his hum ility. The younge r came from heaven to wear the vesture of his father’s glory. The first w as the child of a baptism by water. The second is Horus the anoi nted or Christified; the oil upon whos e face reflected the glory of the Father. This was the dou ble baptism of the mysteries which is referred to in the Ritual by the priest who says, “I lustr ate with water in Tattu and with oil in Abydos ” (ch. 1). The dua lity manifested in Horus is show n when he is said to com e into being as two brethren, the same that Pistis Sop hia describes as “the Saviour - twins”; also when the transformer Kheper takes the f orm of two children — the elder and the younge r (Litany of Ra, 61). Again, in the seventy - first chapter of the Ritual, Horus"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"divinized is called “the ow ner of twin soul s, who lives in two twin soul s,” now uni ted in the eternal one . It is the pot ential dua lit y of sex in the child - Horus that will account for Queen Hatshepsu being designa ted Mat - Ka - Ra, the true likeness of the solar god , called the gol den Horus. She assum ed the habiliments of bot h sexes in toke n that the divinity was 787 dua l, and that this du ality was reproduc ed in the golden Horus whos e various pha ses of twinship include d the two soul s of sex. The gol den Horus was a supr eme type because of the twofold nature of the soul . It was this dua lity of Horus that is referred to by Hatshepsu when she s ays “the two Horus - gods have uni ted the two divisions (sout h and nor th) for me.” “I rule ove r this land like the son of Isis”; “I am victorious like the son of Nut”; which two likewise cons titute the doubl e Horus (Inscription: Records, vol . 12, 134) . It is said of the Osirian Horus in his twofold genesis from matter and spirit, “Horus proceedeth from the essence of his father and the corrupt ion which befell him” (Rit., ch. 78) . That is in the incarnation or immergence in matter as the oppos ite of spirit, ac cording to the later theology. Matter was at this time cons idered to be corrupt , and matter was maternal, but spirit was paternal and held to be divine. This will also expl ain the langua ge of the Ritual appl ied to Osiris when he is spoke n of as suffering d ecay and corruption, although inhe rently inviolate and incorrupt ible. The Osiris is embalmed in the divine type of him that never saw corrupt ion of matter in his incorpor ation, and all the evil that was derived from matter or the mother - nature has to be pu rged away in becom ing pure spirit like Horus at the second adve nt, when he has becom e the glorified, anoi nted, onl y - begot ten son. These were the two halves of a soul that was perfected in one ness, when Horus the child was blende d with Horus the adul t in th e marriage - mystery of Tattu, but not till then, and not otherwise. “The two Horus - gods ” is a title of the dua l Horus in the Pyramid - texts of Teta. The Olive is there said to be “the tree of the two Horus - gods who are in the temples.” Horus proclaims himsel f to be the issue of Seb (or Earth) whos e spous e is Isis, and affirms that his mother is Nut (ch. 42) . That is as the doubl e Horus. Horus the hum an soul on earth, and Horus as a spirit in Amenta; Horus bor n of two mothers who were two sisters, and who in t he different theologi es may be Neith and Sekhe t; Ius ā as and Nebhe tep; Isis and Nut; or two Marys, the two Meris who were at first the cow of earth and the cow of heaven. The child of Isis, the virgin heifer, was imaged as the calf, the red calf of sacrific e, also by the golden calf. After his death he rose again as the bul l in the likeness of his father, Osiris, the bul l of eternity. In the solar mythos he was bor n as a calf in the autum n equi nox that became a bul l in the Easter equi nox when this occurred i n Taurus. The type was repeated in the eschatology, when the manes is baptized to becom e the anoi nted in the character of Horus, who says, “I am the divine bul l, son of the ancestress of Osiris” (Rit., ch. 147) . The story of Jesus in the canoni cal Gospels follow s the totemic and mythical representation. Like Heitsi - Eibib and the hum an Horus he is the child of a virgin mother, the child of Mary onl y up to twelve years of age. Then the same change occurs with him as with the totemic you th at pube rty. He waxe s in force and stature, and is immediately “about thirty years of age.” This is the age of Amsu - Horus when he has made his transformation from childhood into manhood as the khe mt or typi cal adul t of thirty years,"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" 788 at which time he rises in Amenta as a sahu in the glorified body . The transformation of Horus who was a child of the mother alone , the immaculate virgin Neith, she who came from herself, is reproduc ed by Luke . When Horus the child transforms he is onl y twelve years of age. As a child with Mar y Jesus “waxed strong and was filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was upon him” (Luke II. 40) . The “grace of God” in Egypt ian is termed “khe mt” for grace and favour , and it is as Amsu - Horus that the child waxes strong and is in favour with, or endow ed by, God the Father. The way in which he “waxed in stature” can be seen in the effigy of Amsu - Horus, the divinized adul t who is the fulfiller at pube rty, mythical in the vernal equi nox, human in the harvest - field, and in the resurrection eschatologi cal. Bu t there had been no fecunda tor of a hum an mother by her ow n child since the days of utter and incestuous prom iscuity unt il the time when the mythical Horus (or Jesus) was made hum an in a persona l and historical character as the fertilizer of a Hebrew virgi n. The titles given to two Egypt ian priests who, in succession, present the deceased person to the gods are the An - mut - ef and Si - meri - ef. These are two titles of Horus in his two characters, first as the suppor t of his mother, and secondl y as the belove d son of his father. According to Egypt ian doc trine, the incarnation of the elder Horus was no isolated indi vidua l event. Nor was a soul made flesh in any singl e form of persona lity. It was the soul of the totem, family, stock or tribe, and lastly of the ind ividua l that was represented in the typi cal figur e of Horus or Jesus, child of the virgin mother. The soul of flesh that was bor n of the mother’s blood and made a type of in mythol ogy coul d no more be limited to a singl e person than the soul that was previ ous ly derived from air, earth, water or other element of life. It was in keeping with natural law that, when the pube scent virgin had conc eived, the incarnation of a hum an soul com menced. The mother, as the insufflator of that soul , was the mode and means of the incarnation which was effected in her blood, the flow of which was diverted to that end. The earliest embodi ment then of a soul that was derived from a hum an sour ce, and not simply from the elements of external nature, was by incarnation in the bloo d of the female who was mythically represented as the virgin mother. Thus the embodi ment of the human soul , when descent was traced from the mother onl y, was by incarnation, and not by begettal. As it is said of the elder Horus, Har - si - Hesi, he was bor n bu t not begot ten. The second Horus is begot ten of the father with a second mother Nut, who is adde d as the bringe r - forth above . It was com paratively late before the begettal of a hum an soul was ascribed to the indi vidua l proge nitor. As show n by Egypt in the mirror of the mythos , this was not earlier than the time of Ptah when the doubl e primitive essence was first recogni zed. A pair of soul s were then derived, the one from matter, the other from spirit; one from the motherhood, the other from the fatherhood, bot h of which were blende d in Ptah, the epicene parent. Child - Horus literally embodi es the first half of a soul that was hum an primarily and in a latter stage divine. In its first pha se this soul was derived from the mother’s blood and qui ckening breath as a body - soul . In its second, the sour ce is spiritual, a 789 "},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"causative sour ce from the father in heaven. For example, the Ka, or highe st soul of seven, is thought of in the Ritual as food or sustenance for the body and the means of duration. It is also lo oke d upon as a typi cal sacrifice to that end. Hence the speaker says, “Am I not the bul l of the sacrificial herd: are not the mortuary gifts upon me, and the pow ers above Nu” (ch. 105 ). Horus in the second pha se says, “I am a soul and my soul is divine. I am he who produc eth food. I am the food which perisheth not — in my name of self - originating force, toge ther with Nu,” the mother heaven. (Rit., ch. 85). This is he who pos sessed the “pow ers above Nu” as bringe r of the bread of life from heaven. “The bread o f God which com eth dow n out of heaven and giveth life to the world” was this imperishable food of soul that gave eternal life to men: and which when personi fied in Horus imaged a saviour from death in matter. When the Osiris deceased attains the type of th e sacred hawk he speaks of being inve sted with the soul of Horus. “Horus has inve sted (him) with his ow n soul for the seizing of his inhe ritance from Osiris at the Tuat.” “It is I, even I, who am Horus in glory” (ch. 78) . Horus had com e again in glory from the father as revealer of the bliss tow ards which his follow ers were bound (ch. 30 B ). When Horus was inve sted with the soul that is to be eternal, he becom es hawk - headed, in the likeness of the father, as Jesus was inve sted with that other bird of soul , t he gnos tic dove , when he was proclaimed to be the belove d son of God the father in his baptism. Paul’s doc trine of the resurrection is founde d on this mystery of the doubl e Horus. As taught by the Egypt ian wisdom , cont inui ty was condi tiona l, and the pow er of resurrection was persona lly secured by living the life of human Horus in fellow ship with his sufferings as the bearer of his cross by which the pow er of his resurrection in the after - life was attained through becom ing Horus the divinized adul t. Paul’s resurrection is obt ainable on the same condi tions of becom ing. As a struggl ing mortal he hope s “by any means” to attain “unt o the resurrection from the dead,” and says, “Not that I have already attained or am already made perfect; but I press on. ” In Paul’ s Epistles, Christ takes the place of Horus the anoi nted by whom the pow er of resurrection was made manifest in the mysteries, and the doc trine is the same as in the Ritual. In his ow n body and sufferings Paul was living the life and trying to emulate the character of Horus the mortal, whilst looki ng forward to the future fulfilment as it was portrayed in Horus glorified, whos e second com ing in Tattu as representative of Ra the hol y spirit and the pow er of resurrection is perfectly described by Paul. The ma nes in the Ritual says, “My enclosure is in Heaven,” as it was imaged on the mount ain summit in the eternal city. Paul writes, “Our ow n citizenship is in heaven: from whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall fashion anew the body of our hum iliation (which was one with the maimed, deformed and suffering hum an Horus, change d and glorified in the resurrection) that it may be conf ormed to the body of his glory” as it had been set forth scene by scene in the mysteries of Amenta by the divine scribe Taht, and preserved sufficiently intact to make it out as pre - historical and non - historical in the onc e - more living Egyp tian Book of the Dead (Phil. III. 20 - 21) . 790 The reason why the Virgin’s child shoul d make his change and pass away wh en twelve years old, and why the divinized adul t shoul d not take up the story unt il thirty years of age, to leave no record dur ing eighteen years, is to be expl icated by the Egypt ian"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"wisdom . It is because the two as doubl e Horus, or as the dua l Jesus Chris t, are no more than type s, and have no relation to an indi vidua l hum an history, Kamite, Hebrew, Persian, Gnos tic, or Christian; and in this uni ty, as before said, the different versions all agree. The Pistis Sophi a tells us more about the doubl e Horus, th e twofold Messiah, or twin Saviour , than all the records out side the Ritual put toge ther; more particularly in the astronom ical pha se of the mythos , onl y in this work the doubl e Horus is the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus, who doe s fulfil the second adve nt in accord ance with the map of mythol ogy. In one representation of his nature Horus is por trayed as the ruler, bot h in time and eternity. In time he is the foster - child of Seb, god of earth, brought forth by the mother - moon or Virgin in the zodi ac as the king of one year. This is Horus in the circle of the lesser year. At his second adve nt, as fulfiller on the vastest scale, he is said to travel the everlasting road as the ever - com ing prince of eternity. It was thus the first Horus, or Jesus, represented the solar go d that made the circuit of the signs in the forward motion through the zodi ac, whereas the second Horus, or Jesus, was the “traveller of the heavenly road,” the backw ard way in the huge st all - embracing circle of precession. The gnos tic Jesus represents th e doubl e Horus, human and divine, more fully and definitely than doe s the Jesus of the canoni cal Gospels and inde pende ntly of any persona l history. The first and second adve nts are bot h fulfilled by the Jesus of Pistis Sophi a. As the yout h of twelve years who was Horus the word, he instructs the disciples “up to the regions of the first statutes onl y” and is the teacher by means of parables. In his second adve nt he says, “I will speak with you face to face without parable.” He then unve ils and expounds the greater mysteries from centre to circum ference; from the first to the last. In the same gnos tic scripture Mary, the mother of Jesus, describes her son in accordance with the Egypt ian gnos is of the doubl e Horus, which was not derived from the canoni cal Gosp els. She thus addr esses him: “When thou wert a child before the spirit had descende d upon thee, when thou wert in the vineyard with Joseph, the spirit descende d from the height and came unt o me in the hous e (so) like unto thee I kne w him not , but thought t hat it was thou. And he said unt o me, ‘Where is Jesus, my brother, that I may go to meet him?’ And when he had said this unto me I was in doubt and thought it was a pha ntom tempting me. I seized him and bound him to the foot of the bed which was in my hous e.” Jesus, the mortal, is in the vineyard with Joseph. He hears Mary tell her naï f story to Joseph, and exclaims, “Where is he that I may see him? I am expe cting him in this place.” Mary cont inue s: “We went toge ther; we entered into the hous e, we found the spirit bound to the bed, and we gazed upon thee and him and found that thou wert like unt o him. And he that was bound to the bed was unloos ed. He embraced thee and kissed thee, and thou also didst kiss him; ye became one and the same being” ( P. S., B. 1, 120, Mead). 791 The two Jesuses, one in matter and one in spirit, or Jesus and the Christ, are identical with Horus, the prince in the city of the blind, and Horus who recons titutes his father. The meeting and the blendi ng of the two into one being is a gnos tic version of the mystery enacted in Tattu, where Horus in spirit meets with Horus the mortal, or Ra, the hol y spirit, embraces Osiris, the god in matter, and the pair are uni ted in the one doubl e"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"divine soul , which dw elleth in the place of establish ing a soul that is to live for ever (Rit., ch. 17, 16 - 18). In the ope ning chapter of Matthew’s Gospel the birth or generation of Jesus is called “the birth of Jesus Christ” (ch. I, 18) , a twofold character equi valent to that of the doubl e Horus, who was H orus in the flesh unt il twelve years of age, and Horus in the spirit from the age of thirty years. In other versions it is designa ted “the birth of the Christ.” But in accordance with the genui ne doc trine these are two births entirely distinct from each ot her, one for Jesus the Virgin’s child and one for the Christ as en effluence of the Holy Spirit emanating from the father in the form of a dove . Horus the Virgin’s child was bor n but not begot ten. At his second adve nt he became the divinized adul t as the o nly son begot ten of the father. This was the anoi nted son, and the anoi nted is the Christ, or Christified. The Christ was cons tituted by a begettal in spirit, when the spirit of God descende d from heaven as the dove , or the hawk of thirty years. There was no Christ unt il this change of state and type took place, and coul d be none without the necessary transformation by which it was accom plished. This was represented in the transformation and transubs tantiation of the mum my; in the baptism, circum cision, reg eneration, resurrection, and other mode s of the mystery, in which the body - soul was conve rted into a likeness of the eternal spirit; child - Horus into Horus the adul t, or Jesus into the Christ. But, to com pare as we proceed, the Word in the Kamite original was the first, or elder Horus, the child - Horus bor n of the Virgin Mother, he who issued out of silence as the inarticulate Logos (Rit., ch. 24) . He is called the Kheru in Egypt ian, which not onl y signi fies the Word, but also denot es a victim doom ed to be s acrificed, whether as the sufferer in the Tat, on the cross, or as the victim bound for slaught er. The second Horus, Horus in spirit, was the demons trator of eternal life in his resurrection from the sepul chre who is thus the word - made - truth that was perso nalized in Har - Ma - Kheru. This second Horus, who is the fulfiller that follow s the founde r, is referred to in the Gospel, parenthetically, in a way that blends or conf uses the two in one as the word. “And the Word became flesh, and dw elt among us (and we be held his glory, glory as of the onl y - begot ten from the father) full of grace and truth.” This is the merest passing allusion to the second Horus who was the anoi nted, onl y - begotten Son of God the Father; that is, to Horus, glorified, who follow ed hum an Hor us in the flesh, but coul d not be so easily made to look historical. The difference betwixt “the Son of Man” and “the Son of the wom an” may also be expl icated by the doc trine of the doubl e Horus. The “Son of Man” is a title of Jesus in the Gospels, which has been suppos ed to denot e the Son of God in the body of his hum anity. But 792 there was a “Son of Man” with an esoteric and mystical signi ficance, who was know n to the gnos tic teachers as Anthropos the son of Anthropos ; also as Monoge nes. Horus the Sav iour in his first adve nt was the child of Isis; that is, the son of wom an when the wom an is divine. In his second adve nt he is Iu, the Su or Son of God the Father, who became the Son of Man by title thus : Atum - Ra, son of Ptah, was the earliest god in the l ikeness of the perfect man. He was the first man in the same sense that the Jew - god Ieou in the Pistis Sophi a is called the “First Man” (333 ) as the divine begetter in the hum an"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"likeness. Ieou is the first man, and Iao is his son. Thus Iao, or Jesus, is “t he Son of Man.” He com es to earth as the one God in the form of man. This, in the Ritual, is the Egypt ian Jesus, Iu - em - hetep, the Son as Revealer of the Father Atum - Ra. The Father gives author ity to the Son “to execute judgm ent, because he is the Son of Ma n” (John V. 27) . That is at the second com ing, when he is to appe ar in the pow er and the glory of the Father, as did the second Horus with the oil upon his face which expr essed the glory of his divinity. This is “the Son of Man” who was in heaven whilst on the earth (John III. 13) , and who was to “com e in his glory, and all the ange ls with him” (Matt. XXV. 31) ; and who did so com e to judgm ent periodi cally as Horus in the mysteries of Amenta in the Gospels, where the two Horuses are cont inua lly confused toge ther by the conc octors of the hum an history, which was limited in locality as much as pos sible to this earth, to make it the more convi ncing in its appe al. In the Ritual Horus says: “I am the heir, the primary pow er of motion and of rest.” He was the heir in several characters. In the first he is the heir of Seb, the earth - father. In the second he is the heir of Osiris. When Osiris and Ra are blende d in one Horus becom es the heir of Ra, the father in heaven, as the inhe ritor and the giver of eternal life t o his follow ers. “The two earths have been decreed to Horus absolutely and without condi tion” (ch. 19). Because it was he who joined the two Horuses toge ther, and as Paul phr ases it, “made bot h one , and brake dow n the middl e - wall of partition, that he migh t create in himself of the twain one new man” (Eph. II. 14, 15). As son of Seb he is the Virgin’s child on earth, or in matter. As son of Osiris he is Amsu the Divine Manes in Amenta, and as Har - Sam - Taui he is the uni ter of the two earths in one , the conqu eror who makes the word of Osiris truth against his enemies, and thus becom es the founde r of the future kingdom of heaven for his father in the spirit as the doubl e Horus, he who wins and wears the doubl e diadem. The dua l Horus – Horus as mortal and Horus i n spirit, Horus as child of the Virgin and Horus begot ten of the Father, Horus twelve years of age and Horus the adul t of thirty years – is reproduc ed in the Gospels, how ever briefly, although the obj ect of the writers was not to distingui sh between the two natures, human and divine, whilst bot h were limited to the one life on this earth. Still, there is a dua l Jesus, or Jesus and the Christ, correspondi ng to the doubl e Horus. Child - Horus is por trayed as the child - Jesus up to twelve years of age. In his bapti sm by water it is prognos ticated by John that Jesus is to com e as the Baptizer with the Holy Spirit and with 793 fire. This is he “whos e fan is in his hand, ” and this is the transformation that was made by Horus the mortal when he became Horus rising in spirit with the fan, or khu, in his hand. Jesus in the same circum stances is the same character. The Spirit of God the Father descends upon him in the likeness of a dove , which indi cates that he is now the Christ in Spirit. The Virgin’s child has change d i nto the Son of God the Father, and the change is authenticated by the “Voice out of the heavens, saying, this is my belove d Son” (Matt. III. 16, 17) . The transaction is one of many that coul d onl y take place in the Earth of Amenta, but which are represente d perforce in the earth of time, because the matter of the pre - existent mythos was rende red as a human history in the exot eric Gospels."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":" It has to be repeated again and again that the primitive mysteries of totemism were cont inue d and develope d as spiritua l in the Egypt ian eschatology. Child - Horus at twelve years of age represents the typi cal yout h that passed into the ranks of the adul ts at pube rty, who was circum cised and regenerated in the rite of Baptism, blood, water or oil being used for the pur pos e o f lustration. This is repeated in the transformation of child - Horus into Horus the adul t, the child of twelve years into the sherau of thirty years; otherwise the child of the mother into the son of the father. Thus , the child - Horus becom es the belove d son of the father in his baptism, as did Jesus. In the Ritual (chapter of the baptisms) the speaker at the four th por tal says: “I have been baptized in the water with which the Good Being was washed at the time when he had his cont ention with Sut (Satan), and when the victory was given to him.” In the baptism at the fifth portal, he says he has washed himself, or has been baptized in the water that Horus was washed in when he becam e the beloved son of his father, Osiris. “Su - meri - f” is the son whom the father love s, hence the belove d son, the anoi nted, or the Christ when Christified. In one of these baptisms (eight h por tal) the baptizer is mentione d by name as Anup. He was the typi cal baptizer, the embalmer and anoi nter of the dead from of old, before the time of the solar Horus, or Osiris. “I have been washed in the water wherein the God Anup baptized when he performed the office of embalmer and binde r - up of the Mum my.” Or, as it is otherwise said, when he became the chief minister to Osiris in the later cult. Here we find (1) that Anup was the baptizer in preparing Osiris (or the mortal Horus) to becom e the Horus in spirit, the anoi nted and belove d son of the father in the rite of embalmment, or baptism; that Osiris, or Horus, was baptized preparatory to or at the time of his cont est with Sut (Satan); and that the baptism of Horus took place when he became chief minister, the belove d son Su - meri - f of his father, he who had previous ly been the pillar of suppor t (An - mut - f) to his mother. (Naville, Texts; Budge , Bo ok of the Dead, ch. 145. ) There is a baptism in the Ritual which takes place at the time when Horus makes his transformation into the menat, the bird of soul as a swallow , dove or pigeon. That is when mortal Horus has becom e a spirit (ch. 85, 1), with the head of a bird, whether as the Divine hawk or the dove , and the same transformation takes place in the baptism of Jesus, when the dove from heaven descende d and abode upon him as the sign to show that he was now the Son of the Father in Spirit. 794 Ther e was a doubl e baptism in the ancient mysteries: the baptism by water and the baptism by spirit. This may be traced to the two lakes of heaven at the head of the celestial river in the region of the nor thern pol e, which were also repeated as the two lakes of pur ification in Amenta. The manes says, “I pur ify me in the sout hern tank, and I rest me at the nor thern lake” (ch. 125) . They will account for the two forms of baptism mentione d in the Gospels. John baptizes with water, Jesus with the Holy Spirit and w ith fire. This twofold baptism had been presented by the two celestial lakes or pool s that were conf igur ated in the northern heaven which are to be read of in the Ritual (ch. 97) as the baptistery of Anup. One of these was the lake of pur ification by water ; the other by spirit. This latter was the lake of Sa by name, in which the gods themselves were wont to be vitalized in their baptism. Sa signi fies spirit; the Sa was a divine or magical fluid which made immortal; and the baptism in this sacred lake of Sa was literally a baptism of"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"the hol y spirit. The scene of the baptism by John can be paralleled in the Ritual (ch. 97) . Horus claims to be the master of all things , includi ng the water of the Inunda tion. When he com es to be baptized, it is “said at the boa t,” called “the staff of Anup, ” “Look upon me, oh ye great and might y Gods , who are foremost among the spirits of Annu; let me be exalted in your presence.” The plea for baptism is very expr ess. “Lo, I com e, that I may pur ify this soul of mine in the most high degree : let not that impediment which com eth from you r mout h be issued against me, let me be purified in the lake of propi tiation and of equi poi se : let me plunge into the divine pool beneath the two divine sycam ores of heaven and earth.” After the bap tism, he says, “Now let my Fold be fitted for me as one victorious agai nst all adv ersaries who woul d not that right shoul d be done to me. I am the onl y one just and true upon the earth” (Rit., ch. 97, Renouf ). In the Gospel, when Jesus com eth “unt o John” =A nup the baptizer, “John woul d have hinde red him.” “But Jesus answering said unt o him, suffer me now for thus it becom eth us to fulfil all right eous ness” (Matt. III. 14, 15) — a proba ble rendering of the Egypt ian word Maat! In the Egypt ian baptism three eleme nts are invol ved: the elements of water, fire and spirit. Osiris represented water, Horus the solar fire, and Ra the hol y spirit. These elements agree with the three persons in the trinity that were Osiris the father, Horus the son, Ra the hol y spirit, in whos e names as father, son and holy ghos t the rite of baptism still cont inue s to be practised. The second character was fulfilled by Horus when he became bird - headed as a spirit in the resurrection. This fulfilment is obvi ous if not perfectly accom plished on behalf of Jesus after his baptism. “And Jesus, full of the hol y spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spi rit” (Luke IV. 1, 2). He also returns “in the pow er of the Spirit” (IV. 14) . The same change has occurred with him as with Horus in t he same circum stances. It is now that he makes the announc ement. “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anoi nted me to preach good tidings to the poo r: he hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recove ry of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. To - day hath the scripture been fulfilled in your ears.” This was the fulfil - 795 ment, according to Jewish prophe cy, of that second adve nt which took place, and coul d onl y take place in spirit - world, and not in the life on earth, except as a performance in the religious mysteries. Anot her episode in the canoni cal account of Jesus will serve to illustrate the transformation from the child of twelve into the adul t of thirty years. When Jesus was twelve years old, says Luke , his parents went up to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passove r. When they were returning to Nazareth they found the boy had tarried behind in Jerusalem. After three days they discove red him in the temple si tting in the midst of the doc tors, bot h hearing them and asking them que stions . They were astoni shed; and his mother said unt o him, “Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behol d, thy father and I sought thee sorrow ing. ” And he said unt o them, “How is it y e sought me? Wist ye not that I must be on my father’s bus iness?” — or must be about the things of my father. This, in the original, is a legend of the infancy and of the time when the child - Horus made his transformation into Horus the adul t, to becom e the f ulfiller for his father, “and, ” as he says, “to take the lead. ” Osiris in his maimed and mutilated state was represented by the"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"child of Isis, the Horus of twelve years, or the moon in the four teen days of waning light , or the sun in the winter solstice. T hus Isis in search of the scattered limbs and members of Osiris was in search of her child (Rit., ch. 157) . As it is said in the “Hym n to Osiris,” “she went round the world lamenting him. She stoppe d not till she found him. . . . She raised the remains of the god of the motionl ess heart. She extracted his essence. She bor e a child. She suckled her babe in secrecy. No one kne w where it happe ned” ( Records, vol . 4, pp. 101 - 2). In the text quot ed from the Ritual the child of the papyr us - marshes has change d and com e forth as the ruler, he who fight s the great battle against Sut. Horus was then about his father’s bus iness. He had now transformed from the child of Isis onl y, or Horus in the secret place, into Horus the begot ten of the father, the Horus of thirty ye ars. This is the original of the story told by Luke of the child - Christ when he was twelve years of age. Mary, like Isis, searches the districts for her missing child, who is found after three days, which is the lengt h of time assigne d to the transformatio n of Osiris for renewal in the moon . Meantime he, too, has “made a great battle,” asserted his supr emacy, and “ordered what was to be done ,” although the nature and mode of the cont est have been change d. He has also given terror and caused his mother to fe ar. When reproached by his mother, who had sought him sorrow ing, he asks his mother and father if they did not know that he must be about his father’s bus iness, or attendi ng to the things of his father. There is a chapter of Isis seeking for child - Horus a t his goi ng forth from the marshes in which the papyr us grew; that is, when Horus is the child of twelve years who transforms into the living likeness of the father as the man of thirty years. A vul ture with out spread wings is the emblem of the seeking mot her, who goe s about searching the “mysterious retreats” of Horus in which he hides himself after leaving the marshes. Her son goe s forth to face misfortune , to com mand the chiefs of the district. He fight s a great battle. He calls to remem - 796 brance wh at he has done , impos es fear on them, establishes his terror, his mother Isis having made charms for the protection of her child (Rit., ch. 157; Naville and Renouf ). Horus in his two characters of the child and the adult is called the lad in the count ry, a nd the yout h in the city or in the tow n (Rit., ch. 85) . As the lad in the count ry he is the child with Isis the virgin mother, and Seb the earth - god , who was his foster - father dur ing his childhood. As the you th in tow n he is in his father’s hous e, and is “ the heir of the temple” in Heliopol is (ch. 115) . When Horus the child passes into Horus the adul t he becom es the heir to the “things of his father.” The Egypt ian word “khe tu” for “things ” is most idiom atic, and “the things of my father” in the Greek is uni que ly perfect as a rende ring of the Egypt ian “khe tu.” It is as the you th in tow n or in Heliopol is=Jerusalem, that Horus says, “I am a soul , and my soul is divine”; this was derived from Ra, his father in heaven: “I take the lead. I put an end to darkne ss. I put a stop to evil.” And when Horus goe s to Abydos to see his father Osiris, all the great gods , toge ther with the groups of the gods , com e forth to meet and greet him with their acclamations . He is hailed by them as “the king of hos ts” who com eth to un ite and take pos session of the two worlds. His father’s hous e is seized (in the juridical sense of seizin or feuda l pos session) “in virtue of the writs,” which have"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"been issued on behalf of the divine heir, “the heir of the temple” (ch. 138) , the “son whom the father hath begot ten” (ch. 115) . Abydos is the mythical rebirth - place of Osiris, and it was there that Horus took pos session of his father’s hous e. In the Gospel it is Jerusalem. Twice ove r in one brief chapter of the Ritual (115t h) Horus is called “t he heir of the temple.” He says, “It is with reference to me that the gods say, Lo, the afflicted one is the heir of Annu .” This was as Horus the divine adul t, “active and pow erful is the heir of the temple; the active one of Annu, the son whom the father hath begot ten.” In the Ritual the temple is in Annu; it is otherwise termed the hat - saru, or hous e of the prince. Horus enters this as the child of the mother, and he com es forth as the son of the father, and the wielder of the whip as the sym bol of his so vereignt y. Here is the parallel to the child - Jesus sitting in the temple as a teacher of the teachers, laying dow n the law to the masters of the law. As the Word of truth, Horus “assembles the chiefs of truth” or law. These are the acolytes who sit with Os iris in the great hall of Maat. The lords of truth (or the law) collected there to watch ove r iniquity, as they sit in “Seb’s great dw elling,” recogni ze the lad as the lord of justice, and delegate author ity to him as their chief. The original of a scene i n the temple is traceable in the “Hym n to Osiris.” Horus has grow n strong in the dw elling of Seb. “The divine com pany rejoices when the son of Osiris com es, even Horus steadfast of heart, with (or as) the word made truth: the son of Isis, the flesh of Osir is.” Horus in the hall of Mati was in the hous e of his father Osiris seated on the judgm ent - seat surrounde d by the chiefs of truth as the lad who is acknow ledge d now to be the uni versal master, and the lord of law and of very truth itself. The father’s hou se in the Gospels becom es the temple at Jerusalem, the “chiefs of truth” collected there are the doc tors or Tanna im, and 797 the divine child Horus, the roya l Horus, wearer of the doubl e crow n, has been conve rted into the child of Joseph the carpenter. According to John, the first thing that Jesus did after his baptism was to prove his pow er by turning water into wine. This is immediately follow ed by his foray in the temple at Jerusalem. He makes a scour ge of cords, where Horus, as “heir of the temple,” wields the whip or flagellum and drives out thos e who have made the Father’s hous e a hous e of merchandi se or den of thieves. He thus prove s himself to be, like Horus, “active and pow erful,” “the heir of the temple” who hath the might divine as the onl y son , whom “the Father hath begot ten,” in the one instance by vanqui shing Sut on the pinna cle, and in the other by driving out the evil - doe rs=the Sut - Typhoni ans from the temple (John II. 14 - 17) , bot h of which events are stated in two different Gospels to have follow ed immediately after the baptism, in which occurred the transformation of Jesus into the dove - headed Son of God the Father. In the Ritual the subj ect of chapter 138 is the “Entry into Abydos ,” and it describes a scene of trium ph for Horus analogous to the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem. He is the lord of life in Abydos . He exclaims, “O gods of Abydos . Let us be joyf ul. Do not hinde r me from seeing my father. I am the Horus of Khem - Ka, the red shoot (or branch= natzer) which not hing can injure, whos e ha nd is strong against his enemies: avenge r of his father, striking his enemies, repelling violence: gove rnor of multitude s, chief of the earth, who takes pos session of his father’s dw elling with his arms.” The"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"obj ect of this trium pha nt entry is for the divi ne heir to take pos session of his father’s dw elling. This he effects by force of arms. “And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all that bought and sold in the temple and ove rthrew the tables of the mone y - change rs.” And he saith unt o them, “ It is written my hous e shall be called a hous e of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbe rs” (Matt. XXI; Rit., 138 ). Amsu - Horus rises in Amenta with the signs of gov ernm ent upon his shoul der in the shape of the crook and the whip (or khu) . As bearer of the crook he is a form of the Good Shephe rd who com es in that character to look after his father’s flock or herd. As wielder of the whip he came to drive out and scour ge the enemies of his father. The Christ who is por trayed as the Good Shephe rd in one ch aracter is also described as making his adve nt with the fan in his hand, which in the hand of Amsu is the flail or whip. This, in anot her scene, becom es the whip or scour ge with which Jesus drives out the illegal occupa nts of the temple. The Passove r of th e Jews being at hand, Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and “he found in the temple thos e that sold oxe n and sheep and dove s, and the change rs of mone y sitting” toge ther in this com pound of menagerie and mart, which is as if the Stock Exchange and Smithfield Mar ket met toge ther in St. Paul’s Cathedral. “And he made a scour ge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, bot h the sheep and the oxe n: and he pour ed out the change rs’ mone y and ove rthrew the tables, and to them that sold the dove s he said, take these thin gs hence; make not my father’s hous e a hous e of merchandi se” (John II. 13 - 17) . This por trait of the 798 wielder of the whip driving out the sheep and oxe n is the reverse to that of the good shephe rd with the crook , and this historic fulfilment of the myt hos is a very pue rile parody of Amsu - Har - Tema, the doe r of justice, scourging the foes of his father out of the temple in his cons um ing fury of resentment, so soon as ever he had taken in hand the whip of his divine author ity. Horus is not mentione d as rid ing into Abydos on an ass, but in the cult of Atum - Ra the solar disk was hauled up from Amenta by the ass - eared god Iusa, and Iusa was the original rider on the ass or the foal of the ass. Immediately follow ing this clearing out of the temple it is said t hat Jesus hunge red — and seeing a fig - tree by the wayside he came to it and found not hing thereon. He is described as com ing to the fig - tree hung ry, when figs were not in season, and because there was no fruit upon it he sterilized it for ever, “and immediat ely the fig - tree withered away” (Matt. XXI. 19) . This is in the character of Horus the avenge r, who com es to the fig - tree in the Aarru - garden and says, “I am Amsu - Horus, the avenge r of his father the Good Being. I carry out for my father the overthrow al of all his enemies,” includi ng the fig - tree, as it is rende red in the Gospels. In the Ritual the cedar is quot ed in the place of the sycamore - fig. The speaker, in addr essing the keeper of the twenty - first gate, says, “Thou keepest the secrets of the Avengi ng God (Har - Tema) who caus es the She nnu - tree to bear no fruit” (Rit., ch. 145) . The earth - life ceases for Horus at the age of twelve. Partly because he typi fied an impot ent or impube scent body - soul in matter, mere soul of the mother - blood, and the differenc e between child - Horus and Horus divinized was expr essed by the difference betwixt the child of twelve and the perfect man of thirty years. It ceased by the transformation into that which was typi cal of anot her life. Child - Horus passed away from"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"earth to ma ke his change or to be made “a man of” in the mysteries of Amenta. He rose again as Amsu in ithypha llic form to show the pot ency of soul or spirit in the after - life by means of the nature figur e. Thus , according to the genui ne mythos , at the time of the ba ptism in the Jordan, when Jesus had attained the age of twelve, the earthly life came to an end, the mother’s child had for the first time found his father. But that was not in this world. The second Horus was begot ten in Amenta, not on earth. Also the bap tism of regeneration, and other of the spiritual mysteries, occurred in that earth of eternity and not upon the earth where mortal beings dw ell. In the totemic mysteries circum cision was a rite of pube rty which marked the transformation of the yout h into t he man, and this, like other typi cal custom s, was cont inue d in the religious mysteries. When Horus makes his change and rises in Amenta as Horus the adul t, it is in a figur e that has suffered the rite of circum cision, as the por traits of the risen Amsu pro ve. Thus , circum cision, like baptism, was a rite of regeneration and resurrection or re - erection from the dead; that is, from the state of the inert Osiris, the impube scent Horus, or, doc trinally, from the status of the unc ircum cised, the unba ptized, who w ere “unhous elled, una noi nted, una nne aled,” and who might thus remain in mum mied immobi lity. The first Horus is impube scent; the second is circum cised to show that he has risen in the likeness of the father, “full of 799 grace and truth,” “the image of th e invi sible god , the first - bor n of all creation. ” Amsu - Horus, the risen Sahu, is identical doc trinally with the gnos tic Christ of Paul, who tells his hearers that they have been circum cised in him who include s the plerom a of the godhe ad bodi ly, “with a cir cum cision not made with hands , in the put ting off the body of the flesh, in the circum cision of Christ; having been bur ied with him in baptism, wherein ye were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead” (Col. II . 10 - 12) . When Horus rises from the dead he wields the weapons and he bears the sym bol s of his sove reignt y. He has been baptized and circum cised, or lustrated with water, with oil, with the Holy Spirit, and crowned with the doubl e feather. The doc trine is the same whether the risen one be Horus or the Christ; and there was not hing historical in the death, the baptism, the circum cision, the resurrection of Amsu - Horus, either as the Karast mum my or the Christ. A difficulty all through with the conc octers of the Gospel history was this dua l character of Horus in two lives and two worlds. They had onl y the one lifetime to go upon in one world. Jesus had to becom e bird - headed in the hum an lifetime and on earth. Whereas the hum an Horus made his change into the “s econd - bor n, the golden hawk,” after he had passed into Amenta. It was as a spirit in the earth of eternity that he became bird - headed in the likeness of his father Ra, not on the earth of Seb, where he was imaged in the likeness of mortality, as the hum an Horus. Still, the risen Jesus acts the part of Horus in issuing from the sepul chre as a spirit. After his death and burial, he appe ars to the disciples in the rôle of the second Horus who represents the Father after the resurrection in spirit. He tells the m that the Father hath sent him. “And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit” (John XX. 21, 22) . This is in the character of the hawk - headed Horus who, as the son of Ra, is given pow er from the Father to breathe the Holy Spirit. It is a mystery of Amenta, with no meaning elsewhere. In this the Horus who had conque red death and risen again in"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"trium ph as the Belove d Son of God the Father, became the representative of the Holy Spirit with pow er to impart it to the breathless one s, and raise them from the dead; he who, as Horus or Jesus, in this character was “the resurrection and the life.” But, in the gos pels of the Sarkol atræ it had to be demons trated that the risen Christ was not a spirit or anyt hing supe r hum an, if the history was to be accepted as simply hum an and limited to the life on earth. Horus, in his first adve nt, was the word - made - flesh in mortal gui se, according to the Kamite doc trine of the incarnation. In his second adve nt, he is the word - made - truth as Horus the fulfiller in the spirit, according to the Kamite doc trine of the resurrection. In his baptism, Horus the word - made - flesh transformed into the word - made - truth, according to the Kamite doc trine of baptismal regeneration, each of which doc t rines was of necessity perverted in the exot eric rende ring. The scene of this rebirth in Amenta was unde rneath the tree of dawn — the tamarisk, persea, olive, or sycamore - fig - tree. The desire of the manes is literally to be with Horus under the fig - tree at t he time of his resurrection from Amenta, a figur e that was derived from the 800 Horus - sun arising from unde r the tree of dawn in the mythol ogy. Horus reborn as the sun of morning, says, “I am the babe. I am the god within the tamarisk - tree” (ch. 42) . The olive was anot her tree of dawn. The transformation of Osiris into Horus, or of Amsu into Horus the bird - headed, was effected unde rneath this tree. One of the seven khus , or great spirits who are the com panions of Horus in his resurrection is named Kheri - b akhu - f or “he who is unde r the olive - tree,” which is equa ted by the fig - tree in the Gospel of John for the green tree of dawn. On a papyr us at Dubl in the Osiris prays that he may be unde r the sycamore (fig - tree) of Hathor at the rising of Horus ( Trans . Soc i. Bib., vol . VIII, p. 218) . This, according to John, was the place where Nathaniel had been with Jesus before the two had ever met on earth (John I. 48, 49). “Now ,” says Andr ew, “we have found the Christ.” He calls upon Nathaniel to “com e and see.” Jesus recogni zes him. Nathaniel says, “whence know est thou me?” “Jesus answered and said unt o him, before Phillip called thee, when thou wast unde r the fig - tree, I saw thee” (John I. 41 - 49) . The two characters of the doub le Horus, com monl y ascribed to Jesus, ar e also por trayed upon the gnos tic monum ents in the Rom an catacom bs. In one character he is the little old and ugl y Jesus. In the other he corresponds to Horus of the beautiful face. The first is the suffering Messiah, the despised and afflicted one , who wa s cons idered to be of an ignobl e origin com pared with that of Horus the younge r. He was the child of the Mother onl y; the soul in matter; the heir of Seb, and therefore of the earth earthy. Horus the younge r is the man from heaven; the immortal Son of the Divine Man who is in heaven, Horus in his glory and his majesty. These often occur toge ther on the same monum ents in their irreconc ilable cont radiction of each other (Bosio, Rom . Sot t. ). But the “elder Horus” did not mean the aged Horus, for he was at the same time the child - Horus. The title has been misinterpreted by the artists of the catacom bs who have represented “the afflicted one ,” the Man of sorrow s, as diminut ive, and pensive, old and ugly, whereas, according to the true type , he was never more than twelve years of age, and always wore the lock of childhood. “Old Child” was his name."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" Horus in his childhood was the sow er of the seed in the fields of his father. This Mystery follow s that of the great battle in which Osiris is avenge d and the associate s of Sut are slain in the shape of goa ts, and the fields are prepared for the seed by being manur ed with their blood . The vigne tte is given by Naville from the tracing taken by Lepsius of the now lost papyr us Busca. The picture represents the great hoe ing in Tattu. The long text at Dende rah (Mariette, tom . 4, pl. 39) cont ains directions to be obs erved on the festival com memorative of the ancient custom . Two black cow s are put unde r a yoke of am - wood , the plough is of tamarisk - wood , and the share of black br onz e. The ploughm an goe s behind, with a cow led in a halter. A little child with the side - lock attached to its head is to scatter the seed in the field of Osiris. Barley is sow n at one end, spelt at the other, and flax between the two. The Kher - heb in chie f recites the office for the sow ing of the field (Renouf , Book of the Dead, ch. 18, not e 9). The child with the side - lock represents the Horus of twelve years who leaves his mother at that age and goe s forth to be 801 “about his father’s bus iness.” That bus iness, as here show n, was the sow ing of seed for Osiris, the divine hus bandm an. Jesus at twelve years of age is said to leave the Virgin on his father’s bus iness for the pur pos e of sow ing the seed of the word; the word that was to be made truth in the f ields of divine harvest. Osiris is the hus bandm an as God the father, and child - Horus the seed - sow er as the son, in hum an form. Sut, the anthropom orphi c Satan, is the oppone nt of Horus in the harvest - field; he undoe s what Horus doe s. As the prince and pow er of drought and darkne ss, he is busy in the night . He sow s the tares, the thor ns and thistles, the weeds or “devil’s - dung” amongs t the good seed of Osiris sow n by Horus. Horus has his assistants in the seed - sow ing and the reaping of the harvest. These are groupe d as the two, the four, the seven, and finally the typi cal twelve who are the reapers in the Aarru - fields, which are in the earth of eternity. There is no exact parallel scene in the canoni cal gos pels to this of the seed - sow ing in the Ritual, but the child that sow s the seed in his father’s field, survives in the Gospels of the Infancy. As we read in the Gospel of Thom as (ch. 12) at the time for sow ing the child went out with his father to sow corn in their field, and when his father sow ed, the child Jesus also sow ed one grain of corn. And having reaped and threshed it, he made “a hundr ed qua rters of it,” and bestow ed the corn upon the poor . “Now Jesus was eight years old when he wrought this miracle,” dur ing his first adve nt. At his second coming, Hor us is the reaper in the fields of harvest. This is he “whos e fan (or flail) is in his hand” when he rises from the sepul chre. The harvest at the end of the world was reaped by the follow ers of Horus at the end of the age or cycle of time. It was periodi c i n the mythol ogy, like the harvests of the earth, and therefore periodi c in the eschatology. He that sow ed the good seed in the Egypt ian mysteries was Horus the son of Isis, or the hum an Horus, who reappe ars as Amsu the hus bandm an in the fields of divine ha rvest, otherwise as Horus - Khut i the master of joy with his twelve follow ers who are the reapers of the harvest in Amenta. This is por trayed bot h in the nether - world and in the uppe r paradise of Hetep on the sum mit of the mount . The obj ect of the beatified deceased is to attain the harvest - field in Hetep, that he may take pos session of his allotment there, and be in glory there, and plough and sow and reap the harvest there for ever, “doi ng whatsoever things were done"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"on earth,” but change d and glorified. Th is was to be attained, not at the end of the world, but at the end of all the trials, the pur ifications and pur gatorial pains, the strenuous efforts made in climbing up the ascent to reach at last the paradise of rest upon the sum mit; the place of re - union and reconc iliation; the land of the tree of life and the water of life, of perenni al plenty and of everlasting peace. Here the reapers, called the “ange ls” in the Gospel, show the harvest - field is not upon the earth of time. They are the twelve with Horus in the fields of divine harvest. Horus tells Osiris at the harvest - hom e that he has cultivated his corn for him in the Aarru - fields of peace; and in the person of Har - khut i with the twelve as lord of spirits gathered in the harvests of eternity. Two oppo site characters are assigne d to Jesus in the Gospels, in one of which he com es with peace, in the other he is the bringe r of the 802 sword. He is the bringe r of peace on earth (Luke II. 14; John XVI. 27) , who says he has not com e to bring peace on earth (Luke XII. 51) . “I came not to send peace but a sword” (Matt. X. 34) . Horus had appe ared previous ly in these two rôles. He is “Horus the peaceful.” As Iu - em - hetep he com es to bring peace and good fortune on earth and make wars to cease. Horus also com es wi th the sword as the avenge r of his father when he pierces Sut to the heart, and anni hilates the rebel pow ers. Har - tema is a title of the second Horus. The word Ma for justice also signi fies the law. And he who reveals and makes justice visible is the Horus who not onl y fufils the word by making it truth, but who also com es to fulfil the law , or maat. This is the character assigne d to the Jesus of the Gospels, who says, “Think not I came to destroy the law. I came not to destroy but to fulfil. Verily I say u nto you , till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law till all things be accom plished” (Matt. V. 17, 18) . This law is the maat of the Ritual. And in the Gospel the speaker assum es the pos ition of Har - tema, who was the fulfiller of justice or the law. In the earth - life Jesus is the word or speaker in parables. In that way the “Inarticulate Discour se” of Horus is assigne d to Jesus, with the usual misrende ring of the hidde n meaning, as the matter of parables wh ich no one but the dul y initiated coul d pos sibly unde rstand. Inde ed they were prepensely intende d to be non - intelligible to all others. As it is said to the disciples, “Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest in pa rables, that seeing they may see not and hearing they may not unde rstand (Luke VIII. 10). Child - Horus ope ned his mout h in Sign - langua ge onl y. Jesus onl y ope ns his in parables. At his second com ing he is to speak no more in parables but to tell the disciple s plainly of the father. That is how the twofold character of Horus was to be fulfilled by Jesus, and as it had been already fulfilled by the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus in “Pistis Sophi a.” Also, how ever indi rectly, Jesus is identified with the child - Horus as the teacher who was a babe and suckling and who exclaims, “I am the babe” (repeated four times) in the Ritual (ch. 42) . Jesus says, at the time when “he rejoiced in the hol y spirit” (Luke X. 21) , “I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou di dst hide these things (the things which had been given him to teach) from the wise and unde rstandi ng and didst reveal them unt o babes. (Such babes as Horus with the side - lock.) All things have been delivered unt o me of my father and no one know eth who the son is save the father.” But in the cour se of making out a hum an history from the mythos and the eschatology in the Ritual, Jesus has been forced to remain on the"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"earth not onl y after he was twelve years of age but after he was thirty years, when he ought to have been a manes in Amenta. The “Pistis Sophi a” retains the true version of Horus, or Jesus, in Amenta, when it says, “Jesus spake these words unt o his disciples in the midst of Amenta” (390) and describes him in the character of Aber - Amentho, the lord of Amenta, in which he rose again trium pha nt ove r death. That which was taught by Horus, or Jesus, the Word in the sayings and parables, was made truth by Horus - Makhe ru, the fulfiller indeed. And this fulfilment at the second com ing is imitated by Jesus when 803 he says, “These things have I spoke n unt o you in parables (or in prove rbial sayings ). The hour com eth when I shall no more speak unt o you in parables but shall tell you plainly of the father” (John XVI. 25) . The teaching of child - Horus did not c ont ain a revelation of the father in spirit. This was the mission of Har - Makhe ru, the fulfiller of the word in truth, as it was acted in the mysteries to be repeated in the mortal life, for hum an use. This second part is prom ised in the Gospels but remaine d a matter of prophe cy that never was fulfilled. Albeit the doc trine survives in the Christian “Word - of - truth” with no founda tion in the historical life of Jesus. The Christian adve nt of Horus - Makhe ru, the word - made - truth, the belove d son who represents th e father, from beginni ng to end of the Ritual, still awaits the endi ng of the world or that last day which was annua lly solemnized in the Egypt ian mysteries. As Paul the Christian Gnos tic put s it, “the kingdom of God is not in word, but in pow er.” That is in fulfilment as the word - made - truth (1 Cor. IV. 20). The first Horus was the word, the second is the power: the heir of glory who hath the might - divine of the onl y - begot ten Son of God the Father (Rit., ch. 115 ). This, wherever met with, is Egypt ian first of all as Horus, who was the word or logos in one pha se of character, and in the other of two he was the pow er. As the word he represented the virgin mother. As the pow er he imaged the glory of the father. Horus was the word in the earth of Seb, and he is the pow er in the earth of Sut. In the canoni cal and apoc rypha l Gospels bot h the word and pow er have been cont inue d and fused into one , as there was but one life to be represented, that on earth, in the “history.” It is said of the child - Jesus in the Gospel of Thom as (chap. 4), “Every word of his becom eth at onc e a deed.” “Every word of his is at onc e a deed” (ch. 17) . “Every word he speaketh forthw ith becom eth a deed” (4). The sum and subs tance of the doc trine of Maati is to make the word of Osiris truth ag ainst his enemies. Elder Horus was that word in person. The word was also uttered in dark sayings which cons tituted the ancient wisdom . Then it became the written word of Taht Aan, the scribe of the gods , and Horus at his second com ing was the divine ensam ple of the son who made the word of Osiris truth against all oppos ition as the fulfiller of the word and the doe r in truth. The word of the Christ, according to Paul, is identical with the Makhe ru, or word - made - truth by Horus the fulfiller. He likewise spe aks of “the word of the truth of the gos pels” (Col. I. 6). The pow er of his Christ is that of the risen Horus; it is the pow er of the resurrection to eternal life; and bot h are the same, because bot h represented one meaning, namely the soul of man that ros e again from death, and was persona lized in Horus or in Iusa. Although the second character of Horus is realized by Jesus in his baptism; in his becom ing the belove d and anoi nted son of God; in his cont ests with Satan as a spirit; in"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"provi ng himself to be the “heir of the temple”; in his breathing the Holy Spirit into the breathless, raising of the dead, and in various other ways, such fulfilment had to be repudi ated on account of the alleged Jude an history. Hence he prom ises that if he goe s away from the disciples he will send them the Comforter, the Paraclete, or advoc ate, “even the Spirit of Truth 804 which proceedeth from the father.” “A little while, and ye behol d me no more; and again a little while and ye shall see me.” This was the shor t time betw ixt the first and second com ing of the Lord, which was about three night s in the mysteries. “If I go not away the com forter will not com e unt o you. ” Whereas in the Egypt ian judgm ent scenes the com forter has com e already. Horus in his second character is th e paraclete or advoc ate with the father. One by one he introduc es the faithful to Osiris (in the vigne ttes to the Ritual), and is the intercessor and the mediator with the father on behalf of his children. In the papyr us of Ani, for example, Horus the inte rcessor or advoc ate introduc es Ani to his father, saying, “I have com e to thee, O Un - nefer, and I have brought unt o thee the Osiris - Ani. His heart is right ; it hath com e forth guiltless from the scales. It hath not sinne d against any god or godde ss. Taht h ath weighed it according to the decree pronounc ed unt o him by the com pany of the gods ; it is most right and true. Grant that he may appe ar in the presence of Osiris; and let him be like unt o the follow ers of Horus for ever and ever. The process of conve rt ing parts of the Osirian drama into Gospel narratives and of making the wisdom of the mystery - teachers por table for ordinary use, is obvi ous still in various of the parables of the doubl e - Horus. For instance, in his first estate child - Horus was the sow er o f the seed, and in his second character at the second com ing he is the reaper of the harvest. Thence com es the parable of the sow er. In the pictures to the Ritual Horus is the sow er who goe s forth to sow the seed in the field of his father. And when he sow s the wheat the enemy, that is Sut the pow er of darkne ss, com es by night and sow s the field with tares and thorns and thistles, it being his work to undo all the good that Horus doe s. This is represented in a parable by means of which “the kingdom of heave n is likened unt o a man that sow ed good seed in his field; but while men slept his enemy came and sow ed tares also among the wheat and went away.” The disciples ask for an expl anation and the answer is “he that sow eth the good seed is the son of man; and t he field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom ; and the tares are the sons of the evil one ; and the enemy that sow ed them is the devil; and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the ange ls” (Matt. XIII). Thus the matter of the drama was reproduc ed piecemeal in religious märchen and exot eric narratives. T HE M YSTERIES AND THE M IRACLES . The Mysteries were a dramatic mode of representing the gnos is or science of the Egypt ian mythol ogy and eschatology. They are the mysteries of Amenta. It was in these the dead were raised, the blind were made to see, the dum b to speak, the deaf to hear, the lame to walk, the manes to becom e bird - headed. Hence the scenes of their occurrence"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"were in spirit - world, where the manes m ade their transformation visibly, and the mortal put on immortality. The greater mysteries were founde d on the resurrection from the dead 805 with the Ka or the bird - headed Horus as the representative of a survival in spirit. As we have seen in the “Pist is Sophi a,” Jesus tells the disciples that “the mystery of the resurrection of the dead healeth from demoni ac possessions , from sufferings and all diseases. It also healeth the blind, the dum b, the maimed, the hal t”; and he prom ises that whos oever shall ac hieve the gnos is of this wisdom shall have the pow er of performing these mysteries of the resurrection which onl y becom e miracles when exot erically rende red in the canoni cal Gospels ( P. S., B. 2, 279 ). Amenta in the mythos was the secret earth of the noc tu rnal sun. In the eschatology it is the spirit - world in which the dead becom e onc e more the living, and attained their continui ty by being prove d and passed as true for all eternity. If they failed, it was here they died the second death, and never rose aga in. Amenta was the world of the blind, the deaf and dum b, the maimed, the halt, and impot ent becaus e it was the world of the dead. Thus the miracles of the canoni cal Gospels repeat the mysteries of the Ritual, and the scene of these was in the earth of th e manes, not in the earth of mortals. It was there the deliverer wrought his “miracles” in the eschatologi cal representation, whether as Horus, the son of Osiris, or as Iusa, the son of Atum - Ra. The Egypt ian religion had no need of miracles. It did not pos tulate the supe rnatural. The supe rhum an and ideally divine were a part of and not apart from nature. The nether - earth was the other half of this and the Gospel history has been based upon that other earth of the manes being mistaken for the earth of mortal s. In the Ritual, and in the gnos tic writings , we find the mystery, the events, the characters, the Christ, the Virgin - Mother, the miracles, replaced upon their ow n prope r foot ing and on the onl y ground of their existence which is eschatologi cal and was a means of working out the drama in Amenta by means of the mythol ogy that was previous ly extant. The so - called miracles of Jesus were not onl y impos sible on hum an grounds ; they are historically impos sible because they were pre - extant as mythical representati ons which were made on grounds that were entirely non - hum an in the drama of the mysteries that was as non - historical as the Christmas pantom ime. The miracles ascribed to Jesus on earth had been previous ly assigne d to Iusa the divine healer who was non - hist orical in the pre - Christian religion. Horus, whos e other name is Jesus, is the performer of “miracles” which are repeated in the Gospels, and which were first performed as mysteries in the divine nether - world. But if Horus or Iusa be made hum an on earth, a s a Jew in Jude a, we are sudde nly hemmed in by the miraculous , at the centre of a maze with not hing antecedent for a clue; no path that leads to the heart of the mystery, and no visible means of exit therefrom . With the introduc tion of the hum an persona ge on munda ne ground, the mythical inevitably becom es the miraculous ; you cannot have the history without it; thus the history was founde d on the miracles which are perversions of the mythol ogy that was prova bly pre - extant. Not onl y is it represented in the Gospels that Jesus raised the dead but that he also conf erred pow er on the disciples to do likewise. They are to preach and proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is at "},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"806 hand, to “heal the sick and raise the dead” (Matt. X. 5 - 8). So the follow ers, called the “Children of Horus,” had the pow er given them previous ly by their Lord to raise the dead. In the Pyramid texts of Teta (line 270) it is said, “Horus hath given his children pow er that they may raise thee up” ; that is, from the fune ral couc h. But this resurrection was in Amenta, the earth of eternity, not in the earth of time, and thos e who were raised up for the second life are the manes, not mortal beings in the hum an world. It was not pretende d that they were Egypt ians in the time of Teta, the first king of the sixth dyna sty. The Christians babbl e about the mysteries of revealed religion, which mysteries never were revealed except to thos e who had been dul y initiated. These were mysteries to the Christians simply because they had not been revealed to them. They are the mysteries of ancient know ledge reproduc ed as miracles of modern ignor ance. Such mysteries of the Christian faith, as the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the Virgin Birth, the Transfigur ation on the Mount , the Passion, Death, Burial, Resurr ection and Ascension, Transubs tantiation and Baptismal Regeneration, were all extant in the mysteries of Amenta with Horus or Iu - em - hetep as the central figure of the pre - Christian Jesus. This mode of making miracles from the mysteries can be traced in th e canoni cal Gospels. For instance, according to John, when Jesus reappe ars to the seven fishers on boa rd the boa t to cause the miraculous draught of fishes it is after his resurrection from the dead. Cons eque ntly, the transaction is in a region beyond the tom b, therefore in spirit - world, not in the life on earth. Whereas in Luke ’s version, his reappe arance was in the earth - life and is not a reappe arance after death. Yet the miraculous draught of fishes is the same in bot h books ; and either the transaction i s historical in Luke and has been relegated to the after - life in anot her world by John, or else the mythical version was first and has been conve rted into an historical event by Luke . But here, as in other cases, there is no corrobor ation of the history to be adduc ed, whereas the priority of John’ s version is attested by the Ritual where the fisher, the seven fishers, the fishing and the fish belong not to this earth but to that other world beyond the tom b and to the mysteries of Amenta. When Sebek in the Ritual (ch. 113) catches the fish in his marvellous net this is proclaimed by Ra to be “a mystery.” But when Simon Peter in the Gospel catches the great draught of fishes the mystery becom es a miracle. Mythol ogy know s not hing of miracle, nor the need of i t. Miracle has no place in the Egypt ian Ritual. But the Ritual show s us how the necessity for it arose as a modus ope randi when the gnos is had to be account ed for by ignor ance and the mythos was conve rted into hum an history. For example, the sun or the sun - god Atum is described in the Ritual as goi ng ove r the surface of the lake of Mati, in Abydos , the place of rebirth, or of sunr ise. That which is done mythically by the god is performed by the manes on the eschatologi cal plane, and as he is in the hum an li keness, it follow s that he must walk the water in the sun - god’ s track. He says, “the great God who is there is Ra himself. I walk on his road; I know the surface of the lake of Mati. The water of Mati is the road by which Atum - Ra 807 "},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"goe s to traverse the field of divine harvest” (Rit., 17). In the first pha se the sun (or solar god) traverses the celestial water at dawn. In the eschatologi cal cont inua tion the hum an soul in Amenta doe s the same because assimilated to the character of the god. It is but a mo de of representing phe nom ena in the two worlds of the doubl e earth, the imagery of uppe r earth being repeated in spirit - world. But if we subs titute a hum an being for the solar god or the manes in Amenta, and make him walk the water in our world on the surf ace of the sea or lake of Galilee, instead of the lake of Mati in Amenta, the water - walking can onl y be done by miracle. Such is the genesis of the Biblical miracles in bot h the Old Testament and the New. This we are now able to prove twice ove r by means o f the original matter and mode of the mythos in the Egypt ian eschatology that was hum anized or literalized in legends and at last converted into Christian history. You cannot rationa lize the Bible miracles by reduc ing them to what may be thought reasona bl e dimensions . As Matthew Arnol d said, “this is as if we were startled by the extravagance of suppos ing Cinde rella’s fairy godm other to have actually change d the pum pki n into a coach - and - six, but shoul d sugge st that she did really change it into a one - hor se - cab.” It is not a matter of degree or proportion, but of a radical difference in the funda mental nature of things . It is not the kind of transformation that was appl ied to the primary facts, nor is this transformation the result of imagination. It was not a result of the faculty of imagining that a man shoul d be suppos ed to walk the water and not sink. Such an imagining was cont rove rted by all the past of hum an expe rience. When the Egypt ians por trayed a hum an impos sibility – a miracle – they depicted a pair of feet walking on the water. This was a mode of supe rhuman force first made manifest by the elemental pow ers such as light and darkne ss, the wind, or the spirit of the storm. The water - walker was an old type which was igno rantly misappr opr iated. The gnos tic interpretation of the Kamite mysteries had no need of miracles, no reversal or violation of natural law. The process by which miracles, or total violations of natural law, arose, was through perversion of ancient know ledge by later ignor ance — not in the fa lse or exagge rated repor ts of eye - witnesses. Nor coul d anything be settled by a conf lict of opi nions in the dom ain of ideas. We must have som e foot hol d and ground of fact to go upon even to fight the battle. As it is in phys ical science, we have to ascerta in the know able. It avails not hing to take refuge in the unknow n or to enshroud our selves in mystery. The legends of mythol ogy were not ideal, nor based upon abstract ideas. They were not first evol ved from the inne r cons cious ness, but from facts in out war d nature that are for ever verifiable. The mysteries that “historic Christianity” took ove r without unde rstandi ng, and preserved as food for faith, or as probl ems for metaphys ical speculation, are fathom able and even simple when truly interpreted, but they have and can have no solution on the suppos ed historic ground. And with its bogus miracles surreptitious ly derived from the ancient mysteries by falsification of the myths, it has destroye d or tende d to destroy all standi ng - ground 808 of com mon sense in natural reality. With its “historical” virgin mother of a God who was her “historical” child, it has made a doubl e mockery of nature, human and divine. With its risen corpse for an anoi nted Christ the onl y Son of God, it has deified an image of death itse lf and made a mortuary of the hum an mind."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":" When it is conc lusively prove d that the Christian miracles are not hing more than a pagan mode of sym bol ical representation literalized, there is no longe r any que stion of cont ravening, or breaking, or even challen ging any well - know n laws of nature. The discussion as to the proba bility or pos sibility of miracle on the old grounds of belief and doubt is closed for ever. A glance at the Egypt ian pictures will show that the Horus or Christ is the young sun - god who walk s the waters in Amenta not on the uppe r earth, and that the evil spirits who enter the swine and are driven dow n into the lake are the soul s of thos e who were conde mned in the great judgm ent as typhoni an, the black pig being a type of Sut the evil being. A study of these miracles as they were originally rende red will lead to an unde rstandi ng of their true signi ficance, and here as everyw here else the truth of the matter onc e attained must ultimately put an end to the false belief: Falsehood hath nothing in the world to do, But lie to live and die to prove the true! With what facility the miracle coul d be manuf actured for the exot eric Gospels, canoni cal or apoc rypha l, may be seen from the legends in The Arabi c Gospel of the Infanc y (ch. 37) . In one charact er the yout hful sun - god, Horus or Jesus, was represented as a sort of divine dye r. He is called the great one who produc es colour s. In a passage of the Ritual (ch. 153) , as rende red by Birch, it is said that “the great one journeys to the produc tion of col our s.” These are the colours which are produc ed when the sun, or the child - Horus, or Jesus, rises from the lotus to dye the blue heaven with the hue s of dawn. This is show n by a reference in the same passage to the sycamore tree of dawn. Now , in one of the num erous folk - tales that were derived from the mythos , this is made a miracle of in a legend of the Infancy. It was as the child - Horus that the sun arose to create the colour s; and, as a child, it is said the Lord Jesus entered the shop of a dye r where la y many cloths which were waiting to be dye d each of a different colour . Taking them all up toge ther he threw the whol e lot into a vessel of Indian blue. The dye r cried out and said the boy had ruined them all. But Jesus said he woul d cause each one to com e forth of the colour that was desired, and he took them out of the vessel one by one , each one being dye d of the very colour that the dye r wanted. The story of child - Jesus in the Gospel of Thom as who, when five years old, took clay and formed the images o f twelve sparrow s, which turned the word into a deed when Jesus bade them fly, is a miracle manuf actured from a mystery of Amenta. When the manes were transformed from mum my to spirit they became bird - headed in the likeness of Horus whos e head was that of a sparrow - hawk. This in the folk - tale becom es a sparrow , and twelve sparrow s created by Jesus in the miracle are the representatives of the twelve great spirits of 809 Horus which have the head of the sparrow - hawk in the mystery of Amenta. When evil spi rits enter swine and are driven dow n the mount ainside to be drow ned in the lake of darkne ss the representation is mythical, not miraculous . The mount is root ed in Amenta. The scene is in the earth of eternity. The mount was called the mount of birth in hea ven.

The miracle begins when the avengi ng Har - Tema is made historical, the pig actual, and the transaction takes place on this our uppe r earth. We must go to the Egypt ian drawings in the drama of the mysteries for the verifiable fact; and onc e we are in presence o f the real truth we learn that the argument of Professor Huxl ey against the miracle is just as unpr ofitable as the Christian belief in the miracle. Here, as everyw here, the miracle results from a misinterpretation of the mythos out of which the gospels wer e ultimately evol ved, piecemeal, and put toge ther in a spur ious history, with a spur ious version of Horus the mortal, and a spur ious spectre of Horus in the spirit. In performing his miracles with a word, in being the word incarnated or made truth in pers on, in wielding a magical pow er ove r the elements, in casting out devils, in causing the spirits of evil to enter the swine, in healing the wom an with the issue of blood, in giving sight to the blind, in transforming and transfigur ing himself, in sudde nly conc ealing himself, in walking upon the sea, in his persona l conf lict and battles with Satan, in raising the dead to life out of the earth, in resuscitating himself on the third day; in all these and other things Jesus is accredited with doi ng exactly what was attribut ed to Horus in the Ritual and in the Egyp tian mysteries. But these miraculous things were never done by mortal or immortal on the surface of our earth. They are other - world occurrences in the true rende ring, and they can onl y be re - related to reality as a mythical mode of representing the scenes in the drama of Amenta. The supe rhum an attribut es are pos sessed, the transformation and transfigur ation effected, the waters walked, the evil spirits cast out to enter the typhon ian swine; sight is rest ored to the blind, the dum b are given a mout h, the dead are raised up out of the earth by Horus in this divine nether - world termed the earth of eternity and not on the earth of Seb in the world of time. The historical character of the four Gospel narrativ es must stand or fall by the historical facts of the miracles. From the birth derived from a virgin to the corporeal resurrection of the Christ, the sole standi ng - ground is upon miracle. No amount of Jesuitical dialectic or logi cal argum ent based upon fals e premises, can ever make right , as a trustworthy matter of faith, that which is verifiably wrong as matter - of - fact. Yet the faith was founde d on the uttermost falsification of natural fact as the ground of the history. On the one hand we find a belief tha t these miraculous transactions , these teachings of the Christ and the Christ himself were historical. On the other, we have the proof that they were unhi storical, a proof upon evidence that has 810 never been tampered with, and that is directly derived from witnesses that do not , cannot lie. The miracles of the virgin birth and phys ical resurrection of Jesus; the miracles of giving sight to the blind and of raising the dead, the descent into Hades, and the resurrection in three days or on the third day, are all Egypt ian, all in the Ritual. They were previous ly performed by the Christ who was not historical, the Christ of the Egypt o - gnos tics who is Horus or Jesus, identical with the Osirian Christ who was Horus the lord by name, and who, as the records sho w, was also extant as a divine type or spiritual impersona tion as Iusa or Iu - em - hetep many thous and years ago. A crucial example of the mode in which the gos pel history was manuf actured from the matter of the mythos and the eschatology is furnished by the miracle of miracles"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"of the loaves and fishes. In one account the multitude of men, wom en and children are fed on five loaves and two fishes, and the remains of the meal were sufficient to fill twelve baskets (Matt. XVI. 17 - 21) . In the other miracle, or se cond version of the same, the multitude are fed on seven loaves and a few small fishes, and there were seven baskets full of broke n pieces. But for the Ritual we might never have know n the correct num ber of loaves that did suffice to feed the vast multitud e. They are seven in one place and five in anot her, and bot h the seven and five are found in one and the same book. This difference, how ever, serves for Matthew to make out a second miracle (XV. 36). The speaker in the Ritual says, “There are seven loaves on earth with Seb; there are seven loaves with Osiris (in Amenta); there are seven loaves at Annu with Ra in heaven” (ch. 53) . “Henceforth let me live upon corn in your presence, ye gods , and let there com e one who bringe th to me that I may feed from thos e seven loaves which he hath brought for Horus” (Renouf , Rit., ch. 52). “It is the god of the sektet boa t and of the maatit boa t who hath brought them (the loaves) to me at Annu” (ch. 53) . These seven loaves cons titute the celestial diet on which the multit ude of soul s are fed in Annu , called “the place of multiplying bread.” But thos e who are fed upon the seven loaves in the celestial locality of Annu are not hum an beings on earth; they are manes in Amenta where Horus is the bread of life as giver of food t o the qui ckened spirits of the dead; and as the transaction occurred in the next life there was no need of a miracle in this life by asserting that about five thous and hungr y men, besides wom en and children, were fed upon five or seven loaves of bread and two fishes. The @synopt ics do not mention the incident, but according to John (VI. 9) who retains much more of the Egypt ian wisdom in his Gospel, there was a lad present in the scene who had with him “five barley loaves and two fishes.” “Jesus therefore t ook the loaves from him and distribut ed them to the peopl e.” We have identified the feeding of the multitude of manes on the seven loaves that were brought to Horus as distribut or of the bread of life, and the lad who brings the bread to Jesus in the Gospe l with the one who brings the seven loaves to Horus, or, it may be, the five loaves to Taht, in the Ritual, and who is described as “som eone ” who com es with the bread of Horus and Taht which is ritualistically represented by the seven loaves. A primitive c onc ept of the infinite had been expr essed in terms of 811 boundl ess food and drink. Provi dence was the provider; and the pow er that provi ded the fruits of the earth or water was Providence when bread was made the provi ding pow er or godhe ad itself was fig ured by the Egypt ians as an illimitable loaf, the food of spirits or celestial diet for the life to com e. The one great loaf was equi valent to the one supr eme sour ce of soul . Seven loaves were num erically equivalent to the seven soul s of Ra. The hum an soul was fed from the bread of life as typi cal of divine sour ce. With bread of that kind one loaf might have sufficed without the pretence of a miracle, as it was cut and com e again without diminut ion. It was the kind of bread which keeps on rising and expa ndi ng for ever as in the German tale of Jesus and the miserly woman with her dough . Annu is the place of bread in which the multitude s of manes are fed as men, wom en and children also, if the youngl ings of Shu are include d. It is called the place of multiply ing bread.

In the Gospel the multitude recline upon the grass. In the Ritual they rest upon the gras sy sward beneath the sycamore of Hathor (ch. 52, 4). But when the multitude s were fed in Annu they were the soul s of the departed, and the sym bolical seven loaves on which they fed was Ka - bread that was neither made nor eaten on earth, nor did it need a mi racle to make the good go far enough . Annu was a mythical locality which did not suppl y the condi tions for a miracle. A miracle had to be performed onl y when the eschatologi cal representation was shifted from the mount of Annu in Amenta to a moun tain in Ju dea. One hierogl yphi c sign of the mount hetep is a pile of food. The mount was the place of feasting for the follow ers of Horus, the beatified spirits of the departed. “Every feast on earth and on the mount ain” signi fies the feasts of the living and the de ad; the living upon earth, the dead or the departed on the moun tain. In the feasting on the mount “Jesus went up into the mount ain and sat there. And there came unt o him great multitude s, having with them the lame, blind, dum b, maimed, and many others, and they cast them dow n at his feet; and he healed them; insom uch that the multitude wonde red when they saw the dum b speaking, the maimed whol e, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel. And Jesus called his disciples and s aid, I have com passion on the multitude , because they cont inue with me three day s and have not hing to eat.” (Matt. XV. 29 - 32.) The miracles of healing, includi ng the casting out of evil spirits and the raising of the dead, as portrayed in the Ritual and co rrobor ated by the “Pistis Sophi a,” occurred in the resurrection on the mount ; and this show s that thos e who had been with Jesus having not hing to eat for three day s had been awaiting their 812 resurrection on the third day, and that they were the manes a nd not mortals. The onl y reason why the blind and deaf and dum b, the palsied and the lame, includi ng the dead, assembled in their multitude s upon the mount is because this was the mount of resurrection and regeneration, thence of healing, for the manes wh o had waited in Amenta for the com ing of the Lord. The resurrection of Osiris was solemnized at the great Haker festival. This is one of the ten mysteries described in the “Book of the Dead” (ch. 18) said to have been celebrated “before the great circle of gods in Abydos (the place of Osiris’s rebirth and resurrections ) on the night of “Haker” (or Ha - k - er - a) when the glorious one s are rightly judge d: when the evil dead are parted off, and joy goe th its round in Thinis” (ch. 18, Renouf ). The name for this fe stival is rende red “Com e thou hither or Com e thou to me” : as the call of Ra upon the mount addr essed to Osiris in the valley on the day of resurrection, when the soul of Horus the mortal was blende d with Horus the immortal in the mystery of Tattu (ch. 17). The Haker celebration include d bot h fasting and feasting. The word haker signi fies fasting, to be famished, as well as denot ing the festival of “Com e thou to me” or the rite of resurrection. Now , as the com parative"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"process show s an “historical” version of the Haker festival is given in the Gospels where we find an exot eric account of the fune ral fast and resurrection feast, in the miracles of healing performed upon the mount and feeding the famished multitude upon the seven loaves of bread. It shoul d be pr emised that the raising of Osiris, the god in matter was indi vidua l, but , at the same time, the resurrection of the dead in Osiris who were the “All Soul s” for the year or cycle was general. The supr eme miracle of “raising the dead” suffices of itself to s how that it belonge d to the mysteries of Amenta, as asserted in the “Pistis Sophi a,” where the dead were raised; evil spirits were cast out , the blind were made to see, the deaf to hear, the lame to walk, the bed - ridde n to get up and go, not by miracle but as a dramatic mode of illustrating the mysteries of the resurrection in the Peri em hru or com ing forth to day. It is not iceable that the miracles of healing on the mount described in Matthew (XV. 29 - 31) , are immediately follow ed by the miracle of multipl ying the loav es and fishes. There is no change of scene, the multitude upon the mount remain the same. “And Jesus called unt o Him His disciples, and said ‘I have com passion on the multitude , because they cont inue with Me now three day s and hav e not hing to eat; and I woul d not send them away fasting. ” Thus three days are allotted to the work of healing in the mount , dur ing which time the multitude were fasting in the com pany of Jesus and his disciples. In the Ritual these are not onl y the fasting, they are a lso deprived of breath. They are without a mout h. They are the blind, the dum b, the motionl ess, in shor t, they are the deceased awaiting in their coffins and their cells for him who is the resurrection and the life, as the divine healer and deliverer of th e manes from Amenta; he is the “divine one who dw elleth in heaven, and who sitteth on the eastern side of heaven” (Rit., ch. 25) that is on Mount Bakhu, the mount of the olive - tree, the onl y mount on which the dead were ever raised ( P. S., B. 2, 279) . This healing then was a mystery of the resurrection, the same in the canoni cal as 813 in the Egypt o - gnos tic Gospel; the same in bot h as in the Book of the Dead, or Ritual of the resurrection. Three days was the lengt h of time allow ed for the burial in Amenta . This woul d cons titute a three days’ fasting of the dead. We must discriminate. In the luna r reckoni ng the resurrection of Osiris in the moon was on the third day, which corresponde d to the actual appe arance of the light in nature. This death, described b y Plutarch, occurred on the seventeenth of the mont h. In the solar reckoni ng three whol e days and night s were allow ed for the bur ial of the sun or sun - god in the earth. Both are employe d in the Gospels but not scientifically. Neither coul d the com plex of s oli - luna r reckoni ng be expl icated on the singl e line of a persona l hum an history. Both solar and luna r reckoni ngs remain, but huge ly gaping apart with a gul f for ever fixed between the two. The Son of Man was to remain three night s as well as days in the “ heart of the earth.” That is in keeping with the solar reckoni ng, whereas the resurrection is on the third day, the same as that of Osiris in the moon. We repeat, there was a two - fold com put ation of time, luna r and solar, bot h of which are given in the gos pels, but without the gnos is that expl ained the astronom ical mythol ogy. Three days is the full period, and this is the lengt h of time ove r which the miracles of healing were extende d and dur ing which the multitude with Jesus had “not hing to eat,” because t hey were with him in the Valley of Amenta; the same that were healed by him on the Mount of Resurrection. It"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"was in the resurrection that the dead were raised to life and became spirits. These were the good spirits which were parted from the evil spirits t hat were then “cast out .” Sight was given to the blind, a mout h to the dum b, hearing was restored to the deaf. The lame were enabled to rise and walk. Then the three days’ fast was ende d by the feeding of the multitude on what the Ritual terms celestial di et, i.e., the “seven loaves” of heaven that were suppl ied as sustenance for the risen dead in Annu, the place of multiplying bread. In the Egypt ian mysteries, all who enter the nether world as manes to rise again as spirits are blind and deaf and dum b and maimed and impot ent becaus e they are the dead. Their condi tion is typi fied by that of mortal Horus who is por trayed as blind and maimed, deaf and dum b in An - arar - ef the abode of occultation, the hous e of obs curity, the “city of dreadful night ” where all th e denizens were deaf and dum b and maimed and blind awaiting the cure that onl y came with the divine healer who is Horus of the resurrection in the Ritual, or Khuns u, the caster out of demons , or Iu - em - hetep the healer, or Jesus in the Gospels, gnos tic or a gnos tic. Thus the restoring of sight to the blind man, or the two blind men, was one of the mysteries of Amenta that is reproduc ed amongs t the miracles in the canoni cal gos pels. The speaker in the Ritual often makes the merest allusion to som e act of the drama that was visibly performed and fully unf olded in the mysteries. For example, Horus the avenge r is described as blendi ng his being with that of the Sight less One, who had been Horus in the flesh (Rit., 17) . In a previous allusion (same chapter) the co ming of the soul of Ra to embrace and blend with the body - soul of Osiris, to give light and life to the Mum my - God is also described as the act of Horus - Tema who is blende d with the Sight less God. In either 814 representation there is a restoration of sig ht to the blind; and this when written out and narrated as “History” becom es the miracle of Jesus curing the man and giving sight to him who was blind; or to the two men as Osiris and the Osiris, N., or to any num ber of thos e who were sight less in the city of the blind. When Horus the deliverer descends into Amenta he is hailed as the prince in the city or the region of the blind. That is, of the dead who are sleeping in their prison cells, and who therefore are the prototypa l spirits in prison. He com es to shine into their sepul chres and to restore their sight to the blind. “Hail to Thee, Lord of Light , who art prince of the hous e which is encircled by darkne ss and obs curity,” in the city of the blind (Rit., ch. 21). This picture is repeated in the Gospel o f Matthew (IV. 16). “The peopl e which sat in darkne ss saw a great light : and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death, to them did the light spring up.” This, as written in the “Book of the Dead” was in Amenta. The typi cal blind man of Amenta, then, is Horus in the gloom of his sight less condi tion, as the human soul obs cured in matter or gropi ng in the darkne ss of the grave. This is Horus An - arar - ef in the city of the blind. And the Horus who com es to restore the lost sight , is he who had been d ivinized in the likeness of Ra, the hol y spirit. It is said of this dua l Horus in the Ritual (ch. 17) , “The pair of gods are Horus the recons tituter of his father and Horus the prince in the city of blindne ss.” The second Horus is the spirit perfected. He descends from heaven to the darkne ss of Amenta as The Light of the World. He is called the one whos e head is clothed with a white radiance. His presence shines into"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"the sepul chres and cells of the manes. He com es to the blind in the city of the blind, the place in which blind Horus was enve lope d in obs curity. He show s as a great light in the darkne ss of the land of the dead, and is described as restoring sight to thos e who are blind, that is to the manes who have not yet attained the beatific or spiritual v ision. This is represented as giving sight to the blind. Amenta was look ed upon as the earth of the blind. The manes were there as blind folk awaiting sight . The hum an Horus Har - Khent - An - arar - ef in Sekhe m was the prince of the blind, being chief amongs t th e manes who were sight less or without the means of seeing in the dark. For this reason the mole or shrewmous e was his zoot ype . The typi cal blind man in Amenta is the blind Horus who was deprived of sight by Sut, the Pow er of Darkne ss. But every manes that entered Amenta was also blind in the darkne ss of death. Thus there are two blind men, or one as the God and one as the manes; one in the soli - luna r mythos , and one in the eschatology; Horus in his darkne ss of night or the eclipse; the mortal in the dark of death. Miracle for mystery, this may expl ain the two different versions of healing the blind in the Gospels. Three of the evange lists know of a singl e blind man onl y, who was cured by Jesus, where Matthew repor ts the healing of two blind men in which he o bvi ous ly gives two separate versions of one and the same miracle. In the Ritual, then, we can identify the one blind man with Horus in the dark, or without sight (Rit., ch. 18, as Har - Khent - an - maati); the two blind men with Horus and the manes (otherwise 815 with Osiris and the Osiris); and the multitude s of blind peopl e above ground with the manes or the dead in Amenta. There is no need of limiting the miracle of curing the blind to one or two men. Horus the light of the world in the earth of Amenta com e s to cure the blind in general who are dw elling in the darkne ss of the city of the blind, in which the devil (Sut) was dom inant previous to the second adve nt of Horus. The dead in Osiris were as blind mum mies awaiting the spiritual light which gave the bea tific vision; and Horus com es to uns eal the eyes of the manes waking in their coffins. The poor blind Horus was given eyes at the time when he became the anoi nted son, and the child of twelve years made his transformation into the adul t of thirty years wi th the head and sight of the hawk, or the beatific vision of Horus in the spirit. He was anoi nted with oil at the lustration in Abydos , the place of re - birth. Hence one mode of making the anoi nted or the Christ whom Horus became in this transformation was by anoi nting with saliva. The lustration of children by spittle was an old Papal rite, and in the Gospel the spittle used to ope n the eyes of the blind is equi valent to anoi nting the sight less Horus in Sekhe m. In acting the mystery of Amenta the “Eye of Ho rus,” the anoi nted son, the light of the world, was brought to blind Horus lying in his darkne ss. This mystery is reproduc ed as miracle in the healing of the blind man. “When I am in the world,” says Jesus, “I am the Light of the World.” This is equi valent to bringi ng the eye of Horus to the benight ed manes in Amenta. “When he had spoke n, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anoi nted his eyes with the clay.” And in this uns ight ly way the man is said to have attained his sight in thus bec om ing the anoi nted. Such is the pue rility of the miracle - monge rs who misrepresent the mystery - teachers in the Gospels. To reach the “recove ry of sight to the blind” was to teach a doc trine of the resurrection and the ope ning of the eyes in death, such as w as set forth dramatically in the"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"mysteries of the Ritual (chs. 20 - 30) . It was the same also in giving a mout h to the dum b; in making the dead to rise and the lame to walk; likewise in casting out evil spirits, and the pow ers of darkne ss, the associates of Sut, the Sami or the Sebau, which originated in phys ical phe nom ena, and were afterwards mis - rendered as obs essing spirits that were primarily human. When the divine healer and caster - out of demons , Khuns u - Horus, went to Bakht en to exor cise an evil spirit f rom the pos sessed Princess, the god was carried there in effigy, as the “driver away of evil spirits that take pos session” of the hum an body, not as a divinized medicine - man por trayed in hum an form. The effigy is an image of the wonde rful healer who origin ated as a pow er of renewal in external nature, and not as a mortal on this earth. The caster - out of demons is also por trayed as Khuns u offering up the abom inable pig in the luna r disk as a sacrifice to the Lord of Light (Planisphe re of Dende rah), the pig b eing a zoot ype of Sut the evil one . Thus we reach a root - origin in the war of light and darkne ss, or Horus and Sut, that is waged for ever in the Moon. The black boa r, Sut, makes his attack upon the eye, which is healed by Horus or Khuns u, Taht or Ra. The pow er of light was then the healer of the wound in nature that was wrough t by the representative of darkne ss as the pig, the Apap - dragon, or the adve rsary Sut. Hence the eye of Horus in 816 the moon is a sym bol of healing, and of safety or salvation; an amulet, therefore, or fetish, good against the pow ers of darkne ss. There was no miracle in the natural phe nom ena. There was no miracle invol ved or taught in the original mode of representation. But when a “hum an mortal” with the name of Jesus is put in pla ce of Horus, Taht or Khuns u, he becom es the suppos ed to be, but for ever impos sible, miracle - monge r; Jesus, the Jewish Saviour , who is described as com ing into a world of blind peopl e; som e of whom are blind figuratively, others actually. The Scribes and P harisees are denounc ed as blind, “blind gui des,” “fools and blind, ” “blind leaders of the blind.” Jesus restores the sight of thos e who are phys ically blind, “to many blind he gave sight .” That is in fitting the canoni cal Jesus to the rôle of Horus. A form of blind Horus described by Isaiah leaves no room for doubt that the Hebrew Messiah was the Egypt ian Horus. This is he who is blind; “my servant, who is blind as he that is made perfect, and blind as the Lord’s servant” (chs. XLII, XLIII). This servant of the Lord is the suffering Horus who was por trayed as the servant of Osiris the Lord, blind, dumb, and therefore deaf, but as being perfected in serving the Lord, who “conf irmed the word of His servant.” Being perfected marks the change from the servant, a s Horus who was bor n blind in matter to Horus in spirit, the restorer of sight to the blind, that is, to the dead. Also the word of the servant was conf irmed by the com ing of Horus as the word - made - truth in Har - Ma - Kheru. But it was in the earth of Amenta t hat Horus came to restore the sight to the blind, and in the canoni cal Gospels Jude a, full of blind folk being cured by miracle, is just Amenta wrong - side uppe rmost, with the drama of the doubl e - earth in a state of tops y - turvydom through the conve rsion of the ancient mysteries into Gospel - miracles. In arrangi ng for the resurrection of the dead, as performed in the mysteries of Osiris, the fune ral bed, called the Khenkha t, is prepared as the couc h of the mum my. It is said to the deceased, “I have fastened t hy bone s together for thee. I have given thy flesh"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"to thee.” This is in arrangi ng the deceased upon the fune ral couc h, for his rising from , or as, the dead (ch. 170) . “Hail N,” it is said to the deceased upon the fune ral couc h, “Arise on thy bed and com e f orth” (Rit., chs. 169 - 170) . Here is an instructive instance of the way in which the mysteries of the Ritual have been conve rted into the miracles of the Gospels. There are two chapters conc erning the funeral bed. The first is “on making the Khenkha t to sta nd up” ; the other is on “arrangi ng the Khenkha t.” We repeat, the Khenkha t is the fune ral bed on which the dead were laid out in Amenta, waiting for the com ing of Horus, lord of the resurrection, to wake the sleepers who are in their coffins or lying breath less on their couc hes in the likeness of inert Osiris. It is the couc h of the dead that is set up on end like the mum my - case with the body inside which is thus erected on its feet as a mode of rende ring the mystery of the resurrection or re - erection of the deceased (Rit., ch. 169) . This becom es a miracle in the Gospel, when the dead are raised, and thos e who were paralytic take up their bed and walk. In the next chapter (170) on the arrange ment of the fune ral bed it is said to the risen one , “Thou settest f orth on thy 817 way. Horus caus eth thee to stand up at the risings .” Then the deceased, as the risen mum my, is seen to be walking off. That is in the resurrection. Here, as elsewhere, the mystery of Amenta becom es a miracle when represented on this earth . That change woul d of itself account for a huge falsification, to say not hing of the intent and tende ncy of the writers, which follow and ove rshadow the truth of the ancient wisdom all through as darkly as the night the day; for if ancient Egypt was the l ight of the world, Christian theology has assuredly been its impenetrable shadow . As already show n, a reduc ed form of the mysteries that were acted in the Osirian drama may here and there be recogni zed in the form of parables and por table sayings . Take th e mystery of Tattu in the 17t h chapter of the Ritual, by means of which the Sayings of the Lord, quot ed from “the Gospel of the Egypt ians” by the two Clements, can be expl icated. The Lord himself being asked by someone when his kingdom woul d com e, replied: “When two shall be one . When that which is without is as that which is within, and the male with the female (shall be) neither male nor female” (Clem., Rom .). When Salom e asked, when thos e things about which she que stione d shoul d be made know n, the Lord s aid: “When you tread unde r foot the cove ring of shame, and when out of two is made one , and the male with the female is neither male nor female” (Clem. Alex., Strom ata ). This is that blendi ng of the two soul s or two sexes in one which was figur ed and effec ted in the mystery of Tattu. This blendi ng of two halves in one whol e, which is a likeness of neither, but a new image of bot h, is exemplified thrice ove r in the Ritual, when a soul was established that shoul d live for ever. Ra is blende d with Osiris; Shu with Tefnut ; child - Horus with Horus the adul t. Ra represents the divine soul , and Osiris the body - soul in matter. Shu represents the male, and Tefnut the female nature. Child - Horus is the mortal and Horus in spirit the immortal. Thus the divine soul was bl ende d with the soul of matter; female with male, and mortal with immortal in the mystery of Tattu. The mystery was of cour se performed, and in the present instance, the drama cons ists of three acts with six different characters which are Ra and Osiris, Shu and Tefnut , Horus the sight less, with Horus the bringe r of the beatific vision. In the saying quo ted from “the Gospel according to the Egypt ians” the mystery has been reduc ed to the male and female"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"becom ing neither male nor female in the mystical marriage , the other factors being om itted. This show s the process by which the mysteries of the Ritual were reduc ed and made por table in the miracles, the parables and sayings , or Logoi , whether as separate sayings or as miscellaneous collections . A distant echo o f the doc trine is to be heard in the Gospel according to Matthew (XXII. 30) : “For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as ange ls in heaven.” So remote is this from the mystical marriage in Tattu that the mystery in Amen ta is limited to sexua l conj unc tion. Now we learn from the Ritual that one mode of making the change from matter to spirit and of being uni fied in the type beyond sex was by discarding the garb of the female in the preparation of the manes for the fune ral bed at the time of the second birth (Rit., ch. 170) . The garment is again referred to in “the 818 fragm ents of a lost Gospel” when the speaker says “he himself will give you you r garment.” “His disciples say unt o him, when wilt thou be manifest to us, an d when shall we see thee? He saith, when ye shall be strippe d and not be ashamed” (Grenfell and Hunt , New Say ings of Jesus, p. 40) , which is the same thing as being freed from the garb of shame upon the fune ral bed. This is no mystical reference to Genesis III. 7, but to the mystery of Amenta and a ceremony that was performed in the nether - world, of which it is said, “Thou puttest on the pur e gar ment and thou divestest thyself of thy apr on when thou stretchest thyself on the fune ral bed” (Rit., ch. 172 ). “T hou receivest a banda ge of the finest linen,” in place of the old garb of shame, or the apron which was now a sym bol of the flesh. Lastly, amongs t the mysteries of Amenta which were conve rted into Gospel miracles one of the most arresting is that of the Wi dow and her only son whom Jesus raised up from the fune ral bier at Nain (Luke VII. 14) , because Isis is the widow by name in the Ritual who was represented by the discons olate swallow as the widow who has lost her mate, and Horus was her onl y son. The conn ection of the child with the widow in Egypt is already seen in the Gospel of Thom as or Tum , which goe s far tow ards identifying the child - Jesus with the child of Isis. Moreove r, the mystery show s us how the mother as Isis became a widow . When Osiris had bee n put to death, the birth of the child - Horus follow ed the decease of his father, and his mother was cons eque ntly the widow who had an onl y son in Horus, the onl y child of his mother. In the mystery of Tattu, child - Horus was raised up from the dead when Hor us in the spirit came to the fune ral couc h and the immortal was blende d with the mortal in the mystery of the resurrection. This is repeated in the Gospel as one of the most telling of the mysteries that were Christianized in the miracles. J ESUS IN THE M OUNT . Ascendi ng the mount ain of Amenta is a figur e of the resurrection from the dead. When Jesus Aber - Amentho rises after death it is to take his seat upon the mount ain with the twelve preservers of the light . The group of twelve follow ers was the latest to gather form upon the mount . This was preceded by the seven, the four , and the two. The Ritual of the Resurrection ope ns with the com ing forth to day of Horus or the Osiris, who"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"ascends the mount of glory, or Mount Bakhu, the mount of the green olive - tr ee, which afterwards was represented in Jude a by the local Mount of Olives. In the older manus cripts of the Ritual this ascent is called “the com ing forth to the divine pow ers attached to Osiris,” which are the four with Horus in the mount , or on the Papyr us - colum n, the four that were his brethren first, and who are afterwards por trayed as his children. But in bot h the Ritual and Pistis Sophi a the mount , the scenes upon the mount , the twelve with Jesus or the four with Horus on the mount , are all in spirit - world. As we have seen, Pistis Sophi a ope ns with the resurrection of the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus. The life of suffering represented on the earth was ove r, and the victor rose trium pha nt after death, to be inve sted with the glory of the Father on the mount . 8 19 This is the Peri - em - hru or com ing forth to day with which the Egypt ian Ritual of the resurrection begins. Jesus com es forth from Amenta as the teacher of the greater mysteries to the twelve disciples who are gathered toge ther on the Mount Olivet, which is the mount ain of Amenta in the Kamite eschatology. Thus the mount , the scene upon the mount , the teaching and the twelve are all pos t - resurrectional , and therefore the transactions are not upon our earth. There was a doubl e resurrection in the Osirian my steries, just as there is a first and second death. The earliest is a resurrection of the soul that passes from the body on earth and emerges as the Sahu in Amenta. This is Amsu - Horus, who is still a mum my, but who has risen to his feet with one arm loos en ed from the banda ges of bur ial. It has the look of a corpor eal resurrection, for the body is semi - corpor eal. But Horus has not yet attained the garment of his glory. The typi cal mount ain likewise had a twofold characters in the mythology and the eschatolo gy. As solar, it was the mount of sunr ise or of the great green olive - tree of the Egypt ian dawn. As eschatologi cal, it was the moun tain of Amenta, up which the manes climbed — the mount of glory and the glorified. It was the mount on which the hum an Horus wa s transfigur ed and regenerated to becom e pur e spirit in the likeness of the Father. Hence it is the mount of transfiguration, of regeneration, of healing, and also the means of ascent into the land of spirits (Rit., ch. 17). The second resurrection is fro m Amenta. When Horus has transformed and made his change into the likeness of his Father and becom e pur e spirit he ascends from the mount and rises into Heaven from Bakhu, the mount of the olive - tree, or the Mount of Olives in the later rende ring. This was the meeting - place of Horus and his heavenly Father Ra when they conve rsed toge ther in the mount . It is that Mount of Olives on which Horus, the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus, met the twelve disciples after his resurrection from Amenta, which meeting - place is repea ted when the Gospel - Jesus makes the appoi ntment for the Eleven to meet him in the mountain after he has risen from the dead (Matthew XXVIII. 16) . The Kamite founde rs of the astronom ical mythol ogy had placed the equi noxe s high up on the horizon, or the sum m it of the mount , and where one writer speaks of the equi noc tial station as being on the mount anot her might assign it to the “level place” or plain, when neither of them pos sessed the prope r clue. In this way one discrepancy may be expl ained conc erning the delivery of the sermon on the mount . According to Matthew, Jesus delivered it upon the mount . According to Luke , he came dow n from the mount and “stood on a level place” (ch. VI. 17) . Both places meet in one , but onl y on the mount ain of the equi nox , the E gypt ian mount ain of Amenta. According to"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Matthew, the sermon was delivered to the four brethren in the mount . This follow s the Ritual. According to Luke , the sermon was delivered to the twelve on the mount by Jesus standi ng on the level place. No rationa l expl anation has ever been sugge sted why the divine healer on earth shoul d have com pelled the sick and ailing, the obs essed, the halt and maimed, the deaf and dum b and blind who 820 besought him for a cure, to climb a lofty mount ain with the crippl es on crutches in order that they might com e into his presence and be healed. When Jesus was follow ed by the clamorous multitude he went up into the mount ain and sat there. “And there came unt o him great multitude s, having with them the lame, blind, dum b, maimed , and many others, and they cast them dow n at his feet, and he healed them.” The answer is that the mount was mythical, not geographi cal; the divine healer was no hum an thaum aturgist; the multitude s were manes, not munda ne mortals. The onl y mount ain menti one d by name in the Gospels as the scene of the miraculous occurrences is Mount Olivet. There was such a mount ain to the east of Jerusalem, but beyond that was the mythical Moun t of Olives, which was localized in many places unde r various names as the typi cal mount of the astronom ical mythos . At first the mount was a figur e of the earth that rose up in the waters of the Nun, or space. Then it was a type equi valent to the horizon. To be upon the horizon in the mythos is to be upon the mount – the mount of the doubl e equi nox – the four qua rters or the twelve divisions of the ecliptic. It is show n in the Pistis Sophi a that the twelve disciples, teachers, or suppor ters who sat with Jesus on the Mount of Olives had originated as the twelve æons or rulers in the zodi a c. As such they were the teachers of time and the preservers of the treasures of light . Their stations were in an aërial region. This is otherwise called the sphe re or circle of the zodi ac, in which the twelve seats or throne s were finally established, wit h the central throne of the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus tow ering ove r all. In the early Christian iconogr aphy the cross of Christ is erected on a mount . This is show n to be the mount of the four qua rters, or the equi nox, by means of the four rivers flow ing from the sum mit. The Christ stands on the top along with the cross. Som etimes the ram or lamb is por trayed on the mount of the four qua rters in place of the Christ; and Horus was likewise the lamb as well as the calf upon the mount . The Christ is also accom pani ed by seven lambs=seven rams, suppos ed by Didron to represent the twelve apos tles! (Didron, Fig. 86) . But the ram (Mithraic lamb) is the Egypt ian ideograph for the ba - spirit, and seven rams or lambs that accom pany the Christ are equa l to the seven spirits which served Horus in the octona ry of the mount . The ram also appe ars with seven eyes and seven hor ns, which identify it with the seven rams as seven spirits, or the seven soul s of Ra. This show s an earlier stratum of the astronom ical mythos in survival. I t is the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus, who was Horus, with the seven great spirits that were earlier than the twelve upon the mount . When Jesus has transformed, or spiritualized in his baptism, he is “led up of the spirit to be tempted of the devil” (Matt. IV. 1). He is then a spirit on the mount that is exceeding high, like the mount ain of Amenta, which is said to reach the sky. To meet upon the mount ain after death coul d onl y be as spirits meet in spirit - world"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"upon the mount of re - uni on in the mysteries of Amenta . Thus it is obvi ous that the meeting - poi nt of Sut and Horus, or of Satan and the Christ, was no earthly hill; and that the teacher and the teaching on the mount ain are the same in the canoni cal Gospels as in Pistis Sophi a and the Ritual, that is, they are in spirit - world, and therefore the total 821 transactions on the typi cal mount ain are pos t - resurrectiona l and not hum anly historical. According to John, the earliest discour se of Jesus is not the sermon on the moun t as given by Matthew. In place of thi s, John presents the discour se upon regeneration which is the same subj ect as that of the sermon on the mount in the Divine Pymande r. Jesus says to Nicode mus, “Verily, verily, I say unt o thee, Except a man be bor n anew (or from above ) he cannot see the kin gdom of God. ” Nicode mus saith unt o him, “How can a man be bor n when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s wom b and be bor n?” Jesus answered, “Verily, verily, I say unt o thee, Except a man be born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter i nto the kingdo m of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh: and that which is bor n of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unt o thee, ye must be bor n from above . The wind blow eth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voi ce thereof, but know e st not whence it com eth, and whither it goe th: So is everyone that is bor n of the spirit.” Nicode mus answered and said unt o him, “How can these things be?” Jesus answered and said unt o him, “Art thou a teacher in Israel and unde rstande st not these things ? Verily, verily, I say unt o thee, We speak that we do know , and bear witness of that we have seen: and ye receive not our witness. If I told you earthly things and ye believe them not , how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things ? And no man hath asce nde d into heaven but he that descende d out of heaven, the Son of Man, which is in heaven” (John III. 1 - 14) . This is a sermon on regeneration. The sermon of Hermes is in the mount of regeneration. The subj ect is the same in bot h. Previous to this discour se Hermes had told Tat that “no man can be saved before regeneration.” At a previous ascent into the mount Hermes had prom ised Tat that if he woul d estrange himself from the world and prepare his mind for this mystery to be unf olded, he woul d then impart it t o him. “Now ,” says Tat, “fulfil my defects and instruct me of regeneration either by word of mout h, or secretly; for I know not , O Trismegistus, of what subs tance or what wom b, or what seed a man is thus bor n.” That is, how he is to be reborn in the proces s of regeneration? Hermes replies, “O son, this wisdom is to be unde rstood in silence, and the seed is the true good .” “Who sow eth it, O father? for I am utterly igno rant and doubt ful.” “The will of God, O son. ” Now , this is called “the secret sermon in th e moun t,” on the subj ect of “regeneration and the profession of silence.” The subj ect is the same, the characters of teacher and doubt ful inqu irer are identical, and the phys ical misinterpretation regarding the mode of rebirth is one and the same in both i nterviews. Hermes describes a form of the Son of Man who is in heaven, otherwise the heavenly man, when he says, “I see in myself an unf eigne d sight or spectacle made by the mercy of God: and I am gone out of myself into an immortal body, and am not now wh at I was before, but am begot ten in mind.” He also says of the phys ical and spiritual, “He that looke th onl y upon that which is carried upw ard as fire, that which is carried dow nw ard as earth, that which is moist as water, and that which blow eth or is subj ect to blast as air;"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"how can he sensibly unde rstand that which is neither hard nor moist, nor tangi ble, nor perspicuous , seeing it is onl y understood in pow er and 822 ope ration: but I beseech and pray to the mind, which alone can unde rstand the generatio n that is in God.” But Hermes, who wrote the Ritual in hierogl yphi cs as the scribe of the Egypt ian gods , did not derive his matter from the Gospels collected by Eusebius and his co - cons pirators in Rom e ( Divine Pymande r, B. 7). After the prophe cy of the im mediate com ing of the Son, who is suppos ed to be speaking of himself, we have the real meaning of the manifestation identified in the very next verse, which cont ains a representation of the entrance of Osiris and his transfigur ation as Horus in the moun t o n the sixth day of the new moon. We are told that “after six days” – it woul d have been more correct if “on the sixth day”; the discrepancy, how ever, is but slight – “Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John his brother, and bringe th them up into a high mount ain apart. And he was transfigur ed before them. And his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light . And behol d there appe ared unt o them Moses and Elijah talking with him. And Peter answered and said unt o Jesus, Lord, it is g ood for us to be here: if thou wilt, I will make here three boot hs, one for thee, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. While he was yet speaking, behol d, a bright cloud ove rshadow ed them: and behol d a voi ce out of the cloud, saying, This is my belove d Son, i n whom I am well pleased: hear ye him” (Matt. XVII. 1 - 5). Then Jesus retires into his secrecy, saying, “Tell the vision to no man, unt il the Son of Man has risen from the dead.” This identifies the mount of resurrection, which is one with the mount of rege neration, the sermon on which is obvi ous ly pos t - resurrectiona l. There is a scene of Transfigur ation on the Mount in the mysteries of Amenta. “Ra maketh his appe arance at the mount of glory with the cycle of gods about him.” The Osiris deceased acqui reth mi ght with Ra, and is made to pos sess pow er with the gods — and when men or the manes see him they fall upon their faces. He is seen in the nether - world “as the image of Ra.” So in the Gospel, the face of Jesus “did shine as the sun. ” The disciples likewise fe ll upon their faces, and “were sore afraid.” Not onl y is Jesus seen in the likeness of Ra, the father in heaven; the voi ce from the father proclaims that this is the belove d son. In com ing dow n from the moun t the witnesses are com mande d to “tell the vision to no man,” and of the scene in the mysteries, it is said by the speaker in the Ritual, “the Osiris N hath not told what he hath seen; he hath not repeated what he hath heard in the hous e of the god who hideth his face” (ch. 133 ). The poi nt here is the id entity of the mythical mount , whether astronom ical or as the seat of the teacher; and the twelve; or as the mount of the mysteries; the mount of resurrection, of regeneration and of transfigur ation. It is the same mount when thos e multitude s that meet upon the sum mit are described as the blind, the halt, and maimed. The mount on which the dead were raised to life, the blind were made to see, the dum b to speak, the impot ent to becom e virile, like the risen ithypha llic Horus; the moun t upon which the famished multitude s were fed from the illimitable loaf, or loaves, was the mount of resurrection that rose up from the nether earth for the departed to ascend as spirits. Hence it is the mount on which the miracles in the Gospels are alleged to have been "},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"823 per formed. The mount of glory in the Ritual becomes the mount of the glorified in the Gospels. This, according to the gnos is, was the mount that has been localized in Jude a, to which the peopl e were bidde n to flee for refuge when the end of all things shoul d com e; not a geogr aphi cal moun t, but the mount of the manes in Amenta; the moun t of the resurrection, which onl y spirits coul d ascend; the mount from which the swine obs essed by devils were driven dow n into the lake when the evil Apap and his hos t of fiends is hur led back at dawn from the horizon to be drow ned in the bot tom less pit of Putrata (Rit., ch. 39) . Horus in the solar mythos is the prototype of Jesus on the mount . He is described as the sove reign lord upon the moun t=hor izon (ch. 40) . Elsewhere he s ays, “I com e before you and make my appe arance on the seat of Ra, and I sit upon my seat which is on the mount ” (or on the hor izon) (Rit., ch. 79) . Horus has alight ed on the moun t or is lifted on his monol ith, when he says, “I make my appe arance as that go d in the form of a man that liveth like a god , and I stand out before you in the form of that god who is raised high upon his pedestal (of the mount , or the papyr us - colum n) to whom the gods com e with acclamation. ” He maketh his appe arance on the mount of g lory or upon his pedestal with the cycle of gods about him (ch. 133 ). The papyr us being a figur e of the earth, Horus, on his papyrus - colum n or lotus - plant, is Horus in the mount . Also the four brethren, Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef, and Kabhs enuf , who stand upon the papyrus (or colum n), are the gods of the four qua rters with Horus in the mount . Now , when the four brothers, Simon and Andrew with James and John, are called upon to leave their nets and follow Jesus, they became straight way the four with Jesus in the mount . For, according to Matthew, the disciples were onl y four in num ber when the sermon was delivered in the mount (Matt. IV. 5). Again, the typi cal group of four in the mount are represented by Jesus, James, Peter and John at the time of the transfigur at ion (Matt. XVII. 1). Mount Bakhu having been named in Egypt ian from the olive - tree of dawn as a celestial sum mit was localized in Olivet, the mount ain eastward. This, as solar, was the one sole mount of the mythos ; and in the Gospels, although the moun t is mentione d several times, and appa rently in different localities, there is but one name given to it, that of Mount Olivet=Bakhu the solar mount , the one typi cal mount , the Egypt ian mount , equi valent to the hor izon, as the sum mit of the earth and figur e of the ascent into heaven. The canoni cal Jesus is also show n to be a form of the son of Ra, the father in heaven, in his retiring from the world at eventide and passing the night alone on the mount . It may be worth not ing that there was a temple of the solar Horus, as ancient as the time of Sebek, upon the eastward side of Moun t Bakhu. As it is said in the Ritual (ch. 108) , “Sebek the Lord of Bakhu is at the East of the hill, and his temple is upon it.” And Sebek was very pos sibly the most ancient form of Hor us the young solar god. Horus wars against the serpent of darkne ss on behalf of his father in the mount by night , and is the teacher in the temple of heaven by day. Jesus obvi ous ly makes use of bot h the mount and the temple, for he went up into 824 "},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"the m ount ain when “he ope ned his mout h and taught” the multitude s (Matt. V. 2). The devil took him up into an exceeding high mount ain when he was in the spirit. He was transfigur ed on a “high mount ain apart” (Matt. XVII. 1, 2). He sat upon the Mount of Olives w hen expoundi ng the cons um mation of the cycle and the gos pel of the kingdom to the disciples privately (Matt. XXIV. 3). Many details are of cour se om itted from the “history” and there is no gui dance in the Gospels to the secret meaning of the mysteries. For that we must “search the Scriptures” which are genui ne and self - expl anatory as Egypt ian; the scriptures of Maati and Taht - Aan. Of Jesus and his doi ngs in the mount by night we are told that he went into the mount ain to pray; and he cont inue d all night in prayer to God (Luke VI. 12). “And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chos e from them twelve” (VI. 13) . It is said in the Ritual that “Horus is uni ted at suns et with his Father Ra who goe th round all night in the mount . The sun - god has to figh t the adve rsary Sut for his passage through the mount by night . Horus is said to com e at evening and “seize upon the tunne ls of Ra” for making his passage through the mount . These are elsewhere called the tunne ls of Sut; a synonym for darkne ss. The sun - god entered the mount ain each night for rebirth every morning. Horus came forth from the Mount of Olives. He is por trayed in the Ritual walking ove r the waters. He ascends the Mount Bakhu to enter the solar bark. It is said that his “sister godde sses stand in Bakhu” ; they receive him there as the two mothers, they lift him up into his boa t (Hym n to Harmachis). There is a curious conj unc tion of the Temple and the Mount in Luke ’s description of Jesus as the teacher. Like so many other fragm ents it stands by itse lf in the Gospel. “Every day he was teaching in the Temple; and every night he went out and lodge d in the mount that is called of Olives. And all the peopl e came early in the morning to him, in the Temple, to hear him” (ch. XXI. 37, 38). This passage ident ifies the mount as being named from the olive - tree, on which the temple of Sebek - Horus stood, and therefore with Mount Bakhu. On com ing forth from the mount of Amenta Horus entered the bark that was row ed or tow ed round by the twelve who were called the tw elve kings in the solar mythos , and afterwards twelve teachers or apos tles who were servants to Iu the son of Atum , the Egypt ian Jesus in the eschatology. It is Horus in the mount ain with his father who says, “I am the Lord on high. I make my nest on the conf ines of heaven,” that is, aloft on the mount . “Invi sible is my nest.” “From thence I descend to the earth of Seb” his foster - father, “and put a stop to evil.” “I see my father, the lord of the gloaming, and I breathe” (ch. 85, Renouf ). Horus in the mou nt is designa ted “lord of the Staircase” or steps at the top of which his father sat enthrone d. In this dua l character the peripatetic Jesus is made to journey, betwixt plain and mount ain, tow n and count ry, in a vain ende avour to make the track of Horus be com e historical. Horus enters the mount ain by night and com es forth by day as the “lord of daylight ” divinized. On com ing forth he says, “I have ascertained what there is in Sekhe m,” the shrine in the mount , where dead Osiris lay. “I have touc hed 825 wit h my two hands the heart of Osiris, and that which I went to ascertain I have com e to tell. . . . Here am I, and I com e that I may ove rthrow mine adve rsaries on the earth (even) though my dead body be buried” as the Osiris (ch. 86, Renouf ). In entering the mount ain at suns et he has seen the great mystery of Osiris, his death, his transformation, and his"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"resurrection, and he com es forth as a spirit divinized to make the expe rience know n as a teacher of the mysteries to thos e that became his follow ers, his ch ildren who were adopt ed by him as the four brethren two by two, then the seven, and finally the twelve who row the solar bark or reap the harvest of eternal plenty in the Aarru paradise of the Amenta. A specially impor tant feature in the “history” is this retirement of Jesus into a mount ain at suns et to com mune with his Father. Jesus “when even was com e went up into the mount ain apart to pray, and was there alone” (Matt. XIV. 23). “He went out into the mount ain to pray; and he cont inue d all night in prayer to God” (Luke VI. 12) . It is not iceable that he goe s into the mount ain, and in the mythos the sun at evening entered the mount which is a figure of the earth. The type was cont inue d in the eschatology. God the Father as Osiris had his dw elling - place and s hrine in the mount of earth and it was there that Horus interviewed the father. The speaker in the “Book of the Dead” says, in the character of Horus the son, “I seek my father at suns et, com pressing my mout h.” This latter phr ase is Renouf ’s rende ring of t he words “hapet ru,” the sense of which is determined by the ideogr aph of closing or enclosing. Therefore the meaning is “I close my mout h” as the synonym for silence in the moun t. He seeks his father in the character of Horus with the silent mout h. “I see k my father at suns et in silence, and I feed on life,” is the com plete declaration made in this line. Horus feeds on life in silence when alone with the father in the mount of earth where soul s were fed on sustenance divine. This is the meat referred to by Jesus when he said, “I have meat to eat that ye know not of,” “My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accom plish his work.” Horus says, “I live in Tattu, and I repeat daily my life after death, like the sun. ” For he is Horus risen in Amenta , where he is the instructor of the manes in the mysteries, otherwise he preaches to the “spirits in prison. ” In bui lding the hous e of heaven, which was annua lly repeated in the mysteries, the four fold founda tion, the four suppor ts or cornerstone s, were l aid in the moun t. These four suppor ts were persona lized in the four children of Horus, Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef, and Kabhs enuf , who had already been four of his brothers in the earlier mythos when they were the four sustainers of the heaven at the four corner s of the mount , and also as the four who stand upon the flow er of the papyr us - plant. Now we have to bear in mind that the rock is identical with the mount , and that the hous e or temple of Horus bui lt upo n the mount was founde d on the rock. In establishing his father’s kingdom of the beatified, Horus bui lt upon the typi cal rock. In the Gospel Simon is told by Jesus that he will bui ld his chur ch upon this rock, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. The gates of Hades or Amenta ope ned in the roc k of the Tser Hill to let the dead com e forth in the glorified train of Horus the conque ror 826 whos e temple, from the time of Sebek, had been built upon the rock with the four brethren as the pillar of suppor t, which were finally extende d to the twelve in keeping with the com plete num ber of zodi acal signs . Peter, in the Gospels, has been assigne d the place and pos ition of the rock or mount (or Tat of stability) because in the Greek the word petra signi fies the rock. But the rock was the same as the mount ; the mount was one and the same all through; and it was the site of the bui lding, whether this is called the"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Chur ch of Rom e, the temple of Sebek, or the hous e of Tum , that was bui lt by his son Jesus for the divine abode , at the level of the equi nox. Horu s in the character of Har - Makhu was the sun - god of the doubl e horizon, who passed from west to east and uni ted the two in one . These two horizons of the doubl e earth have been a sour ce of endl ess perplexity to the stude nts of the history. The two hor izons reappe ar in the Gospels as thos e of the two oppos ite count ries, Jude a and Galilee. Both have been used inde pende ntly; the result is that one writer localizes the works of Jesus in the one region, whilst anot her places the scenes in the count ry oppos ite, as if they did not know which leg to stand on, or on which hor izon to take their stand. Horus of the doubl e hor izon is reproduc ed in Jesus, who itinerated in two lands or two parts of the one land which takes the place of the Egypt ian doubl e earth. Horus pas ses from one hor izon to the other by making his passage through the mount . He makes the passage in the stellar Atit, or Maatet - boa t, which he enters with the seven glorious one s at suns et. Horus in the moun t is one with Horus in the boa t, and thus as teach er of the four, or the seven, or the twelve, he is the teacher in the boa t. It is said that “he sat dow n and taught the multitude s out of the boa t” (Luke V. 3, 4). Horus, with the seven on boa rd the boa t, who were por trayed in heaven as the Sahus in Orion, is usually depicted standi ng. The nearest likeness to the passage through the mount ain in the Maatet - boa t by night occurs when Jesus “withdr ew again into the mount ain himself alone ,” whereas the disciples go by water. “When evening came, his disciples wen t dow n into the sea; and they entered into the boa t and were goi ng ove r the sea unt o Capernaum . And it was now dark.” The scribe hardly dared to send them throug h the mount ain by the boa t of the mysteries, therefore Jesus com es to them by walking on the wa ter, “and straight way the boa t was at the land whither they were goi ng” (John VI. 15 - 21) , that is, by magic or by miracle. At the sum mit of the mount the glorified deceased who came up from Amenta were now given a seat upon the bark of Ra. In one of his m any characters Horus is the divine teacher called “the teller,” on boa rd the boa t. He says, “I am the teller in the divine ship. I am the unresting navigator in the bark of Ra” (Rit., ch. 109) . As the teacher in the boa t he also says, “I utter the words of Ra (his father) in heaven to the men of the present generation (or to the living on earth), and I repeat his words to thos e who are deprived of breath (or to the manes in Amenta)” (Rit., ch. 38). This, then, is Horus as the teacher in the solar boa t, who utters the words or sayings of his father Ra, by day and night , to the living on earth and the manes in Amenta. These are spoke n of as thos e who are in their 827 shrines, but who are also said to accom pany Horus as his gui des. Horus further says, “I have made my way and gone round the celestial ocean on the path of the bark of Ra, and standi ng on the deck (bekasu) of the bark.” It is in this pos ition on the boa t that he utters the words of Ra – the word of God – to bot h the living and the dead. He says, “I co me forth from the cabin of the Sektit bark, and I raise myself up from the eastern hill. I stoop upon the eastern hill. I stoop upon the Maatet (or Atet) bark that I may com e and raise to me thos e who are in their circles, and who bow dow n before me” (Reno uf, ch. 77) . The boa t or bark of the sun has been made historical in the Gospels. In the time of the celestial Heptanom is there were seven on boa rd the bark with Horus. And seven is the num ber on"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"boa rd the ship with Jesus after his resurrection. In the hea ven of ten nom es there were ten on boa rd the solar bark with Horus, and there are ten on boa rd the boa t with Jesus (not twelve) in a very early picture given by Bosio. In this scene, Jesus with the ten in the boa t is the child of twelve years, not the man of thirty years. Ten in the solar boa t preceded the twelve in the heaven of ten divisions , which were earlier than the seventy - two. (Lundy , Monum ental Christiani ty, fig. 56.) Horus in the boa t is anot her of the mythical characters assigne d to Jesus by the “sacred historian.” Jesus likewise plays the part of Horus in the boa t as the teller of parables. “There were gathered unt o him great multitude s so that he entered into a boa t and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach. And he spake to them many th ings in parables” (Matt. XIII. 2, 3). Four of the parables are then told to the peopl e by Jesus, the teller in the boa t, which is a co - type with the sayer or logos in person. We find that the Teacher, now becom e historic, also addr esses two classes or kind s of peopl e when he utters the words of his father from the boa t. One audience cons ists of the twelve disciples to whom he is suppos ed to com muni cate a know ledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. These correspond to the glorious one s who are enshr ined, and who accom pany Horus as his gui des. The others are called the multitude . To these it is not given to know the mysteries because “seeing they see not , and hearing they hear not , neither do they unde rstand” (Matt. XIII). If the thing were historic, the suppos ed great democratic Teacher woul d be excludi ng the “swinish multitude” from all know ledge of the kingd om of heaven. They were not to be enlight ened because they were too densely, darkly ignor ant. They are to be put off with parables, according to Luke (VIII. 10) , “that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not und erstand” these heavenly stories which had for them no earthly meaning. Thus , in this process of transmogr ifying the Kamite mythos into Christian history, the com mon peopl e, th e ignor ant multitude , are assigne d the status of the Pait, the breathless, non - intelligent, uni llum inated dead who were slum bering darkly in the coffins of Amenta, and these are inevitably mixed up, in the teaching of Jesus, with the deaf and blind who do not hear and cannot see, and may not perceive, as mortals on this earth. Moreove r the bark in which the sun - god made his celestial voya ge was doubl e unde r two different names. “I am the great one among 828 the gods ,” says the speaker in the Ritual (ch. 136 B ), “com ing in the two bar ks of the lord of Sau.” In the morning it was the Sektit boa t, in the evening the Maatet bark. “Let the soul of the deceased com e forth with thee (the god ) into heaven; let him jour ney in the Maatet boa t till he reach the heave n of the setting stars” (Rit., ch. 15) . Two boa ts are also mentione d by Luke where Matthew onl y speaks of one — “while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of God, Jesus saw two boat s standi ng by them.” He asks that one of these may put out from the land in order that he may addr ess the multitude from the shor e. And he sat dow n and taught the multitude s out of the boa t (Luke V. 4). Again, we meet with Jesus on boa rd the Maatet bark at evening. In the Gospel according to Matthew there is a scene i n which Jesus is asleep on boa rd the boa t. At suns et, “when even was com e,” he entered into a boa t and his disciples follow ed him. And behol d, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insom uch that the boa t was cove red with the waves, but"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"he was asleep.” Th en “he arose and rebuke d the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm” (Matt. VIII. 24) . The scene may be paralleled with that on boa rd the bark of Ra at evening in the western moun tain, and it is said of him, “Now at the close of day he turneth dow n his eyes to Ra: for there com eth a standi ng still in the bark, and a deep slum ber within the ship.” Here the solar god as Ra, or Horus, when sinki ng to rest in the boa t, is described as being asleep on boa rd when the evil one makes his attack. There is a c ont est. “Then Sut is made to flee with a chain of steel upon him, and he is forced to vom it all that he hath swallow ed. Then Sut is put into his prison” (Rit., ch. 108) . The western mount ain ove rlooks the lake of Putrata. “I know the place,” says the speak er, “where Ra navigated against adve rse winds ” (ch. 107) . The lake that is crossed by night amidst the terrors of the tempest is a replica of the dreadful lake of darkne ss which the follow ers of Horus have to cross in Amenta. It is mentione d in the pyr amid texts (Pepi I, 332, and Merira, 635 ) as a lake that is traversed by the glorified persona ge. In the chapter by which “one dieth not a second time” (Rit., ch. 44, Renouf ) it is spoke n of as the lake or chasm of Putrata, where the “dead fall into darkness,” if not suppor ted by the eye of Horus, their moon by night . Elsewhere it is described as the voi d of Apap ove r which the bark of heaven sails; the voi d in which the Herrut - reptile lurks to prey on thos e who fall dow n headlong in the dark (ch. 99) . In this place the deceased pleads that he may be brought into the bark “as a distressed mariner,” for safety. After crossing the lake of darkne ss, the solar god is thus addr essed — “O thou who art devoi d of moisture in com ing forth from the stream, and who restest u pon the deck of thy bark, let me join thy boa tmen.” “O Ra, since thou passest through thos e who are perishing headlong, do thou keep me standi ng on my feet.” That is, in crossing the water — but not walking on it. Som e of the matter may have sunk dow n a litt le too deep to dredge for, but as Herod the mons ter is the Herrut - reptile, the dragon - Apap, in an anthropom orphi c gui se, we may com plete the parallel by poi nting out that the murder of John by Herod 829 immediately precedes the crossing of the stormy - lak e=the lake of darkne ss called the voi d of Apap in Amenta. John is slain, but Jesus escapes to cross ove r and to save thos e who were sinki ng in the waters and who are described in the Ritual as “falling dow n headlong, ” and findi ng not hing to lay hol d on by which they can be saved from the bot tom less abys s, unt il Horus com es to the rescue of the “distressed mariners” in the “divine form which revealeth the solar orb,” and with the eye that was an emblem of the moon; the sun by day and moon by night being call ed the two eyes of Horus. In the original mythos the boa t is the solar bark; in the eschatologi cal pha se it is the boa t of soul s. It is steered by Horus, who is called the oar that gui des. It is row ed by his follow ers, who may be the “four paddl es,” or th e seven great spirits, or the twelve mariners; and it is the ark of salvation for soul s when Horus the Saviour is at the look - out . This ark or bark has served for a mode l in the New Testament as the boa t of soul s distressed that is nearly swamped, and onl y saved from sinki ng by the God who is on boa rd. On entering the bark the speaker pleads: “O Great One in thy bark, let me be lifted up into thy bark” (ch. 102) . The data for com parison with the story in the Gospel are — the divine bark, which is solar in the mythos , and the boat of salvation, or of safety, in the eschatology. In crossing the terrible lake from which the Apap mons ter emerges, and the"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"storms and tempests rise to ove rwhelm the bark, the god rises unw etted from the water to rest upon the deck of the bark and insure the safety of thos e on boa rd. This is identical with Jesus, who com es on boa rd by walking upon the water, whilst the indi vidua l speaker that makes the appe al for safety in the place of perishing headlong is equi valent to Peter, who call s for help when sinki ng in the lake, saying, “Lord save me,” and is “lifted into the bark” (Matt. XIV. 22 - 33), like the rescued manes in the Ritual. Jesus on boa rd the boa t with his disciples in the storm sustains the character of Horus in the boa t, who is the oar, paddl e, or rudde r of Ra, and who exclaims, “I am the khe ru (paddl e or rudde r) of Ra who brings the boat to land” (Rit., ch. 63). In this passage Horus is the oar or rudde r to the boa t of the sun, with the ancient one s on boa rd, in the mythos , and to the boa t of salvation for soul s in the eschatology. It is he who brings the boa t to the shor e. The germ of the Gospel story conc erning Peter sinking in the waters may be detected in this same chapter. The speaker is a “wretched one ” in the water who w as to be saved by him who is an oar or a boa t to the shipw recked (cf. ch. 125 , 38). In the Ritual it is hot water that the sinki ng manes has got into, the imagery being solar, and he speaks of being helpless as a dead person. But Horus, the oar of the boa t , the rudde r of Ra, is obvi ous ly his saviour , like Jesus with Peter in the Gospel. A shipw recked spirit is the inspiring thought , and Horus was the rescuer as the pilot, or figuratively the paddl e to the boa t by which the sinki ng soul was saved from drowni ng in the ove rwhelming waters. The Lord appe ars on the water in the morning watch, the “fourth watch of the night ,” that is, the prw... or dawning (cf. Mark XIII. 35) , at which time the Sun - God begins his march or his “walking, ” as it is termed, upon the wa ters of the Nun. It is said to the God who walks 830 this water at sunr ise, “Thou art the onl y one since thy com ing forth upon the Nun.” And here we may discove r the prototype of the Gospel version. The deceased addr esses Ra at his com ing forth to walk t he water and pleads, like Peter, that he may do so likewise. “Grant,” he says, “that I too may be able to walk (the water) as thou walkest (on the Nun) without making any halt.” The sun was seen to rise on the blue above , which was imaged as the water of h eaven. His follow er prays that he also may walk the water and make the passage successfully and without sinki ng, like the solar God. In anot her chapter the deceased exclaims, “I fail, I sink into the abys s of the flow ing that issues from Osiris,” that is, the water of which Osiris is the sour ce; and in these we find the parallel and prototype s of Jesus walking on the water and Peter sinki ng into its engul fing depths. Horus com mands in the boa t. Ra anni hilates his enemies from the boa t. It is in the boa t of the Sun that Ra put s a limit to the pow er of his enemies when they pur sue him to the water’s edge ; that is, to the horizon of day. So Jesus takes refuge in the boa t and finds protection when he perceives that he is about to be taken by force; he likewise walks upon the water to the boa t. Death by drow ning in the lake was the mode of execution appoi nted for the evil Apap and his hos t of darkne ss who attacked the solar bark by night. The fiends of Sut are also include d in this sentence of death by drow ning i n the emerald lake of heaven, or of dawn. Now the fiends of the evil Sut were represented as swine. And immediately after the great tempest in the sea which Jesus stills, the devils are made to enter the swine, and, like the emissaries of Apap and of Sut w ho “causes storms and"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"tempests,” they are driven dow n the mount ain - side to suffer death by drow ning in the lake. It was on the mount that Jesus met with the man obs essed with a legion of devils who “entreated him that he woul d not com mand them to depart in to the abys s.” “Now there was a herd of swine feeding on the mount ain,” “and the devils came out from the man and entered into the swine,” and the herd rushed dow n the “steep into the lake and were choke d” (Luke VIII. 33). It was by Sut, in the shape of a great black boa r, that Horus was gor ed in the eye. It was also the Pig of Sut that devou red the arm of Osiris in the bur ial - place. And when the evil spirits are cast out , as represented in the judgm ent - scenes, they enter the swine of Typhon and are driven dow n the side of the mount to be subm erged in the Lake of Putrata or the fathom less abys s of out er darkne ss. S UT AND H ORUS AS H ISTORIC C HARACTERS IN THE C ANONICAL G OSPELS . The Gospel story of the devil taking Jesus, or the Christ, up into an exceeding high mount ain from which all the kingdom s of the world and the glory of them coul d be seen, and of the cont ention on the sum mit, is originally a legend of the astronom ical mythos which, in com mon with so many others, has been conve rted into “history.” As l egend it can be expl ained by means of the Egypt ian wisdom . 831 As “history” it is, of course, miraculous , if not hing else. Satan and Jesus are the representatives of Sut and Horus, the cont endi ng twins of darkne ss and light , of drought and fertility, who strove for supr emacy in the various phe nom ena of external nature, and in several celestial localities belongi ng to the mythology. In the Ritual (ch. 110) the struggl e is described as taking place upon the mount, that is, “the mount ain in the midst of the earth,” or the mount ain of Amenta, which “reaches up to the sky, ” and which in the solar mythos stood at the poi nt of equi nox where the conf lict was cont inue d and the twins were reconc iled year after year. The equi nox was figur ed at the sum mit of the mount on the ecliptic, and the scene of strife was finally conf igur ated as a fixture in the cons tellation of the Gemini, the sign of the twin - brothers who for ever fought and wrestled “up and dow n the garden,” first one , then the other being uppe rmost dur ing th e two halves of the year, or of night and day. The mount ain of the equi nox “in the midst of the earth” joined the por tion of Sut to the por tion of Horus at this the poi nt midw ay betwixt the sout h and north. It was on the mount ain of the equi nox and onl y th ere the twins were reconc iled for the time being by the star - god Shu (Rit., ch. 110 ) or by the earth - god Seb (text from Memphi s). Sut the Satanic is described as seizing the good Horus in the desert of Amenta and carrying him to the top of the moun t here c alled Mount Hetep, the place of peace, where the two contendi ng pow ers are reconc iled by Shu, according to the treaty made by Seb. Thus , episode after episode , the Gospel history can and will be traced to the original doc um ents as matter of the Egypt ian my steries and astronom ical mythol ogy. The battles of Sut and Horus are represented in bot h the apoc rypha l and canoni cal Gospels. In the Gospels of the Infancy there are two boys — the bad boy and the good"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"boy. In this form the two born antagoni sts cont inue th eir altercation with a root - relations hip to the Osirian mythos . Sut is the representative of evil, of darkne ss, drought , sterility, negation, and non - existence. It is his devilry to undo the good work that Horus doe s, like Satan sow ing tares amongs t the wh eat. It was Sut who paralyzed the left arm of Osiris and held it bound in Sekhe m (Rit., ch. 1). It is the expr ess delight of the bad boy , the child of Satan, to destroy the works of Jesus, the child of light . There is one particularly enlight ening illustra tion of the mythos reproduc ed as Märchen. The pow er of resurrection was imaged by the lifting of the arm from the mum my - banda ges; Horus in Sekhe m is the lifter of the arm. Whilst the arm is fettered in death, Sut is triumpha nt ove r Horus in the dark. When Horus frees his arm, he raises the hand that was motionl ess (Rit., ch. 5). He strikes dow n Sut, or stabs him to the heart. The pow er of darkne ss, one form of which was Sut, is designa ted the “eater of the arm” (ch. 11). This act of the Osirian drama is ren dered in the apoc rypha l Gospels by the bad boy persistently aiming at injuring the good boy’ s arm or shoul der. In the Gospel of pseudo - Matthew (29) the bad boy, who is called a son of Satan and the worker of iniqui ty, runs at Jesus and thrusts himself bodi ly against his shoul der with the intention of breaking or paralyzing him. In the Gospel of Thom as the boy ran and thrust against the shoul der of Jesus 832 (ch. 4). Again, the bad boy threw a stone and hit him on the shoul der (Gospel of Thomas, B. 2, ch. 4). Several times when this occurs the bad boy is smitten dead by Jesus, just as Sut is pierced to the heart by Horus. Other evidence might be cited from these Gospels to show that the bad boy who tries to destroy the arm of Jesus is one with Sut who rende rs the arm of Horus (or Osiris) pow erless in Amenta. This being established, we are enabled to identify Juda s the betrayer of Jesus, his brother, with Sut the enemy of Horus. According to “the Arabic Gospel of the Infancy,” “In the same place” (with Lady M ary and her child Jesus), “there dw elt anot her wom an whos e son was vexed by Satan. He, Judas by nam e, whenever Satan obs essed him, bit all who appr oached him. He sought to bite the Lord Jesus, but he coul d not , yet he struck the right side of Jesus.” “Now this boy who struck Jesus and from whom Satan went out in the form of a dog , was Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him to the Jews” (ch. 35). We now have the original matter with which to compare the remains, and the com parative process will prove that these “ apoc rypha ” are not perversions of the canoni cal Gospels, but that they preserve traditions derived from the Kamite mythology and eschatology. This can be determined onc e for all by the cont ests of Horus with Sut, and by his warfare with the Apap - serpent or dragon, which are assigne d to the child - Jesus, as they were previous ly ascribed to the child - Horus. There are two type s of evil, or, according to mode rn terminol ogy , the devil, in the Kamite mysteries. One is zoom orphic, as the Apap - reptile, the other an thropom orphi c, as Sut, the persona l adve rsary of Osiris. Apap is the Evil One in the mythol ogy; Sut is Satan the adve rsary in the eschatology. In the 108t h chapter of the Ritual there is a curious fusion of Apap with Sut, the anthropom orphi c type of Satan. The serpent of darkne ss, the old enemy of Osiris - Ra, is portrayed in the vigne tte as Apap, and spoke n of in the text as Sut. After the battle “Sut is made to flee with a chain of steel upon him, and he is forced to disgor ge all that he hath swallow ed. The n Sut is made fast in his prison. ” At the same"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"time the serpent is described as “the bright one who com eth on his belly, his hind parts, and on the joints of his back.” To him it is said, “Thou art pierced with hooks , as it was decreed against thee of old” (ch. 108) . The battle here, betwixt Ra and Apap, or Sut, is finished on the horizon, that is, on the mount , from which the devil is hur led dow n defeated into the abys s. In the canoni cal Gospels, Jesus and Satan occupy the place of the two oppone nts Horus and the Apap, or Horus and Sut. The Herrut - reptile has been paralleled with the mons ter Herod; Satan is now to be com pared with Sut. Sat=Satan in Egypt ian is a name of the Evil One (Budge , Vocabulary, p. 268 ). In Africa the primal curse was drought . Droug ht was a form of evil straight from nature. This was figur ed as the fiery dragon , “hellish Apap,” that was drow ned by Horus in the inunda tion when he came as saviour to the land of Egypt in his little ark of the papyr us plant. Sut warred with Horus in the wilderness as representative of drought , when the “father of the inunda tion was athirst” (Rit., ch. 97), a cry of Horus that was echoe d on the Cross (John. XIX. 28) . Drought , 833 as we have said, was the earliest devil. In the Osirian cult the whol e of n ature was expr essed in a twofold totality according to the doctrine of Maati. Night and day, body and soul , water and drought , life and death, health and disease, were mode s of the dua lity manifested in phe nom ena. Sut and Horus were the representatives of this alternation and oppos ition personi fied as a pair of twins, now called the children of Osiris. Osiris Un - nefer is the Good Being, but as with nature he include s bot h the good and the evil in the totality. In the mythos , how ever, Horus represents the go od and Sut the bad. Sut is said to undo the good that Horus doe s. Hence he is the adversary or Satan when personi fied. As Prince of Darkne ss he put s out the eye of Horus, or the light by night. He sow s the tares amidst the grain. He is the “eater of the ar m.” He dries up the water of life with the desert - drought . He lets loos e the locusts, the scorpions and other plague s. He represents negation and non - being in oppos ition to being, and to the Good Being who is divinized in Osiris and manifested by Horus. Th e trium ph of Horus ove r Sut is freque ntly referred to in the Ritual. In one of his battles Horus destroye d the virile member of Sut, and his associates were ove rthrow n and pierced by Horus so long as blood woul d flow . In his resurrection Horus com es to put an end to the oppo sition of Sut, and to the troubl es he had raised against Osiris his father (Rit., 137 B ). He says: I am the belove d son. I am com e to see my father Osiris, and to pierce the heart of Sut (Rit., ch. 9). He is armed with hor ns against Sut ( ch. 78, 42) . Horus, “who giveth light by means of his ow n body, ” is the God who is against Sut when Taht is between them as adjudi cator in their disput e (Rit., ch. 83, 4). In the discour se of Horus to his father he says to Osiris, “I have brought thee the associates of Sut in chains.” In the Gospels of the Infancy, which cont ain som e remains of the more ancient legenda ry lore, the grappl e of child - Horus with the deadly Apap - reptile is freque ntly por trayed, as in the Arabic Gospel of the Infancy, when the b oy has been bitten by the serpent, and the Lord Jesus says to his playm ates, “Boys , let us go and kill the serpent.” He prove s his pow er ove r the reptile by making it suck the venom from the wound . Then the Lord Jesus curses the serpent, “whereupon the rep tile was instantly rent asunde r” (ch. 42) . But the war of Horus with the Apap - dragon , or serpent of evil, is not fought out"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"directly by Jesus in the canoni cal Gospels. Sut as the pow er of darkne ss and as the oppone nt in the moral domain had taken the place of the old first adve rsary of man in the phe nom ena of external nature. Jesus prom ises to give his follow ers pow er ove r the serpent and the scorpion, but there is no persona l conf lict with the pre - anthropom orphi c Satan recogni zed in the four Gospels. Sut, as Satan in a human form, was a som ewhat less unhi storic - looki ng type of the devil than the Apap - reptile. Satan, how ever, retains his old primitive form of the dragon in “the Arabic Gospel of the Infancy.” In this it is related that a damsel was afflicted by Satan, the cursed one, in the form of a huge dragon, which from time to time appe ared to her and prepared to swallow her up. He also sucked out all her blood, so that she remained like a corpse. She is cured by a strip of the clothing that had been worn by the child, Lord Jesus (ch. 33) . 834 This is a form of the wom an with an issue of blood . Her persecutor is the dragon of darkne ss who is the eternal devour er of the light in the Egyp tian mythol ogy , and of conde mned soul s in the eschatology. In the gno stic version it is Sophi a who suffers from the issue of blood and who is restrained and suppo rted by Horus when her life is flow ing away into immensity. The wom an suffering from the swallow ing dragon of darkne ss was the mother of the child of light in the moon. Expressed in hum an terms, Horus the bul l, or fecunda tor of the mother, stoppe d her female flow and filled her with the glory of the light , and thus he ove rthrew the mons ter that assailed her in the dark, which was figur ed as the wide - mout hed crocodi l e or devou ring dragon (Rit., ch. 80, 10) . Horus put s a bounda ry round about Sophi a. The child - Jesus cures the damsel with a strip of his raiment; and in the Gospel according to Matthew the wom an who is flow ing away like Sophi a with her issue of blood is he aled by touc hing the bor der of the garment worn by Jesus (Matt. IX. 20, 21). Here the dragon is om itted. The suffering luna r lady has been hum anized, toge ther with the Divine Healer; the cure is wrought ; the mode rn miracle remains in place of the mystery a ccording to the ancient wisdom . The conf lict between Sut and Horus (or Osiris), who are represented by Satan and Jesus in the Gospels, com mences immediately after the baptism in the river Jordan. One form of baptism in the solar mythos was derived from th e setting of the sun - god in the waters of the west, the waters in which Un - nefer washes when he has his disput e with Sut — either in the character of Horus or Osiris. Asar in his baptism is said to plunge into the waters with “Isis and Nepht hys looki ng on. ” Apua t (Anup) is present appa rently conduc ting the subm ersion of the god (Inscrip. Of Shabaka from Memphi s, line 42) . In his baptism the god Un - nefer was prepared for his struggl e with Sut, the pow er of drought in the desert of Anrutef. So, in the Gospels, Jesus is prepared by John in his baptism for the conf lict with Satan in the wilderness, on the pinna cle, and upon the exceeding high mount ain. It was onl y after he had entered spirit - life that Horus coul d grappl e with Sut, or Jesus with Satan, in the deser t, on the pinna cle of the temple, or on the sum mit of the mount ; cons eque ntly the earth - life had ende d when the cont est betwixt Satan and Jesus first began, in the pha se of eschatology. The wilderness of Satan in the Gospel represents the desert of Sut in Amenta. When Satan seized on Jesus and bor e him bodi ly up into the mount ain Jesus had just risen from his baptism and was led up “of the"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Spirit.” Otherwise he had made his transformation from the state of manes to the status of a spirit. This was in the ph ase of eschatology and the transaction is in spirit - world. When Jesus was “led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil” he is said to have “fasted forty days and forty night s,” and, afterwards, to “have hunge red,” whatsoever that m ay mean. This cont ention in the wilderness was one of the great battles of Sut and Horus, or, in the other version of the mythos , of Sut and Osiris. As Egypt ian, the wilderness is the desert of Anrutef, a desolate, stony place where not hing grew. It was he re that Horus was made blind by Sut, and was a sufferer from hunge r and thirst in this region of stony sterility, and root less, waterless sand. Horus in 835 Amenta had to make way through the barren desert, in the dom ain of Sut, as sow er of the seed from which the bread of life was made, much of which must have fallen on stony ground in the region of Anrutef. Forty days was the lengt h of time in Egyp t that was reckone d for the grain in the earth before it sprout ed visibly from the ground. It was a time of scarcity and fasting in Egypt , which gave a very natural signi ficance to the season of Lent, with its mourning for the dead Osiris, and its rejoicing ove r the child of prom ise, the germinating green shoot springi ng from the earth. This is represented in t he Gospel as a fast of forty days and forty night s, dur ing which Jesus wrestled with the devil and was hungr y. The struggl e then of Jesus with the devil in the wilderness is a repetition of the conf lict between Horus and Sut in the desert of Amenta; on the mount and on the pinna cle of the ben - ben or temple in Annu. During the forty days that Osiris was typi cally bur ied in the nether - earth as seed, from which the bread of heaven was made, the struggl e was cont inue d by Sut and Horus in the mount ain. This is r epeated in the Gospels as the cont est of Christ and Satan for the mastery in the mount . The conf lict is between the pow ers of light and darkne ss, of fertility and sterility, betwixt Osiris (or Horus) the giver of bread, and Sut, whos e sym bol of the desert was a stone . The fasting of Jesus in the desert represents the absence of food that is caused by Sut in the wilderness dur ing forty days of bur ial for the corn, and Satan asking Jesus to turn the stone s into bread is playing with the sign of Sut. Satan’s j ape about conve rting stone s into loaves of bread is likewise reminiscent of the mythos . The stone was an especial sym bol of the adve rsary Sut. Also the place of the temple in Annu, and the pinna cle, or Ha - ben - ben, was the place of the stone s by name. Moreo ver, Annu was the place of bread, or the loaves. As it is said, “there are seven loaves in Annu with Ra,” the Father in heaven (Rit., ch. 53 B ). As represented in the Ritual, Sut and Horus are more upon a foot ing of equa lity, whether in the wilderness or o n the sum mit of the mount of glory. Their trium ph is alternate, though that of Sut is much the more limited. As the pow er of drought and darkne ss he is master in the desert, and chief of the pow ers called the “ tesheru deities,” or gods of the desert. The s peaker in chapter 96 exclaims, “I have com e to propi tiate Sut and to make offerings to the God Akar and to the deities of the desert,” where Sut attained supr emacy ove r Horus for a time. The desert was the natural dom ain of Sut the adve rsary of Horus. Henc e Horus at his second com ing exclaims, “I am Horus, the Lord of Kamit and the heir of Tesherit” (Rit., ch. 138, lines 3 and 4), which he has also seized. Kamit is Egypt as a mythical locality: the dark and moist, fat and fertile land. Tesherit, the red lan d, is the desert. So that in taking pos session of the “two worlds,” or the doubl e earth,"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Horus has also seized the dom ain of Sut, the wilderness, which was a subj ect of cont ention in Amenta. Hence he says, “I have also seized the desert — I, the invi ncible o ne, who avenge th his father and is fierce at the drow ning of his mother” (ch. 138 ). In his resurrection Horus com eth forth as “the heir of the temple” in Annu . He is called “the active and pow erful heir of the temple, 836 whos e arm resteth not ” in the m um my banda ges (ch. 115) . That is, as the avenge r of his father Osiris in Annu, where he rises with the whip or flail in his hand to drive the adve rsaries from the temple. Now Annu, the station of the temple, was the place of the pillar. The temple itself i n Annu, or Heliopol is, was know n by the name of Ha - ben - ben, the hous e of the pyr amidion or temple of the pinna cle, and the struggl e of Satan with Jesus on the pinna cle of the temple may be traced to that of Sut and Horus the heir of the temple or the Ha - be n - ben of Annu , follow ing the cont ention of the twin pow ers of darkne ss and light , or of food and famine in the wilderness. “All the kingdom s of the world” are more definitely presented to view as celestial localities upon Mount Hetep. There are ten divisio ns of this divine domain. The three scenes of struggl e betwixt Jesus and Satan are (1) in the wilderness, (2) on the pinnacle, and (3) on an exceeding high mount ain; and these can be paralleled in the conf licts between Horus and Sut. The forty days’ strugg le in the wilderness was in Amenta. Next, there was a struggl e on the ben - ben or pinna cle in Annu. And thirdly, Horus was carried off by Sut to the sum mit of Mount Hetep, where the two com batants were reconc iled by Shu. The mount was a figur e of the horizo n in the solar mythos . On this the warring twins were cons tellated as the Gemini, and may be seen cont inui ng their old conf lict still, as Sut and Horus in the mythos , or as Satan and Jesus in the Christian eschatology. The earth, or heaven, that was first divided in two halves between Sut and Horus in the mythol ogy is finally claimed to be the sole pos session of Horus, the conque ror and the legitimate heir of God the father in the eschatology. The trium ph of Horus ove r Sut is denot ed by his kindl ing a light in the dark of death for the Ka or spiritual image in Amenta (Rit., ch. 137 A ). He was not onl y the light of the world in the mortal sphe re. As it is said in the Ritual, “O light ! Let the light be kindl ed for the ka!” “Let the light be kindl ed for the nigh t which follow eth the day.” The light is called the eye of Horus, the glorious one , shining like Ra from the mount of glory, put ting an end to the oppos ition of the dark - hearted Sut (Rit., ch. 137 B ). The que stion of an historic Jesus is by no means so sim ple as the grossly simple early Christians thought . It is equa lly a que stion of the historic devil. From first to last the Lord and Satan are twin, and without Satan there is no Christ - Jesus nor any need of a redeemer. In the mythol ogy Horus was the lord o f light and Sut the adve rsary, or the Satan of drought and darkne ss, from the time when the two cont ende d as the black bird and the white (or the gol den hawk), or as the two lions (our lion and uni corn a - fight ing in the moonl ight for the crow n), as the Reh us are described in the 80t h chapter of the Ritual. As there was no Horus without Sut in the mythos , so there is no Jesus without Satan in the history. The brotherhood or twinship of Horus and Sut the betrayer is repeated in the canoni cal Gospels. Sut was the brother of Horus, born twin with him in one pha se of the mythos , or with Osiris in anot her. In like manne r Juda s is a brother of Jesus. Now , when Horus the yout h of twelve years makes his transformation into Horus the adul t, the man"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"of thirty years, it is as the enemy and eternal conqu eror of Sut who in the earth - life often had the uppe r hand. But the cont est 837 of the persona l Christ with a persona l Satan in the New Testament is no more historical fact than the cont est between the seed of the wom an and the serpent of evil in the Old. Both are mythical; both are Egypt ian mysteries. In the earlier narrative we have the struggl e between Horus and the Apap - serpent of evil reproduc ed as Gospel truth by a writer in Aramaic. In the later the conf lict betwee n Horus and Sut (or Satan in his anthropom orphi c gui se) has been repeated as Christian history. As mythos the Ritual expl ains bot h, and for ever disprove s their right to be cons idered historical. In one of the sayings assigne d to Jesus it is prom ised that “in glory, the disciples also shall sit upon twelve throne s, judgi ng the twelve tribes of Israel” (Matt. XIX. 28) . Now , when this was said according to Matthew, Juda s the traitor was one of the twelve. Moreove r, as reported by Luke , the same thing is utter ed by Jesus after “Satan entered into Juda s who was called Iscariot, being of the num ber of the twelve,” and therefore one of thos e who are to sit on the twelve throne s in the future kingdom , and judge the twelve tribes of Israel. No defection of the son o f perdition is foreseen, no treachery allow ed for. Juda s is reckone d as one of the twelve who are to sit at the table of the Lord and eat and drink in the kingdom that is yet to com e (Luke XXII. 4 - 30) . There is but one way in which the traitor coul d remain one of the twelve in heaven. This belongs to the astronom ical mythol ogy, not to any hum an history, as when the sign of the scorpion is given to Sut - typhon. In the newly - recove red Gospel of Peter there is no sign of Juda s the betrayer having been one of th e twelve. Immediately after the resurrection, it is said, the feast of the Passove r being ende d, “We the twelve disciples of the Lord wept and grieved, and each of us in grief at what had happe ned withdr ew to his hous e” (Harris, page 56) . At the same time, in Matthew, the disciples are but eleven in num ber when they go to meet Jesus by appoi ntment on the mount , with Juda s no longe r one of them. Sut is as inseparable from Jesus in the Gospels as from Horus in the dua l figure of the Egyp tian twins. The name a lone is change d; otherwise it is Sut the devil who is the tempter of Jesus dur ing forty days and forty night s in the wilderness. It is Sut who carries Jesus to the sum mit of an exceeding high mount ain. It is Sut who, as persona l oppone nt, is seen to fall a s light ning from heaven. It is Sut the betrayer who enters Juda s to becom e the betrayer of Jesus. Also an historical Christ implies, invol ves, necessitates an historical devil. According to the canoni cal record the two must stand or fall toge ther as realit ies. Both are persona l or neither. And bot h were pre - extant as Horus and Sut, who were neither persona l nor historical. Inde ed, it is asserted by Lactantius ( Inst. Div., B. 2, ch. 8), that the Word of God, the logos of John, is the first - born brother of Sa tan. That is hone stly spoke n and true, if we re - identify the word with the Horus who was bor n twin with Sut. He is wrong in making Horus the logos the first - born, but that is of little impor tance. Otherwise, he has got the twins all right . Sut was the firs t - bor n, but the birthright belonge d to Horus who was the real heir. Now the “word of God” is made flesh in Jesus, and the cont ention of the twin - pow ers of darkne ss and light is rende red 838"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":" historically in the conf licts between Jesus and Satan in the wil derness, upon the pinna cle, or the moun t, or in the harvest - field. The cont est is also illustrated by Luke (VIII. 12) : “Then com eth the devil and taketh away the word from their heart that they may not believe and be saved.” This is one with Sut in und oing what Horus the Word had done , especially in sow ing the seed of the logos . The contention of Sut and Horus is carried out betwixt Satan and Jesus to the last. Sut, the king in his turn, was triumpha nt ove r Horus in his suffering and death. “I go away,” say s Jesus, “for the prince of this world com eth, and he hath not hing in me” (John XIV. 30) . Beelzebub, God of flies, is the particular name assigne d to Satan in the Gospels as the prince of devils. And as Sut was Prince of the Sebau, it seems proba ble that the “zebub, ” or infernal flies, may have been identical with and therefore derived by name from that spawn of Satan the Sebau, the associates of Sut on the night of the great battle in the Ritual. In the parable of the sow er it is said, “When anyone hearet h the word of the kingdom , and unde rstande th it not , then com eth the evil one (the adve rsary Sut or Satan) and snatcheth away that which hath been sow n in his heart” (Matt. XIII. 19). And in “the parable of the tares” it is said, “He that sow eth the good s eed is the son of man”; and of the good seed, “these are the sons of the kingdom ; and the tares are the sons of the evil one ; and the enemy that sow ed them is the devil” (Matt. XIII. 36 - 39) . This is the cont ention of Horus and Sut in the harvest - field of O siris represented in parables instead of in the mysteries. Horus sow s the good seed and Sut the tares. When Horus rises in Amenta after death it is as the hus bandm an or harvester who com es to gather in the harvest previous ly sow n for the father by Horus in the earth of Seb, and to vanqui sh Sut, the sow er of the tares, the thor ns, and thistles in Anrutef. The judgm ent of the world by Horus and the casting out of Sut is spoke n of as a present fulfilment. “Now is the (or a) judgm ent of this world. Now shall t he prince of this world be cast out ” (John XII. 31, 32). This judgm ent was annua l in the mysteries of Amenta. Sut as prince of this world and the son of perdition was cast out and judgm ent passed on thos e who were to be no more. This was at the time when H orus as the son of man was glorified, and Sut with his associates were onc e more ove rthrow n by him on the highw ays of the damned. In John’ s account of the betrayal and arrest, when Jesus declares himself, the soldiers and officers who are with Juda s are “s truck to the ground ,” or “they went backw ards and fell to the ground” (John XVIII. 6, 7). So when “Horus repul ses the associates of Sut,” they see the diadem upon his head and “fall upon their faces in presence of his Majesty” (Rit., 134 , 11) . Sut put out the eye of Horus. This is parodi ed in the Gospels when Jesus is blindf olded and then asked to tell who struck him in the dark. We get one other passing glimpse of Sut and Horus the cont endi ng twins in the parable of the marriage feast (Matt. XXII). The wi sdom of the Kamite mysteries was memorized in the sayings , and made portable in the parables. And in this the parable represents the marriage in the mystery of Tattu (Rit., ch. 17). Horus was the king’s son for whom the feast was made. He is Horus of the r oya l count enance in the mythos ; the wearer of the Greek cloak of 839 "},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"roya lty in the Rom an catacom bs. The king is Ra who issues the invi tation to the festival of “Com e thou hither,” which is represented by the Gospel marriage feast, to which thos e invi ted woul d not com e. Sut as the adve rsary of Horus is the unbi dde n marriage gue st who had no weddi ng garment on. The murderers who slay the servants of the king are the Sebau and co - cons pirators of Sut, and the vindi ctive treatment that follow ed becom es intell igible onl y by means of the mythos . The conf lict betwixt Satan and Jesus attains a culmination astronom ically. In the betrayal of Osiris the Good Being by the evil Sut there are seventy - two cons pirators associated with the adve rsary. Seventy - two on the on e hand as the pow ers of darkne ss imply the same num ber of oppone nt pow ers fight ing on behalf of Horus or, it may be, Jesus on the other, the battle being in the seventy - two duode cans of the zodi ac. This war of Sut and Horus is repeated onc e more in the Gos pel when the seventy - two or the seventy “returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subj ect unt o us in thy name.” And he said unt o them, “I beheld Satan fallen as light ning from heaven.” “Behol d, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and ove r all the pow ers of the enemy.” The enemy was Sut, and as a sym bol in the zodi ac Sut was at one time figur ed in the scorpion - sign. Thus , the betrayal of Osiris happe ned when the sun or the bul l of eternity, as the divinity is also call ed, was in the sign of Scorpio. The sign of the bul l being secretly assaulted by the scorpion is well know n from the Mithraic monum ents according to Hyde (Drum mond , Ædipus Judai cus, pl. 13). In som e of the Greco - Egypt ian planisphe res, given by Kircher, Sut is also identified as the scorpion which slew Osiris (Drum mond , pl. 13). In the Gospel, pow er is given for the seventy - two to tread on the scorpion and to trium ph ove r all the pow ers of the enemy (Luke X. 17 - 20) . The two different num bers of seventy and s eventy - two for thos e whos e names were written in heaven show that bot h belong to the planisphe re which had been divided at two different periods into the heaven of seventy and the heaven of seventy - two divisions . We can now see how and why the betrayer kee ps his place as one of the twelve in the Gospel of Peter, and why he has been cast out in the Gospel according to Matthew. The Gospel of Peter was not historical, which means that it was astronom ically based; and according to the gnos is the twelve whos e th rone s were set in heaven are zodi acal, not ethni cal characters. Sut the betrayer was assigne d the scorpion as a type of evil. And as the scorpion he keeps his place, like Juda s in the Petrine Gospel, as one of the twelve who were to sit on twelve celestial throne s in spite of his defection, because the twelve originated as astronom ical and not as historical realities. The Gnos tics maintained that Jesus was the Lord for one year onl y, and that he suffered in the twelfth mont h, as did Osiris with the sun in the sign of Scorpio. Thus , the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus throne d upon Mount Olivet with the twelve around him – he being a “little apart” – is a figure of the solar god with the twelve who row the bark of Ra around the zodi ac. One result of turning the Egyp tian my thos into Christian history has been to inflict the most nefarious injustice on the Jews. By 840 shifting the scene of the Mysteries from the nether - earth of Amenta to the land of Jude a the ethni cal Jews have been thrust into the pos ition of the Typhoni a n enemies of the"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Good Being, the Sebau and the Sami, the pow ers of evil in the mythos and the conde mned manes in the eschatology. The Jews have been transmogr ified into the associates of Sut and the spawn of Satan. That is why the father of the Jews is cal led the devil, and a murderer from the beginni ng; the liar and the father of all lying. That is why Juda s is a devil; and the Jews as a peopl e figure in the same categor y with Herod, slayer of the innoc ents, with Juda s the betrayer of Jesus, and with the f iends of Sut, because they were charged with doi ng thos e things on earth which had onl y been and coul d onl y be enacted according to the mysteries in Amenta. For this perversion of the mythos the Jews have been hunt ed ove r the earth and persecuted ever sinc e. They have suffered precisely in the same way as the red - haired Typho nian animals suffered in ancient Egypt (Plutarch, Of Isis and Osiris, 30, 31) , which were dedicated and doom ed to be slain in an avengi ng sacrifice because they represented the associat es of the wicked Sut, the liar, the betrayer, the murderer, who put to death and mutilated the body of the good Osiris. The sufferers on account of the mythos were the Typho nian ass, the pig, and the goa t. The sufferers on account of the “history” have bee n and still are the children of Israel. Whereas the Jews were no more racial in the Gospels than the accursed Sebau are Egypt ians in the Ritual. That they shoul d be made to appe ar so is but a result of literalizing and localizing the Osirian drama in a spu rious Jude an history. And here the present writer woul d remark that, in his view, the Jewish rejection of Christianity cons titutes one of the sanest and the bravest intellectual trium phs of all time. It is worth all that the race has suffered from the per secution of the Christian world. The Jews, like the Gnos tics, kne w well enough that the Christian schema was a “fake,” and, although they were una ble to expl ain how it had been manuf actured from the leavings of the past, they kne w that it was false, non - na tural and unne cessary. Up to the present time their victory may have been com paratively negative, in cons eque nce of their failure to retell the story in the onl y one authentic way, that is, with a sufficient grasp of the data. They have not been able to re instate the truth onc e conf ounde d and ove rthrow n, but they have bor ne witness dum bly, dogge dly, unc easingl y, with faces set like flint unf linchingl y against the lie. They woul d not believe that their God, though imaged anthropom orphi cally, had becom e a man , and so they have remained non - Christian to this day, never to be conve rted now . For at last the long infernal Jude n - Hetze nears its end; the time of their justification and trium ph is at hand, when the persecutor with the stone in his grasp will drop it sudde nly and flee helter - skelter for his life. T HE G ROUP IN B ETHANY . The canoni cal Gospels may be described as different collections of “episode s” and “sayings ,” and one of the most disconne cted of these episode s is to be found in the raising of Lazaru s from the tomb that 841 “was a cave” (John XI. 38), which cont ains a version of the resurrection of Osiris from the cave. The subj ect of all subj ects in the religious mysteries of the Egypt ians was the resurgence of the hum an soul from death and its tra nsformation into an eternal spirit. This"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"is the founda tion of the Book of the Dead or Ritual of the resurrection. So far as we know , this resurrection was originally represented in the mysteries of Memphi s, where Kheper - Ptah was the divinity that rose agai n in mummy - form from which the soul was seen to issue forth as a divine hawk. On entering Amenta as a still living being, though but a soul in matter, the Osiris, late deceased, addr esses the god in the character of thos e pow ers who effect the trium ph of O siris ove r all his adve rsaries, the chief of whom is Horus, in whos e name he is magically assimilated to the Son of God, and thus is one with Horus in his resurrection from the dead. It has now been show n that the resurrection of Osiris in Annu has been p artially reproduc ed as the raising of Lazarus in Bethany. Osiris repos ing in Annu is an image of the soul inert in matter or in decay and death. Hence he was por trayed in the likeness of the mum my called “the breathless one ,” also the god with the non - beat ing heart, who is laid out in the burial - place as a corpse - like form lying extende d at full lengt h, awaiting his resurrection from the fune ral couc h, or the transfigur ation into the risen sahu of the glorified. In his first adve nt Horus is the son of Seb, God of earth. In his second, he is the son of Ra, the Holy Spirit. It is in this latter character that he enters Amenta to represent the resurrection of the Osiris in the earth of eternity. The resurrection of the sun from out the grave of night ; the re - a rising of vegetation from the grip of winter; and of the waters returning periodi cally from their sour ce; that is the resurrection in external nature; it was, in shor t, the resurrection of new life from the old, in a variety of phe nom ena, mystically imaged by zoot ype s like the serpent of Rannut ; the frog or beetle of Ptah; the shoot of papyrus, or the green branch of endl ess years. The doc trine culminated in a resurrection of the soul of hum an life from the body of death that was imaged by the mum my - Osiris, the god who in his rising again uni ted all pha ses of the doc trine unde r one type of the resurrection, viz., that of the risen mum my defecated to the cons istency of a sahu, or a spiritual body. It is as the recons tituter of his father in Amenta that Horus raises Osiris from the tom b. He calls the mum my to com e forth and assum e the likeness of Ra the later god . Osiris is now glorified by Ra the Holy Spirit. The mum my being an image of the earlier body - soul that was transubs tantialized into spirit. As it is s aid, Osiris is “renewed in an instant,” and it is his son Horus who thus establishes him upon “the pedestal of Tum ” (Atum Ra) the god in spirit (Rit., ch. 182 ). The resurrection of the hum an soul in the after - life was the central fact of the Egypt ian reli gion, and the transfigur ed, re - erected mum my, otherwise called the Karast, was a supr eme sym bol . The ope ning day of New Year, the day of “Com e thou to me,” was named from the resurrection, which was solar in the mythos and spiritual in the eschatology. The mum my - type was divinized to preserve intact that bodi ly form which suffered dissolution after death. This, as mum my 842 of the god in matter, was a type invi olate and imperishable. Osiris in his coffin doe s not see corrupt ion. In him was life for evermo re. And as with the divine exemplar, so was it pos tulated for all who died in Osiris. He was terribly mutilated by the evil Sut, and his mum my had to be joined toge ther again piecemeal, for as it is said to Osiris, “I com e to embalm thee,” thou has t existe nce “with thy members” when these were put toge ther."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"And again, “I have com e myself and delivered the god from that pain and suffering that were in trunk , in shoul der and in leg.” “I have com e and healed the trunk, and fastened the shoul der and made firm t he leg” (ch. 102, Renouf ). This was in recons tituting the persona lity, which was performed in a mystery when the different parts of Osiris, the head, the vertebræ, the thigh, the leg, the heel were collected at the coffin (Rit., ch. 18) . But the god in mat ter was also the god in spirit according to the mystery or modus ope randi of the Resurrection; or he became so by being blende d with Ra in his resurrection. In the Kamite mythos as in the totemic sociology , the son (of the mother) was earlier than the fat her. When it is said in the texts, “I am a son begot ten of his father; I am a father begot ten of his son, ” the sense of the expr ession turns on the son of the mother having been earlier than the father of the son. Child - Horus, Har - si - Hesi, is the mother’s son. Mother and son, as As - Ar; Isis and child, passed into the com plex of Asar or Osiris, the one great god in whom all previous pow ers were merged and uni fied at last. Isis had embodi ed a soul in matter or flesh, as her child, when there was as yet no God the Father, no God the Son, no Horus in spirit. This fatherhoo d of the spirit was founde d in Atum - Ra the father of spirits. Thence follow ed the sons hip in spirit of Horus in his second character as divine adul t. Ra in spirit represented the supr eme type o f deity whos e sym bol is the sun or solar hawk. Osiris remained the god in matter as the mum my in Amenta; Ra is described as calling on Osiris in the resurrection and is also said to bid the mum my “com e forth,” when the deity in matter was to be united with the god in spirit. But Horus, the Son of God, the belove d onl y begot ten son, is now the representative of Ra and the chief agent in the raising of the mum my - Osiris from the dead. He is the son who com es to the assistance, not onl y of the father, for the m ummy - Asar is bot h Isis and Osiris in one body. Hence it is said in the chapter by which the tom b is ope ned for the Osiris to com e forth, “I am Horus the recons tituter of his father, who lifteth up his father, and who lifteth up his mother with his wand (ro d or staff)” (Rit., ch. 92, Renouf ). As it is said in the Ritual (ch. 78) , “it is Horus who hath recons tituted his father and restored him” — after the mutilation of his body by the murderer Sut. He descends into the fune ral land of darkne ss and the shadow o f death. He ope ns the Tuat to drive away the darkne ss so that he may look upon his father’s face. He says pathetically, “I am his belove d son. I have com e to pierce the heart of Sut and to perform all duties to my father” (ch. 9, Renouf ). Horus the prince in Sekhe m also upl ifts his father as Osiris - Tat with his two arms clasped behind him for suppor t (ch. 18) . In this mythical character of the son who gives life, recons titutes, restores and re - establishes his father, the Egyp tians cont inue d an inne r African type of the “Son who makes 843 his Father.” Miss Kings ley called attention to a function of the Oil - river - Chief who has to obs erve the custom of “making his father” onc e every year. The custom is sacred and sym bol ical, as the deceased chief need not be his own real father, but must be his predecessor in the headm anship (Kings ley, M., West African Studi es, p. 146 ). This custom of “making his father” by the son survived and was perpetuated in the mythol ogy of Egypt , in which Horus is the son who makes, or “recons titutes,” his father onc e a year, and describes it as one of his dut ies in the Book of the Dead. This resurrection of the"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"father as the soul of life in matter, i.e., the mummy - soul , by Horus the son, is the great mystery of the ten mysteries which a re briefly described in the 18t h chapter of the Ritual. In a later scene there is anot her description of the resurrection of Osiris, in which the mum my - god is raised by his son Horus from the tom b. As it is said, “Horus exalteth his father Osiris in every place, associating Isis the Great with her sister Nepht hys ” as the two wom en at the tom b. “Rise up, Horus, son of Isis, and restore thy father Osiris” — that was Osiris in the inert and breathless condi tion of the mum my. “Ha, Osiris, I have com e to thee. I am Horus, and I restore thee unt o life upo n this day with the fune ral offerings and all good things for Osiris.” “Rise up, then, Osiris. I have stricken dow n thine enemies for thee; I have delivered thee from them.” “I am Horus on this fair day at the beau tiful com ing forth of thy pow ers (in his resurrection) , who lifteth thee up with himself on this fair day as thine associate God. ” “Ha, Osiris, thou hast received thy sceptre, thy pedestal, and thy flight of stairs beneath thee.” On the coffin of Nes - Shu - T efnut , at Vienna , it is said: “Horus ope neth for thee thy two eyes that thou mayest see with them in thy name of Ap - Uat.” (Renouf , Book of the Dead, ch. 128 , note 8.) Horus as son of Ra the Holy Spirit in the eschatology is now highe r in status than the mu mmy - god, the father and mother in matter. Hence he rises in Amenta as the resurrection and the life to his ow n father Osiris. Horus as the divine heir had now been furnished with the doubl e force. The gods rejoice to meet him walking on the way to Annu , a nd the hall of the hor izon or hous e in Annu where divine perfum es are awaiting him and mour ning doe s not reach him, and where the gua rdians of the hall do not ove rthrow the mysterious of face who is in the sanctuary of Sekhe m. That is Osiris, who is not de ad but sleeping in Annu , the place of his repos e, awaiting the call that bids the mum my to “com e forth to day.” Horus, the deliverer of his father, reaches him in the train of Hathor , who is Meri, the belove d by name in the Ritual. Thus Horus follow s Meri to the place where Asar lies bur ied in the sepul chre, as Jesus follow s Mary, who had com e forth to meet him on the way to Bethany (John XI. 29, 33) . Jesus reaches the tom b of Lazarus in the train of Mary and Martha. Horus makes the way for Osiris. He repul ses the attack of Apap, who represents negation or non - being= death. The portrait of Horus in this scene is very grand. His face is glorified and greatened by the diadem which he wears as the lord of strengt h. His doubl e force is imaged by two lions . A loud voi ce is heard upon the hor izon as Horus lifts the truth to Ra, and the way is made for Osiris to com e 844 forth at his rising from the cave. So Jesus “cried with a loud voi ce, Lazarus, com e forth!” and “he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot w ith grave - bands .” In the original the mum my - Osiris com es forth as Amsu, with one arm onl y released from the banda ges. In the “discour se of Horus” to his Father at his coming forth from the sanctuary in Sekhe m to see Ra, Horus says, “I have given thee thy v ictory, I have given thee thy two eyes (mertæ), I have given thee Isis and Nepht hys ,” who are the two divine sisters, the Mary and Martha of Beth - Annu ( Records, vol . 10, p. 163) . In show ing that “mour ning doe s not reach him,” Jesus “abode at that time two days in the place where he was.” After the sisters had sent to say that Lazarus was sick he waited unt il he was dead on pur pos e to perform the more effective miracle. He was in Bethany, “the place where John was at the first baptizing” (cf. John I. 28 with John X. 40, 41), but it took him two more days to get"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"there at this particular time. So that Lazarus had been bur ied four days when Jesus arrived in the village. The tom b of Osiris was localized in Annu, the solar birthpl ace. Osiris, unde r one of his titl es, is the great one in Annu. Annu is the place of his repos e. “I go to rest in Annu, my dw elling, ” says Osiris. The deceased also goe s to rest in Annu because it was the place of repos e for Osiris the god (ch. 57, 4, 5). Jesus goe s to rest in Bethany. The place of repos e for Osiris was his sepul chre in Annu. The place of repos e for Lazarus is the cave in Bethany. It was in Annu that the soul was uni ted to its spiritual body . Annu is termed the place “where thous ands reuni te themselves” soul and body. The s peaker says, “Let my soul see her body. Let her uni te herself to her sahu” — that is, to the glorified body which can neither be destroye d nor injured; the future body in which the soul woul d be incorporated to pass from out the tomb. Annu is called the abod e of “thos e who have found their faces.” These are the mum my - forms, from whos e faces the napki n had been remove d. The hous e or beth of Osiris, then, was in Annu . “He rests in Annu, which is his dw elling. ” The names of its bui lders are recorded. Num raised it on its founda tion. Seshet (or Sefekh) bui lt it for him as his hous e of refuge and of rest (Rit., 57, 4, 5). The hous e of Osiris in Annu was called Hat - Saru, the hous e of the Prince — that is, the abode of Horus when he came to raise Osiris from the tom b. It was the sanctuary of Osiris who was attende d by the two Mertæ or Merti, the pair of divine sisters better know n by the names of Isis and Nepht hys . The househol d prope r cons ists of Osiris and thos e two sisters who watch ove r him. Mer denot es the eye, ti is two, and these are the two eyes or two watchers ove r Osiris in the abode that is the place of his burial and rebirth. The two sisters as watchers are the two Mer, one of whom becom es Mary, the other Martha, as the two merti in Bethany= Beth - Annu. The tri um ph of Osiris was effected ove r his adve rsaries by Horus in the hous e of the Prince in Annu or Heliopol is, and his supr eme trium ph was in his resurrection when he was recalled to life and raised up from the sepul chre by Horus (Rit., ch. 1). The raising up of Osiris the father by Horus the son is doc trinally based upon the father living ove r again in the son. Unde r the beetle - type Kheper 845 as father transformed into the son. It was the same with Atum - Iu, in whom the father became the son and then the so n transformed into the father. The mystery was deepened in the Osirian drama by supe raddi ng a more spiritual form of the fatherhood in Ra the Holy Spirit. The deceased Osiris is in pos session of the fune ral meals in Annu. He sits beneath the trees of Annu in the train of Hathor - Meri (Rit., ch. 68, 10). Annu is the place of provi sions for the manes. Thous ands are nou rished or fed in Annu (89). The deceased in Annu (82) receives his vesture or Taau - garment from the godde ss Tait, who is ove r him. This is an il lusion to the mum my - case from which the left arm was not yet freed when Amsu - Horus rose up in the sepul chre. The godde ss Tait is a form of one of the two divine sisters. She cooks the food and brings it to the deceased, who is either Osiris, or the Osiris, the God or the manes. Annu was also the place of the festivals of Osiris. One of these was kept on the sixth day of the mont h. “I am with Horus,” says the speaker on the day when the festivals of Osiris are celebrated, “on the feast of the sixth day of th e mont h” (ch. 1, lines 23, 24) . With this we may com pare the follow ing statement: “Jesus therefore six days before the passove r came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"raised from the dead. So they made him a suppe r there” (John xii.) The two sister s were present. “Martha served, and Mary anoi nted the feet of Jesus and wiped them with her hair.” Annu is described as a green and pleasant place, an oasis in the desert of Amenta created for the suffering Osiris, and the two divine sisters were given hi m there for his com fort and delight (ch. 17, 138 , 139 ). The tree of life stood in Annu, as the sycamore, tamarisk, or persea tree, which was personi fied in Hathor - Meri or Isis. The manes were feasted “unde r the foliage of the tamarisk” (ch. 124, 6), the br anches of which are described as the beautiful arms of the godde ss, and the foliage as her hair, when she herself was the tree beneath which the Osiris foun d refreshing shade. It seems that not onl y the clouds of dawn, but also the foliage of the tamarisk tree may have imaged the hair of the godde ss. Osiris - Ani is found in Annu with the hair of Isis spread ove r him (Rit., ch. 17) . In anot her text the hair is assigne d to Hathor — one of whos e names is Meri (ch. 35, 1). And this is proba bly related to the story of Mary wiping the feet of Jesus with the hair of her head. Isis is freque ntly por trayed kneeling at the feet of Osiris in Annu . It is she who says: “I who drop the hair which hath loos ely fallen upon my brow — I am Isis, when she conc ealeth herself” (ch. 1 7, 135 ). Osiris in Annu, like Lazarus in Bethany, was not dead but sleeping. In the text of Har - hetep (Rit., ch. 99) the speaker who persona tes Horus is he who com es to awaken Asar out of his sleep. Also, in one of the early fune ral texts it is said of the sleeping Asar: “The Great One waketh, the Great One riseth; Horus raises Osiris upon his feet.” Jesus denies that Lazarus is dead. “Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep. I go that I may awake him out of his sleep” (ch. XI, 11) , which is genui ne Egypt ian do ctrine. The manes in Amenta were not looke d upon as dead, but sleeping, breathless of body, motionl ess of heart. The deity Osiris was not dead. And in his likeness the Osiris lived. Hence Horus com es to wake the sleepers in their coffins, or Osiris in his cave. 846 It was in Bethany that “Jesus wept.” It is the place of weeping for the dead Lazarus. Mary wept, the Jews wept, and “Jesus wept.” No wonde r. This is the place of weeping by name in the Ritual, where the Osiris lay in his burial. It was here he was inert and motionl ess. The Osiris says: “I am motionless in the fields of thos e who are dum b in death. But I shall wake, and my soul will speak in the dw elling of Tum , the Lord of Annu. ” The abode of Tum in Annu being= Bethany. Then he rises from the to mb and appe ars at the door , and says, “I arrive at the conf ines of earth. I tread the dw elling of the god Rem - Rem.” Rem signi fies weeping: and in the Litany of Ra this god is designa ted “Remi the Weeper.” Thus Jesus is por trayed in the character of “Remi t he Weeper” in the place of weeping for the dead Osiris in Beth - Annu , who is here represented as the dead Lazarus in Bethany (Rit., 75, Renouf ). Jesus com es as “Remi the Weeper” to weep for the inert Osiris, that is, as Horus who com es to the motionl ess Osi ris on the day which is called “Com e thou to me.” Ra is said to make the mum my “com e forth” (The Litany of Ra, 68; Rit., 17). Jesus cries with a loud voice, “Lazarus, com e forth!” and “he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave - bands : and his face was bound about with a napki n” (John XI. 43, 44) . The picture is completed in the Rom an catacom bs,"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"where the risen Lazarus is an Egypt ian mum my: the likeness of the mum my - Osiris, who is beckone d forth by Horus with his staff. According to the dra matic representation in the Mysteries, Osiris is slain by the adve rsary Sut, and is imaged in Amenta as a mum my. The father lives again in the son; hence his son Horus descends into the nether - world to avenge , recons titute and raise Osiris from his corpse - like state. He com es as a living soul from Ra the Holy Spirit, who is the Father in heaven, “to raise up the hand which is motionl ess” (Rit., ch. 5). “He lifts inert Osiris with his two arms” (ch. 18) . He exclaims, “Ha! Osiris, I am com e to thee: I am Horu s, and I restore thee to life upon this day, with the fune rary offerings and all good things for Osiris. Rise up, then, Osiris (ch. 128). Horus hath raised thee.” It is said, “Hail, Osiris, thou art bor n twice” (Rit., ch. 170 ). In som e texts it is Ra who b ids the mum my com e forth on the day of “Com e thou to me” (Rit., ch. 17) . Taht says: “I give Ra to enter the mysterious cave in order that he may revive the heart of him whos e heart is motionl ess” (ch. 182) . After the raising of Osiris, Taht says, “I have c elebrated the festival of Eve’s prove nde r,” or suppe r, which came to be called the Last Suppe r. The raising of Lazarus is likewise com memorated by a suppe r. “So they made him a suppe r there” (John XII. 2). When Osiris, or the Osiris, “takes the form of a living soul ” (Rit., ch. 181 ), it is said, “thy son Horus recons titutes thee. Arise, Osiris, thy hands have been given to thee” – he is freed from the mum my - banda ges – “stand up living for ever.” “The two sisters Isis and Nepht hys com e to thee; they will fill t hee with life, health, and all kinds of good things within thy reach” (ch. 181) . Amongs t other ceremoni es performed in the Amenta at the raising of the mum my who is “called aloud” from the sepul chre the Osiris is freed from the banda ges with which the corp se was bound. So when Lazarus 847 was called in a loud voice to com e forth, “He that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave - bands , and his face was bound about.” In the resurrection ceremony of Osiris he is divested of his fune rary garment an d receives a banda ge of the finest linen from the hands of the attenda nt of Ra, the Father in heaven (Rit., ch. 172) . He eats of “the meat which has been prepared by Ra in his hol y place”; he washes his feet in silver basins, which have been sculptured by the divine architect Ptah - Sekari (ch. 172) . In the Gospel, Jesus, “know ing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he came forth from God and goe th unt o God, riseth from suppe r, and layeth aside his garments; and he took a tow el and g irded himself. Then he pour eth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the tow el wherewith he was girded” (ch. XIII. 4 - 6). Taking Lazarus, then, to represent the mum my - Osiris, we find the “raising of Lazarus” celebr ated in a hym n expr essly devot ed to the subj ect. It is one of the ceremoni es that were performed in the unde rworld. The Osiris is designa ted him “who is called aloud. ” “O thou who art called aloud, thou who art called aloud , thou the lamented, thou art glo rified. O thou who art raised up, thou art raised up. N. has been raised up by means of all the manifold ceremoni es performed for him.” The mummy - Osiris lay upon the fune ral couc h in the mysterious cave with the two sisters in attenda nce. Horus enters this cave as representative of Ra, to revive the heart of him"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"whos e heart is motionl ess. He says, “Hail, Osiris, thou art born twice! Arise on thy bed and com e forth! Com e! Com e forth.” Osiris or the Osiris is called with a loud voi ce. In the hym n of the resur rection, he is addr essed nine times over in the words “O Thou who art called aloud! ” (chs. 170 - 2). They call him to com e forth “like a god” from the mysterious cave “to meet the pow ers of Annu .” The resurrection is celebrated with rejoicings , “thou hearest how thou art glorified through all thy hous e!” There are nine verses in the hym n and each one ope ns with the address, “O thou who art called aloud !” That is for his rising up and com ing forth from the cave in Annu (ch. 172 ). The words “O thou who art call ed aloud” had becom e the title of the hym n, as we say “the Magni ficat,” or “the Te Deum ” (Naville, Rit., ch. 172 ). The latest dyna sty of Egypt ian deities were bor n of Seb the earth - father and Nut the mother - heaven. This was the Osirian group , consisting o f five persons , viz., (1) Asar, (2) the elder Horus, (3) Sut, (4) Isis, (5) Nepht hys , which may be called the family in Annu and show n to be the originals of the group in Bethany. Sut, the betrayer, is the only one om itted from the Gospel. The remaining fo ur – Lazarus=Asar; Jesus=Horus; Mary= Isis; Martha=Nepht hys – are also represented som etimes in the Ritual without Sut (ch. 128 ). When it is said that Horus exalteth his father Osiris in every place he associates Isis the Great with her sister Nepht hys . Sut is not include d in the group at Annu. On the other hand, Sut, in the person of the betrayer, is present at the mortuary meal in the canoni cal Gospels. At present we onl y need to identify Lazarus with Osiris, Jesus with Horus, and the two sisters of Lazarus wi th the two sisters of Osiris. Osiris lying as a breathless mum my in the cave, 848 when Horus com es to raise him from the dead, is watched ove r and protected by the two Mertæ - sisters, one at the head and one at the feet as keepers of the body , and watcher s in the bur ial - place. The two mertæ are mentione d in chapter 58. In this the Osiris cries, “Let the door be ope ned to me” as the Osiris bur ied in Amenta. “Who is with thee?” is asked. The reply is, “It is the mertæ,” the two watchers over Osiris in the se pul chre. The deceased then asks that he may have milk, cakes and meat given to him at the hous e which is in Annu , the Kamite prototype of Bethany. On the way to the sepul chre in Annu Horus meets the two sister - godde sses, saying to them “Hail, ye pair of go dde sses Mertæ, sister pair, Mertæ! I inform you of my words of power. I am Horus, the son of Isis, and I am com e to see my father Osiris,” and to raise him up from the sepul chre. Jesus on his way to the cave of Lazarus likewise informs Martha of his words of pow er, saying “thy brother shall rise again.” “I am the resurrection and the life.” “He that believeth on me shall never die” (John XI. 25, 26). “Now as they went on their way a certain wom an named Martha received him (Jesus) into her hous e. And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at the Lord’s feet (like Isis) and heard his word.” And because Mary took her place at the feet of Jesus it is said that she had “chos en the good part” (Luke X. 38, 42) . The two sisters in Bethany are the Aramaic or He brew replica of Isis and Nepht hys , who are the attenda nts upon Osiris; the two divine sisters of Osiris in Annu. Mary and Martha are the two sisters of Lazarus in Bethany. Horus love d the two dear sisters Isis and Nepht hys , and is especially denom inated th e son who love s his father, i.e., Asar,"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"whom he raises from the tom b according to the dramatic representation. Jesus is said to have “love d Martha and her sister, and Lazarus” (John XI. 5). Jesus saith, “Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep, but I go that I may awake him out of sleep” (John XI. 4, 11) . So is it in the Ritual. Horus says, “I go to give move ment to the manes. I go to com fort him who is in a swoon, ” which is equi valent to Lazarus who sleeps (ch. 64) . He goe s to give life at som e particular spo t and in doi ng this he com es from Sekhe m to Annu where the mum my of Osiris rested in the hous e there=Beth - Annu or Bethany. The Osiris doe s not die. The Ritual has no recogni tion of death, save as final extinction when death and evil die toge ther. Osiris sl eeps, he is breathless or in a swoon. He lies inert, his heart is motionl ess pro tem. Osiris thus awaits his change and resurrection; but he cannot die who is the conque ror of death and the bonda ge of the grave. The resurrection of Osiris at the com ing of Horus is glanced at when the speaker persona tes him and says, “I am the great first heir (or inhe ritor) taking pos session of Urt - hat” — otherwise the inert, sleeping, motionless Osiris. “Strengt h of Osiris is my name. I save him” from the impurities of matte r. “He lives by me.” The speaker is Horus with his father Ra, just as Jesus is with his father in the scene of raising Lazarus (John 11, 45). The resurrection appl ies to Osiris in matter whom Horus com es to qui cken and raise up from the dead or, as it is r ende red, “from the impur ities of Osiris” in matter. The “corrupt ion which befell Osiris” in 849 his mum my - condi tion is mentione d in the Ritual more than onc e. This also befalls the corpse of Lazarus, but is more grossly stated in the Gospel. Jesus com es to raise up Lazarus when he has been in the tom b four days, and Martha saith, “Lord, by this time he stinke th” (John XI. 39) . In the Ritual, when Horus com es to thos e who are in their cells he utters the words of Ra to raise the dead, and says, as the pass age is rende red by Budge , “I am the herald of his words (his father’s) to him whos e throat stinke th”; that is, to the sufferer from corrupt ion in the tom b ( Book of the Dead, ch. 38 B , line 4). Isis not onl y stands or sits at the feet of Osiris, she is the Seat personi fied. She carries the sign of the seat upon her head. Her name of Hes signi fies the seat. And Mary, who takes the place of Isis, is described as sitting at the feet of Jesus, whilst Martha is bus y working about the hous e and left serving alone. A further allusion to the Lady of the Seat may be found when Martha heard that Jesus was com ing, and went forth to meet him, whilst “Mary still sat in the hous e” (John XI. 20, 21) , thus fulfilling the character of Isis, the seat, or the sitter. There is m ore than meets the eye in the sign of the seat which is bor ne by Isis. To sit is also to brood as a bird. Isis as sitter is the brood - hen, the incuba tor in Annu . Unde r this type of the sitting - hen she sits at the feet of Osiris to bring him to rebirth. Mar y also sat in the hous e, and kept her seat at the feet of Jesus. Nepht hys , the other divine sister in Annu , carries the sign of a hous e on her head. She is called mistress of the hous e. She is the benevol ent, saving sister. This in the “history” is rende re d by Martha being the hous ekeeper and by Mary sitting in the hous e while her sister goe s forth to meet the Lord (John XI. 21) . In Aramaic, Martha denot es the mistress of the hous e, and Nepht hys , one of the two mertæ, is the mistress of the hous e, who carri es the hous e as a sym bol in her head - dress. The name of Nepht hys in Greek represents nebt - hat, the mistress of the hous e in Egypt ian. The two sisters are the merti or"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"mertæ, who were the keepers of the doubl e hous e in attenda nce upon Horus, or Jesus. They receive the Sun - God at his entrance to the mount ain in the West, and stand toge ther by him when he issues forth at dawn from Beth - Annu, or Bethany, in the East. The name of the secret shrine in which the mum my - Osiris was upr aised by “the two arms of Horus, Prince of Sekhe m,” is “the witness of that which is raised,” or the witness to the Resurrection (ch. 17). Thos e who are present in this scene are “Osiris, Isis, Nepht hys , and Horus the recons tituter of his Father,” and these, as we maintain, are the proto type s or original characters of Lazarus, Mary, Martha and Jesus in the scene of the Resurrection in Bethany. Osiris rose from the dead to enter the little gol den ark of the moon on the third day. He was bur ied on the 17t h of Hathor and the resurrection in the luna r ark was on the 19t h; that is, on the third day. In the solar mythos he rises again the day after the bur ial, and as the grain he rose again in forty days. But there is anot her mystery of Osiris, an account of which is given by Plutarch, proba bly from the writings of Manetho. This he calls the “Mour ning of the Godde ss,” which began on the 17th of Hathor , the day on which Osiris was betrayed at the last suppe r and mutilated by the adve rsary Sut. He says the “Mour ning of the Godde ss” lasted 850 “f our ” days altoge ther, beginni ng on the 17t h, the day of betrayal and death of Osiris; and on the 19t h it was proclaimed by the priests that the lost Osiris was found because he had then entered into the ark of the moon where the light was onc e more safe. H e tells us that amongs t other melanchol y things that were acted on this occasion, as the mourning of the cow for Osiris the bul l of Amenta, a gilded cow , the gol den Hathor , was cove red with a black linen pall and expos ed to publ ic view for four day s at the mour ning of the godde ss, or of the cow , for the lost Osiris. Here, then, are the four day s of mour ning which are repeated in the one Gospel that chroni cles the raising of Lazarus from the dead after “he had been in the tom b four day s already .” Plutarch ca lls this mystery the mourning of the godde ss. But there are always two mour ners for Osiris, Isis and Nepht hys , who are his sisters. The process of reduc ing the fairy - godm other’s coach - and - six to the status of a one - hor se cab may be seen in the Gospel acco rding to Luke in getting rid of Osiris. The pair of sisters, Martha and Mary, appe ar in this Gospel, but without their brother Lazarus, and also without the resurrection. After all that has now been done tow ards identifying Bethany with the hous e in Annu a nd the nest of the two sisters, the two sisters with Isis and Nepht hys , and the Christ with Horus, it cannot be cons idered far - fetched if we look upon Lazarus as a form of the Osiris that was dead and bur ied and raised to life again. As to the name, the Eg ypt ian name of the Greek Osiris is Hesar, or Asar. And when we take into cons ideration that som e of the matter came from its Egypt ian sour ce through the Aramaic and Arabic langua ges (witness the Arabic Gospel of the Infancy) there is little difficulty, if any, in suppos ing that the Al (article the) has been adopt ed through the medium of the Arabic, or derived from the Hebrew prenom inal stem א ל , to empha size a thing, as in the Osiris, which passed into the article Al for “the” in Arabic, and was prefixed to the name of Osiris as Al - Asar, which, with the Greek “s” for suffix becom es L - azarus. The conne cting link whereby Al - Asar was turned into Lazarus, the Osiris, was"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"in all likelihood made in the Aramaic langua ge, which had its root - relations with the Egypt ian. H ierogl yphi c papyr i are among its monu mental remains, as well as the inscription of Carpentras. Various representations of the raising of Lazarus in the Rom an catacom bs show the mum my risen and standi ng in the door way of the tom b. The figur e of the suppos e d Jesus Christ is in front of the sarcopha gus calling upon Lazarus to com e forth, whilst touc hing the mum my with a want or rod which he hol ds in his hand. In the chapter “by which the tom b is ope ned to the soul and to the shade of the person that he may co me forth to day and have the mastery of his feet” (Rit., ch. 92) the deliverer Horus says, “I am Horus who lifteth up his father with his staff.” This mode of raising Osiris by Horus with his staff or rod com pletes the picture of the resurrection of Lazaru s. The rod that is waved by Jesus at the raising of Lazarus is the sym bol ic sceptre in the hand of Horus when he raises the Osiris. In every instance Lazarus is a mum my made after the Egyp tian fashion. It is a banda ged body that had been soaked in salt and pitch which was at times so hot that it charred the bone s 851 (Budge , “The Mum my,” pp. 153 - 155 ). Seventy days was the prope r lengt h of time requi red for embalming the dead body in making an Egypt ian mum my. Lazarus when por trayed in the Rom an catacom bs c om es forth from the tom b as an eviscerated, embalmed and banda ged mum my, warranted to have been made in Egypt . Now , according to the Gospel narrative, there was no time for this, as Lazarus had onl y been dead four days. The mum my, anyw ay, is non - historical ; and it is the typi cal mum my called the Osiris, Asar in Egypt ian, El - Asar in Aramaic, and Lazarus with the Greek terminal in the Gospel assigne d to John. The coffin of Osiris, cons tellated in the Greater Bear, was know n to the Arab astronom ers as the Bier of Lazarus. Asar, or the Osiris, is the mum my in the coffin, and with the coffin of Osiris identified as the bier of Lazarus it follow s perforce that the mum my - Osiris in the coffin is one with Lazarus on the bier. The gnos tic pictures in the Rom an catacom bs suffice to prove the identity. They show that Lazarus was bur ied as a mum my, and that he rose again in mum my - form. Thus the dead Osiris of Egypt , El - Asar or Lazarus, as por trayed in Rom e, and the story of the death, bur ial, and resurrection are the same wheresoever and how soever that story may be told. The bier of Lazarus, follow ed by the mour ning sisters, was onl y know n by that name because it had been cons tellated in the starry vault of the heavens ages earlier than the present era as the coffin of Osi ris. The story of the rich man and the begga r Lazarus related in the Gospel of Luke (ch. XVI. 19) is told at lengt h in the second tale of Khamuas as Egypt ian. This cont ains a scene from the Judgm ent in Amenta which is represented in the vigne ttes to the R itual. Setme and his son Si - Osiris enter the Tuat as manes. They pass through the seven halls (Rit., ch. 144) into the great judgm ent hall. They see the figur e of Osiris seated on his throne of gol d, “Anup the great god being on his left hand, the great go d Taht upon his right , the balance being set in the midst before them.” Anup gives the word, Taht writes it dow n. The rich man and the poor man enter to be judge d. “And behol d Setme saw a great man clothed in garment of bys sus (fine white linen), he being near to the place in which Osiris was,” in which pos ition he is great exceedingl y. Si - Osiris says, “My father Setme,"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"dos t thou not see this great man who is clothed in garment of bys sus, he being near to the place in which Osiris is? That poor man whom tho u sawest, he being carried out from Memphi s, there not being a man walking after him, he being wrappe d in a mat, this is he.” This refers to the fune rals of the rich man and the poor man on earth previous ly described (lines 15 - 21) . When the rich man was ju dge d it was found that his evil deeds were more num erous than his good deeds; therefore they out weighe d them in the scales of justice; cons eque ntly he was cast to the devour er of soul s who did not allow him to breathe again for ever. “It was com mande d befo re Osiris to cause to be throw n the burial out fit 852 of that rich man whom thou sawest, he being carried out from Memphi s, the praise that was made of him being great, unt o this poor man named, and that they shoul d take him (the poor man) amongs t the no ble spirits as a man of God that follow s Osiris - Sekari (the god in his resurrection) , he being near to the place in which Osiris is” (Griffith, second tale of Khamuas, pp. 149 , 158 ). Thus the parable of the rich man and Lazarus found in a folk - tale of the first century written in Demotic is prova bly Egypt ian and demons trably ancient by appl ication of the com parative process to the langua ge. Neither the name of Lazarus nor Osiris appe ars in the tale of Khamuas, which is good evidence that the story was not d erived from the Gospels. Thus we identify Lazarus with Osiris the mum my - god and Lazarus the poor man with Alasar as the Osiris. T HE F OUNDERS OF THE K INGDOM The elder Horus represented the wisdom of the Mother as her word or logos in the earth of Seb un til he reached the age of twelve years. Then, according to the drama of the Osirian mysteries, he passed into Amenta, where he rose again as Horus in spirit. It was in this, the earth of eternity, that he made his second adve nt when he came again to establ ish the kingdom of the father. In his death and resurrection or transformation from the body - soul to an eternal spirit, he had found the father in heaven, who is Ra the hol y spirit. And at his second adve nt Horus came to tell the joyf ul tidings to the mane s and to found the kingdo m in Amenta for the father who is now Osiris - Ra instead of the mum my - Osiris. Thus the kingdom of the Christ was founde d for the father by Horus and his follow ers at his second com ing to be represented in the mysteries of Amenta and the drama of Egypt ian eschatology as the second adve nt which was in the spirit, now set forth by Horus the immortal Son of God. The uni verse of Ptah, the supr eme architect, had been divided into the three regions of Amenta, earth and heaven. In these the re were three successive forms of a god the father — Seb was the god of earth, as father of phys ical sustenance; Osiris was the father in Amenta, where the dead were recons tituted and made to live again, and Ra the hol y spirit was the father of spirits in he aven. Thus the typi cal seven loaves of plenty were called the bread of Seb on earth, the bread of Osiris in Amenta, and the bread of Ra in heaven. Hum an Horus was the heir of Seb, his foster - father, in the life on earth. At his resurrection in Amenta, Horu s, as half - human, half - divine, is the heir of Osiris. In the"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"resurrection from Amenta when he had becom e pure spirit he was Horus divinized as heir of Ra, the father on high. And on behalf of this, the newly - found father, now the supr eme god, he returns to found the kingdom as the teacher of the mysteries in Amenta, and the saviour of the manes from the second death. Seb the father on earth was of the earth earthy. Osiris in Amenta was a god in matter; hence his mum my - form. The nature of these had been expo unde d in the lesser mysteries. Ra as father in heaven, or Huhi the eternal, is the god in spirit now , and Horus manifesting in the spirit com es to elucidate the greater mysteries to the twelve who, as the gnos is show s, had previous ly 853 been the teacher s of the lesser mysteries, and who now becom e the twelve with Horus, or Jesus, on the mount ain in the pha se of eschatology. Horus as the son of Ra was the representative of pow er supe rior to that of Osiris in Amenta, the god in matter, who was annua lly ove rthrow n by Sut in phys ical phe nom ena, and in this character he came to the assistance of Osiris in the sepul chre. Hence he disperses the darkne ss from his face. He recons titutes the body that Sut dismembered. He raises the arm that was paralyzed in death. He lifts the mum my to its feet. He is the link which uni tes matter with spirit, or Osiris with Ra. He brings the gnos is or word of life from the father in heaven to the previous ruling pow ers which include the earlier father on earth and in the nether - eart h, and therefore to the men on earth and manes in Amenta. Thus , at his second com ing, Horus had found his father, the father in heaven. He repeats his father’s words to thos e who are “deprived of breath” (Rit., ch. 38) . These are the words of salvation tha t “bring about the resurrection and the glory to the manes” (ch. 1) by means of the gnos is. We have now to follow Horus in his second Adve nt. He passed from the life on earth into the dark of death as Horus - Anaref, the sight less Horus. Death was imaged as the put ting out of sight by Sut the pow er of darkne ss, the manes being the blind. At his second com ing Horus is the giver of sight , or the beatific vision, to the blind. He shines into the tom bs of thos e who are slum bering darkly in their cells and wakes them from the trance of death. At this adve nt of Horus “the peopl e which sat in darkne ss saw a great light , and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death did light spring up” (Matt. IV. 16; also the Gospel of Nicode mus II. 2). But this, according to the Ritual and the “Pistis Sophi a,” was in Amenta, the hidde n earth, where the blind are made to see; a mout h is given to the dum b; the lame are enabled to walk; and the dead to rise again. Amenta, as he com es, is all in motion with dead matter turning into spirit - life; and when he rises from the sepul chre we are in the midst of thos e mysteries which have been rende red as Christian miracles in the Gospels. “I am com e,” says Horus, “as a sahu in the spiritual body, glorious and well equi ppe d; and that i s given to me which lives on amidst all overthrow .” This, we repeat, is the second com ing of Horus at the new birth in spirit which follow ed the old death in matter, or on earth, when Har - Ur, the child of Isis, was rebor n, and this time begot ten as the ano inted and belove d son of God the father. This time he who was the Word is the doe r, the word - made - truth. He com es to found the kingdom for the father in the earth of eternity or in spirit - world, not in Jude a or Palestine. The work of Horus in his resurrect ion from the dead was to fulfil the kingdo m of heaven on this founda tion of the"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"nether - earth, as foot hol d for eternity, the kingdom of heaven being spirit - world made palpable in the mythical representation of the mysteries. All along the line of descent t he astronom y suppl ied the moul d of the eschatology. There was a heaven astronom ically raised upon the two pillars of Sut and Horus sout h and nor th. Also on the two 854 hor izons of Harmachis, the doubl e Horus. The Heptanom is had its sevenfold founda tion. The heaven bui lt upon a four fold basis was the heaven founde d on the four cardinal poi nts, in the solstices and equi noxe s. Lastly, the zodi ac with twelve signs is the figur e of heaven raised upon a founda tion that is twelvefold. The mythical rulers corresp onde d num erically to the signs : the two, the four , the seven, the nine, and finally the twelve, at first as astronom ical type s, the gnos tic Æons , and afterwards as spirits or gods in the pha se of eschatology. Thus there are two categor ies in phe nom enal man ifestation, one being astronom ical, the other spiritual or eschatologi cal, as show n and expl ained in “Pistis Sophi a.” It now became the mission of Horus to make know n the newly - found father in heaven to thos e who had not so much as heard of the hol y spirit . It was the work of the anoi nted and belove d son to found the kingd om of heaven for the father in the father’s name. He became the teacher of the com ing kingdom , previous ly proclaimed by Anup the herald and forerunne r who was his John the Baptist crying i n the wilderness of the unde rworld. When Horus in his second adve nt com es to establish the kingdom for his father, who is Ra in the solar mythos and the hol y spirit in the eschatology, he has Two Witnesses who testify that he is verily the son of God the father in heaven and the true light of the world. These are the two Osirian Johns , Anup and Aan, or rather they are the originals of the two Johns in the canoni cal Gospels. They are portrayed as the two witnesses to the bird - headed Horus in his resurrectio n at the vernal equi nox . The planisphe re of Dende rah show s the jackal of Anup and the cynoc epha lus of Taht - Aan figur ed back to back upon the equi noc tial colure as the two principal witnesses for Horus, who are thus por trayed as suppor ters of the Eye which was renewed in Annu onc e every year (Planisphe re in a Book of the Beginni ngs ). As Egypt ian, these two witnesses for Horus are Anup the baptizer and Aan the divine scribe who is the penm an of the gods in the Ritual. We have seen them acting as the two witne sses for Horus in the Osirian judgm ent hall (see p. 705 ). They are also described as the two magi, or magicians. Where John begins his preaching in the canoni cal Gospel Anup is the typi cal ope ner of the way (Rit., ch. 26) . He is the forerunn er who announc es the day of reckoni ng; he makes the call to judgm ent; he judge s the world, just as John is the judge of the world who calls men and baptizes them to repentance (Rit., 31, Birch). Anup is also the educ ator preparatory to the adve nt of Horus who com es afte r him although he was before him in status and author ity (Rit., ch. 44) . Anup abode darkling in the desert of Amenta unt il the day of his manifestation in the heliacal rising of Sothis, the morning star of the Egypt ian year, which heralded the birth of Hor us. John dw elt in the wilderness till the day of his theopha ny or “shewing unt o Israel” (Luke I. 80) . The solar god was supe rior to either the luna r or stellar deity. As star - god, Anup had been the precursor. The moon - god, Aan, was the witness for Horus by night as reflector of the hidde n sun. This,"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"how ever, was but the mythical mould for the eschatology, in which Horus was no longe r merely the “little sun” of winter, but the son of Ra in spirit and the typi cal demons trator of 855 immortality to the manes in Amenta and to men upon the earth. The two Johns might be distingui shed from each other in the Gospels; John the Baptist from John the Divine, by means of Anup, the baptizer, and Aan, the writer of the record in the Ritual. The baptism doe s not actually take place in the Gospel according to John. In this there is onl y a description of the scene. And, although one John is present as the baptizer, there is no attempt made to distingui sh John the baptizer from John the scribe. But John the speaker is John t he scribe, and therefore to be discriminated from John the Baptist, who is not named as the baptist by John the writer. John the scribe is, of cour se, the writer, and he likewise bears witness as well as John the Baptist. For it is he who says, “and we beh eld his glory, glory as of the onl y begot ten from the Father.” This was manifested in the baptism when the heavens were ope ned and Jesus “saw the spirit of God descendi ng as a dove and com ing upon him; and lo! a voi ce out of the heavens saying, “This is my belove d Son in whom I am well pleased” (Matt. III. 16, 17) . Cons eque ntly John the scribe was present at the baptism to have beheld the glory of the onl y begot ten of the Father which was manifested in the one particular way at one particular time, but he w as not John the Baptist. Anup , like child - Horus, was bor n of the motherhood but not of the fatherhood, whereas the Horus of thirty years was the onl y begot ten Son of God the Father. So, in the Gospel, John the Baptist is among the greatest of thos e who wer e bor n of wom an (minus the fatherhood, in accordance with the primitive status), whereas Jesus, the Christ, was begot ten of God. The first Horus was bor n, the second Horus is begot ten. Such is the status of John and Jesus. Hence the saying “among them that are born of wom en there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist; yet he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he” (Matt. XI. 11). The characters all through are to be determined and differentiated by the doc trines. John the Baptis t doe s not enter the kingdom of heaven, which he helps to found as preparer of the way. So Anup is the gui de of ways in the wilderness of the unde r - world; he makes straight the path for the future life, but he doe s not enter the com ing kingdo m of the Son o f God when the doubl e earth is uni fied in the future heaven. His place is with the dead awaiting their resurrection. He watches, he bends ove r the mummy; he embraces and suppor ts it with tende rest solicitude ; he is master in the mount ain of rebirth for hea ven, but he himself remains in the low er earth. His rôle and his dom ain com e to an end where thos e of the divine heir of Osiris as the son of Ra begin. When Horus rises again to take pos session of his kingdom , Anup is por trayed as crouc hing in the tom b. He gives Horus his shoul der. He raises him up, but doe s not pass from out Amenta. Therefore the least in the kingdom of Horus, which is a spiritual kingdom , is greater than the highe st in the kingdom of Anup or John the Baptist, who was onl y the precursor an d proclaimer of the Christ or the Horus of the resurrection. A glimpse of the cyclical and non - hum an nature of the witness, John, may be inadve rtently given in the words attribut ed to Jesus, “If I will that he tarry till I com e,"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"what (is that) to thee?” “ Yet, Jesus said not unt o him that he shoul d not die.” The endi ng here 856 predicated was not in the categor y of hum an phe nomena, and may therefore be claimed as pertaining to the astronom ical mythos , which was at the root of all the mysteries of Amenta. Once a mont h the lord of light , as Horus, was rebor n in the moon, and Aan= John was his attenda nt. “Let him stand unc hange d for a mont h” is equi valent to his tarrying unt il Horus came again. It is said of John, “this is the disciple which beareth witness o f these things , and wrote these things .” Aan, in Egypt ian, is the scribe by name, and he was the divine scribe as Taht - Aan, the luna r deity and registrar of time. Aan was the witness to Horus; his writings are the Ritual, and “we know that his witness is t rue.” It was Taht - Aan= John who had pow er to conf er the Ma - Kheru on the solar god himself, that is, the gift of making truth by means of the word, because he told time for the sun and was his true witness in the moon. “Let him stand unc hange d for a mont h,” may be read by the legend which tells us that Ra created Taht - Aan to be his lamp by night and his witness in heaven, and whether we reckon night ly or mont hly, Taht - Aan= John was the witness unt il Horus came again at the end of the period. Anup the baptizer and Aan the saluter are the first two witnesses for the risen Horus as his helpers in establishing the kingdom for the father in heaven. Next there is a group of four, as follow ers of Horus and founde rs of his fold (Rit., ch. 97) . These four were bor n brot hers with Har - Ur, the elder Horus, in the com pany of the seven pow ers that were from the beginni ng in relation to certain phe nom ena of external nature. They are now called upon to becom e founda tiona l pillars of suppor t to the new heaven in the eschatology. In this pha se the group com mences as four and terminates as twelve, who reap the harvest in the fields of Amenta, for Horus - Khut i, the master of joy and lord of the spirits, who are called the glorified elect, the heirs to the kingdom of heaven, which, as Osirian always was but which as Christian is always com ing. The change from Horus the mortal to Horus divinized in spirit, as the son of Ra, is indi cated as occurring at the time when the four brethren became the four children of Horus, and, as it is sai d, when his name became that of Horus upon his colum n (Rit., ch. 112, Renouf ). Now Horus on his colum n, pedestal, or mono lith is equi valent to the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus with the disciples on the mount. In this pos ition the four brethren are his four arms of suppor t, the same as the four brothers with Jesus in the moun t. In their several characters they are the servants of Horus, whether as four suppor ts, four fishers, four shephe rds, or other forms of the primordial four who are characterized as the foremost of the final twelve. The issuing forth from Amenta on the day of the resurrection is described in the ope ning chapter of the Ritual as the com ing to the divine pow ers attached to Osiris. These divine pow ers are Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef and Kabhsenuf , the fo ur children of Horus who stand upon the papyr us - sym bol of the earth amidst the waters of the Nun, otherwise rende red on the mount or on the monol ith. The pyramid text of Teta (270) refers to this raising of the dead. It is said that Horus hath given his ch ildren pow er that they may raise"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"thee up. These children are the four who were foremost of the seven (or later, twelve) great spirits in Annu . This did not mean that four 857 hum an follow ers of Horus on earth had the pow er to raise the dead on earth. But so misrende red has the teaching been in the Gospels when Jesus bids his disciples to go forth on earth and raise the dead (Matt. X. 8). In the chapter of the baptism (Rit., ch. 97) the speaker “propi tiates” “thos e four glorified one s who follow after the master of all things .” They are the four suppor ters on whom Horus relies in foundi ng the kingdom for his father. Speaking, as it may be, of his sheep - fold in the character of the good shephe rd, Horus says, “Now let my fold be fitted for me, as one victorio us against all adve rsaries who woul d not that right shoul d be done to me — I (who) am the onl y one , just and true,” or faithful and true (Rit., ch. 97) . These four , then, are founde rs of the fold that is to be fitted for the good shephe rd with the crook upon his shoul der as Amsu - Horus in the resurrection scenes. They are the four brethren who, in the later pha se, are called his children. Hence Horus is described as com ing to light in his ow n children and in his name of Horus (Rit. ch. 112 ) on his colum n= on th e mount. To found the fold was to establish the kingdom . That was founde d on the four suppor ters at the four corners of the mount . There is a rebirth of Horus at his second com ing. It is the same with his train of com panion - pow ers, the four of the seven w ho had been with him as his brothers in the astronom ical mythos . These in the rebirth becom e his four children, who, at the same time, are designa ted by him “brothers of this my own body” (Rit., ch. 112 ). Whether called the brothers or the children of Horu s they are the same in bot h characters. The four as brothers are the fishers, Peter, Andrew, James and John. The other four , called James, Joseph, Simon and Juda s, are represented as brothers of his ow n flesh and blood. At their birth Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef and Kabhs enuf were the brothers of Horus Anaref. These had no father. In the rebirth Horus has himself attained the status of a father or begetter in spirit. Hence it is said, “As for Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef and Kabhs enuf , Horus is their father and Isis is their mother,” in this new setting of the four . In the Gospel Cleopa s and Mary take the place of Horus and Isis as the actual father and mother in the flesh. When Horus rises in Amenta he is the active and pow erful one of Annu filled with might divine as t he son whom the father hath begot ten (Rit., ch. 115) , whereas in his previous adve nt he was the child of the Virgin Mother as the puny impube scent impot ent weakling who was bor n but not begot ten. Horus now beseeches Ra to grant that he may have his four br others or his children for his assistants. He says, “Give me my brother in the region of Pa; give me my brother in Nekhe n — my brother for my tende r affection, ” or give me my brothers to love . Only two brethren of the four are mentione d here, and for these H orus asks of his father that his brothers may sit with him in his kingdom as eternal judge s, as benefactors of the world, as extingui shers of the Typhoni an plague s and as the bringe rs of peace (Rit., ch. 112 ). The prayer of Horus is followed by the Osiris deceased, who identifies the two brethren as Amsta and Hapi, and he exclaims: “Rise up, gods , who are in the low er heaven, rise up for the Osiris, make him (also) to 858 "},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"becom e a great god. ” The deceased cont inue s: “I know the mystery of Nekhe n.” The mys tery is that which the mother of Horus (who was also the mother of the two brethren) had done for him when she said “let him live” (ch. 113) , in which we have the mother making her reque st on behalf of her son. This new founda tion for the kingdo m of heave n was made on the night of erecting the flagstaffs (or pillars) of Horus, and of establishing him as heir to his father’s prope rty. The pillars were erected when Horus said to the four who follow ed him, “Let the flagstaffs be erected there,” on the night o f one of the ten great mysteries of Amenta (Rit., ch. 18) . The two brothers first given to Horus in Pa were Amsta and Hapi (ch. 112) . The other two that were given to Horus in Nekhe n are Tuamutef and Kabhs enuf , the ador er of the mother and the refresher of his brethren. Thus , the kingdom announc ed by Anup the baptizer, and founde d by Horus for his father, was established upon the four suppor ts. These in one shape were four brothers, onl y one of whom , Amsta, wears the hum an form. They are adopt ed by him as h is Shus , his servants or fishers, two by two — two in Pa and two in Nekhe n, the region where Sebek was the great fisher in the marshes. The four are given by Ra to Horus as his children who are brothers of his ow n body, to be with him in toke n of everlasting renewal and of peace on earth, and these are the four pillars, flagstaffs, fishermen, or suppor ts, on which the kingdom of heaven was to be founde d in Amenta, as a spirit - world by Horus, who was the fulfiller for the father at his second com ing. We repea t that Horus had four brothers with him in the mythos who had been with him from the beginni ng, just as Jesus has his four brothers on earth; and when Horus makes his change and rises in Amenta from the dead the four brothers becom e his children as the fou r suppor ts of the future kingdom (Rit., ch. 112) , the “four glorified one s” who are foremost among the seven great spirits of Annu (Rit., ch. 97). They who were the brothers of Horus when he was the son of Seb, or, as we say, on the earth, are, after his r esurrection, called his children. Coincident with this change the risen Lord, in the Gospels, addr esses his disciples as his children when he has risen from the tom b. He com es to the seven fishers in the boa t, and says to them, “Children, have ye aught to eat?” (John XXI. 5). This being after the resurrection. It is the onl y time that the disciples are addr essed as the children of Jesus, and the conditions are identical with thos e in the Ritual where the brethren of Horus in the earth - life becom e his childr en in the spirit - life beyond the tom b. Thus , to recapitulate, Horus of the resurrection at his second com ing was accom panied by Anup, the baptizer, Aan, the divine scribe, as luna r god, and the four brethren Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef and Kabhs enuf , one of whic h four was Amsta, the onl y brother in the hum an form. These four are the divine pow ers who were with Horus in the mount when he rose from the dead and came forth to day. They can be paralleled thus with characters in the canoni cal Gospels as: Horus, or the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus=Jesus; Anup, the baptizer=John the Baptist; John, the divine scribe=Aan, the divine scribe; Amsta, the one hum an brother of the Lord= James, the one hum an brother of Jesus; Hapi=Andr ew; Tuamutef=John; Kabhs enuf =Peter. 859 Simon Peter is the one who perceives and proclaims that Jesus is the Christ. “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God” (Matt. XVI. 16). The name of Peter is here identified"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"with the Greek Petra for a rock. But if the other characters, Jesus=Horus; John= Aan; Ja mes=Amsta, are Egypt ian, it follow s that Peter is Egypt ian also. The word Petra or Petar is Egyp tian; it signi fies to see, look at, to perceive, to show forth, to reveal. Moreover, Petar is the nam e or title of an Egyptian god who had been already divinize d as the one who discovered and made know n the only begot ten son of that living god, who was Atum - Ankhu, the father of Iusa, the Egypt ian Jesus (Budge , Vocabul ary, p. 122) . Proba bly the deified perceiver, or Petar, was the hawk - sight ed Kabhs enuf , the refre sher of his brethren, one of the four children of Horus, who had previous ly been his brothers from the beginni ng in the astronom ical mythol ogy. Horus in one character is the Fisher. “Know ye what I know ,” saith the manes, “the name of him who fishes there , the great prince who sits at the east of the sky? ” (Naville, Rit., 153 B ). “I know the name of the table on which he lays them (the fishes); it is the table of The Four as Fishers for Horus. Horus.” In this character the Osiris saith, “I shine like Ho rus. I gove rn the land, and I go dow n to the land in the two great boat s. I hav e come as a fisher” (Naville, ch. 153 A ). Horus or Jesus in the Rom an catacom bs also com es as the fisher who at the same time is por trayed as the bringe r of the grapes for the Ua ka festival (Lundy , Monum ental Christiani ty, fig. 54) . The four as fishers for Horus are depicted as the fishers in the Ritual. They are spoke n of as having been amongs t the earlier elemental pow ers called “the ancestors of Ra.” Otherwise stated, they are four of the seven soul s of Ra. In fact, they are Hapi, Tuamutef, Kabhs enuf and Amsta, now to be identified as the four children who became the four fishers for Horus, and who are one with the four fishers for Jesus in the canoni cal Gospels. A vigne tte to t he Book of the Dead (ch. 153 A , pl. 55, Naville and Renouf ) show s the four fishers as four men pulling the drag - net through the water in the act of fishing for Horus. These are they who are described as fishers for the great prince who sits at the east of t he sky (ch. 153 B ), and who is said to mark them as his ow n prope rty. Horus was the prototypa l fish, the same type of sacrifice that is still eaten in the penitential meal to - day as it was in On when Sebek - Horus was the Saviour as the fish that brought the food and water of 860 the inunda tion. Horus as the fish preceded Horus as the fisher when Sebek, the crocodi le - headed god, was the typi cal great fisher. It is said of the first two fishers, “These are the"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"two hands of Horus according to the mystery of N ekhe n (Rit., ch. 113) . The follow ers of Horus as fishers (ch. 153 A ) are called “the fishermen who are fishing. ” Thus the total group who were the twelve as reapers in the harvest - field of Amenta are also the twelve as the fishers. Hence the twelve fisherme n of the later legend. The two first fishes caught for Horus are then eaten at the sacramental meal. As it is said (Rit., ch. 153 A ), the fishes are laid on the table of Horus. They had been brought to him when the festival was founde d by Ra; “they were bro ught to Horus and displayed before his face at the feast of the 15t h day of the mont h, when the fishes were produc ed” (Rit., ch. 113) . In the Ritual (ch. 97) there is a scene of the Seven Fishers at the boa t with Horus, which can be paralleled in the Gosp el of John. The scene in John’ s Gospel is pos t - resurrectiona l, therefore not in the earth of time. As it is said, “This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples after that he was risen from the dead” (John XXI. 14). And that which f ollow s the resurrection is in spirit - world. Therefore Jesus and the seven disciples in this scene are spirits like the seven with Horus, which were the seven great spirits of Annu , four of whom became the first fishers for Horus (Rit., chs. 97 and 153 A ). t his view is corrobor ated by the appe arance of Peter, “for he was nak ed,” and a naked man in Sign - langua ge means a spirit. Thus the seven with Jesus at the boa t are a form of the seven great spirits with Horus at the bark in Annu , four of whom – the foremost four – becom e the founde rs of the fold for the Good Shephe rd, in the same chapter of the Ritual but in anot her character. In this character Horus had shephe rded the flocks of Ra, his heavenly father, in the deserts of Amenta (Book of Hades). In this characte r of the shephe rd Horus of the resurrection rose up from the sepul chre with a crook instead of the later lamb or kid upon his shoulder. And it is in this character Horus choos es the first four of the seven great spirits of Annu to becom e the founde rs of hi s fold as well as his first four fishers. In the Gospel Jesus likewise assum es the character of the so - called good shephe rd. Hence the injunc tions to Peter, and the sayings , “Feed my lambs,” “Tend my sheep,” “Feed my sheep” (John XXI. 16 - 18) . According to Matthew, the four brethren first chos en by Jesus are Simon, Andr ew, James and John. It is not eworthy, how ever, that in the Joha nni ne account the first four follow ers of Jesus are Andr ew and Peter, Phillip and Nathaniel. Moreove r, Nathaniel was one of thos e who were unde r the fig - tree aforetime with Jesus. There is no Zebedee, father of the fishers, and there is no fishing in the ope ning chapter of John; that is, as suppos ed in the life on earth. The fishers onl y appe ar in this Gospel after the resurrection of Jesus, which takes us, as doe s the baptism, into the spirit - world of the mythos , where the seven fishers answer to the other group of the seven in the boa t with Horus. The mysteries of Amenta show us Anup calling the world to judgm ent in the character of the judge . He is the precursor of 861 Horus in the wilderness, and the announc er of the kingdom that follow s at the second com ing. Unde r the title of Ap - Uat he is the ope ner or gui de of roads who “makes ready the way of the Lord,” and levels the path in the equi nox. In the Gospels the proclamation that the kingdom of heaven is at hand was first made by John the baptizer and precursor of Jesus. The cry of the com ing kingdom immediately at hand is then taken up by Jesus"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"after the baptism in which he has becom e the adul t of thirty years, and the co - type of Horus the anoi nted son of God the second bor n who was Horus in the spirit. Also in the Gospel of Nicode mus, John the Baptist is the teacher in the earth of eternity. The baptism and transformation of Je sus into the spirit sym bol led by the dove was in the earth of eternity. The descent of the hol y spirit, as God the father, in authentication of the anoi nted son was enacted in the earth of eternity, not in the world of time. According to the genui ne mythos or gnos is which is Egyp tian, and we have no other criterion, the doubl e adve nt of Horus depende d on his birth and rebirth, in the two earths; the birth of a hum an soul in matter and the rebirth of an immortal soul in Amenta. The second com ing of Horus is the mystery of that second birth in which the hum an soul is divinized from its two halves as an endur ing spirit or eternal entity. This transformation follow s death and bur ial, and therefore can onl y take place in spirit - world. When it doe s take place the second adve nt is accom plished as represented bot h in the Ritual and the Egypt o - gnos tic writings . But it is otherwise in the canoni cal Gospels, because in making out a history solely hum an the conc octers were limited to the human life in the earth of time. For example, in the Gospel according to John, when Jesus is about to leave the disciples and is telling them of the second adve nt, he says, “I have yet many things to say unt o you, but ye cannot bear them now ” (ch. XVI. 12) . These things that are to com e, in som e inde finite future (which has not com e yet), relate to the nature of God the father. They cons titute the mysteries which are to be unfolded in the future at the second com ing of the son in the person of the judge , the avenge r, the harvester, the spi rit - of - truth, the com forter, the fulfiller who fulfils bot h in the Ritual and in the gnos tic Gospel. Jesus had hitherto taught in parables. Now he says the hour com eth when he will tell them “plainly of the father” and speak to them no more in parables (XV I. 25). This is at the second com ing which had been already fulfilled in the Gospel of “Pistis Sophi a” and in the Ritual of the Resurrection. The Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus who, as the “little Iao” of “Pistis Sophi a,” onl y spoke in parables, and was not empowere d to expound the profounde r mysteries of the fatherhood, is a form of the child - Horus whom Plutarch called the “inarticulate discour se.” At his second com ing he unf olded the spiritual mysteries. The chief of these was the mystery of mysteries, namely, the mystery of “the father in the likeness of a dove ” (B. 1, 1). Nevertheless, the second adve nt, and the mysteries pertaining thereto (according to the genui ne gnos is), do leak out in the canoni cal Gospels, how ever carefully disgui sed or surreptitious ly inser ted. The gnos tic manifestation of the first mystery, namely, that of the father as a dove , is made to the Gospel - Jesus at the time of his baptism, in the life on earth. The second 862 com ing is also illustrated in the scene of transfigur ation on the moun t. Likewise in the resurrection when the risen Christ has transformed into a spirit, Luke not withstandi ng, with pow er to impart the hol y spirit and share it with his follow ers (John XX. 22) . Each of these manifestations , with others belongi ng to the second adve nt of Horus in Amenta, are assigne d to Jesus in the hum an life in fulfilment of the history. In the Ritual the father, as the hol y spirit, calls from heaven to Horus (or Osiris) the anoi nted son, “Com e thou to me.” This is Ra the bird - headed, whos e li keness is then assum ed by Horus the belove d son. In the Gospel, the Father, as the holy spirit, descende d on Jesus in the form"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"of a dove , and in that guise “abode upon him.” The exigency of a hum an history with onl y a singl e adve nt did not permit of the de ath and resurrection of Jesus occurring at the time when the yout h of twelve years made his change into the adul t of thirty years. Yet the baptism and ascension of Jesus from the water into the ope ning heavens are identical with the Egypt o - gnos tic resurrec tion. The Horus or Jesus of twelve years is the mortal on this side of death. The Horus or Jesus of thirty years is a spirit on the other side, in spirit - world. The baptism of Jesus represents the resurrection of Horus from the water. Hence Jesus in his ba ptism becom es a spirit. He is led up from the water “of the spirit,” “in the spirit,” or as a spirit into which he had made his transformation. When Sut put out the eye of Horus, the darkne ss represented death. But, in the Gospel, death, or the transformat ion, is onl y represented at this poi nt by the baptism. If it had been actualized the history must have ende d there and then, which was not in accordance with the Gospel schema. Still, the “history” notwithstandi ng, Jesus doe s becom e a spirit in this scene of transformation which belongs to the mysteries of Amenta. Bird - headed beings are spirits, not historical Jews. Only as a spirit coul d the foster - child of Seb, or Joseph, transform into the son of Ra the holy spirit; and onl y in the earth of eternity coul d the change occur in which the Virgin’s child became the father’s son by being born again of Nut the heavenly mother, one of whos e names was Meri. According to the gnos is, the follow ing are a few of the events that occur after the resurrection : the transf ormation of Jesus, the Virgin’s child, into the belove d son of the father with the spirit of God descendi ng on him as a dove ; the cont ests with Satan in the spirit; the adopt ion of the four disciples in the mount ; Jesus with the seven on boa rd the bark; th e foundi ng of the fold; the miracles of healing; giving sight to the blind; raising the dead; casting out the devils; causing evil spirits to enter the swine; walking upon the water; foundi ng the kingdom of heaven on the four fishers, or disciples, and con ferring the holy spirit, after death, upon the twelve. The Gospel doc trine of the Holy Spirit is true enou gh, according to the Egypt ian wisdom , when prope rly appl ied, but onl y as Egyp tian is it to be unde rstood. Certain manifestations of the hol y spirit i n the Gospels are strictly in keeping with the mysteries of the Ritual or Book of the Dead. In the words of John “the hol y spirit was not given” at the time when Jesus “was not yet glorified” (ch. VII. 39) . The glorifying was by descent of the hol y spirit; the spirit that was given to Horus and by him to the disciples in the mystery 863 of Tattu upon the resurrection - day when the God in heaven called to the mum my - Osiris in Amenta “Com e thou to me,” when the two halves of the soul were blende d in the etern al one ness, and hum an Horus, the soul in matter, was transformed to rise again as Horus divinized. This was in the resurrection after death, in baptismal regeneration, or in the Christifying of the Osiris - mum my. The Ritual show s us how the apos tles were e stablished on the same founda tion, beginni ng with the two brothers, who were follow ed by the four brethren, the cycle being com pleted by the twelve in the fields of divine harvest. The four as brothers of Horus had been figur es in the astronom y. The four a s his children are figur es in the eschatology; the four who are “foremost among the spirits of Annu ” with the aid of whom “the fold” was cons tructed for him, as for one victorious against all “adve rsaries” (Rit., ch. 97) . The two"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"four s are thus equa ted in the Gospels. The four brothers of Horus=the four brothers of Jesus. Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef, Kabhs enuf =James, Joseph, Simon, Juda s. The same four in the character of his children with Horus=the four brethren, Simon, Andr ews, James and John, whom Jesus addr es ses as his children (John XXXI. 5). At a later stage the follow ers in the train of Horus are the twelve who are his harvesters in the cornfields of Amenta. “Pistis Sophi a” in agreement with the “Book of Hades” show s us how the twelve as follow ers of Horus were cons tituted a company that cons isted at first of seven to which the five were adde d in forming the group of twelve. The disciples of Jesus likewise becom e the twelve who reap the harvest. “Then saith he unt o his disciples, the harvest truly is plenteo us but the labou rers are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he send forth labour ers into his harvest. And he called unt o him his twelve disciples” – who were previous ly but four (Matt. IV. 18, 21) – “and gave them author ity ove r unc lean spirit s, to cast them out, and to heal all manne r of disease and all manne r of sickne ss.” At this poi nt the names of the twelve are for the first time given (Matt. X. 1 - 5). The same words are uttered in Luke conc erning the harvest and its reapers, but now the nu mber of disciples appoi nted and sent forth for the inga thering of harvest - hom e is seventy or seventy - and - two — one for each subdi vision of the decans in the twelve signs , bot h the seventy and seventy - two being identifiable astronom ical num bers. The twelve w ith Horus in Amenta are they who labour at the harvest and collect the corn (otherwise the soul s) for Horus. When the harvest is ready “the bearers of sickles reap the grain in their fields. Ra says to them, on earth as bearers of sickles in the fields of Amenta,” “Take your sickles, reap your grain” (“Book of Hades,” Records, vol . 10, 119) . Here the labour ers who reap the harvest in Amenta are the obj ect of propi tiatory offerings and of ador ation on the earth, as the twelve disciples of Horus, son of Ra, t he heavenly father. And this was ages before the story was told of the twelve fictitious harvesters in Galilee. Moreove r, the Harvest is identical with the Last Judgm ent. Atum - Ra says at the same time, “Guard the enemies, pun ish the wicked. Let them not es cape from you r hands . Watch ove r the executions , according to the orders you have received from the Founde r, who has marked you out to strike” — as executione rs. So is it in the Gospels, where the harvest is one 864 with the judgm ent at the end of the worl d, or cons ummation of the age. As before said, when the narratives in the canoni cal scriptures had taken the place of the primitive drama, certain mysteries of Amenta were made por table in parables, and thenceforth the Gospels repeat the same things in pa rables and logoi that were represented dramatically in the mysteries. The harvest - hom e and judgm ent - day, described in the Gospels, which are to occur at some inde finite time in the future on this earth, belong to the Osirian mysteries of Amenta. The great judg ment at the last day suppl ies an illustration of the mystery extant in parable. A first and second death occur, likewise a first and second resurrection in the mysteries of Amenta. The first is the death which takes place on earth, and the appa rition o f the manes in the nether - world cons titutes the first resurrection from the dead. Then follow s the great judgm ent of the right eous and the wicked. Thos e found gui lty are doom ed to suffer the second death. There is for them no other resurrection. Thos e who escape from the dread tribuna l"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"unc onde mned pass on to the second resurrection as the spirits of the just made perfect, called the glorified. These are the inhe ritors of eternal life. Jesus says, “This is the will of my Father, that every one that behol deth the Son, and believeth on him, shoul d have eternal life, that I shoul d raise him up at the last day,” “and I will raise him up at the last day” (John VI. 40, 44) . The pitiful pretence of an historical Jew being the raiser up of the dead at the last day is a miserable mockery of the actual transaction in the mysteries of Amenta with Horus as the resurrection and the life. In these, the deceased is show n as Ani in the hall of judgm ent. He has emerged from the earth - life and risen in Amenta, but not yet from it. He must be judge d in the Maat or great hall before he rises from the dead as one of the just made perfect for the life to com e. If he passes, sound of heart and pur e in spirit, he will enter the presence of the great god . Ani succeeds and passes pur e. His resurrection from the dead and from Amenta, the world of the dead, is assured. Horus the Son of God, the Intercessor, the paraclete, now takes him by the hand as the raiser of the dead to life and introduc er of the risen Ani to his father. In one scene the hair of Ani is black. The next show s him kne eling in presence of Osiris with his hair turned white. He has passed in pur ity. He has been raised by Horus at the “last day” or at the end of the cycle when the dead were judge d, onc e every year or other p eriod at the great gathering of “all soul s.” This took place “in presence of the gods ,” as one of the ten great mysteries described in the Ritual (ch. 18) when “the glorious one s were right ly judge d, and joy went its round in Thinis”; when judgm ent was pas sed upon thos e who were to be anni hilated “on the highw ay of the damned”; when “the evil dead were cast out ,” and the goa ts divided from the sheep. As it is said — “when the associates of Sut arrive, and take the form of goa ts, they are slain in presence of the gods so long as their blood runne th dow n, and this is done according to the judgm ent of thos e gods who are in Tattu,” the place of establishing the soul for ever, from its two halves, as the doubl e Horus, the divine avenge r of the suffering Osiris, who at his second com ing was the revealer of 865 eternal justice. This culminating event, which was the subj ect of so much Old Testament prophe cy that is reproduc ed in the New, is here fulfilled, according to the know ledge of the wise men “which kne w the ti mes” and who also “kne w the law and the judgm ent” (Esther I. 13). The adve nt might be on the millenni al scale of Horus in the hous e of a thous and years according to the cycle, but there was a Com ing onc e a year and an endi ng of the cycle, the age, or the w orld as it was called by the Christians every year. And it is on this one - year period derived from the solar mythos that the second adve nt and the immediate endi ng of the world were ignor antly based. The end of the world or the cycle of the annua l sun came onc e a year in the Egypt ian mythos . The second adve nt of Horus, like the first, was also annua l. He came in the terror of his glory as avenge r of his father; as the great judge , as lord of the harvest with the glorious one s for reapers who were the typi ca l twelve in num ber, and as the fulfiller of the heavenly kingdom in which he reigne d according to the mythos for one year, whether as Horus the shoot , the fish, the fisherman, or the harvester. The gnos tic Christ was likewise know n to be the ruler for one year. At the festival of Ha - ka - er - a, or “Com e thou to me,” the blessed one s were welcom ed by Horus to the kingdom which had been prepared from the founda tion of the"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"world, or the earlier cycle of time, in the Kamite astro - mythol ogy , if anyw here on earth, but which preparation and found ing were repeated every year as a mode of the mysteries in Amenta. These mysteries were extant, and periodically performed som e thous ands of years ago. So ancient is som e of the imagery in the Maat, that when Ani passes pur e, the crow n of glory placed upon his head to be worn in heaven is a form of the top - knot , which is still assum ed at pube rty by the Kaffirs and other African black races. But this great judgm ent, in com mon with the other events that were fulfilled at the sec ond adve nt, still remains the subj ect of prophe cy in the Hebrew and Christian scriptures. In the Gospel according to Matthew the last judgm ent is to take place at the veritable endi ng of the world (Matt. XXV. 31 - 46). “When the Son of Man shall com e in his glory, and all the ange ls with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory, and before him shall be gathered all the nations , and he shall separate them, as the shephe rd parteth the sheep from the goa ts; and he shall set the sheep on the right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unt o them on his right hand, Com e ye blessed of my Father, inhe rit the kingdom prepared for you from the founda tion of the world: for I was an hunge red, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me d rink: I was a strange r and ye took me in: naked and ye clothed me, sick and ye visited me. Then shall he say unt o them on the left hand, Depart from me ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his ange ls.” In the original, the d evil and his ange ls are Sut and his Sami, and the goa ts on the left hand are also the representatives of Sut. Nevertheless, the two judgm ents of the Ritual and in the gos pel are funda mentally the same; there was but one origin and one meaning for bot h. The great judgm ent in the hall of right eous ness which remained the subj ect of Hebrew prophe cy gone dateless was an annua l occurrence in the 866 Kamite mysteries. In this the Osiris pleads: “I have done that which man prescribeth and that which pleaseth the gods . I have propi tiated the god with that which he love th. I have given bread to the hungr y, water to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, a boa t to the shipw recked. I have made obl ations to the gods and fune ral offerings to the departed: deliver me therefo re; protect me therefore: and report not against me in presence of the great God. I am one whos e mout h is pur e, and whose hands are pur e, to whom it is said by thos e who look upon him, Com e, com e in peace” (Ritual, ch. 125 , Renouf ). The great judg ment was periodi c in Amenta at the end of a cycle, which might be a year, a generation, or, as it was also exot erically figur ed, at the end of the world. The uni nitiated, who had but an out side view, mistook it for the actual and immediate endi ng of the world. “Th e harvest is the end of the world” (Matt. XIII. 39) . “The end of all things is at hand” (1 Peter IV. 7). “It is the last hou r” (1 John II. 18). “The kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Matt. III. 2; IV. 17; X. 7). This was according to the literalization of the Illiterate. Paul is the onl y writer or speaker in the New Testament who kne w better. He warns his follow ers amongs t the Thessaloni ans against believing this teaching of the uni nitiated. He says: “We beseech you, brethren, touc hing the com ing of our Lord J esus Christ, and our gathering toge ther unto him; to the end that ye be not qui ckly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubl ed, either by spirit or by word, or by Epistle as from us ( i.e., by a forged ‘Epistle of Paul’), as that the day of the Lord is (now ) present: let no man begui le you in any wise” (2 Thess. II. 1, 3). He was the onl y one who kne w the esoteric"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"nature of this end of the æon, and the com ing of Christ or Horus, the anoi nted, the Messiah in Israel, or the Jesus who was Iu the Su of Atum , who m he calls the second Adam=Atum , and who had been to him the pre - Christian Christ, the spiritual rock, from which the peopl e drank the water of life whilst in the wilderness. When Tertullian denounc ed Paul as “The Apos tle of the Heretics” he meant the Egyp to - gnos tics. Paul was epopt and perfect amongs t thos e who kne w that the historic version was a lying delusion. This we hol d to have been aimed at in his “Second Epistle to the Thessaloni ans,” when he says of his oppone nts, the fleshifiers of the Christ, “f or this cause God sende th them a working of error, that they shoul d believe a lie.” The moul d of the mythos being solar, onc e every year the heir of Ra assum ed his sove reignt y as Horus of the kingl y count enance, whos e rule was for one year. Every year Osi ris, the great green one in vegetation, died to rise again in the fruits of the earth. Every year in the solar drama he was bur ied in Amenta to make the road that united the two earths in one , for establishing the com ing kingdom on earth as it was in heave n. Every year the prophe cy was fulfilled in natural phe nom ena, and every year the com ing kingdom came. Every year was celebrated this founda tion of the world that was laid and relaid by the bur ied body of the god; this uni on of the doubl e earth in Tanen, a t the equi nox, this resurrection of the soul that suppl ied the bread of life, this com pletion of the cycle by the sun that rose and travelled on the eternal round as representative of the author of eternity. A glimpse of this annua l com ing is permitted whe n the Christ is made to say, “Ye shall not have gone through the cities of 867 Israel till the son of man be com e” (Matt. X. 23). “There be som e of them that stand here which shall in no wise taste of death till they see the son of man com ing in his king dom ” (Matt. XVI. 28) . Such prophe cy is in accordance with the true mythos , but for ever fatal to the falsely - founde d history. T HE L AST S UPPER : THE C RUCIFIXION AND THE R ESURRECTION . As the legend is related by Plutarch, the death of Osiris was preceded by his betrayal, and the betrayal, which was the work of his twin brother, Sut, took place in the banque ting - room . Sut, having framed a curious ark just the size of Osiris’s body, brought it to a certain banque t. As this was on the last night of Osiris’s l ife or reign, and on the last night of the year, the meal may fairly be called the Last Suppe r ( Of Isis and Osiris, 13) . Now this mystery of the Last Suppe r can be traced in the Ritual as the first of a series acted in Amenta. Sut and his associates had re newed the assault upon Osiris on the night of laying the evening provisions upon the altar, called the night of the battle in which the pow ers of drought and darkne ss were defeated and extingui shed. The coffin of Osiris is the earth of Amenta. Dawn upon th e coffin was the resurrection; and this prove nde r is imaged as “the dawn upon the coffin of Osiris,” which show s that the evening meal, or eucharist, was eaten in celebration of the resurrection and the transubs tantiation of the body into spirit. The night of laying provi sions on the altar is mentione d twice: onc e"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"when Osiris is in the coffin, provided by Sut and his associates, the Sebau, who entrappe d him in the ark. The second mention follow s the erection of the Tat - sign which denot ed the resurrection; h ence the “dawn upon the coffin of Osiris,” which is equi valent to the resurrection morn. The resurrection on the third day originated in luna r phe nom ena. Twenty - eight days was the lengt h of a moon , and this is no doubt the sour ce of the statement that Osir is was in his eight - and - twentieth year at the time of his betrayal. The moon is invi sible dur ing two night s, which com pleted the luni - solar mont h of thirty days. The assault upon Osiris the Good Being made by Sut was periodi cally renewed. This has just oc curred when the first of the ten mysteries is enacted (Rit., ch. 18). The scene is in the hous e of Annu (Heliopol is), where Osiris lay bur ied and Horus was rebor n. The trium ph of Osiris ove r his adve rsaries is in the resurrection follow ing the dramatized d eath of the invi olate god. This is called the night of the battle, when there befell the defeat of the Sebau and the extinction of the adve rsaries of Osiris. It is also described as “the night of provi sioni ng the altar,” otherwise stated “the night of the Last Suppe r,” when “the calf of the sacrificial herd” was eaten at “the mortuary meal,” which represented the body and blood of Osiris, “the bul l of eternity” (Rit., ch. 1). The second mystery of the ten is solemnized upon the night when the Tat - pillar wa s set up in Tattu, or when Osiris in his resurrection 868 was raised up again as a type of the eternal. The third mystery is on the night of the things that were laid upon the altar in Sekhe m which imaged the altar and the offering in one . This was the c ircle of Horus in the dark, the sufferer made blind by Sut, the victim in the Tat who was the prototype of Jesus on the cross, and representative of the god in matter. As we have seen, a great Memphi an festival, answering to the Christmas - tide of later ti mes, was periodically solemnized at the temple of Medinet Habu in the last decade of the mont h Choi ak (from December 20t h to 30t h), which lasted for ten days. One day, the 26t h of the month= December 24t h, was kept as the feast of Sekari, the god who rose a gain from the mum my, and this was the principal feast - day of the ten. In all likelihood the whol e ten mysteries were performed dur ing the ten days of the festival that was celebrated at Memphi s (Erman, Life in Ancient Egypt, Eng. tr., pp. 277 - 9). Prom inent among these was the feast of the erection or re - erection of the Tat - pillar of stability, which was an image of Ptah - Sekari, the coffined one who rose again, and who in the later religion becom es Osiris - Sekari, “Lord of resurrections , whos e birth is from t he hous e of death.” The resurrection of Osiris, which, like other doc trines, was based on the realities of nature, woul d be appr opr iately celebrated in the winter solstice. At that time the pow ers of darkne ss, drough t, decay and death, now persona lized in Sut, were dom inant, as was show n in the lessening water and the waning light of the enfeebled sun. The tat - type of stability was tempor arily ove rthrow n, by the adve rsary of Osiris and his co - cons pirators, the Sebau. Here begins the great drama of the Osiri an mysteries, in ten acts, which is out lined in the Ritual. The put ting of Osiris to death – so far as a god coul d suffer – was follow ed by the fune ral, and the bur ial by the resurrection. The ope ning chapters of the Ritual, called the Com ing forth to day, are said to cont ain “the words which bring about the resurrection and the glory,” also the words to be recited on the day of bur ial that conf er the pow er of com ing forth from the death on earth, and of entering"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"into the new life of the manes in Amenta. Horus is described as cove ring Tesh - Tesh (a title of the mutilated Osiris); as ope ning the life - fount ains of the god whos e heart is motionl ess, and as closing the entrance to the hidden things in Rusta (ch. 1, 18 - 20). The two divine sisters are present as mourne rs ove r their brother in the tom b. They are called the mour ners who weep for Osiris in Rekhe t (line 15, 16) . The mysteries thus com mence with the bur ial of Osiris in Amenta — as a mum my. The mummy - making that was first appl ied to preserving the bone s and bod y of the human being had been afterwards appl ied to the god or sun of life in matter, imaged as the typical mum my of Osiris that was bur ied to await the resurrection in and afterwards from Amenta. In bot h pha ses it is Osiris, as the god in matter, who is r epresented in the nether - earth. And the rearising of the hum an soul and its blendi ng with the eternal spirit were dramatically rende red in the mysteries as the resurrection of the Osiris or the soul of mortal Horus rearisen in Amenta as the son of Ra. In the Gospels, Juda s the brother of Jesus in one character, elsewhere called the familiar friend, is the betrayer on the night of the last 869 suppe r, and Juda s “the son of perdition” answers to Sut the twin - brother of Osiris (in the later Egypt ian mythos ) , who was his betrayer at the last suppe r called the messiu or evening meal that was eaten on the last night of the Old Year, or the reign of Osiris. The twelve disciples onl y are present at the last suppe r in the Gospels. In the betrayal of Osiris by Sut the num ber present in the banque ting - hall is seventy - two. These were officers who had been appoi nted by Osiris. The number show s they represent the seventy - two duo - decans as rulers in the planisphe re, but the twelve have been chos en to sit at suppe r with t he doom ed victim in the Gospels instead of the seventy - two who were also appoi nted by the Lord, and are dimly appa rent in their astronom ical gui se, as the seventy - two (or seventy) who are present in the scene where Jesus trium phs ove r Satan as he falls lik e lightning from his place in heaven (Luke X. 17). One of the most striking of the various episode s in the Gospel narrative is that scene at the Last Suppe r in which Jesus washes the feet of the disciples, com pared with “the washing” that is performed by the Great One in the Ritual. In the Gospel Juda s is waiting to betray his master. Jesus says to the betrayer, “That thou doe st, do quickly.” Now it shoul d be bor ne in mind that the Ritual, as it com es to us, cons ists to a large extent of allusions to the m atter that was made out more fully in performing the drama of the mysteries. Washing the feet was one of the mysteries pertaining to the fune ral of Osiris, when the feet of the disciples or follow ers of Horus were washed. It was one of the fune ral ceremoni es. As it is said in the Ritual (ch. 172) , “Thou washest thy feet in silver basins made by the skilful artificer Ptah - Sekari.” This was preparatory to the fune ral feast, as is show n by the cont ext (ch. 172) . In the Gospel (John XIII.) the fune ral feast bec om es the “Last Suppe r” when Jesus “riseth from suppe r and layeth aside his garments; and he took a tow el and girded himself. Then he pour eth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet.” And here is a passage of three lines, called the chapter by which the person is not devour ed by the serpent in Amenta. “O Shu, here is Tattu, and conv ersely, unde r the hair of Hathor . They scent Osiris. Here is the one who is to devour me. They wait apart. The serpent Seksek passeth ove r me. Here are wormwood b ruised and reeds. Osiris is he who prayeth that he may be bur ied. The eyes of the great one are"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"bent dow n, and he doe th for thee the work of washing, marking out what is conf ormabl e to law and balanc ing the issues” (Rit., ch. 35, Renouf ). This brief excerp t cont ains the situation and character of the great one , who with eyes bent dow n in his hum ility doe s “the work of washing, ” and expl ains why this ceremony has to be performed by him in person. The “washer” is he who is in presence of the one who waits to betray him, devou r him, or com pass his destruction, and he beseeches a speedy bur ial. Osiris in this scene is a form of the typi cal “low ly one ” who had been in type as such for ages previous ly. But the most arresting fact of all is hidde n in the words “O S hu, here is Tattu (the place of re - establishing) unde r the wig (or hair) of Hathor ,” the godde ss of dawn, one of whos e names is Meri. And it is here, beneath the hair of Hathor - Meri, they perfum e and anoi nt Osiris for his burial. This when written out as “ history” 870 cont ains the anoi nting and perfum ing of the feet of Jesus by Mary, who wiped them with her hair (Luke VII. 38). The two bathings of the feet are separate items in the Gospels, whereas bot h occur in this one shor t chapter of the Ritual in whi ch Osiris is anoi nted for his bur ial, and at the same time he doe s for others the work of washing and pur ifying, “marking out what is conf ormable to law and balancing the issues.” Osiris also is “he who prayeth that he may be bur ied,” and Jesus, “know ing that his hour has com e,” says to Juda s the betrayer, “That thou doe st, do qui ckly.” And later, “Friend, do that for which thou art com e” (Matt. XXVI. 50), which is the equi valent of Osiris praying that he may be buried. The wormwood bruised, or crushed, an d the reeds are utilized in the crucifixion for furnishing the bitter drink, which was offered to the victim with a sponge placed upon a reed. A reed was also put in his right hand. These things were por trayed in the drama of Amenta. They were acted in the mysteries and expl ained by the mystery - teachers. The Osiris passes through the same scenes and makes cont inua l allusion to the sufferings of Osiris (or Horus) his great forerunne r, and finally the drama was staged on earth and reproduc ed as history in the Gospels. That is the one final and sufficient expl anation of episode after episode belongi ng to the mysteries of Amenta reproduc ed according to the canon as veritable Gospel history. The scene in Gethsemane may be com pared with the scene in Pa, where Hor us suffered his agony and bloody sweat when wounde d by the black boa r Sut. Pa was an ancient name of Sesennu, a locality in the luna r mythos , which was also called Khemen, later Smen, a word signi fying num ber eight , appl ied to the enclosure of the eight ; a nd the suffering of the wounde d Horus in Am - Smen is, as now sugge sted, the Osirian original of Jesus bleeding in Gethsemane. Pa is not called “a garden,” but it is described as a “place of repos e” for Horus that was given to him by his father for his place of rest. Ra says, “I have given Pa to Horus as the place of his repos e. Let him prosper.” The story is told in “the chapter of know ing the pow ers of Pa” (Rit., ch. 112) . The que stion is asked, “Know ye why Pa hath been given to Horus?” The answer is, It w as Ra who gave it to him in amends of the blindne ss in his eye, in cons eque nce of what Ra said to Horus: “Let me kook at what is happe ning in thine eye to - day,” and he looke d at it. Ra said to Horus, “Pray, look at that black swine.” He looke d, and a griev ous mishap befell his eye. Horus said to Ra, “Lo, mine eye is as though Sut had made a wound in it.” And wrath devour ed his heart. Then Ra said to the gods , “Let him be laid upon his bed that he may recove r.”"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"“It was Sut who had taken the form of a black s wine, and he wrought the wound which was made in the eye of Horus. And Ra said to the gods , “The swine is an abom ination to Horus; may he get well.” And the swine became an abom ination to Horus. (Rit., ch. 112 , Renouf .) It was in Pa that Horus was keeping his watch for Ra by night when the grievous mishap befell his eye. He was watching by com mand of Ra, who had said to Horus, “Keep your eye on the black pig.” The eye was luna r, with which Horus kept the watch for Ra; and Sut in the form of the black boa r o f darkne ss pierced 871 the eye of Horus with his tusk, the moon being the eye of Horus as the watcher by night for Ra. Sut on whom he kept the watch transformed himself into a black boa r, and wounde d Horus in the eye whilst he was watching on behalf of R a as his noc turnal eye in the darkne ss. Jesus in the Gospels keeps the watch by night in Gethsemane, as is show n by the disciples failing to keep it. The watch by Horus was necessitated on account of Sut, who is the typical betrayer in the Kamite mythos, a s Juda s is in the Christian version. Sut kne w the place in the original rende ring and sought out Horus there when he caused the agony and bloody sweat by mutilating him. “Now Juda s also which betrayed him kne w the place” (to which Jesus “often restored” wi th his disciples) and there the betrayer seeks him out to betray him, not in the form of a black boa r that put out the eye which was the light of the world, but as a dark - hearted person befitting the suppos ed historical nature of the narrative. The scene o f the drow sy watchers in Gethsemane is appa rently derived from a scene in the mysteries. There is a reference in the Ritual (ch. 89) to “thos e undr ow sy watchers who keep watch in Annu. ” In the Gospels Jesus asks his follow ers to watch with him in the garde n, and on bot h occasions he found them sleeping. The moral is poi nted by the “undr ow sy watchers in Annu” being turned into the drow sy watchers who slept in Gethsemane, and who failed to keep the watch. “I know the pow ers in Pa,” says the speaker; “they are Horus, Amsta and Hapi.” That is, Horus and the “two brothers,” who correspond to the two brethren James and John, the sons of Zebedee, in the Gospels, and who are here the two with Jesus in the garden. The conve rsation betwixt Horus the son and Ra the fat her, the watching by night , and the bloody sweat are follow ed by the glorification of Horus. Ra gives back the eye, the sight of which was restored in the new moon. In the Gospel (John XVII.) this glorification of Horus as the son of the father – Horus, who had previous ly been the son of the mother, Har - si - Hesi onl y – is anticipated and described as about to occur when the torment and the trial are ove r. “These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is com e; glorify thy son, that thy son may glorify thee; even as thou gavest him author ity ove r all flesh” – that was in the character of Horus the mortal – “Now , O Father, glorify me with thine ow n self” – in the character of Horus divinized or glorified. The tempor ary trium ph of the treacherous Sut (the pow er of darkne ss) is acknow ledge d by Jesus when Juda s betrays him with a kiss and he succum bs. “This,” he says to his captors, “this is your hour , and the pow er of darkne ss (Sut). And they seized him” (Luke XXII. 53, 54) . But when the associates of Sut saw the doubl e - crow n of Horus on his forehead they fell to the ground upon their faces (Rit., ch. 134, 11) . And when the associates of Juda s=Sut the betrayer, came to take “Jesus of Nazareth,” and he said “I am!” (not I am he!) “They went backw ard and fell to the ground. ” Scene for scene, they are the same."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"One of the titles of Horus is “Lord of the Crow n” (ch. 141, 9), which pos sibly led to Jesus being crow ned “King of the Jews.” In this scene the title of “Jesus of Nazareth” has the same effect on the associates of Juda s that the 872 assum ing of his crow n by Horus had upon the associates of Sut when it caused them to fall on their faces before him. The crow ning of Jesus on the cross is as Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. The cr ow n of trium ph is assigne d to Horus by his father Atum , and all the adve rsaries of the Good Being fall on their faces at the sight of it (Rit., ch. 19). The scene in the garden of Gethsemane, and the cry to the father from the sufferer on the cross are ve ry pitiful — the essence of the tragedy working most subt ly on account of the suppl ication that was all in vain, which makes all the more profound appe al to hum an sym pathy. In the Egypt ian representation there is no such cruel desertion by the father of his suffering son in his agony of great darkne ss. It is far otherwise in the Ritual. When Horus suffers his agony in the darkne ss, after being pierced and made blind by Sut, Ra, the father - God, is with him to com fort and sustain him. He tende rly examines the b leeding wound and soot hes him in his great affliction. Ra charges his ange ls conc erning Horus, or bids the gods to look to his safety and see to his welfare. Ra said to the gods , “Let him be laid upon his couc h that he may recove r.” He also gives the eye o f Horus fire to protect him, and cons um e the black boa r of darkness. There is no sight less sufferer gropi ng helplessly with empty hands out stretched and left unc lasped in the dark voi d of death; no vain and una vailing cry of the forsaken son that stuns the brain and scars the hum an cons cience, and is of itself sufficient to empty the Christian heaven of all fatherhood, and ought to be sufficient to empty earth of all faith in such a father. According to the @synopt ists, Jesus did not carry his ow n cross to the place of execution; it was bor ne thither by one Simon of Cyrene. This is denied in the Gospel attribut ed to John, who declares that Jesus went out from the Judgm ent Hall “bearing the cross for himself.” John is generally truest to the Egypt ian origina l, and here the figur e of Jesus bearing his ow n cross is equi valent to the figure of Ptah - Sekari or Osiris - Tat. The Tat of a fourfold founda tion was the prototype of the cross, and the victim extende d or standi ng with arms akimbo is equi valent to the victi m stretched upon the cross of suffering. Sekari was the sufferer in, or on, or as the Tat, and Osiris was raised in, or as the Tat where Jesus carries the cross. The scour ging of Jesus previous to his being crucified has never been expl ained. According to the record he was not conde mned to bot h mode s of pun ishm ent. It is proba bly a detail derived from the mysteries of Osiris - Sekari, Jesus scour ged at the pillar being an image of Osiris or Ptah as the suffering Sekari in or on the Tat, the pillar with arms, that was supe rseded by the cross in the Christian iconogr aphy. In the Egypt ian drama of the passion Horus was blinde d by Sut and his accom plices, in suffering his change from being the hum an Horus to becom ing Horus in spirit. The incident that is almost om itted from the Gospel account was preserved in the mysteries. It is a com mon subj ect in the passion - play and in religious pictures for the Christ to be blindfolded and brutally buf feted by the soldiers before he is crucified. This occurs in the Tow nley mys teries and in the Cove ntry mysteries, and is referred to in the “Legends of the hol y rood” (pp. 178, 179 , E. E. Text Society).

In one representation Horus has a banda ge ove r his eyes, and the grotesque image of the hum orous Bes appe ars to introduc e a com ic element into the tragedy of the blind sufferer. The blindi ng, buf feting and scour ging, practised in the mysteries, as in pa ssing through fire and water, was evidently cont inue d and extende d in the spor ts and pastimes. Still, the blindf olding of the victim for the buf feting is implied in the Gospel according to Matthew. “Then did they spit in his face and buf fet him; and som e s mote him with the palms of their hands , saying, Prophe sy unt o us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee?” (Matt. XXVI. 68) . It was a com mon popul ar tradition that the Christ was of a red com plexion, like the child or calf which represented the little re d sun of winter and also the Virgin’s infant in its more mystical character. Moreove r, there is a tradition of a crucified child - Christ who was colour ed red like “the calf in the paintings.” Among “the por traits of God the son” Didron cites one in a manus c ript of the four teenth century which answers to the red Christ as a co - type of the red calf. The manus cript “cont ains a miniature of the priest Eleazar sacrificing a red cow ,” and “oppos ite to this miniature is one of Christ on the cross.” “Jesus is entire ly naked, and the colour of his skin is red; he is hum an, poor and ugl y.” The red Christ, equi valent to the red Horus, is here identified with the red cow and therefore with the red calf of the Ritual, which was a sym bol of the little red sufferer, the “af flicted one ” in the winter solstice. In som e of the mystery - plays the Christ wore a close - fitting, flesh - colour ed garment, through which the nails were driven into the wood of the cross. The resurrection robe was always red. Satan wants to know who this ma n in the “red coat” may be. And when Horus rises again, in the character of the avenge r, it is as the “red god. ” The manes thus addr esses him, “O fearsom e one , who art ove r the two earths; Red God, who orderest the block of execution! ” (Rit., ch. 17, Renou f). Jesus likewise appe ars to have been represented as the red God, or the god in red. For “they strippe d him and put on him a scarlet robe ” (Matt. XXVII. 28). A papyr us reed was the throne and sceptre of Horus, the sign of his sove reignt y. In the pictures he is suppor ted by the reed, and one of his titles is “Horus on his papyrus” (Rit., ch. 112, Renouf ). The reed also has been turned to historic account in making a mockery - king of Jesus. “And they plaited a crow n of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kne eled dow n before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, king of the Jews! and they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head” (Matt. XXVII. 27, 29, 30). Jesus is pos ed in anot her form of the Osirian sacrific ial victim. One meaning of the word “sekari” is the silent. This is the typi cal victim that ope ned not his mout h, as the inarticulate Horus. So, having been assigne d the character of the silent one before Pilate, “Jesus no more answered anyt hing. ” It is p ossible that the crow n of thorns placed upon the head of the crucified was derived from the thorn - bus h of Unbu, the solar god , especially if we take it in conne ction with the papyr us reed, anot her 874 "},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"type of Horus, And they plaited a crow n of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand” (Matt. XXVII. 29) . The god and the branch, which is a bus h of flow ering thor n, are identified, the one with the other, unde r the name of Unbu , and the god in the Unbu - thor n is equi valent to the crucified in the crown of thorn. Moreove r, Unbu, the branch, was a title of the Egypt ian Jesus. “I am Unbu of An - arar - ef, the flow er in the abode of occultation” or eclipse (Rit., ch. 71). And if Horus was not figur ed on a cross with the Unbu - thorn upon his head, a s the crow n was afterwards made out , he is the sacrificial victim in the place of utter darkne ss or sight lessness. Horus in An - arar - ef is Horus, Lord of Sekhe m — Horus in the dark. He is also “Unbu, ” that is, Horus in the thor n - bus h. Thus the Unbu - thor n was typi cal of the god, who was personi fied as Unbu by name, and who is Unbu as Horus the sufferer in the dark, equi valent to and the prototype of the victim on the cross as wearer of the crow n of thor n. It is also pos sible that Pilate’s que stion, “What is tru th?” may now be answered for the first time. Jesus says, “I com e into the world that I shoul d bear witness unt o the truth. Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voi ce” (John XVIII. 37, 38). And, in his second character, Horus the king, Horus the anoi nte d and belove d son, not onl y came into the world as testifier to the truth, he was also given the title of Har - Makhe ru, the name of the Word that was made truth by the doi ng of it in his death and resurrection, and the demons tration of a life hereafter at h is second com ing. The typi cal darkne ss at the time of the crucifixion might be noc turnal, or annua l, according to the mythos . When Atum, god of the evening son, is setting from the land of life, at the poi nt of equi nox, with his hands droopi ng, which is e qui valent to the victim who was extende d on the cross, a great darkness ove rspread the earth, and Nut, the mother, is said to be obs cured as she receives the dyi ng deity in her suppor ting arms. The figur e is the same, whether the scene be on the cross or a t the crossing (Rit., ch. 15) . Still more expr ess is the darkne ss spoke n of in the Egyp tian faith, or gos pel (ch. 17) , which cont ains the kernel of the credo. Here we learn that “the darkne ss is of Sekari.” Sekari is a title of Osiris as the mutilated and dismembered god. It is expl ained that this darkne ss of Sekari, the god who is pierced, wounde d, cut in pieces, is caused by Sut “the slayer,” who has “terrified by prostrating.” Sekari is Osiris in the sekru, or coffin; and to be in the coffin, or in the c ruciform figure of the mum my, has the same meaning (with a change of type ) as if the divine victim might be embod ied in the Tat, or extende d on the cross. The darkne ss of Sekari was in the coffin; the darkne ss of Jesus is on the cross. It is obs ervable th at the sixth division of the Tuat in Amenta, correspondi ng to the sixth hour of the night , has no representation of Ra the solar god , and in his absence naturally there was darkne ss. But the three hour s’ darkne ss that was ove r all the earth at the time of the crucifixion has no witness in the world to its being an historic event. In the mythical representation it was natural enough. As the night began at six o’clock, the sixth hour according to that reckoni ng was midni ght , and from twelve to three there was dense darkne ss. This was then appl ied to the dyi ng sufferer in the eschatology, and 875 there was darkne ss for three hour s in the mysteries. The great darkne ss is described in the Ritual as the shut ting up of Seb and Nut, or heaven and earth, and the Re surrection as the rendi ng asunde r. The manes saith, “I am Osiris, who shut up his father and his mother"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"when (or whilst) the great slaught er took place. I am Horus, the eldest of Ra, as he riseth. I am Anup on the day of rendi ng asunde r” (Rit., ch. 69, Ren ouf ). In the com ing forth from the cavern the risen one exclaims, “Let the two door s of earth be ope ned to me: let the bol ts of Seb ope n to me: and let the first mansion be ope ned to me, that he may behol d me who hat h kept guar d over me, and let him enclo se me who hath wound his arms about me, and hath fastened his arms around me in the earth” (ch. 68) . The one who had held him fast with his arms about him in the earth, and who was the keeper of the dead on earth, is Seb; hence it is he who kept gua rd ove r the body that was bur ied in the earth. The part of Seb is also assigne d to Joseph of Arimathea, who took the bod y when it was embalmed with a hund red pounds of myrrh and aloes, and made a mum my of, and laid it in his ow n tom b. The tom b of Seb, the earth ( John XIX. 38 - 41) , becom es the garden of Joseph; the “bol ts of Seb” are replaced by the great stone that Joseph rolls against the doo r of the sepul chre (Matt. XXVII. 60) , and he who kept gua rd ove r the mum my - Osiris in the sepulchre is represented by the gua rd who watches ove r the tom b in the history. “Pilate said unto them, Ye have a gua rd, go your way, make it sure as ye can. So they went and made the sepul chre sure, sealing the stone , the gua rd being with them” (Matt. XXVII. 66) . The gua rd that is set to k eep watch and ward at the sepul chre may be com pared with the “wardens of the passages,” who are “attenda nt upon Osiris” in the tom b. These are the pow ers that safegua rd the body or mum my of Osiris and keep off the forces of his adversaries. The Passages ar e thos e which lead to the out let of Rusta in the resurrection (Rit., ch. 17) . In the chapter by which one arriveth at Rusta, the deceased has risen again. He says, “I am he who is bor n in Rusta. Glory is given to me by thos e who are in their mum mied forms in Pa, at the sanctuary of Osiris, whom the gua rds receive at Rusta when they conduc t (the) Osiris through the demesnes of Osiris.” In this scene of the resurrection the deceased com es forth trium pha nt as Osiris risen (ch. 117) . The dead are there in mum mi ed forms, and these are received by the gua rds as they rise and reach the place of egress in Rusta. In the Gospel according to Matthew a watch was set upo n the sepul chre; the gua rd is spoke n of as “the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus” (Matt. XXVII. 54) . These were watching when the graves were ope ned and the dead “in their mum mied forms” were raised to com e forth from the tom b. As not hing occurs in the Gospel except by miracle, the graves are ope ned by an earthqua ke for the passages to be made, which passages were very ancient in the geogr aphy and pictures of the Egypt ian nether - world. The gua rds, or soldiers, in attenda nce on Jesus are four in num ber. At least it is said that they took the garments of the dead body and “made four parts , to every soldier a part” (John XIX. 23) . These gua rds correspond to the four gua rdians of the coffin Hapi, Tuamutef, Kabhs enuf and Amsu, who watch by the sarcopha gus 876 of the dead Osiris, one at each of its four corners. In a German passion - play the four are invi ncible kni ght s named Dietrich, Hildebrant, Isengr im, and Laurein. At the time of the death upon the cross there is a resurrection which is not the resurrection. This is a general rising of the Manes, not the resurrection of the Christ. “And b ehol d the veil of the sanctuary was rent in twain from the top to the bot tom : and the rocks were rent and the tom bs were ope ned: and many bodi es of the saints that had"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"fallen asleep were raised.” In shor t, a general rising must have preceded the persona l r esurrection of Jesus on the third day after the crucifixion. It is adde d, how ever, that the manes who had already risen came forth “out of the tom bs after his resurrection” and “appe ared unt o many. ” Therefore they stayed in the ope n tom bs a day or two long er in order that he might have the precedence. When Horus rises as a spirit, the Lord of Mehur it, the risen one , is represented by a hawk, and he says, “I am the hawk in the tabernacle, and I pierce through the veil,” or, in another lection, through that w hich is upon the veil. To pierce through the veil of the sanctuary is equi valent to rendi ng the veil of the temple. The hawk is a type of the sun - god in the solar mythos and of the spirit in the eschatology. Thus the veil was pierced or rent asunde r when H orus rose in the shape of a divine hawk to becom e the Lord of heaven. In the Gospel (Matt. XXVII. 51), at the mom ent when Jesus “yielded up his spirit,” it is said, “and behol d the veil of the sanctuary was rent in twain from top to bot tom : and the earth d id qua ke: and the rocks were rent: and the tom bs were ope ned,” and, in brief, this was what the Ritual terms “the day of rendi ng asunde r,” when the rocks of the Tser hill were ope ned, which is the day of resurrection in the mysteries of Amenta. The death o f Osiris was follow ed by the saturnalia of Sut, in a reign of misrule and lawlessness which lasted dur ing the five black days or dies non of the Egypt ian calenda r when everything was turned tops y - turvy — a saturnalia, which to all appe arance, is yet celebrat ed in Uppe r Egypt (Frazer, Golden Bough, I, p. 231) . The mutilation of Osiris in his coffin, the strippi ng of his corpse and tearing it asunde r by Sut, who scattered it piecemeal, is represented by the strippi ng of the dead body of Jesus whilst it still hu ng upon the cross, and parting the garments amongs t the spoi lers. In John’ s account the crucifixion takes place at the time of the Passove r, and the victim of sacrifice in human form is subs tituted for, and identified with, the Paschal lamb. But, as this v ersion further show s, the death assigne d is in keeping with that of the non - hum an victim. Not a bone of the sufferer was to be broke n. This is suppos ed to be in fulfilment of prophe cy. It is said by the Psalmist (XXXIV. 20), “He keepeth all his bone s; not one of them is broke n.” But this was in strict accordance with the law of totemic tabu. No matter what the type , from bear to lamb, no bone of the sacrificial victim was ever permitted to be broke n; and the onl y change was in the subs titution of the human type for the animal, which had been made already when hum an Horus became the type of sacrifice instead of the calf or lamb. When the Australian natives sacrificed their little bear, not a bone of it was ever broke n; when the Iroquo is sacrificed the white d og, not a bone was broke n. This was a com mon 877 custom , on account of the resurrection, as conc eived by the primitive races, and the same is appl ied to Osiris. Every bone of the skeleton was to remain intact as a basis for the future bui lding. After the murder and mutilation of Osiris in Sekhe m, the judgm ent is executed on the cons pirators in the mystery of ploughi ng the earth on the night of fertilizing the soil with the blood of the betrayer Sut and his associates. This is done before the great divine chiefs in Tattu! In the Gospels (Matt. XXVII. 6) the chief priests take the place of the divine chiefs in the mystery of ploughi ng the earth and fertilizing or manur ing it with the blood of the wicked: they buy the pot ter’s field, and this was called Aceld ama, the field of blood. The field of blood here bought with the price paid for the"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"betrayal takes the place of the field that is fertilized with blood in the Ritual. In the Acts it is Juda s himself, not the “chief priests,” who “pur chased a field with the reward of his iniqui ty.” According to this version, Juda s fertilizes or manur es the field with his ow n blood, as doe s the betrayer Sut, on the night of fertilizing the field in Tattu. When, in his resurrection, Jesus reappe ared to the disciples, they thou ght it an appa rition. This it shoul d have been if the life had been hum an, the death actual, the story true. In the Egypt ian, how ever, the day of reappe arance is termed the “day of appa rition” ; but reappe aring= appa rition is not necessarily manifesting as t he hum an ghos t. The Christ as Horus was not a hum an ghos t reappe aring on the earth; and Horus the pur e spirit, the typi cal divine son of god, the reappe aring one , might have denied being a pha ntom or a ghos t, for he woul d not be manifesting to men, but to other characters in the religious drama. This being denied on behalf of the divinity, the carnalizers then had recour se to their hum an phys ics to illustrate the denial by making the risen Christ corpor eal. In John’ s account , which is always the nearest to the Egypt ian original, there is no denial of the ghos t theory, no declaration that the risen one is not a spirit but a veritable hum an body of flesh and bone . He merely “show ed unt o them his hands and side,” as Horus might have show n his wounds , and no dou bt did show them, in the mysteries — the wounds that were inflicted by Sut. In fact, when Sut has wounde d Horus in the eye, he show s the wound to Ra, his father (Rit., ch. 112) . When Horus, or the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus, rises in the sepul chre on com ing forth to day it is in the semi - corpor eal form of the Karest - mum my that is not yet becom e pur e spirit and therefore has not yet ascende d to his father in the hawk - headed likeness of Ra. This figur e can be studi ed in the tomb as that of Amsu. The scene of the res urrection is in Amenta, the earth of eternity, the earth of the manes, not on the earth of mortals. It is here the risen Horus breathes the breath of his new life into the sleeping dead to raise them from their coffins, sepul chres and cells. When the Egypt ian Christ, or Karest, rose up from the tom b as Amsu - Horus it was in a likeness of the buried mum my, as regards the shape, with one arm loos ened from the swathes or banda ges. But this resurrection was not corpor eal on earth. Osiris had been transformed int o Horus, and although the mum my - shape was still retained, the texture had been transubs tantiated; the corpus was transfigur ed into the glorious body of the Sahu or divine mum my. The mystery of transubs tantiation 878 was not unde rstood by the writers of t he Gospels, who did not know whether Jesus appe ared in the body or in spirit, as a man or as a god. They carried off all they coul d, but were not in pos session of the secret wisdom which survived amongs t the Egypt o - gnos tics. They wrote as carnalizers of th e Christ. It follow s that the risen Jesus of the canoni cal Gospels is not a reality in either world; neither in the sphe re of time, nor as divine Horus transfigur ed into spirit. ’Tis but a misappr opr iated type ; the spur ious spectre of an impos sible Christ; a picture of nobody . The Christian history fails in rende ring Horus as an appa rition of Osiris. When Horus came from Sekhe m he had left the earthly body behind him in the sepul chre, and was greeted as pur e spirit by the glorified one s who rejoiced to see how he cont inue d walking as the risen Horus, he who “steppe th onw ard through eternity” (Rit., ch. 42) . Jesus in this character com es forth from the tom b"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"in the same body that was bur ied and still is human, flesh and bone s and all. Thus , as a pha ntom , he is a count erfeit; a carnalized ghos t, upon the resurrection of which no real future for the hum an spirit ever coul d or ever will be permanently based. A corpse that has not made the transformation from the hum an Horus into Horus the pur e spirit offers no fou nda tion for belief in any know n natural fact. Horus in his resurrection is described as being onc e more set in motion. At this poi nt he says, “I am not know n, but I am one who know eth thee. I am not to be grasped, but I am one who graspeth thee. I am Horus , prince of eternity, a fire before your faces, which inflameth your hearts tow ards me. I am master of my throne , and I pass onw ards.” “The path I have ope ned is the present time, and I have set myself free from all evil” (ch. 42, Renouf ). But when he is t ransubs tantialized, it is said of the deceased in his resurrection: “The gods shall com e in touc h with him, for he shall have becom e as one of them.” Now let us see how this was conve rted into history. Jesus is the prince of eternity in oppos ition to Satan , Sut, or Juda s, the prince of this world. In his resurrection he is suppos ed to have ope ned the pathw ay from the tom b historically and for the first time som e 1800 or 1900 years ago. When he rises from the dead he is unknow n to the watchers, but he know s them. Mary kne w not that the risen form was Jesus. He is not to be grasped, saying, “Touc h me not ,” or do not grasp me, “for I am not yet ascende d unt o my Father” (John XX. 14, 17) . On the way to Emmaus Jesus appe ars and inflames the hearts of the disciple s tow ards him, after calling them “slow of heart,” and “they said one to anther, Was not our heart burning within us?” (Luke XXIV. 13, 32). Horus had ope ned a path from the tom b as the sun - god in the mythos , the divine son of God in the eschatology, and he ascende d to his father and took his seat upon the throne of which he had becom e the lord and master. So Jesus goe s on his way “unt o the mount ain,” where he had appoi nted to meet his follow ers (Matt. XXVIII. 16) . The mount ain in the Ritual is the mount of rebirth in heaven, whether of the sun - god or of the endur ing spirit. The change from bodi ly death to future life in spirit was acted as a transformation - scene in the mysteries of the resurrection. The mum my - Osiris was an effigy of death. The Sahu - mum my 8 79 Amsu - Horus is an image of the glorious body into which Osiris transubs tantiated to go forth from Sekhe m as pur e spirit. It is the mummy in this second stage that is of primary impor t. First of all the dead body was smeared ove r with ungue nts and thus g lorified. During the process of anoi nting it was said, “O Asar (the deceased) the thick oil which is pour ed upon thee furnishes thy mout h with life” (Budge , “The Mum my,” p. 163) . It is also said that the anoi nting is done to give sight to the eyes, hearing to the ears, sense of smell to the nos trils and utteranc e to the mout h. To embalm the body thus was to karas it and the embalmment was a mode of making the typical Christ as the Anoi nted. Thus the mortal Horus was inve sted with the glory of the only God - b egot ten Son. Now this making of the Krst, or mum my - Christ, after the Egypt ian fashion is appa rent in the Gospels. When the wom an brings the alabaster cruse of precious ointment to the hous e of Simon and pou rs it on the head of Jesus he says, “In that she p our ed this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepar e me for my bur ial” (Matt. XXVI. 12) . She was making the Christ as the anoi nted - mum my previous to interment. After the description of the"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"crucifixion it is said that Nicode mus came and brought a “mixtur e of myrrh and aloes, about a hundr ed pound” and “they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices as the custom of the Jews is to bur y” (John XIX. 39, 40) . This again denot es the making of the Karest - mum my= the Christ. Moreove r, it is the dead mum my in one version and it is the living body in the other which is anoi nted, just as Horus was anoi nted with the exceedingl y precious Antu ointment, or oil, that was pour ed upon his head and face to represent his glory. The two Mertæ - sisters are the watchers ove r the dead Osiris. They are also the mour ners who weep ove r him when he is anoi nted and prepared for his burial. It is said of Osiris that he was trium pha nt ove r his adve rsaries on the night when Isis lay watching in tears ove r her bro ther Osiris (ch. 18) . But the Mertæ - sisters bot h watch and bot h weep ove r the dead body . In the vigne ttes to the Ritual one of the two stands at the head and one at the feet of the body on the bier. These two mour ners, weepers, anoi nters, or embalmers, app ear in the Gospels as two different wom en. According to John it was Mary the sister of Martha who anoi nted Jesus for his bur ial. And as these are the two divine sisters in historic gui se we ough t to find one at the head of the victim and one at the feet, a s, in fact, we do so find them. In the account furnished by Luke it is said that the wom an who stood behind at the feet of Jesus weeping “began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head” (Luke VII. 38). No name is given for t he wom an who was “a sinne r,” which seems to denot e the other Mary called Magda lene. Matthew also om its the name of the wom an with an alabaster cruse or flask. In keeping with the mythos this other one of the two Mertæ - sisters shoul d be Martha, but the poi n t is that the wom an with the cruse doe s not anoi nt the feet of Jesus. She pour ed the ointment “upon his head as he sat at meat” (Matt. XXVI. 7). Thus we see there are two different wom en who anoi nt Jesus, one at the head, one at the feet, even as the two d ivine sisters of Osiris called the Mertæ, or watchers, stand at the head and feet of Osiris, when preparing him for his bur ial, or watching in 880 tears, like Isis, the prototype of the wom an who never ceased to kiss the feet of Jesus since the time when he had com e into the hous e (Luke VII. 45 - 6). We have identified the other sister Nepht hys , the mistress of the hous e, with the hous ekeeper Martha, and as Nepht hys also carries the bow l or vase upon her head, this may account for the vessel of alabaster th at was carried by the “wom an” who poured the ointment on the head of Jesus, whereas Mary the sister of Martha pou red it on his feet. Martha is one of the two Mertæ by name. In the Egypt ian mythos the two Mertæ are Isis, the dear love r of Horus the Lord, bo wed at his feet, and Nepht hys mour ning at his head (Naville, Todt enbuc h, v. 1, kap. 17, A. g. and B. b.). The Karast - mum my was the body of the dead in Osiris who were prepared by hum an hands to meet their Lord in spirit when wrapt in the seamless vesture of a thous and folds, which was typi cally the robe of immortality, when they were baptized and pur ified and anoi nted with the unc tion of Horus taken from the tree of life. The process of preparing, embalming and Christifying the mum my obvi ous ly survives in the Chrisom e or krisum of the Rom an Cathol ic Chur ch. The chrisom e itself is prope rly a white cloth which the “minister of baptism places on the head of the newly - anoi nted"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"child.” The chrisom as ointment is made of oil and balm. In the instructions for priv ate baptism it is charged that the minister shall put the white vesture, com monl y called a chrisom e, upon the child. The chrism - cloth is still the vesture of immortality, for if the infant dies within a mont h after birth, the chrisom e is its shroud and the chrisom - child becom es an image in survival of the Karast - mum my in Amenta. Let it be assum ed that to all appe arance the resurrection in Amenta is corpor eal. The hum an Horus, or the Osiris, who had passed through death, and been laid out as the mum my in th e Tuat, still retains the form of the mum my that was made on earth. The difference is in Horus having risen to his feet and freed his right arm from the burial banda ges. Inde ed, the dead were reincorpor ated in Amenta as the Sahu - mum my. The Egypt ian word Sa hu signi fies to incorpor ate, and in this phys ical - looki ng form they were reincorpor ated for the resurrection in the earth of eternity. Amsu had made a change in rising to his feet, but was not yet the Horus glorified with the soul of Ra; therefore he has n ot yet ascende d to the father. To the sense of sight he is corporeal still, and has not transubs tantiated into spirit. When he doe s, the hawk or Menat will alight to abide upon him and he will assum e the likeness of his father Ra, the bird - headed hol y spir it. It is the body - soul that rises in Amenta which has to suffer pur gatorial rebirth before it can becom e “pur e spirit” as the Ritual of the resurrection has it, to attain eternal life. So far as reincorpor ation of the soul in Sahu - shape coul d go, the resu rrection is corpor eal. Yet this was onl y a dramatic mode of representation in the mystery of transubs tantiation, which include d several acts. It is in this character of Amsu - Horus reincorpor ated as the Sahu - mum my issuing from the tom b that Jesus is describ ed by Luke : “See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself” (ch. XXIV. 39) . In the absence of the gnos is the reincorpor ation in Amenta led to the doc trine of a phys ical resurrection at the last day on this earth. The pow er of resurrection was imparted by 881 Ra, the father in spirit, to the anoi nted and belove d son. And Horus is said to be the “bringe r of the breaths” to his “follow ers” (Rit., chapters on breathing 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59) . Horus as he issues forth to day, in his resurrection, com es to giv e the breath of life to the manes in Amenta, saying, “I give the breezes to the faithful dead amid thos e who eat bread.” This chapter of the Ritual follow s the decease of Horus, which is equi valent to the crucifixion of Jesus. In this the speaker says, “I have com e to an end on behalf of the Lord of heaven. I am written dow n sound of heart, and I rest at the table of my father Osiris” (ch. 70) . It is also said in the Rubr ic, “if this scripture is know n upon earth he (the Osiris) will com e forth to day; he w ill have pow er to walk on the earth amid the living. ” Jesus in the Gospel has “com e to an end for the Lord of heaven.” He likewise manifests on earth “amid the living.” He gives “the breezes to the faithful dead” when he breathes on them, saying, “Receive ye of the hol y spirit.” It is “the wom an” in the Gospels who announc e the resurrection and proclaim that Jesus has left the tom b. According to Matthew “the wom an” are “Mary Magda lene and the other Mary,” who “ran to bring the disciples word” (XXVIII. 1, 8 ). According to Mark (XVI. 1) the wom en were Mary Magda lene and Mary (the mother) of James, and Salom e, who discove red that Jesus had arisen but were afraid to make it know n. Here it is Mary Magda lene, who proclaims the resurrection. It is Mary Magda lene i n John (XX. 1,"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"2) who first announc es that the Lord has arisen. Luke XXIV. 10 has it that “Mary Magda lene and Joanna , and Mary (mother) of James and other wom en” first found the sepul chre empty and “told these things unto the apostles.” These conf licting a ccount s agree in the one essential poi nt, that it was the woman or the wom en who proclaimed the resurrection, and this is as it shoul d be according to the data in the Ritual. When the deceased com es forth from the tom b and reaches the hor izon of the resurr ection he exclaims, “I rise as a god amongs t men. The godde sses and the wom en proclaim me when they see me!” It is the godde sses and the wom en who see the risen Horus first and proclaim him to the others. Usually the wom an and the female deities are identi cal as the two divine sisters who are represented in the Gospels by the two Marys, but in som e of the scenes there are other wom en in attenda nce as well as the two sisters - Mertæ. Now , as the two Marys are originally godde sses we have the same group of godd esses and “the wom en” (in Luke XXIV. 10) as in the Ritual (79, 11) and bot h agree in proclaiming the resurrection and hailing the risen Lord with jubi lation. This chapter cont ains all the data necessary to cons truct the story of the “historic” resurrection in which the Christ arises as a god amongs t men, and is proclaimed by the wom en. The allusions in the Ritual are very brief. The style of the writing is econom ical as that of the lapidary. The Egypt ians neither used nor tolerated many words; verbos ity was prohibited by one of their com mandm ents. But these allusions refer to a drama that was represented in the mysteries, the characters and scenes of which were all as well know n as are thos e in the Christian Gospels when the play is performed at Ammergau. An d this statement, made at the mom ent of his resurrection – “I rise as a god 882 amongs t men. The godde sses and the wom en proclaim me when they see me” – cont ained a germ that was pregna nt with a whol e chapter of the future Gospel “history.” In the Gospel ac cording to John there is but one wom an weeping at the tom b. This was Mary Magda lene, who corresponds to the first great mother Apt, she who bore the seven sons that preceded the solar Horus of the pre - Osirian cult. She, like Anup , lived on in the bur ial - pl ace with thos e that waited for the resurrection. She is called Apt, the “mistress of divine protections .” Apt is portrayed as kindl er of the light for the deceased in the dark of death (ch. 137, Vig. Papyr us of Nebseni). Thus the old bringe r to rebirth is the kindl er of a light in the sepul chre. Mary Magda lene who takes her place com es to the tom b, “early, while it was yet dark,” and finds the stone move d away and light enough to see by kindl ed in the tom b. Isis also was a form of the great mother alone . Sh e is mentione d singl y as watching in tears ove r her brother Osiris by night in Rekhe t (Rit., ch. 18) . So Mary Magda lene is described as “standi ng without at the tom b weeping” alone as the one wom an. But, according to Matthew, there were two wom en at the to mb. “Mary Magda lene was there and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepul chre (ch. XXVII. 61) . And in the Osirian representation Isis and Nephthys are the two wom en called the “two mour ners who weep and wail ove r Osiris in Rekhe t” (ch. 1). Isis and Nepht hys , the two divine sisters, are the two wom en at the sepul chre of Osiris. They are portrayed, one at the head the other at the feet of the mum my. They sing the song of the resurrection as a magical means of raising their dear one from the dead. A for m of this is to be found in the evoc ations addr essed to the dead Osiris by the two sisters, who say: “Thy two sisters are"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"near thee, protecting thy fune ral bed, calling thee in weeping, thou who art prostrate on thy fune ral bed” ( Records of the Past, vol . 2, pp. 121 - 126) . Horus rises in his Ithypha llic form with the sign of virility erect; the member that was restored by Isis when the body had been torn in pieces by Sut. This may account for the Phallus found in the Rom an Catacom bs as a figur e of the resurr ection, which, if the Gospel story had been true, woul d denot e the pha llus of an historic Jew, instead of the typi cal member of Horus whos e word was thus manifested with pube scent pow er in the person of the risen Amsu. In the Osirian legend there are thre e wom en, or godde sses, who especially attend upon Osiris to prepare him for his bur ial. These are the great mother, Neith, and the two divine sisters, Isis and Nepht hys . It was related in the ancient version that Neith arrayed the mum my in his grave - clothe s for the fune rary chamber called “the good house,” the hous e in which the dead were embalmed and swathed in pur e white linen. This is described in the Book of the Dead (ch. 172) when it is said to the Osiris N, “Thou receivest a banda ge of the finest line n from the hands of the attenda nt of Ra.” The raiment put on Osiris by Neith was said to be woven by the two watchers in the tom b. In the preparation of Osiris for his bur ial, the ointment or ungue nts were com pounde d and appl ied by Neith. It was these that were to preserve the mum my from decay and 883 dissolution. These three may be com pared with the three Marys in the Gospels, thus : Neith, the great mother=Mary Magda lene, the great mother; Isis=Mary; Nepht hys =Martha. There was also a group of seven minis trants in attenda nce at the birth of Horus or rebirth of Osiris. These, in the astrono mical mythol ogy, were cons tellated in the female hippopot amus – our Great Bear – as thos e who ministered “of their subs tance” to the young “bul l of the seven cow s” (Rit., ch. 141 - 3), which were seven forms of the great mother, seven Fates or Hathor s in the birthpl ace, from the time when this was in the year of the Great Bear, with the seven in attenda nce on the child. In the legend related by Luke , the whol e of the seven wom en who ministered of their subs tance to Jesus (or the sacrificial victim), appe ar to have been groupe d together with the dead body in the sepul chre. “Now they were Mary Magda lene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other wom en with them” (Luke XX IV. 10) . These are called “the wom en which had com e with them out of Galilee.” They are also termed “certain wom en of our com pany” (ch. XXIV. 22). The number is not specified; this being one of thos e sundr ies that were safest if left vague . Thus we find th e foremost Great Mother at the tom b; the two divine sisters; the three wom en with Neith include d, and as we sugge st, the com pany of ministrants, who were the seven mothers, seven Hathor s, seven Meri, or seven wom en in three different versions of the histor ic resurrection. In the version given by Matthew there is but one divine visitant at the tom b, in addi tion to the two wom en here called the two Marys. As the Sabba th day began to dawn “came Mary Magda lene and the other Mary to see the sepul chre. And behol d there was a great earthqua ke; for an ange l of the Lord descende d from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it. His appe arance was as light ning, and his raiment was as white as snow ” (Matt. XXVIII. 2, 3). The ange l that rolls the stone a way from the tom b in the Gospel for the bur ied Christ to rise corresponds to the god Shu in the Ritual, who is described as upl ifting the heaven when the god Atum or Horus com es forth from the"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"sarcopha gus and passes through the gate of the rock to appr oach the land of spirits. It is said the gate of Tser is where Shu stands when he lifts up the heaven (Rit., 17, 56 - 7). The Tser was the rock of the hor izon in which the dead body of Osiris was laid for its repos e when it was bur ied in Annu . Shu is not onl y th e uplifter of heaven or raiser of the gravestone , he is also the ope ner of the sepul chre as the bringe r of breath to the newly awakened soul . The Egypt ian kne w well enough that his body would remain where it was left when bur ied. For that it had been mumm ified. His difficulty was conc erning his soul , and how to get this freed from its surroundi ngs in the speediest fashion and the most endur ing form. The Ritual speaks of the “shade,” the “soul ” and “spirit” as being in the tom b with the mum my - Osiris who ris es from stage to stage according to the evol ution of his spirit from the bonds of matter. Chief of these are the body - soul and spirit - Ka. The deceased, when in the tom b, is thus addr essed, “Let the way be ope ned to thy Ka and to thy Soul , O glorified one ; thou shalt not be imprisone d by 884 thos e who have the custody of soul s and spirits and who shut up the shades of the dead” (Rit., ch. 92) . Thus the body - soul and Ka made their appe arance in the tom b previous ly to being blende d in the manifesting soul , c alled the doubl e of the dead which cons tituted the risen Horus, and which was the onl y one of the seven soul s that bor e the hum an lineaments (Rit., ch. 178 . The god who rises again is described in the Egypt ian litany of Ra (58) as “he who raises his soul a nd conc eals his body .” His name is that of Herba, he who raises the soul . The body being hidde n as Osiris, the soul was raised as Horus. Hence, as it is said, the mum my of Osiris was not found in the sepul chre. In one sense the body vanished by transubs tan tiation into spirit. The night of the evening meal on which the body was eaten sacramentally is called “the night of hiding him who is supr eme of attribut es” (Rit., ch. 18) . The body was eaten typically as a mode of conve rting matter into spirit; this was the motive of the eucharist from the beginni ng when the mother was the victim eaten. In one of the texts cited by Birch conc erning the bur ial of the god Osiris at Abydos , it is said the sepul chral chamber was searched but the body was not found . The “Shade , it was found” (Proceedings Bib. Archy., Dec. 2, 1884 , p. 45) . The shade was a primitive type of the soul ; it is the shadow of an earthly body projected as it were into Amenta, and was por trayed in som e of the vigne ttes lying black upon the ground of that earth, like the shadow of the hum an body on this earth. In Marcion’ s account of the resurrection there is no body to be found in the tomb; onl y the pha ntom , or the shade, was visible there. So in the Joha nni ne version (ch. XX. 17) the buried body of Jesus is missing; the Shade is present in the tom b; but this is of a texture that must not be touc hed. Like Amsu it neither represents the dead corpus nor the spirit perfected. It is qui te pos sible that we get a glimpse of the “Ka” as that persona ge in the sepu lchre described by Mark, who relates that when the wom en entered the tom b they “saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe and they were amazed” (ch. XVI. 5). According to the gnos is, the Ka had here taken the place of the missing m um my which had risen, or as the Egypt ians said, Osiris had made his transformation into Amsu - Horus. According to Luke , when the wom en came to the tomb with their spices and ointments they “found not the body of the Lord Jesus.” But, “behol d, two men stood by them in dazzling appa rel,”"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"who said to them “why seek ye the Living (One) among the dead?” (Luke XXIV. 5). These, in the Joha nni ne Gospel, are “two ange ls in white, sitting one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain” (John XX. 12). Now , if the “young man” represented the Ka - image in the hum an form we may suppos e the “two men” to have been the soul and spirit called the Ka and the soul of the glorified, that were por trayed in the Egypt ian sepul chre and which are to be read of in the Ritual. One of the num erous Egypt o - gnos tic scriptures which at one time were extant has lately been discove red in the fragm ent of a gos pel assigne d to Peter. This from the orthodox poi nt of view is cons idered to be “doc etic” — which is anot her name for non - historical. From this we learn that in the 885 resurrection “the heavens ope ned and two men descende d thence with great radiance” “and bot h the young men entered” the tom b. Two men entered and three figures issued forth. “They behol d three men com ing out of the tom b, and two of them were suppor ting a third, and a cross was follow ing them; and the heads of the two men reached to the heaven, but the head of him who was being led along by them was highe r than the heavens.” And they heard a voice from hea ven which said, “Hast thou preached to them that are asleep?” And a respons e of “Yea” was heard from the cross. This has no parallel in the canoni cal Gospels, but , as Egyp tian, it is the scene of Atum (Ptah or Osiris) rising again in or with the two sons H u and Sau. Also, in the pre - Osirian mythos , Hu and Sau, the two sons of Atum - Ra, suppor t their father when he issues from the tom b and makes his exit from Amenta. These are two young men who are in the retinue of Ra, and who accom pany their father in his r esurrection daily (Rit., ch. 17). To a spiritualist the doc trines of the fleshly faith are gha stly in their grossness. The founda tion of the creed was laid in a phys ical resurrection of the body; and the flesh and blood of that body were to be eaten in th e eucharistic rite as a phys ical mode of incorpor ating the divine. It is true the doc trine of transubs tantiation was adde d to gild the dead body for eating. But the historical rende ring of the matter necessitated the subs titution of the phys ical for the sp iritual interpretation. The founde rs onl y carried off the carnalized Horus, the Karast - mum my, for their Christ. They raised him from the grave corpor eally; whereas the Egypt ians left that type of Osiris in matter, that image of Horus on earth in the tom b. Horus did rise again, but not in matter. He spiritualized to becom e the supe rhum an or divine Horus. The Egyptians did not exhum e the fleshly body , living nor dead, to eat it with the expe ctation of assimilating Horus to themselves or becom ing Horus by assi milating the blood and bod y of his phys ical subs tance. This was what was done by the Christian Sarkol atræ. Hooke r asks: “Doth any man doub t that even from the flesh of Christ (eaten sacramentally) our very bodi es do receive that life which shall make them glorious at the latter day?” This was an inevitable result of making the Christ historical, and of cont inuing the carnalized Horus in a region beyond the tom b by means of a phys ical resurrection of the dead. The Christians having carried off the Corpus Chr isti, which the Egypt ians transubs tantiated in the sepul chre, have never since know n what to do with it. But as the Christ rose again in the material body and ascende d with it into heaven, leaving no mum my in the tomb, they can but nurse the delusive hope that a phys ical saviour may redeem the phys ical corpse, so that thos e who believe may be"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"raised by him at the last day and follow him bodi ly into paradise. In this way the founda tions of the faith were corpor eally laid. Also in this way the pre - extant “typ es” of the Christ are suppos ed to have been realized: the fore - shadow s subs tantialized, and Horus the Lord who had been the anoi nted Christ, the immortal Son of God in the Egypt ian religion for at least ten thous and years, was at last conve rted into a Jude an peasant as 886 the uni que persona ge of the Gospels, and the veritable saviour of the world. It is not alleged in the Gospel history that the victim was torn piecemeal as well as crucified. And yet the bread which represents his body in the eucharisti c meal is religious ly torn to pieces in com memoration of the event that doe s not occur in the Gospels; a performance that is sugge stive of thos e poor Norway rats which lose their lives in trying to cross the waters where there was a passage onc e by land. J esus is not torn in pieces, but Osiris was. When Sut did battle with Un - Nefer, the Good Being, he tore the body into fragm ents, and that is the sacrifice still com memorated in the Christian eucharist. Unde r one of his many titles in the Ritual Osiris is “t he Lord of resurrections .” But this doe s not merely denot e the periodi city of the resurrection. There were several resurrections of the god in matter and in spirit. Osiris rose again to life in the returning waters of the Nile. He rose again in the renewal of vegetation represented by Horus the branch of endl ess years; and as the papyrus shoot . He rose again upon the third day, in the moon; or as the sun, the supr eme soul of life in phys ical nature. These were follow ed in the eschatology by the god who rose again from Amenta as Horus in spirit; as the Bennu - Osiris, or as Ra the hol y spirit. Jesus is likewise por trayed as the Lord of resurrections . He is said to have risen on the third day; also on the four th day, after being three night s in the earth; also a fter forty days, when he ascende d into heaven from the mount ; and when he rose up from the dead with power to pass where door s were shut , and to impart the Holy Spirit (John XX. 19) to his follow ers, the same as Horus in the Ritual (ch. 1). The first act o f Horus in his resurrection is to free his right arm from the banda ge of the mum my. The next is to cast aside the seamless swathe in which the body had been wrappe d for bur ial. Now , after so much of the mythos has been established in place of the “history, ” it will not be so very incredible if we sugge st a mythical and recogni zably Kamite origin for an episode in the Gospel according to Mark which has no record elsewhere. When Jesus is arrested in the garden or enclosure of Gethsemane preparatory to his dea th and resurrection it is said that: “A certain young man follow ed him having a linen cloth cast about him ove r his naked body; and they laid hol d on him; but he left the linen cloth and fled naked” (Mark XIV. 51). Such a statement standi ng alone , pur pos el ess and une xpl ained, is perfectly maniacal as history; clearly it is a fragm ent of som ething that is otherwise out of sight. The Greek word sindon represents the Egypt ian shenti, a linen garment which is derived from shena, a name for the flax from which t he fine linen of the mum my was made. The shenti is a linen tuni c. The mum my - swathe was also made from shena, and this was the garment wove n withou t a seam. Therefore we infer that the “young man” was a form of the manes risen with the banda ges about him, a nd that when he “left the linen - cloth and fled naked” he had made his transformation into spirit like any other of the mum mies."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":" So soon as the risen Lord had ascende d into heaven from the sum mit of Mount Olivet, after the space of forty days, the disciple s 887 are described as meeting in the “uppe r chamber” with Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brethren who were gathered toge ther for the purpose of prayer (Acts I. 13, 14) . Now , “the uppe r chamber” was the cubi culum attached to the sepul chre, bot h in Ro me and Egypt , for the meeting of the bereaved relatives and the solemnizing of the mour ning for the dead. One of the inscriptions in the catacom bs calls it “the uppe r chamber to celebrate the memory of the dead” (“Cubi culum supe rius ad confreque ntandum mem oriam qui escentium .” De Rossi, Rom a Sot terane a, 3, 474 .) There were two fune rary chambers in the Egypt ian sepul chre; one was for the mum my and one for the Ka. Also the Ka - chamber was without a doo r, it being held that the risen spirit coul d pass through ma tter without a door way. This is repeated in the Gospel according to John. When Jesus came into the room , “the door s being shut ,” and stood in the midst of the disciples, it was in the character of the Ka or doubl e of the dead endow ed with pow er to rise aga in, to pass through matter, and reappe ar to the living. The same dua l figure is to be found in the pre - Christian catacom bs with the subt erranean sepul chre for the mummy or corpse beneath, and the chamber above which was know n as the cubiculum or cubi culum memoriæ. It was the pre - Christian custom for the relatives and friends of the deceased to meet toge ther in this uppe r chamber at the fune ral feast, or eucharistic meal, for the purpos e of celebrating the resurrection from the dead, and of making their offe rings and obl ations to the ancestral spirits in the mortuary sacrament. The last scene in the persona l “history” coincides with the ascent of Atum - Horus from Amenta, and the soul ascendi ng into paradise, called the Aarru - fields. Jesus, in his final disapp earance from the earth, ascends the typical mount , called Olivet, at the end of forty days. “And when he had said these things as they were looki ng, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight . And while they were look ing steadfastly into heaven as he went, behol d, two men stood by them in white appa rel which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looki ng into heaven?” (Acts I. 9 - 11). The ascent of Jesus from the mount into the clouds of heaven can be traced twice ove r, in the two diffe rent categor ies, mythical and eschatologi cal. It was made “from the mount called Olivet.” This, we repeat, was Mount Bakhu, the mount of the olive - tree of dawn. The ascent at the tree was made each day, and also yearly in the annual round, by the god in hi s resurrection from Amenta. Thus the sun - god in the mythos makes his ascent by the Mount of Olives, or the olive - tree of dawn, when “appr oaching to the land of spirits in heaven” (Rit., ch. 17). In this character Nefer - Tum the young sun - god is the Egypt ian Jesus risen from the nor thern doo r of the tomb, or the nor thern gate of the Tuat. In the pha se of eschatology it is the risen soul upon its upward jour ney to the circum pol ar paradise “nor th of the olive - tree” where the eternal city was eventually attained . The olive (Bakhu) also figur es in the eschatology as well as in the astronom ical mythol ogy . “He who dw elleth in the olive - tree” is a name of Horus in the burial - place; and in his resurrection the Osiris says, when com ing forth from the 888"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":" judgm ent - hal l, “I pass on to a place that is nor th of the olive - tree.” Or it might be the fig - tree at the meeting - place of Jesus with Nathanael. It was no earthly mount on which the typi cal teacher gave instruction to the four called fishermen or to the twelve as reap ers of the harvest. It was the mount ain of Amenta and the doubl e earth that we have traced all through the Ritual called the moun t of resurrection and of glory. This, in the mythos , was the mount of the green olive - tree of the Egypt ian dawn and a figure of the ascent to heaven in the eschatology. Up this mount the risen manes attained the circle of the divine pow ers attached to Osiris (Rit., ch. 1 in the older MSS.). And up this mount the solar god , as Atum - Horus, makes his ascent to heaven, termed the land of spirits; that is, from the Mount of Olives, the track which is here follow ed by the canoni cal Jesus (Rit., ch. 17). Moreove r, in his com ing forth to day and making the ascent to heaven, Atum was attende d by his two sons , Hu and Sau, who are said to acc om pany their father daily. The copy, in this instance, is so close to the original that it may be pos sible to identify the “two men in white appa rel” who say to the disciples, “Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven?” (Acts I. 10, 11). Thos e tw o men in white appa rel correspond to Hu and Sau in the Ritual (ch. 17, 60 - 64) who accom pany the sun - god in his resurrection from the place of burial in Amenta. In the vague pha se, Jesus disappe ars into a cloud and passes out of sight . In the Ritual of the resurrection the departed spirit is received with greetings by the lords of eternity, who ope n their arms to embrace and bid him welcom e to the table of his father at the festival that is to be eternal in the heavens.

Of late years certain Sayings of Jesus or Ι η , as the name is abbr eviated, written in Greek on the leaf of a papyr us - book , have been discove red in the rubbi sh - heaps of Oxyr hync hus . These were at onc e assum ed to be the sayings of Jesus, an historic Jew. The present obj ect is to prove that all such Logi a were the sayings of him who is here set forth as the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus, who had many type s and names but no indi vidua l form of historic persona lity. The Book of the Dead, or Ritual of the resurrection, chiefly represents the mysteries of Amenta i n the Osirian pha se of the religious drama. But there is an older stratum than that of the Osirian eschatology. The Sayer of the Kamite Logi a Kuriaka is identifiable in at least three different Egypt ian religions ; in one as the Osirian Horus who predom inat es by name in the Ritual; in anot her as Iu, the Sa or son of Ius ā as and Atum - Ra; and a third as Iu - em - hetep, the son of Ptah. Two of these titles of the typi cal Egypt ian “sayer” are cited in the “Festal dirge” when it is said, “I have heard the words of Iu - em - hetep and Hartatef. It is said in their sayings ,” som e of which sayings are then quot ed. These two answer to the Horus and Jesus of the Egypt o - gnos tics, which are two names of the same original character that was Egypt ian from the root . The so - called “ Christian eschatology” may be said to have had its origin in the mysteries of Ptah at Memphi s. So far as know n, it was there the doc trine of immortality was first taught ; there that the Son of God was figured in the act of issuing from the mortal mum my as a living spirit. It was likewise there the teacher of the religious mysteries was first impersona ted as the sayer, Iu - em - hetep, who, as Iu the com ing Su, was the son of Ptah. Iu as a form of Tum , proclaims himself to be the Sayer in the Ritual (ch. 82) . H e says: “I hav e com e forth with the tongue of Ptah and the throat of Hathor that I may record the words of my father, Tum , with my mout h which draw eth to itself the spous e of Seb.” That is the mother on earth who was Isis in the Osirian mythos , and Hathor - Ius ā as in the cult of Tum or Atum - Ra. The speaker here is Horus as Iu the com ing Su, or son, who in Egyp tian is Iu - su, or Iusa, the child of Ius ā as, the cons ort of Atum - Ra. This sayer as Iu, the Su or son in one character, is Tum himself as father in the o ther. As Ra the father he is the author of the sayings ; as Iu the son (Iusa) he is the utterer of the sayings “with his mout h” or in person on the earth as the heir of Seb. To the Egyp tians “the words of Tum ” were the teachings of an everlasting gos pel of truth, law, justice and right, “not to be altered is that which Tum hath uttered” (Rit., ch. 78) by the mout h of the sayer, Iu - em - hetep, or by the pen of the writer, Taht - Aan. Thus we can identify Tum or Atum - Ra as the author of the sayings which are to b e spoke n on earth by God the Son. Tum was the earlier name of Atum - Ra, when the character was that of child - Horus, or the infant Tum , and the sayings toge ther with the sayer were pre - Osirian.

Hence this 82nd chapter is the one by which the manes is said to “assum e the form of Ptah” in the cour se of becom ing a pur e and perfect spirit. Upon this line of desce nt, distingui shed from the Osirian, Ptah represented the grandf ather of the gods ; Atum the father, and Iu the Su, the ever - com ing son of Atum at Annu. It was Ptah, the ope ner of the nether - earth, who made the resurrection of the manes pos sible that was act ed in the mysteries of Amenta. And Iu the Su came to say what he had seen and had to tell as witness for the father (Rit., ch. 86) , that is, as the “sayer” to whom the sayings were attribut ed. Hence the speaker tells us that he com es with “the tongue of Pt ah” “and the throat of Hathor ” to record the words of his father Tum with his ow n mout h, or as the sayer who was reborn at Annu as Iusu, or Iusa of Hathor - Ius ā as, she who was great with Iusa, the son of Atum - Ra, and grands on of Ptah. The “sayings ” may be divided and differentiated in two categor ies correspondi ng to the two characters of the doubl e - Horus, the child of twelve years, and Horus the adul t of thirty years; Horus the afflicted one who suffered and died and was bur ied, and Horus who rose again as the demons trator of eternal life in his resurrection from the dead. At first child - Horus was the word - made - flesh as Logo s of the mother. This was H athor - Ius ā as in relation to Atum - Ra (Rit., ch. 82) . Next he was the word - made - truth as sayer for the father and teacher of the greater mysteries. Thus there are two classes of the sayings — thos e of the childhood and thos e of the adul tship; thos e that pertai n to the earth of Seb and thos e that are uttered in Amenta the earth of eternity. It is said in the Ritual that the words of Taht are “written in the two earths,” the earth of Seb or time, and the earth of eternity or Amenta (Renouf and Naville, ch. 183) . So the sayings were uttered by Horus, Tum , Iu, or Jesus, in the doubl e earth of time, and of eternity. It is also said of certain sayings in “Pistis Sophi a” (or Books of the Saviour , 390 , Mead), “Jesus spake these words unt o his disciples in the midst of A menta,” whence they went forth three by three to the four poi nts of heaven to preach the gos pel of the kingdom . This likewise was in the earth of eternity, versus the earth of time. But, whether the god be represented as the heavenly father by Ptah at Memp his, by Atum - Ra at Annu, or by Osiris at Abydos , the infant was Horus or Heru the lord by name, who was the onl y lord as a little child. Iu, Iusu, Iusa, Tum , Aten, Sekari, Iu - em - hetep, are but titles of Horus the lord of the Logi a Kuriaka who became the “S ayer” as the Egypt o - gnostic Jesus, Iu - Su, the ever - com ing Messianic son. Now , amongs t the gods of Egypt that were canoni zed as Christian saints the deity Tum has been conve rted into the Apos tle Thom as. The Gospel according to Thom as is also know n to have existed in several forms, som e of which are yet extant in the Gospels of the Infancy, assum ed to be the childhood of an historic Christ. Hippol ytus cites one of these as a Gospel of the Nasseni. He says they hand dow n an expl icit passage occurring in the G ospel inscribed “according to Thomas,” expressing themselves thus : “He who seeks 891 me (the highe r soul ) will find me in children from seven years old; for there conc ealed I shall, in the four teenth year (or æon) , be made manifest” (Refut. V. 7). This p assage cont ains the doc trine of the doubl e - Horus, the Horus of the incarnation and Horus of the"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"resurrection, or the child - Horus and Horus the adul t. The dua lity of Horus as the word made flesh and the word made truth is also exemplified in the Gospel of T hom as by the boy whos e every word at onc e became a deed (ch. 4). In the introduc tory word to the “New Sayings of Jesus,” found on the site of Oxyr hync hus by Messrs. Grenfell and Hunt , it is said: “These are the (wonde rful) words which Jesus the living (Lor d) spake to . . . and Thomas, and he said unt o (them) everyone that hearkens to these words shall never taste of death” (p. 11) . The wonde rful words, the words of pow er in the Ritual, are the words of Atum - Ra the hol y spirit. The speaker is Horus or Iu the living, he who rises from the grave and doe s not die a second time, or who is the resurrection and the life, that was represented as the first fruit or type of them that slept. He is one of thos e to whom Nut, the mother heaven, has given birth or rebirth (Rit., ch. 1), and this pow er he afterwards conf ers on his four brethren or children that they likewise may raise up the dead (Pyramid Texts, Teta, 270) . It is in this character he says, “I am the living soul ” (Rit., ch. 5). That is, as Horus the lord of t he resurrection from the land of death. “I am he that com eth forth.” “I ope n all the paths in heaven and on earth” (ch. 9). “That has been given to me which endur eth amidst all ove rthrow ” (ch. 10) . Thus Horus is the demons trator of a resurrection for the h um an soul in a mystery of Amenta. He says, “I am he who establishes you for eternity.” “I am he who dieth not a second time” (ch. 42). “I am he whos e orbits are of old; my soul is divine, it is the eternal Force” (ch. 85) . “It is I who proceed from Tum ” — th e father of a soul that is immortal. An original Egypt ian sour ce for the Gospels of the Infancy is recogni zable in the Ritual. In his incarnation Horus, or Iu the Su, indi cates that he “disrobe s himself” to “reveal himself” when he “presents himself to th e earth” (ch. 71) . In his birth he says, “I am the babe” bor n as the conne cting link betwixt earth and heaven, and as the one who doe s not die the second death (ch. 42). He issues from the disc or from the egg. He is pur sued by the Herrut - reptile, but , as he says, his egg remains unpi erced by the destroye r. He escapes from the slaught er of the innoc ents or the Hamemmat in Suten - Khen. On entering the earth - life Horus know s it to be in accordance with his lot that he shoul d suffer death or com e to an end and be no more (Rit., ch. 8). He also know s that he is a living soul . As such he has that within which surviveth all ove rthrow ; even though he may be bur ied in the deep, dark grave, he will not be anni hilated there. He will rise again (ch. 10 and ch. 30 A ). But before quot ing further what Horus says, we cite a few more of the Logoi which tell us what Horus is. And what Horus is in the Osirian religion the same was the Egypt ian Jesus in the cult of Atum - Ra, and Iu - em - hetep still earlier in the mysteries of Memphi s and the cult of Ptah. Apart from the Osirian dyna sty of deities, the two chief divine 892 persona ges in the Ritual are Atum - Ra and Atum - Horus, as Huhi the eternal father, and Iu the ever - com ing Messianic son, who as the Su is Iusu, the Egyp tian Jesus. Now Tum , or Atum - Ra the inspiring spirit, was the author of the sayings in the Ritual which he gave to Horus the Iu - su or com ing son, as Sayer, for him to utter to men and manes in the two characters of the infant Horus and Horus the adul t. Tum as Egypt ia n, is the earlier form of Atum ’s name; and in the Greek inscriptions Tum (or Atum ) is called Tom os. We also find that the twin - totality of Tum is registered in the name of “Thom as called Didym us”;"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Thom as the twin being equi valent in name to the character o f the twofold Tum . From this we infer that the apoc rypha l Gospel of the Infancy assigne d to Thom as is, or was, based upon the Egyp tian Gospel of Tum . This dua lity may also expl ain the relations hip of Jesus to Thom as in the “sayings ” or Logoi , recently reco vered from the mounds of Oxyr hync hus , which are called “the sayings of Jesus,” who is described as the Lord, and the living one . Now Tum , in the Ritual, is pre - eminently “the lord.” In one chapter (79) he is addr essed as “the lord of heaven,” “the lord of life,” “the lord of all creatures,” “the lord of all.” Thus the Ritual cont ains “the sayings of the lord.” The Hebrew formula “thus saith the lord” had been anticipated in the Ritual by the “so saith Tum ” whos e word is “not to be altered” (Ritual, ch. 78) . As Egyp tian, Tum is the one god called “the living. ” And the sayings are the words which Jesus “the living” is said to have spoke n to Thom as, the son Iu here being given the foremost pos ition of the two. The sayings of the lord, in the Ritual, then, are the sayings spoke n by Tum the father to Iusa the son, who utters them to men on earth and to the manes in Amenta. It is as Atum - Horus that the son says, “I am the bright one in glory whom Tum himself brought into being, who hath made and glorified and hono ured thos e who are to be with him,” as his follow ers or his children (Rit., ch. 78) . It is the same speaker who says, “I have com e upon this earth and I take pos session of it with my two feet. I am Tum , and I com e from my ow n place.” That is as Iusa the ma nifesting son. Thus the sayings of Horus Iu - em - hetep can be traced to Tum as Ra the inspiring spirit and to Horus as the sayer in the Ritual. “Tum ” in Egypt ian was also a name for the mythical child as the inarticulate one , the little Tum , who survives in various count ries. Tom Thum b and little Thum bki n of our nur sery tales. We also cons ider that this was the Tum who passed into Indi a as the “historic” Thom as and who is claimed by Christians to have been the Apos tle of that name. The god Tum is there ident ifiable in half - a - doz en features assigne d to the Apos tle or Saint Thom as. For one thing he is the patron of bui lders and architects, and his sym bol is the mason’ s squa re. He is reput ed to have bui lt a supe rb palace in heaven for the poor of earth. Tum surv ives by name as the Thoma of the Indi an Christians on a peninsula of the Indus this side of the gul f: also in Cochin and beyond. The so - called Christians of Indi a who are freque ntly suppos ed to have been the follow ers of an historic Thom as have their ow n t radition which is 893 bot h congr uous and expl icable. They say that “a certain hol y man called Mar - Thom e, a Syrian, first came to them with a num ber of beasts from Syria and Egypt ” (Calmet, Thom as). That is with the hierogl yphi c signs . Thome we take to be the Egypt ian god , Tum . The Mar or Mer, as the surname of the hol y man, is an Egypt ian title for a supe rintende nt. The “Mer - Tetu” was the supe rintende nt of books , and also the roya l mage in one person. Thus read “Mar - Thom e” was one of the Egypt ian Magi or Rekhi as the supe rintende nt of a college or body of priests who went to Indi a from Syria as missiona ries and who prom ulgated the worship of Tum as God the Father, and Iusa as the son in the religion of Annu. This dua l character of Tum as the father and Iu the Su or son, equa l to Jesus, will enable us to identify the child - Jesus in the Gospel of Thom as and that Gospel itself as a"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"form of the Egypt ian Gospel. This is one of the most ancient of the Gospels of the Infancy called Apoc rypha l, the origin and true signi ficance of which are hitherto unknow n. These have been denounc ed as idle tales, fool ish traditions : pious frauds , disgui sed heresy, anti - evange lical representations and fables forged to suppl y an account of “Our Lord’s History,” in that infancy which the evange lists have perforce om itted. The representations , how ever, are anti - evange lical; hence they are suppos ed to favou r Docetism: in other words, they are non - historical. As already demons trated, the great god Tum was the father in one character, and Iu or Horus in the other; he is the divine son who is Iu - em - hetep the Egypt ian Jesus. Tum is Tomas or Thom as in Greek, and the Gospel of Tom as in Greek is the Gospel of Tum as Egypt ian. Also Tum the father and Iu the son will show why the history of the i nfancy shoul d be related of a mythical Jesus in the Gospel of Tum or Thom as, and in relation to Thom as. Thus we can identify Tum as the author of the sayings which are to be spoke n by Iu - em - hetep, in the person of God the Son. Tum was the earlier name of A tum - Ra, when the character was that of child - Horus, or the infant Tum , and the sayings toge ther with the sayer were pre - Osirian. In other words, the “sayer” is Iu - em - hetep, the prince of peace in the cult of On, whom we trace back to the time of Ptah as th e Egypt ian Jesus. Hence this chapter is the one by which the manes is said to “assum e the form of Ptah” in the cour se of being spiritualized. In one of the sayings ascribed to Jesus he says, “Com e unt o me, all ye that labou r and are heavy - laden, and I will give you rest” (Matt. XI. 28) . This had then becom e “one of the sayings .” But the sayer himself had been persona lized or typi fied in earlier ages as Iu - em - hetep at Memphi s, and again at On, and later still at Alexandr ia. And Iu - em - hetep the bringe r of pea ce by name was the giver of rest by nature as the Egypt ian Jesus; he who settled the matter of immortality in his resurrection from the tom b. As we have already seen, a tap - root of the Jesus legend in the eschatologi cal pha se can be traced in the Egypt ian Ritual to the time and to the cult of Ptah at Memphi s (Rit., ch. 82) . Ptah was the earliest form of an eternal father manifesting in the person of an ever - com ing son, who, as the com ing one , was Iu, or Iu - em - hetep, he who com es with peace. Hence we derive the name or title of the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus from Iu - Su, or Iusa, the com ing son. Inde ed, the que stion asked by the messenge rs of John in the Gospel, 894 art thou he that shoul d com e, or must we look for anot her? is equi valent to asking “art thou Iu - em - hetep, he who com es with peace as manifestor for the father?” It is also said of Jesus that he had com passion on the peopl e “because they were as sheep without a shephe rd.” And this has been looke d upon as one of the founda tiona l pillars of the history, a nd proof pos itive that he was the original Good Shephe rd. But Horus had long been extant as the good shephe rd in the mythos , the eschatology, and the iconogr aphy of Egypt . Again, it is said of Jesus (Matt. VII. 29) , that he taught the multitude as one havi ng authority, and not as their scribes. So was it with Horus, who claims that author ity to teach had been divinely delegated to him as the belove d son of God the Father. Hence the sayings , “I have com e forth with the tongue of Ptah and the throat of Hathor that I may record the words of my father Tum with my mout h” (Rit., ch. 82) . “I am arrayed and equi ppe d with thy words of pow er, O Ra” (ch. 32) . “I utter his"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"words to the men of the present generation, and I repeat his words to him who is deprived of breat h” as the manes in Amenta (ch. 38). It was the work of Horus to exalt the father at all times and in every place. He is exalted as Un - Nefer, the good being who is the one alone that is good , perfect and uni que . The same mission is assigne d to the Gospel - J esus. Hence the saying, “Why callest thou me good? None is good save one , even God alone . . . the Father alone ” (Mark X. 18), who represents the same Good Being Un - Nefer as did Osiris. This dua lity of the Deity as father and son is also manifest in the sa ying, “Whos oever shall speak a word against the Son of Man it shall be forgiven him, but whos oever shall speak against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven him” (Matt. XII. 32) . That is said in exaltation of the father in heaven who was the hol y spirit represented by the son on earth or in Amenta. The Ritual likewise prove s that Seb, the god of earth and foster - father of Horus, when he was the child of the virgin mother onl y, is the prototype or original of Joseph. Horus says that as the heir of Seb, fr om whom he issued, he was suckled at the breast of Isis, the spous e of Seb, who gave him his theopha nies (Rit., ch. 82). Horus on earth lies dow n to embrace the old man who keeps the light of earth, and who is Seb the earth - father (Rit., ch. 84) . Horus is lord of the staircase or mount of rebirth in heaven. In his first adve nt as the heir of Seb Horus says, “I am com e as a mum mied one ” (that is, in his embodi ment when made flesh, the Hamemmat being the unm ummied one s) (Rit., ch. 9). “I com e before you and m ake my appe arance as that god in the form of a man who liveth as a god” — otherwise stated, as Iusu the son of Atum - Ra (ch. 79). “I repeat the acclamations at my success on being declared the heir of Seb” (Seb was the father on earth (ch. 82) , Osiris in Amen ta, Ra in heaven). “I descend to the earth of Seb and put a stop to evil” as the bringe r of peace, plenty, and good will on earth. “I shine forth from the egg which is in the uns een world” (ch. 22) . “Lo, I bring this my word of pow er” from out the silence in which the gods originated. “I am arrayed and equi ppe d with thy words of pow er, O Ra” (ch. 24, 32). “I utter his words to the living and to thos e who are deprived of breath. I am Horus, prince of eternity” (ch. 42) . “I am yesterday, to - day, and to - morrow ” 895 (ch. 64). “I am” (or, am I not) “the bul l of the sacrificial herd. Are not the mortuary gifts upon me, and the supe rnal pow ers?” (ch. 105 ). “Witness of Eternity is my name, the persistent traveller on the highw ays of heaven. I am the everlasting on e, I am Horus, who steppe th onw ards through eternity.” But Horus in the Ritual is chiefly the son of God the Father in heaven, and the subj ect - matter is mainly pos t - resurrectional . After the life with Seb on earth, Horus is rebor n in the earth of eternity for the heaven of eternity (78, 25) . He is divinized with the flesh or subs tance of god (ch. 78) . By means of Horus, his manifestor, Osiris is said to re - live. Horus is Osiris in his rebirth. Horus rises as a god and is visible to the gods (or divine spir its) (79) in his resurrection. Horus rises as the living soul of Ra in heaven (127 ). Horus strikes the wakers in their cells or coffins for the resurrection of the manes in Amenta (ch. 84) . “I raise myself up, I renew myself, I grow young again” (ch. 43) . “Not men or gods ; or the glorified one s, or the damned, can inflict any injury on me” (ch. 42) . “I do not die a second time in the nether - world” (ch. 44). “I am the victorious one ” (ch. 47) . “I am seized (in pos session) of the two earths” (ch. 50) . “There hath been assigne d to me eternity withou t end. Lo, I am"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"the heir of endl ess time and my attribute is eternity” (ch. 62). “I, even I, am he who know eth the paths of heaven. Its breezes blow upo n me. I adva nce whithersoever there lieth a wreck in the field o f eternity, and I pilot myself tow ards the darkne ss and the sufferings of the deceased one s of Osiris” (ch. 78) , as the deliverer or saviour of soul s whos e supr eme conc ern and obj ect is to be saved from the second death in Amenta by earning and attaining t he life of the soul that is eternal. “It is I, even I, who am Horus in glory. I am the lord of light and I adva nce to the goal of heaven.” Jesus says, “I go unt o him that sent me” (John VII. 33) . “I know whence I came and whither I go” (John VIII. 14) . “I go to prepare a place for you .” “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one com eth to the Father but through me” (John XIV. 6). “I go unt o the Father” (XIV. 12) . But there is not hing so striking in the Gospel as this image of Horus the saviour in the bo at of soul s who steers his ow n bark that tosses in distressful agitation ove r the water, whilst he carries rescue wheresoever there has been a wreck amongs t the suffering and deceased one s of his father Osiris. Horus was the sole one of the seven great sp irits born of the mother who was chos en to becom e the onl y - begot ten son of God the Father when he rose up from the dead. This is he who says in the Ritual, “I am the bright one in glory, whom Atum - Ra hat h called into being, and my origin is from the appl e of his eye. Verily before Isis was, I grew up and waxed old, and was honour ed beyon d thos e who were with me in glory” (Rit., ch. 78, Renouf ). Thos e who were with him in glory were the seven great spirits, the Khut i or glorious one s. Amongs t these, Horus be came the divine heir of all things , the son of God who claims to have existed before Isis his mother, when speaking as manifestor for the hol y spirit. This is the son and heir of God who is described in the Epistle to the Hebrews as the “appoi nted heir of all things , through whom also he made the worlds.” 896 He was thus exalted above the ange ls or great spirits through “having becom e by so much better than the ange ls” and by inhe riting a more excellent name than they. “For unt o which of the ange ls said h e at any time, thou art my son? ” Horus exalts his father in every place; “associating himself with the two divine sisters, Isis and Nepht hys ,” as his two mothers. It is Taht - Ani who speaks by him the favour able incantations which issue from his heart throu gh his mout h. Horus ove rthrow s the serpent Apap daily for Ra. Horus uni tes bot h Osiris and Ra in one triune persona lity, or trinity in uni ty. The sayer persona lized as son of God and utterer of the logi a in the Ritual says: “I am the one proceeding from t he one , the son from a father, the father from the son” (Sarcopha gus of Seti I). Jesus is credited with having the magical pow er of being know n or unknow n, seen or uns een at will. When the Jews took up stone s to cast at him he was sudde nly invi sible, even in their midst (John VIII. 59) . Again, whilst uttering the sayings to the multitude , he was hidde n from them (John XII. 36) . When risen bodi ly, he is the unknow n one to Mary at the sepul chre. He is also the unknow n one to the disciples on the way to Emmaus (Luke XXIV). This character, like all the rest, is according to copy suppl ied by the Ritual. “I am he,” says Horus, “who com eth forth and proceedeth, and whos e name is unknow n to men” (ch. 42) . The Osiris has a word of pow er by means of which he can conc e al or manifest himself. He says: “I am in pos session of that word of"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"pow er which is the most pot ent one in my body here; and by means of it I make myself either know n or unk now n” (Renouf , ch. 110) , which is equi valent to becom ing visible or invi sible at wi ll. “Before the feast of the Passove r, Jesus, know ing that his hour was com e that he shoul d depart out of this world unt o the Father, having love d his ow n which were in the world, he love d them unt o the end” (John XIII. 1). The end is here indi cated by th e feast of the Passove r and the last suppe r. In the parallel scene Horus says: “I have com e to an end for the lord of heaven, I rest at the table of my father Osiris” (Rit., ch. 70). This immediately precedes his piercing the veil of the tabernacle and com ing forth as the divine hawk of soul (Rit., 70 - 71, Renouf ). Horus when addr essing Ra the father on behalf of the four brethren, his follow ers, says, “Be they with thee so that they may be with me” (Rit., ch. 113) . Jesus says of his follow ers, “Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me that they may be one even as we are.” “I will that where I am they also may be with me” (John XVII. 11, 12, 24) . In the same passage of the Ritual Sut is referred to as invoki ng the pow ers of Nekhe n. In the s ame passage of the Gospel it is “the son of perdition.” In this way the canoni cal Gospels can be show n to be a collection of sayings from the Egypt ian mythos and eschatology. The original likeness is som ewhat defeatured at times in the process, but suffic ient remains in the Ritual for the pur pos e of com parison and reclamation. When Horus returns to his father with his work accom plished on earth and in Amenta he greets Osiris in a “discour se to his father.” In forty addr esses he enum erates what he has done for the suppor t and assistance of Osiris in the earth of Seb. Each line com mences with 897 the formula, “Hail, Osiris, I am thy son Horus. I have com e!” Amongs t other of the assistances he says, “I have suppor ted thee. I have struck thine enemies dead. I have brought the com panions of Sut to thee in chains. I have cultivated thy fields. I have watered thy grounds . I have strengt hened thine existence upon the earth. I have given thee thy soul , thy strengt h, thy pow er. I have given thee thy victory. I have anoi nted thee with the offerings of hol y oil.” This last in sign - langua ge is, I have given thee the glory (Renouf and Naville, Rit., ch. 173) . This we parallel with the sixteenth chapter of John, in which the pos ition and character of Jesus are the same wi th thos e of Horus, and in which Jesus addr esses the father at the end of his career. “I have com e to thee,” says Horus to Osiris. “Now I com e to thee,” says Jesus to the Father. “Father, the hour is com e; glorify thy son that the son may glorify thee.” “I glorified thee on earth, having accom plished the work which thou hast given me to do. And now , O Father, glorify thou me with thine ow n self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. I manifested thy name unt o the men whom thou gavest me o ut of the world. I am no more in the world. But now I com e to thee. I kept them in thy name, which thou hast given me. I gua rded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition” (XVII. 5 - 12) . The glory of God the father was reflected by the sa cred oil upon the face of Horus the anoi nted son, which was a sign of his divinity. This was “the glory as of the onl y - begot ten from the father” who was Horus in spirit, Horus the adul t, the anoi nted one with the father, and"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"thus the representative type of a soul of life that is eternal and attainable by all as in the onl y - belove d son. It is an utterance of the truth that is eternal to say that Horus as the son of God had previous ly been all the Gospel Jesus is made to say he is, or is to becom e. Horus and the father were one . Jesus says, “I and my Father are one.” “He that seeth me, seeth him that sent me” (John XII. 45). Horus is the father seen in the son (Rit., 115) . Jesus claims to be the son in whom the father is revealed. Horus was the light of the w orld, the light that is represented by the sym bol ical eye, the sign of salvation. Jesus is made to declare that he is the light of the world. Horus was the way, the truth, the life, by name and in person. Jesus is made to assert that he is the way, the tru th, and the life. Horus was the plant, the shoot , the natzer. Jesus is made to say, “I am the true vine.” The deceased says, “I spring up as a plant” (Rit., 83, 1). The deceased, in the character of Horus, or one with him by assimilation, also makes these claims for himself. Hence the sayings — the sayings which are repeated in the Gospels, more especially in the Gospel according to John= Aan. To parallel a few of the sayings in the Gospels with those of the Ritual: In the Gospel according to John, Jesus says of himself, “I am the bread of life” (VI. 35) , “I am the light of the world” (VIII. 12), “I am the door of the sheep” (X. 7), “I am the good shephe rd” (X. 11), “I am the resurrection and the life” (XI. 25), “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (XIV. 6), “I am the true vine” (XV. 1). And Horus was the original in all seven characters. Horus was the bread of life, also the divine corn from which the bread of life was made (Rit., ch. 83) . Horus was the good shephe rd who carries the crook upon his shoul der. 898 Horus was the door of entrance into Amenta, which none but he coul d ope n. Horus was the resurrection and the life. He carries the two sym bol s of resurrection and of life eternal, the hare - headed sceptre, and the Ankh - key in his hands . Horus was the w ay. His name is written with the sign of the road (Heru). Horus was the true vine, as the branch of Osiris, who is himself the vine in person. Now the original of all these identifiable characters coul d occur but onc e, and that prototype was Horus, or Jesu s in the cult of Atum - Ra. Horus says, “It is I who traverse the heaven. I go round the Sekhe t - Aarru (the Elysian fields). Eternity has been assigne d to me without end. Lo! I am the heir of endl ess time, and my attribut e is eternity” (Ritual, ch. 62) . Jesus says, “I am com e dow n from heaven. For this is the will of the Father that every one who behol deth the son and believeth in him shoul d have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.” He, too, claims to be the lord of eternity. When Horus is “ lifted up” to becom e glorified and is “Horus in his glory” (ch. 78) , “master of his diadem,” he says, “I raise myself up.” Then he adds , “I stoop upon the Atit - bark that I may reach and raise to me thos e who are in their circles, and who bow dow n before me ” as his worshippe rs (ch. 77) . “And I,” says Jesus, “if I be lifted up out of the earth (as Horus was lifted up from out the nether - world), will draw all men after me” (John XII. 32, 33) . Horus says, “I ope n the Tuat that I may drive away the darkne ss.” Je sus says, “I am com e a light into the world.” Horus says, “I am equi ppe d with thy words of pow er, O Ra” (the father in heaven) (ch. 32) , “and repeat them to thos e who are deprived of breath” (ch. 38) . These were the words of the father in heaven. Jesus say s, “The Father which sent me, he hath given me a"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"com mandm ent, what I shoul d say and what I shoul d speak. The things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unt o me, so I speak” (John XII. 49, 50) . “The word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me”(John XIV. 24) . Horus repeated to his follow ers that which his father Osiris had said to him in the early time (Rit., 78) . Jesus says, “As the Father taught me, I speak these things ” (John VIII. 28) . “All things that I heard from my Fa ther I have made know n unto you” (John XV. 15). Horus com es on earth to repor t what he has know n and heard and seen and handl ed with the father. “I have touc hed with my two hands the heart of Osiris.” “That which I went to ascertain I have com e to tell.” “ I know the mysterious paths and the gates of Aarru (or Paradise) from whence I com e. Here am I, and I com e that I may ove rthrow mine adve rsaries on earth, though my dead body be buried” (Renouf , ch. 86) . Horus eats the bread of Seb on earth, but he teache s the manes in Amenta to pray for the bread of heaven. Let him ask for food from the Lord, who is ove r all (ch. 78). In this we have the germ of the Lord’s Prayer addressed to “our Father in heaven” for “our daily bread”: Ra being the heavenly father of Ho rus and the suppl ier of food to soul s; the daily giver of eternal life, that was represented by the typi cal seven loaves of plenty. There is a prayer in the Ritual (ch. 71) which ope ns with an addr ess to the Lord of Heaven who “reveals himself, who derobe s himself, and presents himself to the earth” in the person of Horus his son, the divine hawk or soul that 899 pierces through the veil of the tabernacle. It is here referred to for the refrain which occurs seven times ove r — “May his will tow ard me be done by the Lord of the one face,” that is, by the one and onl y God who is the father in heaven, he who “revealed himself, who disrobe d himself, and presented himself to the earth” (Renouf , ch. 71) in the person of his belove d son. Horus who com es from heaven says, “I am the food which perisheth not , in my name of the self - originating force” (Rit., ch. 85) . Jesus says, “I am the bread of life. This is the bread which com eth dow n out of heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die. I am the living bread which came dow n out of heaven” (John VI. 48 - 51). Horus was not onl y the bread of life derived from heaven and the produc er of bread in the character of Amsu the hus bandm an; he also gave his flesh for food and his blood for drink. This, how ever, was not in the ca nni bal form of hum an flesh and blood, but as the typi cal calf or the lamb. Jesus says, “The bread which I will give is my flesh.” “Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood ye have not life in you rselves,” that is, in the hum an form, wh ich is proclaimed to be the bread which came dow n out of heaven (John VI. 53, 58). Horus says, “I am the pos sessor of bread in Annu. I have bread in heaven with Ra” (ch. 53 A ). “There are seven loaves in heaven at Annu with Ra” (ch. 53 B ). Ra is the father i n heaven. He is the provi der of the bread of life that is given by the son, and by Jesus in the Gospel. Jesus says, “My Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven. For the bread of God is that which com eth dow n out of heaven, and giveth life unt o the w orld,” that is, in the person of Jesus or of Horus. “Jesus said unt o them, I am the bread of life” (John VI. 32 - 35) . Jesus, like Horus, is the giver of the water of life which likewise com eth from the Father (John IV. 10 and VII. 37) . “Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him com e unt o"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water” (John VII. 37, 38) . In passing, we may n otice that the great feast corresponds to the Uaka festival by which the return of the water of life in the inunda tion was celebrated; and that Osiris was the lord of the water as well as of the wine. Moreove r, the miracle of conve rting water into wine is very simply illustrated by the picture of Osiris as the vine and also as the water of renewal in which the vine springs out of the water of life that issues from beneath his throne . On the ground of natural fact, Osiris was the water of life to the land of Egypt in the inunda tion of the Nile. He was ador ed in the temple of Isis at Philæ as “Osiris of the mysteries, who springs from the returning waters.” He was the water of life to the soul s in Amenta; and in the eschatology Osiris is the water of life in H etep, the paradise of peace, to spirits perfected. In the Ritual, Horus is the son of God through whom is given the water that com eth from the father, which is called the Ru of Osiris, the divine liqui d that flow s from him as the ichor of life. Horus speak s of que nching his thirst with the drops (the Ru) of his father Osiris. So Jesus draws and drinks and gives drink from the well of living water which is the father’s; not the well of Jacob (John IV. 10, 15) , but a well of water springi ng up unt o eternal li fe. 900 Again and again, the status and character of Jesus as the Sayer in the Gospels are onl y to be determined by the mythical or mystical relations hip. “Before Abraham was, I am,” is one of the sayings ascribed to the suppos ed historical Christ. Abra ham is of cour se referred to as the typi cal proge nitor of the Jews. So in the Gospel of Thom as, or Tum , the child - Jesus says to his earth - father Joseph, “It is enough for thee to see me, not to touc h me. For thou know est not who I am. If thou kne west thou woul dst not grieve me. And although I am now with thee I was made before thee” (ch. 5). The son who existed before the father claims an immense antiqui ty, as a character entirely mythical, but if the statement were made a hundr ed times ove r in the märchen the meaning woul d be the same. It is a saying of the Divine Child who came into being earlier than God the Father as the offspring of the Virgin Mother who is Jesus the fatherless Child of Mary in the Gospels, and of Neith or Ius ā as in the Ritual. Joseph also plays the part of Seb, the father, to Horus on earth. “Seb giveth me his theopha nies,” says Horus, but “more pow erful am I than the lord of time (Seb), I am the author and the master of endl ess years” (Rit., ch. 82) as an ima ge of the Eternal. In the inscription of Hatshepsu, the child - Horus is called “the elder of his mother’s hus band. ” That is, he was older than Osiris, who became the father according to the later sociology (Obelisk of Karnak, l. 4). Such is the sole ground of origin upon which the father can be later than the son whether his name is Atum , Osiris or Abraham. The sayings invol ve a sayer who became the typi cal teacher in person as Horus in the Osirian cult and Iu - em - hetep in the religion of Atum - Ra, or Iao of the Egypt o - gnos tics in the Pistis Sophi a. These are mentione d in the texts as the divine enunc iators of the “sayings .” Each of them is a form of the sayer, word, logos , announc er, or revealer in person, precisely the same as the Jesus of the Gospels, whet her Apoc rypha l, Egyp to - gnos tic or Canoni cal. The elder Horus was the virgin’s child; he imaged the soul in matter, or, the body - soul in the life on earth. He was the teacher of the lesser mysteries in"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"the mythol ogy. He was solar; hence the leader of that g lorious com pany of the twelve now statione d in the zodi ac as row ers of the bark for millions of years. The primary twelve were the great gods of Egypt twenty thous and years ago as the twelve pow ers that row ed the solar bark for Ra around the circle of the zodi acal signs . They became the Æons of the gnos tics, twelve in num ber. As preservers of the light , they were twelve teachers in mythol ogy, twelve follow ers of Horus who are the twelve apos tles or disciples of the Egypt o - gnos tic Christ; the seven and five being groupe d toge ther to cons titute the twelve. At his second com ing when Horus of the resurrection rose again as a spirit in the image of the hol y ghos t — he became the teacher of the greater mysteries to the twelve who likewise had attained the status of spirits in the eschatology, and who were now the twelve to whom twelve throne s were prom ised in the heaven of eternity. Horus the word in person was the sayer to whom the sayings were assigne d. Hence the “sayings ,” attribut ed to Iu - em - hetep and Hartatef in Egypt : the one as child of the mother; the other as son 901 of the father who wore the Atef - crow n of Atum - Ra. Now this mystical “word” of the mother, and the word - made - truth in Har - Mat - Kheru are bot h appa rent in the ope ning chapter of the Gospel accor ding to John. “In the beginni ng was the word,” he says; as it had been in Iu - em - hetep, or child - Horus. “And the word became flesh,” which it did in the virgin - blood of the immaculate Isis or of Hathor - Ius ā as. The doc trine of the second Horus follow s, but is inserted parenthetically. “And we beheld his glory; glory as of the onl y begot ten from the father.” But the Jesus of the genui ne legend was not yet begot ten by or from the father. He was begot ten or chr istified in his baptism. Matthew has it that when Jesus was baptized he went up straight way from the water; and lo the heavens were ope ned unt o him; and lo a voi ce out of the heavens, saying, This is my belove d son (ch. III. 16, 17) . In the original transf ormation scene this occurred when the child of the mother made his change into the belove d son of God the father at the time of the baptism in the Osirian mystery of Tattu (Rit., ch. 17). It was in his resurrection from the dead, here represented by the ri sing from the water, and becom ing bird - headed as a spirit, that Horus became the belove d son of the father (Rit., ch. 9). John then proceeds to describe the transformation of Jesus in his baptism when “the spirit descende d as a dove out of heaven, and it a bode upon him,” which change had already taken place before the glory of the father coul d have been visible in the person of the son. Now , this word that was in the beginni ng had already manifested as the “sayer” of the sayings in the Ritual. This is he wh o says, “I have com e forth with the tongue of Ptah and the throat of Hathor (Ius ā as) that I may record the words of my father Atum with my mout h.” That is, as the utterer of the “sayings ” which were ascribed to the Egypt ian Jesus as Iu - em - hetep, the son of Hathor - Ius ā as and Atum - Ra. We have no need to go further back for the beginni ng of the Word, as utterer of the sayings . The canoni cal Gospels are based upon the “sayings ” of Jesus; the Jesus that we claim to have been the son of Atum at On; genealogi cally , the grands on of Ptah at Memphi s, and the author of the books of wisdom attribut ed to him as the Jesus of the Apoc rypha , and Gospels of the Infancy."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":" Enough has been cited to show that the revelation ascribed to Jesus, the Christ of the canoni cal Gospels, had been previous ly publ ished in the Ritual of the resurrection and uttered by Iu the Su of Atum - Ra (Iusa=Jesus or Tum=Thom as), who was and is and ever will be the Egypt ian Jesus inde pende ntly of any persona l historical character. The Egypt ian Ritual con tains the “sayings ” or the words of wisdom that were attribut ed to Ra the inspiring hol y spirit. As god the father this was Tum (or Thom as). The utterer of the “sayings ” “with his mout h” was god the son, Iu (or Iu - em - hetep) the Su (son) who was Iu - Su, the ever - com ing son in the religion of Annu , and Iusu when rende red through the Greek is Ihsoàj or Jesus. A large part of the Egypt ian Book of the Dead consists of “sayings .” The forty - second chapter cont ains at least fifty sayings uttered by Horus in person respecting himself, his father and his work 902 of salvation. These are the sayings of Horus, or of the Osiris by whom they are repeated in character. And as Horus the divine word in person is the Lord whos e name of Heru signi fies the Lord, these sayings of Horus are the Logi a Kuriaka; assuredly the oldest in the world, which we have now traced to Iu - em - hetep, the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus as the sayer for Atum - Ra. These might be called the sayings of Ra or Horus, of Tum or Thom as, of Iu or Iu - em - hetep, of Aan , Taht or Hermes. But above all other names or titles they were know n as the words of Mati. Also, the Gospel of the Egypt ians, represented by the Ritual, was the Gospel according to Mati (or Matiu, with the U, inhe rent). And as Mati was inculcated by mean s of the sayings , the sayings in the Ritual are the sayings of Mati as the words of truth, justice, law, and right fulness, and the revelation of the resurrection. In Dr. Birch’s translation of “the fune ral Ritual” he has given the word “Mati” as a title of Taht - Aan the divine scribe; and from this title the present writer deduc ed the names of Matthias and Matthew, as the true reckone r, the just reckone r, and keeper of the tablets for Maati in the hall of Maat. Taht - Aan might be designa ted Mati. But, whether we take the word Mati as a prope r name or title of the scribe Taht (whether called Hermes, Aan or Mati), he was the recorder of the sayings or Logi a Kuriaka in the Ritual. But even if we do not take the name of Mati to be a title of Tehut i, whence the nam es of Matthias and Matthew, the character remains. Taht was the scribe in the Maat or judgm ent - hall, also the recorder of the sayings that were given by the Father in Heaven to be uttered by Horus, and written dow n by the finge rs of Taht. Now , according to the often - quot ed testimony of Papias, recorded in his last “com mentary” on the “sayings of the Lord,” the basis of the canoni cal Gospels was laid in a collection of sayings that were attribut ed to “The Lord.” He tells us that Matthew wrote the sayings in the Hebrew dialect, and every one interpreted them as best he was able. This was the current hearsay on the subj ect as repor ted by Papias, Bishop of Hierapol is. And here we might repeat, in passing, that the sayings of Horus the lord in the Ritual were col lected and written dow n by Taht - Mati the scribe, and that Matthew, or Matthias, corresponds to Mati bot h in character and by name. We have no further use for the statement beyond not ing that the extant Gospel of Matthew was evidently founde d on a collectio n of thos e “wise sayings , dark sentences and parables” that cons tituted the wisdom of the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus, one late version of which has"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"been preserved in the Book of Ecclesiasticus, entitled “the wisdom of Jesus.” The present writer has previous ly su gge sted that the “sayings ” collected by Matthew, which Papias had heard of as the sour ce of the Christian Gospels, were a form of the sayings of Mati collected from the papyr i of the Ritual. The Cathol ic Christians were sorely troubl ed about the Egypt o - gno stic Gospels in pos session of the “heretics” when they came to hear of them. These are especially associated with the name of Valentinus , an Egypt ian gnos tic, who came with these Egypt o - gnos tic Gospels from Alexandr ia, and to whom Pistis Sophi a and the “Go spel of Truth” have been attribut ed. The “Gospel of Truth,” know n to the Valentinian gnos tics as Egypt ian, is 903 the Gospel of Mati, or a collection of the sayings of Mati=Matthew. The Logi a of Matthias was the authentic gos pel of the Carpoc ratean gnos t ics. Clement of Alexandr ia quot es from the “Traditions of Matthias” two sayings which are not to be found in the canoni cal Matthew. This prove s the existence of other sayings , oracles and divine words than the canoni cal in the time of Clement, which were a ssigne d to Matthias=Mati. These sayings and traditions were acknow ledge d as genui ne by the gnos tic follow ers of Carpoc rates, Valentinus and Basilides, who never did acknow ledge any historical founde r, and whos e Christ was the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus — he who wa s the utterer of the sayings and traditions first written dow n by the divine scribe Taht - Aan= John; or Taht - Mati=Matthew. In writing his Gospel, Basilides appe aled to a secret tradition which he had received from Matthias; and Hippol ytus reports that this secret tradition was derived by Matthias dur ing his private intercour se with the Saviour . But the gnos tics never did acknow ledge any historic saviour . Their Christ was Horus, or the non - historical Jesus, and therefore the private intercour se of Matthias wi th the Saviour was that of Mati with Horus the Christ of the Ritual which cont ains the history of that intercourse. We are told that it was after his Resurrection that Christ revealed the true gnos is to Peter, John and James. (Clem. Alex. Eusebius, H. E. 2, 1). But it was onl y the spiritual Horus or Christ that coul d reveal the true gnos is, which is here adm itted versus the historic persona ge. This revelation is pos t - resurrectiona l, the same as with the gnos tic Jesus in the Pistis Sophi a who expounds the m ysteries to his twelve apos tles on Mount Olivet after he has risen from the dead. The “Manifestation of Truth” is the title of the great work of Marcus the gnos tic in the third century. The lost work of Celsus was the Word of Truth or Logos Alethea. In the se instances the gos pel is that of truth, the word of truth; the true gos pel. And the gos pel of Mati, we repeat, is equi valent to the gos pel or the sayings according to Matthew which had been heard of by Papias as the nuc lei of the canoni cal Gospels. Epiph anius, in speaking of the “Sabelian Heretics,” says, “The whol e of their errors and the main strengt h of their heterodoxy they derive from som e apoc rypha l books , but principally from that which is called the Gospel of the Egyptians (which is a name som e ha ve given to it) for in that many things are propos ed in a hidde n, mysteriou s manne r as by our Sav iour ” (Ad. Haeres, 26, 2), just as they are in the sayings of the Ritual, the sayings of Hartatef, Iu - em - hetep or the sayings of Jesus. In his tirade against g nos ticism Augus tine echoe s the name of Mati (for truth) and show s its twofold nature in a peculiar way as “The Truth and Truth.” He says of the gnos tics: “They used"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"to repeat ‘Truth and Truth,’ for thus did they repeat her name to me, but she was now here a mongs t them; for they spoke false things , not onl y conc erning thee who art the Truth in Truth, but even conc erning the elements of this world of our s, thy creation; conc erning which even the phi losophe rs, who declared what is true, I ought to have slight ed for love of thee, O my father, the supr eme God, the beauty of all things beautiful. O truth! truth! how inw ardly did the marrow of my soul sigh after thee even then, whilst they were perpetually dinni ng thy name into my ears, and 904 after various fashi ons with the mere voice, and with many and huge book s of theirs.” ( The Gnos tics and their Remains, King, p. 157. ) The Book of the Dead or Ritual of the resurrection virtually cont ains the Gospel of the Egypt ians which was assum ed to have been lost. This i s the Gospel according to Mati or Matiu, the original, as we maintain, of that which Papias attribut es to one “Matthew,” and which was a collection of the sayings assigne d to the Jesus whom the non - gnos tic Christians always assum ed to be historical. The Ri tual preserves the sayings of the Egypt ian Jesus who was Iu the Su, or Sa of Atum - Ra and Ius ā as at On, and who was otherwise know n as the Lord in different Egyptian religions . This was the sayer to whom the sayings are attributed in the “Festal Dirge” ( Records, vol . IV, p. 115) , and also in the Ritual and other Hermetic Scriptures. And now we hav e a form of the genui ne Gospel of the Egypt ians in the Ritual itself. This is the original Evange lium Veritas : The Gospel according to Mati=Matthew; to Aan= John; or Tum =Thom as. From this we learn, by means of the com parative process, that the literalizers of the legend and the carnalizers of the Egypt o - gnos tic Christ have but gathered up the empty hus ks of Pagan tradition, minus the kernel of the Gnos is; so that when we have taken away all which pertains to Horus, the Egypt o - gnos tic Jesus, all that remains to base a Jude an history upon is nothing more than an accretion of blindl y ignor ant belief; and that of all the Gospels and collections of “Sayings ” derived from the Ritual of the resurrection in the name of Mati or Matthew, Aan or John, Thom as or Tum , Her mes, Iu - em - hetep or Jesus, thos e that were canoni zed at last as Christian are the most exot eric, and therefore the farthest away from the unde rlying, hidde n, bur ied, but imperishable truth.
