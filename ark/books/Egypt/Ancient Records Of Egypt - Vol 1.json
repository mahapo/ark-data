In American history whole libraries of such sources have appeared or are promised. These are chiefly in English, although the other languages of Europe are of course often largely represented. The employment of such sources from the early epochs of the world's history involves either a knowledge of ancient languages on the part of the user, or a complete rendition of the documents into English. No attempt has ever been made to collect and present all the sources of Egyptian history in a modern language. A most laudable beginning in this direction, and one that has done great service, was the Records of the Past; but that series never attempted to be complete, and no amount of editing could make con- sistent with themselves the uncorrelated translations of the large number of contributors to that series. The author is only too well aware of the difficulties involved in such a project. In mere bulk alone it has been a considerable enterprise, in view of the preliminary tasks made necessary by the state of the published texts. These I have indicated briefly in the chapter on the sources herein (Vol. I, $5 27-32). Under these circumstances, the author's first obligation has been to go behind the publica- tions to the original documents themselves, wherever necessary. The method pursued has also been indicated herein (Vol. I, $5 33-37). The task has consumed years, and demanded protracted sojourn among the great col- vii"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"... vlll PREFACE lections of Europe. In this work a related enterprise has been of the greatest assistance. A mission to the museums of Europe to collect and copy their Egyptian monuments for a commission of the four Royal Academies of Germany (Berlin, Leipzig, Gottingen, and Munich), in order to make these documents available for an exhaustive Egyptian Dictionary endowed by the German Emperor, enabled the author to copy from the originals practically all the his- torical monuments of Egypt in Europe. The other sources of material, and particularly the papers of the Dictionary just mentioned, have enabled the author to base the trans- lations ip these volumes directly, or practically so, upon the originals themselves in almost all cases. Unfortunately, the possession of these materials is but the beginning of the difficulties which beset such an enter- prise. In the preface to the first edition of his English Dictionary, Noah Webster complains of the difficulties caused by the new meanings taken on by English words as they are modified by the new environment which envelops them in America. If such changes are involved in the voyage across the Atlantic, and the lapse of a few genera- tions, how much wider and deeper is the gulf due to the total difference between the semitropical northern Nile valley of millenniums ago, and the English-spea.king world of this twentieth century! The psychology of early man is something with which we have as yet scarcely begun to operate. His whole world and his whole manner of think- ing are sharply differentiated from our own. His organi- zation, socially, industrially, commercially, politically; his tools, his house, his conveniences, constantly involve insti- tutions, adjustments, and appliances totally unknown to this modern age and this western world. In the transla- tion of the New Testament for the tribes of Alaska, I am"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PREFACE ix told, there has been great difficulty in the rendition of the term \"Good Shepherd,\" for the reason that many of these people never saw a sheep and never heard of a shepherd. Similarly, how shall one rehabilitate this ancient world of the Nile-dweller, and put his documents into intelligible English, when the ideas to be rendered are often unknown to the average modem and western reader, and, needless to say, there are no corresponding terms in the English language ? Another constant source of difficulty has been the lack of those indispensable helps, the legion of concordances, glossaries, handbooks, and compilations for ready refer- ence, which the worker in Greek or Hebrew has constantly at his hand. In spite of the colossal industry of Brugsch, we are still without a dictionary of Egyptian to which one can turn with any hope of finding other examples of a rare word. Hardly any Old Kingdom documents at all were employed by Brugsch in the compilation of his dictionary, and, grateful as we are for what he was able to furnish us, we must still await the great Berlin Dictionary before we shall possess an exhaustive compendium of the language. I was able to employ the alphabetically arranged materials of the Dictionary here and there, but the compilation was not sufficiently far advanced at the conclusion of my work to be of much service. Wherever I have drawn examples from it, they are carefully acknowledged in the footnotes. A good many distinctions in the meanings of words have become evident to me in the course of the work upon the documents. Wherever such have become clear late in the progress of the work, it was impossible to go through the translations and revise the entire manuscript for the sake of such words alone. I have tried to control these cases as far as possible in the proofs, but I am confident that some such"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"x PREFACE changes have been overlooked as the accumulation of alter- ations demanded in the proofreading was quite beyond my powers of observation in so large a mass of materials. Thus, for example, the common word sr is usually trans- lated \"prince,\" and this is undoubtedly sometimes the meaning of the word; but it very frequently means \"offi- cial,\" a fact which I did not observe until far along in the progress of the work. Some danger of confusion also arises from the fact that titles indicative of rank or office suffer great change in meaning in the lapse of several thousand years. Thus the Vty or ('count7' of the feudal and pre-feudal ages becomes a mere magistrate or town-mayor in the Empire, although in sporadic cases the word still retains its old meaning. The translation of titles has perhaps been the greatest source of difficulty in the entire course of the work. Many of the offices found cannot be determined with precision. We have as yet no history of titles-one of the most needed works in the entire range of Egyptian studies. Under these circumstances, it has been impossible always to define with precision the range and scope of a given office. Even when these were determinable, the corresponding term was often wanting in English, and could not be devised without the use of a whole phrase. In some cases awkward combina- tions have been necessary in the renderings of titles. Thus the compound \"king's-son\" was adopted because it is occasionally followed in the original by a pronoun referring to \"king,\" which made the rendering \"royal son\" impos- sible. For this reason a series of such compounds has been employed : \" king's-son,\" (' king's-daughter,\" \" king's-wife,\" '( king's-mother,?' \" king's-scribe,\" and the like. It is hoped to render all such matters clear in the index. In general, the effort has been to render as literally as"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"PREFACE xi possible without wrenching English idiom. In this latter particular I probably have not always succeeded; but I have deliberately preferred this evil to a glib rendering which reads well and may be a long distance from the sense of the original. We have had so much of so-called \"para- phrasing,\" which does not even remotely resemble the pur- port of the original, that I have felt justified in gratifying a righteous horror of such romancing, even at the cost of idiomatic English. The reader has a right to expect that the subjective fancies of the translator have been rigidly excluded, and a right to demand that he may put implicit dependence both upon the individual words and the general sense of the renderings. At the same time, the author would distinctly disclaim any desire to give to these trans- lations the authority of monographs. The extent of the materials, and the amount of time expended in the collection, collation, and correction of the original texts before doing anything toward a formal version, have made it impossible to devote to the translation of each document as much time as one would deem necessary for the production of a mono- graph upon it. While the most conscientious attention has been given to the versions, and they have sometimes been revised three times (always once), yet it is undoubtedly the case that, in the course of rendering such a mass of materials, errors have crept in. Notice of any that may be observed by my fellow-workers in this field will be grate- fully received, and utilized should a future edition of these volumes ever appear. For the benefit of the general reader, it should be noted that a complete revolution in our knowledge of the Egyptian grammar has taken place in the last twenty-five years. The exhaustive study of syntax and of verbal forms which has been in progress for generations in the classic languages,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xii PREFACE or even in the Semitic group, has been going on for only a little over a quarter of a century in Egyptian. This is no reflection on the work of the first two generations of Egyp- tologists, for such work was impossible in their day. In this quarter-century, immense progress has been made and certain definite results have been attained. It cannot be said that these results have yet been applied to the under- standing of the historical documents of Egypt as a whole. One of the main purposes of this work has been the attain- ment of this end. Indeed, its chief object may be indicated in this connection as: first, the attainment of copies which in correctness adequately reproduce the original document; and, second, an English version which shall embody our modern knowledge of the language. Every effort has been made to realize these two aims, and only in such degree as they may have been attained will these volumes form a contribution to knowledge. In the selection of documents there has sometimes been difficulty in deciding what should and what should not be included by the term \"historical document.\" All purely religious compositions, as well as all exclusively literary documents (belles-lettres), all science, like mathematics and medicine, and in most cases all business documents, have been excluded. In the Old Kingdom, however, the last have been included, in view of the limited materials surviv- ing from that distant age. It is hoped that these other classes of documents will appear in further volumes of this series. In all cases, however, where the other classes of documents were of vital historical importance-that is, bore directly on events and conditions closely touching the career of the Egyptian state-they have been included here. These volumes, therefore, include the entire series of written documents from which we draw our knowledge"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"PREFACE ... Xlll of the career of the Nile valley peoples as a nation, until the beginning of permanent foreign domination at the advent of the Persians in 525 B. C. Besides furnishing an English version of these docu- ments, the scope of this work also includes the proper introduction of the reader to their intelligent study; hence the versions are accompanied by notes and introductions. These are threefold in character. Firstly, in a footnote appended to the title of each document, the reader will find a brief description of it, indicating whether it is of stone or papyrus, a stela, a relief, an obelisk, or whatever it may be, with statement of its size and material whenever the data were obtainable. The state of preservation is noted, and then all the publications in which the text of the monument has appeared. In a word, this footnote contains the lower criticism of the document. No attempt has been made to add to the bibliography the various treatments and discussions of the monument which have at various times appeared. The bulk of these essays are long since obsolete, and the time has certainly come when we can detach our usable bibliography from this incum- bering inheritance, without at the same time failing to recognize with gratitude the great service which it once rendered to the science. Furthermore, it has seemed a duty to indicate to the reader in this footnote, the comparative value of the more important publications of the text. If an edition of the text has proved inaccurate and untrustworthy, it is but right that it should be known as such. In a purely objective and impersonal manner, therefore, such materials have been characterized in these introductory footnotes. Secondly, each monument is supplied with a usually short introduction, setting forth the historical significance of the document, its character, and, where necessary, a"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiv PREFACE resume of its content. It therefore contains in brief com- pass the higher criticism of the document. Much of the historical background, and literary value of the more important documents will be found set forth more fully in the author's History of Egypt,\" which is based upon the documentary sources in these volumes. As a further aid in gaining a comprehensive idea of the content, the version of each document itself has been divided into logical paragraphs, each with a subtitle. It is intended that bythis plan a given passage of the document may be referred to by number, thus furnishing a very brief system of reference to all the monuments, by means of the volume number (Roman) followed by the paragraph number (Arabic). Thirdly, the version of each monument is accompanied by running footnotes explaining obscure matters in the text as far as possible. It has been impossible to make these any fuller, although the author is quite aware that many details requiring explanation have been left without comment. It has been his especial endeavor to adduce in the footnotes, or at least call attention to, all related matter, whether in this series of translations or elsewhere among - the monuments of Egypt. It has often been more con- venient to introduce a very brief or fragmentary inscription of a few words in a footnote attached to a related passage in some larger document, than to give such flotsam and jetsam independent heads as separate documents. It is expected to render these all easily discoverable in the index. The maps necessary to an understanding of the geography of the monuments will also appear with the index. I have attempted to solve the unwelcome problem of the transliteration of Egyptian words and names by giving aA History of Egypt, large 8v0, 640 pp., 200 illustrations, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1905."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"PREFACE xv the proper names where necessary in two forms: first, a vocalized form for the layman; and, second, a purely consonantal transliteration placed after it in parentheses. As the layman for whom the first is intended knows nothing of Egyptian orthography, it is not important that he shall be able to recognize in the forms the consonants of the original. This vocalized form should, however, as nearly as possible reproduce the consonants upon which it is based, without introducing elements unintelligible to the - layman. Hence I have ignored ' and ', y becomes i or y, and w is indicated by .u or w. The consonantal translitera- tion adopted is the most nearly satisfactory system yet evolved, viz., that of the Berlin school, with some slight modifications. It is as follows: ' = Semitic N rc = Semitic 2 S = Semitic i?j rn = Semitic 72 .f= ic d= u In the so-called \"syllabic orthography7' employed by the Egyptians in writing foreign words, only the first consonant of each biconsonantal sign has any significance. The second has no phonetic value in such words. This is not the place to discuss the closer equivalences of these consonants. It is probable the ' (Eagle) diverges aThe nature of the difference between this and the following S is entirely obscure. From the Middle Kingdom on, they represent the same sound.

It has not seemed wise to burden a work of this character with such distinctions, and the y appearing in these volumes at the beginning of a word merely indicates that the initial consonant of the original word is \"reed-leaf\" without predicating anything as to whether its sound is ' or N. To the numerous colleagues in Europe who have been so ready with assistance whenever called upon, I would here publicly express the deepest obligation. For untrammeled access to their collections, and never-failing co-operation, my sincere acknowledgments are due to the authorities of the museums at Berlin, London (British Museum, University College, Petrie Collections), Paris (Louvre, Bibliotheque Nationale, Musee Guimet), Vienna (Hofmuseum), Leyden, Munich, Rome (Vatican, and Capitoline), Florence (Museo Archzeologico), Bologna, Naples, Turin, Pisa, Geneva, Lyons, Liverpool, and some others. It is with the greatest pleasure that I recall the years of work in the Berlin Museum to which these volumes have called me. It would be impos- sible, were I to attempt it, to enumerate the daily kindnesses or tell of the constant co-operation which I have enjoyed there. For daily access to the materials of the academic Dictionary, already mentioned, I would express to Professor Erman, and the gentlemen of the Dictionary staff, my hearty thanks. For never-failing personal counsel and aid my thanks are also due to Erman, Schaefer, and Sethe; while Steindorff, Borchardt, Spiegelberg, Gardiner, Bissing, Weigall, Newberry, Petrie, and Legrain have placed valuable copies, collations, photographs, or reports at my disposal. The unremitting labors of Maspero and Wiedemann have given us indispensable bibliographies of the historical docu- ments, and these have been of great service to me-a service"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"PREFACE xvii for which I would express to them my sincere thanks. I did not, however, depend solely upon these works, but made an independent bibliography from the beginning-a plan which not infrequently turned up invaluable old sources not before employed. To my friend, President William R. Harper, for his interest in this enterprise, and his unfailing support in arranging for my repeated absence in Europe for the prosecution of these studies, I owe a debt of gratitude. Likewise to the Board of Trustees of the University of Chicago, for the same privileges, it is an agreeable duty to express my appreciation here. Finally my thanks are due the staff of the University of Chicago Press for unremitting attention to the difficult typographical work of these volumes-an attention to which the appearance of the work is of itself sufficient evi- dence. I should add that circumstances entirely beyond my control have obliged me to read the proofs of the volumes very rapidly, and it is probable that they contain more typographical errors due to this fact than I could wish. For great assistance in reading the proofs I am indebted to my brother-in-law Dr. R. S. Padan, and for like aid to my wife and her sister, Miss Imogen Hart. JAMES HENRY BREASTED.

The general course and the gradual development of Egyptian civilization are in some respects roughly traceable in its surviving material documents, in the products of the artist and the craftsman, which we are accustomed to assign to the domain of the archzeologist. With these invaluable material documents the present volumes of course do not deal. They purpose to present only those written documents from which the career of the Nile valley peoples may be drawn at the present day. A rapid survey of the materials herein pre- sented may enable the non-Egyptologist to gain some pre- liminary conception of their general character. 2. Comparatively speaking, but very little of the rich and productive civilization which flourished for at least five mil- lenniums before Christ on the banks of the lower Nile, has survived in written documents for our enlightenment. Accident has preserved but here and there the merest scrap of the vast mass of written records which the incessant political, legal, administrative, religious, industrial, com- mercial, and literary activities filling the life of this ancient people, were constantly putting forth. We may make one exception: the religious literature, doubtless the least instruct- ive, as a whole, of all their literary documents, has survived in an incalculable mass of temple inscriptions and papyri, which have never even been adequately published, much less exhaustively studied. 3. It is with those documents in which the national career as a whole can be traced that we have here to deal. From the pre-dynastic age onward the kings kept a series of 3"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"4 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES 15 4 -- annals, recording in each year the great deeds and achieve- ments of the Pharaoh which he thought worthy of perpetua- tion. Of such annals only two fragments have survived: the Palermo Stone, part of a record extending from the earliest times down into the Fifth Dynasty; and the annals of Thutmose 111's wars, of which a few extracts were excerpted by a priestly scribe and recorded on the walls of the Karnak temple. Had we the annals of the Pharaohs in complete form, we might perhaps write almost as full a history of Egypt as it is possible to do for the Middle Ages of European history. Without these, we are dependent upon a miscellaneous mass of documents of the most varied character and value, which chance and circumstance have preserved from destruction these thousands of years. Tn general, such documents show more literary character and picturesqueness than the Assyro-Babylonian records; but the latter dry and formal annals possess greater historical value, and exhibit a preciseness which indues them with a rare availability as sources. The Egyptian records which chance has preserved to us are, as a whole, so vague and indefinite in their references to peoples, localities, persons, and the character of events, that they are often tantalizing in what they do not tell us. Thus in records of whole cam- paigns of Thutmose 111 in Syria the hostile Syrian king is designated merely as \"that foe\" (lit. \"failen orze\"), and we are uncertain whether the king of Kadesh, of Mitanni, of Aleppo, or of some other realm is meant. The real excerpts from Thutmose 111's Annals (11,391 ff.), however, show that such records contained an elaboration of detail not less precise and historically available than the cuneiform annals. So much the more must we deplore their loss. 4. How hazardous was the life of such a document may be well illustrated by the great building inscription, upon a"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"6 61 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES !i huge stone stela, erected by Sesostris I nearly two thousand years before Christ, in his new temple at Heliopolis. The great block itself has since perished utterly; but the practice- copy made by a scribe, who was whiling away an idle hour in the sunny temple court, has survived, and the fragile roll of leather (is 498 ff .) upon which he was thus exercising his pen, has transmitted to us what the massive stone could not preserve. 5. That we possess any documents at all from the Old Kingdom (2980-2400 B. C.) is chiefly due to the massive masonry tombs of that age, in which they were recorded. The exceptions are inscriptions on foreign soil, and a few scanty fragments of papyrus containing accounts and letters. The vast quantity of such papyrus documents which once existed is evidenced by the constant appearance of the scribe with his rolls, his pens, and his ink palette, in the tomb reliefs. Such hints from the numerous reliefs in the tombs of this age are the source of our knowledge of the material culture of the time. The chief inscriptions which accompany them consist almost exclusively of the name and many titles of the owner of the tomb. Now and again the legal enactment by which the tomb was endowed and main- tained is recorded on the wall. Such wills and conveyances are, of course, invaluable cultural documents. 6. Gradually the nobles were inclined to add a few bio- graphical details to the series of bare titles. The first of such scanty biographies appears at the end of the Third Dynasty (i $ I 70 ff .), after which there is a growing fondness for record- ing at least the chief honors received by the deceased from the Pharaoh, especially the furnishing and equipment of his tomb at the king's expense. The daily intercourse of the deceased with the king, the privileges which he enjoyed in connection with the royal person, or now and then the copy"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"6 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES [§ 7 of a letter from the king to his favorite-all these serve to make such biographies of inestimable value in completing our picture of the culture of the time. In the Sixth Dynasty these biographies become real narratives of the career of the departed noble, or at least of his most notable achievements in the service of the Pharaoh. The most important docu- ments of this character are the biographies of Uni ($0 291 ff.), and the nobles of Elephantine ($5 325 ff., 355 ff., 362 ff.), one of whom has included therein a personal letter from the king ($ $350 ff.). 7. As the aggressiveness of the Pharaohs increased, their foreign enterprises found record on the rocks in a number of distant regions (outsidc of Egypt proper), where they still exist. In the Peninsula of Sinai they appear in the First Dynasty (began 3400 B. C.) ; by the Fifth Dynasty (ended by 2580 B. C.) the officials who led such expeditions com- menced to add their own records below the mere relief depicting the triumphant king, a scene to which heretofore only the name of the king was appended. From the Fourth Dynasty such memorials begin to appear in the alabaster quarries of Hatnub, behind Amarna; and from the reign of Isesi, in the Fifth Dynasty, they become more and more numerous in the quarries of Hammamat in the eastern desert, on the road from Coptos to the Red Sea. Practically all that we know, for example, of the power and deeds of the Eleventh Dynasty (2160-2000 B. C.) is drawn from records in these quarries. 8. They soon become so regular that their stoppage is almost certain evidence of an interruption in the orderly course of government in the Nile valley. Similar inscrip- tions on the rocks at the first cataract ($5 316 ff.) begin in the time of Mernere, of the Sixth Dynasty (2625-2475 B. C.). The earliest inscription (Q $ 472, 473) above the cataract in"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Q 101 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES 7 Nubia itself dates from the reign of Amenemhet I, the first king of the Twelfth Dynasty (2000-1788 B. C.). Under the Empire such records on foreign soil appear also in Syria and Palestine (111, 297). Quarry inscriptions within the borders of Egypt do not begin until the Middle Kingdom, when we find them in the limestone quarries of Ayan (Turra- Ma'sara) just south of Cairo (8 0 739,740) ; at the sandstone quarries of Silsileh they first appear under the Empire. 9. From the Middle Kingdom (2160--1788 B. C.) on, the memorial stelae at Abydos are exceedingly valuable.\" Oiaicials on various commissions, whose business carried them to the holy city, improved the opportunity to erect memorial stones craving the favor of Osiris, the great god of the dead, for themselves and their relatives. Now and again such an. officer narrates the circumstances which called him to Abydos; thus Ikhernofret, the treasurer of Sesostris 111, records on his stela ($0 661-70) not only the occasion of his visit, but also a copy of the royal letter which contained the command dispatching him thither. 10. In this age the tomb biographies become extremely valuable, because of their tendency to fulness and family details-a tendency already visible in the Tenth Dynasty tombs at Siut (0s 391 ff.). But unfortunately only the tombs of Middle Egypt, chiefly at Benihasan (0 0 619 ff.), are pre- served. Royal monuments with inscribed records become more plentiful, especially in Nubia, where the boundary stelae of Sesostris I11 (0 0 65 1-60) are especially noteworthy; and in the quarries of Hammamat and the mines of Sinai. Papyri of any kind in the Middle Kingdom are still none too plentiful. Literary papyri are well represented by aThe great Old Kingdom inscription of Uni at Abydos hardly belongs to the class of memorial stelae here designated.

Of business and adminis- trative documents, like letters, bills, accounts and tax lists, we have examples in the Kahun Papyri, of which the second find, now at Berlin, is still unpublished. But papyrus docu- ments of strictly historical import, such as we can include here, are still rare in this age. 11. Under the Empire (1580-1150 B. C.) the available documents both in quantity and quality for the first time approach the minimum which in European history would be regarded as adequate to a moderately full presentation of the career of the nation. Scores of important questions, however, still remain unanswered, in whatever direction we turn. Nevertheless, a rough framework of the govern- mental organization, the constitution of society, the most important achievements of the kings, and to a limited extent the spirit of the imperial age, may be discerned and sketched, in the main outlines, with clearness and fair precision, even though it is only here and there that the sources enable us to fill in the detail. 12. It is especially royal monuments which are more plentiful in the Empire, as compared with earlier times. The first and most important class of such documents is found in the temples-a source which in the earlier periods has totally perished. It was customary already at the beginning of the dynasties for the king to commemorate his victories in the temples. This custom led in the Empire to extensive and magnificent records on the temple walls, on a scale not before attempted. Such documents were less records than triumphal memorials, and as historical sources they are therefore very insufficient. They dealt with events with which all were familiar at the time of their erection, and hence specific references to the said events are rare, or, if present at all, are couched in such vague and"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"I 141 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES 9 general terms that little can be drawn from them at the present day. 13. They consist chiefly in extensive reliefs on the temple walls, depicting the victorious Pharaoh in battle, capturing prisoners, or presenting prisoners and spoil to Amon. They are accompanied by descriptive and explanatory inscriptions, which unfortunately consist, for the most part, in conven- tional phrases in laudation of the Pharaoh as a mighty ruler. As the temples of the Eighteenth Dynasty have to a large extent perished, the priceless records of that imperial family have perished with them. We have three great series of reliefs: one representing the birth of Queen Hatshepsut (11, 187 ff.), and a duplicate depicting the birth of Amenhotep I11 (11, 841 ff.), while the third pictures the voyage of Hatshepsut to the land of Punt (11, 246 ff.). More valu- able are the extracts from the annals of Thutmose I11 on the walls of the Karnak temple (11, 391 ff.), already men- tioned, and a similar record of his son Amenhotep I1 on a large stela at Karnak (11, 780 ff.). The temple records of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties are much more plentiful; but they are almost exclusively of the unprecise character above described. Besides the great record of Merneptah's Libyan war, (111, 569-617)) which is a much better source, they are chiefly memorials of the wars of Seti I (111, 80-156), of his son, Ramses I1 (IV, 294-391,448-91)) and of Ramses 111, of the Twentieth Dynasty (IV, 1-145). 14. Another class of temple records is the building inscriptions. Apart from their value as records of building enterprises, they contain valuable references to the history of the builder. In a number of cases the early career of the builder and the manner in which he came to the throne are prefixed as an introduction to the record of the building itself. This is observable as far back as the building"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"10 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES [Q 1.5 inscription of Sesostris I, in the Twelfth Dynasty (9 § 498 ff .) ; in the Eighteenth Dynasty (1580-1350 B. C.) we gain invaluable hints of the early life of Thutmose I11 from his great building inscription in the Karnak temple (11, 131 ff.). Such building records not infrequently also contain priceless references to the wars and campaigns of the Pharaoh, whence he may have obtained the wealth for the edifice in question. Notable examples of this class are the stela of Thutmose I91 in the Ptah temple at Karnak (11, 609 ff.), and the great summary of the buildings of Amenhotep I11 left by him on a stela in his mortuary temple at Thebes (11, 878 ff.). 15. Records of restorations are not less valuable. The restoration record of Hatshepsut at Benihasan (11, 296 ff.) throws a significant sidelight on the reasons necessitating such restoration of the temples, after their neglect by the Hyksos; while the short remarks of Harmhab and Seti I, recording their restorations after the revolution of Ikhnaton, are invaluable indications of the widespread activity of the latter (11, 878). Again, we gain a hint of the anarchy fol- lowing this revolution, from the record of Harmhab's restora- tion of the mummy of Thutmose IV, after its violatioil by tomb-robbers (111, 32 A ff .). 16. Stelze dedicating the finished temple to the god were set up in the holy of holies, at the place where the king stood in the performance of the royal ritual. Some of these were of enormous size, that of Amenhotep I11 in his temple behind the Memnon colossi being no less than thirty feet high, and hewn of a single block (11, go4 ff.). The content of these dedication stelze does not differ essentially from that of the building inscriptions; they likewise contain references to the wars of the kings erecting them. The most important of these now surviving are the two in dupli- cate erected by Amenhotep I1 at Am%da and Elephantine"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"8 181 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES 11 (11, 791 ff.). The temple obelisks also occasionally bear inscriptions of historical importance, and among these the inscriptions of Hatshepsut (11, 304 ff.), of Thutmose I11 (11, 623 E.), and of Thutmose IV (11, 830 ff.) furnish very useful data. 17. All these temple records, being for the glory of the Pharaoh, are couched in language very poetic and highly colored, although the poetic form is not always discernible. Among them, however, are found poems in praise of the sovereign, exhibiting strictly poetic structure, with rigid division into strophes. Some of these contain references and allusions which, in view of the scantiness of our mate- rials, may be employed historically. Such hymns probably existed from the earliest days of the dynasties, but the earli- est example preserved is dedicated to the praise of Sesostris 111, of the Twelfth Dynasty.\" In the Empire the most notable example celebrates the fame of Thutmose I11 (11, 655 ff.). It is the earliest of such poems possessing real historical importance. 18. Royal records not of this class of temple memorials are not numerous. Of actual state documents we possess very few. The viceroy of Kush recorded on stone the decree in which Thutmose I announced his coronation, and of this rescript we possess two copies (11, 54 ff.). At the opening of the Nineteenth Dynasty (1350-1205 B. C.) we have the royal decree instituting the administrative reforms of Harmhab; it is possibly in its original form (111, 45-67). Another great example of a state document is the famous treaty between Ramses I1 and the Hittite king Khetasar (111, 367-91).

A few letters from the king personally (e. g., $8 350 ff., 664, 665) and some legal records (IV, 499-557) complete the list of state docu- ments. The remaining royal documents are of a miscel-. laneous character, like the unique memorial scarabs of Amenhotep 111 (PI, 860 ff.), or the huge stel~ erected as landmarks by Ikhnaton for the purpose of demarking the limits of his new capital at Amarna (11, 949 ff.). Finally, the greatest of all royal documents is the enormous Papyrus Harris, recording the good deeds of Ramses I11 (1198-116 j B. C.) to gods and men, compiled for his tomb, as a title to consideration at the hands of the gods in the future liie (Pv, 15 1-41 2). 19. The private monuments of the Empire are also more numerous than before and contribute greatly to our knowl- edge of it. The tombs of the Pharaoh's grandees have now become more personal monuments than ever before. These men, who were guiding Egypt on her imperial career, delighted to perpetuate in their tombs some record of the brilliant part which they were playing in these great events. The generals and administrative officials who under the Pharaoh governed the Empire, now sleep in rock-hewn tombs at Thebes, the chambers of which still bear magnifi- cently painted scenes from their active and adventurous lives. Here we behold the reception of tribute, from the remotest limits of the Empire, borne on the shoulders of Palestinians, Syrians, or northern islanders, the whole being accompanied by explanatory inscriptions. The various duties and activities of the greatest officials of the govern- ment are here depicted, and from these scenes and the appended inscriptions we can draw fuller data respecting the Empire and its organization than from any other source. 20. These tomb chapels, besides the Amarna Letters,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Q 211 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES I3 are also the only surviving contemporary source for the civilization of Syria and Palestine in the second millennium before Christ. The most important of such tombs is that of Rekhmire, the vizier of Thutmose I11 (11, 663-762). The biographies of the generals preserved in these tomb chapels are not infrequently our only source for entire wars of the Pharaoh, of which we should not otherwise have known anything at all-not even that they took place. Besides these tomb inscriptions, the nobles also recorded their biog- raphies, or at least some of their achievements, on the statues accorded them by the Pharaoh in the Karnak temple. Examples of such records are the statue of Senmut (11, 345 ff.), or that of Beknekhonsu (111, 561 ff.) . After the Eighteenth Dynasty the Empire abounds in papyri: letters, bills, receipts, administrative and legal documents, memo- randa, numerous literary compositions, scientific treatises like those on medicine, mathematics, or astronomy, religious documents, and innumerable ostraca, or potsherds and flakes of limestone bearing receipts, letters, memoranda, or literary fragments. These, for the most part, fall outside of the scope of the present volumes and will appear in later series of these Ancient Records. 21. Such are the main sources for the history of the Empire; there are, of course, numerous unimportant mis- cellaneous monuments which we have not mentioned; nor do we recall all the classes of documents already referred to in the older epochs, like the inscriptions abroad, which now become very plentiful. Indeed, the rocks of the first cataract under the Empire became a veritable visitors7 regis- ter of the officials and functionaries who, passing on some commission in Nubia, left a record of the errand, or merely name and titles, engraved on the rocks above the reach of the inundation (e. g., 11, 675 ff.). Inscriptions of the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"I4 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES rl 22 emperors are found in Nubia as far south as the island of Tombos, and mere cartouches with titles up to the fourth cataract. 22. With the decline of Thebes in the Decadence (1150- 663 B. C.), and the transference of the seat of power to the North, the great mass of records of the royal houses was produced, and their monuments were erected, in the Delta, where almost the whole has perished forever, with the' destruction of the exposed Delta cities, overwhelmed by invasion after invasion from abroad, and gradually engulfed by the rising soil as deposited from century to century by the inundation. The fortunes of the northern dynasties can therefore be traced only in the scanty monuments of Thebes, in which the Pharaohs no longer built largely, and at Memphis, where we have a series of dated stela! recording Apis burials in the Serapeum. These are of great value from the Twenty-second to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. At Thebes the records of the restoration of royal mummies extend from the last generation of the Twentieth into the Twenty-second Dynasty (IV, 592 ff., 636 ff ., 661 ff., 664 ff., 688 ff., 690 ff., 699 f.); and a series of dated Nile levels on the quay at Karnak continues from the Twenty-second to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (IV, 693 ff.). We have at Thebes also a few temple records from the priest-kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty (1090-945 B. C.), a series of decrees of Amon (IV, 614 ff ., 650 ff ., 669 ff .), and some not very important building records of the high priests of Amon, during the same period. The same is true in the Twenty- second Dynasty (945-755 B. C.), through the brief Twenty- third and Twenty-fourth Dynasties (755-712 B. C.), and the Ethiopian period (Twenty-fifth Dynasty, 712-663 B. C.). At this point, fortunately, the scanty monuments of the Delta are supplemented by the historical stela: erected by"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"8 241 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES I5 the Ethiopians at Gebel Barkal (Napata). Among these, the narrative of his conquest of Egypt by Piankhi is one of the most remarkable documents of ancient Egypt (IV, 796-8831. 23. The paucity of documents, so painfully evident dur- ing the Decadence, is even worse under the Restoration (Twenty-sixth Dynasty, 663-525 B. C.). Besides the great adoption stela of Psamtik I at Thebes (IV, 935 ff.), a few Serapeum stel~, important for the chronology, a small num- ber of statue inscriptions of noblemen of the time, and some rniscellaneous stelz. of little importance, we possess almost nothing from the Restoration. Unhappily, the papyri, which are so plentiful during the Nineteenth, Twentieth, and Twenty-first Dynasties, are few and unimportant throughout the remainder of the Decadence and the whole of the Restoration. Fortunately, Herodotus, and the Greek historians after him, enter at this point with invaluable accounts of the history and civilization of the Restoration epoch; but these foreign sources do not fall within the province of these volumes. 24. Besides these contemporary native sources, we pos- sess also a series of later native versions of important events in the history of the nation. These documents are either merely folk-tales, of course differing strikingly in form from the more formal contemporary records; or they are products of the later priesthoods, which, in the form of a tale, give an account of some earlier event, which they so interpret or so distort as to bring reputation, or even material gain, to their sanctuaries. Of the folk-tales we have three of importance : Papyrus Westcar, relating the prodigies attending the birth of the first three Fifth Dynasty kings; Papyrus Sallier I, narrating the cause of the war with the Hyksos; and Papy- rus Harris 500, in which is told the story of the capture of"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"16 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES [S 25 Joppa by one of Thutmose I117s generals, named Thutiy. As tales these documents have no place in this series, although each is based on some actual historical incident, which may be obscurely discerned in the narrative. The priestly tales are likewise three in number: the Sehel inscription, recount- ing the gift of the Dodekaschoinos at the first cataract to Khnum by King Zoser of the Third Dynasty; the Sphinx Stela (11, 810 ff.), recording the accession of Thutmose IV to the kingship, because as prince he cleared the Sphinx of sand; and finally the Bentresh Stela, containing a tale in honor of one of the Theban Khonsus, by showing that he was carried to a distant Asiatic kingdom in order to heal its king's daughter, in the days of Ramses I1 (111, 429-47). The last two stories seemed of sufficient importance to be included here. It was with tales in common circulation like these that Herodotus' informants regaled him, and the narrative portions of Manetho's history were largely made up of just such stories, of which further examples from Ptolemaic times have survived in Demotic dress. 25. It will be seen that the great mass of the documents available are found in Upper Egypt, and but a scanty few in the Delta. This unfortunate fact makes all our knowl- edge one-sided, and the history of the Delta, the civilization of which must have risen at a very remote date, remains for the most part unknown to us. Our loss is here like that in Greek history, in which we know almost nothing of the great civilization in the powerful cities of Asia Minor, from which the culture of the early states in Greece drew so much. 26. The documents thus briefly surveyed have reached us, with very few exceptions, in a state of sad mtxtilation. This mutilation and gradual destruction are a ceaseless process, which, if not as rapid as formerly, nevertheless proceeds without cessation at the present day. In Egypt,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"§ 283 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES I7 the exposed monuments, like the great geographical list of Sheshonk I, are perishing with appalling rapidity, and many of them without ever having been properly copied or published. Even the portable stone monuments at present in the museums of Europe suffer more or less; and I have seen valuable stelz so attacked by the moist air of northern Europe that whole layers might be blown from the inscribed surface by a whiff of the breath. Such an inscription is doomed to disappear in a few years. Papyri when mounted between hermetically sealed glass plates survive indefinitely. 27. These monuments, as employed in Egyptological science, are, for the most part, not accessible in the originals, but are consulted chiefly in publications. Such publica- tions, to omit earlier and cruder attempts, began as far back as the colossal report issued in huge folios by the members of Napoleon 1's expedition. Notable and useful as this great work was, its copies of the inscriptions are now quite unusable. To copy an inscription of any kind with accuracy is not easy. So close and fine an observer of material documents as Ruskin, could copy a short Latin inscription with surprising inaccuracy. In his incomparable Mornings in Florencea he reproduces the brief inscription on the marble slab covering the tomb which he so admired in the church of Santa Croce; and in his copy of these eight short lines, which I compared with the original, he misspells one word, and omits two entire words (\"et magister\") of the medizeval Latin. 28. This experience of the great art critic is not infre- quently that of the schooled and careful paleographer as well. The best-known of the Politarch inscriptions appeared in eight different publications,b each of which diverges in aThird edition, 1889, 16. bSee Burton, American Journal of Theology, 11, 600-604,"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"I 8 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES [Q 29 some more or less important respect from all the rest, before a correct copy was obtained. The Greek and Latin inscrip- tions on the bronze crab from the base of the New York obelisk were long incorrectly read, and the mistake in the date led Mommsen to a false theory of the early Roman prefects of Egypt.\" In working on a mutilated inscription, the best of copyists will now and again overlook traces which his successors may discover and utilize, while now and then he will \"nap,\" and be guilty of some egregious blunder of omission or misreading in a clear and perfectly preserved passage. Under these circumstances, an inexperienced or careless copyist will commit the most incredible blunders, and every line of his copy will contain many such. In the early days of Egyptology, when a reading knowledge of hieroglyphic was still impossible, it required a copyist of exceptional ability to produce a copy which can be used at the present day. 29. This difficulty was sorely felt by accurate and dis- cerning. scholars as far back as the days of Chabas, who in 1872 remarlied, concerning the inscriptions of Ramses 111 : \"Ces deux publications [Rosellini and Burton] sont tr2s imparfaites; et les signes inexactement reproduits ajoutent A la difficult6 causee par les lacunes.\"b The introduction of hieroglyphic type, while very useful in some respects, has also proved disastrous to accuracy, and the persistence of the old loose methods was bemoaned by Brugsch in the intro- duction to the last volume of his Thesaurus thirteen years ago. Brugsch already showed surprising appreciation of thr: necessity of modern methods in such work. He wrote: The indispensable demands upon the publisher of known or unknown texts may be comprehended in a few words. In the first place, it is not a task to be undertaken by laymen and mere amateurs . . . . but -- &See 11, 632, note. DEtudes su7 I'antiquitd hhistorique, 227 f."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"0 311 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES I9 only by the schooled specialist, who is thoroughly familiar with the language and writing of the ancient Egyptians, and with the researches and results in all departments of Egyptological investigation. How largely such a conviction is still lacking is proved . . . . by a number of publications by Egyptological tyros [Halbwisser] and laymen, who do not yet seem to have learned that Egyptology has ceased to be the pursuit of amateurs, and has become a very serious study, demanding a man's entire strength and entire time.a 30. Not long after this, Griffith called attention to the hurried, inaccurate, and insufficient methods still often observ- able, so that numerous publications could only be regarded as provisiona1.b Two years later he referred to such work in these words: \"Too often almost every third sign in the printed texts has had to be corrected according to proba- bilities by the would-be reader.\"\" This condition of things has gone so far that we have had publications issued at government expense, containing texts in vertical columns copied with the lines numbered backward, and even trans- lated in this inverted order of the 1ines.d It is safe to say that such a condition of things cannot be found in any other branch of paleographical science. 31. This is not the place to discuss the proper methods to be observed in the publication of ancient documents, but there is no doubt that better methods are constantly gaining ground. From decade to decade the publication of inscrip- tions has steadily improved, but it is only within the last ten or fifteen years that Egyptian documents on stone have in some cases appeared in a form which satisfies the demands of modern paleographic accuracy.

The result of all this is that many of the most impor- tant documents of ancient Egypt are at present accessible to the Egyptologist only in publications so incorrect that in many cases they are absolutely unusable. It will be evident, therefore, that he who wishes to know exactly what the origi- nal documents of ancient Egypt state cannot work exclu- sively in his library, but must go behind the publications and turn back to the originals themselves, in Egypt and the museums of Europe. 33. For the purposes of these volumes it was therefore absolutely indispensable in most cases to go back of the publications. The author, therefore, made and repeatedly revised his own copies of practically all the historical monu- ments in Europe, before the originals themselves. In the few cases where the original was not accessible, good squeezes and photographs supplied the deficiency, or professional colleagues furnished from the originals specially collated readings of doubtful passages. Of the monuments in Egypt the author copied a great many at all the more important sites, especially Thebes and Amarna, where he made a com- plete copy of all the historical inscriptions; and in the museum at Cairo (formerly Gizeh). Of monuments in Egypt not included in the author's copies, squeezes were in most cases found in the enormous collection made by Lepsius, and now in the Berlin Museum. Where none of these sources furnished the desired monument, the author had access to the extensive collations made for the Berlin Egyp- tian Dictionary; and where these failed, he was able, in all important cases, to secure large-scale photographs of the originals. The final remainder of monuments for which the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"0 351 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES 2 I author was dependent upon the publications alone is very small, and in most such cases the publication was one made on modern methods and almost as good as the original itself. 34. Nevertheless, it must not be supposed that the old publications, however inaccurate, can be ignored. Some monuments have perished entirely since publication, and almost all have lost more or less important portions of the text. In the case of all the longer and more important texts, often reproduced in the old folios, the author took the best copy as a basis and collated with it all the other publications, noting in parallel columns all the variant readings. By this labori- ous means, some readings were secured which have since disappeared from the original, and all that is now available, whether in publications or in the original, was thus incor- porated in the final composite copy, from which the trans- lation was made. In a few cases the author was spared this labor by the industry of a modern editor of the document, as in the publication of the Benihasan tombs or those of Siut; but ordinarily the modern editor has not given himself this trouble, as in the last publication of Der el-Bahri. 35. The dangers involved in such neglect are evident. Thus so careful a scholar as Chabas discussed the so-called \"eclipse inscription\" (IV, 756 ff.) of Takelot 11, using only the publication of Lepsius; whereupon Goodwin. called his attention to the fact that the very conscientious plate of Lepsius had nevertheless introduced confusion into the text by the accidental misplacement of a piece of the paper squeeze from which his copy was made, thus inverting the proper order of two sections of the very obscure text. Had Chabas also employed Young's otherwise obsolete copy of the original, this embarrassing error would not have occurred. azeitschrift fiir agyptische Sprache, 1868, 25 ff."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"22 DOCUMENTARY SOURCES [B 36 36. Chabasa himself convicted Lenormant of a similar error in discussing Ramses 11's victory over the Hittites at Kadesh. Lenormantb employed only the Abusimbel ver- sion of the report of the battle, not noticing that the ancient Egyptian scribe had omitted an entire line of the document, as is shown by the Ramesseum version. This omitted line happens to be of vital importance to a proper understanding of the battle, and the failure to observe its omission is fatal to any discussion of the conflict. The same error, never- theless, has since been repeated in at least one notable modern treatise on the same battle.\" Further examples might be adduced in illustration of the danger incurred in making a study of any inscription as found in a single publication of the text. 37.

The Egyptians, as far back as the fifth millenniump before Christ,'had discovered approximately the length of the year. They, like all other peoples, had suffered from the vexatious fact that the lunar month is not an even divisor of the year. Instead of attempting to adjust this obstinate incommensurability by constant and complicated intercalations, they showed amazing appreciation of the practical demands which a calendar should satisfy, and boldly abandoned the lunar month as the basis of the calendar. Believing the year to be 365 days long, they. divided it into twelve months of thirty days each, and an intercalated period of five days at the end of the year. The creation of this convenient and practical, though artificial, calendar was an achievement unparalleled in any other ancient civilization. It was as useful to men of science as to civil life in general, and for this reason it was in later times *Since this brief discussion was written, the admirable essay of Meyer (\"Aegyp- tische Chroltologie,\" Abhandlungen der Koniglichen Preussischen Akademie, 1904) has appeared, from which the author has frequently added valuable observations to the above presentation.

The Egyptian began his year at the advent of the inundation, and this event, by a happy accident, approxi- mately coincided with the reappearance of Sirius (Sothis) at sunrise on the eastern horizon, after he had been for some length of time invisible. This occurred each year on July 19~ (Julian). The interval between such heliacal risings of Sothis was thus fortunately approximately a solar year.b The feast of the Rising of Sothis on July 19 was therefore the New Year's feast of the Egyptians. The year was also arbitrarily divided into three seasons, each containing four months of thirty days each. These were: the season of verdure, or thk inundation; the season of winter or sowing; and the season of summer or harvest. When this remark- ably rational calendar was introduced, it of course coincided with the seasons as determined for the people by the sun and the inundation. But the Sothic year was almost exactly, and in 3231 B. C.' was exactly, a quarter of a day longer than the new calendar year of 365 days. Every four years, therefore, the calendar reached the end of the year and began the next year one day too soon, so that the rising of Sirius fell on the second day of the new year. As this pro- cess continued, and each calendar New Year's Day arrived earlier and earlier, it finally passed gradually around the whole year and again fell on the astronomical New Year's Day. This process consumed four times as many years as &It took place on July 19 (Julian) as the normal date, in the latitude of Memphis, for many thousands of years B. C., until far down in the last thousand years B. C., when the Sothic ycar had sufficiently lengthened to shift the heliacal rising of Sothis to July 20.

Without knowing it, the Egyptian was thus dealing with three different years: a I. His calendar year of 365 days, by which most of the business of civil life was transacted and all documents were dated. 2. The Sothic (or Julian) year of 365; days, on the first of which the people celebrated the feast of the Rising of Sothis. 3. The solar (or Gregorian) year of a little less than 365; days (which was therefore slowly diverging from the Sothic year). 41. The Egyptian, as we have intimated, never learned that the Sothic (Julian) and the solar years were not iden- tical; the divergenceb was so slow, and so slight, that it was entirely imperceptible to the masses, or possibly even to the learned, of the time. On the contrary, the difference between his calendar and the feast of the heliacal Rising of Sothis (that is, I and 2) must have been early observed. Nevertheless, the actual shift within an average lifetime was not so great as to occasion inconvenience. Thus each generation accepted the place of the calendar in the seasons as they found it, and without remark considered it as a matter of course that the beginning of the inundation, or the advent of summer heat, fell on about such and such a day of a certain month. Both these events had occurred aSee Meyer, op. cit., 16. bIn 4231 B.

A peasant of fifty or sixty-that is, at the end of an average life-hardly remarked that the seasons were now ten or twelve days later in the calendar than when he was a lad of ten. Unfortunately, references to the place of the seasons, or of astronomical events, in the calendar are rare; never- theless, there are enough of such references to trace the gradual revolution of the calendar on the seasons. 42. In the Sixth Dynasty, Uni, a nobleman who had been sent to Assuan to procure granite from the quarries there, narrates that he succeeded in landing his cargo at the king's pyramid, although it was in the eleventh month, when, he adds (as everyone knew), there was no water for such transportation.

This shows a divergence of seven or eight months; as we should expect, in the centuries which have elapsed since the Old Kingdom the calendar had shifted several months.

The divergence steadily increased, and in the early part of the Eighteenth Dynasty, in the ninth year of Amenhotep I, it was exactly 308 days. a A Sothic date somewhere between 47 and IOI years later, in the reign of Thutmose 111, shows that it had then increased to 327 days (11,410, note). It is, furthermore, roughly indicated by the dates of his campaigns in Syria (11,409 ff.), which, as we know, always occurred from April to October. His son Amenhotep II's campaigns carry the divergence a little farther, and some 150 years later its continuance is shown by the dates of Ramses 11's campaigns (111, 307). For nearly six centuries after this we have no indication of the place of the calendar,b but in the third year of Shabataka, about 700 B. C., the first day of high Nile is recorded at Thebes as occurring on the fifth of the ninth month of the calendar (IV, 887). The calendar had thus com- pleted its revolution around the seasons, and had also shifted nearly 180 days in another revolution, since the reign of Thutmose 111. The shift of the calendar can thus be traced for some 2,000 years, as determined by six different dates of astronomical or seasonal events, and a series of other significant occurrences, in terms of the calendar. \" Calendar of Papyrus Ebers. bThe date of the high water in the reign of Osorkon 11, in the Twenty-second Dynasty (IV, 742 ff.), will be of assistance when the correct date is known; but as given by Daressy (Recueil, 18, 181) it has certainly been incorrectly transliterated from the hieratic. The calendar of Ramses I11 (largely copied from an almost completely lost original of Ramses 11), which places the Rising of Sothis on New Year's Day, is of course a normal calendar intended to avoid constant readjusting of its long list of dates from time to time. Such a calendar of feasts could be per- petually used without alteration, by merely allowing in each date for the then amount of the divergence. cThe conjecture (eo ips0 very improbable) that the calendar was at irregular intervals readjusted to the astronomical year, is completely disproved by the pro- cession exhibited by the above series."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"30 CHRONOLOGY [Q 44 44. These data are of significance and value in two respects. In the first place, they demonstrate the very early advance of the Egyptians in the discernment and calculation of astronomical and calendrical phenomena. For we know from the use of the Egyptian year by classic astronomers and mathematicians that the calendar coincided with the Sothic year, and that a new Sothic cycle began, some time in the period 14o/41 to 143/44 A. D.\" It must therefore also have coincided with the Sothic year 1,460 years earlier; that is, in 1320 B. C.; and still earlier, in 2780 B. C.b NOW, it is impossible that this calendar was first introduced so late as the twenty-eighth century, in the midst of the highest culture of the Old Kingdom. More- over, the five intercalary days at the end of the year, proving the use of the shifting year of 365 days, are mentioned in the pyramid texts, which are far older than the Old Kingdom. 45. The calendar, therefore, existed before the Old Kingdom; but if this be true, we must seek its invention at a time when its three seasons coincided roughly with those of nature, as they must have done at its introduction. This carries us 1,460 years back of their coincidence in the Old Kingdom; that is, the calendar was introduced in the middle of the forty-third century B. C. (4241 B. C.). This is the :,oldest fixed date in history. This fact demonstrates not only a remarkable degree of scientific knowledge in that remote age, but also stable political conditions, and a wide recognition of central authority, which could gradually introduce such an innovation. .The date employed was that for the rising of Sothis in the latitude of Memphis or the southern Delta, and this fact is a significant indication of the high culture prevailing in the north at this time.\" acensorinus, 21, 10, and Meyer, op. cit., 28. bFor convenience, ignoring the uncertainty of four years. cSee Meyer, op. cit., gXff."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"461 CHRONOLOGY 31 46. In a second respect the calendar is of inestimable value to us in establishing the chronology of Egyptian history. Where the heliacal.rising of Sothis is recorded in terms of the calendar, it is a matter of the simplest arithmetica to determine, within a margin of four years, in what year B. C. the rising occurred. As we have seen, three such dates are preserved to us, two of which each give the year of the king's reign, and from these the entire Twelfth Dynasty, and the reign of Amenhotep I in the Eighteenth Dynasty, are established within four years in terms B. C. They show that the Twelfth Dynasty began in 2000 B. C., and the reign of Amenhotep I in 1557 B. C., thus determining the accession of the Eighteenth Dynasty as 1580 B.

C. fell within his reign. This approxi- mation may be rendered precise by a computation based upon the feasts of the New Moon, which Thutmose I11 is recorded to have celebrated in his twenty-third and twenty- fourth years (11, 430). These new-moon datesc establish the date of Thutmose 111's reign as May 3, 1501, to March 17, 1447 B. C.d The two other early dates are chiefly of aThus: The rising of Sothis at the beginning occurs on the first day of the calendar year. From a given calendar date of its rising the amount of the shift of the calendar can be computed in an instant. In the 120th year of the Twelfth Dynasty Sothis arose 225 days after New Year's Day. As the shift occurred at the rate of one day in four years, the 225 days' shift had taken place in 900 years since the calendar coincided with nature; that is, since 2780 B. C. The 120th year of the Twelfth Dynasty was thus 1880 B. C., and the dynasty began in 2000 B. C. (or between 2000 and 1996 B. C.). bMeyer, op. cit., 46 ff. CThe phases of the moon occupy the same position in the calendar every nine- teen years. The date of Thutmose 111's reign being roughly determined by the Sothic rising, the new-moon dates can then be employed to place this reign more precisely.

The result thus obtained, without reference to the astronomically determined dates, can then be com- pared with these, for the sake of testing both. The dates by dead reckoning are obtained by simply adding together the totals of reigns and dynasties, and with these reckoning back from the accession of the Persians in 525 B. C. In this process I have employed only the testimony of the con- temporary monuments. a 48. Our first task is to determine the length of the dynas- ties preceding the invasion of the Persians; that is, the Eighteenth to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. The method is first to seek the highest known date in each reign of a dynasty, and thus to determine the minimum length of the dynasty. In the use of royal dates given in years of the reign only, there is danger both of over- and of under-reckoning. Thus Ramses I11 reigned thirty-one years and forty days; but a date from his thirty-second year might lead one to think he had reigned thirty-two years, which is nearly a year in excess of the truth. As the newly crowned successor to the throne began to number his years from the death of his predecessor, it will be seen that the remainder of what would have been Ramses 111's complete thirty-second year is included in the reign of his ~uccessor.~ If counted in both reigns, it is therefore counted twice. It has therefore awherever he can be controlled, Manetho is generally wrong in his figures, and any chronology based on his data is hopelessly astray. bThis is supposing that, as in the Eighteenth Dynasty, the years of a king began with the day of his accession, and not on the New Year's Day preceding his accession, as in the Middle Kingdom and the Twenty-sixth Dynasty."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"9 491 CHRONOLOGY 33 been thought necessary to deduct one year for every trans- fer of the crown.a This method, however, is extreme, as we shall show. In the first place, it applies only when the maximum date preserved is actually the respective king's last year. Again, it does not always apply even then. Thutmose I11 reigned fifty-four years lacking thirty-four days. The reign of his successor, therefore, included only the last thirty-four days of what would have been Thut- mose 111's complete fifty-fourth year. To deduct a year at this transfer of the crown is as extreme as to count the thirty-second year of Ramses 111's reign. It is evident that the last year of a king's reign is as likely to be nearly complete as it is to be scarcely begun; hence the only fair method of reduction for double counting at the transfers of the crown is to count the number of transfers in an entire dynasty, and for each transfer to deduct a half-year; that is, a mean between the two extremes of deducting a whole year for each transfer, or of deducting nothing. In the course of a whole dynasty the errors both ways will probably compensate each other. 49. In the following table I have made no deduction for transfer of the crown either to or from a king from whose reign we have no dates, but in all such reigns (marked x) such deduction has been included in the estimate of the reign. It is needless to add that in cases of coregency such deduction is unnecessary. In estimating the x, or unknown years in a given reign, the historical facts of the reign, if any, have been duly considered, though there has not always aMahler, Zeitschrijt jur agyptische Sprache, 32, 104 f.; Lehmann, Zwei Hauptprobleme, 56. bThis method can apply with certainty only in the Eighteenth Dynasty, in which the king's year begins with his accession.

It should be noted, however, that the above date for the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty, based upon the Sothic date in the ninth year of Amenhotep I, is corroborated, not only by the above dead reckoning, but also by the Sothic and new-moon dates in the reign of Thutmose 111, a calculation from which places this king's reign at just the right remove from that of Amenhotep I, as determined by the Sothic date (see $46). 52. The existing contemporary monuments do not suffice to determine by dead reckoning the length of the obscure period which preceded the Eighteenth Dynasty, including the Hyksos. It should be noted, however, that these monu- ments do not indicate a longb period. They are few and scanty. There is nothing to show that the long list of kings which the Turin Papyrus places in this period were not partially contemporaneous. The same document gives no indication in its enumeration of the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty that they were partially contemporary; and it is only in the sum-total of the dynasty that parallel years are deducted.

Its beginning, in Manetho's so-called Seventh Dynasty, is hopelessly obscure, but fortunately the time during which this Seventh Dynasty ruled, as well as the length of the Eighth Dynasty also, is included by the Turin Papyrus in a summation of the time which elapsed from the rise of the Sixth Dynasty to the fall of Memphis (180 year^),^ and also in a grand total of the length of the whole period from the accession of Menes to the close of Memphite supremacy, which terminated with the fall of the Eighth Dynasty. The Heracleopolitan rule, which falls between the end of Memphite and the beginning of Theban domination, is therefore the uncertain factor. Manetho divides the Hera- cleopolitans into two dynasties, the Ninth and the Tenth.

It will be evident that this estimate is extremely uncertain. The period is the only undetermined epoch in the dynastic chronology, and it introduces a margin of uncertainty of several genera- tions in all dates back of the Eleventh Dynasty. 54. The Turin Papyrus gives the length of the Sixth Dynasty (with which it merges the Eighth, ignoring the Seventhb) as 181 years. The length of the Fourth and Fifth together is determined by the Turin Papyrus and the con- temporary monuments as follows: The royal favorite Mertitybtes, after having been in the harem of Snefru and Iihufu successively, was still living under Khafre (§§ 188 ff.). Prince Sekhemkere lived under Khafre, Men- kure, Shepseskaf, Userkaf, and Sahure.\" With Snefru counted in the Third Dynasty, and Userkaf and Sahure (together nineteen yearsd) falling in the Fifth, the length of the Fourth cannot have been more than 150 years, as meas- ured by part of two successive human lives. A third lifetime connects the latter part of the Fourth and the first part of the Fifth. Thus Ptahshepses, the son-in-law of aThe Fourth and Fifth Dynasties (including Snefru at the beginning of the Fourth) show an average of 16.6 years for each ruler (Meyer, op. cit., 15 I); that is, 18 kings ruled 300 years. Again, at the beginning of the dynastic age 18 kings (First and Second Dynasties) ruled 420 years-an average of over 23 years each. The first 53 kings of the Turin Papyrus (from the First to the Eighth Dynasty) ruled 995 years-an average of nearly 19 years.

The Turin Papyrus has preserved the length of the reigns at the end of the Fifth Dynasty from Nuserre on, making a total, including him, of about IOO years. If Ptahshepses sur- vived 10 years under Nuserre, the length of the dynasty was at most 130 years, more probably 125 years.

Now, it is practically certain that the total of 955 years on a fragment of the Turin Papyrus is a summary of the same period; belonging at the end of the Memphite kings. Deducting the length of the Memphite dynasties (535 years) from this total of 955 years, we have left 420 years for the preceding Thinite period (First and Second Dynasties), just as shown by the Palermo Stone. We thus reach the date 3400 B. C. for the beginning of the dynasties, and 3400 to 2980 B. C. as the Thinite age, the first two dynasties. It is highly improbable that future discovery will shift these dates more than a century in either direction. 57. To recapitulate, in the following table it should be remembered that the dates in the Twelfth Dynasty are astronomically computed and correct within three years. The early part of the Eighteenth is closely correct (all dates astronomically established are starred), and the latter part probably within a decade of error. The margin of error is doubtless somewhat greater between the close of the Eight- eenth and the accession of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, where the dates are again accurate.

Lehmann thus dated the accession of Thut- mose I11 in 1515 (Zwei IiTauptprobleme, 154-58). Meyer accepted Lehmann's method, but showed a slight error in L.'s figures, thus finally placing the date of Thutmose 111's accession in 1501 B. C. (Meyer, op. cit., 50).

As it is evident that Harmhab was not a young man at his accession, it is exceedingly improbable that he reigned nearly 60 years. The highest known date on any monument of his reign is year 21. It is therefore probable that in the early Nineteenth Dynasty, when the chronology for the government files of the immediately preceding reigns was being made up, the series of Ikhnaton and his successors was added to the reign of Harmhab, and the names of the kings at any time implicated in the Aton heresy were swept from the records. We thus have at least 59 years from year I of Ikhnaton to the end of Harmhab's reign, of which at least 25 must be credited to Ikhnaton and his successors (Zeitschrift fiir iigyptische Sprache, 39, IO,~. 8).

They reveal a great and powerful kingdom from the beginning of the dynasties, enjoying ordered government under a highly developed and aggres- sive state, and exhibiting a high degree of culture and civili- zation such as we could not have anticipated in this remote age. 77.

The fragment herewith presented was broken out of the middle of a large slab some seven feet long and over two feet high, as it stood on the long edge. It was inscribed on both sides with a series of royal annals, beginning with the predynastic kings of the period before the union of the North and the South, and continuing into the dynastic age to the middle of the Fifth Dynasty. The arrangement of these records can be best understood from the figure (-). The upper line of the front contains at present nine names of predynastic kings of Lower Egypt (the Delta).a If the line was full, there were possibly some 120 predynastic kings here enumerated, each rectangle of line I (front) containing one name, with no indication of how long each king reigned.b In the Fifth Dynasty, therefore, the predynastic kings, the last of whom had reigned some seven centuries before the preparation of this table, were already merely a series of names. Other reasons for the mere citation of the bare names are, however, quite conceivable, such as lack of interest in the predynastic kings on the part of the scribe. 79. But, while the length of the predynastic reigns re- mains totally uncertain, the date of the beginning of the dynastic period is certainly established by this monument within narrower limits than ever before; and the period from the accession of Menes to the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty is determined within reasonable margins for the first time. The dynastic kings are probably arranged as aMeyer has identified the place of these kings of Lower Egypt in the Turin Papyrus, where no corresponding kings of Upper Egypt were included, and in Manetho (Aegyptische Chronologie, 1-99 ff., 203 f.).

The larger part of the back was occupied with the three reigns of the Fifth Dynasty, which filled up 11. 2-5, and perhaps con- tinued (in two lines) into the reign of Nuserre. 80. The arrangement of each 'reign (except 1. I, front) was so that in the narrow horizontal space above each line the name-of the king was placed, while below it the years of his reign were distributed in successive rectangles, one year in each rectangle. As the space occupied by the years of each reign far exceeded the length of the king's name, the latter was placed over the middle, thus: KING'S NAME Year I Year I Year I Year / Year I Year 1 Year I Year I Year / 81. The vertical line on the right of each rectangle has the form of the hieroglyphic sign for \"year.\" Each year-rectangle contains the chief events which occurred in that year, one of which furnished the official name for that year.

This was parallel with the same usage in early Babylonia, as has been long known. As time passed, it became more and more common to name the year after the corresponding fiscal enumeration, thus: \" Year of the Second Occurrence of the Numbering of all Large and Small Cattle of the North and the South\" (8 339), or \" Year of the Seventh Occurrence of the Numbering of Gold and Lands\" (front, 1. 5, $135). This was often abbreviated to \"Year of the x'th Occurrence of the Num- bering,\" or still more to \" Year of the x'th Occurrence.\" 82. All other events were then gradually abandoned as designations of the years, and by the Fifth Dynasty the fiscal numberings were almost exclusively used. These occurred every two years, in uninterrupted sequence, irrespective of the changes in reign, and hence it was necessary to call a year when no numbering took place, the \"Year after the x'th Occurrence (of the Numbering).\" Filially, when the numberings became annual, each year received the name of a new numbering, and this was the system of dating in Egypt from the Sixth Dynasty on. It amounted to num- bering the years themselves, and gradually became nothing else. The Palermo stone thus furnishes us the origin of the Egyptian system of dating. 83. In addition to the chief events of the year, each year- rectangle contained, at the bottom in the middle, a datum giving a number of cubits, palms, and fingers, which have been thought to be the height of the inundation. for each year; but this is very uncertain. aMeasured from some fixed point only a few cubits below high water; but the fine subdivisions in the measurements (down to fractions of a finger-breadth) are against the theory."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"9 861 PALERMO STONE 5 5 84. In 11. 2-5 (front), containing the First and Second Dynasties, the events of each year are for the most part celebrations of religious feasts and the like, and in the latter part the \"nuwberi.ngs\" appear. With the Third Dynasty (1. 6) the events known to the chronicler become more numerous, increasing and making irregular in size the year- rectangles. They become still larger in the Fourth and Fifth. Small as are the rectangles of the First and Second Dynasties, they are in each line of the same size, and this offers the basis for a rough estimate of the number of years in these dynasties, if we can gain even a distant approxima- tion of the total length of the stone. 85. An examination of the back shows that from one- tenth to one-eighth of the total length of the lines is pre- served on the fragment. This insures roughly five hundred years for the length of the first three dynasties, of which only about eighty would belong to the Third Dyna~ty.~ 86. In this computation the stone offers little for deter- mining the length of the Third Dynasty. This is, however, shown by the Turin Papyrus to have been only fifty-five years before Snefru; or, with Snefru, seventy-nine years, x months; or, in round numbers, eighty years.

It should be remembered that this difficulty with the Third Dynasty is not peculiar to any theory of restoration of the stone. We cannot, on any scheme of restoration, push the Third Dynasty back into 1. 5 (front), for the birth of Khase- khemui, a king of the latter part of the Second Dynasty, is recorded in 1. 5 (No. 4). Nor can we assume that Snefru is here reckoned with the Fourth Dynasty, which would leave only the first half of 1. 6 for the whole Third Dynasty. Finally, as Snefru is reckoned with the Third Dynasty, and we know that he was its last king (for he was the prede- cessor of Khufu), all his predecessors in the dynasty, as well as at least six years of his own reign, must have been included in the first half of 1. 6. If all the rectangles of the first half of 1. 6 were as small as those of 1. 2, this would leave perhaps fifty years for his predecessors in the dynasty. The suppo- sition that more lines are lost at the bottom would not at all affect the Third Dynasty. Again, any great prolongation of the lines is forbidden by the back. 87. The stone offers little aid as to the length of the Fourth Dynasty, as most of that dynasty is lost at the bot- 'tom of the front, but it furnishes valuable hints as to the close of the Fourth and the first half of the Fifth Dynasty. The short reigns at the close of the Fourth are fragmentarily indicated in 1. I, and the lengths of the short reigns of the first three kings of the Fifth Dynasty roughly corroborate those indicated in the Turin Papyrus. 88. It will be seen that the monument is invaluable as a source for the chronology of the earliest dynasties. Accept- ing 2900 B. C. as the date for the accession of the Fourth Dynasty, the Palermo Stone furnishes us an assured mini- mum of 3400 B. C. as the beginning of the dynastic period and the accession of Menes.

We have thus the double name of a double palace, which, like the organs of the government, was double, to correspond with the old kingdoms of South and North. These two gates are still preserved in the palace of the Empire as seen in the Amarna tombs. The palace front was always referred to as the \"double facade\" or \"double gate\" (Rwty) ; hence also the dual determina- tive of pr-c>. The state temples also were double; each had a \"double fa~ade,\" and the hypostyle was divided into north and south by the central aisle. The division of the palace audience hall will have been the same.

Although the Pharaohs had operated in the copper region of Sinai as far back as the First Dynasty, Snefru was later regarded as the great founder of the Egyptian mining there. He became a patron god of the region (Q 722), he gave his name to the roads and stations of the eastern Delta (Q 493, 1. g), and officials boasting of their achievements there claimed that nothing like them had been done since the time of Snefru (8 731). Being the only existing inscriptional record of achieve- ment by Snefru, this document is of especial impor- tance. The relief to which the inscriptions belong is as important as they. It represents the king in the etef-crown, with upraised war-club about to smite a Bedwi, whom he has forced to kneel, holding him by the hair of his head.b This, of course, symbolizes Snefru's victory over the Bedwin of this region, during his mining operations here. 169.

It is impossible to determine with certainty the succession of the parts dis- tributed on the different walls, and the language is so bald, abbreviated, and obscure that some of the narrative remains unintelligible. Apart from the fact that it is our earliest document of the kind, and the only one from the Third Dynasty, the biography is especially valuable because it deals with the geography and government of the North, narrating RIethen's activity in the Delta, of the administra- tion of which at this earl$ period we otherwise know almost nothing. The narrative tells of his gradual rise, from a beginning as scribe and overseer of a provision magazine, until he governs a considerable number of towns and dis- tricts in the Delta. He also obtained in Upper Egypt the rule of the eastern part of the Fayum and the Anubis nome (Seventeenth). He was liberally rewarded with gifts of lands, became master of the hunt, and tells us the size of his house, with some account of the grounds; all of which, from an age so remote, is of especial interest. He died in the reign of Snefru; all his affiliations were with the families preced- ing Snefru, and he was naturally buried beside the terraced pyramid of Zoser, of the earlier part of the Third Dynasty. aIn the palace fa~ade, the so-called \"banner.\" bWeill, Sinai, 104. cFrom his mastaba-chamber, found by Lepsius at Sakkara, and now in Berlin (Nos.

The income from the land was also divided, each of the eleven children receiving the income from five stat for the Hathor temple, and five stat for Khenuka, while the remaining two each received half of this. The twelve months of the year were thus all provided for, the sixty stat belonging to each endow- ment were completely disposed of, and the thirteen children all made legatees.

The king has a case of medical rolls brought; but all is in vain; the physicians declare his condition hopeless. The king is smitten with sorrow, and retires to his chamber, where he prays to Re.

We have here then the first symptoms from which the belief in the sacredness of whole classes of animals (as opposed to one member only) afterward grew up. The same thing in a later stage is observable in the Saite time.

Pepi I promoted the obscure under-custodian of the royal domains, to be a judge of the Nekhen court; at the same time giving him rank among the courtiers and an income as inferior prophet of the pyramid-temple. As judge he soon gained the confidence of his superiors. The king granted him the equipment for his tomb, which was brought from the Troja quarry for him, and then promoted him to a superior custodianship of the royal domain. He rapidly gained royal favor, and when it became necessary to prosecute one of the king's wives, probably for conspiracy, he was chosen to hear the case with only one colleague. He was then called upon to organize an army for a cam- paign against the Bedwin north of Sinai, and five times he was sent to quell revolts in this region. He finally pushed up into southern Palestine, which is the first Egyptian invasion of that country known in history."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"6 3091 INSCRIPTION OF UNI 141 Appointment as Judge 307.

The first half, now no longer legible, must have contained the narrative of an expedition into Nubia by Sebni's father, Mekhu. On this expedition Mekhu in some way meets his death.a Here the surviving portion of the inscription begins; information of Mekhu's death is brought to his son Sebni, and he sets out with troops and IOO asses, laden with presents to rescue his father's body for embalm- ment; otherwise of course there would be no life hereafter for Mekhu (11.1-3). He sent messengers to the king to inform promised (1887) soon to publish the long text. It was finally published (1893) by de Morgan (Catalogue des monuments, 147, 14, but his copyists have clearly spent no time on the difficult collation, and the publication is unusable; the inscrip- tion has never been translated or treated. The long text occupies nineteen columns on the right of the door; these are the continuation from the beginning on the left of the door, which has now unfortunately almost totally disappeared. The nineteen columns are crossed by six wide horizontal cracks, some of which were filled up and did not interrupt the scribe's writing, and some of which he jumped over. It is always a question whether the crack has caused a lacuna, e. g., in 11. 11-17 in the third crack from the top there are no lacunae. Moreover, the whole text is very badly weathered, and one can sit for hours pouring over one line in vary- ing lights, without being certain of the reading. The accompanying translation is based on my copy of the Berlin squeezes, collated with Erman's collation of the original; Erman and I then spent an entire day going over the doubtful passages in the squeezes together, and it is to be hoped that the text is now fixed. Sethe has since published all our readings and his own collation of the squeeze (Urkun- den, I, 135-40). aIt is certainly remarkable that of the three narrative inscriptions of Assuan, two contain accounts of the death of a nobleman on a foreign expedition and the rescue of the body: Mekhu in Nubia and Enenkhet on the northern shores of the Red Sea (8 360). For the tomb of an Egyptian buried in Sinai, see Borchardt, Zeitschrift fiir agyptische Sprache, 1897, 112.

On reaching Wawat again, he sent the officer Iri and two companions to the court with some of the native products which his father had acquired (11. 6, 7). They were evidently instructed to return with embalmers and equipment for embalming the deceased Mekhu, for as Sebni descended the river he met Iri returning from the court with all the people and paraphernalia necessary for the embalm- ment (11. 8-10). Iri brought also written instructions from the king to Sebni, containing promises of great reward for his pious deed (11. 1-12). Sebni then buried his father and proceeded to Memphis with the Nubian products which his father had gotten (11. 12, 13). He was highly praised by the king, and given very rich gifts (11. 14-16).

It is possible that he had not at first received the Thinite nome, and that on his marriage, he went to the Cerastes-Mountain first, as his only nome, and remained there even after his appointment to the Thinite nome. But it is his office in the latter of which he is most proud. 376.

Because of his beneficent rule his son, when a child, succeeded him without opposition (11. 13-15). On his (Tefibi's) first cam- paign, the southern nomes from Elephantine to an uncertain point on the north were united against him (1. 16). He defeated them first on the west shore, driving them as far as \"the fortress of the port of the South\" (Abydos ? 11. 16-18). He then crossed to the east shore, where he defeated a second army of the enemy (11. 19-22) and also discom- fited a hostile fleet (11. 23, 24). He thus suppressed rebel- lion and had opportunity to promote deserving officers (11. 25-27).

Now, the Theban king, Intef (Horus: W3 h crib), states that he captured all of the Thinite (Abydos) nome, and \"opened alC her fortresses\" ($423), using the very word for fortress (yth) employed in 1. 18, above. He also made the Aphroditopolite nome (just north of the Thinite nome) \"the door of the North\" (ibid.). Remembering that Tefibi's campaign is thus far confined to the west shore, one would suspect that Tefibi's \"port of the South\" is Intef's \"door of the North.\" All the indications, therefore, point to this region as the southern extremity of Tefibi's campaign. iWith the determinative of a person."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"0 3981 INSCRIPTIONS OF SIUT 183 Dowith another army from his confederacy.

After some references to Kheti's services to the king, Merikere (11. I-7), and the ancient origin of Kheti's family (11. 7-9), it is stated that he has chastised Middle Egypt for the king's sake (1. IO), a clear indication of insur- rection within the Heracleopolitan kingdom. This trouble quelled, Kheti conducts the king up-river, probably to receive the homage of the kingdom, which, including the nobles of Ehnas, was in great fear, as Kheti's enormous fleet passed up (11. 10-15). Returning to Ehnas-Heracleopolis, the king is received with acclamation by old and young (11. 16, I 7). Kheti now returns to his home and is commissioned to restore the ancient temple of Upwawet, which, at the present day, lies somewhere beneath the modern buildings of Siut (11. 17-31). The people lived in peace and security during the remainder of Kheti's reign (11. 31-34). 399. Of the first seven lines only the upper portion (from a third to a half line) is preserved.

It is impossible that the fleet should have been 125 miles long. More- over, the direction of the fleet's movement (1. so) is up-river, so that the rear must have been at a place below Sheshotep.

He dug a much-needed irrigation canal, conducting the water to land unreached by the inundation (11. 1-8). He was rich in grain, which he dispensed to the people (11. 9, 10). He remitted taxes (11. 10, II), and his herds greatly multi- plied (11. 11-14). He built in the temple, increased its offerings (11. 14-16), was a good soldier, and, as military com- mander of Middle Egypt, he raised a troop (11. 16-18); like Kheti I, he had a navy (11. 18, 19).

The plan of these volumes does not include dynastic discussion, but a few reasons must nevertheless be bffered for the order of the kings here adopted. a Any arrangement of the Eleventh Dynasty must proceed from the fact that the war between the Heracleopolitans and Thebans was still going on in the reign of Horus-Wahenekh-Intef. Now, a great-grandson of a Thinite official of this king erected his tombstone at Abydos in the thirty-third year of Sesos- tris I ($§ 529 ff.). It was therefore not less than four genera- tions from the reign of the said Intef to the thirty-third year of Sesostris I. Allowing 40 years to the generation, this period was some 160 years in length, of which 53 years fell in the Twelfth Dynasty. The close of this Intef's reign was therefore not later than about IOO years before the accession of the Twelfth Dynasty. The war between Thebes and the North, therefore, continued perhaps as late as IOO years before the accession of the Twelfth Dynasty, and Wahenekh- Intef's accession was not later than 150 years before the end of the Eleventh Dynasty, as we know that he reigned at least 50 years ($423). 416. Now, theTurin Papyrus gives 160 years as the length of the Eleventh Dynasty, which corresponds admirably with the above result, viz., that the Eleventh Dynasty must have succeeded the Heracleopolitans at the latest 150 years before the rise of the Twelfth Dynasty. The Turin Papyrus had aOther indications will be found in connection with the following translations. See also my essay, \"New Light on the History of the Eleventh Dynasty,\" American Journal of Semitic Languages, XXI, 163 ff. bThe number is 160+x, the x not being more than 9 years, of course. That this total refers to the Eleventh Dynasty is perfectly certain; it immediately pre- cedes the heading of the Twelfth Dynasty, and does not reach back to a beginning point behind the Eleventh Dynasty, because there is a summation preceding the seven kings of the Eleventh Dynasty.

The last king, whose name is lost, was, of course, one who ruled the whole country, and whose reign shows no trace of war with the North. Among the remaining kings of the time the only one who clearly fulfils these conditions is Nibtowere-Mentuhotep. The second half of the dynasty is thus fairly certain. Working back from Nibkhrure-Mentuhotep, we find that he was suzerain of a vassal king, Intef ($424), giving us then an Intef and three Mentuhoteps as the order of this group, thus: Intef (other names unknown), Nibkhrure-Mentuhotep, Senekhkere-Mentuhotep, Nibtowere-Mentuhotep. 417. The first and second of these three Mentuhoteps reigned not less than 74 years.a The third had a prosper- ous reign, as the inscriptions of his second year in ~a&a- mat show; so that the above three Mentuhoteps may easily have reigned in all 80 years, and the whole group more than this. Now, Horus-Wahenekh-Intef was still reigning some IOO years before the end of the dynasty. He therefore did not long precede the above group of four. But he never ruled north of Abydos, for on his tombstone in his fiftieth year he tells of having established his northern frontier there ($423), and his treasurer, Thethi, corroborates this ($ 423D). He must therefore have preceded Nibhotep- Mentuhotep, who openly boasts of having gained the Two Lands by conquest. But as Wahenekh-Intef was succeeded by his son, a second Intef, both these Intefs must have pre- ceded Nibhotep-Mentuhotep, forming a group of three which evidently immediately preceded the above group of four.

The publications are all very inaccurate; Prisse being probably the best. I had my own copy of the original in the Bibliotheque Nationale. That there may have been a series of Theban kings preceding the list of the dynasty as given in the Turin Papyrus, is perhaps probable, in view of the Intefs and the Mentuhotep who follow the nomarch Intef in the Karnak list. bsteindorff has shown that we have contemporary monuments from only three Intefs before the Twelfth Dynasty (besides the nomarch, Zeitschriit f6r agyptische Sprache, 1895, 77-96). No one without preconceived opinions will appeal to the Karnak list to prove that the Intefs all ruled before the Twelfth Dynasty. If we are to depend on the Karnak list, then Sesostris I ruled immediately before or after the Seventeenth Dynasty! And such absurdities abound in this list. But accept- ing this preposterous list as usable, we find that it puts Nb-bpr (w)-Rec, Intef either just before or just after the Seventeenth Dynasty. Hence Petrie's state- ment (History of Egypt, I, gth ed., xxi) that \"the ancient lists are entirely against\" the above arrangement of the Intefs must be rejected.

The hero, Sinuhe, a noble of high rank, is with the young coregent, Prince Sesostris I, in the western Delta, on a campaign against the Libyans, when the message announc- ing the death of the old king, Amenemhet I, reaches the camp. Sesostris I does not allow the news to be made public, but secretly returns to the royal residence, in order firmly to establish himself as king before any pretender can precede him. Sinuhe accidentally overhears the message, and, evidently for political reasons, immediately flees the country, making Palestine his goal. Here he spends many years, experiencing manifold adventures, until in old age, after becoming rich and powerful, he is pardoned by Sesostris I, and permitted to return to Egypt. 488. The date of Amenemhet's death, given in the tale as in the thirtieth year of his reign, is corroborated by the monuments, where his highest date is also the thirtieth year;a hence the introductory narrative may probably be accepted as essentially historical.

In form the inscription was a poem, and its lines have been separated by the scribe by red dots, as usual in the Empire. The content is obscured by elaborate phraseology, but its drift is nevertheless evident. In his third year Sesostris I called together his court, and an- nounced his purpose of erecting a temple to the sun-god at Heliopolis ($0 501-3). The court responds with the con- ventional encomium (§ 504), and the king then deputes the treasurer to undertake the building (5 505). An interval of time having elapsed of which there is no indication in the narrative, the ground plan of the building is laid out with the customary ceremony ($506).

Legal documents from civil, as distinguished from criminal, processes of early Egypt are so rare, and the con- tracts of Hepzefi also throw so much light on both political and social conditions in the Middle Kingdom, that it seemed - necessary to include them in these historical translations. They offer nothing in the political history of the family of the Siut nobles, and it is not possible to connect the nomarch, Hepzefi, in any way with the earlier generations, known to us at Siut in the Tenth and Eleventh Dynasties (4 391). He doubtless marks a new family installed here by the power- ful Twelfth Dynasty, in preference to the earlier family, which had been friendly to the northern dynasty. The ten contracts were made solely to secure to Hepzefi, after his death, certain ceremonies and offerings from the priesthoods of Siut. Similar contracts were customarily made with the priests of Abydos. Mentuhotep and Sehe- tepibre, nobles of the same time, say on their Abydos tomb- stones: \" I gave contracts for the remuneration of the prophets of Abyd~s\"~ ($ 746). The kings did the same ($765). 536. The form of the contracts is sufficiently clear; but the language is very involved, and burdened with an excess of relative clauses.

It is unnecessary to refer to the earlier publications, as Mr. Griffith has collated them all. The first adequate treatment was that of Erman, written, unfortunately, before the appearance of Mr. Griffith's text (Zeit- schrift fur iigyptische Sprache, 1882, 159-84), which fact necessitated leaving some obscure passages unrendered.

Two facts in the socio-political organization of the time are brought out by these contracts: (I) The property of the prince was held under two different titles, viz., (a) by inheritance from his father, the property being called the '' pater~zal estate \" (nw-pr-yt), which he could bequeath at will; and (b) by virtue of his appoint~nenta as \"count\" (h' ty- ') by the king, the property being called the \" cou?zt7s estate\" (pr-;Tz' ty- C), which he could not legally bequeath. The distinction between these two estates is clearly main- tained throughout, and whenever Hepzefi bequeathes any- thing from his \"count's estate\" he concedes that such a title can endure only so long as his successors are willing to recog- nize it, and by appeal to the common feeling in such matters, he urges his successors to recognize it (e. g., O 547,ll. 280,281) (2) There are in the contracts four classes of society: the '(count \" (6 ty- '), or nomarch ; the official (Sr) ; the \"citize~z \" (n&, lit., \"the small \"), and the \"peasant\" (yC;Tzty), lit., \" belonging to the field,\" enumerated in descending scale. The interrelations of the four are not wholly discernible. The \"citize~z,\" like the count, gives to the temple from fields called \"his field,\" which he therefore either owned or held in rental. The peasant is called \"his (the citizen's) peasant,\" and may therefore have been his serf or slave. He culti- vated the field for the citizen, and carried the harvest offer- ing to the temple for him (cf. 11. 280, 281). The \"oficial\" (Sr) may have been of the same social class as the \"citizen.\" The importance of these contracts in a study of the mortuary customs and beliefs is evident, but a discussion of aOn such appointment by the king, see 8 385."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"260 TWELFTH DYNASTY: SESOSTRIS I ED 537 these questions does not fall within the scope of the present translations. a 537.
