[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Gerald Masse y's Lectures FORWARD Gerald Massey, a man o f many talents, d istinguished h im self as a social reformer, a poet and an Egyptologist. His fame rested mainly on the six monu mental volumes in which h e dealt at l ength on the mythology and religion o f Ancient Egypt, and on h is poetry. Althou gh h e was a ca pable lecturer, the lectures were not widely circulated, and were privately printed in an ob scure volume. It is tim ely that this valuable c ollection is once again p resented to Massey's increasing pub l ic. Relatively littl e is kno wn o f Massey's career. His humble birth at Gamble Wharf, Hertfordshire, England in 1829 h eld scant promi se for the future. His parents were illit erate -- his father was a poo rly paid canal boatm an. His own early education was meag er. Only occa sionally was the youn g Massey able to attend the neighbo ring schoo l, for which h e paid on e penny a week. From t he a ge of eight he labored twelve hou rs a day. At first he found employment in a silk mill . When it was destroyed b y fire, h e worked as a straw - plaiter. Doub tless there were many such jobs until at fifteen h e went to London as an errand bo y. Later he was fortunate e nou gh to b ecome a haberdasher's clerk. It i s evident t hat Massey im proved h is life a t every oppo rtunity. Not only did h is positions become more respon sible, bu t i n h is s pare tim e he read literature, and was inspired to write poetry. He e ven composed a popu lar song, which was s o well - rece ived that it was exhibited in a London shop windo w. In p assing the Editor of \"The Athenaeu m\", London 's most distinguished p eriodical, no ticed and bou ght a c opy. The song, \"The People's Advent,\" caught the Editor's fancy to the e xtent that the c omposer's name -- Gerald Massey -- remained in h is memory. A year later, h is book o f poetry readied for pu blication, Massey brought it with hop e a nd humilit y to the Editor of \"The Athenaeum.\" The Editor, recognizing the a uthor's name a s the c omposer of \"The People's Advent,\" was predisposed to like the poems before reading them. He wrote a brilli ant, laudatory review of the poetry. The book - sellers of London, im pressed b y the review ordered the book with no h esitation. In on e day the first edition was s old ou t. Gerald Massey beca me increasingly interested in Egyptology. He studied the e xtensive Egyptian records hou sed in the British Museum. He e ventually taught him self to d ecipher the hieroglyphics. Finally after many y ears of study he wrote a series of scholarly works on the Religion and Mythology of Ancient Egypt. In 1881 h e pub lished in two vo lumes \"A Book o f the Beginnings,\" in 1883 \"The Natural Genesis\" followed, and finally in 1907 h e pub lished in two vo lumes \"Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World,\"."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Through those long years of devoted study at the British Museum, Massey enjoyed the friendship and wise c ou nsel of Dr. Samuel Birch, an ou tstanding Egyptologist. He attracted a following of dedicated students, who later were privileged to assist in h is research. Two o f his most promi nent co - workers were George St. Clair who authored \"Creation Records Discovered in Egypt,\" and Dr. Albert Churchward, who wrote \"The Origin and Evolution o f the Human Race .\" When Massey lectured in America a nd Canada, h e found h im self surround ed with able students. Miss E. Valentia Straiton, author of \"The Celestial Ship o f the North ,\" and Dr. Alvin Boyd Kuhn, who wrote e xtensively on comparative religion. Dr. Kuhn ackno wledged that in Gerald Massey had b een a great inspiration to h im . In fact in h is posthumous work, \"A Rebirth for Christianity,\" Dr. Kuhn called attention to the great worth o f Massey's research on Christian o rigins, as follows: \"With b rilli ant scholarship and insight he pierced Egypt's enigmatic scriptology, and documented the provenance of both Old and New Testament lit erature from remote Egyptian sources. He forced u s to ask ho w the four Gospels of the Christian canon could be the biography of any Messianic personality living in the first Christian century, when he trace d their texts back to Egyptian do cuments that m ust have been v enerable e ven in 3500 B.C. \"We a re fa ced with the inescapable realization that if Jesus actually lived in the flesh in the first century A.D., and if he had b een able to read the documents of old Egypt, h e would h ave been amazed to find h is own b iography already substantially written some fou r or f ive thou sand years previously. Tertullian, Justin Martyr and o ther writers have noted that the leaders of the Christian movement confessed that m any of their doctrines, rites, creeds and symbols were identical with Egyptian antetypes. The late outsta nding American Egyptologist, James H. Breasted, found evidence of such simil arities between the Old Testament book, Proverbs, and addresses to the Pharaoh o f Egypt dating as far back as 3500 B.C. All t his confirms M assey's conclusions.\" (pp. 39 - 40) Gerald Massey so im pressed the nov elist, George Eliot, that she made him t he hero o f one of her f amous romances. Thus M assey beca me imm ortalized in literature a s \"Felix Holt t he Radical.\" Among Massey's American friends and admi rers was a promi nent New Y ork Jour nalist and pub lisher, D. M. Bernett. In the second edition o f his \"The World's Sages, Thinkers and Reformers\" on p age 967, Bernett says, \"Gerald Massey is a warm - hearted, genial m an, and as a c ompanion and friend h e has few superiors. His interests and inc entives are decidedly in the direction o f Science a nd Rationalism. He has many y ears been freed from t he binding and b linding theological creeds and ob ligations. He regards priestcraft as one of the great evils which mankind for thou sands of years have bee n compelled to endu re a nd suppo rt; and regards it as one of the most im portant works that m en o f the present tim e ca n engage in to d emolish the idols of the past dark ages; to liberate the mi nd from t he dwarfing and b lighting effect of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"pagan and Christian mythology and to d ispense with the officious and expensive services of a designing, u seless, aristocratic a nd wily priesthood.

He believes ignorance to b e the Devil, Science the Savior of the world.\" For those who finish the reading of these lectures and d esire a further acquaintance with the works of Gerald Massey, there a re his greater works beginning with \"Ancient Egypt, the Light of the World.\" INTRODU CTION Gerald Massey, thou gh a poet, Shakespearian scholar, and renowned Egyptologist, is best remembered b y his unswerving conv ictions. His research led h im t o the c onclusion that in Africa a lone c ould b e found the origins of myths, mysteries, symbols, languages and religions. Egypt was the mouthpiece . He did no t hesitate to und ertake to p rove that all Christendo m were the dup es of delusions. His zeal caused h im t o challenge the scientists, the theologian s, the philologists, the a nthropo logists and sociologists. However, h e did no t rest his case there. He was too much the hon est scholar f or that. Therefore, h e presented to h is peers the abund ant evidence resulting from his imm ense a moun t of research, which had b een sifted through the most reliable a uthorities. In these present l ectures Gerald Massey renewed h is contention that t he gnosis of Christianity was prim arily derived from Egypt on v arious lines of descent -- Hebrew, Persian, Greek, Alexandrian, Esseni an and Nazarene. These c onv erged in Rome where the history was manufactured from i dentifiable matter r ecorded in the a ncient Book o f Wisdom. It was during this period that he delivered the lecture on GNO STIC AND H ISTORIC CHRISTIAN ITY. He c learly depicts th e origin o f Christianity and makes it unequivocal that it was not derived from Buddh ism. Jesus s pok e repeatedly abou t the Father. Massey said, \"The Buddh a is the veiled God unv eiled, the unmanifested made manifest, bu t not by the line of descent from Fathe r to Son. Buddh a was begotten b y his own b ecomi ng before the tim e of divine paternity.\" Long before man u ttered a verbal prayer, h e e xpressed h im self by actions or gesture - language. Massey discussed this at l ength in MAN IN SEARC H O F HIS S OU L DU RING FIFTY THOU SAND Y EARS AND HO W HE FOUND IT. Present - day psychologists recognize gesture - language a s an indication o f man's true unexpressed attit udes, for unconsciously he a ssumes gestures revealing his thinking. The old clich√©, \"Actions s peak loud er than words,\" has come full circle a nd v indicated Massey. Massey had bu t one desire. He wanted to gain all t he kno wledge the past could afford him , and then to supp lement it with all t hat is kno wn in the present. He maintained it was"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"im possible to und erstand the presen t withou t a profound kno wledge of the past. Unless man comprehended the laws of evolution and p ast development, and o f present survival, it was im possible to form an op inion that would b e of value to anyone. With p atience a nd determi nation h e ca rried this out in all his writings. He had littl e patience with those who talked o f the great occult secrets. He was conv inced the so - called ancient m ysteries were manufactured b y pseudo - Esoterists and Occultists. The only interest Massey took in such matters was to determi ne how they had o riginated, to v erify their suppo sed ph enomena, and to ferret out their meaning. He insisted the need for mystery vanished with the c omi ng of the printing press and pub lic e xperim ental research. It beca me a passion with h im t o pub lis h the facts as he saw them, and then to distribute the kno wledge widely. In THE SEVEN SOU LS OF MAN , h e said, \"The modern manufacture of ancient m ysteries is a great im position, and sure to b e found ou t. The mysteries called Christian . . . I look upon them as the greatest im position o f all.\" His own meditation on facts of both abno rmal or extraordinary nature which continued and were verified ov er the years, p roved to h im t hat Mind existed and op erated invisibly. He did no t troub le a bou t \"the other world\" a t all, for it was in this world that people needed assistance. Life to h im was not worth living if something were not don e to further its work. \"It is only in h elping others that we ca n truly help ou rselves,\" said Mr. Massey in the lecture, THE DEVIL OF DA RKN ESS IN THE LIGH T OF EVO LUTION . To Gerald Massey it was an un forgiveable pretense for the c lergy to continue to p reac h that m an was a fallen creature. He c ontinually pointed ou t that m an could no t be saved through p rayful i ntercession. Every advance made by science for humanity had b een carried ou t through research and p erseverance -- not by praying to a jealous God. Massey proclaim ed, \"It is a sad farce for you to p ray for God to work a mi racle . . . when you are doing all you can to p revent it .\" Speaking of creation, h e saw it as beginning with the first m eans of measuring and recording a c ycle of tim e. In Genesis, the first day was measured b y the morning and the evening. To the present day tim e c ontinues to b e measured b y this identical m ethod. Through y ears of observation Massey recorded the outcome of such statements as, \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall i nherit t he ea rth.\" He c oncluded that the meek d id not inherit t he ea rth and were not abou t to. Teac hers had b een woefully mi staken and unob serving . The death o f Jesus could no t save man from him self. Massey was adamant in po inting out that m an was what he was as the result of what he had don e. There was no dod ging the law of cause a nd effect. One of Massey's greatest contributions is his lecture on THE COMING RELIGION . It is poignant with h is s incerity. He put his own b elief into every word. To h im eac h p erson must do h is own thinking and h ave a bsolute freedom of expression. He stressed that the new religion must have \"sincerity of life, in p lace of pretended b elief; a religion o f science, in p lace of superstiti on. \" This religion will proclaim m an's Ascent rather than h is Fall. It will be a religion o f fact in the present, no t of mere faith for the future. The temple"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"will be what it was intended to b e -- the human form rather than an edifice of brick and stone. It will be a religion o f acc omplishment, rather than o f worship; and in p lace of the many creeds, it will be a religion o f life. Abov e a ll it will be a joyous religion. To realize such a religion a man must be hon est and courageous as was Gerald Massey him self. His final plea in THE COMING RELIGION w as to u rge man to b ear in mi nd that the origin o f evil i n the moral domain was derived from i gnorance. It was Hermes who said, \"The wickedness of a so ul is its ignorance.\" To this Gerald Massey fitti ngly added that after gaining the c onsciousness to recognize the right, then it i s man's permi ssiveness that allows evil actions to take place . Sibyl Ferguson THE HISTORICAL JESUS AND M Y T H I C A L C H R I S T. ================ (All nece ssary references to the origina l au tho rities may be found in the Autho r's \"Natural Genesis.\" ================ In p resenting my readers with some of the data which show that m uch o f the Christian History was pre - extant as Eg yptian Mythology. I have to ask you to b ear in mi nd that the facts, like other f ound ations, h ave been bu ried ou t of sight for thou sands of years in a hieroglyphical language, that was never really read b y Greek o r Roman, and could no t be read un til t he los t clue was discovered b y Champollion, alm ost the other day! In this way the original sources of our Mytholatry and Christology remained as hidden as those of the Nile, un til t he ce ntury in which we live. The mystical m atter enshroud ed in this language was sacredly entrusted to the keeping of the buried d ead, who h ave faithfully preserved it as their Book o f Life, which was place d b eneath their pillows, o r clasped to their bosoms, in their coffins and their tombs. Second ly, althou gh I am able to read the hie roglyphics, no thing offered to you is based on my translation. I work too warily for that! The transcription and literal rendering of the hieroglyphic texts herein employed are by scholars of indisputable a uthority. There is no loopho le of escape that way. I lectured upon the subject of Jesus many y ears ago. At that tim e I did no t kno w how w e had b een mi sled, o r that the \"Christian scheme\" (as it i s aptly called) in the New Testament is a fraud, found ed on a fable in the Old! I then acce pted the Canon ical G ospels as containing a veritable human h istory, and assumed, as others do, that the history proved itself. Finding that Jesus, o r Jehoshua Ben - Pandira, was an h istorical character, kno wn to the Talm ud, I made the c omm on mi stake of suppo sing that this prove d the personal existence of the Jesus found po rtrayed in the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Canon ical Gospels. But after you h ave heard my story, and weighed the e vidence now for the first tim e c ollected and p resented to the pub lic, you will not wond er that I shou ld h ave changed my view s, o r that I shou ld b e im pelled to tell t he truth to o thers, as it now appears to myself; althou gh I am only able to summ arize here, in the briefest m anner possible, a few of the facts that I have dealt with exhaustively elsewhere. The personal existence o f Jesus as Jehoshua Ben - Pandira ca n b e e stablished b eyond a doub t. One acc oun t affirms that, acc ording to a genuine Jewish tradition \"that m an (who is not to b e named) was a disciple of Jehoshua Ben - Perachia.\" It also says, \"He was born in the fourth year of the reign o f the Jewish King Alexander Jann√¶us, no twithstanding the a ssertions of his followers that he was born in the reign o f Herod. \" That would b e more than a ce ntury earlier than the date of birth assigned to the Jesus of the Gospels! But it can b e further shown that Jehoshua Ben - Pandira may have been bo rn considerably earlier even than the year 102 B.C. , althou gh the point is not of much consequence here. Jehoshua, son o f Perachia, was a president of the Sanhedrin -- the fifth, reckon ing from Ezra a s the first: one of those who in the line of descent rece ived and transmitt ed the oral law, as it was s aid, d irect from Sinai. There c ould no t be two o f that name. This Ben - Perachia had b egun to teac h as a Rabbi in the year 154 B.C. We may therefore reckon that he was not born later than 180 - 170 B.C. , and that it could h ardly be later than 100 B.C. when h e went down into Egypt with h is pup il. For it i s related that he fled there in consequence of a persecution o f the Rabbis, feasibly conjectured to refer to the c ivil war in which the Pharisees revolted against King Alexander Jann√¶us, and consequently abou t 105 B.C. If we put the a ge of his pup il, Jehoshua Ben - Pandira, at fifteen years, that will give us an approxim ate date, extracted withou t pressure, which s hows that Jehoshua Ben - Pandira may have been bo rn abou t the year 120 B.C. But twenty y ears are a matter of littl e moment here. According to the Babylonian Gemara to the Mishna of Tract \"Shabbath,\" this Jehoshua, the son o f Pandira a nd Stada, was s toned to death as a wizard, in the c ity of Lud, o r Lydda, and afterwards crucified b y being hanged on a tree, on the e ve of the Passover. This is the manner of death assigned to Jesus in the Book o f Acts. The Gemara says there exists a tradition that on the rest - da y before the Sabbath they crucified Jehoshua, on the rest - day of the Passah (the day before the Passover). The year of his death, ho wever, is not given in that acc oun t; but there a re reasons for thinking it could no t have been much earlier nor later than B .C. 70, b eca use this Jewish King Jann√¶us reigned from t he year 106 to 79 B.C. He was s uccee ded in the government by his widow Salom√®, whom t he Greeks called Alexandra, and who reigned for some nine years. Now the traditions, especially of the first \"Toledo th Jehoshua,\" relate that the Queen o f Jann√¶us, and the mother of Hyrcanus, who must t herefore be Salom√®, in spite of her being called b y another name, showed favou r to Jehoshua a nd h is teac hing; that she was a witness of his wond erful works and po wers of healing, and tried to save him from t he hands of his sace rdotal enemi es, b eca use he was related to h er; but that during her reign, which ended in the year 71 B.C. , h e was put to d eath. The Jewish writers and Rabbis with whom I have talked always deny the i dentity of the Talm udic Jehoshua a nd the Jesus of the Gospels. \"This,\" observes Rabbi Jechiels, \"which h as been related to Jehoshua Ben - Perachia a nd his pup il, contains no reference whatever to h im whom t he Christians honou r as God!\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Another Rabbi, Salm an Zevi, p rodu ced ten reasons for concluding that the Jehoshua of the Talm ud was not he who was afterwards called Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus of Nazareth (and o f the Canon ical Gospels) was unkno wn to Justus, to the Jew of Celsus, and to Josephu s, the suppo sed re ference to h im by the latter being an undoub ted forgery. The \"blasphemous writings of the Jews abou t Jesus,\" as Justin Martyr calls them, always refer to Jehoshua Ben - Pandira, and no t to the Jesus of the Gospels. It is Ben - Pandira they mean when they say t hey have a nother and a truer acc oun t of the birth and life, the wond er - working and d eath o f Jehoshua or Jesus. This repud iation is perfectly hon est and sound ly based. The only Jesus kno wn to the Jews was Jehoshua Ben - Pandira, who h ad learnt the a rts of mag ic in Egypt, and who was put to d eath b y them as a sorcerer. This was likewise the only Jesus kno wn to Celsus, the writer of the \"True Logos,\" a work which the Christians managed to get rid o f bod ily, with so many other of the a nti - Christian evidences. Cel sus observes that he was not a pure Word, no t a true Logos, bu t a man who h ad learned the a rts of sorcery in Egypt. So, in the Clementines, it i s in the c haracter of Ben - Pandira that Jesus is s aid to rise a gain as the magician. But here is the c onclusive f act: The Jews kno w nothing of Jesus, the Christ of the Gospels, as an h istorical character; and when the Christians of the fourth century trace his pedigree, b y the hand o f Epiphanius, they are forced to d erive their Jesus from Pandira! Epiphanius gives th e genealogy of the Canon ical Jesus in this wise: -- Jacob, called Pandira, Mary=Joseph -- Cleopas, Jesus. This proves that in the fourth century the pedigree of Jesus was trace d to Pandira, the father of that Jehoshua who was the pup il of Ben - Perachia, and wh o b ecomes one of the magicians in Egypt, and who was crucified as a magician on the e ve of the Passover by the Jews, in the tim e of Queen Alexandra, who h ad cea sed to reign in the year 70 B.C. -- the Jesus, therefore, who lived and d ied more than a ce ntury t oo soon. Thus, the Jews do no t identify Jehoshua Ben - Pandira with the Gospel Jesus, o f whom they, h is s uppo sed contemporaries, kno w nothing, bu t protest against the a ssumption as an im possibilit y; whereas the Christians do identify their Jesus as the desce ndant of Pandira. It was he or nobod y; yet he was neither the son o f Joseph no r the Virgin Mary, nor was he c rucified at Jerusalem. It is not the Jews, then, bu t the Christians, who fuse two suppo sed h istoric c haracters into on e! There being but one histor y ackno wledged o r kno wn on either side, it follows that the Jesus of the Gospels is the Jehoshua of the Talm ud, o r is not at all, as a Person. This s hifts the historic basis altogether; it antedates the human h istory by more than a hund red years, and it at on ce destroys the historic character of the Gospels, together with that of any other personal Jesus than Ben - Pandira. In short, the Jewish h istory of the matter will be found to corrobo rate the mythical. As Epiphanius knew of no o ther historical Jesus tha n the descendant of Pandira, it i s possible that this is the Jesus whose tradition is reported b y Iren√¶us."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Iren√¶us was born in the ea rly part of the second century, b etween 120 and 140 A.D. He was Bishop o f Lyons, France, and a personal acquaintance of Pol ycarp; and h e repeats a tradition testified to b y the e lders, which h e a lleges was directly derived from John, the \"disciple of the Lord,\" to the e ffect that Jesus was not crucified at 33 years of age, bu t that he passed through every age, and lived on to be a n o ldish man. Now, in acc ordance with the dates given, Jehoshua Ben - Pandira may have been b etween 50 and 60 years of age when pu t to d eath, and h is tradition alone furnishes a c lue to the Nihilistic statement of Iren√¶us. When the true tradition o f Ben - Pandira is recovered, it shows that he was the sole historical Jesus who was hun g on a tree by the Jews, no t crucified in the Roman fashion, and authenticates the c laim now to b e made on b ehalf of the a strono mi cal allegory to the dispensational Jesus, the Kronian Christ, the mythical Messiah o f the Canon ical Gospels, and the Jesus of Paul, who was not the ca rnalised Christ. For I hold that the Jesus of the \"other Gospel,\" acc ording to the Apostles Cephas and James, who was utterly repud iated by Paul, was no ne other than Ben - Pandira, the Nazarene, o f whom James was a follower, acc ording to a c omm ent on h im found in the Book Abod azura. Anyway, there a re two Jesuses, or Jesus and the Christ, on e of whom i s repud iated b y Paul. But Jehoshua, the son o f Pandira, c an n ever be c onv erted into Jesus Christ, the son o f a virgin mother, as an h istoric c haracter. Nor can the dates given ever be reconciled with contemporary history. The historical Herod, who sought to slay the youn g child Jesus, is kno wn to h ave died four years before the date of the Christian era, assigned for the birth of Jesus. So much for the historic Jesus. And no w for the mythical Christ. Here we ca n tread on firmer ground. The mythical Messiah was always born o f a Virgin Mother -- a factor unkno wn in n atural phenomena, and on e that canno t be historical, on e that can on ly be e xplained b y means of the Mythos, and those c ond itions of primiti ve sociology which are mi rrored in mythology and p reserved in theology. The virgin mother has been represented in Egy pt by the maiden Queen, Mut - em - ua, the future mother of Amenhept III. some 16 centuries B.C. , who im personated the e ternal virgin that produ ced the e ternal child. Four consecutive scenes reprodu ced in my book are found pou rtrayed upon the innermost walls o f the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Luxor, which was built by Amenhept III., a Pharaoh o f the 17th d ynasty. The first scene on the left hand shows the God Taht, the Lunar Mercury, the Annun ciator of the Gods, in the ac t of hailing the Virgin Queen, and a nnoun cing to h er that she is to give birth to the c omi ng Son. In the next scene the God Kneph (in conjunction with Hathor) gives the new life. This is the Holy Ghost or Spirit that causes the Imm aculate Conception, Kneph b eing the spirit by name in Egyptia n. The natural effects are made a pparent in the virgin's s welling form. Next the mother is s eated on the mi d - wife's s tool, and the newborn child is s uppo rted in the hands of one of the nurses. The fourth scene is that of the Adoration. Here the c hild is"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"en throned, rece iving homage from t he Gods and gifts from m en. Behind the deity Kneph, on the right, three spirits -- the Three Magi, o r Kings of the Legend, are kneeling and offering presents with their right hand, and life with their left. The c hild thus anno unced, incarnated, bo rn, and worshipped, was the Pharaonic representative of the Aten Sun in Egypt, the God Adon o f Syria, and Hebrew A don ai; t he c hild - Christ of the Aten Cult; t he mi raculous conception o f the e ver - virgin mother, p ersonated b y Mut - em - ua, a s mother of the \"only one,\" and representative of the divine mother of the youthful Sun - God. These scenes, which were mythical i n Egypt, h ave been copied o r r eprodu ced as historical i n the Canon ical Gospels, where they stand like four corner - stones to the Historic Structure, and p rove that the found ations are mythical. Jesus was not only born o f the mythical m otherhood ; his descent on the maternal side is trace d in acc ordance with this origin o f the mythical Christ. The virgin was also called the harlot, b eca use she represented the pre - mono gami c stage of intercourse; and Jesus descends from four f orms of the harlot -- Thamar, Rahab, Ruth and Bathsheba -- eac h o f whom i s a form of the \"stranger in Israel,\" and is not a Hebrew w oman. Such h istory, however, do es n ot show that illi cit i ntercourse was the natural m ode of the divine descent; nor does it im ply unp aralleled hu man p rofligacy. It only proves the Mythos. In hu man sociology the son o f the mother prece ded the father, as s on o f the woman who was a mother, bu t no t a wife. This character is likewise c laim ed for Jesus, who is made to declare that he was earlier than Abraham, who was the typical Great Father of the Jews; whether considered to b e mythical or historical. Jesus s tates emphatically that he e xisted bef ore Abraham was. This is only possible to the mythical Christ, who p rece ded the father as s on o f the virgin mother; and we shall find it so throughou t. All t hat is non - natural and im possible a s human h istory, is possible, natural and explicable a s M ythos. It can b e e xplained b y the Mythos, b eca use it originated in that which alone acc oun ts for it. For it comes to this at last: t he more hidden the meaning in the Gospel history, the more satisfactorily is it explained b y the Mythos; and the more mystical the Christian doctrine, the more ea sily can it be proved to b e mythical. The birth o f Christ i s astrono mi cal. The birthday is determi ned b y the full m oon o f Easter. This can on ly occur once e very 19 years, as we have it ill ustrated b y the Epact or Golden Numbe r of the Prayer Book. Understand me! Jesus, the Christ, can on ly have a birthday, o r r esurrection, on ce in 19 years, in acc ordance with the Metonic Cycle, beca use his parents are the sun and moon ; and those a ppear in the ea rliest kno wn representation o f th e Man upon the Cross! This proves the a strono mi cal and non - human nature of the birth itself, which is identical with that of the full m oon o f Easter in Egypt. Casini, the French Astrono mer, h as demonstrated the fact that the date a ssigned for the birth o f the Christ is an Astrono mi cal epoch in which the mi ddle c onjunction o f the moon with the sun h appened on the 24th March, at half - past one o'clock in the morning, at the meridian o f Jerusalem, the very day of the mi ddle e quinox. The following day (the 25th) was the day of the Incarnation, acc ording to Augustine, bu t t he date of the Birth,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"acc ording to Clement Alexander. For two b irth d ays are a ssigned to Jesus by the Christian Fathers, on e a t the Winter Solstice, the other at the Vernal Equinox. These, which canno t both b e historical, are based on the two b irthdays of the doub le Horus in Egypt. Plutarch tells us that Isis was delivered o f Horus, the c hild, abou t the tim e of the winter Solstice, and that the festival of the second o r adult Horus followed the V ernal Equinox. Hence, the Solstice a nd spring Equinox were both assigned to the one birth o f Jesus by the Christolators; and again, that which is im possible a s human h istory is the natural fact in relation to the two Horuses, the dual form of the Solar God in Egypt. And h ere, in p assing, we may point out the a strono mi cal nature of the Crucifixion. The Gospel acc ording to John b rings on a tradition so d ifferent from t hat of the Synop tics as to invalidate the human h istory of both.

As human h istory it canno t be e xplained. But there is an explanation po ssible, which, if acce pted, p roves the Mythos. The Crucifixion (or Crossing) was, and still i s, d etermi ned b y the full m oon o f Easter. This, in the lunar reckon ing, would b e on the 14th in the month o f 28 d ays; in the solar month o f 30 d ays it was reckon ed to o ccur on the 15th o f the month . Both un ite, and the rift closes in p roving the Crucifixion to h ave been Astrono mi cal, just as it was in Egypt, where the two d ates can b e identified. Plutarch also tells us how the Mithraic Cult had b een p articularly established in Rome abou t the year 70 B.C. And Mithras was fabled as having been bo rn in a ca ve. Wherever Mithras was worshipped the ca ve was consecrated as his birthplace . The ca ve ca n b e identified, and the birth o f the Messiah in that cave, no matter und er what name he was born, can b e def initely dated. The \"Cave of Mithras\" was the birthplace of the Sun in the Winter Solstice, when this occurred on the 25th o f Dece mber in the sign o f the Sea - Goat, with the Vernal Equinox in the sign o f the Ram. Now the Akkadian n ame of the tenth month, tha t of the Sea - Goat, which answers roughly to ou r Dece mber, the tenth b y name, is Abba Uddu, that is, the \"Cave of Light;\" the ca ve of re - birth for the Sun in the lowest depth at t he Solstice, figured as the Cave of Light. This cave was continued as the birt hplace of the Christ. You will find it i n all t he Gospels of the Infancy, and Justin Martyr says, \"Christ was born in the Stable, and afterwards took refuge in the Cave.\" He likewise vou ches for the fact that Christ was born on the same day that the Sun wa s re - born in Stabu lo Augi√¶, or, in the Stable of Augias. Now the c leansing of this Stable was the sixth labou r of Herakles, h is first being in the sign o f the Lion; and Justin was right; the Stable a nd Cave a re both figured in the same Celestial Sign. But mark this! The Cave was the birthplace of the Solar Messiah from t he year 2410 to the year 255 B.C. ; at which latter date the Solstice passed ou t of the Sea - Goat into the sign o f the Archer; and no Messiah, whether called Mithras, Adon, Tamm uz, Horus or Ch rist, could h ave been bo rn in the Cave of Abba Uddu or the Stable of Augias on the 25th o f Dece mber after the year 255 B.C. , therefore, Justin h ad no thing but the Mithraic tradition o f the by - gone birthday to p rove the birth o f the Historical Christ 255 ye ars later! In their mysteries the Sarrace ni celebrated the Birth o f the babe in the Cave or Subterranean Sanctuary, from which the Priest i ssued, and cried: -- \"The Virgin h as"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"brought forth: The Light is abou t to b egin to grow again!\" -- on the Mother - night of the year. And the Sarrace ni were not suppo rters of Historic Christianity. The birthplace of the Egyptian Messiah at the Vernal Equinox was figured in Apt, o r Apta, the c orner; but Apta is also the name of the Crib and the Manger; hence the Child born in Apta, was s aid to b e born in a manger; and this Apta a s Crib o r Manger is the hieroglyphic sign o f the Solar birthplace . Hence the Egyptians exhibited the Babe in the Crib o r Manger in the streets of Alexandria. The birthplace was indicated b y the c olure o f the Equinox, as it passed from sign to sign. It was also po inted ou t by the Star in the East. When the birthplace was in the sign o f the Bull, Orion was the Star that rose in the East to tell where the youn g Sun - God was re - born. Hence it i s called the \"S tar of Horus.\" That was then the Star of the \"Three Kings\" who greeted the Babe; for the \"Three Kings\" is still a name of the three stars in Orion's Belt. Here we learn that the legend o f the \"Three Kings\" is at least 6,000 years old. In the c ourse of Prec ession, abou t 255 B.C. , the vernal birthplace passed into the sign o f the Fishes, and the Messiah who h ad b een represented for 2155 years by the Ram or Lamb, and p reviously for other 2155 years by the Apis Bull, was now im aged as the Fish, or the \"Fish - man ,\" called Ichthys in Greek. The original Fish - man -- the An o f Egypt, and the Oan o f Chaldea -- probably dates from t he previous cycle of prece ssion, o r 26,000 years earlier; and abou t 255 B.C. , the Messiah, as the Fish - man, was to come up on ce more a s the Man ifestor fr om t he ce lestial waters. The c omi ng Messiah is called Dag, the Fish, in the Talm ud; and the Jews at one tim e c onn ected h is comi ng with some conjunction, o r occurrence, in the sign o f the Fishes! This s hows the Jews were not only in po ssession o f the a strono mi cal allegory, bu t also o f the tradition b y which it could b e interpreted. It was the Mythical and Kronian Messiah alone who was, o r could b e, the subject of proph ecy that mi ght be fulfilled -- proph ecy that was fulfilled as it i s in the Book o f Revelation -- when the Equinox entered, the c ross was re - erected, and the found ations of a new heaven were laid in the sign o f the Ram, 2410 B.C. ; and, again, when the Equinox entered the sign o f the Fishes, 255 B.C. Proph ecy that will be aga in fulfilled whe n the Equinox enters the sign o f the Waterman abou t the e nd o f this century, to which the Samaritans are still l ook ing forward for the c omi ng of their Messiah, who has not yet arrived for them. The Christians alone a te the oyster; the Jews and Samaritans o nly got an equal share of the e mpty shells! The uninstructed Jews, the idiotai, at one tim e thou ght the proph ecy which was astrono mi cal, and solely related to the c ycles of tim e, was to h ave its fulfilm ent in hu man h istory. But they found ou t their error, and bequeathed it unexplained to the still m ore ignorant Christians. The same tradition o f the Comi ng One is extant amongst the Millenarians and Adventists, as amongst the Moslems. It is the tradition o f El - Mahdi, the proph et who is to come in the last day s of the world to conqu er all t he world, and who was lately descending the Soud an with the old announ cement t he \"Day of the Lord is at hand, \" which shows that t he a strono mi cal allegory has left some relics of the true tradition among the Arabs, who were a t on e tim e learned in astrono mi cal lore. The Messiah, as the Fish - man, is foreseen b y Esdras ascending out of the sea a s the \"same whom God the highest hath k ept a great season, which b y his own self shall"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"deliver the c reature.\" The a ncient Fish - man on ly ca me up ou t of the sea to conv erse with men and teac h them i n the daytim e. \"When the sun set,\" says Berosus, \"it was the c ustom of this Being to p lunge a gain into the sea, and abide a ll night in the deep.\" So the man foreseen b y Esdras is only visible by day . As it i s s aid, \"E'en so can no man upon earth see my son, o r those that be with h im , bu t in the daytim e.\" This is parodied o r fulfilled in the acc oun t of Ichthys, the Fish, the Christ who instructs men b y day, bu t retires to the lake of Galilee, where he demonstrates his solar nature by walking the waters at night, or at the dawn o f day. We a re told that his disciples being on bo ard a ship, \"when even was come, in the fourth watch o f the night, Jesus went unto them walking upon the sea.\" Now the fourth wa tch began at three o'clock, and ended at six o'clock. Therefore, this was abou t the proper tim e for a solar God to appear walking upon the waters, o r comi ng up ou t of them as the Oannes. Oannes is s aid to h ave taken no food whilst he was with men: \"In the daytim e he used to conv erse with men, bu t took no food at that season. \" So Jesus, when h is disciples prayed h im , saying \"Master, eat,\" said un to them, \"I have meat to eat that you kno w not of. My meat is to do the will of Him t hat sent m e.\" This is the per fect li keness of the c haracter of Oannes, who took no food, bu t whose tim e was wholly spent in teac hing men. Moreover, the mythical Fish - man is made to identify him self. When the Pharisees s ought a \"sign from heaven,\" Jesus s aid, \"There shall no sign b e gi ven bu t the sign o f Jonas. For as Jonas beca me a sign un to the Ninevites, so shall also the son o f man b e to this generation. \" The sign o f Jonas is that of the Oan, o r Fish - man o f Nineveh, whether we take it direct from t he monu ments, or fr om t he Hebrew hi story of Jonah, o r fr om t he Zodiac. The voice of the secret wisdom here says truly that those who are look ing for signs, can have no o ther than that of the returning Fish - man, Ichthys, Oannes, o r Jonah: and assuredly, there was no o ther sign o r date -- than those of Ichthys, the Fish who was re - born o f the fish - godd ess, Atergatis, in the sign o f the Fishes, 255 B.C. After whom t he primiti ve Christians were ca lled littl e fishes, or Pisciculi. This date of 255 B.C. was the true day of birth, o r rather of re - bir th for the ce lestial Christ, and there was no v alid reason for changing the tim e of the world. The Gospels contain a c onfused and confusing record o f early Christian b elief: things most truly believed (Luke) concerning certain mythical m atters, which were ignorantly mi staken for human and h istorical. The Jesus of our Gospels is but littl e of a human reality, in spite of all attempts to n aturalize the Mythical Christ, and make the story look rational. The Christian religion was not found ed on a man, bu t on a divinity; that is, a mythical character. So far fr om being derived from t he model m an, the typical Christ was made up from t he features of various Gods, after a fashion somewhat li ke those \"pictorial"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"averages\" portrayed b y Mr. Galton, in which the traits of several persons are pho tographed and fused in a portrait of a dozen d ifferent persons, merged into on e that is not anybod y. And as fast as the c omposite Christ falls to p iece s, eac h feature is claim ed, eac h character is gathered up b y the original owner , as with the grasp o f gravitation. It is not I that deny the divinity of Jesus the Christ; I assert it ! He never was, and n ever could b e, any other than a divinity; that is, a c haracter non - human, and entirely mythical, who h ad b een the pagan d ivinity of various pagan myths, that had b een p agan du ring thou sands of years before our Era. Nothing is more ce rtain, acc ording to hon est evidence, than that the Christian scheme of redemption is found ed on a fable mi sinterpreted; that the proph ecy of f ulfillm ent wa s solely astrono mi cal, and the Comi ng One a s the Christ who came in the e nd o f an age, o r of the world, was but a metapho rical figure, a type of tim e, from t he first, which n ever could take form i n h istoric personality, any more than Tim e in Person could c ome out of a c lock - case when the hou r strikes; that no Jesus could b ecome a Nazarene by being born at, o r taken to, Nazareth; and that the history in ou r Gospels is from beginning to end the identifiable story of the Sun - God, and the Gnostic Christ who n ev er could b e made flesh. When we did no t kno w the one it was possible to b elieve the other; but when on ce we truly kno w, then the false belief is no longer possible. The mythical Messiah was Horus in the Osirian Mythos; Har - Khuti i n the Sut - Typhon ian; Khun s u in that of Amen - Ra; Iu in the c ult of Atum - Ra; and the Christ of the Gospels is an amalgam of all t hese c haracters. The Christ is the Good Shepherd! So was Horus. Christ is the Lamb o f God! So was Horus. Christ is the Bread o f Life! So was Horus. C hrist is the Truth and the Life! So was Horus. Christ is the Fan - bearer! So was Horus. Christ is the Lord!"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"So was Horus. Christ is the Way and the Door of Life! Horus was the path b y which they travelled ou t of the Sepulchre. He is the God whose name is written with the hieroglyphic sign o f the Road o r Way. Jesus is he that shou ld come; and Iu, the root of the name in Egyptian, means \"to come.\" Iu - em - hept, as the Su, the Son o f Atum, o r of Ptah, was the \"Ever - Comi ng One,\" who is always pou rtrayed as th e marching youn gster, in the ac t and attit ude of comi ng. Horus included bo th sexes. The Child (or the soul) is of either sex, and po tentially, o f both. Hence the hermaphrodital Deity; and Jesus, in Revelation, is the Youn g Man who h as the female paps. Iu - e m - hept signifies he who comes with p eace . This is the c haracter in which Jesus is announ ced b y the Angels! And when Jesus comes to h is disciples after the resurrection it is as the bringer of peace . \"Learn o f me a nd ye shall find rest,\" says the Christ. Kh unsu - Nefer - Hept is the Good Rest, Peace in Person! The Egyptian Jesus, Iu - em - Hept, was the second Atum; Paul's Jesus is the second Adam. In on e rendition o f John 's Gospel, instead of the \"only - begotten Son o f God, \" a variant reading g ives the \"only - begotte n God, \" which h as been d eclared an im possible rendering. But the \"only - begotten God\" was an especial t ype in Egyptian Mythology, and the phrase re - identifies the divinity whose emblem i s the beetle. Hor - Apollo says, \"To d enote the only - begotten o r a father , the Egyptians delineate a scarab√¶us! By this they symbolize a n on ly - begotten, b eca use the c reature is s elf - produ ced, b eing unconceived b y a female.\" Now the youthful m anifestor of the Beetle - God was this Iu - em - hept, the Egyptian Jesus. The very phraseolo gy of John is comm on to the Inscriptions, which tell of him who was the Beginner of Becomi ng from t he first, and who made a ll t hings, bu t who h im self was not m ade. I quo te verbatim . And no t only was the Beetle - God continued in the \"only - begotten God\"; the beetle - type was also b rought on as a symbol of the Christ. Ambrose a nd Augustine, amongst the Christian Fathers, identified Jesus with, and as, the \"good Scarab√¶us,\" which further identifies the Jesus of John 's Gospel with the Jesus of Egypt, who was the E ver - Comi ng One, and the Bringer of Peace , whom I have e lsewhere shown to b e the Jesus to whom t he Book o f Ecclesiasticus is inscribed, and ascribed in the Apocrypha. In acc ordance with this continuation o f the Kamit e symbols, it was also maintained b y some sectaries that Jesus was a potter, and no t a ca rpenter; and the fact is that this only - begotten Beetle - God, who is portrayed sitti ng at the potter's wheel formi ng the Egg, o r shaping the vase - symbol of creation, was the Potter personified, as well as the only - begotten God in Egypt. The c haracter and teac hings of the Canon ical Christ are c omposed o f contradictions which canno t be harmonized as those of a human b eing, whereas they are a lways true to the Mythos."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"He is the Prince of Peace , and yet he a sserts t hat he ca me not to b ring peace : \"I came not to send p eace , bu t a sword,\" and no t only is Iu - em - hept the Bringer of Peace by name in one c haracter; he is the Sword p ersonified in the other. In this he says, \"I am t he living im age of Atum, p rocee ding from hi m as a sword.\" Both characters belong to the mythical Messiah in the Ritual, who also calls him self the \"Great Disturber,\" and the \"Great Tranqu ilizer\" -- the \"God Contention, \" and the \"God Peace .\" The Christ of the Canon ical Gospels has s everal prototypes, and sometim es the c opy is derived o r the trait i s caught from one original, and sometim es from t he other. The Christ of Luke's Gospel has a character entirely distinct from t hat of John 's Gospel. Here he is the Great Exorciser, and caster - out of demons. Jo hn's Gospel contains no case of possession o r obsession: no certain man who \"had d evils this long tim e\"; no child po ssessed with a devil; no b lind and du mb man po ssessed with a devil. Other mi racles are performed b y the Christ of John, bu t not these; beca u se John 's is a different type of the Christ. And the original of the Great Healer in Luke's Gospel m ay be found in the God Khun su, who was the Divine Healer, the supreme one a mongst all t he other healers and saviours, especially as the ca ster - out of demons , and the e xpeller of possessing spirits. He is called in the texts the \"Great God, the driver away of possession. \" In the Stele of the \"Possessed Princess,\" this God in h is effigy is s ent for by the c hief of Bakhten, that he may come a nd cast out a posses sing spirit from t he king's daughter, who has an evil m ovement in h er lim bs. The demon recognizes the divinity just as the devil recognizes Jesus, the e xpeller of evil spirits. Also the God Khun su is Lord ov er the pig -- a type of Sut. He is portrayed in the disk o f the full m oon o f Easter, in the ac t of offering the pig as a sacrifice. Moreover, in the judgment scenes, when the wicked spirits are cond emned and sent back into the a byss, their mode of r eturn to the lake of prim ordial matter is by entering the bod ies of swine. Says Horus to the Gods, speaking of the cond emned on e: \"When I sent him t o h is place he went, and h e has been transformed into a black p ig.\" So when the Exorcist in Luke's Gospel casts out Legion, the devils ask permi ssion o f the Lord o f t he pig to b e a llowed to enter the swine, and h e gives them leave. This, and much more that mi ght be a ddu ced, tends to d ifferentiate the Christ of Luke, and to identify him with Khun su, rather than with Iu - em - hept, the Egyptian Jesus, who is reprodu ced in t he Gospel acc ording to John. In this way it can b e proved that the history of Christ in the Gospels is one long and complete ca talogue of likenesses to the Mythical Messiah, the Solar or Luni - Solar God. The \"Litany of Ra,\" for example, is addressed to the Sun - God in a variety of characters, many of which are a ssigned to the Christ of the Gospels. Ra is the Supreme Power, the Beetle that rests in the Empyrean, who is born as his own son. This, as already said, is the God in John 's Gospel, who says: -- \"I and t he Father are one,\" and who is the father born as his own son; for he says, in kno wing and seeing the son, \"from henceforth ye kno w him and h ave seen h im \"; i.e., the Father. Ra is designated the \"Soul that speaks.\" Christ is the Word. Ra is the destroyer o f venom. Jesus s ays: -- \"In my name they shall t ake up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"shall not hurt them.\" In on e c haracter Ra is the outcast. So Jesus had no t where to lay his head. Ra is the \"timi d on e who sheds tears in the form of the A fflicted.\" He is called Remi , the Weeper. This weeping God p asses through \"Rem - Rem,\" the place of weeping, and there conqu ers on b ehalf of his followers. In the Ritual the God says: -- \"I have desolated the place of Rem - Rem.\" This character is s ustained b y J esus in the mourning over Jerusalem that was to b e desolated. The words of John, \"Jesus wept,\" are like a ca rven statue of the \"Afflicted One,\" as Remi , the Weeper. Ra is also the God who \"makes the mumm y come forth.\" Jesus makes the mumm y come forth in th e shape of Lazarus; and in the Roman Catacombs the risen Lazarus is not only represented as a mumm y, bu t is an Egyptian mumm y which h as been eviscerated and swathed for the e ternal abod e. Ra says to the mumm y: \"Come forth!\" and Jesus cries: \"Lazarus, come forth!\" Ra manifests as \"the burning one, h e who sends destruction, \" or \"sends his fire into the place of destruction. \" \"He sends fire upon the rebels,\" his form i s that of the \"God o f the furnace .\" Christ also comes in the person o f this \"burning one\"; t h e sender of destruction b y fire. He is proclaim ed b y Matthew to b e the Baptiser with fire. He says, \"I am come to send fire on the ea rth.\" He is portrayed as \"God o f the furnace ,\" which shall \"burn up the c haff with unqu enchable fire.\" He is to cast the re bellious into a \"furnace of f ire,\" and send the cond emned on es into everlasting fire. All t his was natural when applied to the Solar - God, and it i s s uppo sed to b ecome supernatural when mi sapplied to a suppo sed hu man b eing to whom it never could apply. The Solar fire was the prim ary African foun t of theological hell - fire a nd h ell. The \"Litany\" of Ra c ollects the manifold characters that m ake up the total God (termed Teb - temt ), and the Gospels have gathered up the mythical remains; thus the result i s in eac h case identical, o r entirely simil ar. From beginning to end the Canon ical Gospels contain the Drama of the Mysteries of the Luni - Solar God, n arrated as a human h istory. The scene on the Moun t of Transfiguration is obv iously derived from t he a scent of Osiris into the Moun t of Transfiguration in the Moon. The sixth d ay was celebrated as that of the c hange a nd transformation o f the Solar God in the lunar orb, which h e re - entered on that day as the regenerator of its light. With this we may compare the statement made by Matthew, that \"after six days Jesus went up into a high moun tain apart, and h e was transfigured, and h is face did shine a s the sun (of course!), and h is garments beca me white a s the light.\" In Egypt the year began soon after the Summ er Solstice, w hen the sun d escended from it s mi dsumm er height, lost it s force, and lessened in its s ize. This represented Osiris, who was born o f the Virgin Mother as the c hild Horus, the dimi nished infantile sun o f Autumn; the suffering, wound ed, b leeding Messiah, as h e was represented. He descended into h ell, o r hades, where he was transformed into the virile Horus, and rose a gain as the sun o f the resurrection at Easter. In these two characters of Horus on the two ho rizons, Osiris furnished the dual type for the Canon ical Christ, which shows very satisfactorily HO W the mythical prescribes the bound aries beyond which the historical does not, d are"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"not, go. The first was the c hild Horus, who always remained a c hild. In Egypt the boy or girl wore the Horus - lock o f childhoo d un til 12 years of age. Thus childhood ended abou t the twelfth year. But althou gh adultship was then entered upon b y the youth, and the transformation o f the boy into manhood b egan, the full adultship was not attained un til 30 years of age. The man o f 30 years was the typical adult. The a ge of adultship was 30 years, as it was in Rome und er Lex Papp ia. The homm e fait is the man whose years are triaded b y tens, and who is Khemt. As with the man, so it i s with the God; and the second Horus, the same God in h is s econd character, is the Khemt or Khem - Horus, the typical adult of 30 years. The God up to twelve years was Horus, the c hild o f Isis, the mother's child, the weakling. The virile Horus (the sun in its vernal strength), the a dult of 30 years, was represe ntative of the Fatherhood, and this Horus is the a nointed son o f Osiris. These two characters of Horus the c hild, and Horus the a dult of 30 years, are reprodu ced in the only two ph ases of the life of Jesus in the Gospels. John furnishes no h istoric data fo r the tim e when the Word was incarnated and b eca me flesh; nor for the c hildhood o f Jesus; nor for the transformation into the Messiah. But Luke tells us that the c hild o f twelve ye ars was the wond erful youth, and that he increased in wisdom and stature. Th is is the length of years assigned to Horus the c hild; and this phase of the c hild - Christ's life is followed by the baptism and anointing, the descent of the pub escent spirit with the c onsecration o f the Messiah in Jordan, when Jesus \"began to b e abou t 30 years of age.\" The ea rliest anointing was the c onsecration o f pub erty; and h ere a t the full age of the typical adult, the Christ, who was previously a c hild, the c hild o f the Virgin Mother, is sudd enly made into the Messiah, as the Lord's anointed. And ju st as the second Horus was regenerated, and this tim e begotten o f the father, so in the transformation scene of the baptism i n Jordan, the father authenticates the c hange into full adultship, with the voice from heaven saying: -- \"This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased;\" the spirit of pub escence, o r the Ruach, being represented b y the descending dov e, called the spirit of God. Thus from t he tim e when the c hild - Christ was abou t twelve years of age, until t hat of the typical homm e fait of Egypt, whic h was the a ge a ssigned to Horus when he beca me the a dult God, there is no h istory. This is in exact acc ordance with the Kamit e allegory of the doub le - Horus. And the Mythos alone will acc oun t for the c hasm which is wide a nd d eep enou gh to engulf a suppo sed history of 18 years. Childhood canno t be carried b eyond the 12th year, and the c hild - Horus always remained a c hild; just as the child - Christ does in Italy, and in German folk - tales. The mythical record found ed on nature went no further, and there the histo ry consequently halts within the prescribed limit s, to rebegin with the a nointed and regenerated Christ at the a ge of Khem - Horus, the adult of 30 years. And these two characters of Horus nece ssitated a doub le form of the mother, who d ivides into the two d i vine sisters, Isis and Nephthys. Jesus also was bi - mater, o r dual - mothered; and the two sisters reappear in the Gospels as the two Marys, bo th o f whom are the mothers of Jesus. This again, which is im possible a s human h istory, is perfect acc ording to the M ythos that explains it."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"As the c hild - Horus, Osiris comes down to earth; he e nters matter, and b ecomes mortal. He is born like the Logos, o r \"as a Word.\" His father is Seb, the ea rth, whose c onsort is Nu, the heaven, on e of whose names is M ERI , the Lady of Heaven; and these two are the prototypes of Joseph and Mary. He is s aid to cross the ea rth a substitute, and to suffer vicariously as the Saviour, Redeemer, and Justifier of men. In these two characters there was constant conflict between Osiris and Typho n, the Evil Power, o r Horus and Sut, the Egyptian Satan. At the Autumn Equinox, the devil of darkness began to do mi nate; this was the Egyptian Judas, who b etrayed Osiris to h is death at the last supp er. On the day of the Great Battle a t the Vernal Equinox, Osiris conqu ered as the a scending God, the Lord of the growing light. Both these struggles are pou rtrayed in the Gospels. In the one Jesus is betrayed to h is death b y Judas; in the other he rises s uperior to Satan. The latter conflict followed imm ediately after the baptism. In this way: -- When the sun was half - way round, from t he Lion sign, it crossed the River of the Waterman, the Egyptian Iarutana, Hebrew Jordan, Greek Eridanus. In this water the baptism occurred, and the transformation o f the child - Horus into the virile a dult, the c onqu eror of the e vil power, took p lace . Horus becomes hawk - headed, just where the dov e a scended and abod e on Jesus. Both b irds represented the virile soul that constituted the a nointed on e a t pub erty. By this added power Horus vanqu ished Sut, and Jesus overcame Satan. Both the baptism and the contest are referred to in the Ritual. \"I am washed with the same water in which the Good Opener ( Un - Nefer) washes when h e disputes with Satan, that j ustification shou ld b e made to Un - Nefer , the Word made Truth,\" or the Word that is Law. The scene between the Christ and the Woman at the Well m ay likewise be found in the Ritual. Here the woman is the lady with the long hair, that is Nu, the c onsort of Seb -- and the five husbands can b e paralle led b y her five star - gods born o f Seb. Osiris drinks out of the well \"to take a way his thirst.\" He a lso says: \"I am creating the water. I make way in the valley, in the Pool of the Great One. Make - road (or r oad - maker) expresses what I am.\" \" I am t he Path b y which they traverse out of the sepulchre of Osiris.\" So the Messiah reveals him self as the source of living water, \"that springeth up un to Everlasting Life.\" Later on h e says, \"I am t he way, the truth, the life.\" \" I am creating the water, d iscrimi nating the seat,\" says Horus. Jesus s ays, \"The hou r cometh when ye shall neither in this moun tain no r yet at Jerusalem worship the Father.\" Jesus claim s that this well of life was given to h im by the Father. In the Ritual it says, \"He is thine, O O siris! A well, or flow, comes out of thy mouth to h im !\" Also, the paternal source is ackno wledged in another text. \"I am t he Father, inund ating when there is thirst, guarding the water.

And h ere, no t only is the poo l described at which the Osirified are made pure a nd h ealed; not only do es the Angel or God d escend to the waters -- the \"certain tim es\" are ac tually dated. \"The Gods of the pure waters are there on the fourth hou r of the night, and the e ighth hou r of the day, saying, 'Pass away hence,' to h im who h as been cured.\""},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"An epitome of a c onsiderable portion o f John 's Gospel m ay be found in another chapter of the Ritual -- \"Ye Gods come to b e my servants, I am t he son o f your Lord. Ye a re mi ne through my Father, who gave you to me. I have been among the servants of Hathor or Meri. I have b een washed b y thee, O attendant!\" Compare the washing of Jesus' feet by Marry. The Osiris exclaim s, \"I have welcomed the c hief spirits in the service of the Lord o f things! I am t he Lord o f the fields when they are white,\" i.e., for the reapers and the har vest. So the Christ now says to the disciples, \"Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, that are white a lready unto the harvest.\" \"Then said h e unto h is disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, bu t the labou rers are few. Pray y e , therefore, the Lord o f the harvest that he send forth labou rers into h is harvest. And h e ca lled un to h im his twelve disciples.\" Now, if we turn to the Egyptian \"Book o f Hades,\" the harvest, the Lord o f the harvest, and the reapers of the harvest are a ll portrayed: the twelve a re a lso there. In on e scene they are prece ded b y a God leaning on a staff, who is designated the Master of Joy -- a surname of the Messiah Horus when assimil ated to the Soli - Lunar Khun su; the twelve a re \"they who labou r at the harvest in the plains of Neter - Kar.\" A bearer of a sickle shows the inscription: \"These a re the Reapers.\" The twelve a re divided into two group s of five a nd seven -- the original seven o f the Aahenru; t hese seven are the reapers. The other f ive a re bending towards a n enormous ear of corn, the im age of the harvest, ripe a nd ready for the sickles of the seven. The total twelve a re ca lled the \"Happy Ones,\" the bearers of food. Another titl e of the twelve is that of the \"Just Ones.\" The God says to the reapers, \"Take you r sickles! Reap your grain! Honou r to you, reapers.\" Offerings are made to them on earth, as bearers of sickles in the fields of Hades. On the other hand, the tares or the wicked are to be ca st out and d estroyed for ever. These twelve a re the a postles in t heir Egyptian ph ase. In the c hapters on \"Celestial Diet\" in the Ritual, Osiris eats und er the sycamore tree of Hathor. He says, \"Let him come from t he ea rth. Thou h ast brought these seven loaves for me to live by, b ringing the bread that Horus (the Christ) makes. Thou h ast place d, thou hast eaten rations. Let him call t o the Gods for them, o r the Gods come with them t o him .\" This is reprodu ced as mi racle in the Gospels, p erformed when the multit ude were fed upon seven loaves. The seven loaves are found h ere , together with the ca lling upon the Gods, or working the mi racle of multiplying the bread. In the next chapter there is a scene of eating and d rinking. The speaker, who im personates the Lord, says: -- \"I am t he Lord o f Bread in Annu. My bread at the heaven was that of Ra; m y bread on earth was that of Seb.\" The seven loaves represent the bread of Ra. Elsewhere the number prescribed to b e set on on e table, as an o ffering, is five loaves. these a re a lso carried on the heads of f ive different persons in the sce nes of the und er - world. Five loaves are the bread o f Seb. Thus five loaves represent the bread o f earth, and seven the bread o f heaven. Both five a nd seven are sacred regulation nu mbers in the Egyptian Ritual. And in the Gospel of Matthew the mi racles are wrought with five"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"loaves in the one ca se, and seven in the other, when the multit udes are fed on celestial diet. This will explain the two d ifferent numbers in on e a nd the same Gospel mi racle. In the Canon ical narrative there is a lad with five barley loav es and two fishes. In the next chapter of the Ritual we possibly meet with the lad h im self, as the mi racle - worker says: -- \"I have given b reath to the said youth.\" The Gnostics asserted truly that celestial persons and celestial scenes had b een transferred t o earth in ou r Gospels; and it i s only within the Pleroma (the heaven) or in the Zodiac that we ca n at tim es identify the originals of both. And it i s there we must look for the \"two fishes.\" As the latest form of the Manifestor was in the heaven o f the tw elve signs, that probably determi ned the number of twelve basketsful of food remaining when the multit ude had all been fed. \"They that ate the loaves were five thou sand men;\" and five thou sand was the exact number of the Celestials or Gods in the Assyrian Paradise, b efore the revolt and fall from heaven. The scene of the mi racle of the loaves and fishes is followed b y an attempt to take Jesus by force, bu t he withdraws him self; and this is s uccee ded b y the mi racle of his walking on the waters, and conqu erin g the wind and waves. So is it i n the Ritual. Chap. 57 is that of the breath p revailing over the water in Hades. The speaker, h aving to cross over, says: \"O H api! let t he Osiris prevail over the waters, like a s the Osiris prevailed against the taking by st ealth, the night of the great struggle.\" The Solar God was betrayed to h is death b y the Egyptian Judas, on the \"night of the taking by stealth,\" which was the night of the last supp er. The God is \"waylaid b y the c onspirators, who have watched v ery much.\" T hey are said to smell him out \"by the ea ting of his bread.\" So the Christ is waylaid b y Judas, who \"knew the place , for Jesus often resorted thither,\" and by the Jews who h ad long watched to take him . The smelling of Osiris by the ea ting of his bread is re markably rendered b y John at the eating of the last supp er. The Ritual has it: -- \"They smell Osiris by the ea ting of his bread, transporting the e vil of Osiris.\" \"And when h e had d ipped the sop h e gave it t o Judas Iscariot, and after the sop Satan entered i nto h im .\" Then said Jesus to h im i nto whom t he e vil or devil had b een transported, \"That thou do est, do qu ickly.\" Osiris was the same, b eseec hing burial. Here it i s demonstrable that the non - historical Herod is a form of the Apoph is Serpent, called the e ne my of the Sun. In Syriac, Herod is a red d ragon. Herod, in Hebrew, signifies a terror. Heru (Eg.) is to terrify, and Herrut (Eg.) is the Snake, the typical reptile. The blood of the divine victim t hat is pou red forth b y the Apoph is Serpent at the sixth hou r, on \"the night of smiti ng the profane,\" is literally shed b y Herod, as the Herrut or Typhon ian Serpent. The speaker, in the Ritual asks: \"Who art thou then, Lord o f the Silent Body? I have come to see him who is in the serpent, eye to eye, and face to fa ce.\" \" Lord o f the Silent Body\" is a titl e of the Osiris. \"Who art thou then, Lord o f the Silent Body?\" is asked and left unanswered. This character is also assigned to the Christ. The High Priest said un to him , \"Answerest thou no thing?\" \" But Jesus held h is peace .\" Herod qu estioned h im i n"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"many words, bu t he a nswered h im nothing. He ac ts the prescribed character of \"Lord o f the Silent Body.\" The transaction in the sixth hou r of the night of the Crucifixion is expressly inexplicable. In the Gospel we read: -- \" Now from t he sixth hou r there was darkness over all t he land unto the ninth hou r.\" The sixth hou r being mi dnight, that shows the solar nature of the mystery, which h as been transferred to the sixth hou r of the day in the Gospel. It is in the seventh hou r t he mortal struggle takes place between the Osiris and the deadly Apoph is, o r the great serpent, Haber, 450 cubits long, that fills the whole heaven with its vast enveloping folds. The name of this s eventh hou r is \"that which wound s the serpent Haber.\" In t his conflict with the e vil power thus portrayed the Sun - God is designated the \"Conqu eror of the Grave,\" and is s aid to make his advance through the influence of Isis, who aids him i n repelling the serpent or devil of darkness. In the Gospel, Christ i s like wise set forth in the supreme struggle a s \"Conqu eror of the Grave,\" for \"the graves were opened, and many bod ies of the saints which slept arose;\" and Mary represents Isis, the mother, at the c ross. It is s aid o f the great serpent, \"There a re those on eart h who do not drink o f the waters of this s erpent, Haber,\" which may be paralleled with the refusal of the Christ to d rink o f the vinegar mi ngled with gall. When the God h as overcome the Apoph is Serpent, h is old n ightly, annu al, and eternal enemy, h e e xclai ms, \"I come! I have made my way! I have c ome like the sun, through the gate of the one who likes to d ece ive a nd d estroy, o therwise ca lled the 'viper.' I have made my way! I have bruised the serpent, I have passed.\" But the more e xpress representation in t he mysteries was that of the a nnu al sun as the Elder Horus, o r Atum. As Julius Firmi cus s ays: \"In the solemn celebration o f the mysteries, all t hings in o rder had to b e don e which the youth either did o r suffered in h is death.\" Diodo rus Siculus rightly ide ntified the \"whole fable of the und erworld,\" that was dramatised in Greece , as having been copied \"from t he ce remonies of the Egyptian funerals,\" and so b rought on from Egypt into Greece a nd Rome. One part of this mystery was the portrayal of the suffering Sun - God in a femi nine phase. When the suffering sun was ailing and ill, h e beca me female, such b eing a primiti ve mode of expression. Luke describes the Lord in the Garden o f Gethsemane a s being in a great agony, \"and h is s weat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling to the ground. \" This experience the Gnostics identified with the suffering of their own h emorrhoidal Soph ia, whose passion is the original of that which is celebrated du ring Passion week, the \"week o f weeping in Abtu,\" and which constitut es the fund amental m ystery of the Rosy Cross, and the Rose of Silence. In this agony and b lood y sweat the Christ sim ply fulfils the c haracter of Osiris Tesh - Tesh, the red sun, the Sun - God that suffers his agony and b lood y sweat in Smen, whence Gethsmen, o r Gethsemane. Tesh means the bleeding, red, gory, separate, cut, and wound ed; tesh - tesh is the inert form of the God whose suffering, like that of Adon is, was"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"represented as femi nine, which alone reac hes a natural origin for the type. He was also called Ans - Ra, or the sun bound up in linen. So n atural were the primiti ve mysteries! My attention h as just been called to a passage in Lycoph ron, who lived und er Ptolemy Philadelphu s between 310 and 246 B.C. In this Heracles is referred to as \"That three - nighted li on, whom of old Triton's fierce dog with furious jaw devou red, Within whose bowels, tearing of his liver, He rolled, bu rning with h eat, thou gh withou t fire, His head with d rops of sweat bedewed all o'er.\" This describes the God suffering his agony and sweat, which is called the \"blood y flux\" of Osiris. Here the nights are three in nu mber. So the Son o f Man was to b e three nights as well as three days in the \"heart of the ea rth.\" In the Gospels this proph ecy is not fulfilled; but if we include the night of the blood y sweat, we have the nece ssary three nights, and the Mythos becomes perfect. In this phase the suffering Sun was the Red Sun, whence the typical Red Lion. As Atum, the red sun is described as s etting from t he Land o f Life in all t he c olours of crim son, o r Pant, the red poo l. This clothing of colours is represented as a \"gorgeous robe\" by Luke; a purple robe by Mark; and a robe of scarlet by Matthew. As he goes down at the Autumn Equinox, h e is the c rucified. His mother, Nu, o r Meri, the heaven, seeing her son, the Lord o f Terror, greatest of the terrible, setting from t he Land o f Life, with h is hands droop ing, she becomes obscure, and there is great darkness over all t he land, as at the c rucifixion d escribed b y Matthew, in which the passing of th e Lord o f Terror is rendered b y the terrible or \"loud cry\" of the Synop tic version. The Sun - God causes the dead, o r those in the ea rth, to live a s he passes down into the und er - world, beca use, as he e ntered the ea rth, the tombs were opened, i.e., figurativ ely. But it i s reprodu ced literally by Matthew. The death o f Osiris, in the Ritual, is followed b y the \"Night of the Mystery of the Great Shapes,\" and it i s explained that the night of the Great Shapes is when there has been made the e mbalmi ng of the bod y of Osiris, \"the Good Being, justified for ever.\" In the chapter on \"the night of the laying - out\" of the dead bod y of Osiris, it i s s aid that \"Isis rises on the night of the laying - out of the dead bod y, to lament over her brother Osiris.\" And again: \"The ni ght of the laying - out\" (of the dead Osiris) is mentioned, and again it i s described as that on which Isis had risen \"to make a wail for her brother.\""},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"But this is also the night on which h e c onqu ers his enemi es, and \"rece ives the birthplace of the Gods.\" \" H e tramples on the bandages they make for their burial. He raises his s oul, and concea ls his bod y.\" So the Christ is found to h ave unwound the linen b andages of burial, and they saw the linen in on e place , and the napkin in another. He too concea ls his bod y ! This is closely reprodu ced, o r paralleled, in John 's Gospel, where it i s M ary Magdalene who rises in the night and comes to the sepulchre, \"while it was yet dark,\" to find the Christ arisen, as the c onqu eror of death and the grave. In John 's version, aft er the bod y is embalm ed in a hund red pound s weight of spice, consisting of myrrh and aloes, we have the \"night of the mystery of the shapes\": \"For while it was yet dark, Mary Magdalene comi ng to the sepulchre, and p eering in, sees the two angels in white s itti ng, the one a t the head and the other at the feet, where the bod y had lately lain.\" And in the c hapter of \"How a living being is not destroyed in h ell, o r the hou r of life e nds not in Hades,\" there are two youthful Gods -- \"two youths of light, who p reva il as those who see the light,\" and the vignette shows the decea sed walking off. He has risen! Matthew has only one a ngel or splendid p resence, whose a ppearance was as lightning, which agrees with Shepi, the Splendid One, who \"lights the sarcoph agus,\" as a representative of the divinity, Ra. The risen Christ, who is first seen and recognised b y Mary, says to h er, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father.\" The same scene is described b y the Gnostics: when Soph ia rushes forward to embrace the Chr ist, who restrains her by exclaimi ng that he must not be touched. In the last chapter of the \"Preservation o f the Body in Hades,\" there is much mystical matter that look s plainer when written ou t in John 's Gospel. It is s aid o f the regermi nated or risen Go d -- \"May the Osirian speak to thee?\" The Osirian do es not kno w. He (Osiris) kno ws him . \"Let him not grasp h im.\" The Osirified \"comes out sound, Imm ortal is his name.\" \" He has passed along the upp er roads\" (that is, as a risen spirit). \"He it i s who g rasps w ith h is hand, \" and gives the palpable proof of continued personality, as does the Christ, who says, \"See my hands and my feet, that it i s I myself.\" The Sun - God re - arises on the horizon, where he issues forth, \"saying to those who b elong to h is race , Give me your arm.\" Says the Osirified d ecea sed, \"I am m ade a s ye a re.\" \" Let him explain it!\" At his reappearance the Christ demonstrates that he is made a s they are; \"See my hands and feet, that it i s I myself; handle me a nd see. And when h e had said this he s howed them his hands and feet. Then h e said to Thomas, Reac h h ither thy finger, and see my hands, and reac h h ither thy hand and pu t it i nto my side.\" These descriptions correspond to that of the c ut, wound ed, and b leeding Sun - God, who says to h is companion s, \"Give me your arm; I am m ade a s ye a re.\" In the Gospel of the Hebrews he is made to exclaim , \"For I am not a bod iless ghost.\" But in the original, when the risen on e says to h is companions, \"Give me your arm, I am made a s ye a re,\" he speaks as a spirit to spirits. Whereas in the Gospels, the Christ has to"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"demonstrate that he is not a spirit, b eca use the scene has been transferred into the ea rth - life. The Gnostics truly declared that all t he supernatural transactions asserted in the Christian Gospel \"were coun terparts (or r epresentations) of what took p lace a bov e.\" That is, they affirmed the history to b e mythical; t he ce lestial allegory made mund ane; and they were in the right, as the Egyptian Gospel proves. There a re Healers, and Jehoshua Ben - Pandira may have been on e. But, b eca use that is possible, we must not allow it t o vou ch for the im possible! Thus, in the Gospels, the mythical is, and h as to b e, continually reprodu ced as mi racle. That which n aturally pertains to the c haracter of the Sun - God b ecomes supernatural in appearance when b rought down to earth. The Solar God d escended into the nether world as the restorer of the bound to liberty, the dead to life. In this region the mi racles were wrought, and the transformations took p lace . The e vil spirits a nd destroying powers were e xorcised from t he mummi es; the halt and the maim ed were enabled to get up and go; the dead were raised, a mouth was given to the dumb, and the blind were made to see. This \"reconstitution o f the decea sed\" is transferred to the ea rth - life, whereupon \"the blind rece ive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are c leansed, the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up \" at the c omi ng of the Christ, who p erformed the mi racles.

The alleged facts of our Lord's life a s Jesus the Christ, were e qually the a lleged facts of our Lord's life a s the Horus of Egypt, whose very name signifies the Lord.

The mythical Christ was as s urely continued from Egypt as were the mythical types of the Christ on the Gnostic Stones and in the Catacombs of Rome! Once this ground is fel t to b e firm und erfoot it emboldens and warrants us in cutting the Gordian kno t that has been so d eftly complicated for us in the Epistles of Paul. To - day we have to face a problem t hat i s one of the most difficult; it i s my object to p rove that Paul was t he oppon ent and no t t he a postle of Historic Christianity. It is well kno wn to all serious students of the subject that there was an o riginal rent or r ift of difference between the preac her Paul and the other f ound ers of Christianity, whom he first m et in J erusalem -- namely, Cephas (or Peter), James, and John. He did no t think much o f them personally, but scoffs a littl e a t their pretensions to b eing Pillars of the Church. Those men h ad nothing in comm on with h im from t he first, and n ever forgave him for his independence and oppo sition to the last. But the depth o f that visible rift has not yet been fathomed in consequence of false a ssumptions; and my own researches and d etermi nation to look and think for myself have led me to the inevitable c onclusion that th ere is but one way in which it can b e bottomed for the first tim e. It is likewise more or less apprehended that two vo ices are heard contending in Paul's Epistles, to the c onfound ing of the writer's s ense a nd the c onfusion o f the reader's. They utter diffe rent doctrines, so fund amentally oppo sed as to b e for ever irreconcilable; and this dup licity of doctrine makes Paul, who is the one distinct and single - mi nded personality of the \"New Testament,\" look like the most doub le - face d o f men; doub le - tongued as th e serpent. The two do ctrines are those of the Gnostic, o r Spiritual Christ, and the historic Jesus. Both canno t be true to Paul; and my contention is that both vo ices did no t procee d from him personally. We kno w that Paul and the other Apostles did no t pr eac h the same gospel; and it i s my present purpose to show that they did no t set forth o r celebrate the same Christ. My thesis is, that Paul was not a suppo rter of the system kno wn as Historical Christianity, which was found ed on a belief in the Christ car nalised; an assumption that the Christ had b een made flesh; but that he was its uncea sing and d eadly oppon ent during his lifetim e; and that after his death h is writings were tampered with, interpolated, and re - indo ctrinated b y his old enemi es, the forgers and falsifiers, who first began to weave the web o f the Papacy in Rome. In this way there was added a fourth p illar or corner - stone to the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"original t hree in Jerusalem, which was turned into the c hief suppo rt of the whole structure; the firmest found ation o f the fallacious faith. The supreme feat, p erformed in secret by the managers of the Mysteries in Rome, was this conv ersion o f the Epistles of Paul into the main suppo rt of Historic Christianity! It was the very pivot on which the total im posture turned! I n h is lifetim e he had fought tooth and n ail, with tongue a nd p en, against the men who found ed the faith o f the Christ made flesh, and d amned eternally all disbelievers; and after his death they reared the Church o f the Sarkolatr√¶ abov e his tomb, and for ei ghteen centuries have, with a forged warrant, claim ed h im as being the first and foremost among the found ers. They cleverly damm ed the c ourse of the natural river that flowed forth from it s own independent source in the Epistles of Paul, and turned its wat ers into their own artificial canal, so that Paul's living force shou ld b e made to float the bark o f Peter. Nevertheless, those who care to look closely will see that the two waters, like those of the river Rhon e, will not mi ngle in one c olour! And it appe ars to me that, whether Paul was mad o r not in this life, such nefarious treatm ent of his writings was bad enou gh to d rive him frantic in the next, and make him i nsane there until t he wrong is righted. It i s the universal assumption that Paul, the persecut or of the ea rly Christians, was conv erted b y a vision o f the risen Jesus, who p roved h is historic nature a nd identity by appearing to Paul in p erson. So it i s recorded in the Acts of the Apostles. The acc oun t, however, is entirely oppo sed to that which is given b y Paul him self in h is Epistle to the Galatians. He tells how the c hange occurred, which h as been called h is conv ersion. It was by revelation o f the Christ within, bu t not by an ob jective vision o f a personal Jesus, who demonstrated in spirit world t he reality and identity of an h istoric Jesus of Nazareth, who had lately lived on earth. Such a version as that is rigorously im possible, acc ording to Paul's own words. His acc oun t of the matter is totally antipod al. He rece ived h is commi ssion to p reac h th e Christ, as he declares, \"when it was the good p leasure of God to reve al his Son in me,\" and therefore not by an apparition o f Jesus of Nazareth ou tside of him ! His Christ within was not the Corpus of Christian b elief, bu t the Christ of the Gnosis. He hea rd no vo ice e xternal to h im self, which could b e c onv erted into the a udible voice of an h istoric Jesus; and no thing can b e more instructive to b egin with, than a comparative study of these two v ersions, for showing how the matter has been manipulated, and t he facts perverted, for the purpose of establishing or suppo rting an orthodo x history. What he did h ear when caught up in the spirit he tells us was unspeakable; words which it i s not lawful for a man to u tter! He makes no mention o f a Jesus of Nazareth. I ndeed, Jesus of Nazareth is unkno wn to Paul! His name never once appears in the Epistles; and the significance of the fact in favou r of the present view can hardly be e xaggerated. So, Jesus of Nazareth do es not appear in the Gospel of Marcion; or, as it wa s represented b y some of the Christian Fathers, Marcion h ad removed the name of Jesus of Nazareth from his particular Gospel -- being so v irulent a heretic! Here we find Paul in agreement with Marcion, the Gnostic rejecter of Jesus of Nazareth, and o f histor ic Christianity. Moreover, Paul was the only apostle of the true Christ who was recognised b y Marcion. Now, as M arcion h ad rejected the human n ature of the Christ, and left t he sect which u ltim ately beca me the c hurch o f historic Christianity, it i s im possi ble that he c ould h ave a dop ted o r uph eld the Gospel of Paul as it has come down"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"to u s in ou r version o f the Epistles. Hence, Iren√¶us complains that Marcion d ismembered the Epistles of Paul, and removed those passages from t he proph etical writings which h ad been quo ted to teac h u s that they announ ced b eforehand the c omi ng of the Lord! That is, Marcion, the man who kn ew, recognised h is fellow - Gnostic in Paul, bu t rejected the literalisations and the spurious doctrines which h ad b een surreptiti ously interpolat ed b y the found ers, who were the forgers, o f Historic Christianity. Further, with regard to the Marcionites, Iren√¶us s ays they allege that Paul alone, o f all t he Christian teac hers, kn ew the truth; and that t o h im t he Mystery was manifested b y revelation. They spok e a s Gnostics of a Gnostic. At the same tim e, as Iren√¶us tells us, the Gnostics, o f whom Marcion was one, charged the other Apostles with h ypocrisy, b eca use they \"framed their doctrine according to the c apa city of their hearers, fabling b lind thin gs for the blind according to their blindn ess; for the dull, a ccording to their dulness; for those in error, according to their errors.\" Clement Alexander asserts that Paul, b efore going to Rome, stated that he would b ring to the Brethren (not the true Go spel history, bu t) the Gnosis, o r Gnostic c omm unication, the tradition o f the hidden mysteries, as the fulness of the blessings of Christ, which Clement says were revealed b y the Son o f God, the \"teacher who trains the Gnostic by mysteries,\" i.e., b y revel ations made in the state of trance. He was going there a s a Gnostic, and therefore a s the natural oppon ent of Historic Christianity. The c onv ersion o f Paul, acc ording to the Acts, is s uppo sed to h ave occurred sometim e after the year 30 A.D. at the ea rliest ; and yet if we acce pt the data furnished b y the book o f Acts and Paul's Epistle to the Galatians, h e must have been conv erted as early as the year 27 A.D. Paul states that after his conv ersion h e did no t go up to Jerusalem for three years. Then after 14 m ore years he went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas. This s econd v isit can b e dated b y means of the fami ne, which is historic, and kno wn to h ave occurred in the year 44, at which tim e relief was conv eyed to the brethren in Judea by Barnabas and Paul. If we take 17 years from 44, the different statements go to show that Paul had b een conv erted as early as the year 27. Thus, acc ording to the dates and the data derived from the Acts, from Paul's epistle, and the historic fact of the fami ne, Paul was conv erte d to Christianity in the year 27 o f our era! This could no t have been b y a spiritual manifestation o f the suppo sed p ersonal Jesus, who was not then d ead, and h ad no t at that tim e been re - begotten as the Christ of the ca non ical history. This is usually look ed upon (by Renan, for example,) as s uch an absurdity that no credence ca n b e a llowed to the acc oun t in the Acts. On the c ontrary, and no twithstanding all t hat has been said b y those whose work it i s to pu t a false bottom i nto the Unkno wn, I am free to mai ntain that nothing stands in the way of its being a possibilit y and a fact, except the a ssumption that it i s an im possibilit y. You canno t date one e vent by another which n ever occurred, o r, if it did o ccur, is not recorded b y Paul, especially when h is own acc oun t offers negative evidence of its non - occurrence. It is only using plain words justifiably to say that the concocters of the Acts falsify whenever it i s conv enient, and tell t he truth when they canno t help it! In Paul's own acc oun t of his conv ersion he c ontinues: \"Imm ediately, I conferred no t with the flesh and b lood ; neither went I up to Jerusalem to them who were Apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia.\" He did no t seek to kno w anything abou t the personal Jesus of Nazareth, h is life, h is mi r acles, h is crucifixion, resurrection,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"and ascension; had no anxiety to h ear anything whatever fr om li ving witnesses or relatives abou t the human n ature of this Divine Being, who is s uppo sed to h ave a ppeared to Paul i n p erson; completely changed the c urrent o f his life, and transformed h is character; no wish even to v erify the historic or possible ground - work for the reality of his alleged v ision o f Jesus! When h e did go up to Jerusalem, three years afterwards, and again in fourteen years, h e positively lear ned no thing whatever fr om t hose who ou ght to have been able to teac h h im and tell him all t hings on matters of vital im portance (for historic Christianity), abou t which h e shou ld h ave been most desirous to kno w, bu t had no manifest desire of kno wing.

He says these respectable persons, these pillars, who seemed to be somewhat, comm unicated no t hing to h im; contrariwise, it was he who h ad a gospel of his own, which h e had rece ived from no man, to comm unicate to them! He had come to bring them t he Gnosis. They privately gave him t he hand o f f ellowship, and o ffered to ackno wledge him i f he would k e ep ou t of their way with h is other gospel -- go to the Gentiles (or go to the Devil), and leave them alone. There was a c ompromi se, and therefore something to compromi se, thou gh no t on Paul's acc oun t; but the only point of genuine a greement between them was that they agreed to d iffer! On comparing notes, h e found that they were preac hing quite ano ther gospel, and ano ther Jesus. We kno w w hat their gospel was, b eca use it has come down to u s in the doctrines and do gmas of historic Christianity. It was the gospel of the literalisers of mythology; the gospel of the Christ made flesh to save mankind from an im possible fall; t he gospel of salvation b y the atoning blood o f Christ; t he gospel that would make a hell of this life, on pu rpose to win heaven h ereafter; the gospel of f lesh and ph ysics, including the c orporeal resurrection, and the imm ediate e nding of the world; the gospel that has no o ther world except at the end o f this. Theirs was that other gospel with its doctrines of delusion, against which Paul waged co ntinual warfare. For, ano ther Jesus, ano ther Spirit, and ano ther gospel were being preac hed b y these pre - emi nent apostles who were the oppon ents of Paul. He warns the Corinthians against t hose \"pre - emi nent apostles,\" whom he ca lls false proph ets, dece itful workers, and mi nisters of Satan, who came a mong them t o p reac h \"ano ther Jesus\" whom he did no t preac h, and a different gospel from t hat which they had rece ived from him . To the Galatians he says: \"If any man p reacheth un to you an y gospel other than that w hich ye rece ived, let him be damned;\" or let him be Anathema. He c hides them: \"O, foolish, Galatians, who d id b ewitch you? Are ye so foolish: having b egun in the Spirit, a re ye perfected in the flesh?\" That is, in the gospel of the Christ m ade flesh, the g ospel to those who were a t enmit y with h im , who followed on h is track like Satan sowing tares by night t o chok e the seed o f the spiritual gospel which Paul had so painfully sown, and who, as he intim ates to the Thessalonians, were quite ca pable of forging epistles in h is name to d ece ive his followers. It has never yet been shown how fund amental was this feud b etween Paul and the forgers of the fleshly faith, b eca use the real facts had no t been grappled with o r grasped concerning the totally different bases of belief, and the forever irreconcilable gospels of the Gnostic or spiritual Christ, and o f the Christ m ade flesh, to b e set forth as the Saviour of mankind, acc ording to Historic Christianity. It was im possible that Paul and Peter shou ld d raw or pull t og ether; t he different ground s of their faith were in the beginning from pole to po le a part. He says: \"I made k nown to you, b rethren, a s touching the gospel which was preached b y me, that it i s"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"not after man. For neither did I rece ive it f rom m an (or from a man), no r was I taugh t it , save through reve lation o f the Christ reve aled within.\" He did no t derive his facts from history, no r his gospel from t he Apostles; he was neither taught by man no r book. He derived h is gospel from direct personal revelation o f t he Christ within. In short, h is Christ was not t hat Jesus of Nazareth whom he never mentions, and whom t he others preac hed, and who may have been, and in all li kelihood was, Joshua Ben Pandira, the Nazarene. From t he present standpo int there is no do ctrina l difficulty, even abou t Paul being the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews. I do no t need to call i n another author here a nymore than elsewhere. The doub le - dealing of the interpolaters and forgers would b e ca use enou gh to acc oun t for all t he difference a nd the difficulty. They who would h ave, o r who had forged epistles in h is own n ame, would no t scruple to indo ctrinate his writings when they got the c hance; and if this epistle be not Paul's, then h is name a s author has been forged. Now, in this epistle, t he Christ is non - historical, h e is the Kronian Christ, the √Üonian manifestor of the mythical, that is astrono mi cal proph ecy; he is after the order of Melchizedek, who was \"withou t f ather, withou t mother, withou t genealogy, ha ving neither beginning o f days, no r end o f lif e.\" This was the e ver - comi ng one who could no t become a human p ersonage; and for that reason, I take it, Paul repud iates the genealogies of Christ. In advising Titus to give no h eed to \"Jewish Fables,\" he tells him t o \"shun foolish qu estioni ngs and g enealogies.\" He c oun sels Tim othy to warn h is followers against giving heed to \"fables and endless genealogies,\" such, for instance, as we now find in the ca non ical gospels of Matthew and Luke.\" These c ould h ave no application to the Christ of the Gnosis, h ence their absence from t he gospel acc ording to John. Human genealogy could no t i ndicate the Gnostic mode of the Divine Descent; could no t authenticate the \"Word\" of John, o r Philo; nor the Christ of Marcus, o r of Paul; consequently we learn that Marcus, the Gnostic, elimi nated the genealogies from t he gospel of Luke, and all t hat was written respecting the generation o f the Lord. The Docet√¶ who rejected the humanity of Christ had, as Epiphanius phrases it, \"Cut away the genealogies in the gospel a fter Matthew.\" Tatian, the pup il of Justin, who is called an \"Apostle from the Church,\" also struck ou t the genealogies that were intended to p rove the human d escent of the Christ; he who h ad on ce acce pted the gospel of the Christ m ade flesh, bu t rejected it when h e had learned to kno w better. This they did b eca use their Christ was s piritual, no t an h istoric Jesus; and the same reason ho lds good as an explanation for Paul. He repud iated the vain genealogies employed in v ain b y those who sought to establish a human line of descent for the Christ, b eca use he rejected the flesh - and - blood Jesus who was preac hed b y the a dvo cates of Historic Christianity. This being so, it follows that the opening passage of the Epistle to the Romans, which no w look s like Paul's f irst utterance to all t he world, b egins the tale of the interpolations, and thus appears in the right place , for it stands nearly alone in the writings of Paul, with its frank or forced ackno wledgment of the humanity of Jesus, b y admitti ng the Word made fl esh to be of the seed o f David. But the Christ of Paul could no t, at one a nd the same tim e, h ave been \"withou t genealogy\" and yet be of the seed o f Abraham or David. That would b e a complete reversal of his teac hing, who, in rejecting the genealogies, h ad already repud iated the descent from David. Moreover, Barnabas, the most intim ate friend o f Paul"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"and fellow - teac her with h im , who, as a Gnostic, d enied the human n ature of the Christ, and, like Paul, spok e disrespectfully of the other Apostles -- Barnabas ass ures us it was acc ording to the e rror of the wicked that Christ was called the Son o f David. Paul also tells us that no \"man can say that Jesus is the Lord, bu t by the Holy Spirit\" (1 Cor. xii. 3 ), and therefore not through the facts of an external history , or human p edigree. The Christ of the Gnosis was not conn ected with place any more than p ersonality, o r line of human d escent. His only birthplace was in the mi nd o f man. Consequently, in h is gospel, Marcion, who was a Gnostic Christian, do es not conn ect his Christ with Nazareth. His Christ is not Jesus of Nazareth. And this note of the Gnosis is apparent in the writings of Paul. His Christ is nowhere ca lled Jesus of Nazareth, no r is he born at Bethlehem, either of the Virgin Mary, o r of Mary the wife of C leopas, who was not the Virgin. Of course, either an h istoric Jesus could b ecome the Christ, as Saviour of the world, o r he could no t; and, as the world n ever was lost in any such sense a s the ignorant have derived from a fable mi sinterpreted, why he c ould no t, and as he c ould no t, then h e did no t, and Paul who was an Adept in the mysteries, a Master of the Hidden Wisdom, could n ever have mi staken the fable for a fact on which to bu ild h is s ystem of Christology; nor could he acce pt it from others. When on ce we have got the Gnostic c lue to the Hidden Wisdom, we find an un iversal argument amongst the Gnostics concerning their tenets. Wherever we meet with them t hey give us the Masonic grip; and b y the same sign we kno w that Paul was a Gnostic. This is further corrobo rated b y his own claim t o h ave been an Adept, a wise master - builder, on e who spok e wisdom amongst the Perfected. He was a Gnostic in the supreme degree, and all Gnostics agree that the Christ of the Gnosis could no t be made flesh, and therefore a ll are, and must be oppo sed to Historic Christianity, Paul included. It was as a Gnostic, a wise master - builder, that Paul laid the found ations which others built upon ; and the superstructure they reared b eca me the Church o f Historic Christianity. The Gnostic s were Christians in an esoteric sense, bu t not beca use they explained a human h istory esoterically. There was no h istory to explain un til t he myth had b een made e xoteric by those who were ignorant, o r who cunn ingly conv erted the Gnosis into h istory. It wa s the work o f Peter to make the mysteries exoteric in a human history. It was the work o f Paul to p revent this being effected b y explaining the Gnosis. Hints of this appear in the Epistles when h e speaks of his gospel, and the revelation o f his mystery con cerning the Christ, and warns his disciples against t he preac hing of that \"other gospel\" and \"other Jesus,\" which are oppo sed to h is own truer teac hing. As when he tells Tim othy to \"remember Jesus Christ according to my gospel,\" and says to the Romans, \"es tablish you a ccording to my gospel;\" that was the gospel of the Gnosis which he had b rought to them. We a re a lso able to watch the interpolators of his writings at their work. The tampering with the text of Paul's Epistles is s till m ade a pparent by a c omp arison o f the various rece nsions, as the marginal notes in the Revised v ersion yet suffice to show; and if this remains s o p alpable in the latest transcript, what m ust it have been in the ea rlier and nearest to the a uthor's original? In some instances, ins tead o f a perfect join, there is a gaping g ulf of doctrinal difference, too d eep for the interpolators themselves. There is a ludicrous mi xture of the historical Jesus and spiritual Christ in the First Epistle of Paul to Tim othy, where Christ Jesus is s pok en o f as he \"who, b efore Pontius Pilate, witnessed the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"good confession;\" and h alf a dozen lines later on Paul's Jesus is the \"lord o f l ords dwelling in light unapp roachab le, whom no man ha th seen, no r can see.\" That is the Christ of the Gnosis who could no t be made flesh to stand in the presence of Pontius Pilate. Again, Paul speaks as a spiritualist of our transformation in d eath and the continuity of consciousness, when h e says: \"Behold, I tell you a mystery, we shall not entirely sleep, bu t shall all be chang ed in a moment, in the twinkling o f an eye .\" This was the mystery of the Gnosis and the transformation revealed b y spiritual phenomena. Then follows the interpolated do ctrine of the resurrection at the last day: \"For the trumpet shall sound and the de ad shall be raised.\" Physically, which was im possible to Paul. These a re as oppo site a s yes and no, o r day and n ight. Once more, we kno w how emphatically Paul insists on the originality of his gospel. It was his very own, p ersonally rece ived b y revelation. He derived no thing from t he suppo sed apostles of an h istoric Jesus; t hey im parted no thing to h im , and h e rece ived no thing from any man. Yet in face of this fatal evidence the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which is assigned to Paul, is made to say, that the \"salvation first spoken through the Lord was confirmed un to u s by them that heard!\" And in h is Epistle to the Corinthians he is made to d eclare that he first of all delivered to them that which h e had rece ived (not by subjective revelation, bu t a ccording to the history externalised), \"How that Christ died for our s ins, a ccording to the Scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he hath app eared to Cepha s, then to the twelve, then h e app eared to abo ve five hund red o f the brethren a t once [this is piling it up!] then h e app eared to James, then to a ll t he apo stles, and last of all, a s unto on e born out of due time, h e app eared to me also, for I am the least of the apo stles, that am not meet t o b e c alled an apo stle.\" But James and Cephas were those w hom he saw in Jerusalem, and who, as he e xpressly tells us, h ad im parted no thing to h im ! The passage belies what Paul has elsewhere said, and is at war with all he was! So far fr om l owering him self in that way, h e a sserts in the very same e pistle: \"In no th ing was I behind these pre - eminent apo stles\" - therefore he was not behind in tim e! \"Let m e speak p roud ly!\" that was his attit ude when h e c ompared h im self with Cephas, James, and John. And if Paul ever did call him self an abortion (the true rendering of the sense), we may be sure that he did no t apply such a figure of that which is premature to the lateness of his birth as an apostle. It canno t be made to apply. The Gnostics tell us what he did mean. They alone could und erstand the a llusion, which carries the Christ of the Gnosis with it. The Christ appears to Paul, as to an abortion, just as did Horus the Christ to Soph ia (or Achamoth), when she forlornly lay outside of the pleroma a s an amorphou s abortion, and the Christ came a nd extended h im self cross - wise and gave her f lowing substance form! Here the Gnostic doctrine invo lves the Christ of the Gnosis, and no t of the human h istory. Paul applies the figure to h im self. If these statements had b een true, Paul m ust have been taught by men. This was to rece ive hi s information from Scriptures (whatsoever they may have been!), and was not t o rece ive his revelation solely from t he Christ, who came within, as he declares. In this way it becomes apparent how Paul's writings were made orthodo x by the men who p reac hed an other gospel than h is; with whom he was at war during his lifetim e, and who took a bitter - sweet revenge on h is writings by supp ression and addition, after he was dead and gone. The Christ proclaim ed b y Paul is frequently designated the \"first - born.\" He is the \"first - born o f all creation\" (Col. i. 16 ), \"the first - born from the dead\" (Col. i. 18 ), the \"first -"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"born a mong many brethren.\" \" Now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the first - fruits of them that slept!\" But in what sense? It is im possible to apply such d escriptions to any historical character. No Historical Jesus could be the First - born from t he dead. If continuity be a natural fact, as was held b y the Gnostics (and Paul was a Gnostic!), and is maintained b y all Spiritualists (and Paul was a Spirit ualist!), we shall li ve on b y a law of nature, no t by some jugglery with n atural law, called a mi racle, p erformed on ce upon a tim e! The first - born from t he dead could no t have waited for the resurrection un til Anno Domini; nor could ou r spiritual continuit y have been d emonstrated at that or any previous period b y a physical resurrection, such as forms the found ation o f the Christian faith! The doctrine e nun ciated b y Paul was Egyptian, Chaldean, Kabbalist, and Gnostic, and, as such, it can b e e xplained. In t he Ritual the soul that rises again from t he dead exults and exclaim s, \"I am the only one that comes forth from the bod y!\" that is, as the supreme soul of all t he seven; the one representative of the pleroma of powers, o r as Paul has it, \"the first - born o f many brethren;\" the first - born from t he dead, b eca use the only one that attained imm ortality, as the spiritual m an, o r the Christ, called the Second Adam by Paul; t hat celestial m an referred to b y Philo when h e says: \"There is the man whose name is East. A strang e app ellation if it had b een intended to speak of a man composed o f soul and bod y. But if it be the Incorporeal man, who comprehends in h imself t he divine Idea, it must be admitted that East is the name that suits him best;\" i.e., the re - orient m an of the resurrection, o r re - arising. It is the same Gnostic typology employed b y Paul when h e speaks of \"building up the bod y of Christ; till we all attain un to the unity of faith, and o f the k nowledge (or Gnosis) of the Son o f God; unto a full - grown man; unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.\" The fulness of the Christ being the Egyptian, Buddh ist, and Gnostic pleroma of all t he seven p rece ding powers that culmi nated in the Christhood. One titl e of the Gnostic Christ i s \"All t hings.\" He is called Totum, o r \"All t hings.\" Nothing short of the Gnosis can tell us why. The Christian world is withou t the Gnosis, and therefore withou t t he means of und erstanding Paul! Concerning the formation o r creation o f the Gnostic Christ in the c haracter of \"All t hings,\" or Totum, we a re told that \"The whole pleroma o f the √Üons, with on e design and d esire, b rough t together whateve r each on e had in h imself of the greatest beauty and p reciousness, and un iting a ll t hese contributions, so a s to skilfully blend th e whole, they produ ced a b eing o f most perfect beauty, the ve ry Saviour Christ.\" This \"All t hings,\" who was the c onsumm ate flower of the fulness or pleroma of the previous s even po wers, is the Christ of Paul, who, h im self, is \"All t hings,\" beca use in \"him are all t hings,\" and in \"all t hings\" he has the pre - eminence. \"All t hings are summ ed up in Christ\" (Eph. i. 10 ). \"Of him, through h im, and unto h im, a re all t hings\" (Rom. xi. 36 ). \"In h im dwelleth a ll t he fulness of the Godh ead bod ily\" (Col. ii. 9 ). That i s as the Gnostic Totum! -- the All -- The Christ -- the e ternal Soul or Spirit, in \"whom all t he treasures of wisdom and knowledge\" are hidden! He warns his followers against a ce rtain false teac her, whom he kno ws personally, and mi ght name, and whose teac hing i s after the \"tradition o f men, a fter the rudiments of the world, and not after the Christ\" of the pleroma. The Gnostic Christ was also called Eudo cetos, beca use the whole pleroma of the Godh ead was well pleased with h im as glorifier of the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Father. This is Paul's Christ, in whom t he whole fulness (pleroma) was pleased to d well. The text in Paul's Epistle to the Colossians s hou ld b e \"for the whole fulness was pleased to d well i n h im.\" There is neither \"God\" nor \"Father\" in the ca se. It is the whole Gnostic pl eroma of powers which made up the imm ortal soul, o r came to the c onsumm ate flower of soul in man, and the Godh ead in the Christ, as s um t otal of the powers. The Ancient Gnosis comes first. Paul repeats it; and then we have a n adaptation o f it t o the later gospel history, in which we hear the voice of the Father in h eaven saying: \"This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.\" The Gnostics did no t derive their kno wledge from t he history, any more than Paul did, and therefore it follows that the history w as derived from an adaptation o f the Gnosis. The found ers of Historic Christianity taught and enforced the doctrine that their Jesus the Christ had risen from t he dead, bod y, bon es, and all, and that he demonstrated the fact to his followers when h e declar ed that he was not a spirit! The resurrection, therefore, was physical from t he first! In a c onfession found in the Apostolic Creed, in the year 600, the conv ert has to say, \"I believe in the resurrection o f the flesh\"; and on ly the other day Canon Gregory declared in St. Paul's Cathedral, that i f you took away the physical resurrection o f Jesus, the one found ation o f their spiritual li fe was gone! If the Christ did not rise c orporeally from his tomb, then that tomb would b e the grave of Christianity. But P aul's doctrine of the resurrection is totally oppo sed to this cardinal doctrine of the Christian creed, the resurrection o f the bod y. He does not expect t o rise c orporeally beca use of any physical resurrection o f the Christ. His doctrine is that of the Gno stics, and consequently identifiable by the c omparative process. It is also entirely oppo sed to that which was proclaim ed b y his contemporaries, Hymen≈ìus and Philetus, who taught that the resurrection was past already, and who h ad ov erthrown the faith o f s ome in the doctrine preac hed b y Paul. He says \"they are in error,\" and \"their word will eat as doth a gang rene.\" Now, the sole way in which the resurrection could b e set forth as already past was the same then as it i s to - day -- namely, as the resurrection o nce for all of a personal and h istorical Saviour, who there a nd then arose from t he dead for the first tim e a nd instituted the resurrection. Paul's own resurrection from t he dead was not assured b y any such mi raculous, non - natural, o r im possible means! On the c ontrary, in a passage which shows a c leavage in the c ontext, h e breathes an aspiration thus: \"If by any means I may attain un to the resurrection from the dead\" -- therefore, no t t he means s et forth b y Historical Christianity -- and h e c ontinues: \"Not t hat I have already attained, o r am already made perfect, bu t I press on. \" Again, this is pure Gnostic doctrine. The Perfect were those who h ad reac hed the octave, o r height of attainment, in a sense which can only be und erstood b y the Gnosis. It was his endea vou r to reac h the Christhood o f the Gnosis on which the c ontinuity in d eath d epended -- a glim pse of which h ad b een ob tained by him i n abno rmal vision. This kind o f working out of one's own salvation, and earning one's own eternal li ving in this life, is abs olutely oppo sed to the Christian do ctrine of the Atonement! The old Jewish do ctrine of Atonement by blood, continued into h istoric Christianity, is provably im possible to a Gnostic a nd a spiritualist li ke Paul. But this was the doctrine promulgated b y thos e who p reac hed that \"other gospel\" which h e repud iated. Therefore I infer that t exts like these a re a part of the matter interpolated: \"Withou t shedding o f blood is no remission o f sin\" (Heb. ix. 22 ). \"Having made peace through the blood o f his cross\" (Col . i. 20 ). \"In whom we have our r edemption through h is blood \""},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"(Eph. i. 7 ). Such do ctrine being im possible to the Gnostic, I hold these texts to h ave been falsely fathered upon Paul. The two do ctrines canno t co - exist in on e mi nd, o r system of thou ght; and we have to ascertain which o f the two is the genuine Pauline doctrine before we ca n d etermi ne the nature of his Christology. Again h e says, \"wherefore let us cease to speak of the first principles of Christ, and press on un to p erfection, no t laying aga in a f ounda tion o f repentance from dead works, and o f faith towards God, o f the teaching o f bap tisms, and o f laying on o f hand s, and o f resurrection from the dead, and o f eternal judg ment, and this will we do!\" Here we find a c omplete repud iation b y Paul of cert ain cardinal doctrines of Historic Christianity elsewhere a scribed to h im ! These a re ca lled first principles, o r those belonging to an exoteric or exterior interpretation o f the Gnosis, which is look ed upon as a pernicious and d eadly heresy. They were a pa rt of those \"beggarly rudim ents\" which k ept m en in bond age to the Petrine gospel of the flesh. Paul positively repud iates, and most distinctly denies, salvation b y means of these Christian Sacraments! Those who h ave taken up with this teac hing are treated as backsliders from the true faith, which is that of Paul's own gospel, and o f the e soteric interpretation. \"For as touching those who were once e nlightened, and tasted o f the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and tasted the good wo rd o f God, and the powers of the age to come, and then fell away, it i s impossible to renew them aga in.\" Every special phrase reveals the Gnostic a nd the Gnosis. Those who fell away have lapsed from t he interior teac hing of Paul, and gone over to those who no w preac h the e xternalised h istory, the \"other gospel\" of the \"other Jesus,\" with its corporeal resurrection. Having been fed on solid food they have become such as have need o f mil k. This repud iation o f dogmas culmi nates in h is banishing the resurrectio n o f the dead, and the Eternal Judgment or pun ishment at the Last Day. Here the resurrection o f the dead must include that of the historic Jesus, if there had b een on e, and therefore this also is denied. He rejects any found ation laid on that, and says, \"l et us cea se to speak o f it.\" Paul, like a ll Gnostics, taught the resurrection from the dead in this life; not the resurrection OF the Dead in the life hereafter. Now, it i s quite ce rtain that these Gnostic doctrines could no t have been interpolated in Paul 's writings by the found ers of the Fleshly Faith. Therefore, it i s the physical dogmas that have been foisted into the Epistles of Paul. I have never yet seen a sign in the works of Christian writers that they knew anything whatever of the real nature of t hese doctrinal m ysteries. All alike a re ignorant of the Tradition o r Gnosis on which a true e xplanation d epended. They assume the human history as the initial point of a new beginning, and ignore, o r are ignorant of, that which lies beyond. When called upo n to face the facts in b road d aylight they themselves will be all i n the dark, and will have to fight against them blindfold. But it i s im possible to enter within range of und erstanding Paul's teac hing until we do kno w something of the doctrines that were unfolded in the mysteries. It is im possible to comprehend the mystery of Paul's Christ withou t a fund amental kno wledge of the Messianic mystery that had b een from t he Beginning. This was his mystery, which h e would no t m ake so much o f if he had started wit h what are held to b e plain h istorical gospel truths. He spok e the \"Wisdom of God in a mystery that hath b een h idden; which God foreordained b efore the worlds unto ou r glory.\" The \"mystery of Christ which in o ther generations was not made known.\" The \"myst ery which is Christ in you. \" His was the \"reve lation o f the mystery which ha th b een kept i n silence through times eternal.\" The fact i s that Paul was a"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"pub lisher of the a ncient m ysteries; t hat was why his enemi es s trove to k ill him ! He openly promulgated t he Gnosis which h ad always been k ept secret. But to comprehend him we must have some kno wledge of the Messianic mystery, which h ad an o rigin in phenomena that are both n atural and explicable. When on e has worked at the subject for years, it can b e e xplaine d in a few hou rs. The root of the Messiah's name is Mesi in Egyptian. One meaning, like that of the Christ in Greek and Messiach in Hebrew, is to anoint. But the fund amental signification is re - birth. The month, Mes - ore, was s o n amed from t he re - birth o f t he Inund ation. The mam - mesi was the re - birth - place of the man o r mumm y. The e vening meal on the first day of the New Y ear was the Mesiu, or festival of its birth. Cf. Sanskrit masa, for a moon o r month, and masala for a year. This re - birth could b e very va rious in ph enomena, and so was the typical Messiah o r re - born on e. The serpent called Mesi, the Sacred Word, was the Messiah b y name, b eca use the reptile sloughed its s kin, and renewed itself. Hence the Serpent was a symbol of the Gnostic Christ. Re - birth was the manifestation and the personified Manifestor was the Messiah, und er whichever type or in whatever phase of the phenomena. Re - birth of the Nile, o f the light in the moon, o f the tim e - cycle, o r of the Dead, could h ave its M essiah! Hence the Messiah h ad a monthly re - birth in the lunar orb, and a solar one e very y ear -- with re - birth from t he virgin mother in the Zodiac. But there was a more mysterious manifestation when the girl or boy attained pub escence, o r re - birth, into womanhood and manhood. Here th e Messiah is both male a nd female -- Charis as well as Christ; Wisdom as well as the Word! According to the natural facts, at that period o f re - birth was born the procreative power f or f urther ensuring the future re - birth o f the race . Men and women could rep rodu ce themselves in this life. Hence the re - birth o f the Anointed One, the Messiah o f Adultship. But beyond these natural re - births, it was demonstrated in the spiritual m ysteries of abno rmal m ediumship, that there was a spirit i n man, o r, at least, in so me men, that could reprodu ce itself, o r, b y alliance with the power abov e, could b e reprodu ced, o r re - born, for the next li fe. This was the Christ of the Gnosis, the Messianic Manifestor in a psychical or spiritual phase; the Revealer, acc ording to the mys tery of Paul. That which h e had rece ived from no man, was comm unicated to h im by this revelation o f the Christ. But m ark; in no on e of these phases, elemental, Kronian, o r human, could the Messiah, the Christ of the manifestation, b ecome a ny one historic p ersonage. Also, in the human ph ase, there is but one sense in which the Christ could b e born o f a virgin mother, and that can on ly be und erstood b y taking the Christ as the Imm ortal in man, and supp lementing it with the kno wledge that the mother was the fi rst recognised inspirer of the soul. When typified and made doctrinal, this mother, as quickener of the soul, this mother of the Horus, o r Christ, may be said to b e virgin in a region b eyond that of physical contact in the fleshly human ph ase. In a final f orm, the Messiah was the imm ortal spirit i n man, o r the Christ within, acc ording to the language of Paul. Those who und erstood these things could no t take to, o r be taken in b y, h istoric Christianity; could on ly think o f it as did Celsus when h e says of th e Christians: \"Certain most impious errors are c omm itted b y them, which a re due to their extreme igno rance, in which they have wand ered a way from the meaning o f the divine e nigmas\"; and as did Porphyry, who d enoun ced the Christian religion as a \"blasphemy, ba rbarously bold.\" The Christian do ctrine of being born aga in was derived withou t kno wledge from t his Gnostic re - birth, which was the c onv ersion o f the total m an, and h is s even lower souls, into a"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"likeness of his s upreme or divine self, with the e ighth on e, the Christ - spirit, as the reprodu cer f or eternal li fe. Paul sometim es claim s that he possesses this Christ - nature, this Revealer within, b eca use, acc ording to the Gnostics, hu manity could attain to the divine a ltit ude, and d emonstrate upon the Moun t of Transfiguration the imm ortal element in the nature of man. The Christian world let go, and lost this basis that Paul found in natural, thou gh supra - normal fact, when it i gnorantly substituted the modu s operand i of mi racle a pplied to a physical resurrection . But, as we have seen, this manifestor of the of the re - birth mi ght be femi nine a s well as masculine. In fact, the female a nnoun cer was first, and there a re mystical reasons for this in n ature. In Hebrew, the Holy Spirit, o r ruach, is of a femi nine gender . The soul is female. Some of the Gnostic sects assigned the soul to the female nature, and made their Charis not only anterior, bu t superior, to the Christ. In the Book o f Wisdom it i s Soph ia herself who is the pre - Christian Saviour of mankind. It was Wis dom t hat m en are taught, and she is the Saviour through kno wledge a nd good works. Whereas the Christ was turned into a Saviour through faith. The same Tree of Knowledge that supp lied the fruit which d amned the prim al pair in the Genesis, is the Tree of Wis dom i n the Apocrypha, where Wisdom, p ersonified as the Tree, exclaim s, \"I am the mother of fair love, and fear, and knowledge, and ho ly hop e. Come unto me all ye that be desirous of me, and fill yourselves with my fruits. For my memorial is s weeter than ho ney, and mine inheritance than the hon ey - comb. He that obeye th me shall neve r be c onfound ed.\" This complete reversal of the Christian b elief is to b e found in the Hidden Wisdom! Such was the interpretation, b y the men who kn ew, o f that Fable on which the F all of Man was based by those who h ave im posed on u s with their ignorance, and made us blind with their belief. Wisdom i s the renewer and renov ator of all t hings, and it i s s he who confers imm ortality on man; she who is the Christ as bringer to re - birth. T he Gnostic Marcus maintained that Charis was s uperior to \"all t hings\" or Totum; and Charis, the female Christ, was the illumi nating spirit of his teac hing, as when h e is made to say to h is mediums: -- \"Behold, Charis has descended upon thee; open thy mouth a nd p roph esy; open thy mouth and thou shalt proph ecy .\" Apply this to the Spirit as male, instead o f female, and you h ave the Christ, o r illumi nating spirit of Paul. It was a question o f priority in the type, and b elonged to a mystical interpretation o f natu ral phenomena. The blood o f Charis prece ded the blood o f Christ, and bu t for the purification b y the blood o f Charis, there would h ave been no do ctrine of the purification o f souls by the blood o f Christ. The Eucharist was a ce lebration o f Charis before it was assigned to the Christ. Again, Paul's Christ is identified with the a ngel Metatron, as the Messiah who followed the Israelites in the wilderness. Thus he makes the a ngel m asculine. But i n the Targumi sts' traditions the Well of Miriam t akes the place o f this s ustaining Christ, who was the spiritual rock acc ording to Paul. In the gospel of the Egyptians, quo ted b y Clement Alexander, the Lord says: \"I am come to d estroy the works of the Woman. \" The two manifestors, male a nd female, are c ontinued b y the \"S hepherd o f Hermas,\" which some of the Fathers regarded as a divinely inspired scripture. Here the spirit, o r Logos, who is an o ld woman -- i.e., the a ncient Wisdom -- in on e vision, b ecomes the son o f God in another! Of her it i s s aid: \"She is an o ld woman, b e cause she was the first of all creation, and the world was made by her.\" Wisdom, the woman, was first; she was the mother of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"God. Christ, the son, was s econd ; then h e superseded the female in on e representation; in another he was blended with h er, and cons equently portrayed in the im age of both sexes, as a spiritual type. The Wisdom or Soph ia of the Gnostics was first at the head o f the seven p re - planetary powers, and was called \"Ogdoa s,\" as mother of the first and inferior Hebdo mad; next the Christ was mad e the head as manifestor of the seven later planetary powers, called b y them t he superior Hebdo mad, h e being the outcome of a later creation, and representative of the Fatherhood in h eaven, which followed the fatherhood established on earth; and that same Gnostic manifestor of the seven po wers or Gods had been Iu in Egypt, Iao in Ph≈ìnicia, Assur in Assyria, and the Buddha or Agni in India, ages on ages earlier. Now Paul was oppo sed to those Gnostics who exalted the femi nine type of the soul -- the female a s b ringer to re - birth h ereafter. He repud iated it, and p roclaim ed h is Christ. His Word, Logos or Messiah, is s trictly masculine. In India this type would b e Linga ic versus the Yonian. He maintains that the \"Word b y Wisdom knew not God. \" This is exactly the sa me a s s aying that at one tim e men on ly recognised the motherhood in h eaven, and d id not kno w w ho were their own fathers on earth. The Lord is the spirit, the Christ is the spirit, h e declares; not Soph ia, no t the wisdom of a femi nine nature. Christ, h e a ff irms, is both the \"power and the wisdom of God. \" He proclaim s all t he treasures of Soph ia a nd o f the Gnosis to b e c ontained in the Christ, and says the Christ has been \"made unto u s Wisdom.\" The Christ has taken h er place . Again, h is glorifying is not in f leshly Wisdom, not in the female Charis, but in the grace of God (2 Cor. i. 12 ). For the female Wisdom had b een acc ording to the flesh, the woman o r mother being of the flesh fleshly; and Paul, as Gnostic or Kabbalist, h ad b een acquainted with the fleshly Wisdom, on e of whose mysteries appertained to femi nine periodicity, which h e now repud iates when h e says: \"Even though we have k nown Christ (or the manifestor) after the flesh, yet now w e know so no more.\" Here it canno t be pretended that Paul ever knew th e personal Christ in the flesh, and therefore some other fact has to b e e ncoun tered. However interpreted, h e is speaking doctrinally, and no t of two h istoric c haracters. Paul's is the Gnostic Christ as the Second Adam; t he man from heaven, whose type super seded the man o f earth. Paul knew w ell enou gh that Adam was not a man in the literal sense; he was the typical m an of the flesh; the son o f the woman; and as was the type, such was the a ntitype, when h e calls his Christ the second Adam, the later spiritual type of man, and o f the Father abov e. Neither were, o r could b e, h istoric personages. To u se his own words, \"These things are an a llegory.\" In h er most occult phase the femi nine messenger was a Word that could b e made flesh; for she was the flesh - maker, t he mother of Matter. But t his was on physiological ground s alone. Hence she was s uperseded b y the masculine messenger; the spirit t hat could n ever be made flesh. None but t he initiated in these matters could possibly kno w w hat was meant by this transfer of type, and substitution o f the Lord for the Lady, the Christ for Wisdom, the second Adam for the first. But there it i s truth - like at the bottom of the well; t he source of so much d ifficulty found in the depths of Paul's writings. And this contention o f Pa ul on b ehalf of one Gnostic dog ma aga inst ano ther has been made to look as if he were fervently fighting for an Historic Je sus. This transfer of type is not limit ed to Paul! For instance, the Vine was a femi nine symbol. Wisdom says, \"As the Vine brough t I forth\" (Ecc. xx iv. 17 ); and in the Book o f Proverbs"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Soph ia c ries, \"Come e at of my bread, and d rink of the wine I have mingled.\" The Fig - Tree in Egypt was the figure of the Lady of Heaven, who is pou rtrayed as the Tree of Life a nd Knowledge, in the ac t of f eeding souls. She literally gives her bod y as the Bread and h er blood as the Wine of Life! In the later Ptolemeian tim es this Tree was assigned to Soph ia or Wisdom! which shows the link b etween Egypt and Greece . The superseding of Soph ia is also illustrate d in the c ursing of the fruitless Fig - tree by the Canon ical Christ, where the Parable of Mythology is represented as a human h istory. In John 's Gospel the type has been transferred, just as the sayings were, to the masculine nature, and the Christ becomes the bread and wine of life. In the Apocrypha it i s Soph ia who is \"The brightness of the eve rlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodn ess!\" (Wisdom vii. 26. ) In the Epistle to the Hebrews the Christ takes the place of Soph ia. He is called the \"effulgence of t he glory\" of God, the \"very image of his substance.\" Nevertheless, the male Christ could no more be made flesh in a man than Soph ia o r Charis could ha ve previously been incarnated in an historical woman. You cann ot und erstand on e half withou t the other. Both must be taken together. The doctrine is doub ly and wholly oppo sed to any and all historical personality. But, we have not yet completely mastered the e ntire Mystery of Paul for modern u se; and it i s not possib le for any one but t he phenomenal Spiritualist, who kno ws that t he cond itions of trance a nd clairvoyance a re facts in n ature; only those who h ave e vidence that t he other world can op en and lighten with revelations, and p rove its palpable presence, v isibly and audibly; only those who except t he teac hing that t he human consciousness continues in d eath, and emerges in a personality that persists beyond the grave; only such, I say, are qualified to comprehend the mystery, o r rece ive the message, once truly deli vered to men b y the Spiritualist Paul, bu t which was thoroughly perverted by the Sarkolators, the found ers of the fleshly faith. In the first place he was an Initiate in the Gnostic Mysteries, called Kabbalist in Hebrew. He tells us how excee dingly jealous for the traditions he had b een, which must have included the traditional interpretation o f the mysteries and o f the Gnosis or hidden Wisdom. He was a perfected Adept. He knew the nature of the Kronian Christ, and o f the Spiritual Christ, acc ording to the Gnosis. Beyond that, Paul, on his own testim ony, was an abno rmal Seer, subject to the c ond itions of trance. He c ould no t remember if certain experiences occurred to h im i n the bod y or out of it! This trance c ond ition was the origin and source of his revela tions, the heart of his mystery, h is infirmit y in which h e gloried -- in short, h is \"thorn in the flesh.\" He shows the Corinthians that his abno rmal cond ition, ecstasy, illness, madness (or what not), was a phase of spiritual intercourse in which h e was divi nely insane -- insane on b ehalf of God -- but that he was rational enou gh in h is relationship to them. He says: \"I will come to visions and reve lations of the Lord. I knew a man in Christ fourteen years ago (whether in the bod y I know not; or whether out of th e bod y I know not; God knoweth), such an one c augh t up eve n in the third h eaven\" -- on b ehalf of that m an h e will glory. \"And b y reason o f t he excee ding g reatness of t he reve lations, wherefore that I shou ld no t be exalted o ver much, there was given to me a t horn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I shou ld no t be ex alted o ver much.\" Paul's Thorn in the Flesh h as been attributed to lechery, and to sore e yes; but no Christian comm entator kno wn to me has ever conn ected it with abno rmal phenomen a, except as mi racle. The Marcionites s aid the Mystery was manifested to Paul by revelation. Paul says the same. By this abno rmal"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"mode the Mystery was revealed to h im i n p erson. His eyes were opened, so that he c ould see for him self the truth that was taug ht in the Mysteries. If a Spirit appeared in v ision to Paul, that would po sitively prove the re - birth for a future life, and constitute the revelation o f his M essianic mystery. Paul's Christ, the Lord, is the spirit; his gospel is that of spiritual revelat ion, the c hief mode of manifestation b eing abno rmal, as it was, and h ad been, in the Gnostic mysteries. The Gnostic Christ was the Imm ortal Spirit i n man, which first demonstrated its existence by means of abno rmal or spiritualistic phenomena. It did no t a nd could no t depend on any single manifestation in on e historic personality. And when Paul says, \"I knew a man in Christ,\" we see that to b e in Christ is to b e in the c ond ition o f trance, in the spirit, as they phrased it, in the state that is comm on to wh at is now termed mediumship. Being in the trance c ond ition, o r in Christ, as he ca lls it, h e was caught up to the third heaven, and could no t determi ne whether he was in the bod y or out of the bod y. Here he identifies his Christ with a c ond ition o f being, and that cond ition with the a bno rmal phenomena kno wn to some of us who h ave studied Modern Spiritualism. This is the Gnostic Christ, no t the Christ of any special historic personality, who is s uppo sed to h ave manifested on ly once upon a tim e, and on ce for all. The Christ of the Gnosis, of Philo and of Paul prece ded Christianity, and is s ure to supersede it, b eca use it i s based upon facts kno wn in n ature a nd v erifiable to - day. It was those who were e ntirely ignorant of those subtle a nd ob scure facts, un fold ed in the Mysteries, who b eca me Christians in the modern sense, and b elieved, b eca use they were blind. Paul was both a Seer and a Knower. He beca me one of the pub lic demonstrators of the facts, just li ke a ny itinerant m edium of our tim e. He says to the Gal atians: \"Ye k now that because of an infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel unto you the first ti me, and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh, ye despised no t nor r ejected (or spat out); but ye rece ived me as an ang el of God, a s Christ Jesu s!\" This infirmit y of the flesh was his tendency to fall i nto trance. When it first occurred, at a given d ate, h e rece ived h is revelation and b egan to p reac h h is own gospel. He talked and taught as do the mediums in trance to - day. He rece ived h is revelatio ns -- visions and revelations of the Lord -- and gave proofs of the Christ, o r spirit, speaking within h im , speaking through h im , when h e was in trance. And on this ground they rece ived h im as an angel of God -- they rece ived h im as the Christ.

He is replying to the teac hing of one particular man who is proclaimi ng the \"Comi ng\" of the Christ and the day of the Lord, o r end o f the world, as being close a t hand. He says in effect -- Do no t be troub led o r beguiled b y any such ignorant trash. The Lord will not come in h is s ense, and canno t come in mi ne, except that m an o f sin b e revealed. No on e has ever dared to d ream t hat this \"Man o f Sin\" is Peter him self! But the person aim ed at is considered capable of forging epistles in the name of Paul; t hus attributing this kind o f teac hing to h im , and making him father it whilst Paul was yet li ving. This \"man o f sin\" and \"son o f perdition\" has s et him self up in the temple of God, setting h imself f orth a s God. This is no emperor Nero, bu t a portrait of Peter, the life - long enemy of Paul; he whose preac hing is concerning signs and lying wond ers, such as the stories abou t the e nd o f the world, the p assing away of the heavens with a great noise, the dissolution o f the e lements with fervent heat, and the burning up o f the ea rth with all t he works therein, and o ther teac hings of this cataclysmalist, which Paul denoun ces as delusive, and kno ws to b e a li e! This mi sleader of men is restrained for the tim e being by Paul him self, bu t when h e departs Peter will reveal him self or be revealed in h is true c olours, and the Thessalonians will t hen see what Paul has kno wn all along, and against which h e had warned them once before, i.e., against that working o f error and belief in a lie, which we now know by name as Historic Christianity. It is here, then, that we ca n p eer r ight down into the deep, d ark gulf that divided Peter from Paul, o f which we get such a light ning g lim pse in the Clementine Homili es. These writings were inspired b y the faction o f Peter. By them Paul is designated the \"Hostile Man\"; his own epithet, Anomas, the Lawless, is there flung back at him by Peter, who denoun ces the puerile preac hing of t he man that is his enemy, and who says: \"Thou ha st oppo sed thyself as an Adversary aga inst me, the firm rock, the founda tion o f the Church.\" Paul's conv ersion, b y means of abno rmal vision, is attributed to the false Christ, the Gnostic a nd Spiritualist opp osed to an Historic Christ. In Homil y 17, Peter is obv iously hitti ng at Paul and h is visions when h e a sks: \"Can an yone be instituted to the office of a teacher through visions?\" Paul is treated as the a rch - enemy of the Christ crucified -- he is the very Anti - Christ. He will be the a uthor of some great heresy which is expected to break ou t in the future. Peter is s aid to h ave declared that Christ instructed the disciples not to pub lish the only true a nd genuine gospel for the present, b eca use the false teac her must arise, who would pub licly proclaim t he false gospel of the Anti - Christ that was the Christ of the Gnostics. \"As the true Proph et has told u s, the false gospel must come from a certain misleader;\" and so they were to go on secretly promulgating the tr ue gospel,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"until t his false preac her had p assed away. This true gospel was confessedly \"held in reserve, to b e secretly transmitted for the rectifi cation o f future heresies.\" They knew well enou gh what had to come out, if Paul's preac hing, p roclaim ed in h i s original Epistles, got vent m ore a nd more. It was Paul whom t hey had reason to fear. Hence those who were the followers of Peter and James anathematized h im as the great apostate, and rejected h is Epistles. Justin Martyr never once mentions this found er of Christianity, never once refers to the writings of Paul. Strangest thing of all i s it t hat the book o f the Acts, which is mainly the history of Paul, shou ld contain no acc oun t of his martyrdom or death in Rome! The gulf, ho wever, canno t be c ompletely fa thomed, except on the ground s that there was no p ersonal Christ, and that Paul was the natural oppon ent of the men who were setting up the Christ m ade flesh for the salvation o f the world that never was lost. My conclusion is, that fabricated evidence is t he sole suppo rt of Historic Christianity which can b e derived from t he Epistles of Paul; t hat the manipulation for an ulterior purpose, which is s o obv ious in the book o f Acts, was far more subtly and fund amentally applied to h is Epistles and do ctrines; th at they have been worked ov er as thieves manipulate stolen linen when they pick ou t the marks of ownership to escape from detection; that false doctrines have been foisted into the original text, which seems to h ave been withheld for a ce ntury after the wr iter's death, un til t he leaven o f falsehood had don e its fatal work. The problem of the plotters and forgers in Rome was how to conv ert the mythical Christology into h istoric Christianity, and when Paul's Epistles were permitt ed to emerge from obscurity in a c ollection, what had o ccurred was the restoration of the ca rnalised Christ, that \"other Jesus\" who was repud iated b y Paul i n h is own lifetim e. Paul felt or f eared, and foretold that this would b e the ca se when on ce he was removed ou t of the way. He saw the mystery of lawlessness already at work -- the falsifiers s ending forth letters as if fr om him self -- and we have seen what Paul foresaw! the problem of the plotters who forged the found ations of the Church in Rome was how to succe ssfully blend the Christ J esus of the Gnostics, o f the pre - Christian Apocrypha, o f Philo, and o f Paul, with that Corporeal Christ and im possible personality, in whom t hey ignorantly believed, through a blind literalisation o f mythology, so as to make the historic look like the true starting - point, and the Gnostic interpretation b ecomes a later heresy. This was finally effected when the declaration o f John -- that \"the Word was made flesh and d welt among u s\" -- had b een acce pted as the genuine Gospel, and that which h ad b een an im possibi lity for the Gnostics was an acc omplished fact for those who kn ew no b etter than to b elieve. The Gospel, acc ording to John, was concocted and calculated to serve a s a harmonising amalgam of doctrines that were fund amentally oppo sed. In this Amalgam they tr ied to mi x the \"gall and hon ey,\" so that, if \"well shaken b efore taken,\" it mi ght be swallowed b y the followers on bo th sides. But t here was a great gulf f orever f ixed between the Gnostic Christology and Historic Christianity. It was a gulf that never coul d be sound ly bridged, and n ever has been p lumbed, o r bottomed, o r filled in. The bod ies of two milli on martyrs of fr ee - thou ght, pu t to d eath as heretics, in Europe a lone, and all t he blood that has ever been shed in Christian wars, h ave failed to fill t hat gulf, which waits as ever wide - jawed for its prey. Across that gulf the Christian Church was erected upon suppo rts on either side. On on e side stood those pillars of the Church which were seen b y Paul in Jerusalem. On the other was Paul him self, the pilla r that stood alone. A difference the most radical and p rofound d ivided h im from t he other apostles, Cephas, John, and James.

The c urrent ignorance of those pre - Christian evidences that have been p reserved b y the petrifying past m ust be well - nigh invincible, when a man like Professor Jowett could say, as if with the voice of s uperstiti on in its dotage, \"To u s the preaching o f the Gospel is a New Beginning, from which we date all t hings; beyond which we neither desire, no r are able, to inqu ire.\" It is the c omm only acce pted o rthodo x belief that Christianity originated with the l ife, mi racles, sayings, and teac hings; t he birth, d eath, resurrection, and ascension o f an historic Jesus the Christ at the c omm encement of our era, called Christian; whereas, the origins were manifold, bu t m ostly concea led.

The mythos having been at l ast pub lished as a hu man h istory everything else was supp ressed o r f orced to suppo rt the fraud.

The Christ was a type a nd a titl e that could no t become a person. As such, the Christ of the Gnostics was the Horus continued from Egypt and Chaldea; and that which was original as mythos ages earlier canno t be a lso o riginal as a later personal history. We who comm ence with ou r cano nical Gospels are three or f our centuries too late to learn anything fund amental concerning the real beginnings of Christianity. You have only to turn to the second Book o f Esdras to learn that Jesus the Christ of our canon ical history was both p re - histori c a nd, p re - Christian. This is one of the book s of the hidden wisdom which h ave been rejected and set apart as the Apocrypha -- considered to be spurious, b eca use they are oppo sed to the rece ived h istory; whereas, they contain the secret Gnosis by which alone we ca n identify the genuine Scripture. In this book it i s said, \"My son Jesus s hall be reve aled with those that are with h im . . . . and they that remain shall rejoice within four hund red years; and a fter these ye ars s hall my son Christ die, and a ll men s hall have life.\" And this was to b e e ven as it had b een in the former judgments at the e nd o f the particular cycles of tim e, and the renewal of the world, which was to o ccur acc ording to d ate! Now, if an h istoric Jesus Christ of proph ecy is to b e found any where it i s here, -- foretold even as the prediction is s uppo sed to h ave been fulfiled. Yet these book s are not included among the ca non ical Scriptures, b eca use they prove too much; beca use they are historical in the wrong sense, -- i.e., they are not and coul d no t be made humanly historical; t heir Jesus Christ i s entirely mythical, -- is the Kronian Christ; and h is future c omi ng therein announ ced was only the subject of astrono mi cal proph ecy. The true Christ, whether mythical or mystical, astrono mi cal or spiritu al, n ever could b ecome a n h istorical personage, and n ever did o riginate in any human h istory. The types of themselves s uffice to p rove that the Christ was, and could only be, typical, and n ever could h ave taken form i n h istoric personality. For one thing, the mystical Christ of the Gnosis and o f the pre - Christian types was a being of both sexes, as was the Egyptian Horus and o ther of the Messiahs; beca use the mystical Christ typified the spirit or soul which b elongs to the female a s well as to the male, and represents that which could on ly be a human reality in the spiritual domain o r the Pleroma of the Gnostics. This is the Christ who appears as both male a nd female in the Book o f Revelation. And the same biune type was continued in the Christian po rtraits of the Christ. In Didron's Icono graphy y ou will see that Jesus Christ is portrayed as a female with the beard o f a male, and is called Jesus Christ as Saint Soph ia, -- i.e., the Wisdom, o r the Spirit of both sexes. The ea rly Christians were ignorant of this typology; but the types still remain to b e interpreted b y the Gnosis and to b ear witness against the History. Both the type a nd do ctrine c ombine to show there c ould b e no on e personal Christ in this world or any other. Howsoever the written word may lie, t he truth is visibly engraved upon the stones, and still survives in the Icons, symbols, and do ctrines of the Gnostics, which remain to p rove that t hey preserved the truer tradition o f the origines. And so this particular pre - Christian type was continued as a portrait of the historic Christ. It can b e proved that the ea rliest Christians kno wn were Gnostics -- the men who kn ew, and who never did o r could acce pt Historic Christianity. The Essenes were Christians in the Gnostic sense, and acc ording to Pliny the e lder, they were a Hermetic Society that had"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"existed for ages on ages of tim e. Their name is best explained as Egyptian. They were kno wn as the Eshai, the healers or Therapeut√¶, the physicians in Egypt; and Esha or Usha means to do ctor or heal, in Egyptian. The Sutites, the Mandaites, the Nazarites, as well as the Docetae a nd Elkesites, were a ll Gnostic Christians; they all prece ded, and were a ll oppo sed to, the c ult of the ca rnalised Christ. The followers of Sim on, the Samaritan, were Gnostic Christians, an d they were of the Church at Antioch, where it i s said the name of Christian was prim arily applied. Cerinthus was a Gnostic Christian, who, acc ording to Epiphanius, d enied that Christ had come in the flesh. The same writer informs us that, at the e nd o f th e fourth century, there were Ebionite Christians, whose Christ was the mythical fulfiler of the tim e - cycles, no t an h istoric Jesus. Even Clement Alexander confesses that his Christ was of a nature that did no t require the nou rishment of corporeal food. Now , from t he tim e of Iren√¶us to that of Mansell, it has been confidently asserted that Gnosticism was a heresy of the second century, a backsliding and apostacy from t he true faith o f historic Christianity. This is s im ply a delusion o f the ignorant, found ed on the original li e of the falsifiers! Later teac hers of Gnosticism, such as Basilides and Saturninus, d id arise during the second century; but these were not the found ers of any fresh do ctrines, no r did they make a ny new departure. They were Revivalists! The Christian Fathers only knew of the Gnostics of their tim e; they never troub led to trace the roots of Gnosticism i n the remoter past. The Christian report respecting the Gnostics, Docetae, and o thers, always assumes the human reality of the suppo sed h is tory, and then explains the non - human interpretation o f the Gnostics themselves as an h eretic denial, o r perversion o f the a lleged facts. Hence the Gnostics are c harged b y Iren√¶us with falsifying the oracles of God, and trying to discredit t he word o f reve lation with their own wicked inventions. We learn from Origen that, du ring the third century, there were various different versions of Matthew's gospel in circulation, and this he a ttributes partly to the forgers of gospels. Jerome, at the e nd o f the fourt h century, asserts the same thing; and o f the Latin v ersions he says, there were a s many different t exts as manuscripts. The Gnostics, who h ad brought on the original and p re - Christian matter of the mysteries that were taught orally, no soon er place d it on record than they were said to b e forging the Scriptures of Anti - Christ, whereas it was the Gnosis of the Ante - Christ of whom t hey, the Christians, were ignorant. Theirs is altogether a false mode of describing the position o f those who always and utterly denied that the Christ could b e made flesh, to suffer and d ie upon a veritable c ross. Here is a specim en o f the way in which the Gnostic doctrines had b een turned to h istoric acc oun t: -- The true light which lighteth every man comi ng into the world was Gnos tic, and h ad b een Gnostic a ges before the prologue of John was written; and as Gnostic doctrine it has to b e read. This Light of the world, bo rn, as the Gnostics held, with every one c omi ng into the world, is the imm ortal principle in man! Hyppo lytus, refe rring to the teac hing of Basilides, a Gnostic teac her of the second century, shows us how the doctrine"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"of the Gnostics was falsified. \"And this,\" says he, \"it i s which is s aid in the Gospels, 'The true light which lighteth eve ry man was coming into the wor ld!'\" \"Was comi ng\" is an interpolation o f the believers in the fact of historic fulfilm ent applied to that eternal li ght which lighted every man comi ng into the world; the light that dawned within, and could not come withou t in any form of f lesh o r histori c personality. The Emperor Julian also remarks on the monstrous doings and fraudu lent m achinations of the fabricators of Historic Christianity. We may look upon the Gnostics as Inside Christians; the others as Christians Withou t. Never were mortals more p erplexed, b ewildered, and taken b ack, than the Christians of the second, third, and fourth centuries, who h ad started from t heir own n ew beginning, warranted to b e solely historic, when they found that an apparition o f their f aith was following them one wa y and confronting them i n another -- a faith no t found ed on their alleged facts, claimi ng to b e the original religion, and ages on ages earlier in the world -- a shadow that t hreatened to steal away their substance, mocking them with its aerial unreality -- the hollow ghost of that bod y of truth which they had embrace d as a solid and eternal possession! It was horrible. It was devilish. It was the devil, they said; and so they sought to acc oun t for Gnosticism, and fight down their f ears of the phantom t errifying them i n front and rear: the Gnostic a nte - Christ who h ad no w become their anti - Christ. The only primiti ve Christians then apart from, o r prece ding, the Christianised p agan church o f Rome, were the various s ects of Gnostics, no t one of which was found ed on a n historical Christ. One a nd all t hey based upon the mystical Christ of the Gnosis, and the mythical Messiah, -- Him who shou ld come beca use he was the Ever - Comi ng One, as a type of the Eternal, manifesting figuratively in tim e. Historic Christianity can fur nish no sufficient reason why the biography of its personal found er shou ld h ave been h eld b ack; why the facts of its origin shou ld h ave been k ept dark; and why there shou ld h ave been no authorised record made kno wn earlier. The c onv ersion o f the mythos, an d o f the Docetic doctrines of the Gnosis into hu man h istory, alone will acc oun t for the fatal fact. The truth is, the ea rliest gospels are the furthest removed from t he suppo sed hu man history. That came last; and on ly when the spiritual Christ of the Gnosi s had b een rendered concrete in the density of Christian ignorance! Christianity began as Gnosticism continued, b y means of a c onv ersion and p erversion, that were oppo sed in v ain b y Paul. The mysteries of the Gnostics were c ontinued, with a difference, as Christian. The newly - christened re - beginnings were not only shroud ed in mystery, they were the same mysteries at root as those that were pre - extant. The first Christians found ed on secret doctrines that were only explained to initiates during a long course of years. These mysteries were never to b e divulged o r promulgated un til t he belief in h istoric Christianity had taken p ermanent root. We a re told ho w it was held b y some that the Apocrypha ought only to b e read b y those who were perfected, and that these writings were reserved exclusively for the Christian adepts. It m ust be obv ious that the doctrine or kno wledge that was forced to b e kept so sacredly secret as that, could h ave had no relation to the human h istory, p ersonality, o r teac hings of an inspired found er of that primiti ve Christianity suppo sed to h ave had so sim ple a n o rigin. True history is not established in that way, althou gh the false may be -- as it has been.

In this we see the f orgers fighting against the Gnostic Christ. There were many sects of so - called Christians, and v arious versions of the Christ; whether Kronian, mythical, o r mystical. But the Church o f Rome was the Christian church with found ations in Egypt; hence the deit ies of Egypt which h ave been discovered at the found ations of Rome; and when h istoric Christianity hasn't a bit of ground left to stand upon, the Church o f Rome will be a ble a nd p repared to say, \"We neve r did really stand on that ground, and no w w e alone c an stand withou t it . We are the one true c hurch with founda tions in an illi mitable past.\" According to the unqu estioned tradition o f the Christian Fathers, which h as always been acce pted b y the Church, the prim ary nucleus of our canon ical gospels was not a life of Jesus at all, bu t a c ollection o f the Logia, o racles, o r sayings, the Logia Kuriaka, which were written do wn in Hebrew or Aramaic, b y one Matthew, as the scribe of the Lord. Clement Alexander, Origen, and Iren√¶us agree in stating that Matthew's wa s the prim ary gospel. This tradition rests upon the testim ony of Papias, Bishop o f Hieropo lis, and friend of Polycarp, who is s aid to h ave suffered martyrdom for his faith du ring the reign o f Marcus Aurelius, abou t 165 - 167 A.D. Papias is named with Pant≈ìus , Clement, and Amm onius as one of the a ncient interpreters who agreed to und erstand the Hex√¶meron as referring to an h istoric Christ and the Church. He was a believer in the mill ennium, and the second comi ng of the Lord, and therefore a literaliser of myth ology. But there is no reason to suspect the trustworthiness of his testim ony, as he no doub t believed these \"sayings\" to h ave been the spok en words of an h istoric Jesus, written do wn in Hebrew by a personal follower named Matthew. He wrote a work on the s ubject, entitl ed Logion Kuriakon Exegesis, a c omm entary on the sayings of the Lord. A surviving fragment of this last work, quo ted b y Eusebius, tells us that Matthew w rote the sayings in the Hebrew dialect, and eac h on e of the believers interpreted them as he was best able. Thus, the beginning of the ea rliest gospel was not biographical. It was no record o f the life a nd doings of Jesus; it contained no actual historic e lement, no thing more than the Sayings of the Lord. It is not pretended that our gospel, a ccording to Matthew, is the identical work o f the scribe who first wrote down the logia, bu t the statement of Papias is s o far corrobo rated inasmuch as the sayings ascribed to Jesus are the basis of the Book. We read \"When Jesus had finished these sayings, \" or parables, several tim es over. Now, there is plenty of evidence to show that these sayings, which are the a dmitt ed found ations of the ca non ical gospels, were not first uttered b y a personal Found er of Christianity, no r invented afterwards by any of his followers. Many of them were pre - extant, p re - historic, and p re - christian. And if it can b e proved that these oracles of God and Logia of the Lord are not original, if they can b e identified as a c ollection, an olla pod rida of Egyptian, Hebrew, and Gnostic sayings, they can afford no evidence that the Jesus of the Gospels ever lived as an h istoric teac her. To b egin with, two o f the sayings assigned to Matthew to Jesus as the personal teac her of men are these: -- \"Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth, \" etc., and, \"If ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive y ou\" ! But these sayings had already been u ttered b y the femi nine Logos called Wisdom, in the Apocrypha. We find them i n the Book o f Ecclesiasticus; \"Lay up thy treasure according to the Comm and ments of the Most High, and it shall bring thee more profit t han go ld,\" and \"Forgive thy neighbou r the hurt that he hath don e thee, so shall t hy sins also b e"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"forgiven when thou p rayest\"! Wisdom was the Sayer personified long anteri or to the Christ. But it has never been p retended o r admitt ed b y mankind that wisdom was ever incarnated on this earth as a woman! Yet Wisdom, o r Charis, h ad the prim ary right to incarnation, for she prece ded the Christ. Luke a lso quo tes a saying of Wisdom -- \"Therefore also said the Wisdom of God, 'I will send them proph ets and apo stles, and some of them they shall slay and p ersecute';\" \" that the blood o f all t he proph ets which was s hed from the founda tion o f the world may be required o f this generation. \" Th is also is quo ted o r adapted from t he words of Wisdom recorded in a Book o f Wisdom (Esdras 2nd ), where we read \"I sent unto you my servants, the proph ets, whom ye have taken and slain, and torn their bod ies in p iece s, whose blood I will require of your han ds, said the Lord. Thus s aith the Almighty Lord, your hou se is desolate\" ! In the verses imm ediately prece ding, the speaker in the Book o f Esdras had said. \"Thus s aith the Almighty Lord, Have I not prayed you a s a Father his s ons, a s a mother her daugh ters, and a nu rse her young bab es, that ye would b e my people, and I shou ld b e y our God; that ye would b e my children, and I shou ld b e y our Father? I gathered you together as a h en ga thereth h er chicke ns und er her wings; but now w hat shall I do un to you? I will cast you ou t.\" This is in on e of the Book s of Wisdom hidden away in ou r Apocrypha. Now, if we turn to the gospels of Luke a nd Matthew w e shall find that t hey have quo ted these words of Wisdom: but we now see that Wisdom i s not credited with h er own saying s concerning the Father God! On the c ontrary, they are given to an h istoric Christ, as a personal teac her and a proph et. That which was s aid o f the hou se of Israel by Wisdom i n Esdras is now applied to the c ity of Jerusalem by the Christ; and if you re - dat e a saying like that by a few hund red years there is littl e wond er if it dislocates the history. Paul li kewise quo tes the saying from t he Book o f Esdras when h e says, \"I will rece ive y ou and will be to you a Father, and ye shall be to me Son s and Daugh ters saith the Lord Almighty.\" But he does not refer or re - apply it t o Jesus as is don e in the Gospels! Here we see the c urrent coinage of Wisdom has been d eface d b y the Gospel compilers -- not by Paul -- and then re - issued und er the sign and superscription o f ano ther name, that of Jesus the Christ; and h istoric evidence of a nature like that is as futile a s the negro's non - effective c harge of gunpo wder which h e shrewdly suspected o f having been fired o ff before. Paul li kewise quo tes or refers to on e of the sayings found in Matthew. \"Faithful is the saying, \" he writes to Tim othy. But althou gh h e is s peaking of the Christ, h e does not say his saying, no r refer it to an h istoric teac her. It was one of the sayings, o r true words, called the \"Logia,\" which h ad b een the dark sayings and p arables of the pre - christian mysteries from of old, and which in Egypt were the sayings of Truth h erself. The Hebrew Psalmi st says, \"I will utter dark sayings of old.\" The Proverbs of Solomon are the sayings. The Jewish Haggadah were the sayings. The Comm andments were sayings, as is s hown b y Paul, Rom. xiii. 9. Peter, in the Clementine Recognitions, do es not pretend to \"pronoun ce the sayings of t he Lord a s s poken b y himself\" (or profess that they were spok en b y him self in p erson, as I read the passage), h e admit s that it i s not in their commi ssion to say this. But they are to teac h and to show from t he sayings how every one of them i s based upon truth. This is in reply to Sim on Magus, who h as pointed ou t the c ontradictory nature of the sayi ngs. I hold it only to b e a matter of tim e a nd research to p rove that the sayings in general assigned to Jesus, which are taken to d emonstrate his historic e xistence a s a personal teac her, were pre - extant, p re - historic, and p re - christian. One of the saying s in the Mysteries reported b y Plato was,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"\"Many are the Thyrsus - bearers but few are the Mystics,\" which is echoed twice over by Matthew in the saying, \"Many are c alled bu t few are c hosen.\" \" It is more blessed to g ive than to rece ive,\" is one of the Logia o f the Lord quo ted in the book o f Acts, bu t not found in the Gospels. Two o f the sayings are identified as Essenic by Josephu s, who says the Essenes s wear not at all, bu t whatsoever they say is firmer than an o ath; and when Jesus says, \"A new comm and ment I give unto you, that ye love one ano ther,\" there was certainly nothing new in that which h ad b een a c omm and and a practice of the Essenes ages before. Men kn ew w ho were the Essenes by their love for one a nother. Some of the parables appear in the Talm ud, am ongst them are those of the Wise a nd Unwise Builders and that of the Marriage Feast. Various s ayings are c ollected from t he Talm ud, such as the golden rule, \"Do un to o thers as ye would they shou ld do un to you. \" \" Love thy neighbou r as thyself.\" \" With the me asure we mete we shall be measured aga in.\" \" Let thy yea b e just and thy nay be likewise just.\" \" Whoso looketh upon the wife of ano ther with a lustful eye is considered a s if he had comm itted adu ltery.\" \" Be of t hem that are persecuted, no t of t hem that pers ecute.\" But as Deutsch h as s aid, to assume that the Talm ud bo rrowed these from t he New Testament would b e like a ssumi ng that Sanskrit sprang from Latin. The nature of the \"Sayings\" is ackno wledged b y Iren√¶us when h e says, \"According to no one Saying o f the heretics is the word o f God made flesh.\" That is the Sayings which were c urrent among the Gnostics as Knowers. Marcion kn ew and quo ted the Gnostic saying which was afterwards amplified and quo ted in John 's Gospel -- \"No on e k new the father s ave the son, no r the son save the father, and h e to whom he will reve al him.\" This is a Gnostic saying, and it i nvo lves the Gnostic doctrine which canno t be und erstood independently of the Gnosis. It is quo ted as one of the sayings before it was reprodu ced in the Gospel a ccording to John. Such sayings were the Oral teac hings in all t he mysteries ages before they were written down. Some of them are so ancient as to b e the c omm on p roperty of several nations. Prescott gives a few Mexican sayings; one of these, also found in t he Talm ud and the New Testament, is called the \"the old p roverb.\" \" As the old p roverb says -- 'Whoso regards a woman with curiosity c omm its adu ltery with h is eye s.'\" And the third comm andment acc ording to Buddh a is -- \"Comm it no adu ltery, the law is broken b y eve n looking a t t he wife of ano ther man with lust i n the mind. \" Amongst other sayings assigned to Buddh a we find the one respecting the wheat and the tares. Another is the parable of the sower. Buddh a likewise told o f the hidden treasure which may be laid up b y a man and k ept securely where a thief canno t break in and steal; t he treasure that a man may carry away with h im when h e goes. The story of the rich youn g man who was comm anded to sell all he had and give to the poo r is told o f Buddh a. It is reported that he a lso said -- \"You may remove from their base the snowy moun tains, you may ex hau st the waters of the ocean, the firmament may fall t o earth, bu t my words in the end will be accomplished.\" Some of Buddh a's s ayings are uttered in the same c haracter as that of the ca non ical Christ. For example, when speaking of his departure Buddh a, like the Christ, p romi ses to"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"send the Paraclete, even the spirit of truth, who shall bear witness of him and lead h is followers to the truth. The Gnostic Horus s ays the same things in the same c haracter, and these sayings, b y whomsoever uttered, carry the mythical character with them. The sayings of Krishna a s well as those of the Buddh a a re frequently identical with those of the Christ. I am t he letter A, cries the one. I am the Alpha a nd Omega (or the A.O.), exclaim s the other. I am t he beginning, the mi ddle, and the e nd, says Krishna -- \"I am the Light, I am the Life, I am the Sacrifice.\" Speaking of his disciples, h e a ffirms that they dwell i n h im and h e dwells in them. The a ttit ude of the Sayer as the personal revealer, the veritable a nd v isible im age of the hidden God in the Gospels, is that of the mythical Horus, the representative of Osiris -- of Iu as manifestor of Atum, and o f Khun su as the son o f Amen - Ra, who was the hidd en God b y name. The status had b een attained, and the stand was occupied b y the mythical divinity, and no room was left for a human Claim ant m any centuries later. If we take the transfiguration on the Moun t, Buddh a a scended the moun tain in Ceylon called Pa ndava or Yellow - White. There the heaven op ened, and a great li ght was in full flood around him , and the glory of his person shon e forth with \"doub le power.\" He \"shon e as the brightness of Sun and Moon. \" This was the transfiguration o f Buddh a, identical wit h that of the Christ, and bo th are the same a s that of Osiris in h is ascent of the Moun t of the Moon. The same scene of the temptation on the Moun t was previously pou rtrayed in the Persian acc oun t of the Devil t empting Zarathustra, and inviting him t o curs e the Good Belief. But these several forms of the one c haracter do no t m eet, and d id no t originate in any human h istory -- lived either in Egypt, India, Persia, o r Judea. They only meet in the Mythos, which may be trace d to a c omm on o rigin in Egypt, where we can d elve down to the real root of the matter. Astrono mi cal m ythology claim s, and Egypt can acc oun t for, at least 30,000 years of tim e; and that alone will explain these relationships and likenesses found on the surface by an o riginal i dentity at root. Th e myths of Christianity and Buddh ism had a c omm on o rigin, and b ranched from t he same root in the soil of Egypt, whence e manated several dogmas, like that of the Imm aculate virgin motherhood, and the divine c hild who is the a ncestral soul self - reprodu ced. A nd in company with the doctrines we naturally find a few of the sayings of the Buddh a, which h ave often b een p aralleled with some of those a ssigned to the Christ. The Logia or sayings are the mythoi in Greek. They were mythical sayings assigned to Sayers, who were a lso mythical in that m ythology which p rece ded and acc oun ts for our Theology and Christology. The sayings were the oral wisdom, and, as the name im plies, that wisdom was uttered b y word o f mouth alone. They existed b efore writing, and were not al lowed to b e written afterwards. The mode of comm unicating them i n the Mysteries, as in Masonry, was from m outh to ear; and, in p assing, it m ay be remarked that the war of the Papacy against Masonry is beca use it i s a survival of the pre - Christian Mysteries , and a living, ho wever im perfect, witness against Historic Christianity! Mythos or myth denotes anything delivered b y word o f mouth, myth and mouth b eing identical at root. Now, as the mouth o f utterance prece ded the word that was uttered, it follows that the first form of the sayer or Logos was female, and that the femi nine wisdom was first, althou gh she has not yet been made flesh. The mother was prim ordial, and the ea rliest"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"soul or spirit was attributed to h er; she was the mouth, u tterer, o r sayer, long before the sayings were a ssigned to the male Logos or Christ. Thus in the Apocrypha, as in o ther Gnostic book s, the sayings of Wisdom are found which h ave been made c oun terfeit i n the mouth o f the Christ m ade historic. She was the prim al type of Wisdom, w ho bu ilt her hou se with the Seven Pillars, and who was s et in the heavens as Kefa, later Sefekh, and latest Soph ia. She is called the Living Word o r Logos at Ombos, b eca use a s her constellation, the Great Bear, turned round annu ally, it t old the tim e of th e year. She is pou rtrayed in the planisphere with h er tongue hanging out t o show that she is the mouthpiece of tim e who u tters the Word. Wisdom was also the ea rliest teller of human tim e. In h er mystical phase she told the tim e for the sexes to come togeth er. Thus, on the ground o f natural phenomena, the Logia were first uttered b y the Lady, and no t by the Lord. This is the woman who h as been so b adly abused b y those who d esired to d ethrone her; the primiti ve protestants who set up the male im age in h er pla ce a nd on h er pedestal. In Egypt the Sayings were a ssigned to v arious divinities, that is mythical characters. One of these was the Solar God Iu - em - hept, the Egyptian Jesus, who was the son o f Atum, and who is called \"the Eternal Word\" in the \"Book of the Dead. \" After these sayings had been recorded it i s s aid o f them i n a text at least 5000 years old, \"I have heard the words of Iu - em - hept and Har - ta - tef as it i s s aid in their s ayings!\" The Osirian form of the \"the Lord\" who u tters the Logia in the Egyptian Ritual is Horus, h e whose name signifies the Lord. I canno t prove that sets of the sayings of the Lord, as Horus, were c ontinued intact up to the tim e of Papias. Nor is that nece ssary. For, acc ording to the nature of the hidden wisdom t hey remained o ral a nd were not intended to b e written do wn. They were not collected to b e pub lished as historic until t he mysteries had come to an end o r, on on e line of their descent, were merged in Christianity. But a few most significant ones may be found in the Book o f t he Dead. In on e particular passage the speaker says he has given food to the hun gry, d rink to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, and a boat t o the shipwrecked; and, as the Osirified h as don e these things, the Judges s ay to h im , \"Come, come in p eace,\" and h e is welcomed to the festival which is called \"Come thou to me.\" Those who h ave don e these things on earth are held to h ave don e them t o Horus, the Lord; and they are invited to come to h im as the blessed on es of his father Osiris. In this passage we have not only the sayings reprodu ced b y Matthew, bu t also the drama a nd the scenes of the Last Judgment represented in the Great Hall of Justice, where a person is separated from his s ins, and those who h ave sided with Sut against Horus are transformed into goa ts. Here it i s noticea ble that Matthew only of the four Evangelists represents this drama of the Egyptian Ritual! Among the sayings of Jesus, o r Logia of the Lord, is the saying that \"the ve ry hairs of your head a re numbered;\" and in the Ritual every hair is weighed; also the night of the judgment - day is designated that of \"weighing a ha ir.\" Various chapters of the Ritual are the \"sayings.\" They are prece ded b y the formula, \"said by the dece ased,\" or \"said to the dece ased.\" Horus, the Lord, is the divine Sa yer. \"Says Horus\" is a c omm on statement; and the souls repeat his s ayings. He is the Lord b y name, and therefore his are the original sayings, o r Logia of the Lord. These sayings, o r Logia of the Lord, were written b y Hermes or Taht, the Scribe of the Gods , and they constituted the original Hermean o r inspired Scriptures, which the Book o f the Dead d eclares were written in Hieroglyphics by the finger of Hermes him self. This Recorder of the sayings is"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"said to h ave power to grant the Makheru to the Solar God - - that is, the gift of speaking the Truth b y means of the Word, b eca use he is the Registrar of the \"sayings\" -- the scribe of the wisdom uttered o rally, the means, therefore, b y which the Word was made Truth to men; not flesh in hu man form. This is the part a ssigned to Matthew, the ca lled on e, the Evangelist and Scribe, who first wrote down the Logia, o r sayings of the Lord. Now, the special name or titl e of Hermes in the particular character of the Recorder and Registrar in the Hall of the Doub le Truth, o r Ju stice, is M atthew in Egyptian -- that is, Matiu. And my claim i s not only that the prim ary Logia of the Lord were the sayings of Horus, whose name means \"the lord,\" but also that the Matthew w ho, acc ording to the testim ony of Papias, first wrote down the Log ia of the Lord, was non e other than Matiu, o r Hermes, the recorder of the sayings in the Egyptian Ritual, who h as been made a n h istoric personage in the Canon ical Gospel i n exact acc ordance with the humanising of the Mythical Christ. One mode of manipulat ing the sayings, and making out a history is apparent, and can b e followed. This was by look ing it out in the a lleged Hebrew proph ecies, and inserting it piece meal between the group s of sayings. There is proof that, with the sayings as prim ary data, the hi story of the Canon ical Gospel, acc ording to Matthew, was written on the principle of fulfiling the suppo sed p roph ecies found in the Old Testament, o r elsewhere. The c ompiler was too un instructed to kno w that t he proph ecies themselves belonged entirely to t he Astrono mi cal Allegory, and n ever did o r could relate to forthcomi ng events that were to b e fulfiled in hu man h istory; and n ever were suppo sed to do so, except by the ignorant, who kn ew no b etter, and who, in fact, thou ght the zodiaca l Virgin had b rought forth h er child on earth; which could on ly be born, and that figuratively, in heaven. Those who d id kno w better, whether Jews, Samaritans, Essenes, o r Gnostics, entirely repud iated the historic interpretation, and d id no t become Christians. They could no more join the ignorant, fanatical Salvation Army in the first century than we ca n in the nineteenth. The so - called p roph ecies not only supp ly a raison d '√™tre for the history in the gospels, the e vents and circumstances themselves are manufactured on e a fter another from t he proph ecies and sayings -- that is, from t he mythos which was pre - extant, in the course of the literalisation into a human life, and the localisation in Judea, und er the pretext, o r in the blind b elief, that the im possible had come to p ass. Justin Martyr's great appeal for historical proofs is made to the Old Testament proph ecies; and so is Matthew's. According to h im , Jesus was born at Bethlehem i n o rder that it mi ght be fulfiled which was s aid b y Micah that a Governor and Shepherd for Israe l shou ld come out of Bethlehem i n Judea. That was in the Celestial Bethlehem or House of Bread - Corn, the zodiaca l sign o f the Fishes, where the mythical Messiah was to b e reborn abou t the year 255 B.C. Again, the youn g child was only taken to Nazareth that it mi ght be fulfiled which was spok en b y the proph ets, that he shou ld b e ca lled a Nazarene. And yet he would no more become a Nazarene in that way than a man could b ecome a horse by being born in a stable. Jesus came to d well i n Capernaum, on the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali, that a saying of Isaiah's mi ght be fulfiled!"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"He ca st out the spirits with a word, and h ealed all t hat were sick, that it mi ght be fulfiled which was s pok en b y Isaiah the proph et. For the same im potent reason h e c harged h is follower s not t o make him kno wn to men as the Christ! He taught t he multit ude in parables only that it mi ght be fulfiled which h ad b een spok en b y the proph et. Althou gh Jesus wrought his mi racles, and d id so many wond erful works, yet the people believed not on h im , beca use Isaiah h ad p reviously said: \"Lord! who ha th b elieve d ou r r eport? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord b een reve aled?\" For this cause (or on this acc oun t) they could no t believe! And where, then, was the sense in expecting them t o b elieve? Jesus on ly sent the two d isciples to steal the a ss and colt, that it mi ght be fulfiled which was s pok en b y the proph et Zechariah. The c hoo sing of Judas as one of the disciples, and his consequent treac hery, do bu t occur in the Gospels, b eca use it had b een written by the Psalmi st: \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which d id eat of my bread, hath lift ed up h is heel aga inst me!\" which refers to an identifiably Egyptian Mythos. In another Psalm assigned to David, the speaker cries: \"My God! my God! why ha st thou forsaken me! They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my ve sture.\" And in another he e xclaim s: \"They gave me also ga ll f or meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to d rink.\" And these sayings, which were pre - extant and p re - applie d, constitute the Christian record o f the historic c rucifixion! It canno t be pretended that t hey are proph ecies. The transactions and sayings in the Psalm s are personal to the speaker there and then, whether Mythical or Historical, and not to any future su fferer; and the tremendou s transactions pou rtrayed in the Gospels are ac tually based upon a repetiti on o f that which h ad already occurred! When Jesus is represented b y John as being in h is death - agony, h e only said, \"I thirst,\" in o rder that the Scripture mi ght be fulfiled -- and no t beca use he was thirsty! -- the Scripture being these Sayings previously attributed to the psalmi st David. The ea rlier sayings are repeated as the later doings, and the non - historical is finally the sole e vidence for the Historical. When the Roman soldiers had crucified Jesus they took the vesture that was withou t a seam, and said: \"Let us not rend it, bu t cast lots for it,\" that the Scripture mi ght be fulfiled which saith: \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my ve sture did they c ast lots.\" Such was the famili arity of the Roman soldiers with the Jewish Scriptures, and such their r espect for them, that they could do no thing that was not laid do wn in the Hebrew Writings to b e interpreted as proph ecy! And in such a desperate wa y the proph ecies had to b e fulfiled in o rder that the History mi ght be written. In the first place the sayings are not original, no t personal to any historical Jesus, and yet they are the ac kno wledged found ations of the four gospels. Therefore in them we h ave the found ations laid independently of any suppo sed Found er of Christianity. Next, we have more or less s een how a part of the history superim posed on the sayings first collected b y Matthew w as extracted p iece meal from t he parables, oracles, alleged p ro phecies, and un - alleged Mythos of the Old Testament; and thus we get upon the track o f the c ompilers, and can trace their method o f working from t he matter of the Mythos. Now, when we find, and can identify, the skeleton o f some particular person, we have got the found ation o f the man, no matter where the rest of him may be -- recoverable or not. So is it with the Christ of our Canon ical Gospels. The mythical Christ is the skeleton, and that is identifiably Egyptian. This mythical Christ, as Horus, was contin ued in the more mystical phase a s the Horus of the Gnostics. The Gnostic Rituals repeat the matter, n ames, symbols, and do ctrines found in some later chapters of the Egyptian Book o f the Dead. The Gnostics s upp ly the mi ssing links"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"between the oral sayings and the written Word; between the Egyptian and the Canon ical Gospels; between the Matthew w ho wrote down the sayings of the Lord in Hebrew or Aramaic, and the Matiu who is s aid to h ave written the Ritual in h ieroglyphics with the very finger of Hermes him s elf. The Gnostics were the kno wers by name; their artists perpetuated the Egyptian types; and the original m yths, symbols, and do ctrines now recovered from t he buried land o f Egypt vou ch for their kno wledge of the mysteries which lurk in the sayings, p arab les, events, and characters that have been gathered up in our Gospels, to b e naturalised and re - issued in an h istoric narrative a s the fulfilm ent of proph ecy. They inherited the Gnosis of Egypt, which remained un written, and therefore was unkno wn to the Ch ristians in general; t he mysteries that were performed in secret, and the science kept concea led. The Gnostics complained, and truly maintained, that their mysteries had b een made mund ane in the Christian Gospels; that celestial persons and celestial scene s, which could on ly belong to the pleroma -- could on ly be e xplained b y the secret wisdom or gnosis -- had b een transferred to earth and translated into a human history; t hat t heir Christ, who could no t be made flesh, h ad b een conv erted into an historical char acter; that their Anthropo s was turned into the Son o f Man -- acc ording to Matthew -- Mono genes into the Only - begotten, acc ording to John, their Hemorrhoidal Soph ia into the woman who suffered from t he issue of blood, the mother of the seven inferior powers in to Mary Magdalene possessed b y her seven d evils, and the twelve √Üons into the twelve Apostles. Thus, the Gnostics enable us to doub le the proof which can b e derived d irectly and independently from Egypt. They claim t hat the mi racle of the man who was born blind, and whose sight was restored b y Jesus, was their mystery of the √Üon, who was produ ced b y the Only - begotten as the sightless creature of a soulless Creator. Iren√¶us, in reporting this, makes great fun o f the Word that was born b lind! He did no t kno w that this Gnostic mystery was a survival of the Egyptian myth o f the two Horuses, on e of whom was the blind Horus, who exclaim s in h is blindn ess -- \"I come to search for mine eye s,\" and h as his s ight restored at the c omi ng of the Second Horus -- the light of t he world. Nor did h e dream t hat the two - fold Horus would explain why the blind man in ou r Gospels s hou ld b e single in on e version and two - fold in another acc oun t of the same mi racle. The Gnostic Horus came to seek and to save the poo r lost m other, Soph ia, who h ad wandered ou t of the pleroma, and the Gnostics identified this myth with the statement assigned to Jesus when h e said h e had on ly come a fter that lost sheep which was gone a stray. For, as Iren√¶us s ays, they explain the wandering sheep to mean their mother. This s hows how the c haracter of the Christ was limit ed to the mould o f the Mythos and the likeness of Horus. But the lost sheep o f the House of Israel has not yet found Jesus. The very same transactions and teac hings ascribed to Jesus in the Gosp els are a ssigned to the Gnostic Christ, who, like the Egyptian Horus, is the Sayer in h eaven, o r within the pleroma, and no t upon ou r earth. And, in the Gospel acc ording to John, we have Jesus identifying him self as the Son o f Man which is in h eaven, whils t at the same tim e he is represented as talking and teac hing the Gnosis of the mysteries on earth. He tells Nicodemus, who came to h im by night, that \"No man ha th a scended into h eaven bu t he that descended ou t of heaven, eve n the Son o f Man which is in h ea ven,\" as was Anthropo s when h e taught the twelve acc ording to the Gnostic acc oun t of the transactions within the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"pleroma. Also, the twelve √Üons are a ddressed in the language of the Gnosis when Jesus says to the twelve -- \"Ye also shall bear witness, b ecause ye have been with me from the beginning. \" They tell us, says Iren√¶us, that the kno wledge c omm unicated b y the Christ to the √Üons within the pleroma has not been op enly divulged, b eca use a ll are not capable of rece iving it; but it was mystically made kno wn, by means of parables, to those who were qualified for r ece iving it. The Gnostic Christ reveals the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven to the twelve √Üons in p arables. And in the Gospel the Christ speaks to the twelve in p arables only, and to them alone is i t given to kno w the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. In this process of conv erting the mythical into the historical we a re told that Jesus, the very Son o f God, was s ent into the world to teac h and enlighten and save mankind, and yet he spok e his teac hi ng in p arables which the people c ould no t, and were not intended to, und erstand. \"All t hese things s pake Je sus in pa rables to the multit ude; and withou t a pa rable spake he nothing un to them,\" in o rder that it mi ght be fulfiled which was s pok en b y the proph et, saying, \"I will open my mouth in pa rables; I will utter things hidden from the founda tion o f the world!\" He spok e to the multit udes in this wise, so that they mi ght not und erstand. Yet in the c hapter following it i s s aid -- \"He c alled to him the multit ud e (not the disciples) and said un to them, Hear and und erstand, \" and imm ediately uttered a dark saying. We a re a lso told that the c omm on p eople heard h im gladly! In another instance, as crucial as it i s interesting -- illustrative of the way in which the myth ical, the Kronian Christ, was made human as the instructor of man -- it i s s aid as Jesus s at on the Moun t of Olives the disciples came to h im privately, and asked h im t o tell t hem abou t his comi ng in the c loud s at the e nd o f the world. And amongst other thin gs they are to do, h e says, -- Let them t hat are in Judea flee unto the moun tains. Let him t hat is on the hou se - tops not go do wn. But what sense is there in advising any such mode of escape from t he great tribulation and catastroph e which invo lved the e nd o f the world? There would no t be much advantage on the hou se - top o r even the hill - top if the stars were falling from heaven, with the firmament raining all round with flames, and the end o f all t hings had indeed come. We mi ght just as well seek refuge a t the top o f a fire - escape. And they are to p ray that their flight m ay not be in winter, o r on the Sabbath, as if it could po ssibly matter to any mortal in what season o f the year, o r day of the week, such a ca tastroph e shou ld o ccur. The final explanation o f al l such foolishness is that the matter is mythical, and, o f course, it refuses to b e realised in any such literal way. The parable never meant the e nd o f this world; the literalisers of the mythos thou ght it did. That was only a false inference of ignorant belief. But such are the found ations of the faith. Such desperate dilemm as as these a re the inevitable result of representing the Mythical Sayer in h eaven as an h istorical teac her on earth. The two chief abiding place s to which the peripatetic Christ retir es are ca lled \"the Moun tain\" and \"the Desert.\" These localiti es in the Egyptian mythos are the upp er and lower heavens, o therwise the moun t of the e quinox and the wilderness of the und erworld; and where John cries in the wilderness, Aan o r Anup ho wled in t he desert. Now, acc ording to Egyptian thou ght and mode of expression the dead are those who are on the moun tain; the living are those who are in the valley or on the ea rth. Horus on earth, o r in the valley, is mortal, the c hild o f the imm aculate mother Isi s alone. Horus on the moun tain is s piritualised as the son o f the Father Osiris, in whose power he overcomes the devil. Sut or Satan h as the best of it down in the wilderness, and Horus conqu ers up"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"on the moun t, in the day of their Great Battle. Jesus und e rgoes the same c hange a s Horus does in h is baptism. He likewise becomes the son o f the Father, and in the strength o f his adultship h e a scends the moun tain and b ecomes the vanqu isher of Satan. This typical moun tain is a pivot on which a good d eal m ay be sa id to turn. The c ontest between Jesus and Satan, called the temptation on the Moun t, is pou rtrayed upon the monu ments in a scene where Horus and Sut contend for supremacy, and at last agree to d ivide the whole world b etween them. Horus takes the south, and Sut the north, called the hinder part, where Jesus s ays, -- \"Get thee behind me, Sa tan!\" The devil's long tail i s an extant sign o f this hinder part, which was typified in Egypt by the tail. If the Christ had b een h istorical in this transaction, the devil m ust be historical too. Both stand on the same footing of fact or fable. According to the record, Satan must have been as real as the Christ, o r Christ as mythical as the devil. Was Satan also incarnated for life in the flesh? If so, when d id h e die? where was the place of his burial? and d id he also rise a gain? Nobod y seems to care what beca me of the poo r devil after he was told to get behind, o r take a back seat, that of the hinder part. The scene in the Moun t of Transfiguration is obv iously derived from t he ascent of Osiris (or Horus), and h is transfiguration in the Moun t of the Moon. The sixth day was celebrated as that of the c hange a nd transfiguration o f the solar god in the lunar orb, which h e re - entered as the regenerator of its light. With this we ma y compare the statement m ade by Matthew that \"After s ix days Jesus\" went \"up into a h igh moun tain apa rt, and h e was transfigured.\" \" And h is face did shine as the sun\" (of course!), \"and h is garments became white as the light.\" The natural phenomena on whic h these Egyptian legends or myths were found ed are the contentions of light and d arkness at the tim e of the e quinox, o r in the waxing and waning of the light in the lunar orb. \"He must increase, bu t I must decrease,\" says John, who plays the part of Sut - Aa n to Jesus as the Light of the World. This was the battle between Horus and Satan. In on e legend it i s s aid that Sut was s even d ays fleeing on the back o f an ass from his battle with Horus. That m eans the seven d ays of the second qu arter of the moon, du rin g which Horus triumphs as Lord o f the growing light. And h ere we ca n po int to a c urious s urvival! The Unicorn was a type of Sut, and the Lion o f Horus; and their conflict is described in ou r legend -- \"The Lion and the Unicorn Were fighting for a farthing, The Lion beat the Unicorn Up and do wn the garden! The Lion and the Unicorn Were fighting for a c rown, The Lion beat the Unicorn Up and do wn the town!\" "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The farthing is a fourth; and they fought for a fourthing, o r a quarter of the moon ; equal to the seven d ays during which d arkness was put to flight; and the c rown is the full, round disk o f the moon. Thus, as the Egyptian im agery proves, the a rms of England illustrate the same subject - matter as the c ontest of Horus and Sut, o f Angro - Mainyus and Zarath ustra, and o f the Christ and Satan. And no w, if you will have the patience, I will show a scene in which the Christ of the Gospels is restored to h is proper place a nd station in the heavens, as the Teac her on the Moun t, and as s uch can b e identified. Jesus goes up into the mythical m oun tain when h e a ppo ints the twelve disciples, that they mi ght be with him , and h ave a uthority to cast out devils (Mark iii. 14 ). In Matthew's compilation Jesus calls the twelve, and gives them authority to cast out devils. It i s here that he says \"the harvest is plenteous, bu t the labou rers are few.\" Luke describes the same scene in the same words, and the same c ommi ssion is granted, the same powers are given to the disciples! But now the seventy have taken the place of the twel ve. \"And the Seve nty returned with joy, saying, Lord, eve n the devils are subject unto us in thy name!\" The \"Seve nty in the Moun t\" are a n ancient pre - Christian institution. They were once the \"Seve nty Elders\" who rece ived their instructions from Moses in t he Moun t. But in many ancient authorities these Seventy with Christ are Seventy - two. The two d ifferent numbers are identifiably astrono mi cal, and they go to doub le my proof. Previous to the heaven o f twelve divisions, and seventy - two sub - divisions, o r duo - deca ns of the zodiac, there was a heaven o f ten d ivisions and seventy sub - divisions; and we find the same mi xture of the seventy with the seventy - two, and o f the ten with the twelve, in the Astrono mi cal Book o f Enoch. Here, in the Canon ical Version, we hav e the twelve, and the c omplementary seventy - two, bu t no ten to acc oun t for the seventy! This mi ssing factor we shall find in the Divine Pymander, o r fr agments of Hermes. There we meet with the ten in the moun t, and the ten are the e xpellers of devils or to rments, just as the twelve a nd the seventy are in the gospels. All t hese parts belong to on e system of mythological representation, and wherever they are separately found can b e identified, as certainly as the scattered p iece s of a puzzle by those who kno w the subject - matter of the total picture. As before said, the scene on the moun t of transfiguration reprodu ces the ascent of Buddh a into Moun t Pandava or Yellow - White, and o f Osiris into the Moon ! Now, this M oun t of the Moon was a seat of the e ight great g ods of Egypt. And in the Divine Pymander it i s called the Octonary of Tat, who is Lord in Smen, the region o f the eight, at the north celestial pole. Lower down it was the moun t of the four quarters, o r of the Moon, and o f the four with Horus in the Moun t; and, still l ower down, it becomes the heaven o f the twelve signs, the zodiaca l circle; and h ere the fragments of Hermes, o r the Divine Pymander, h ave brought on matter of very special im portance. One of the chapters is entitl ed \"The Secret Sermon on the M oun t of Regeneration. \" Regeneration is the mystical form of the transfiguration o f Osiris in the Moun t of the Moon. This M oun t, also called the Tabernacle, is s aid to consist of the Zodiaca l circle, the signs of which are the twelve belonging to the Moun t - - the Zodiac being the lowest of three heavens, o r stories to the Moun t, Stellar, Lunar, and Solar. Now, let us s ee how the Moun t, together with the Sayer and the Sermon on the Moun t, h ave been reprodu ced in the Gospels. In the acc oun t furnished b y Matthew we find bu t four companions with Christ in the Moun t. These a re the two p airs of the brethren, who answer to the four brothers of Osiris, who are the gods of the four quarters. But in Luke's Gospel the Moun t of the four has become"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"the Moun t of the twelve. Accordingly the sermon is here delivered lower down, at the bottom of the Moun t! In fact, Jesus, instead o f being seated with the four on the Moun t, is said to stand with the twelve in the plain b elow! This s hows the Moun t to b e a strono mi cal as well as myt hical. Further, in the same scene, where the disciples are twelve in nu mber, as lords of the harvest -- acc ording to Matthew's Gospel -- they are seventy or seventy - two acc ording to Luke, the number of duo - deca ns into which the twelve signs of the Zodiac were finally sub - divided. In the Divine Pymander the titl e of the \"Moun t of Regeneration\" serves to show the nature of the sermon. It is the \"Secret Sermon. \" \" Oh, son, \" says Hermes, \"this wisdom is to b e und erstood in silence;\" that is, the kno wledge or experie nce of the Regeneration taught by the Secret Sermon on the Moun t. Hermes had said that No man can b e saved b efore regeneration; and Tat desires to und erstand the nature of this regeneration. He says to Hermes, \"I do hu mbly e ntreat thee, a t the going up to the moun tain!\" -- just as the Twelve besought Jesus privately in the Moun t. And Hermes shows him how the mortal m an while in the flesh can transform i nto the imm ortal mi nd. In the mysteries this was figured as the rising from t he dead, and it was s o taught b y the Gnostics. The process was illustrated b y transformation, o r entering into the state of trance, whereby (as was held) the mortal was changed into the imm ortal in this life; and it is evident that in the scene of the transfiguration d escribed b y Matthe w, the vision o f the three witnesses belongs to the trance c ond ition, for they had a vision which they were to tell t o no man! In the Canon ical Gospels the mythical Moun t has been made mund ane; the divine speakers have been made human; the mystical teac hin g has been literalised b y the e ndeavou r to make the total t ransaction h istorical. After the \"Secret Sermon (or spiritual representation) in the Moun t of Regeneration, and the profession o f silence,\" Hermes tells Tat to k eep silence -- these things are neithe r to b e taught nor told: they are to be hid in silence! In the gospels Jesus charges the disciples that they shall t ell no man what things they have witnessed, save when the Son o f Man shall have risen again from the dead. And the disciples, who are said t o h ave just seen a resurrection from t he dead performed b efore them, are described as questioning among themselves what the rising again from t he dead shou ld mean! (Mark ix. 9. ) In the Osirian myth the rising from t he dead was the re - birth o f the Lord o f l ight in the orb o f the New Moon. That was the transfiguration o f Osiris in the Moun t of the Moon, on the sixth d ay of the month. In the mystical phase the rising from t he dead in the Moun t of Regeneration, as pou rtrayed b y Hermes, was a transformation into the spiritual or abno rmal state, which d emonstrated imm ortality. Thus we have the rising from t he dead in two ph ases -- astrono mi cal and spiritual; both Egyptian, bo th able to explain their own meaning, and bo th p re - Christian! In the gospels we have the sam e Moun t, the same Mythos, the same matter, the same Numbers, the same c haracters, rendered h istorically. You can't help seeing the bon es of the Mythos s taring through its s kin! You are positively present at the transformation o f the mythical i nto the histo rical. The soli - lunar god and the Gnostic Christ have both contributed obv iously to the make - up o f the humanised Christ on the \"Moun t of Regeneration and the profession o f silence!\" No wond er the disciples could no t und erstand what the rising from t he dead shou ld mean! In this manner the Mythos can b e followed, as it goes on eating its way through the history, like the larv√¶ of the Anob ium pertinax, of which it i s recorded b y Peiquo t that one specim en p erforated twenty - seven folio vo lumes in a line so strai ght that a c ord could b e passed through the hole, and the twenty - seven vo lumes s lung up altogether."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" It is claim ed b y Christian teac hers that the Christ was incarnated as the e special revealer of the father who is in h eaven, and that the revelation culmi n ated on the Moun t when h e taught t he fatherhood o f God in the Lord's prayer. But t he Lord's prayer is no more original than is the Lord to whom it was last assigned. In the Jewish \"Kadish\" we have the following pre - Christian form of it, which is alm ost wor d for word the same: -- \"Our father which a rt in h eaven! Be gracious to u s, O Lord ou r God! Hallowed b e thy name! And let the remembrance of thee be glorified in h eaven abo ve and upon earth b elow! Let thy k ingdo m reign o ver us now and for eve r! Thy holy men of old said, 'Remit and forgive unto a ll men whatsoeve r they have don e aga inst me!' And lead u s not into temptation! But deliver us from the ev il t hing! For thine is the k ingdo m, and thou shalt reign in g lory for eve r and for eve r.\" If such a revelation h a d ever been h istorical, if the divine son h ad on ce been incarnated to reveal the fatherhood, it could no t have remained un til t he Christian era for this to b e don e. It did no t need any Deity to d escend from heaven to reveal that which h ad b een comm on do ctr ine in Egypt at least 4,000 years earlier. And this prayer was prayed b y the one particular people who rejected the Son o f God when h e had come down. But the matter is mythical and mystical, -- it can on ly be und erstood do ctrinally by means of the Gnosis. Th e initial point of the teac hing is this, -- there c ould b e no fatherhood in h eaven until t he human fatherhood was individualized on earth. Previously there was only the divine mother and the fathers in general. Hence the first Messiah was called the Son o f t he Woman, as he is in the book o f Enoch; the later is the Son o f Man -- the Gnostic Anthropo s, and the only - begotten o f the Father, the Gnostic Mono genes. This is he who was the last of the √Üons, and who came a t the e nd o f the world. He instructed the √Üons w ho h ad p rece ded h im , and \"taugh t them that those who had a comprehension o f the unb egotten were sufficient f or themselves, o r needed no h igher knowledge than that proclaimed b y him.\" He first announ ced among them what related to the kno wledge of the father , bu t that was within the Pleroma, no t on the ea rth. This was the great and abstruse mystery of the Gnostics, says Iren√¶us, that the Proarche, the Power which is abov e a ll others and contains all, is termed Anthropo s; hence the manifester is s tyled the \"So n o f Man. \" This titl e of the Christ occurs nearly eighty tim es over in the Gospel acc ording to Matthew, where he is identical with the Gnostic Anthropo s -- Son o f Anthropo s. That is, the Son o f the God who was now im aged in the likeness of the individualized Father, which was the latest institution in h eaven, b eca use it had b een last on earth. Here, it m ay be observed in p assing, is a fact that is forever fatal to the theory that t he Christology of the Gospels was derived from Buddh ism. There is no d ivine fat herhood p roclaim ed b y the Son in Buddh ism. But the teac hing was Egyptian. The most im portant sayings assigned to Jesus by the writer of John 's Gospel are not recorded o r r eferred to b y the Synop tics -- Matthew, Mark, and Luke. These c ontain the secret wisdo m of the Gnostics; they are the Logia of the Gnostic Christ, who was Horus, the Lord, in Egypt. They are spok en b y the Son o f Man, who is in h eaven (John iii. 13 ), and who taught t he twelve √Üons there with the same doctrinal sayings that are here assigned to the Teac her of the twelve on earth, o r on the Moun t. Moreover, in John 's"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"gospel we meet with the Seven Fishers on bo ard the boat. These c orrespond to the seven who are followers of Horus in the Egyptian Ritual, and who are said to fish for Horus. They g o a - fishing with Horus in h is boat; and they are a lso called the \"Seve n p lanks in the boa t of souls.\" The mi raculous draught of fishes occurs in bo th. Now, it i s noticea ble that this mi raculous take of f ishes is described b y Luke a s occurring during the li fe - tim e of Jesus, bu t acc ording to the Johanine gospel, the transaction takes place in a region b eyond the tomb, o r at least, after the death and resurrection o f Jesus, -- and therefore in the very region where the Gnostics declared these things had o ccurred . Which, think ye, was first, - - the a ssuredly mythical, or the a lleged h istorical? The gospel acc ording to John is the link o f conn ection b etween the true Gnosis and the false history of the other gospels. It shows the very ground on which the mythos aligh ted to b e made mund ane, and that is why it was kept secret, and withheld un til t he mi ddle of the second century or so, b y which tim e the doctrine of the Christ m ade flesh was considered safe, and sure to supersede the teac hings of the Gnostics with the gos pel of historic Christianity. An identifiable personal found er and h istorical teac her of Christianity is the least of all the various factors! The Church o f Rome did no t derive its s ecret dogmas and do ctrines from t he ca non ical gospels in which h is teac hi ngs are believed to b e e nshrined. Various Egyptian do ctrines, no t to b e found in ou r canon ical gospels, survived in the Church o f Rome; t hese were taught esoterically acc ording to an un written tradition, and on ly allowed to b ecome e xoteric a s tim e a nd oppo rtunity permitt ed. Take for example the worship o f the \"Sacred Heart.\" That is no rece nt invention o f Rome or the Ritualists. The doctrine is Egyptian, and o f the remotest antiquity. The heart, on acc oun t of its relation to the blood, was held to b e the ho use of life, and also the mother of life. The heart was the shrine of the soul. Its Egyptian n ame of Hat, and Hor, the soul, o r divine c hild, compose the name of Hathor, the mother of Horus, the Christ. And as the heart or habitation is the mother of life, it was adop ted as a type of the birth - place . And so in the Ritual the soul, speaking as Horus, says, \"My heart is (or was) my mother,\" in a c hapter ( 30) which contains the doctrine of the \"Sacred Heart.\" For this reason the heart - shaped fruit of the Perse a tree of life was an emblem of Hathor and h er child. The stone of it was s hown through a c left in the fruit t o d enote the seed o f the woman. Now, as previously said, on e name of Hathor is M eri. Horus was the Child - Christ of the Sacred Heart of Meri, who was the godd ess of love in Egypt, as well as the a bod e or dwelling of life, b efore she beca me the Madonn a Mary in Rome. This is not only the source of the Sacred Heart as a Christian do ctrine, it i s also the origin o f Cupid, the c hild - god o f love, and the typical heart still sacred to lovers on Valentine's day. Possibly the nearest we ca n get t o Jesus ben Pandira a s a teac her, if he makes any appearance whatever in the Gospels, is in the gloomy ascetic, the a nti - naturalist, who mi stook the non - natural for t he divine; who would h ave had men to save their protoplasmal souls by becomi ng eunu chs for the Kingdom of heaven's s ake! and whose model for heaven itself was a monastery, as when h e says, \"In my father's hou se are many mona i,\" or monasterion, -- with no wom en there to cause a second fall from heaven!"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"He mi ght possibly have been the self - tormenting teac her of a c reed o f monk ery, on ly that institution was already established, and no p lace was left for him t o b e the found er even there.

If so, these would b e manipulated b y his followers, on e of whom, James, is s aid, in the book Abadazurah, to have been a follower of Jehoshua the Nazarene, and so b y degrees the historic Joshua would b e c onfused with, and finally conv erted into, Jesus the Christ of Nazareth, and the mystical Sayer into the Word made flesh: t he Jesus of that \"other Gospel\" which w as oppo sed b y Paul.

One very striking note of the want of human p ersonality and h istoric verity in the Christ of the ca non ical Gospels is the a bsence of all recognition o f Rome. There is no shadow of Rome to b e seen on the face of the Chri st; no word o f rebuk e for her inhu man and non - natural crim es; no sign o f anything contemporary: except the c oun selling of submi ssion to C√¶ sar.

Yet the e xistence of slavery was endo rsed b y the Roman law, was practised with all it s evils, and en forced b y all her legions.

GNO STIC AND H ISTORIC C HRISTIAN ITY ___________________ My purpose in the present lectures is to enforc e with further evidence, and sustain with ampler detail, the interpretation o f facts, which h as been already outlined in the \"Natural Genesis.\" My contention is, that t he original m ythos and gno sis of Christianity were prim arily derived from Egypt on v ario us lines of descent, Hebrew, Persian, and Greek, Alexandrian, Essenian, and Nazarene, and that t hese c onv erged in Rome, where the History was manufactured mainly from t he identifiable matter of the Mythos recorded in the a ncient Book s of Wisdom, illustrate d b y Gnostic Art, and o rally preserved amongst the secrets of the Mysteries.

They have some things in comm on, b eca use there is a Beyond to bo th. The c rucial t est, however, is to b e found on the threshold, at the first step we take, in the doctrine of the divine Fatherhood. The supreme r√¥le assigned to the Christ of the Gospels, as of the Gnostics, is that of Manifestor and Revealer of the Father in h eaven. His s ign - manual is the seal of the Father. A dozen tim es, acc ording to Matthew, h e ca lls God, \"My Father.\" In John 's Gospel, h e says, \"I and my Fath er are one.\" \" I am come in my Father's name.\" \"My Father hath sent m e.\" \" My Father hath taught m e.\" \" I am i n my Father.\" \" The word ye hear is my Father's.\" Buddh a makes no revelation o f the mythology. The Buddh a is the veiled God unv eiled, the un - manifeste d made manifest, Buddh a, like Putha (or Khepr - Ptah), was begotten b y his own b ecomi ng, b efore the tim e of the divine paternity. There being no real Father - God in Buddh ism, the Buddh a has non e to make kno wn on earth. The doctrine was Egyptian, as when it i s proclaim ed in the Texts that Horus is \"the son who p rocee ds from his father,\" and Osiris is the \"father who p rocee ds from his s on. \" Again, in the Hindu myth o f the a scent and transfiguration on the Moun t, the Six Glories of the Buddh a's head are represent ed as s hining out with a brilli ance that was blinding to mortal sight. These Six Glories are e quivalent to the six manifestations of the Moon - God in the six Upper Signs, o r, as it was s et forth, in the Lunar Moun t. During six months, the Horus, o r Buddh a, as Lord o f Light in the Moon, d id b attle with the Powers of Darkness by night, whilst the Sun itself was fighting his way through the Six Lower Signs. Now, in the Gospel acc ording to John, there is no contest with Satan, and no Transfiguration on the Moun t ! Instead, we have the \"Light of the world,\" which is in h eaven, warring with the Darkness, and manifesting His glory in six mi racles -- no more, no less -- answering the Six Glories of the Buddh a's head on the Moun t, o r the six manifestations in the lumi nou s hemi sphere of the superior signs. The \"beginning of his s igns,\" by which Jesus \"manifested h is glory,\" was the turning of water into wine. The sixth, and last, o f these, was the raising of Lazarus, which correspond s exactly with the rising of the Mumm y - con stellation (Sahu) of Orion, which ascended as the star of the Resurrection, when the solar god returned from t he dark h emi sphere of the und er - world, o r the sun re - entered the sign o f the Bull at the vernal equinox.

But the Egyptian Putha (the original of Buddh a a s I suggest) is indefinitely older than any kno wn Buddh a in India; therefore, as Pythagoras was learned in the wisdom of Egypt and was a teac her of it, I shou ld d erive his name from Putha (Ptah) and Kh uru (Eg.), the Voice or Word o f; as a teac her of the Cult of Putha or Ptah, the Opener and \"Lord o f Life.\" Also, when h e e ntered the first stage of the Essenic mysteries as a student of divinity, the Initiate was presented with an axe; that is the Egyptian hieroglyphic of divinity, called the Nuter; the sign with which the name of the priest, p roph et, o r Holy Father, was written. Philo informs us that the Jewish lawgiver ( Moses) had trained into fellowship a large number of those who bo re the name of Essene s. There were both Egyptian and Jewish comm unities of the healers prece ding those that were kno wn b y the Christian o r Gnostic names. Jerome ca lls the Essenes or Therapeuts \"The monk s of the old law,\" and Evagrius Ponticus s peaks of \"A monk o f great renown who b elonged to a sect of the Gnostics\" that dwelt near Alexandria, and were kno wn b y name a s the \"Christian Gnostics.\" Clement of Alexandria a lso claim ed to b e a Gnostic Christian. As M . Renan po ints out, the life of the so - called Christian h ermit s was fi rst comm enced in Egypt. Ages earlier there had b een Egyptian comm unities of r ecluses, bo th male a nd female, n ear the Serap√¶um of Memphis, which were suppo rted b y the State. In Philo's letter to Heph√¶stion, h e says the cells of the Egyptian h ealers are scat tered abou t the region on the farther shore of Lake Mareotis, in Egypt. Pliny speaks of the \"Ages on ages\" during which the Essenes had existed, and Epiphanius, abou t the year 400, says, -- \"The Essenes continue in their f irst position, and h ave not changed at all.\" Such p ermanency, o f course, d emands a long period o f indu ration. But it i s enou gh for the present argument to kno w they were e xtant for at least 150 years before the Christian era. Epiphanius also admit s that the Christians were a t first called Th erapeut√¶ and Jesseans, an equivalent name, as he e xplains, for the Essenes. They were a ll healers and do ctors. As the Ushai or Jesseans they were a lready extant as the healers by name, independently of any personal Jesus or Joshua the Healer. Also, in Gree k the verb for healing comes from t he same root as the name of Jesus. The Essenes were healers, no t beca use they were the workers of mythical mi racles like Jesus, but beca use they were profound students of Nature's s ecret powers; beca use they were masters of the science of mental m edicine, consciously able to d raw on the spirit - world for healing influences! They had d iscovered that health was infectious as well as disease, and that the ca pacity for r ece iving and giving, as a medium of the higher life, d epen ded on cond itions that could b e c ultivated in this life. Hence the stress they laid on p ersonal purity and its eight stages of attainment. They were healers by virtue of the Christ within. Again, we learn from pseudo - Dionysius, the Areopagite, that the nam e of healer, i.e. , the \"Essene\" or Therapeut, whom Eusebius calls the Curate, was employed in the ea rly Church to d enote the perfected Adept, who h ad attained the highest standing, just as it was with the ea rlier Essenes.

It prece ded, and was not a birth o f, Historic Christianity. Philo tells us that those who retired from t he turmoil of pub lic life to d well apart in solitary place s (these being the precursors of the monk s and nun s in the Roman Church) handed ov er their private property to o thers, and left their parents, b rothers and sisters, wife a nd child, and gave up all t o the mysteries of a dedicated life. This, which was a comm on reality with the Essenes, is s et forth as an Ideal when the Canon ical Teac her says -- \"If any man cometh un to me, and h ateth no t his own father and mother and wife and children and b rethren and sisters, yea, and h is own life a lso, h e ca nno t be my disciple.\" Here the ideal is perhaps a trifle overdon e. The E ssenes did no t express or inculcate a ny such spirit of hatred to all one's relations. They were no such rabid anti - naturalists as that! The peace ful Essenic spirit i s not present, bu t rather the spirit of Christian p ersecution that li ghted the fires of mar tyrdom. Of those Essenes who moved abou t in the world Josephu s tells us (he a lso was an Essene in early life who d id no t find Jesus), \"They have no on e ce rtain city, bu t m any of them dwell i n every city; and if any of them come from other place s, what they have lies open for the strangers, just as if it were their own -- for which reason they carry nothing at all with them on their travels; nor do they buy or sell anything one to another, bu t every one of those who h ave gives to h im t hat requires it.\""},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Ess enes were phenomenal Spiritualists, in the c urrent sense, who walked with op en sight, and could n ever become the blind followers of the shut - eyed faith o f the Historicisers, who b anned the \"malignant spirit of fr ee inqu iry.\" As Spiritualists they could no t , and d id no t, b elieve in the resurrection o f the bod y, consequently a c orporeal resurrection o f the Christ was a fund amental fallacy upon which no Essene or Gnostic could found at any tim e. So Anti - Christian were they in the Catholic sense, and so oppo sed to the Messiah o f pub escence, the Christ acc ording to the flesh, that t hey repud iated anointing with o il, and considered it t o b e a filthy defilement.

They were the oppon ents of all blood - sacrifice, anim al or human. The only sacrifice uph eld b y them was that of the self. Therefore they did no t acce pt the blood y sacrifice of the incarnate Son o f God when it was proclaim ed. The Essenes as Gnostics held that every man must be his own Christ. Their Christ came within -- the Christ that could no t become historical withou t.

They were fables and allegories from t he first -- the mysteries that were taught in p arables -- and all Gnostics rejected the historic e xplanation from beginning to end, b eca use they preserved the true interpretation of the suppo sed h istory. Philo tells us -- \"They regard the letter of eac h u tterance a s the symbol of that which was concea led from sight, bu t was revealed in the hidden meaning\" -- not by its being rationalised into h istory. Mythology is, in its way, as real as mathematics, bu t it s way is not that of the literalisers, who h ave made the symbolism false on the face of it t o the und erlying natural facts.

We a lso learn from t he Clementine Homili es (3, 19 ) that the \"Mystery of the Scriptures\" which was taught by (or ascr ibed to) Christ was identical with that which from the first had b een comm unicated to those who were the Worthy. We may learn from t he Gospel acc ording to Luke that the \"Worthy\" were those who h ad b een initiated into the Mysteries of the Gnosis, and who we re \"acc oun ted Worthy\" to attain that \"resurrection from t he dead\" in this life, which Paul was not altogether sure a bou t -- \"those who kn ew that they could d ie no more, b eing equal to the a ngels as s ons of God and sons of the Resurrection. \" Such were then ex tant as pre - Historic Christians (ch. xx . 35 - 6). These c omm unities of the primiti ve Christians had long been acc ustomed to send forth their bare - footed apostles into all t he kno wn world, to inculcate the c omm on b rotherhood of man, found ed on the c omm on fath erhood o f God, and to labou r for the famil y of the human race . That had b een the practice in the past which was afterwards made a matter of prece pt in the present, and a prospect for the future! For this ancient practice of the Essenes is reduced to the pr ece pt of the teac her made personal, who says, \"Go your way; carry neither purse, no r scrip, no r shoes;\" and gives instructions to do the very things the Essenes had always don e!

This was a prim ary comm andment of the Essenic c omm unities who h ad practised the principles they professed, and h ad lived for ages acc ording to the golden rule which is afterwards laid do wn as a divine c omm and, a direct revelation from God, in the Gospels. No matter who the plagiarist m ay be, the teac hing now held to b e divine was drawn from older hu man sources, and p alm ed o ff und er f alse pretensions. Josephu s declares in h is acc oun t of the Essenes, that \"Whatever they say is firmer than an o ath; but swearing is entirely avoided b y them. They consider it worse than p erjury.\" And such is the original r evelation in the Gospel. But I was s orry to find, in the Clementine Homili es, that the same speaker breaks the Essenic pledge, for it i s there written, -- \"And Christ said (with an o ath), Verily I say unto you, un less ye be born again o f the water of life, y e canno t enter in the kingdom of heaven.\" Thus we have a n Essene who swears as well as tipples and p lays the part of Bacc hus. Again, Jesus is presented as the original revealer of the mysteries and author of the Gnosis. He says to h is disciples, -- \"It is gi ven you to kno w the mysteries of heaven;\" but the Essenic Comm unities always had b een composed o f those who were in po ssession o f the Gnosis, and h ad already obtained and sacredly preserved the kno wledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, which the y had taught only in p arables. The divine morality inculcated in the Sayings ascribed to Jesus had b een completely forestalled b y the Essenes in their lives and works, their individual characters, comm on practices, and societary cond itions. His words are b ut a later echo o f their very human deeds. We a re told that Jesus taught m ankind to p ray, -- \"Thy kingdom come, thy will be don e on earth as it i s in h eaven.\" But this was exactly what the pre - historic Christians had been working out in life. They strove to found the kingdom t here a nd then, and realise the world to come in this. Everything nob le a nd ennob ling, un selfish and spiritual, in the ethics of Jesus, o r r ather in the sayings assigned to h im as a teac her of men, h ad b een anticipated b y the Egyptians, t he Essenes, and the primiti ve Christians of the Gnostic religion. Nothing new remained to b e inculcated b y the Gospel of the new teac her, who is merely made to repeat the old sayings with a pretentious air of supernatural authority; the result being that t he true sayings of old are, o f nece ssity, conv eyed to later tim es in a delusive manner. The c omm andments are not new. Life a nd imm ortality were not brought t o light by any personal Jesus, bu t by the Christ of the Gnosis. The most im portant proclamation ass igned to Jesus turned ou t to b e false. The kingdom of God was not at hand; the world was not nearing its end; the ca tastroph e foretold n ever occurred; the second comi ng was no more ac tual than the first; t he lost sheep o f Israel are not yet saved. And the suppo sed Divine Truth in v ery person remains exposed as the genuine false proph et to this day, o r rather as the mere mouthpiece of the most ignorant beliefs of that day. It m ay be said more justly of Historic Christianity, than o f anything else within the compass of my kno wledge, that what is true in it was not new, and that which was new in it i s not true!

Of course, the setting - up o f this vast falsehood made a ll t ruth a blasphemy. \"The Gnostics,\" says Iren√¶us, \"have no gospel which is not full of blasphemy.\" Their crim e was that t hey denied the Christ carnalised, and they were denoun ced as being Anti - Christian, b eca use they were Ante - Christian! We a re told in the Book o f Acts that t he name of the Christiani was first given at Antioch; but so late as the year 200 A.D. no canon ical New Testament was kno wn at Antioch, the a lleged b irth - place of the Christian n ame. There was no special reason why \"the disciples\" shou ld first have been n amed as Christians at Antioch, except that this was a great centre o f the Gnostic Christians, who were previously identified with the teac hings of the mage Sim on o f Samaria. Sim on h ad taught the people of Antioch for a \"long tim e\" before, and h ad b een acce pted b y them \"from t he least to the greatest\" (Acts). Sim on was th e great Anti - Christ in the e yes of the found ers of the belief in Historic Christianity, for whom t he Ante - Christ was always, and everywhere, the Anti - Christ; and it was nece ssary to acc oun t for there being Christians, o ther, and earlier, than the believers in a ca rnalized Christ. This was clumsily attempted in the \"Acts,\" by making Sim on b ecome a baptised conv ert t o the new superstiti on, and then b ack - sliding -- a comm on mode of acc oun ting for Gnostic heretics, bu t false on the face of it. Iren√¶us shall furni sh u s with a c rucial instance of the orthodo x lying on this s ubject. He tells us that the Gnostics, such as those who followed Valentinus and Marcion, in the second century, h ad no existence before these later teac hers (B. III. ch. 4, 3 ); whereas he had al ready stated in h is first book, that Sim on o f Samaria was the first and foremost of all t he found ers of Gnosticism, and the father of all it s heresies; and h e was a ce ntury earlier. Sim on h ad b rought in the Gnosis from Alexandria. He taught his doctrines, and wrought his wond ers long anterior to the a postles of the later creed. Epiphanius ackno wledges that all t he heretical forms of Christianity were derived from t he Pagan Mythology -- that is, they were survivals of the original pre - historic Gnostic religion . It is obv ious that the Roman Church remained Gnostic a t the beginning of the second century, and for some tim e a fterwards. Marcion, the great Gnostic, d id no t separate from it until abou t the year 136 A.D. Tatian d id no t break with it until l ong after t hat. In eac h case the ca use of quarrel was the same. They left the Church that was s etting up the fraud of Historic Christianity. They left it as Gnostic Christians, who were a nathematised as heretics, b eca use they rejected the Christ m ade flesh and the ne w found ations of religion in a spurious Jewish h istory. The Church in Jerusalem, at the head o f which was James, called the \"brother of the Lord,\" was one of the Essenic or Therapeutic c omm unities that were found ed b y the Gnostic Nazarenes. James was repu ted to h ave been a follower of Joshua, the Nazarene -- i.e. , Ben Pandira -- who was conv erted more or less into the later Jesus of Nazareth. The Jewish legends s how that he was of the Nazarene sect. But no Nazarene brotherhood could h ave been found ed on any su ppo sed Jesus of Nazareth. They also show that James"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"was a Nazarene of the a ncient ascetic type -- one of those who were set apart and consecrated from t he mother's womb -- one who n ever shaved o r cut his hair, who d rank neither wine nor strong drink, no r ate o f any anim al food ; he would no t anoint him self with o il, no r wear woollen garments. Bishop Lightfoot admit s that the members of the early Church at Jerusalem were Gnostics, like the other Essenes: only, for him , they were heretics. He ca nno t m ake out the h iatus, which was not then filled in with the Gospel history. Now, whether it be ca lled Christian o r pre - Christian, the Gospel of James is good, as far as it goes. It was undoub tedly the same Gospel of the Essenes that opened the poo r man's doo r to h eaven. It teac hes their doctrines in their own language, and withou t the Historic apparatus. It puts certain things which h ave been d isestablished on their original foothold. In the Lord's Prayer we a re taught to ask the Divine Father not to lead u s, h is childre n, into temptation. But James declares emphatically that \"no man shou ld say he is tempted of God, for God canno t be tempted with evil, and h e him self tempteth no man.\" The Epistle of James is of supreme im portance. Eusebius, the suspected forger and falsif ier, when h e made his fatal admi ssion, must have kno wn that t he Scriptures of the Essenes had b een u tili sed as ground - work for the Epistles and the later Canon ical history. He c laim s the Essenes themselves as Christians when h e tells us that Philo \"describ es with the c losest acc uracy the lives of our ascetics\" -- that i s, o f the Therapeut√¶. He c onfesses \"it i s highly probable that t he a ncient comm entaries, which Philo says they have, are the very gospels and writings of the apostles, and p robably some e xposit ions of the a ncient proph ets, such as are c ontained in the Epistle to the Hebrews and many other of Paul's epistles.\" He mi ght have said, including the Ebionite Epistle of James, on ly that was to b e denoun ced as s purious. But it is im possible to claim t he Essenic Scriptures as being identical with the Canon ical records, withou t, at t he same tim e, admitti ng their pre - historic e xistence, their non - historical nature, and their anti - historical testim ony. They could on ly be the same in the tim e of Eusebius by th e non - historical having been falsely conv erted into the historical. This was what had b een don e, and that alone will explain why the ea rliest scriptures, which ou ght to h ave c ontained the historical record, h ave not been p reserved, bu t were got rid o f alto gether when the Coun cil of Nice \"supp ressed all t he devices of the heretics.\" I have previously shown that the real root of the whole matter can b e delved do wn to and identified in the mythology and mysteries of Egypt. When we see the Child - Horus emerging from t he lily - lotus, o r holding the forefinger to h is mouth, as portrayed upon the Gnostic stones and in the Catacombs of Rome, absolutely the same a s on the Egyptian monu ments, we kno w that it i s the identical divinity, no matter how it came to represent the Christian Christ. But i dentification is more difficult when the mythical t ype has passed into the more mystical phase. That is, the portraits of deities are more recognisable than the hidden do ctrines and v eiled features of the Gnosis. Yet, the Egyptia n do ctrines were a s s urely continued b y the Gnostics and the Christians as the personal li kenesses of Egyptian d eities were reprodu ced b y Gnostic Art in Rome. And b y aid o f the Gnosis, we can recover much that has been d islim ned and made indefinite in the doctrinal stage, to"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"be left as an un fathomable mystery! For example, the Child - Horus, with finger to mouth, wherever found, indicates the divine Word o r Logos in a particular way. He was the c hild of the Virgin mother alone, and always remained the c hild. He, therefore, was not the True Voice , o r Voice of Truth , on ly the Imperfect Word, the Inarticulate Discourse, as Plutarch calls the first Horus. But, just as the voice of the boy changes and b ecomes manly at pub erty, so in h is s econd o r virile c haracter H orus, as representative of the Father, b ecomes a True Voice, and is the \"Word o f Truth\" personified! In this character he was designated Har - Makheru, i.e. , Horus, the \"Word o f Truth,\" from Ma, Truth; Kheru, the Word. In the Egyptian texts the Word o f Horus is Truth; the function confided to h im by the Father! He vanqu ishes his enemi es with the Word o f Truth. It is s aid o f the Osirified d ecea sed, He goes forth with the Word o f Truth. To make the Truth b y means of the Word is s ynon ymous with the giving of lif e here or hereafter. In a prayer to the Pharaoh it i s s aid, \"Grant us breath b y the gift which is in thee of the 'Word o f Truth.'\" Moreover, men conqu er their sins by means of this \"Word o f Truth\" within, the Makheru conferred on them by the Deity! This ti tle of Makheru, the Word o f Truth, was translated the Justifi ed by Dr. Birch, which M. Pierret says is \"unfortunate.\" But there is a Christian sense in which that is a c orrect rendering. With the Egyptians, the Christians ( o ... crhsto ... ), the faithful Departe d, were actually called by this titl e of Makheru o r the Justified. They were those who always had been saved b y the \"Word - of - Truth!\" in Egypt long Ages before the Christian Era! Now, let us return for a moment to the Epistle of James canon ised in the New T estament, and called b y Luther \"an Epistle of Straw,\" beca use it had no t a grain o f Historic Christianity in it. James was the head o f the Church in Jerusalem. He was titl ed a brother of the Lord -- no doub t in relation to the Nazarite Brotherhood ; the Lord being a typical character like Horus, Mana, o r Elias, who was ignorantly assumed b y the literalizers of legends to h ave been a Judean p easant named Jesus or Joshua. Hence the im position o f certain famil y details in the Canon ical Gospels, which will be trac ed h ereafter. James is believed to h ave died abou t A.D. 60. But in the whole seven chapters of this Epistle of James, excepting an op ening salutation, there is not one single sign o f Historic Christianity! It recognises no Jesus of Nazareth, and it announ c es no salvation through the a toning blood, the death, resurrection and ascension o f a personal Christ. Nothing whatever begins with o r is based on the history which was afterwards made canon ical, no r on the Christ that was localized at a later stage of dev elopment. Everything is absent that was and still i s essential to the physical faith. Instead, we find the e xact oppo site of all t hat was made historic in the Gospels. The doctrine of salvation is Gnostic, Essenic a nd Egyptian. Salvation, acc ording to Jame s, cometh o f the \"Word o f Truth.\" Speaking of the \"Father of Lights\" (Lord o f Lights being a titl e of Horus) he says: -- \"Of his own will begat he us with the 'Word o f Truth' that we shou ld b e a kind o f first fruits of his creatures.\" \" Wherefore rece ive ye w ith meekness the im planted Word which is able to save your souls.\" The transaction is direct between the divine father and the human soul. The Christ within is the only saviour! The total teac hing of the Epistle of James is based on this ancient Egyptian W ord o f Truth; the im planted Word which confers the Makheru on man, which n ever could b e represented b y an h istorical Christ. The \"Word o f"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Truth\" as rendered b y James is the best possible translation o f the Egyptian \"Ma - Kheru.\" Moreover, the c ontext shows t hat the Word o f Truth is the Egyptian Makheru b y the exhortation, \"Be ye doers of the Word,\" which renders good Egyptian do ctrine in p erfect acc ordance with exact Egyptian ph raseology. Just as Horus M akheru was the Word o f Truth; or that which was s aid was fulfilled indeed, so men are re - begotten in the divine likeness by the Word o f Truth; and as livers or doers of that Word they are to b e saved -- as it was taught in Egypt thou sands of years previously withou t the Word o f Truth b ecomi ng incarnate in Horus a s a human p erson. This Word o f Truth, the Christ of James and Paul, which alone was able to save, is identical with that m ade kno wn aforetim e, which n eeded no t to b e brought down from heaven for any personal incarnation; needed no t to b e brought up from t h e dead b y any physical resurrection; needed no t to b e sent from over the sea, b eca use, as was s aid b y the Mosaic mouthpiece of Egypt's Wisdom, \"that Word is in thy heart that thou mayest do it!\" And this is the position re - occupied; this is the teac hing re - echoed b y Paul, in whose mouth the Word o f Truth b ecomes doub ly anti - historic ( cf. Deut. xxx . 12 - 14, with Romans x. 6, 7 ). There is also a reference to the \"Word o f Truth\" in Paul's Epistle to Tim othy, which still further identifies the Makheru. The word Ma, for that which is true, o riginally means to hold ou t straight before one. And Paul exhorts Tim othy, as a workman, to ho ld a straight course acc ording to the Ma - kheru, o r \"Word o f Truth.\" This True Voice or Word o f Truth is, I take it, that li ving and a biding voice which is appealed to b y Papias as evidence for his Christ, who was the Lord o f the Logia; and, if so, h is testim ony thus far does not make for, bu t tends to invalidate, the history. Of course, h e is s uppo sed to mean the voice of contemporaries when h e decries what would b e the more ce rtain vo ice of written records; but that is not what he means. He prefers, in reality, the traditions of the oral wisdom, and may be c laim ed as another witness for the non - Historical Christ. Also, the epistle to Di ognetus, suppo sed to h ave been written b y Marcion, contains the same doctrine a s the e pistle of James. Speaking of the Gnostic Christians, h e says: -- \"They are put to d eath and they come to life a gain,\" and the reason o f this is that \"God the Invisible hath him self fr om Heaven p lanted the truth and the holy incomprehensible Word and established h im i n their hearts.\" This epistle of James is indefinitely older than the Canon ical history. James is believed to h ave died abou t the year 60 o f our era, and in this , one of the ea rliest utterances of the Church, instead o f the History, we find the divine Makheru o f the Egyptian mythos in a mystical and do ctrinal phase. Instead o f an o riginal gospel based on the life, character, and teac hings of his own hu man brother, James presents us with the translated Word - of - truth -- the Horus of Egypt, and the Christ of the Gnostics, who could no t become historical. This beginning, then, is doctrinal, and the doctrine, like the portrait, is Egyptian. The same mythos was visibly con tinued in the Gnostic phase. In the Gospels, which were being compiled at least one hund red years later, we find this s ame Word o f Truth, which was personated b y Horus - Makheru and b y Iu - em - hept in Egypt some 3,000 years earlier, is now represented in a per sonal character as Jesus the Christ."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"This Word o f Truth, which is doctrinal and non - historical, acc ording to James, is the Word o f Truth made flesh acc ording to John.

These two characters, as the Sayer and Doer, constitute the doub le found ation o f the Christ in the other Gospels. The Chr ist of Matthew is chiefly the Sayer.

In p resence of the Gnosis, h ere a s elsewhere, there is no p lace , no significance, in the a lleged facts of a human h istory, lived for us by a ca rnalised Christ. And yet such a history was made out, and we a re now able to ge t a glim pse of the forgers engaged in the process of making it out! Our Canon ical Gospels are a Palim psest, with on e writing so elaborated ov er another that the first is alm ost crossed ou t, and the rest are thoroughly confused. Yet, the whole of them have to b e seen through b efore the matter can b e really read. By holding this Palim psest up to the light, and look ing at it l ong and closely, we ca n trace the large outline, the water - mark, o f the Egyptian mythos, with its virgin - mother, who was Hathor - Meri -- th e Madonn a -- its child - Christ of 12 years, and the virile a dult of 30 years, who was Horus, the a nointed son o f that Father in h eaven whom he ca me to reveal. This is the earliest and most fund amental of the nuclei . Next we find a c ollection o f Sayings as the nucleus of the Gospel of Matthew. These sayings were a ttributed to the Lord, and that Lord is s uppo sed to h ave been a Judean p easant, as the original author! It is noticea ble, thou gh, that the titl e of the Lord is not once a pplied to Jesus by Matthew in t he ea rth - life, but after the resurrection h e is called the \"Lord.\" Now, it i s well kno wn to scholars that the Gospel acc ording to Luke is based upon, o r concocted, with suitable a lterations, from an earlier \"Gospel of the Lord.\" That i s, the latest gospel acc ording to the Gnostics, prece ded the ea rliest of those that were made ca non ical.

When on ce we kno w that the origins were mythical, that the Christ was mystical, and the teac hings in th e mysteries were typical, we shall be a ble to"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"utili se the gospel of Marcion as a c onn ecting link b etween the Egyptian Mythos, the epistle of the Word o f Truth, and the ca non ical history acc ording to Luke. \"The Lord\" had b een Horus by name in Egypt, and the Greek ku riou, o r kurios, agrees with the Egyptian kh eru, for the Word, Voice, o r Logos, as in Ma - kheru (earlier, Ma - khu ru). This was the Lord continued as the Gnostic manifestor, their Horus, or Christ. Marcion assigned h is gospel to the Christ, in the sa me way that the Egyptian Ritual is ascribed to Hermes. Later on, the sayings of the Lord were a lso called the writings, as we see by pseudo - Dionysius, who charges the Gnostics with h aving falsified the Writings of the Lord. Marcion claim ed that his was the on e true Gospel -- the one -- and h e pointed to the multiplicity of the Catholic Gospels, full as they were of discrepancies, in p roof that they could no t be genuine. In the fourth century even, there were a s many different gospels as texts. As transmitt ed to u s by the Christian copyists, who were nothing if not historicisers, Marcion's gospel opens with the statement, that \"In the fifteenth year of the reign o f Tiberius C√¶ sar, Pontius Pilate ruling in Judea, Jesus came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee,\" o r \"into Judea,\" as reported b y Iren√¶us. Tertullian says, -- \"According to the gospel of Marcion, in the fifteenth year of Tiberius, Christ Jesus deigned to emana te from heaven, a salutary spirit. \" But, h e a lso says, acc ording to this \"Great Anti - Christian,\" the Christ was a phantom, who appeared sudd enly at the synagogue of Capernaum i n the likeness of a full - grown man for the purpose of protesting against the law and the proph ets! It would b e difficult t o d ate the descent of a phantom Christ, and im possible to d ate the descent of the Gnostic Christ at all, except as Lord o f the √¶on in relation to an astrono mi cal period! But it i s certain that the Lord o r Christ of Marcion is entirely non - historical. He has no genealogy or Jewish line of descent; no earthly mo ther, no father, no mund ane birthplace or human b irth. The Gnostic nature of this Christ i s further and fully corrobo rated b y both Iren√¶us and Tertullian. Clearly then no thing can b e made of the statement on b ehalf of the Canon ical history. This s tatement in Marcion's gospel takes the place of the baptism and d escent of the holy spirit i n Luke's; and this s ame date is quo ted b y Luke for the tim e when the Word o f God came to John in the wilderness, which is followed b y the baptism of Jesus and the transforma tion into the Christ or Horus of 30 years, whose unp ronoun cea ble name c ontained 30 letters, acc ording to the Gnosis. Such a beginning is entirely unh istorical, and applicable solely to the mythical Christ, who b eca me the virile a dult, the anointed son o f t he father at 30 years of age. Of course Christian apologists like Iren√¶us and Tertullian maintained that Marcion h ad mutilated their version o f Luke; and they managed to get rid o f the \"Gospel of the Lord,\" and to supp ress the writings of Marcion in p roof to save us the troub le of judging for ourselves. But t hat was only another Christian lie, as we have now the means of kno wing. The Gnostics were not the falsifiers of the historic scriptures; it was not they who h ad anything to falsify!

Th e \"Gospel of the Lord\" was first, and the Lord was not historical. The Jesus of Marcion like the Jesus of Esdras, o f Paul, and o ther Gnostics, is no Jesus of Nazareth. This titl e has been added b y Luke. Marcion's Jesus being mythical and no t historical, h e has no Jewish father and mother; consequently we find the test question: -- \"Is not this Joseph's s on?\" does not appear in the \"Gospel of the Lord.\" It has been added by Luke. Again, the statement, \"there ca me to h im his mother and b rethren; and they could no t get at him for the c rowd\" (Luke viii. 9 ), is not to b e found in Marcion's gospel; it has been added b y Luke. And for what? but to manufacture a nd make out that human history which was at last believed in, bu t which h ad no p lace in any gospel acc ording to the Gnostics or true primiti ve Christians! It can b e proved ho w passage a fter passage has been added to the ea rlier gospel, in the c ourse of manufacturing the later history. For example, the mourning over Jerusalem (Luke xiii. 29 - 35) is taken v erbatim from t he 2nd Esdras (i. 28 - 33) withou t ackno wledgment, and the words previously uttered b y the \"Almi ghty Lord\" are here a ssigned to Jesus as the original speaker. The acc oun t of Pilate's s hedding the blood o f the Galileans and mi ngling it with their sacrif ices (Luke xiii. 1 ) has been added b y some one so ignorant of Hebrew history, that he has ascribed to Pilate a n act which was committ ed when Quirinus was governor, twenty - four years earlier than the a lleged appearance of Jesus. Again, the a nti - Nazarene, an ti - Gnostic passage a bou t t he pub licans being baptised with water, and the Son o f Man comi ng eating and d rinking as a glutton and a wine - bibber, has been added. In the scene on the Moun t of Transfiguration, which is purely mythical, and therefore comm on to Osiris, Buddh a, and Zarathustra, we a re witness to the forging of another historical nexus in the statement that \"Moses and Elijah appeared in glory and spake of his decea se which h e was abou t to acc omplish at Jerusalem\" (Luke ix. 31 ). This passage does no t appear in the \"Gospel of the Lord.\" Nor does the statement (Luke xviii. 31 - 34), \"And h e took un to h im t he Twelve, and said un to them, 'Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all t hings that are written b y the proph ets s hall be acc omplished b y the Son o f Man.

With the Gnostics kno wledge was the found ation o f their f aith; but the Historic Christians made faith the basis of kno wledge, and the first demand o f the new faith was for the c onv ert to b elieve that all t he mythical typology of the past had b een made literally true in the present. By faith the fable was crystallised into the dogma of historic fact. The Gnostic doctrines of the pre - Histo ric religion were formulated as being those of kno wledge, faith, and imm ortality. Knowledge was fund amental. On this their faith was found ed b y means of a first - hand acquaintanceship with those facts which gave them their faith for the present, and sustain ed it with something more than the hop e or promi se of continuity for the future. Knowledge, Faith, and Imm ortality! Historic Christianity was based upon faith withou t that kno wledge, and those who kn ew the least were ac tually considered and d esignated the better believers, just as it i s in the Salvation Army of to - day. Lord Bacon, in a most unworthy utterance, affirmed that \"the more irrational and incredible a ny divine mystery is the greater the honou r we do God in b elieving it, and so much the more nob le is the victory of f aith.\" Such, ho wever, was the teac hing of the Church whose divine mysteries were manufactured from mi sinterpreted mythology. Nor was it very difficult t o literalise the mystical representation when a man like Origen could maintain that t he planets were a nim ated bod ies and rational beings. All t he secrets of the great kno wledge of the interior and mystical li fe, which M. Renan calls the \"Most glorious creation o f Christendo m,\" were in po ssession o f the Gnostics of various lands long ages e arlier, whilst their modu s operand i of ascertaining the truth was now to b e rejected and d enoun ced as damnable by the c orporeal Christians, o r carnalisers of the Christ. They not only let go, they anathematised the kno wledge that was already won from natur e, and p rohibited the means of continuing it or of recovering it again. The Gnostics, as Iren√¶us s hows, po inted ou t the very serious error that was committ ed b y those who im agined that the Christ had arisen in a mund ane bod y, no t kno wing that \"flesh and b l ood do no t attain to the Kingdom of God!\" The Christ of the Gnostics was a mystical type c ontinued from m ythology to po rtray a spiritual reality of the interior life. Hence the Christ in this human ph ase c ould b e female as well as male; Soph ia a s well as J esus; the spirit of both sexes. It was im possible for such to b ecome historical, o r be made so, except by ignorantly mi staking a mythical Impersonation for a Hermaphrodite in Person! What, for example, is the ac tual base of the \"Great Renun ciation\" ascribe d to the Buddh a or the Christ in the doctrinal, mythical, o r spiritual phase? It is this: -- When the soul of man came to b e c onsidered as a divine principle of celestial origin, it was figured as being entirely oppo sed to the e vil nature of matter; therefor e, b irth o r manifestation in matter was a descent of the soul from t he heaven o f pristine c ond ition into a lower state of im purity and im permanence; of disease, d eca y, and d eath, where it was bound to b ear or struggle to get out of it again as s oon as poss ible."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"This s oul, p ersonified as the Divine Man in Buddh a or the Christ i s afterwards represented as being consciously able to renoun ce the pleasures of Paradise, and o f its own free will and choice c ome down to earth as the Saviour of the World, b y giving lessons in d ivinity and living a life so lowly that t his life shou ld b e c onqu ered b y rejecting it on b ehalf of the other thus revealed to men!

The Gnostic Christ was the real found er of Christianity! This was the Christ of the first Christians, and this was th eir model m an, the Ideal m eek and lowly one, which the writers of the Gospels have sought to realise in the form of historic personality. This lunar, solar, mystical, o r spiritual type c ould no t be made historical in the c reed o f those who kn ew, i.e. , the Gnostics. But it was humanized; it was turned into a one person, who beca me the one Christ in this world, and the one spirit of all others, for those who d id no t kno w. For the ea rliest appeal of the new faith was made to men who were so ignorant, acc ording to the record, that when they had just witnessed a rising from t he dead o f certain h istoric c haracters, they did no t comprehend what this rising again from t he dead shou ld mean! Historic Christianity had retained po ssession o f a dead Christ, the mere husk of the grub, together with a vague belief in the butterfly; and if you, likewise, b elieve in its one dead grub, you may cultivate the hop e of some day, also, b ecomi ng a butterfly. But, for the Gnostics, the transformation from t he c hrysalis cond ition o f m atter to the spiritual was a natural fact of which they had an ever - present vitalising consciousness. They were transformi ng and seeking attainment all t heir life through; and their Christ was the representative type of that transformation o f the mortal in to an imm ortal. Historic Christianity abolished the Gnostic spiritualism for all who acce pted the false belief! Henceforth there was but one spirit, that of the historic Bringer of Imm ortality to Light; and, if any apparition appeared to the a bno rmal or no rmal vision, it would b e the historic Christ for ever after! It was s o with the vision o f Paul, which was reported and perverted in the Book o f Acts. When h is inner eyes were opened h e saw spirits -- as Swedenbo rg and many others are reported to h ave don e -- w hereupon they avowed h e had seen the risen Jesus, their only witness for a spirit - world! So h as it been with the non - Spiritualists ever since, for whom an apparition must be the Christ. In an island n ear Rotterdam, says Renan, the peasants believe that Chr ist comes to the bed o f death to assure the e lect of their justification. In po int of fact m any see him ! On the other hand, the Buddh ist \"Lotus\" declares that thou sands of Buddh as s how their face s to the virtuou s man at the moment of his decea se, which p ro ves the Buddh as to b e spirits.

Al l such manifestations as had p reviously occurred and h ad b een attributed to the spirits of the departed, were now ascribed to the power of Christ, in whose name the proph esying was performed, the healing effected, and the mental medicine dispensed. Hencefo rth there was to b e no o ther name und er heaven bu t this. In this name only were the Gentiles to h ave hop e.

So much more potent was fa ith than fact. The ea rlier spiritualism was found ed upon facts in n ature, which d id no t need the desperate e xpedient of a mi racle to explain. But in the later cult the more the mi racle the larger loomed the supernatural, and the broader were the found ation s for the belief that was based on faith instead o f f acts, and on Materialism plus M iracle. They acc oun ted for the spiritual phenomena of the Gnostics by declaring, as Justin Martyr did, that when the devil and the demons knew that Christ was believed on, and that he was expected \"in every race ,\" they put forth Sim on, Menander, and the other Gnostics to d ece ive the multit ude with magic. Beca use Spiritualism was naturally and for ever at war with the historical mi sinterpretation, Justin asserts that after th e a scension o f Christ into Heaven, the demons put forward certain men like Sim on to d eclare that they were the Gods. Whereas, h istoric Christianity proclaim ed them t o b e devils; and d evils they have remained ever since, acc ording to the false belief. The f ound ers of the Catholic Church were the de - Spiritualizers of primiti ve Christianity, and the destroyers of the Gnostic religion as s uch, b y placing their ban upon all Spiritualistic phenomena! The found ations of the a ncient cult were to b e built upon no lo nger. In the rece ntly discovered Didach√© or the \"Teac hing of the Apostles,\" the facts of Spiritualism are a dmitt ed, and the practices of the proph ets are recognized. They are spok en o f as \"ordering a table in the spirit,\" and o f \"assembling together f or a Cosmi c mystery.\" But those a re the true mediums alone who h ave the \"manners of the Lord;\" and the law as laid do wn in these Didach√© is: -- \"Thou shalt not play the mage! Thou shalt not practise witchcraft\" -- or spirit - intercourse. No p roph et that speaks as o ne of the possessed is to b e tried o r tolerated. \"Every sin shall be forgiven, bu t this s in shall not be forgiven.\" It was now and h enceforth to b e Spiritualism withou t spirits, abstract and ideal, no t tangible or r eal, an article of f aith v ersus fact. We see from t he Epistle of John ho w mortally afraid o f Gnostic Spiritualism were the found ers of the historical fraud. \"Many dece ivers are gone forth into the world that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh.\" These words of John state the Gnostic po sition. Their Christ had no t so come, and could no t be ca rnalized. These Gnostics were in the world long before they heard o f such a doctrine; but when they did they denied and oppo sed it. This, says John, is the a nti - Christ. But, \"every spirit which co nfesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God; and every spirit which annu lleth Jesus is not of God. And this is the spirit of the anti - Christ whereof ye have heard that it cometh, and no w it i s in the world already.\" A story is told o f two ea rly English saints, on e of whom was s uppo sed to h ave died. They were a bou t to bu ry him , when, as he was being lowered into the grave, face upward and uncovered, h e opened wide his ghostly staring eyes and told them he had on ly fallen into a trance.

That was how the Catholic Christians dealt with the Gnostic Spiritualists when they had the power. They would shut up the livi ng mouth o f the Spirit - world, b eca use the reports from t he other side were fatal to the Historic fiction. They broke down the bridge between the two worlds, and proclaim ed a great gulf fixed forever, which could on ly be c rossed b y faith in the Historic Jes us. Here the movement of Historic Christianity was a direct and d eliberate shun ting of the human mi nd from off the main line, the highway of its natural development, and runn ing it head first into all sorts of bye - ways and b lind alleys, from which we have had to turn b ack and grope out again as best we c ould for any progress to b e made. Historic Christianity originated with turning the Gnostic a nd Esoteric teac hings inside out and externalising the mythical allegory in a personal human h istory. All t hat was interior with the kno wers was made objective; all t hat was s piritual in significance was embod ied to b e made palpable for the ignorant. A corporeal Christ was s ubstituted for the trans - corporeal m an -- a Christ whose a dvent was withou t, instead o f the one t hat m ust be evolved within -- a personal Saviour who d ied for all, instead o f the Christ that was the living Spirit working within all. It was remarked b y Augustine (de Civ. Dei, 7, 24 ) that the Gnostics \"promi sed eternal li fe to anybod y\" -- that is, with them the soul of man was an eternal principle, and the resurrection was not cunn ingly reserved for the e lect who acce pted the Historic belief. The Gnostic c laim ed to b e illumi nated b y the presence of the Christ within; the Christian, acc ording to Justin, b y th e name of the Christ withou t. And a very curious mental li nk o f conn ection b etween the genuine Gnostic a nd the c oun terfeit Historic Christ is apparent in the Ignatian Epistle to the Smyrneans. The writer says -- \"I kno w that even after his resurrection h e wa s in the flesh, and I believe that he is s o still .\" Now this combines both, after a fashion. The writer is s eeking to establish the history against those who d enied that the Christ could b e made a man. In do ing this, h e has recourse to the Gnostic Christ, who always was in the flesh, o r matter, as the salt of soul, and the only spiritual Saviour fr om death and d issolution. Speaking from his Gnostic standpo int, Paul declared to the historic Christians who followed John and Peter, that God h ad sent them a wo rking of error, that they shou ld b elieve a lie, b eca use they rejected the truth as it was acc ording to h is spiritual Gospel! The lie was established b y externalising the Christ that can on ly dwell within -- by succe ssfully falsifying for a tim e that truth wh ich is true for ever. In this way, you see, that t he c omi ng of the Holy Spirit, which always had b een within, was henceforth to b e withou t. Thus, the descent of the Holy Ghost upon Jesus, in Jordan, is an external transaction. The Holy Spirit t hat comes fr om heaven in the form of a dov e -- a Gnostic type of the Spirit; t hat is, o f both sexes -- or, later on, as a whirlwind, in which the Gust and Ghost are one. In the c ourse of this conv ersion o f the inner to the outer, we a re told that the Holy Ghost, which alw ays had b een extant with the Gnostics, was not yet given, b eca use the Historical Jesus was not yet glorified; but after he had risen from t he grave, and returned bod ily to the disciples, h e breathed upon them, and said, \"Rece ive ye the Holy Ghost.\" And aga in: the Holy Ghost, as an external effusion, could no t be given"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"until after forty days; whereas, in the Essenic Mysteries, the bod y of the disciple beca me the temple of the Holy Ghost when h e had reac hed the sixth stage of interior progress.

Two d istinct charges are brought against the Carnalizers by Tatian in the second century. He c ries out shame upon the Catholic Church, and exclaim s, \"You h ave given the Nazarite wine to d rink, and comm anded the proph ets, saying, 'Proph esy not.'\" They were debauching the Christian comm unity and d estroying the primiti ve Nazarite purity which Tertullian claim ed for the Christians when h e said, \"We a re they of whom it i s written, 'Their Nazarites are whiter than snow.'\" Next, they have determi ned to pu t an end to practical spiritualism on b ehalf of the new faith; and this is treated b y Tatian as part of a subtle scheme for destroying the purity and spirituality of that Chr istianity which was primiti ve a nd non - historic, too! The transformations of the Pagan cult i nto the Christian, and o f the Gnostic into the historical representation, were e ffected b ehind the veil i dentifiable a s the \"Discipline of the Secret,\" the strictne ss of which was only relaxed after the fourth century, when the Truth h ad b een h idden in a fog of falsehood ; the inner mysteries turned to an ou ter mi st, that m ade c onfusion cunn ingly complete. The Gnostic Spiritualism was declared illegal and im pious. The ob jective realiti es of the phenomenal Spiritualists, which h ad h eretofore furnished the one bit of f oothold in natural fact for a belief in the future life, were now discarded on b ehalf of the more subjective idealiti es derived from a faith that was found ed b y means of a fraudu lent history mi s - translated from a mystical fable. The Roman Church adop ted the Angels and Archangels of the Celestial Allegory as its Saints, including Saint Bacc hus and Saint Satan in p lace of Guardian Spirits that were once human beings. A dogma of the Real Presence of the Historic Christ was now substituted for the Real Presence of Spirit Friends in the ea rlier comm union. The mysteries in which the ea rly Christian Neoph ytes had b een initiated into a lawful comm union with the dea d were gradually supp ressed; and in the sixth century we find the doctrine of a c omm union with the saints was s ubstituted for the practical intercourse with spirits. It happens that the tim e when the doctrine was inserted in the Creed coincides alm ost exac tly with the supp ression o f the mysteries which were c onn ected with the so - called Agap√¶ of the ea rly Christians! The Agap√¶ were only a c ontinuation o f the a ncient Pagan funeral feasts and Eucharistic rites in honou r of the departed.

In Luke the risen Christ is \"carried up into Heaven\" on the third d ay following the c rucifixion. In the Acts he is not \"taken up \" into Heaven until t he fortieth d ay, o r after forty days! Such serious discrepancies as these a re forever irreconcilable a s history, bu t they are found to contain the very facts that reconstitute the Mythos. The resurrection o f Osiris at the Autumn equinox was lunar; at the vernal equinox it was solar. After he was betrayed to h is death, when the su n was in the sign o f Scorpio, h e rose again on the third d ay as Lord o f Light in the moon, o r as Horus, the c hild o f the mother - moon. The solar resurrection was at the vernal equinox when the sun entered the first of the upp er signs and Orion rose. This ti me it was in the c haracter of the second Horus, the adult of 30 years; and this s econd resurrection followed the forty days of mourning for the suffering God which were ce lebrated in the Mysteries, and survive in a Christianized form as our Lent. And just as the myth o f the doub le Horus in the two characters of the child o f 12 years, and the a dult Horus of 30 years, h as been continued in the Gospels to furnish the two ph ases in the life of Jesus, so h ave the two d ifferent resurrections with their correct da tes been applied to the Christ m ade historical. Thus interpreted b y means of the Mythos these two v ersions of one a lleged fact tend to corrobo rate my explanation already made that the two d ifferent dates for the c rucifixion given in the otherwise irreconci lable acc oun ts belong to the luni - solar r eckon ing in the same luni - solar myth. In Egyptian the signs of a half - moon and fourteen d ays are identical; and in the dark h alf of the moon Osiris was torn into fourteen p arts. Therefore"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"the 14th o f the lunar month was the day of full m oon. Whereas in the soli - lunar month o f thirty days the 15th was the mi ddle of the month.

This will be on the 14th o f the month o f twen ty - eight days in the reckon ing by the moon on ly, bu t on the 15th o f the month acc ording to the soli - lunar r eckon ing. The 14th o f the month would b e the lunar reckon ing of Anup = John, and the 15th that of Taht - Mati = Mathew in the two forms of the Egyptian Mythos. Both reckon ings were e xtant in two d ifferent cults and bo th were separately continued b y the Eastern and Western Churches for the one day of the crucifixion. Both canno t be historically correct, bu t they are both astrono mi cally true. Both could b e made to meet at a given po int i n the total combination which was determi ned b y the c onjunction o f the sun and moon at the e quinox as the day of f ull moon. But the two d ifferent dates for the mi d - month remained, and these a re represented by the traditions of two d ifferent dates for the c rucifixion. Both the lunar and the solar dates could b e utili sed b y the Mythos, in which there were two crucifixions and two resurrections, thou gh these will bear witness for the single fact of the historical crucifixion. As we have seen, the two ascensions of Osiris on the third d ay and at the e nd of f orty days, h ave been p reserved, and are repeated as historical t ransactions. Two different Crosses were a lso contained in the Christian Icono graphy as the c ross of Autumn and o f Easter; and althou gh we may not be a ble to show two crucifixions in the Canon ical Gospels, n evertheless the total m atter of the Mythos is there. When Jesus was led up into the wilderness to b e tempted o f the devil, and to suffer during forty days, we hav e the parallel to the struggle between Osiris and Sut, which was celebrated du ring the forty days of mourning in the mysteries. Moreover, there were two d ays of death o r crucifixion k ept in Rome until t he present century, when the dead Christ used to b e la id out and exhibited on the Thursday before Good Friday; and two d ays of resurrection were also celebrated in the two Sabbaths on Saturday and Sund ay. As the Apostolic Constitutions s how, bo th o f these days were c ontinued for the two weekly holidays of the Christians, Saturday being the day of rising again on the 7th d ay of the week in the lunar cult; Sund ay, the Sabbath o f the 8th d ay, acc ording to the solar resurrection. Such are the fund amental facts; and, to my thinking, they are of sufficient force to cleave the Canon ical history right in two, eac h h alf being then claim ed b y the Mythos. Here, as elsewhere, the Mythos does explain the fact, bu t only by abolishing the history. From beginning to end the a scertainable facts are a strono mi cal, and interpretab le solely by means of the Gnostic e xplanation o f the Egyptian Mythos, which always denied, b eca use it disproved, the a lleged hu man h istory.

I do bu t flesh the skeleton o f facts. It is not the a ncient legends that tell us lies! The men who created them did no t deal falsely with u s by nature. All t he falsity lies in their having been falsified through ignorantly mi staking mythology for divine revelation and allegory for historic truth. Geology was not taught among the mysteries of ancient kno wledge, floating fragments of which h ave drifted do wn to u s in the Book o f Genesis. The Christian world assumed that it was -- or, at least, some sort of globe - making -- and therefore it was found to b e e ntirely oppo sed to scientific geology. Mythology never did inculcate the historic fall of man. Theologists have ignorantly suppo sed that it did, and as a result t hey we re bitterly oppo sed to the a scent of man, made kno wn b y means of evolution! Such do ctrines as the Fall of Man, the failure of God, and all t hat bankrupt business in the comm encement of creation, the c onsequent genesis of evil and o riginal sin, the depravit y of matter, the filthy nature of the flesh h ave no o ther basis or beginning than in the perversion o f ancient typology, and the literalisation o f mythology. According to the Hebrew G enesis the first m an was born withou t a mother or a female of any kind. I f that be fact acc ording to revelation, it canno t be acc ording to n ature! But there is nothing g ained b y calling it \" Reve lation .\" By doing so \"Revelation\" has come to be a name a pplied to anything which we may not, for the tim e being, und erstand. \"Revelati on\" has come to mean a series of confound ing lies, warranted b y God to b e true! By making this a revelation d irect from deity y ou d estroy the c haracter of the divine intelligence, which d id no t kno w the facts, p rocesses, o r order, o f its own works; or if i t did it m ust have palm ed o ff a lying version on the medium of comm unication to the world as a divine revelation made to man. But Adam never denoted a first m an who was produ ced withou t a mother, no r Eve a first woman formed from an actual rib o f Adam. Tha t is but the literalisation o f a symbolical mode of representation, the key to which h as been long mislaid . Speaking of the matter f ound in the Pentateuch, Philo, the learned Jew, told h is coun trymen the truth when h e said : \"The literal statement is a fabu lous one, and it i s in the mythical we shall fi nd the true.\" On the other hand, h e a sserts of the myths found in"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"the Hebrew form: \"These things are not m ere fabulous inventions, in which the race of poets and soph ists delight, bu t are types s hadowing forth an allegorical truth acc ording to some mystical explanation;\" not a history. The literal version is the false; and it is in the mythical that we shall find the true, bu t only when it i s truly interpreted. Mythology is not to b e und erstood b y literalisatio n, eve n though the Christian creed ha s been found ed on that fatal method ! It is not to b e made real by modern rationalizing, thou gh that is the basis of Unitarianism; nor is it t o b e utili zed b y eac h on e furnishing their own system of Hermeneutical interpr etation. Mythology is an ancient system of kno wledge, with its own mode of expression, which enshrined the science of the past in what look s to u s at tim es like foolish and un meaning fables. It is entirely useless to speculate on such a subject, o r try to read on e's own interpretation into the myths, with no clue whatever to their prim ordial m eaning. Anybod y can make a n allegory go on all - fours, and read some sort of history into a myth. And, o f course, h e that hides can find; i f you pu t your own meaning in to what you read, you can d iscover it t here. You may say it is so; any one ca n say , and po ssibly get a few others to h earken and b elieve, bu t no amoun t of mere assertion will establish the truth b y means of a false interpretation o f the fable. Some persons will t ell us that if the \"Fall of Man\" be not a fact once a nd for all, b etter still , it i s true for ever, b eca use men and women are a lways falling; therefore the a llegory is over true, and, in po int of f act, a divine revelation. I have heard p reac hers res olve the nocturnal wrestling - match b etween Jacob and the a ngel into an exquisite a llegory, made to run on all - fours for very sim ple people to ride on, an allegory full of light and leading, and lovely in its moral and spiritual significance, for sorely tem pted men. The night of the struggle is made internal. The a ngel is transformed into the devil, and we have the wrestle of the soul with the tempter, and a man on his knees all night in p rayer. It is the conflict of Christian and Apollyon hu manized, and fou ght out in a bedroom, in p lace of the dark v alley of the shadow of death. It is in this wise that such stories are to b e saved from absurdity, o rthodo xy is to regain its lost supremacy, and science a nd religion are to be reconciled for ever. But there is n o truth in it all . The history was not hu man at first, and this s ubjective mode of treatm ent does but reface it with another sort of falsehood. If we would ascertain what these old stories originally meant we must go to mythology. In this case the Hottento ts can enlighten u s. They have a myth o r fable of Tsuni - Goam and Gaunab, the twins, who p ersonate the presence of light and d arkness, the powers of good and evil. These two contend in mortal conflict night after night, the good on e getting the better of th e bad on e by degrees, and growing stronger with every battle fought. At last Tsuni - Goam grew mi ghty enou gh to give his enemy a blow at the back o f his ear, which put an end to Gaunab. But just as he was expiring and falling back into h is own abyss of darkn ess, Gaunab gave his oppon ent a blow in the hollow of his leg, that m ade him go lim ping for life. In consequence he was called \"Tsuni - Goam,\" the meaning of which name is \"wound ed kn ee.\" The struggle was that of light and d arkness in the orb o f the moon, o r the sun o f night fighting his way through the valley of the shadow of death in the und erworld, du ring the winter, when h is movement was s lower; and h e was represented as being lame in on e knee, o r maim ed in h is lower member.

According to h im t he acc oun t of the Creation in Genesis is not a real history, bu t a narrative written in the style of the Ancient Churches, signifying sp iritual and d ivine things. The general subject of the first chapter is not the generation, bu t the new creation; the genesis becomes the re - genesis; the perverted mythos is an intentional spiritual allegory; the six days are six states in the re - creation o f man; t he seventh d ay represents the celestial m an, and h e is the garden o f Eden, and also the most ancient Church! Adam's nakedness denotes the purity of the internal m an, o r the state of inno cence of the ce lestial Church! Eve a lso signifies the Church. Cain is the name of those who falsified the doctrine of the most ancient Church. The serpent going on its belly denotes the groveling of the sensual principle seeking after corporeal things. The flood o r deluge was a total imm ersion o f mankind in evil and falsehood ! Everything in the Word relates to the heavenly and spiritual, and is falsified if transferred to a lower level. But spiritual significations are not primary! The natural or physical m ust come first, b eca use they were first; t he e schatological is last. Man was no more re - made than h e was made on the sixth day. Swedenbo rg kno ws or ackno wledges nothing of the origin in n atural phenomena; nothing of the true mythical m ode of representation; nothing of an astrono mi cal basis for the Garden o f Eden, the tree of kno wledge, the serpent, o r the prim al pair, whose figures are pou rtrayed and whose story can still be read as it was first written in the stars of heaven! The im agery and types of mythology can, o f course, b e used as a mode of expression for later ideas, and for moral or spiritual significations -- just as we c ontinue to say the moon rises, o r the sun sets, after we kno w better; but, from t he mund ane standpo int, the natural, the physical, the e xternal alone were prim al. Hence primiti ve Mythology is n o more moral or imm oral than it i s obscene, senseless, o r insane, sim ply beca use the phenomena were not human . Before the Egyptian h ieroglyphics were und erstood Swedenbo rg und ertook to vou ch for the fact that they represented spiritual ideas by means of na tural objects, acc ording to h is own do ctrine of correspond ences; which is no more true than h is interpretation o f the Hebrew G enesis. This can b e proved. The hieroglyphics began as direct object - pictures, which b eca me symbolical in a later phase. The three Water - Signs of the Zodiac do no t represent a spiritual experience in this \"Vale of Tears,\" but the three months' Inund ation which is annu al in the Valley of the Nile. The fact is that we ca nno t translate the thou ght of primiti ve or pre - historic man withou t first learning the language in which is was expressed. The wisdom, o r gnosis, so carefully hidden and jealously guarded in the past, is not to b e recovered with any certitude by clairvoyant insight or intuitional m emory, whosoever sets up the c laim ! You may have the vision to see the hidden treasures lying buried at the bottom of the ocea n, but you will not be a ble to b ring it back to men b y merely dredging for it i n your dreams. There were Illumi nati i n the mysteries of old, bu t they did no t trust to the intuitional faculty for that information, which took them seven o r ten years to acquire.

Nor did such things originate in riddles or intentional enigmas. You may believe me when I affirm, and you can p rove it for yourselves, that m ythology was a primiti ve method o f teac hing natural facts, and not an esoteric mode of mi sinterpreting them ! What we need to kno w is the prim ary meaning of the myth - makers; and this can on ly be recovered b y collecting and comparing all t he e xtant versions of the original m ythos. There is no b eginning with the mystical or metaphysical i n the past before we have mastered the mythical; t hat can on ly lead to a maze, o r to b eing lost i n a mi st of mystification, as s oon as we a re out of the wood o f literalisation! Cardinal Baronius has s aid that the intention o f Holy Scripture is to teac h u s how to go to heaven, and not how the heavens go! But the ea rliest Scripture did teac h how the heavens go, and it beca me sacred b eca use it was celestial. The first creation o f heaven and earth was but the division into upp er and lower, b y whatsoever means expressed, answering to th e discreting of light from darkness. This was also rendered b y the dividing of an Egg or Calabash, and b y the c utting of the heaven, the Cow of Heaven, o r the Heifer of the Morning and Evening Star, in two. It was neither earth - making nor heaven - making in any cosmi cal sense -- nothing more than distinguishing the light from t he darkness; the vault abov e from t he void b elow. This is illustrated b y the c reation - legend found on the Assyrian tablets, which comm ences -- \"At that tim e the Heaven abov e had no t announ c ed, no r the Earth b eneath recorded, a name.\" The word first uttered in h eaven related to tim es and seasons, and the ea rliest word was uttered b y the a ppo inted tim e - keepers! The acc oun t of creation given in the second chapter of Genesis is that \"these a re t he generations of the heaven and the ea rth when they were c reated.\" And the generations of the heaven were astrono mi cal. We learn from t he c uneiform l egends of creation ho w in the beginning God created the heavens: -- \"Bel prepared the Seven Mansions of the Gods. He fixed the Stars, even the Twin Stars, to correspond to them; he ordained the year, appo inting the Signs of the Zodiac over it.

The reply of science is a point - b lank d enial. It admit s nothing of this kind. It kno ws better. This is not the order in which the various popu lations made their f irst appearance on the globe; and it was only by classing these popu lations acc ording to the notion o f distinct creations, whic h were produ ced at the rate of one a day or so, that any such d efinition o r distinction could ever have been made.

The plain meaning of the compiler is not to b e e vaded o r got away from. The writer of the Hebrew G enesis s ays positively that all t hings were made a nd finished in on e week, and for that rea son we celebrate the Sabbath d ay. Seven d ays in on e week are a lso shown b y the dedication o f eac h d ay to on e of the seven p lanetary gods. And seven d ays in on e week canno t be geological periods any more than they can apply to the subjective e xperience of t he soul! Mr. Gladstone says the question is \"whether natural science in the patient exercise of its high calling to exami ne facts finds that the works of God cry out against what we have fond ly believed to b e his work, and tell another tale.\" The a nswer is , they do cry ou t, and give the lie to that authority so foolishly suppo sed to b e divine. The Word o f God says that the ac t of Adam brought death into the world. The older record shows, leaf after leaf or stratum beneath stratum, that death h ad b een at wor k tens of milli ons of years before man appeared on the ea rth. In all t hese orthodo x attempts to rationalize mythology, writers and p reac hers are dealing with matters which they have not yet und erstood, and which n ever can b e und erstood on their plane of th ought, o r within their narrow limit s. In √Üsop's fable the wolf overhears the nurse threaten to throw the c hild to h im , and h e believes her; but, after long waiting for the fulfillm ent of proph ecy to b ring him his s upp er, h e finds that she did no t m ean what she said. So is it with the myths; they never meant what they said when literally interpreted. And the literalisation o f mythology is the foun tain - head o f all our false belief, mystification b eing the second ary source. From m y point of view, this is merel y slaying the slain ov er again. And yet this literalisation o f mythology is continued to b e taught as God's truth to the men and women o f the future in their ignorant and confiding childhood. And some e ight or ten milli ons of pound s are a nnu ally filched fr om our national revenues for the benefit of a Church and clergy established and legally empowered to make the people believe that these falsified fables are a true divine revelation, rece ived d irect from God; and if they doub t and d eny it t hey will be doo m ed to suffer atrocious tortures through all eternity. Mr. Gladstone says he is persuaded that the belief of Christians and Jews concerning the inspiration o f the Book is im pregnable. He believes the Genesis to be a revelation for the Christians, made by Go d to the Jews, such as presents to the rejecter of that belief a problem which d emands s olution at his hands, and which h e has not been able to solve. For him self, Mr. Gladstone is s o sim ple a nd p rofound a believer in revelation, if biblical, and in the in spiration o f the Mosaic writer in p articular, that he is lost in astonishment at the phenomenon it presents to h im .

Mr. Gladstone's assumption is the sheerest fallacy. The wond erful tradition was not bo rn among them! It was wholly and far more perfectly pre - extant amongst the Persians, the Akkadians, and Egyptians. The Book o f Genesis is assigned to a man who was learned in all t he wisdom of the Egyptians. I canno t answer for the man, bu t I can for some of the matter. To b egin with, the le gend o f Eden is one of those prim eval traditions that m ust have been the c omm on property of the und ivided hu man race , carried ou t into all l ands as they dispersed in various directions from one ce ntre, which I hold to h ave been African. As Sharpe, an early English Egyptologist, and a translator of the Hebrew Scriptures, asserts correctly - \"The whole history of the fall of man is of Egyptian o rigin. The temptation o f the woman by the serpent, and o f man b y the woman, the sacred tree of kno wledge, the c herubs guarding with flami ng swords the doo r of the garden, the warfare declared b etween the woman and the serpent, may all be seen upon the Egyptian sculptured monu ments.\" The French Egyptologist, M. Lef√©bure, who h as lately identified Adam with the Egyptian At um, as I had don e seven years earlier in my Book o f Beginnings, refers to a scene on the c offin o f Penpii i n the Louv re, which is s imil ar to the history of Adam i n the terrestrial paradise, where a naked and ithyphallique personage ca lled \"the Lord o f food \" (Neb - tefa), is s tanding before a serpent with two legs and two arms, and the reptile is offering him a red fruit, o r at least a littl e round ob ject painted red. The same scene is again found on the tomb o f Rameses VI. And on a statue relatively rece nt in the Museum of Turin it i s to Atum = Adam t hat the serpent, as Tempter, is offering the round ob ject, or fr uit of the tree. The same writer says -- \"The Tree of life a nd kno wledge was well kno wn in Egypt.\" And \"whether the scene of Neb - tefa ca n b e identified with the history of Adam or not, we can see that the greater number of the peculiar features of this history existed in Egypt -- the tree of life a nd kno wledge, the serpent of Paradise, Eve thinking of appropriating divinity to h erself, and in short Adam hi mself, are a ll t here.\" (Trans.

Mr. Gladstone may have been mi sled b y the Hibbert lecturer, Mr. Renou f, who h as s aid (p.243 ), \"It m ay be c onfidently asserted that neither the Hebrews nor Greeks learned any of their ideas from Egypt.\" A statement which reveals a c ongenital deficiency of the comparative faculty. The same may be said o f Professor Sayce, when h e a sserts the \"the Theology and the Astrono my of Egypt and Babylonia show no v estiges of a c omm on source.\" The Creation o f the Woman from t he Man in the second chapter of Genesis is likewise found in the Magical Texts, where it i s s aid o f the Seven Spirits -- \"They bring forth the Woman from t he Loins of the Man\" (Sayce, Hib. Lect. 395 ). This also h as an Egyptian mark upon it. Such a c reation is alluded to in the Book o f the Dead, where the speaker says, \"I kno w the mystery of the Woman who was made from the Man.\" Professor Sayce a lso asserts that there is \"no trace in the Book o f Genesis\" of the great struggle between the God o f Light and the Dra gon o f Darkness, who in on e form are Merodach and Tiamat. The c onflict is there, ho wever, bu t from t he original Egyptian source. It is represented as the e nmit y between the Woman and the Serpent, and also b etween h er Seed and the Serpent. The Roman Church renders the passage (Gen. iii. 15) addressed to the Serpent -- \"She shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise her heel.\" Both v ersions are Egyptian. Horus is the Son and Seed o f Isis. Sometim es he is pou rtrayed as bruiser of the Apap Serpent's head; at oth ers it i s s he who conqu ers. Both are c ombined in the Imagery which the Egyptians s et in the Planisphere, where Isis in the shape of Virgo b ears the Seed in h er hands, and b ruises the Serpent's head b eneath h er feet. This Seed in on e form was s own in Egypt imm ediately after the Inund ation, and in this way (as I have shown) the Zodiaca l representation reflects the Seasons of Egypt all round the year. The Serpent it self in the Hebrew G enesis is neither an o riginal nor a true type. Two oppo site c haracters have been fused and confused in it for the sake of a false moral. Serpent and Dragon were prim arily identical as emblems of evil i n ph ysical phenomena; eac h was the representative of Darkness, and as s uch the Deluder of Men. Afterwards the Serpent was made a ty pe of Tim e, o f Renewal, and, therefore, o f Life; t he Dragon - Crocodile a zo√∂type of intelligence. Both Crocodile a nd Serpent were c ombined in Sevekh - Ra. Both were c ombined in the Polar Dragon; and in the Book o f Revelation the Dragon remains that old Serpen t, considered to b e the Deluder of Mankind. Both were combined in the Chnub is Serpent - Dragon o f the Gnostics, which was a survival of Kneph as the Agatho - Demon o r Good Serpent of Egypt. The Akkadian type a s Ea, is the Good Serpent, the Serpent of Life, the God o f Wisdom. Now it was the Serpent of Wisdom t hat first offered the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge for the Enlightenment of Mankind; whether this be Egyptian, Akkadian, o r Gnostic, it i s the Good Serpent.

Professor Sayce's s tatements are no more c orrect than Mr. Renou f's, and Mr. Renou f's is no more true than Mr. Gladstone's. Further evidence may be found in my \"Natural Genesis.\" But no non - Evolutionist can und erstand o r interpret the Past. He is too ready to acce pt the re - be ginning, where there ca n b e a t m ost a new point of departure. Mr. Gladstone has been too much wrapt up in the One Book ! He does not kno w that the story of Genesis is to b e found written in the Bible a bov e, and that the Happy Garden, the prim al pair, the wa r of the serpent, and the first m other, together with the Tree of Knowledge, are a ll constellated in the stars of heaven, acc ording to Egyptian mythology, and are a ll verifiable on the monu ments. When h e does learn that such is the fact, h e canno t claim t h at the history inscribed upon the starry walls was written b y the Jews, o r copied from t he Hebrew record! But let us s ee whether we ca nno t discover a few more Egyptian marks on the Genesis! A Paradise or Garden that is watered withou t rain b y a mi st that w ent up from t he ea rth to fall upon it i n refreshing dew is certainly suggestive of an Egyptian o rigin, as that was the one way in which Egypt was watered from abov e. This was not so in the Eden at the head of the Persian Gulf. Besides which the Eight Prim a ry Powers or Gods of Egypt were the dwellers in Eden o r \"Am - Smen,\" the Paradise of the Eight , who comprised the Genetrix and h er Seven Children. The original Genesis and all t he c hief Types are identifiably Egyptian to b egin with. But t he Hebrew version wa s more directly derived from t he Persian, as the Evil Serpent proves. Water was the first element of life recognized b y the primiti ve perception. Water was considered to b e the mother, o r Maternal Source, p ersonified. In Egypt the Mother of Life pou rs out the Water of Life from t he Tree of Life! She is the first form of the Celestial Waterer. In the mystical sense, Blood is the Water of Life, and therefore the Mother of Life. This beginning on earth with and from t he water was Egyptian, Babylonian, Mexican, Indian, Chinese, Greek, British, Universal. It is s aid upon an Assyrian tablet that \"the heaven was made from t he waters.\" So in the Egyptian b eginning the sky was look ed upon as the ce lestial water. This water was also entified in the river Nile, which w as called the \"Way of the Gods,\" when the Nature - Powers had b een d ivinised. In that sense, as it were, h eaven d escended, to b e c ontinued on earth. From t his water of heaven the land in Egypt was visibly deposited, and the ea rth was \"compacted ou t of water and b y means of water.\" When these were discreted there was the dry land. Here if anywhere is the prim ary hint of a c osmi cal beginning with a fact in n ature, bu t not with a theory of nature nor a system of geology."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The second element of life was Breath, an im a or air. In Egyptian, b reath o r spirit i s Nef; and this was personated b y Kneph, a form of the first god, who is s aid to b e the breath o f souls, o r those who are in the firmament. Nef, for breath and spirit, explains the Hebrew Nephesh for soul, as the breath o f life. Kneph, the breathing life in the firmament, is also the Sailor on the water! In the Hebrew version, Kneph b ecomes the Spirit m oving on the face of the waters. In the Egyptian representation h e sails the waters in h is ark, -- just as Ea does i n the Akkadian v ersion o f the myth. The god Kneph is also the spirit t hat presides over the Bau , which h ad b ecome the Pit - hole, o r the Tomb from t he Womb o f the Beginning. The Egyptian Bau is the Hebrew Bohu, o r the Void. In bo th it i s a place left unp erso nified. In the later phase of personification this Bau o f Birth b ecomes the Ph≈ìnician Baev, called the Consort of Kolpia, the Wind o r Spirit. The Bau was also personified in the Babylonian godd ess Bohu. The Ph≈ìnician Baev po ints back to the Egyptian Bab (o r Beb) for the hole, cave, well, source, o r outrance -- the original of all t he Babs in later language, including Babylon. Now, that which is performed b y the Elohim en g ros in Genesis is don e by the Ali, o r Seven Companions, in Egypt, most of whom can b e r ecognized individually in relation to the Seven Elements. As the Hebrew Elohim , they may be dislim ned and lose their likeness, bu t t hey are the same seven po wers of eternal nature (as explained b y the Gnostics or Kabalists). In on e of the Egyptian creation - legends -- shown b y a monu ment which was restored in the tim e of Shabaka -- it i s s aid o f the Creator, \"A blessing was pronoun ced upon all t hings in the day when h e bid them exist, and b efore he had yet caused gods to b e made for Ptah.\" This, it appears to me , h as left another Egyptian mark on the first chapter of Genesis in the refrain, \"And the Elohim saw that it was good, \" which is uttered seven tim es over, in acc ordance with the sevenfold n ature of the Elohim; and the blessing is pronoun ced -- \"And God b less ed them!\" \" And God b lessed the seventh day!\" It would b e going to far afield to show all t he Egyptian marks in on e lecture; but I must offer another example. The Hebrew w ord employed for creating, when the Elohim form t he heaven and the ea rth, is \"Bara.\" T he e ssential m eaning of the word is to give a manifestation in form t o material previously withou t shape. Nothing could so p erfectly realize it as the potter at work on h is clay. And the Egyptian im age of a Creator, as the Former, is Khepr, who, as the Bee tle, formed h is littl e globe with h is hands, and who, as Khepr - Ptah, is the Potter sitti ng at his wheel, and shaping the e gg of the sun and moon, o r the vase of matter to contain life -- he who was the Former or Creator \"in h is name of Let - the - Earth - be.\" The Potter, in Hebrew and Ph≈ìnician, is the Jatzer; and this word is also applied to the Hebrew G od as Creator, Jatzariah b eing Jah the Potter. Thus the Kabalist Book o f Creation, n amed the Sepher - Jatzirah, is the Book o f Creation as the workmanship o f the Fo rmer or Potter. Anyone who kno ws anything of the monu ments will here recognize a nother Egyptian mark; I may say the Egyptian po tter's mark on the Hebrew creations. The Creator or Former, as Khepr - Ptah the Potter, is the head o f the Seven Knemm u, who are hi s assistants in the work o f creation. He is the c hief of the Ali or Elohim , as the fashioner and bu ilder of the heavens. He is also the father of the Egyptian Adam, o r Atum, the Red One; just as the Hebrew or Ph≈ìnician Elohim are the creators of Adam t he R ed. Jehov ah - Elohim , the Lord God o f the second chapter of Genesis, can b e further identified with Ptah, the found er of the ea rth and former of men. Ptah is the father of Atum = Adam, the father of human b eings. He is designated the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"father of the fathers, a n equivalent to the titl e of Ialdabaoth, chief of the seven Gnostic Elohim . The name of Ptah signifies the Opener fr om Put to op en; and the Hebrew name of xyxtp shows that Jah is Puthach = Putha, o r Ptah, as the Opener (cf. Fuerst, p. 1166 ). These we may c laim for other Egyptian marks. But I have now learned that the acc oun t of the c reations in Genesis is not so d irectly derived from t he Egyptian as I had on ce thou ght; t hat is, it was re - written after the tim e of the ca ptivity in Babylon, and the c onsequen t acquaintance with the c reation - legends in their latest Persian form. This can b e shown b y a c omparison with the Parsee Bund ahish or Aboriginal Creation -- more literally, the Creation o f the Beginning. Indeed, we may suspect t hat t he first words of the Heb rew G enesis have to do with the titl e of the Bund ahish. They are, \"B'Rashith Elohim Bara;\" and \"B'Rashith,\" when literally translated, reads, \"in the beginning of,\" leaving an elipsis, withou t stating in the beginning of what! Now the meaning of the word B und ahish is, the Creation o f the Beginning. This far more perfect statement seems to h ave been bun gled in adapting it for the Hebrew version. The first two facts distinguishable in external phenomena by man were those of Darkness and Light. The panorama o f mythological representation is drawn ou t from t hese a s its opening scene, and the long procession o f the Powers of Nature, which b eca me divinities at a later stage, starts upon its march through h eaven abov e to cast it s s hadows on the earth b elow. By obs erving the a lternation o f Light and Darkness, a prim ary measure of tim e was first established as the c reation o f a night and d ay, marked b y the Twin - Star. And \"there was evening, and there was morning, on e day,\" as the result of this earliest creation o f t he Beginning. In the Persian Bund ahish, the deity Ahura - Mazda is the c hief of the Seven Amchaspands just as the c reator Ptah is of the Seven Khnemm u; and the Gnostic Ialdabaoth o f the Seven Elohim . Here we learn that the God created the world in six period s, althou gh not in six days. The first of Ahura - Mazda's creatures of the world was the sky, and h is good thou ght by good p rocedure produ ced the light of the world. This is identical with the Elohim seeing the light t hat it was good ; and with the blessing p ronoun ced on h is creations by the Egyptian d eity. The light now separated and distinguished from darkness in the c reation o f tim e is quite distinct from t he divine, the abstract, o r the illimit able a nd eternal li ght already existing with Ahura - Mazda; it i s the evening and morning, on e day. Darkness and light are personified and represented as being at cea seless enmit y with eac h other in the c onfusion o f Chaos, bu t they come to an und erstanding as co - creators, and make a c ovenant, in appo inting this prim eval period o f tim e. And such was the first creation in the Persian series of six. \"And o f Ahura's creatures of the world,\" it i s s aid, \"the first was the sky, the second, water; the third earth; the fourth, plants; t he fifth, anim als; t he sixth, mankind. \" The creation o f light i n the Hebrew Genesis is the c reation o f the sky in the Persian; and the c reation o f water in the Persian"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Genesis, b ecomes the dividing of the waters in the Hebrew version. The tim e of this creation is called the second d ay. The third P ersian creation is that of earth, which is the dry land o f the Hebrew -- \"and the Elohim called the dry land Earth.\" The fourth Persian creation, o r r ather creature, is that of plants. This is not a separate creation in the Hebrew version; it i s thrown into the third creation, that of earth. Nevertheless, the third must have included the plants beca use it i ncludes every herb yielding seed and every tree that bears edible fruit. And yet in chapter 2, v erse 5, when the c reations are a ll completed, and the Eloh im had finished the work which they had made, we a re told that \"no p lant of the field was yet in the ea rth, and no h erb o f the field had yet sprung up. \" Which p roves how mi xed and mudd led, as well as un - original, is the Mosaic version. In the fourth Hebrew creation the heavenly bod ies become the tim e - keepers for signs and seasons. This is not one of the six Persian creations, which six are followed b y the \"formation o f the lumi naries.\" Of these it i s s aid \"Ahura - Mazda produ ced illumi nation b etween the sky a nd the ea rth, the c onstellation - stars and those not of the constellations, then the moon ; and afterwards the sun. \" The fifth Persian creation is that of the a nim als. This creation is limit ed to the winged fowl, sea a nim als, and fishes, in the Hebrew acc oun t, which is considerably mi xed. Mr. Gladstone a sks: \"Is there the smallest inconsistency in a statement which p lace s the emergence of our land, and its s eparation from t he sea, and the c omm encement of vegetable life, b efore the final and full concentration of light upon the sun, and its reflection on the moon and p lanets? and as there would b e light diffused b efore there was light concentrated, why may not that diffused light have been sufficient for the purposes of vegetation?\" Certainly, as there was ligh t enou gh to make day before there was any sun o r moon, there ought to, and shou ld, h ave been. In my reply I am not concerned to reconcile the literal rendering of the Hebrew G enesis with scientific fact, bu t I shall have to po int out on b ehalf of the mythi cal original that acc ording to the present interpretation the heaven and earth could and d id exist before the stars, o r the moon and the sun! There was no tim e kept on earth o r in h eaven un til night and d ay were divided and marked b y the a lternation o f lig ht and d arkness, o r by the Twin Star of Evening and Dawn, therefore the heavenly bod ies were not m ade use of, ergo they did no t exist in any requisite sense of the Mythos. Lastly, man is the produ ct of the sixth creation in bo th renderings. If taken litera lly, man of the sixth Persian creation appears on the scene before the stars or moon o r sun, which follow the six creations, no t as mere light - givers to the ea rth, bu t as tim e - keepers for man. And that alone will explain why the stars are said to b e in exi stence before the moon ; and the moon b efore the sun! In the Persian writings the invariable order is that of stars, moon, and sun! In d escribing the mythical m oun t Alborz, the moun t Meru o f the Persian system of the Heavens, it i s s aid that it grew for 200 years up to the star - station; for 200 more years up to the moon - station; for 200 more years up to the sun - station; for 200 more years up to the e ndless light!

Tim e was first told b y the stars, morning and evening, and b y the seven which turned round on ce in the circle of a year; next by means of the moon and its monthly renewal; next by means of the sun; solar tim e being last b eca use the most difficult t o make out. In a papyrus at Turin it i s s aid o f Taht, the god o f lunar tim e, in Egypt, \"He hath made a ll that the world contains, and h ath given it li ght when all was darkness, and there was as yet no sun!\" This was figurative, a nd applies s olely to the moon, b y which tim e was kept earlier than it could b e defined b y the sun. It is well kno wn that the lunar year and the lunar zodiac, o r pathway of the moon, were ea rlier than the solar zodiac of 12 signs, which is too late for the mythical Beginnings . In the Babylonian acc oun t of creation the moon is produ ced b efore the sun. As George Smit h po ints out, this is in reverse order to that of the Hebrew G enesis. Evidently, h e says, the Babylonians considered the moon the principal bod y, while the book o f Genesis makes the sun the greater light. \"Here is becomes evident,\" says this Bibliolator, \"that Genesis is truer to n ature than the Chaldean text.\" The uninspired Babylonians, you see, did no t kno w that the moon was the lesser, and the sun the larger light! Professor Sayce likewise tells us that \"the idea which und erlay the religious belief of Akkad\" was, that \"the moon existed b efore the sun\" (Hib. Lect. 165 ). Neither of these Assyriologists appears to h ave had any notion why this was s o represented! The Arkadians, the Argives, the Quich√©s, and o ther r ace s of men claim ed to b e Pro - Selenes, o r those who lived b efore the tim e of the moon, no t before the ex istence of that lumi nary! Truer to n ature ca n h ave no meaning for an acc oun t of the c reation o f light prior to the e xistence of the heavenly bod ies -- that is, if literally taken. But neither the Egyptians, Babylonians, no r Persians were talking abou t t he c osmi cal creation in the modern sense, as has been ignorantly assumed, and foolishly co ntended for, bu t abou t the mythical beginnings of the Tim e - keepers. In these the mapping out of the lunar month came before the solar year. Hence the sun - god was called the c hild o f the moon - god Sin, in Assyria, and the lunar god, Taht, o r Tehuti, is calle d the father of Osiris, the sun - god, in Egypt; t he priority being dependent on the ea rlier observations for the keeping of tim e. So the Mexicans held the planet Venus to h ave been created b efore the sun! It was earlier than the moon, they said, and p roperl y the first li ght that appeared in the world. That would b e a s a star of morning and evening which made the first day. Hence we a re told that the first m an, Oannes, came up ou t of the Red Sea, and landed in Babylonia on the \"First Day.\" The Great Mother, t o whom t he planet Venus was dedicated, was represented b y the Heifer, the pure Heifer, the sacred Heifer, the Golden Calf, as it was called. This being of either sex, it supp lied a twin type for Venus, as Hathor or Ishtar, the doub le Star, that was male a t rising and female a t sunset, and therefore the Twin - Stars of the \"First Day.\" Any other earlier sense these c reations have besides that of tim e - keeping was merely elemental, and relating to the order in which man recognized and represented the natural"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"ele ments. Darkness, with its voice of thund er, was the first! Out of the darkness issued the light. These two were the Twins of eternal alternation in external phenomena, found in so many forms of the mythos as the two Brothers, who fought eac h o ther f or the Birthright. The next two were moisture a nd air, o r the water of life a nd the breath o f life. These four creations, o r, as the Bund ahish h as it, four creatures of Ahura - Mazda, were the four elements of darkness and light, water and air. In Egypt they were t ypified b y the Jackal of darkness, the Hawk o f light, the Ape of breath, and the Hippopo tamus or Dragon o f the waters, which were made those Keepers of the four corners who are universal in mythology. They indicate four elements, o r four seasons, four quar ters of the year, o r the four - fold h eaven b y which the c ircle of the whole was divided; and squared as it was in the c ircle of Yim a. I have followed ou t t he various creations, o r heavens, from beginning to end in the \"Natural Genesis.\" At present we must t urn on ce more to the Persian Bund ahish where it says in Revelation -- such b eing the formula frequently employed on matters of religion, o r on the periods for the observance of r eligious duties -- \"the c reatures of the world were created b y me c omplete in thre e hund red and sixty - five days; that is the six periods of the festivals which are c ompleted in a year.\" Here, then, we part company with the six days and on e week o f creation in the Hebrew book o f Genesis! We ca n see that is but a cond ensed summ ary of an e arlier acc oun t, which may lead u s a littl e nearer to n ature, and to those phenomenal facts on which mythology was found ed -- the Rock on which ou r Biblical Theology will be wrecked.

In acc ordance with this sixth creation we learn from t he Targum of Palestine that Adam, as the Adami c man, was created in t he im age of the Lord, h is maker, with 365 n erves.

Now we ca n see how the Persian sixth day of celebration o f each of the six creations beca me the six days of creation in the Hebrew G enesis, in the process of cond ensing mythology into cosmi cal and hu man history; and one year into one week to make it m ore tangible a t a later tim e! The creation s include the e lements identified, together with the various s ystems of keeping tim e, which culmi nated at last in a year of 365 and a quarter days. These systems may be roughly sketched as (1) the one day of a light and d ark; (2) one turn round to a year; (3) the half - years of the solstices; (4) a lunar month o f the four quarters; (5) planetary tim e; (6) solar tim e, or a year of 365 d ays. When it says in the Persian Revelation -- \"The Creatures of the world were c reated b y me in 365 d ays,\" it does not m ean du ring that period, any more than it m eans the six days of the Hebrew mi s - rendering of the matter. It m eans that the c oncluding creation o f the six different creations culmi nated in a year of solar tim e, o r 365 d ays to the year, in the im age of which Adami c man was formed with 365 n erves. The origin o f the Sabbath in Genesis is curiously paralleled, o r suggested, in the Bund ahish. We read \"on matters of r eligion, \" it says in Revelation thus -- \"The c reatures"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"(or six creations) were c reated b y me c omplete in 365 days. That is the six Gahanbars, which are c ompleted in a year.\" And here the matters of religion are e xplained as being the periods for observance of religious duties. That is, the six festivals or Sabbaths were instituted to comm emorate the six creation s which were c reated complete, o r culmi nated, in a year of 365 d ays. The Persians represented their God as resting during five days after eac h o f the six seasons of creation; and they also celebrated a great six days' festival annu ally, b eginning on the 1s t of March and ending on the sixth d ay, as the greatest holiday, b eca use in this, the sixth season (in p lace of the sixth d ay in the Hebrew Genesis) Ahura - Mazda had created the most superior things. Thus the six creations in the Hebrew version h ave been v i sibly cond ensed into six periods of tim e, and there is but one period for religious observance on the seventh d ay! And whereas the Persians, o r Parsees, hold their six festivals and p eriods of rest in on e whole year, we have fifty - two Sabbaths, which shows the latest rendering, as well as the development of the same mythos. The Hebrew Elohim rested on the seventh d ay, whereas the Persian Ahura - Mazda rested for five days at a tim e a fter eac h o f the six creations. Further, the six seasons or periods of creati on h ad b een reduced from t he ea rlier Babylonian v ersion, in which the seventh d ay was not a Sabbath, bu t the period in which the Anim als and Man were c reated. We a re a lso told in the Bund ahish -- \"It says in Revelation that before the c omi ng of the Destroye r vegetation h ad no thorns upon it or bark abou t it; and afterwards, when the Destroyer came, it was created with b ark, and things grew thorny!\" And in the Avesta, an older scripture, this destroyer, the e vil oppon ent, is a serpent -- as it i s in the book o f Genesis. It is too late now to advance the c laim , o r assume that the Persians, the Babylonians, and the Egyptians borrowed their versions from t hat given b y the inspired writer of the Hebrew Pentateuch. And these facts, I submit , furnish sufficient eviden ce that the Book of Genesis does not contain an o riginal revelation made by God to the Jews; in short, it does not contain any revelation at all. We a re c ompelled to seek elsewhere before we ca n really und erstand what it does contain! The Six Creations, Cr eative Acts, o r Periods are Persian; but the Legends in Genesis have been d erived from m ore than on e source. Of late years a mi ghty fuss has been made a bou t the fact that two d ifferent systems, kno wn as the Elohistic a nd Jahvistic, h ave been im perfectly bl ended and u tili zed in the Hebrew version o f the Genesis, bu t with no application o f the c omparative process to the various s ystems of creations, acc ording to mythology, and with no clue whatever to the natural phenomena in which the mythology was found ed, or to the gnosis by which the myths were a nciently interpreted. According to the Persian reckon ing, the human creature was formed as the sixth creation, or, as the Hebrew version h as it, on the sixth d ay; whereas in the version o f the Seventy man was creat ed on the e ighth d ay. Now, if we look closely at t he first chapter of Genesis, we shall find bo th these reckon ings combined, bu t not blended. Althou gh there"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"are no more than six days of creation mentioned in the Hebrew G enesis, there a re e ight distinct act s of creation o r utterances of the Word.

According to the Gnostics, who h ad p reserved the only true kno wledge of these mythical m atters, man, as the e ig hth creation, b elongs to the mystery of the Ogdoad. Iren√¶us tells us how the Gnostics maintained that m an was formed on the eighth d ay of creation: \"Sometim es they say he was made on the sixth, and at others on the e ighth d ay.\" (B. 1, C. 18, 2 ) These two creations of man on the sixth d ay and on the e ighth were those of the Adami c or fleshly man and o f the spiritual m an, who were kno wn to Paul and the Gnostics as the first and second Adam, the man o f earth and the man from heaven. Iren√¶us also says they ins isted that Moses began with the Ogdoad o f the Seven Powers and their Mother, who is called Soph ia (the old Kefa of Egypt, who is the \"Living Word\" at Ombos). Thus we find the two systems are run into eac h o ther, and left withou t the means of distinguishing the one from t he other, o r of kno wing how they had either of them originated. So that, instead o f a revelation o f the beginning in the Hebrew G enesis, we have to go far beyond it t o find any beginning whatever. So it i s with the Fall. Here, as before, the Genesis does not begin at the beginning. There was an earlier Fall t han that of the Prim al Pair. In this, the number of those who failed and fell was s even. We meet with these Seven in Egypt -- (Eight with the Mother) -- where they are ca lled the \"Children o f Inertness,\" who were ca st out from \"Am - Smen,\" the Paradise of the Eight; also, in a Babylonian legend o f creation, as the Seven Brethren, who were Seven Kings; li ke the Seven Kings in the Book o f Revelation; and the Seven Non - Sentient Powers, who b eca me t he Seven Rebel Angels that m ade war in Heaven."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Seven Kronid√¶, d escribed as the Seven Watchers, who, in the beginning, were formed in the interior of heaven.

It says that in the beginning the Elohim created the heaven and the ea rth. In thou sands of book s the Elohim have been d iscussed, bu t with no application o f the c omparative process to this and the earlier mythologies, and therefore with no conclusive result. Our bibliolators were too conceited in their insular ignorance to think there wa s any thing worth kno wing outside of their own Book s. Foolishly fancying they had gotten a revelation all t o themselves, a supernatural version o f the c osmi cal Genesis, they did no t care to seek for, d id no t dream of, a natural or scientific Genesis, and c ould no t m ake out the mythical; consequently they have never kno wn what it was they were ca lled upon to worship in the name of God. In h is paper on the Evolution o f Theology, Professor Huxley assumes that the Elohim of Genesis originated as the ghosts of a ncestors, in do ing which h e no more plumbs to the bottom t han do es M r. Gladstone. The Elohim are Seven in nu mber, whether as nature powers, gods of constellations, o r planetary gods. Whereas the human ghosts are not, and never were, a septenary, althou gh t hey may be, and h ave been, confused with the typical seven as the Pitris and Patriarchs, Manus and Fathers of earlier tim es. The Gnostics, however, and the Jewish Kabalah p reserve a n acc oun t of the Elohim of Genesis by which we a re a ble to identify them wi th o ther forms of the seven p rim ordial powers. They are the c hildren o f the a ncient Mother called Soph ia. Their names are Ialdabaoth, Jehov ah (or Iao), Sabaoth, Adon ai, Eloeus, Oreus and Astanph √¶us. Ialdabaoth signifies the Lord God of the fathers; that is the fathers who p rece ded the Father; and thus the Seven are identical with the Seven Pitris or Fathers in India. (Iren√¶us B.1, 30, 5. ) Moreover, the Hebrew Elohim were pre - extant by name a nd n ature a s Ph≈ìnician d ivinities or powers. Sanchon iathon mentions them by name, and d escribes them as the Auxiliaries of Kronu s or Tim e. In this phase, then, the Elohim are tim ekeepers in h eaven! In the Ph≈ìnician Mythology the Elohim are the Seven sons of Sydik, identical with the Seven Kabiri, who in Egypt are the Seve n sons of Ptah, and the Seven spirits of Ra in the Book o f the Dead; in Britain, with the Seven Companions of Arthur in the Ark; in Polynesia, with the Seven dwarf sons of Pinga; in America, with the Seven Hohgates; in India, with the Seven Rishis; in Pers ia, with the Seven Amchaspands; in Assyria, with the Seven Lumazi."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"They had on e c omm on genesis in ph enomena, as I have trace d them by number, b y nature, and b y name; and also on e c omm on Kamit e origin.

The Egyptian Ali or Ari, gives us the root m eaning; t he Ari are the companions, guardians and watchers, who turn round together. Hence the Aluheim or Elohim . They are a lso the Ili or gods, in Assyrian, who were seven in nu mber! Eight with the Mother in the beginning, o r the Manifestor in the e nd. In their prim ordial phase they were seven elementary powers, warring in chaos, lawless and tim eless. They were first born o f the Mother in sp ace ; and then the Seven Companions passed into the sphere of tim e, as auxiliaries of Kronu s, o r Sons of the Male Parent. As Damascius s ays, in h is \"Primiti ve Principles,\" the Magi consider that space a nd tim e were the source of all; and from being powers o f the a ir, the gods were promoted to b ecome tim ekeepers for man. Seven constellations were a ssigned to them, and so they could b e ca lled the a uxiliaries of Kronu s, when time was established. As the seven turned round in the a rk o f the sphere they were desi gnated the Seven Sailors, Companions, Rishis, o r Elohim . The first \"Seven Stars\" are not planetary. They are the leading stars of seven constellations, which turned round with the Great Bear in d escribing the c ircle of a year. These the Assyrians called th e seven Lumazi, o r leaders of the flocks of stars, d esignated sheep. On the Hebrew line of descent or development, these Elohim are identified for us by the Kabalists and Gnostics, who retained the hidden wisdom or gnosis, the c lue of which is absolutely e ssential t o any proper und erstanding of mythology or theology. The c reation o f the Elohim as auxiliaries of Kronu s was not world - making at all i n ou r sense. The myth - makers were not geologists, and d id no t pretend to b e. The c haos which p rece ded Creation w as s im ply that of tim elessness, and o f the unintellectual and non - sentient Nature - Powers. Creation p roper began with the first m eans of measuring and recording a cycle of tim e. Thus the prim ary creation in the Genesis, as in the Bund ahish, is the creation of tim e, in which the morning and evening measured on e day. But the Seven Cronies, as we may now call t hem, were found to b e telling tim e somewhat vaguely by the year, in acc ordance with the a nnu al revolution o f the starry sphere; and, being found inexact and un faithful to their trust, they were dispossessed and superseded -- or, as it was fabled, they fell from heaven. The Seven were then succee ded b y a Polar Pair and a Lunar Trinity of Tim e - keepers. For example, it has been ob served that there was a fixed c entre, which was a pivot to the Starry Vast all t urning round. Here there were two constellations with seven stars in eac h. We call t hem t he Two Bears. But the seven stars of the Lesser Bear were once c onsidered to b e the seven h eads of the Polar Dragon, w hich we meet with -- as the beast with seven h eads -- in the Akkadian Hymns and in the Book o f Revelation. The mythical dragon o riginated in the c rocodile, which is the Dragon o f Egypt. Plutarch tells us the Egyptians s aid the c rocodile was the sole a nim al liv ing in water which h as his eyesight covered ov er with a film , so thin that he ca n see withou t him self being seen b y others -- \"in which h e a grees with the first god. \" Now, in one particular cult, the Sut - Typhon ian, the first god was Sevekh, who wears the cro codile's head, as well as the serpent, and who is the Dragon, o r whose c onstellation was the Dragon."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The name of Sevekh signifies the sevenfold; hence the seven h eads of the Dragon, the Dragon who is of the seven and \"is him self also an eighth,\" as we a re told in Revelation. In h im t he Seven Powers were unified, as they were in Ea, Iao - Chnub is, and v arious other of the c hief gods who summ ed up the ea rlier powers in the supreme one , when un ity was attained at l ast. For it i s certain that no on e god was ever made kno wn to man b y primiti ve revelation. The only starting - point was in external phenomena, which assuredly manifested no on eness in p ersonality. The group o f Totemi c brotherhood p rece ded the fatherhood, and finally the fatherhood superseded the Totemi c group in h eaven, as it was on earth. One form of this god was Sut - Nub, and Nub means the golden. Thus the reign of Sut was that age of gold afterwards assigned to Saturn b y the Greeks. In Egypt the Great Bear was the c onstellation o f Typhon, o r Kepha , the old genetrix, called the Mother of the Revolutions; and the Dragon with seven h eads was assigned to h er son Sevekh - Kronu s, o r Saturn, called the Dragon o f Life. That is, the typical dragon o r serpent with seven h eads was female a t first, and then the type was continued as male in h er son Sevekh, the Sevenfold Serpent, in Ea the Sevenfold, in Num - Ra, in the Seven - headed Serpent, Iao - Chnub is, and o thers. We find these two in the book o f Revelation. One is the Scarlet Lady, the mother of mystery, the great har lot, who sat on a scarlet - coloured b east with seven h eads, which is the Red Dragon o f the Pole. She held in h er hand the unclean things of her fornication. That m eans the e mblems of the male a nd female, im aged b y the Egyptians at the Polar centre, the very uterus of creation as was indicated b y the Thigh constellation, called the Khepsh o f Typhon, the old d ragon, in the northern b irthplace of Tim e in h eaven. The two revolved abou t the pole of heaven , o r the Tree, as it was called, which was figured at the c entre of the starry motion. In the book o f Enoch these two constellations are identified as Leviathan and Behemoth = Bekhmut, o r the Dragon and Hippopo tamus = Great Bear, and they are the prim al pair that was first created in the garden o f Eden. So that th e Egyptian first m other, Kefa, whose name signifies mystery, was the original of the Hebrew Chavah, ou r Eve ; and therefore Adam i s one with Sevekh, the sevenfold on e, the solar dragon, in whom t he powers of light and d arkness were combined, and the sevenfo ld n ature was s hown in seven rays worn b y the Gnostic Iao - Chnub is, god o f the number seven, who is Sevekh b y name a nd a form of the first father as head o f the seven. Another bit of evidence here may be a ddu ced from t he Rabbinical legends relating to Adam' s first wife. Her name was Lilit h , and Lilit h = Rerit, is that Egyptian godd ess whose c onstellation was the Great Bear. Thus Adam and Eve a re identified at last with the Greater and Lesser Bears, and the mythical Tree of Knowledge with the ce lestial Northe rn Pole. The Hebrew A dam can b e likewise shown to h ave been a form of the c hief one of the ea rlier seven who fell from heaven. Not only is he the head of the first group o f Patriarchs turned into h istorical characters in the Genesis, who are seven in nu mbe r, p rece ding the ten, bu t also learn that, in the mysteries of Samothrace , the name of Adam was given to the first and chief one of the Seven Kabiri, who were a form of the ea rliest Seven tim e - keepers, that failed and fell from heaven! Moreover, the Gnosti cs identify these prim ary seven b y nature a nd b y name a s the Seven Mund ane D√¶mons who always oppo se a nd resist the human race , b eca use it was on their acc oun t that the father among the seven was cast down to a lower world! -- not to the ea rth. One name of th is father is Ialdabaoth. Adam i s another name of the same mythical personage, and Adam at Samothrace was chief of the Seven. Adam, as the father among the Seven, is identical with the Egyptian Atum, who was the father - god in h is first sovereignty, and"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"whos e other name of Adon is identical with the Hebrew A don ai. In this way the second creation in Genesis reflects and continues the later creation in the mythos, which explains it. The Fall of Adam t o the lower world led to h is being humanized on earth, b y whi ch process the ce lestial was turned into the mortal, and this, which b elongs to the astrono mi cal allegory, got lit eralised as the fall of Man, o r descent of the soul into matter, and the c onv ersion o f the a ngelic into an earthly being. The Roman Church h as always held that m ankind were c reated in consequence of the fall of the rebel angels who raised a revolt i n h eaven, which was s im ply a survival of the Mythos, as it i s found in the texts when Ea, the first father, is s aid to \"grant forgiveness to the c ons piring g ods,\" for whose \"redemption d id h e c reate mankind\" (Sayce, Hib. Lect. 140 ). The subject m atter is celestial solely, and solely celestial beca use it was astrono mi cal. The Fall was not to the earth, no r on the ea rth, bu t to a lower heaven, called the Adamah in Genesis; nor did Adam and Eve become human realiti es below beca use they were outcast gods of constellations that were superseded abov e. The matter is mythical, and I am t rying to show, as the result of wide research, what i s the meaning of that which we ca ll \"mythical,\" by tracing the physical origin o f the a ncient gods, the Hebrew included, to natural phenomena, in acc ordance with d ata a nd d etermi natives s till extant. As nothing was kno wn concerning the Genesis and n ature of the Elohim , it has a lways been a moot question as to whom t he speakers addressed the speec h, \"Let us make man in our im age!\" It has comm only been assumed that the \"us\" denoted a plural of dignity like the \"we\" of Royalty and Editorship. But it i s not so. The Elohim are the Eg yptian, Akkadian, Hebrew, and Ph≈ìnician form of the universal Seven Powers, who are Seven in Egypt, Seven in Akkad, Babylon, Persia, India, Britain, and Seven amongst the Gnostics and Kabalists. They were the Seven fathers who p rece ded the father in h eaven , b eca use they were ea rlier than the individualized fatherhood on earth. Mythology reflects the primiti ve sociology, as in a mi rror, and we c ould no t comprehend the reflection in the divine dynasties abov e until we knew something fund amental abou t t he huma n relationships on the ea rth b eneath. The field o f Babylonian Mythology is one vast battle - ground b etween the ea rly Motherhood and the later Fatherhood -- that is, the Mother in space , in the stellar and lunar characters oppo sed to the later and solar Fathe rhood, which b eca me more e specially Semit e; i ndeed, where the Akkadians wrote the \"female a nd the male,\" the Semit e translators prepensely reverse it, and render it by the \"male a nd the female.\" This s etting up o f the supreme God as s olely Male, to the e xc lusion o f the female, h as often b een erroneously attributed to a suppo sed \"Mono theistic Instinct\" originating with the Semit es! In Egypt the solar Fatherhood h ad b een attained in the sovereignty of Atum - Ra, when the records begin; but this s ame battle went on all t hrough h er monu mental history, more fiercely when the Heretics, the Motherites, the Blackheads, were now and again reinforced b y allies from withou t. When the Elohim said, \"Let us make man in ou r im age, after our likeness,\" there were seven o f th em who represented the seven elements, po wers, o r souls that went to the making of the human b eing who came into existence before the Creator was represented anthropo morphically, o r could h ave c onferred the human likeness on the Adami c man.

The seven Gnostic Elohim t ried to make a man in their own im age, bu t could no t, f rom l ack o f virile power. Thus, their creation in earth and h eaven was a failure. The Gnostics identify these seven as the Hebrew Elohim who exhorted eac h other, saying, \"Let us make man after our im age a nd likeness.\" They did so; but the man whom t hey mad e was a failure, b eca use they themselves were lacking in the soul of the fatherhood ! When the Gnostic Ialdabaoth, chief of the Seven cried, \"I am t he father and God, \" his mother Soph ia replied, \"Do no t t ell li es, Ialdabaoth, for the first m an (Anthropo s So n o f Anthropo s) is abov e thee!\" That is, man who h ad no w been created in the im age of the fatherhood, was s uperior to the gods who were derived from t he mother parent alone! For, as it had b een at first on earth, so was it afterwards in h eaven; and thus th e prim ary gods were held to b e soulless, like the ea rliest race s of men b eca use they had not attained the soul of the individualized fatherhood. The Gnostics taught that the spirits of wickedness, the inferior Seven, d erived their origin from t he great m ot her alone, who produ ced withou t fatherhood ! It was in the im age, then, o f the sevenfold Elohim t hat the seven race s were formed which we sometim es hear of as the pre - Adamit e race s of men, beca use they were ea rlier than the fatherhood which was individualiz ed on ly in the second Hebrew creation. These were the primiti ve people of the past, -- the old, d espised, dark race s of the world, -- who were held to h ave been created withou t souls, b ecause they were born b efore the fatherhood was individua lized on earth o r in h eaven; for, there could b e no God the Father r ecognized un til t he human father had b een identified -- nothing more than the general ancestral soul of the fathers, o r the soul of the seven elemental forces. These ea rly race s were first represented b y Tote mi c zo√∂types, and were afterwards abomi nated as the dog - men, monk ey - men, men with tails, mere prelimi nary people, created in the likeness of anim als, reptiles, fish, o r birds. Warriors with the bod y of a bird o f the valley (?), and men with the face s of r a vens, were suckled b y the old dragon Tiamat; and their type may be seen in the im age of the twin Sut - Horus, who h as the head o f a bird o f light in front, and the Neh, o r black vu lture of darkness, b ehind. Ptah and h is Seven Khnemm u are the Pygmi es. As the black race was first on earth, so is it i n the mi rror of mythology. These a re the \"people of the black h eads,\" who are referred to on the tablets, and classed with reptiles, during a lunar eclipse. These typical black h eads were the prim eval powers of dark ness, to which the old b lack aborigines in v arious lands were likened o r assimil ated b y their despisers. In the Babylonian p rayers we find the many - named mother - godd ess is invok ed as \"the mother who h as begotten the black h eads.\" These a t tim es were intent ionally confused and confound ed with their elemental prototypes. Seven such race s are described in the Bund ahish, o r aboriginal creation, as the ea rth - men, the men o f the water, the breast - eared, the breast - eyed, the one - legged, the bat - men, and the men wi th tails. These were the soulless people. They are a lso referred to b y Esdras as the other people who are nothing, \"but be like unto spittl e\" -- that is, when compared with those who d escended from t he father, as Adam, o r Atum, on earth, and who worshipped a father, as Atum, o r Jehov ah, in h eaven. There were seven creations altogether; seven h eavens, which were planetary in their final phase, seven creators, and seven race s of men. And when the one God h ad b een evolved h e was place d at the head o f the Seven. Hence Ptah in Egypt was"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"called the Father of the fathers, who in India a re kno wn as the Seven Pitris.

The c hief of the Seven Ali = Elohim as s upreme one of the group b eca me th e Semiti c Al or El, d esignated the highest god, who was the seventh as Saturn; so that El and Jehov ah - Elohim are identical in their phenomenal origin, whilst El - Shadai is the same son o f the old suckler who was Typhon in Egypt and Tiamat in Assyria. Whe n in the second creation, and in the second chapter of Genesis, Jehov ah - Elohim forms man from t he dust of the ground, and woman from t he bon e of man, Jehov ah is that one God who sums up in h im self the seven p revious powers, p recisely as they were totalled in Atum - Ra, Sevekh - Ra, Agni, o r Ahuramazda. He has been identified for us by name a s one of the seven Gnostic Elohim , their Iao, o r Jehov ah. This God appears by name in the second chapter of the Book o f Genesis, and yet in v erse 26 o f chapter iv, it i s sta ted that \"then b egan men to call upon the name of Jehov ah.\" And again the same God, apparently, is announ ced b y name in Exodu s vi. 3, where he a ffirms that he has not been kno wn p reviously by the name of Jah o r Jehov ah. But the difference between Jehov ah - E lohim and Jah o r Iao is a fact which can on ly be determi ned b y a kno wledge of the phenomena. The Jewish Kabalah and Gnosticism have never yet been grappled with o r discussed in relation to mythology and the rootage in n ature. The subject has only been nibb led at i n a littl e grazing, with a go - as - you - please, modern interpretation o f the doctrines concerning spirit and matter. The seven - fold on e God is the same in o rigin, whether kno wn b y name a s Jehov ah, Iao - Sabaoth, Sevekh the seven - fold, Ea the fish with s even fins, Ra with seven souls, Agni with seven arms, the Gnostic Chnub is or Heptaktis with seven rays, El of the Seventh Planet, or the Dragon with seven h eads. But there is another Jah o r Iao, who is the lunar divinity, and who was that Duad o f the mothe r and child which b ecomes a Triad as the c hild grows into the c onsort for the same mother. It is more a ncient than the divine Fatherhood, and p rece ded the luni - solar trinity of father, mother and son. This was the Moon - God who rode on the heavens by the na me of Jah! and in this phase the zo√∂ - types were superseded b y the human likeness, and the God was im aged as one in the three - fold hu man character, when tim e was reckon ed b y the mother - moon, the c hild - moon and the virile new moon. The human famil y exalted t o heaven as the divine father, mother and child followed the recognition o f the personal fatherhood in sociology, and the kno wledge that the lunar light was derived from t he sun. Just as this institution superseded the mother and the brotherhood o f the Tot emi c stage on earth, so was it i n h eaven. In eac h ph ase the human sociology is reflected in the mi rror of mythology. One Jewish sign o f this trinity, given b y Bochart, is a c ircle c ontaining three yod letters, the numerical value of which is 30 -- or ten d ay s to eac h o f three phases of the Moon. Another of the lunar types is the Ass -- the three - legged ass of the Bund ahish. In the Egyptian h ieroglyphics the head o f the a ss is a sign for No. 30 on the same ground ; and on acc oun t of such typology the Jews were c h arged with b eing worshippers of an ass. Thus the Elohim were the Seven Powers -- elemental, p re - planetary or planetary; Jehov ah - Elohim was the sevenfold on e a s s upreme a mongst the planetary Gods, and Jah is the three - fold lunar Deity, the trinity in un ity -- i n the likeness of the human famil y; these were a gain combined in a totality that is ten - fold in the divine fatherhood.

Mr. Gl adstone's last and most pathetic plea -- pitiful as a flag of distress fluttering at the mast - head o f a doo med v essel visibly going down -- is that the tale in Genesis is beautiful if not true! He says -- \"If we view it as a popu lar narrative it i s s ingularly vi vid, forcible, and effective; if we take it as a poem it i s indeed sublim e!\" But the question is -- Is it false or true? Have we been d eluded, mi sled, and cheated? The e ssence of poetry even must be truth, and no t falsehood, ho wever attractive; m ust not mi sl ead u s on the pretext of being a revelation. The older I grow the faster I am l osing my faith in all l ovely unrealiti es. Consider the e ffects of such false teac hing! Only the other day a c hild who h ad b een taught that God made man ou t of the dust of the ea rth was watching an eddying cloud o f dust being whirled into shape by the wind, when she c ried, \"Oh, mother, come here! Look ! I think God is creating another baby!\" Our mental standpo int has been made quite as childish with regard to o ther Beginnings. And from every pulpit of the past we have been im plored to remain as littl e c hildren at the mother's knee. We have been taught and compelled to surrender our reason, do ff our manhood and grovel li ke worms in the ea rth as the succe ssful m ode of wriggling our wa y through this world into h eaven. We have been robb ed b y a thief in the night. Children h ave been cheated ou t of their natural senses, and the mental emasculation o f men h as taken the place of the physical once inculcated b y the Christ (Math. xix. 12 ). Men who are sane on most other subjects will give up all comm on sense on this, and talk like intellectual lunatics. See how the teac hers of the people, who ou ght to h ave learned b etter f or themselves, continue a ll t heir life through to wear the ca st - off vestm ents of ancient m ythology. Take Mr. Ruskin as another typical example. He is in many ways a most diligent searcher after truth, and a worshipper of all t hings nob le a nd b eautiful. But he was s o p rofound ly infected b y the falsehood made religious to h im i n childhood as to b e marked b y it and mentally maim ed for life. In h is \"Modern Painters,\" he tells us that \"man p erished in seeking kno wledge,\" and \"there is not any part of our nature, no r can there be through eternity, un influenced o r unaffected b y the fal l.\" 'Tis most painful to see such a man, so"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"human at heart, such a seer and lover of all l oveliness believing so d amnable a lie, and endo rsing it not only for his own lifetim e, bu t for so long as his writings may last, beca use it was told to h im i n h is own confiding childhood.

SAY CE. ____ As an oppon ent of what m ay be termed the Aryan schoo l of interpretation it has been my special work to show that m ythology is not a farrago o f f oolish fables, no r the mere raving of words that have lost their senses. I have a mply demonstrated the fact that the myths were no mere produ cts of ancient ignorance, bu t are the deposited results of a primiti ve kno wledge; that they were found ed upon n atural phenomena a nd remain the register of the ea rliest scientific observation. Those, ho wever, who h ave not yet learned that m ythology contains the gnosis of the ea rliest science, and is the great pre - historic record, are unable to teac h u s anyt hing fund amental concerning it. They canno t read the record itself or verify it by continual reference to those natural phenomena on which it i s based, and b y which the truth o f the interpretation h as to b e verified and tested. Withou t this foothold o f fac t being firml y established mythology resolves itself into a bog withou t a bottom. It appears to me that Professor Sayce in h is lectures on the Babylonian Religions, is frequently dealing with matters which can on ly be fathomed b y the c omparative process, and that it i s mi sleading to compare the a ncient m ythologies with the Egyptian o mitt ed, whereas he rigorously rejects any light from t hat source. No Mythological Religion can be e xplained b y itself alone. The c omparative method is as the bringing together of flint and steel to strike the first spark for the nece ssary light. Withou t question o r inqu iry; withou t collecting and comparing the data; withou t presenting his evidence for the assertion, h e makes the following authoritative declaration. \"Apart from t he general analogies which we find in all early civilizations, the Script, the Theology and the Astrono my of Egypt and Babylonia show no v estiges of a c omm on source.\" (Hib. Lect. p. 136. ) There may be a pitfall i ntended in these delusive words as the mytho logy and so - called cosmology are e ntirely omitt ed. But you canno t have the Astrono my apart from t he Mythology by which it was represented! The Prof. says further there is one c onclusive and fatal objection to the derivation from Egypt \"inasmuch as there is no tracea ble conn ection b etween the hieroglyphics of Egypt and the primiti ve pictures out of which the c uneiform characters were developed.\" Professor Sayce is an expert and an authority passably orthodo x, whose word will be taken for gospel by those who are not qualified to question it. I am not an ackno wledged authority. I can on ly plead that m y facts may have a hearing. Withou t kno wing the facts we ca nno t attain the truth, and short of the fullest truth there is no final authority. The Egyptian h ierogly phics were developed ou t of the same primiti ve pictures and n atural objects as the Akkadian. Both were direct transcripts from nature a t first, and there is but one origin in n ature for the ea rliest figures. Again h e says: \"If Lepsius were right (in mainta ining the oppo site view) the primiti ve hieroglyphics out of which the c uneiform characters were e volved would o ffer resemblances to the hieroglyphics. But this is not the ca se. Even the idea of divinity is"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"represented d ifferently in them. In Chaldea it i s expressed b y an eight - rayed star; i n Egypt, by a stone - headed axe\" (p. 435 ). That is true; and yet in the sole illustration addu ced b y him t he Professor is wrong! The evidence of the first witness called is against the truth o f his vaguely vast generaliza tion. The star with the e ight rays is likewise a n Egyptian ideograph o f divinity; it i s a numerical figure for the Nunu o r Associate Gods. (Burton E.H. 34. ) This is the sign o f the pleroma of the godh ead, the divine ogdoad. It was continued as a symbol of Horus - Orion, the manifestor of the Eight, the mumm y - constellation o f the only one who rose a gain! The e ight - rayed sign was also a symbol of Hathor and o f Taht beca use, like the e ight - rayed o r eight - loop ed star, it was the numerical figure of the e ight gods , h ence it was the sign o f the Abod e a s Hathor, and the manifestor as Taht - Smen; as it i s of Ishtar and o f Assur. The Egyptians not only used this octave of divinity, they also give us the reason for using it. This numerical sign o f the prim ary group o f ei ght gods was not continued as the symbol of abstract divinity, and it i s rare, bu t still it exists to refute the Professor, who has to p lumb far more profound ly before he touches bottom. The five - rayed star, Seb, is likewise the hieroglyphic symbol for a g od o r divinity, so that the Professor's s uggested inference is false twice over. It will never do to p resume too much on the c omm on ignorance c oncerning the buried p ast of Egypt, the rootage out of r ange, and the long development of the original ideographs . For example, the Egyptian p ictograph o f a soul is a human - headed b ird, and that type is continued when the Babylonian d ead are described as being clad like birds in a garment of f eathers. Notwithstanding Mr. Sayce's offhand dicta it will be seen in the f uture that Egypt was as truly the parent of hieroglyphics as s he is of alphabets! But to show the Professor's determi nation to avoid Egypt: after pointing to the fact that the statues from Telloh b ear a great li keness to the Egyptian in the tim e of the pyr ami d bu ilders; and after admitti ng that the Egyptian art of sculpture was infinitely superior to the Babylonian at that tim e, -- he quietly supp resses Egypt altogether on b ehalf of an entirely unkno wn \"schoo l of sculpture in the Sinaitic peninsula!\" (P. 138. ) Anything rather than look Egypt hon estly in the face ! The Professor is s o anxious to hu stle unacce ptable facts out of sight and get rid o f their testim ony, h e a sserts that the e xistence of a \"Cushite race \" in Chaldea solely depends on a mi sinterpretation and a probable c orruption o f the text in the Book o f Genesis. But Cush is the black. The Cushites were the Black race ; and the a borigines of Babylonia were the Black men o f the monu ments, the \"black - heads\" of the Akkadian Texts. Hence the god Kus, their d eity of eclipse a nd d arkness. The Professor is all hind - before with regard (or disregard) to the origins in the black land, the prim eval birthplace . He is not yet out of the Ark o f the Semiti c or the shadow of the Aryan b eginnings, which h ave so d arkened a nd deluded u s; and h as to advance backwards a good d eal further beyond the Altaic bound aries. As I have a lready shown in the \"Natural Genesis,\" the beginnings of mythology in Egypt and Akkad are definitely identical. The Old Dragon o f Chaos and the Abyss i s the same whether called Tiamat, Tavthe, o r Typhon. By Typhon I mean the beast that im aged the first Great Mother, h ippopo tamus in front and crocodile behind, who therefore is the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Dragon o f Egypt. Her name of Tep, Teb, o r Tept i s the original of Typhon. T iamat=Tavthe represents that abyss of the beginning which is the Egyptian Tepht. This Tepht is the a byss, the source, the void, the hole of the snake, the habitat of the dragon, the outrance or uterus of birth as place which p rece ded p ersonification. Anoth er name for the a byss is Abzu, the ea rlier form of which is the Egyptian Khepsh in the north -- that is, the Pool of Khep, the hippopo tamus or Typhon =Dragon. Tept and Tavthe a re one, the water - horse a nd d ragon - horse a re one. In bo th forms they give birth to the well - kno wn seven p rim al powers, elemental energies, o r demons of physical force, first recognised as warring in chaos, who were a fterwards cast out and superseded, o r moralised as the seven wicked spirits. When the prim ary powers become the seven evil spirits, it i s s aid o f them, \"They are not kno wn among the sentient gods.\" So in Egypt t he same seven were denoun ced as the non - sentient \"Children o f inertness.\" And just as the Akkadian seven were c ontinued and made the messengers and mi nisters of wrath t o the supreme God, Anu, so d id the Egyptian seven survive a s the seven great spirits in the service of Ra; their station b eing in the region o f the Great Bear, the c onstellation o f their mother. (Rit., ch. 17. ) This mother - godd ess first brought forth in sp ace a nd n ext in tim e. If we take the star of evening and morning as the type of the ea rliest tim e, then the mother Tiamat passes into Ishtar, godd ess of the e vening and the morning star. The dragon Tiamat was called the Bis - Bis, identified b y George Smit h with the c rocodile a s the symbol of Egypt; and Ishtar=Venus, the \"Lady of Dawn,\" was called Bis - bisi, which shows the survival of the same genetrix in h er change of character out of space into tim e. Another proof of this continuity by transformation is fur nished when Ishtar as Queen o f Heaven (so rendered by Mr. Sayce) called h erself the \"Unique Monster\" (p. 267. ) Precisely in the same way do we see the Typhon ian genetrix Ta - Urt in Egypt pass into Hes - ta - Urt (whence Hestaroth or Ashtaroth) and Hathor, when the domesticated cow succee ded the water - cow as the Zo√∂type of Hes, As (Isis), o r of Hathor, the Lunar form of the Godd ess of Love, in whose person the beast was transfigured into the beauty. According to ancient tradition, the c ulture of Chaldea was broug ht to that coun try by a Fish - Man, who rose up in \"the first year,\" from t hat part of the Red o r \"Erythr√¶an Sea which bo rders upon Babylonia.\" The original of this type ca n b e identified in Ea the fish - god, d eity of the hou se of the deep and d ivinity of wis dom. Whence ca me Ea, then, b y the Red Sea? Lepsius s ays from Egypt -- so says Egypt herself. Professor Sayce had p reviously denied ou r r ight to compare the myths of two d ifferent nations before their r elationships have been established b y language, and that by gramm ar ( which is late), in p reference to the vocabulary. Thus mythology is put out of court, and words are to b e acc oun ted o f no weight. Still , it i s well t o remember that the Professor has before now taken h is s tand on a false bottom t hat was found to b e crumbling und er foot day by day! It is at least suggestive to find that the name a nd n ature of Ea, the oldest Akkadian form of the One God, may be so fully explained b y the Egyptian U√¢ (later Ea ) f or the one, the one a lone, isolated as the only one; al so the Thinker and the Captain o f the Boat. It shou ld b e premi sed that the Egyptian U prece ded the letter or sound o f E, h ence Ua=Ea. The Egyptian Ua, which p assed into Ea, also"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"appears in the Akkadian Ua for the Supreme One, the sole Lord o r Chief. In on e form Ea is the fish - god, and the hieroglyphic sign for Ua=Ea is fishing - tackle! Ea was the deity of the deep, and Ua=Ea is Boat and Captain bo th. Of course the fish was the ea rlier im age, but the Egyptians had gone far ahead in substituting the work o f th eir own h ands for the primiti ve natural types. Ea is the wise god, the thinker and instructor; and Uaua (Eg.) means to think, consider, meditate. Ea's prototype in the indefinitely earlier mythology of Egypt is Num=Kneph, whose twofold n ature is indicated by the two ways of spelling one name. As Num he is Lord o f the inund ation; as Kneph h e is the Breath o f those who are in the firmament. Nef signifies breath, and is also the name of the sailor. Ea is god o f the watercourse a nd the a tm osphere. Ea was the An telope of the deep; Num was the bearded He - goat; t he Sea - goat of the Zodiac. One type of Num i s the serpent; as it i s of Ea. Ea is said to represent the House, which is √¢ in Egyptian. In a ca se of this kind Professor Sayce can on ly perceive or will only ad mit a \"general analogy.\" Egyptian also o ffers the likeliest original for the name of Oan o r Oannes, the Greek form of Ea, the fish, seeing that Ua=Oa, and that An is the fish in Egyptian; whilst An, to appear, to show, is determi ned b y the fish in the wate r - precinct, where the fish is the revealer who emerged from t he waters as Ea - an, o r Oannes. (Denkm√§ler 3, 46 C.) If the original Fish - Man came from Egypt, it would p robably be a s the Crocodile=Dragon, the Typhon ian type of both the a ncient m other and h er s on Sevekh. The c rocodile is the fish that passes the day on d ry land and the night in the waters. Its name of Sevekh is identical with that of the number seven; and Ea is conn ected with a typical fish o f seven fins (?). The c rocodile, as Plutarch tells us, was a supreme type of the one God, o r, as the name shows, o f the seven - fold po wers in on e im age. Sevekh was the same good d emon o f one Cult i n Egypt that Num - Ra was in the other, bu t indefinitely earlier. To my apprehension, the Babylonian \"House of the Seven bond s of heaven and earth,\" is identical with the \"House of the Seven Halls and Seven stairways,\" assigned to Osiris; and the God Nebo as s tellar, lunar, and p lanetary Deity; as proph et and p roclaim er, is identical with Sut - Anup (later Nub and Anub i s) in a dozen d ifferent aspects; whilst Nebo - Nusku = the doub le Anub is. Further, the same Great Mother who was Venus as Hathor beca me the mother - moon. Professor Sayce seems to think that where the moon is male it canno t also b e female. If I am right, Ishta r must also h ave had a lunar character as the Mother - Godd ess. But Professor Sayce makes the point - blank assertion that Ishtar was not a godd ess of the moon. (P. 256. ) \"The moon was conceived o f as a God, no t as a Godd ess.\" He a ssures us that Ishtar was the spirit of earth and the Godd ess of Love, the dual divinity of the planet Venus. But there is no male moon withou t the female Godd ess. It is not a question o f \"Conception, \" but of begettal. The observers were c oncerned with the lunar phases as natural fact s, the mother or reprodu cing phase being first. The mother Godd ess brought forth the Child o f light, whether as Taht, Khun su, Duzu, Tamm uz, o r Horus, and there is no lunar myth po ssible withou t the motherhood, which p rece ded the fatherhood. The c hild o f th e moon in on e phase is her consort in the other. Thus when Ishtar makes up to Izdub ar, the solar god who represents the later fatherhood, h e twits her on the subject of her child - consort, the bridegroom of her youth, whom she had so long pursued, like Venu s wooing Adon is. In the legend o f Tamm uz and Ishtar the Godd ess, in descending to the und erworld in search o f her bridegroom, p asses through seven gates. In"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"eac h o f these she is s tripped o f a part of her glory, represented as her ornaments. On h er return s he a scends through seven o ther gates, when h er ornaments are restored to h er, both b eing don e acc ording to ancient rules. These gates are the 14 lower lunar mansions in which the lunar Osiris was torn into 14 p arts by Typhon, the Power of darkness, when Is is descended in search o f her beloved. They likewise c oincide with the 14 hou ses of judgment and the 14 trials in the Egyptian Book o f the Dead, which will explain the tests and pun ishments of the Godd ess as the pre - solar type of the suffering and triumphi ng souls who h ad to win their crown o f justification in these 14 trials. Besides which on e of Ishtar's titl es is that of Godd ess Fifteen, b eca use that is the day of mi d - moon in a soli - lunar month o f 30 d ays. Professor Sayce leaves this titl e unno ticed, and then d enies that Ishtar was a godd ess of the moon ! Moreover, there is another test to b e a pplied in n atural phenomena. The Godd ess in h er Course is credited with v arious infideliti es. Not only is she c harged with h aving clung year after year to h er child - consort Tamm uz, as the Bridegroom, amongst her victim s are the Eagle (Alala) the Lion, the Horse, Tabulu the shepherd, and Isullanu, the gardener. These, as I read the Mythos, refer to certain constellations, corner - keepers or others, to b e found in the lu nar course, which canno t apply to the planet Venus or to the Spirit of the ea rth. A sign o f the lunar reckon ing may be read in the statement that Ishtar rode the horse with whip and spur for seven leagues galloping, o r during one quarter of the moon. Anoth er lunar sign may be seen in the statement that Ishtar had also torn ou t the teeth o f the Lion seven b y seven, o r for seven nights together, in h er passage through the Lion - quarter of the moon ; Eagle, Horse (Pegasus?), and Lion must probably stand for thre e of the four quarters of a lunar zodiac. Also the Errand o f Ishtar correspond s to the descent of Isis into the und erworld in search of Osiris, who was torn into 14 p arts, and Isis was the lunar Godd ess. Moreover, Ishtar robb ed h er lover, Isullanu, o f his eye, and in h is blindn ess mocked h im; j ust as Horus and Samson were eac h robb ed o f an eye. Lastly, the Bow w as lunar and Ishtar was Godd ess of the Bow. Here, as elsewhere, we a re left utterly adrift if we ca nno t secure a firm anchorage in the various natur al phenomena themselves, b y which the types of divinity must be determi ned. Professor Sayce ac kno wledges his inabilit y to acc oun t for the name of Ishtar. \"Its true e tymology was buried in the night of antiquity.\" \" It is therefore quite useless to speculate on the subject.\" (P. 257. ) And so, o f course, there is an end o f it, the last word b eing said. It is just possible, ho wever, that Egypt, from which the Professor look s religiously away, h as s omething final yet to say on these matters. Not perhaps by such interpretation as M r. Renou f's. Professor Sayce a dmit s that Ishtar appears as Esther in the Book o f Esther. Here it i s Hadassah who figures in the mythical character of Ishtar as the virgin d edicated o r betrothed du ring twelve months. Whether the typical c haracter is thus continued o r not, it i s the fact that the word \"Shtar\"* is the Egyptian n ame of the Betrothed female, and Shta denotes that which is most m ystical, secret, and ho ly, the very mother of mystery. Ishtar was the betrothed o f Tamm uz; she was c alled the \"Bridal Godd ess,\" the godd ess who was mystically betrothed to the c hild that grew up to b ecome her own Consort. She remained the Mother of Mystery. Thus Ishtar=Venus, the godd ess of love, was the Shtar or Betrothed, as the pre - mono gami c c onsort o r bride, i.e., the \"bridal godd ess,\" who is denoun ced in Revelation as the Great Harlot. Again, it appears to me that m uch o f what I have a lready said o f Horus, o f Taht, o f Khun su, Apollo, and o ther forms of the soli - lunar hero is applicable not only to Mi thras"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"but to Merodach, and to an Assyrian god called Adar (provisionally). I may claim t o h ave discovered the origin o f this particular mythical character through seeking the found ations in n atural phenomena. Adar is a solar hero who is especially related to n ight and d arkness, and yet is a deity of light. He is a warrior and champion o f the gods. He is the voice or supreme oracle of the divinities. He is the son, the messenger, the revealer of the Solar god h idden in the deep o f the und erworld. In o ther fe atures he is like Taht and Khun su, eac h o f whom i s the visible representative, the revealer, o f the sun - god b y night. Adar was designated \"Lord o f the date,\" just as Taht was called \"Lord o f the date - palm .\" Adar was likewise \"Lord o f the Pig,\" just as Khun su is the personified lord ov er the pig of Typhon in the disk o f the moon at full (Zodiac of Denderah). This is the god who, as Adon is, was s lain b y the pig or boar at one season o f the year, bu t who was victor over it in the first of the six upp er signs, which is the sign o f Pisces in the Zodiac of Denderah.‚Ä† This s ame c haracter is continued in Tamm uz, the deity who was first brought forth b y the mother alone, to b ecome her consort, the only one of a twofold n ature; and who was made the later revealer of a Father in h eaven as the c hild o f the solar god when reborn as such o f the mother - moon. The month o f Tamm uz in the Aramaic ca lendar is (roughly) our month o f June. This is the month o f Duzu in the Assyrian calendar. In the Egyptian it was the month Mesore, as June in the sacred year, the month o f the re - birth o f the river and o f the c hild Horus, who was re - born (Mes) of the river at t he re - birth o f the Inund ation. In the pre - Osirian Mythos the c hild was the representative of Tum and to b e the re - born (Mes) Tum or the c hild o f Tum, as was Iu - em - hept, the Eternal Word, would be renderable a s Tum - mus or Messu, just as Ra - messu means the c hild o f the solar god, althou gh I am not aware that Tum does appear und er that form of name, and I am suppo sing that Tamm uz w as a development from t he Egyptian Tum. For this reason! We are told in the texts‚Ä° that Tum i s the dup licate of Aten=Adon =Adon ai; and Adon = Tamm uz. Aten was the c hild - God; Tum was the father.

The Beetle is the sign o f Cancer i n the oblong Zodiac of Denderah. Professor Sayce's acc oun t of Tamm uz and Ishtar shows neither gauge nor grip o f the real subject m atter. He tells us that Adon is=Tamm uz was \"slain b y the Boar's Tusk o f Winter,\" and h is \"funeral - festival\" was held in June be cause the \"bright Sun o f the springtide was then slain and withered b y the hot blasts of summ er\" (pp. 227 - 9). But here is the true rendering as restored acc ording to the Egyptian myth, which was extant in the pre - monu mental tim es of the Shus - en - Har, who ar e c laim ed to h ave been the Rulers for 13,000 years before the tim e of Menes. The Solar God as Source of Life was re - born in natural phenomena, as his own child the Horus of Light in the Moon ; the Child o f the Lotus in the Water; the Seed as the Bread o f Li fe in the Corn. In eac h ph ase he was oppo sed b y Sut - Typhon in the form of Darkness, Drought, o r Death. Previous to the Inund ation h e was pierced b y Sut in the parching Drought. Then it was the e rrand o f Isis as of Ishtar to fetch the Water of Life. This s h e did as the Lunar Mistress of the Water. At the birth o f the River in Mesore - Tamm uz, the Moon rose a t full i n the first Lunar Water - sign, whither she had gone for the Water of Life in the und er - world -- or, astrono mi cally, entered the lowest signs. Here is one proof. Papsukal is the Regent of Capricorn, the first water - sign, and h e is the messenger that hurries off to the Sun - God (who is certainly not the dead Tamm uz!) with the news of Ishtar's arrival in search o f the Foun tain o f Life. Isis in h er search wa s acc ompanied b y Anup, h er golden do g; and in the Hermean Zodiac Anup is s tationed in the sign o f the Sea - Goat, where he is s haking the Systrum of Isis to frighten away the Typhon ian influences. -- (Plutarch.) Here is additional evidence. When the Moon rose at full i n these three signs they represented the Waters of Life to Egypt, in acc ordance with the then flowing Inund ation o f the Nile; but when the Sun itself entered the sign o f Capricorn, in winter, the passage beca me the \"Crossing o f the Waters of Death ,\" for the Solar God, o r the Souls in the Eschatological phase. Hence the typical \"Two Waters\" of the Egyptian Mythos, called the Pools of the North and South. My contention is, that the im agery thus s et in h eaven to reflect the seasons on earth was Egypti an from t he first, and that it can on ly be rightly read in the original version acc ording to tim e a nd season in Egypt. Professor Sayce makes the perplexing assertion that \"the month o f Tamm uz was called in the Akkadian Calendar 'the month o f the Errand o f Ishtar.'\" But the month Ki - Innanna (formerly read Ki - Gingir - na), the message of Nanna or Ishtar, is Ululu, two months later than Tamm uz; and the message of Ishtar, as Virgo, in August, is not to b e c onv erted into the legend o f her descent into Hades in Jun e, when the Sun was in Cancer and the full Moon was in Capricorn.

In the Egyptian mythos it was as the Sun in Scorpio that Osiris was betrayed to h is death b y Typhon. Then h is s on, Horus=Merodach, was reborn o f the Moon in the Bull, the first of the six upp er signs, to b ecome the a ven ger of his victimi sed father! Thus as heir - apparent of the Solar God, the Hero comes to the aid o f the Moon du ring an eclipse, and ov ercomes the Dragon o f Darkness. This revealer of the father - god in n atural phenomena, und er whatsoever name, is supremely i mportant as the mythical character that supp lied the type to current Christology. When the scientific fact was first discovered the doctrine of a divine trinity, consisting of f ather, mother, and child, was then established.

For example, Berossos repeats a Babylonian d escription o f nature, which h e distinctly affirms to h ave been allegorical. The professor admit s (p. 392 ) that these \"composite c reature s were really the offspring of Totemi sm\"; that is, they were symbolical Zo√∂types. And yet he ca n say of them, \"we may see (in these) a sort of anticipation o f the Darwinian h ypothesis\"! But m en with wings, two h eads, and ho rses' feet, centaurs, mermaids, a nd sphinxes, b elong to a mythical m ode of representing ideas, no t to \"im perfect, first attempts of nature,\" in acc ordance with the doctrine of development. Such confusion o f thou ght is likely to make the truth o f the matter doub ly indistinguishable. Again, he tells us that \"the god was a beast before he beca me a man,\" whereas he means that the prim ary forces recognised in n ature first were represented b y Zo√∂types before the superhuman po wers were im aged in the human likeness. He does not define what he mean s by \"worship\" or \"religion\" when h e im ports these terms into the remoter past, and thus s ets up a false standard o f judgment. Worship of the heavenly bod ies was nothing more than the look ing up to them as the tellers of tim e, even thou gh they may be ca lle d o racles! The Kronian gods were only types of tim e in a world withou t clocks and watches. He speaks of theological conceptions becomi ng mythical, whereas the mythical representation p rece ded the theological phase. He ca n \"find no trace of ancestor - worship in the ea rly literature of Chaldea\" (p. 358 ). But I doub t whether a man who resolves the D√¶mon o f Socrates into an Intuition, can kno w how or where to look for the proof. He tells us the ea rliest Babylonian religion was purely Shamanistic, on ly the spirit s it recognised were not spirits in \"our sense of the word,\" whichever sense that m ay be!

The fact of the matter is, the Christian do gmas and do ctrines began as s uch with b eing unintelligible a nd inexplicable; t hey were to remain as mysteries; and any true explanation o f them i s death to their f alse pretentions. It is my method to explode by explaining them. Take the doctrine of the Trinity for example. Can any theologian throughou t all Christendo m t o - day give us any intelligible acc oun t of its origin and prim ary meaning? Not one. For that we must go to mythology , which was earlier than ou r theology, and which alone e nables us to explain its primiti ve mysteries. The natural genesis of the Trinity was found, and is to b e refound, in lunar phenomena. The moon, in mythology and chrono logy, was a tim e - measurer of a th ree - fold n ature. At fifteen d ays of age, o r f ull - moon, it was the mother - moon. Hence Ishtar, in Akkad, is designated Godd ess 15. The lessening, waning moon was her littl e one, the c hild o f the moon, who beca me the virile one, the a dult, as the horned n ew m oon, the reprodu cer who was fabled to rebeget him self on the mother moon, and thus become his own father, as a natural mode of describing natural phenomena. These three are eternally one in external nature -- a Trinity always manifesting monthly, and the t riple a spect was humanly, o r naturally, expressed b y means of the mother, child, and reprodu cing male, which three a re a lso on e in the total human b eing. In the Christian Icono graphy, you will sometim es s ee the Virgin Mary enthroned in the new moon, with t he c hild in h er arms, and these two, with the horned o r phallic moon, constitute the Christian Trinity in Unity. Such was the primiti ve mode of thinking in things, afterwards continued in a mystical or doctrinal phase. Such, I affirm t o b e the origin of th e Trinity in mythology, which p rece ded religion; and when this is applied abstractly, to the nature of deity, o r to mi nd in n ature, b y means of metaphysic, the result i s an im position, and h e or she who p ractices im position, consciously or not, is an im pos tor. No such thing can b e kno wn as a triune or triangular God; but we a re a ble to show how such types originated. When ou r words are e xami ned, we shall frequently find that our metaphysic has been abstracted, o r f alsely filched from primiti ve physics, as w as the Trinity by Plato, which was continued b y the Christian Fathers, who tell us that but for Plato they would n ever have und erstood the doctrine of the Trinity. As with the Trinity, so it i s with the origin o f the theological Devil. The c rucial question o f the savage man, Friday, was too fund amental for the theology of Robinson Crusoe. Friday asks, \"But, if God much strong, much mi ghty as the devil, why God no k ill t he devil, and so make him no more wicked?\" Crusoe, imit ating other theologists, no t kno wi ng what t o say, \"pretended no t t o h ear him .\" (I am t old this passage has been o mitt ed from certain rece nt editions.) To give a n answer to that question we shall have to go round to work.

So many darks prece ded so many days. The dark po wer is prim arily in all t he oldest traditions and cults of the human race . Hence sacrifice was first offered to the powers of darkness. The fore - words of universal mythology are \"there was darkness.\" All was dark at first within the mi nd; and the all was the darkness that created d read withou t. The influence of night, the eclipse, and the black thund er - cloud b eing first felt, the primiti ve man v isibly emerges from t h e shadow of darkness as deeply im pressed and indelibly dyed in mi nd as was his bod y with its natural blackness. The black man withou t was negroid within, as his reflection remains in the mi rror of mythology. The darkness then, in n atural phenomena, was the original devil t hat put out the light by swallowing it i ncessantly, as the subtle enemy, the obstructor, d eluder, and general adversary of man. The first form of the Devil was female, called the Dragon o f Darkness, who was Tiamat in Akkad, and Typhon in E gypt. Typhon gave birth to Sut, who b eca me the Egyptian d evil -- our Satan -- and who was represented b y the Black jackal, the voice of Darkness; and Sut, the black on e, gives us the name of Soot, the black thing. Angro - Mainyus, the Persian d evil, was the blac k one of the two po wers of Light and Darkness. Primiti ve man, ho wever, d id no t im agine or personify a devil behind v isible phenomena, that caused the darkness. Darkness itself was the devil, and even as late a s the Parsee Bund ahish (which means the a borigi nal creation) external darkness is the devil. The seven d evils or seven h eads of the old Dragon, in the Akkadian myths of creation, are born in the moun tains of sunset, which shows the same natural genesis in ph ysical phenomena. They had their birth - place where the sun went down. At the same place , in the West, the Egyptians s tationed the Great Crocodile that swallowed do wn the lights, sun, moon, and stars, as they set eac h n ight, in its wide - open jaws of darkness. Hence the crocodile was an ideograph o f th e swallowing darkness -- and o f earth, o r the waters below, called the Abyss; and the tail of the c rocodile remained in the Egyptian hieroglyphics as the sign o f Kam -- that is, o f blackness or darkness. The c rocodile was the typical Dragon o f the waters below , the old Typhon, as the serpent was of the waters, o r overwhelmi ng darkness, abov e. Hor - Apollo tells us the Egyptians represent the mouth b y a serpent, b eca use the serpent is all m outh. This was another figure of the swallower, as the Akhekh and the Apap serpent. Akhekh signifies darkness, and Apap means that which rises up v ast and gigantic -- in short, the monster -- the typical Apap b eing based on the great African rock - snake. Here, then, is the reason why the mythical dragon and the old serpent are identic al or interchangeable in mythology, eac h b eing a representative of the devil of darkness and o f Satan, that old serpent, who im aged the e vil which was first perceived in ph ysical phenomena. Out of the darkness leapt the lightning - bolt, and in the deep wate rs lurked another subtle foe of life, and thus the jaws, the fang, and the sting of death were a ssigned to the devil of darkness, who gradually assumed the c haracter of man's mortal enemy that brought death into the world.

The origin o f Good and Evil i n the nature of man considered as a being of f lesh and spirit, as the personal embod im ent of two oppo site principles, assumed to h ave a spon taneous or automatic tendency towards good on the part of the one which is s uppo sed to o riginate in the spirit, and the other to originate in the flesh, as a natural antagonist, is tracea ble to this most primiti ve interpretation o f the duality called good and evil i n external phenomena, which was continued in the mental and moral, and lastly in the psycho - theistic phase of thou ght. In its latest stage the doctrine is destructive of individual respon sibilit y in man and o f personal unity in d eity, o r the operating Intelligence. There was no revelation, no n ew point of departure in ph enomena, no thing added to n ature or human kno wledge i n these later views of mythology into metaphysic, philosoph y, o r theology, in which the suppo sed revelation o f newer truth was largely found ed on a falsification o f the old. We a re not only contemporaries of savage men in many of our current customs and be nighting beliefs, we a re a lso the victim s of his leavings -- various of our superstiti ons being the primiti ve fetishism t hat still survives in the last stage of perversion. But now for a development of the Devil! In Egypt t he old Devil of darkness, as Sut - Ty phon o r Sevekh, the Crocodile - headed divinity, acquired a soul in the stars and a place in h eaven, as Plutarch says. To h im was given the Crocodile or Dragon Constellation in the planisphere, whose ca sting out of heaven is described in the Book o f Revelati on, and in the Persian Bahman Yasht, where Sut, o r Sevekh the Dragon, that old serpent, is identified as Satan, the e ternal adversary of souls, just as it i s in the Egyptian Ritual of the Dead.

This was the a ss that was figuratively kicked ou t in the Christian sport of \"beating the a ss,\" when that pastim e used to b e practised up and do wn the a isles of Christian churches, and the priest used to bray three tim es, and the people respond ed like asses! The German d evil was at one tim e the red - bearded thund er, the Voice of Darkness! which takes us back to Sut - Typhon, who, as Plutarch informs us, was of a reddish complexion. It is comm on for our giants to b e e ndo wed with a red streami ng comet's tail of a beard! Our f orefathers, the Norsemen, h ad littl e respect and no reverence for the devil; and as to h ell, why, if you d id no t get to h eaven, then h ell was the next best place in the other world, if there were but two!

The m ythical devil was pretty much d ying out, un til it was revived and sublim ated b y the theology of Luther, Calvin, and Milton. The Romi sh Church d id no t deify the devil as the Protestants have don e. She was better acquainted with the tradition o f his creation and the earthly nature of his character.

Indeed, bo th d evil and giant as well as the serpent and d ragon, h ad on e origin, and the orthodo x Satan is, after all, the popu lar monster of myt hology. Luther and Calvin doub led the devil, and p lace d on e a t eac h end o f their scheme of things, the upp er or bright God being rather the worse devil of the two! They put the doctrine of dualism as perplexingly as did the negro p reac her who told h is cong regation there were but t wo roads open to them -- one of these led d irectly to destruction, and the other went straight to p erdition. \"Stop a bit, b rudd er,\" cried on e of the c ongregation; \"hold h ard, whilst I get out ob d is!\" And there a re many people who de sire to b ecome followers of that negro, and \"get out ob d is.\" The Satan o f sace rdotal belief, then, is not a being for God o r man to k ill, bu t an effigy in shodd y that only wants to b e ripped up to show you that it i s s tuffed with sawdust! Some people may cry out in an agony of earnestness, as Charles Lamb stamm ered in h is fun, \"But this is doing away with the devil; d - d - d - don 't deprive me of my devil!\" \" We hop e for better things. How shall we be a ble to force people into thinking as we do, and frighten the m i nto our fold o f f aith, for the glory of God, if we have no d evil for our ferocious s hepherd - dog?\" And there is no doub t but that, in giving up the orthodo x Hell and ancient Devil, we a re losing one of the most potent m otive powers.

The Bishop of Truro said rece ntly that we a re a pproaching a period o f pain and p eril, and the situation calls for strong words and strong prayers. You must cry aloud o r the Lord won't hear you! Standing face to face with certain facts, the result of things as they are, and h ave been, the atheists exclaim , -- \"There is no God!

Let m e a ssure our fr ee - thou ght friends, that Evolution n ece ssitates a new idea a ltogether of the operative power! It abolishes the incompetent personal Creator of the Hebrew G enesis!

And h ere, let m e say, tha t whilst recognising the inexorableness of the natural law in certain spheres of operation, where it works like the bound Samson o f blind force for the good o f the species, I find that Spiritualism i ntrodu ces a c onsciousness akin, and, at least, equal, to the human, into the working of law in a realm beyond the imm ediately visible.

Professor Max M√ºller, Cox, Gubernatis and o ther propound ers of the Solar Mythos have portrayed the primiti ve myth - maker f or us as a sort of Germanised - Hi ndu metaphysician, p rojecting his own shadow on a mental mi st, and talking ingeniously concerning smoke, o r, at least, cloud ; the sky overhead b ecomi ng like the dome of dreaml and, scribbled ov er with the im agery of aboriginal nightm ares! They conceive the early man in their own likeness, and look upon h im as perversely prone to self - mystification, o r, as Fontenelle has it, \"subject to beholding things that are not there!\" They have mi srepresented p rimiti ve or archaic man as having been idiotically mi sled fr om t he first by an active but untutored im agination into b elieving all sorts of fallacies, which were directly and constantly contradicted b y his own d aily experience; a fool of f ancy in the mi dst of those grim realiti es that were grinding his experience i nto h im , like the grinding icebergs making their im prints upon the rocks s ubmerged b eneath the sea. It remains to b e said, and will one day be ackno wledged, that these acce pted teac hers have been no n earer to the beginnings of mythology and language than B urn's poet Willi e had b een n ear to Pegasus. My reply is, 'Tis but a dream of the metaphysical theorist that m ythology was a disease of language, or anything else e xcept his own b rain. The origin and meaning of mythology have been mi ssed altogether by these solarites and weather - mongers! Mythology was a primiti ve mode of thinging the ea rly thou ght. It was found ed on n atural facts, and is s till verifiable in ph enomena. There is nothing insane, no thing irrational in it, when considered in the light of evolutio n, and when its mode of expression b y sign - language is thoroughly und erstood. The insanity lies in mi staking it for human h istory or Divine Revelation. Mythology is the repository of man's most ancient science, and what concerns us chiefly is this -- when tr uly interpreted on ce more it i s destined to b e the death o f those false theologies to which it has unwitti ngly given b irth! In modern ph raseology a statement is s ometim es s aid to b e mythical in p ropo rtion to its being untrue; but the a ncient m ythology was not a system or mode of f alsifying in that sense. Its fables were the means of conv eying facts; t hey were neither f orgeries nor fictions. Nor did mythology originate in any intentional doub le - dealing whatever, althou gh it did assume a n aspect of duality wh en d irect expression in words had succee ded the primiti ve mode of representation b y means of things as s igns and symbols. For example, when the Egyptians pou rtrayed the moon as a Cat, they were not ignorant enou gh to suppo se that the moon was a ca t; nor di d their wandering fancies s ee a ny likeness in the moon to a ca t; nor was a ca t - myth any mere ex pan sion o f verbal metapho r; nor had they any intention o f making puzzles or riddles to mi slead o thers by means of such enigmatical sign - language, at a tim e when they could no t help themselves, having no choice in the matter. They had ob served the sim ple fact that the ca t saw in the dark, and that her eyes beca me full - orbed and grew most lumi nou s by night. The moon was the seer by night in h eaven, and the ca t was i ts equivalent on the ea rth; and so the"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"famili ar cat was adop ted as a representative, a natural sign, a living pictograph o f the lunar orb! Where we shou ld make a c omparison, and say the moon saw in the dark like a cat, o r the ca t saw like the moon b y night , they identified the one with the other (a mode of metapho r which still characterises the great style in po etry), and said the ca t up there can see by night. And so it followed that the sun which saw down in the und er - world at night, could also b e ca lled the ca t, as it was, b eca use it also saw in the dark. The name of the ca t in Egyptian is mau, which d enotes the seer, from mau, to see. One writer on mythology asserts that the Egyptians \"im agined a great cat behind the sun, which is the pup il of the ca t's eye.\" But this im agining is all m odern. It is the M√ºllerite stock in trade! The moon as cat was the e ye of the sun, b eca use it reflected the solar light, and b eca use the e ye gives back the im age in its mi rror. In the form of the Godd ess Pasht the ca t keeps watch for the sun, with h er paw holding down and b ruising the head o f the serpent of darkness, called h is eternal enemy! The ca t was the e ye of night in the same symbolical sense that our daisy, which op ens and shuts with the rising and setting of the sun , is called the eye of day. Moreover, the ca t saw the sun, h ad it i n its eye by night, when it was otherwise unseen b y men. We mi ght say the moon mirrored the solar light, b eca use we have looking g lasses. With them t he ca t's eye was the mi rror. The hare wa s another type of the e ye that opened in h eaven and saw in the dark. Consequently, we find the hare in the moon is a myth that gave birth to a c omm on and wide - spread superstiti on. In later tim es the symbol is literalized, and it i s s uppo sed that primiti ve men were a lways on the look - out for likenesses, like a youthful poet in search of comparisons, and that they saw some resemblance to the form of a hare in the dark shadows of the lunar orb. Whereas in mythology things are not what t hey seem t o anybod y; tha t would lead to no consensus of agreement, no r establish any science of kno wledge. A learned man on ce remarked to me on the strange fact that the a ncients shou ld h ave selected the least observable of all t he planets, Mercury, to make so must of, as the mes senger. He was entirely ignorant of the fact that m ythology includes a system of tim e - keeping, and that Mercury was made the planetary messenger (in addition to h is lunar character), b eca use his revolution round the sun is performed in the shortest space o f planetary tim e. In like manner, Max M√ºller will t ell you that the moon was called b y the name of Sasnka in Sanskrit, from sasa, the hare, because the c omm on p eople in India think the black marks in the moon look like a hare! But this is mere fool's work or child's play with the surface a ppearance of things which h as littl e or no relation to true myth o r ancient symbolism; and all such interpretation is entirely mi sleading! Egypt, as I contend, has left us the means of determi ning the original nature a nd s ignificance of these types. When the Egyptians would d enote a n op ening, says Hor - Apollo, they delineate a hare, beca use this anim al always has its eyes open. The name of the hare in Egyptian is Un, which signifies open, to op en, the opener, especially conn ected with p eriodicity, as the word also means the hou r. This will explain ho w the wide, op en - eyed h are beca me a type of the moon, which op ens with its new light once a month, as the hare in h eaven. The hare is the hieroglyphic sign o f the opener, which ca n b e variously applied to the phenomena of opening; to the sun as well as the moon. The hare is an especial emblem of the god Osiris in the c haracter of Un - Nefer, the good op ener; in later phrase, the good revealer! It is as the seer that both h are a nd cat are a ssociated with the witch as types of"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"abno rmal seership. The hare a lso d enoted the opening tim e, as the period o f pub escence, when it was lawful for the sexes to come together. Hence it was the type of periodicity and legality in the human ph ase! For this reason, the youths among the Namaqua Hottentots are (or were) not allowed to eat the hare. With the Chinese the rabbit t akes the place of the hare a s a lunar type. Its period o f gestation b eing thirty days, that would make it an appropriate representa tive of the lunation, o f opening anew, and o f re - birth. The Selish Indians have a myth o f the frog in the moon. They tell how the wolf, in love with the frog, was pursuing her by night, when she leaped into the moon, and escaped. Amongst the superstiti ons of our English folk - lore, we a lso h ave one respecting the frog or toad, that is s uppo sed to b e visible in the moon. Now it can b e shown ho w the frog g ot deposited there; but only as a type, no t in reality, no r as a mere a ppearance. The frog is a natural tr ansformer fr om t he tadpo le phase in the water to the four - legged stage on land! The moon likewise transforms, and the metamorpho sis of the lunar orb could b e typified by the c hange in the frog, and so the frog as picture - object, n atural t ype a nd living dem onstrator f or the moon, u ltim ately beca me the frog in the moon. The moon rose up monthly from t he ce lestial waters, renewed like the frog, and as the horned on e grew full - orbed it mi ght be thou ght of as losing the tail of its tad - pole c ond ition. The frog w as figured as the head o f the Egyptian godd ess Hekat (= Greek Heca te), the c onsort of Khnef, on e of whose titl es is the \"king of fr ogs.\" Hekat being a lunar godd ess and Khnef a solar god, this titl e would d enote that he was lord o f the numerous transformat ions of light in the moon, d escribed as being the father, and she a s the mother, o f fr ogs, b eca use the frog was the typical transformer, as representative of the moon. The Chinese have a three - legged frog in the moon that was an ancient beauty, n amed Chang Ngo, who lives there beca use she once drank the a mrita of imm ortality. I have e lsewhere suggested that the original Phryne of Greece was a form of the frog - godd ess who transformed! The name of Phryne denotes the frog; and in the most famous s tatue of her, carved b y Apelles, she was pou rtrayed as Venus transfiguring from t he foam, as did the frog - godd ess Hekat, o f Egypt, who was the frog in the moon. Only be reading these types, which p rece ded letters, can we a t all und erstand the thou ght and intention o f t he primiti ve thingers or thinkers. Another example: the dun g - beetle in Egypt was a type of Khepr - Ptah, the c reator by transformation, who is s aid to h ave been b egotten b y his own b ecomi ng, and to h ave been born withou t a mother, through repetiti on o f him se lf. Khep, the root of the name, signifies to transform. External nature was the scene of eternal transformation and n ever - ending metamorpho sis. And it had b een ob served that Khepr, the beetle, was likewise a transformer, inasmuch as it l aid its eggs in dun g found on the banks of the Nile, rolled it up into a ball, and bu ried itself deep in the dry sand along with its s eed, where, qua beetle, it t ransformed, the old b eetle into the youn g one, and so continued as the same beetle by transformation! Thus the be etle served to typify that being or existence which could no t be e xpressed, bu t which was s een to continue forever by self - repetiti on in phenomenal m anifestation. They knew nothing of beginning, and d id no t pretend to kno w, bu t only of becomi ng, and o f rep etiti on o r \"renewal comi ng of itself.\" So the beetle was adop ted as a type of transformation, whether of the old moon into the new one, of the sun ou t of the lower into the upp er heaven, o r, in the latter tim es, o f the dead mumm y"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"into a living soul. Hor - Ap ollo says the scarab√¶us deposits his ball of seed in the ea rth for the space of 28 d ays, the length o f tim e during which the moon p asses through the 12 signs of the zodiac, and on the 29th d ay it opens the ball. The day on which the conjunction o f sun and moon o ccurred was the day of resurrection for the new life. The beetle in h eaven h ad on ce more transformed, and there was another new moon ! The orb o f the moon with its changes night after night, its drama longer even than any performed b y the Chinese now - a - days, its drop - scene of the darkness at the e nd, and the transformation into the new life of light in the beginning, p resented the ea rliest form of the primiti ve theatre, which o ffered its celestial show in h eaven, gratis to all eyes that gazed up from b elow. This must have been on e of the ea rliest educators in n atural phenomena! There is nothing more interesting to me than to watch the nascent mi nd o f man making its infantile c lutch, and trying to catch on and lay hold o f external things -- to lay hold, as it were, o f the skirts of the passing powers, that were held to b e superior to itself: nothing more instructive than to follow the primiti ve ways of keeping touch with the life of external nature, and o f sharing in the operations going on, so as to b e on the right and safe side, and get on the true line for deriving some benefit from t he way in which things were seen to b e going! This is very touching in its s im plicity, and will t eac h us more c oncerning the past of man than all t he metaphysical i nterpretat ion h itherto attempted. The proper tim e for prayer, wishing or invok ing aid, was at first sight of the new moon, just as it started v isibly on the way to fulfilm ent, the mental attit ude being, \"May my wish b e fulfilled like the light in thy orb, oh moon ! M ay my life be renewed like thy light!\" Such was the prayer of the Congo n egroes. The full m oon b eing the mother - moon, the eye that mi rrored o r reprodu ced the light of the sun, that will acc oun t for the day of the full m oon b eing acc oun ted -- as it was by the Greeks, Britons, and others -- the most propitious tim e for the marriage ce remony. The full m oon was held to come forth great with good luck! Boy - children ou ght to b e weaned when the horned moon was waxing, and girls when it was on the wane -- the female bein g the reprodu cer as bringer - forth. So p eas and b eans were sown in the wane of the moon to rise a gain like the moon renewed. Corn ou ght to b e c ut during the wane of the moon if you would h ave them disappear quickly. In v ery sim ple ways the primiti ve observe rs had tried to set their life in tim e with the life going on around them, and thus get what li ght they could from Nature for their own guidance, and also make her language their own. Butler asks (in Hudibras): -- \"Why on a sign no p ainter draws The full m oon ever but the half?\" Now, that is very good sign language, especially as the \"half - moon \" is a pub lic - hou se symbol. It was an invitation to eat and d rink to the full, o r come to the full as the half - moon do es; it m ay be, to \"get fu',\" in the Scottish sen se. A moon already full would no t have a nswered the purpose. An eclipse projected the shadow of comi ng calamit y.

The first - born from t he dead, the first - fruits of them t hat slept in the graveyard o f sunk en suns, and cemetery of old d ead moon s, was reprodu ced v isibly in external phenomena, as the new moon which was personated b y the male moon - go d Taht, called the e ighth, and lord o f the e ighth region, as the place of rising again from t he dead in the orb o f the moon. There was a lunar mythology extant long before it was kno wn that the lunar orb was a reflector of the solar light. There was a tim e also when it was not kno wn, and could no t be divined, that t he moon which dwindled and d ied do wn v isibly was the same moon that rose a gain from t he dead. Hence there were two different m essages conv eyed from heaven to men on earth, b y the hare a s messenge r for the moon in the lunar myths of the Hottentots and o ther primiti ve race s. In one of these versions the moon d eclared that, as it died and d id no t rise a gain from it s grave, even so was it with man, who went down to the ea rth and came back no more. But , when it had made out that the same moon returned as the old o rb renewed, the nature of its r eve lation was r eve rsed. Its message now contained a doctrine of the resurrection from the dead for man as well as moon. The re - arising and transformi ng orb at las t proclaim ed that even as it did no t die out altogether, bu t was renewed from some hidden spring or source of light, so was it with the human race , who were likewise renewed to re - live on hereafter like the moon. In a myth o f the Caroline Islanders it i s s aid that at first m en on ly quitted this life on the last day of the dying moon, to b e revivified when the new moon appeared. But there was a dark spirit t hat inflicted a death from which there was no revival. This dark spirit, with its fatal m essage, was p rim ary in fact, and the true assurance of survival, like the moon, d epended on its being identified as the same moon which rose a gain. It is in this way that we ca n re - think the primiti ve thou ght, b y getting it re - thinged in the physical realiti es of natur al phenomena. In the Ute Mythos the task o f making a moon was assigned to Whip - Poor - Will, a god o f the night. The frog offered him self as a willi ng sacrifice for this purpose, and h e was transformed b y magical incantations into the New Moon. The symbolism is identical, whether derived from Egypt or not. So is it when the Buddh a offers his bod y as a sacrifice, and transforms him self into the lunar hare. The Maories have a tradition o f the first children o f earth, in which they relate that the earliest subjec t of human thou ght was the difference between light and d arkness; they were a lways thinking what mi ght be the difference betwixt li ght and d arkness. Naturally, the prim ary cond itions of existence observed b y primiti ve men were those that were most observab le, and, foremost amongst these, were the phenomena of the day and the dark, which followed eac h o ther in cea seless change. Mythology begins with this vague a nd merely elemental phase of external phenomena, alternating in n ight and d ay. In a second ary stag e, it was observed that the battle field o f this never ending warfare of day and d ark was focussed and b rought to a definite point in the orb o f the moon, where the struggle betwixt the two p ersonified po wers of light and d arkness went on and on for ever, eac h po wer having its triumph ov er the other in its turn, -- these being depicted in one representation as the solar light and the serpent of darkness, in another by the lion and the unicorn. These phenomena of light and d arkness were a t first set forth b y m eans of anim als, reptiles, b irds, and o ther primiti ve types of the e lemental powers; and lastly the human type was adop ted, and the c unn ing of the c rocodile, o r the jackal of darkness, is represented b y the Egyptian Sut, the Norse Loki, the Greek Hermes, o r the Jewish"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Jacob, the dark d ece iver; and to - day, we find the Christian Evidence Society engaged in defending such characters as that of Jacob, in the full and p erfect belief that Jacob was a human b eing, and on e of God's chosen race .

The human form, like that of the earlier anim al t ype, was only representative of some power manifested in n atural phenomena. This mode of representation was kno wn when these sacred stor ies were first told o f mythical characters; it was afterwards continued and taught i n the so - called \"mysteries\" by means of the Gnosis. When the a rt or Gnosis was lost t o the world outside, the a ncient histories were ignorantly suppo sed to b e human in thei r origin; mythology was euhemerized (that is, the ideal was mi staken for the real), and Egyptian mythology was conv erted into Hebrew mi racles and Christian h istory. Thus when the Iroquo is Indians claim t hat the first ancestor of the red man was a hare, we do no t kno w w hat t hat saying means until we learn the representative value of the symbol! So is it all sign - writing through. When Herodo tus went to Egypt, h e recognized the originals of the gods that were a dored, amplified, embellished, o r laughed at in Gr eece . At present, ho wever, the M√ºllerites dare not m ention Egypt, bu t l ook askance a t t hose who do. Here is a c rucial i nstance of survival, evidenced b y philology, -- the name of Mars as Ares will serve to p rove how Egyptian und erlies the Greek! The planet M ars is called Har - Tesh in Egyptian, which signifies the red lord, or the lord o f gore. Cedrenus writes the name of Ar√™s as Hartosi, and Vettius Valens as Hartes, whence Artis, and finally Ar√™s. Again, the name of Hera denotes the heaven, ov er, in Egyptian; which certainly describes the nature of the Greek godd ess of that name. When we a re told b y the Roman Catholic Egyptologist, Renou f, that \"Neither Hebrews nor Greeks borrowed any of their ideas from Egypt,\" we ca n on ly think o f such a dictum as an intenti onal blind, o r as a result of putting up the glass to an eye that canno t see. It is sim ply im possible for the non - evolutionist, the bigotted Bibliolator, o r the M√ºllerite, to interpret or to und erstand the mythology of Egypt. Its roots go d eep, and its bra nches spread too far, for their range of thou ght. And no w, let m e offer a remarkable e xample of the modes in which the Egyptians expressed o r tinged their thou ghts, b y means of external phenomena. The sun - god Ra is represented as possessing fourteen spirit s or kaus, the living likenesses and glorified im ages of him self. These a re portrayed as fourteen p ersonages at Edfu and Denderah. In on e text it i s s aid, -- \"Hail t o thee a nd thy fourteen spirits fourteen tim es.\" These a re a lso mentioned in the tablet of Ip sambul, as the fourteen kaus of Ra, which \"Taht has added to all his ways.\" Taht is the moon - god, and this gives us a c lue to the fourteen spirits, which, I think, no Egyptologist has yet suspected. But Taht is the god o f the first fourteen d ays of the moo n's lunation, and fourteen n ights of the new moon reprodu ced the likeness of the solar god in light fourteen tim es over; these were designated h is appa rition seen n ightly in the moon !

These fourteen p arts typi fy the fourteen d ays of the lessening light, du ring which the devil of darkness had the upp er hand. The twenty - eight days made one lunar month acc ording to Egyptian reckon ing. The ea rlier and sim pler representation o f the lunar light and d ark is portrayed in the myth of the Two Brothers, who always contend for supremacy over eac h o ther. The most ancient and p rimiti ve myths are found to b e the most universal; and this of the twin brothers is extant all over the world. It is the myth o f Sut - Horus in Egypt; t h e Asvins or Krishna a nd Balarama in India; the Crow and the Eagle of the Australian b lacks; Tsuni - Goam and Gaunab among the Hottentots; Jack and Jill, and twenty other f orms that I have c ompared in my \"Natural Genesis.\" It i s that struggle of two b rothers in the beginning which is represented in the Hebrew book o f Genesis as the murderous conflict of Cain and Abel. Cain as the victor is the same c haracter as the Egyptian Khun su, Khun or Khen, meaning to chase, hun t, b eat, b e the victor, and therefore I take it t hat the name of Cain is probably one with the Egyptian Khun. Abel is the dark littl e one that fades and falls and p asses away, the one who b ecomes a sacrificial type, b eca use of the nature of the phenomena. The c onqu eror is portrayed as the killer. Th e Gnostic Cainites, ho wever, maintained truly that Cain d erived h is being from t he power abov e, and no t from t he e vil power below. They knew the Mythos. The c ontention o f Jacob and Esau for birth and for the birth - right is another form of the same myth. Es au, the red and hairy, is really the lord of light in the new moon. Jacob is the c hild o f darkness, h ence the dece iver by nature a nd by name. A Jewish tradition relates that Esau, when bo rn, h ad the likeness of a serpent marked upon h is heel. This s hows he was a personification o f the hero who b ruised the serpent's head, and that Jacob, who laid ho ld o f Esau's heel, was a c o - type in ph enomena with the serpent of darkness. There is nothing moral or imm oral i n mere physical phenomena themselves. No fratricide is actually committ ed b y the c onqu ering Cain, no r fraud b y the dark and wily Jacob. But when these same phenomena a re dramatised, and the c haracters are made human, o r inhu man, as the ca se may be, the un - moral becomes imm oral, and the human im age is disfi gured b y the most wilful flaw, o r wanton b rand o f degradation. Cain is made the murderer of his own b rother, in the beginning, and that red stain is s uppo sed to run through all human h istory, as a first result of Adam's fall, and to burn on the brow of man un til it i s washed ou t at l ast i n the blood o f a redeemi ng Saviour -- who is equa lly mythical.

It m ay be said qu ite a s bluntly that Khun su is not t he moon. He only represents one phase of the lunar phenomena, which are triadic. Khun su i s the c hild o f the sun and moon. His name denotes the youn g hero. When this deity was evolved it had been d iscovered that t he moon d erived h er light from t he sun. In the planisphere of Denderah the youthful God Khun su is pou rtrayed in the disk o f the full moon at Easter, where he represents the light and force of the sun that is reborn monthly and annu ally of the lunar orb considered to b e his mother, who thus reprodu ces the c hild o f light in the disk o f the moon. The same myth is likewise Osirian, as we le arn from one of the hymns, where it i s s aid, \"Hail t o 173 thee, Osiris, Lord o f Eternity! When thou art in h eaven thou appearest as the sun, and thou renewest thyself as the moon. \" But this renewal of light in the moon was pou rtrayed as the re - birth o f the god in the person o f his own child; hence the c hild Horus is also depicted like the c hild Khun su in the disk o f the full m oon, as both may be seen in the same planisphere of Denderah. Khun su is the Egyptian Jack the giant - killer. In the Ritual he is calle d the slayer of rebels and p iercer of the proud. His natural genesis was in the tiny light of the new moon, which rose up with its s harp ho rns to p ierce the powers of night, and d rive them out of the darkened o rb. The giants of the primiti ve mi nd were the powers of darkness, which forever r ose up in revolt against t he light, k ept all li fe cowering in their shadow by night, took po ssession o f the moon in the latter half of the lunation, o r covered its face with the blood and du st of battle during the terribl e tim e of an eclipse. Then the littl e hero, the c hild o f light, arose a nd made war on the giants, and overcame them as he grew in glory and waxed greatly in the plenitude of his Hidden father's power and mi ght. The name of Khun su's father is Amen, the Hidd en God, the child Khun su b eing his visible representative re - born in the new moon. Mythology is the ground - work o f all our theology and Christology, and it i s only by mastering the plan that we ca n learn ho w the superstructure has been bu ilt. This characte r of Khun su is that of the mythical Messiah, o r manifester in external nature, as a representative of the Eternal in the phenomena of tim e.

In the mystical or spiritual phase this representative of divinity was the Christ within, the Son o f God incarnate in matter; the Christ of the Gnostics who was not a man; their Jesus, who could no t be a Jew; their Redeemer, who was but the imm ortal principle in man, a Deliverer fr om t he degradation; a Saviour solely from t he dissolution o f matter, which the Greek po et L inus calls the \"Giver of all shameful things.\""},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"But to return to the Moon Mythos. The legend o f Samson can no w be read for the first tim e a s the Hebrew version o f the Egyptian myth o f Khun su, the luni - solar hero who slays the giants -- or Philistines -- and ov e rcomes the powers of darkness. It was im possible to read the riddle by suppo sing, with Steinthal, that Samson was s im ply the sun - god him self; beca use if he were, in k illi ng the lion h e would b e only slaying the reflection o f him self -- the lion b eing a solar type. The name of Shim shon d enotes the lumi nou s or shining one, as an emanation o f the solar fire. Samson, like Khun su, is the typical hero. Khun su is the Egyptian Heracles. Samson, like Heracles, slays the lion, as his first great labou r, o r f eat of stre ngth. This deed is represented allegorically, and is put forth as his riddle. Out of the ea ter 174 came forth meat, and ou t of the mi ghty came forth sweetness. The mi ghty one who devou rs is the lion, and the hon ey was found in its dead carcase. The Mithrai c a nd Egyptian monu ments will enable us to read the riddle. In the Persian we see the lion depicted with a bee in its mouth. The lion, o r rather the lioness, was an Egyptian figure of fire -- the lioness in h eat. She was represented, b y the godd ess of the so lar f ire a nd alcoho lic spirit, as Sekhet, who carries the sun's disk on the head o f a lioness. The name of this s he - lion, Sekhet, is also the name for the bee, which is the royal symbol of Lower Egypt; and the bee denotes the sweetness in the lion. Now, th e fiercest solar heat was coincident with the waters of the Inund ation, two - thirds of which (acc ording to Hor - Apollo) pou red do wn into Egypt whilst the sun was in the sign o f the lion. Sekhet was also the godd ess of sweetness or pleasure -- we may say litera lly, godd ess of the hon eymoon. Hence the a ssociation o f the lion and the bee, o r the hon ey in the lion. The triumph ov er the lion may be und erstood in this way. Sekhet, the she - lion, im personated the force of the sun, which was often fatal, h ence she was m ade the pun isher of the wicked with h ell - fire; and this lunar hero, as Heracles, Khun su, o r Samson, was the conqu eror in the c ool of the night, which followed the fiery fervou r of the sun b y day. Further, at the tim e the sun was in the lion - sign, the full moon rose vis - √† - vis in the sign o f the Waterman, o r Waterwoman, in the Hermean Zodiac; and we ca nno t read on e part of the ce lestial im agery independently of the other. In this full m oon, which b rought the sweet, fresh waters to Egypt, the hero attained the height of his glory, as conqu eror of the furnace - heat which culmi nated then and there with the sun in the sign o f the lioness, as reflector of the fiercest solar f ire. As the moon was the bringer of the waters, and the breath o f life in the c oolness and t he dews of night, the lunar hero was not only credited with d rawing the sting of Sekhet, bu t with extracting hon ey from t he dead lion.

In the Egyptian Ritual the Osirified as Horus, ascends the heaven with h is long hair r eac hing down to h is shou lders as a type of his growing g lory. Moreover, Samson's hair, the e mblem of his strength, is in seven locks. These a nswer to the sev en n ights of the quarter in which the lunar splendou r comes to the full, and the oppo sing powers of darkness, called the Philistines, are very literally \"cleared ou t.\" When this period is past, and the hero is s horn of his hair, the Philistines are upon h i m once more. This tim e the drama is to come to an end. But not withou t an intim ation o f its being continued o r r epeated in the next new moon, for the narrative c onfesses conscientiously that Samson's hair began to grow again after he was s haven. But for th e present the powers of darkness prevail; and h aving shorn the hero o f his glory during seven n ights, and b rought him l ow, they put out his s ight and bind h im with fetters of brass, eyeless in Gaza, p itiful and forlorn as \"blind Orion hun gering for the mor n.\" The e ye of the blinded Horus being put out by Sut, who was at the head o f the Typhon ian powers, called the Sami, or conspirators, is identical in the Egyptian mythos with the putting out of Samson's eyes in the Hebrew version! In the Osirian myth, ho we ver, it i s the eye of Horus that i s wound ed; t he e ye that i s s wallowed b y Sut; t he e ye that i s restored at dawn o f day, and this one - eyed form of the mythos s urvives in the acc oun t of Samson's blindn ess when h e prays for strength enou gh to avenge the loss of one of his two eye s, as we have it i n the margin! The lunar light was the eye of the sun, bu t this becomes the two eyes of the hero when h e is rendered acc ording to the c omplete human likeness, which shows us how the mythos was rationalised as history. It is Delilah who causes the ruin o f Samson, just as Ishtar, called Godd ess 15, as the moon at full, is the ruin o f her lovers, in the legend o f Ishtar and Izdub ar, where she is charged with b eing an enchantress, a poisoner, a destroyer of male potency. Iz dub ar, the sun - god, reproaches her with witchcraft, h er murderous lust, h er merciless cruelty, and d eclines to b ecome her"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"lover him self! According to the myth the luni - solar male divinity was represented in the wane of the light as s uffering from t he e vil influence of the female moon. It is very evident that the myths were made by men; as in case of a fall or catastroph e it was always she who did it. She tempted the poo r man, o r overcame the god. It was she who h ad shorn him of his glory; she who h ad given him poison to d rink, and b etrayed h im t o the powers of darkness; she who is the ca use of his im potential m ood, h is waning, languishing, and droop ing down. And the true meaning of Delilah's name, I take it, expresses the weakened, worn - out, im potent cond iti on o f the lunar hero thus brought low -- the name being derivable from a root signifying to totter, d roop, and h ang inertly down -- Delilah being the personified cause of this emasculated cond ition o f the reduced and wretched, bound and b linded lunar god, the mi ghty hero in h is fallen state. The Danes have a lunar Delilah o r lady of the moon, who is described as being very beautiful when seen in front, but she is hollow behind: she plays upon a harp o f seven strings, and with this s he lures youn g men to h er on purpose to d estroy them. The Hebrews have a Talm udic tradition that Samson was lame in bo th h is feet. And this was the status or cond ition o f the c hild - Horus, who was s aid to b e maim ed and h alt i n h is lower members; the c ripple deity, as he is called b y Pl utarch. Other scattered fragments of the true myth are to b e found ; for instance, in the lunar triad o f the mother and the twin b rothers, on e of them acc ompanies the female moon du ring the first half of the total lunation, the other during the latter half; and this appears to b e reflected b y the Hebrew mythos when Samson's wife is \"given to his companion whom he had u sed as a friend. \" Again, the jackal was an Egyptian type of the dark on e that devou red b y night, and o f Sut, the thief of light in the moon, h e who swallowed the Eye of Horus. Jackal and fox are c o - types, and they have one name, that of Shugal, the howler, in Hebrew. This enables us to und erstand the story of the 300 foxes or jackals in the Jewish form of the myth. Samson b eing the representativ e of the sun - god who d rives the darkness out of or away from t he lunar orb, and do es all t he damage he can to the Typhon ian po wers, o r Philistines, the story - teller multiplies the jackal t o enhance the triumph o f his hero; and instead o f the struggle betwe en Horus and the jackal - headed Sut - Anup, we have the more difficult feat of catching 300 jackals and setting fire to their tails, so that they mi ght consume the c rops of the Philistines, o r, in other words, bu rn ou t the darkness from t he orb o f the moon. I t is probable that Mithra, son o f Ahura Mazda, and n atural oppon ent of the dark Power, is the same representative of the God o f Light, reflected in the moon as the witness by night for the a bsent sun. It m ay be noted that Matra in Egyptian means the Witnes s, o r more fully, the Witness for Ra. The scene pou rtrayed on the Persian monu ments is nocturnal, and the tim e of year is that of the sun's entrance into the sign o f Scorpio, where it i s deprived o f its virilit y. At this tim e the moon rises at full i n the sign o f the Bull, the first of the superior signs. The Lord o f Light in the moon is now the domi nating power during six months. Thus M ithras s laying the Bull i s equivalent to Samson k illi ng the Lion, o r overcomi ng the fierceness of the Solar fire; and also of Osiris doing battle with Sut - Typhon and conqu ering his terrors in external phenomena. Osiris dies on the 17th o f the month Athor, which was at the tim e of the Autumn Equinox, o r rather he e nters the six lower signs at that tim e.

Thus it was in the new moon that the Dead Osiris first returned to life in the form of his own so n. Our modern solarite interpreters can talk o f littl e e lse but the sun, the dawn, and the dark. Mr. Renou f, in h is Hibbert lectures, identifies Sut - Anub is with the twilight, o r as the dusk. Hence, when it i s s aid in the texts that he \"swallowed h is father Osiris,\" this on the face of it l ook s like the darkness of night swallowing the disappearing sun. But Egyptian mythology is by no means s o sim ple a s that. It is not to b e fathomed on the face of it, no r can it be interpreted withou t such a kno wledge of th e total typology, as the Aryan Schoo l all put together do no t possess. There is nothing sim ply solar in it anywhere! It is true that Sut represents the presence a nd the power of darkness. It is true that the nocturnal sun in the und er world was called Osir is, o r Atum, o r Amen - Ra. Also, the setting orbs of light were represented as being swallowed do wn b y the c rocodile or some other type of the devou rer. But the c ontinual conflict and alternate victory of light and d arkness were seen to h ave their most obv io us, most visible, most interesting field o f battle in the moon ! It was there the watchers observed the never - cea sing struggle for the birth - right of the twin brothers, who p ersonated the oppo sing powers. The dark on e was first born from t he mother moon at full; but the light one was ackno wledged to b e the genuine heir - apparent! There is a myth o f the blind Horus in which h e is described as s itti ng solitary in h is darkness. Sut is s aid to h ave swallowed h is eye, o r to h ave wound ed it, and pu t out the sight. In on e text Horus s ays, \"Behold, my eye is as thou gh Sut (Anup ) had p ierced it.\" In another he c ries, \"I am Horus. I come to search for mi ne e yes.\" Sut, who swallows the eye, is made to restore it again! In on e acc oun t the e ye is s aid to b e restored at the dawn of day; that is in the vague stage of the c onflict between the darkness and the light. At one tim e, says Plutarch, Sut smote Orus in the Eye; this represented the dimi nution o f the moon. At another he plucked the e ye out and swallowed it, afterwards giving it back to the sun. This blinding denoted the Eclipse. In the lunar phase of the mythos the Eye of light, o r of the sun, is the moon. The moon at full was the mi rror of light, h ence it was the mother of Horus as the c hild o f light! But the eye was t he primiti ve mi rror. So the moon was called the Eye of the sun, when it was known as a reflector of the solar light. Thus the lunar orb was the consort of the sun; his Eye by night, as the reprodu cer of his light when h e was in the und er - world; and in repr odu cing the light she was as the mother bringing forth h is child! For instance, the cow w as a type of the moon as Hathor, o r as Aahti, and when the c ow is portrayed with the solar disk b etween h er horns, the im agery denotes the mother - moon as bearer of the sun, that is, as reprodu cer of the solar light in the lunar orb, o r, as it was also said, in the Eye. For this reason the mother of Horus, child o f light, is also d escribed as being the e ye of Horus, the moon - mi rror in which the father Osiris made babies in the e ye, as the poets say, o r was reflected as Horus, the c hild o f light, re - born monthly of the moon as his mother. The lunar god Taht is s ometim es pou rtrayed with the e ye of Horus, o r the new moon in h is hand. And the godd ess M eri=Mary bears the e ye u pon h er head, as typical reprodu cer of the c hild. Now this is the e ye that was s wallowed b y Sut. When the power"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"of darkness had put out the lunar light, the e ye was not only pierced bu t swallowed, as the phenomena were rendered in the mythos. Moreover, as Osiris had b ecome the father of all, h e was also the ac kno wledged father of Sut; and as it was the father who was reflected b y the mother - moon, o r the e ye, Sut m ay be said to h ave swallowed h is own father when h e obscured the lunar light, o r swallowed it w ith the darkness during an eclipse. This was the symbolic e ye that was full on the 14th o f the month in the lunar, o r on the 15th in the soli - lunar reckon ing, o r on the 30th Epiphi, when the e ye of the year was full, acc ording to the Egyptian Ritual. The s wallowing of Osiris by Sut belongs to the soli - lunar phenomena! Plutarch tells us that some of the Egyptians held the shadow of the ea rth, which caused an eclipse of the moon, to b e Sut Typhon. By aid o f which we ca n identify the original dragon o f the ec l ipse! The mythical and celestial dragon, as I have elsewhere demonstrated, was found ed on the c rocodile a s the natural t ype of the swallowing darkness. The c rocodile is the swallower of the lights as they go do wn in the west, and the tail of the c rocodile reads kam, i.e., black, d arkness. Typhon (both male a nd female) is represented b y the c rocodile, the dragon o f the waters and o f darkness. Now the most thrilli ng and fearsome ac t of the lunar drama was during the period o f eclipse. There is s omething very weird, un canny, and unk ed, in the projection o f the ea rth's shadow across the lumi nou s face of the moon. To the primiti ve mi nd it was the c rocodile abov e, o r the dragon, swallowing the orb o f light, o r Sut swallowing his father Osiris. An eclipse was the m eal - tim e of the monster. An eclipse was the scene of the great battle between Horus and Sut, o r Horus and the Dragon, and the great battle was identical with that of our George a nd the Dragon. The same struggle between the powers of light and darkness is p ortrayed in the Book o f Revelation when the woman clothed with the sun, and the moon und er her feet, is abou t to b ring forth h er man child, and the great dragon o f eclipse stands before her r eady to d evou r the c hild as s oon as it i s born! In the oldest ast rono my the years were reckon ed b y the ec lipses, as it was in Egypt, China, and India. And the most ancient type of tim e or Kronu s, as Egyptian, is Sevekh, the c rocodile - headed god, that is, the dragon o f eclipse who annu ally swallowed the moon containing t he Lord o f Light or his infant Image. According to the mythical m ode of r epresenting the natural fact, three days and three nights were reckon ed for the a bsence of the lunar light, b etween o ld and n ew moon, and the Lord o f Light in the lunar orb was s aid t o b e swallowed b y a Dragon o r a monster fish and to remain for that length o f tim e in its belly. The legend is Egyptian. The great fish is the c rocodile, the dragon o f the deep. This is called the fish o f Horus in the Ritual. The Crocodile first denoted th e ea rth as the swallower of the Lights before it beca me the Water - Dragon, and so the Manifestor, as Horus, Jonah, Tangaroa, o r the Christ, could b e three days in the ea rth o r the great fish p reviously to h is resurrection. Types and stories mi ght be manifol d; t he fact signified was always the same. Hence the Jonah o f the Hebrew version is identical with the Christ, no t as type of him , where a ll i s typical; and in the Roman Catacombs the Jonah o f one version is the Christ of the other. Jonah issues from t he g reat fish in the form of the Child - Christ. Thus the origin o f the \"three days and three nights in the heart of the ea rth,\" or in the Crocodile, is to b e found in lunar phenomena."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"In a later form of the Osirian legend the Twins are the doub le Horus, instead of the Sut - Horus of the Typhon ian myth. In this we see the littl e dark child eyeless, soulless, maim ed in h is lower members, going into Tattu to meet his s oul, h is other self, h is glorified bod y, the doub le, like that of Buddh a, which was called h is diamo nd bod y. This other self is designated the soul of the sun, and it i s this which revivifies, regenerates, and transforms the c hild o f the mother - moon into the virile Horus, the new moon ho rned and pub escent. There is a tradition p reserved b y Plutarch that the c hild Horus, the c ripple deity, b egotten in the dark, was the result of Osiris having acc ompanied with Isis after her decea se, o r with Nephthys her sister, b elow the horizon. Even this representation is perfectly correct acc ording to the natural phenom ena. Isis personates the moon, which dies to b e a gain renewed. The renewal occurs in the und er - world, and is out of sight or all in the dark. Osiris, as the sun b elow the horizon is the renov ator of the old, dead o rb o f the moon, which h e ca uses to re - live with h is light; hence the fable of his acc ompanying with Isis after her demi se is in acc ordance with the mythical m ode of r epresenting the phenomena of external nature in hu man im agery. In on e of its phases the moon was portrayed in the c haracter of a thi ef, which was personated b y the jackal, ape, o r wolf, who represented Godd ess 15. Ishtar is described as ascending and d escending the steps of the moon, so many days up and so many days down -- of these days there would b e fifteen altogether, in acc ordance w ith h er name of Godd ess 15. And h ere the Christian Mary can b e identified in this lunar character by means of the Apocryphal Gospels, that contain legends of the infancy which are of prim ary im portance, h ence they have been d enoun ced as s purious, excomm uni cated as heretical, and k ept out of sight by Papal comm ands. In p seudo Matthew (ch. iv.), we learn that when the Virgin was an infant, just weaned, she ran up the fifteen steps of the temple at full speed, withou t once look ing back. At this age she was reg arded as an adult of abou t t hirty y ears! The story of the fifteen steps is repeated in the Gospel of Mary's nativity (ch. v i.), where the fifteen steps are a ssociated with the fifteen Psalm s of degrees. Further, it was on the 15th d ay of the moon that the dark on e of the twins was re - born, as the lessening, waning one of the two; and in the history of Joseph the ca rpenter, Jesus says that Mary gave him birth in the fifteenth year of her age, b y a mystery that no creature ca n und erstand except the Trinity. T he Trinity being lunar, the subject m atter is identical acc ording to the Gnosis of numbers, and Mary is also a form of the Godd ess 15, -- Meri, or Hathor - Meri, in the Egyptian Mythos. It is only in lunar phenomena that we ca n see how the c hild could b e born from t he side of its mother, as Sut - Horus was, as well as the Buddh a, o r the Christ. Also, the divine child, as Buddh a, was s aid to b e visible whilst in the mother's womb. The womb o f the mother being the lunar orb in which the c hild in embryo can b e seen in course of growth, it was represented as being transparent with the c hild on v iew. The c hild Jesus is s o pou rtrayed in the Christian p ictures of the e nciente Virgin Mary, as may be seen in Didron's Icono graphy! The birth o f the dark on e of the mother - moo n's two children, d epends upon that part of the lunar orb which is turned away from t he sun, b eing diml y seen through the light reflected from our earth. As the light began to lessen, and the orb b eca me opaque, there"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"was an obv ious birth o f the dark p art o f the moon ! That was the birth o f the littl e, d ark one, o f the lunar twins. So fine a point of departure from t he light half to the dark, and from t he dark h alf to the light, may be likened to a single hair -- as it was in the Hindu mythos, which represents Krishna a s being born from a single black h air and Balarama from a single white hair of Vishnu. This is, p robably, the mythical m eaning of a saying attributed to the Christ in the gospel of the Hebrews, -- \"And straightway,\" said Jesus, \"the holy spirit (my mother) took me a nd bo re me by one of the hairs of my head, to the great moun tain called Thabor.\" The e xact colour of the dark o rb is s late - black, and this has been p reserved in India a s the c omplexion o f the dark child, Hari or Krishna. These types of the light and d ark twins were ce rtainly continued as the two - fold Christ in Rome, on e form of whom i s the littl e black Bambino o f Italy, the Christ who was black for the same reason that Sut was black in Egypt, and Krishna was blue - black in India. He was blac k, beca use mythical, and no t beca use the Word was humanly incarnated as a nigger! He was black b eca use he was the c hild o f the virgin - mother as the moon ! One type of the twins found in the lunar phenomena has been hu manised in the story of Jesus and John ; these ca n b e trace d b ack to Horus and Sut, who is Aan o r Anup, the Egyptian John. These two appear in the Ritual as the \"Precursor,\" and the one who is preferred to h im who was first in comi ng. Speaking in the twin character, the Osirified decea sed says, \" I am Anup in the day of judgment. I am Horus, the Preferred, on the day of r ising.\" Anup p resided ov er the judgment; so John the Precursor proclaim s the judgment; and calls the world to repentance. Jesus comes as the \"preferred on e\" on the day of his risin g up ou t of the waters, when John the Precursor says of Jesus, \"After me cometh a man which is become before me!\" John 's was the voice of one c rying in the wilderness, \"Make ye ready the way of the Lord.\" \" I make way,\" says Horus, \"by what Anup (the Precur sor) has don e for me.\" The twin lunar characters of John and Jesus can be identified in the gospel where John says of Jesus \"He must i ncrease, bu t I must decrease.\" So the titl e of the Akkadian moon - god, Sin, as the increaser of light, is Enu - zu - na, the Lo rd o f waxing. In the Mithraic mysteries the light one of the twins was designated the bridegroom, and in on e passage we meet with the bridegroom and the bride, that is the lunar mother of the Twins and Christ as the bridegroom. John p ersonates the dark on e ; li ke Sut - Anup, h e is not the light it self, and on ly bears witness to the light. The Christ or Horus was consort to the mother - moon, and the reprodu cer of him self. John says of him , \"He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend o f the bridegro om which standeth and h eareth h im rejoiceth greatly beca use of the bridegroom's voice.\" These three, the bride, bridegroom, and John, are a perfect replica of the lunar Trinity. John represents the dark h alf of the moon, the c hild o f the mother only, and h e is unmi stakably identified b y Jesus in o r as this mythical character when h e says of his fore - runn er, \"Among them t hat are born o f woman there is non e greater than John, yet, h e that is but littl e in the kingdom of God is greater than h e;\" that is, among those who are re - born in the likeness of the father, as Horus was when the solar god re - begot him i n h is own im age a s the reflection o f his hidden glory reprodu ced b y the new moon -- the least of these is greater than h e who was born o f the mother alone."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"As we have seen, the fox and jackal were both of them Typhon ian types of the dark power, the thief of light i n the moon, and co - types, therefore, with the dragon that swallowed the moon du ring an eclipse. Now, the name of Herod in Syriac denotes a red dragon ; and the red d ragon in Revelation, which stands ready to d evou r the youn g child that is abou t to b e born, is the mythical form of the Herod who h as been made historical in ou r gospels. Here the legendary devou rer, the dark h alf of the lunation. The German s have a saying that the wolf is eating the ca ndle when there is what is s till called a thief in it. So the primiti ve observers s aw the dark encroaching on the light, and they said the wolf, jackal, rat, o r other sly anim al was eating the moon as the thief of its light. This is why Hermes was represented as the thief. In two d ifferent forms of the lunar mythos the jackal and the dog - headed ape were two types of this thief of the light. And in the zodiac of Denderah, just where Horus is on the c ross, o r at t he c rossing of the vernal equinox, these two thieves, Sut - Anup and Aan, are depicted on e on either side of the luni - solar god. These two mythical originals have, I think, b een continued and hu manised as the two thieves in the Gospel version o f the c rucifix ion. The c haracter of the thief still clings to the man in the moon. In a North Frisian folk - tale the man in the moon is fabled to h ave stolen b ranches of willow, o r the sallow - palm s, which h e has to carry in h is hands forever. Here we ca n identify the pal m - branch o f the man in the moon as Egyptian. The palm - branch was a type of tim e a nd p eriodicity. Hor - Apollo tells us it was adop ted as the symbol of a month, b eca use it alone produ ces one additional branch at eac h renov ation o f the moon, so that i n reckon i ng the year is completed in twelve branches. A form of this appears as the Tree of Life in the book o f Revelation. The palm - branch is carried b y Taht, the man in the moon, and scribe of the gods, who reckon ed tim e by means of the lunations, and this eviden tly survives in the Frisian legend. He who on ce reckon ed tim e by means of the shoo ts on the palm - branch beca me the picker - up o r stealer of willow - wands or sticks, acc ording to the later f olk - lore. Also, when the moon - god was s uperseded b y the sun as the tr uer reckon er of tim e, the c haracter of the lunar deity suffered d egradation! We find the same c ontention going on as there was between the number thirteen and twelve. When the year was reckon ed b y thirteen moon s of twenty - eight days eac h, thirteen was then the lucky number (a c harm of prim roses or a sitti ng of eggs was thirteen), bu t when this was changed for the twelve months of solar tim e, then the number thirteen b eca me unlucky or acc ursed. The day of rest being changed from Saturday, the old lunar god w as charged with b eing a Sabbath - breaker. He stole sticks, h e strewed brambles and thorn - bushes on the paths of people who went to church on Sund ay (the day of the Sun). He did no t keep the day of rest, bu t would go on working, o r reckon ing tim e with h is pa lm - branch, Sund ays as well as week - days, and so h e was doo med to stand in the moon for all eternity as a warning to wicked Sabbath - breakers. Taht (or Khun su) is the Egyptian man in the moon, who in the dark half of the period was represented b y the dog - hea ded ape; and from t hese ca me our man in the moon with h is dog. The Creek Indians have the same myth. They say the inhabitants of the moon consist of a man and h is dog. The a ss was another Typhon ian type of the moon. In an Egyptian representation, it i s by the a id o f the a ss - headed god Aai that the solar divinity ascends from t he und er - world where the dark po wers have their tim e of triumph ov er him by night. The a ss is"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"pou rtrayed in the ac t of hauling up the sun - god with a rope from t he region b elow. That is one mode of expressing the fact that the moon h ere represented b y the a ss was the helper of the sun b y night, in h is battle a gainst the powers of darkness -- gave him a lift up, o r, it may be, a ride. Again, in the Persian form of the lunar myth, it i s the ass that stands on three legs in the mi dst of the waters, who is the a ssistant of Sothis, the dogstar, in k eeping tim e. The three legs of the a ss are a figure of the moon in its three phases of ten d ays eac h, like the three legs of the frog in the Chinese myth. Also, the head o f the a ss is an Egyptian h ieroglyphic sign which h as the numeral value of thirty, o r a soli - lunar month. Thus we find the a ss fighting on the side of the sun b y night in the Egyptian mythos, and against the waters of the deluge, as a tim ekeeper in the Persian legend. In the Hebrew version the jaw - bon e of the a ss, a type of great strength, b ecomes the weapon o f power with which Samson slays the Philistines, o r fights the sun - god's battle by night against his enemi es that lurk in d arknes s. The a ss, as a lunar type, was also represented as the bearer of the solar Messiah, just as the c ow carries the sun b etween h er horns as reprodu cer of his light in the moon. The moon at full was the genetrix und er either type. The lessening, waning moon was her colt -- the foal of an ass. The new moon, as the youn g lord o f light, came riding in h is triumph on the a ss, as the new moon on the dark o rb o f the old mother - moon ! Now, in the a pocryphal gospel of James, called the Protevangelium, the virgin Mary is described as riding on the a ss when Joseph sees her laughing on on e side of her face , and crying or being sad on the other! Which correspond s to the light and d ark halves of the moon. She is lifted from t he a ss to give birth to the c hild o f light in the C ave. In the Greek myth Hephaistos ascends from t he und er - world riding on the a ss, the wine - god h aving made him drunk b efore leading him up to h eaven. In the Hebrew version the Shiloh is to come, b inding his ass to the vine, h is eyes red with wine, h is garm ents drenched in the blood o f the grape, and h e is as obv iously drunk as Hephaistos. This im agery was s et i n the planisphere, ages before our era, as the fore - figure a nd proph ecy of that which was to b e fulfilled in the Christian h istory, acc ording to the canon ical gospels! Now it can b e seen how the Messiah may be said to come riding on an ass, and upon a c olt, the foal of an ass, althou gh it i s pitiful enou gh to give one the heartache, to expose the mi serable pretences und er which this mythical Messiah h a s been masked in hu man form, and made to pu t on the ca st - off clothing of the pagan gods, and play their parts once more; this tim e to p rove the real presence of a god in the world. It was as the mother - moon that Ishtar of Akkad was designated \"Godd ess Fift een,\" -- she being named from t he full m oon in a month o f thirty days. The same fact is s ignified in the Egyptian Ritual (ch. 80 ), when the Woman o f the moon at full orb exclaim s, -- \"I have made the e ye of Horus (the mi rror of light), when it was not comi ng o n the festival of the 15th d ay.\" She is the Egyptian form of the the swallower of the moon, is im personated as a Jewish ruler who comm ands all t he inno cent littl e ones to b e murdered in o rder that he may include the c hild - Christ reborn for the overthrow of him who can on ly rule in the kingdom of darkness. Now, if we bear in mi nd that fox, jackal, wolf, and d ragon are equally Typhon ian types of the e vil one, the destroyer, we may possibly interpret a particular epithet applied to Herod, the destroyer, b y the Christ in the gospel acc ording to Luke.

Having identified Herod, the mythical m onster, with the dragon, and as the fox, we may carry the parallel a littl e farther, and p erhaps identify him as the traditional m urderer of John ! As already shown, in the Christian continuation o f the legend, John takes the place of Taht - Aan, the dark on e of the lunar twins. Jo hn and Jesus are e quivalent to Aan and Horus. In the Apocryphal or Legendary Lore, John is often identified with and identified as the prim ary Messiah! He is s o in the Apocryphal Gospel of James. In this, Herod is seeking the life of the Divine c hild, and he sends his s ervants to k ill John. We read that \"Herod sought after John, and sent his s ervant to Zachariah saying, 'Where hast thou hidden thy son?' and Herod said 'his s on is going to b e the King of Israel.\" Here it i s John who is to b e the infant Messi ah whose life is s ought by the destroyer Herod, and the fact, acc ording to the true mythos, is that John represents the first and that one of the lunar twins whom Herod, o r the Typhon ian d evou rer, do es put an end to, b eca use he personates the dark h alf of the lunation, the waning, lessening moon, that darkens down and d ies. In the Zodiac of Denderah we see the figure of Anup pou rtrayed with h is head cut off; and I doub t not that the deca pitated Aan o r Anup is the prototype of the Gospel John who was beheade d b y Herod. In the planisphere Anup stands headless just abov e the river of the Waterman, the Greek Eridanus, Egyptian Iarutana, the Hebrew Jordan; and we a re told that the Mandaites, who were a mongst the followers of John, h ad a tradition that the river J ordan ran red with the blood which flowed from t he headless bod y of John. As I have previously pointed ou t, the Christ of the Gospel acc ording to Luke has s everal features in comm on with the moon - god Khun su, the healer of lunatics and p ersons possessed, wh o was likewise lord ov er the pig, a type of Typhon, the e vil power. Khun su followed Taht, as child o f the sun and moon, after Taht had b een, so to say, divinized into invisibilit y. Taht - Khun su is the visible representative, who registers the decrees of the hidden Deity, Amen - Ra, the god who seeth in secret. He is particularly the god o f health and long life. It is s aid that he gives years to those whom he c hoo ses, solicits the superior powers for an extension o f the lease of life, o r \"asks years\" for whomso ever he likes, and increases life in fulness and in length for those who do h is will! \"Life c omes from him , health is in h im , Khun su - Taht, the reckon er of tim e.\" This is beca use he personated that renewal of light and tim e which was monthly in the moon. Kh unsu is the supreme healer amongst the Egyptian gods, more e specially as the ca ster - out of demons and exorciser of evil spirits. He is called the driver - away of obsessing influences, the great god, chaser of possessors, and is literally the lunar deity who cures what are now termed lunatics. And it i s in this character that the Christ of Luke is particularly portrayed.

In the Ute mythology, the Hero, as divine teac her of men, sits on the summit of a moun tain to think. He says repeatedly, -- \"I sat on the top o f a moun tain, and d id think. \" In the Egyptian Mythos, p reserved b y the Gnostics, Hermes is the divine teac her, who no t only thinks, bu t preac hes the Sermon on the Moun t. The transfiguration o f O siris in the moun t of the moon o ccurred upon the 6th d ay of the new moon. This ascent of the lunar moon after six days is repeated in ou r gospels, and can b e paralleled in a myth o f the Buddh a's transfiguration on the moun t. Here, the six glories of the Bu ddh a's head shon e out with a radiance that blinded the sight of mortals and op ened the spirit - vision, so that men could see spirits and spirits could see men. It was on the moun t of the moon that Satan shewed Jesus all t he kingdoms of the world and the glo ry of them, and at that height it m ay not have been n ece ssary for him t o h ave shewn them, as was explained b y a German critic, \"in a map.\" In Buddh a's first temptation the dark M√¢ra ca uses the ea rth to turn round, like the potter's wheel, for him t o see a l l the kingdoms of the world, and h e promi ses him t hat he shall rule the whole four quarters! The quarters are lunar. By comparing the various myths with the Gospel versions, we find that Sut and Horus = Satan and Jesus. Anup and Horus = John and Jesus. T he Doub le Horus = Two - fold Christ. Khun su = Christ The French retain a tradition that t he man in the moon is Judas Iscariot, who was transported there for his treason to the Light of the World. But that story is pre - Christian, and was told at least some 6 ,000 years ago o f Osiris and the Egyptian Judas, Sut, who was born twin with h im of one mother, and who b etrayed h im , at the Last Supp er, into the hands of the 72 Sami , o r conspirators, who pu t him t o d eath.

The Roman Church, withou t being in any wise a shamed o f the proof, pou rtrays the Virgin Mary arrayed with the sun, and the horned moon at her f eet, ho lding the lunar infant in h er arms -- as child and con sort of the mother moon ! The mother, child, and adult m ale, are fund amental; and, as Didron shows, God the Father hardly obtains a place in the Christian Icono graphy for nearly 1200 years. In this way it can b e proved that our Christology is mummi fied myth ology, and legendary lore, which h ave been p alm ed o ff upon u s in the Old Testament and the New, as divine revelation u ttered b y the very voice of God.

It is just as easy to prove that an h istoric Christianity never existed as it i s to d emonstrate that the mermaid, o r the moon - calf, the sphinx, or the centaur, n ever live d. That is, b y showing how they were c omposed as chim eras, and what they were intended for as ideographic types that never did, and n ever could, h ave a place , in n atural history. For example, Pliny in h is natural history describes the moon - calf as a monste r that is engendered b y a woman on ly. This chim era of superstiti on was originally the a morphou s child o f the mother - moon, when represented b y the c ow that gave birth to the moon - calf. This moon - calf had the same origin and b irth in ph enomena a s any other c hild o f the Virgin Mother; and the mythical Christ is equally the monster, o r chim era, that i s engendered o f the woman on ly. This is ackno wledged when certain o f the Christian Fathers accoun ted for the virgin motherhood o f the historical Jesus, b y assertin g that certain females, like the vulture, could conceive withou t the male. For the vulture was the Egyptian type of the virgin - mother, Neith, who bo asts in the inscription at Sais, that she did b ring forth withou t the male! Hor - Apollo explains that the Egy ptians delineated a vulture to signify the mother, b eca use there is no male in this kind o f creature, the female being im pregnated b y the wind -- the wind that becomes the Holy Ghost, or gust, when Mary was overshadowed and insufflated.

The other side of this desire for truth is a passionate hostilit y to those who are e ngaged in im posing this s ystem of false teac hing and swindle of salvation upon the ignorant and inno cent at t he national expense.

Writers wh o talk abou t m ythology being a \"disease of language,\" and kno w nothing of the gods as Celestial Intelligencers and tim e - keepers for men -- chief of which was the sun, when the solar year had b een made out; still earlier, the moon in its various phases -- can l end u s no aid in p enetrating the secrets of this ancient science. \"Solar - worship\" is good enou gh for them, bu t it will not explain mythology to u s, o r to itself. The c hild o f the sun, re - born as Lord o f Light in the moon, h as never come within the range of their vision. Yet it i s the sim ple fact i n n atural phenomena, which was represented mythically as the mode of making it kno wn, o f teac hing it by means of the Gnosis or science of kno wledge, as one of the mysteries, so soon as the discovery had once been m ade; and this is one of the most im portant of all t he factors in mythology. I would suggest t o Mr. Gladstone that t he Greek Apollo is the same soli - lunar personification as is Thoth (Taht or Tehuti), and Khun su (or the soli - lunar Horus), this is, the c hild of the supreme divinity in Egypt, the solar Ra, as his light by night -- whilst he him self is the god who is hidden from sight in the und er - world -- his vice - dieu o f the dark. Apollo is designated Lukgenes, o r light - born. He is the im age of the solar deity, t he reflection o f his glory in the lunar disk. Every phase of character in which Apollo appears, especially as represented b y Homer, can b e identified as pertaining to the male moon - god in Egypt, and the c omm on b asis of all m ay be found in those natural phe nomena which are indicated in p revious pages. In these natural phenomena, there is a c omm on source, or found ation, to which the functions and attributes of Apollo and Taht (or the lunar Horus) can b e referred, and b y which the characters may be satisfactor ily explained. The relationships of Apollo to Zeus, are exactly like those of Taht to Osiris, the supreme being. It is Taht who gives the Ma - Kheru, o r Word o f Truth, to the sun - god h im self. As representative of Ra, his lunar logos, his light in the darknes s, h e is the Word whose promi se is fulfilled and made truth b y the Supreme Being, the sun that vivifies and v erifies for ever. By his Word, h e drives the enemi es from t he solar horizon, the insurgent powers of darkness which are fighting eternally against Ra. This is the c haracter of Apollo as the defender of heaven against every assault. These powers of darkness, continually in revolt, ever warring with the sun, were ca lled the giants which Taht - Khun su, the giant - killer, slays by night, o r during the lunar eclipse. Apollo also figures as the destroyer of the giants who were a t war with heaven. It is s aid in the Egyptian texts that Ra c reated this god, Taht, as \"a beautiful li ght to show the name of his evil enemy,\" i.e., Sut - Typhon, the e ternal enemy of the sun. He held up the lamp b y night that m ade the darkness visible; showed the name, the face , the personal presence, o f his lurking foe. This also is a c haracter of Apollo, as a representative a nd k ind o f deputy providence for Zeus. Apollo is god o f the bo w! Taht carries the bow of the c rescent m oon upon h is head! Now the hero in the folk - tales who is always s ucce ssful in d rawing the great bow in the trial where a ll his competitors fail, is this god o f the new moon, who alone can bend the bow, or bring the orb to the full circle of light once more. He ca n b e identified in the Hindu form of the Mythos as Krishna \"with the Bow of Hari.\" The c rescent on the head o f Taht is the bow prepared and ready to b e drawn to the full against the power of night, and every form of evil t hat dwells in the darkness. Thus the lunar representative of Ra, with"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"the bow of the youn g moon on h is head, who p repares it m onth after month, and d raws it to the full circle night after night, may be ca lled the preparer of bows; and in Egyp tian the name Apuru signifies a preparer of bows; it also means the Guide a nd Herald. As the u in Egyptian stands for o, and r for l, we have Apuru=Apollo; the preparer of bows=the god of the bow as male divinity of the moon, who was the offspring of the s un and moon, the bowman o f the solar god. Mr. Gladstone doub ts whether the root of Apollo is Greek, and says he would no t be surprised to find it Eastern. All t he e vidence tends to p rove it Egyptian b y nature a nd b y name. Apollo is the god o f kno wledge, p a st, p resent, and to come; Taht is the deity of kno wledge, p ast, p resent, and future -- the found er of science, lord o f the divine words, and secretary of the gods. Apollo is the god o f poetry and music. So was Taht. He is the psalmi st and singer; he is fable d to h ave torn ou t the sinews of Sut - Typhon to form t he lyre -- the lyre or harp with seven strings being an im age of the new moon, like the bow. Apollo was the god o f healing. Taht is the supreme physician and h ealer; \"He who is the good Saviour,\" as it i s written on a statue in the Leyden Museum. Apollo was the bringer of death in a form t hat was s erene a nd b eautiful, as beca me the lunar Lord o f light, and enlarger of the lunar light to the full, -- the c haracter and function b eing afterwards applied to the l ight of life that suffered the passing eclipse of death. One name of Taht is Tekh, which signifies to b e full! Of course the Greeks did no t sim ply take over the Egyptian mythology intact, no r did they preserve the descent quite pure on any single line. In re - applying the legendary lore, derived from Egypt, to the same phenomena in n ature, there would b e c onsiderable mi xture, amalgamation, change of name, and consequent confusion. The blind Horus of Egypt reappears as the blind Orion in the Greek mythos. Thi s is as certain as that the constellation o f Orion, the star of Horus, was named Orion after Horus! His lunar relationship is s hown b y the recovery of his s ight on exposing his eyeballs to the rays of the rising sun, -- just as the e ye of Horus was restored to h im t hrough the return o f light at dawn. Horus in h is lunar character is one with Taht and Khun su in the other cults; that is, the lunar child may be Horus as s on o f Osiris, o r Taht as the offspring of Ra, o r Khun su as the c hild o f Amen; the myth b eing one in d ifferent religions. It follows that so far as Orion is identical with Horus he is also, o r once was, identical in character with the lunar Apollo, and therefore like him of twin - birth with Artemi s. Links of this lunar relationship remain. He lives and hun ts along with Artemi s when h is s ight has been recovered. He was beloved b y Artemi s and slain b y her beca use he made a n attempt upon h er chastity -- which is a c omm on charge brought against the man in the moon mythology! The bringing on o f the lunar my thos upon two d ifferent li nes of descent, Apollo b eing a continuation o f Taht - Khun su, and Orion o f Horus, would acc oun t for the later mi xture in the relationship o f the various personations -- the fact in n ature being represented und er different names for th e same c haracter in mythology, as it had b een p reviously in Egypt.

The religious s entim ent did no t originate in p rocreation for thi s life, bu t in reprodu ction for the next; and the true sacredness was conferred on the ca irns, mound s, n avels, and bosom - shaped h ills by the burial of the Dead. For it i s certain that these types of birth whether found in Nature or erected b y Art, are a sso ciated in all l ands with the place s of burial, o r they constitute the sepulchre itself, just as the Church is s till t he burial - place , o r stands ami d the Graves of the Dead. Hottentot or British Cairns, Indian Navel - Mound s, Hindu Dagobas, Irish Round Towers , and Egyptian Pyrami ds and Obelisks, with the Teba or female Ark at the base, were a ll erected with on e meaning, and eac h acc ording to the same primiti ve typology of a resurrection. \"Going to the Stones\" prece ded going to Church, and the people went to th em beca use their dead were buried in o r around these, the ea rliest Shrines. The Memorial Stones were sacred to the dead from t he first, as the latest grave - stone is to - day. Some of the stones were ca rried from l and to land and called the Bringers of Imm ort ality. In suppo rt of my theory that the Phallic Imagery was perpetuated for symbolic uses, and no t for direct worship, I would po int to the Umbilicus or Navel type, which, for aught we kno w to the contrary, may be ea rlier than the Phallic or Sexual Images, beca use the Navel unites both sexes und er one sign.

This Natural Genesis will li kewise acc oun t for the Mythical Great Mother, who was the earliest of all Divinities in all l ands, -- being portrayed in the im age of the reprodu cer that unites both Father and Mother in on e person, and who survives to - day as the Mother - Church. Moreover, the e mblems buried with the dead from t he ea rliest tim es are ideographic symbols of perpetuation and reprodu ction for the life to come. The figure of an eye was comm on in the tombs of Egypt. The name of it, \"Uta,\" signifies s alvation; and to b e saved was to b e preserved as a mumm y waiting to b e reprodu ced o r transformed for another life. The e ye being a mi rror that reflects the im age, it was adop ted as a type of repetiti on and reprodu ction. Thus the Eye of Horus is the Mother of Horus, and the shoo t of new life in the potato comes from t he \"eye\" -- as the place of reprodu ction. One word serves for both eye a nd seed in the Ute l anguage. The Egyptians fed the e ye with o il. And filli ng the \"Eye of Horus\" is s ynon ymous with b ringing an o ffering of sacred o il. The e ye being the lamp o f light to the bod y, it was s upp lied with that which would p rodu ce a nd reprodu ce the light. Thus, b y aid o f Egypt, we ca n und erstand why the primiti ve race in Britain, and still further north, were acc ustomed to fill t he c ups and eyes carved on the cap - stones that covered their buried d ead with o fferings of fat. They were filli ng the lamp of light for the gloom of the grave, and feeding the e ye a s an emblem of r epetiti on o r reprodu ction. The symbolism still survives when candles are place d in the hands of the corpse, o r left with the dead in the tomb. And in ancient Egypt t he ca ndle was synon ymous with rep rodu ction. It is an extant custom, bo th with the Kaffirs and the English, to cut the hair fr om t he tail of a ca lf when it i s being weaned, and stuff it i nto the ea r of its mother. The hair being a symbol of reprodu ction, the ac tion d enotes a desire for ple nty of mil k o r future progeny, whilst stuffing it i nto the ea r signifies a wish that the prayer may be heard. A drink on the morning after being intoxicated is called \"a hair of the dog that bit you\"! This means a repetiti on o f the dose; and as a symbol of reprodu ction, h air, in on e shape or another, was buried with the dead. Of course the prim ary type of hair is the skin -- in which the dead were wrapped for preservation, transformation, and rebirth. In the Egyptian Ritual the decea sed says to h is God, \"Thou makest for me a skin.\" This God is characterized as the \"Lord o f the numerous transformations of the skin,\" which h ad b ecome a type of renewal, on acc oun t of its s hedding and renewing the hair. The skin is needed b eca use he has to pass the waylayers who c ause a nnihilation to those who are e nveloped. The later shoe, following the skin, is also a type of renewal and reprodu ction; as s uch it was place d on the feet of the dead, and is s till t hrown for good luck after the newly married p air -- good"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"luck meaning p lenty of progeny. The horn o f the stag or reindeer was likewise a type of renewal, comi ng of itself, as does the hair of the skin. Hor - Apollo tells us the stag's horn was a symbol of permanence, b eca use of its annu al self - reprodu ction. And when the Greenla nder has s uffered from an exhausting illness, and h e recovers his health, h e is s aid to h ave lost his former soul, and to h ave had it replace d b y that of a youn g child o r a reindeer.

In all li kelihood the Dog was the first anim al to come und er the domi nion o f man, h is earliest four - footed friend; his prim ary ally in the work o f progress and civilization. He hun ted for the men o f the Kitchen - mi ddens; he was the guide a nd guard o f man in the pal√¶olithic a ge, and h e was s acrificed to b ecome the typical guide of the poo r cave - dwellers when they got benighted in the dark o f death. The bon es of the dog have been found bu ried with the human skeleton in a very ancient cave of the Pyrenees; in Belgium; and in Britain; showi ng that at a period most remote the dog was look ed upon as a kind o f Psychopo mpus, an intelligent shower of the way, like Sut - Anup, the golden do g or jackal of Egypt, and Hermes in Greece , -- the Dog - star in the dark o f death -- a guide to show the way. \"I hav e provided myself with a dog 's head, \" says the Egyptian d ecea sed in p assing through the 10th gate of Elysium. In like manner English b ishop s used to b e buried with a dog at their f eet in the c offin. They, too, were provided with a dog's head -- or a dog to s how them t he way! Of course the dog would no t have been n eeded as a typical guide to show them t he way if it had no t been b elieved o r assumed that there was a way through the dark v alley of the dead! This conclusion that there was a doo r on the other side of the grave -- as proved b y the types and customs -- had b een reac hed b y the men o f the bon e - caves in all probabilit y more than 50,000 years ago! How, then, d id p rimiti ve or archaic man attain that certainty of foothold in the dark vo id im plied b y these buri al customs, and this typology of the tomb, which certainly was felt by many of the pre - historic race s, including the Black Man, the Maori, and the Red Man, who h as no doub t abou t li ving on in h is happy hun ting g round s abov e? whereas s o many of our own race to - day are still t rying mentally to take that step in the dark, and stumble, beca use they can find n either f oothold no r stair.

The nebulosity of metaphysic is altogether a later produ ct.

The pretensions and im postures of modern theology have tended to make these sim ple naturalists of the past lo ok like im postors too, althou gh they were not; at least they are not in the e yes of those who are ac quainted with the a bno rmal phenomena occurring in ou r own tim e, which enable us to und erstand the same phenomena a s a factor of kno wledge a nd religion in th e past. I say kno wledge, for in h is way pre - historic man was a Gnostic; and the Gnostics found ed their religion from the first upon kno wledge. By means of kno wledge they attained their truth. It appears as first sight as if the a ncients, h aving identified the intelligence or nou s in man, thou ght it could b e fed forever by the kno wledge acc umulated in this life. The Esoteric Buddh ist still expects a perpetuity of existence by means of kno wledge, o r the Gnosis. In the Egyptian Book o f the Dead the decea sed ma kes his way from stage to stage of his progress by what he kno ws. He a sserts his right of way by proclaimi ng: \"I am t he one who kno ws,\" \"I am the Gnostic,\" \"I have c ome,\" he e xclaim s, \"having the writing\" -- the proof. Certain p apyri assured a passage, and \" prevailing by his papyrus,\" like Christian with h is roll, is a titl e of the decea sed. If he kno ws the first chapter of the Ritual in this life the spirit of the decea sed can come forth every day as he wishes, and no t be turned back, i.e., if he possesses t he kno wledge of facts, which were demonstrated b y the a ncient Spiritualism. He is s hown in the process of creating his eternal soul, b y means of the Gnosis, o r book s of kno wledge, those of Taht - Hermes. He c ries: \"Let m e c ome! Let m e spiritualise myself! Le t m e make myself into a soul! Prevail and p repare myself by the writings of Hermes!\" or the Gnosis. The imm ortal nature of the Soul having been d emonstrated in the Mysteries, a kno wledge of those Mysteries was s ufficient to ensure a safe passage through th e dark o f death, and a sure triumph ov er all oppo sing powers, to those who h ad no t the Vision. \"By means of wisdom,\" says the wise man in the Apocrypha, \"I shall attain imm ortality;\" and \"to b e a llied into Wisdom i s imm ortality.\" To know was s alvation. Acq uiring this wisdom i s described in Revelation as eating a littl e book on pu rpose to b e in the spirit -- or be born again in the spirit, o r in the Christ, as Paul has it -- or to p roph esy, o r to kno w how to b e e ntranced, and enter spirit - world as a spirit, for that is the ultim ate fact. Iren√¶us says of the Gnostics: \"They affirm t hat the Inner and Spiritual m an is redeemed b y means of kno wledge, and that they, h aving acquired the kno wledge of all t hings, stand in n eed of nothing else, for this is the true redemp tion, \" hence they repud iated the Christian Salvation b y faith. (Iren√¶us, B. I., chap. xx i. 4. ) \"The souls which po ssessed the saving seed o f Wisdom were c onsidered superior to all others, and the Gnostics held these to b e"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"the souls of proph ets, k ings, and priests, who were c onsequently endo wed with a nature loftily transcendent.

I., chap. xx i. 2. ) In ou r day such p ersons are sometim es called Mediums or Sensitives; in India they are the Adepts in the most hidden mysteries. But this Gnosis by which the decea sed in the Ritual prevailed over the des troyers of form, the e xtinguishers of breath, eclipsers of the a stral shade, o r the stealers of memory -- for these a re a mong the devou rers named -- this gnosis of redemption and salvation, the gnosis of endu ring life, was not m erely information o r kno wledge i n ou r modern sense. It was the gnosis of the mysteries, and all t hat was therein represented. The a ncient wisdom (unlike the modern) included a kno wledge of trance - cond itions, from which was derived the Egyptian do ctrine of spiritual transformation. This p assed on into the Christian do ctrine of conv ersion, and then the fund amental facts were lost sight of, o r cast out and don e with. The a depts had learned how to transform t hemselves into spirits, and enter spirit - world as s pirits among spirits, or as was s o metim es s aid in the Totemi c transformations, to enter the bod ies of beasts -- a survival of which we have in the Were - wolf. Hermes describes the a bno rmal, o r trance - cond ition, as a divine silence, and the rest of all t he senses! He says: \"It looseth the soul from t he bod ily senses and motions, it draweth it from t he bod y, and changeth it wholly into the e ssence of a god. \" Then, says Hermes, \"the soul cometh to the eighth nature, and having its proper power, it can conv erse (or enter into spiritual intercourse ) with the powers that are a bov e the e ighth n ature.\" So Nirvana becomes a present possession to the Esoteric Buddh ist, beca use in trance he ca n enter the e ternal state. This Gnosis included that m ystery of transformation which was the c hange spok en o f by P aul, when h e e xclaim ed -- \"Behold, I tell you a mystery,\" \" We shall not entirely sleep, we shall be transformed!\" acc ording to the mystery that was revealed to h im i n the state of trance. This was the transformation which finally established the e xistence of a spiritual entity that could b e detached, more or less, from t he bod ily cond itions for the tim e being in life, and, as was finally held, for evermore in d eath. This mystery of regeneration was visibly enacted in life, and taught by the transformers in th e ea rly Totemi c, and later religious, mysteries. Now, in d iscussing the origin o f r eligious \"ideas,\" writers, as a rule, kno w nothing whatever of this rootage in the mysteries of abno rmal experience; whereas it i s im possible to d etermi ne a nything fund ament al until t his dark continent has been explored by those who h ave a dequate kno wledge of the facts that were famili ar to the primiti ve race s of men, and upon which the Gnostic religions were universally found ed. Bastian tells us how the African Cazembe, o r f etish - priest, regards him self as Imm ortal by reason o f this power of transformation in trance. The Dacotah medicine - men can transform t hemselves, and enter into conscious relationship and alliance with mi ghty spirits, whose powers they are thus able to mak e their own. They can also summ on spirits, and compel them t o appear f or others to see. The Egyptian Magi, the wise men and pu re Intelligences, h ave the Ph≈ìnix, the bird o f transformation in d eath, for their ideographic sign, which shows that the ultim ate nature of their wisdom, as s eers or magi,"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"was based on these a bno rmal cond itions of seership!

He will reply that he lives by kno wledge, and walks by the open sight; and that another life is thus demonstrated to h im i n this. As for death, the practical Gnostic will t ell you, h e se es through it, and d eath itself is no more for him ! Such h ave no doub t, b eca use they kno w. The Mosaic a nd o ther sacred writings contain no annun ciation of a mere doctrine of imm ortality, and the fact has excited constant wond er amongst the uninstructed. Bu t the subject was not told o f old, as matter of written p rece pts, bu t as matter of f act; it was a natural reality, no t a manufactured idealism. It was not t he promi se of imm ortality that was s et forth, o r needed, when a demonstration was considered attaina ble in the mysteries of the a bno rmal human cond itions, which were once c omm on enou gh to b e c onsidered a kno wn p art of nature! You h ave got the Mosaic writings, bu t withou t the older facts that were c oncea led at their found ations.

In India to - day the stage of perfect adultship inc ludes, even if it does not absolutely consist in, the power of transformation which o ccurs in trance, o r in the perfect blending of the normal and abno rmal faculties, so that, like Swedenbo rg, the Adepts can live a nd move a nd h ave their being in two worlds at once. It was by this transformation that our predece ssors of thou sands of years ago d iscovered their imm ortal soul, o r link o f continuity, through spirit - awakenment, produ ced consciously by various method s of attaining the trance c ond itions. And in thi s way the dust of death was first set a - sparkle, and the gloom of the grave was brightened, and grew transparent, with the lumi nou s form of what the Egyptians called the Osirified decea sed, o r the Ka im age of the spiritual self, the glorified Eidolon o f ma n, which was visible to their seers in this life. None but a Spiritualist can po ssibly comprehend the customs, p ractices, and b eliefs of the primiti ve Spiritualists in tim es past. They were genuine interrogators of Nature, ho wever limit ed their kno wledge. But they made much of that which the science of to - day is inclined to make so littl e of, o r to pooh - pooh altogether in its ignorance of the value of the pre - historic past of man, and the found ation of religious beliefs. Did you ever read b y the light of a glow - worm l aid on the page of a book ? I have so read in the dark. And n ext m orning, b y the c learer light of open d ay, found my tiny lamp h ad gone out; t here was no glow w hatever; it was nothing more than a littl e gray worm! My reading must surely have been hallucination, the merest ill usion o f the night, in the face of this comm on d aylight fact, to which every person could testify, that the thing did no t shine by day! Spiritualism i s that littl e lumi nou s worm, which h as s hon e with its tiny lamp d ivinely lit through all t he darkness of the past. Many of the ea rlier race s learned to read a page or two in the Book o f Nature by the light of it. I have read some c urious leaves by means of this littl e night - light.

The ea rliest kno wn form of the priest and the proph et was the medium, o r seer. Professor Huxley is quite right in affirmi ng that, alt hou gh h e has littl e use for the fact in h is s ystem of interpretation. \"Beforetim e in Israel, when a man went to inqu ire of God, thus he spake -- 'Come, and let us go to the seer,' for he that is called a proph et was aforetim e called a seer.\" And the Lord mi g ht be c onsulted cheaply in this way for the small sum of sixpence three - farthings. They seem t o h ave paid mediums even worse then than the world do es now - a - days. Siberian Shamanism i s a survival of the most primiti ve kind o f Spiritualism, b ased on mediumsh ip and abno rmal phenomena. It has no system of r eligion o r ethics; no ritual, prece pts, o r dogmas; and no d efinite theology. The Shaman can v isit spirit - world, and the spirits can come to h im , speak through h im , o r become visible a t tim es through h is prese nce. That is its claim , and the sum - total of its pretentions. The Shaman o f the Finns indu ces the super - normal ecstasy, called the \"Tulla - intoon, \" with the ostensible object of becomi ng -- as they phrase it -- \"The likeness of the spirit t hat is in po ssession of him .\" We now consider that such transformations do constantly occur, acc ording to a likeness kno wn to the observers, which was previously unkno wn to the medium. The Tohun ga or priest of the Maoris is their medium for spirit i ntercourse. In Loango, when an adult i s abou t to adop t a new fetish im age, the Ganga or priest mesmerizes the postulant to consult him i n the trance c ond ition. He listens to the words uttered b y the ec static, and then the c hoice is determi ned b y what the somnambule says. The same pr actice is, o r was, extant among the Acageman Indians. One of the negro method s of treatm ent, says Bastian, would alm ost appear to h ave been p lagiarised from our anim al m agnetisers. In their system it i s called Dorsal m anipulation, and its purpose is to re - isolate the somnambulic subject after contact with the Cazembe or magician, and, as they say, for f ear that t he superabund ance of his magical power shou ld o therwise annihilate the victim or the subject, which look s as if they knew more than we do abou t mat ters perplexing us to - day. For this practice has the a ppearance of their being consciously engaged in returning some of the vitality of which the person h as been deprived in p rodu cing the phenomena of the a bno rmal state. The West African Indians look to th eir mediums or magicians for protection against ghosts in general, and p ay them to k eep the a pparitions away. The mediums, wizards, sorcerers, shamans, adepts, and others, who h ad the power of going out of the bod y in this life, were feared all t he more af ter death b y many tribes, b eca use they had d emonstrated some of the facts which created such fear and terror in the living; and h ad also b een their exorcists and layers of the ghost.

So was it with the inner African medicine - man -- in a sense which is only to b e und erstood b y means of the transformation and transmi gration which o ccurs in trance. We ca n addu ce proof positive that imm ortality or continuity was origina lly demonstrated b y means of these phenomena, and that in this way pre - historic man first found h is endu ring soul, beca use it was a c omm on article of f aith that only the c hiefs, the seers, p roph ets, and kings of men, could o r did ob tain imm ortality -- that i s, the men who d emonstrated it. These a re the born imm ortals, the superior souls s pok en o f by Hermes and b y the Gnostics, which po ssessed the saving seed o f wisdom within themselves; and who were of a nature loftily transcendent. There is a c lass, if not t he ea rliest class, o f chiefs or supreme beings amongst m en, who were first recognized as the e ver - living ones, the imm ortals, b eca use they were the mediums for spirit i ntercourse -- mediators between the two worlds.

Whatsoever secret Brotherhood s there may be of Hindu Mahatm as or Tibetan Ad epts, such fraternities are kno wn to b e e xtant in Africa, and they are Spiritualistic. In Cabende and Loango there a re secret associations of the Fetishmen o r mediums. They constitute a fraternity -- the brothers -- and form a society apart -- an Order, whose se crets are only kno wn to the initiated, and whose mysterious faculties are the terrors of the uninitiated. Bastian d escribes the King of Bamba a s dwelling isolated in h is ban za in an alm ost inacce ssible moun tain d istrict, at the head o f one of those systems of r eligious mystery which exercise a n ov erwhelmi ng influence a mongst the natives along the West Coast of Africa. New members are a dmitt ed into these Brotherhood s only after a probation o f ten years. They must prepare themselves by fasting, b y drinking, b y inhaling narcotics; they must give proofs of being ecstatic or mediums, b y becomi ng frantic in the sacred d ances, and b y seeing in the state of trance! These a re the Secret Societies of savage mediumship. The Red Men also h ad their brotherhood s of the a d epts. The \"Friendly Society of the Spirit\" is mentioned b y Carver. This was an association o f Spiritualists who were Mediums, Magicians, o r Fetish Priests. Carver saw an elderly member of this brotherhood throw a bean at a youn g man who was a ca ndidate for election into the society, whereupon h e instantly fell m otionless, as if he had b een shot, and remained for a long tim e in trance. One of three such societies among the American Indians is that of the Meda or Mediums; the c hief festival of the order being that of Medawin.

It evidently believes in thinness and suffering as good for them, and h as always don e its best to inspire them with sufficient starvation. It believes in pu rity by purging. Apollonius of Tyana declared that his power of proph ecy was not due to magic or s tim ulation o f the soul, bu t sim ply to h is abstinence from anim al food enhancing the rece ptive c ond itions. There have been many ways of reac hing the other world, ho wever, b esides s tarving. We kno w the Hindu s, the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Egyptians were ac quain ted with anim al magnetism. The Egyptians and Scythians also made use of Indian Hemp for their spiritual sleepers. Indian soothsayers s till prepare themselves with the sweating bath for their ecstatic c ond ition, in which the spirits make their comm unication s to the bystanders. The Malay retires to the desert to fast and p ray, in o rder that he may attain the a bno rmal cond ition. The Zulu do ctor fasts, suffers, castigates him self, till he swoon s into the state of trance in which h e ca rries on h is s pirit comm un ication. Aristoph anes wittil y ridicules spirit comm unication in representing the c owardly character Pisander as going to a Necromancer and asking to b e shown h is own soul, which h ad long since departed and left him only a breathing bod y. We a lso find that √Ülian h as a gird at the Hindu mode of indu cing the sacred sleep. He says the followers of Apis have a better method o f getting at the spirit world. Apis is an excellent interpreter of futurity. He does not employ virgins and o ld women sitti ng on a tripod, nor r equire that they shou ld b e intoxicated with the sacred po tion. In the Persian Bahman Yasht, the god Ahura - Mazda throws Zarathustra into the clairvoyante trance by giving him some magnetised water to d rink.

Whereas the travellers and mi ssionaries generally who report on their mysteries are entirely ignorant t hat spiritua l m anifestations and clairvoyante vision were natural realiti es in the past as they are verifiable in the present. For example, the Serpent - Wisdom, o r wisdom of the serpent, p layed an im portant part in the a ncient m ysteries. The \"way of a serpent\" and the workmanship are a mongst the most amazing in un iversal nature. Withou t hands it can clim b trees and catch the a gile a pe. Withou t fins it can ou tswim t he fish. It has no legs, and the human foot canno t m atch it i n fleetness. Death is in its coil for the bird on the wing, which the springing reptile will snatch ou t of its element. As a type of elemental power it has no equal; hence it was the supreme fetish in Egypt, worn as the forefront of the gods. \"Wise a s the serpent\" is a saying; but t he wisdom of the se rpent has to b e interpreted. It was not m erely the representative of elemental power, bu t of mi nd o r mental influence in the primiti ve sense. The serpent is the Mesmerist and magician o f the a nim al world. With its magnetic e yes it has the power to fascinat e, p aralyse, and d raw the prey to its deadly mouth. It probably evok ed the ea rliest idea of magical influence, and gave to man h is fist lessons in anim al magnetism. No d isk o f the Hypno tist, o r navel of Vishnu, no look o f the Mesmerist, h as any such po wer as the gaze of the serpent in indu cing the c omatose c ond ition. I have seen a sensitive person mesmerised b y it alm ost instantaneously. A traveller has described h is sensations as he sank d eeper and d eeper into the somnambulic sleep und er its fatally fascin ating influence. And when the shot was fired which arrested the serpent's charm and set him free, h e felt t he blow as if he had b een struck b y the bullet. In the Avesta the look o f the serpent is s ynon ymous with the most paralysing and d eadly oppo sition. T he serpent and charmi ng are synon ymous. In the Egyptian Ritual a deluding snake named Ruhak is the Great Charmer, o r f ascinator that draws the victim t o its mouth with the magic power of its eyes. The speaker exclaim s, \"Go b ack, Ruhak, fascinating, o r stri king cold with the e yes.\" The supreme mode of exhibiting mental power is by Magic, and that is represented as charmi ng the serpent. \"These a re the gods,\" it i s s aid in the Texts, \"who charm for Har - Khuti i n the lower world -- they charm Apap for him .\" Apap i s the giant serpent of darkness, who is the e ternal enemy of the sun. They cry, \"Oh, im pious Apap! thou art charmed b y us through the means of what is in ou r hands.\" That is, b y a magic wand carried in the hands of the c harmers. Primiti ve man must have had a long, h ard wrestle for supremacy before he c ould h ave mesmerised and mastered h is old subtle e nemy, the serpent, o r charmed h is charmer, as he learned to do at last, when h e beca me the serpent - charmer, which h e ultim ately did. Africans to - day will m agne tise a serpent with a few passes an make it stiff as a stick. And in this character we find h is figure proud ly set in h eaven, for the first star in Ophiuchus is kno wn in Arabic a s Ras - al - Haww a, the head o f the serpent - charmer. Ophiuchus is not merely the s erpent - holder, h e is the serpent - charmer. The Egyptian serpent - headed godd ess Heh is called the \"Maker of invisible e xistences apparent,\" which seems to characterise the serpent as the revealer of an un seen world -- this it was, as the magnetiser of man -- and hence the serpent type of Wisdom. Hea, the Akkadian god o f Wisdom, is represented b y the serpent.

In some a ncient drawings the serpent and the Godd ess of Wisdom are portrayed in the ac t and attit ude of offering the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge to the human b eing. Sometim es the serpent holds th e fruit i n its mouth. Africa is the prim ordial home of the serpent - wisdom, and the serpent was there made use of to p rodu ce the a bno rmal cond ition in Sensitives. The Africans tell of women b eing possessed and made insane by contact with the serpent. That i s, the reptile, from t he fascination o f its look, fear of its touch, and u se of its tongue, threw the mediums into the state of trance ca lled the stupo r of the serpent, in which they saw clairvoyantely, d ivined and p roph esied, and so b eca me divinely inspir ed, as the phenomena were interpreted. We are told that Cassandra a nd Helenus were prepared for seeing into the future by means of Serpents that cleansed the passages of their sense by licking them! In this way the sensitives were tested, and made frantic; thus the serpent chose its own o racle a nd mouthpiece a nd b eca me the revealer of preternatural kno wledge. The stupo r caused b y the serpent's s orcery created a kind o f r eligious awe, and the e xtraordinary effects produ ced on the mediums were a ttributed to t he supernatural power of the serpent! Those who were found to b e greatly affected b y it were c hosen to b ecome Fetish women, priestesses, and p ython esses. This Obea c ult still survives wherever the black race has mi grated, and the root of the matter, which travellers have found so d ifficult t o get at, is unearthed at last, as a most primiti ve kind o f Spiritualism, in which the serpent acted the part of the mesmerist or magnetizer to the natural somnambules. This I personally learned from an Initiate in the V oudou Mysteries. In v arious parts of Africa, especially on the Guinea c oast, the oracle of the serpent is a comm on institution. The reptile is kept in a small hut by an o ld woman, who feeds it, and who gives forth the respon ses when the serpent oracle is consulted. She is the medium of spirit - comm unication! In Hw ida the fetish p riests are kno wn b y a name which signifies the \"mother of the serpent.\" In a c hant of the Algonk ins it i s asked, \"Who is M anitu?\" -- or medicine man -- and the reply is, \"He that goeth with the serpent.\" The witch o f Endo r is called a woman who was mi stress of Aub. Aub is also an Assyrian word which means the serpent. In Egyptian the serpent is Ap, to b e inflated, serpent - like. In short, the witch was a python ess, a serpent - woman inspire d with the serpent wisdom of Obea or the oph ite cult. In the Hebrew book o f Genesis the serpent beguiles the woman to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, and is damned for doing so. But t here was a sect of Gnostic Christians who p aid the serpent the hi ghest honou r beca use it had don e this thing. Being Gnostics, they were ac quainted with the serpent - wisdom, and kn ew w hat t he fable signified, which is what the c ollectors and translators of those a ncient fragments never have kno wn, and so we have a c reed c alled Christian, found ed on an im pious perversion of ancient kno wledge, which teac hes that all m ankind were likewise damned b eca use the first pair tasted o f the tree of kno wledge, and all of us are a dditionally damned who do not acce pt the story as true! T he c hief sacred trees of the world, the typical trees of kno wledge, h ave a lways been those that produ ce a fruit or juice from which an alcoho lic or narcotic drink could b e distill ed on pu rpose to indu ce the somnambulic trance. The Egyptians used the juice of"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"the sycamore fig tree. Human b eings transform i nto imm ortal spirits by drinking of its juice, which is represented as a liquid o f life. In inner Africa the todd y - palm supp lied the sacred po tion already fermented; and what an amazing Tree of Knowledge th at todd y - palm m ust have been! In India the Tree of Knowledge was the Pippala, o r sacred fig tree. This fig tree is a meeting place for men and imm ortals. Under it Yama, k ing of the departed, and the Pitris, the protecting, fatherly spirits, qu affed the div ine drink in comm on with hu man b eings. From t he fruit of it a drink was made, so po tent that it not only exalted men to the status of imm ortals, and p lace d them on a footing of fellowship with the gods, bu t brought down the gods to meet with men. In o ther words, intoxication was a mode of spirit - comm unication -- the mediums being inspired b y strong drink to u tter their revelations. This is portrayed on Hindoo monu ments. It was the Tree of Knowledge, and the drink was divine just beca use it l apped the senses i n Elysium, and op ened the inner eyes to see in trance. In the Hindu d rawings you see the medium who was intoxicated, and consulted und erneath the Tree of Knowledge; she ea ts -- or drinks -- of the fruit of the tree, that her inner eyes may be opened. In the Ri g - Vda the gods are represented as obtaining imm ortality by constantly getting drunk with Amartyam Madam, the imm ortal stim ulant! They drink copiously the first thing in the morning, they are drunk b y mi d - day, and d ead d runk at night. We hear of North - Ameri can Indians who have the notion that imm ortality consists in b eing eternally dead d runk -- dead d runk b eing a primiti ve mode of expressing extreme felicity in a life beyond the present -- a kind o f paradisaical cond ition. The worshippers follow the e xample of their gods, and d rink the intoxicating soma juice to attain imm ortality. In this s tate they sing -- \"We've quaffed the Soma bright, And are imm ortal grown, We've e ntered into light, And all t he gods have kno wn.\" Exactly as it i s with the first pair of pe ople in the book o f Genesis. The Serpent informs the woman that if she will eat of the fruit of the tree their eyes s hall be opened, and they shall be a s gods, kno wing g ood from evil. And when the woman saw that it was a tree to be desired to make one wise , she did eat of it. The Wise a re the Seers in this abno rmal sense. Proph ets, seers, magi and wizards are the wise men. The prim al pair have ea ten o f the Tree of Knowledge, the Elohim or celestial spirits exclaim , \"Behold! the man h as become a s one of us,\" that is, as a spirit amongst spirits. This opening of the e yes means an un sealing of the interior vision. \"And their eyes were opened, and they knew him ,\" is said o f those who h ad seen the risen Christ. So Balaam, the man who saw in v ision, that is, in th e trance c ond ition, is described as the man whose e yes were opened; the Seer who saw the vision o f the Almi ghty, falling in trance, h aving his eyes opened. In this aspect, eating of the Tree of Knowledge was s im ply partaking of the divine drink, the drink of imm ortality, the sacred po tion o r Nepenthe, which was made a nd admi nistered in all t he mysteries, for the purpose of produ cing the a bno rmal vision in the practice of spirit - intercourse.

The Typical Tree had its religious rootage here, no t in d irect adoration, bu t in the mystery of fermentation, and attained its sacredness on acc oun t of the Divine drink. Hence the Trees could b e ve ry various, bu t the produ ct was one. We may note that Soph ia, the Greek word for wisdom, o riginally signified wine. A prior f orm of the word in Egyptian, as Sefa or Kefa, meant distilli ng and the mystery of f ermentation. Alcoho lic spirits were very promi ne nt i n p rimiti ve spiritism, b eca use they produ ced abno rmal effects! Intoxication was also a mode of illustrating the genesis of spirit -- the a lcoho lic being a type of the human p rodu ct. The facts are registered in language. In Sanskrit, Sidhu is distill ed sp irit, and Siddha means the spiritually perfected; the Siddha s being the perfect spirits. So in Egyptian, Shethu denotes s pirits of wine; Sheta is the mystery of mysteries, and the Sheta was the c offin o r sarcoph agus in which the dead transformed, o r were t urned into Spirits. In the Bacc hic Mysteries they also enacted the produ ction o f the spirit by means of f ermentation; the soul assigned to Seb, who represented the sap o f wood in Egypt, o r, as we now see, the juice of the tree that ferments and p rodu ces th e a lcoho lic spirit -- the drink that m ade men wise in the Mysteries. In the book o f Deuterono my the Jews are instructed o r comm anded to spend their savings in d rink, as an o ffering to the Deity, which shows that intoxication was also a religious rite with th em. It was this crude nature of these primiti ve practices that chiefly led to the wholesale cond emnation o f mediums, sorcerers, wizards, witches, and all who h ad famili ar spirits. It was s o in Egypt as in India; in the Persian writings as well as the Mosa ic. And these denun ciations were a nd still are acce pted as the very word o f God b y those who are ignorant of the phenomena, and who could no t distinguish the lower fr om t he higher, saintly from satanic, o r black magic from white. Thus, on acc oun t of certai n early practices, Spiritualism was damned altogether, instead o f being fathomed and explained. Our customs of drinking strong liquo rs, snuffing most potent powders, and smoking narcotic herbs, which are now besotting and d egrading the race -- so much so tha t our protoplasm and p rotozoa have to come into b eing half - fudd led with n icotine -- so that our children are doo med b y heredity to b ecome smokers and d rinkers, withou t being allowed the c hance of making a fresh start for themselves -- these very customs have b een bequeathed to u s as s acred survivals from t he tim es when the trance - cond itions were indu ced b y such means! Again, the universal customs of Transformi ng, o f Masking and Mummi ng, are related to the mysteries of ancient spiritism. In Egyptian the word mum , whence the name of mumm y, means the dead bod y. We have the identical word and meaning in English, applied to a beer called \"mum - beer,\" which was not taxed b eca use it i s non - alcoho lic, unfermented, spiritless, or dead b eer, i.e., mum - bear. This is not so called, as s ome have suggested, from a man n amed Mumm er, who was once famous for his brew of strong ale. Our mumm ers used to go abou t in masks and \"mum\" by making sound s with closed lips. The two sexes exchanged d resses with eac h other, as a part of the tr ansformation that was being enacted b y the mumm ers, who represented the dead come back in d isguise to p ay a visit t o the living. The a nnu al masking still practised b y our children abou t the tim e of \"All - Soul's day,\" is a survival of"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"this primiti ve pantomim e, in which the masks s ignify the spirits of the dead o r the mummi es. The institution o f \"All Souls\" is a most ancient ceremonial festival of the dead. It is celebrated in many lands, and is comm on to the most diverse race s of mankind. On a certain d ay aft er the Autumn equinox the spirits of all t hose (all souls) who h ad d ied during the year were suppo sed to gather together at an appo inted p lace in the West to follow their leader, the red sun o f Autumn, do wn through the und er - world, o r across the horizon o f the resurrection. When such mysteries were performed, those who acted the part of spirits did so in masks, and therefore masks s till m ean the dead, the mummi es or spirits. The modern p astim e was an earlier r eligious mystery. In the genuine Christm as Panto mim e we have a n extant ill ustration o f this primiti ve masking and mummi ng, which belonged to the drama of the dead, even as we find it i n the Egyptian Ritual. In those subterranean scenes of the Pantomim e we a re really in the Egyptian Meska, the re - birthpl ace of the dead, where the transformations into the new life were represented; and the Meska is the original Mask as place of transformation, mode of transformation, o r symbol of transformation. The pivot of the pantomim e on which all t urns is the principl e of transformation. The transformation is from t he lower world o f the dead, the place of the mummi es or masks -- hence the giants, d warfs, fairies, gnomes, b ad spirits, and o ther types of the e lemental powers, that were represented earlier than hu man spirit s -- to the daylight world o f life, light, and liberty, no w represented b y fun, frolic, and lawlessness. Harlequin is the potent t ransformer, who wields the wond er - working wand. With h is mask do wn h e is invisible; another proof that the masks represent the d ead o r the spirits. The final transformation scene represents heaven; the upp er world o f three. The mask, then, is the face of the dead, and the death - mask o f the Siberian Shaman was preserved and hun g up in h is late residence, just abov e the place where h e used to sit. In New Britain the natives perform a religious ceremony called the \"duk - duk, \" in which a spirit - messenger is represented as comi ng in a mask. The women and children are prohibited from seeing the mask, and they must not say that it concea ls any human b eing. If the performer allows the mask to slip o ff, they kill and make a ghost of him . Masks in anim al forms and fashions represent the nature - powers or the Totemi c a nd typical ancestors, bu t the human mask assuredly stands for a human spirit. A nd the e ndeavor to represent this can b e trace d from t he rudest beginnings. In some instances the human face has been flayed from t he bon es, and transferred to form t he mask o f a fetish im age. The a borigines of Bolivia a nd Brazil used to take off the face and scalp from t he skull, and reduce them to a mi niature mask o f humanity, suppo sed to po ssess s upernatural properties, and to furnish a most potent m edicine. The Maori, amongst others, learned to d essicate the head and p reserve it i n its own skin, on the way to complete mummi fying of the c orpse. Before the mumm y could b e e mbalm ed entirely the skull was s acredly saved, and sometim es the flesh was imit ated b y coating it with a mask made of reddish matter. We a re now for the first tim e in a position to appreh end the meaning of the mumm y - im age, and to appreciate the motive of the Egyptians, who p ractised the a rt of embalmi ng the dead un til it was absolutely perfected. The Mumm y or corpse was the dead mask which h ad b een let fall from t he face of life by the per son who h ad transformed, and this was faithfully preserved, b eca use it was the mortal li keness of the person who h ad transformed and b ecome a spirit!"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"In the prim ary stage a nd rudest cond itions of the human race , the returning g host was naturally an ob ject of terror and d read, the representative of all t hat was most fearsome in external phenomena; not in the least li kely to evok e, althou gh it helped to u ltim ately evolve, a feeling of reverence, which led to some kind o f worship; and a long road h ad to be tra veled from t he ea rliest period, when the ghost was besought and p ropitiated not to appear, up to the tim e when the bon es of the dead were kept in the hou se or chest, and the mask o r mumm y was s acredly preserved on pu rpose to secure the presence of the ghos t as a protection for the living relatives -- whence the lares and penates, and o ther forms of the hou sehold gods. Doub tless, it t ook a very long tim e to u tili se the ghost, o r fully make out it s message to man. But that stage had b een traveled b y the Egyptia ns when they first come into v iew. It is certain that from t he ea rliest m onu mental period, and, p robably, ages before that, the Egyptians represented man to b e what is termed an imm ortal spirit. The text of the 130 th chapter of the \"Book o f the Dead\" is s a id to h ave been d iscovered or r e - discovered, in the reign o f Housapti, the fifth k ing of the first dynasty, who lived more than 6000 years ago. At that tim e ce rtain po rtions of the sacred book s were found as antiquities, o f which the very tradition h ad b ee n lost. And this is the c hapter of \"Vivifying the soul for ever.\" The Egyptians were acc ustomed to set up two d ifferent im ages with the dead bod y in the tomb. One of these is the Shebti, or dup licative figure. This was one of their types of transformation; it represented the dup lication o f the mumm y for another life, called that of the Second Breath. The other im age was named the Ka, or second self. The 105 th chapter of the Ritual is entitl ed the c hapter of \"Propitiating the Ka of a person in the divine net her world;\" and, in the pictorial ill ustration, the person is represented in the ac t of adoring his own spiritual im age, the glorified Eidolon, to which h e relates how he a bomi nates all filthy things, in o rder that his ka, or higher self, may be propitiate d and pleased. The Egyptian titl e of ka - ankh meant the living likeness, o r the likeness of the imm ortal, the one that li ved on after death. Moreover, this ka was not only the reflex im age of the defunct erected in the tomb; it was also pou rtrayed as being born with the mortal into this life. In the scenes at Luxor, in which Amenhept III. is represented at the moment of birth, another infant, h is exact li keness, is depicted as his ka, his genius, him self in a divine e ffigy. Also, it was a great joy for the s pirit of the decea sed to b e permitt ed to revisit t he dead bod y and see how carefully it was preserved, which shows us the final crowning motive for making and k eeping the Mumm y. In the c hapter (lxxx ix.) of the visit of the soul or Ka of the decea sed to h is bod y, it i s s aid, -- \"Thou h ast let m y eternal soul see my bod y!\" \" He sees his bod y;\" and \"He is at peace in h is Mumm y!\" The c hief fact with which we a re now concerned, is, that the Mumm y - im age supp lied the supreme type of transformation, and was the Egypti an Karast, or Christ. Various s ymbols of durabilit y and rebirth were buried with the Egyptian d ead, when the mumm y was deposited in the hen - ankhu, or chest of the living. A copy of the Book o f the Second Breath -- Sen - sen -- formed h is pillow, and the leaves o f the Book o f Life were the lining of his coffin. He was acc ompanied b y his types of protection, o f duration, and renewal, the ankh - cross of life to come; the a nkh am - flower of life, worn at the ea r, the tat - cross, o r buckle of stabilit y, the beetle of tran sformation, the vulture - im age of victory; the green - stone (Uat) of r evivification, the tablet of r osin, a type of preservation; t he Level or corner - sign o f Amenu, signifying to come -- our \"amen.\" And, with the e yes of the sun and moon to light him t hrough t he darkness, the Egyptian entered h is tomb, called the \"Good"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Dw elling.\" A number of copies of the Shebti, o r doub le of the dead, were ranged in the Serdab to signify manifold repetiti on, and the Ka - im age of his s piritual self was erected in the tomb, as hi s visible link with h is dead form on earth. But, the Mumm y itself was also p reserved as a type, just as the mummi fied h awks, mi ce, cats, and o ther anim als, were preserved for their typical significance. Both Herodo tus and Plutarch tell us how the Egyptians ended a banqu et by carrying round, in a c offin, the im age of a dead bod y. \"Look on it, they said, and d rink, for when you are dead you will be like this!\" That im age was the mumm y - type of imm ortality! The sentim ent was not t hat of \"Eat and drink! f or to - m orrow w e die!\" It was one of r ejoicing in the a ssurance of imm ortality which the mumm y - im age represented. This mumm y - im age was the Egyptian Corpus Christi, the bod y of Christ, o r spirit which was to b e reborn. We have to go a long way back to get at the or igin o f the types and symbols now called Christian; not one of these originated at the beginning of our era! The Christ, for instance, is a pre - Christian type, conn ected with the mask, the mumm y, and the mysteries of transformation. The first m ale type of the Christ was after the flesh, and found ed on the transformation o f the boy into man -- the Christ who b eca me the a nointed on e of pub erty. This Phallic fetish associated with the rite of circumcision was the one repud iated b y Paul for the spiritual Christ - - not the historical Jesus. In the Gnostic sense the word made s ¬£ rx , o r f lesh, was this Phallic Logos found ed on the Causative Seed; t he reprodu ctive power which transformed in this life having been made a type of transformation for the future life! In the Gospel acc ording to Thomas, it i s s aid -- \"He who seeks me will find me in children from seven years old; for there c oncea led I shall, in the fourteenth year, b e made manifest\" -- that i s, as the pub escent Christ or Horus. In Greek the Christ m eans the anointe d; but the mystical or spiritual sense of the word was prece ded b y the physical. Chriso and Chresthai are a lso n ames for daubing over with colouring matter; and it still is a primiti ve practice a mongst the Black men and Red men to cover the bod ies or bon es of the dead with red o chre. Human bon es buried in the mound s of Caithness have been found coated ov er with red earth. This was don e to p reserve a nd save them. It was also typical of their being refleshed; and the bon e, h ead, mask, o r bod y so saved b eca me the symbol of a salvation and a saviour, b eca use it was an im age of transformation. This was the mumm y figure in Egypt. To \"karas,\" in Egyptian, is to anoint, embalm , o r make the mumm y; and the type of preservation so made was called the Karast or Christ. Such, I maintain, is the Egyptian o rigin o f the Christ called the Anointed in Greek. The one who transformed and rose a gain from t he dead, d esignated the Karast or Christ, was represented bo th b y the prepared and p reserved mumm y, and b y the ca rven im age, w hich was the likeness of a dead man. Moreover, this was the original Christ, whose vesture was withou t seam. In making the perfect m umm y type of continuity or imm ortality the bod y had to b e bound up in the ketu o r woof, a seaml ess robe, o r a bandage withou t a seam. No matter how long this mi ght be -- and some swathes have been un rolled that were 1000 yards in length -- it was woven withou t a seam. This, I repeat, was the seaml ess robe of the mystical Christ, which re - appears as the c oat, coating, o r chiton (cf. ketu, Eg. woof) of the Christ acc ording to John. The Assyrians also made use of a mysterious sacred im age ca lled the mamit , o r mamit u. It is celebrated in their hymns as the Mamit ! the Mamit ! the Treasure which p asseth no t away! It is s pok en o f as a shape of salvation,"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"descending from t he mi dst of the heavenly abyss: a life - giving im age that was place d, as is the Cross, in the hands of the dying, to d rive a way evil spirits.

I have shown elsewhere that this type of eternal li fe was identical with the Corpus Domini, the mumm y - krist of Egypt! The Bit - Mamiti was the hou se of the mummi es! The Kan - Mamiti was the book o f the mumm y; and the Mamit I hold to h ave been the im age of the resurre ction; a type a nd teac her of the Eternal!

This Christ is said to come forth sound, with no lim b mi ssi ng and no t a bon e broken, b eca use the decea sed was reconstituted in acc ordance with the physical im agery. And b y aid o f this Corporeal Christ of Egypt we ca n und erstand why the risen Christ of the Gospels is made to d emonstrate that he is not a spirit or b odiless ghost, as the disciples thou ght, bu t is in possession o f the flesh and bon es of the properly preserved corpse. They have omitt ed the transformation into the spiritual Christ. Thus in that character he is only the corpus Christi, or mumm y - Christ, o f Egypt -- a type transferred and no t a reality, either spiritual or physical. There ca n b e no doub t of this, for the c hild - Christ (copied into my book ) is actually portrayed on a Christian monu ment in the Roman catacombs as this very im age of the Mumm y - Chris t of Egypt, bound up in the seaml ess s wathe of the Karast. Some of the Christian Fathers s uppo sed that t he Egyptians believed in the physical resurrection o f the preserved bod y, and this false inference is frequently echoed in ou r own d ay. But it i s a mi st ake of the ignorant. The doctrine of the resurrection o f the Body is not Egyptian. There is proof extant that the Egyptians did no t m ake the Mumm y as their type of a physical resurrection. Being phenomenal and no t m ere theoretical Spiritualists, they had n o n eed o f a Corporeal resurrection. With them t he deathless only was divine, and their dead are spirits divinized b y rebirth in the likeness of their Gods. I repeat, the doctrine of the physical resurrection o f the bod y is not Egyptian. We find in the \"Boo k o f the Dead\" that the promi se of all blessedness, the supreme felicity, is for the spirit not to re - enter the ea rthly bod y for evermore. In the rubric to chapter lxxx ix. we read -- \"His s oul does not enter, o r is not thrust back, into h is mumm y forever.\" T heir idea of the life hereafter always turned on the transformation, and no t on the resurrection, o f the bod y; and their doctrine is that of transformation in the Hades, and no t of resurrection from t he ea rth. They left the dogma of a physical resurrection to b e ca rried o ff as the stolen p roperty of the non - spiritist Christians in Rome, along with so many other dead effigies of things that never lived. Accordingly the ea rly Christians, who were ignorant of Egyptian symbolism, d id b ase their belief in a life hereafter upon a bod ily resurrection here, d erived from t he Karast or Mumm y - Christ.

The doctrine is very ancient, but it has been stated anew by the a uthor of \"Esoteric Buddh ism,\" as if it were a rece nt revelation d erived from India a s the foun tain - head o f ancient kno wledge.

But I can assure Mr. Sinnett t hat t he seven Souls of Man are by no means new to u s, no r are they those \"transcendental conceptions of the Hindu mind\" in which h e has been led d evou tly to"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"believe.

The seven souls of man were not m etaphysical \"concepts\" at any tim e in the past. The doctr ine belongs to p rimiti ve biology, o r the physiology of the soul, which p rece ded the later psychology. Just as we speak o f the seven senses the a ncients s pok e of the seven souls as principles, po wers, o r constituent elements of man. These were found ed on fa cts of comm on p erception, verifiable in n ature; and we do no t need those faculties of the occult adept \"which mankind a t large has not yet evolved\" in o rder that they may be a pprehended. Mr. Sinnett i s of opinion that it would b e \"im possible for even the m ost skilful professor of occult science to exhibit eac h o f these seve n p rinciples s eparate and d istinct from the others.\" That is, when they have been mystified b y pseudo - esoteric mi srepresentation, in a metaphysical phase; then they lose the distinctness of physics; and then we have to h ark back on ce more to d istinguish and identify these seven souls of man. The truth is, that when the teac hings of primiti ve philosoph y have passed into the domain o f later speculations, you can make neither head, tail, no r vertebra of them -- they constitute a n indistinguishable mush o f manufactured mystery! And the only way of exposing the pretensions of f alse teac hing, and o f destroying the superstiti ons, o ld o r new, that prey upon and p aralyze the human mi nd, is by explaini ng them from t he root; t o learn what they once meant in their prim ary phase is to kno w w hat they do no t and canno t m ean for us to - day. Nothing avails us finally, short of a first - hand acquaintanceship with the kno wledge a nd modes of expression that were pr im ordial. It is quite possible, and even apparent, that the first form of the mystical SEVEN was s een to b e figured in h eaven b y the seven large stars of the Great Bear, the c onstellation assigned b y the Egyptians to the Mother of Tim e, and o f the seven El emental Powers. And on ce a type like this has been found ed it becomes a mould for future use -- one that canno t be got rid o f or out of. The Egyptians divided the face of the sky by night into seven p arts. The prim ary Heaven was s evenfold. The ea rliest force s recognised in Nature were reckon ed as s even in nu mber. These beca me Seven Elementals, d evils, o r later divinities. Seven p roperties were a ssigned to n ature -- as matter, cohesion, fluxion, coagulation, acc umulation, station, and d ivision -- and seven element s or souls to man. A principle of seve ning, so to say, was introdu ced, and the number seven supp lied a sacred type that could b e used for manifold future purposes. When Abraham t ook h is oath at Beer - sheba, the Well of the Seven, we a re told that he seve ned , or did seve n. Sevening was then a recognized mode of swearing; and Sevening is s till a recognized mode of swearing with the Esoteric Buddh ists, who, acc ording to Mr. Sinnett, continue it ad libitum, and carry it on through thick and thin. The seven souls of the Pharaoh are often mentioned in the Egyptian texts.

In the Hindu d rawings we see the god Agni portrayed with seven arms to h is bod y. These represent his seven po wers, p rinciples, b reaths, o r souls. The seven rays of the Chaldean god Heptaktis, o r Iao, on the Gnostic stones indicate the same septena ry of souls. The seven stars in the hand o f the Christ in Revelation h ave the same significance. There is a star with eight rays, which is found to b e the symbol of Buddh a, of Assur in Assyria, o f Mithras; and o f the Christ in the ca tacombs of Rome. That w as the symbol of the Gnostic pleroma of the seven souls, the perfect flower or star of which was the Christ of the Gnosis; not of any human h istory. It can b e trace d b ack to Egypt as the star of Sut - Horus, a star with eight points or loop s, undoub tedly mea nt for Orion, which was at one tim e the star of Annun ciation, that showed the place where the youn g child lay, o r where the God was re - born upon the horizon o f the Resurrection at Easter. A very ancient form of the e ight - rayed star was a sign o f the Nnu, t he Associate Gods of Egypt, who were the Seven Ali (Ari) or Companions (Cf. the Babylonian Ili and Gnostic Elohim ), as children o f the Great Mother, the Gnostic Ogdoa s. The same type, with the same meaning, is represented in the Book o f Revelation, where t he son o f man (who is a male with female breasts, and therefore not a human b eing) holds in h is hand the seven stars which symbolise the seven angels or spirits who are in the service of their Lord -- like the Seven Great Spirits in the 17th chapter of the E gyptian \"Book o f the Dead.\" Seven souls, o r principles in man, were identified b y our British Druids. In the Hebrew Targummim , Haggadoth and Kabbala, the Rabbins s ometim es recognise a threefold soul - - as of life, the a nim al -- from t he Egyptian nef, for the b reath. This is the quickening spirit of the e mbryo. The Ruach is s aid to enter the boy at the a ge of thirteen years and on e day. That i s the soul of adultship, the reprodu cing spirit reprodu ced for r eprodu ction at pub erty. The third spirit, o r Neshamah, is an intelligent soul which enters a man at twenty years of age, if the deeds of his life a re right; i f not, h e is unworthy of the Neshamah, and the Nephesh and Ruach remain h is only souls. Another Rabbi says the soul of man h as five distinct forms and n ame s -- the Nephesh, Ruach, Neshamah, Cajiah, and the Jachida. The Cajiah is the spirit t hat m akes to re - live; the Jachida denotes that which un ifies all i n one, and so establishes the permanent entity. Some persons are spok en o f as being worthy to rece ive the Jachida in the life to come. Ben Israel teac hes that the Nephesh, Ruach, and Neshamah signify nothing more than faculties, capacities, o r constituent principles of the man, and that an additional soul m eans increase of kno wledge a nd advancement in the stud y of Divine laws. The Rabbins also ran the number of souls up to seven; so likewise do the Karens of India. The Khond s of Orissa recognise four souls, o r a fourfold soul. One of these dies on the dissolution o f the bod y; one, the a ncestral soul, remains at tached to the Tribe on earth to b e re - produ ced, generation after generation -- in relation to which, when a c hild is born the priest inqu ires which member of the famil y has come back again? The third soul is able to go forth and ho ld spirit - intercourse, leav ing the bod y in an inert cond ition. This is the soul that can assume other shapes by the a rt of Mleepa, o r the gnosis of transformation. The fourth soul is restored to the good d eity Boora, and thus attains imm ortality.

Two sets of the seven may be tabulated in their Egyptian and Hindu shapes and compared as follows: - I ND IAN . E GYPTIAN . 1 . Rupa, bod y, or element of form 1. Kha, bod y. 2.

Primiti ve man n aturally observed from t he first that he was brought forth b y the mother, formed o f flesh, ma de from her blood ; that is the mystical water, o r matter of life, and the red earth o f mythology. This prim al element was represented b y the Great Mother of all flesh; and the first soul was acc ordingly derived from t he blood, the mystical parent of Life. Thus, in the Mangaian acc oun t of Creation, the Great Mother, Vari, is s aid to make the first m an from piece s of her own flesh! Flesh b eing blood that has taken form. \"Some, indeed,\" says Hermes, \"misled b y nature, mistook the blood for the soul;\" that is, they took it so, to b egin with; and such was the nature of the human soul No. 1. This s oul of blood is identified in Genesis ix. 4 and 5. Blood is the Adami c soul! From t he Mother source ca me the red earth o f the Adami c or prim ary creation, whence the Rabb ins sometim es call Adam t he \"Blood o f the world!\" In the Semiti c languages, Assyrian and Hebrew, Adam signified \"Blood \" -- sim ply blood, as the red. It was thou ght at one tim e that two p rim al race s of men were a lluded to in the Cuneiform Texts, und er the nam es of Adamu and Sarku; but it i s now kno wn that these names s ignify the two p rinciples of female matter and male spirit, the Hindu p erusha. At this primiti ve stage begin the legends with which we have been so p itiably beguiled, or so p rofound ly perplexed! In the first acc oun t of the c reation o f man, in the Hebrew G enesis, h e is formed in the im age of the Elohim , who were the seven p rim al elemental powers, that beca me ce lestial as the keepers of tim e in Heaven -- in their second ph ase -- and u ltim ately the seve n Planetary spirits.

And these two sources, female a nd male, supp ly the two do ctrinal types to Paul when h e says, \"As in Adam (the flesh - man) all men d ie, eve n so in Christ (the spirit - man) shall all be made alive!\" Here the true interpretation canno t be obtained with out the a id o f the"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"primiti ve physiology; it does not depend upon any fulfillm ent of f able a s fact in later history, bu t on the a daptation o f the mythical types to conv ey a mystical m eaning in what are ca lled \"mysteries,\" that were very sim ple in their prim al phase -- which ph ase is the object of our present search. The Psalmi st refers to this Adami c man when h e says, \"Put not your trust in the son o f man; his breath go eth forth, h e returneth to h is earth. In that very day his purposes perish.\" The a ntithesis to this was the Son o f God, the second Adam, the man from heaven, the Christ, o r imm ortal spirit; i n short, a later type of the human soul! The first Adam represented the man, o r creation o f the seven souls, and the seven Elohim , whence it was s aid, in the Semiti c Legends, that his head on ly reached up to the seve nth h eaven. The second Adam, o r the Christ, attains the e ighth h eaven, as the height; or, h e c omes, later on, to represent the ten - fold h eaven as the Adam Kadmon o f the Kabbalists. The Tahitians, w hose Great Mother is named Eve (or Ivi), h ave the same physiological myth! They say that the first m en were formed o f Araea , o r r ed earth, and on this they lived un til bread was made -- bread b eing typical of corn, corn o f seed, i.e., male source. All m en d e rived from t he motherhood at first -- and in that m ythical creation the man was really created from t he woman, instead o f the woman b eing taken from t he man, which was of nece ssity a later creation, in k eeping with the sociology. The mystery of the woman b ei ng taken from t he man is mentioned in the Egyptian Ritual, o r Book o f the Dead. The speaker says: \"I know the mystery of the woman b eing taken from the man. \" The matter of such a mystery was physiological. The far earlier mystery was that of man being crea ted b y the woman from t he red earth, o r blood. Next it was apprehended that the mother inspired the breath o f life into h er embryo. And breath, prajna, jiva, or the ba, constitutes the soul No. 2. In v arious legends man was made from t he red earth, and the Blacks of Victoria say that their creator, Pund jel, b lew the breath o f life, o r the soul of breath, in at his navel. These were the first two souls of the seven, b eca use blood supp lied the e lement of f lesh, o r f orm, and b reath was the prim al element of li fe. A Y uni Indian d escription o f death speaks of a man as having the wind p ressed ou t of him, so that he forgot. And no w for a doctrinal development! Blood and breath being the two p rim ary elements or souls of life, these c onsequently beca me the two great types of sacrificial offering. Among the Amapond a Kaffirs when a new chief succee ds to the government it i s a c ustom for him t o b e baptised in the blood o f his brother, o r some near relative, who is put to d eath for the purpose; and in Fiji when the ca noe of a c hief was launched a number of men were sacrificed, so that their souls (or Breath) mi ght supp ly a wind o f good luck for the sails of the vessel. It was on acc oun t of their natural genesis that these two souls of the blood and b reath were typically co ntinued in the water and the breath employed for the re - genesis, o r regeneration, o f the c hild in Christian b aptism.

As the breath o f life was a kind o f soul, so the steam of food, o r the incense presented in sacrifice, was a form of the breath o f life offered to the spirits of the dead o r to the gods. The motive a nd meaning of many curious customs can on ly be a pprehended on these physical ground s. For instance, when the Canadian Indians killed a b ear they adjured the soul of the a nim al not to b e a ngry with them, and then p lacing a pipe between its teeth blew tobacc o - smoke backwards into its mouth, and thus s ymbolically restored that which they had just taken -- its s oul of breath. In the Rubric to th e Egyptian Ritual it says -- \"Offer ye a g reat quan tity of incense; it makes that spirit alive.\" Drops of blood from t he heart of a c ow are likewise to b e offered with the incense. Blood and b reath (incense) were both o ffered b y the Jews. Philo explains that the offerings of fr ankincense laid on the golden altar in the Inner Temple were more holy than the blood o ffered ou tside. The mystical m eaning of which, h e says, must be investigated b y those who are ea ger for the truth in acc ordance with the Gnosis. The blood and b reath survive a lso in the blood y wafer and incense of the Roman Ritual. Now, we have to go b ack to this Soul of Breath to reac h the origin o f the transmi gration of souls, which h as been continued into the domain o f later doctrines by those who w ere ignorant of its beginnings. To b reathe a nd to transmi grate a re synon ymous in Egyptian, und er the word sen.

Such, ho wever, is not the o rigin, as the Egyptian Shade, o r Khaba, proves. The Khaba, or third soul, is a light, v isible, bu t not tangible, envelope of the Ba, or soul of the breath. Khab signifies cover, to v eil, to cover over. It is applied to an eclipse; and what is shad e in a bu rning land bu t cover? Hence the type of the third soul is an Egyptian sunshad e!

In the fragment of the \"Egyptian Gospel,\" quo ted bo th b y Clement of Alexandria a nd Clement of Rome, we a re told that the Christ, h aving been asked b y Salome when h is Kingdom was to come, answered, \"W hen the male with the female shall be neither male nor female.\" Now the Christ of which that could b e said is of nece ssity the Spiritual Christ of either or of both Sexes. This is also the Christ of Paul when h e says, \"There is neither male nor female, for ye a re a ll one in Christ.\" Christian literalisers sought to attain that type by unsexing themselves! It follows, on the same physical basis, that the woman do es not possess a soul, or, at least, not t his particular soul, found ed on the principle of viri lity, and that at t his s tage of thou ght she must derive her self - perpetuating soul from t he masculine nature -- if at all. In the Egyptian tale of the two b rothers (in which we find the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife), the youn ger one is deprived o f his virile soul, whereupon h e says to h is consort, -- \"I am a woman, eve n a s thou a rt.\" Here, then, the woman is also treated as the im pub escent or soulless child! Some of the Christian fathers maintained that woman h as no inherent soul, which p roves they could no t have been Spiritualists in any practical sense! They held that woman on ly represented matter ( our soul No. 1 ) degraded and d amned ever since the Fall of Man, and on ly to b e saved b y childbearing, as Paul teac hes; that is, b y the grace of the male, and the a ddition o f a later soul. The Khond s of India, who h ad no t got beyond the general Ancestral soul of the tribe, coup led this with the masculine power, and h eld that Woman was not a produ cer of soul; and they actually killed o ff their female children, b eca use these shared in the Ancestral soul of the tribe, withou t contributing to the reserved stock, and were thus robb ing the males of a portion o f their own p roper soul. If they reserved all t he virile soul t o themselves, they were brave e nou gh to capture women and wives from other tribes; and such was their argument for and d efence of female infanticide within their own tribe! The Turks, in comm on with o ther race s, ho ld that Woman h as no soul -- I am t rying to show the natural ground for such b elief! -- and t hat if she is reprodu ced at the tim e of the resurrection, it will have to b e in the im age of the male.

This doctrine of the masculine soul is illus trated in Egypt by the shebti im age of the dead. Egyptologists, like Mariette, h ave been pu zzled to kno w w hy the \"doub le\" of the dead, which is always a figure of the bearded male, shou ld be found in the tombs, as the type of the re - arising female, as well as of the male. It was beca use a t a ce rtain stage of thou ght -- in relation to the physical basis -- the female had to rise a gain in the im age of the masculine soul -- the soul No. 5 -- if at all. Thus, the potential imm ortality of the female is here made depende nt on the male, through the primitive physiology dominating and d etermining the later doctrine. Here, as in so many other cases, it i s a survival -- sim ply a survival -- from t he ea rly physics! good for its own meaning -- but unable to carry us any further -- exce pt in the way in which it will mi slead us. The potential imm ortality of the soul i s one of the oldest beliefs comm on to the aboriginal and b arbaric race s of the world. Potential, o r cond itional imm ortality, is a doctrine put forward afresh in ou r tim e by E soteric Buddh ists and certain b ibliolators! But these latter never can touch bo ttom or determi ne a nything whatever by wrangling over a few texts of Scripture, that have been b rought on withou t the e xplanation o f the oral hidden wisdom. It m ay be truly said of the people of one book : -- \"Behold! ye kno w not anything!\" Such do ctrines as cond itional imm ortality can on ly be judged b y their natural genesis! We shall never get at them by mi staking what we ca nno t und erstand for a divine revelation; nor by reading in to them a modern mi s - interpretation. We have now to go b ack and learn o f the primiti ve a nd un civilised race s, with whom t he loss, say of Memory, is the loss of a soul. Absence of mi nd may be a nother mode of losing your soul. To lose your shadow even b y hav ing your likeness taken, may be the means of losing your soul, as is yet believed! Or it m ay be, that und er the a ffliction o f bronchitis or asthma, you run v ery great risk o f losing your prana or soul of breath. Under such circumstances a Fijian would lie down and call upon h is departing soul to come back to h is bosom; or the Karen magician will run after the sick man's butterfly, as they call his wavering, wandering soul of breath, and p ray it t o return. And if the spirit - doctor shou ld fail t o catch the bu tterfly (or psyche), b eca use it has crossed the bound ary of life a nd d eath, h e tries to capture the Astral Shade of a living man which may be flitti ng abou t whilst it s owner is s leeping with h is s ix other souls (or any lesser number) in the land o f dreams; so that when h e wakes he sickens, p ines, and d ies, b eca use his other souls will besure to go in search o f the mi ssing Astral Shade -- or envelope -- for cover! We smil e a t such sim plicity, bu t -- when Plato, o r any other metaphysical perverter of primiti ve thou ght, sets forth the doctrine that our kno wledge is a matter of memory, and ou r science a mere remi niscence, that is but a soph ism found ed on this fourth soul of the ea rly philosoph y, which d ates from t he tim e when the faculty of memorising was the highest recogn ised type of mind o r a soul. Again, on e form of the a dult or masculine soul was considered to b e a secretion o f the marrow, the Sanskrit mearg, or majja - rasa, the sap o f life -- the marrow of manhood, o r soul of horn and bon e.

Here we ca n trace yet another doctrinal development. At this s tage fat and o il were offered to the dead, as a type of the marrow of life, and soul of bon e: the fat that was place d in the c ups o n the tombstones of the buried d ead. To this day the Red Indians sacredly place a lump o f f at in the mouth o f the c orpse prepared for the grave; and the Romanists anoint t he dying with the oil called \"extreme unction. \" In Egypt t he very divinity of Horus c onsisted in the preservation o f the holy oil on h is face ; he who was the anointed o r the greased, i.e., the Christ (Records of the Past, 10, 164 ); he who was \"raised from the dead through (and as) the glory of the Father\"; and whose ea rliest advent was in the male nature, as the a nointed at the tim e of pub erty. Hence fat or oil was used as a bon e - type of the primiti ve soul of man -- the sole bon e from which the first woman ever was created. This, the fift h soul, was at one tim e the quintessence of a man! When the brain h ad b een identified as the physical basis, o r matter of mi nd, the sixth soul was then d erived from t his Ritual (chap. lxx viii.), the Osirified d ecea sed says, -- \"Horus has come to me out of my father Osiris!\" \" He has come to me out of the brains o f his head!\" That was as the nou s of the Gnostics, the revealer of an intellectual soul, who in Egypt is the god Ptah, o r Putah, the opener, whom I elsewhere identify with Buddh a in India. The Hindu Buddh i is the sixth soul, and Putah is lord o f the sixth creation: he is also kno wn as the \"wisdom of the first intellect.\" (See \"Natural Genesis,\" section 9. ) The Seventh soul was derived from t he individualised fatherhood, which was represented by the father Atum for the first tim e in the Egyptian mythology -- A tum being equivalent to the Buddh ist Atma, the c reative soul. Atum of the seventh creation represents the eternal -- he inspires the breath o f life e verlasting, and is called the one sole God withou t chang e. At this s tage of attainment the soul exults that i t is created forever, and is a soul beyond tim e. The decea sed exclaim s, \"Shu causes me to shine as a living lord, and to b e made the Seve nth when h e c omes forth!\" \" I am the one born o f Sevek h!\" and Sevekh means the sevenfold o r seventh, the type of attainm ent, as the seve nth o f the total series. This \"is he who comes out sound (in d eath) -- the Unknown is his name.\" The \"mystery of this s oul made by the god s\" is described as being, as it were, \"self - existence\" -- i.e. of the permanent entity attained at last. I t is called the \"reserved soul,\" the \"engendered o f the god s, who p rovided it with its s hap es. Inexplicable is the genesis. It is the greatest of secrets.\" (Rit. ch. 15. ) In this way the seven souls were identified in Egypt, and may be formulated as -- (1) t he Soul of Blood, (2) the Soul of Breath, (3) the Shade or Covering Soul, (4) the Soul of Perception, (5) the Soul of Pubescence, (6) the Intellectual Soul, (7) the Spiritual Soul.

In the \"Natural Genesis\" I have trace d the seven po wers of the e lements to their origin in external phenomena. The seven elementaries in the nature of man may also b e followed as far as they will go. In the Inscription o f Una (Records of the Past; 2, 8), these Seven Souls of the Pharaoh are spok en o f as being invok ed \"more than a ll t he Gods.\" These were the Divine Ancestors, the Manes, who were worshipped in Egypt by the \"Shu s - en - Har,\" or followers of Horus, for thirteen hund red years before the tim e o f Menes. Being Seven in Number, they are identical with the Seven Manus, Rishis, Elohim , and o ther Hebdo mads found elsewhere. Their origin was in this wise. The Seven, who p rece ded the Eighth, b eing look ed upon as progenitors of the one - endu ring Soul, the Horus, Christ or Buddh a, b eca me a form of the Ancestors, o r Manes; the nature of which ha s to b e partly determined b y the number Seve n.

Not one of the Seven Souls had ob tained the permanent personality, and, as they were but seven rudim ental factors in the develop ment of an u ltim ate Soul, they could no t become Seven Spirits as realiti es, o r Apparitions, in another life. Each o lder self was merged in the now, and, therefore, the seven could n either be sim ultaneous nor contemporary, except when absorbed in the onenes s of unity. Hermes describes the one soul of the universe a s entering into creeping things, and transformi ng into the soul of watery things, and this into the soul of things that li ve on the land; and airy ones are c hanged into men; and hu man souls that la y hold o f imm ortality are c hanged into spirits, and so they ascend up to the region o f the fixed stars (or gods), which is the e ighth sphere; and this is the most perfect glory of the soul!

The worst kind o f haunting in this world is not don e by the spirits of dead p eople, bu t by the phantoms of defunct ideas; the shadows cast upon the c loud - curtain o f the hereafter by those things which were only types and figures of human realiti es here -- not things in themselves from t he first. And these seven, o r other number of other selves, b elonging to the one personality, h ave left t heir shadows in the domain o f metaphysic, which is fund amentally fractured b y this s plitti ng up o f the one personality into separate selves, whether sevenfold, fivefold, fourfold, threefold, o r only second ary. Also, these ghosts of primiti ve physics are beginning to walk in ou r mi dst, and are trying to pass themselves off upon u s as genuine spirit - phenomena. The Buddh ist difference between p ersonality and individuality was nece ssitated, and is explained b y the individuality which may include a seven - fold form, o r passage of the personality; seven p ersons in on e e go, like the \"Three Persons and on e God\" in the Trinity. In the process of doctrinal development, objective re - birth in a series of human lives, o r spirits, h as been substituted for the re - birth o f the e go in p ersonality at the different stages an d conv ersions of the one being, whereas the original re - births were subjective, whether biological or psychical, and limit ed to the one life a lone, in its s ucce ssive stages of transformation.

The seven spirits were a lso continued in the Gnostic system as the seven angels who conv ey the e ternal soul to the human creature. You may see them i n Didron's Christian Icono graphy as the Seven Doves which hov er round the Virgin Mary, who carries the Christ in embryo -- he who, as the e ighth, b eca me superior to the a ngels. The dov e was also said b y the Gnostics to represent Christ as the eight - fold on e, o r the illustrious Ogdoad; the number o f the Dove being 801 in Greek letters. Hence the descent of the Dove that abod e on Jesus when h e a ttained the Christ - hood ; where the symbol proves and identifies the typical and non - historical nature of the transaction, and the Gnostic c haracter of the c um ulative Christ. The Ass, a Typhon ian type of lunar phenomena, was likewise a representative of the Word o r Logos that was reprodu ced as the Eighth -- like the repeating note in the musical scale. It is well kno wn that the bray of the donk ey is just an octave in its range; and this made it an u tterer of the Word o r Logos, who was the Eighth. We read in the Ritual (ch. 125 ) that \"Great words are spoken b y the Ass!\" And in o ld Egyptian the Ass has the name of Iu or Iao. The Eighth was the Seventh Soul, as first Person in the Hebdo mad, the father - God a fterwards r eprodu ced a s his own Son. This was Iu - em - hept (hept=7) in Egypt; t he Ass - headed Iao - Sabaoth and Iao - Chnub is of the Gnostics. When expressed b y means of external phenomena it was the Solar vivifier who was reprodu ced monthly, o r annu ally, b y the Mother - Moon ; whence the re - birth o r resurrection that is s till dependent on the full m oon o f Easter; he who b eca me Lord o f the first day, o r Sund ay, instead o f the seventh d ay, or Saturday. The divine Fatherhood b ein g found ed at last in the God, o r supreme one of the seven souls, whether called Atum - Ra, o r Osiris in Egypt, Vishnu in India, Adam i n the Greek Mysteries, o r Jehov ah amongst the Jews, h is manifestor was im personated as the divine son o f the father - God, in whom t he octave is attained, and the God - head o f all t he powers or souls is reprodu ced just as the e ighth no te in music is the note of r epetiti on, reprodu ction, o r r e - appearance. And this eighth on e was the Christ, as Iu - em - hept, the son o f Atum, who is de signated the \"Eternal Word.\" This eighth on e, as manifestor of the seven, was also Har - Khuti, in Egypt, the Lord o f Lights and o f the Glorified Elect, the God whose Sign is the Pyrami d - figure of 7; Krishna Agni, o r Buddh a in India; Assur in Assyria; Pan, of the seven p ipes, in Greece ; and the Gnostic Christ, called Totem, the All, who was formed from t he c ontributions of all t he Seven, identical with the Buddh a, who is the outcome of the seven Buddh as, the result of their \"Collective Intelligence,\" called Adi - Buddh a, or Buddha from the beginning, in allusion to this process of development; and whose symbol, like that of the Christ, and o f Horus, is the star with eight rays! The Christ, o r Mithras, o r Horus, represented that height, o r octave of attainment, to which the"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Gnostic a dept aspired, and which Paul designates the full - grown Man, and the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ, or a sort of divine Octavius! Such was the nature of the \"Wisdom\" that a Gnostic like Paul, Epop t and p erfect, s pok e amongst the perfected; and it would h ave been u seless to h ave spok en such among A - Gnostics who were of the fleshly faith. This was the mystical Christ who came BY and AS the Holy Spirit; so Jesus is transformed into the Christ when the Holy Spirit des cends upon h im i n h is Baptism! But, after this transformation, it i s s aid in the same Gospel that the Holy Spirit was not yet extant (or comm unicated), beca use Jesus was not yet glorified. To the genuine Gnostics this holy spirit always had b een extant; bu t here we see its very existence made a ltogether dependent upon the personality and d eath o f Jesus in the process of re - dating it and making him t he a uthor of it historically. Barnabas knew better. He identifies the Christ with the Man o f the e ighth Soul, who rose a gain on the Eighth Day of Creation! Here the height was s ynon ymous, and is identical, with the number eight! This height is represented in the Buddh ist, Gnostic, and Mithraic mysteries by a ladder with eight steps, the e ighth, o r height, b eing th e top o f attainment, the place of the perfected; and so the octave was completed at l ast i n Buddh a - hood, in Elijah - hood, in Christ - hood, o r the divine man - hood, o f the pre - Christian religions; such likewise being the natural genesis of the e ight ways and e ight paths of Buddh ism. The Gnostics s aid salvation was brought by the Ogdoad; and the Saviour personified was the mystical Octavius: the superior man o f the e ighth creation! It is s aid b y Peter in the Clementine Recognitions that there was an Ideal Man wh o h ad the right to the name of Messiah, b eca use the Jews called their Kings the Christ, the Romans C√¶ sar, and the Egyptians Pharaoh. That is true. Each o f these DID represent the same original type. The Roman C√¶ sar, the hairy, pub escent, o r Anointed One, w as an im personation o f this supreme soul; who h appens to b e the Eighth also b y name in Octavianu s, who was the first Emperor! ( Born B.C. 63, called Augustus B.C. 27. ) According to the Christianised Legends of the Sybil, the Romans wished to adore Octavianu s as a divinity, bu t the Sybil showed h im t he Comi ng Christ i n the Virgin's lap, whereupon h e refused to b e worshipped h im self, took o ff his diadem, and adored the future c hild! Nevertheless, Octavianus was just as good an historical realisation o f the myt hical and mystical Christ as any personal Jesus could b e; or, rather, bo th were e qually im possible for those who knew. Another Gnostic mode of illustrating this mystery may be pointed ou t in p assing. The supreme personality was attained in the e ighth d egre e of ascension, and the supreme sign of that personality, the pronoun I, was the ultim ate outcome a nd representative sign o f seven vo wel sound s. Our letter I was the a i, ei, eta or ida of the Coptic, which h as the numeral value of eight. Seven vo wels, said the Gnostics, glorify the Word, and these were uttered in a single sound, in an O or an I. Thus the octave was completed, the height attained and expressed in a single letter sign, the I of Personality. The God was also invok ed with adorations in the Gree k Mysteries; possibly with the \"8 Adorations,\" which are Egyptian and Chinese. This was another sign o f the Eighth Soul, having the numerical"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"value of Eight i n hund reds. The sign survives as the vocative \"Oh!\" of r eligious aspiration. According to the Gno sis, then, the Seven were only a group o f phenomena which evolved the e ndu ring entity at last, the e ternal soul it self, into which they were transubstantiated in death; t he re - appearing, manifesting spirit t hat was personified as the fully awakened Buddh a, or the mystical Christ of the Mysteries. Such was the Finding of the Christ as a human p rodu ct, which was first demonstrated b y Spiritualism -- the type having been continued b y combining the mythical with the mystical! This was the \"True Logo s\" which Philo and Celsus wrote a bou t, the \"Heavenly and indestructible offspring o f a Divine and Incorporeal nature,\" the Gnostic \"Light which lighteth eve ry one that cometh into the world,\" not that earthly Shadow cast upon the background o f ignorance ca lled the Histo rical Christ. Such was the origin and mode of building up, stage by stage, the Christ of the Gnosis; the divine man, the man from heaven, d escribed b y Paul, the Christ of those who kn ew, the e volution o f which h as now been trace d step b y step to its culmi n ation; t he Christ of that spiritual existence beyond the grave, which was demonstrated in the mysteries of mediumship, who was called the son o f God, also the son o f man, b eca use the son as manifestor im plied the father as begetter! This was in the mystica l phase. In the moral aspect the Horus, Christ, o r Buddh a was s et forth as a model to all m en, the highest type of attainment for those who were c lim bing up the ladder of eight round s. It was not the portrait of any one individual who could attain p erfecti on once a nd for all as the representative of all m en. That was the fatal mi stake of the Christians -- the men who d id no t kno w -- as it i s equally the e rror of those Esoterists who only pretend to kno w. The ea rliest m ode of attaining this Christhood, o r Buddh a hood, was by cultivating the trance - cond itions and b ecomi ng a spirit amongst spirits. This was moralised in a second ph ase when attainment was made dependent upon the practice of certain saving virtues. In the final phase c onv ersion to a belief in the Chri stian scheme has taken the place of both! It is positively provable that the Christ is but a type identical with the Horus, the Iao - Heptaktis, the Buddh a or Pan o f the prior cultus. According to Iren√¶us, the Valentinian Gnostics maintained the identity of the Saviour with Pan, who is called Christum in the Latin text. Pan was, o f course, an earlier personification o f the All, or \"All Things.\" The type a nd o rigin are one, und er whatsoever name. Consequently Pan, o r Arist√¶us, with the seven - fold p ipe in h is h and, and the sheep on h is s hou lders, is the Christ, the Saviour, the Good Shepherd pou rtrayed in the Roman Catacombs, instead o f the historic Jesus, whose picture is not there. The Christ or Buddh a of the Gnostics could no t become flesh on ce for all, as he was the supreme outcome a nd consumm ate flower of all flesh, in the c ulmi nating stage of spiritual attainment i n life, and spiritual apparition after death. The Christ being an imm ortal principle, and v ery life itself, could no t be put to d eath; so that \"r edemption b y the death o f Christ\" is a fund amental fallacy from t he first. Here, as in o ther matters, the essence of all t he present writer has to say is, that a physical fulfill ment is always and eve rywhere the doctrine of delusion.

For, the Egyptian, \"only one who comes forth from the bod y\" applies to the spirit i n life, as well as in d eath. The a rt of leaving the bod y was comm on to the old d ark race s, and is practised b y the rudest indigenes of many lands. The Khond s call it t he a rt of Mleepa or transformation. An Egyptian artist named Iritsen (11th Dynasty) says he kno ws the \"mystery of the Divine Word,\" and \"how to p rodu ce the mode (or form) of issuing forth and coming in.\" Whether in this life or another, the \"Wis e Spirits\" were a ll one. \"He has become as one of us\" is s aid o f Adam when h e had b ecome Dead as \"Wise Spirits.\" It was this s o - called Magical Art of produ cing abno rmal cond itions, and the faculty of Second Sight, that finally established the e xistence of a permanent individuality or soul beyond the Seven Elementaries. And it was the mystical Christ, so established, who alone c ould b ring imm ortality to light; but not by a physical resurrection from t he tomb. \"I am t he resurrection and the life\" applies only to the principle or spirit -- the 8th, as the one that rises again, the \"only one,\" as the Ritual has it, \"who eve r comes from the bod y\" -- the typical eternal who appears as the deathless one upon the other side of the grave! This Christ canno t be made Histo rical or Personal FOR US, -- only IN U S! That is the doctrine of Paul, o f Philo, and the Gnostics, oppo sed to the Christian do ctrine of the physical or fleshly faith. The ultim ate soul, type or phase of existence, then, was not born as a mental concept, nor as the result of an indu ction, no r as the dream - shadow made objective; it was practically demonstrated as s cientific matter - of - fact! The Christ of the Gnostics, o f Philo - Jud√¶us, and o f Paul, the heavenly man, o r second Adam, who came from Abov e, was no mere doctrinal abstraction, bu t the spirit or ghost that could b e seen, -- as it was s een b y Paul in visions -- and made to constitute his own special m ystery; and always had b een seen b y those who po ssessed the second sight! even as it continues to b e seen b y the a bno rmal seers of to - day, -- which ghost, acc ording to the e vidence c ollected b y the Society for Psychical Research, is also v isible a t tim es to o rdinary vision. In pou rtraying their Ka im age of the spiritual Ego, the glorified second - self, as a type o f the Eternal Being, the Egyptians represented that which their Seers s aw, and you may trust them for the truth in this, as in everything else, they were so entirely truthful. Indeed, I think the mi nd o f man has never had so p rofound a sense of truth and v erity as in the Egyptian ph ase. Through life they put t heir trust i n truth, and it was their principle of cohesion in d eath. The Osirified d ecea sed says, \"I am the Lord o f Truth, living it daily. I am spiritualised, I have become a soul! I have touched tru th.\" Their typical Eternal is called the sole being who lives by truth. Before the tribun al of eternal truth the acc used p leads that he has not even altered a story in the telling o f it !

But to return. Esoteric Buddh ism t ells us the higher p rinciples of the series which go to constitute man are not fully developed in the mankind with which we a re a s yet famili ar. Whereas this s ystem of thou ght, this mode of representation, this s eptenary of powers, in various aspects, h ad b een established in Egypt at least seven thou sand years ago, as we learn from certain allusions to Atum found in the inscriptions lately discovered at Sakkarah. I say in v arious aspects beca use the Gnosis of the Mysteries was at least seven - fold in its nature -- it was Elementa l, Biological, Elementary (human), Stellar, Lunar, Solar, and Spiritual -- and no thing short of a grasp o f the whole system can po ssibly enable us to d iscrimi nate the various parts, d istinguish on e from t he other, and d etermi ne the which and the what, as we try to follow the symbolical Seven through their several phases of character. The Egyptian Ritual represents the drama of the doctrinal developments relating to the passage of the Decea sed, with h is trials and transformations in the und erworld, which furn ished the matter of the later mysteries, including the Greek, Mithraic, and Christian. In this, the Decea sed p lays over again the whole seven characters that went to the making up o f the one personality, which b eca me permanent i n the e ighth n ature. He is r econstructed for the other life in exact acc ordance with the seven p rinciples or souls with which h e was constructed in this life. On the day of r eckon ing souls, the seven constituents have to b e c ollected, coun ted, and un ited in on e. According to the dram atic representation, imm ortality depended on totality. The seven chief organs of life, o r vehicles of Soul, were a ll preserved as types. And when pu t together again, acc ording to pattern, h e is as we say \"all t here,\" with the whole of his parts and members sound. The soul could exist i ndependently of the heart, bu t t here was no p roper r econstruction possible withou t the heart being literally \"in its r ight place.\" It was thus they acted the Mystery. The Decea sed cries, \"Do no t take my soul!\" (Ba.) \"Do no t de tain my shad e!\" (Khaba.) \"Open the path to my shad e, and my soul, and my intelligence (Akhu ) to see the great God on the day of reck oning souls.\" One of the Genii says to h im , \"I join together thy bon es for thee. I revive thy members for thee; I bring thee thy heart, and pu t it i n its place.\" Then the Osirified d ecea sed exclaim s, \"I am the reck oning which go es in\" -- \"and the accoun t which comes out\" -- i.e., when summ ed up and VERIFIED. When pu t together and d ivinized as the c ompound im age of the Seven, it i s said o f the Eighth Soul, \"Thy Individua lity is permanent!\" Having attained h is s evenfold totality, h e is the Eighth on e, at peace a s an endu ring spirit, on e of the Verified. The decea sed is thus greeted, \"Hail Osiris! thou ha st come -- thy k a (his s piritual im age, o r divine likeness) with thee!\" and h e is now hailed as the only one e ver comi ng forth from t he bod y, the foremost of those who belong to the solar r ace ; the sun b eing the supreme type of the soul, as the Vivifier f or ever.

He makes the significant remark, -- \"I hasten to"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"escape the Shad es!\" whose shadows have been u tili sed b y our fr iends, the Theosoph ists, to explain away, or m inimi se the e xtant phenomena ca lled Spiritualistic. \"The Third p rinciple, o r astral bod y,\" says M r. Sinnett, \"is that which is at tim es taken for the ghost of departed p ersons! Also, it m ay exude from t he bod y of a spiritualistic medium, bu t it i s no more a being than the c loud in the sky can b ecome a n anim al, althou gh it m ay show a spurious s emblance in its form.\" This is to introdu ce the direst confusion, and to u tterly mystify that which is s ufficiently mystical! The c orporeal or third soul of the series , on ly persists as a type, b eca use it was once the highest representative of the soul. Souls that passed o ff into spirit - world when the soul was but a shade or covering soul, d id no t become sunshades in h eaven no r fire - proofs in h ell -- nor can they issue fr om t he medium's bod y as s uch, even through the sunshade is retained as a pictorial type of that soul! Yet the sunshade has an equal right to b e c lassed among the Elementaries with the Astral Shade, o r any other symbol of the soul. Indeed, the Siamese have the sunshade a s a seven - fold type. Their sacred u mbrella, that used to b e the sunshade of r oyalty, h ad seven tiers to it, which represented the seven h eavens in the mythical phase, and the seven souls in the mystical sense. The spirit t hat returned to eart h when the soul was the c orporeal shade, and the third was the highest in the series, would be the Shade; this being the c orporeal soul, when it appeared on a visit t o the living it was suppo sed to go b ack to the bod y in the tomb, and to p ass away altogeth er as the bod y deca yed. It could no t go to h eaven when there was no h eaven made out to go to. Being third in the series, this would b ecome a ghost that only lived up to the third generation -- as we find it among the Zulu Kaffirs! But the shade never could b e one of seven souls emanating from t he bod y of a medium. In such a c lim ate a s ours it would b e ec ono mi cal if every medium could materialise a nd spread ou t a c overing in that way! Of course, if you po stulate or pou rtray a soul at that imm ature stage of dev elopment, it will be withou t mi nd o r memory, language, o r individuality. It will be a shadow indeed! And so it reappears amongst the ghosts of Esoteric Buddh ism, bu t it i s not one of the Intelligences kno wn to modern Spiritualism. We may as well say that t he soul of blood b eca me a red mouse, and the soul that fed on b lood b eca me a hawk, and so on all t hrough the series of types; which they did acc ording to the system of representation, althou gh no t in reality. The Sevens were a ll correlated, the seven eleme ntal powers, with the seven elements in man; and these seven souls, o r elemental parts of man, were a ssigned to seven creators, or gods, and considered as s even creations in mythology, eac h o f which h ad its zootype, such as the red mouse, the hawk, the a pe , jackal, serpent, b eetle, and crocodile. Seven zootypes having been adop ted to represent seven elements in external nature, these or their equivalents were c ontinued to express the seven elements or souls in man. The Shrew mouse was an Egyptian type of th e first formation, the soul No. 1, the \"blind Horus,\" as he was called; the hawk, o f the second soul, that of breath and o f sight; t he monk ey, o f reflection (the other self); the jackal, o f memory; the serpent (or goose which laid the e gg), o f the transfor mation into adultship; t he frog (or beetle), o f the transformation into an intellect; and the c rocodile, Sevekh, which is number seven, into the Seer unseen, the soul as s upreme one of the seven souls. Now, as a soul was once typified b y the red mouse, it is certain that the soul or gho st will be seen a s a red mouse; and acc ordingly this s oul was s een as the red mouse that came out of the sleeper's mouth, in a German story. This red mouse of a soul is also mentioned b y Go√´the in \"Faust.\" That"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"is the red mou se that typified the prim ary soul of blood. The German godd ess Holda, the rece iver of children's s ouls, is represented as comm anding a multit ude of mi ce. Moreover, the mouse is s ure to survive in a sort of spirit - world; and h ere we have it. The moon was a re - birthplace for the most elementary or r udim entary souls, b eca use it was the first step on the planetary ladder, abov e the sublunary sphere. And so we find the myth o f souls in the moon in the shape of littl e mi ce. The Dakota Indians s ay the waning of th e moon is caused b y multit udes of mi ce that are nibbling at it and causing its disappearance -- the mouse being an Egyptian emblem of disappearance. The mouse was a type of the first Horus, o r soul No. 1. The hawk is a type of the soul of breath, o r soul No. 2, b eca use a s Hor - Apollo explains, the hawk d rinks blood, n ever water, and the soul is s ustained b y blood. As there was a soul that fed on b lood in this life, the soul emaned from t he bod y in d eath at that stage of thou ght and expression, will continue th e type in another phase a nd sphere; so we have a soul or spirit of the dead that is s uppo sed to come out of the c orpse to suck the blood o f the living; and the origin o f the Vampire, that only lives by drinking human b lood, h as to b e sought at this depth o f rootage; for the blood - sucking demons of various kinds are held to b e human souls, and not t he e lemental powers personified. If you consider ( as I do) the ghost t o b e a n objective fact in n ature, the power to d emonstrate, and the vision for seeing, may h ave existed from t he ea rliest tim es, and there would b e a pparitions when the biology had on ly identified the blood with the soul of life! Now there is not only evidence of a haunting spirit at this s tage -- a soul of blood -- a gory ghost, as the Vampire, bu t certain evil spirits, when conqu ered b y a Mage like Solomon, always fled to, and were drowned in, the Red Sea, which was their f abled ho me a nd b irthplace . That i s the Egyptian Red Lake of Prim ordial Matter! In the Book o f the Dead, certain und eveloped and rudim entary souls are sent back again, doo med to b e resolved into the prim al element, and are said in the texts to b e supp ressed in b lood ; they make their typical return to that from which they came. Each o f the Seven Principles, o r Appetites, o r souls, h a d the physical prototype, that was separately preserved b y the Egyptians -- the brain, tongue, h eart, stomach, and o ther vehicles of life. Thus when the Kroo n egroes hold that the stomach of a man ascends to heaven after death, we ca n und erstand it as a repr esentative of one of the souls, o r appetites. This s oul of the stomach would n eed to b e fed. No wond er, then, if we shou ld hear of a demon in the shape of a stomach that goes abou t seeking whom it may devou r. This is the Kephu of the Karens, a wandering wi zard's s tomach suppo sed to p rey upon the souls of men. Raw flesh and b lood were offered to the uncivilised and gory ghost. But in the second phase a Soul of Breath would b e more refined and no t considered capable of consumi ng material food. At this s tage w e hear of the spirits s nuffing the vapou rs and steam of victuals, inhaling the e ssences and smelling the a roma of food o r the fragrance of flowers. In fine, we see provisions cold and ho t offered -- some things to eat and o thers to smell -- the bod y and spirit of alim ent, so to say, b eing presented to the Corporeal Soul of Matter and the less palpable Soul of Breath."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The shrew - mouse, o r the bird, h as no likeness to the human b eing, bu t the a pe has a littl e. And at this third stage the nearest li keness to the hu man is adapted to express the other, or reflected, self, at the stage of the third soul; t he Shade in Egypt is s ynon ymous with the God Shu, on e of whose types is the Great Ape. The Ape, as a type of the Soul, may acc oun t for the African superstiti on o f men being changed into monk eys after death; the primiti ve symbol having been literalised.

The Marawi say the souls of bad men after deat h will become jackals; and the jackal was another of the e lementaries, the one who po ssibly represented the fourth soul, that of memory, as he was made the remembrancer and recorder of the gods.

The a ncient typology was continued, and remains to b e interpreted.

But the human soul in its upward ascent had no t actual ly passed through the stages of the mouse, h awk, ape, jackal, goose, b eetle, and crocodile; nor will it return to o r in any such shapes; nor did it project seven such elementaries as its s hadows into spirit - world; nor did any primiti ve race , whether savage , Egyptian, o r Hindu, ever think these things. Nor were they evolutionists in the Darwinian sense. It was a mode of expression, still readable in the Ritual, where the speaker, in making his transformations of the soul, says -- \"I am the mouse,\" \" I am the ha wk,\" \" I am the ape;\" jackal, goose, o r serpent; \"I am the c rocodile whose soul comes from m en\" -- that is, a s a type of intelligence; \"I am the soul of the god s,\" the Horus, or Christ, as the outcome of all.

It is in vain that the Pseudo - Esoterists try to saddle modern Spiritualism with this bestial set of acquaintances, elementaries, shadows, and shells as our relatives in another world. They are ignorant of the beginning, the natural genesis of this s ystem of represe ntation. They do no t seem t o kno w that t he transformations of Buddh a were of the same character, and o riginated in the same zoomorphic typology. The Buddh a, o r supreme soul, that reac hes the top o f attainment as the outcome of the previous s even, h as in a sense been all seven, b eca use of the one life runn ing through them all -- just as the mature man h as been bo y, b abe, embryo. It consequently follows that whatsoever types the seven have been masked und er, o r r epresented b y, may be a pplied to the Buddh a a s th e ascending human soul. Hence he has various transmi grations and re - births, in which h e emerges now as a bird, an ape, a frog -- now as one kind o f anim al, no w as another, beca use these were a t first symbolic of the seven elements of bod y and soul that m ade up the totality of being -- which elements in man, o r in external nature, h ad b een im aged b y the zootypes of totemi sm t hat were c ontinued as ideographs in a later phase of thou ght, and h ad no reference a t all t o any remote c ourse of pre - human evolution on ea rth.

Such symbolical representation was made ac tual in India, where such souls are sent back to earth as beasts or reptiles. It is affirmed in the Book o f Manu that \"In whateve r disposition a man a ccomplishes s uch and such an a ct, h e shall reap the f ruit i n a bod y e ndo wed with such and such a qua lity.\" As Hor - Apollo says, the Egyptians denoted a people obedient to their king, b y depicting a bee! and then the Jewish Rabbins, adop ting the type, say the soul of a governor who exalts him self proud ly abov e his people, goes into a bee! When the Jews s peak o f souls that mi grate into b easts and b irds, and Plato o f souls being re - incarnated into b irds and beasts, they are making unwarrantable use of the primiti ve typology. In the later teac hings, conv eyed b y me ans of the a ncient symbolism, it was threatened that the fleshly soul would b e reborn as a mouse or an ass; the thief would b ecome a rapacious rat; t he coward, a reptile; the blood thirsty tyrant a vulture, o r devou ring beast of prey; the lowest classes, in to the vilest creatures. This is but the other side of the same mental coinage, and it i s only to b e und erstood as belonging to the same symbolism.

The natural genesis was physical and followable; the e xpression was typical. In the later metaphysical phase we have only the shadow, the returning manes of the once living meaning, trying to p ass itself off as a revelation o f future reality. Metamorpho sis of the soul was ancestral, b iological, and figurative, at first; t h en it was continued in the astrono mi cal allegory -- both o f which are omitt ed b y the pseudo - Esoterists.

(that is, to b ring Christ down;) or, Who shall descend into the abyss?

But what do we find there in p l ace of the mi ssing fact? The scene of Lazarus being raised from the dead. This is depicted ov er and ov er again as the typical resurrection where there is no real one! Christ of Egypt reprodu ced in Rome like the other Mythical types perpetuated there by Gno stic Art. As the im age is Egyptian, it i s probable that the name is s o likewise. Las (or ras) signifies to b e raised up, and aru is another name for the Mumm y - type; so that Las - aru, or Lazarus, with the Greek termi nal, is the Egyptian symbol of resurrectio n called the Karast, or Christ.

When I say \" THE Pool of Peace \" is in Hebrew Salem or Shloam, I am speaking of THE mythical poo l which in Egyptian is the Pool of Hept or Peace , no t the topo graphical poo l of Siloam. I was only concerned with the identity of THE mythical or iginal which h ad v arious localisations in d ifferent lands, Judea included. Mr. Coleman runs a long rigmarole a bou t the godd ess \"Nu\" and the place \"Annu, \" in which h e flound ers in the bottoml ess bog of his own h elpless ignorance, p ast all pulling out by tho se who h ave taken h im by the hand -- viz., Messrs. Sayce a nd --- . He who enters this domain so unp repared and un equipped as M r. Coleman, must be a fore - damned fool. I could h ave pitied h is im potency but for his ineffable c onceit and aggressive insolence. Be cause I use the words \"An\" and \"Annu \" as s ynon yms, this great Egyptologist asserts that I identify the Lady of \"An\" with the godd ess \"Nu\" to form the word Annu. As the monk ey exclaim ed when h e saw the e lephant taking in water at such a rate, \"To d rink with the tail i s imm ense!\" An and Annu are sim ply Egyptian v ariants of one word; different spellings of the same word were the result of f amili arity with matters upon which my corrector is s o u tterly ignorant that he look s upon and d enoun ces the variants in Eg yptian spelling as my distortion of Egyptian n ames, and sapiently suggests that \"there always app ears to b e an ob ject\" in my changes! He thinks the \"Lady with the long hair\" is Tefnut, and no t the godd ess Nu as I had inferred, p artly beca use the Ritual say s \"The hair of the Osiris is in the shap e of that of Nu\" (Ch. xlii.), and p artly beca use the Osiris ascends the heaven, o r Nu, with h is long hair down to h is s hou lders. Either way it matters very littl e. What I do regret i s that I could no t have had the a dvantage of kno wing what Mr. Coleman thinks abou t Egyptian mythology before writing my book.

He further charges me with h aving got certain godd esses mi xed up ; it being his mi ssion to teac h me how to separate them once more a nd distinguish b etween them i ndividually. Here he tries to turn h is ignorance to acc oun t by taking advantage of the reader's and p rodu cing the im pression that the ignorance is mi ne. He throws dust in the e yes of others and then says it was I who d id it. And Mr. Sayce, in a c loud o f it, swears it t o me! I may admit t hat this parallel of the Woman at the Well, which is but one out of fifty, is the weakest one. Bu t it i s enou gh for my purpose to show that the Osiris or Osirified (these being identical in character) appears at the Well or Pool of Peace ; that he c laim s to be the Well and p ersonates the Water; that the source of this water of life given to the Son is the Father; that a well or flow of this water comes out of Osiris to h im; t hat the well of this water comes through h im (Cf. John v ii. 38, and iv. 14. ); that he washes in the \"poo l of Peace,\" where the Osirified are made pure or healed: where the \"certain times,\" as I have ca lled them (beca use the seasons for healing are dua l in the Ritual) are detailed thus -- \"The Gods of the pure waters are there on the fourth hou r of the night and the eighth hou r of the day,\" saying, \"pass away hence\" to h im who h as been cured o r healed. Here it i s noticea ble that in the still - continued p rocess of elimi nating that which look s too mythical, this passage c ontaining the ang el descending to troub le the waters and turn them into a Pool of healing ha s been d ropp ed from the lates t revised version o f John 's Gospel. In conv erting the original m ythos into later history, this process of picking the owner's name or sign from stolen good s has gone on from t he first, and is not yet ended! I do not say or suppo se a nything so sim ple a s tha t t he writer of John 's Gospel was copying from some \"variant and ob scure c hap ter in an an cient Egyptian pap yrus.\" That is M r. Coleman's foolish way of putting it. That was not exactly the way in which the Osirian legend got lit eralized in Rome. If it had b een p reserved and continued a s mythos, it could no t have re - app eared und er the guise of historic Christianity. The matter had to b e manipulated, conv erted, assimil ated, in which p rocess the original features have been somewhat deface d. This has to b e a llo wed for in judging of my parallels, comparisons, and interpretations. There must of nece ssity be a wide gulf between any one who acce pts the Gospel history as pure matter of fact, and on e who treats it as mainly mythical. The two can on ly talk to different classes of mi nds s eparated for the tim e being by that gulf, across which they can hardly hear eac h o ther speak. But perhaps the most perfect of all m y critic's manifold errors and monstrous blund ers is this. He writes a long essay in six columns to d efend a passage in the Johannine Gospel against m y mythical interpretation, with the intention o f demonstrating the \"stupendou s"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"display of ignorance a nd absurdity\" which h e finds in my volumes. He fights tooth and nail on b ehalf of t he historical i nterpretation against t he mythical. His one line of argument, h is raison d '√™tre all t hrough, is that the e vents und er review, the woman at the well, the Christ who d rinks there, and o ther circumstances, are historical! And yet in the opening paragraph o f his article he had started with saying -- \"It is s ignificant that most of these so called New Testament parallels are derived from the fourth Gospel, popu larly ascribed to John. Every c ompetent biblicist knows that t he accoun t of Jesus and h is teachings given in John 's Go spel differs widely from those given in the first t hree Gospels; and there is no reasonab le doub t, in the light of historico - critical biblical science, that, while large portions of the latter are genuinely historical, the Gospel of John, a s a whole, is UN HISTORICAL, MYTHICAL.\" Good God! the man is here throwing away the c hild with the water it was washed in! If this be so, and, as I demonstrate, the mythical gospel was first, no matter how late it appeared in the ca non ical gospel ascribed to John, the supp osed h istory of the Synop tics goes to the ground ! Where is the sanity in suppo sing that the Mythical m atter of John 's Gospel i s the result of tattooing Egyptian fables all over the face of historic fact (as previously pou rtrayed b y the Synop tics), and d isf iguring the human features past all recognition? The Christ of John is indefinitely divine, and that is first: the final phase look s definitely historic. That is how the Mythology was humanised. The Myth - Makers were Fabulists, bu t not the forgers of facts; the forgers are they who conv erted the fable into h istoric fact. Mr. Coleman says only just what I say and show on b ehalf of the Mythos. But what then was the sense, o r where was the sanity in labou ring to p rove it t o be historic bit by bit, when, a s a wh ole, it i s entirely unh istorical and mythical? Yet Messrs. Sayce a nd --- assure Mr. Coleman, with their complim ents, that he is r ight. I fancy some of my readers will suspect that he is not -- quite. And this is what it i s to b e demolished! This is doing a \"real service to the c ause of truth.\" So says the Rev. Mr. Sayce, and h e is an authority. Mr. Coleman charges me with limiting my quo tations from t he Egyptian Ritual to Dr. Birch's version o f the \"very c orrupt Turin Text,\" as if he were a n authority respec ting the Texts! -- and then o f mi squo ting the Texts to establish my parallel. Whereas my slight departures from t he Text (in Bunsen) are the result of various emendations or corrections made by the Egyptologists, such as Renou f, including Dr. Birch h im self, to whom I took them for his final opinion, and with whom I have gone over Text after Text for that purpose. I neglected no available source of kno wledge, early or late. Also in regarding, cond ensing, and conn ecting certain p assages, I wrote with the whole matter of the Mythos in mi nd, and h ad the Ritual well - nigh b y heart; which is to b e a t an enormous disadvantage when judg ed b y Mr. Coleman.

Mr. Renou f has declared (Hibbert Lectures, p. 243 ) that \"neither Hebrews nor Greek s borrowed an y of t heir ideas from Egypt\" (see Herodo tus, Plato, Plutarch, Diodo rus Siculus, and o thers). He thinks the \"mythological symbolism\" of Egypt arose from \"varieties of metapho rical languag e\" which \"reacted upon though t\" and \"obtained the ma stery\" (Ib. p. 237 ). Following Max M√ºller he says, \"Mythology, we k now, is the disease which springs up a t a p eculiar s tage of human culture\" (Ib. p. 251 ). Nonsense.

When I pointed ou t this passage to Dr. Birch, h e said, \"Certainly; the types in the planisphere are not Greek . Renou f shou ld ha ve don e as the artists did who ga ve the Greek on on e side, the Egyptian on the other.\" All t hat he was warranted in saying is that the mythological types, Typhon, Sut, Isis, Horus, Seb, Shu - and - Tefnut, and the rest of those that neve r were Greek , have been reprodu ced at a later period b y Greco - Egyptian artists, with a few modernisations. If he intended to d istinguish b etween the Zodiaca l and extra - Zodiaca l signs of the p lanisphere, he shou ld h ave said so.

That delight in life was intended b y means of health and happiness may likewise be read in the stern pun ishment admi nistered b y nature for every breac h o f natural law by which we injure our health and d estroy our happiness; and, lest the personal m emory of the fact for one gen eration shou ld b e too short - lived, the results and effects of the violated law are kept before us, in some ca ses from generation to generation, not as gibbets for mere vengeance, bu t as s ign - posts pointing to the way of reformation. Health is intended, and happiness is the result. It is the happy who will be moral; not the mi serable. Now, the Christian scheme would make us mi serable, in o rder that we may be moral here a nd h appy hereafter! Whereas Nature says, b e happy here a nd now, b y learning the laws of h ealth -- individual, social, po liti cal, un iversal; by getting rid of all oppo sing falsehood, and establishing the true c ond itions for evolving health and happiness everywhere for all. \"But,\" it has actually been u rged in reply to me, and in arrest of judgm ent, \"suppo sing the Christian Narrative to b e e ntirely mythical, is not this s upreme legend o f divinest pity a beautiful and touching story?\" Yes, and the more beautiful the dece it, the deeper the delusion. If it were only a dramatic representation, the pl ea would apply. But this thing has no meaning if it i s not humanly true. The supreme legend o f divine pity! That is pity for a fallen race on the part of a suppo sed d eity who d amned mankind for ever f or the stealing of an apple! Why, ou r own unp aid magistr acy -- who are not over - lenient -- would not have made more of it t han a matter of fourteen d ays, o r a month at m ost. Suppo se you do touch the heart of the world upon false pretences, even to the e xtent of drawing a tear from John Morley, o r getting a perfumed p astill e offered up as a sweet savou r in sacrificial smoke by Renan, where is the gain when on ce the falsehood is found ou t? As soon as the theological Scotsman d iscovers that his found ations of belief in the fall of man, in p redestination, h ell - fire, and eternal damnation are false, h e naturally takes to whisky, and maybe for the rest of his life ca nno t find a b rand that is quite fiery e nough ! The illusion o f false ideals is always at war with reality. The Christ of the Gnostics was a true ideal, po ssible to all m en. But an Historic Christ is a false ideal! Where is the sense of suppo sing a God sliding down to earth on a ladder with no steps to it, and then asking us to walk up mi nus the foothold? Also, it i s in v ain we set up an ob jective ideal for outer worship o f that which can on ly be a reality within the soul. The god - man o f the Gnostics was not a man - god, bu t the god o r divine nature in man, which represented the spiritual im age of the Invisible God, the forml ess in ou r human form; not in our human fo rm of individual personality as an h istorical Christ, or Horus, or Buddh a.

We have lost t he power to make believe a nd d ece ive ourselves further in this matter! It canno t be too o ften repeated that the found ations of the Christian faith were laid in falsehood and ignorance . The Fall of man in the beginning was not a fact, and consequently there c ould b e no curse. It is but a fable mi sinterpreted; and the redemption o f the New Testament is based upon a fable in the Old. There is no virtue nor efficac y in a vicarious atonemen t, and no priesthood ever had o r will have the power to forgive sin, to b reak the sequence between cause a nd effect, o r to evade the Nemesis of Natural law. When the great delusion comes to an end its true e pitaph would be, -- \"This was a fraud found ed on a fable.\" Meanwhile, the Church that continues to pu t forth this s cheme of salvation and im pose it on the pub lic a t the e xpense of the nation (some e ight or ten milli ons annu ally!) ought not only to b e disestablished and disendo wed, it ought t o b e prosecuted for obtaining money on d emonstrably false pretences! We a re often told that our civilisation is infinitely indebted to Christianity; but on the other hand it could b e shown that Christianity has been infinitely indebted to civilisation, beca use it beca me the a dop ted religion, the official religion, o f the race s that happened to be in the swim and current of European p rogress. Indeed, ou r European p rogress has been in exact propo rtion as the c ivil l aw and p re - extant comm on law have got the upp er hand of th e ecc lesiastical usurpation.

Spiritualism i s s ure t o b e terribly icono clastic! It means a new light of revelation in the world from t he old eternal source. And you canno t have new light let in withou t seeing many old acquaintances with a new face . Many aspects of things will change; and some things that we mi stook for live face s will t urn into the sheerest m asks of mockery, and whiten with the sweat of dissolution runn ing down them. Spiritualism, as I interpret it , means a new life in the world, and n ew life is not brought forth withou t pain and p arting, an d the sheddings of old d eca y. New ideas are not born in the mi nd withou t the pangs of parturition; and to get rid o f our old ingrained errors of false teac hing is like having to tear up b y the root the snags of one's own teeth with ou r own h and. But, b y ou r own h and and will, this has to b e don e, for nothing else can do it. New light and n ew life, ho wever, do no t come to im pov erish, they come to enrich, and no harm can b efall t he nature of that which is eternally true. It i s only falsehood that fears or nee ds to fear the transfiguring touch o f light; that must needs shrink and shrink un til it shrivels away. Spiritualism will prove a mi ghty icono clast, bu t the fetishes and idols it destroys will yield up their concea led treasures of innermost truth, as did th e statue that was destroyed b y Mahmoud, the im age - breaker. The priestly defenders offered h im an enormous s um t o spare their God, bu t he resisted the bribe a nd smote mi ghtily with h is iron mace . Down fell t he im age, and as it broke there rolled ou t of it a river of pent - up wealth, which h ad b een ho arded and h idden within. Evolution, for which no place has been left in the Christian system of thou ght, is of itself quite ca pable of being the death o f that system; but Spiritualism will und ermi ne it, and dig i ts grave, and p lant it with another nob ler life. Spiritualism has already proved itself to b e the greatest solvent of ancient dogmas ever kno wn. It has acted, and is acting, like Hannibal's vinegar on the Alps, b y crumbling the most stupendou s obstacles of mental progress. The Spiritualistic religion is going to conqu er beca use it i s not afraid o f any new facts that m ay be dug out of the ea rth, o r drawn do wn from t he heavens. It is bound to conqu er, b eca use with it free - thinking is no longer on the side of negation. Our old Free - thinkers were brave men who d rew a new breath o f fr eer life through the e nlarging lungs of the world, b y daring to think freely -- braver men than ou r Spiritualists are, who are sadly in n eed o f a fiery course of persecution to test th e metal of their manhood. But on the old material plane they soon came to where their foothold cea sed, and they could get no further. The freer thou ght of the Spiritualist gives him arms to swim t he sea, and wings to moun t the a ir, when h e c omes to where t he ea rth ends, -- and to the Materialist there seemed no more solid ground.

So far fr om Woman having been the ca use of any pretended Fall of man, she has been the true Saviour of humanity; or r ather, the main instrument for saving beca use more open to the Divine influence, which I hold to b e for ever working to prevent the propagation o f man's wors er mood s, and the personification o f his baser self. Often h as s he tried to h inder man when h e was devilishly bent on d efacing the c omi ng im age of the divine! And this alone, with h er back to the wall, in p lace s where there was no law on h er side. How many idiots, think you, are born into the world through d runk en fathers? Idiocy is an arrested d evelopment. Drunk enness is also an arrest of the soul in its brain action, which means that the idiot child is often a tiny, p itiful im age of the father who was in a state of moral idiocy. The spiritual li fe was arrested; and there is as great a deficiency of soul as there is of blood in the brain when you swoon. It is a moral swoon made visible a nd p ermanent in a hidden effigy of Death - in - life.
