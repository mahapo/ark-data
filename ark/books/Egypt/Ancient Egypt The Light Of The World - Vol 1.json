Alvin Bo yd Kuhn in The Lost Meaning of Death says of Massey that he was “the sole Egyptologist in the ranks of scholars who measurably understood what the sages of Egypt were talking about”, saying in passing, “that the renowned Egyptologists have missed the import of that body of sublime material utterly.

But, then, ignor ant as he might be, he was more or less the heir to hum an faculty as it is manifested in all its trium phs ove r ext ernal nature at the present time. Now , it has been and still is a prevalent and practically uni versal assum ption that the same mental standpoi nt might have been occupi ed by primitive man, and a like que stion asked in presence of the same or similar phe nom e na of phys ical nature. Nothing is more common or more unque stione d than the inference that primitive man woul d or coul d have asked, “Who is doi ng it?” and that the Who coul d have been personi fied in the hum an likeness. Inde ed, it has becom e an axiom with m ode rn metaphys icians and a pos tulate of the anthropol ogi sts that, from the beginni ng, man impos ed his ow n hum an image upon external nature; that he personi fied its elemental energies and fierce phys ical forces after his ow n likeness; also that this was in accordance with the funda mental character and cons titution of the hum an mind. To adduc e a few examples taken almost at random : — David Hum e declares that “there is a uni versal tende ncy among manki nd to conc eive all beings like themselves.” In suppor t of whic h he instances the seeing of hum an faces in the moon. Reid on the Active Pow ers (4th Essay) says our first thought s are that “the obj ects in which we perceive motion have unde rstandi ng and pow er as we have.” Francis Bacon had long before remarked that we h um an beings “set stamps and seals of our ow n images upon God’ s creatures and works.” ( Exp. History. ) Herbert Spencer argue d that hum an persona lity appl ied to the pow ers of nature was the primary mode of representation, and that the identification of this w ith som e natural force or obj ect is due to identity of name. ( Data of Soc iology , ch. XXIV, 184. ) “In early phi losophy throughout the world,” says Mr. Tylor, “the 1 sun and moon are alive and as it were hum an in their nature.” Professor Max Müller, who ta ught that Mythol ogy was a disease of langua ge, and that the Myths have been made out of words which had lost their senses, asserts that “the whol e animal world has been conc eived as a copy of our ow n. And not onl y the animal world, but the whol e of nature was liable to be conc eived and named by an assimilation to hum an nature.” ( Science of Thought , p. 503 .) And “such was the prope nsity in the earliest men of whom we have any authentic record to see persona l agency in everything, ” that it coul d not be otherw ise, for “there was really no way of conc eiving or naming anyt hing obj ective except after the similitude of the subj ective, or of our selves.” ( Ib., p. 495 .) Illustration of this mode rn pos ition might be inde finitely multiplied. The assum ption has been supp orted by a cons ensus of assertion, and here, as elsewhere, the present writer is com pelled to doubt , deny, and disprove the popul ar pos tulate of the accepted orthodox authorities. That, said the lion, is you r version of the story: let us be the sculptor’s , and for one lion unde r the feet of a man you shall see a dozen men beneath the pad of one lion. “Myth - making man” did not create the Gods in his ow n image. The primary divinities of Egypt , such as Sut, Sebek, and Shu, three of the earliest, were represe nted in the likeness of the Hippopot amus, the Crocodi le, and the Lion; whilst Hapi was imaged as an Ape, Anup as a Jackal, Ptah as a Beetle, Taht as an Ibis, Seb as a Goos e. So was it with the Godde sses. They are the likenesses of powers that were Supe r - hu man, not hum an. Hence Apt was imaged as a Water - cow , Hekat as a Frog, Tefnut as a Lione ss, Serkh as a Scorpion, Rannut as a Serpent, Hathor as a Fruit - tree. A huge mistake has"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"hitherto been made in assum ing that the Myth - Makers began by fashioni ng the Natu re - Pow ers in their ow n hum an likeness. Totemism was formulated by myth - making man with type s that were the very oppos ite of hum an, and in mythol ogy the Anthropom orphi c representation was preceded by the whol e menagerie of Totemic Zoot ype s. The idea of For ce, for instance, was not derived from the thews and muscles of a Man. As the Kamite Sign - Langua ge show s, the Force that was “chuc king them heaps of water about ” was perceived to be the wind; the Spirit that move d upon the face of the waters from the begin ning. This pow er was divinised in Shu, the God of breathing Force, whos e zoot ype is the Lion as a fitting figur e of this panting Pow er of the Air. The element audi ble in the how ling wind, but dimly apprehende d otherwise, was given shape and subs tance as th e roaring Lion in this subs titution of similars. The Force of the element was equa ted by the pow er of the Animal; and no hum an thews and sinews coul d com pare with thos e of the Lion as a figur e of Force. Thus the Lion speaks for itself, in the langua ge of I deogr aphi c Signs . And in this way the Gods and Godde sses of ancient Egypt were at first por trayed as Supe rhum an Pow ers by means of living Supe rhum an type s. If primitive man had projected the shadow of himself upon external nature, to shape its elemental f orces in his ow n image, or if the unf eatured Vast had unve iled to him any likeness of the hum an face, 2 then the primary representation of the Nature - Pow ers (which became the later divinities) ought to have been anthropom orphi c, and the likeness reflecte d in the mirror of the most ancient mythol ogi es shoul d have been hum an. Whereas the Pow ers and Divinities were first represented by animals, birds, and reptiles, or, to employ a word that include s all classes, they were por trayed by means of zoot ype s. The Sun and Moon were not cons idered “hum an in their nature” when the one was imaged as a Crocodi le, a Lion, a Bull, a Beetle, or a Hawk, and the other as a Hare, a Frog, an Ape, or an Ibis, as they are represented in the Egypt ian hieroglyphi cs by means of the zoot ype s. Until Har - Ur, the Elder Horus, had been depicted as the Child in place of the Calf or Lamb, the Fish, or Shoot of the Papyr us - plant (which was com paratively late), there was no human figure persona lised in the Mythol ogy of Egypt . Primitive or P aleolithic Man was too begga rly poo r in pos sessions to dream of shaping the Supe rhum an Pow ers of Nature in the hum an likeness. There is one all - sufficient reason why he did not ; he simply coul d not . And it is precisely because the Makers of the Myths had n ot the pow er to animate the uni verse in their ow n likeness that we have the zoom orphi c mode of representation as the Sign - Langua ge of Totemism and Mythol ogy. On every line of research we discove r that the representation of nature was pre - anthropom orphi c at first, as we see on goi ng back far enough, and on every line of descent the zoom orphi c passes ultimately into the hum an representation. Mode rn metaphys icians have so develope d the faculty of abstraction and the disease of Subj ectivity that their ow n menta l ope rations offer no true gui dance for generalisations conc erning primitive or early man, who thought in things and almost appr ehende d with the phys ical sense alone . They ove rlook the fact that imagi ng by means of object - pictures preceded the imagi ning s o often ascribed to primitive men. These did not bus y themselves and bot her"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"their brains with all sorts of vagrant fancies instead of getting an actual grasp of the hom eliest facts. It was not “Primitive Man” but two German metaphys icians who were looki ng out of window at a falling show er of rain when one of them remarked, “Perhaps it is I who am doi ng that .” “Or I,” chimed in the other. The present writer onc e had a cat before whom he placed a sheet of pol ished tin. The cat saw herself reflected as in a m irror, and looke d for a shor t time at her ow n image. So far as sight and appe arance went, this might have been anot her cat. But she proceeded to appl y the com parative process and test one sense by anot her, deliberately smelling at the likeness to find out if any cat was there. She did not sit dow n as a non - verifying visiona ry to formulate hypot heses or conj ure up the ghos t of a cat. Her sense of smell told her that as a matter of fact there was no other cat present; therefore she was not to be misled by a f alse appe arance, in which she took no further interest. That, we may infer, was more like the action of Primitive Man, who woul d find no hum an likeness behind the phe nom ena of external nature. Inde ed, man was so generally represented by the animals that th e appe arance coul d be mistaken for a primitive belief that the animals were his ancestors. But the pow ers 3 first perceived in external nature were not onl y unl ike the hum an; they were very empha tically and distinctly more than hum an, and therefore coul d not be adequa tely expr essed by features recogni sable as merely hum an. Primitive men were all too abjectly helpless in presence of these pow ers to think of them or to conc eive them in their ow n similitude . The one primordial and most definite fact of the w hol e matter was the distinct and absolute unl ikeness to themselves. Also they themselves were too little the cause of anyt hing by the work of their ow n hands to enter into the sphe re of causation mentally. They coul d onl y appr ehend the nature - forces by the ir effects, and try to represent these by means of other pow ers that were present in nature, but which were also necessarily supe rior to the hum an and were not the hum an faculties inde finitely magni fied. The hum an being coul d onl y impress his ow n image on external nature in propor tion to his mastery ove r natural condi tions . He coul d not have figur ed the Thunde r - bol t as a Stone - axe in the hands of a destroyi ng Pow er until he himself had made and coul d wield the axe of stone as the weapon of his ow n pow er. Bu t he coul d think of it in the likeness of the Serpent already know n to him in external nature as a figure of fatal force. An ignor ant expl anation of the Egypt ian Sign - Langua ge was begun by the Greeks, who coul d not read the hierogl yphi cs. It was repeated by the Rom ans, and has been perpetuated by “Classical Schol ars” ever since. But, as the interpreter of Egypt , that kind of schol astic know ledge is entirely obs olete. Ignor ance of primitive sign - langua ge has been and is a fertile sour ce of false belief. For example, Juve nal asks, “Who doe s not know what kind of mons ters Egypt insanely worships?” (Sat., 15, 1.) And having seen or heard of the long - tailed Ape in an Egypt ian temple, the satirist assum ed without que stion that this animal was set up as an obj ect of worship. He did not know that the Ape itself was the worshippe r, as an image in Sign - Langua ge and as the Saluter of the Gods . Ani, the name of this particular Ape, denot es the Saluter, and to salute was an Egypt ian gesture of ador ation. The Ape or Cynoc epha lus with its paws upl ifted is the typi cal worshippe r as Saluter of the Light . It was, and still is, looke d upon in Africa generally as"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"a pre - hum an Moon - worshippe r, who laments and bewails the disappe arance of its night - light and rejoices at the renewal and return of that lum inary. (Hor - Apol lo, B. I, 14. Also Captain Burton, in a letter to the author .) In the Vigne ttes to the Ritual, Ani the Ape is the Saluter of the rising Sun, that is of Ra, upon the Mount of Sunr ise. One of the most profound perversio ns of the past has been made in misappr ehendi ng this primitive sign - langua ge for what is designa ted “Worship,” whether as “Sun - Worship,” “Serpent - Worship,” “Tree - Worship,” or “Phallic - Worship.” The Tree, for example, is a type , but the type is not necessar ily an obj ect of worship, as misunde rstood by thos e who do not read the type s when these are root ed in the ground of natural fact. The forest - folk were dw ellers in the trees, or in the bus h. The tree that gave them food and shelter grew to be an obj ect of regard. Hence it became a type of the Mother - Earth as the birthpl ace and abode . Hence Hathor was the hut or hous e of Horus (Har) in the tree. But worship is a word of cant employe d by writers who are 4 ignor ant of sign - langua ge in general. Such phr ases a s “Stock - and - stone worship” expl ain not hing and are worse than useless. The Mother and Child of all mythology are represented in the Tree and Branch. The Tree was a type of the abode , the Roof - tree; the Mother of food and drink; the giver of life and shelt er; the wet - nurse in the dew or rain; the produc er of her offspring as the branch and promise of periodi c cont inui ty. Was it the Tree then the Egypt ians worshippe d, or the Giver of food and shelter in the Tree? On the Apis Stele in the Berlin Museum two pr iests are saluting the Apis - Bull. This is designa ted “Apis - worship.” But the Apis carries the Solar Disk betwixt its horns. This also is being saluted. Which then is the obj ect of worship? There are two obj ects of religious regard, but neither is the obj ec t of ador ation. That is the God in spirit who was represented as the Soul of life in the Sun and in the Tree, also by the fecunda ting Bull. In this and a thous and other instances it is not a que stion of worship but of sign - langua ge. Nor did Mythol ogy spri ng from fifty or a hundr ed different sour ces, as freque ntly assum ed. It is one as a system of representation, one as a moul d of thought , one as a mode of expression, and all its great primordial types are virtually universal. Neither do the myths that were inhe rited and repeated for ages by the later races of men afford any direct criterion to the intellectual status of such races. A mythical representation may be savage without thos e who preserve it being savages. When the Egypt ians in the time of Unas spe ak of the deities devour ing soul s it is no proof of their being canni bals at the time. Mythol ogy has had an almost limitless descent. It was in a savage or crude ly primitive state in the most ancient Egypt , but the Egypt ians who cont inue d to repeat the Myt hs did not remain savages. The same mythical mode of representing nature that was proba bly extant in Africa 100, 000 years ago survives to - day amongs t races who are no longe r the produc ers of the Myths and Märchen than they are of langua ge itself. Egypt ian mythol ogy is the oldest in the world, and it did not begin as an explanat ion of natural phe nom ena, but as a representation by such primitive means as were available at the time. It doe s not expl ain that the Sun is a Hawk or the Moon a Cat, or the solar God a Crocodi le. Such figur es of fact belong to the sym bolical mode of rende ring in the langua ge of animals or zoot ype s. No better definition of “Myth” or Mythol ogy coul d be given than is conve yed by the word “Sem” in Egyptian. This signi fies representation o n"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the ground of likeness. Mythol ogy, then, is “representation on the ground of likeness,” which led to all the forms of sign - langua ge that coul d ever be employe d. The matter has been touc hed upon in previous vol um es, but for the pur pos e of com pleteness it has to be demons trated in the present work that external nature was primarily imaged in the pre - hum an likeness. It was the same here as in external nature: the animals came first, and the predecessors of Man are primary in Sign - Langua ge, Mythol ogy, and Tot emism. It is qui te certain that if the primitive method had been Conc eptual and early man had pos sessed the pow er to impos e the likeness of hum an persona lity upon external phe nom ena it woul d have been in the image of the Male, as a type or in the type s of pow er; whereas the primal hum an personi fication is in the likeness of the female. The 5 great Mother as the primal Parent is a Universal type. There coul d be no divine Father in Heaven unt il the fatherhood was indi vidua lised on earth. Again, if primitiv e men had been able to impos e the hum an likeness on the Mother - Nature the typi cal Wet - nur se woul d have been a wom an. But it is not so; the Woman com es last. She was preceded by the Beast itself, the Sow , the Hippopot amus, or Lione ss, and by the female form that wears the head of the Zoot ype , the Cow , Frog or Serpent, on the body of a divinity. Moreove r, the hum an likeness woul d, of necessity, have include d Sex. But the earliest pow ers recogni sed in nature are represented as being of no Sex. It is said in th e Akka dian hym ns, “Female they are not , male they are not .” Therefore they were not imaged in the hum an likeness. The elements of air, earth, water, fire, darkne ss and light are of no sex, and the pow ers first recogni sed in them, whether as destructive or beneficent, are cons eque ntly without sex. So far from Nature having been conc eived or imaged as a non - natural Man in a Mask, with features more or less hum an, how ever huge ly magni fied, the mask of hum an persona lity was the latest that was fitted to the fac e of external nature. Masks were appl ied to the face of nature in the endeavour to feature and visibly present som e likeness of the ope rative elemental forces and manifesting pow ers of Air, Fire, Water, Earth, Thunde r and Light ning, Darkne ss and Dawn, Ecli pse and Earthqua ke, Sand - storm or the drow ning waters of the Dark. But these masks were Zoom orphi c, not hum an. They imaged the most pot ent of devour ing beasts, most cunni ng of reptiles, most pow erful birds of prey. In these mons trous masks we see the Prima l Pow ers of Nature all at play, as in the Pantom ime, which still preserves a likeness to the primordial representation of external nature that is now chiefly know n unde r the names of Mythol ogy and Totemism. The Elemental pow ers ope rant in external nature w ere supe rhum an in the past as they are in the present. The Voice of Thunde r, the death - stroke of light ning, the Coup de Soleil, the force of fire, or of water in flood and the wind in a hur ricane were supe rhum an. So of the Animals and Birds: the pow ers of the hippopot amus, crocodi le, serpent, hawk, lion, jackal, and Ape were supe rhum an, and therefore they were adopt ed as zoot ype s and as primary representatives of the supe rhum an Pow ers of the Elements. They were adopt ed as primitive Ideogr aphs . They were ado pted for use and cons cious ly stamped for their representative value, not ignor antly worshippe d; and thus they became the coins as it were in the current medium of exchange for the expr ession of primitive though t or feeling."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Sign - langua ge include s the gest ure - signs by which the mysteries were danced or otherwise dramatized in Africa by the Pygm ies and Bushm en; in Totemism, in Fetishism, and in hierogl yphi c sym bol s; very little of which langua ge has been read by thos e who are cont inua lly treading water in th e shallow s of the subj ect without ever touc hing bot tom or attaining foot hol d in the depths. It is by means of sign - langua ge that the Egypt ian wisdom keeps the records of the pre - historic past. The Egypt ian hierogl yphi cs show us the conne ction betwixt words and things , also betwixt sounds and words, in a very primitive range of hum an thought . There is no other such record know n in all the world. They cons ist largely of hum an 6 gesture - signs and the sounds first made by animals, such as “ba” for the goa t, “ meaou” for the cat, “su” for the goos e, and “fu” for the Cerastes snake. But the Kamite representation by means of sign - langua ge had begun in inne r Africa before the talking animals, birds, and reptiles had been translated into the forms of gods and godde s ses by the dw ellers in the valley of the Nile. The living ideogr aphs or zoot ype s were primary, and can be traced to their original habitat and home, and to now here else upon the surface of our earth. The cow of the waters there represented the earth - Mother as the great bringe r - forth of life before she was divinised as Apt the godde ss in hum an gui se, with the head of a hippopo tamus. The ove rseeing Giraffe (or was it the Okapi?) of Sut, the hawk of Horus, the Kaf - Ape of Taht - Aan, the white Vulture of Neith, t he Jackal of Anup , and fifty others were pre - extant as the talking animals before they were delineated in semi - hum an gui se as gods and godde sses or elemental pow ers thus figur ed forth in the form of birds and beasts or fish and reptiles. The zoot ype s were extant in nature as figures ready - mode lled, pictures ready - made, hierogl yphi cs and ideogr aphs that move d about alive: pictures that were earlier than painting, statues that preceded sculpture, living nature - type s that were employe d when there were no other s know n to art. Certain primordial type s originated in the old dark land of Africa. These were perfected in Egypt and thence dispersed about the world. Amongs t them is the Earth as solid ground amidst the water of surroundi ng space, or as the bringe r - forth of life, depicted as a Water - Cow ; pos sibly the Cow of Kintu in Uganda ; the Dragon of Darkne ss or other wide - jawed Swallow er of the Light that rose up from the Abys s and coiled about the Mount of Earth at night as the Devour er; the evergreen Tree of Dawn – p re - eminently African – that rises on the horizon, or upon the Mount of Earth, from out the waters of Space; the oppos ing Elemental Pow ers beginni ng with the Twins of Light and Darkne ss who fought in Earth and Heaven and the Nether World; the Great Earth - Moth er of the Nature - pow ers; the Seven Children of her wom b, and various other type s that are one in origin and worldw ide in their range . When the solar force was yet unc om prehende d, the sinki ng Sun coul d be imaged naturally enough by the Beetle bor ing its wa y dow n through the earth, or by the Tortoise that bur ied itself in the soil: also by the Crocodi le making its passage through the waters, or the Golden Hawk that soared up through the air. This was representing phe nom ena in external nature on the ground of likeness when it coul d not be imaged directly by means of words. When it is held, as in Australia, that the Lizard first divided the sexes and that it was also the author of marriage, we have to ascertain what the Lizard signi fied in sign - langua ge, and wh en we find that, like the serpent or the Frog, it denot ed the female"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"period, we see how it distingui shed or divided the sexes and in what sense it author ised or was the author of Totemic Marriage, because of its being a sign or sym bol of feminine pube scenc e. It is said by the Amazulu, that when old Wom en pass away they take the form of a kind of Lizard. This can onl y be interpreted by know ing the ideogr aphi c value in the primitive system of Sign - Langua ge in which the Lizard was a zoot ype . The Lizard 7 app eared at pube rty, but it disappe ared at the turn of life, and with the Old Wom en went the disappe aring Lizard. The Frog which transformed from the tadpol e condition was anot her Ideogr aph of female pube scence. This may be illustrated by a story that was to ld som e time since by Miss Werner in the Cont empor ary Review which cont ains a specimen of primitive thought and its mode of expr ession in perfect survival. It happe ned that a native girl at Blantyre Mission was called by her mistress, a missiona ry’s wife, to com e and take charge of the baby. Her reply was, “Nchafuleni is not there; she is turned into a frog. ” (Werner, Cont empor ary Review, Sept., p. 378 .) She coul d not com e for a reason of Tapu, but said so typi cally in the langua ge of animals. She had made that transformation which first occurs when the young girl change s into a woman. She might have said she was a serpent or a lizard or that she was in flow er. But the frog that change d from a tadpol e was also a type of her transformation, and she had figur a tively becom e a frog for a few days of seclusion. Similarly the member of a Totem also became a frog, a beetle, a bul l or bear as a mode of representation, but not because the hum an being change d into the animal. The same things which are said at a later s tage by the ideogr aphi c Determinatives in the Egypt ian hierogl yph ics had been expr essed previously by the Inne r African zoot ype s or living Beasts, Birds and Reptiles, as may be seen in the stories told of the talking Animals by the Bushm en. The original re cords still suffice to show that the phys ical agencies or forces first perceived were not conc eived or mentally embodi ed in the hum an likeness, and that external nature offered no looki ng - glass for the hum an face. To take the very illustration adduc ed by Hum e. The original Man in the Moon did not depend upon any fancied resemblance to the hum an face. The Egyp tian Man in the Moon, Taht or Tehut i (Greek Thot h), had the head of an Ibis or of the Cynoc epha lus; bot h Ibis and Cynoc epha lus were luna r type s which preceded any hum an likeness, and these were cont inue d as heads to the hum an figur e after this had been adopt ed. The Man in the Moon, who is Taht (or Khuns u) in Egypt , had a series of predecessors in the Dog or Cynoc epha lus, the Ibis, the Beetle, the Bull, the Frog, and other ideogr aphi c figur es of luna r phe nom ena. As natural fact, the Ibis was a famous Fisher of the Nile, and its familiar figur e was adopt ed as a zoot ype of Taht, the luna r God. Where the mode rn saw the New Moon with the “auld Moon in her arm ,” the Egypt ian saw the Ibis fishing up the old dark orb from out the waters with the crescent of its curving beak, as the recove rer and Saviour of the Drow ning Light . The Moon was not looke d upon as having any hum an likeness when it was imaged as (or by) the Cat who saw in the dark; the Hare that rose up by night and went round the hor izon by leaps and bounds ; the Ibis as the returning bird of passage and messenge r of the Inunda tion; the Frog that transformed from the tadpol e; the old Beetle that renewed i tself in the earth to com e forth as the young one , or the Cow that gave re - birth to the child of light as her calf. The sun was not"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"conc eived as “hum an in its nature” when the solar force at dawn was imaged by the Lion - faced Atum ; the 8 flame of its furn ace by the fiery serpent Uati; the soul of its life by the Hawk, the Ram, or the Crocodi le, which are five Egypt ian Zoot ype s and a fivefold disproof of the sun being conc eived as or cons idered hum an in its nature or similitude . In beginni ng ab ovo our fir st lesson is to learn som ething of the Symbol ical Language of Animals, and to unde rstand what it is they onc e said as Zoot ype s. We have then to use that know ledge in simplifying the mysteries of mythol ogy . This primitive langua ge is still employe d in dive rs forms. It is extant in the so - called “dead langua ge” of the Hieroglyphi cs; the Ideogr aphs and Pictogr aphs ; in the Totemic type s, and figures of Tattoo; in the portraiture of the Nature - Pow ers which came to be divinised at lengt h in the hum an likeness as the Gods and Godde sses of Mythol ogy; and in that langua ge of the folk - fables still made use of by the Bushm en, Hottentots, and other Africans, in which the Jackal, the Dog, the Lion, the Crane, the White Vulture and other beasts and birds keep on talking as they did in the beginni ng, and cont inue more or less to say in hum an speech what they onc e said in the primitive sym bol ism; that is, they fulfil the same characters in the Märchen that were first founde d in the Mythos . It has now to be show n how the Myt hical mode of representing natural phe nom ena was based upon this primitive system of thought and expr ession, and how the things that were thought and expr essed of old in this langua ge cont inue the primary stratum of what is called “Mythol ogy” to - day. In t he most primitive pha se Mythol ogy is a mode of representing certain elemental pow ers by means of living type s that were supe rhum an like the natural phe nom ena. The founda tions of Mythol ogy and other forms of the ancient wisdom were laid in this pre - anthropo morphi c mode of primitive representation. Thus , to sum marise a few of the illustrations . The typi cal Giant Apap was an enor mous water - Reptile. The typi cal Genetrix and Mother of life was a Water - Cow that represented the Earth. The typi cal Twin - Brothers wer e two Birds or two Beasts. The typi cal twin brother and sister were a Lion and a Lione ss. The typi cal Virgin was a heifer, or a vul ture. The typi cal Messiah was a calf, a lamb or Unbu the Branch. The typi cal Provi der was a goos e. The typi cal Chief or Leade r is a lion. The typi cal Artisan is a beetle. The typi cal Phys ician is an Ibis (which adm inistered the enema to itself). The typi cal Judge is a Jackal or a Cynoc epha lus, whos e wig and collar are amusingl y sugge stive of the Engl ish Law - courts. Each and all of these and hund reds more preceded personi fication in the hum an image. The might y Infant who slew the Dragon or strangl ed serpents while in his cradle was a later subs titute for such a Zootype as the little Ichneum on, a figur e of Horus. The Ichne um on was seen to attack the cobr a di capella and make the mortal enemy hide its head and shield its most vital parts within the protecting coils of its ow n body . For this reason the lively, daring little animal was adopt ed as a zoot ype of Horus the young Solar God, who in his attack upon the Apap - Serpent made the huge and deadly reptile hide its head in its ow n enve lopi ng darkne ss. But, when the figur e is made anthropom orphi c and the tiny "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"9 Conque ror is introduc ed as the little Hero in hum an form, the beginni ng of the Mythos and its meaning are obs cured. The Ichne um on, the Hawk, the Ibis might attack the Cobr a, but it was well enough know n that a Child woul d not, cons eque ntly the original hero was not a Child, although spoke n of as a child in the literalised marvel s, miracles, and fables of “the Infancy.” It is the present writer’s cont ention that the Wisdom of the Ancients was the Wisdom of Egyp t, and that her expl anation of the Zoot ype s employe d in Sign - Langua ge, Totemism, and Mythol ogy hol ds good wherever the zo otype s survive. For example, the Cawichan Tribes say the Moon has a frog in it, and with the Selish Indi ans of North - West America the Frog (or Toad) in the Moon is equi valent to our Man in the Moon. They have a tradition that the devour ing Wolf being in lo ve with the Frog (or Toad), pursued her with great ardour and had nearly caught her when she made a desperate leap and lande d safely in the Moon, where she has remained to this day. (Wilson, Trans . of Ethnol . Soc iety, 1866, New Series, v. 4, p. 304. ) Which means that the frog, as a type of transformation, was appl ied to the changi ng Moon as well as to the Zulu girl, Nchafuleni. Sign - langua ge was from the beginni ng a subs titution of similars for the purpos e of expr ession by primitive or pre - verbal Man, who follow ed the animals in making audi ble sounds accom panied and empha sised by hum an gestures. The same system of thought and mode of utterance were cont inue d in mythogr aphy and totemism. Renouf says the Scarabeus was “an obj ect of worship in Egypt ,” as a sym bol of divinity. But this is the mode rn error. If there was a God, and the Beetle was his sym bol , obvi ous ly it was the divinity that was the obj ect of worship, not the sym bol : not the zoot ype . Ptah, we know , was that divinity, with the Beetle as a type , an d those who read the type s were worshippe rs of the God and not of his sym bol ic dung - beetle which was honour ed as a sign of transformation. When told that the Egypt ians were worshippe rs of the “Bee,” the “Mantis,” and the “Grasshoppe r,” we recall the words of Hor - Apol lo, who says that when the Egypt ians woul d sym bol ise a mystic and one of the Initiated they delineate a Grasshoppe r becaus e the insect doe s not utter soun ds with its mout h, but makes a chirping by means of its spine. (B. II, 55. ) The grasshoppe r , then, which uttered a voi ce that did not com e from its mout h, was a living type of supe rhum an pow er. And being an image of mystery and supe rhum an pow er, it was also cons idered a fitting sym bol of Kagn, the Bushm an Creator, or Great Spirit of creative mys tery. Moreove r, the grasshoppe r made his music and revealed his mystery in dancing; and the religious mysteries of Kagn were performed with dancing or in the grasshoppe r’s dance. Thus the Initiates in the mysteries of the Mantis are identical with the Egyp tian Mystæ sym bol ised by the grasshoppe r; and the dancing proba bly goe s back to the time when pre - verbal man was an imitator of the grasshoppe r, which was a primitive type of mystery, like the transforming frog and the self - interring tortoise. There is a r eligious sect still extant in Engl and who are know n as the “Jum pers,” and their saltatory exercises still identify them with the leaping “Grasshoppe rs” and the “praying Mantis” in the 10 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Mysteries of old. They still “dance that dance.” The “Moon belongs to the Mantis,” say the Bushm en, which goe s to show that the Mantis was not onl y a Luna r type as the leaper round the horizon, but on account of its pow er of transformation; and this again sugge sts the reason why the Mantis shoul d be the zoot ype of the Mys tæ who transformed in trance, as well as leaped and danced in the mysteries. The Frog and the Grasshoppe r were earlier leapers than the Hare. These also were figures of the Moon that leaped up in a fresh place every night . It was this leaping up of the lig ht that was imitated in the dances of the Africans who jum ped for joy at the appe arance of the New Moon which they celebrated in the mont hly dance, as did the Congo Negroes and other denizens of the Dark Cont inent who danced the primitive mysteries and dra matised them in their dances. The Leapers were the Dancers, and the leaping Mantis, the Grasshoppe r, the Frog, the Hare, were amongs t the pre - hum an prototype s. The frog is still know n in popul ar weather - wisdom as the prophe sier of Rain. As such, it must h ave been of vastly more impor tance in the bur ning lands of Inne r Africa, and there is reason to suppos e that Hekat, the Cons ort of Khnum , the King of Frogs , was frog - headed as the prophe tess, or foreteller, on this ground of natural fact. Erman says the “G reat Men of the Sout h,” the “Privy Counc illors of the roya l orders were almost always inve sted – I know not why – with the office of Proph et of the frog - headed Godde ss Hekat.” ( Life in Ancient Egypt, p. 82, Eng. tr.). The Frog was a prophe t of Rain in som e cou ntries, and of spring - time in others. In Egypt it was the prophe t of the Inunda tion, hence Hekat was a Cons ort of Khnum , the Lord of the Inunda tion, and King of Frogs . Hekat was also the Seer by Night in the Moon, as well as the crier for the waters and fo reteller of their com ing. From her, as Seer in the dark, we may derive the names of the Witch as the Hexe, the Hag, the Hagedisse; and also that of the dark Godde ss Hecate, the sende r of Dreams. As prophe sier of Rain, or of the Inunda tion, it was the heral d of new life to the land of Egypt , and this woul d be one reason for its relations hip to the resurrection. But, in making its transformation from the tadpol e state to that of the frog, it was the figure of a still more impor tant natural fact. This, in the Mythology, was appl ied to the transformation and renewal of the Moon, and to the transformation of the Mortal into an Immortal in the Eschatology, a type of Ptah, who in one form is portrayed as the frog - headed God. Lamps have been found in Egyp t with the Frog upon the uppe r part, and one is know n which has the legend egw eimi anastasis , “I am the Resurrection. ” (Lanzone , Dizionar io, p. 853; Budge , The Mum my, p. 266. ) In this figure the lamp is an equi valent for the rising Sun, and the frog upon it is the t ype of Ptah, who in his solar character was the Resurrection and the life in the Mythol ogy before the image passed into the Eschatology, in a Spiritual sense. The frog was a type of transformation, and the Frog - headed Ptah made his transformation in Amenta to rise again as the ope ner of the Nether Earth. And as he represented the Sun in Amenta, the frog, like the Cynoc epha lus of Memphi s ( Rit., ch. 42) , was imaged as Golden. Thus we find the Sun in the low er Earth of two depicted in the Golden Frog, and, as stated by John Bell, the 11 Lamas had an idea that the earth rested on a Golden Frog, and that when the Frog stretched out its foot there was an Earthqua ke. (“A Jour ney from St. Petersbur gh to Pekin in the year 1719. ” Pinke rton’ s Voyage s, v. 7, p. 369.) Here the frog beneath the earth, like"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"the Tortoise, is Egyp tian, and as such we can learn what fact in nature was represented by it as a zoot ype of Ptah in the Nether World called the Earth of Eternity, where the typi cal tadpol e that swam the waters made i ts transformation into the frog that stretched itself out and set foot on land. It is related in a Chinese legend that the lady, Mrs. Chang - ngo, obt ained the drug of Immortality by stealing it from Si Wang Nu, the Roya l Mother of the West. With this she f led to the Moon, and was change d into a Frog that is still to be seen on the surface of the orb. (Dennys , Folk - Lore of China, p. 117. ) As Egypt ian, the Mother of the West was the Godde ss who received the setting Sun and reproduc ed its light . The immortal l iquor is the Solar Light . This was stolen from the Moon. Chang - ngo is equi valent to the frog - headed Hekat who represented the resurrection. The frog, in Egypt , was a sign of “myriads” as well as of transformation. In the Moon it woul d denot e myriads of ren ewals when periodi c repetition was a mode of immortality. Hekat the frog - headed is the original Cinde rella. She makes her transformation into Sati, the Lady of Light , whos e name is written with an Arrow . Thus , to mention onl y a few of the luna r type s, the Godde ss Hekat represented the moon and its transformation as the Frog. Taht and his Cynoc epha lus represented the Man and his dog in the Moon . Osiris represented the Luna r Light in his character of the Hare - headed Un - Nefer, the up - springi ng Hare in the Moon . These are Egypt ian Zootype s, to be read wherever found by means of the Egypt ian Wisdom . Amongs t other Hierogl yphi c Signs in the Langua ge of Animals, the Head of a Vulture signi fies victory (doubt less because of the bird’s keen scent for blood ). The sheat hen claw is a determinative of peaceful actions . The hinde r part of the Lione ss denot es the great magical pow er. The Tail of a Crocodi le is a sign for black and for darkne ss. An Ape is the ideogr aph of rage and a fiery spirit, or spirit of fire. The sparro w is a type of phys ical evil because of its destructive nature in thieving corn — its name of “Tu - tu” signi fies a kind of plague or affliction of the fields. (Birch.) The Water - wagtail is a type of moral evil. This bird, as Wilkinson poi nted out, is still ca lled in Egypt the father of corrupt ion (aboo fussad). It was regarded as the type of an impur e or wicked person, on account of its insidious sugge stiveness of immoral motion. The extent to which morals and phi losophy were taught by means of these living ob ject - pictures cannot now be measured, but the moralising fables spoke n as well as acted by the typical animals still offer testimony , and langua ge is full of phr ases which cont inue the zoot ype s into the world of letters, as when the greedy, filthy man is c alled a hog, the grum py man a bear, the cunni ng one a fox, the subt le and treacherous one a snake. In the Folk - Lore of various races the hum an Soul takes the form of a Snake, a Mous e, a Swallow , a Hawk, a Pigeon, a Bee, a Jackal, or other animal, each of which was an Egypt ian zoot ype of som e 12 pow er or soul in Nature before there was any representation of the hum an Soul or Ancestral Spirit in the human form. Hence we are told that when twins are bor n the Batavians believe that one of the pair is a croco dile. Mr. Spenser accepts the “belief” and asks, “May we not conc lude that twins, of whom one gained the name of crocodi le, gave rise to a legend which originated this mons trous belief?” ( Data of Soc iology , ch. 22, par. 175. ) But all such representations a re mythical and are not to be expl icated by the theory"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"of “mons trous belief.” It is a matter of Sign - Langu age. The Batavians kne w as well as we do that no crocodi le was ever born twin along with a hum an child. In this instance the poor things were assertin g in their primitive way that Man is bor n with or as a Soul . This the gnos is enables us to prove . One of the earliest type s of the Sun as a Soul of life in the water is a Crocodi le. We see the Mother who brings forth a Crocodi le when the Godde ss Neith is p ortrayed in hum an shape as the suckler of the young crocodi les hangi ng at her breasts. Neith is the wet - nurse personi fied whos e child was the young sun - god . As Sebek he was imaged by the Crocodi le that emerged from the waters at sun - rise. Sebek was at onc e the child and the crocodi le brought forth by the Great Mother in the mythology. And because the Crocodi le had imaged a Soul of Life in water, as a supe rhum an pow er, it became a representative, in Sign - Langua ge, of the hum an Soul . We see this same type of a Soul in external nature appl ied to the hum an Soul in the Book of the Dead, when the Osiris in the Nether World exclaims, “I am the Crocodi le in the form of a man,” that is as a Soul of which the Crocodi le had been a sym bol , as Soul of the Sun. It was thu s the Crocodi le was bor n with the Child, as a matter of sign - langua ge, not as a belief. The crocodi le is com monl y recogni sed by the Congo natives as a type of Soul . Miss Kings ley tells of a Witch - Doctor who adm inistered emetics to certain of his patients a nd brought away young crocodi les. She relates that a Witch - Doctor had been ope ned after death, when a winge d Lizard - like thing was found in his inside which Batanga said was his pow er. The pow er being anot her name for his Soul . Mr. Spenser not onl y argue s for the actuality of these “beliefs” conc erning natural facts, suppos ed to have been held by primitive men and scientific Egypt ians, which vanish with a true interpretation of the mythical mode of representation, he further insists that there seems to be “am ple justification for the belief that any kind of Creature may be trans formed into any other” because of the metamorphos is obs erved in the insect - world, or elsewhere, from which there resulted “the theory of metam orphos is in general” and the not ion “tha t things of all kinds may sudde nly change their forms,” man of cour se include d. ( Data, ch. 8, par. 55.) But there was no evidence throughout all nature to sugge st that any kind of creature coul d be transformed into any other kind. On the cont rary, nature s how ed them that the frog was a tadpol e cont inue d; that the chrysalis was the prior status of the butterfly, and that the old Moon change d into the New. The transformation was visible and inva riable, and the produc t of transformation was always the same in kind. There was no sign or sugge stion of an unl imited pos sibility in metamorphos is. Neither was there ever a race of savages who did think or believe (in the words of Mr. Spenser) 13 “that any kind of creature may be trans formed into any other,” no more than there ever were boys who believed that any kind of bird coul d lay any other kind of bird’s egg. They are too good obs ervers for any such self - delusion as that. Mythical representation did not begin with “stories of hum an adve nture,” as Mr. Spencer pu ts it, nor with hum an figures at all, but with the phe nom ena of external nature, that were represented by means of animals, birds, reptiles and insects, which had demons trated the pos session of supe rhum an faculties and pow ers. The origin of various supe rst itions and custom s seemingl y insane can be traced to sign - langua ge. In many parts"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"of Engl and it is thought necessary to “tell the Bees” when a death has occurred in the hous e, and to put the hives into mourning. The present writer has know n the hous ewife t o sally forth into the garden with warming - pan and key and strips of crape to “tell the Bees,” lest they shoul d take flight , when one of the inm ates of the hous e had died. We must seek an expl anation for this in the sym bol ism of Egypt that was carried fort h orally to the ends of the earth. The Bee was anciently a zoot ype of the Soul which was represented as issuing forth from the body in that form or unde r that type . There is a tradition that the Bees alone of all animals descende d from Paradise. In the Eng adine, Switzerland, it is said that the Soul s of men go forth from this world and return to it in the form of Bees. Virgil, in the Four th Book of the Georgics, celebrates the Bee that never dies, but ascends alive into heaven. That is the typi cal Bee which was an image of the Soul . It was the Soul , as Bee, that alone ascende d into heaven or descende d from thence. The Bee is certainly one form of the Egypt ian Abait, or Bird - fly, which is a gui de and pilot to the Soul s of the Dead on their way to the fields o f Aarru. It was a figur e of Low er Egypt as the land of hone y, thence a fitting gui de to the celestial fields of the Aarru - Paradise. It looks as if the name for the Soul , Ba, in Egypt ian, may be identical with our word Bee. Ba is hone y determined by the Bee - sign, and Ba is also the Soul . The Egypt ians made use of hone y as a means of embalming the dead. Thus the Bee, as a zoot ype of the Soul , became a messenge r of the dead and a mode of com muni cation with the ancestral Spirits. Talking to the Bees in this lan gua ge was like speaking with the Spirits of the dead, and, as it were, com mendi ng the departed one to the gui dance of the Bees, who as hone y - gatherers naturally kne w the way to the Elysian fields and the meads of Amaranth that flow ed with milk and hone y. T he type is conf used with the Soul when the Bee is invoke d as follow s, “almost as if reque sting the Soul of the departed to watch for ever ove r the living” : — “Bienchen, unser Herr ist todt, Verlass mich nicht in meiner No th.” (Gube rnatis, Zool og ical Mythy., v. 2, p. 218.) In the Ritual the Abait (as Bee or Bird - fly) is the conduc tor of Soul s to the celestial fields. When the Deceased is asked who conduc ted him thither, he replies, “It was the Abait - deity who conduc ted me.” He also exclaims, “Hail to thee, who fliest up to heaven to give light to the stars.” (Ch. 76. Renouf .) Here the Bee or Bird - fly is a Solar type , and that which represented the ascendi ng sun in the mythol ogy 14 became a type of the Soul in the eschatology. Thus the inventor of hone y in this world led the way to the fields of flow ers in the next. Mode rn popul ar supe rstition to a large extent is the ancient sym bol ism in its second childhood. Here is a case in poi nt. The Cock having been a representative of Soul or Spirit, it is sure to be said that the hum an Soul has entered the Cock by a kind of reincarnation. Hence we read of a legacy left to a Fow l by a wealthy lady named Silva, of Lisbon, who held that the Soul of her dead hus band survived in a Cock. ( Daily Mail, May 26t h, 18 92.) So it has been with the zoot ype s of other elemental soul s that were cont inue d"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"for the hum an soul , from the Crocodi le of the Batavians to the red Mous e of the Germans. Folk - lore is full of fables that originated in this langua ge of signs . The Jackal i n the Egypt ian representation is the guide of the Sun upon his pathw ay in Amenta, who takes up the young child - Horus in his arms to carry him ove r the waters. In the Hottentot prototype the Jackal finds the Sun in the form of a little child, and takes him upon his back to carry him. When the Sun grew hot the Jackal shook himself and said, “Get dow n.” But the Sun stuck fast and bur nt the Jackal, so that he has a long black stripe dow n his back to this day. (Bleek, Reynar d, p. 67. ) The same tale is told of th e Coyot e or Prairie - dog , who takes the place of the Jackal in the mythical legends of the Red Men. In the Ritual the Jackal who carried Horus, the young Sun - God, had becom e the bearer and suppor ter of Souls. In passing the place where the Dead fall into da rkne ss, the Osiris says, “Apua t raiseth me up.” (Ch. 44. ) And when the ove rwhelming waters of the Deluge burst forth, he rejoices, saying, “Anup is my bearer.” (Rit., ch. 64. ) Here, as elsewhere, the mythical type extant with the earlier Africans had passe d into the eschatology of the Egypt ians. The eternal cont est betwixt the pow ers of light and darkne ss is also represented in the African folk - tales. The Hare (or Rabbi t) Kalulu and the Dzimwi are two of the cont endi ng characters. The Hare, as in Egyp t, is typical of the Good Pow er, and no doubt is a zoot ype of the young up - springi ng Moon. The Dzimwi is the Evil Pow er, like Apap, the Giant, the Ogre, the Swallow er of the waters or the light . (Werner, “African Folk - Lore,” Cont emp. Rev., September, 1896. ) It is very cunni ng, but in the end is always out witted by the Hare. When the Dzimwi kills or swallow s the Hare’s Mother it is the Dragon of Darkne ss, or Eclipse, devour ing the Lunar light . The Moon - mythos is inde finitely older than the Solar, and the earliest slayer of the Dragon was Luna r, the Mother of the Young Child of Light . Here she is killed by the Dzimwi. Then Kalulu com es with a barbed arrow , with which he pierces the Dzimwi through the heart. This is the battle of Ra and Apap, or Horus and Sut, in th e most primitive form, when as yet the pow ers were rende red non - anthropom orphi cally. Again, the Monke y who is transformed into a man is a prototype of the Moon - God Taht, who is a Dog - headed Ape in one character and a man in anot her. A young person refuses several hus bands . A Monke y then com es along. The beast takes the skin off his body, and is change d into a Man. To judge 15 from the Egypt ian Mythos , the young person was Luna r, and the Monke y changi ng into a man is Luna r likewise. One of the two won the Lady of Light in the Moon. This was the Monke y that became a Man, as did the Bear in “Beauty and the Beast.” In anot her tale, obvi ous ly Luni - Solar, that is with the Sun and Moon as the characters, a girl (that is the Moon) refused a hus band (that is the Su n). Thereupon she married a Lion; that is a Solar type . In other words, the Moon and Sun were married in Amenta. This tale is told with primitive hum our. When the wedde d pair were going to bed she woul d not und ress unl ess he let her cut off his tail. For t his remained unmetamorphos ed when he transformed into a Man. “When she found out that he was a lion she ran away from that hus band. ” So in a Hindu story a young wom an refuses to marry the Sun because he is too fiery - hot . Even in the American Negro stories of Brer Rabbi t, Brer Fox, Brer Wolf, and Brer Terrapin the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"original characters of the typi cal animals are still preserved as they were in the Egypt ian mythol ogy when divinised. The Turtle or Tortoise, the wise and sagacious one , is the hider; the Fox, like the Jackal, Anup, is the cunni ng one . The Wolf is the swallow er, and the Rabbi t equa tes with the Hare, a type of the Good Osiris or of the African Kalulu. Any num ber of current supe rstitions are the result of ignor ance conc erning the Ancient Wisdom , and one of the worst results beque athed to us by the past is to be found in our custom s of cruelty to dum b animals. These poor victims have had to suffer fright fully for the very service which they onc e rendered to man as primitive type s of expr ession in Sign - Langua ge. In the Persian and Hebrew laws of Clean and Unclean, many of the animals and birds that were onc e held sacred in Egypt for their sym bol ic value are there conde mned as unc lean, to be cast out with curses; and so the real animals became the out cast s of the mental world, according to the later religion, in the langua ge of letters which follow ed and supe rseded the carven hierogl yphi cs of the earlier time. The Ass has been a shameful sufferer from the part it played in the primitive typol ogy. Beating a nd kicking the ass used to be a Christian spor t practised up and dow n the aisles of Christian chur ches, the ass being a cast - out representative of an old Hebrew, and still older Egypt ian deity. The Cat is anot her sufferer for the same reason. The cat sees by night , and was adopt ed as a type of the Moon that saw by night and kept watch in the dark. Now , witches are seers and foreseers, and whenever they were persecuted and hounde d to death the cat suffered with them, because she had been the type and sym bol of preterhum an sight . These were mode s of casting out the ancient fetish - images initiated and enforced by the priesthood of a later faith. In Egypt , as Hor - Apol lo tells us, the figure of a mous e signi fied a disappe arance. Now , see how cruelly the little a nimal has been treated because it was a type of disappe arance. It was, and may be still, an Engl ish custom to charm away disease by making a hol e in the shrew - ash or witch - elm tree and shut ting up a live shrew - mous e in it. In immuring the mous e in the bole of the tree, the disappe aring victim typi fied or 16 enacted the desired disappe arance of the disease. That which had been a sym bol in the past is now made use of alive in performing a sym bol ical action in the present. Much misery has been caused to hum an beings as well as animals through the misappl ication of certain mythical, that is sym bol ical characters. Plutarch tells us how the evil Sut (or Typhon) was hum iliated and insulted by the Egyp tians at certain festivals, “when they abus e red - haired men an d tum ble an ass dow n a precipice because Typhon was red - haired and like an ass in com plexion.” (Ch. 30.) The fact is also not orious in Europe that an evil character has been com monl y ascribed to red - haired persons , with no know n warrant whatever from natur e. They suffer for the sym bol . Now for the origin of the sym bol , according to the Egypt ian Wisdom . Sut, the treacherous oppone nt of Horus (Osiris in the later Mythos ), was the Egypt ian Juda s. He betrayed his brother to his enemies the Sebau. He was of a re d com plexion. Hence the Red Ass and the red - haired peopl e were his type s. But the com plexion and red hai r of Sut were not derived from any hum an origin. Sut was painted red, yellow ish, or sandy, as representative of the desert. He was the original devil in the wilderness, the cause of drought and the creator of thirst."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"As the Hippopot amus, Sut, like Apt the Mother, was of a red com plexion. As the betrayer of his brother Osiris, Sut was brought on with the Jesus - legend in the character of Juda s, the traitor; hence in the Miracle - plays and out - of - door s custom s, Juda s, true to the Sut - Typhoni an tradition, is always red - haired or wears a red wig. Thus , in our pictures of the past the typi cal traitor still preserves his prope r hue, but in the belief of the ignor a nt the clue is lost and the red - haired peopl e com e to be the Viva Effigies of Sut, the Egypt ian Juda s, as a hum an type of evil. Folk - lore in many lands is the final fragm entary form in which the ancient wisdom – the Wisdom of old Egypt – still survives as old wives’ fables, parables, riddl es, allegor ical sayings , and supe rstitious beliefs, cons ecrated by the igno rance which has taken the place of primitive know ledge conc erning the mythical mode of representation; and from lack of the lost key, the writers on t his subject have becom e the sheerest tale - bearers whos e gos sip is full of scanda l against primitive and ancient man. But not in any land or langua ge can the Märchen tell us anyt hing directly conc erning themselves. They have lost the memory of their meaning . It is only in the Mythos that we can ascertain their original relations hip to natural fact and learn that the peopl e who repeat the folk - tales were not always natural fool s. It is only in the Egypt ian Wisdom that the key is to be found. One of the most uni versal of the Folk - Tales which are the débris of Mythol ogy is that of the Giant who had no heart (or spark of soul) in his body. The Apap - Dragon, in Africa, was the first of all the Giants who has no heart in his body , no root in reality, being as he is onl y the representation of non - existence, drought , darkne ss, death and negation. To have no heart in the body is an Egypt ian expr ession for lack of unde rstandi ng and want of nous . As it is said in the Anastasi Papyr i of the Slave who is driven with a stic k and beaten like the Ass, “He has inde ed no heart in his body .” It was this 17 lack of Intelligence that made the Giant of the Märchen such a big blunde ring booby, readily out - witted by clever little Jack, Horus or Petit Yorge, the yout hful Solar God; a nd so easily cajoled by the fair princess or Luna r lady who is held a captive in his dunge on unde rground. In one of the Tartaro - Legends told in Basque the Hero fight s “a body without a soul .” When the mons ter is com ing it is said of him “he is about to com e, this hor rible body without a soul .” In anot her tale the seven - headed serpent, Heren - Suge , bemoans his fate that he hasn’t “a spark betwixt his head and tail”; if he had he woul d bur n up Petit Yorge, his lady, his hor se, and his terrible dog. In this ver sion the Mons ter is a serpent, equi valent to the Apap - Reptile or Dragon of drought and darkne ss, which in the Kamite Mythos has no soul in its body, because it is an image of darkne ss and negation. Most of the characters and localities, the scenery and im agery of these Märchen belong to the Egypt ian Mythos . The Lake is also African, as the typi cal great water of thos e who had never seen the Ocean. It remained the same type with the Egypt ians after they did know the Great Green Water of the Mediterranean Se a. In such ways they have preserved their proofs of the Inne r African beginni ngs with an adamantine unc hange ableness. The lake of the Goos e or Duck is referred to in the Ritual. (Ch. 109. )"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Sun was imaged as a Golden Egg laid by the Duck or Goos e. The h ill or island standi ng in the lake is the Earth cons idered as a Mount of the Doubl e Earth in the Kamite Eschatology. The Snake or Dragon in the Lake, or coiling about the Mount or round the Tree, is the Apap - Reptile in the Water of Darkne ss who coils about the Hill at Suns et (Rit., ch. 108) or attacks the Tree of Life which is an image of the Dawn, the Great Green Sycamore of Hathor. Earth itself was imaged as a Goos e that rested on the Nun or the Waters of Space. This was the ancient Mother Goose that ever y morning laid her Golden Egg. The Sun sinki ng dow n into the unde rworld is described in the Ritual as “the Egg of the Great Cackler:” “The Egg which Seb hath parted from the earth.” (Rit., ch. 54. ) The Giant with no heart or Soul is a figur e of Darkne ss as the devour ing Mons ter with no Sun (or Soul) in his body . Hence the heart or Soul that was hidde n in the Tree, or in the Egg of the Bird far away. The Sun is the Egg that was laid by the Goos e of Earth that brought forth the Golden Egg. This Soul of the Gi ant, Darkness, was not the persona l soul of any hum an being whatsoever, and the onl y link of relations hip is when the same image of a Soul in the Egg is appl ied to the Manes in the dark of death. The Soul of the Sun in the Egg is the Soul of Ra in the unde rworld of Amenta; and when the Sun issues from the Egg (as a Hawk) it is the death of Darkne ss the Monster. Our forbears and forerunne rs were not so far beside themselves as to believe that if they had a Soul at all, it was out side of their ow n bodi es hid den som ewhere in a tree, in a bird, in an egg, in a hare, in a duc k, a crocodi le, or any other zoot ype that never was suppos ed to be the dw elling of the hum an Soul . In the Basque story of Marlbrook the Mons ter is slain by being struck on the forehead with an egg that was found in a Pigeon, that was found in a Fox, that was 18 found in a terrible Wolf in a forest. (Webster, p. 83.) How ever represented, it was the Sun that caused the Mons ter’s death. So in the Norse Tales the Troll or Ogre bursts at sight o f dawn, because his death was in the Solar orb that is represented by the Kamite Egg of the Goos e. The Giant of darkne ss is inseparable from the young hero or the solar God who rises from Amenta as his valiant conque ror. These being the two irreconc ilable enemies, as they are in the Ritual, it follow s that the Princess who finally succeeds in obt aining the Giant’s secret conc erning the hiding - place of his heart in the egg of a bird is the Luna r Lady in Amenta who, as Hathor , was the Princess by name when sh e had becom e the daught er of Ra. She outwits the Apap, who is her swallow er at the time of the eclipse, and conve ys the secret know ledge to the yout hful solar hero who ove rcom es the Giant by crushing his heart in the egg. In fight ing with the Mons ter, the Basque Hero is endow ed with the faculty of transforming into a Hawk! The Hawk says to him, “When you wish to make your self a Hawk, you will say, ‘Jesus Hawk,’ and you will be a Hawk.” The hawk of Jesus takes the place of the Horus - hawk, just as the name of Malbor o is subs tituted for that of the Hero who is elsewhere Petit Yorge=Little Horus. (Webster, Basque Legends , pp. 80 - 83.) Horus, like the Hero of these tales, is hum an on earth, and he transforms into the Hawk when he goe s to fight the Apap - Mons ter in Amenta. In the Basque version the hum an hero transforms into a hawk, or, as it is said, “the young Man made himself a hawk,” just as the hum an Horus change d into the Golden Hawk: and then flew away with the Princess clingi ng firmly to his neck. And here th e Soul that was in the egg is"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"identified as the Hawk itself. At least it is when the egg is broke n with the blow struck by the Princess on the Giant’s forehead that the Hero makes his transformation into the Hawk. In the mythol ogy it was the bird of earth that laid the egg, but in the eschatology when the egg is hatched it is the Bird of Heaven that rises from it as the Golden Hawk. The Hawk of the Sun is especially the Egypt ian Bird of Soul , although the Dove or pigeon also was a type of the Soul that was derived from Hathor . In the Märchen the Duck takes the place of the Goos e. But these are co - type s in the Mythos . In the Egypt ian, Horus pierces the Apap - Dragon in the eye and pins his head to the earth with a lance. The mythical mode of representation wen t on developi ng in Egypt , keeping touc h with the adva ncing arts. The weapon of the Basque Hero was earlier than the lance or spear of Horus; it is a stake of wood made red - hot . With this he pierces the huge mons ter in the eye and burns him blind. The Greek version of this is too well know n to call for repetition here, and the Basque lies nearer to the original Egypt ian. It is more impor tant to identify the eye and the blazing snake. Horus, the young solar God, is slayer of the Apap by piercing him in the ey e. The Apap is the Giant, the Dragon, the serpent of darkne ss, and the eye of Apap was thought of as the eye of a serpent that was huge enough to coil round the mount ain of the world, or about the Tree of life and light which had its root age in the nether earth. This, on the hor izon, was the Tree of dawn. The stake is a reduc ed form of the tree that was figur ed in the green of dawn. The typical tree was a weapon of the 19 ancient Horus who is described as fight ing Sut with a branch of palm, which also is a reduc ed form of the tree. The tree of dawn upon the hor izon was the weapon of the solar god with which he pierced the dragon of darkne ss and freed the mount ain of earth and the Princess in Amenta from its throttling, crushing, reptilinear coils. This tre e, conve ntiona lised in the stake made red - hot in the furnace, formed the primitive weapon with which Horus or Ulysses or the Tartaro put out the Mons ter’s eye, and pierced the serpent’s head to let forth the waters of light onc e more and to free the lady f rom her prison in the low er world. When the Apap - Mons ter in the cave of darkne ss was personi fied in som ething like the hum an shape, the Giant as reptile in the earliest representation passed into the Giant as a Mons ter in the form of a magni fied man called the Cyclops and named Polyphe mus. In one of the African Folk - tales the little Hero Kalulu slays the mons ter by thrusting a huge red - hot boul der dow n the devour er’s throat. This is a type of the red - hot solar orb which the Power of darkne ss tried to swallo w, and thus put out the light . The luna r lady, as well as the solar hero, is the dragon - slayer in the Basque legends . In one of these the loathly reptile lies sleeping with his head in the lap of the beautiful lady. The hero descends to her assistance in the Unde rworld. She tells him to “be off.” “The Mons ter” has onl y three - qua rters of an hour to sleep, she says, “and if he wakes it is all ove r with you and me.” It is the Lunar Lady who worms the great secret out of the Mons ter conc erning his death, when he conf esses where his heart lies hidde n. “At last, at last,” he tells her, “you must kill a terrible wolf which is in the forest, and inside of him is a fox, and in the fox is a pigeon; this pigeon has an egg in its head, and whoe ver shoul d strike me on t he forehead with this egg woul d kill me.” The Hero, having"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"becom e a hawk, secures the egg and brings it to the “young lady, ” and having done his part hands ove r the egg and says to her, “At present it is your turn; act alone .” Thus it appe ars that the egg made use of by the Prince to kill the Giant is the Sun, and that made use of by the Princess was the Luna r orb. Here we have “the egg of the sun and the moon” which Ptah is said to have move d in the Beginni ng. “She strikes the Mons ter as he had told her, a nd he falls stark dead.” (Webster, “Malbrouk. ”) The Dragon was know n in Britain as the typi cal cause of drought and the devour er of nine maidens who had gone to fetch water from the spring before he was slain by Martin. These are representative of nine New Moons renewed at the sour ce of light in the Nether World. Dr. Plott, in his History of Cambridge shire (p. 349) , mentions the custom at Burford of making a dragon annua lly and “carrying it up and dow n the tow n in great jollity, on Midsum mer Eve,” to which he says, not know ing for what reason, “they adde d a Giant.” (Brand, “Midsum mer Eve.”) Both the Dragon and Giant signi fied the same Mons ter that swallow ed the water and devour ed the givers of light , luna r or solar, the dragon being a zoom orphi c type and the Giant huge ly anthropom orphi c. Instead of saying nine Moons passed into the dark, as a mode of reckoni ng the mont hs, it might be said, and was said, that Nine Maidens were devour ed by the Dragon of darkne ss. The Myth originated when Darkne ss was the devour ing Giant and the weapon of the warrior was a stone that imaged the Solar orb. In the 20 cont est of the young and ruddy hero David with the Giant Goliath the Hebrew Version of the Folk - tale still retains the primitive feature of the stone . We know the u niversal Mother as the Evil reptile of the Dark, for ever warring with the Light , that also drinks the water which is the life of vegetation, as the fiery Dragon of Drought . But there is a very primitive version extant amongs t the Australian abor igines, th e Anda man Islande rs, and the red men, in which a gigantic Frog drinks up all the waters in the world. Here the Frog plays the part of the Apap - mons ter that swallow s the waters at sundow n and is pierced and cut in pieces coil by coil to set them flow ing fre ely at the return of day, either by the Hawk of Ra or the Cat or by Horus, the anthropom orphi c hero. In the Anda man version of the conf lict between the bird of Light and the Devil of Darkne ss the waters are drunk up and withhe ld by a big Toad. An Iroquoi s or Huron form of this mythical representation also show s the devour ing mons ter as a gigantic Frog that drank up all the water of the world. The Abor igines of Lake Tyers likewise relate that onc e on a time there was no water anyw here on the surface of the w hol e earth. This had all been drunk up and was conc ealed in the body of a mons trous Frog. The Dragon of the waters is also a denizen of the Holy well in Britain; and here again the evil pow er of drought and darkne ss is represented by the Devil in the form of a Frog as presiding spirit of the water. In the well on the Devil’s Causeway between Ruckley and Acton there is suppos ed to be a huge Frog which represents the devil, that is, the hos tile pow er of drough t. The prope r time for the malevol ent Frog to be s een woul d be when the Well was dried up in times of great drought , hence he is but seldom seen in a rainy climate like our s. (Burne, Shr ops hire Folklore, p. 428. ) The Frog still suffers even in this “enlight ened land” of our s for suppl ying a zoot ype of the Evil Pow er. It is yet a provi ncial spor t for count ry louts to “hike the Toad,” that is by jerking it high in the air"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"from the end of a plank as a mode of appe aling to Heaven for rain and the kind of weather wanted. Even so, poo r Froggy has to walk the pla nk and suffer in the present for having been a representative in the past of the Monster that drank up all the water. The Orinoc o Indi ans used to keep Toads in vessels, not to worship them, but to have them at hand as representatives of the Pow er that dran k up the Water or kept back the rain; and in time of drought the Toads were beaten to procure the much - desired rain. (Bastian.) In various count ries the Mons ter of the Dark was represented by an animal entirely black. This in Egypt was the black Boar of S ut. And what these custom s signi fied according to the Wisdom of Egypt they mean elsewhere. When the Timorese are direfully suffering from lack of rain, they offer up a black Pig as a sacrifice. The Black Pig was slain just as Apap was pierced because it im aged the dark pow er that onc e withhe ld the waters of day and now denies the rain, or the Water of Life. In Sumatra it is the Black Cat that typi fies the inimical Pow er which withho lds the rain. Wom en go naked or nearly so to the river, and wade in it as a primitive mode of sacrifice or solicitation. Then a black Cat is throw n into the Water and forced to swim for its life, like the Witch in the Europe an custom . 21 The Black Goat, the Black Pig, and the Black Cat are all Typhon ian type s of the same sym bol i c value as the Black Boar of Sut or the Apap - Dragon. In each case the representative of the dark and evil Pow er was slain or throw n into the water as a propi tiation to the beneficent Pow er that gave the rain. Slaying the type of Drought was a means of figh ting against the Pow er of evil and making an appe al to the Good Spirit. It was a primitive mode of Casting out Satan, the Adversary, in practical Sign - Langua ge. The giant or ogre of mythol ogy was a result of humanising the animal type s. At first the Apap - reptile rose up vast, gigantic, as the swallow ing darkne ss or devour ing dragon. This, when hum anised, became the giant, the magni fied non - natural ogre of a man that takes the mons ter’s place in later legenda ry lore. The Apap - dragon coiled about the mount w as the keeper of the treasures in the nether - world. So is it with the giant. In “Jack the Giant - killer” it is said “the mount of Cornw all was kept by a huge giant named Cormoran.” Jack, our little solar hero, asked what reward woul d be given to the man who killed Cormoran. “The giant’s treasure,” they told him, woul d be the reward. Quot h Jack, “Then let me unde rtake it.” After he had slain the giant, Jack went to search the cave, which answers to the Amenta in the low er earth, in which the treasure was conc ealed. This was the treasure of light and water that had been hidde n by the giant in his lair. The Aryan fairy - tales and folk - tales can be unr iddl ed in the Kamite Mythos which was based on the phe nom ena of external nature. It is the Moon, for instance, wh o was a wom an one half the time and a frog or serpent during the other half. In the first character she was Sati, the lady of light . In the second half of the luna tion she was the frog that swam the waters of the nether earth and made her transformation as Hekat in Amenta. Som e writers have denounc ed the savage brutality and obs cenity of thos e whom they look upon as the makers of mythol ogy. But in all this they have been spitting beside the mark. Moreove r, the most repul sive aspects do not belong to mythol o gy prope r, but are mainly ow ing to the decadence and degradation of the matter in the Märchen. Also to the change which the Mythos suffered in passing from the zoom orphi c mode of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"representation. There is neither morality nor immorality so long as the phe no mena are non - hum an and the drama is performed by the primitive actors. But when the characters are hum anised or divinised in hum an form the re - cast may be fatal to the mythical meaning; primitive simplicity is appa rently conve rted into senseless absurdity, and the drama of the nature - pow ers turned into a masque rade of mons ters. Plutarch will furnish us with an illustration which these idiotai might have selected for an example. When speaking of the elder Horus who “came into the world before his time” as th e pha ntom - forerunne r of the true light , he says that Osiris had accom panied with Isis (his spous e) after her decease. Which looks very om inous for the morals of the “myth - makers” who coul d ascribe such immorality to their Gods . Is it not a fair deduc tion f rom a dat um like that to infer that the Egypt ians were accustom ed to coha bit with the corpses of their dead wom en? Obvi ous ly that is one of the pos sible implications . Especially as Osiris, according to Spencer, was onc e a man! 22 But now for an expl anati on on the plain ground of natural fact. Isis, in one character, was the Mother - Moon, the reproduc er of the light in Amenta; the place of conj unc tion and of re - begettal by the Sun - god , when Osiris entered the Moon, and she became the Wom an who was clothed w ith the Sun. At the end of a luna tion the old Moon died and became a corpse – it is at times por trayed as a mum my – in the unde rworld, and there it was revivified by Osiris, the solar fecunda tor of the Moon who was the Mother that brought forth the child of li ght , the “Crippl e - deity” that was naturally enough begot ten in the dark. (Plutarch.) But worse still. When Osiris lay helpless and breathless in Amenta with a “Corpse - like face” (Rit., ch. LXXIV) his two wives who are likewise his daught ers came to coha bit with him, and raise him from the dead, or re - erect him like, and as, the Tat. It is said of Isis she “raised the remains of the God of the resting heart and extracted his seed to beget an heir,” or to make him human by reincarnation in the flesh. ( Hymn to Osiris, Records, line 16, p. 102, vol . IV, first series; vol . IV, p. 21, second series.) In this pha se it is the female who coha bits with the Corpse of the dead Male. But in neither were the actors of the drama human, although they are hum anised in the Mä rchen. The Mythos is repeated and appl ied in a Semitic Folk - Tale when Lot’s two Daught ers are “with Child by their Father.” (Gen. XIX. 36. ) The difference being that Osiris as Father in the Mysteries of Amenta was dead at the time, whereas in the irrespons ible Märchen Lot is represented as dead - drunk. The Myths are not to be expl ained by means of the Märchen; not if you collect and com pare the Nursery - Tales of all the world. But we can expl ain the Märchen more or less by aid of the Myths, or rather the myt hical representations in which we can onc e more recove r the lost key. The Aryan Folk - Tales, for example, are by no means a faithful reflection of the world as it appe ared to the primitive mind. They are not a direct reflection of anyt hing; they are refract ed mythology, and the representation in mythol ogy is not direct, not literal, but mystical. Egypt ian mythol ogy, and all it signi fies, lies between the Aryan or other folk - tales and Primitive Man. The Märchen are not the oldest or most primitive form of the Myth; they are the latest. The coinage is the same, but the primitive impress is greatly worn dow n, and the features are often well - nigh effaced. In the Märchen, the Ancient Wise Wom an or old Mother goe s on telling her tales, but the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"memory of their meani ng has lapsed by reason of her age. Whereas in the Ritual the representation is still preserved and repeated accurately according to know ledge . The Mythos passes into the Folk - Tale, not the Folk - Tale into the Mythos . In Egypt ian Sign - Langua ge, the earlies t langua ge of Mythol ogy, the Sun was represented, in the fulness of its pow er, by the Lion. When it went dow n to the Unde rworld by night or in the winter time it was imaged as the disappe aring Mous e. Ra was the Lion: Horus was the Mous e: the blind Shrew - Mo use being a type of Horus darkling in Amenta. Ra as the Solar Lion lost his pow er in the Unde rworld and was as the animal in the hunt er’s toils. Then Horus the Little Hero as the Shrew - Mous e came to deliver the entangl ed Lion. Unde r the type of the Mongoos e or Ichne um on 23 the little hero attacked the serpent of Darkne ss: and, as the Mous e, it was the deliverer of the Lion in the Mythos . But when or where the wisdom was no longe r taught in the mysteries the Gnos is naturally lapsed. The Myth became a Folk - Tale or a legend of the nur sery, and passed into the fable of the mous e that nibbl ed the cord in two which bound the captured Lion and set the might y beast at liberty. Thus the Mythos passed into the Märchen, and the Mysteries still clung on for very life in the Moralities. The Ass in a male form is a type of Tum the Sun - God in Amenta. A vigne tte to the Ritual show s the Ass being devour ed by the serpent of darkne ss called the eater of the Ass. (Ch. 40.) The Ass then in the Egypt ian Mythos represents the Su n - God Tum , Greek Tom os, passing through the nether - world by night . It is Tum in his character of Aiu or Iu who is also represented on the tom b of Rameses the Sixth as a god with the ears of an Ass, hauling at the rope by which the Sun is drawn up from Amen ta, the low er Egypt of the Mythos . Atum , or Tum , is the Old Man of the setting Sun and Aiu is his Son. Thus the three characters of the Old Man, his Son, and the Ass can be identified with Atum - Aiu= Osiris and Horus; and the noc turnal Sun or the Sun of Wint er with the slow motion which cons titutes the difficulty of getting the Ass forward in the fable. This difficulty of getting the Ass along, whether ridde n by Tum the father or pulled along by his Son, was illustrated in a popul ar pastime, when on the eight h day of the festival of the Corpus Dom ini the peopl e of Empol i suspende d the ass aloft in the air and made it fly perforce in presence of the mocking multitude . Gube rnatis says the Germans of Westpha lia “made the Ass a sym bol of the dul l St. Thom as, and w ere accustom ed to call it by the name of ‘the Ass Thom as,’ the lagga rd boy who came the last to school upon St. Thom as’s Day.” ( Zool ogi cal Mythol ogy , vol. I, p. 362. ) But we find an earlier claimant than this for the “Ass Thom as” in Tum , or Tom os, the Kami te Solar God, who made the passage of Amenta very slow ly with the Ass, or as it was represented, riding on the Ass; and therefore for the Greek Fable of the old Man and his Ass. The birth of a Folk - Tale may be seen in the legend of “The Sleeping Beauty.” When it was know n that the renewing Moon derived her glory from the procreative Sun, their meeting in the Unde rworld became a fertile sour ce of legends that were mothered by the Myth. The Moon - Godde ss is the love ly lady sleeping in Amenta waiting for her d eliverer, the Young Solar God, to com e and wake her with the Love r’s kiss. She was Hathor , called the Princess in her Luna r character; and he was the all - conque ring Horus. It was a legend of the resurrection which at first was Soli - Luna r in the Mythos ;"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"aft erwards a sym bol ic representation of the Soul that was awakened from the Sleep of death by Horus in his rôle of Saviour or Deliverer of the Manes in Amenta. So the Mythos faded in the fairy - tale. It is a cardinal tenet of the present work that the Aryan M ärchen and Europe an folk - lore were derived from the Egypt ian Mythol ogy. This might be illustrated without end. For example, there is a classical tradition or Folk - Tale, repeated by Pliny ( Hist. Nat., 7, 3), which tells of a time when a Mother in Egypt bor e seven children at 24 one birth. Of cour se this legend had no origin in natural history. Such a birth belongs to mythol ogy in which the Mother of seven children at a birth was primarily the bringe r - forth of seven elemental pow ers, who can be traced as su ch, in all their seven characters. The One Great Mother with her seven sons cons tituted a primary Ogdoa d. She survived in a Gnos tic form as Achamoth - Ogdoa s, Mother of the seven Rulers of the heptanom is. “This Mother,” says Irenæ us (B. I, ch. V. 2, 3), “the y call Ogdoa s, Sophi a, Earth, Jerusalem.” Jerusalem is identified by Jeremiah with the ancient Mother who was the bringe r - forth of seven sons as the “Mother of the young men,” “she that hath bor ne Seven,” who now giveth up the Ghos t. (Ch. XV. 8.) This Moth er of seven also appe ars as the Great Harlot in the Book of Revelation who is the Mother of the Seven Kings which were at the same time seven heads of the Solar Dragon, and also seven Cons orts who were bor n children of the Old Great Mother. There were “the Seven Children of the Thigh” in the Astronom ical Mythol ogy . Thus the Ancient Genetrix was the Mother who brought forth Seven Children at a birth, or as a com panions hip, according to the categor y of phe nom ena. Her seven children were the Nature - Pow ers of a ll mythol ogy . They are various ly represented unde r divers type s because the pow ers were rebor n in different phe nom ena. We shall find them groupe d as seven serpents, seven apes, seven jackals, seven crocodi les, hippopot ami, hawks, bul ls or rams, who becom e Seven children of the Mother when the myth is rende red anthropom orphically in the later forms of the Märchen, amongs t which there is a Benga lee folk - tale of a Boy who was suckled by seven Mothers. (Lal Behari Day, Folk - Tales of Bengal . ) And this boy of the Märchen can be identified with child - Horus in the Astronom ical Mythos , as “the Bull of the seven cow s.” The seven cow s were groupe d in the Great Bear as a sevenfold figur e of Motherhood. The cow s were also called the seven Hathor s who presided ove r the bi rth of the child as seven Fates in the Egypt ian theology. And in later legends these are the seven Mothers of one child. When he became a child they were the seven wom en who ministered to him of their subs tance in a very literal manne r. The seven givers of liqui d life to the nur sling were por trayed as wom en in Amenta: the seven Hathor s who were present as Fates, at child - birth; and as cow s in the cons tellation of the Great Bear. The sucklers might be imaged as seven wom en, seven cow s, seven sow s. Thus the R om ans had evidently heard of them as a sevenfold form of Rerit the sow , a co - type with the Cow . The Benga lee Folk - tale show s the Egypt ian Mythos reduc ed to the stage of the Aryan Märchen. The typi cal seven Mothers of the child also survive amongs t the othe r curiosities of Christianity. It is said in the Gospel of the Nativity (ch. VIII) that Mary “the virgin of the Lord” had been brought up with seven other virgins in the Temple. Also there are seven wom en in the Gospels who minister to Jesus of their subs t ance. Again we"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"are able to affiliate the folk - tale with the original Mythos . After which it is of little impor tance to our inqui ry which count ry the Aryan Märchen came from last. The Seven Hathor s or Cow s in the Mythos are also the Seven Fates in attenda nc e at the birth of a Child; and in the Babar Archipelago Seven 25 Wom en, each of them carrying a sword, are present when a child is bor n, who mix the placenta with ashes and put it into a small basket, which they hang up in a particular kind of tree. Thes e likewise are a form of the Seven Hathor s who were present at Child - birth as the Seven Fates in the Mythos . In such ways the Kamite Mythos passed into the Aryan Märchen. The Child who had no father had been mythically represented as the Fertiliser of the mother when in utero, like Ptah, the God in embryo. Hence he was called the Bull of his Mother. But why the Bull? Because this was not the hum an Child. It was Horus as the calf, bor n of the Cow and a pre - human type when the fatherhood was not yet indi vidu alised. The Solar God at Suns et made his entrance into the breeding - place of the nether world, and is said to prepare his ow n generation for rebirth next day, but not in hum an gui se. The bul l of his Mother is show n upo n the hor izon as Horus the calf. But w hen the persons and transactions are presented anthropom orphi cally, in accordance with the hum an terminol ogy the calf which had no Father but was his ow n bul l becom es the child who was bor n without a father. Thus the Mythos passes into the Märchen or legen dary lore, and the child who fecunda ted his own Mother takes a final form as the Boy - love r of Venus , Ishtar, or Hathor , the divine Mother, and the subj ect culminated in literature, as (for example) in Shakespeare’s poe m of “Venus and Adoni s,” which is at r oot mythol ogy fleshed in a hum an form. Again and again the Egypt ian Mythos furnishes a prototype that will suffice to account for a hundr ed Folk - tales. For anot her instance, take the legend of the Child that was predestined to be a King in spite of the Mon ster pur suing the Mother, or lying in wait to devour and destroy the infant from before its birth. Har - Ur, or Horus the Elder, was that Child in the Mythos . The title of Repa will identify the Child bor n to be King as that signi fies the Heir - appa rent, or t he Prince who was predestined to becom e the King. An instructive example of the way in which the Mythos , that we look on as Egyp tian, was dispersed and spread in Folk - Tales ove r the world may be seen in the legend of the com bat betwixt a Father and Son. Th e story has attained to som ewhat of an Epical digni ty in Matthew Arnol d’s poe m of “Sohrab and Rustum .” It is also found in many parts of the world, includi ng New Zealand. Briefly sum marised, the story, in legenda ry lore, is that of the Son who doe s not kno w his ow n Father. In the Maori tale of “Koka ko” the boy is called a Bastard. Also in the tale of Peho the child is a Bastard. This is a phr ase in later language to describe the boy whos e birth was Matriarchal when the Father was unknow n individua lly. But s uch a legend as this, when found in Folk - Lore, doe s not com e straight out of local Sociology or Ethnol ogy in any count ry. We have to reckon with the rende ring of the natural fact in the Astronom ical Mythol ogy of Egypt . In the olden day of inde finite patern ity, when the Father was persona lly unknow n it was likewise unknow n that the child of light bor n and rebor n in the Moon was the Son of the Solar God. This was a Mythical Son who coul d not know his ow n Father. The earliest Son in sociology or mythol ogy did not know his ow n Father."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The elder Horus was the Mother’s child, who was bor n but not begot ten. Now , a child whos e 26 father is unknow n is called a Bastard. Thus Horus was a Bastard bor n, and it was flung at him by Sut that he was a Bastard. Also in Jewi sh legend Jesus is called the Mamzer or Bastard. Thus , the child of the Mother onl y was the Bastard, just as the Mother who was “na wife” came to be called the Harlot. The present writer has no know ledge of a Folk - Tale version of the legend being extant in Egyp tian. This doe s not belong to the kind of literature that was preserved in the sanctity of the coffins and tom bs, as was the Book of the Dead. But the essentials are extant, toge ther with the expl anation in natural fact, in the ancient Luni - Solar - Myth os. Horus the Bastard was the child of light that was bor n of Isis in the Moon, when the Moon was the Mother of the child and the Father - sour ce of light was uni dentified. But soone r or later there was a secret know ledge on the subj ect. For instance, in the story told by Plutarch it is said that Taht the Moon - God cleared the character of the Mother by show ing that Horus was not a Bastard, but that Ra, the Solar God, was his true Father. It is still cont inue d to be told in various Folk - Tales that the wom an wa s no better than a wanton in her wooi ng of the man whom she seeks or solicits as her paramour . This character may be traced in the mythol ogy. It is the Lady of Light in the Moon who pur sues and seduc es the Solar God in the darkne ss of Amenta, and who exul t s that she has seized upon the God Hu and taken pos session of him in the vale of Abydos where she went to lie dow n and sought to be replenished with his light. (Ritual, ch. LXXX) Child - Horus always remains a child, the child of twelve years, who at that ag e transforms into the Adul t and finds his Father. So when he is twelve years of age, the boy Jokul l in an Icelandi c version of the Folk - Tale goe s in search of his Father. They fight and the Son is slain, at least he dies after living for three night s. In o ther versions the fight betwixt Father and Son is cont inue d for three days. This is the lengt h of time for the struggl e of Osiris in death and darkne ss who rises again as Lord of light in the Moon and now is recogni sed as the Father of Horus who was previo usly the Mother’s child that kne w not his Father. Moreove r, in the Märchen it is som etimes the Father who is killed in the com bat, at other times it is the Son. And, in the Mythos , Osiris the Father rises again upon the third day in the Moon, but at other times he rises as Horus the trium pha nt Son. A legend like this of the com bat between Father and Son doe s not originate in history, much less doe s it rise from a hund red different Ethnol ogi cal sour ces, as the folk - lorists woul d have us think. In the Folk - Ta les there are various versions of the same subj ect; the Mythos is one , and in that one ness must the origin be sought for the Märchen. This origin of our Folk - Lore may be found a hund red times over in the “Wisdom ” of old Egypt . The Tale of the Two Brothers furnishes a good example of the Egypt ian Mythos reappe aring in the Folk - Tale. In this there are two brothers named Anup, the elder, and Bata, the younge r. Anup has a wife who falls in love with Bata and solicits him illicitly. “And she spoke to him saying, What strengt h there is in thee, inde ed, I obs erve thy vigou r every day.” Her heart kne w him. She seized upon him and said to him, “Com e, let us lie dow n for a while. Better for thee. . . beautiful clothes.” Like Joseph in the Hebrew version, the yout h "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"27 rejected the adva nces of the lady. He “became like a panther” in his fury at her sugge stion. Like Potipha r’s wife, she charges him with violating and doi ng violence to her. We shall have to return to the story. Let it suffice for the present to say that the “tale of the two brothers” in the Märchen is derived in the cour se of a long descent from the myth of Sut and Horus, the Brothers who were represented later as Anup and Horus, also as the Horus of both Horizons . The elder brother Anup corresponds to Su t, who in one form is Anup; the younge r, Bata, to the Sungod Horus of the East. The name of Bata signi fies the Soul (ba) of life in the earth (ta) as a title of the Sun that rises again. On this account it is said that Bata goe s to “the Mount ain of the Ced ar,” in the flow er of which upon the sum mit lies his heart, or soul , or virile force; the pow er of his resurrection as the Solar God. Hence Bata says to Anup, “Behol d, I am about to becom e a Bull.” And he was raised by Ra to the digni ty of hereditary Princ e as ruler of the whol e land, ove r which he reigne d for thirty years. As myth, such Märchen are interpretable wheresoever they are found. The Solar Pow er on the two horizons or the Sun with a dua l face was represented by Two Brothers who are twins, unde r w hichever name or type , who were earlier than Ra. One is the lesser, darkling and infertile Sun of Night , or of Autum n; the other is the Victor in the Resurrection. These were associated in Amenta with the Moon, the Lady of the luna r light, who is described with them in chapter LXXX of the Ritual as uni ting herself with the two Brother - Gods who were Sut and Horus. She is wedde d to the one but is in love with the other. Whether as Sut or Elder Horus, her Cons ort was her impube scent child; and she uni tes with Hu the Virile Solar God and glories in his fertilising pow er. She conf esses that she has seized upon Hu and taken pos session of him in the vale of Abydos when she sank dow n to rest. Her obj ect being to enge nde r light from his potent Solar sour ce, to illumi nate the night, and ove rthrow the devour ing Mons ter of the dark. This is true mythos which is follow ed afar off by the folk - lore of the Tale. There was no need to moralise, as this was Egypt ian mythol ogy, not Semitic history. When the Aryan phi lologists h ave done their worst with the subj ect and the obs curation has passed away, it will be seen that the Legend of Daphne was a transformation that originated in the Egypt ian Mythos . Ages before the legend coul d have been poe tised in Greece, Daphne was extant a s an Egypt ian Godde ss Tafne or Tefnut by name, who was a figur e of the Green Egyp tian Dawn. (Birch, Dictionar y of Hierogl yphi cs. ) The Green Tree was also a type of the Dawn in Egypt . The transformation of the Godde ss into the Tree is a bit of Greek fancy - w ork which was subs tituted for the Kamite Gnos is of the Myth. Max Müller asked how the “total change of a hum an being or a heroine into a Tree” is to be expl ained. Whereas Daphne never was a hum an being any more than Hathor , in her Green Sycamore, or Tefnut in the Emerald Sky of the Egyp tian Dawn. The root s of these things lie far beyond the Anthropom orphi c representation, and in a region where the plum met of the Aryanists has never sounde d. As the Egypt ians appr ehende d, the foremost characteristic of the Da wn was its dewy moisture and 28 "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"refreshing cool ness, not its cons um ing fire. The tree of dewy cool ness, the Sycamore of Hathor , or of Tefnut, was the evergreen of Dawn, and the evergreen as fuel may be full of fire, like the Ash or the Laurel into which Apol lo turned the young divinity who was Daphne in Greece and Tafne in Egypt . And if Apollo be the you thful Sun - God, like Horus, on the hor izon, who climbs the Tree of Dawn, the dews woul d be dried by him; otherwise the Tree of Moisture woul d be transforme d into a tree of fire, and assum e the bur ning nature of the Laurel, as in the Greek story. It was the Sun that kindl ed the fire, and as the Sun climbed up the Tree the Dews of Tefnut dried. It was not the Dawn quâ Dawn that was change d into a Laurel, but t he cool Green Tree of Dew=Tafne=Daphne , or the Dawn that was dried and turned into the Tree of blazing lustre by the Solar fire, or the Sun, i.e., by Horus or Apol lo when personi fied. The Water of Heaven and the Tree of Dawn precede personi fication, and th e name of Tefnut , from Tef (to drip, spit, exude , shed, effuse, suppl y), and Nu, for Heaven, show s that Tefnut represented the dew that fell from the Tree of Dawn. She is the giver of the dew; hence the water of dawn is said to be the water of Tefnut . Tefn u gives the moisture from the Tree of Dawn in heavenly dew, but in anot her character she is fierce as fire, and is por trayed in the figure of a lione ss. The truth is, there was Egypt ian science enough extant to know that the dew of Dawn was turned into the vapour that was formed into the Green Tree on the hor izon by the rising Sun of Morning, and the Kamite Mythos which represented the natural fact was afterwards conve rted into a Greek fancy, as in num erous other instances. Max Müller asked how it was that our Ancestors, who were not idiots, although he has done his utmost to make them appe ar idiotic in the matter of mythol ogy , came to tell the story of a King who was married to a Frog? His expl anation is that it arose, as usual, from a misappl ication of na mes. The Frog was a name given to the Sun, and the name of the frog, Bekha , or Bekhi , was afterwards conf used with or mistaken for the name of a Maiden whom the King might have married. In reply to this absurd theory of the mythical origins anot her writer says it was the nature of savages to make such mistakes, not merely in names but in things ; in confusing natural phe nom ena and in conf oundi ng frog - nature with hum an nature: this conf oundi ng conf usion being the original staple of “savage Myth.” It woul d be difficult to tell which version is farthest from the actual fact. Whoe ver begins with the mythos as a produc t of the “savage” mind as savages are know n to - day is fatally in error. Neither will it avail to begin with idiots who called each other nick - names in Sanskrit. Let us make anot her test - case of Bekhi the Frog. The Sanskritist doe s not start fair. He has not learned the langua ge of 29 animals. The mythical representation had travelled a long way before any hum an king coul d have got mixed up with a F rog for his wife. We must go back to the Proto - Aryan beginni ngs , which are Egypt ian or Kamite. In Africa we find these things next to Nature where we can get no further back in search of origins. Egypt alone goe s back far enough to touc h Nature in these be ginni ngs , and, as so often to be said in the present work, Egypt alone has faithfully and intelligently kept the record. The Frog was a Luna r type on account of its metamorphos is from the Tadpol e - condi tion in the water to the four - legge d life on land whic h type was afterwards appl ied"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"to the Moon in its com ing forth from the waters of the Nun. The name of the Frog in Egypt ian is Ka, whence the Luna r Lady, who was represented as a Frog, is designa ted Mistress Heka or Hekat, who was a cons ort of the Solar God Khnum - Ra. An inscription in the British Museum tells us that unde r one of his titles Khnum was called “the King of Frogs .” There is no proof , perhaps, of his being a Frog himself, but his son, Ptah, had a Frog - headed form, and his cons ort, Hekat, is the F rogge ss. This, then, is the very King by name who was wedde d to a Frog, but not as a hum an being. Such a tale was onl y told when the Gnos is was no longe r truly taught and the ancient myth had been mode rnised in the Märchen. In the Kamite mythos Khnum has t hree Cons orts, the Godde sses Hekat, Sati, and Ank. We might call them one Wife and two Cons orts. The wife is Ank, whos e name signi fies the Mirror. She persona tes the Moon as reflector of the Sun. Hekat and Sati are representatives of the dua l luna tion; Hek at is the Frog of Darkne ss, and Sati the Lady of Light . As the Frog, Hekat sloughs her frogskin and reveals her wondr ous beauty in the form of Sati, the Wom an in glory. These three are the Cons orts of Khnum - Ra, who is (1) in Amenta with Hekat, (2) in Heave n with Sati, and (3) in the Moon herself, as the Generator of Light with Ank, or in the Mirror. Khnum - Ra is the noc turnal Sun, and Hekat, his Cons ort, is a representative of the Moon that transforms in the low er hemisphe re, as the tadpol e transforms and em erges from the waters in the form of a frog. Khnum , God of the Nocturnal Sun, is King of Frogs in Amenta, the hidde n unde rworld, and it is there that Hekat is his Cons ort as the Froggess. In the uppe r Heaven she is the love ly godde ss with the arrow of ligh t that was shot from the luna r bow with which her name of Sati (Copt ic, Sate) is hierogl yphi cally written. And every time she re - enters the water of the nether world she transforms into a Frog according to the mythical mode of representing the Moon in Amen ta. Thus we can identify the “Sun - Frog” of the Aryan Märchen in the Frog - headed solar God (Ptah) or in Khnum , “the king of frogs ,” bot h of whom were solar deities. We can also identify the Frog - maiden in “Mistress Heka,” or Hekat, the godde ss with a Frog’ s head, who is one of Khnum ’s Cons orts, the Cinde rella (so to say) of the three sisters, who are Ank, Sati, and Hekat, the three godde sses of the myth who survive as the well - know n three Sisters of the Märchen. The “Sun - frog” then was Khnum , “the King of Fr ogs ,” as the Sun in the night of the unde rworld, who was wedde d to Hekat, the luna r frog in the mythos which suppl ied the matter for the Märchen. 30 It is onl y in this nether world that Sun and Moon can ever meet, and that but onc e a mont h, when the Lad y of Light transforms into the Frog, or Hekat, which Frog re - transforms into Sati, the Lady of Light , when she emerges from the abys s. The King was not to be seen by his Mistress without the roya l garments on, and these were laid aside when the Sun - God ent ered the nether earth. If the lady dared to look upon her love r in the night she woul d find him in the shape of the Beast, as in “Beauty and the Beast,” which was prohi bited; and if the love r looke d upon the Maiden unde r certain condi tions she woul d transf igur e into a Frog or other amphi bious creature, and permanently retain that shape, as the story was told when the myth was moralised in the Märchen; the exact antithesis of the Frog that transformed into a beautiful Princess, the transformation of Bekhi , a nd pos sibly (or certainly) of Phryne , the Frog, whos e sum ptuous beauty was victorious ly unve iled when she was derobe d before her vanqui shed judge s. In the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"different pha ses of the mythos the young Sun - god might have been met by night as a Crocodi le, a Beetl e, a Frog, an Eel, or a Bear, for the Bear was also a zoot ype of Horus. In one of his battles with Sut he fought in the form of a Bear. It was a law of primitive Tapu that the bride or wife was not to be seen by the love r or hus band in a state of nudity. I n the story of Melusine the bride is not to be look ed on when she is naked. She tells her love r that she will onl y abide with him so long as he obs erves this custom of wom en. This also was the law in the mythical land of Naz, and one man who did look on hi s wife unve iled was transformed into a mons ter. Now the veil of the bride is one with that of the virgin Isis, which originated in the loin - cloth or leaf - belt that was demande d by the “custom of wom en” when the female first became pube scent. In Egypt , th e dog - headed Ape Aani was a zoot ype of the moon in her period of eclipse and change , as expl ained by Hor - Apol lo (B. I, 14). The menstruating Ape was a representative of the Sloughi ng Moon, that is of the veiled bride, the female who was on no account to be looke d on in her nudi ty. The Sun and Moon coul d not meet below except when the godde ss or mistress did vanish from the light of mortals in the world above . The luna r lady in her poor and lone ly state goe s unde rground or enters the waters to make her trans formation and is invi sible during three night s (and days), which correspond to the three days’ festival at which Cinderella lost her slippe r (the last relic of the magical skin), and won the heart of the fairy prince. The meeting of the sun and moon in Ame nta was mont hly: onc e every twenty - eight days, as it was reckone d in the Calenda r which, for mystical reasons , count ed 13 new moons to the year; and it is these mystical reasons which alone can penetrate to the natural origin of Tapu conc erning the custom of wom en. It was the menses=the mensis; the female period= the luna r. The wife, as we have seen, was not to be looke d upon dur ing her mont hly period when she was in retirement, like the moon onc e a mont h. It was on the sixth day of the New Moon that Osiris re - entered the orb and paid his first visit to the Lady of Light . The Australian deity Pundj el is said to have a Wife whos e face he never looks upon. (Smyth, vol. I, 423. ) When that representation was first made Amenta was not know n as the mont hly 31 mee ting - place for Moon and Sun by night . It had only been obs erved that they did not meet by day. Isis, veiled in black, goe s dow n to the nether - world in search of lost Osiris. It was onl y there they ever met, He as the Bull of Eternity, She as the Cow , a lat er type than the Frog of Hekat. This drama of the primitive mysteries, this mythical mode of representing natural fact, is at times more appe aling in its touc hing simplicity than anyt hing to be found amongs t the best things that have been “said” in litera ture. The custom of wom en which was to be religious ly respected being identified, it is easy to see that this led to other custom s of Tabu, which were founde d and practised as mode s of memorising the law intende d to be taught and fulfilled. The mystical B ride who was not to be seen naked was persona ted by the Wife who wore the bridal veil, or the Wife whos e face was never to be seen by her hus band unt il she had bor ne him a child: or who is onl y to be visited unde r cove r of the night .

We have here a reference to the twenty - seven night s of luna r light , the three night s of the moon out of sight , toge ther with the transformation and re - arising on the third day.

Urvasi says to Pururavas, “Com e to me the last night of the year, and thou shalt be with me for one night , and a Son will be bor n to thee.” The Egypt ians have preserved for us and beque athed the means of interpreting this typol ogy of the early Sign - langua ge. The primitive cons cious ness or know ledge which has lapsed or got confused in inne r Africa, or Australia, Indi a, or Greece, lived on and left its record in their system of signs . If the Australian savage doe s attribut e the earliest marriage - laws to a Crow , he is but saying the same thing as Hor - Apol lo (I, 9), who tells us that when the Egypt ians denot e marriage they depict two Crow s, because the birds coha bit in the hum an fashion, and their laws of intercour se are strictly monoga mic.

No race of men ever yet imagined that the animals talked in hum an langua ge as they are made to do in the popul ar Märchen. No men so “primitive” as to think that anyone was swallow ed by a great fish and remained three days and nights in the mons ter’s belly, to be afterwards belched up on dry land alive.

The abor igines do not mistake the facts of nature as we have mistaken the primitive method of representing them. It is we, not they, who are the most delude d victims of false belief. Christian capacity for believing the impos sible in nature is unpa ralleled in any time past amongs t any race of men. Christian readers denounc e the primitive 33 realities of the mythical representation as pue rile inde ed, and yet their ow n realities alleged to be eternal, from the fall of Adam to the redemption by means of a crucified Jew, are little or nothing more than the shadow s of these primitive simplicities of an earlier time. It will yet be seen that the cu lmination of credul ity, the meanest emasculation of mental manhood, the densest obs curation of the inw ard light of nature, the com pletest imbecility of shut - eyed belief, the nearest appr oach to a total and eternal eclipse of com mon sense have been attained beyon d all change of com petition by the victims of the Christian creeds. The genesis of delusive supe rstitions is late, not early. It is not the direct work of nature herself. Nature was not the mother who began her work of developm ent by nur sing her chil d in all sorts of illusions conc erning things in general. She did not place her hands upon his eyes and bid him to interpret the world subj ectively. Primitive man was not a metaphys ician, but a man of com mon sense. And if limited as a limpet, he clung hard and fast to the rock of reality as the sole ground he had to go upon . The realities without and around were too pressing for the senses to allow him to play the fool with delusive idealities; the intellectual and sentimental luxur ies of later hyl o - idealis ts.

It has been asserted that there was little or no prayer in the low er forms of religion. But this woul d have to be determined by Sign - langua ge rather than by words. Two hands of a person clasped toge ther are equi valent to a spoke n prayer. In the Ritual, the speaker says of the God Osiris, “His Branch is of prayer, by means of which I have made myself like him.” (Ch. XXVIII.) Teru is the Branch, and the same word signi fies to ador e, invoke , and pray. It was as a mode of praying that the branches of the bedw en or birch were strewn in the ancient British graves. It is the same langua ge and the same sign when the Australian abor igines appr oach the camp of strange rs with a green bough in their hands as the sign of amity equi valent to a prayer for peace and good - wi ll. Acted Sign - langua ge is a practical mode of praying and asking for what is wanted by portraying instead of saying.

Not onl y are the four naked natives draggi ng the water - cow ove rland; two of them also carry the water - plant, proba bly a lotus , in their hands , as a sym bol of the water that is so greatly needed. It was a com mon mode of primitive appe al for savages 34 to inflict great suffering on the representative victim to com pel the necessary respons e. In this case, as we read the langua ge of signs , they are intendi ng to com pel the nature - pow er to send them water, the female hippopot amus or water - cow being the image of that pow er. This woul d be dragge d across the land as a palpable mode of forcing the Great Cow of Earth to yield the water, i n the langua ge that was acted. The appe al to the Pow er beyond was also made with the hum an being as the suffering victim. In Transylvania, girls strip themselves stark naked, and, led by an elder wom an who is likewise naked, they steal a harrow and carry i t across a field to the nearest brook; then they set it afloat and sit on the harrow for an hour in making their appe al. The Pawnee Victim (or the Khond Meriah) made appe al to the cruel Pow ers as the intercessor and suppl iant on behalf of the peopl e by her wounds , her tears and groans, her terrible tortures purpos ely prolonge d in slow ly dyi ng, her torn tormented flesh agape with ruddy wounds , as in the later Mysteries where the Victim was held to be divine. Pathetic appe al was made to the Nature - Pow er or El emental Spirit, chiefly the Goddess of Earth as food - giver, by means of the suffering, the moans, the tears, the prayers of the Victims. This was employe d as a Movi ng - Pow er, often cruel enough to search the heavens for the likeness of a pitying hum an heart . The ears of dogs were pinched by the Mexican wom en dur ing an eclipse to make them how l to the Pow er of Light . Meal - dus t is throw n into the eyes of the Sacred Turtle by the Zuni s to make it weep. The Australian Diererie solicit the Good Spirit for"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"rain by bleeding two of their Medium s or divinely - inspired men, suppos ed to be persons of influence with the Moor a - Moor a or Good Spirits, who will take heed of their sufferings and send dow n rain. The scene described by Gason ( The Native Tribes of Sout h Australia , p. 276) shoul d be com pared with that in the 1st Book of Kings , ch. XVIII, where the Priests of Baal cut and slash their flesh with knives and lances and limp around the altar with their bleeding wounds as a mode of invoki ng heaven for rain. Such custom s were uni versal; they were suppl icating in the dum b drama of Sign - langua ge for the water or the food that was most fervently desired. The Guanches used to separate the lambs from their mothers, so that their bleatings might make a more touc hing appe al to th e supe rhum an Pow ers. When the corn of the Zulus was parched with cont inua l drought they woul d hunt for a particular Victim called the “Heaven - Bird,” as the favour ite of the Gods , kill it and cast it into a pool of water. This was done that the heart of hea ven might be softened for its favour ite, and weep and “wail for it by raining; wailing a fune real wail.” (Callaway, Religious System of the Amazulu, p. 407 .) The idea is to make the Heavens weep at sight of this appe al, that is representation, of the suffe ring peopl e, and elicit an answer from above in tears of rain. The custom s generally expr ess the need of water and the suffering endur ed from long - cont inued drought . When the Chinaman raises his little breast - work of earth with bot tles stuck in it muzzle out ward, look ing like guns in pos ition, to scare away the devils or evil Nature - Pow ers, he is threatening them and protecting his dwelling in Sign - langua ge — signs which they are 35 suppos ed to unde rstand. Making the sign of the Cross or ringi ng the bells subs erves the same pur pos e in the religion of Rom e. When the chur ch - bells were rung in a thunde rstorm it was intende d to scare off evil spirits just as much as was the Chinaman’s futile fortification. The Intichium a ceremoni es of the Arunt a Tribes are amo ngs t the most primitive now extant upon the surface of the earth. These are performed as sacred mysteries in various mode s of Sign - langua ge, by which the thought , the wish, the want is magically expr essed in act instead of, or in addi tion to, words. The ob vious obj ect of these most ancient mysteries of magic is the perenni al increase of food , more expr essly of the animal or plant that gives its name to the totem of thos e who perform the particular rites. The members of the witchetty - grub Tribe perform a mys tery of transformation in relation to the grub which is an important article of diet. With magical incantations they call upon the grub to lay an abunda nce of eggs . They invi te the animals to gather from all directions and beg them to breed in this par ticu lar feeding - ground of theirs. The men encase themselves in the structure intende d to represent the chrysalis from which the grub emerges in re - birth, and out of this they crawl. In trying to interpret the dum b drama of these totemic mysteries we have to le arn what is thought and meant to be expr essed chiefly by what is done . Thus we see the mystery of transformation is acted magically by the men of the witchetty - grub totem for the produc tion of food in the most primitive form of a prayer - meeting or religiou s service; and the Pow ers are solicited, the want made know n by signs , especially by the sign of fasting during the performance. They shuf fle"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"forth one after anot her in imitation of animals newly bor n. Thus they enact the drama or mystery of transformation in character. The primary pha se of what has been cont inua lly miscalled “Phallic Worship” originated in the idea and the sym bol ism of Motherhood. The Earth itself as produc er of food and drink was looke d upon as the Mother of life. The Cave in the Earth w as the Wom b of the Bringe r - forth, the uterine sym bol of the Genetrix. The Mother in Mythol ogy is the Abode . The sign of the female signi fied the place of birth: the birth - place was in the cave, and the cleft in the rock or entrance to the Mother - earth was the earliest pha llic type identified throughou t external nature. The Cave, the Cavern, or Cleft in the rock was an actual place of Mother - earth. Hence the mount of earth, or the rock, was made a type of the Earth - mother in the stone seat of Isis, or the co nical pillar of Hathor . The Stone - Image of the moun t of earth as Mons Veneris was identified at times as female by the kte...j being figur ed on it, as it was upon the coni cal stone of Elagabalus: or the impression of Aphr odi te which was poi nted out upon the Black Stone at Mecca by Byzantine writers. The Cteis or Yoni was the natural entrance to or out rance from the Mount , and all its co - type s and equi valents, because it was an emblem of the Mother who brought forth her children from the earth. The natives of Central Africa have a widespread tradition that the hum an race sprang out of a soft stone . This goe s far tow ards 36 identifying the stone as a sym bol of the earth; especially the stone with a hol e in it that was made use of in the Mysteries as the emble m of a second or spiritual birth. The Yao, of Central Africa, affirm that Man, toge ther with the animals, sprang from a hol e in the rock. This birthpl ace, with the Arunt a of Australia, is represented by the stone with a hol e in it, from which the children emanate as from the wom b of Creation. In their magical ceremoni es they represent a wom an by the emblematic figur e of a hol e in the earth. (N.T., p. 550. ) Also a figur e of the Vulva as the Door of Life is imaged on certain of their Totems. The Esqui maux Gre at Mother Sidné is the earth itself as produc er of life and provi der of food , who is a figur e of the Mother. The origin of so - called “Phallic worship” then began with the earth herself being represented as the Wom b of Universal Life, with the female emble m for a figure of the Birth - place and Bringe r - forth. Not that the emblem was necessarily hum an, for it might be the sign of the Hippopot amus, or of the Lione ss, or the Sow ; anyt hing but worshipful or hum an. The mythical gestator was not imaged primarily as a Wom an, but as a pregna nt Water - Cow , size being wanted to represent the great, i.e., enceinte, Earth - mother, and her chamber of birth. But, unde r whatsoever type , the Mother was the abode , and the ova l image drawn by the cave - dw ellers on their walls as t he uni versal figur e of the female prove s the type to have been uterine. The Female was the dw elling and the door of life, and this was her image “in all the earth.” The likeness was also cont inue d in the ova l bur ial - place as sign and sym bol of re - birth, an d lastly as the ova l window or the door in architecture; the Vesica in Freemasonr y. The Mother’s Wom b was not onl y a prototype of the tom b or temple; it also represented the hous e of the living. “When the magistrate of Gwello had his first hous e bui lt in wattle and daub, he found that the Makalanga wom en, who were enga ged to plaster it, had produc ed,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"according to a general custom , a clay image of the female member in relief upon the inside wall. He asked them what they did that for. They answered benevol en tly that it was to bring him good luck. This illustrates the pur e form of the cult of these peopl e, who recogni ze the unknow n and uns een pow er by reverencing its manifestation (in this instance) on the female side of the creative principle.” (Joseph Miller d Orpen, The Nineteenth Century, Augus t, 1896, pp. 192 - 3.) They kne w the natural magic of the emblem if the Europe an did not. Also, they were identifying the wom an with the abode . In Bent’s book he gives an illustration of an iron - smelting furnace, conve nt iona lly show ing the female figure and the maternal moul d. “All the furnaces found in Rhode sia are of that form, but thos e which I have seen (and I have com e upon five of them in a row ) are far more realistic, most minut ely and statuesque ly so, all in a cro ss - legge d sitting pos ition, and clearly show ing that the produc tion or birth of the metal is cons idered worthy of a special religious expr ession. It recogni zed the Creator in one form of his hum an manifestation in creation. ” This is lofty langua ge. “We cal l the same thing by anot her name in our part of the count ry.” The God Seb is the Egypt ian Priapus , who might be termed a Phallic deity. But he is the Earth - God and Father of Food; the God 37 of Fructification associated with plants and fruits, flow ers a nd foliage, which are seen issuing from his body . He is the “Lord of Aliment,” in whom the reproduc tive pow ers of earth are ithypha llically por trayed. But the pot ency represented by Seb was not hum an, although the hum an member is depicted as a type of the begetter or produc er. The enemies of Ra are repul sed by the pha llus of Horus. When the Apap - mons ter is ove rthrow n it is said, “Thy pha llus, O Horus, acts forever. Thy pha llus is eternal.” (Rit., XXXIX, 8.) Where Herakles employs his club against the Hydr a, the pha llus was the typi cal weapon used by Horus against the Apap - dragon. Apap was the Image of Evil as negation, sterility, non - produc tion; and the weapon of Horus sym bol ized the virile pow er of the procreative sun. Again, it is said the pha llus of Osiri s is agitated for the destruction of the rebels, and it doom s the beast Baba to be powerless dur ing millions of years. (Rit., XCIII, 1.) The Lion and pha llus are elsewhere identical as zoot ype and type of the solar force when it is said the luminous lion i n its cour se (the sun) is the pha llus of Ra. (Rit., XVII.) As this was solar and not hum an, it will account for the enor mous size of the image carried in the processions of the Phallus. ( Herodot us, B. II, 48.) Hippol ytus, in his account of the Naaseni, sp eaks of the hidde n mystery manifested by the pha llic figur e which held a “first pos ition in the most ancient places, being show n forth to the world, like a light set upo n a candl estick.” This identifies the male emblem with its solar origin as sym bol of th e Sun. It is som ething to know that when the long sperm candl es are set up in the religious Mysteries to - day, the Ritualists are not doi ng this to the praise and glory of the human member, but are making use of a type which has been cont inue d in the darkes t Christian ignor ance of pre - Christian origins. A still more curious but kindr ed case of survival occurs in Australia, where it is a custom yet extant amongs t the aborigines for the widow of a deceased person of impor tance to wear the pha llus of her dead hus band suspende d round her neck for som e time, even for years, after his death. This is not an action directly natural, but one that is"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"dom inated and directed by som e religious sentiment, how ever primitive, which makes the action sym bol ical, and Egypt , wh o used such type s, intelligently interprets them. By wearing the pha llus the widow was preserving it from decaying in the earth, and in wearing it she was preserving that type of resurrection which Isis in her character of the Widow sought so sedul ous ly to preserve in a typi cal image. (Plutarch, Of Isis and Osiris. ) In the Turin Ritual (ch. XCIII) the Manes prays that the Phallus of Ra may not be devour ed by the pow ers of evil at a feast of fiends . In Egypt ian Resurrection - scenes the re - arising of the dead or inert Osiris is indicated by the male emblem, re - erection being one with resurrection. It is thus the dead are raised or re - erected as Spirits and the pow er of rising again is imaged in the life - likeness as by the figur e of Amsu - Horus. Thus interpreted few things coul d be more pathetic than the poor Widow ’s devot ion to her dead hus band, in wearing the emblem as a toke n of his future resurrection. In poi nt of time and stage of developm ent the Widow in Australia is the natural prototype of the Widow divini zed as Isis who cons ecrated the pha llus of Osiris and wore it made of wood. It 38 is in such ways as this the Wisdom of Old Egypt will enable us to read the most primitive Sign - langua ge and to expl icate the most ancient typical custom s, because it cont ai ns the gnos is or science of the earliest wisdom in the world. The “Langua ge of Animals” is obvi ous ly Inne r African. It is employe d especially by the Bushm en and Hottentots. Just as obvi ous ly was it cont inue d by the dw ellers in the valley of the Nile. Beyon d the hierogl yphi cs are the living type s, many of which were cont inue d as Egypt ian, and these have the same signi ficance in Egyp t that they had in Inne r Africa, and still say the same things in the langua ge of words that they said as zootype s. It appe ars a s if the many links that we thought broke n past mendi ng in the long chain of hum an evol ution were preserved in Egypt . There is a Kamite tradition mentione d by Plutarch that previous to the time when Taht first taught a langua ge of words to the hum an race t hey used mere cries like the pre - hum an animals. We know that Hom o imitated the cries of the zoot ype s because he cont inue d to do so in the Totemic Mysteries. We know that the Ape was one of the most prom inent zoot ype s. Now the God Taht who is here called th e creator of speech, and whos e name of Tehut i is derived from Tehu, a word for speech and to tell, is por trayed in the form of the Kaf - Ape. The Kaf - Ape is the clicking Cynoc epha lus; and it is recogni zed as the Clicker who preceded the Speaker; the animal f rom whom the later langua ge came. Whence the Kaf - headed Taht - Ani is the figur e of the God who taught manki nd their speech and made the hierogl yphi cs, which ultimately led to letters. This type of langua ge, speech, the word, the mout h, the tongue , carries u s back to the pre - lingua l Clickers, and establishes the link betwixt them and the Clicking Ape in tracing the origin and line of descent for hum an speech. The Cynoc epha lus, then, represents a pre - hum an sour ce of speech, and is personi fied in Taht - Ani as th e Divine Speaker. We may look upon the Clicking Ape as one of the animals whos e sounds were repeated by his successor Man. The Egypt ian record testifies to his preeminence. Possibly the Ape, as typi cal talker, Sayer or Divine Word, may account for the trad ition current among the Negroes in West Africa, also in Madagascar, that the Apes onc e talked and coul d do so yet, but they conc eal their faculty of speech for fear they shoul d be made to work. The"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Ass was also honour ed like the Ape of Taht - Ani as a salute r of the Gods or Nature - Pow ers. It was a great past - master of pre - hum an sounds , as the pre - hum an utterer of the vow els in their earliest form. (Nat. Genesis.) The Egypt ians call the Ass by the name of Iu, Aiu, and Aai, three forms of one primary diphthong in which the seven vow el - sounds originated. Iu signi fies to com e and go, which might aptly describe the Ass’s mode of produc ing the voi ce. Aiu or Iu with the A protheic show s the process of accretion or aggl utination which led to the word Aiu, Iao, Ioa, Ia hu becom ing extende d to the seven vow els finally represented in the fully drawn - out name of Jehova h, which was written with the seven vow els by the Gnos tics. The Engl ish attribut e the dua l sound of “hee - haw” to the Donke y, and, if we om it the aspirate, “ee - aw” is near enough as a variant and the equi valent of Iu, Aiu, or Aai, as the name given to itself by the Ass which was registered in langua ge by 39 the Egypt ians. The animal with his loud voi ce and long - cont inue d braying was an unpa ralleled prototype o f the Praiser and Glorifier of the Gods or Nature - Pow ers. He uttered his vow el - sounds at the bot tom and top of the octave which had onl y to be filled in for the Ass to becom e one of the author s of the musical scale. Such were two of the Sayers in the langu age of animals, as zoot ype s, as pictogr aphs of ideas; as likenesses of nature - pow ers; as words, syllables, and letters; and what they said is to be read in Totemism, Astronom y, and Mythol ogy; in the primitive sym bol ism of the abor igines, and in the mystica l type s and sym bol s now ignor antly claimed to be Christian. It is but doi ng the simplest justice to these our predecessors in the ascendi ng scale of life and evol ution to show som ething of the rôle they onc e played and the help they have rende red to nasce nt, non - articulate man in suppl ying the primary means of imaging the supe r - hum an forces surroundi ng him; in lendi ng him their ow n masks of persona lity for Totemic use before he had acqui red one of his ow n, and in giving shape and sound and external likenes s to his earliest thought , and so assisting him on his upw ard way with the very means by which he parted com pany from them. Whos oever studi es this record by the light that shineth from within will surely grow more hum anly tende r tow ards the natural zoot ype s and strive henceforth to protect them from the curse of cruelty, whether inflicted by the fury of the brutal savage or the bloody lust of the violating vivisectioni st. This zoom orphi c mode of representation offers us the key by which we can unl ock the sh ut - up mind of the earliest, most benighted races so far as to learn more or less what they mean when they also talk or act their unw ritten langua ge of animals in Totemic custom s and religious rites, and repeat their Märchen and dark sayings which cont ain t he disjecta membra of the myths. It is as perfect for this pur pos e of interpreting the thought of the remotest past, becom e conf used and chaotic in the present, as in the alpha bet for rende ring the thought of the present in verbal language. Hom o was the f inisher but by no means the initial fashione r of langua ge. Man was preceded by the animals, birds, and reptiles, who were the utterers of pre - verbal sounds that were repeated and cont inue d by him for his cries and calls, his interjections and exclamations , which were afterwards worked up and develope d as the cons tituents of later words in hum an speech into a thous and forms of langua ge. Thinking, by man or animal, doe s not depend upon speech. Naming is not necessary for reflecting an image of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"the place or th ing or person in the mirror of the mind. Though t is primarily a mental mode of representing things . Without true images of things , there is no trustworthy process of thought . Doubt less many blank forms may be filled in with a word as a subs titute for think ing; but words are not the image of things , nor can they be the equi valent of the mental representation which we call thinki ng. It is the metaphys ician who thinks , or thinks he thinks , in words alone — not the Poet, Dramatist, or natural man. The Argus - eyed Pheasant did not think in words but in images and colours when she painted certain spot s upon the feathers of her youn g proge ny. Thought is pos sible without words to the animals. Thought was pos sible without words 40 to inarticulate man and the mere clic kers. The faculty of thinki ng without words is inhe rent in the dum b, and it is impos sible that such faculty shoul d be extinct or not exercised by articulate man. Much thinki ng had been acted without words before the appe arance of Man upon the planet. Also by Hom o while as yet there were no words but onl y cries, ejaculations , and animal sounds . The dog can think withou t words. To make its hidde n meaning heard, how pleadingl y he will beseech without one sound of hum an speech. So it is with the hum an being. As an example, let us suppos e we are goi ng ups tairs to bed in the dark. In doi ng this we do not think “S t a i r s,” — “B a n i s t e r,” — “L a n d i n g,” handl e of door , Candl e - stick, Matches. We act the same as if we saw, onl y the vision is within and the da rk without . We see the stair and feel for it with the foot . We see the banister mentally and clutch it with the hand. Internal seeing and external touc h conc ern us a thous andf old more than words, and these give us a sensible hol d of outer things . Thou ght d oes not need to spell its way in letters. We are thinking all the while as a process of mental representation, and do not go on words when we are not called upon to speak. The Bull and Cow said “Moo” ; the Cow with us is still called a “Moo - Cow ” in nur sery langua ge. The Goat and Ram said “Ba.” The Goos e in hissing cried “Su.” The Hippopot amus in roaring said “Rur” or “Rur - rur.” Various others in uttering sounds by nature were giving themselves the names by which they were to be know n in later langua ge. The name of the Cat in Egypt ian is Mau or Miau. This, then, was one of the self - namers, like the Goos e Su. Philologi sts may tell us that “Mu” and “Ba” and “Su” are not words at all. In Egypt ian they are not onl y words but things , and the things are named by th e words. Such words are a part of the primary sound - stuff out of which our later words were coined. Moreove r, they are words in the Egypt ian langua ge. In that we find the word Ba signi fies to be, Ba therefore is a form of to be. Also it is the name for the Ram and the Goat, bot h of whom are type s of the Ba - er or Be - ing, bot h of whom say “Ba.” The Cow says Moo. Mu (Eg.) means the mother, and the mythical mother was represented as a moo - cow . The Ibis was one of the self - namers with its cry of “Aah - Aah,” cons e que ntly Aah - Aah is one name of the bird in the Egypt ian hierogl yphi cs, and also of the moon which the Ibis represented. It is but natural to infer that the Totemic Mother woul d make her call with the sound of the animal that was her Totemic zoot ype . Her z oot ype was her totem, and her call woul d identify her with her totem for the children of each particular group. But where the moo - cow made its gentle call at milking - time, the water - cow woul d roar and"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"make the welkin ring. And the wide - mout hed roarers woul d be imitated first perforce, because most pow erful and impressive. They roared on earth like the thunde r or Apap - reptile in the darkne ss ove rhead. In the hierogl yphi cs the word rur is equa l to roar in Engl ish, or to ruru, for the loud - roarer in Sanskrit; and the greatest type of the roarer unde r that name is Rurit the hippopot amus, whos e likeness was figur ed in heaven as the Mother of the Beginni ngs . When the Cat cried “miau” it did not exactly utter the letters which now com pos e the word, but cont ribut ed the primary sounds evol ved by 41 the animal in its caterwauling; and the phone tics that follow ed were evol ved in perfecting the sounds . The shaping of primary into fully develope d sounds , and cont inui ng these in words, was the work of the dawning hum an i ntelligence. So with other pre - hum an sounds that were produc ed by animals before the adve nt of Man. According to the hidde n Wisdom , which is now almost a dead letter, there are reasons why we shoul d be particular in soundi ng the letter H as an aspirate. I n the hierogl yphi cs one H or Ha - sign is the fore - part of a Lion, signi fying that which is first, beginni ng, essence, chief, or Lord; and Shu the power of Breathing - force is represented by a panting lion. This, then, is the “Ha,” and in expelling the breath it makes the sound of Ha. Thus the Lion says “Ha,” and is the figur e of breathing - force; and this one of the origins in langua ge survives in the letter H — when prope rly aspirated. It is a dark saying of the Rabbi ns that “All cam e out of the letter H.” The Egypt ian zoot ype s and hierogl yphi cs are the letters in which such dark sayings were written and can still be read. The letter H, Hebrew He, Egyp tian Ha, is the sign of breath, as a Soul of Life, but as the hierogl yphi cs show , even the breath that is firs t signi fied was not hum an. The earliest typi cal breather is an animal. The panting lion imaged the likeness of the solar force and the breath of the breeze at dawn, as an ideogr aphi c zoot ype of this especial Nature - pow er. On the line of upw ard ascent the l ion was given to the god Shu, the Egypt ian Mars. On the line of descent the ideogr aphi c type passes finally into the alpha bet for com mon everyda y use as the letter H. The supr emacy of the lion amongs t animals had made it a figur e of firstness. And in the r educ ed form of the hierogl yphi cs the forepart of the lion remained the sign of the word “Ha,” which denot es priority. The essence of all that is first and foremost may be thought in this likeness of the lion. Amongs t the natural zoot ype s which served at f irst as ideogr aphs that were afterwards reduc ed to the value of letters in the final phone tic pha se, we see that beast, bird, fish, and reptile were cont inue d unt il the written supe rseded the painted alpha bet.

The zoot ype s serve to show the onl y ground on which a divine origin coul d have been ascribed to langua ge on account of the pre - human and supe rhum an sounds . Several of these are representative of Pow ers in nature that were divinized. They uttered the sounds by which they were self - named, and thus the Langua ge of Animals might becom e the langua ge of the Gods . The zoot ype of Apt the Roarer was the Hippopot amus, and Apt of Ombos was “the Living Word.” The zoot ype of Taht, as God of Speech and Writing, was the Clicking Ape. A zoot ype of the noc turnal Sun as Atum - Ra was the Ass. The Goos e that said “Su” was a zoot ype of Seb the God of Earth. Ka is the Egypt ian name for the Frog; this was obvi ous ly self - conf erred by the call of the animal, and the Frog was made a zoot ype of Pow er divinized in Ptah the God of Transformation and Evol ution. It is obvi ous that Hom o in making his gestures either cont inue d or imitated soun ds that were already extant in the animal world, such as the clicks of the Cynoc epha lus, and other sounds which can be identified with their zoot ype s, the animals that uttered the sounds before man had com e into being. We know that monke ys have an unc ont ro llable hor ror of snakes, and no doubt primitive man had a similar feeling. Now , suppos ing the primitive man in a difficulty wished to warn his fellow s of the presence of a snake, and had no words to conve y the warning with, what woul d he do? What coul d he do but make use of the imitative faculty which he pos sessed in com mon with the ape? He woul d try to utter som e signa l of warning in an imitative manne r! The sound woul d have to be self - defining i.e., a snake - sound for a snake. It is usually said that snake s hiss. But the Africans represent them as puf fing and blow ing rather than hissing, as we have it expr essed in the name of the puf f - adde r. When the snake swelled and distende d itself, reared up and puffed, it made the sound which constituted its ow n audi bl e sign: and the hum an being woul d naturally repeat that sound as his not e of warning to anyone in dange r. The apes will do so much, for they will swell and puf f and thrust out the mout h, expe l their breath and spit at sight of the snake.

To do this the mimic woul d swell and puf f out his cheeks in puffing out his breath. He woul d thus becom e the living likeness of the puf f - adde r, bot h to eye and ear. The man woul d represent the audi ble image and visible likeness of the snake, and such a representation woul d belong to the very genesis of gesture - langua ge and natural hieroglyphi cs. Further, we have the means of provi ng that such was the process in the beginni ng. The puf f - adde r, the 43 cerastes or hor ned snake, remains the Egypt ian hierogl yphi c sign for the phone tic figure or letter F, the syllabic Fu, which was an ideogr aphic fuff or puf f - adde r. The swelling, puf fing, fuffing snake is self - named and self - defined in the first or ideogr aphi c stage — it then becom es fu in the second or syllabic stage, and finally is the letter F of mode rn langua ge, where it still carries the two horns o f the hierogl yphi c snake. Here we see the survival of the snake as one of the mystical author s of langua ge, like the Ape, the Ass, the Goos e, the hissers, pur rers, grunters, roarers previously described. Som etimes the zoot ype s are cont inue d and remain app arent in the persona l name. Som e neighbour s of the present writer, who are know n by the name of Lync h, have a Lynx in their coat - of - arms, without ever dreaming that their name was derived from the Lynx as their totem, or that the Lync hes were the Lynxe s. T his is one of num erous survivals of primitive totemism in mode rn heraldry. Again, the Lynx is one of the animals which have the pow er of seeing in the dark. The Moon is an eye that sees by night , or in the dark. This was represented as the eye of the Lynx or the Cat, the Seer being divinized as a Lynx in Mafet, an Egypt ian Godde ss. The seeing pow er thus divinized is marked in later langua ge by the epithet “Lynx - eyed.” Lastly, there are som ething like 1,000 Ideogr aphi c signs in the Egyptian hierogl yphi cs, an d onl y 26 letters in our alpha bet. So few were the sounds , so num erous the visible signs of things and ideas. We now know that man had a langua ge of gesture - signs when he was otherwise dum b, or coul d only accom pany his visible signs with clicks and other a pe - like sounds , which he kept on repeating with intention unt il they were accepted at an exchange able value as the first current coinage or count ers of speech before words. The Zoot ype s were also cont inue d in the religious Mysteries to visibly and audi bly denot e the characters assum ed in this primitive drama. Just as the Zulu girl coul d not com e to her mistress because she was now a Frog, so the Manes in Amenta exclaim, “I am the Crocodi le.” “I am the Beetle!” “I am the Jackal!” “I am the God in Lion - form!” These expr ess his pow ers. They are also the supe rhum an forms taken by the supe rhum an pow ers, Pow er ove r the water, Pow er of transformation, Pow er of resurrection, Pow er of seeing in the dark of death, toge ther with others, all of which are assum ed because supe rhum an. In assum ing the type s he enters into alliance with the pow ers, each for som e particular pur pos e, or, rather, he persona tes them. When surrounde d by the enemies of the Soul, for example, he exclaims, “I am the Crocodi le - God in all his terrors.” This has to be read by the Osirian Drama. Osiris had been thus envi rone d by the Sebau and the associates of the evil Sut when he lay dismembered in Sekhe m. But he rose again as Horus. In this case the Crocodi le - type of terror was employe d: and down went t he adve rsaries before the Almight y Lord — thus imaged in Sign - langua ge. The Masque rade cont inue d in later Mysteries with the transformation of the performers in the gui se of beasts, birds, and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"reptiles, had been practised in the Mysteries of Amenta, where th e hum an Soul in passing through the Nether World assum ed shape after shape, and made its transformation from the one to the other in a series of new births according to the Kamite doc trine of metempsychos is, which 44 was afterwards perverted and turned i nto fool ishne ss in Indi a and in Greece. In this divine drama the Soul from earth is assimilated to the zoot ype s or is inve sted in their forms and endow ed with their forces which had figured forth the earlier Nature - pow ers in the mythol ogy. The Egypt ian Rit ual is written in this langua ge of animals, and never was it read in the past, never will it be in the future, unl ess the thinki ng can be done in the Ideogr aphi c type s of thought .

"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"45 TOTEMISM, TATTOO AND FETISHISM AS FORMS OF SIGN - LANGUAGE B OOK II W ITH due search we shall find that the unw ritten and remotest past of primitive man is not immemorial after all that may have been lost by th e way. Most obs cure condi tions have been more or less preserved and represented in the drama of primitive custom s; in the mirror of mythol ogy and the Sign - langua ge of Totemism. Ceremoni al rites were established as the means of memorizing facts in Sign - lang uage when there were no written records of the human past. In these the know ledge was acted, the Ritual was exhi bited, and kept in ever - living memory by cont inua l repetition. The Mysteries, totemic or religious , were founde d on this basis of action. Dancin g, for example, was a mode of Sign - langua ge in all the mysteries. To know certain mysteries implied the ability to dance them, when they coul d not be otherwise expr essed. The Bushm en say that the Mantis - Deity Kagn taught them the Mysteries of dancing unde r the type of the “Praying Mantis” or the leaping grasshoppe r. Primitive men had obs erved the ways and works of Nature, and imitated all they might as a means of thinki ng their meaning when they coul d not talk. They danced it with the Grasshoppe r, they writ hed and swelled and puf fed it with the Serpent; they panted it with the Lion, roared it with the Hippopot amus, hum med it with the insects, pawed and clicked it with the Ape. In shor t, they acted in accordance with the example of their forerunne rs on the ea rth. They not only wore the skins of animals and feathers of birds, they made their motions in Totemic dances and imitated their cries as a primary means of making themselves unde rstood. From the beginni ng in the far - off misty morning of the past, dancing in the likenesses of animals was a Totemic mode of demons tration. Amongs t the earliest deities of Egypt are Apt and Bes, who issue forth from Inne r Africa as dancers in the act of dancing the mystery of the pha llic dance, and in the skins of animals. The A runta Tribes of Central Australia dance the Unthippa Dance in the ceremony of young - man - making at the time of circum cision. This tells the story of the way they came in what is know n as the “Range all along. ” (Spencer and Gillen, Native Tribes of Central A ustralia, p. 442 .) It is said to be the dance of the Unthippa Wom en in the Alcheringa who were beings of bot h sexes and who danced all the way “unt il their organs were modi fied and they became as other wom en are.” This denot es the status of the 46 pre - To temic peopl e who were as yet undi vided by the Totemic Rites of Pube rty which are now illustrated in the mystery of the dance. In the Initiation ceremoni es of the males described by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen (p. 381) , a special dance of the wom en follow s t he making of the yout h into a man who is now welcom ed by them into the ranks of the elders. “A num ber of young wom en com e near. Each one is decorated with a doubl e hor se - shoe - shaped band of white pipe - clay which extends across the front of each thigh"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"and t he base of the abdom en. A flexible stick is held behind the neck and one end grasped by each hand. Standi ng in a group , the wom en sway slight ly from side to side, qui vering in a most remarkable fashion, as they do so, the muscles of the thighs and the base of the abdom en.” The obj ect of the decoration and move ment is evident. It is to incite the yout hs and prepare them for connubi um . At this period of the ceremoni es a general interchange and a lendi ng of wom en also takes place. “This wom en’s dance goe s on n ight after night for perhaps two or three weeks.” The men sing the “Corrobor ee Song” whilst the wom en dance the mystery of young - man making, and show the obj ect and mode of it. In this case white pipe - clay was subs tituted for the white Unda ttha - Dow n with w hich the female was usually embellished. Here the custom s of the Totemic Mysteries naturally sugge st that a primary obj ect in put ting on fur and feather or dow n, and dancing in the skin of the Totemic Animal at the festival of pube scence, was to dramatize the com ing age for sexua l intercourse when this was determined by the appe arance of the pube s whether of the female or the male. There had been a pre - Totemic period of prom iscuity in which there was no regul ated intercour se of sexes, no marriage by the gr oup, or of one half the group with the other half. At that time, or in the pre - eval state, the earth as yet was undi vided into Sout h and North; the Mythical Cow was not yet cut in twain, or the mother separated into the Two Wom en. Much is told us by tradit ion if we can but interpret truly. It says the race of beings was not then divided, and had but one leg to go or stand on, meaning there was but one stock. All the earth, in later phrase, being of one blood and of one langua ge. The sexes were not yet divid ed by the lizard, as female pube scence was qua intly figur ed. There was no cutting of the male or ope ning of the female with the firestick or the stone kni fe by which the sexes were divided, or made, or in the latter phrase “created” into men and wom en. The se were the “Inapertwa” beings in the Alcheringa who preceded wom en and men and were pre - Totemic. These were the Unope ned or the Uncircum cised, who had to be transformed into wom en and men by cutting and ope ning; that is by introcision and circum cision, or subi ncision, by which they were made into wom en and men in becom ing Totemic. Dancing then was a dramatic mode of rende ring the mysteries of primitive know ledge in visible Sign - langua ge. With the Tshi - speaking peopl es “Soffa,” the name of the priest, signi fies “the dancing man.” The African Achol i in their dances, says Sir H. Johns ton, imitate animals “most elaborately.” An African pot entate has been know n to dance for som e ten or fifteen minut es together in receiving a distingui shed Europe an visitor, like Richard Burton, before he had represented all his ow n titles of honour 47 and claims to adm iration in the langua ge of dance and gesture - signs . With the Bechua nas each Totem has its ow n special dance, and when they want to know the clan to which a strange r may belong they will ask “What dance do you dance?” as an equi valent for the que stion “To what clan do you belong? ” These dances are cont inue d in the Initiatory ceremoni es of Totemism. They tend to show that the shapes and sounds and move ments of the Tot emic animals were imitated in the primeval pantom ime by way of proclaiming the clan to which the particular group belonge d. The Totemic type was thus figur ed to sight in gesture - langua ge before it coul d be know n by name. Adm ission into the Dacota"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Clan was effected by means of the great Medicine Dance. The Medicine Men of the Iroquoi s have four dances which are sacred to themselves, no other person being allow ed to dance these Mysteries. The first is the “Eagle - Dance,” the second the “Dark Dance” (performed in the dark); the other two are the “Pantom ime Dance” and the “Witches’ Dance.” ( Myths of the Iroquoi s. Bureau of Ethnol ogy. Second Annua l Repor t, 1880 - 81, p. 116. ) The Eagle being the Bird of Light , the Sun - Bird, we may infer that the first two dances tol d the story of the Beginni ng with Light and Darkne ss, which was thus rende red in gesture - langua ge and cont inue d to be memorized in that fashion by thos e who danced such primitive Mysteries. We also learn from the sacred dances of the abor igines in the char acter of the Bear, the Wolf, the Seal, the Crab, or other animal that the gesture - langua ge include d an imitation of the Totemic zoot ype . The Manda n Indi ans dance the Buffalo - dance, the heads of the dancers being cove red with a mask made of the Buffalo’s he ad and hor ns. In other dances of the Dog and Bear totems, the dancers acted in the characters of the animals. The Llamas of Thibet dance the Old Year out and the New Year in whilst wearing their animal masks. The Snake - dance is still performed by the Moqui Indi ans of Arizona (Bour ke, Snak e - Danc e of the Moqu is, p. 116) , and also amongs t the Australian abor igines when they “make the Snake” in their sacred procession of the Mysteries (How itt). It was a com mon Totemic custom for the brothers and sisters to perf orm their com memorative ceremoni es or mysteries in the likeness of the Totemic - animal. In the Australian Rites of Initiation the teachings and moral lessons are conve yed in obj ect - lessons pantom imically displayed. The various Totems are indicated by the la ngua ge of gestures. The “Rock - Wallabies” are initiated by jum ping with the kne es slight ly bent and the legs kept wide apart. The Kangaroos hop about in the likeness of the Totemic animal. The how lings of a pack of dingoe s or wild dogs are heard afar off as if in the depth of the forest. The sounds grow less and less distant. At lengt h the leader of the band rushes in on all four s follow ed by the others. They run after each other on all four s round the fire, imitating the actions of wild dogs in the Dingo da nce. (A. W. How itt on som e Australian Ceremoni es of Initiation.) With the Inoi ts at their religious fêtes and anni versaries of the dead, the biographi es of the departed are told to the spectators in dum b show and dancing. With the Kakhye ns of Northern Burm ah it is the custom to dance the ghos t out of the hous e at the time of the fune ral. The Egypt ian mourners also accom panied the Manes on the way to Amenta with 48 song and dance, as may be seen in the Vigne ttes to the Book of the Dead, where the text deal s with the mysteries of the Resurrection. The same Mystery is expr essed in the Black Fellow ’s jum ping up a White Fellow when he rises from the dead. It used to be the custom in Scotland for dancing to be kept up all night long after a fune ral (Napier, Folk - lore of West Scotland, p. 66) . Not as a desire of getting rid of the Spirit, but as an act of rejoicing in dancing the Resurrection of the Spirit. The on - looke rs often wonde r why the performers in Gaelic and Keltic dances shoul d, when furious ly dancing, g ive forth such inhum an shout s and shrill blood - curdling cries. But there is not hing likelier than that these are remains of the “Langua ge of Animals,” and a survival of the primitive Totemic practices. Leaping in the air with a shout while dancing had a sp ecial dramatic signi ficance. What this was may be inferred from the Egypt ian Fune ral Scenes. That"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"which had survived as the Dance of Death in the Middl e Ages was the earlier Dance of the Resurrection, or the rising again from the dead. The dancing occurs i n the presence of the mum my when this has been raised to its feet and set on end, which is then a figure of the risen dead. The rising again was likewise imitated in the dance. Hence the wom en who are seen to be jum ping with curious cont ortions on som e of the bas - reliefs are acting the resurrection. It is their dut y and delight to “dance that dance” for the departed (Papyr us of Ani). Thus , Sign - langua ge, Totemism and Mythol ogy were not merely mode s of representation. They were also the primitive means of pr eserving the hum an expe rience in the remoter past of which there coul d be no written record. They cons titute the record of pre - historic times. The most primitive custom s, ceremoni al rites and revels, toge ther with the religious mysteries, originated as the means of keeping the unw ritten past of the race in ever - living memory by perenni al repetition of the facts, which had to be acted from generation to generation in order that the know ledge might becom e hereditary. This is a thesis which can be fully proved and permanently established. Before ever a Folk - tale was told or a legend related in verbal speech, the acting of the subj ect - matter had begun, dancing being one of the earliest mode s of primitive Sign - langua ge. Not “trailing Clouds of Glory” have we com e from any state of perfection as fallen ange ls in disgui se with the trium phs of attainm ent all behind us, but as animals emerging from the animal, wearing the skins of animals, uttering the cries of animals, whilst developi ng our ow n; and thus the nascent race has travelled along the course of hum an evol ution with the germ of immortal pos sibilities in it darkly struggl ing for the light , and a grow ing sense of the road being up - hill, therefore difficult and not to be made easy like the dow nw ard way to not hin gne ss and everlasting death. It is now qui te certain that speech was preceded by a langua ge of animal cries, accom panied by hum an gestures because, like the langua ge of the clickers, it is yet extant with the Abor igines, amongs t whom the langua ge - makers m ay yet be heard and seen to work in the pre - hum an way. The earliest human langua ge, we repeat, cons isted of gesture - signs which were accom panied with a few appr opr iate sounds , som e of which were traceably cont inue d from the predecessors of Man. A sketch fr om life in the camp of the Mashona 49 chief Lo Bengue la, made by Bertram Mitford, may be quot ed, much to the present pur pos e: — “‘He com es — the Lion! ’ and they roared. “‘Behol d him — the Bull, the black calf of Matyoba ne!’ — and at this they bellow ed. “‘He is the Eagle which preys upon the world!’ — here they screamed; and as each imitative shout was taken up by the armed regiments, goi ng through every conc eivable form of animal voi ce – the grow ling of leopa rds, the hissing of serpents, even to the sonor ous croa k of the bul l - frog – the result was inde scribably terrific and deafening. ” (“The Trium ph of Hilary Blachland, ” by Bertram Mitford, p. 28.) In this Sign - langua ge, which was earlier than words, the Red Men acted their wants and wishes in expr essive pantom ime w hilst wearing the skins of the animal that was pur sued for food . They “laid their case” as it were before the Pow ers previous to the hunt . Each hunt had its especial"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"dance which cons isted in the imitation of the motions , habits, and cries of the animals to be hunt ed. They climbed like bears, bui lt like beavers, gallope d about like buf faloes, leaped like roes, and yelped like foxe s. (Chateaubr iand, “Voya ge en Amer.,” p. 142. ) Travellers have detected a likeness betwixt the scream of the Prairie - dog and the s peech of the Apache Indians, who will imitate the animal so perfectly as to make it respond to them from the distance. On the night of the Luna r festival, when waiting for the Moon to rise, they will invoke her light with a conc ert of cries from their bret hren of the animal world, which include the neighing of the Horse, the whinnyi ng of the Mule, the braying of the Ass, the screech of the Coyot e, the call of the Hyena, the grow l of the Grizzly Bear, when this Totemic orchestra performs its nocturnal ove rtu re in the Langua ge of Animals. The Zuni Indi ans in their religious service imitate the cries of the beasts which are imaged as their fetishes in ceremoni al rites at the counc il of Fetishes. They sing a very long hym n or prayer - chant, and at the close of ea ch stanza the chor us cons ists of the cries which represent their Deities, called the Prey - Gods , in the gui se of their Totemic Animals. Hall, in his “Life with the Esqui maux, ” tells us how the Inoi t look up to the Bear as supe rior to themselves in hunt ing t he seal. Because, as they say, the Bear “talks sealish,” and can lull the animal to slum ber with his incantation. The Inoi t have learned the secret of Bruin, and repeat his langua ge all they can to fascinate, decoy, and magically ove rcom e the seal and capt ure it, but they are still beaten by the Bear. Dr. Franz Boaz has recently discove red the remains of a very primitive tribe of Abor igines near the bounda ry betwixt Alaska and British Colum bia. They are called the Tsutsow t, and are hunt ed to death by the In dians like wild beasts. They formerly cons isted of two Clans that rigidly obs erved the ancient law of Totemic connubi um , no wom an being allow ed to marry within her ow n Clan. At present there is but one Clan in existence, and the men of this Clan have been forced to seek for wives among the Indi ans of Nass river. These Tsutsow t appa rently talk in bird - langua ge. They cheep and chirrup or whistle in their speech with a great variety of notes. The Supr eme Spirit, Tharamulun, who taught the Murrung tribes 50 whatever arts they kne w, and instituted the ceremonies of Initiation for Young - man - making, is said to have ordered the names of animals to be assum ed by Men. (How itt, “On Som e Australian Beliefs.”) Before the names coul d be assum ed, how ever, the animals we re adopt ed for Totems, and the earliest names were more or less the cries and calls of the living Totems. The mothers woul d be know n by their making the cry of their Totemic animal, to which the children responde d in the same pre - hum an langua ge. The Sow (s ay) is the mother, the children are her pigs. The mother woul d call her children as a sow , and the children woul d try to repeat the same sounds in respons e. The Totemic Lione ss woul d call her kittens by purring, and the cubs woul d respond by pur ring. The H ippopot ami, Lions , and other loud roarers woul d grow terrible with the sounds they made in striking dread into the children. When as yet they had no names nor any art of tattooi ng the Totemic figur es on the flesh of their own bodi es, the brothers and siste rs had to demons trate who they were, and to which group they belonge d by acting the character of the zoot ype in the best way they coul d by crying or calling, low ing, grunt ing, or puf fing and pos turing like the animals in this primitive pantom ime or bal mas qué . Thus"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"the sign to the eye and the sound to the ear were continue d par i pas su in the dua l developm ent of Sign - langua ge that was bot h visual and voc al at the same time when the brothers and sisters were identifying themselves, not with nor as the animals , but by means of them, and by making use of them as zoot ype s for their Totems. The clicks of the Pygm ies, the San (Bushm en), the Khoi - Khoi (Hottentots), and the Kaffirs cons titute a living link betwixt the hum an beginne r and his predecessor the Ape. The B ushm en pos sess about the same num ber of clicks as the Cynoc ephal us or Dog - headed Ape. The Monke y - Mother also menstruates; anot her link betwixt the Ape and the hum an female. The Clickers bor n of her as blood - mother woul d be know n by their sounds as Monke y - M en. Taht - Aani is a Totemic monke y - man raised to the status of a divinity in Egypt . Hanum an is the same in India, where the Jaitwas of Rajput ana claim to be the descenda nts of the Monke y - God. And the Ape - Men, imitating the Cynoc ephal us, woul d be on the way to becom ing the hum an Clickers. Very naturally, naming by words woul d follow the specializing by means of the Totemic types, as we have Tree the type , and Tree the name; Bull the type , and Bull the name; Dove the type , and Dove the name; Lynx the type , and Lync h the name. An instance is suppl ied by Frederick Bonne y in his not es on the custom s of the River Darling Abor igines, New Sout h Wales, which is also to the poi nt. He obs erved that the children are nam ed after animals, birds, and reptiles, and the name is a word in their langua ge meani ng the movement or habi t of one of them. ( Jour nal Anthrop. Institute, May, 1883) . The soun d may be adde d. The Totem (say) is an animal. First it was a figur e. And from this a name was afterwards drawn, which at times, and p roba bly at first, was the voi ce of the animal. The earliest formation of hum an society which can be distingui shed from the gregarious hor de with its general prom iscuity of intercour se between the sexes is now beginni ng to be know n by the name of Totemism, a word onl y heard the other day. Yet not hing later 51 than the Totemic stage of Sociology is funda mental enough as ground to go upon in discussing Sign - langua ge, Mythol ogy, and Fetishism, or in tracing the root lets of religion; and the study of the subj ect has but just com menced. It had been om itted, with all its correlates and implications , from previous cons ideration and teachings conc erning the prehistoric past and present status of the scattered hum an family. On this line of research the inqui ries an d expl orations which go back to this tangi ble beginning are now the onl y profitable studi es. The results of these alone can be permanent. All the rest were tentative and transitory. But “No satisfactory expl anation of the origin of Totemism has yet been gi ven.” So says the writer of a book on the subj ect. (Frazer, J. G., “Totemism.”) The author of “Primitive Marriage,” who first mooted the subj ect in Engl and, coul d make not hing of it in the end. According to his brother, in a preface to “The Patriarchate” McLenna n gave up his hypot hesis and ceased to have any definite view at all on the origin of Totemism. Nevertheless, McLenna n was right in his gue ss that the so - called “animal - worship of the Egyp tians was descende d from a system of Totems or Fetishes” (Bud ge, “The Gods of the Egypt ians,” vol. I, p. 29), though “Worship,” we protest again and again, is not the word to employ; in this conne ction it is but a modern count erfeit. The Totem, in its religious pha se, was as much the sign of the Godde ss or the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"God a s it had been of the Motherhood or Brotherhood. It was an image of the supe rhum an pow er. Thus the Mother - earth as giver of water was imaged by the fish or papyr us shoot . These, so to say, were Totems of the Nature pow ers. But when it came to “worship” it w as the pow ers that were the obj ects of supr eme regard, not the Totems by means of which the pow ers were represented; not the water - cow , the goos e, the fish, the shoot , but the Godde ss Apt, and the Gods Seb, Sebek - and Child - Horus. It is in the most primiti ve custom s that we must seek for the funda mental forms of rites and ceremoni es. It is in Totemism onl y that we can trace the natural genesis of various doc trines and dogm as that have survived to be looke d upon as a divine revelation especially vouc hsafed t o later times, in cons eque nce of their having been cont inued as religious Mysteries without the gui dance of the primitive Gnos is. The hum an past in its remoter range might be divided into two por tions for the pur pos e, and described as pre - Totemic and Tote mic. The first was naturally a state of prom iscuity more or less like that of the animals, when there were neither Totems, nor Law of Tabu, nor cove nant of blood, nor verbal means of distingui shing one person from anot her. The onl y know n representatives of this condi tion now living are the Pygm ies of the Central African Forests. By Totemism we mean the earliest formation of society in which the hum an group was first discreted from the gregarious hor de that grove lled toge ther previous ly in animal prom iscuity . The subject, how ever, has various aspects. The term has many meanings which have to be determined by their type s. Many years ago the present writer sought to show that Totemism, Mythol ogy, Fetishism, and the hierogl yphi c system did not originate in separ ate systems of thought and expr ession, as 52 any mode rn “ism” sets up for itself, but that these had a com mon root age in Sign - langua ge, of which they are various mode s or forms. Totemism originated in Sign - langua ge rather than in Sociology , the Signs bei ng afterwards appl ied for use in Sociology as they were in Mythol ogy and Fetishism. The name “Totem” is suppos ed to have originated in the langua ge of the North American Indi ans. The word Totem exists in the Ojibw ay langua ge for a sign, a sym bol , mark, or device of the group, Gens, or Tribe. The Rev. Peter Jone s, an Ojibw ay, spells the word “Tooda im.” Francis Assikinack, an Ottawa Indi an, rende rs it by Ododam . The Abbé Thavenet, quot ing from the Algonki n langua ge, gives nind Otem for “my tribe,” and kit Ote m for “thy tribe.” The root of the word as here rende red is Tem or Dem. The name and things thus denot ed are found to be uni versal for a group , a gathering, a collection, a total of persons , animals, hut s or hous es. The Magar Thum is the Phratry or Clan, o f which there were twelve altoge ther. The Attic tow nship was called a Dem. The Sanskrit Dama is the hom e; Greek Dom os, Latin Dom us, Sclavoni c Dom u, English Dom e. Itembe=the dom e is the roof in Niamwezi. In Zulu the Tum u is an assemblage. In Maori, the Tame ne is a collection of peopl e. Also the Tom a is a cemetery like the Scottish Tom , and the Tum uli where the dead were gathered toge ther. Tom o, in archaic Japanese, denot es a gathering of persons who are com panions . In Assyrian, likewise, the Timi are the com panions . As is usual in the present work, we turn to Egypt to see what the great Mother of Civilisation has to say conc erning the Tem and the Totem."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" Twm (Tom ) in Copt ic signi fied joining toge ther as in the Tem. The word “Tem” has various appl ications in E gypt ian. It signi fies Man, Manki nd, Mortals, also to uni te, be entire or perfect. Moreove r, it is a name for thos e who are created persons , as in making young men and young wom en in the Totemic ceremoni es, of which more hereafter. If ever the word “created ” coul d be properly appl ied to the Making of Men and to thos e who were groupe d toge ther, it is in Totemism.

The sign of Tem - t in the Hierogl yphi cs is the figure of a total com pos ed of two hal ves ; thus the Tem is one with the Total, and the Total com prised two halves at the very poi nt of bifurcation and dividing of the whol e into two; also of totalling a num ber into a whol e which com mences with a twofold unity. And when the yout hs of the Abor igines on the River Darling are made men of in the ceremoni es of pube rty – that is, when they are created Men – they are called Tum ba. (F. Bonne y.) It woul d seem as if the word “Tem” for the total in two halves had been carried by name as well as by natur e to the other side of the world, for two classes in St. George’s Sound are universally called Erinung and Tem. The whol e body of natives are divided into these two moieties. The distinctions , says Nind, are general, not tribal. They agree, how ever, with t he Arunt a division into two classes of the Chur inga at the head of the Totems which represent the sub - divisiona l distinctions . (Scott Nind, Jour nal of Royal Geogr aphi cal Soc iety, vol . I, 1832. ) The Egypt ian Tem is also a place - name as well as a persona l na me for the social uni t, or division of persons . The Temai was a District, a Village, a Fortress, 53 a Tow n or a City, on the way to becom ing the Dom, as we have it in the heirdom and the kingdom , for the whol e or total that is gove rned by a King. But the group - name for peopl e preceded the group - name for a collection of dw ellings , whether for the living or the dead. Here the “Tem” is a total, as we have it in Engl ish for a “team” of hor ses, a brood of duc ks, a litter of pigs. Egyp t itself had passed out of the Totemic stage of Sociology in monu mental times, but the evidences for its prehistoric existence are visibly extant in the place - names and in the mirror of Mythol ogy which reflects aloft a pre - monum ental past of illimitable lengt h. In Egypt the Zoot ype s of the Motherhoods and Com panions hips had becom e the Totems of the Nom es. Thus we find the Nom e of the Cow ; the Nom e of the Tree; the Nom e of the Hare; the Nom e of the Gazelle; the Nom e of the Serpent; the Nom e of the Ibis; Nom e of the Crocodi le; Nom e of the Jackal; Nom e of the Siluris; Nom e of the Calf; and others. These show the cont inui ty of Totemic Signs . Also the status of Totemic Sociology survived in Egypt when the Artizans and Labour ers worked toge ther as the Com panions in Com panies; the Workm en i n the Temple and the Necropol is were the Com panions ; the Row ers of a Ship were a Com pany like the Seven Ari or “Com panions ” on boa rd the bark in the Mythical representation. These com panions are the Ari by name, and the Totemic Ari can be traced by name to Uppe r Egypt , where Ariu, the land of the Ari, is a name of the seventeenth Nom e. (Brugs ch.) At a remote period Egypt was divided into com muni ties the members of which claimed to be of one family, and of the same seed — which, unde r the Matriarchate, signi fi es the same Mother - blood, and denot es the same mode of derivation on a more extende d scale."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" So ancient was Totemism in Egyp t that the Totems of the hum an Mothers had becom e the signs of Godde sses, in whom the head of the beast was blende d with the figur e of the hum an female. The Totems of the human Mothers had attained the highe st status as Totems of a Motherhood that was held to be divine, the Motherhood in Nature which was elemental in its origin. So ancient was Totemism in Egypt that the Tems were no lo nge r mere groups , clans, or brotherhoods of peopl e, or a collection of hut s like the Tembs of the Ugogo. The human groups had grow n and expa nde d unt il the primitive dw elling - places had becom e great cities, and the burial - mounds of still earlier cities; the zoot ype of the Motherhood and the Brotherhood had becom e the blazon of the kingdo m. If we take the City to be the Egypt ian Temai, the Lion was the Totem of the Temai in Leont opol is; the Hare was the Totem of the Temai in Unnut ; the Crocodi le was a Totem o f the Temai in Crocodi lopol is; the Cat in the Temai of Pi - Bast (Buba stes); the Wolf was the Totem of Lycopol is; the Water - Cow of Teb; the Oxyr hync hus of Pi - Maza; the Apis of Ni - ent - Hapi; the Ibis of Hermopol is; the Bull of Mende s; the Eel of Latopol is; the dog - headed Ape of Cynopol is. When Egypt com es into sight , the Tems have grow n into the Temais and the Totems into the signs of Nom es, and she has left us the means of expl aining all that proceeded in the cour se of her long developm ent from the state of p rimitive Totemism in Africa: the state which more or less survives amongst the least cultured or most 54 decadent races that have scattered themselves and sow n the Kamite Wisdom which they carried as they crawled about the world; and, as the evidence sho ws, when this identifiable Wisdom of the Ancient Motherhood was first carried forth from Egypt , she was in the most ancient Totemic stage of Sociology. The “Tem,” then, in the last analysis, as Egypt ian, is a Totality in two halves, also a total of “Create d Persons ,” that is, of thos e who were cons tituted Persons or com panions in the Tem or Group by means of the Totemic Rite. In other langua ges the Tem, Deme, or Timi are the Group , or Brotherhood. And in the langua ges of the Red Men, the Doda m, Otem, or Odo dem is the symbol of the group of Brotherhood or Motherhoo d, who were know n by their Totem. Totemism really originated in the Sign - langua ge of Inne r Africa. Som e thirty different Totems have been enum erated as still extant amongst the natives of Uganda and Unyor o, and each Totem is conne cted with a birthpl ace or place of origin for the family in relation to the Elemental Ancestry (Johns tone ), which is the same as with the Arunt a in Australia. But a great mistake has hitherto been made in supp osing that a si gn called the Totem had its origin in Sociology . The primitive type now generalized unde r the name of “the Totem” was employe d for various purpos es as a factor in Sign - langua ge. It might be persona l, sexua l, sociologi cal or religious . It might be the sign of legal sanction, or a type of Tabu. It might identify the hum an Mother or the supe rhum an pow er that was invoke d for water, for food and shelter as the Mother - earth. Since the brief jottings on “Totemism” were made in the “Natural Genesis” (section 2) mu ch water has passed beneath the bridge . A flood of light has been pour ed out on the subj ect by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen in their inva luable work on the Native Tribes of Central Australia. The Wisdom of the Egyp tians is suppl emented most helpfully by the traditions of the Arunt a. The Gods and Godde sses may have been"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"relegated to the “Alcheringa ,” but much of the primitive matter has been preserved at a stands till which had been transfigur ed by cont inua l grow th in Egyp t. It is show n by the Arunt a and other Australian tribes that certain Totemic districts were identified by or with the food they produc e, as the district of the Kanga roos , the district of the Emus, or the district of the Witchetty - Grubs . The Arunta tribes are distribut ed in a large num ber of sm all local groups , each of which is suppos ed to possess a given area of count ry, and therefore of the food grow n in it. Generally the group describe themselves by the name of som e animal, bird, or plant. One area belongs to the group who call themselves Kan garoo - Men; anot her belongs to the Emu - Men; anot her to the Hakea - flow er - Men; anot her to the peopl e of the Plum - tree. (N.T., pp. 8 - 9.) The tribal area of the Australian Euahlayi is likewise divided into hunt ing - grounds in relation to food . According to Sir G eorge Grey, the natives say that the Ballaroke family derived their name from the Ballaroke , a small opos sum , on account of their having subs isted on this little animal; and of the Nag - Karm Totem he tells us the Nagarnook family obt ained their name from li ving principally in former times upon this fish. These, then, were food - totems. So likewise are the Witchetty - Grub, the Kanga roo, and the 55 Emu of the Arunt a groups . Scott Nind also tells us that the tribes of the Torndirrup and Monc alon classes are in a measure named from the kind of game or food found most abunda nt in the district ( Jour nal of Royal Geogr aphi cal Soc iety, 1832 ), which is the same as saying that the members of the Emu - totem were named from the Emu - bird, or the Kanga roos from the Kanga roo - animal, naming from food being sub - divisiona l and later than the descent from the Tree and Rock or the Chur inga of the two primary classes. The most impor tant ceremoni es of the Arunt a are performed for the sake of food , that is for increasing the suppl y of the plant, animal, bird, or insect which is the Totem of the particular group that enacts the rite and makes the magical appe al. The Emus perform, propi tiate, and plead for abunda nce of Emus. The Witchetty - Grub peopl e ask for plenty of Beetles. These not only eat their Totem, they are also its protectors. The Totem was eaten ceremoni ally as a type of the food that was asked for, with its likeness drawn upon the ground in the blood of the brotherhood. It is obvi ous that bot h in Australia and Inne r Africa t he primitive Totemic mappi ng - out include s that of food - districts, and that the special food of certain districts was represented by the Totem of the family or tribe. At the time of the 6th Egypt ian Dyna sty one family branch of the Hermopol itan princes ow ne d or pos sessed the Nom e of the Hare whilst anot her gove rned the Nom e of the Gazelle. (Maspero, “Dawn of Civilisation, ” Eng. tr., p. 523. ) These in the primitive stage woul d be the food - districts of the totemic Hares and Gazelles, and this status has been p reserved in Australian Totemism with the ow nership retained by the group. The totemic origin of the zoot ype s assigne d to the Egypt ian Nom es is show n when the animals were not to be eaten as com mon food. As Plutarch says, the inha bitants of the Oxyr hync hus Nom e did not eat a kind of Sturgeon know n as the Oxyr hync hus . (Of Isis and Osiris, p. 7.) Also, the peopl e of Crocodi lopol is woul d not eat the flesh of the Crocodi le. The not ions of Totemism previous ly entertained have been ups et by the new evidence from Australia, which tends to prove that the Totem was first of all eaten"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"by the members of the group as their ow n especial food. Hence they were appoi nted its preservers and cultivators, and were named after it. According to the present interpretation, the To tem primarily represented the maternal ancestor, the mother who gave herself for food and was eaten, and who as the mythical Great Mother in Egypt was the Godde ss Hathor in the Tree; the suckler as Rerit the Sow , the Nurse as Rannut the Serpent, the encein te Mother as Apt, who was fleshified for eating as the totemic Cow . The obj ect of certain sacred ceremoni es associated with the Totems is to secure the increase of the animal or plant which gives its name to the Totem. Each totemic group has its ow n ceremo ny and no two of them are alike, but how ever they may differ in detail the most impor tant poi nt is that one and all have for their main obj ect the pur pos e of increasing the suppl y of food; not food in general, but the particular food that is figur ed by the ir Totem. For example, the men of the Emu - totem perform their special ceremony and pour out the obl ation of blood in soliciting plenty of Emu. There can be no mistake in the kind of food that is pious ly besought , as a likeness of the Emu - bird is por trayed on the ground in the blood 56 of the tribe to indi cate the Pow er that is appe aled to. Thus , in the very dawn of ow nership by the group , when prope rty was com mon and not several, the Totem woul d be a sign of that which came to be called prope rty as the sp ecial food of the totemic family or clan. A group of totemic Kanga roos woul d be the ow ners and eaters of the Kanga roo in their locality. A group of totemic Emus woul d be the owners and eaters of the Emu. Thos e whos e Totem was the Tree woul d eat the fruit o f the Tree, a Totem being the veritable image of the food. The wom en of the Grass - seed Totem fed upon the Grass - seed in the Alcheringa . The wom en of the Hakea - totem always fed upon the Hakea - flow er in the Alcheringa . After the men of the Witchetty - Grub hav e performed the Intichium a ceremony for increase of food, the Grub becom es Tabu to the members of the Totem, and must on no account be eaten by them unt il the animal is abunda nt and the young are fully grow n. If this rule shoul d be broke n it woul d nul lify the effect of the ceremony. (N.T., p. 203. ) If the Witchetty - Grub men were to eat too much of their Totem, the pow er of performing the ceremony for plenty woul d depart. At the same time, if they were not to eat a little of the totemic animal it woul d have the same effect as eating too much. Hence the sacred dut y of tasting it at certain times. The peopl e of the Emu - totem very rarely eat the eggs . If an Emu - man who was very hungr y found a nest of eggs he woul d eat but one . The flesh of the bird may be eaten sparingl y, and only a very little of the fat, eggs and fat being more tabu than the meat. “The same principle hol ds good through all the totems. A carpet - snake man will eat sparingl y of a poor snake, but he will scarcely touc h the reptile if it be fat.” (N .T., p. 202. ) That was left, like the finest grain, for seed. So the members of the Irriakura - totem do not eat their Totem for som e time after the ceremony of Intichium a. The man of the Idni mita - totem, a large long - hor ned beetle, may not eat the grub after Intichium a unt il it becom es abunda nt. It is the same with the men of the Bandi coot Totem. But when the animal becom es plentiful, thos e who do not belong to the Totem go out in search of one , which when caught is killed and som e of the fat put into the mou th of the Bandi coot - men, who may then eat a little of the animal. (Pp. 204 - 7.) Again, the Arunt a have a custom or ceremony in which the members of any local group"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"bring in stores of the totemic plant or animal to their men’s camp and place them before the members of the totem. Thus , as Messrs. Spencer and Gillen remark, “clearly recogni zing that it is these men who have the first right of eating it” (p. 210 ), because it was their Totem. In this social aspect, then, Totemism was a means of regul ating the dis tribut ion of food , and in all likelihood it must have include d a system of exchange and barter that came to be practised by the family groups. In this pha se the Totem was a figur e of the especial kind of food that was cultivated and sought to be increased by the magical ceremoni es of the group. If we were to generalize, we shoul d say that in the beginni ng the “food” represented by the Totem, whether animal or vegetable, was bot h cultivated or cared for, and eaten by the members of that Totem. In scarcity, i t was eaten less and less, and was more and more prohi bited to the brotherhood, for social, religious or ceremoni al reasons , and that this was certainly one of the origins in Totemism. The Totem as food may 57 partly expl ain the totemic life - tie when the hum an brother is taught to take care of the animal and told to protect it because his life is bou nd up with the animal’s so closely that if it dies he too must die. Totemism, how ever, doe s not imply any worship of animals on the part of primitive men. It is the sheerest fallacy to suppos e that the most unde velope d abor igines began to worship, say, fifty beasts, reptiles, insects, birds, or shrubs , because each in som e way or measure fulfilled one of fifty different conc eptions of a divinity that was recog nized beneath its half - hund red masks. Moreover, if primitive men had begun by worshippi ng beasts and hol ding their deadliest foes religious ly sacred as their dearest friends ; if they had not fough t with them for very existence inch by inch, every foot of t he way, to conque r them at last, they never coul d have attained supr emacy ove r their natural enemies of the animal world. It woul d be goi ng against all know n natural tende ncy for us to imagine that hum an nature in the early stage of Totemic sociology was c onf used with that of the low er animals. The very earliest ope ration of the cons cious ness which discreted the creature with a thum b from thos e who were falling behind him on four feet was by distingui shing himself from his predecessors: and the degree of di fference onc e drawn, the mental landm ark onc e laid dow n, must have broadened with every step of his adva nce. His recogni tion of himself depende d on his perceiving his unl ikeness to them, and it can be show n how the beasts, birds, reptiles, and fishes were first adopt ed as zoot ype s on account of their supe rhum an and supe rior pow er in relation to the various elements, and therefore because of their unl ikeness to the nature of the human being. The ancestral animal then is neither an ideal nor imaginary being a s a primitive parent suppos ed to have been a beast, or a bird, a plant, or a star, any more than the first female as head of the Gaelic Clan Chattan was a great cat, or was believed to be a Great Cat, by the brothers in the Clan Sutherland. How ever ancien t the mythical mode of representing external nature, som e sort of sociology must have preceded mythol ogy and been expr essed in Sign - langua ge. Actuality was earlier than typol ogy. Thus amongs t the American Indi ans we find that Earth, Water, Wind, Sun, and R ain are Totems, without being, as it were, put into type by mythol ogy. This, which can be paralleled in Africa and Australia, poi nts to a beginni ng"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"with the elements of life themselves as the obj ects of recogni tion which preceded the zoot ype s; the elements of water, earth, air, and vegetation. It need scarcely be re - asserted that Totemism was a primitive means of distingui shing the offspring of one Mother from the offspring of the other; the children of the Tree from the children of the Rock, the hippopot am i from the crocodi les, the serpents from the swine. The earliest sociology touc hes on prom iscuity at the poi nt of departure from the hum an horde when the Mother was the onl y parent know n. The Mother com es first, and from that poi nt of departure the Egypt ia n representation reflects the sociology in the Mirror of the Mythos . In the pre - Totemic stage, there was one Mother as head of the family. This is repeated in Egypt ian Mythol ogy. In Totemism the Motherhood is divided between two sisters, or a Mother and an elder sister. This 58 is repeated in Egyp tian mythol ogy . In Totemism the dua l Motherhood is follow ed by the brotherhoods . This is repeated in Egypt ian Mythol ogy, beginni ng with the Twin - Brothers Sut and Horus, or the Black Vulture and the Golden Hawk, w hich are equa ted by, or cont inue d as, the Crow and Eagle - Hawk of Karween and Pundj el in Australia. In Totemism the two Brothers are follow ed by four or six in a group , and these are cons orts of the sisters in group - marriage. So is it in the Egyptian Mythos . In this way Mythol ogy will lend its search - light to show the backw ard path of prehistoric Totemism. At a very early stage the boys became the Cons orts of the Mother. When of age they woul d enter into connubi um with her, the eldest being first. Incest at the time was naturally unknow n, it being the same with them as with the animals. This status is reflected in the Mirror of Mythol ogy. For example, there is evidence that the eldest Son was the earliest representative or out line of a Father and that he coh abited with his ow n Mother on pur pos e to keep pur e the Mother - blood . This is an African institution. The que ens of Cape Gonz alves and Gaboon are accustom ed to marry their eldest Sons as a means of preserving pur e the roya l blood . It was a very stringe nt la w and custom with the Yncas of Peru that the heir to the kingdom shoul d marry his eldest sister. (Bastian, Der Mensch in der Geschichte, vol . III, p. 293; Wearne, S., Jour ney to the Northern Ocean, p. 136. ) This custom also is reflected in Egypt ian Mythol o gy. Inde ed, so perfectly have the prehistoric sociologi cal condi tions been preserved by the Egyp tians in their Mythical rende ring of the natural fact that the very beginni ng in heaven is with the first departure from utter prom iscuity as it was on earth. T he Genetrix as typi cal Wom an is bot h Mother and Cons ort to her ow n Children. Hence Apt, the old first Mother of Gods and Men, was called the “Great Mother of him who is married to his Mother.” That is, of Horus as the Crocodi le - headed Sebek. Sut, the male Hippopot amus, was also bot h Son and Cons ort of the same first Mother. As Hor - Apol lo says, “when the male Hippopot amus arrives at its prime of life it cons orts with its ow n Mother.” This was the status of Sebek - Horus, who was termed the hus band of his Mothe r. The earliest pow ers bor n of the Earth - mother were thought of as fecunda ting her in utero; Sut as the Hippopot amus, Sebek as the Crocodi le, Shu as the Lion, Elder Horus as the Child. The tradition of the sons who cons orted with the Mother is to be detect ed in the story told of Mars by Herodot us (B. II, 64) . He describes an Egypt ian festival which the priests informed him was instituted to celebrate or com memorate the ravishing of his Mother by the God Mars. Now Mars, in"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Egypt , is the warrior Shu, who was one of the sons that coha bited with the Mother. Thus Sut, Horus, and Shu are all three described in this pre - Totemic character. There were seven altoge ther of these Sons who were Cons orts of the Mother in Mythol ogy , and who reappe ar with the Old Harlot and partake of her cup of fornication in the Book of Revelation. At a later time bot h Sut and Horus were denounc ed as “Violators of their Mother.” When Isis uttered the cry of “No Crocodi le,” Horus had violated his Mother, and it was the Mother who effected t he “Act of Salvation” by refusing the incestuous intercour se of Son and Mother, whether of the uterine Son or onl y of 59 the same Totem, which in this case was the Crocodi le. ( Magi c Papy rus, p. 7.) With Sut as Violator, it was the Hippopot amus; with Horu s the Crocodi le, with Shu the Lion. Thus , in the mirror of Egypt ian Mythol ogy hum an prom iscuity is reflected when the Great Mother’s ow n Sons are her Cons orts. Polyandr y is represented when brothers and sisters coupl e toge ther, as did Shu and Tefnut . The A frican marriage of one male with two sisters is reflected in the mythos where Osiris is the cons ort of Isis and Nepht hys . If we take the word “Totem” to indi cate a sign, the earliest sign or sym bol to be identified in Totemism was related to the fact of f eminine pube scence. This was the Word that issued out of silence in the Beginni ng. The earliest law of cove nant or tabu was based upon the transformation that occurred at the time when the girl became a wom an ready for connubi um . This was the mystery of a transformation that was a primal sour ce of all the transformations in the folk - tales of the world. The girl became a wom an as a natural fact. This had to be expr essed in the visible langua ge already drawn from external nature. We are told by Theale, the Ca pe historian, that the onl y festival celebrated by the Zulu - Kaffirs to - day is one that is kept when the girl becom es pube scent. This, was inde ed the mother of mystery, the mystery of all mysteries ever solemnized or celebrated by the peopl e of the past. It was a time of rejoicing because the girl had com e of age and was now ready to be welcom ed into com muna l connubi um by the whol e group of grow n - up males. When the female had attained pube scence and becom e of age the ope ning period, as it is com monl y designa ted, was proclaimed, and conf irmation given in various mode s of Sign - langua ge. The fact was tattooe d on the person. A cicatrice was raised in the flesh. Dow n was exhi bited as a sign of the pube s. The Zulu wom en publ ished their news with the Um - lom o or myst ical mout h - piece. The act may be read on behalf of the wom en by assum ing the ope ration to have been female from the first, and then passed on to the boys . The girl in her initiation joins the ranks of the Motherhood. She has attained her ope ning period. Th e toot h is knoc ked out to visualize the ope ning. One of the signs of readiness show n by the Arunt a wom en was the erection of the sacred Pole immediately after the ceremony of introcision had been performed. A Purulu wom an of the Achilpa Totem (in the mythi cal past) is said to have had a large Nurtunj a. This when erected stood so high as to be seen by the men a long way off. The wom an show ed her Undat tha or dow n (typi cal of the pube s and pubescence) and the men performed the rite upon her, and then they all had intercour se with her. (N.T., p. 407 .) The special fact then signi fied by the raising of her Nurtunj a, or sacred pol e, was that her wom anhood was now accom plished. This may expl ain why no Nurtunj a is used but onc e, a fresh one"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"being made for every cerem ony . Also why Chur inga were hung upon the pol e to intimate her Totem. The name for a Totem (in Luga nda ) is Muziro, which signi fies som ething tabooe d: “som ething I avoi d for medical or other reasons .” This tends to identify the Totem in one of its aspects as a teacher of Tabu in relation to the primitive mystery of female nature. The fact is that the Sign - langua ge of Totemism was in existence long before two groups of peopl e were distingui shed from each other 60 by two different signs or zoot ype s. Sign - l angua ge is far older than any form of Totemic sociology. The signs now know n as Totemic were previous ly extant; they had served other uses, and were cont inue d for other pur pos es. The very first thing to regul ate in primitive marriage was the time at which the pube scent girl was marriageable. This was determined primarily by nature and secondl y by the preparatory rite. As show n by the Australian custom s, no girl was marriageable unt il the rite of introcision had been performed upon her person. Her Totem foll ow ed the Totemic rite as her heraldic badge . Thus a first division was made to indi cate the fit and protect the unf it from savage assault, when the Totem was indi vidua l and feminine. So in the mysteries of Artemis no young wom an was cons idered marriageable unt il she had danced in the bear - skin at the Mysteries; the Bear - skin that sym bol ized the pube s or pube scence, as did the dow n of birds or the skin of the serpent. The natural raison d’être, the primary need for the Totem, was in its being a sign of femin ine pube scence. In a state of sexua l prom iscuity the first thing to be determined was the Mother - blood. This was manifested at the period of pube rty, and the Totem was adopt ed as the sym bol of motherhood. The manifestor was now a frog, a serpent, a she - bea r, or as we say, a Wom an, to be distingui shed by her Totem. The Totem then was the sign of “Earth’s first blood” on this most primitive natural ground . When the Australian black described the Chur inga - like sacred stone s of New Sout h Wales as “All same as b loody brand,” he meant the blood - brand, or Totemic mark, and thus identified the Mother - Totem with the Mother - blood. The different motherhoods were recogni zed as different Mother - bloods which were visibly discriminated by the different Mother - Totems. The r ecogni tion of the Mother - blood, even in the undi vided hor de, woul d naturally lead to the Blood - motherhood which we pos tulate as funda mental in Totemism. At first no barrier of blood was recogni zed. The brothers and sisters of the same mother intermarried, although they were, or because they were originally, of the same one blood . When the nations of the earth were all of one blood it was the blood of the Mother, who in her mystical aspect is the Virgin - Mother of the Mythos and the Eschatology. On entering t he ranks of the motherhood the girl assum ed her sign which signi fied that she was now a wom an. In being made Totemic she was recogni zed by her zoot ype — that is, by the reptile, beast, or bird of the Totem into which she had first made her transformation at the time of pube rty. In various legends it was said that in making this transformation the young wom en were change d into beasts. Once on a time a young girl in Arcadia transformed into an animal. It is com mon in the folk - tales for the female to change into a hye na, a tigress, a serpent, a lione ss, or som e other beast or reptile. It was the same with the Zulu - Kaffir girl who became a frog. When"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"her change occurred she was no longe r a tadpol e of a girl, but a full - blow n frog, and in the hum an sense a wom an. T he beginni ngs were very low ly in Sign - langua ge. It had been awesom ely remarked that the serpent had the faculty of sloughi ng its skin and renewing itself. Hence it is said by the Kaffirs that when the girl makes her change 61 she is visited by the great serpent, or, in other legends , she is said to change into a serpent. In the Arunt a tradition the two females who are the founde rs of Totemism and finishers of the hum an race made their transformation into the lizard. (N.T., p. 389. ) The native wom en of Mas hona land also tattoo themselves with the lizard - pattern that is found on their divining tablets when they com e of age. (Bent., p. 305 .) Thus the lizard in one instance, the serpent in anot her, the frog in a third, is the type of beast or reptile into which the young wom an is said to transform at the particular period. Hence the lizard, frog, and serpent remain as fetishes with the abor igines. Both lizard and frog were cont inue d in Egyp t, but the serpent there attained supr emacy. At the com ing of age the gir l change d into a lizard, a frog, or a serpent as a mode of indi cating her status as a wom an, whether in nature or in Totemism. Thus three different type s, the lizard, frog, and serpent, are identified as figur es of the fact in nature, with the “beast” or r eptile into which the young girl made her transformation in the mysteries of motherhood which formed the moul d of other later mysteries in Totemism and mythol ogy; the type s of which were worn by the Godde sses as well as by the Egypt ian wom en. The amulet of Isis which she tied round her neck when she had conc eived Child - Horus corresponde d to the Totemic sign of the pube scent Virgin. It was of blood - red stone and it imaged the blood of Isis. (Plutarch, c. 65. ) The girl was change d into the wom an at the time o f pube rty, therefore the Totem was a type of motherhood . In a sense it was the Crow n of Maternity which in Egyp t was represented by the serpent of renewal. In attaining this type the girl became a lizard or the Zulu maiden was said to be visited by the gre at serpent. The serpent that visited the Kaffir maiden was also a Totem of the Virgin - godde ss Rannut , in the Kamite mythos , and this was doubl ed to be worn by the Egypt ian Queens as the sym bol of Maternity or a Totem of the dua l Motherhood, in the characte rs of Girl and Wom an, Maid and Mother, Virgin and Gestator. We may now affirm that Totemism was founde d on the nature of the female as a mode of show ing when the maiden might be adm itted into the ranks of Motherhood, and the young girl made her transformat ion into the animal and became a frog, a lizard, serpent, crocodi le, bear, lione ss, cat or other zoot ype as the bringe r - forth of hum an offspring in the mask. Which animal was represented woul d depend upon the Totem of the Motherhood or the Group of Males. And here it may be asserted that for the first time we touc h anot her of the several tap - root s of Totemism. The Totem has som etimes been called the “original Ancestor,” as if it were a representative of the hum an Father. But the sole original Ancestor in s ociology, in Totemism, in mythol ogy , is the Mother; and the female Totems of the Motherhood on earth were repeated as the Totems of the Mother in heaven, or in the Astronom ical Mythol ogy. One obj ect of the Totem being worn in the form of the Skin, the badg e of tattoo, or the crest, was to signi fy the “blood” which coul d onl y be determined by the Motherhood, so that the children of the same Totem coul d or shoul d not intermarry"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"because they were or were not of one blood . It follow s, therefore, that the earlie st Totems must have signi fied the Mother as a means of identifying the one 62 blood of her children. Descent from the Mother, identified by her Totem, is indi cated from one end of Africa to the other, when the Egyptian Pharaoh wears the tail of the Cow , the Kaffir chief or Bushm an the tail of the Lione ss, and the Hottentot is the Son of the yellow Lion - tail. So is it in the Egypt ian Mythol ogy where, the priority of the Mother - Totem is well exemplified. Shu is also a Son of the Lion - tail, the She - Lion, and he carries the Ur - Heka or Great Magical Pow er on his head. This is the hinde r - part of the Lione ss; and the tail of a Lione ss on his head denotes the Lione ss as a Mother - Totem from which the child traces his descent as a lion. The earliest hum an being indi vidua lized was necessarily the Mother. She and her children formed the primal family, whos e tie was that of Blood - Motherhood , a tie that must have been already com mon with the horde in pre - Totemic times, the one blood of Motherhoo d being the original sour c e of all Blood - Brotherhood. The primary form of hum an persona lity ( personâ ) was that attained by wom an unde r the Matriarchate as the Mother. Fortuna tely Provi dence placed the Mother first and secured her on the side of procreant nature, for the perpetuatio n of the race. It has been cast up against Wom an that she is Mother first and Cons ort afterwards, and that the Maternal instinct reigns supr eme. But Wom an was the Mother ages earlier than she coul d be the wife. The Mother had the start by many thous and yea rs. The child was know n as hers from the beginni ng. The hus band was not . Her func tion was that of breeder for the group and bearer for the Tribe, and not for love of the indi vidua l. She fulfilled the Ideal of Primitive Man as the Wom an of infinite capacity , like the Lione ss, Hippopot amus, or other huge Titanic type of supe rhum an pow er and size. She may have had her indi vidua l likes and dislikes, but was grimly gove rned in the grasp of stern Totemic Law. It was perforce her duty to provi de pasturage for “for ty feeding as one ,” or the whol e tribe, not to cultivate her ow n persona l preferences. The Mother necessarily grew predom inant in the dua lity of her nature. And still the nob lest nature yet evol ved is hers whos e desire for maternity is dua l, and who blends most perfectly the love of the Mother and Wife in one . The solution of the probl em now propounde d is that the secret of the Totemic Sphi nx, in its ultimate secrecy, originated with the Totem being first of all a sign of feminine pube scence, and a persona l means of making know n the natural fact; that it thus became a blazon of the Mother - blood and primal family group; which tends to corrobor ate the sugge stion now sought to be established that the Totem was a figure of the female from the beginni ng, and tha t this was follow ed by a long and manifold developm ent in the appl ication of the Sign to the Motherhoods and Brotherhoods , and to the intermarriage of the groups now called Totemic. There are two classes of tradition derived from Totemism conc erning the d escent of the hum an race. According to one , hum an beings were derived from the Totemic animals, or Birds, as the Haidahs in Queen Charlotte Sound claim descent from the Cow . According to the other, the Totemic zoot ype s are said to have been brought forth b y hum an mothers. The Bakalai tribes of Equatorial Africa told Du Chaillu that their wom en gav e birth to the Totemic ani mals, we have"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 seen how , and that one wom an brough t forth a Calf, others a Crocodi le, a Hippopot amus, a Monke y, a Boa, or a Boar. (Du Chaillu, Explorations and Adventures in Equat orial Africa, p. 308 .) The same statement as this of the Bakalai is made by the Moqui Indi ans, who affirm that the peopl e of their Snake - Clan are descende d from a wom an who gave birth to Snakes. (Bour ke, Snak e - danc e of the Moqu is, p. 177. ) In various savage myths we have seen how the animals are descende d from hum an mothers. This is a com plete reversal of the suppos ed belief that the hum an race is descende d from beasts, birds, reptiles, and all the other Totemic type s, and tends to show that the primary Totems were representatives of the Mothers, whence the alleged descent of the Totemic animals from hum an originals which of necessity were female; when the Wom en as the author s of Totemism brought forth the type s. Because the Mother was the primal persona lity it follow ed that the earliest hum an group was a Motherhood. The Clan at first was Matriarchal. This is still extant in the Oraon Maharis, which are the Motherhoods by name. (Dalton, Ethnol ogy of Bengal , p. 63. ) When there was no indi vidua l fatherhood yet determinable, descent was in the female line, from the Mother to the Eldest Daught er. These became the typi cal “Two Wom en” in Totemism and the “Two Mothers” in Mythol ogy because they had been the Two Mothers in the primitive Sociology, as the Mother and the Eldest Daught er of the human family. The primary hum an group was naturally uterine. The family first formed were the children of one Mother, and the hum an pact or tie was founde d on the one blood of the Mothe r; the Blood - Motherhood which determined the Blood - Brotherhood. According to School craft, the Totems of the Algonqui ns denot e the Mothers. The Emu, which is also “The Wom an,” Ngalalbal, is a Mother - Totem of the Kurnai in Australia. When the Euahlayi tribe of Australia take their Totem - names from their Mothers, and are divided into two groups as the Light - bloode d and the Dark - bloode d, this indicates a twofold derivation from the one Mother - blood, whether pre - Totemic or Totemic. If we take the Bear as a Mothe r - Totem, we can unde rstand the Ainu of Japan when they say their earliest ancestor was suckled by a Bear. In that case the Totemic Mother was a She - Bear, and the fact was memorized when the Ainu wom en suckled the young Bear that was to be killed and solemn ly eaten at the annua l festival. Besides which, when the She - Bear was eaten in place of the hum an Mother the sex of the Totem was determined by her being inve sted with a necklace and ador ned with eardrops like a wom an. It is the same when the Snake - Clan o f Arizona claim descent from a Wom an who gave birth to Snakes. She was the Mother of that Totem and the Snakes were her children. But there was a Mother in Mythology who did give birth to the Totem - animals, and who is confused at times with the human Mothe rhood. This was the Mother - earth, who was represented by the snake as renewer of vegetation in the Godde ss Rannut . Egypt ian Mythol ogy is a mirror of Totemism from the beginni ng with the hum an Mother who was the primal parent. And as it was in Totemism so i s it in the Mythol ogy and Eschatology of Egypt . In the beginni ng was the Great Mother, because the first person recogni sed in Totemism was 64"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" the Mother. The Totemism of Egypt was the basis of all its Mythol ogy and Eschatology, but that stage of sociolog y was almost silted unde r and hidde n out of sight as one of the several strata of Egyp t’s bur ied past. The Indians who trace their descent from the Spirit - Mother and a Grizzly Bear acknow ledge that the Bear, like that of the Ainos , was a She - Bear, and cons eque ntly a Mother - Totem. The Tugas claimed descent from a She - Wolf, and the Tufans from a She - Dog. Descent from the Mother or in the female line was uni versally recogni zed by the abor igines. From this it follow s that the zoot ype s first represented the Moth erhoods ; and when the males came to the fore the same animal woul d serve two pur pos es. As female it would represent the motherhood; as male the brotherhood. A tribe of Indi ans still living in North - West America claim to have descende d from a Frog. If this was a Totem of the Motherhood, the descent woul d be the same as if it were from the Godde ss Hekat, onl y their sign is simple Frog, whereas the Frog had been elevated in status by becom ing an image of the Mother as Mistress Hekat, the Frogge ss who typi fied the Divine Mother in the transforming Moon. The divine Cow of the Toda s is an extant type of the Great Mother as the giver of food , equi valent to Hathor , the Egypt ian Venus , the Cow that protected her Son with her body , primarily when the Mother was a Wate r - Cow . The Toda Palal or High Priest obv ious ly persona tes the Divine Son, and is the dispenser of blessings to the world for the divine Motherhood that was represented by the Cow . No race on earth so ignor ant but that it has claimed descent from the Mothe r. And this hum an descent being the recogni zed fact in who coul d be, and was, identified as their ow n flesh and blood and breath, the Mother who gave visible birth to the hum an offspring, and no other, from the wom b, never coul d have claimed an actual desc ent from animals, reptiles, birds, trees, stone s and other obj ects, animate and inanimate. An Australian tribe cons idered themselves to have been Ducks who at one time were change d into Men. In that case the Duck woul d be a Totem of the Mother as the means of tracing their descent in the female line. When they became Men the descent woul d be reckone d from the Male Proge nitor. The Byga hs have a tradition that the foster - mother of the first Man was a Milch - Tigress, and therefore, as we show , a Mother - Totem. I n this statement the foster - mother is distingui shed from the hum an Mother and is identified by means of her Totem as the Tigress and Lione ss, or Sow or Water - Cow , or any other female zoot ype . The Hyena was a Mother - Totem of Inne r Africa. The Wanika in East Africa reverence this animal as ancestral. When a Hyena dies it is bewailed by the whol e peopl e. The mour ning for a chief is said to be not hing com pared with the death of a Hyena (New, Charles, Life and Wande rings , p. 122) , because, as we hol d, of its bei ng a maternal zoot ype . It is certain that the hippopot amus was a Mother - Totem with the natives of the Zambesi, who have now the greatest hor ror of touc hing its flesh. Livings tone ’s pilot woul d go without food rather than cook it in the same pot which had c ont ained any of the meat. (Livings tone , Zam besi. ) As Herodot us tells us, the first Mother of 65 the Scyths was a Serpent - wom an. With the Kings of Abys sinia the line of descent was traced from the Serpent, which was therefore a Mother - Totem. The process o f divinizing"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"the pow er by means of the type had begun in Africa beyond Egypt . The vul ture in Ashanti is the same sign of roya lty as with the Egyptians. In Coom assie, says Ellis, “vul tures are cons idered birds sacred to the Roya l Family. This is not in the same way as the leopa rd is to the leopa rd family; but rather that these birds have been despot ically declared to be sacred,” which means that they are exceptiona lly sacred by being the totem of the Roya l Family, or, as in Egypt , of roya l and divine Materni ty. Any molestation of this bird was puni shable with death. (Ellis, A. B., The Tshi - speaking Peopl e, p. 213. ) It is a Mother - Totem like the vulture of Neith, which was bot h roya l and divine, as the Bird of Blood, the Mother - blood, the roya l blood. The Mot her was the primal parent, and the Totem was a means of distingui shing one mother and one group of children from anot her before these were divided in the two classes of the Two Mothers. Single Motherhood was naturally know n to the gregarious hor de. Which m eans that the earliest Totems were type s of the female. This is show n in the Egypt ian Mythol ogy, that mirror of the Matriarchate. “Your Mother” kne w her children and they kne w their Mother. “My Mother” kne w her children, and they kne w their Mother. But wit hout som e permanent sign the children woul d go forth like the beasts from the lair and the birds from the nest, and even this one natural link of relations hip must have been lost in the undi stingui shable hor de. That sign was the Totem as the earliest mode and means of identifying the Mother and of memorizing the descent of the children upon any line of the original Matriarchate. The mother’s sign then was the Totem of her ow n children, male and female, differentiated by sex. “Your Mother” was know n by her T otem; “My Mother” by her Totem — to each other’s children. The Mother’s Totem was naturally recogni zed by her own children. If “Your Mother” was a Lione ss, the male offspring kne w themselves as her young Lions . If “My Mother” was a Hippopot amus, her children kne w themselves as Hippopot ami, or Bulls of the Cow if male. The Mother was always hum an beneath the Totemic mask which was needed, adopt ed, and worn to distingui sh one hum an mother from the rest, so that she coul d be identified by others who were not her children. Thus the first “Two Wom en,” the “My Mother” and “Your Mother” of the Kamilaroi, were recogni zed as the Emu and Igua na, and these became the Totems of their children. The Arunt a in their isolation have preserved som e relics of a primitive tradit ion of the pre - Totemic and pre - hum an state in what they term the “Alcheringa .” In this the mythical ancestors, the Noor alie, or Mura - Mura of other tribes, are suppos ed to have lived. At that time, or in that condi tion, not hing hum an had been evol ved, disti nct from other forms of life. As it is said, in thos e days there were neither men nor wom en, onl y rudi mentary creatures waiting to be humanized. The Alcheringa represents a mythical past which did not com mence with thos e who have no clue to the origins. It is a past that was inhe rited and never had any cont empor ary existence for them. These rudi mentary beings the Arunt a call “the Inapertwa, 66 or imperfect creatures.” We know what was meant by the term because it is still appl ied to the girls who have not been ope ned and the boy s who have not unde rgone the rite of circum cision or sub - incision. Such beings still remained the same as the Inapertwa creatures because they had not yet been made into men and wom en. The sexes were not"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"then divided at pube rty or, in other words, had not yet becom e Totemic. The Arunt a tradition tells us further that the change from the pre - hum an to hum an beings , and from the pre - Totemic to the Totemic status, was effected by Two Beings who were called the Unga mbikul a, a word which s igni fies “out of not hing” or “self - existing. ” Though these two are not designa ted Wom en, they are two females. There being no men or wom en in thos e days, onl y the rudi mentary Inapertwa, it was the work of the Unga mbikula to shape the Inapertwa creatures in to wom en and men, with their lalira, or great stone kni ves, made of qua rtzite. These Two Beings were the primitive creators of men and wom en from the undi stingui shable hor de of the imperfect Inapertwa as founde rs of Totemism (N.T., p. 388) , by means of the Totemic rites. They are said to have change d the Inapertwa into human beings belongi ng to six different Totems — (1) The Akakia, or Plum tree. (2) The Ingui tchika, or Grass - seed. (3) The Echunpa , or Large Lizard. (4) The Erliwatchera, or Small Lizard. (5) Th e Atninpi richina, or Parakeet. (6) The Untaina, or Small Rat. The Two Beings having done their work of cutting and carving which was to establish Totemism, then transformed themselves into lizards. Hence it was the lizard of Australian legend that was repu ted to have been the author of marriage, because the lizard was an emblem of the feminine period. It will be show n by degrees what the nature of these rudi mentary creatures was, and what is their relation to the hum an race and to Totemism. The same primev al tradition is to be found in the Manga ian myths of creation. In this the beings bor n of Vari - ma - te - takere, the originator of all things , the very - beginni ng, dw elt in the Mute - land at the bot tom of Avaiki. There was no verbal langua ge in this land of the Great Mother. You coul d not provoke an angr y answer there. The onl y langua ge know n in the Mute - land is said to be that of signs — “such as nods , elevated eyebrow s, grimaces, and smiles.” (Gill, p. 6.) “Avaiki is a land of strange utterance, Like the s ighs of a passing breeze; Where the dance is perfo rm ed in silence, And the gift of speech is unknown .” (N ative song). The Mother and Daught er of the Manga ian version take the place of the two female ancestresses in the Arunt a legend. Also, one na me of the daught er in anot her of the islands was Papa or Founda tion. In this also the six Totems are equa ted by six parts of Avaiki, the body of the Great Mother (Mother - earth), who is said to pluck off six por tions of her flesh, from the right and left si des of her body, with which to form her children. The tradition is one and uni versal with many variants. It is funda mentally the same in the mythol ogy of the Californian Indi ans, who tell us that at first their ancestors walked on all four s. Then they bega n to put forth som e members of the hum an body , such as a finge r or a toe, until they were perfected 67 like the Inapertwa when these were made into men and wom en. They missed their tails, which they lost as the result of having to sit up. It was a result of this derivation of the children from the mothers illustrated by means of Totemic zoot ype s that the abor igines in various Asiatic and Europe an count ries were despised and derided by later races as “The Men with Tails.” When the Burmese call the Karens “ Dog - men,” and the Airyas of Indi a"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"call the abor igines “Monke y - men” they are naming them derisively in accordance with the primitive Totemic status. Nothing is more com mon than for the later light er races to accredit the old dark races with the pos session o f tails, as a cont inua tion of the Totemic likeness. They were the beast men, or their descenda nts from the earlier Totemic times and status. The Kickapoos tell a hum orous story of their ancestors who onc e were in pos session of tails which they afterwards l ost. Then the impude nt frog woul d send every morning and ask them how they felt without their tails, much to the amusement of the bear, who used to listen and shake her fat sides with laught er at the joke . As the frog had likewise lost its tail in the proc ess of becom ing a frog from a tadpol e we may see in this the particular Totemic type of the Kickapoos that lost their tails. The tail or hinde r part is naturally a Mother - Totem. The tail of the lione ss carried on his head is the Mother - Totem of Shu. The Eg ypt ian kings were men with tails. They wore the tails of the lione ss and the cow , which were two forms or zoot ype s of the mythical mother, Neith the Milch - Cow (earlier, Apt, the Water Cow ) and Tefnut , the Lioness. Here the tails of the lione ss and cow were worn by the hum an lion or bul l who at one time spor ted his Mother - Totem in the shape of the typical animal’s tail. Various tribes on the Uppe r Nile are the wearers of artificial tails made of hair, straw, or fibre of hemp, in place of the earlier skin. On grand occasions the Egypt ian judge s and other digni taries wore the tails of jackals made of hor sehair. In Egypt ian sym bol ism the jackal represents the judge ; and the tail of horsehair still survives with us as the que ue of the judge ’s wig. The fox in Euro pe took the place of the jackal as the zoot ype of the lawyer, and this preserves the character of Anup, the jackal, as the sign of counc il and of cunni ng or wiseness on the part of thos e who “wear fur,” or the later silk. One supr eme and primary obj ect of Totemism was the preservation of the Mother - blood in aboriginal purity. This gave priority and unpa ralleled impor tance to maternal Totems like thos e of the Serpent and Vulture of the Mother which were sym bol s of roya l and divine maternity in Egypt . The mo st profoundl y primitive of all the ancient mysteries was that of the Mother - blood. At the same time it was the most profoundl y natural. By this mystery it was demons trated that blood was the basis of wom anhood , of motherhood, of childhood , and in shor t, of hum an existence. Hence the precious ness of the Mother - blood. Hence the custom s instituted for its preservation and the pur ity of racial descent. Only the mother coul d originate and preserve the nobi lity of lineage or roya lty of race. And the old dark race in general has not yet out lived the sanctity of the Mother - blood which was primordial, or the tabu - laws which were first made statutable by means of the Mother’s Totem. In the Egypt ian system of representation there are Seven Soul s 68 or life - forces re cogni zed in nature. Six of these were pre - hum an, elemental pow ers, bor n of the primary Great Mother when there was as yet no hum an soul distingui shed from the six that were the soul s, such as light , or air, earth, or water, and animal or vegetable life. Th e seventh soul alone was hum an. This was the soul of blood brough t forth by a Godde ss in the hum an likeness. The earliest soul cons idered to be hum an, the soul that was made flesh in the Child - Horus, was born of the Mother - blood, the blood of Isis, and, as such, was distingui shed from the earlier elemental pow ers, otherwise the six Totemic"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"and pre - hum an soul s. The Blood - Mother was imaged as the Virgin Neith who was represented in one pha se by the vul ture that was fabled, like the pelican, to pierce its thig h and give its offspring her ow n blood for nour ishm ent. (Hor - Apol lo, B. I, 11. ) This was as the conc eiver of a soul that was incarnated by the Blood - Mother. The blood that was cons idered to be the soul of life, in a series of seven soul s, is the blood of t he female — not the typi cal blood of the male; the blood of Isis, not the blood of Adam, Atum , or Belus; and it can be show n that the hum an race, distingui shed from the preliminary peopl e, originated in the Mother - blood . By this same means the Mother also at tained her supr emacy, the Matriarchate being based upon the Mother - blood that was to be so precious ly preserved and memorized. According to the Egypt ian wisdom , the salvation of the hum an race was effected by the blood of Isis. Salvation was perpetuation. Isis was the Virgin - Mother, and hers also was the Mother - blood. The blood of the Mother, who was primarily the Virgin, being the earliest recogni zed sour ce of human life, thence came the doc trine of a Virgin - Mother and the saving blood in the Eschatology. This Mother - blood originated with the Virgin at the time of pube rty. It passed into the racial Mother - blood in the pha se of fulfilment with marriage. The Virgin, represented in the Egypt ian Mystery, was the maiden who conc eived; in her second character she was the bringe r - forth. These Two Mothers were imaged by the doub le Uræus - crow n of Maternity. The mythical Virgin - Mother had a very natural origin. She represents the pube scent female who was the fount and sour ce in nature for the one original blood. The b lood of Isis was the Virgin - blood. She was the Mother of Life in the mythical representation, and in the first of two characters she is the Virgin - Mother, when her sister Nepht hys is the Bringe r - forth or Nurse of the child. The sacredne ss of the Virgin - blo od, the earliest Mother - blood, will help to account for the sanctity of the pre - pube scent virgins who were so carefully seclude d from the outer world at the time of its primary manifestation. Among the Ot - Danons of Borneo the pre - pube scent girl is som etime s shut up dur ing seven years awaiting her sign of the Virgin - Motherhood. This is bor n in blood, and she is cons eque ntly looke d upon as one newly bor n into life. She is led forth to breathe the air, and is show n the sun, the water, and the trees. Then the e vent is celebrated by the sacrifice of a slave, and her body is painted with his blood. This was the Blood - Mother as a Virgin, in the first of the two characters assigne d 69 to the female. Thus , the Two Wom en in Totemic Sociology were the Virgin and the Mother. It is the same in the Mythol ogy , and lastly in the Eschatology. The first of the Two was the pube scent Virgin who conc eives: the second is she who brings forth. Hence the doc trine of a Doubl e Motherhood. Ra is said to be uni ted to his “Doubl e Mothe r.” One of the Ptolemies claims to be the Belove d of the “Doubl e Divine Mother.” The Doubl e Mother was also the Doubl e Sister in anot her relations hip with Horus. “I am thy Doubl e Sister,” says Isis to Osiris. (P. Pierret, Panthéon Eg., 28.) In this dua lity Isis is the Blood - Mother and Nepht hys the Milch - Mother; hence she is called the Nurse. Isis is at onc e the Great Mother and also the Virgin - Mother who keeps the primary place in the Mythos because the Virgin preceded the bringe r forth of the child as sour ce itself. This doubl e Motherhood is also assigne d to Jesus in the Gospels with the Two Mothers as two sisters: the first being the Virgin Mary, the second, Mary the wife of Cleopa s."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" In mode rn times the blood in certain families is cons idered to be roya l, and roya l blood is the blood to be sacredly or very carefully preserved from any base adm ixture, although the origin of roya l blood is hitherto unknow n. Unde r the Matriarchate there coul d be no blood - roya l by derivation from the Male. There was but one bl ood, that of the Mother. It was impos sible at first for the males to transmit. There was but one means of descent for the race. This was the Mother - blood. Hence the primitive custom s for preserving it in pur ity and sanctity. The Mother - blood was not onl y k now n as the “one blood” of the race, it also denot ed the “one flesh” or one stock. Descent from the Mother connot ed the one blood or one flesh. It woul d be a way of preserving the Mother - blood in Totemism for the brother and sister of the sam e Totem to int ermarry; the same Totem being a determinative of the Motherhood , as the means of identifying the original Mother - blood. Messrs. Spencer and Gillen tell us that the Arunt a traditions poi nt to a time “in the Alcheringa ” when it was the normal condi tion for t he male to coha bit with a wom an of the same Totem as his ow n. The evidence poi nts back to a time when the brother and sister of the same Totem always married each other. It was long sought to keep the Mother - blood intact by the intermarriage of the uterine brothers and sisters. These used to coha bit, and such intercourse was at one time cons idered to be not onl y natural and prope r, but was esteemed as preferable. The Kalangs of Java are what is now termed Endoga mous , and when a girl is asked in marriage the man “must prove his descent from their peculiar stock.” That is originally the one stock of the Mother - blood. Peopl e of this stock were know n both in Africa and Australia as the one - legge d peopl e, thos e who were the undi vided primitive Endoga mists. Prolon ged efforts were made by the “Endoga mists” to preserve the Mother - blood or the “one flesh,” as it was called by the abor igines of Victoria, who say of a man that takes a wom an of his ow n group to wife, he has “ fallen into the same flesh.” (Dawson, Australi an Abor igines, p. 28. ) It was a custom long cont inue d by the Egypt ians to preserve the Mother - blood by the marriage of the brother and sister, a custom that was sacred to the Roya l family, thus show ing that the Mother - 70 blood transmitted by the elder s ister was the Roya l blood. The Goajiros of Colom bia in Sout h America have divided and subdi vided into a score of Totemic groups , but they all preserve the descent in the female line, and therefore from the Mother - blood. For, if a member wounds himself with his ow n knife he is not allow ed to spill any of his ow n blood without paying for it. His family on the Mother’s side demand blood - mone y in com pensation for their loss. There was no indi vidual prope rty in the Mother - blood. This belonge d to the family or tr ibe. It happe ns with the Gonds of Central Indi a that they have lost much of their pure blood by intermixture with the Hindu race. Hence, at the installation of a rajah his forehead must be touc hed with a drop of blood drawn from the body of a pur e aborigin e of the tribe to which the rajah belongs . (Forsyth, J., Highl ands of Central Indi a, p. 137 .) Intermarriage has now com e to be called Endoga my in oppos ition to Exoga my, or marriage out side the group. But the family traced from the Mother - blood was earlier than the Totemic tribe. When the children of one and the same mother intermarried, a kind of Endoga my, how ever limited, woul d be founde d. And when the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"children of one mother were com pelled to marry the children of anot her mother a sort of Exoga my was estab lished. The Mother was the foundr ess of the family, cons isting of herself and children. The founda tion of the hum an structure was in blood, the blood of the Mother. The fact was com memorated in blood - sacrifice when the victim was immured, or the blood was pour ed out at the base of the building; the custom , like others, is a mode of memorial that was cont inue d in Sign - langua ge when the origin and meaning of the act were inexpl icable. The Mother - blood , we repeat, was primary, and various custom s, rites, or c eremoni es show the pur pos e that was intende d to keep the one first blood, that of the Mother, intact. Each family woul d be proud and prefer their ow n foun t of sour ce, and ende avour to keep it pur e. Hence the marriage of the uterine brother and sister was a mode of preserving the Mother - blood. Hence also the eating of the Mother living was a way of preserving her blood to the cons angui neous group. The Mother eaten sacramentally was the earliest victim of blood - sacrifice. In this great cruel rite the body was eaten living to preserve the Mother - blood . Eating the Mother was the primitive Eucharist in which the Mother was the Host whos e flesh was torn in pieces like the later bread, and whos e blood was drunk religious ly as is the later wine. Blood was the life, and this was given by the Mother in her life and death. The hum an Mother was then in the pos ition of the Totemic zoot ype that was subs tituted for the parent and eaten by the brothers in a later sacrificial rite. It is not unc om mon for the com muni cants who partake of the Sacrament to hold that they have eaten the body and drunk the blood of God himself, and this belief survives in Christianity, as witnessed by the hym n which is sung after taking the Sacrament, beginni ng with — “Jesus, Mighty Saviour, Thou art in us now.” To empha size the fact still more, it is som etimes reque sted that thos e 71 who have not eaten the God shoul d sing the word “with” instead of “in.” (Instance quot ed in British Weekly, Sept. 1895. ) The Eucharistic rite of the Mexican s was called Teoqua lo, or “God is eaten”; and to eat the God as represented was to share the nature of the divinity. In like manne r the Namaqua s eat the flesh and drink the blood of the lion and tiger to partake of their supe rhum an strengt h. The Tierra del Fuegians expl ained that they ate the white man on pur pos e to share in his supe rior pow er. The Kamilaroi will eat the heart and liver of a brave man in order that they may partake of his spirit. The Mother was eaten on the same principle, but , as the Mothe r, she was eaten sacramentally in the primitive family meal. The custom of “killing the God, ” the priest, the roya l persona ge, the virgin or divine animal, and eating the victim at a sacrificial meal was root ed in this very primitive practice of the childr en eating the body of the Mother and drinki ng her blood in what may be termed the primordial Eucharist. The Mother was the earliest of the sacrificial victims that for special reasons were onl y allow ed to live a certain num ber of years, at the end of which time the giver of life was eaten in honour by her children as the most primitive sacramental food. The Mother was eaten at the family sacrament because, in the first place, she was the Mother. But there were other motives at work. She was"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"sacrificed com pa ratively young to preserve her from the effects of age, from grey hairs and wrinkl es, from disease, decrepitude , and bodi ly decay. The children were preserving her from the worms of earth and from the prow ling beasts of prey, and proba bly from the change o f life at the departure of the lizard. In eating the body of her who had been the food - giver, they were returning her as food to the family, and in partaking of her blood , the precious Mother - blood, they were giving back the soul (of blood) to the life of the family or brotherhood . Som e races, like the Indi an, will not eat the blood of an animal, for fear the soul of the animal shoul d enter the human body. But this was a reason, in religious canni balism, for the eating of the Mother - blood in order that her soul of life which was her blood might re - enter the family or brotherhood, or be “cont ained” by them. The Mother was not turned into a sacrifice, or the blood preserved on her ow n persona l account , so much as on account of the family or tribe to which the blood belonge d. Dawson tells us that onl y thos e who had died a violent death were eaten by the abor igines of the Port Fairy District, Western Australia. And then they were eaten “as a mark of affectiona te respect, in a solemn service of mour ning for the de ad.” (James Dawson, Australian Abor igines. ) The dead were eaten as a sign and toke n of mourning for thos e who were taken away before their time; and thus religious canni balism is resolved into a solemn mourning for the dead; and the signi ficance woul d be t he same when the fune ral feast was furnished by the body and blood of the Mother. The Fijians, among other races, used to put their mothers to death before they had attained old age. There is an account in Wilkes’s expl oring expe dition of the put ting to de ath of a mother (p. 211 , abbreviated). She was walking about as gay and lively as anyone , when one of her boys invi ted Mr. Hunt to the fune ral. Her two suns cons idered she had lived long enough. They 72 had prepared her fune ral feast, and were now goi ng to kill and bury her. They were doing this from love of their mother, and said that none but themselves, her ow n sons , coul d perform so sacred an office. Among the wande ring Birhor s of Indi a, who are canni bals, the parents in articulo mortis will beg their children to kill and eat them; and this is done as an act of filial piety. (Réclus, Primitive Folk, Eng. tr., p. 249. ) At the British Association meeting for 1895 it was testified by Capt. Hynde that one of the finest races of the Congo Negroes are still in the habit of eating the old and decrepit members of their families. Now , as the Mother was the earliest parent know n and honou red, it was she who woul d be eaten by the children in the earliest form of a fune ral meal. According to Herodot us (IV, 26) , it was a custom obs erved by the Issedone s to eat the dead bodi es of their parents. But, we repeat, the Mother was the only parent know n at first, therefore the onl y one that coul d be know ingl y eaten as the parent. The Mongol s and other races cons idered it imp ious for any part of the sacrifice to remain une aten or unc ons um ed. Terrible penalties were inflicted for such sacrilege. Now , there is not hing like the eating of the Mother with honou r that can so plausibly explain the origin of such a custom . The Mother as sacrifice woul d be “very sacred inde ed,” and to eat the body whol ly and entirely, includi ng the bone s and viscera, woul d be giving the proof of the highe st honou r and the profounde st affection which at the time was hum anly pos sible. Nothing was cons ider ed unc lean, because it was eaten as the most primitive Eucharistic Meal. Her"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"flesh thus eaten was the sacred food, and her blood was the drink when these were devour ed warm with life. Her representative, the Totemic zoot ype , was adopt ed later, and torn pie cemeal, to be eaten in a similar manne r. This tearing of the “hos t” in pieces toot h and nail was cont inue d in the Egyp tian, Greek, and other mysteries; and so it com es about that the body of Osiris or the Christ was torn in pieces as flesh in the form of b read, and every one of the com municants must drink of the wine as blood. Hence the com mandm ent: “Drink ye all of it.” And here it may be remarked that the sacrificial victim in the Gospel is eaten alive, or, at least, the Last Suppe r is solemnized before t he victim was crucified. We next see the group of communi cants extendi ng beyond the inne r circle when, as related by Anga s, the different parts of the body were appor tione d according to the human relations hip, the choi cest portions being given to thos e who had been nearest and dearest to the departed in this life. It was from affection the children ate their parent, but the ceremony of devour ing her alive was awesom e and cruel. It had to be performed, from motives that sufficed to establish the custom , but she was not eaten because the act was cruel. Still, the cruel endi ng of her life made her becom e a sacrificial victim, and as she was eaten pious ly, the meal was sacramental and the prototype of all the sacraments in which the Totemic zoot ype s or the Divin e Son succeeded as the victim sacrificed at the Eucharistic Meal. The Mother gave her life back to the family or tribe whilst living. She was literally eaten alive. In accordance with the law of Tabu, it was the custom for everyone to share and share alike all round in killing and eating the sacrifice. 73 This was so when the victim was a fawn or a kid. But no victim was so naturally calculated to raise the initial difficulty of striking the first blow in a form so acutely cruel as the Mother. This must h ave verily necessitated the practice of all the participants falling on the victim toge ther to avoi d the sense of indi vidua l blood - gui ltiness. Everyone must partake of the body, everyone must tear the flesh and lap the blood; everyone must share the respon sibility of the awful act. The Mother was not onl y eaten phys ically. There was a primitive kind of spiritual com munion celebrated in the rite which raised it to a religious status. The body and blood were suppos ed to be conve rted into spirit. The theory is expl icitly expr essed in the Greek statement that “the dead was raised again in the same sacrifice.” “All tasted the sacrificial flesh, so that the life of the victim was renewed in the lives of thos e who ate it.” (Theophr astus in Porph. , De Abst., II, 29. Cited in Encyclopæ dia Brit., v. XXI, p. 137, Ninth ed.) And this, of cour se, appl ied to the Mother as well as to any other victim whos e flesh was eaten as a sacrifice. In eating the flesh and blood of the Mother, the Brothers were absorbing her soul of li fe and she was being conve rted into a spirit. The idea survives in the Alcestis. As poi nted out by Percy Gardne r ( Sepul chral Relief from Tarentum , p. 21) , the heroine of the drama “is scarcely dead before she is invoke d by the chorus as a supe rhum an Pow er able to give and to withhol d favour s, now that she has been transubs tantiated.” Eating the human Mother as the Eucharist at the family meal led naturally to eating the Mother of Life who gave herself in food that men might live; the Mother who was represe nted by the Ainu She - Bear, the Acagchemen Panes - Bird, the crucified Great Mother of the Cypr iotes, or by the blood of Isis in Egypt , and who, unde r various mythical or Totemic type s, was the renewer of life by offering up her ow n; the earliest"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"type of vol u ntary sacrifice which preceded that of Horus the Saviour - Son or of Osiris in a later Eucharist. The hum an Mother was eaten actually, not as a Totemic type . The “Great Mother” was eaten by proxy as Totemic: Rerit or Shaat was annua lly eaten as the Sow ; Hath or was eaten as the Heifer; the female being the Totem of the Mother, whether hum an or divine. The Godde ss Tari Pennu is a form of the Earth - Mother who was worshippe d by the Kolarians of Benga l, and made fecund periodi cally by obl ations of blood at her fes tival of reproduc tion when the hum an doc trine was repeated and reappl ied to external nature and she was fertilized with blood. The offering was at times the flesh and blood of a virgin. A young girl, called the Meriah, was strippe d stark naked and bound wi th cords to a maypol e crow ned with flow ers, and ultimately put to death with hor rible tortures, torn in pieces, and partly eaten. (Réclus, Primitive Folk, pp. 311 - 315 .) In the Khond sacrifice of the Meriah we have anot her form of the Great Mother. She was fastened to the stake by her hair and forced to become a figure of the crucified, for her arms were extende d cross - wise by four priests, who pul led her legs apart to com plete the figur e. She was the cross, the crucified and the Christ or Charis in one . Th e theory now subs tantiated is that the earliest Totems were zoot ype s of the Mothers, that the Mother was the earliest victim 74 eaten at the family meal, and that the hum an sacrifice was com muted by the subs titution of the Totemic animal at a later stage of developm ent. Thus , we hear that the sacrificial offering made to the river Nile was first of all a human virgin, and afterwards a sacred animal. Also, when the Panes - Bird of the Acagchemens is said to have been a wom an previous ly, or elsewhere, we see the bird has been subs tituted for the human victim in the Eucharistic rite as representative of the Great Mother. The Emu was the bird of Earth in Australia, like the Goos e in Egypt . As layer of the egg it represented Earth, the Mother of Food. Now the Emu , in the Kurnai mythology, is also called “the Wom an,” or Mother, who, like Neith, was imaged as the Giver of Food. And when the Arunt a members of the Emu Totem propitiate the pow er solicited by them for the increase of food, the blood which they shed from their ow n veins is not simply pour ed forth on the ground. A small prepared plot of soil is saturated with blood and allow ed to dry, and on this the bird is out lined to represent the food of the Totem for which they are asking. The Emu is a type of the Ear th - Mother to whom the obl ation of blood is offered, and who is thus identified by the bird as their provi der or provi dence, who had been “the Wom an” previous ly. The hum an Mothers had been eaten sacramentally to preserve the family blood in all its primal, that was virginal, purity. At a later stage, when the Totemic animal was religious ly eaten periodi cally as the sacrificial victim, this had com e to represent the Great Mother, the Earth - Mother, the Mother who was propi tiated and pleaded with for prove nde r; the Mother of Food who was eaten vicarious ly with the Totem as her type of food. Blood was the ancient life and Motherhood the fount of sour ce. Blood was the earliest hum an tie. Then the Blood - Brotherhood succeeded and gradua lly supe rseded the Blood - Mothe rhood. A group of proge nitors, or brothers of the blood, began to usurp the place of the Ancestresses as parental pow ers on the way to finally establishing the Patriarchate."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" Civilization first began with the condi tions of the pre - Totemic peopl e, who were pre - hum an. According to the traditions of the Arunt a, they had no stone kni fe, no fire - stick, no rites or ceremoni es of pube scence. Inde ed, there were no men or wom en then extant. The nascent race was not yet hum anized; it had to be created by becom ing Tot emic. This tradition of the human origin, which can be uni versally corrobor ated, is, in its way, a primitive version of the so - called “Creation of Man” that com es to us belated in the Book of Genesis. It tends to show that hum an beings , “Created Men” of th e Egypt ian “Tem,” were a birth of Totemism. The traditions of the Arunt a affirm that Totemism originated with “Two Wom en” who, as here sugge sted, were the Mother and the Eldest Daught er in the hum an family, the first two persons who were recogni zed as ance stral type s of the Virgin who conc eived and the Mother who brought forth. There is ample evidence to show that Totemism was founde d by “Two Wom en,” the “Two Wom en” who were the mythical Ancestresses of the Race. These are represented by the two females who prepared young girls for sexua l intercour se at the period of pube scence, by performing the ope ning rite of introcision, and who were cons eque ntly the typi cal founde rs of Totemism. 75 The Arunt a say it had been found that many of the younge r wom en died in cons eque nce of unl imited prom iscuous intercour se with men who were unrestrained and wom en unpr epared by the ope ning rite when there was as yet no law of tabu. The ope ning rite was preparatory and cons idered necessary to befit the young wom en for sexua l intercour se, and also to protect them previously from savage treatment. Therefore we argue that it was devised by the Mothers for the protection of the daught ers. The wom en of the Hawk Totem are said to have made certain men “ashamed of their excesses.” (S pencer and Gillen, N.T., p. 416 .) The men were mons trous in their size and savagery, and necessitated the Totemic rites. It is related of the “Two Wom en,” here called the Elder and the Younge r Sisters, that they were “cons iderably alarmed at the Ulpm erka M en.” But when the pube scent rites had been performed, the wom en were no longe r afraid, and all the men had free access to them (p. 315) . In order that the fears of the “Two Wom en” might be allayed the Ulpm erka made a large nur tunj a, or Totem - pol e, upon whi ch the sacred emblems called the Chur inga were suspende d. “After this had been show n to the wom en they were no longe r timid.” One of the Two was then decorated with the dow n of birds and a small nur tunja, of a blunt , coni cal shape, was set upon her head fo r ornament, and the men danced round her, shout ing “Wah! Wah! ” Then she was taken and laid beside the large nur tunj a, which was fixed upr ight in the ground . The ope ration of ope ning the vul va, Atna ariltha - Kum a, was then performed by means of a large stone kni fe. After this the intercour se was lawful and all the men had access to her. The same ceremony was repeated in the initiation of the second or younge r wom an. Sexua l intercour se till then had been prom iscuous , and there was no standi ng on ceremony or wa iting till the females came of age for rape to be enforced. The first two females were made into wom en by means of the opening rite in which they were prepared for Totemic connubi um . One of these, the elder one , ope rated on the younge r, and then the two wo men became the first Ancestresses of the Race who were cons tituted such by the ope ning rite that was performed at pub erty. These were the Two Wom en of"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"the Lizard Totem. There were onl y “Two Wom en” originally among the Plum - tree Ulpm erka Men, that is the un circum cised. At first they were unope ned. Then they were ope rated on, and all the men had access to them, first with one , and then with the other (p. 315) . These were the Two Wom en with whom semi - prom iscuity was regul ated by the division into the two class es with which dichot om ous - Totemism began. These Two Wom en are various ly described as com ing to introduc e the rite of pube scence by means of which the girls were made into wom en and the unc ircum cised males into men. This is performed by them at different ha lting places. Unde r the Matriarchate, racial descent was reckone d by the Mother - blood, therefore the Mother was the earliest Wom an kno wn. The eldest daught er was the primary channe l of descent. Therefore the eldest daught er was the second wom an of the pri mal Two. A score of mothers or daught ers woul d not change the type of the two wom en first know n as the Mother and Eldest Daughter or the Two 76 Sisters. Thus amongs t the primitive or archaic traditions of the hum an race there is a legend of descent from “Two Wom en” called the “Ancestresses.” This is extant in Africa and in Australia: in Totemism and Mythol ogy. The Arunt a have several traditions or fragm ents of tradition conc erning these two typi cal wom en in the sociology of Totemism. There were “Two Wom en ” in the Alcheringa or Mythical Past. Two Wom en of the Opos sum Totem. (p. 403 ). Two Wom en of the Magpi e Totem (p. 404) . Two Wom en of the Hakea Totem (p. 436) . Two Wom en of the Kanga roo Totem (p. 464) . Two Wom en who accom panied the Men of the Plum - tree in t he Alcheringa , as Two Sisters, Elder and Younge r (pp. 149, 315) . The starting poi nt of the Hakea - flow er Totem is from Two Female Ancestors (p. 122 ). These Two Wom en are called the elder and the younge r. All the men had access to bot h of them as soon as the y had unde rgone the ope ning rite. Thus the Arunt a trace the origin of Totemism in its sociologi cal aspect to the rites of pube rty that were adopt ed for utility when the pre - hum an creatures were first change d into wom en and men by means of the rites. These were first performed upon Two Wom en of the Lizard Totem, one being described as the Elder, the other as the Younge r Sister. The lizard is the sign of feminine pube scence and especially the Mother’s Totem in Africa and Australia. Hence it was honou red as t he author of primitive marriage. The Two Wom en are the Ancestresses of the hum an race because they were the first two females to unde rgo the preparatory rite that change d them into Totemic wom en fitted for social intercourse in com muna l connubi um. This fem inine dua lity evol ved in the sociology had been divinized as the Great Mother in mythol ogy bot h in Australia and in Africa. In the Osirian cult Isis and Nepht hys are at onc e the Two Mothers, Two Sisters, and Two Wives of Osiris. Isis is the Virgin - Mother, the Blood - Mother, the one of Two who conc eives but doe s not bring forth the Child. Nepht hys represents the Godde ss who doe s bring forth and who is the Nurse by name. These are also called the Mother and Sister as well as the Two Sisters and the Two Wives. In shor t, they are the Two human Ancestresses of the Race who were divinized in Mythol ogy. Thus the Two Wom en who were the Author s of Totemism are the Two Ancestresses who may be described either as Two Mothers, Two Sisters elder and younge r, Mother and Da ught er, or the Virgin and Gestator, in the various legends , because they are the typi cal Two that were from the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"beginni ng when the Mother and Eldest Daught er were the means of descent dur ing the Matriarchate. With the Nairs of Malabar, whos e manne rs are ve ry primitive, the brothers obe y their eldest sister. Next to the mother she is the ruler of the family. And in former times, on great ceremoni al occasions , the reigni ng prince himself yielded precedence to his eldest daught er. She was one of the onl y “Two Wom en.” The Mother being the first person in the hum an family, the eldest sister was the second as next available for sexua l intercour se; and these became the mythical “Two Wom en” from whom the Australian natives claim descent. These represent the female d uality that brought on the Mother - blood. In som e of the legends the Mother passes into the Two Ancestresses as the Mother 77 and Sister, instead of Mother and Daught er. At others they are the Two Sisters. Isis is designa ted the Mother, and Nepht hys the S ister. Demeter is the Mother, and Persephone or Kore is the Daught er. The two were often called the Mother and Daught er. It may seem a long way from the Greek Mother and Daught er to the Polyne sian Mythol ogy, but as a form of the feminine ancestors they are originally the same in the hum an sphe re. In the Australian ceremoni es of initiation there is what How itt terms the feminine “dua lity” of Ngalalbal, in the “Wives of Daramulun.” This female dua lity is the analogue of the two sisters, Isis and Nepht hys , who were the two cons orts of Horus or Osiris in the Egypt ian mythos . These Two Sisters are the same Two Mothers of the typi cal child in Australia as in Africa. Daramulun, like Horus, is the child of the Two Mothers, “The Ngalalbal - dance,” says How itt, “is ren dered very effective through being preceded by the ‘dua lity’ of Ngalalbal, the wives of Daramulun.” These are seen to glide from the forest past the fire and to disappe ar in the gloom beyond to a slow and rather melanchol y air sung by the audi ence, which m ay be rende red, “Ngalalbal, you two com ing from afar, where are you goi ng to?” (How itt, Australian Ceremoni es of Initiation. ) Ngalalbal, the wife of Daramulun, was originally represented by the Emu, and is at the same time “the Wom an” who divides into the Two Wom en. Thus the hum an sour ce of descent follow s the pre - hum an here, as in the Egypt ian Mythos . And in the dua lity of Ngalalbal we have the two wives who are the two sisters of Horus in the Osirian myth. This feminine dua lity was one of the secret myste ries in Australia as in Africa. Com muna l marriage, as practised in Totemism, had been reduc ed in Egypt to the system of two wives; the one being know n as the Hemet or Wife, the other as the Neb.t - Paru or Mistress of the Hous e. This was also an Inne r - Africa n marriage institution. The first corresponde d to Isis the Wife; the second to Nepht hys the Mistress of the Hous e. The Wives of Osiris were also his Sisters. Isis says to Osiris, “I am thy doubl e Sister.” This she was in the two characters of Isis and Neph thys , because the Great Mother qua Mother dupl icated in the two females as ancestresses. Hence the “Doubl e Divine Mother” who is mentione d in the texts. Not that Osiris was suppos ed to have married two Blood - Sisters, but that sister was the earlier name fo r the Wife, because there was a Totemic Sisterhood correspondi ng to the Totemic Brotherhood. This dua l sym bol ism extant amongs t the Australian abor igines, had been divinized and preserved in the Mythol ogy of Egypt , because it was onc e extant in the Sociolo gy. In these Two Sisters who were Two Wives one sees the Totemic cons orts reduc ed to that num ber as the sisters of one brother, on the way to com plete monoga my. At an earlier social stage, which we find among the Namaqua Hottentots,"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"two chiefs had four wiv es in com mon among them. This was a departure from the equa lity of the more primitive com muna l connubi um in which four brothers were hus bands to four sisters, as in Africa, or ten brothers to ten sisters, as in Britain. There woul d have been two Ancestres ses to the human race in the Hebrew Genesis if the legend had been prope rly repor ted. In the extra - biblical tradition Adam had two wives, Lilith and Chavah, but 78 Lilith, the more mystical female of the two, has been damned by orthodoxy as the demoni aca l destroye r of children= she who did not bring forth. In a more mystical pha se the female dua lity of nature was pre - pube scent and pube scent. It is mentione d here because the dogm a of a Virgin - Mother originated in this natural reality, and because the two di vine wom en Isis and Nepht hys also represent the Virgin and the Mother in this mystical character. Isis was the Virgin who brough t forth the child. Female nature of itself divides into the two pha ses of Girlhood and Wom anhood; the Virgin and the Mother, the one being the Mother of blood, the other the Milch - Mother of the child. Such was the origin of a doub le Motherhood which is personi fied in the Egypt ian mythos . In one cult the Godde ss Neith is the Mother who conceives the child, and Sekhe t is the Bringe r - forth. Now , Neith was the mystical Virgin, whilst Sekhe t was the Godde ss of sexua l passion. But in the Osirian cult this female dua lity was represented by Isis the Virgin and Nepht hys the Nurse. These are the Two hum an Ancestresses (Tiriti) divinized, but not merely as two sisters in sociology . The marital or sexua l relations were at first prom iscuous . Then there was a division of the gregarians into two com muni ties or classes in which the primal prom iscuity was regul ated for group - marriage with the totali ty divided in two halves, and subdi vided afterward by the Totems, which were extende d more and more unt il they reached the radius of the “Uppe r Ten” or the Chinese “hundr ed families.” As will bear repeating, to the conf usion of various writers, the Arunt a have traditions of a time when a man always married a sister of his ow n Totem. This, as tribal, follow ed the marriage of the brother and sister of the blood in natural endog amy: the same intermarriage that is found in African Totemism. There was a time, th e Arunt a also say, when “unde r the old system” all the Purula wom en were eligible as wives to a Panungo man, whereas unde r the new system onl y one half of the wom en were marriageable to him ( Native Tribes, p. 421) , thos e of the other half being strictly fo rbidde n to him. This show s that utterly prom iscuous intercour se was follow ed and supe rseded by the division of the whol e into two halves; which we take to have been the intercourse that was sacred to the brother and sister of the blood within the matriarch al family, and which was afterwards divided into the first two exoga mic intermarriageable groups . As testified to by the latest witnesses, the “funda mental feature” in the organism of the Australian tribes is “the division of the tribe into two exoga mous i ntermarrying groups ” (p. 55) . In the Urabunna Tribe, which may be taken as typi cal, “the whol e tribe is divided up into two exoga mous intermarrying classes, respectively called Matthur ie and Kirarawa. These two classes are subdi vided into two sixes as Tote mic groups . “All descent is count ed from the Mother bot h as regards class and Totem” (p. 60). And “the men of one half of the tribe must marry the wom en of the other half,” in marriage by the group , no such thing as indi vidua l marriage"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"being know n. One of the Australian abor igines who had travelled far and wide has stated that “he was furnished with tempor ary wives by the various tribes amongs t whom he sojour ned in his travels; that his right to these wom en was recog - 79 nized as a matter of cour se; and t hat he coul d always ascertain whether they belonge d to the division into which he coul d legally marry, though the places were 1,000 miles apart and the langua ges were qui te different.” (Fison and How itt, p. 53. ) Starting from the beginni ng with the Two Cla sses, one man at that stage was entitled to half the wom en. As we find, the two divisions spread out ove r great parts of the land. Totems were adde d and further divisions made when the two were divided into four and the four into eight , but if the man belo nge d to one of the primary two classes, his right to half of the wom en correspondi ng to his Totem woul d still hol d good if they were scattered ove r all the count ry. His range in the com muna l marriage woul d be more circum scribed if his were one of the well - know n four Totems, and becom e still more limited if it were onl y one of the eight into which the two were so freque ntly subdi vided in Australia and America. On certain festival occasions the wom en of all the Totems are held as com mon prope rty or there is p artial prom iscuity of the sexes by a return from the subdi visiona l arrange ment to that of the first Two Classes; as when a man will lend his wife to a strange r, always provi ded that he belongs to the sam e class as himself (N.T., p. 93), the class that was anterior to the Totem. This com mon right of all the tribal brothers of one class to all the wom en of the other even from the beginni ng, when there were but two, will expl ain certain perplexing marriage custom s of later times, when the marriage of indi vidua ls was slow ly taking the place of marriage between group s or classes; which may be termed custom s of exemption from the primitive com munal connubi um , such as the right of the tribal elders to act the part of Baal - Peor, and the droit du seigne ur still extan t, although com mutable, in the island of Jersey. As a natural fact, the human race originated from the Mother - earth in Two Classes. They were the forest - folk and the Trogl odites bor n of the Tree and the Rock; and such a fact was sure to have been preserve d in the Kamite Record. In the very first stage they were the children of Earth, or the Earth - Mother. The Mother is then divided or follow ed by the Two Wom en who are distingui shed from each other by their emblems of the Birth - place: the Tree and the Rock, or stone with a hol e in it, which is an image of the Mother - earth. We can now com pare the wood and stone Chur inga of the Arunt a with other emblems of the Tree and Rock of earth. The Australian Totemic system begins with being Dichot om ous . There is a Divis ion of the Whol e in two halves. The Arunt a erect two Totem - pos ts or sacred pol es, one for the sout h and one for the north, by which the division is most carefully distingui shed. There are Two Ancestresses or self - existent female founde rs; Two kinds of Chur inga made of wood and stone ; Two Wom en of the Lizard Totem. There are several instances in which the first departure from prom iscuity remains final because it has never been out grow n. This is so in the case of the two classes still extant and still recogni zable, which held good for marital right s all ove r the cont inent. The whol e uni verse was divided into two primary classes of things , correspondi ng to the two primary Totemic classes of the Australian abor igines."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 80 The Port Makay Tribe in Queensland divi ded all Nature between their two primary Motherhoods ; the dichot om ous system founde d on the twofold character of the Mother as Virgin and Gestator whom the Egypt ians had divinized as She who conc eived and She who brought to birth. The Totems com monl y follo w the two divisions as the signs of subdi visions . Inde ed, it appe ars that we get a glimpse here and there of the two divisions without any Totems follow ing them, as if the most rudi mentary organization had extende d no further. The Banks Islande rs, for exam ple, appe ar to have been divided into two primary classes, and to have had no sub - divisiona l Totems. Reading Totemism by aid of the Egypt ian wisdom , it is evident that the two classes, the two kinds of Chur inga (wood and stone ), the two Poles (North and So uth), the two wom en, represent the Motherhood that was dupl icated in the two female ancestors; and that the Totems of the sub - divisions represent the blood - brotherhoods , thus affiliated to the Mother - blood , which were follow ed finally by the blood - fatherho od. The Arunt a beginning is immeasurably later than the Egypt ian tradition preserved in the astronom ical mythol ogy. Their beginni ng is in fact with Totemism. This was preceded by a period or condi tion of existence called “the Alcheringa ” or the far - off pas t of the mythical ancestors of whos e origin and nature they have no know ledge but have preserved the tradition. The twofold division was funda mental and uni versal in Egypt . Beginni ng with the two Egypt s and the two Tiruti, they had the two halves, North a nd Sout h, divided by the Equi noc tial line: the two earths upp er and low er, the two hous es of earth and heaven, the two hous es of gove rnm ent, the two hous es of the treasury, the two granaries, the two fields of sacrifice. The War Department was twofold. The prope rty of the State and of the Temple was divided into two parts. An ende avour to recove r the Kamite mythol ogy from the traditions of the Arunt a may look like fishing the infinite, but deep - sea dredge rs som etimes find strange things . The Ritual preserve s a record of the fact that in the primary division of the total or the whol e earth in two halves, the bounda ries of Sout h and North were determined by two trees. Hence, when the Sun, or Solar God, rises in the East, he is said to issue forth from betwixt the two sycamores of the North and Sout h. This division of the one ness in space into North and South in locality has been curious ly preserved by the Arunt a Tribes, who make use of the two Poles in their religious or Totemic ceremoni es, one the Nurtunj a, is erected in the North; the other, called the Waninga , is made use of in the South. (P. 627 .) These are equi valent to the Kamite two sycamore - trees of the North and South, as type s of the original division of the earth, and of the later earth and heaven; al so called the two trees in the garden of the beginni ng. This primordial division of the whol e into two classes still persists in the Christian scheme of the future life, where the dichotom ous arrange ment of the prom iscuous multitude is cont inue d as from th e first. There are to be onl y two classes of peopl e in the world to com e, and onl y two Totems, the sheep and the goa t, to distingui sh thos e who are still described in gesture - langua ge as being the one on the right hand, the other on the left; 81 "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"which is a re - beginni ng hereafter in exact accordance with the first Totemic bifurcation of the hum an race on earth. In the cour se of time, as hum an cons cious ness increased, the Mother woul d be made exempt from the primitive prom iscuous intercour se. Here it may b e obs erved that much of the early wisdom was secreted in the Totemic Tabus that were recited to the initiates in the mysteries of young - man and young - wom an - making. The Buffalo - clan of the Omaha Indi ans are prohibited from eating a calf whilst it is red, bu t when it turns black the animal may be eaten. This, as we unde rstand it, was a mode of memorial by means of Tabu. There was a similar prohi bition in the Red Maize clan. The youngs ters of the sub - clan are told that if they were to eat of the red maize they woul d break out in runni ng sores all round the mouth. Nothing is more com mon in the initiation of Australian yout hs than for these to be solemnly warned against eating forbidde n food . They are not to eat the emu, that is a Totem which represents the Mothe r — as did other forms of prohi bited food , includi ng the tree. Thus eating the fruit of the forbidde n tree is violating the Mother or female, in one of the pha ses know n to be prohi bited. If, as herein adva nced, the Totem first represented the Mother, we may find a root - reason why it came to be prohi bited from being eaten, excepting as a sacrament at the religious festival of prom iscuity onc e a year. We know that in the Totemic Mysteries it was the Mothers or female elders who induc ted the boys into a know ledg e of connubi um . This proba bly registers the fact that, when the boys became pube scent, the Mothers show ed their ow n the way, in the early state of prom iscuity. And the likelihood is that the Mother was made Tabu to her ow n children as the earliest law of p rohibition from what came to be cons idered unna tural sexua l intercour se which had been at one time natural. They were prohi bited from “eating of her” in this sense, and the mode of memorizing the law woul d be by not eating of the zoot ype which represented the Mother. The Hindu doe s not eat the cow , the Jew doe s not eat the swine, and this is because these represented the Mother as a Totemic sign, and the typical Great Mother in the Mythol ogy. Descent from the Mother was represented by descent from the Totem . Thus , if the Totem were a cow , and it was said in a mystery, thou shalt not eat of the cow , when it was intende d to repudi ate the primitive practice, the com mand woul d signi fy in Sign - langua ge, “Thou shalt not eat the Mother.” She was now forbidde n food, whether as the cow , the sow , the emu, or the tree, the same as with the red calf, which represented the child. According to Bailey, the custom of the Vedda hs “sanctions the marriage of a man with his younge r sister.” But to “marry an elder sister or aunt woul d, in their estimation, be incestuous ,” whereas “marriage with the younge r sister is cons idered to be natural.” It was in fact the prope r marriage. To unde rstand this, we may assum e that the elder sister of two stands for the Mother, and that the Tabu was originally directed against connubi um betwixt the son and the Mother, whereas the marriage of a brother and sister, blood or tribal, was allow ed as the onl y prope r conne ction now for preserving the Mother - blood without com mitting incest. 82 If the T otem is a means of Tabu, as we know it to have been, and the Mother or the Sister is represented by the Totem, then the hum an female is aimed at unde r various Totemic type s. Thou shalt not eat the calf whilst it is red woul d conve y"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"protection for the pre - p ube scent girl. There are twenty different kinds of game forbidde n to the Narrinye ri yout hs in their initiation; also any food belongi ng to wom en is prohi bited. This woul d include the animal which cons tituted the Totem that was first of all the sign of the Mother herself, as the cow , the sow , the mous e, or other female zoot ype . Thus , when, as Plutarch tells us, the Egyp tians thought that if a man shoul d drink the milk of a sow his body woul d break out in sores, it shoul d be remembered that the sow was a Tote m of the Mother, and the hum an Mother was masked by the sow . Various Tabus are expr essed in Sign - langua ge, which has to be interpreted. A prohibition against eating the Mother woul d be expr essed by not eating the food or animal that was her Totem. Say the Totem was a type of the Mother, who was at one time eaten, and was represented by the cow , and afterwards the custom was prohi bited, the law of Tabu in that case woul d be conve yed to the initiate in the primitive mysteries by the injunc tion “Thou shalt not eat the cow ,” or coha bit with the Mother. Various Tabus were certainly conve yed in that way. Thou shalt not eat the cow , Hindu and Toda Tabu; Thou shalt not eat the sow , Jewish Tabu; Thou shalt not drink the milk of the sow , Egypt ian Tabu; Thou shalt not eat the hare, Damara Tabu; Thou shalt not go near or look on the crocodi le, Bechua na Tabu; Thou shalt not eat the calf while it is red, Omaha Tabu; Thou shalt not touc h the Mother - blood , com mon Tabu; Thou shalt not eat the female of any animal, Kurnai Tabu ; Thou shalt not eat the fruit of the tree of know ledge , Biblical Tabu; Thou shalt not eat the Totem, com mon Tabu. We might add “Thou shalt not marry a deceased wife’s sister,” as a Christian Tabu. Thus not eating the cow or other female - totem – like the sow or the panes - bird – woul d originally mean not conj oining with the Mother, whereas not eating the calf whilst it was red woul d be a mode of protecting or of safegua rding the impube scent girl. The Totemic festival of fructification naturally had a pha llic ch aracter, as it was sexua l from the first. It was not onl y performed at seed - sow ing and harvest, on behalf of food. Long before corn was cultivated in the name of Isis or Demeter, there was a general rejoicing at the time when the yout h was made into a man and the girl into a wom an. The general rejoicing at the girl’s com ing of age was in celebration of her entering into connubi um , which was com muna l, as she was then ope n and accessible to all the males, at least on this occasion when she entered the ranks o f wom anhood as com mon prope rty, which was afterwards made several by developm ent of the marriage - law. Marriage began as a recogni zed, if regul ated, right of all the brothers to ravish every maiden as she came of age, and thus to make a woman of her for tri bal connubi um . And the primitive rite, though com muted, was cont inue d in the later ceremoni es. Various custom s tend to show that capture in marriage originated as a mode of rescuing or ransom ing the wom an from the clutch of the general com muni ty in which t he female was com mon 83 to all the males of the group . In the special marriage of indi vidua l pairs the wom an had to be captured and carried off from the group — onl y instead of being captured we might say “rescued” by the indi vidua l (and his friends ) from being the prom iscuous prope rty of the com muni ty. Hence the custom of com pensation to the group (or, later, parents) for permitting the female to becom e private prope rty in persona l marriage. The primitive rite"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"of connubi um was first cons um mated by all the males of the Totemic group , not by an indi vidua l hus band. The custom s show that com muna l connubi um invol ved conne ction with the whol e brotherhood as a rite of marriage after the general prom iscuity had been modi fied. For instance, with the Australian Kuna n dabur i tribe when a girl became marriageable, on natural grounds , her affianced husband, accom panied by his male cont empor aries, fetched her from her parents, and the marriage was cons um mated there and then, not by the hus band, but by the whol e of his conf rères; the jus primae noc tis, includi ng all his Totemic brethren. Mr. O’Donne ll, who furnished the information, says it include d all the males present in camp without exception of class, Totem or kin, and was fulfilled for several days. (How itt, Mother - rig ht to Father - right , J. A. S., Feb. 7, 21, 1882. ) This was com muna l connubi um onc e for all, but onl y onc e, in place of the older custom of cont inua l prom iscuity. In the Sont hal marriage, which also takes place by the group onc e a year, all the candi dates fo r matrimony live toge ther for six days in prom iscuous intercour se. After which, onl y separate coupl es are held to have established their right to marry. ( The Peopl e of Indi a, by J. F. Watson and J. W. Kaye, vol . I, p. 2.) Thus there was a rite of prom iscui ty obs erved as a propi tiatory preparation for indi vidua l marriage. This was to be seen at the temple of Belit in Babyl on, where the wom en offered themselves to all men prom iscuous ly before they were free to marry. It was a mode of releasing the wom an from a bonda ge impos ed upo n her in the past. It is said of this custom in the Epistle of Jeremy — “The wom en also with cords about them, sat in the ways bur ning bran for incense: but if any of them, drawn by som e that passeth by, lie with him, she reproacheth her fellow that she was not thought as worthy as herself nor her cord broken ( Book of Baruch, VI, 43). When the Attic maidens danced as bears at the Brauroni a in the ¢rkteia of Artemis, it was a mode of making them indi vidua lly marriageable, and the mode was evidently in accordance with the Totemic ritual as in the mysteries of Belit. This will also expl ain the crave for hum an blood, which was attribut ed to the godde ss, on the ground that the blood was that of the Virgins thus cons ecrated by the most ancient p ractice of prom iscuity, or all - for - all. In various ways the Totemic or tribal organization fought hard and long against the wom an becom ing private prope rty. The males cons idered, with Prudhom me, that prope rty was robbe ry, and individua l ow nership in marri age had many modi fications in the cour se of being eventually established. In the sout h of Malayalam a married wom an is permitted to have twelve other hus bands as love rs besides the man to whom she is legally bound, but she must play the game fairly and no t exceed the num ber allow ed. With the Esqui maux or Inoi ts the primitive 84 com muna l marriage still obt ains in spite of their being monoga mists in appe arance. As M. Réclus remarks, adul tery is a daily escapade with the wom en as well as the men. The “membe rs of the Marital Association keep runni ng account s and ope n large credits” with each other. When the wind blow s from the sout h every wom an is out on the rampage after other men, but each wife must lawfully coupl e with the man to whom the hus band woul d wil lingl y have lent her, and who will lend his ow n wife in return. They hol d that all were made for all. The sin against nature is for the lawful wife to seek connubi um"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"with a bachelor, who can make no return in kind to the hus band. (Réclus, Primitive Folk, E ng. tr., p. 32. Ross, Second Voya ge.) The custom is African. Sir Harry Johns ton mentions a curious mode of weighi ng out even - hande d justice in cases of adul tery. Amongs t the A - nya nja if a man is caught in the act he is com pelled to get anot her man as subs t itute to coha bit with his wife before he can return to her; he must also pay his subs titute for this service four yards of cloth, or make an equi valent present, otherwise the subs titute can claim and carry off the wife as his ow n prope rty. ( Brit. Cent. Afr ica, p. 415. ) It was not the men alone who resisted the change . According to Petherick, the mother of the bride, among the Hassanye h Arabs, protests against “bindi ng her daught er” to a due obs ervance of that chastity which matrimony is expe cted to com mand for more than two days in the week at a time. (Petherick, J., Egypt, the Soudan, and Central Africa. ) Various ways of limiting the primitive prom iscuity, and at the same time of securing elasticity in the marriage tie, might be cited. For example, the Spa niards found a curious custom current in Lancerota. A woman there had several hus bands , but “a hus band was cons idered as such onl y dur ing a lunar revolution. ” (Spencer, Data, 298. ) Thus one wom an was limited to one man for a mont h, and the marital relation s were change able with the moon . That which was once the wom an’s right is still sought for as a privilege when the Esthoni an wom en claim to repeat the rites of the ancient saturnalia, such as dancing in a state of nudi ty at the festival of spring. With us the Matriarchate still survives on Friday, the wom an’s day, and in February, the mont h in which the wom en claim the right to choos e their husbands every leap - year. On certain festive occasions there is a total or partial return to the pre - eval status of th e sexes. This return occurs at the pha llic festival or primitive Agapæ . In a corrobo ree of the Arunt a, which lasts for ten days or a fortnight at a time, there is a partial return to prom iscuity, or the sexua l licence which the natives say was a practice o f the Alcheringa , or old, old times. (N.T., pp. 96 - 101. ) This doe s not stand alone. According to the repor t of Mr. Kühn in Kam ilaroi and Kurnai (by L. Fison and A. W. How itt, pp. 285 - 7), the men of the Turra tribe were not debarred from sexua l intercour se with wom en of their ow n Totem in the orgies of the grand corrobor ee. This show s the same return to utter prom iscuity for the time being as in all other celebrations of the pha llic festival when the onl y law was that of all for all. It was a return pro tem. to the most ancient usage, which is represented in mythol ogy by the old first Mother in connubi um with her ow n sons . The primitive custom s were established as a means 85 of memorizing that which coul d not otherwise be registered. Thus the Arunt a danced the history of their descent from the time when the race was not divided by the Lizard. And thus the state of prom iscuous intercour se was repeated in the religious mysteries, includi ng thos e of the Christian Chur ch. According to a Latin myth, the saturnali a of ancient Rom e was held in com memoration of the sexua l prom iscuity that onc e obt ained. Such custom s cons tituted the record of prehistoric if not primitive man. That is why their performance is so permanent and so uni versal. A change in the human descen t from the Motherhood to the Fatherhood is appa rent in the Egypt ian Mythol ogy as early as the time of Ptah, the father of Atum - Ra."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Mother, hum an or divine, was primordial. Next came the sisters. Then the brothers, the same in mythol ogy as in Totemism. Previous to the dyna sty of Ptah there were seven brothers bor n of the sevenfold Motherhood, when there was as yet no father indi vidua lized. Six of these were pre - hum an, for instance, Sut the Male - Hippopot amus, Sebek the Crocodi le, Shu the Lion, Hapi the Ap e, Apua t the Jackal, Kabhs enuf the Hawk; and one , the Elder Horus, was hum an, as the child of Isis, the blood - Mother. The seven soul s are com monl y reckone d as 6+ 1. The six are pre - anthropom orphi c. They were pow ers of the elements represented by the zoot ype s, such as the soul of earth that was imaged by the beast of earth; the soul of water by the crocodi le; the soul of breathing - force by the lion; the soul of fire by the ape; the soul of vegetation by the serpent. The seventh soul was hum an. This was imaged in Child - Horus, who became the chief of the Seven and leader of the Com pany. The Dog - rib Indi ans preserve a tradition, which is also repeated along the Pacific coast from Alaska to Oregon , that the ancient Mother of the hum an race was a wom an who was mat ed with a dog. The wom an gave birth to six pups , which used to throw off their skins at will when they were alone , and play in hum an shape. This, in its qua int way, is anot her form of the mystery of the six as pre - hum an soul s which culminated in the sevent h soul that attained the human status toge ther with the anthropom orphi c type . In the Manga ian “Mute - land,” at the root of all beginni ng, there are “Two Wom en,” called the Mother and her Daught er. This beginni ng was at the bot tom of the hol low cocoa - nut she ll called Avaiki. Vari is the name of the mythical Great Mother. Tu - Metua is the daught er. Her name, which signi fies “Stick - by - the - parent,” is know ingl y natural. Anot her poi nt. She is the last produc t of the Great Mother, the onl y female child, and is call ed her suppor t, her belove d child. These two are the ground and basis of a world in six divisions . Now , there came a time in Egyp t when the brothers, who had previous ly been the children of the Mother, were called the sons of Ptah, and all their pow ers we re com prehende d in the uni ty of the God who was portrayed as bot h Father and Mother in one person. In the Texts, Ptah is called “the hus band of his Mother,” which show s the pol yga mous Patriarch who afterwards entered the monoga mic state with Sekhe t Mer - Pta h for his singl e cons ort. (Maspero, The Daw n of Civilisation, p. 106 , not e, Eng. tr.) It has been previous ly 86 show n that the custom of couva de was a dramatic mode of affiliating the offspring to the father which had previous ly derived its descent from the Mother. ( Nat. Genesis. ) It is certain that in this the male impersona tes the Mother because he acts as if in gestation with the child and som etimes unde rgoe s a fictitious parturition. But the supr eme peculiarity of this primitive mystery is that the ma le parent not onl y acts the part of the Mother, but also of the father; bot h parents in one person. It is in this sense onl y that Sut, who was the first - born of the Seven, is called in later langua ge a Father of the Gods . (Rit., ch. 8.) In Akka d or Babyl on ia, the group of seven males is divided into Ea as a father with his six sons . It is the same among the Zuni Indians, whos e fetish deities are seven in num ber, that is six, with a form of God the Father as the supr eme one . These were the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"rulers of the six regions or moun tains, with Po - shai - an - kia in the centre as the head ove r all. (Cushing. Second Annua l Repor t, Bureau of Ethnol ogy, Washingt on, 1883. ) A soul of life in man, animal, and vegetable was at one time held to be derived by the transformation and embodi ment of som e external force in animal gui se. Hence came the anima or soul of wind that was hum anized in breathing, whether as the soul of man or animal. At lengt h it was obs erved that a hum an soul of flesh was formed or embodi ed in the Mother - blood, as it was written in the secret Book of Nature. This was the earliest soul of man that was discreted from the external elements of life, which formed the rudi mentary and pre - hum an beings who are to be met with in the legends of the abor igines the whol e wo rld ove r. These were also know n to the Semites as pre - Adamic peopl e; the Adm u, the Kings of Edom , which brings us back to the Egypt ian root of the matter in the word Tum or Tem. Tem, we repeat, signi fies Manki nd, mortals created persons , which were created mystically from the soul of Adam in Hebrew, or Atum in Egypt ian, the earlier form of which name in the Ritual is “Tum .” The race of Tum , Atum , or Adm u identify their origin in nature, with the soul of blood by the Adamic name. And, sociologi cally, the “Cr eation of Man” qua man was a birth of Totemism. The creation of man in the Egypt ian genesis is late when measured by the mythol ogy. Atum represents the primal being who was the earliest evol ved as perfect man. As Sun - God he is designa ted Ra in his first so vereignt y, the solar mythos being last of all. This, with Atum as Supreme God in the human likeness, was preceded by the luna r and the stellar mythos ; by the Mother - earth and all her Elemental Pow ers. We shall freque ntly find the time - gauge of the past in Egypt when it is now here else recove rable on earth. The subj ect of the Hebrew beginni ngs is funda mentally the same, as will be seen when we can reach the root . It is the evol ution of the hum an race from the pre - hum an condi tions that were actual in nature and not, as alleged, the abor tions of a false belief. This was the subj ect dramatized, danced and taught in all the mysteries of gesture - langua ge and Totemic ceremoni es by means of which the unw ritten past was com memorated and indur ated by ceaseless repeti tion of the acted drama. The so - called Legends of Creation woul d be more correctly termed 87 the legend of hum an Evolution, although in a different sense from that of Darwinian developm ent. As Semite, they came to us in the latest and least genui ne form , with no clue to any true interpretation. In a Maori myth, Man was created by the God Tiki from red clay. This he kne aded with his ow n blood, or with red water from the swamps. Man is Atum in Egypt ian, Adm u in Assyrian, Adam in Hebrew; and this was the cr eation of the hum an Being discriminated from the preliminary and pre - hum an Beings of the Mythos and the Märchen in legenda ry lore. It was the soul of blood distingui shed from the earlier soul s or forces of the external elements, which were the six precedin g the hum an soul as supr eme one . The origins in mythol ogy are very natural unde rneath the mask. Inde ed, they are a hund redfold more natural than the pretende d expl anations of their mode rn misinterpreters. Primitive naturalists had onl y the light of nature for gui dance, and by this they went."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" The creation of man, or, as the earlier versions have it, of men and wom en, was mystical in one sense, in anot her it is Totemic. As before said, the history of the race might be roughl y divided into pre - Totemic and Tot emic, pre - hum an and hum an. This, when reflected in the mirror of Egypt ian Mythol ogy, is pre - Atum ic, or, in the Semitic version, pre - Adamic and Adamic. The same legend of a later origin for manki nd is also Mexican. When there were no hum an beings on the ear th certain of the low er pow ers solicited help from the supr eme gods in the work of creation, or of a re - beginni ng. They are instructed to collect the remains of the former race, and these will be vivified by the blood of the Gods . In this version the god w ho plays the part of Atum , Adam, or Belus procures a bone from the bur ial - place, and on this the gods drop the blood drawn from their ow n bodi es. Whereupon there is a new creation, namely, that of manki nd. (Mendi eta, Hist. Ecl. Ind. , p. 77. ) Here, as elsew here, the hum an soul of blood is derived from sour ce as male instead of from the earlier motherhood. So in the Book of Genesis the second creation of Adam is based upon the bon e called a rib which is extracted from the male. It is in Atum , the Son of Ptah , that man was perfected. In him the Matriarchate is com pletely supe rseded by the Father - Right or derivation from the Fatherhood. Now the change in the hum an descent from the Mother - blood to the Father - blood is obvi ous ly com memorated in the mysteries or ce remoni al rites of the Arunt a. In the ope ration of young - man - making two mode s of cutting are performed upon the boy by which he becom es a man and a tribal father. The first of these is com monl y know n as circum cision, or lartna, by the Arunt a; the other cere mony of initiation, which com es later, is the rite of sub - incision called ariltha. The second cutting is necessary for the com pletion of the perfect man. Inde ed, som e of the more stalwart young men undergo the cruel rite a second or even a third time (N.T. , p. 257.) to prove their manhood. With this trial - test the yout h becom es a man; a fathership is founde d, and, as certain custom s show , the Motherhood is in a measure cast off at the time or typically supe rseded by the fatherhood. Nature led the way for th e ope ning - rite performed upon the female, therefore we conc lude that this preceded the ope ration performed upon the men, and we 88 sugge st that this was a custom established, like that of couva de, in the cour se of com memorating the change from the Matria rchate to the Father - right . The rite is Inne r African. It is uni versally practised by the Fan (or Fang) Tribes. An unc ircum cised native is not cons idered as a man either for fight ing, working, or inhe riting, but is regarded as a none ntity and not allow ed to marry. The rite prove s the reality of manhood. (Nassau, Fetishism in West Africa, p. 12. ) We have previous ly traced the custom of couva de to Ptah, and now propos e to trace the rite of ariltha or sub - incision to the full - formed father Atum , who was his son. When the Arunt a perform the rite of sub - incision, which follow s that of the primary ope ration, a slit is cut in the penis right down to the root . The natives have no idea as to the origin of the practice. (N.T., p. 263 .) But as the practice prove s, it is performed as an assertion of manhood , and is a mode of making the boy into a man, or creating man. Now , at this time it was custom ary to cast the Motherhood aside by som e signi ficant action, that is at the time when the fathership is established in the initiation"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"ceremony. And in the Arunt a rite of sub - incision the ope rating Mura first of all cuts out an oval - shape d piece of skin (from the male member) which he flings away. (p. 257 .) The ova l shape is an emblem of the female all the world ove r, and this we take to be anot her mode of rejecting the mother and of attribut ing begettal to the father, as it was attribut ed in the creation by Atum - Ra, who was bot h male and female (as the one All - Parent). The hum an soul was preceded by the elemental forces of ext ernal nature which were typi fied in a tradition that is uni versal. The soul that follow ed these as hum an was then bor n of blood, at first of Mother - blood, the blood of Isis, which was follow ed by a creation from the Father - blood . In the Babyl oni an legend c onc erning the generation of manki nd attribut ed to Oanne s by Berosos, the beginni ng is with hideous beings in the abys s, which are described as hum an figures mixed with the shapes of beasts. “The person who was suppos ed to have presided ove r them was a wom a n named Omoroca.” This is the Great Mother who at first was Mother - earth. “Belus came and cut the woman asunde r,” which in Totemism is the dividing of the one wom an, or the type in two. At the same time he destroye d the animals in the abys s. Thus the pre - h um an period was succeeded by the Matriarchate and the two female Unga mbikul a, who in the Arunt a tradition cut and carved the rudi mentary creatures into Totemic men and wom en. Then Belus the deity “cut off his ow n head: upon which the other gods mixed the b lood with the earth; and from thence men were formed.” Thus the sour ce of life, or a soul of blood was change d from the female to the male deity who in the Egypt ian theology is Atum - Ra, or Tum, the image of created man, or of man who was created from the s oul of blood that is at first female and afterwards was fathered on the male. This creation of man or Tum is represented in the “Book of the Dead” (ch. XVII). The God, as Father, takes the Mother’s place; the Matriarchate terminates in the mythol ogy of Egy pt. Tum is described as giving birth to Hu and Sa, as the children of Him who now uni tes the Father with the Mother as divinity in one person. 89 Hu denot es matter, Sa (or Ka) signi fies spirit. This creation, then, is from blood and spirit; “the doubl e p rimitive essence” first assigne d to Ptah. The change from the Mother - blood to the Father - sour ce is the same in the Kamite legend as in the Semitic version, but the modus ope randi was different. Belus produc es the blood by cutting off his ow n head, whereas in the Ritual Father Atum draws the blood from the genitalia of a divine being who is bot h male and female blende d in the formation of the Father - Mother, from whom the soul of blood was now derivable. The drops of blood are described as issuing from the pe rson of Atum when he performed the rite of “sub - incision” or of mutilation on himself in the generation now attribut ed to the solar deity, cons idered to be male as well as female, or, finally, male instead of female. Thus the Arunt a are still performing a blood - cove nant in the rite of ariltha on the male which is attribut ed to Atum - Ra in the Egypt ian mythos and by which he demons trates the parentage of the children Hu and Sa, in the cour se of changi ng the descent from the Matriarchate to the Patriarchate. T he primitive essence of hum an life was blood derived from the female sour ce, with Nature herself for the witness. In the later biology it was derived from the “doubl e primitive essence” of Ptah that was cont inue d in Atum and his two children Hu and Sa. Thu s the"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"basis of being was shifted from the Mother - blood to that of blood and spirit assigne d to the Fatherhood. From the “cutting” of the male member now attributed to Atum - Ra we infer that the rite of circum cision and of sub - incision was a mode of show ing the derivation from the hum an father in supe rsession of the Motherhood , and that in the Arunt a doubl e - cutting the figure of the female was adde d to the member of the male. Nor is this sugge stion without corrobo ration. In his ethnol ogi cal studi es (p. 180 .) Dr. Roth expl ains that “in the Pitta - Pitta and cogna te Boul ia dialects the term Me - Ko ma - ro denot es “the man with a Vulva,” which show s that the ova l slit WAS cut upon the penis as a figur e of the female and a mode of assum ing the Motherhood. In the Hebre w Book of Genesis this carving of the female figure on the person of the male – in the second creation – has been given the legenda ry form of cutting out the wom an from the body of the male. Adam is thus imaged in the likeness of the biune Parent. The founda ti on of Jewish Monot heism was laid in the blood of the new cove nant which follow ed the cult of the female. It is not iceable that when the Jewish child is circum cised it is said of him that he is made to “enter into the cove nant of Abraham,” that is of the Gr eat Father in Israel. Moreove r, the man who stands spons or as the godf ather is called the Master of the Cove nant. (Godw yn, Moses and Aaron, p. 216. ) This may pos sibly expl ain the re - circum cising of the children of Israel. If, as the history asserts, they d edicated to the female in the earlier time and were afterwards circum cised in a cove nant made with the deity as God the father, re - circum cising woul d be a means of denot ing a change in the rite, when the peopl e were circum cised on the Hill of Foreskins. “A nd this is the cause why Joshua did circum cise” ( Joshua, ch. V, 2, 4). The two cove nants woul d thus tally with the two forms of the ceremony performed in first circum cision by the Arunt a and in sub - incision, which is re - circum cising in 90 the rites of th e same peopl e. Thus , there were two cove nants, one sealed in the blood of the female, one in the blood of the male, and bot h were appl ied to the deity according to the sex. This mode of affiliation to the male deity is likewise obvi ous in the legend of th e Guatemalans, who besought the Quiché God Tohi l to favour them with the element of fire. This he gave them on condi tion that they united themselves to him by drawing blood “beneath the girdle.” (Bancroft, V, 547 .) That is by drawing it from the membrum vi rile in a cove nant of blood. When they did this they received the fire from Heaven which was derived direct from God the father as begetter who was Atum - Ra in Egypt , and God the father in spirit as well as in flesh and blood. The cause of a mystical relat ions hip that was recogni zed between man and the animals may now be traced on grounds less lofty than that of the suppos ed divine incarnations , and more natural than that of an animistic interfusion which led to a conf usion of identity and persona lity. The animals were first recogni zed as pow ers in themselves, but they were also adopt ed as the living visible sym bol s of elemental pow ers that were supe rior to the hum an as a means of representing natural phe nom ena. They were further adopt ed into the hum an famil y as Totemic type s with religious rites that gave them all the sanctity of the blood - cove nant and made them typically of one flesh"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"with the hum an brothers. Thus they were doubl y adopt ed; and this led to their becom ing later living fetishes as the naturaliz ed representatives of supe rhum an pow ers, though not as the direct obj ect of hum an worship. The life - tie assum ed between Totemic man and the Totemic animal or zoot ype was cons cious ly assum ed, and we can perceive by what process and on what ground the assum p tion was made. The zoot ype being adopt ed as a badge of distinction, the primeval coat of arms, it was a custom for the hum an beings to enter into a brotherhood of blood. That is, the men who were not born of the same mother, or of two sisters, coul d extend the natural tie of blood by a typi cal rite to others who were bor n of different mothers. In this way, the larger kin, clan, or tribe was formed on the basis of brotherhood unde r som e totemic sign. Now if the animal becom es of kin to the hum an brother by v irtue of a cove nant intentiona lly made in the blood of both, that prove s the kinship did not exist before. The relationship did not spring from any root in nature, or any false belief, but was ordained for the pur pos e, and is cons eque ntly limited to the pa rticular beast and brotherhood. The bul l is onl y kinsman to thos e whom he serves as a Totem, an image of the ancestor and a type of the fraternity. So is it with all the other zoot ype s which had been employe d from before the time when the indi vidua l father hood was know n. There is no necessary conf usion of identity. If men had abstained from eating the animals on the ground of kinship and intercom muni on of nature, because of a conf usion or identification of themselves with the beasts, they ought to have abst ained from eating any, whereas they ate them all in turn, exceptions being made solely on the artificial ground of the Totemic motherhood or brotherhood. The beast onl y became of the “same flesh” with the particular family because it had been adopt ed as th eir Totem, ancestral animal, or foster - brother of the blood - covenant, and 91 not on account of any belief that they descende d from this or the other non - hum an parent with a different proge nitor for every separate group. Even in the hum an relations hip the being “of one flesh” show s that the system represents a later extension of the same family that first derived from one mother, the mode of extension being by the blendi ng of blood, the re - birth, the drinking of the cove nant, and eating of the fetish. But there was not hing prom iscuous in this arrange ment, which had been made on pur pos e to avoi d promiscuity. They did eat, and did not tolerate being eaten by, each other’s Totems. The relations hip of men with beasts was most deliberately adopt ed, and the partn ership was held with the strictest regard to the law of limited liability. Thus the blood - brotherhood with the beasts was not based on any belief that they were on a level with the human being, nor on any mental conf usion respecting their one ness of nature . At least it was not that which first rende red the animals tabu, or made them sacred to men. The typi cal character of the Totemic animal was cont inue d in various ways; put ting on the skin was a mode of assimilating the wearers to the pow ers beyond the be ast, the supe rhum an forces which the animals represented in visible sym bol ry. Hence on goi ng to battle they wore the skins and acted the rôle of the animals, birds, and reptiles, as their link of alliance with the supe rhum an nature - pow ers that were ove r al l. In like manne r the God Shu, the warrior of the gods , the Egypt ian Mars, doe s battle whilst wearing the supe rhum an pow er of the Lione ss on his head — and the moon - god , Taht - Aan, is clothed with the pow er of the great Ape, the ideogr aph of supe rhum an rage, when"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"he fight s against the demons of darkne ss by night on behalf of the suffering Solar God. The mage or medicine - man was wrappe d up in the skin of the Totemic beast for the pur pos e of com muni ng with the spirits of the dead. Thus the trance, the transforme r, and the transformation, the beast, the nature - pow er, and the hum an ghos t, got mixed up toge ther. Such being the fact, it is easy to identify the founda tion of the faith of igno rant belief that the medicine - men had everyw here the pow er of transforming in to wolves, hyæ nas, or tigers themselves; and that belief woul d cause the fear lest they shoul d appl y this pow er of metamorphos is to others, and ultimately create a belief in their pow er to transform hum an beings into animal shapes. The only veritable pow er of metamorphos is pos sessed by the ancient medicine - men or mages, the witches or wizards, was that of induc ing the condi tion of trance either in others or in themselves. This was and is a fact in Nature with which the primitive races were profoundl y well a cqua inted. But thos e who are ignor ant of such phe nom ena will be apt to mistake a surface appe arance for the unde rlying reality, and must find it difficult, if not impos sible, to distingui sh between the true cause and a false belief. In the mysteries they c hange d place and shape and nature with the beasts of prey. They masked themselves in the skins of animals, reptiles, and birds, and sat at feast in thos e forms to devour the sacrifice when the Totemic animal was slain for the Eucharistic rite. In that way they transformed and were said to change themselves into wolves or tigers, bears or crocodi les, to partake of this most primitive rite of transubs tantiation. For it did 92 becom e a religious ceremony and a mode of entering into alliance and com muni on wit h the pow ers first apprehende d as supe rhum an. When the gha stly, grim reality had passed into the legenda ry pha se we are told, as Plato tells us in the Republ ic, that thos e who ate of the hum an sacrifices offered to the Wolf were transformed into wolves. He rodot us likewise relates that the Neurian wizards change d themselves into wolves for a few days onc e a year. First, the men who ate the flesh of the Beast had change d themselves into wolves to eat it, according to the mode of masking. Next it was said that by eating hum an flesh men woul d becom e Were - wolves, and lastly we have the Were - wolf as a man who is suppos ed to turn into the wolf on pur pos e to devour hum an flesh. Such are the tricks of typol ogy, based on the primitive simplicity and the agnos tic misin terpretation of later times when the mythos passes into the fable which depos its these type s of the were - wolf, the mermaid, the cockatrice, the serpent - wom an, the vampire, or the ghoul . In the latest pha se of this transformation and transubs tantiation it i s the flesh of a suppos ed historical persona ge that is eaten and his blood that is drunk with the view of effecting a transformation into Horus or the Christ. It was a masque rade; but the men beneath the masks originally kne w that they were acting in chara cters which they themselves had created. They wore skins in a typi cal transformation; they clothed or tattooe d themselves with the signs of supe rhum an pow ers for a definite pur pos e, and not because they were returning to the condi tion of beasts from which they came, or expe cted to be saved by doi ng so. The masking and metamorphos is were but mode s of the mysteries which include d the mystery of Trance. This primitive drama is not yet played out . The rites and doc trines are also to be identified at times as su rvivals in religious ritual. A startling"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"illustration may be seen in a collection of Engl ish hym ns (1754) , where these lines occur: — “What greater glory could there be Than to be clothed with God? He drew His skin upon my skin, His blood upon my blood.” The skin is likewise assum ed by the Manes as their Totem in the other life, different ideas being expr essed by different kinds of skin. In the Ritual (ch. 145 , 31) the speaker who has just been baptized and anoi nted in process of r egeneration when he transforms into the likeness of Horus the adul t says he has the skin of a Cat for his badge . The cat being a seer in the dark, the skin show s that he is no longe r as the sight less Horus, but is the Horus with the second sight or beatifi c vision. With the Red Indi ans the skin of the Totemic animal is placed at the side of a man who is dead or dyi ng. It has also been stuffed at times and hung above the grave. The sign is the same for the dead man as for the dead animal. In each instance th e skin means renewal, repetition, resurrection for anot her life. It has been a com mon custom for the dead to be bur ied in the skin of an animal, or in shoe s or boot s made from the skin of an animal. When Field - Marshal the Duke of Wellingt on was bur ied in S t. Paul’s Cathedral his boot s were taken with him to the tom b, and in a sense he was bur ied in the skin. The signi ficance of the skin is everyw here the 93 same. The slippe r throw n after the newly - wedde d has the same meaning. Leather is made from the skin that denot es a renewal of life, and the act expr esses the desire for the coupl e to be blest with children. We have seen that the skin was equi valent to the animal as a type of renewal. This may afford us a clue to the custom of swearing oaths in making co venants on the skin, which woul d be like swearing by the future life, the hope of immortality, or “by the eternal God. ” The earliest masks were formed of the head and skin of the Totemic zoot ype . They also represented the invi sible pow ers, and finally beca me the heads of godde sses and gods . Masks were assum ed when deities or spirits were represented in the mysteries. Thus , when a mask is put on by the Inoit girl at the time of her first menstrualia it denot es the presence of the Nature - pow er that reveals it self in this particular way as one of the mysteries of Nature. The masks that were worn in certain mysteries were derived from the Totemic zoot ype s, not from the hum an face. Hence their supe rhum an ugl iness at times. These masks were used as por traits of th e pow ers beyond the Totem, and in the Inoi t mysteries, when the cont rolling spirit of a Shaman was cons ulted, it was custom ary for the mask which represented the particular pow er invoke d to be laid upo n the Shaman’s face, and this mask was the skin of a vi ctim that mom ent killed. (Réclus, Prim. Folk, Eng. tr., p. 87.) A tribe of the hill - men near Darjeeling, in Indi a, still retain the huge and hideous masks that represent the pow ers of Nature. These are worn on the heads of priests when performing their ela bor ate religious rites. One of these images the god who looks after their spears and helps to drive them hom e. Which show s the character of the masks as effigies of the Nature - pow ers is not forgot ten. (Paragraph and picture in the London Daily Mail, Nov. 2 0, 1896 .) We have seen that the change made by the young girl into an animal at pube rty was an origin of"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"wearing the mask. This we assum e to have been primary. Next, the practice was cont inue d in Matriarchal Totemism. Then the custom s of cutting in sub - inc ision, of wearing the skin, and of becom ing the Totemic beast, are appl ied to the male in the later mysteries of young - man - making. The Totemic mysteries survived as eschatologi cal in the Osirian religion. For example, when Horus the child, who was bor n of the Mother onl y, unde r the divine Matriarchate, makes his transformation into Horus the adul t, who rises from the dead in Amenta, it is in the character of the Anoi nted son of the Father. Anoi nting had then becom e the mode of show ing the Glory of the Fath er in the person of the Son. This was imaged with the holy oil upon the face of Horus. He who had been Horus the mortal in the flesh, is now Horus in spirit persona lized and established as the Anoi nted Son. The typi cal Anoi nted originated as the yout h who was made a man of at the period of pube rty, at which time the Mother’s child assum ed the likeness of the father at the time of his Totemic rebirth. The boy who was initiated into the mysteries of the Australian Blacks was equa lly made the Anoi nted in how ev er primitive a fashion. When his proba tion terminated, and the stringe nt rules of his novi tiate were relaxed, he was rubbe d by an old man with fat that was taken from the Totemic animal which was previous ly forbidde n food. He 94 was not permitted to eat the female of any animal, nor the emu, that primordial Mother - Totem, and he becom es a free man by having the fat of the animal smeared ove r his face. In fact he is made a figur e of the Anoi nted. The Kurnai yout h was made a free man of when anoi nted with fa t. With the Adamanese the bodi es of the initiates are smeared ove r with the melted fat of por k and turtle in the ceremony of free - man - making. (E. H. Man, Abor iginal Inhabi tants of the Andam an Islands , p. 62. ) The boy was anoi nted when he made his change in to the adul t. Horus was anoi nted when he transformed from the mortal Horus to the Horus in spirit who rose again from the dead. And this anoi nting is still practised in the extreme unc tion of the Rom an Cathol ic rite that is adm inistered when the dyi ng are about to pass into the future life. This again correlates with, and is a survival of, the abor iginal custom of placing a lum p of fat in the mout h of the dead, by which act they were made into a form of the Anoi nted preparatory to their resurrection. The mu mmies exhum ed at Deir el - Bahari show that the faces had been painted and anoi nted for burial. “The thick coats of colour which they still bear are com pos ed of ochre, carmine (or pounde d brick) and animal fat.” (Maspero, Daw n of Civilisation, Eng. tr., p. 5 4, not e 5.) These are also forms of the Anoi nted One, who was made so by extreme unc tion more primitively appl ied to Osiris the Karast - Mum my. The art of Tattooi ng was likewise a Totemic mode of Sign - langua ge. This also corrobor ates the feminine origin of the signs , as when som e of the abor igines such as the Ainu of Japan, and the Siberian Chukc hi, onl y tattooe d their wom en. “Tattoo the wom en and not the men,” is the com mand that was given in the Wisdom of Manihiki. The Totem is som etimes tattooe d on the pe rson of the clansman, as it was by the Iroquoi s, the Ojibw ays, and other tribes of the Red Men. The Indi ans of San Juan Capistrano practised a peculiar mode of tattoo. A figur e of the persona l Totem was made of crushed herbs on the right arm of the novi ce. The paste was then set on fire and the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"figur e of the Totem burned into the flesh. At an earlier stage before the art of tattoo had been mastered it was the custom to cut the flesh and raise cicatrices to pattern. This was especially practised by the Austr alian abor igines, and the tribal badge s thus figured in the flesh were som etimes representations of the Totem. ( Kam ilaroi and Kurnai , by Fison and How itt, p. 66.) Herbert Ward, who suffered the ceremony of establishing the cove nant of blood - brotherhood wit h Mata Mwiki, a Banga la chief, in 1886, found that the skin of the Banga las was tattooe d or slashed and cicatriced in conf ormity with the Totemic or tribal pattern and that the patterns varied with the different tribes. (Herbert Ward, Five Years with the C ongo Canni bal s, 1890 .) The Esqui maux indi cate the particular Inoi t tribe by different ways of trimming the hair; the wom en by the figures tattooe d on their faces. The Aleuts at one time tattooe d the figur es of birds and fishes upon their skins. The wom en t old Hall that they tattooe d their faces as a mark of high distinction. It was so, as a sign of wom anhood. The custom of tattooi ng the Totemic toke n upon the body may be traced in survival through all 95 the later mysteries as a mode of identifying the in itiates with their particular com munity. It is more than proba ble that the habit of the ancient Britons mentione d by Rom an writers in staining their bodi es with woad really refers to the system of Totemic Tattoo, as is indi cated by the description of the P icts found in Claudi an’s De Bello Getico (XXIV, 417 - 18) , “ferroque not atas por legit exam ines Picto moriente figur as.” This is show n by an initial letter in the Book of Kells — a facsimile of which has been publ ished by the Palæogr aphi cal Society, cont aining the figur e of a man qui te naked, the body being cove red all ove r with signi ficant marks just as the hierogl yphi cs are described by Boece, who affirms that in “all their secret bus iness the ancient Britons wrote with cyphe rs and figur es of beasts made in ma nne r of letters” which he identifies with the hierogl yphi cs of Egypt . Thus the woad - bedaube d men stigm atized as savages becom e the more intelligent illustrators of Totemic times and custom s who wore the stigm ata of Tattoo, and the Picts or painted men are the men who carried the Totemic marks either painted or brande d on the living book of their ow n bodi es. They were not merely dye ing their flesh for decoration, but making figur es for use that coul d be read by others at sight . Even the raising of cicatrices in the flesh which preceded tattooi ng was an Egypt ian custom . On the bas - reliefs of the Temples at Philæ and Ombos the bos om s of godde sses and que ens are scored with long incisions which, starting from the circum ference, uni ted in the centre round the nip ple of the breast. (Maspero.) In Totemism the Mother and Motherhoods , the Sisters and Sisterhoods , the Brothers and Brotherhoods , the girl who transformed at pube rty, the Mother who was eaten as a sacrifice, the two wom en who were ancestresses, were all o f them Hum an, all of them actual, in the dom ain of natural fact. But when the same characters have been cont inue d in mythol ogy , they are supe rhum an. The Mother and Motherhoods , the Sisters and Sisterhoods , the Brothers and Brotherhoods , have been divinized . The realities of Totemism have suppl ied the type s to mythol ogy as godde sses and gods that wear the heads or skins of beasts to denot e their character. The Mother, as hum an in Totemism, was know n as the Water - Cow , and this became a type that was cont inue d , not the hum an Mother. The Mother as first person in the hum an family was first person in the Totemic"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"sociology. Thence came the Great Mother in mythology who was fashione d in the Matriarchal moul d. But with this difference: it is the hum an Mother unde rne ath the mask in Totemism. It is not the hum an Mother who was divinized as the Great Provi der in mythol ogy. Totemism is not derived from mythol ogy, but it has been mixed up with it because the same Sign - langua ge was employe d in bot h. Thus , the Mother was hu man in the mask of Totemism and is supe rhum an in the mask of mythogr aphy . This was the Great Mother who was the First Person, as the “only one ,” according to the Egypt ian Wisdom . They were not seven hum an mothers or sisters who were cons tellated in the fi elds of Heaven as seven Hathor s or seven Cow s. These were the Mothers of food , who were givers of life in the form 96 of the Cow , when the Seven Stars in Ursa Major suppl ied the num erical figur e of Plenty. Thus there are two kinds of Motherhoods that hav e to be most carefully discriminated one from the other; the first is human, the last is superhum an. The hum an Mother might be represented by or as the Totemic cow , serpent, frog, or vul ture. Nevertheless they were not hum an Mothers who were divinized in t hos e same likenesses as the Egypt ian godde sses Isis, Rannut , Hekat, and Neith. But the hum an Mother who was eaten at the sacramental meal did suppl y a type of the supe rhuman Mother in external nature, who also gave herself as a vol unt ary sacrifice for hum a n food and sustenance; the Mother of life in death who furnished the Eucharist that was eaten in the religious mysteries. The hum an Mother had been an actual victim, eaten as a sacrifice. The supe rhum an Mother or godde ss was eaten typically, or by proxy. H ence she who was the giver of food and life to the world came to be eaten sacramentally and vicarious ly, that is, in som e Totemic victim, by whos e death her sacrifice was sym bol ically represented. There were different type s of the sacrificial victim at di fferent stages of the Eucharist. At one stage it was the Red Calf as the type of Horus, the child. At anot her it was Osiris as the Bull or Ox. The victim, speaking in the Book of the Dead, exclaims, “I am the Bull of the sacrificial herd” who identifies hi s body with the “mortuary meal.” But in Egypt the Great Mother was eaten as the Cow that represented the godde ss Hathor or Isis; also as the Sow which represented the godd ess Shaat or Rerit; two of the type s that were figures of the Great Mother who thus g ave her body and blood for hum an food that was eaten as a vol unt ary sacrifice of her ow n maternal self. Herodo tus not withstandi ng, the cow had been a type of sacrifice in Egypt . Moreove r, it was the Red Cow or Red Heifer, the same as in the Hebrew Ritual. As already show n, the Mother - type s and Totems were primary and the Red Cow was a type of the Blood - Mother from the time when she was the Red Water - cow of the first Mother Apt, who was succeeded by Hathor , as the Milch - Cow . It is som etimes difficult to dis tingui sh between the hum an Mother in Totemism and the Great Mother in Mythol ogy, because the same type s were employe d for bot h. Besides which, as Earth was the bringe r - forth of all living things , she was also a Mother to the hum an race in com mon with the o ther forms and elements of life. For instance, as the bringe r - forth of life she was the Mother of animal food ; the giver of grass - seed; of tube rs and plants in the soil, and of food in the fruitful tree. As the"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Crocodi le, the Serpent, the Goos e, the Emu, o r the Witchetty - Grub, she was the layer of the egg, and thus a Mother to be ultimately divinized as the Great Mother who was supe rhum an, in the Kamite Mythol ogy; Apt, the Hippopot amus; Rerit, the Sow ; Neith, the Crocodi le; Rannut , the Serpent; Uati, the Pa pyrus; Hathor , the Fruit - tree; Isis, the Field. The hum an Mother was the suckler of her children. This image of Maternity was likewise given to the Earth as the Nursing - mother, who was the giver of liquid life in water. But the Earth as wet - nur se or layer of the egg for food coul d not be so directly rende red. Hence the need of Sign - langua ge in the mythical repre - 97 sentation of supe rhum an phe nom ena. The hum an Mother had brought forth her children in the forest and from the cave in the rock; in cons eque nc e of which, as natural fact, the tree and the hol e in the stone , or the ground, have each cont inue d ever since to represent the hum an birth - place in the image of the female figur ed as the supe rhum an Mother, the Great Mother - earth. It was not the hum an Moth er that was the obj ect of worship or of propi tiation with the offering of blood. This was the typi cal Mother; the Great or pregna nt Mother; the Mother of food and sustenance; the Mother who for ages on ages was not imaged in the hum an shape because she was supe rhum an. In mode rn phraseology the primitive “seekers after God” were seekers after food and drink and phys ical sustenance. The Giver of these elements was the Earth itself, or herself, when depicted in the image of the Mother as the Nurse of life. No thing simpler has been recove red from the past than the religious system of the Arunt a Tribes of Central Australia, who, in their sacred rites, are self - por trayed as seekers after food . An impor tant ceremony, that was designe d to bring success in kanga roo - hunt s, cons isted in the letting of blood. Thus the blood was an offering to secure plenty of food. (N.T., p. 193 , not e.) In certain of the Intichium a ceremoni es blood is pour ed out freely as an offering on behalf of food. These ceremoni es are performed for the purpos e of insuring the increase of the animal or plant which gives its name to the Totem, the emu, the beetle, the kangaroo, or others. The blood was pour ed out on the earth as an obl ation to the Earth - mother, even though she was onl y represented by the Emu - bird. The earliest religion, so to call it, was a cultus of the Mother who was propi tiated as the “Only One” who was in the beginni ng. This was the primal provi dence or provi der as the Great Mother, the Mother - earth, who was invoke d with offerings of blood for food and drink. In Egypt she was given several characters. She was Abt; Khebt, or Ta - Urt, the Hippopot amus - headed; Rerit, or Shaat, the many - teated Sow ; Hathor , the Cow ; Rannut , the Serpent - wom an, and others related to the phe nom ena of externa l nature as the sour ce of life, of food and water. The root of the whol e matter was fecundi ty, and the godde ss, who in later times was called the Mother of love in Egypt , originated in the giver of plenty as the godde ss of fecundi ty. But the fecundi ty at first was that of Earth, the provider of food and drink. Hence, she was imaged by the Suckler who gave the image of life as Shaat the Sow , or Hathor the Cow . At this stage that which has been so often generalized by the phr ase “Phallic worship” was propi ti ation of what we call Mother Nature=Mother - earth divinized, or idealized as supe rhum an in the likeness of the large - udde red Cow or the multimammalian Sow , which were figures in a cult of fecundi ty; the first and foremost"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"obj ect of the “worship” being the f ood and drink that were suppl ied by the Mother - earth who gave her life in sacrifice that men might live. The Mother - earth, Dhur teemah, is still the primordial deity with the Byga h tribes of Seone e, Indi a. They offer food to her as provi der at every meal b efore they call on any other god or 98 godde ss. With the Babyl oni ans Nin - Ki - Gal, the Great Lady, is anot her form of the Earth - Mother. As Miss Kings ley show s, this primitive Earth - Mother of African origin still survives in Africa as the Earth - Godde ss Nzam bi, the Great Mother. There is “aye a som ething” that show s the stage of the beginni ng is still extant as Inne r African, from which the thought and sym bol ism of Egypt were develope d. In her account of “Fetish” according to different school s Miss Kings ley t ells us the Earth - Godde ss Nzambi is the paramount feature in the “Fetishtic” religion. “She is the Great Mother.” “Round her circle almost all the legends , in her lies the ultimate hum an hope of help and protection, or, in mode rn phr ase, salvation. ” (Kings ley, M. H., West African Studies, pp. 154, 155 .) Previous ly the same writer had said “the school of Nkissi is mainly conc erned with the worship of the mystery of the Pow er of Earth; Nkissi - nsi.” (Kings ley, West African Studi es, p. 137. ) Now “the mystery o f the pow er of earth,” or Nkissi - nsi, as Egyp tian, is expr essed by the word Kep, which is a name of the old Earth - Mother, Ta - Urt. The word Kep signi fies mystery, to be mysterious ; the mystery of fermentation, the mystery of fertilization, and of water as t he sour ce of life. This is as it was in Africa from the first; and as it was in the beginni ng so it remained in Egypt , allow ing for developm ent, to the last, for Apt, the old first Mother - earth, survives in the eschatology of the Ritual, still keeping her hippopot amus form, as “the Mistress of divine protections ” and rekindl er of the light of life from the spark when it had gone out in the dark of death. Thus , she who had brought to birth as the Mother - earth lived on as the bringe r to rebirth for anot her li fe in the pha se of eschatology. (Renouf , Book of the Dead, ch. 137 A , 137 B , not es. Also Vigne tte in Nebseni.) The old first great mother, then, one of whos e names is Khebt, was the Mother - earth in her primary character, and if we go back far enough we find the type is uni versal. The Mother - earth gave birthpl ace and food to all the children bor n of her. Isis, represented as the Sekhe t or field, was still the Mother - earth. With the Algonki ns, Mother - earth was the great grandm other of all. Mamapacha, worshippe d by the Peruvi an tribes, was the Mother - earth. Follow ing the pathetically - primitive custom of ceremoni ally eating the mother in honour , as the first giver of food, a cult emerges from the dar kness of the pas t upon the way to worship; the worship of the M other with young , who was the pregna nt, therefore the great, Mother. This was a cult of suppl ication, propitiation, and thankf ulness for food and liqui d life, which made its offerings to the Mother - earth as the provi der of plenty. Mother - earth is the Great Mother of the Moqui Indi ans, “Our Grandm other” with the Shawnees, and the Grandm other of the Karens in Burmah. Tari - Pennu is the Mother - earth to the Khonds of Orissa. The Finni sh godde ss, cons ort of Ukko, is the Mother - earth; Ops was the Rom an Earth - Mothe r, whom we look on as a form of the Egypt ian godde ss"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Apt, or Ap. The ancient Germans worshippe d Mother Hertha, who is identical by name with the 99 earth, and also with Ta - Urt, the Egypt ian Mother - earth. There was a primitive kind or class of peopl e know n as earth - bor n abor igines, like the San of the Khoi - Khoi and the Chinese Miau - tze. These children of earth who came forth from the forest and the cave woul d naturally be divided first for recogni tion in two categor ies as the Children of the Tree and the R ock, which are spoke n of by Hesiod as the two origins of mortals, bot h tree and rock being representatives of the earth as birthplace. This cult of the Earth - worshippe rs may account for the Earth - eaters, who still survive in Africa and also with the Indi an s of California. The tradition is com mon with the peopl e of several count ries that they issued originally from the ground. But to restore the lapsed meaning we have to read Earth for ground , and then identify the earth with one of her type s as the Mother o f all, who is the Great Mother in mythol ogy. According to S. Pow ers, the Californian Indi ans think that their Prairie - Dog ancestors were moul ded directly from the soil. If so, they have lost the clue which survives in mythol ogy. The Coyot e as a bur row er in the ground is a type of the Mother - earth that was made the totem of the Coyot e Indi ans. The birth of the hum an race from the Mother - earth is indicated bot h directly and indi rectly in the legends of the Kaffirs. In these men issued from the ground , from th e cleft in the rock, or a bed of reeds. Others say that Unkul unkul u split them out of a stone . It is still said of a great chief by the Zulus that he was not bor n; he was belched up by a Cow . The Cow , like the clove n stone , or the tree, was a female type o f the Mother - earth. Thus represented, the earth becom es a rock, from which issued the race of men, or in the words of Isaiah, it is the rock whence they were hewn (ch. LI, 1) and the hole of the pit from whence they were digge d. Also, as the rock was a typ e of the earth, the Great Mother, we can see how and wherefore in a follow ing stage the stone pillar or the hol e - stone shoul d becom e a figur e of the mythical Genetrix as it was of Hathor and the Paphi an Venus ; and why the stone seat shoul d be an emblem of the Earth - Mother Isis as a figure of founda tion. With the Bushm en the Earth - Mother has becom e the typi cal “Old Wom an” of later langua ge. Earth as the supe rhum an Mother is denot ed in the Quiché legend in which it is said the hum an race descende d from a cave - dw elling wom an or female. Cave, pit, and cavern were the uterus, so to say, of Mother - earth as the place of com ing forth, the Unnu, or ope ning of Neith; the Ununa it of Hathor as the solar birthpl ace. Very naturally the mount was typi cal of Mother - earth in which the cave was a place of birth for man and beast. “The citizens of Mexico and thos e of Tlatelolco were wont to visit a hill called Cacatepec, because, as they said, it was their Mother” (Bancroft). Molina states that the principal sacred place or Hua ca of the Mexican Yncas was that of the hill Huanacauri, from whence their ancestors were held to have com menced their journey (Spencer, Data of Soc iology , ch. XXIV, 186 ). The mount with the cave in it was a natural figur e of the Mother - earth to the Trogl o dites who were bor n and there came to cons cious ness. When the Navajos 100 "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"issued from the wom b (euphe mistically from the bow els) of a great mount ain near the San Juan River, that mount ain is an image of the Mother - earth. The Oneida, Ojibw ay, and Dacotah Indi ans, who claim derivation from a sacred stone , at the same time trace their descent from the mount ain of the race. Naturally, the cave as birthpl ace of the Earth - Mother was identified with the uterine abode . We might say identified by it, that is by t he emblem scrawled upon the rock from time immemorial. This figure, or similitude of the female, called the sym bol of wickedne ss “in all the land” by Zechariah (ch. V, 8), portrayed through all the world, has ever been most prom inent in the primitive art o f the abor igines from Africa to Australia. Not as an obj ect of worship, nor of degradation, but as a likeness of the human abode depicted in the birthpl ace of the Cavemen. The superhum an type of the motherhood appe ars in sym bol ism as the Cleft, the Gap, th e Cave, as well as the Tree, the Sow , the Water - Cow , Crocodi le, Lione ss, and other zoot ype s. The hum an mother com es into view by means of her emblem, the hieroglyphi c Ru or door of life in the divinized motherhood as the Vesica Piscis of later iconogr aphy . There is no getting out side of nature, either in the beginni ng or in the end. With the Arunt a tribes of Central Australia a gor ge among the hills at som e local totem - centre is identified as the place of emanation from the Earth - Mother. This is exactly in keeping with the Gorge of Neith, whence issued the “youngl ings of Shu” as spirits of breathing - force. Local tradition tells that at the Emily Gap, near to Alice Springs , “certain Witchetty - Grubs became transformed into Witchetty - Men” (N.T., p. 123 ). Otherw ise stated, the elemental soul s passed into the mothers of that ilk to be specialised in the hum an form instead of becom ing animal, bird, or reptile. If we take Hathor as the abode of birth, that is, the Mother - earth as the birthpl ace and the bringe r - forth of life, the stone or coni cal pillar of Hathor was a type of this birthpl ace. Now , let us turn for a mom ent to the Erathipa - stone of the Arunt a for the proof that the stone with an ope ning in it was a Totem of the Mother - earth, the stone out of which the Zulus say the hum an race was split in the beginni ng. There is no mistaking the nature of the Arunt a stone . It is a representative image of the Mother in the very simplest form. According to the tradition, spirit - children issue from a hol e in the Erathipa - s tone . Over this aperture a black band is painted with charcoal. This com pletes that figur e of the female which has been por trayed in all the earth as a sym bol of the hum an mother appl ied to her who was externalized as the supe rhum an mother, the primeval bi rthpl ace. The Fijian pillar - stone s were girdled round the waist with the primitive Cestus or Liku of hair, to typi fy pube scence and identify the motherhood. It is com mon for the Tree to be draped in female attire and hung with feminine ornaments, as when t he Israelite wom en wove hangi ngs for the Asherah. Two female figur es of stone and wood are to be found not onl y in the Arunt a Chur inga , but at the head of all hum an descent and all the “stock - and - stone ” worship of the world. They are recogni zed by Hom er wh en Penelope says to Ulysses, “Tell me thy lineage, and whence 101 thou art, for thou dos t not spring from the ancient Tree nor from the Rock” ( Odyss. 19, 163) , meaning that he must be an immortal, whereas these are two type s of an origin that is of the e arth. Hesiod also ( Theog. 30, 35) speaks of the Tree and Rock as being amongs t the mysteries of the beginni ng pertaining to the ever - living, blest immortals. The earlier"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"name of the chief sanctuary in Israel, called Bethel, was Luz, or the Almond Tree. Bet hel was the place of the stone - pillar, as the abode of the God, and Luz, the locality of the Tree. These, we repeat, are two primary and uni versal type s of the feminine abode , represented by the Two Wom en in Australia and the Two Divine Sisters in Egypt . T hey are classed toge ther also as obj ects of abhor rence in the later casting out of the primitive type s. “Woe unt o them that saith to the Wood Awake! to the dum b stone . Arise!” in the making of idols (Hab. II, 19). “The Stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it” (Hab. II, 11) . The wood and stone of the Australian Chur inga , which are Totemic type s, are excom muni cated in Israel as idol s when they were no longe r unde rstood as sym bol s. They came to be looke d upon as deities in themselves, set up for worship. Both Cæsar and Lucanus state that the gods of the Gauls were pillar - stone s and tree - trunk s. Nevertheless, these were not the gods . In Egypt bot h the Pillar and Tree were pedestals for the gods , and bot h were blende d in th e tree - pillar, or Tat of Ptah. As images of the Mother both were the Beth or abode , as Bringe r - forth of the Divinity or Spirit which was the obj ect of worship, as was the God of Jacob in the Coni cal Pillar and of Horus in the Tree. These two primordial and uni versal type s of origin are coupl ed toge ther in Logi on V. of the logoi ihsou (p. 12) . “Raise the Stone , and there thou shalt find me; cleave the wood, and there am I.” To raise the stone is to erect an altar. The Wood is one with the Tree. The Stone was raised and the Tree prepared for worship, because they were type s of the Divine Abode , which represented the Two Wom en or Sisters who were the Two Mothers or Bringe rs - forth of the Race in the beginni ng. The perception that life was bor n of the Earth must have been as primordial as it was natural, and that which brings to birth is the Mother. Thus the race of hum an beings , in com mon with the animals, was bor n of Mother - earth. In Central Africa the natives claim that they came from a hol e in the rock (Duff M acdona ld). It is indeed a com mon African tradition. The stone or rock crops up cont inua lly as an emblem of the Earth or solid ground. The Earth itself was brought to a poi nt and focussed in the ceremoni al stone on which the offering was made. For instance, when the members of the Hakea - flow er Totem perform their mystery to solicit food, one of the young men ope ns a vein in his arm and lets the liquid flow ove r the ceremoni al stone unt il it is entirely cove red with blood . A rock near Goua m, in the Marcian Is lands , is locally regarded as the ancestor of the hum an race. The African birthplace denot ed by the rock of earth and the forest - tree is indi cated by the tradition of the Ovaherero which relates that Men were bor n from the Omum bor ombonga Tree, and that she ep and goa ts issued from a flat rock. (Reiderbecke, Rev. H., Missionar y Labour s, p. 263 .) Now , the Great Godde ss who was “worshippe d” with the gor y 102 rites of many lands originated as the Mother - earth who was fertilized with blood, and with the definit e obj ect of procuring food . This was the supe rhum an Mother who gave her ow n life in food, and to whom blood was offered as a propi tiatory sacrifice for sustenance. Also in this rite the blood was pour ed out freely on the earth itself, as life for life. The Intichium a ceremoni es of the Arunta amply show that hum an blood was pour ed out on the earth as a sacrificial offering for food. Plenty of blood was shed for plenty of food. It was a mode of magical invoc ation that is still practised in the mysteries of bl ack magic for the evoc ation of spirits. Food was the supr eme obj ect sought by primitive folk,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"and the giver of food and drink was propi tiated and besought for more. This was naturally the Mother — the Mother - earth; the Mother in the water, in the tree, in th e animals that were eaten. Hence the Intichium a ceremoni es of the Arunt a are still performed for the increase of the animal or plant which gives its type (or name) to the Totem. “The sole obj ect of these ceremoni es is that of increasing the total food supp ly.” ( Native Tribes, p. 169. ) The Arunta of the Emu - totem pour out their blood lavishly upon the earth in asking for plenty of Emu, an image of which is painted on the ground to be deluge d with blood. On the other hand, the men of the Witchetty - Grub totem, in praying for food , will paint their totem on the body of each man in red ochre, which is a local subs titute for blood . Then they represent the mystery of transformation, from matter to spirit, from death to life, and await the emergence of the fully - dev elope d insect from the cocoon of the chrysalis (N.T., pp. 175 - 6). In the one case blood was offered actually, in the other sym bol ically, but in bot h it was offered for cont inuance and increase of food . Thus the Intichium a ceremony is a festival celebrated for the increase of food , especially of the totem that was eaten solemnly at the thanks giving meal. Also the Corrobor ee of prom iscuous intercour se takes place at this festival of invoc ation for plenty of food. And the dram a of reproduc tion is hum anl y enac t ed, as it were, in aid of produc tion in external nat ure. The “blood of the martyrs” was not only the “seed of the Chur ch” in later ages; the flesh and blood of the victim offered in sacrifice were also bur ied in the earth as seed for the future harvest. I n West Africa it was a custom for a man and wom an to be killed with spades and hoe s in the mont h of March, and for their bod ies to be buried in the middl e of a newly - tilled field to secure a better crop. The Marimos, a Bechua na tribe, offer up a hum an vict im for the welfare of their crops . The man chos en for a sacrifice is taken to the field and slain amongs t the wheat, according to their phrase, to serve as seed. The custom was not onl y African. The Pawnee Indians offered the flesh and blood of a sacrifici al victim at the time of seed - sow ing. As late as the year 1837 a captive Sioux girl was sacrificed by them at the time of planting the maize. The flesh was torn in morsels to be bur ied in the earth, and the corn was sprinkl ed with drops of her propi tiating blood. The appe al for food and drink was natural and uni versal. According to the ancient wisdom , this appe al was made to the Mother - earth as the sour ce of life, who was imaged as the giver of sustenance in various forms, but first and foremost as the supe rhum an suckler, the Sow , the Water - Cow , or Milch - 103 Cow . Egypt has registered the permanent proof that a supe rhum an pow er was first besought for food and drink in the person of the Great Mother. The hum an mother who was eaten sacramentally had suppl ied the type for the Great Mother in mythol ogy . The sacrifice was offered to the godde ss on the hill - top, on the altar - stone , in the field or granary, or unde r the green tree, as these were different type s of the Earth - Mother. The palm - tree that is being fecu nda ted on the Mesopot amian monum ents represents the Mother - earth as sour ce of food, one form of which is the produc e of the tree. The tree is female. The cone held in the hand of the Geni is an emblem of the male, or solar pow er by which the earth is ferti lized. Earth is the mother of food, the uni versal matrix; the tree"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"is but a type , like other representatives of the bringer - forth. The sacrifice portrayed beneath the tree upon the Hindu monum ents is frankl y pha llic (Moor ’s Hindu Pant heon ). Unde r whatsoev er type or name, the so - called “tree - worship” or “pha llic worship” is a festival of fertilization, celebrated in propi tiation of the earth - godde ss, who is the genetrix besought for food and sustenance, and blood was the primitive obl ation made to the Mothe r - earth. This, how ever, was not the onl y one , as is show n by the invoc atory rites. The ancient Mother still survives amongs t the Western Inoi ts in the same primeval character of Mother - earth; she who is the bringe r of food, and who when in a merry mood wi ll play at raining dow n melted fat in her capacity of the Great Mother who is pregna nt with plenty, and who is designa ted Mother Plenty. We are not likely to get much nearer to primitive nature than amongs t these Esqui maux, who still perform the mystery of generation and celebrate their Arctic Agapæ at the annua l festival of fecundi ty. In one of the scenes the Shamans enact the resurrection of life as the reproduc tion of food. The prey is hunt ed to death with savage cries. Whilst fleeing from the pur suers t he man in a mask, who acts the part of the animal seizes hol d of a brand from the fire and hurls it aloft to the roof , so that when it falls back to the ground it throw s out a show er of live sparks. What doe s this por tend? asks Réclus. The answer is that, “surrounde d as it is by its persecutors, the qua rry forgets its dange r to reproduc e its species, an expl oit which all the spectators greet with acclamation. ” It is not enough to kill the prey; it must also reproduc e itself, so that its race may not die out or food becom e scarce. This festival was uni versal onc e. It was celebrated all ove r the world as a drama of reproduc tion — first and foremost for the reproduction of food. The resurrection of food by reproduc tion in animal life is thus enacted at the Inoi t festival, as it has been acted in a hundr ed other mysteries, Intichium a, Eucharists, Corrobor ees, and religious revels. By the dim glimmer of this distant light we see the victim’s death was follow ed with the act of a begettal to new life. It was a drama o f reprodu ction in which the sacrificial victim from the first had represented food — the new food of anot her year, or of anot her life in the religious mysteries. It was, we repeat, a drama of reproduc tion, in which the victim that died and was eaten as the E ucharist was sym bolically reproduc ed in the Corrobor ee that follow ed. From very early times the sacrifice of a victim was solem - 104 nized, and follow ed by the pha llic feast, whether in the Corrobo ree of the Arunt a or the Christian Agapæ . First the sacri ficial victim is slain and eaten, ant e lucem, at the evening meal or Last Suppe r, and next the festival of reproduc tion was celebrated in the Agapæ . This reproduc tion was performed by uni versal promiscuity from a time when paternity was impersona l and the relations hip of the sexes was that of all for all, when boundl ess licence was the onl y law befitting the Great Mother. This prom iscuity is also recogni zable when Tertullian repeats the charges that were brought against the conduc t of the Christians at thei r festivals: “Dicimur scleratissimi de sacram ento infant icidii et pabul o inde , et pos t, incesto conv ivium quod eversores lum inum ” (Tertullian, Apol oge ticum , ch. vii.). We now com e to the seconda ry cause of what has been called “pha llic worship.” The first we found in Earth herself being imaged and propi tiated as the Great"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Mother in the pre - anthropom orphi c moul d when she was represented by the Water - Cow , the Sow , the Goos e, or other figure of food . Long before the god Seb was divinized as “the Father of Foo d,” the Earth was Mother of Food and gave drink as the wet - nurse, with the Sow as suckler of her children, and the cave in the rock as her wom b. The godde ss Hathor , the Egypt ian Venus , was the fairest representative of Mother - earth. She was propi tiated as the Mother of Plenty, like the Inoit Sidné , and was imaged in the likeness of the cow or sow , as the figur e of food and fecundi ty. She was also the godde ss of generation, maternity, and child - birth, as well as of music and the dance, of love liness and lov e. Lengt h of time and the cour se of developm ent have to be allow ed for. The Greek Venus in her nudi ty is immeasurably distant from the godde ss Hathor offering her milk to the glorified. Nevertheless, the Mother of Food was primary as Mother - earth, and the Godde ss of Love expl ains the pha llic nature of the later cult of fertilization. The most exact and com prehensive title for the religion designa ted pha llic worship woul d be the Cult of the Great Mother, taking Hathor for the type , who was the wom b of life as Mother - earth, the suckler as the cow, the giver of food , shelter, and water as the tree, and who in the cour se of time became the Godde ss of Love , of fecundi ty and child - birth. Moreove r, in the later phal lic cult the type had been change d from the cow t o the hum an female. The primitive simplicity of “Hathor worship” was just that of the infant pul ling and mum bling at the mother’s nippl es, when the sour ce of milky plenty was por trayed as supe rhum an in the likeness of the cow or sow ; and when the represent ation became anthropom orphi c this simplicity was lost. The Cow or Sow was supe rseded by the Wom an in the temples as the more alluring type of the great godde ss. It is most naïvely - pitiful to see how the sex became the hum an organ of the supe rhum an pow er o ffering itself as Hathor in the Asherah - tree or as the hous e of God; acting the godde ss as the great harlot of the cult in its debasement and deterioration. This, we repeat, was mainly a result of the representation becom ing anthropom orphic. The Great Moth er was the ideal in the minds of the devot ees, she whos e size had been imaged by the hippopot amus, whos e sexua l force had been repre - 105 sented by Sekhe t as the lione ss in heat. Thus , when the type was hum anized the female of the greatest capacity woul d present the nearest likeness to the divinity, and be held most worthy of her at the festival of fertilization. The Great Mother, when represented in the hum an form, becom es the harlot of prom iscuous intercour se performing the rite on behalf of the Great M other in her tree - tent or rock - cave, or later sanctuary. Carver in his Travels relates that when amongs t the Naudow essies he saw they paid unc om mon respect to one of their wom en, who was looke d up to, if not worshippe d, as a person of high distinction, bec ause on one occasion she invi ted forty of the principal warriors to her tent, provi ded them with a feast, and treated them all as her hus bands . This, the Indians said, was an ancient custom by which a wom an might win a husband of the first rank. (Lubboc k, Origin of Civilization, p. 101 .) She, like the Water - Cow , woul d be a type of the Great Mother, or Godde ss of Fecundi ty, represented by the wom an capable of entertaining all the males of the Totem at one time as the Great Mother inde ed. It was as representa tives"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"of the Great Mother that the temple prostitutes attained pre - eminence in various lands , and afterwards were highl y honour ed as the servants of the godde ss. The Great Mother in the Mount was represented by such godde sses as Astarte, whos e Ephe bæ and Cour tesans received her devot ees in grottoes and caves that were hol low ed out for the pur pos e in the Syrian hillsides. The temple of Hathor at Serabit - el - Khadem, discove red by Professor Petrie in the Peninsula of Sinai, was based originally on a cave in th e rock, which was the Great Earth - Mother’s earliest shrine. In Engl and there is or used to be a mild return to sexual prom iscuity onc e a year. The conf usion or “mingl ing on the Mound” was practised on the hill, though not in a very Belialistic way. In the present writer’s yout h it was an Easter pastime for the lads and lasses to meet upon the “Beacon, ” the “Steps,” or som e other sacred hill — equi valent to the Mound, and kiss and rom p and roll each other dow n the hill - side in a scene of fine conf usion, and wi th much soiling and tearing at times of pretty frocks that had to be put on qui te new for the saturnalia. All young folk were sweethearts in a kind of sexua l prom iscuity on Easter Day. In its way this was celebrated at the time of year when a reproduc tion of the fruits of the earth was dramatized and all the inimical influences that made for sterility, drought , and famine were figur atively driven away. As Herodot us relates, som e 700, 000 peopl e used to assemble at Buba stis to celebrate the annua l festival of the Great Mother Bast, who was know n as the godde ss of strong drink and sexua l passion. The wom en who expos ed their persons on the boa ts to the watchers on the shor e were exhi biting the natural lure to signi fy that they were free to all com ers, for this o ccasion onl y, in the service of the godde ss, who was a lione ss in heat. They were goi ng to celebrate the great festival of reproduc tion. He says that when the barges passed the river - side tow ns som e of the wom en danced on board, others stood up and expos ed their persons to thos e who were watching them from the banks of the Nile. (B. II, 60.) 106 The pha llic festival was periodi cally celebrated in honour of the Great Mother, the first supr eme pow er in nature persona lized as the godde ss of fertility, the g iver of food and drink, the celebration being in accordance with primitive usage and the prom iscuous sexua l intercour se of pre - Totemic times. The pha llic festivals were chiefly repeated at the equi noxe s — that is, at seed - time and harvest. The equi nox was a figur e of equa lity of all things being on a level. This fact is expr essed in the names of our Fairs and Evens. Prom iscuity was a mode of making things fair and even in the sexua l saturnalia. High and low , rich and poor , young and old, “com mingl ed on the mo und, ” the hill, the high places. It was a world in which old maids and bachelors were not allow ed, and there was at most a six mont hs’ lease for private ow nership in wom anki nd (from one equi nox to the other). Hence we learn from the witches’ confessions th at wom en were the stronge st suppor ters of the “Sabba th.” Laws of Tabu were violated with impuni ty for this occasion onl y. At this time, and no other, men and wom en of the same Totem coha bited prom iscuous ly. The Asherah is a sacred simulacrum of the godde ss whos e desire was to be for ever fecunda ted. And when the wom en of Israel set up the Asherah and wore the hangi ngs for curtains of conc ealment (II Kings XXIII. 7) they became the representatives of the Great Mother who is denounc ed by the biblical writers as the Great Harlot, but who was a most popul ar Mother in Israel, and Sekhet her ow n second self in Egypt ."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" There is every reason for conc ludi ng that the unl imited excess indul ged in prom iscuity at the pha llic festival was designe d to represent the desire for an illimitable suppl y of food , the boundl essness of the one being dramatically rende red by the latitude and licence of the other. It was a magical mode of the mysteries in which the meaning was expr essed in act as a primitive form of Sign - langua ge addr essed to the supe rhum an Pow er as the Great Mother. The custom s of the savage, or, as we prefer to say, the abor igines, are mode s of memorizing. For ages on ages their onl y means of keeping an historic record of the past, the sole mode of memorial, have bee n the custom s; and with what faithful persistence these have been fulfilled. Prom iscuous connubi um is recogni zed by the Arunt a as the condi tion that obt ained in the remotest times. They conne ct it with the custom of exchangi ng wives at the Corrobor ee, sayi ng this was the practice of the Alcheringa (N.T., pp. 96, 99). That was in the time beyond which not hing is or can be know n, because not hing was formulated in the lawless state of utter promiscuity. How itt relates that on one occasion, when the Aurora Aust ralis was more alarming and por tentous in appe arance than usual, the Kurnai tribe beheld it with great terror, and betook themselves to intersexua l com muni sm by the exchange of wives as a mode of warding off the calamity suppos ed to be impendi ng. (How itt o n som e Australian beliefs.) The root origin, then, of what has been called the phallic religion is also to be traced in a periodi c celebration of the festival of reproduc tion, which was first appl ied to the renewal of food in the flesh of animals and the fruits of the earth, this reproduc tion being rende red in the grossest hum an gui se on the huge st scale, and in the most prodi gious manne r befitting the Great Mother in com muna l connubi um 107 with all her sons toge ther. The festival of fertilization is a s urvival from the far - off past when the Mother - earth was the All and the Only One, to be propi tiated as the giver of food. Being the Mother, she was represented by the female, who was at first pre - hum an, and finally hum an. Thenceforth wom an was the living t ype of the mythical Great Mother, instead of the Cow or Sow , the Goat or the She - Bear; and at this festival all wom anki nd were one in imaging the Mother who from the beginni ng had been the All - One. Nothing was recogni zed but the female, the typi cal organ o f motherhood, which imaged the earth as mother of sustenance; the mother, who was propitiated and solicited in various ways, by obl ations of blood and other offerings , was also invoke d in the likeness of the hum an female to be fertilized in hum an fashion. She was the Great Mother, the All - One, and not hing less than the cont ribut ions of all coul d dul y, huge ly, adequa tely represent the obl ation. In Drum mond’ s Œdipus Judai cus, pl. 13, there is a drawing from the Mithraic monum ents according to Hyde , which show s that the seed - sow ing at the festival of fertilization was illustrated in the hum an fashion by the male, and that the Earth - Godde ss was fecunda ted as the female, who was represented by the wom en in the orgie of prom iscuity. The mystery of reproduc tion was acted in the festival, as the vicarious mode of fecunda ting the Great Mother and Good Lady, by the bount iful sow ing of hum an seed. It was a primitive mode of representing her, on behalf of whom all wom enki nd cont ribut ed vicarious ly. Call it “worship,” “ph allic worship,” or any other “worship,” the supr eme obj ect of devot ion at first was food and drink, which were represented by the earth in crop, the tree in fruit, the animal pregna nt with young; by the Mammalia, the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Water - Cow , the Sow , the Milch - Cow , the Goos e, the Emu, the Kanga roo; and lastly by the godde sses and the wom en who represented Mother - Earth as Apt or Isis, Nin - Ki - Gal or Demeter, when the latter had been obj ectified in Hathor , the godde ss of love , or Sekhe t, the godde ss of sexua l com muni on, as divinity in female form. As it is said of Pepi in the Texts, “Thy sister Isis hath com e to thee rejoicing in thy love . Thou hast had intercour se with her, and hast made her to conc eive.” (Budge , Book of the Dead, Introduc tion, p. 134. ) In these celebration s the woman took the place of the godde ss. At the time when the begetters were not yet indi vidua lized a singl e pair of actors would have conve yed but little meaning. The soul of procreation was tribal, general, prom iscuous , and the mode of reproduc tion in the most primitive mysteries was in keeping therewith. Reproduc tion by the soul of the tribe was rende red by all the members cont ribut ing to fecunda te the Great Mother. Hence the pha llic saturnalia, in which the reproduc tion of food, especially in the futu re life of the animals, and the cont inua tion of the species were dramatized in a primitive pha llic festival which survived eventually as the “love - feast” of the Christian cult. Many examples coul d be cited of this custom , which was uni versal as it was pri mitive, and which may be looke d upon as the festival of reproduc tion that represented the begettal of future food in hum an fashion and in connubi um as it were with the Great Mother, the Mother - Nature, or the Mother - earth, like Pepi with his 108 divine si ster Isis. In Indi a to - day young girls are married to the Gods . The doc trine is the same in the Rom an Cult when the Virgins are the dedicated Brides of Christ. In the earlier rite it was the Males who, like the Pharaoh Pepi, were married to the divine Moth er who was persona ted by the wom en in the mysteries of the primitive religion. At such a time, whatsoever their status attained in civilization, the peopl e lapsed pro tem. into a state of general prom iscuity. The wom en lost all feeling of mode sty and becam e raging Bacchantes. Men and wom en were more furious than animals in the indul gence of their passion at this wild debauch. As described by M. Réclus, divinized Mother - earth had to be stirred from her winter sleep by naïvely - lascivious spectacles for the pu rpos e of exciting the spirit of fecundi ty. She was represented by young wantons of wom en, who danced and frolicked inde scribably or lay dow n and scraped the ground with their heels, caressed it with their hands , and offered their embraces like so many nake d Danæ as wooi ng the fertilizing sun. In this saturnalia there was a general reversion to the practice of an earlier time som ewhat analogous to the throw back of atavism in race, with this difference: the intentiona l lapse in moral status was but tempor ary, although periodi cally recurrent. It was a strippi ng off, or rather bur sting out , of all the gui ses and disgui ses, trappi ngs , ties, and stays of civilization, and runni ng am ok in all the nudi ty of nature. There is a pathos of primitive simplicity in som e of the appe als thus made in the low er range s of the cult that is unpa ralleled in literature. The Thot igars of Sout hern Indi a, at the festival of sow ing seed, will insist that their wives shall make themselves com mon to all com ers as an incitement for the M other - earth to follow their example. The hus bands improvi ze shelters by the road - side and stock them with provi sions for their wives, and call upon the passers - by to “procure the publ ic good and ensure an abunda nce of bread” (Réclus, P. F. P., p. 283 ). A p ropos of this same festival, Israel is charged by"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Hosea with having becom e a prostitute by letting herself out for hire upon the corn - floor ! “Thou hast gone a - whor ing from thy God; thou hast love d hire upon every corn - floor” (ch. IX, 1). In this case the h arlot was a representative of the Mother - earth as godde ss of corn who was being fertilized by proxy on the grand scale in the pha llic festivities, which include d connubi um upon the corn - floor , as well as on the hill, unde r the green tree, or in the embrace of the earth itself. Phallic religion, then, as here maintained, did not originate in a worship of the hum ans sex. The Great Mother, pregna nt with plenty, was the obj ect of propi tiation and appe al, as the bringe r to birth and the giver of food. This was the supe rhum an mother in mythol ogy, and not the hum an parent, as in Totemism. “Phallic worship” originated in the cult of the motherhood. It was the Mother who was honour ed; her body and blood were sacredly eaten in the primitive Eucharist, if not as an ac t of ador ation, it was an act of primitive hom age and affection. The type was then appl ied to Mother - earth as the giver of life, of food and drink, the Great Mother in mythol ogy who was thus fertilized and fecunda ted as it were dramatically in the hum an fa shion for increase of food. The drama of reproduc tion also invol ved the mystery of resur - 109 rection and rebirth appl ied to the periodi c renewal of food which was represented in character by the victim. Reproduc tion was represented in various modes of resurrection, includi ng the dance. It was a com mon custom for the skin of the animal, bird, or reptile to be preserved entire and suspende d on a pol e as the sign of reproduc tion for anot her life. This might be the skin of the Ainu bear, who is invoke d to “ com e back soon into an Ainu” whilst being offered up as a sacrifice. They then rejoice and sing, and bot h sexes dance in ranks as bears. Judgi ng from other forms of the primitive Agapæ , we surmise that what is meant by the sexes dancing in ranks as bears i s that the performers at this festival coupl ed toge ther in the skins of the bear for the reproduc tion of their future food, which in this case was the bear, but elsewhere might be the buffalo, the bul l, the boa r, or other Totemic animal that was slain and eaten sacramentally. The resurrection acted in the mysteries of Amenta still cont inue s the Totemic type when the reproduc er is Osiris, the Bull of Eternity. It was the same festival of reproduc tion when the goa t was the sacrificial type as when it was the bear, or calf, or lamb, or other zoot ype that was eaten, food being the primitive obj ect in propi tiating the supe rhum an Pow er. It was the mystery of reproduc tion when the goa t was the sacrificial type as when it was the bear, the bul l, the goa t, the turtle , or any other Totemic type . The secret of the mystery is that food was the obj ect of the festival of reproduc tion, and the Great Mother was propi tiated for abunda nce of food. Sexua l intercour se was know n to be a mode of reproduc tion, and the performers no t onl y danced in Totemic gui se as animals, they acted the characters. In this mad festival of fertilization for the produc tion of food men also dressed and acted as wom en; wom en dressed and acted as men, the function of each being thus appa rently doubl ed. We know that in the Totemic mysteries the performers wore the skins of animals as a mode of acting in character, and when they acted thus in pairs it woul d inevitably give rise to statements that men and animals com mingl ed in dark rites without distinction of nature. Now , the goa t was a Jewish type , Totemic or religious , and the Jews were reput ed to be goa t - worshippe rs after the animal had been made a sym bol of the evil"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Sut in Egypt . But the goa t was at one time good , as a giver of food in flesh and milk, w hen thos e of the Totem woul d dance in the skin of the goa t and be denounc ed by later ignor ance as “worshippe rs” of the Shedim or of Satan. Thus amongs t the mysteries that were cont inue d by the primitive Christians is this of reproduc tion, which was first a ppl ied to food and finally to the hum an soul . Hence they were charged with “runn ing after heifers,” just as the Jews were denounc ed for runn ing after she - goa ts. The root of the whol e matter is that in this festival of fructification the animals which are e aten for food are represented by the Totemic actors in the skins as reproduc ing themselves for food hereafter. The fact is disclosed by the Inoi t ceremony in which the prey must reproduc e itself before the sacrificial victim dies, so that the species shall live on and future food may be secured. The mystery was the same the wide world round. The early Christians had to be adm oni shed against “runni ng after heifers” in their mysteries performed at “Christmas and on other days.” This was the survival 110 of a primitive custom that, like all others, had its genesis in the nature that was blindl y gropi ng in the gloom with dark religious rites. The fact was patent in all the mysteries that prom iscuous sexua l intercour se was an act which came to be called religio us. The Agapæ did not originate with what is termed Christianity, but was one of the most primitive institutions of the hum an race, which began as the festival of fertility when the invoc ation of the supe rhum an Pow er was for food and sustenance addr essed t o the Good Lady, the Earth - Godde ss, the Great Mother, in her several elemental characters. It was a festival of fructification at which she was represented by the hum an female, the more the merrier, the primary obj ect being future food far more than hum an offspring, and it was this desire that gave the touc h of religious feeling to the orgy of the sexes in which the seed was sow n broadcast, so to say, for future harvest. Follow ing Totemism, we find that Fetishism takes up the tale of developm ent in Sign - la ngua ge. By Fetishism the present writer means the reverent regard for amulets, talismans, mascots, charms, and luck - toke ns that were worn or otherwise employe d as magical signs of protecting pow er. Fetishism has been classified as the primal, uni versal rel igion of manki nd. It has also been called “the very last corrupt ion of religion. ” (Max Müller, Nat. Rel., p. 196 .) But it will not help us to com prehend the pos ition of the primitive races by simply suppos ing them to have been in an attitude of worship whe n they were only groping mentally on all four s. On the cont rary, we cons ider the so - called “fetishes” to be a residua l result of Sign - langua ge and Totemism, and do not look on Fetishism as an organized religious cult. The name of Fetishism was given by de Brosses, in his work on the cult of the fetish gods , publ ished in 1760. The word fetish is said to be derived from a root which yields our word faith. Feitico, in Portugue se, is the name for an amulet, a talisman, or magical charm. The word woul d seem to h ave been adopt ed by the West Coast natives and appl ied to their gru - grus, ju - jus, enqui zi, or moki sso, which are worn for mental medicine as the representative type of som e protecting supe rhum an pow er. But Fetishism did not originate with the Portugue se. A lso the same root - word is found in the Irish as fede. An ancient Irish weddi ng - ring in the shape of two hands clasped toge ther was called a fede. This too was a fetish, as a sign of fidelity or faith. The same thing was signi fied by the Egypt ian “Sa” for t he amulet or"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"magical charm. The word “Sa,” various ly illustrated, denot es protection, aid, backing, defence, virtue, soul , efficacy. An earlier form of the word is Ka: there was a divinity named Sau, or Ka, who was the god of fetish - figures which are ident ifiable as amulets, charms, knot s, skins, and other things that were worn as type s of protective pow er. In Egypt , Sa or Ka was the author or creator of the types which became fetishtic. (Rit., ch. XVII.) Nothing can be more pathetic than the appe al that wa s made to Sa, the god of amulets. The word Sa also signi fies touc h. Thus the protecting pow er appe aled to as the god of the fetish was the god of touc h. The amulet brought the pow er nearer to be laid hol d of, and made its presence veritable to this sense. Thus , Fetishism was a mode of Sign - langua ge which suppl ied a tangi ble means of laying 111 hol d of the nature pow ers that were to som e extent appr ehende d as supe rhum an without being com prehende d. Hence the talisman, the amulet, or magical charm is worn as som ething tangi ble, a thing to touc h or clutch hold of, on pur pos e to keep in touc h with the pow er represented by the fetish. This god of touch is still extant in the Chur ch of Rom e, as well as his amulets and charms, the cross, the rosary, and other feti sh figures that are yet worn for protection, and are touc hed in time of need, to establish the phys ical link with the invi sible Pow er with which it may be thought desirable to keep in touc h. But, it was not , as de Brosses said in his early generalization, that any thing woul d serve prom iscuous ly for a fetish. On the contrary, there was no fetish without som e special sym bol ic value know n to thos e who read these natural hierogl yphi cs. We see by the Zuni s that one great reason for making fetish images and hono uring them was that the so - called worship was a mode of laying hold upon the pow ers which they represented. This is com mon. The images are a means of taking tangi ble pos session of the pow ers themselves through their hos tages. The devot ees thus have them in their pow er, and hold them as it were in captivity, to control, com mand, and even coerce or puni sh them. Hence the gods were som etimes beaten in the shape of their fetish images. The appe al was not always prayerful. Certain magical formulæ in the Egypt ian Ritual were repeated as words of com mand. In saluting the two lions , the doubl e - uræi and the two divine sisters, the deceased claims to com mand and com pel them by his magical art (XXXVII, 1). Magic is the pow er of influencing the elemental or ancestral s pirits. Magical words are words with which to conj ure and com pel; magical processes were acted with the same intent. If the process cons isted in simply tying a knot , it was a mode of cove nanting and establishing a bond with the object of com pelling fulfilm ent. The Fetishism of Inne r Africa, with its elemental pow ers, its zoot ypol ogy , its science of magic and mental medicine, its doc trine of transformation, its amulets and charms, came to its culmination in the typol ogy, the mythol ogy, the magic, the religio us rites and custom s of Egypt . Egypt will show us the final pha se and perfect flow er of that which had its root age in the remotest past of hum anity in the Dark Cont inent. Wearing the fetish as a charm, a medicine, a visible sym bol of pow er, is com mon with the Negro races. Many of them delight in wearing a beltful of these around the bod y. If the Negro has to bear a heavier load than usual, he will clap on a fresh fetish for every pound of extra weight , because the fetishes represent a helpful pow er. If he h as to carry 100 pounds weight he will want, say,"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"half - a - doz en fetish images in his girdle. But if the weight be doubl ed he will requi re a doz en fetishes to enable him to sustain it. His fetishes represent pow er in various forms, whether drawn from the anim al world or hum an, whether the toke ns be a toot h, a claw, a skin, a hor n, hair, a root , a bone , or only a stone . They represent a stored up pow er, for the Negro has faith in his fetishes, and that acts as a pot ent mental influence. If he has onl y a gree - gr ee of cord, he will tie it into knot s, and every knot is the sign of increase in pow er 112 according to his reckoni ng. When it was know n what the type or fetish signi fied as a representative figur e, it coul d make no direct appe al to religious cons cious ne ss, nor evoke a feeling of reverence for itself, any more than the letters of the alpha bet. Mere fetishism in the mode rn sense onl y com es in with ignor ance of Sign - langua ge. The Arunt a have an emblem in their Chur inga which is a very sacred fetish. This is associated with the Alcheringa spirits. When there is a battle the Chur inga is suppos ed to endow its ow ner with cour age. “So firm is their belief in this, that if two men were fight ing, and one of them kne w that the other carried a Chur inga whilst he did not, he woul d certainly lose heart and without doubt be beaten” (Spencer and Gillen). We know that the Inne r African custom of carrying a num ber of amulets and charms strung upon the body for protection was cont inue d in ancient Egypt , because we see it emp loye d in the equi pm ent of the dead for their journey through the nether world. When the deceased enters the presence of the Typhoni an pow ers in Amenta he exul ts in being prepared with “millions of charms,” or fetish images, which friendl y hands have buried with his body, such as the terrible Eye of Horus, the Beetle of Transformation, the Tablet of Tahn, the Sceptre of Felspar, the Buckle of Stability, the Ankh - cross of Life, and other type s of protecting pow er. With his fetishes out side and inside of his m um my, he exclaims, “I clothe and equi p myself with thy spells, O Ra!” and so he faces the darkne ss of death in defiance of all the evil pow ers. Each amulet or fetish signi fies som e particular way of protecting, of preserving, transforming, reproduc ing, or renewing life, and reestablishing him for ever, the sun being representative of the pow er that revivifies for life eternal. We learn from the chapter on bringing the charms of a person in Hades that the amulets, spells, and talismans are equi valent to the pow ers of the mind, heart, and tongue of the deceased. He says, “I have made the gods strong , bringi ng all my charms to them” (ch. 23) . In the chapter on stoppi ng the crocodi les that com e to make the deceased “lose his mind” in Amenta, we see how the earli er zoot ype s that onc e represented the pow ers of destruction have still kept their place, and can be turned to goo d account by him, as when the deceased cries, “Back, Crocodi le of the West! There is an asp in my belly! There is a snake in my belly!” — the one being the sym bol of roya l supr emacy, the other of transformation into new life. The primitive mode of por traying the pow ers in nature that were supe rior to the hum an was cont inue d in this typol ogy of the tom b. Thus the Manes cling to pow ers beyond the hum an, which were first represented by the natural type s that have now becom e fetishtic; a means of claiming alliance with them and of clothing themselves in death with their shield of protection and panopl y of pow er. In spirit - life the deceased clutches at t he same type s that were fetishes in this life, and holds on by the same assistance. He not onl y clothes himself with their images as talismans and spells, he"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"transforms into their likeness to persona te their superhum an forces. Thus he can pass unde rground as a tortoise, a beetle, or a shrewmouse; make way through the mud or the nets as an eel, through the water as a crocodi le, through the dark as a jackal, or see in it as a cat; fly swiftly as a swallow , and soar through 113 the air or solar fire as the g olden hawk; shed his past life like the tail of the tadpol e that turns frog, or slough it like the skin of the serpent. In making his passage by means of manifold manifestations he exclaims, “I have flow n as a hawk,” “I have cackled as a goos e,” “I am the swallow ” (as the soul of swiftness). He runs through the zoot ype s which represented the pow ers of the soul in various stages of developm ent, and says: 1. I am the jackal. 2. I am the hawk. 3. I am the great fish. 4. I am the phœ nix. 5. I am the serpent. 6. I am the ram. 7. I am the sun. In this passage the deceased transforms into these zoot ype s of the nature pow ers in order that he may go where the merely hum an faculties woul d fail to carry him through . He assum es their pow er by wearing representative imag es or fetishes — by impersona tion of their parts and by incorpor ation of these pot encies which are beyond the hum an, and therefore supe rhum an. Hence the exclamation, “I have incorpor ated Horus” — i.e., the yout hful god who was for ever re - bor n in phe nom enal ma nifestation as representative of the eternal in time, in whos e likeness the mortal transformed into an immortal to realize the type . The Ritual cont ains many references to magic as a mode of transformation. The Osiris says: “My mout h makes the invoc ation o f magical charms. I pray in magical formulæ” (31, 2 - 3). That is the precise expl anation of the primitive mode s of invo cation and evoc ation, “I pray in magical formulæ.” And these magical formulæ were acted, performed, and signi fied by a thous and things tha t were done in place of being said: “My magical pow er gives vigour to my flesh” (64, 27) . “Masters of Truth, who are free from evil, living for ever, lend me your forms. Give me pos session of your magical charms,” “for I know your names” (72, 1, 2). Chapte r 64, is spoke n of as a hym n that caused the reader to go into a state of ecstasy. “He no longe r sees, no longe r hears, whilst reciting this pur e and hol y com pos ition” (50, 33) , which obvi ous ly points to the condi tion of trance that was attribut ed to the m agical pow er of the formulæ. Urt - Hekau, great in magical words of pow er, is a title of Isis, who was cons idered the very great mistress of spells and magical incantations . It is said of her: “The beneficent sister repeateth the formulæ and provi deth thy so ul with her conj urations . Thy person is strengthened by all her formulæ of incantation. ” It is the pow er beyond the type that goe s far to account for the origin and persistence of fetishism. The African know s well enough that the pow er is not necessarily resident in the fetish, which fails him cont inua lly and in the times of greatest need. But his trust is in the pow er that is represented by the fetish, the pow er that never dies, and therefore is eternal. The magical incantations which accom pany the gestu re signs also prove that the appe al, whether in dum b show or in words, was being made to som e supe rior supe rhum an force — that is, one of the elemental pow ers in mythol ogy which became the godde sses and gods in the later eschatology. The hawk will show us ho w a fetish image was educ ed from a type or sign of supe rhum an force. The bird in Egyp t was a sym bol of"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"the Horus sun on account of its swiftness and its soaring pow er. It was used to signi fy height , excellence, spirit, victory. And just as letters are redu ced ideogr aphs , so the hawk’s 114 foot and kite’s feather will denot e the pow er first represented by the bird itself, and as such they are worn upon the person. They are the visible signs of swiftness or upw ard flight , and therefore a true medicine or fe tish to speed one on. Also, when supe rhum an pow ers in nature were represented by the supe rhum an type s or zoot ype s, it was not that the deceased change d into an animal or bird or reptile, either in this life or the next, when he is self - assimilated to the t ype . When the deceased in the Ritual says, “I am the lion,” he is clothing himself in the strengt h of the great pow er that had been represented by the lion, which might be that of Shu or of Atum - Ra. The wearers of the fetish images, whether on earth or in Amenta, are affiliated or assimilated to the pow er beyond by means of the type , whether this is represented by wearing the whol e skin or a piece of it, the hor n, the hoo f, the toot h, or tail of the animal, the feathers of the bird or rattle of the snake. T hus , the hor n of the bul l, or a portion of it, might be worn to assimilate the wearer to Osiris, “the Bull of Eternity.” An old Fan hunt er gave Miss Kings ley a little ivor y half - moon which was specially intende d “to make man see bus h,” otherwise for her to see her way in the night of the forest ( Trav. p. 102) . So the eye of Horus which images the moon is given to the deceased for his night - light in the darkne ss of death. Horus presents the (solar) eye by day and Taht the luna r eye by night (Rit., ch. 144 , 8 ). The eye was an emblem of great magical and protecting power. With many of the West Coast Africans the eyeballs of the dead, more particularly of Europe ans, cons titute a great medicine, fetish, or charm. Dr. Nassau told Miss Kings ley that he had know n gr aves to have been rifled in search of them (Kings ley, M. H., Travels in West Africa, p. 449) . The amulets, charms, and toke ns of magical pow er that were buried with the Egypt ian dead became fetish on account of what they imaged sym bol ically, and fetishtic sym bol ism is Sign - langua ge in one of its ideogr aphi c pha ses. The Usekh - collar indi cated being set free from the banda ges and rising again from the dead in the glorified form of the Sahu - mum my. The Tam - sceptre signi fied uni on with the love d and lost. As Eg ypt ian, one of the fetish figur es buried with the dead is the sign of the corner or angl e, named Neka σ . It is the mystical corner - stone of the Masoni c bui lder, and a sign of bui lding on the squa re, for which the sym bol stands . Building on the squa re, or a four fold founda tion, is to bui ld for ever. Paul speaks as a Mason or a gnos tic when he makes the mystical Christ the “chief cornerstone ” in the temple that is bui lded “for an habitation of God in the spirit” ( Eph. II. 20 - 22) . The Ankh - cross signi fied the life to com e, that is, the life everlasting. The Shen - ring imaged cont inui ty for ever, in the circle of eternity. The heart of green basalt show ed that the deceased in this life was sound - hearted.

Now , in one of the num erous change s made by the Osiris in Amenta he transforms into a stone (Rit., ch. 161) , saying “I am the tabl et of felspar .” This was the Uat - amulet that was placed in the tom b as a type of that which was for ever green, fresh and flou rishing, equi valent to the green jade found in Neolithic graves. In this an evergreen was, so to say, made permanent in stone , and buried with the dead as a type of eternal you th. The deceased exclaims, “I am the colum n of green felspar” (Rit., ch. 160) , a nd he rejoices in the stone being so hard that it cannot be crushed or even receive a scratch, saying, “If it is safe, I am safe; if it is uni njured, I am uni njured.” The pow er of this amulet was in its impenetrable hardne ss, which represented eternal perm anence for the soul which it imaged. One of the most sacred fetishes in Egypt was an amulet of red stone , which represented the blood of Isis. That is the mother - blood in theology – the blood by which salvation came, to give eternal life – a subl imated form of the mother - blood in totemism, which came to give the hum an life. Isis, moreove r, is the virgin divinized. We speak of the blood tie between mother and child. This was first figur ed by means of the totem, and naturally the figur e became a fetish. The Egypt ians, being more adva nced, were able to manuf acture fetishtic type s like the Ankh - image of life, the Tat - emblem of stability, the Nefer - amulet of good luck, the Scarabæ us of transformation, the serpent of eternity. It must have been a work of proud accom p lishm ent for primitive man when first he made a string of hair or of any fibrous material, and coul d tie a knot in it. We might say primitive wom an, hers being the greater need. It is the godde ss Ankh who wears the hemp - stalks on her head, the godde ss Neit h who is the kni tter divinized. The knot ted tie is one of the most primitive and impor tant of all the African fetishes to be found in Egypt . It is the gree - gree of Inne r Africa. The Ankh - tie itself is originally merely a piece of string called a strap. It is the sign of dress, of und ress, to tie or fasten, and of linen hung up to dry. The tie in Egypt takes several forms in the Ankh , the Tet, the Sa. The Ankh denot es life. The Sa has ten loops or ties, which in the langua ge of signs might signi fy a period o f ten luna r mont hs. The Tet - tie, now a buc kle, represents the blood of Isis, the saving blood , the soul of blood derived from the virgin mother, which was imaged in the human Horus. The tie was the earliest form of the liku or loin - belt first worn by the f emale as the mother of life at the period that was indi cated by nature for propa gation and connubi um . Necklaces were worn by the Egypt ian wom en to which the tie - amulet of Isis formed a penda nt, and indi cated her protecting pow er. In others the amulet suspe nde d was the Ankh of life, or the heart (Ab); the Tat - sign of stability, or the Neferu - sym bol of good luck. These were all fetishes that were worn to establish the persona l rappor t and alliance with the respective pow ers, which are know n by name when divin ized. Fetishes generally are obj ects held in honour as the representatives of som e pow er that was worshippe d when the feeling had attained that status. Thus a stone may be the sacred sym bol of eternal dur ation; the frog a living sym bol of the pow er of tra nsformation; 116"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" the serpent a sym bol of the pow er of self - renewal; the crocodi le a zoot ype of the pow er that coul d see when itself was uns een. The sword - fish is sacred to the Negroes of Guinea. This they do not eat. But the sword when cut off and dried becom es a fetish. That is as a type of the supe rhum an pow er whos e sym bol is the sword. In the final pha se amulets, charms, talismans, mascots, and toke ns became fetishtic through being adopt ed and worn as visible or secret signs of som e protecting pow er. T hey are as much ideogr aphs as any others in the Egypt ian hierogl yphi cs and as a mode of representation they belong to the ancient langua ge of pre - verbal signs . In Egypt the great First Mother Apt was propi tiated as the “Mistress of Protection. ” And the “p rotection” was signi fied by type s of permanence and pow er that were natural at first, then artificial when the horn and toot h were succeeded by the ivor y that was carved into amulets and charms, which objectified the pow er of protection for the living or t he dead. The pow er of Apt was por trayed in nature by the hippopo tamus, and a toot h of the animal woul d sym bol ize its strength. Hence we find that figur es of the animal were shaped in ivory, or stone , to be worn as type s of the “Mistress of Protection. ” Fig ures of hippopot ami carved out of red stone have been discove red lately in the prehistoric sites of Egypt , which were obvi ously intende d to be worn as amulets. Thus the fetish was at first a figure of the entire animal that represented the protecting pow e r as the supe rhum an Mother Apt ( Proc. S. of B. A., XXII, parts 4 and 5, p. 460) . Afterwards the toot h, the hor n, the hoof woul d serve to image the pow er when worn upon the person of the living or bur ied with the mum my of the dead. A toot h is one of the mos t primitive type s of pow er. Lions ’ teeth are worn by the Congo blacks as talismans or amulets. Crocodi les’ teeth are worn by the Malagasy; dogs ’ teeth by the Sandw ich Islande rs; tiger - cats’ teeth by the Land Dyaks; boa rs’ teeth by the Kuki s; hogs ’ teeth by the natives of New Guinea; sharks’ teeth by the Maori. All these were fetish type s as images of supe rhum an strengt h. When the Esqui maux Ange kok goe s forth to battle with the evil spirits and influences inimical to man, he arms himself with the claws of be ars, the beaks of birds, the teeth of foxe s, and other type s of the nature pow ers which were primarily represented by the zoot ype s that beque athed these, their remains, to the repertory of fetishism. Thus the primitive Inne r African mode of representation was not onl y preserved in the wisdom of Egypt , it became eschatologi cal in one pha se just as it remained hierogl yphi cal in the other, and in bot h it was the out com e and cons um mation of African Sign - langua ge. That which has been designa ted telepathy and th e transference of thought by the Society for Psychical Research was well know n amongs t the abor iginal races, and that know ledge was utilized in their system of mental magic, or what the red men term their medicine. The earliest medicine was mental, not phy sical, not what we term phys ic. The effects that were sought for had to be educ ed by an influence exerted on the mind, rather than by chemical qua lities found in the phys ics. Hence the fetishes of the black or red abor igine are his medicine by name as well as by nature. These things served, like vaccination, traction - buc kles, or “tar - water and 117 "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"the Trinity,” as fetishes of belief so long as that belief might last. They cons tituted a mental medicine, and an access of strengt h or spiritual succour might be derived from the thought . Belief works wonde rs. Hence the image of pow er becom es protective and assisting; it suppl ies a medicine, as it is termed, a medicine to the mind; and the fetishes, therefore, are prope rly called a medicine. Thus the earliest he aling pow er was mental. It was the influence of mind on mind, that ope rated chiefly by sugge stion. This was extant before the time of drugs , when mental influence was cons idered magical, and the man whos e pow er was greatest was the mage or the magician. Wh en the fetish - monge r came to think that the healing or helping pow er resided in the fetish itself, one of two things had occurred. Either the devot ee had lost sight of the original representative value of the fetish, and in his ignor ance had gone blind wit h superstition, or it had been discove red that certain natural produc ts did cont ain stimulating prope rties and healing virtues in themselves, and thus the medicine of phys ics began to suppl ement the more primitive mental medicine of the earlier fetishism. But the mass of fetishes do not pos sess their pow er intrinsically or inhe rently; they have onl y a representative value, which cont inue s to make successful appe al to belief long after it has passed out of know ledge . Thus we have the fetishism of a primitive intelligence mixed up and conf used with the fetishism of later ignor ance. The first mental medicine was derived by laying hol d of the nature pow ers in som e typi cal or representative way. For example, the fire - stone from heaven was a sign of primary pow er. This was worn as a mental medicine at first, but it becom es phys ic at a later stage when, as with the Burmese, a cure for opht halmia is found in the scrapings of thunde rbol ts or meteoric stone s. A medicine of immense pow er for the muscles is still made by the Chinese from the bone s of a tiger which have been dug up after lying som e mont hs in the earth and ground into a most pot ent pow der, whilst the blood and liver of the same animal suppl ies a medicine of might y pow er — i.e., to the mind that can derive it by typi cal transference from the tiger. It is one of the most curious and instructive studi es to trace this transformation of the earliest mental medicine into actual phys ics. For example, the nos e - hor n of the rhinoc eros is an African fetish of the greates t pot ency. This represents the pow er of the animal, and when carried as a fetish, charm, or amulet it is a type of the pow er looke d upon as assisting and protecting no matter where this pow er may be localized mentally. The rhinoc eros being a persistent rep resentative of pow er in and ove r water, its horn woul d naturally typify protection against the drow ning element for boa tmen and sailors. In the next stage the medicine is turned into phys ic by the horn being ground dow n and swallow ed as a pow der. Our famil iar hartshor n derived its primal pot ency as a mental medicine from the horn of the deer, which was adopt ed as a type of renova tion on account of the animal’s having the pow er periodi cally to shed and renew its hor ns, and the hor n itself as an emblem of ren ova tion was a good mental medicine long before essences were extracted or drugs com pounde d from it in the chemistry of phys ics. One might poi nt to many things that suppl ied the mental medicines of fetishism before they were 118 ground dow n or calcined fo r the phys ic prescribed by our learned leeches of later times, who played the same ignor ant part in dealing with these leavings of the past in this department of phys ics that the priests have played with the sweepings of ancient"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"supe rstitions with which th ey have so long begui led and ignor antly doc tored us.

As we read in the Discovery of Witchcraft, the wi zard’s out fit include d a robe furred with foxs kin, a breastplate of virgin parchm ent, and a dry thong of lion’ s or hart’s skin for a girdle. The skin also survives as a part of the insigni a worn in our law cour ts, colleges, and pul pits, where it still serv es in Sign - langua ge to determine a particular status; it likewise survives as the cap and tails on the head of the clow n in a less serious kind of pantom ime. Som e years since the present writer was making an inqui ry at the Regent’s Park Zool ogi cal Gardens respecting the sloughi ng of the serpent, when the attenda nt thought it was the “slough” of the serpent that was wanted. The writer then learned that this cast - off skin of the reptile was still sold in London as a charm, or fetish, a medicine of great pot en cy, and that the sum of £5 was som etimes paid for one . The fetishes acqui red their sacred character, not as obj ects of worship, but from what they had represented in Sign - langua ge; and the meaning still cont inue d to be acted when the langua ge was no longe r read. The serpent was a sym bol of renewal and self - renova tion from the first, and thus the slough or skin remains a fetish to the end.

B OOK III. "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" T HE Fetishism and Mythol ogy of Inne r Africa, left dum b or uni ntelligible, first became articulate in the Valley of the Nile. Egypt alone preserved the primitive gnos is, and gave expr ession to it in the langua ge of signs and sym bol s as mout hpi ece of the old dark land. From her we learn that amulets, talismans, luck - toke ns, and charms became fetishtic, because they represented som e protecting pow er that was looke d to for supe rhum an aid, and that this pow er belonge d to one of two classes of spirits or supe rhum an beings which the Egypt ians of the Ritual called “the Gods and the Glorified.” The first were elemental pow ers divinized. The second are the spirits of hum an ancestors, com monl y called the a ncestral spirits. The present obj ect is to trace the origin of bot h, and to distingui sh betwixt the one and the other, so as to discriminate elsewhere betwixt the two kinds of spirits, with the Egypt ian wisdom for our gui de. According to the historian Man etho, who was a master of the secrets that were know n to the Hir - Seshta, the keepers of chronol ogy in Egypt had reckone d time and kept the register for a period of 24, 900 years. This period Manetho divides unde r three divine dyna sties with three classes of rulers, namely, the “Gods ,” the “Heroes,” and the “Manes.” The reign of the gods was subdi vided into seven sections with a deity at the head of each. Now , as will be show n, the “Gods ” of Egypt originated in the primordial pow ers that were derived at first from the Mother - earth and the elements in external nature, and these gods became astronom ical or astral, as the Khus or Glorious Ones in the celestial Heptanom is, or Heaven in seven divisions . In their stellar character they became the Seven Glorious One s whom we read of in the Ritual (ch. 17) , who were seven with Horus in Orion; seven with Anup at the pol e of heaven; seven with Taht, with Ptah, and finally with Ra and Osiris, as the Seven Lords of Eternity. These two divine dyna sties, elemental and Kroni an, were follow ed in the list of Manetho by the Manes or ancestral spirits. In his Hibbe rt Lectures, Renouf denied the existence of ancestor - worship in Egypt . Nevertheless, he was entirely wrong. The New Year’s Festival of the Ancestors determines that. Th is is referred to in the Calenda r of Esné. It was solemnized on the 9th of 120 Taht, the first mont h of the Egypt ian year, and was then of unknow n antiqui ty. The Egypt ians entertained no doubt about the existence, the persistence, or the persona lity of the hum an spirit or ghos t of man; and as we unde rstand Manetho’ s account of the Egypt ian religion in the times before Mena, the worship of the ghos ts or spirits of the dead was that which follow ed the two previous dyna sties of the elemental pow ers of earth and the Kroni dæ in the astronom ical mythol ogy. For the present pur pos e, how ever, the three classes mentione d fall into the two categor ies of beings which the Egypt ians designa ted “the Gods and the Glorified.” The gods are supe rhum an pow ers, whether elemen tal or astronom ical. The glorified are the soul s onc e mortal which were propi tiated as the spirit - ancestors, here called the Manes of the dead. Not that the Egypt ian deities were what Herbert Spencer thoug ht, “the expa nde d ghos ts of dead men.” We know them from their genesis in nature as elemental pow ers or animistic spirits, which were divinized because they were supe rhum an, and therefore not hum an. Sut, as the soul of darkne ss; Horus, as the soul of light; Shu, as the soul of air or breathing force; Seb, as soul of earth; Nnu (or Num ), as soul of water; Ra, as soul of the sun, were gods ,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"but these were not expa nde d from any dead men’s ghos ts. Most empha tically, man did not make his gods in his ow n image, for the hum an likeness is, we repeat, the latest tha t was appl ied to the gods or nature - pow ers. Egypt ian mythol ogy was founde d on facts which had been closely obs erved in the ever - recurring phe nom ena of external nature, and were then expr essed in the primitive langua ge of signs . In the beginni ng was the voi d, otherwise designa ted the abys s. Darkne ss being the primordial condi tion, it follow ed naturally that the earliest type in mythical representation shoul d be a figur e of darkne ss. This was the mythical dragon, or serpent Apap, the devour ing reptile, the mo nster all mout h, the prototype of evil in external nature, which rose up by night from the abys s and coiled about the Mount of Earth as the swallow er of the light; who in anot her pha se drank up all the water, as the fiery dragon of drought . The voi ce of th is huge , appa lling mons ter was the thunde r that shook the firmament (Rit., ch. 39) ; the drought was its blasting breath that dried up the waters and withered vegetation. As a mythical figur e of the natural fact, this was the original Ogre of the North, the giant who had no heart or soul in his body. Other pow ers bor n of the voi d were likewise elemental, with an aspect inimical to man. These were the spawn of darkne ss, drough t and disease. In the Ritual they are called the Sami, demons of darkne ss, or the wi cked Sebau, who for ever rose in impotent revol t against the pow ers that wrought for good. These Sami, or black spirits, and Sebau suppl ied fiends and spirits of darkne ss to later folklore and fairyol ogy; and, like the evil Apap, the offspring also are of neither sex. Sex was introduc ed with the Great Mother in her huge st, most ancient form of the water cow , as representative of the Mother - earth and bringe r forth of life amidst the waters of surroundi ng space. Her children were the elemental pow ers or force s, such as wind and water, earth and fire; but these are not to be conf used with the evil proge ny of Apap. Both are 121 elemental in their origin, but the first were baneful, whereas the latter are beneficent. When the terrors of the elements had som ewh at spent their force, and were found to be non - sentient and unintelligent, the chief obj ects of regard and propi tiation were recogni zed in the bringe rs of food and drink and the breath of air as the elements of life. Thos e were the beneficent pow ers, born of the Old Mother as elemental forces, that preceded the existence of the gods or pow ers divinized. The transformation of an elemental pow er into a god can be traced, for example, in the deity Shu. Shu as an elemental force was representative of wind, air, or breath, and more especially the breeze of dawn and eve, which was the very breath of life to Africa. Darkness was upl ifted or blow n away by the breeze of dawn. The elemental force of wind was imaged as a panting lion couc hed upon the hor izon or the mou ntain - top as lifter up of darkne ss or the sky of night . The pow er thus represented was animistic or elemental. Next, Shu was given his star, and he became the Red God, who attained the rank of stellar deity as one of the seven “Heroes” who obt ained their s oul s in the stars of heaven. The lion of Shu was cont inue d as the figur e of his force; and thus a god was bor n, the warrior - god , who was one of the Heroes, or one of the pow ers in an astronom ical character. Three of these beneficent pow ers were divinized a s male deities in the Kamite Pantheon, unde r the names of Nnu, Shu, and Seb. Nnu was the produc er of that water which in Africa was looke d upon as an ove rflow of very heaven. Shu was giver of the breath of life. Seb was"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"divinized, and therefore worshippe d as the god of earth and father of food . These three were pow ers that represented the elements of water, air, and earth. Water is denot ed by the name of Nnu. Shu carries the lion’ s hinde r part upon his head as the sign of force; the totem of Seb is the goos e that lays the egg, a primitively perfect figur e of food. These, as elemental pow ers or animistic soul s, were life - givers in the elements of food , water, and breath. Not as begetters or creators, but as transformers from one pha se of life to anot her, fina lly includi ng the transformation of the supe rhuman pow er into the hum an produc t. There are seven of these pow ers altoge ther, which we shall have to follow in various pha ses of natural phe nom ena and on divers radiating lines of descent. Tentatively we might parallel: — Darkne ss=Sut; light =Horus; breathing pow er=Shu; water=Nnu (or Hapi); earth= Tuamutef (or Seb); fire=Khabsenuf ; blood= Child - Horus. These were not derived from the ancestral spirits, onc e hum an, and no ancestral spirits ever were derived from them. Six of the seven were pre - hum an type s. The seventh was imaged in the likeness of Child - Horus, or of Atum , the man. Two lists of names for the seven are given in the Ritual (ch. 17, I, 99 - 107 ), which correspond to the two categor ies of the elemental pow ers and the Glorious Ones, or Heroes. Speaking of the seven, the initiate in the mysteries says, “I know the names of the seven Glorious Ones. The leader of that divine com pany is An - ar - ef the Great by name.” The title here identifies the hum an elemental as t he sight less mortal Horus — that is, Horus who was incarnated in the flesh at the head of the seven, to becom e the first in status, he who had been the latest in develop - 122 ment. In this chapter of the Ritual the seven have now becom e astronom ical, with their stations fixed in heaven by Anup, whom we shall identify as deity of the Pole. “They do better,” says Plutarch, “who believe that the legends told of Sut, Osiris, and Isis do not refer to either gods or men, but to certain great powers that were supe rhum an, but not as yet divine” ( Of Isis and Osiris, ch. 26) . The same writer remarks that “Osiris and Isis passed from the rank of good demons (elementals) to that of deities” (ch. 30). This was late in the Kamite mythos , but it truly follow s the earlier t rack of the great pow ers when these were Sut and Horus, Shu and Seb, and the other elemental forces that were divinized as gods . In the astronom ical mythol ogy the nature - pow ers were raised to the pos ition of rulers on high, and this is that beginni ng whic h was described by Manetho with “the gods ” as the primary class of rulers, whos e reign was divided into seven sections , or, as we read it, in a heaven of seven divisions — that is, the celestial Heptanom is. Certain of these can be distingui shed in the ancien t heavens yet as figures of the cons tellations which became their totems. Amongs t such were the hippopot amus - bul l of Sut, the crocodi le - dragon of Sebek - Horus, the lion of Shu, the goos e of Seb, the beetle of Kheper (Cancer), and other type s of the starry s oul s on high, now designa ted deities, or the Glorious Ones, as the Khut i. The ancient mother, who had been the cow of earth, was elevated to the sphe re as the cow of heaven. It was she who gave rebirth to the seven pow ers that obt ained their soul s in the s tars, and who were know n as “the Children of the Thigh” when that was her cons tellation. These formed the com pany of the seven Glorious Ones, who became the Ali or Elohi m, divine masters, time - keepers, makers and creators, which have to be follow ed in a va riety of pha ses and characters. The Egypt ian gods were"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"bor n, then, as elemental pow ers. They were bor n as such of the old first Great Mother, who in her character of Mother - earth was the wom b of life, and therefore mother of the elements, of which there ar e seven altoge ther, called her children. The seven elemental pow ers acqui red soul s as gods in the astronom ical mythol ogy. They are given rebirth in heaven as the seven children of the old Great Mother. In the stellar mythos they are also groupe d as the sev en Khus with Anup on the Mount . They are the seven Taasu with Taht in the luna r - mythos , the seven Knemmu with Ptah in the solar mythos . They then pass into the eschatology as the seven soul s of Ra, the Holy Spirit, and the seven great spirits glorified wit h Horus as the eight h in the resurrection from Amenta. The Egypt ians have preserved for us a portrait of Apt (Kheb, or Ta - Urt), the Great Mother, in a four fold figur e, as the bringer forth of the four funda mental elements of earth, water, air, and heat. A s representative of the earth she is a hippopot amus, as representative of water she is a crocodi le, and as the representative of breathing force she is a lione ss, the human mother being imaged by the pende nt breasts and procreant wom b. Thus the mother of l ife is depicted as bringe r forth of the elements of life, or at least four of these, as the elemental forces or “soul s” of earth, water, fire, and air, which four are imaged in her com pound corpul ent figur e, and were set forth as four of her seven children . Apt was also the mother of 123 sparks, or of soul s as sparks of starry fire. She was the kindl er of life from the spark that was represented by the star. This, we reckon, is the soul of Sut, her first - born, as the beneficent pow er of darkne ss. The pow e r of water was imaged by Sebek - Horus as the crocodi le. The pow er of wind or air, in one character, was that of the lion - god Shu; and the pow er of the wom b is the Child - Horus, as the fecunda tor of his mother. These, with som e slight variations , are four of the seven pow ers of the elements identified with the mother as the bringe r forth of gods and men, whom we now adays call Mother Nature."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" Apt, the First Great Mother Six of the total seven were represented by zoot ype s, and Horus was persona lized in the form of a child. Evidence for a soul of life in the dark was furnished by the star. Hence the Khabsu in Egypt ian. This was an elemental power of darkne ss divinized in Sut, the author of astronom y. Evidence for a soul of life in the water was furnished by the fish that was eaten for food. This elemental pow er was divinized in the fish - god Sebek and in Ichthus , the mystical fish. Evidence f or a soul of life in the earth was also furnished in food and in periodi c renewal. The elemental pow er was divinized in Seb, the father of food derived from the ground, the plants, and the goos e. Evidence for a soul of life in the sun, represented by the u ræus - serpent, was furnished by the vivifying solar heat, the elemental pow er of which was divinized in Ra. Evidence for a soul of life in blood was furnished by the incarnation, the elemental pow er of which was divinized in elder Horus, the eternal child. Six of these seven pow ers, we repeat, were represented by zoot ype s; the seventh was given the hum an image of the child, and later of Atum the man. Thus the earliest gods of Egypt were develope d from the elements, and were not derived from the expa nde d ghos ts of dead men. Otherwise stated, the ancestral spirits were not primary. Dr. Rink, writing of the Eskimo, has said that with them the whol e visible world is ruled by supe rnatural pow ers or “ow ners,” each of whom hol ds sway within certain limits, and is c alled his Inua (viz., its or his Inuk, which word signi fies “man” and also ow ner or inha bitant). This is cited by Herbert Spencer as most conc lusive evidence that the agent or pow er was original ly a hum an ghost, because the pow er may be expr essed as the In uk, or its man — “the man in it — that is, the man’s ghos t in it.” The writer did not think of the long way the race had to travel before “the pow er” coul d be"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"expr essed by “its man,” or how late was the anthropol ogi cal mode of representing the forces of extern al nature. “The man” as type of power belongs to a far later mode of expr ession. Neither man nor wom an nor child was among the earliest representatives of the elemental forces in external nature. By the bye , the Inuk is the pow er, and in Egypt ian the root Nukh denot es the pow er or force of a thing, the potency of the male, as the bul l; thence Nukht a is the strong man or giant. Sut was a Suten - Nakht . Horus was a 124 Suten - Nakht , but neither of them was derived from man. The elements themselves were the ear liest supe rhum an pow ers, and these were thought of and imaged by supe rhum an equi valents. The pow er of darkne ss was not represented by its man, or the ghos t of man. Its primal pow er, which was that of swallow ing all up, was imaged by the devour ing dragon. T he force of wind was not represented by its man, but by its roaring lion; the drow ning pow er of water by the wide - jawed crocodile, the pow er of light ning or of suns troke by its serpent - sting, the spirit of fire by the fiery - spirited ape. In this way all th e elemental forces were equa ted and obj ectified before the zoot ype of Sign - langua ge was change d for the hum an figure or any one of them attained its “man” as the representative of its pow er. The earliest type of the man, even as male pow er, was the bul l, t he bul l of his mother, who was a cow , or hippopot amus. Neither god nor godde ss ever had been man or wom an or the ghos t of either in the mythol ogy of Egypt , the oldest in the world. The Great Mother of all was imaged like the totemic mother, as a cow , a ser pent, a sow , a crocodi le, or other zoot ype , ages before she was represented as a wom an or the ghos t of one . It is the same with the pow ers that were born of her as male, six of which were por trayed by means of zoot ype s before there was any one in the liken ess of a man, wom an, or child. And these pow ers were divinized as the primordial gods . The Egypt ians had no god who was derived from a man. They told Herodot us that “in eleven thous and three hundr ed and forty years [as he reckons ] no god had ever actually becom e a man” (B. II, 142) . Therefore Osiris did not originate as a man. Atum , for one , was a god in the likeness of a man. But he was know n as a god who did not himself becom e a man. On the other hand, no hum an ancestor ever became a deity. It was the sam e in Egypt as in Inne r Africa; the spirits of the hum an ancestors always remained hum an, the glorified never became divinities. The nearest appr oach to a deity of hum an origin is the god in hum an likeness. The elder Horus is the divine child in a hum an sha pe. The god Atum in name and form is the perfect man. But bot h child and man are entirely impersona l — that is, neither originated in an indi vidual child or personal man. Neither was a hum an being divinized. It is onl y the type that was anthropom orphi c. The two categor ies of spirits are separately distinguished in the Hall of Right eous ness, when the Osiris pleads that he has made “obl ations to the gods and fune ral offerings to the depar ted” (Rit., ch. 125) . And again, in the chapter follow ing, the “obl ations are presented to the gods and the sacrificial meals to the glorified” (ch. 126) . A singl e citation from the chapter of the Ritual that is said on arriving at the Judgm ent Hall will furnish a brief epitom e of the Egypt ian religion as it culminated in the Osirian cult. “I have propi tiated the great god with that which he love th; I have given bread to the hungr y, water to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, a boa t to the shipw recked. I"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"hav e made obl ations to the gods and fune ral offerings to the depar ted,” or to the ancestral spirits (Rit., ch. 125) . The statement show s that the divine service cons isted 125 of good works, and primarily of charity. The gods and the glorified to whom worship was paid are: (1) The Great One God (Osiris); (2) the Nature - Pow ers, or Gods ; and (3) the Spirits of the Departed. But the order in developm ent was: (1) The Elemental Forces, or Animistic Nature - Pow ers; (2) the Ancestral Spirits; (3) the One Great God ove r all, who was imaged phe nom enally in the Kamite trinity of Asar - Isis in matter, Horus in soul , Ra in spirit, which three were blende d in the Great One God. In the Hym n to Osiris (line 6) the ancestral spirits are likewise discriminated from the divine pow ers or gods . When Osiris goe s forth in peace by com mand of Seb, the Go d of Earth, “the might y one s bow the head; the anc estors are in prayer.” These latter are the com mona lty of the dead, the hum an ancestors in general, distingui shed from the gods or pow ers of the elements that were divinized in the astronom ical mythology. I n one of the texts the “spirits of the king, ” the ever - living Mer - en - Ra, are set forth as an obj ect of religious regard supe rior in status to that of the gods , by which we unde rstand the ancestral spirits are here exalted above the elemental pow ers as the obj ects of propi tiation and invoc ation. The Egypt ian gods and the glorified were fed on the same diet in the fields of divine harvest, but are entirely distinct in their origin and character. The glorified are identifiable as spirits that onc e were hum an w ho have risen from the dead in a glorified body as Sahus . The gods are spirits or pow ers that never had been hum an. We know the great one s, female or male, from the beginni ng as elemental forces that were always extant in nature. These were first recogni ze d, represented, and divinized as supe rhum an. The ghos t, when recogni zed, was hum an still, how ever change d and glorified. But the Mother - earth had never been a hum an mother, nor had the serpent Rannut , nor Nut, the celestial wateress. The god of the Pole as Anup, the moon god Taht, the sun god Ra, had never been spirits in a hum an gui se. They were divinized, and therefore worshippe d or propi tiated as the supe rhum an pow ers in nature, chiefly as the givers of light , food , and drink, and as keepers of time and season. These, then, are the godde sses and gods that were created by the hum an mind as pow ers that were impersona l and non - hum an. Hence they had to be envi saged with the aid of living type s. Spirits onc e hum an manifest as ghos ts in human form. It follow s t hat the gods were primary, and that worship, or extreme reverence, was first addr essed to them and not to the ancestral spirits, which, according to H. Spencer and his follow ers, had no objective existence. Neither is there any sense in saying the Egypt ian deities were conc eived in animal forms. This is to miss the meaning of Sign - langua ge altoge ther. “Conc eption” has nought to do with Horus being represented by a hawk, a crocodi le, or a calf; Seb by a goos e, Shu by a lion, Rannut by a serpent, Isis by a sc orpion. The primary que stion is: Why were the godde sses and gods or pow ers presented unde r these totemic type s, which preceded the anthrotype in the different mode s of mythical representation? Three of the seven children bor n of the Great Mother have been traced in the por trait of Apt, the old first genetrix, as Sut the hippopot amus, Sebek the crocodi le, and Shu the lion. But there was an earlier pha se of representation with her two children "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"126 Sut and Horus, who were bor n twins. It is the same in the Ka mite mythol ogy as in external nature. The two primary elements were those of darkne ss and light : Sut was the pow er of darkne ss, Horus the pow er of light . In one representation the two elements were imaged by means of the black bird of Sut and the white bir d, or gol den hawk, of Horus. Thus we can identify two elemental pow ers, as old as night and day, which are primeval in uni versal mythol ogy; and these two pow ers, or animistic soul s, were divinized as the two gods Sut and Horus with the two birds of darknes s and light , the black vul ture and the gol d hawk depicted back to back as their two representative type s or persona l totems. The beginni ng with these two primal pow ers is repeated in the mythol ogy of the Blacks on the other side of the world. With them th e crow and hawk (the eagle - hawk) are equi valent to these two birds of darkne ss and light ; and according to the native traditions , the eagle - hawk and crow were first among the ancestors of the hum an race. That is as the first two of the elemental pow ers whi ch became the non - hum an ancestors in mythol ogy. They are also know n as the creators who divided the Murray Blacks into two classes or brotherhoods whos e totems were the eagle - hawk and crow , and who now shine as stars in the sky. (Brough Smyth, v. I, 423 an d 431. ) This is the same poi nt of departure in the beginni ng as in the Kamite mythos with the first two elemental pow ers, viz., thos e of darkne ss and light . These two birds are also equa ted by the black cockatoo and the white cockatoo as the two totems of the Mûkj arawaint in Western Australia. The two animistic soul s or spirits of the two primary elements can be paralleled in the two soul s that are assigne d to man or the Manes in the traditions of certain abor iginal races, called the dark shade and the ligh t shade, the first two soul s of the seven in the Ritual. These, as Egypt ian, are two of the seven elements from which the endur ing soul and total persona lity of man is finally recons tituted in Amenta after death. They are the dark shade, called the Khabsu, and the light shade, called the Sahu. A Zulu legend relates that in the beginni ng there were two mothers in a bed of reeds who brought forth two children, one black, the other white. The wom an in the bed of reeds was Mother - earth, who had been dupl icated in the two mothers who brought forth in space when this was first divided into night and day. Anot her version of the mythical beginni ng with a black and white pair of beings was found by Duff Macdona ld among the natives of Central Africa. The black man, th ey say, was crossing a bridge , and as he looked round he was greatly astoni shed to find that a white man was follow ing him ( Africana , vol . I, p. 75). These are the pow ers of darkne ss and daylight , who were por trayed in Egypt as the Sut - and - Horus twins, one of whom was the black Sut, the other the white Horus, and the two “men” were elementals. The natives on the shor es of Lake Rudol f say that when it thunde rs a white man is bor n. But the white man thus bor n is the flash of light or light ning imaged by an an thropom orphi c figur e of speech. The abor igines of Victoria likewise say the moon was a black fellow before he went up into the sky to becom e light , or white. Horus in Egypt was the white man as an elemental pow er, the white one of 127 "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"the Sut - and - Horus twins, who is som etimes represented by an eye that is white, whereas the eye of Sut was black. In the mythos Horus is divinized as the white god . The children of Horus, who are know n to mythol ogy as the solar race, are the Khut i. These are the white spirit s, the children of light. The solar race at last attained supr emacy as chief of all the elemental pow ers, and in the eschatology the Khut i are the glorious one s. The Khu - sign is a beautiful white bird. This signi fies a spirit, and the spirit may be a hum an ghos t, or it may be the spirit of light , otherwise light imaged as a spirit; thence Horus the spirit of light in the mythol ogy , or the glorified hum an spirit, called the Khu, in the eschatology. The sym bol s of whiteness, such as the white dow n of birds, p ipeclay, chalk, flour , the white stone , and other things employe d in the mysteries of the black races and in their mour ning for the dead, derive their signi ficance from white being emblematic of spirit, or the spirits which originated in the element of lig ht being the white spirit. The turning of black men into white is a primitive African way of describing the transformation of the mortal into spirit. It is the same in the mysteries of the Aleutians, who dance in a state of nudi ty with white eyeless masks upon their faces, by which a dance of spirits is denot ed. With the blacks of Australia the secret “wisdom ” is the same as that of the dark race in Africa. According to Buckley, when the black fellow was bur ied the one word “Animadi ate,” was uttered, which denot ed that he was gone to be made a white man. But this did not mean a Europe an. Initiates in the totemic mysteries were made into white men by means of pipeclay and birds’ dow n, or white masks, the sym bol s of spirits in the religious ceremoni es. This mo de of transformation was not intende d as a com pliment to the pale - face from Europe . Neither did white spirits and black originate with seeing the hum an ghos t. Horus is the white spirit in the light half of the luna tion, Sut in the dark half is “the black f ellow,” because they represent the elements of light and darkne ss that were divinized in mythol ogy. Hence the eternal cont ention of the twins Sut and Horus in the moon. It is com mon in the African mysteries for the spirits to be painted or arrayed in white , and in the custom of pipeclaying the face, on pur pos e to cause dismay in battle, the white was intende d to sugge st spirits, and thus to strike the enemy with fear and terror. Also, when spirits are persona ted in the mysteries of the Arunta and other trib es of Australian abor igines, they are represented in white by means of pipeclay and the white dow n of birds. It is very pathetic, this desire and strenuous ende avour of the black races, from Central Africa to Egypt , or to the heart of Australia, to becom e white, as the children of light , and to win and wear the white robe as a vesture of spiritual pur ity, if onl y represented by a white mask or coating of chalk, pipeclay, or white feathers. Many a white man has lost his life and been made up into medicine by the black fellow s on account of his white com plexion being the same with that assigne d to the good or white spirits of light . In a legend of creation preserved among the Kabinda it is related that God made all men black. Then he went across a great river and called upon all men to follow him. The wisest, the best, the bravest of thos e who heard the invi tation 128 plunge d into the wide river, and the water washed them white. These were the ancestors of white men. The others were afraid to venture. They re mained behind in their old world, and became the ancestors of black men. But to this day the white men com e (as"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"spirits) to the bank on the other side of the river and echo the ancient cry of “Com e thou hither!” saying, “Com e; it is better over here!” (Kin gsley, M. H., Travels in West Africa, pp. 430 , 431 .) These are the white spirits, called the white men by the black races, who originated in the representation of light as an elemental spirit, the same term being afterwards appl ied to the white bird, the w hite god, and the white man. This legend is also to be found in Egypt . As the Ritual show s, there was an ope ning day of creation, designa ted the day of “Com e thou to me.” The call was made by Ra, from the other side of the water, to Osiris in the darkne ss of Amenta — that is, from Ra as the white spirit to Osiris the black in the eschatology. But there was an earlier appl ication of the saying in the solar mythos . In the beginni ng, says the best - know n Egypt ian version, the sun god Temu, whos e name denot es the creator god , having awoke in the Nnu from a state of negative existence, appe ared, as it were, upon the other side of the water, a figur e of sunr ise, and sudde nly cried across the water, “Com e thou to me!” (as spirits). Then the lotus unf olded its petals, and up flew the hawk, which represented the sun in mythol ogy and a soul in the eschatology. Thus Tum the father of soul s, being established in his spiritual supr emacy, calls upon the race of men to com e to him across the water in the track of sunr ise or of the hawk that issued forth as Horus from the lotus. From such an origin in the cour se of time all nature woul d be peopl ed with “black spirits and white,” as animistic entities, or as the children of Sut and Horus; as the black vul tures or crow s of the one , and the white vultures or gol d hawks of the other. Thus we have traced a soul of darkne ss and a soul of light that became Egypt ian gods in the twin pow ers Sut and Horus, and were called the dark shade and the light of other races, the two first soul s tha t were derived as elementals. The anima or breath of life was one of the more obvi ous of the six “soul s” whos e genesis was visible in external nature. This was the element assigne d to Shu, the god of breathing force. In the chapter for giving the breath of life, to the deceased (Rit., ch. 55) the speaker, in the character of Shu, says: “I am Shu, who conve ys the breezes, or breathings . I give air to these young lings as I ope n my mout h.” These youngl ings are the children whos e soul s are thus derived from Shu , when the soul and breath were one , and Shu was this one of the elemental pow ers divinized as male. Messrs. Spencer and Gillen have show n that up to the present time the Arunt a tribes of Central Australia do not ascribe the begettal of a hum an soul to th e male parent. They think the male may serve a purpos e in preparing the way for conc eption, but they have not yet got beyond the incorporation of a soul from the elements of external nature, such as wind or water — that is, the pow er of the air or of water, which was imaged in the elemental deity. Spirit children, derivable from the air, are suppos ed to be especially fond of travelling in a whirlwind, and on seeing one of these appr oaching a native wom an who doe s not wish to have a child 129 will flee as if for her life, to avoi d impregna tion. ( Native Tribes, p. 125 .) This doc trine of a soul suppos ed to be incorpor ated from the elements is so ancient in Egypt as to have been almost lost sight of or conc ealed from view beneath the mask of mythol ogy. The doc tr ine, how ever, was Egypt ian. The insufflation of the female by the spirit of air was the same when the godde ss Neith was impregna ted by the wind. With the Arunt a tribes it is the ordinary wom an who is insufflated by the animistic soul of air. In Egypt , from the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"earliest monum ental period, the female was represented mythically as the Great Mother Neith, whos e totem, so to call it, was the white vul ture; and this bird of maternity was said to be impregna ted by the wind. “Gignunt ur autem hunc in modum . Cum amor e conc ipiendi vul tur exarserit, vul vam ad Boream aperiens, ab eo velut com primitur per dies qui nque ” (Hor - Apol lo, B. I, 11). This kind of spirit not only entered the wom b of Neith, or of the Arunta female; it also went out of the hum an body in a whirlwind . Once when a great Fijian chieftain passed away a whirlwind swept across the lagoon. An old man who saw it cove red his mout h with his hand and said in an awestruck whisper, “There goe s his spirit.” This was the passing of a soul in the likeness of an elem ental pow er, the spirit of air that was imaged in the god Shu, the spirit that impregna ted the virgin godde ss Neith. According to a mode of thinki ng in external things which belonge d to spiritualism, so to say, in the animistic stage, the hum an soul had no t then been specialized and did not go forth from the body as the Ka or hum an doubl e. It was onl y a totemic soul affiliated to the pow er of wind, which came and went like the wind, as the breath of life. To quot e the phr ase employe d by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, a spirit - child was incarnat ed in the mother’s wom b by the spirit of air. The doc trine is the same in the Christian pha se, when the Holy Spirit makes its descent on Mary and insufflates her, with the dove for totem instead of som e other type of brea thing force or soul. There is likewise a survival of primitive doc trine when the Virgin Mary is por trayed in the act of inha ling the fragrance of the lily to procure the mystical conc eption of the Holy Child. This is a mode of inha ling the spirit breath, o r anima, the same as in the mystery of the Arunt a, but with the difference that the Holy Spirit takes the place of the spirit of air, otherwise that Ra, as sour ce of soul , had supe rseded Shu, the breathing force. Such things will show how the most primitiv e simplicities of ancient times have suppl ied our mode rn religious mysteries. We learn also from the Arunt a tribes that it is a custom for the mother to affiliate her child thus incorpor ated (not incarnated) to the particular elemental pow er, as spirit of air or water, tree or earth, suppos ed to haunt the spot where she conc eived or may have qui ckened. (N. T., pp. 124 and 128 .) Thus the spirit - child is, or may be, a reincorpor ation of an Alcheringa ancestor, who as Egypt ian is the elementary pow er divinize d in the eschatology, and who is to be identified by the animal or plant which is the totemic type of either. Not that the animal or plant was suppos ed by the know ers to be transformed directly into a 130 hum an being, but that the elemental pow er or sup erhum an spirit entered like the gus t that insufflated the vul ture of Neith or caused conc eption whether in the Arunt a female or the Virgin Mary. The surroundi ngs at the spot will determine the totem of the spirit and therefore of the spirit - child. Hence th e tradition of the Chur inga - Nanga being droppe d at the place where the mother was impregna ted by the totemic spirit, which, cons idering the sacred nature of the Chur inga , was certainly a form of the Holy Spirit. The spirit of air rushed out of the gap betw een the hills; or it was at the water - hol e, or near the sacred rock, or the totemic tree, that the mother conc eived, and by such means the child is affiliated to the elemental pow er, the animistic spirit, the Alcheringa ancestor, as well as"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"to the totemic group. The mother caught by the power of wind in the gap is the equi valent of divine Neith caught by the air god Shu and insufflated in the gor ge of Neith. The element of life incorporated is the sour ce of breath, or the spirit of air, which woul d have the same natural origin whether it entered the female in her hum an form, or into that of the bird, beast, fish, or reptile. It was the incorpor ation of an elemental spirit, whether of air, earth, water, fire, or vegetation. In popul ar phr aseology runni ng wat er is called living water, and still water is designa ted dead. There is no motion in dead water, no life, no force, no spirit. Cont rariwise, the motion of living water, the running spring or flow ing inunda tion, is the force, and finally the soul of life in the element. Air was the breath of life, and therefore a soul of life was in the breeze. In the deserts of Central Africa the breeze of dawn and eve and the springs of water in the land are very life indeed and the givers of life itself, as they have been from the beginni ng. These, then, are two of the elements that were brought forth as nature pow ers by the earth, the original mother of life and all living things . When the supr eme life - giving, life - sustaining pow er was imaged as a pou ring forth of ove rflo wing energy the solar orb became a figur e of such a fount ain - head or sour ce. But an earlier type of this great welling forth was water. Hence Osiris persona tes the element of water as he who is shor eless. He is obj ectified as the water of renewal. His thro ne in heaven, earth, and Amenta is balanced upon water. Thus the primary element of nut riment has the first place to the last with the root - origin of life in water. Birth from the element of water was represented in the mysteries of Amenta by the rebirth i n spirit from the water of baptism. It is as a birth of water that Child - Horus calls himself the primary pow er of motion. Also “the children of Horus” who stand on the papyrus plant or lotus are bor n of water in the new kingdom that was founde d for the fat her by Horus the son. This too was based upon the water. Hence two of Horus’s children, Tuamutef and Kabhs enuf , are called the two fishes (Rit., ch. 113 ), and elsewhere the follow ers of Horus are the fishers. One of the two lakes in Paradise contained the water of life. It was designa ted the Lake of Sa, and one of the meanings of the word is spirit, anot her is soil or basis. It was a lake, so to say, of spiritual matter from which spirits were derived in germ as the Hammemat. This lake of 131 spirit has a ssuredly been localized in Europe . The supe rstition conc erning spirits that issue from the water is com mon, and in Strathspey there is a lake called Loch Nan Spoi radan, the Lake of the Spirits. When spirit - children were derived from the soul of life that was held to be inhe rent in the element of water, they woul d becom e members of the water - totem — unl ess som e pre - arrange ment interfered. For example, a water - totem is extant in the qua tcha - totem of the Arunt a tribe. A child was conc eived one day by a lubr a of the Witchetty - grub clan who happe ned to be in the neighbour hood of a qua tcha, or water locality. She was taking a drink of water near to the gap in the range s where the spirits dw ell, when sudde nly she heard a child’s voi ce crying “Mia, mia!” the native t erm for relations hip, which include s that of motherhood. She was not anxi ous to have a child, and therefore ran away, but coul d not escape. She was fat and well - favour ed, and the spirit - child ove rtook her and was incorporated willy - nilly. In this instance the spirits were"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Witchetty - grub instead of water spirits of the qua tcha - totem locality, otherwise, if the totem had not been already determined locally, this woul d represent the modus ope randi of the elemental pow er becom ing humanized by incorpor ation. The water spirit is a denizen of the water element, always lying in wait for young , well - favour ed wom en, and ready to becom e embodi ed in the hum an form by the various processes of drinki ng, eating, breathing, or other crude ways of conve rsion and transformati on. The several elements led naturally to the various origins ascribed to man from the ideogr aphi c representatives of earth, water, air, fire, such as the beast of earth, the turtle or fish of water, the bird of air, the tree or the stone . The Samoans hav e a tradition that the first man issued from a stone . His name was Mauike, and he is also reput ed to be the discove rer of fire. Now the discove rer of fire, born of a stone , evidently represents the element of fire which had been foun d in the stone , the ele ment being the animistic spirit of fire, to which the stone was bod y that served as type (Turner, Sam oa, p. 280, ed. 1884) . The derivation of a soul of life from the element of fire, or from the spark, is likewise traceable in a legend of the Arunt a, who t hus expl ain the origin of their fire - totem. A spark of fire, in the Alcheringa , was blow n by the north wind from the place where fire was kindl ed first, in the celestial nor th, to the sum mit of a great mount ain represented by Mount Hay. Here it fell to the earth, and caused a huge conflagration. When this subs ided, one class of the Inapertwa creatures issued from the ashes. These were “the ancestors of the peopl e of the fire - totem,” the peopl e bor n from the element of fire (N. T., p. 445 ). The tradition ena bles us to identify an origin for children born of fire, or the soul of fire, that is, the pow er of this element. Moreove r, it is fire from heaven. It falls as a spark, which spark falls elsewhere in the fire - stone . These particular Inapertwa, or pre - hum an creatures, were discove red by two men of the Wunga ra or wild - duc k totem, and made by them into men and wom en of the fire - totem. Such, then, are the offspring of fire or light , where others are the children of air or of water, as one of the elemental or an imistic pow ers; and the pre - hum an creatures 132 became men and wom en when they were made totemic. The transformation is a sym bol ical mode of deriving the totemic peopl e from the pre - hum an and pre - totemic pow ers which were elemental. There is a class of beings in the German folk - tales who are a kind of spirit, but not of hum an origin, like so many others that are a produc t of primitive sym bol ism, which came to be designa ted elementals because they originated in the phys ical elements. These little earth - me n have the feet of a goos e or a duc k. Here the Kamite wisdom show s how these are the spirits of earth who descende d from Seb, the pow er, spirit, or god of earth, whos e zoot ype in Egypt was the goos e. Thus the earth god or elemental pow er of the mythos beco mes the goos e - foot ed earth man of the Märchen and later folk - lore, which are the débris of the Kamite mythol ogy. The cave - dw ellers in various lands are likewise know n as children of the earth. Their birthpl ace may be described as a bed of reeds, a tree, a cleft in the rock, or the hole in a stone . Each type denot es the earth as primordial bringe r forth and mother of primæval life. Children with soul s derived from the element of earth are also represented by the Arunt a as issuing from the earth viâ “the Erit hipa stone .” The stone , equa l to the earth, is here the equi valent for the parsley - bed"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"from which the children issue in the folk - lore of the British Isles. The word Erithipa signi fies a child, though seldom used in this sense. Also a figur e of the hum an bi rthpl ace is very naturally indi cated. There is a round hol e on one side of the stone through which the spirit - children waiting for incorpor ation in the earthly form are suppos ed to peep when on the look - out for wom en, nice and fat, to mother them. It is th ought that wom en can becom e pregna nt by visiting this stone . The imagery show s that the child - stone not onl y represents the earth as the bringe r forth of life, but that it is also an emblem of emanation from the mother’s wom b. There is an aperture in the s tone ove r which a black band is painted with charcoal. This unm istakably sugge sts the pube s. The painting is always renewed by any man who happe ns to be in the vicinity of the stone (N. T., p. 337) . These Erithipa stone s are found in various places. This m ay expl ain one mode of deriving men from stone s, the stone or rock in this case being a figur e of the Mother - earth. In such wise the primitive representation survives in legenda ry lore, and the myth remains as a tale that is told. Earth, as the birthpl ace in the beginni ng, was typi fied by the tree and stone . A gap in the mount ain range , a cleft in the rock, or the hol e in a stone presented a likeness to the hum an birthpl ace. The mystery of the stone affords an illum inative instance of the primitive mode of thingi ng in Sign - langua ge, or thinki ng in things . Conc eiving a child was thought of as a conc retion of spirit, and that conc retion or crystallization was sym bol ized by means of the white stone in the mysteries. It is the tradition of the Arunt a tribe that when a wom an conceives, or, as they rende r it, when the spirit - child enters the wom b, a Chur inga - stone is droppe d, which is com monl y suppos ed to be marked with a device that identifies the spirit - child, and therefore the hum an child, with its totem. Usual ly the Chur inga is found on the spot by som e of the tribal elders, who depos it it in the Ertnatulunga , or storehous e, in which the stone s of conc eption are kept so sacredly 133 that they must never be looke d upo n by wom an or child, or any uni nitiated man . “Each Chur inga is so closely bound up with the spirit individua l (or the spirit indi vidua lized) that it is regarded as its representative in the Ertnalutunga ” or treasury of sacred obj ects. In this way the Arunt a were affirming that, when a child was con ceived of an elemental pow er, whether bor n figur atively from the rock or tree, the air, the water, or it may be from the spark in the stone that fell with the fire from heaven, or actually from the mother’s wom b, it was in pos session of a spirit that was s upe rhum an in its origin and endur ing beyond the life of the mortal. This was expr essed by means of the stone as a type of permane nce. Hence, when the stone coul d not be identified upon the spot , a Chur inga was cut from the very har dest wood that coul d be f ound . The stone s were then saved up in the repos itory of the tribe or totemic group, and these Chur inga s are the stone s and trees in which primitive men have been ignor antly suppos ed to keep their soul s for safety out side of their ow n bodi es by thos e who k new not hing of the ancient Sign - langua ge.

Touc hing wood or iron, or calling out “Knife!” to be safe, is an appe al to the elemental spirit as a protecting pow er. Setting the poke r upr ight in front of the grate to make the fire bur n is a mode of appe al made to th e spirit of fire in the metal. This, like so many more, has been conve rted to the supe rstition of the cross. The Servians at their Coledar set light to an oak log and sprinkl e the wood with wine. Then they strike it and cause sparks to fly out of it, cryin g, “So many sparks, so many goa ts and sheep! so many sparks, so many pigs and calves! so many sparks, so many successes and so many blessings !” (Hall). These in their way were seekers after life, the elemental spirit of life in this instance being that of fire from the spark. The element of fire was evoke d from both wood and stone . It was their spirit - child. Now , it is a mode of magic to evoke a spirit from these by rubbi ng the wood or stone , or the totems made from either. And this way of kindl ing fire is appl ied by the Arunta for the pur pos e of calling forth the spirits of children from the Erithipa stone s, which are suppos ed to be full of them. By rubbi ng a man can cause them to com e forth and enter the human mother. Clearly the modus ope randi is based on rubbi ng the stone or wood, to kindl e fire from the spark that signi fied a germ or soul of life. Anot her mode of evoki ng the spirit of and from an element may be illustrated by a Kaffir custom . When the girls have com e of age and have suffered the ope ning rite of pube rty, it is the Zulu fashion for the initiate to run stark naked through the first plenteous dow npou r of water, which is characteristically called a “he - rain,” to secure fertilization from the nature pow er. In this custom a descent of the eleme ntal spirit for incorporation is by water instead of fire (or earth, air, or light ), but the principle is the same in primitive animism. Whichever the agent, there is a derivation from a sour ce that is supe rhum an, if onl y elemental. It was the elemental po wers that 134 suppl ied pre - hum an soul s in the primitive sociology. These we term totemic soul s, soul s that were com mon to the totemic group of persons , plants, animals, or stone s, when there was no one soul yet indi vidua lized or distingui shed from the re st as the hum an soul . They coul d not be “the soul s of men” that were suppos ed to inha bit the bodi es of beasts and birds, reptiles and insects, plants and stone s, when there were no soul s of men yet discreted from the pre - hum an soul s in old totemic times. T he human lives, or soul s, are bound up with the totemic animal or bird, reptile or tree, because these represented the same animistic nature pow er from which the soul that is imaged by the totem was derived. The soul in com mon led to the com mon interest, t he mysterious relations hip and bond of uni ty betwixt man and animal and elemental pow ers, or the later gods . It was this totemic soul , com mon to man and animal, which expl ains the tradition of the Papagos that in the early times “men and beasts talked toge ther, and a com mon langua ge made all brethren.” (Bancroft, vol . III, p. 76. ) In the primary pha se the soul that takes shape in hum an form was derived directly from the element as sour ce of life. In a second pha se of representation the pow ers of the element s were imaged by the totemic zoot ype s. Thence arose the uni versal tradition, som etimes called belief, of an animal ancestry in which the beasts, birds, reptiles, fish, plants, trees, rocks, or stone s were the original proge nitors of the hum an race, through the grow ing ignor ance of primitive Sign - langua ge. Spirit - children derived from the elemental pow er of air are described in the Ritual as “the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"youngl ings of Shu,” the god of breathing - force. And as the lion was the totem of Shu, the children woul d or might be derived from the lion as their totemic type . Germs of soul might ascend from the water of life in the celestial Lake of Sa, or soul , as the children of Nnu. The children of Horus are emanations from the sun. As such they have their birth in heaven to b ecom e incorpor ate on the earth, Child - Horus being first, according to the eschatology. It is because the sun was looke d upon at one stage as the elemental sour ce of a soul that its pow er coul d be, as it was, represented by a pha llus. Thence also arose the belief that the sun coul d impregna te young wom en. This will partly expl ain why the female at the time of first menstruation must not be looke d on by the sun. The young and fat Arunt a wom an, fleeing to escape from the embraces of the wind for fear of being impregna ted with the elemental spirit - child, sugge sts a clue. She did not wish to bear a child, therefore she fled from the elemental pow er. In the other case the maiden must not be caught , for fear a soul shoul d be made incarnate unde r the new condi tions . For this reason the young girls were taught that terrible results woul d happe n if they were seen by the sun in their cour ses; and they were cons eque ntly kept in the shade, or were instructed to hide themselves when the time arrived. They were not merely s eclude d at pube rty, but were shut up som etimes darkly for years toge ther, and suspende d on a stage betwixt earth and heaven, as Tabu, unt il the period of pube scence came, at which mom ent they must not be shone upon by the sun, nor breathed on by the air, n or must they touc h the elements of earth or water. They were seclude d and cons ecrated for pube rty, and were shut up from the elements to which generation had been 135 attribut ed by the early human thought , a supe rior element of soul being now recogni zed in the blood of the virgin. Blood was the latest element of seven from which a soul of life was derived. This follow ed the soul of air, water, heat, vegetation, or other force of the elements, and a soul derived from blood was the earliest hum an soul , der ived from the blood of the female. Not any blood, not ordinary menstrual blood, but that blood of the pube scent virgin who was persona lized in the divine virgin Neith, or Isis, or Mary. In the Semitic creation man, or Adam, was created from a soul of blood . Blood and Adam are synonym ous , and the previous races, “which are but spittle,” had derived their soul s, in com mon with the animals, from the elements of external nature that were represented by totems, not by the blood of the mother nor the ancestry of the father. Several forms of an external soul had been derived from the elements of earth, air, and water, and at lengt h a hum an soul was differentiated from the rest. This was the soul of blood which has been traced to the pube scent virgin. The virgin mot her in mythol ogy is onl y typi cal, but the type was founde d in the natural fact that the mother - blood originated with the virgin when the blood was held to be the soul of life. This, to reiterate, was the pube scent virgin ready for connubi um . The virgin Nei th was represented by that bird of blood , the vul ture, who was said to nur se her young on her ow n blood . The virgin Isis was por trayed as the red heifer, when Child - Horus was her red - com plexione d calf. The first rende ring, then, was pre - anthropom orphi c, an d at last the hum an likeness was adopt ed for the soul of blood, and this was imaged in Child - Horus as the soul bor n in the blood of Isis, the divine blood - mother, who was the typi cal virgin.

The hum an soul never was “conc eived as a bird,” but might be imaged as a bird, according to the primitive system of representation. The gol den hawk, for instance, was a bird which typi fied the sun that soared aloft as Horus in the heavens, and the same bird in the eschatology was then appl ied to the hum an soul in its resurrection from the body. Hence the hawk with a hum an head is a com pound imag e, not the portrait of a hum an soul . The celestial poul try that pass for ange ls in the imagination of Christendom have no direct relation to spiritual reality. A feathered ange l was never yet seen by clairvoya nt vision, and is not a result of revelation. W e know how they originated, why they were so represented, and where they came from into the Christian eschatology. They are the hum an - headed birds that were com pounde d and portrayed for soul s in Egypt , and carried out thence into Babyl onia, Jude a, Greece, Rom e, and other lands . In the Cont es Arabe s, publ ished by Spitta Bey, the soul of a female jinn who has becom e the wife of a hum an hus band goe s out of her as a beetle, and when the beetle is killed the female dies. Again, in a German tale the soul of a sl eeping girl is seen to issue from her mout h in the form of a red mous e, and when the mous e is killed the maiden dies. In bot h cases we find Egypt ian sym bol ism surviving in folk - 136 lore. The red mous e was a zoot ype of the soul of blood, the soul derived from the mother of flesh, and, being such, it was cons ecrated as an image of Child - Horus, who was bor n in the blood of Isis; and because it was the figur e of an elemental soul in the ancient sym bol ism, the mous e remained the emblem of the hum an soul in th e Märchen of other nations . The scarabæ us placed in the chest of the deceased to signi fy anot her heart was given to the Manes in Amenta, and the giving of this other heart to the Manes was dramatically represented on the earth by inserting the beetle in th e embalmed body as a typi cal new heart, the beetle being a type of transformation in death. According to Renouf in Parabl es in Folk - lore, we have here the not ion of “a person’ s life or soul being detached from the body and hidde n away at a distance.” “The person, ” he cont inue s, “doe s not appe ar to suffer in the least from the absence of so essential a part of himself.” ( Proceedings Soc . Bib. Arch., April 2, 1889, p. 178 .) But this is not the genesis of the idea. What we find in folk - lore is not cont empor ary evidence for current beliefs. In this the ancient wisdom is cont inua lly repeated without know ledge , and the sym bol s cont inue to be quot ed at a wrong value. The soul or heart of the witch, the jinn, or the giant never was the soul of a mortal. The Arabic j inns originate as spirits of the elements. They appe ar in animal forms because the primary nature pow ers were first represented by the zoot ype s; hence such animals as jackals, hye nas, serpents, and others are called “the cattle of the jinn. ” No hum an soul was ever seen in the gui se of a mous e or a beetle, hawk or serpent, turtle, plant or tree, fire - stone or starry spark, if but for the fact that no one of the soul s had been discreted separately as a hum an soul from the elemental, animistic, or totemic pow e rs which were pre - hum an. It was on the ground of a pre - hum an origin for such soul s that a doc trine of pre - existence, of transmigration, of reincarnation for the soul coul d be and was established, i.e., because it was not the persona l hum an soul . This"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"accou nt of an elemental origin for the earliest soul s of life may help to expl ain that pre - existence of the soul (errone ous ly assum ed to be the hum an soul ) which crops up in legenda ry lore. In the Book of the Secrets of Enoc h it was declared that “Every soul wa s created eternally before the founda tion of the world.” ( Sclavoni c Enoc h, ch. 23, 5.) The pre - existence of soul s is an Egypt ian doc trine, but not of human soul s already indi vidua lized and pos sessing each a persona l identity. They were the elemental soul s, not the ancestral hum an spirits. The Egyp tian Hamemmat survived in Talmudi c tradition as a class of pre - hum an beings . It was held as a Jewish dogm a that the soul s which were to enter hum an bodi es had existed before the creation of the world in the Garden of Eden, or in the seventh, i.e., the highe st, heaven (Chagiga, 12 B ). So the primordial pow ers in the Ritual are identifiable with the divine ancestors who preceded Ra (ch. 178 , 22), and who are called the ancestors of Ra. “Hail ye, chiefs, ancestors of R a!” Elsewhere they are the seven soul s of Ra, when Atum - Ra becom es the one god in whom all previous pow ers are absorbed and glorified. The religious ceremoni es of the Arunt a date from and represent the doi ngs of these ancestors in the Alcheringa at a time when the ancestor as kanga roo was not directly distingui shable from the kanga roo as man. The derivation 137 of soul s from elemental and pre - hum an pow ers is marked when the Arunta claim that each indi vidua l is a direct reincarnation of a totemic ancestor who is still living in the Alcheringa . And, as the same origin is assigne d for the totemic animal, it follow s that the man and animal are brothers, bor n of the same ancestral and pre - hum an soul (N. T., p. 202) . This is indi cated when it is said that the sp irit kanga roo enters the kanga roo animal in just the same way in which the spirit kanga roo man enters the wom b of the kanga roo wom an (N. T., p. 209) . These totemic soul s are the pre - hum an ancestors of the Arunta tribes who lived in their pre - human as well as prehistoric past. “Every native thinks that his (mythical) ancestor in the Alcheringa was the descenda nt of, or is immediately associated with, the animal or plant” “which bears his totemic name.” So intimately in the native mind are these ancestors ass ociated with the totemic type s that “an Alcheringa man says of the kanga roo totem that it may som etimes be spoke n of either as a man kanga roo or a kanga roo man” (N. T., pp. 73, 119, and 132) . The present expl anation is that these ancestors in the Alchering a originated in the supe rhum an nature pow ers or elemental soul s that were first represented by the totems which are afterwards (or also) representative of the totemic motherhood . Thus the origin of the totemic men, in this pha se, was not from the tree or a nimal of the totem whos e name they bor e, but from the elemental pow er or pre - hum an nature - soul from which bot h the man and animal derived a soul of life in com mon, as it was in the Alcheringa or old, old times of the mythical ancestors which in other count ries, as in Egypt , have becom e the gods , whereas in Australia, Inne r Africa, China, Indi a, and elsewhere they remained the ancestors derived from animals, plants, and other zoot ype s that were totemic and pre - human. The derivation and descent of hum an soul s from these supe rhum an elemental nature pow ers was at first direct; afterwards they were represented by totemic zoot ype s in ways already indi cated and to be yet more fully show n. Thus a clan of the Omahas were described as the wind peopl e. The Damaras have kept count of certain totemic descents (or eanda s) from the elemental pow ers when they reckon that som e of their peopl e “com e from the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"sun” and others “com e from the rain” (Galton, Narrative, 137) ; others com e from the tree. The proge nitor, as male, may a nd doe s take the mother’s place in later ages, but the bringe r forth was female from the first. So is it with the type s. Hence the mount , the tree, the cave, the water - hol e, the earth itself were naturally female; inde ed, we might say that locality is femi nine as the birthplace, and the elemental pow er was brought forth as male. In Scotland, persons who bor e the name of “Tweed” were suppos ed to have had the genii of the River Tweed for their ancestors (Roge rs, Social Life in Scotland, III, 336) , which denot es the same derivation from the elemental sour ce, in this instance the spirit of water, as when the Arunt a of the water - totem claim descent by reincorpor ation from the elemental ancestor in the Alcheringa , or as it might be in the Egypt ian wisdom , from the God Nnu, or Num , or Hapi, the descent being traceable at first by the totem, and afterwards by the name. Primitive man has been por trayed in mode rn times as if he were a 138 phi losophi c theorist. He has been charged with imagining all sorts of things w hich never existed, as if that were the origin of his spirits and his gods , whereas the beginni ng was with the elemental pow ers. These were external to himself. There was no need to imagine them. They were. And with this cogni tion his theology began. Primi tive men were taught by the cons istency of expe rience. How ever primitive, they neither had nor pretende d to have the pow er of taking the soul out of the body when in peril, and depos iting it for safety in a tree, or stone , or any other totemic type . Such a delusion belongs to the second childhood of the hum an race rather than to the first. It never was an article of faith even with the most benight ed savages, as will be exemplified. Buns en was one of thos e who have cited the “Tale of the Two Brothers” to pr ove “how deep - seated was the Egypt ian belief in the transmigration of the hum an soul .” But, as before said, Bata, the hero of the transmigrating soul , is not a hum an being! He is a folk - lore form of the mystical hero, the young solar god who issued in the morning or the spring - time from the typi cal tree of dawn. In like manne r the gol den hawk, in the Ritual, brings his heart=soul from the Mount ain of the East, where it had been depos ited in the tree of dawn upon the hor izon. Externalizing the heart or soul in this way was not the act of men who were out of their minds or beside themselves, but simply a mode of sym bol ism which remains to be read in order that the error based upon it may be dispelled. When the nature pow ers are represented as hum an in the folk - tales they assum e a misleading look , and primitive thought is charged with pue rilities of the most recent fashion. It is these elemental soul s that have been mixed up with the hum an soul by Hindus and Greeks, by Buddhi st, Pythagor ean, and Neo - Platoni st, a nd mistaken for the hum an soul in cour se of transmigration through the series which were but representatives of soul s that were distingui shed as non - hum an by thos e who unde rstood the type s. The mantis, the hawk, the ram, the lion, and others in the Ritual are type s of soul s, may be of hum an soul s, but not on this earth. Such were type s of elemental powers first, and next they were cont inue d as indi cators of the stages made in the seven transformations of the Manes in Amenta, the earth of eternity. This imag ery was first appl ied to the pow ers of external nature, and when it is cont inue d in a later pha se the mythical characters becom e mixed up and conf ounde d with the hum an in the minds of those who know no better, or who are at"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"times too know ing ever to know . Once a year the Santals “make simple offerings to a ghos t [or spirit] who dw ells in a Bela - tree” (Hunt er). This is taken by Herbert Spencer to show that the spirit in the tree was derived from the hum an ghos t, which, according to his theory, never existed save in dreams. He poi nts to certain Egypt ian representations of “female forms” “emerging from trees and dispensing blessings ” ( Data, ch. 23, 182) . But in no case has the female any hum an origin or significance. The females are Hathor and Nut, who persona t e the divine mother, not the hum an mother, in the tree, as the giver of food and drink provided by the Mother - earth. As to the “ghos t in the tree,” neither was that derived from the hum an spirit or the shadow seen in dreams. Egypt will tell us what it sign ified, and thereby prove that it did not originate in the hum an ghos t or the Spencerian pha ntom 139 bor n of sleep. “Plant worship,” says the same writer, “is the worship of a spirit originally hum an.” “Everyw here the plant spirit is show n by its conc eive d hum an form and ascribed hum an desires to have originated from a hum an persona lity.” In reply to this it can be show n from the oldest representations know n, viz., thos e of Egypt , that the anthropom orphi c mode of rende ring was not primary, but the latest o f all. Rannut , the godde ss of plant life, was depicted as a serpent, before the human figure was assigne d to her, the sloughi ng, self - renova ting serpent being a zoot ype of renewal in a variety of phe nom ena, includi ng vegetation. Nut in a female form gives the water of life from the tree, but she was previous ly Heaven itself in very person or Heaven typi fied as giver of the water from the tree or milk from the cow . Neither Nut nor Rannut was derived from a spirit originally hum an, but from a pow er in externa l nature that was know n to be supe rhum an. Hathor in the tree was a divinity not derived from any mortal persona lity, and her figure of the divine female in the tree was preceded by that of the wet - nur se as a milch - cow and still earlier as the water - cow . In the Osirian mysteries the so - called “corn spirit” is derived from the water. At Philae the god =the corn spirit is represented with stalks of corn springi ng from his mum my, and, according to the inscription, this is Osiris of the mysteries who springs from the returning waters — as the bringe r of food in the shape of corn. In a vigne tte to the Book of the Dead the pow er of water also is por trayed in “the Great Green One,” a spirit represented by the hierogl yphi c lines that form a figur e of water. This when di vinized is Horus as the shoot of the papyr us plant, or the branch of endl ess years — a type of the eternal manifested by renewal in food produc ed from the element of water in the inunda tion (Pap. of Ani, p. 8). What the picture intimates is that water was th e sour ce of life to vegetation, and the figur e in green arising from the element of water is the spirit of vegetation that was divinized in Horus as the “shoot ” or “natzar,” — a figur e that survives as “Jack” in the green who dances in the pastimes on May - da y. Now here in the range of Egypt ian sym bolism doe s “the plant spirit” originate in or from a hum an persona lity. Might y spirits were suppos ed to dw ell in certain trees by the Battas of Sum atra, who woul d resent and revenge any injury done to them. Such migh ty spirits or pow ers of the elements had grow n up, as Egypt ian, to becom e the godde sses and gods , as Hathor and Nut in the sycamore, Isis in the persea tree, Seb in the shrubs and plants, Horus in the papyr us, or Unbu in the gol den bough ."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" A soul of self - r enewing life in the earth or the tree had been imaged by the serpent, a soul of life in the water had been imaged by the fish, a soul of life in the air by the bird, the elements being represented by the zoot ype s which afterwards became totemic and finally fetishtic. Thus , if the tree were the Nanja of an Australian tribe it woul d stand for the life of the tribe and be the totem of the pre - human soul . And when the hum an soul had been discreted as an indi vidua l soul from the general or tribal soul , the sacre d tree which imaged the life or soul of the tribe might be claimed to represent the soul of a man. This was what did occur. A definite case is know n to Messrs. Spencer and Gillen in which a black 140 fellow earnestly pleaded with a white man not to cut d ow n a particular tree, because it was the Nanja - tree, and he feared that if it were destroye d som e evil woul d befall him persona lly. The tree quâ tree had been a type of self - renewing supe rhum an pow er, then a tribal totem bound up with the life of the trib e, and lastly it is said that the man believed his separate or discreted soul was in the tree, which furnished a place of refuge when his tree soul (or Miss Kings ley’s “bus h soul ”) was in dange r. The reader may depend upon it that primitive man who fancie d he had a separate soul which he coul d hide for safety in a tree, a stone , or an egg is a very mode rn produc t inde ed, the sheerest reflex image of his misinterpreters, who are but speculative theorists that have never mastered the langua ge of the primitiv e signs . As already said, the suppos ed transmigration of hum an soul s, of turtles, or of other zoot ype s was impos sible when as yet there was no hum an soul . The soul that might transmigrate was pre - hum an, elemental, and totemic; a soul that was divisible acc ording to its parts and elemental pow ers, but com mon to life in general and in all its forms in earth and water, air and tree, to man and reptile, fish, insect, bird, and beast. When the sacred bear is killed for food at Usu, Volcano Bay, by the Ainu, they shout , “We kill you, O bear! Com e back soon into an Ainu.” That is as food , which in a sense is the transmigration of soul , but it is that elemental soul of food which is represented by the bear of eternity, and not a hum an soul . There was a doc trine of t he transmigration of soul , or soul s that were not hum an, to warrant the langua ge of the Zuni Indian which he addr essed to the turtle: “Ah! My poor dear lost child, or parent, my sister or brother to have been! Who know s which? May be my ow n great - grandf ath er or mother.” (Cushing, F. H., Century Magaz ine, May, 1883 .) This, how ever, was no transmigration of hum an soul s. We repeat, at that primitive stage of thought no soul was specialized as hum an. There were onl y animistic or totemic soul s; and if the elemen t derived from shoul d be water and the totem be the turtle, the type woul d represent the soul that was com mon to both man and animal, as brother turtles of the water totem, the elemental pow er ove r all being imaged as the turtle that was eternal, one of th e mystical ancestors in the Arunt a Alcheringa , or one of the gods in Egypt . Moreove r, when onc e the soul of blood born of wom an had been discriminated as a hum an soul it was no longe r pos sible to pos tulate a return of that sam e soul to the pre - hum an status .

Readjustment of the standpoi nt was made in the Egypt ian wisdom , but seldom if ever elsewhere. T hus , in Buddhi st metaphys ic the soul cont inue d to pass (theoretically) 141 through the same “cycle of necessity” with the totemic soul s which had been the pre - hum an creatures of the elements, like the “Inapertwa” of the Arunt a. As a result of the soul , h ere termed totemic, having been at one time com mon to men and animals and the elemental pow ers, this led to a perplexing interchange of persona lity, or at least of shape, betwixt the supe rhum an pow ers, the men, and animals in the primitive mysteries and in the later folk - tales or legenda ry lore, in which we seem to hear the very aged mother - wisdom , or her misinterpreters, maunde ring in a state of dot age. It must be bor ne in mind that the earliest mode of becom ing was not by creating, but by transforming. F or instance, when Ptah is imaged as the frog, or beetle, he is the deity as transformer, but when por trayed as the embryo in utero he images the creator or creative cause. A drama of transformation was performed in the totemic mysteries. The boy became a m an by being change d into an animal, which animal was his totemic representative of the provi ding and protecting pow er. This was a mode of assimilating the hum an being to the divine or supe rhum an pow er when it had been imaged in the elemental stage by means of the particular totemic zoot ype , whether animal, bird, fish, insect, reptile, or plant. We gather from the magical practices of the western Inoi ts that when the sorcerer or spirit medium clothes himself in the skin of animals, the feathers of birds, tee th of serpents, and other magical emblems it is done to place himself en rappor t with the kings of the beasts and the pow ers of the elements, for the pur pos e of deriving supe rhum an aid from these our “elder brothers.” This, of cour se, was the natural fact that has been described as making the transformation in the mystery of trance. In that state they were assimilated to and uni ted in alliance with one or other of the primordial pow ers, each of which was represented by its totemic zoot ype . There were spirit medium s extant when the supe rhum an pow ers were elemental (not the ancestral spirits), and these were imaged by the animals and other zoot ype s. Thus the spirit medium s in alliance with certain of these pow ers might be said to assum e their likeness as anima ls, just as in mode rn times the witch is reputed to transform into a cat or hare, or the wizard into a wolf. The blacksmiths in Africa, who are thought to work by spirit agency, are suppos ed in Abys sinia to transform themselves into hye nas. The sorcerers a nd witches, otherwise the spirit medium s, of the Mexicans were said to transform themselves into animals. The Khonds affirm that witches have the pow er of transforming themselves into tigers. Again, when the godde ss Neith and the Arunt a women were insuffl ated by the wind the soul was thus derived directly from the element. But when the bird is introduc ed as the white vulture of Neith or the dov e of Hathor the insufflation may be attribut ed to the bird of air or soul . So with the element of water.

These in the Book of Enoc h are the seven primary pow ers that were the Holy Watchers onc e in heav en and the heirs of life eternal, but whos e origin was as pow ers of the elements such as pur sued the Arunt a daught ers of men. And, whether elemental or astronom ical, they were seven in num ber. They are charged with having forsaken their lofty station and w ith acting like the children of earth. They have “lain with wom en” and “defiled themselves with the daught ers of men.” In the Book of Enoc h the seven have acqui red the character that was attained by the elemental pow ers, and have to be follow ed in the pha s e of legenda ry lore which obf uscates the ancient wisdom , though far less so than doe s the Book of Genesis. It was not as astronom ical pow ers that the story coul d be told of the seven. But as elemental forces pur suing nice fat wom en – like the Arunt a spirits of air – to incorporate themselves they coul d be described as beings who pol luted themselves with wom en; they being spiritual or supe rhum an, whereas the daught ers of men were of the earth earthy. This legend was represented finally in literature by what has been termed “the love s of the ange ls.” The com plexion of these external spirits is likewise elemental. Their various colour s are copi ed straight from nature, and not from the com plexion of human beings . The spirit of darkne ss was black. The spirit of light was white. The spirit of water or vegetation was green. The spirit of air was blue. The spirit of fire was red. The spirit of the highe st god upon the sum mit of the seven upw ard steps is gol den, as Ra the divine or holy spirit in the final eschatology. Th us we can trace the black spirits and white, red spirits and grey, green, or blue, to an elemental origin and show that the spirit as a green man, a blue man, a black man (where there are no blacks), a white man (where there are no whites), a red man, or a gol den child was derived directly from the elements and not from a ghos t that was called into existence by the wizardry of dreams. When hum an spirits were recogni zed and por trayed the same type s and colours were used. The hum an spirit issuing from the red flesh in death is painted blue. Not because spirits were seen to be of that com plexion when “all was blue,” but because the spirit of air or anima had been an elemental spirit in the blue. The spirit in green (vegetation) remains the “green man” as wood s pirit in Europe . The spirit of darkne ss is black as the boge y man, the black Sut in Egypt . The Zuni Indi ans described by Mr. Cushing have a system of praying to the seven great spirits, or nature gods , by means of the seven different colour s which are pain ted on their prayer - sticks. Six of these colour s represent the six regions into which space was divided, the four qua rters, toge ther with the height and depth or zenith and nadir. The pow ers thus localized are called the “makers of the paths of life,” on a ccount of their relations hip to the supr eme one of the seven, who sits at the centre of"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 143 all, and who is the onl y one of them por trayed in the hum an form as the highe st of the seven. Each of these has its ow n prope r com plexion, and the fetishes that r epresent the hum an pow ers are also determined by colour s in the material from which they are mode lled or the pigm ent with which they are painted. The particular pow er prayed to is identified to the ear by imitating the roar or cry of the beast that served for zoot ype , as well as to the eye by its ow n especial colour . And here it may be pos sible to trace what might be termed the “gol den prayer” of the Zuni s. In the ceremoni es of their ancient mysteries an ear of corn is typical of renewal in a future life. I n praying for plenty of food two ears of corn are laid on the body of a dead deer close to the heart. “Prayer meal” made from maize is held in the hand and scattered on the fetish image of the deer, whilst the prayer is addressed to the deer divinity or pr ey - god, as the pow er beyond the fetish. The corn - pol len is offered so that the spirit may clothe itself in yellow or in the wealth of harvest gol d. If this prayer in yellow (equi valent to a prayer - book bound in gol d, or at least gilt - edge d) were addressed to the corn god by the Zuni when he prays for his daily bread and offers the flow er of the yellow maize, the colour of the offering woul d identify it with the colour of the fetish, and therefore with the yellow lion as a zoot ype of the vivifying sun that r ipened the corn to clothe the earth with vegetable gol d. Like the Zuni Indi ans, the Tibetans still pray in accordance with a scheme of colour s. A prayer was lately found upon a “praying wheel” addr essed “To the yellow god , the black god , the white god, and the green god. Please kindl y take us all up with you, and do not leave us unpr otected, but destroy our enemies.” Som e such colour scheme is appa rent in Egypt when Horus is the white god, Osiris is the god in black, Shu the god in red, Amen the god in blue , Num the god in green. In the Egypt ian series of colour s yellow likewise represented corn, which gave the name to the “yellow Neith.” The nature gods were appe aled to and invoke d in want or sickne ss as a primitive kind of doc tors who were looke d to as su perhum an and whos e pow ers were medicines. The pow er of the deer god was the deer medicine, and each medicine represented the special pow er that was besought in hunt ing each particular beast. These are the kind of “spirits” that were prayed to in colour s by primitive races of men, and these colour s, like the glorified globe s in the druggi st’s window , represented the pow ers of the different spirits as medicines. The native doc tors of New Guinea have a scale of colour s with which they paint their patient with the com plexions of correspondi ng spirits. Different colour s denot ed different spirits of healing forces in nature that were representative of the seven elements and seven localities of the spirits. When the Omaha medicine - men are acting as healers of the s ick they will use the move ments and cry with the voi ces of their totemic animals. Not because the animals were a sour ce of healing pow er in themselves, but because the totems had a spiritual relations hip and were the representatives of pow ers beyond the hu man. Thus , in one case the spirits prayed to are identified by their colour s, and in the other by their totemic zoot ype s. If we interpret this according to Egypt ian sym bol ism, when the sick person was 144 "},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"suffering from asthm a he woul d plead his suit in blue to the god of air or breathing - force whilst panting like a sick lion, and the medicine woul d be equi valent to a blue pill.

And if he prayed in red it woul d be to the red Atum , or Horus, the child that was bor n red in the blood of Isis, as the saviour who came appa relled in that colour . The main obj ect at present, how ever, is to distingui sh animism from spiritualism by tracing the difference betwixt the elemental soul s and the ancestral spirits, although animism is a most uns atisfactory title. The “anima” signi fies one of the sev en elemental soul s, but doe s not com prehend the group . Here is one of several clues. The animistic nature pow ers were typified; the ancestral spirits are persona lized. The elemental pow ers are com monl y a group of seven, but spiritualism has no expe rience n or know ledge of seven hum an spirits that visit earth toge ther, or traverse the planetary chain of seven worlds; nor is there any record of the dream persona ges com ing and goi ng in a group of seven, or in seven colour s, not even as a septenary of night mares bor n of seven generations of neurotic sufferers from sevenfold insom nia. In animism, medium s coul d not interview the serpent, bul l, or turtle of eternity in spirit form. On the cont rary, the animistic pow ers have had to be obj ectified and made appa rent by means of these totemic type s. Thus , in animism there are no spirits prope r — that is, no spirits which appe ar as the doubl es of the dead or pha ntasms of the living. It may be allow ed that the spirits of the elements – of air, water, earth, fire, plant or tree – were in a sense ancestral, though not ancestral spirits. But the one were pre - hum an, the others are originally hum an. These animistic pow ers in the Arunt a Alcheringa are called the ancestors who reproduc e themselves by incorpor ation in the life on earth i n the cour se of becom ing man or animal. It was inevitable that there shoul d be som e conf usion here and there betwixt the elemental soul s and the ancestral spirits when the pow er to differentiate the one from the other by means of the type was lost or lapsi ng. It was Kalabar “fash,” the natives told Hutchinson, that the soul s of men passed into monke ys. The Zulus also say there are Amatonga or ancestral spirits who are snakes, and who com e back to visit the living in the gui se of reptiles. Such “fash,” how ev er, is just the conf usion that follow s the lapse of the most primitive wisdom . Both the monke y and the snake had been totemic type s not onl y of the human brotherhoods , but also of the elemental pow ers or soul s. Thus there was an elemental soul of the snake - totem and the ancestral spirits of that same ilk; and the snake remained as representative of both, to the conf oundi ng of the animistic soul with the ancestral spirit at a later stage. But those who kept fast hol d of the true doc trine always and everyw her e insisted that their ancestral spirits did not return to earth in the gui se of monke ys, snakes, crocodi les, lions , hawks, or any other of the totemic zoot ype s. They did not mistake the “soul s” of one categor y for “spirits” in the other, because they kne w the differ - 145 ence. The same distinction that was made by the Egypt ians betwixt the supe rhum an pow ers and the Manes, or the gods and the glorified, is more or less identifiable all the world ove r."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" Thus , the origin of spirits and of religion is twofold . At first the elemental pow ers are propi tiated; next the ancestors are worshippe d. The earliest form of a religious cult was founde d in evoc ation and propitiation of the great Earth - mother, the giver of life and birth, of food and water, as the primary po wer in mythol ogy, who was represented in Egypt by her zoot ype s the water - cow of Apt; the fruit - tree of Hathor , the sow of Rerit, the serpent of Rannut , who was first besought in worship as “the onl y one ,” the great godde ss, the Good Lady, the All - Mother wh o preceded the All - Father. The gods and godde sses of the oldest races were develope d from these supe rhum an nature pow ers which originated with and from the earth as the Universal Great Mother, and not from the ancestral hum an spirits. Also the one is uni ve rsally differentiated from the other. The two classes of gods and spirits, elemental and ancestral, are still propi tiated and invoke d by the natives of West Africa. As Miss Kings ley tells us, one class is called the Well - dispos ed Ones. These are the ancest ral spirits, which are differentiated from the other class, that is referred to as “them,” the generic name for non - hum an spirits. ( West African Studi es, p. 132. ) The religion of the Yao is now pre - eminently a worship of the ancestral spirits, but “beyond and above the spirits of their fathers and chiefs localized on the hills, the Yao speak of others that they cons ider supe rior; onl y their hom e is more associated with the count ry which the Yao left in the beginni ng.” (Duff Macdona ld, vol . I, p. 71.) This was that land of the gods who were the primordial elemental pow ers, the old hom e or primeval paradise of many races. The Yao also distingui shed clearly betwixt the elemental pow er and its zoot ype . “It is usual,” says Mr. Macdona ld, “to distingui sh between the spirit and the form it takes. A spirit often appe ars as a serpent. When a man kills a serpent thus belongi ng to a spirit he goe s and makes an apol ogy to the offende d god , saying, ‘Please, please, I did not know that it was your serpent!’” ( Africana, v ol. I, pp. 62, 63. ) The Thlinke ets empha tically assert that the ancestor of the wolf clan doe s not reappe ar to them in the wolf form. The Maori likewise are among thos e who distingui sh betwixt the Atuas that represent the ancient nature pow ers and the spir its which reappe ar as spectres in the hum an form. They recogni ze the difference between the totemic type and the ancestral hum an spirit. It is our mode rn metaphys ical expl anation and the vague theories of uni versal animism that conf use the gods and ghosts toge ther, elemental spirits with hum an, and the zoot ype s with the pre - totemic ancestors. The Ainu peopl e recogni ze two classes of gods and spirits. The first are know n as the “distant gods ,” thos e who are remote from hum an beings . The others are the “near at hand, ” correspondi ng to the spirit ancestors of other races. (Batchelor, Rev. Y., The Ainu of Japan, p. 87. ) The Shintoism of the Japanese show s the same dua l origin of a cult that is primitive and uni versal, which was based first on a propi tiation of t he nature pow ers, and secondl y on the worship of ancestral spirits. The number and the nature of these pow ers as the Great Mother and 146 the seven or the eight Kami are the same in Japan as in the land of Kam. The Vedda hs of Ceylon, who worship “the sha des of their ancestors and their children,” also hol d that “the air is peopl ed with spirits; that every rock, every tree, every forest, and every hill, in shor t every feature of nature, has its genius loci.” Here again we have the two classes of"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"ancestral spirits, hum an in origin, and the animistic spirits derivable from the elements. The “gods ” of the Samoans were thos e elemental pow ers that were represented by the zoot ype s. “These gods ,” says Turner, “are suppos ed to appe ar in som e visible incarnation, an d the particular thing (or living type ) in which the god appe ared was to the Samoan an obj ect of veneration. It was, in fact, his ‘idol ’ (or his totem). One, for instance, saw his god in the eel, anot her in the shark, anot her in the lizard,” and so on thro ugh all the range of external nature. (Turner, Sam oa, p. 17, ed. 1884. ) With the Eskimo the nature spirits are quite distinct from the ghos ts of hum an beings . Som e of the former are allow ed to the com mon peopl e as obj ects of religious regard, but it is th e spirits of hum an beings, the dead ancestors or relatives of the living, who inspire or otherwise manifest through the abnor mal medium called the Ange kok. Everyw here it is the reappe aring spirits of the dead, and they alone , who can demons trate a cont inui ty of existence for the living. The original pow ers or gods of the elements that were represented by the zoot ype s are very definitely discriminated by the Tonga ns from the spirits of hum an beings . They do not mix up or conf use their gods with their ghos ts. Their primal gods were not ghos ts. These do not com e as appa ritions in the hum an likeness, or as shadow s of the dead. When they appe ar to men, it is said to be in their primitive gui se of lizards, por poi ses, water - snakes, and other elemental totemic type s ; whereas the ghos ts of nobl es and chiefs, who alone are suppos ed to have the pow er of com ing back, or of being on view, are not permitted to appe ar in the shape of lizards, por poi ses, and water - snakes, the representatives of the original gods . So the Bank s Islande rs recogni ze and distingui sh two classes of supe rnatural pow ers, in the spirits of the dead and thos e that never have been hum an. These are their gods and ghos ts, the gods and the glorified. The nature pow ers are called Tamate, the ghos ts are desi gna ted Vui. As with the Tonga ns, the Papua n ghos ts of the nobl es are nearest in status to the great or primary pow ers, but are not to be conf ounde d with them; being of different origin in this world, they do not blend toge ther in the next. This show s that in bot h cases the gnos is is not qui te extinct. (Codr ingt on, Jour nal Anthrop. Institute, February, 1881 .) Kramer tells us that the Niassans worship bot h gods and ancestors, and that the two kinds of supe rhum an beings are never conf ounde d by them. The two ar e kept perfectly distinct, and each has a different terminol ogy . (Cited by Max Müller in Anthropol ogi cal Religion, Lecture X.) This distinction made betwixt the elemental gods and the ghos ts of ancestors is show n by the Institutes of Menu. “Let an offering to the gods be made at the beginni ng and end of the Sraddha . It must not begin and end with an offering to ancestors, for he who begins and ends it with an obl ation to the Pitris qui ckly perishes with his proge ny.” (Works of Sir W. Jone s, vol . III, pp. 14 6 - 7.) Amongst 147 all the “spirits,” the appa rition or ghos t is solely human. There is no pretence of seeing the ghos ts of animals. The great spirit or great bear of the Ainus remains a bear. The great spirit as the turtle of the Zuni s remains a turtle. The great spirit of the Samoans remains an ow l. Their representatives are the bear, the turtle, the ow l, and not the appa rition of a bear, a turtle, or an ow l. The zoot ype s have no spiritual manifestations or pha ntasms. Only the soul s of human beings reapp ear as ghos ts. Thus we demons trate that the worship of hum an ancestors alone was not the primary pha se of religious worship."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" We must needs be careful not to get the “divinity” conf ounde d with the “divine persona ge.” But we may say there was no killing of the god , the tree spirit, the corn spirit, or the spirit of vegetation, in the Frazerian sense, and of put ting the deity to death to save him from old age, disease, and decay, and magically bringi ng him to life again in a more yout hful form. This is anot he r result of mixing up the two classes toge ther by the mode rn non - spiritualist. The abor igines kne w better. The death of the sacred bird, with the Samoans, was “not the death of the god . He was suppos ed to be yet alive, and incarnate in all the ow ls in exis tence.” (Turner, Sam oa, p. 21. ) So was it with the turtle of the Zuni s, the panes - bird of the Acagchemen Indi ans, and the bul l of Osiris, called “the Bull of Eternity.” In killing the goos e of Seb or the calf of Horus, the bul l of Osiris or the meriah of t he Khonds , the partakers of the sacrament had no more thought of killing the god or nature pow er as a mode of rejuve nation than they had of killing the earth which produc ed the food . Also the spiritual theory will most satisfactorily explain the motive fo r killing and eating the divine persona ge, whether as the mother or the mona rch, whilst the victim was com paratively young , in good health, and whol ly exempt from any bodi ly infirmity. The slaying and eating were performed as a religious rite and a mode of spiritual com muni on. This implies a sacrificial offering to the gods or spirits, which had to be as pur e and perfect as pos sible. In the rubrical directions of the Hebrew ritual it is expr essly com mande d that the sacrificial offering shall be presented “w ithout blemish” otherwise it is una cceptable to the Lord. The death or dyi ng dow n of the food - produc ing pow er as Osiris was a fact of annua l occurrence in external nature. This death of the self - devot ed victim was solemnized and mour ned ove r in the mysteri es, where the chief obj ect of celebration was the resurrection of Osiris, as the sun from the nether world, or the returning waters of the inunda tion; or as Horus in the lentiles, or Unbu in the branch of gol d, or the hum an soul resurgent from the mummy in the mysteries of Amenta. This was the divinity who has to be distingui shed from the typi cal divine persona ge. We learn from the eschatology, by which the mythology was suppl emented and fulfilled, that there were seven food - givers altoge ther in a female fo rm. These are groupe d as the seven Hathor s, or milch - mothers, in the mythol ogy called “the provi ders of plenty” for the glorified elect, in the green pastures Aarru, or the Elysian Fields. The earliest representation being totemic and pre - hum an, the mythic al mother was por trayed by means of the zoot ype . 148 The wet - nur se was imaged as a cow or a sow . The mother of aliment was figur ed in the tree. The earth itself was imaged as the goos e, or other zoot ype , which laid the egg for food. The Red Men say “the bear, the buffalo, and the beaver are manitus (spirits) which furnish food .” (School craft, Indi an Tribes, vol . V, 420. ) They were totems of the elemental pow ers that were propi tiated as the givers of food . Now , the first giver of food and drink was the Mot her - earth, who was represented by the zoot ype s which furnished food and drink. The elemental spirits as produc ers of food may be seen in the Aztec “popul vuh” as “they that gave life,” a group of primordial pow ers, with such names as shoot er of the coyot e, opos sum , and other animals with the blow - pipe — a naïve way of describing the supe rhum an provi ders of food in the character of the hunt er. The Zuni"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"“prey - gods ” are also propi tiated as supe rhum an powers in animal forms, the gods of prey that are the givers o f food. (Amer. Bureau of Ethnology, 1880 - 81. ) In the Arunta stage of mythical representation there are no godde sses or gods . The pow ers of the elements were not yet divinized; they are onl y know n, like the human groups , by their totemic type s. Whereas in t he wisdom of ancient Egypt we can identify the elemental pow ers and trace them by nature and by name into the pha se of divinities, whether as godde sses or gods . Thus we are enabled to reach back to the supe rhuman pow ers in totemism that preceded the gods and godde sses in mythol ogy. Instead of gods and godde sses, the Arunt a tribe have their mythical ancestors, who were kanga roos , emus, beetles, bandi coot s, dingoe s, and snakes, as totemic representatives of elemental forces, especially thos e of food and drin k, in the primordial Alcheringa , who were incorporated or made flesh on earth in bot h men and animals. In the Egyp tian eschatology these primordial pow ers finally became the Lords of Eternity. But from the first they were the ever - living one s unde r pre - ant hropom orphi c totemic type s. Osiris, for example, remains in the Ritual as “the Bull of Eternity.” Atum was the Lion of Eternity. And when bot h had been personi fied in the hum an likeness the zoot ype still survived. Thus the beast, the bird, the fish, which represented the pow ers of the elements, which were of themselves ever - living, furnished natural type s of the eternal. Again, the hum an descent from the elemental pow ers is indi cated by the tradition of the Manx which asserts that the first inha bitants of t heir island were fairies, and that the little folk, called the good peopl e, still exist among them and are to be seen dancing on moonl ight night s, the same as in the Emerald Isle: — “Wee folk, good folk, Trooping altogether; Green jacket, r ed cap, And white owl’s feather.” In relation to spiritism, the present demons tration has hitherto been limited to the animistic “spirits” or elemental pow ers that were pre - hum an, supe rhum an, and entirely non - hum an. We now com e to the spirits of h um an origin which manifest as pha ntom s of the living and as doubl es of the dead. 149 The origin of the “gods ” was in the pow ers of the elements, with a magical evoc ation and propi tiation of these pow ers ever manifesting in external nature, especially as givers of food and drink, with the ritual based on blood. But the most essential part of religion assuredly originated in the worship of the ancestral spirits. Only there must be the spirits of hum an origin discriminated from the animistic spirits or elem ental pow ers as the raison - d’être of the worship. The feeling of fear and dread of the destroyi ng pow ers was follow ed at a later stage of developm ent by the natural affection for the mothers, the fathers, and children, who were uni versally propi tiated as t he ancestral spirits. Spiritualism prope r begins with the worship of ancestral spirits, the spirits of the departed, who demons trate the cont inui ty of existence hereafter by reappe aring to the living in phe nom enal appa rition, the same to the races called c ivilized as to thos e who are suppos ed to “believe in ghos ts” because they are savages. Herbert Spencer proclaims that “the first traceable conc eption of a supe rnatural being is the conc eption of a ghos t” ( Data,"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"p. 281) . Here in passing we may not e that the word “supe rnatural,” cont inua lly employe d by the agnos tics, belongs , like many others, to an obsolete terminol ogy which has no meaning for the evol utioni st. There was no supe rnatural when there coul d have been no definition of the natural. In the present work the word supe rhum an is made use of as being more exact. The elemental pow ers were superhum an, yet they were entirely natural. A brief but com prehensive account of Inne r African spiritualism is given by the author of Three Years in Sav age Africa, who says: “The religion of the Wanya mwezi is founde d mainly on the worship of spirits called the ‘Musimo.’ Their ceremoni es have but one obj ect, the conc iliation or propi tiation of these spirits. They have no idea of one supr eme pow er or God – persona l or impers ona l – gove rning the world, and directing its destinies or thos e of indi vidua ls. They believe in the earthly visitation of spirits, especially to announc e som e great event, and more generally som e big disaster. Thus they tell how the Chief Mirambo one day me t a num ber of Musimo carrying torches, who invi ted him to follow them into the forest, which he did. Once there, they attempted to dissuade him from proceeding with a war which he was then cont emplating, and in which he subs eque ntly lost his life. The dead in their turn becom e spirits, unde r the all - embracing name of Musimo. The Wanya mwezi hol d these Musimo in great dread and veneration, as well as the hous e, hut , or place where their body had died. Every chief has near his hut a Musimo hut , or hous e of the dead, in which they are suppos ed to dw ell, and where sacrifices and offerings must be made. They are cons tantly cons ulting oracles, om ens, and signs , and attach great importance to them.” When desirous of cons ulting the spirits, “the party betakes itself to the Musimo hou se, in front of which the Mfum u (medium ) stands with the others arrange d in a circle behind him. The Mfum u then hol ds a kind of religious service: he begins by addr essing the spirits of their forefathers, imploring them not to visit their ange r upon their descenda nts. This prayer he offers up kne eling, bow ing and bendi ng to the ground from time to time. Then he rises and com mences a hym n of praise to the ancestors, and all join 150 in the chor us. Then, seizing his little gour d, he execute s a pas seul, after which he bursts into song again, but this time singi ng as one inspired. Sudde nly he stops and recove rs himself. All this time, except when chanting, the spectators obs erve a most profound stillness. After a brief interval of silence the Mfum u proceeds to publ ish the message which he has just received from the Musimo. This he doe s by intoni ng in a most mour nful and dreary manne r. The cong regation then retire, and wind up the proceedings with a noi sy dance in the village.” (Lione l Décle, T hree Years in Sav age Africa, pp. 343 - 345. ) According to Giel, the pigm ies of the Ituri Forest, at the low est poi nt in the ascent of man, propi tiate and invoke the spirits of their ancestors; they also bui ld little hut s for them to rest in and make offering s of food to their spirit visitants (Giel, W. E., A Yank ee in Pigm y Land ). The Lendu to the west of Lake Albert, who are worshippe rs of the ancestral spirits, are accustom ed to carry rough woode n dol ls suppos ed to represent the departed, and place them in the deserted hut s in which their dead lie bur ied (Johns ton) . African spiritualism, which might be vol um inous ly illustrated, culminated in the Egypt ian mysteries. The mystery teachers were so far adva nced as phe nom enal"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"spiritualists, and say so little abou t it in any direct manne r, that it has taken one who ow ns to having had a profound expe rience of the phe nomena many years to com e up with them in studyi ng the eschatology of the Ritual.

Current anthropol ogy k now s not hing of man with a soul that offers evidence for a cont inui ty of its ow n existence. The Egypt ians had no more doubt about it than the Norsemen who used to bring legal actions against the spirits of the dead that came back to haunt and torture the l iving, and were accused on evidence and adjudge d to be guilty. There is a like case in a papyr us translated by M. Maspero ( Records of the Past, vol . XII, 123) . In this an Egypt ian widow er cites the spirit of his deceased wife to a law cour t, and forbids he r to torment or persecute him with her unw elcom e attentions . He asks what offence did he ever com mit in her lifetime that shoul d warrant her in causing him to suffer now . He speaks of the evil condi tion he is in, and of the affidavit he has made. This writ ing is directed to the gods of Amenta, where it is to be read in judgm ent against her. M. Maspero sugge sts that the writ woul d proba bly be read aloud at the tom b, and then tied to the statue of his wife, who woul d receive the sum mons in the same way that s he was accustom ed to receive the offerings of prayer and food by proxy at certain times of the year. The Egypt ians were profound ly well acqua inted with thos e abnor mal phe nom ena which are just re - emerging within the ken of mode rn science, and with the hypno tic, magne tic, narcotic, and anæ sthetic means of induc ing the condi tions of trance. Their rekhi or wise men, the pur e spirits in both worlds, are primarily thos e who coul d enter the life of trance or transform into the state of spirits, as is show n by the determinative of the name, the phœ nix of spiritual transformation. 151 Ancestor worship is made appa rent in the Book of the Dead by the speaker in the nether world, who asks that he may behol d the forms of his father and his mother in his resurrection f rom Amenta (ch. 52). And when he attains the dom ain of Kan - Kanit on Mount Hetep, where the joy is expr essed by dancing, he prays that he may see his father and intently view his mother (Rit., ch. 110) . It is said of one of the magical formulæ, “If thou rea dest the second page it will happe n that if thou art in the Amenta thou wilt have pow er to resum e the form which thou hadst upon the earth” ( Records of the Past, vol . IV, 131 - 134 ). In one of the Egypt ian tales the writer describes the dead in the tom bs con versing about their earth life, and as having the pow er of leaving the sepul chre and mixing onc e more with the living on this earth. The Egypt ian Book of the Dead is based upon a resurrection of the soul in Amenta and its pos sible return to the earth at ti mes, for som e particular pur pos e, as the doubl e or ghos t. The deceased when in Amenta prays that he may emerge from the world of the dead to revisit the earth (Rit., ch. 71) . He asks that he may com e forth with breath for his nos trils and with eyes which c an see, and that he may shine upon his ow n ka - image from withou t, not that he may becom e a soul within an idol of wood or stone . The persistence of the hum an soul in death and its transformation into a living and endu ring spirit is a funda mental pos tulate of the Egypt ian Ritual and of the religious mysteries. The bur ial of the mum my in the earth is coincident"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"with the resurrection of the soul in Amenta, which is follow ed by its pur ifications and refinings into a spirit that may be finally made perfect. In t he ope ning chapter the departing soul of the deceased pleads that he may be cons cious in death, to see the lords of the nether world and to inha le the “incense of the sacrificial offerings made to the divine hos t — sitting with them.” He prays: “Let the prie stly ministrant make invoc ations ove r my coffin. Let me hear the prayers of propi tiation. ” Not as the dead body, but as a living spirit (ch. 1). He also pleads that when the Tuat is ope ned he may “com e forth to do his pleasure upon earth amid the living” ( ch. 2). The Egypt ians know not hing of death except in the evil that eats out the spiritual life. The dead are thos e that do not live the spiritual life, no matter where. These are called the twice dead in the spirit world. It will suffice to show how profo und the spiritualism must have been when the prayers and invoc ations are made, the obl ations and the sacrifices are offered, not to the person of the deceased (who is represented by the dead mum my), but to the ka - image of his eternal soul , which was set up in the fune ral chamber as the likeness of that other spiritual self to whos e cons cious ness they made their religious ly affectiona te appe al. They make no mistake as to the locality of cons cious ness. Their fune ral feast was a festival of rejoicing, not of m our ning. When Unas makes his passage it is said, “Hail, Unas! Behol d, thou hast not departed dead, but as one living thou hast gone to take thy seat upon the throne of Osiris” (Budge , Gods of Egypt, vol . I, 61). The sacred rites were duly paid to the depar ted not merely “in memory of the dead,” but for the delectation of the re - embodi ed ka that lived on in death. The dead were designa ted the ever - living. The coffin was called the chest of the living. No eye might look on the prepared 152 mum my in its last resting place but the eye of its spiritual ow ner, who came back to see that it was prope rly preserved in sepul chral sanctity, a small aperture being left in the wall of the Serdab through which the returning spirit alone might pass, to see the mum my, when it returned on a visit to the earth. We learn from the vigne ttes to the Ritual that the soul might revisit the earth when it had attained the status of the Ba, which is imaged as the hawk with a hum an head. In this shape it descends and ascends the ladde r or staircase that was erected as the way up from the Kâsu or bur ial place to the boa t of soul s. In the first stage of cont inui ty hereafter the soul persists visibly as the shade. This form of the Manes is com monl y associated with the mummy in the tom b wh ere it received the mortuary meals that were offered to the dead. It was held by som e that the shade remained as warder of the mum my, or corpse, and never left the earth. When the deceased has passed the forty - two tribun als of the Judgm ent Hall he is told that he can now go out of the Amenta and com e in at will as an enfranchized spirit. It is said to the Osiris, “Enter thou in and com e forth at thy pleasure like the Glorified Ones; and be thou invoked each day upon the Mount of Glory” (Rit., ch. 126 , 6). H e has now becom e one of the glorified, the spirits who are appealed to as protectors — that is, the ancestral spirits, the hos t of whom he joins to becom e the obj ect of invoc ation and propi tiation or of worship on the Mount of Glory. The clairvoya nts in the Kamite temples were designa ted seers of the gods and the spirits. In speaking of his forced exclusion from office in the Temple of Amen, Tahtmes the Third says: “So long as I was a child and a"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"boy I remained in the Temple, but not even as a seer of the god did I hol d office” ( Egypt unde r the Phar aohs , Brugs ch, Eng. trans., vol . I, p. 178) . In the “Second Tale of Khamuas” there is a cont est between the Ethiopi an and Egypt ian magicians. Amongs t other tests of supe riority, the Ethiopi ans bring writing as a cha llenge to the Cour t of Pharaoh. This has to be read without ope ning the letter or breaking the seal. Then said Si - Osiris to his father, “I shall be able to read the letter that was brought to Egypt without ope ning it, and to find what is written on it with out breaking its seal.” The father asks what is the sign that he can do this. Si - Osiris answers, “Go to the cellars of thy hous e: every book that thou takest out of the case I will tell thee what book it is and read it without seeing it.” This he doe s, and then he show s the supe riority of Egypt ian magic ove r the sorceries of the Ethiopi ans by reading the cont ents of the letter without ope ning it or breaking the seal. (Griffith, Stories of the High Priests of Memphi s, pp. 51 - 60. ) The mode in which the clair voya nt faculty was made use of in the mysteries for seeing into the world beyond death is also illustrated by the priest who is por trayed as the dreamer with the dead. He is called the Sem - priest, and is represented as being in the tom b and sleeping the sl eep in which he was visited by the glorified. The recum bent Sem awakes when the other officiating ministrants arrive at the sepul chre. His first words are, “I see the Father in his form entire.” That is Osiris in his character of Neb - er - ter. In his demise Osiris was represented as being cut in pieces, by his enemy Sut, as a 153 mode of depicting death to the sight of the initiates. That which appl ied to Osiris also appl ied to the dead in Osiris. They were figuratively cut in pieces as the tangi ble equi val ent for abstract death. “I see the Father in his form entire” was the formula of the Sem - priest as sleeper and seer in the tom b and as witness and testifier that the dead in Osiris were living still. “How wonde rful! He no longe r existed.” And now , “What ha ppi ness! He exists, and there is no member missing to the Manes” ( i.e., the hum an soul in Amenta). (Prof. E. Lefébur e, Proc. Soc . Bib. Arch., vol . XV, pt. 3, p. 138 .) All ancestor worshippe rs have been spiritualists in the mode rn sense who had the evidenc e by practical demons tration that the so - called dead are still living in a rarer, not less real form. The ancestral spirits they invoke and propi tiate were onc e hum an, not the elemental or animistic forces of external nature, which unde r the name of spirit s have been conf used with them. Their belief in a persona l cont inui ty has ever been firmly based on phe nom enal facts, not merely floated on ideas. The evidence that deceased person s make their reappe arance on the earth in human gui se is uni versal; also tha t the doubl es of the dead suppl ied both ground and origin for a worship of ancestral spirits that were hum an onc e in this life and still retained the hum an likeness in the next, and manifested in the hum an form. The Karens say the Lâ (or ghos t) som etimes a ppe ars after death, and cannot then be distingui shed from the deceased person. In the opi nion of the Eskimo the soul (or spirit) exhi bits the same shape as the body it belonge d to (Rink) , but is of a more subt le and ethereal nature, as is the Egypt ian Sahu or spiritual body . The Tonga Islande rs held that the hum an soul was the finer, more aëriform, part of the body — the essence that can pass out as doe s the fragrance from a flow er. The islande rs of the Antilles found that the ghos ts vanished when they tried to clutch them. The Greenland"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"seers described the soul as pallid, soft, and intangi ble when they attempted to seize it. “Alas! then,” says Achilles, as he tries to embrace the spirit of Patroclus, “there is inde ed in the abode s of the shades a spirit and a n eid ō l on, but it is uns ubs tantial.” Mr. Cushing tells us that, whatsoever opi nions the ancestors of the Zuni s may have held regarding the so - called “transmigration of soul s,” their belief to - day relative to the future life is spiritualistic. When a corpse had been bur nt by the Hos they still called upon the spirit to com e back to the world of the living. It is held by them that the spirit lives on, although the dead body is reduc ed to ashes. The author of Africana testifies that the Central African tribes among whom he lived were una nimous in saying there is som ething beyond the body which they call spirit or pur e spirit, and that “every hum an being at death is forsaken by the spirit.” Hence they do not worship at the grave. “All the prayers and offerings o f the living are presented to the spirits of the dead” (vol . I, p. 59). It is com mon for the Yao to leave an offering beside the head at the top of their beds intende d for the spirits who it is hope d will com e and whisper to the sleeper in his dreams. Thei r spirits appe ar to them in sleep and also in waking visions , which are carefully discriminated from dreams of the night by them as by all intelligent abor igines, and not conf used the one with the other, as is generally done by the Europe an 154 agnos tic. (Duff Macdona ld, Africana, vol . I, pp. 60 - 61. ) The Banks Islande rs pray to their dead men, and not to the elemental pow ers or animistic spirits. The Vateans call upon the spirits of their ancestors, whom they invoke ove r the kava bow l — that is, the divine drink which is taken by the seers for the pur pos e of entering into rappor t with the spirits. When the Zulu King Cetewayo was in London he said to a friend of the present writer, “We believe in ghos ts or spirits of the dead because we see them.” But when as ked whether the Zulus believed in God, he said they had not seen him. For them the ghos t demons trates its ow n existence; the god is but an inference, if necessary as a final expl anation of phe nom ena. The ghos t can be obj ectively manifested; the deity must be ideally evol ved. The Amazulu say the same thing as Cetewayo: “We worship thos e whom we have seen with our eyes, who lived and died amongs t us. All we know is that the young and the aged die and the shade departs.” These shades were propi tiated. That is the uni versal testimony of all races, savage or civilized. They believe in ghos ts because they see them. The ghos t is the supr eme verity in universal spiritualism. As Huxl ey says, “there are savages without God in any prope r sense of the word, but there ar e none without ghos ts” ( Lay Sermons and Addr esses, p. 163) . The colossal conc eit of obt use mode rn ignor ance not withstandi ng, the ghos t and the faculty for seeing the ghos t are realities in the dom ain of natural fact. The seers may be com paratively rare, al though the clairvoya nt and seer of spirits (as a produc t of nature) is by no means so scarce as either a great painter or great poe t. These abnor mal faculties are hum an, and they can be increased by cultivation. Their existence is for ever being verified l ike other facts in nature, and the truth is ultimately know n by the experience which is for ever being repeated. It is a fune ral custom of the Amande bele, one of the Bantu tribes, to introduc e the spirit of a deceased person to his father, his grandf ather, and other relatives, of whos e cons cious existence and persona l presence no doubt is entertained. These are matters of life and death with the primitive races. The spirits com e to announc e the death of"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"indi vidua ls. They see the ghos t, they hear its message , and they die to the day or hour foretold. “I coul d give many instances which have com e within my ow n know ledge among the Fijians,” says Mr. Fison ( Kam ilaroi and Kernai , p. 253) . Mr. Spencer tells us that “Negroes who when suffering go to the woods and cr y for help to the spirits of dead relatives show by these acts the grove lling nature of the race” ( Data of Soc iology , ch. 20, par. 151 ). Whether the spirits are thought to be a reality or not , this appe ars one of the most natural and touc hing of hum an acts , aspiring rather than grove lling, especially as the relative addr essed is so com monl y the mother, the African mama. But is it grove lling to cling to the love d and lost? — to turn for com fort to the dear one s gone , and seek a little solace if onl y in the mem ory that leaned and rested on them in the solitude of their suffering? Here the “great teacher of our age” is far behind the nigge r. He did not know that the “spirits of dead relatives” are and always have been a demons trable reality, and thos e who do not know have no author ity for giving judgm ent on the subj ect. They who have no 155 dead lost friends to feed, to invoke , or to love may look on such ceremoni es as savage or insensate, but to thos e who have, and who still offer them the food of affection, su ch actions are but the primitive exhi bition of our modern spiritualism in its simple childhood, and they have for us som ething of the tende r and touc hing charm of infancy, even when the first has now becom e a sort of second childhood through lengt h of time and lapse of know ledge and loss of memory. The Peruvi ans declared that the reason why they buried prope rty with their departed friends was because they had seen thos e who had long been dead walking ador ned with the clothes and jewels which their friends had bur ied with them. West African Negroes have been so sure of their cons cious cont inui ty hereafter that when they were slaves in far - off lands they have killed themselves on pur pos e to revisit and re - live in their old hom es. We have it on the author ity o f Livings tone that the Manye ma tribe of Africans exul ted in the assurance that after death the suffering one s woul d be able to com e back when they were set free to return and haunt and torture thos e who had sold them into slavery during their life on earth . Mariner mentions the case of a young Tonga n chief who was pur sued by the spirit of a dead wom an. She, having fallen in love with him, besought him to die and go to her; and he died accordingl y. The Karens hol d that the dead are onl y divided from the livi ng by a thin white veil which their seers can penetrate. The Kaffirs when fight ing used to leave ope n spaces in their line of battle for their dead heroes to step into and stop the gap in fight ing for them shoul der to shoul der and side by side. First of a ll, there is a class of custom s intende d to prevent the dead from returning in spirit. The living will do anyt hing in their pow er by way of propi tiation, bribery, and flattery for the dead not to com e back. All they needed in this life was suppl ied to them for the next: food, drink, clothes, hor ses, weapons , slaves, and wives in abunda nce. For if the dead were in need of anyt hing it was feared that they might pursue and haunt the living. The Zulu Kaffirs say that diseases are caused by the spirits of the de ad to com pel the living to suppl y them with offerings of meat and drink. It was a custom of the Fijians to pou r out water after the corpse to hinde r the ghos t from com ing"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"back, water being the element oppos ed to breath, to spirit or spirits — “a runni ng stre am they daurna cross!” The Siamese break an ope ning through the wall of a house, pass the coffin through, and carry the corpse round the hou se three times to prevent the spirit from findi ng its way back. The Hottentots make a hol e in the wall of their hut and carry the dead body through it, closely bui lding it up immediately afterwards. We may smile, but unt il lately we had the relic of a belief as simple. We used to run a stake through the bodi es of our suicides, bur ied at the cross - roads, to pin them to t he cross and not allow them to walk or wande r as ghos ts. This custom of barring the passage back was practised by black men, red men, yellow men, and white men — therefore it was uni versal. An Australian abor igine will cut the right thum b off the hand of his dead enemy, so that the returning ghos t shall not be able to handl e a spear or club if he shoul d com e back. Many other races pur pos ely maimed their dead. When 156 Clytemnestra put her hus band to death she took the precaution of having him “arm - pitted” — t hat is, of having his hands cut off and bound fast unde r his arms, which was a Greek mode of doi ng an irretrievable injury to the ghos t of the dead. Nor was the feeling of fear limited to thos e whom they had any reason to dread. On the death of a nursing child the Iroquo is take two pieces of cloth, steep them in the milk of its mother, and place them in the hands of the dead little one so that it may not return in spirit from need of food to haunt and trouble the bereaved parent. They also think that the s leeping infant holds intercour se with the spirit world, and it is a custom for the mother to rub the face of the living child with a pinch of ashes at night to protect it from noc turnal spirits. In Lapland the mothers, when com mitting infanticide, cut out the tongue s of the little one s before casting them away in the forest, lest the poo r innoc ents shoul d be heard crying and calling on them in the night . The Chinook Indi ans declare that the dead wake at night and get up in search of food . The Algonki ns brin g food to the grave for the nour ishm ent of the shade which remains with the body after death. In doi ng this they had an obj ect, which was the ghos t in reality and not a hallucination to be resolved into not hingne ss by any phi losophy of dreams. The Iroquoi s maintained that unl ess these rites of bur ial were performed the spirits woul d return to troubl e their relatives and friends . In one of the cune iform texts it is taught that the Manes which are neglected by their relatives on earth succum b to hunge r and th irst. As it is said, “He whos e body is left forgot ten in the fields, his soul has no rest on earth. He whos e soul no one cares for, the dregs of the cup, the remains of the repast, that which is throw n among the refuse of the street, that is all he has to nour ish him.” (Maspero, Daw n of Civilization, Eng. tr., p. 509 .) The necessity that was felt for providing the dead with food will account for the Buddhi st doc trine of non - immortality for the man who has no children. In this way; the manes needs provi sioni ng. The prope r person to suppl y them is a son, and he who dies without a son to perform the sacrifice may be left like the poor soul s in the Assyrian story who succum b to hunge r and thirst and thus die out altoge ther as neglected starvelings . It is said in the Dattaka - Mimansa, “Heaven aw aits not one who is destitute of a son. ” The Inoits likewise have a custom of giving a new - bor n son the name of som eone who has lately died, in order “that the departed may have rest in the tom b” (Rink, Eskimo Tales ). This i s a mode of adopt ing a son for the service of the dead where the deceased"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"may have had no son to make the offerings . Of all the charitable institutions on the earth’s surface, the most remarkable, surely, is that of the Chinese Taoists called the Yu - Lan - Ui , or “association for feeding the dead,” which collects suppl ies for the sustenance of the needy spirits who have no relations on earth to offer sacrifices to these paupe rs of the other world. In the Egypt ian Book of the Dead the deceased prays that he may take pos session in Amenta of the fune ral meals that were and cont inue to be offered to him by his living friends on earth. “Let me have pos session of my fune ral meals. Let me have pos session of all things which are ritualistically offered for me in the ne ther world. Let me have pos session of the table (of offerings ) which was made for me on 157 earth, the solicitations which were uttered for me that he (I) may feed upon the bread of Seb.” This is the refrain to a kind of litany. (Rit., ch. 68, Renouf .) I n the vigne ttes to the Ritual and other scenes it is not iceable how the female mour ners expos e their breasts and as it were offer their nippl es to the mummy on its way to the dead - hous e (Papyr us of Ani). This agrees with the scene in a fune ral procession o f the Badya s, in which the wom en lean ove r their dead com panions and sque eze their milk into the mout h of the deceased. King Teta in the Pyramid texts exul ts in Amenta that he is not left to suffer from hunge r and thirst as a Manes. He is not like one of t hos e poor starvelings who are forced to eat the excrements and swallow the filth that is, as it were, the sewage of the life on earth. “Hateful to Teta are hunge r and thirst,” and from these he doe s not suffer. He is suppl ied with pur e food and drink in pl enty. (Teta, II, 68 - 9.) Hom er describes the spirits as rushing to lap or breathe the blood pour ed out in sacrifice. When Odys seus entered Hades and the blood was pour ed out, the shades that drank of it revived and spoke . The Zuni Indians of to - day reverenc e certain images or fetishes of the ancestral soul s or spirits, which images they treat as their representatives of the dead. These are dippe d into the blood that is offered in sacrifice. Whilst performing this rite they will say, “My father, this day thou shalt refresh thys elf with blood; with blood shalt thou enlarge thy heart!” The Indi ans of Virginia used to put children to death for a certain class of spirits to suck the blood, as they said, from the left breast. The Mexicans, who woul d sacrifice 50,00 0 hum an beings in one year, held that hum an blood was the onl y efficacious offering, and the pur est was the most acceptable. Hence the sacrifice of infants and virgins. Offering the blood of the innoc ent to save the guilty, or thos e who feared for themselv es, woul d lead to a doc trine of subs titution and vicarious atonement which culminated as Christian in the fright ful formula, “Without blood there is no remission of sin!” Not merely hum an blood this time, but the ichor of a divine being who was made flesh on purpos e to pou r out the blood for the divine venge ance to lap in the person of a gor y ghos t of God. “My father! This day shalt thou refresh thys elf with blood! ” That doc trine is but an awful shadow of the past — the shadow , as it were, of our earth in a f ar - off past that remains to eclipse the light of heaven in the present and darkens the soul s of men to - day through this survival of savage spiritualism direfully perverted. The blood first offered as life for the dead was not given for the remission of sin . The Peruvi ans spread the fune ral feast, “expe cting the soul of the deceased” to com e and eat and drink. The Bhils, among the hill tribes of Indi a, offer “provi sion for the spirit.” The North American Indians paid annua l visits to the place of"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"the dead, and made a feast to feed the spirits of the departed. The Amazulu prepare the fune ral meal and say, “There then is you r food , all ye spirits of our tribe; sum mon one anot her. I am not goi ng to say, ‘So - and - so, there is your food, ’ for you are jealous . But thou, So - and - so, who art making this man ill, call the spirits: com e all of you to eat this food. ” (Callaway, Amazulu, 175. ) There were econom ical reasons against carrying the worship back too far when worship cons isted mainly in 158 making offerings . A Yao will excuse himself from giving even to his ow n grandfather. He gives to his father, and says, “O father! I do not know all you r relatives. You know them all: invi te them to feast with you. ” (Duff Macdona ld, Africana, vol . I, p. 68.) Thus he makes his offering onc e for all, and saves expe nses. The fune ral custom is almost uni versal for the mortuary meal to be made to feed the spirits of the departed, and com muni on with the ancestral spirits was an obj ect of the totemic Eucharist. The sacrifices offered to the dead, the burial rites and fune rary ceremoni es, generally imply the existence of a living cons cious ness to which the piteous appe al was made. The fact becom es visible in the mysteries of Amenta. And one of the greatest acts of sacrifice for the dea d is show n in the fune ral feast. In their fune ral ceremoni es the Yucatanese fasted for the sake of the dead. Now fasting for the sake of the dead in the most primitive sense was goi ng without food that it might be given to the ghos ts or spirit ancestors. T he living fasted that the Manes might be fed. And herein lies the true rational e of the fune ral fast. This was no doubt the motive for the Haker - festival of the Egypt ians, when the provi sions were laid upon the altar as an offering to Osiris in his coffin. The word Haker denot es bot h a festival and a fast; it also signi fies starving, and starving with the view of giving the food thus saved to the spirits of the dead woul d be a really religious sacrifice. This festival that was celebrated by starving or fast ing on behalf of the dead com es to its culmination in the season of Lent as a fast of forty days. In this originally the food of the living woul d be given as a sacrificial offering to the dead, or the ancestral spirits, or to the god who gave his life in f ood for men and animals. Here the Egypt ian Lent or season of fasting for forty days is in the true pos ition, as it follow ed and did not precede the death of Osiris. To have any real meaning, the fast which was ordained as a sacrifice of food for the dead w as naturally celebrated after and not before the death, to cons titute a fune ral offering and “to make that spirit live.” Going without the food and giving it as a sacrificial offering to the dead assuredly affords the prope r expl anation of the fune ral fest ival that was celebrated as a solemn fast which finally passed into the Christian Eucharist. The offering of blood to the dead is expl ained on the ground that the blood is the life; and the more blood shed, the more the life offered, the more precious the sacrifice. Further, the Tahitians thought the gods fed on the spirits of the dead, and therefore freque nt sacrifices of hum an beings were made to suppl y them with spiritual diet. Blood , the liqui d of life, was drink; spirit, the breath of life, was food . T his shoul d be com pared with the Egypt ian legend of Unas, who is fed on the spirits of gods . Also with the account of Horus - Sahu, the wild hunt er, of whom it is said that he ate the great gods for his breakfast, the lesser one s for his dinne r at noon , and t he small one s for his evening meal. The doc trine is identical with that of the Tahitians. Prayers for the dead are cont inue d when the offerings of food have ceased. The fasting survives when"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"the practice has becom e a meaningl ess farce. The obl ation of bloo d is still a religious rite. For flagellation that causes the blood to flow is closely akin to the self - gashings , lacerations , amput ations , and immo - 159 lations of primitive mourners who made their persona l sacrifice in this way at the grave. Also blood and spirit as an offering to the dead are still represented by the sacramental wine and bread. Here it may be remarked that when mode rn ritualists swing their censers heavenw ards and fill the church with clouds of incense, the rite, so far as it has any funda mental signi ficance, is an act in the worship of the ancestral spirits. Breath, like blood, is an element of life, and this was represented by the smoke of the fire - offering and by fragrance - breathing incense in the primitive ritual of Inne r Africa, t hat was cont inue d in ancient Egypt and afterwards in Rom e. A breath of life is offered in the ascendi ng fum es to give the spirits life, because the breath was onc e cons idered to be the soul of life. This was one of the elemental soul s. Incense, truly typi c al and prope rly com pounde d in the Christian ritual, ought to include the seven elements in one soul of breathing life as an offering to the spirits of the dead, because the elemental soul s were seven in num ber, and because the seven soul s cont ribut ed to th e making of the one eternal spirit. It has been said that savages believe their weapons to have soul s in com mon with themselves, and therefore when they bur y their dead they not only bur y their weapons , they also break them, to set free the soul s of the we apons to accom pany the spirits of the warriors. The suppos ed reason is pur ely gratuitous and ignor antly Europe an. The interpreters know not hing of the ancient Sign - langua ge as it was enacted in such typi cal custom s as these. The breaking of the weapons or other things when offered to the dead is done as a sign of sacrifice. The obj ect of the offering is sacrifice, and no sacrifice coul d be too great, no prope rty too precious , as an offering to the spirits of the dead. When Mtesa, King of Uganda , died, over £10, 000 worth of cloth was bur ied with him as a sacrificial offering (Lione l Décle, Three Years in Sav age Africa, p. 446 , not e). Herbert Spencer coul d find no origin for the idea of an after - life save the conc lusion which the savage draws from the not ion sugge sted by dreams (Spencer, Facts and Com ments, p. 210 ). But whatsoever dreams the savage had, they woul d becom e familiar in the cour se of time. He woul d learn that dreams had no pow er to externalize themselves in appa ritions , had there been no ghos ts or doubl es of the dead. He woul d also learn readily enough , and the lesson woul d be perpetually repeated, that how soever great his success when hunt ing in his dreams of the night, there was no game caught when he woke next morning. Clearly no reliance coul d be placed on dreams for establishing the ghos t, any more than on the result of other dreams. Moreove r, the same savage that is assum ed to have panne d out on dreams for a false belief also repor ts that he sees the spirits of the dead by abnor mal vision and has the means of com muni cating with them. But all the credul ity of all the savages that ever existed cannot com pete or be com pared with the credul ity invol ved in this belief or assum ption that the ghos t itself, toge ther with the custom s, the ceremoni es, th e religious rites of evoc ation and propi tiation, the priceless offerings , the count less testimoni es to the veritability of abno rmal vision, the"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"uni versal practices for induc ing that vision for the pur pos e of com muni cating with spiritual intelligences, had no other than a 160 subj ective basis, and a false belief that the dream - shadow was the sole reality. Now , can one conc eive anyt hing more fatal to the claims made on behalf of evol ution as a mode of nature’s teaching than this assum ption that man has uni v ersally been the victim of an illusion derived from a baseless delusion? If primitive men were the victims of a delusion which has been cont inue d for thous ands of years in defiance of all expe rience and obs ervation, what gui dance or trust coul d there be in evol ution; or how are we to distingui sh between the false produc t and the true if man dreamed the ghos t into being when there was no ghos t, if he has been so far the victim of his ow n Franke nstein as to found the whol e body of his religious beliefs and cu stom s on that which never existed? Primitive man was not a hundr edth part so likely to be the victim of hallucination or diseased subj ectivity as the mode rn. External Nature is not hallucinative; it is the scene of cont inuous educ ation in primal or rudi men tary and cons tantly recurring realities. His elemental spirits or forces were real, and not the result of hallucination; why not his ancestral spirits? Primitive or archaic man was not metaphys ician enough to play the fool with facts in this way, to say no thing of his manuf acturing facts from the pha ntasies and vanishing stom achic vapour s from which dreams are cont inua lly made. A dreamer by night who became the conde nser of his dreams by day, and then manuf actured the ghos t that no one ever saw or handl ed o r heard or “smelt out ,” which ghos t had no existence in verifiable reality, and yet had the pow er to haunt manki nd inside of them for ever after! The abor igines kne w better, whereas the agnos tics do not know . It is not the peopl e that see visions who are the visiona ries. The true visiona ries are the subj ective - minde d metaphys icians, who do not know a dream of the night from a vision of the day, and who can most easily blend the obj ect and subj ect in one . The Kurnai distingui sh betwixt the imagery of dreams and the spirits seen by ope n vision. They say that whereas anyone may be able to com muni cate with “ghos ts” dur ing sleep, it is onl y the spirit medium s or wizards who can do so in waking hour s. (How itt.) A priest of the Fijian god Ndenge i, describing his p assing into the state of trance, said, “My ow n mind departs from me, and then, when it is truly gone , my god speaks through me” (Williams, Fiji, p. 228) . Unless a profound fanatic, a mode rn medium woul d not call the spirit that cont rolled him God, but the spirit of a person that had onc e been hum an and now was one of the ancestral spirits. There is nothing in all nature but the fact that will adequa tely account for the uni versal fear of the ghost. It is the fact alone that gives any rationa l expl anation of the inarticulate faith. When onc e we adm it the fact as ope rative reality the costly custom s, the libations of life, the mysteries of belief, the propi tiations of fear and proofs of affection, are all dul y motived or amply expl icated. Mode rn science has let loos e a deluge of destruction that is fatal to the ignor ant beliefs and the false faiths derived from misinterpreted mythol ogy , but it will not efface one singl e fact nor upr oot a singl e reality in nature. Gods and godde sses may defeature and dislimn, to pass away as fading pha ntom s of the nature pow ers, but the human ghos t remains, and remains to - day as ever, or more than ever, to the civilized as well as to the savage. "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"161 And if, as we maintain, these phe nom ena are a part of nature’s reality, the meth ods of science onc e appl ied to them can but verify the fact and establish its veridical character. There is no pos sible way of know ing the truth except by interroga tion of the phe nom ena themselves, not merely in the phys ical dom ain, but also in the region of intelligence, where you meet with an ope rator who has to be taken into partnership. The spiritualistic phe nom ena also conf ute the assertion of Spinoz a to the effect that persona lity has no foot hol d in the world out side our selves, for these intelligences whom we call “spirits” are persons . They appe ar in the visible, audi ble, tangi ble, and palpable forms of persona lity. Not onl y as the persons who are called “the dead,” but also as pha ntom s of the living, eid ō l ons , recogni zable feature by feature, of indi vidua ls who were not yet dead. The ghos t of the living as a visible reality has been seen out of the body in this life, as Goethe saw his other self, which tends to doub le the evidence for the existence of the ghos t of the dead. The Engl ish Society for Psy chical Research has collected ove r a thous and cases of the pha ntasms of the living. The “science of religion” with the ghos t left out is altoge ther meaningl ess. The ghos t offers the one uni que obj ective proof of spiritual existence, and the doings and say ings of the ghos t, whether it be appa rent or concealed, still furnish the data of mode rn as of ancient spiritualism. Religion prope r com mences with and must include the idea of or desire for anot her life. And the warrant for this is the ghos t and the facu lties of abnor mal seership. It has been urged by som e writers that religion began with the worship of death and the apot heosis of the corpse. But ancestor worship in all lands was a worship of the ancestral spirits, not a cultus of the corpse. The spirits were the ancestors; the ancestors were spirits. The awe excited by the dead is caused by the active ghos t of the dead, not by the motionl ess corpse. The sacrifices offered to the dead are made to propi tiate the living ghos t of the dead, not the corpse. It was the fact that the ghos t might return and did return and make itself appa rent, with the pow er to manifest displeasure or revenge , that made the revenant so fearsom e in the early stages of “ghost worship.” Dread of the ghos t and the desire to placate so unc anny a visitant will account for propi tiation of the ghos ts. The truth is that the Christian is the one and only religion in the world that was based upon the corpse instead of the resurrection in spirit. In no other religion is cont inui ty in spirit ma de depende nt on the resurrection of the earthly body. The Christians mistook the risen mum my in Amenta for the corpse that was bur ied on earth, whereas the Egypt ian religion was founde d on the rising again of the spirit from the corpse as it was imaged in the resurrection of Amsu - Horus transforming from the mum my - Osiris, and by the hum an soul emerging alive from the body of dead matter. There is no instance recorded in all the expe riences of spiritualists ancient or mode rn of the corpse com ing back from the tom b. And this religion founde d on the risen corpse is naturally losing all hol d of the world. It has failed because immortality or the cont inui ty of persona lity coul d not be based upon a reappe aring corpse. The so - called worship of ancestors 162 "},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"depend ed entirely on the ancestors being cons idering living, cons cious , acting and recipient spirits, and not as corpses moul dering in the earth. This furnished the sole raison - d’être for all the sacrificial offerings , the life, the blood , the food , the choi cest and costliest things that coul d be given to the dead. Those whom we call “the dead” were to them the veritable living in supe rhum an forms pos sessing supe rhum an pow ers. The Egypt ian Amenta is the land of the ever - living. Sacrifices to the dead were not sen selessly offered to the senseless corpse, but to the spirit persona ge that was its late inha bitant, still alive, and suppos ed to be needing material nour ishm ent from the well - know n elements of life. In an Australian fune ral ceremony it was custom ary for th e relatives of the deceased to cut themselves unt il the corpse and bur ial place were cove red with their blood. This was done , they said, to give the dead man strengt h and enable him to rise in anot her count ry. (Brough Smyth, vol . II, p. 274 .) By which they meant a survival of the living spirit, not a resurrection of the bur ied body . The corpse is not , and coul d not be, the starting poi nt of worship when the sacrifice was eaten qui veringl y alive, with the flesh warm and the blood welling forth from every wou nd. That is when there was no corpse, and neither was there any death. The life was taken and conve rted into other life, the life of the children, tribe, or clan, and was cont inue d on that line. It was also cont inue d on anot her line in the spirit life. Aga in we say there was no death in our mode rn acceptation of the term. The bur ial custom s, rites, and ceremoni es one and all, from the remotest times, were foun ded in the faith that the departed still lived on in spirit. In the earliest mode of interment know n the dead were bur ied for rebirth. The corpse was bound up in the fœtal likeness of the embryo in utero, and placed in the earth as in the mother’s wom b, the type being cont inue d in the wom b - shaped bur ial vase of the pot ters. This, how ever, did not denot e a resurrection of the body, but was sym bol ical of rebirth in spirit. Not onl y were the dead elabor ately prepared for the spiritual rebirth; many sym bol s of reproduc tion and emblems of the resurrection were likewise bur ied in the tom b as amulets and fetish figures of protecting pow er. The corpse and spirit are distingui shed in the resurrection scenes of the Egypt ian Ritual by the black shade laid out upon the ground and the ka - image of cont inue d life. The corpse and spirit are show n toge ther as the twofold entity when the Chinese, amongs t others, kindl e candl es round the coffin, “to give light to the spirit which remains with the corpse” (Dool ittle, Soc ial Life of the Chinese, p. 126) . One Egypt ian picture show s the ba - soul nestling to the body on the fune ra l couc h in an attitude of the tende rest solicitude , with its hands placed ove r the non - beating heart of the mum my (Maspero, pp. 198 - 199). The Australian Kurnai likewise hol d that the ghos t of the deceased com es back to take a look at its mortal remains. A native speaking of this to How itt said, “Som etimes the Murup com es back and looks dow n into the grave, and it may say, “Hallo, there is my old ’pos sum rug, there are my old bone s.” (How itt, On som e Australian Beliefs. ) The Fijians practise one of the naïve st custom s for preventing a deceased wom an from manifesting as an appa rition. In life her onl y garment was the liku or waist - 163 fringe which she wore as a cove r for her nakedne ss. In death the little apron is purpos ely left upon her body with the strin gs unt ied, so that if the poo r thing shoul d rise up with a desire to return, her onl y bit of clothing will fall from her, and she will be forced, from"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"delicacy of feeling, to crouc h dow n again in shame and conf usion, and thus be una ble to show herself to t he living. (Fison, Notes on Fijian Burial Custom s. ) Now it was know n that no Fijian corpse had ever risen and returned from the tom b. It was also know n that the cons cious ness thus appe aled to was not that of the corpse. This therefore was an appe al in Sig n - langu age pathetically made to the Manes or spirit of the departed not to com e back and troubl e the living. When the bodi es of the dead (or living) were bur ied at the base of a bui lding, it was not for any service that coul d be rende red by the rotting bod y, but for the spirit to becom e a protecting pow er. In Siam when a new city gate was erected the first four or eight peopl e passing were seized and bur ied beneath it as “gua rdian ange ls.” Unde r the gates of Manda lay hum an victims were bur ied alive to furni sh “spirit watchers.” Everyw here the spirit or ghos t, not the corpse, is the obj ect of religious regard. And as no corpse was ever know n by any race of peopl e to return from the grave, the practices that were intended to prevent the dead from com ing back w ere not aimed at the corpse, to whom they did not appl y, but to the alleged living cons cious ness of the spirit that was represented by the doubl e. Hence the custom of eating or of bur ying the victim whilst alive. Brough Smyth describes a Birraark or mediu m as lying on his stom ach beside the dead body whilst speaking to the sprit of the deceased, receiving and repor ting the messages given to him by the dead man ( Abor igines of Australia, vol. I, 107) . The Birraark of the Kurnai were declared to be initiated into their mysteries by the spirits or mrarts whom they met in the bus h, and it was from the spirits of the dead they obt ained their replies when they were cons ulted by members of the tribe ( ibid., p. 254 ). Spirits of the dead appe ar to the living and addr ess them in their ow n langua ge, as when the Eskimo mother com es back to her boy by day to cheer him and says, “Be not afraid; I am thy mother, and love thee still” (Crantz, vol. I, 209 ). The Manda n Indi ans arrange the skul ls of their dead in a circle. The widow s know the skul ls of their former hus bands , and the mothers know the skul ls of their children. The skul ls so placed form the spirit - circle in which the wom en sit for intercour se with the soul s of the departed. “There is scarcely an hour in a pleasant day but more or less of these wom en may be seen sitting or lying by the skul l of their child or hus band, talking to it in the most pleasant and ende aring langua ge that they can use (as they were wont to do in former days), and seemingl y getting an answer b ack” (Catlin, N. A. Indians , vol . I, p. 90) . John Tanne r bears witness to the reality of these phe nom ena amongs t the Indi an Medamen. He was himself induc ted into the state of abnor mal seership, and saw a spirit in the shape of a young man, who said to him, “I look dow n upon you at all times, and it is not necessary you shoul d call me with such loud cries.” ( Narration, p. 189 , New York, 1830 .) The Marian Islande rs held that the spirits of the dead returned to talk with them. 164 The dead bodi es of their an cestors were desiccated and kept in their hut s for the pur pos e of spirit - com munion, and oracles were suppos ed to be given from their skul ls. This tends to identify at least one motive for making and preserving the mum my. A custom of the Acagchemen Indi ans is peculiarly enlight ening in relation to totemic spiritualism. At seven years of age the children are, or used to be, throw n into a trance by the medicine - men in order that they might learn from their spirit gui des which of the zoot ype s, beast,"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"bird, rept ile, or what not , was to be adopt ed for the child’s ow n persona l totem. This, according to the present reading of the data, was a mode of identifying the particular pow er represented by the totemic zoot ype , and a means of affiliating the child, now becom e an indi vidua l, to the pow er (the later god) for the protection thus sought , and this pow er was figur ed and visualized by the totemic zoot ype . Thus the persona l totem which was seen by the child in trance was a prototype of the spiritual suppor t extende d to the novi ce by a protector in the spirit world. So when the Inoi t nov ice had prepared his body to becom e the temple of som e spirit, he woul d call upon the genius (or ka) to take up its abode with him. The spirit invoke d sends som e totemic animal, an otter or badge r or other zoot ype , for him to kill and flay and clothe himself with the skin. By this means he is suppos ed to obt ain the pow er of runni ng wild or of making his transformation into the animal that images the supe rhum an pow er. The tongue of the beas t is then cut out and worn as the medicine, the fetish, charm, or gree - gree of the initiate. This again, to all appe arance, is equi valent to the Child - Horus becoming the Word. We now turn to the chief hum an agent in the produ ction of abno rmal phe nom ena, n amely, the spiritual medium . As usual, we make use of the Egypt ian wisdom for gui dance in the past. A hum an soul had been discreted and discriminated from the animistic and totemic soul s and persona lized in Horus as the Child of the Blood - Mother. This was Horus in the flesh, or in matter. A divine soul was then imaged as the Horus who had died and risen again in spirit from the dead. The pow ers previous ly extant had been uni ted and cont inue d as “the Seven Soul s of Ra.” We read of these in the Ritual, where they are the seven elemental pow ers that were divinized as the “Ancestors of Ra,” thos e who preceded him in time, but are now “in his follow ing. ” (Rit., ch. 178 , 22, 34, 180, 36.) Ra is the self - originated invi sible and eternal being, the father in spirit who is not to be appr ehende d save through the medium ship of Horus the son; that is, Horus in spirit who bears witness for the father in his resurrection from the dead by testifying to the hidde n sour ce of an eternal life, the Horus who says in the Ritual, ch. 42, “I am the Everlasting One: Witness of Eternity is my name.” In him the hum an Horus divinized in death became the spirit medium of the father - god. Ra the Holy Spirit was now the sour ce of a divine descent for human soul s, who were conseque ntly highe r in status than the earlier gods that were but elemental pow ers, and highe r than the mother - soul which had been incarnated in the hum an Horus. These were ever - living soul s, and bor n immortals, who were looke d upon in many lands as divine beings manifestin g in the hum an form. A spirit that lived for ever was now the supr eme 165 type of the hum an soul . The king who never dies, that is, the divine persona ge in hum an form, now took the place of the turtle that never died, or the Bull of Eternity, or any othe r totemic type of the elemental and pre - hum an soul . The king who never dies impersona tes the immortal in man, who was the roya l Horus in the Kamite eschatology. “The king is dead, long live the king!” is an ancient doc trine of hum an Horus dyi ng to rise aga in as roya l Horus the ever - living, who was the typi cal demons trator of a life eternal as Horus the bor n immortal. The king who ever lives is a human figur e of the immortal bor n from the dead. Egypt ian kings were not directly deified. The hum an Ra was an im age of the divine Ra, a likeness of the supe rhum an pow er. In various texts the Pharaoh is called the"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"ka of the god, the image and likeness, and to that the worship was indubi tably directed. It was as the living representative of divinity that the Ra or Pha raoh was ador ed by the Egypt ians. In this character the king himself is portrayed in the act of worshippi ng his ow n ka, or divine eid ō l on — the god imaged within and by himself. In bot h cases the worship was no mere flattery of the mortal man; it was meant f or the ever - living immortal. The Pharaoh was the representative of Ra on earth. So was it in Africa and beyond. The Master of Whidda h said of himself, “I am the equa l of God; such as you behol d me, I am his com plete por trait” (Allen and Thom pson’ s Narrativ e, vol . I, 228) . This as Egypt ian would be the ka - image of the god . The person who, as reckone d, now inhe rited a soul that was thought to be immortal verily shared in a nature that was supe rior to any of the elemental forces, such as those of wind and eart h and water, even the sun, or the blood of Isis, the highe st of them all; and ove r these the spirit - born, or second - bor n, assum ed the mastery or claimed supr emacy. They themselves were of spiritual origin, and as spirits they were supe rhum an on a highe r pl ane than any merely animistic pow ers, who, like the Polyne sian Tuikilakila Chief of Som osom o, also claimed to be a god . Mendi eta in his repor t of the Mexican gods tells us: “Others said that onl y such men had been taken for gods who trans formed themselves or (who) appe ared in som e other shape and did or spake som ething while in that shape beyond (the ordinary) hum an pow er” (Mendi eta, Historia Ecclest. Indi ana, 1870 , p. 84) . The Mexicans were here speaking of their trance - medium s. They entered the state of t rance for their transformation, and in that condi tion manifested superhum an or spiritual pow ers that were looke d upon as divine. Amongs t all races of peopl e such men were divinized unde r whatsoever name, as medium s, mediators, and links betwixt two worlds. In this pha se the transformers were thos e who entered the state of trance. This asserted supe riority ove r the pow ers of the elements is one cause of the claims made by or accredited to the divine medium s, prepos terous enough at times, with regard to their supe rhum an cont rol of the elements as rain - makers and rulers of the weather. The supe rnor mal faculty of the seer and sorcerer is the sole root of reality from which the fiction springs . The Mexican kings , on assum ing the sove reignt y, were sworn to make th e sun shine, the clouds to give forth rain, the rivers to flow , and the earth to produc e abunda ntly (Bancroft, vol . II, 146) . The Inoi t Ange kok has to 166 play the part of “great provi der” to the peopl e, as master of the elements on which plenty of food depends , the water for fish and the air for returning birds of passage. Such medium s were a sort of titular, not actual, masters ove r the elemental pow ers, as a result of their asserted highe r origin. A line of priest - kings founde d on this basis of divinit y was at one time extant in the island of Niué, in the Sout h Pacific. Being the representative of deity, the mona rch was made respons ible for the grow th of food, and in times of dearth he was put to death because of a failure in the crops. So exigent were the peopl e that at last no one woul d cons ent to becom e king, and so the mona rchy expi red. (Turner, Sam oa. ) The immortal in man being more immediately demons trated by spiritual manifestation and the abnor mal phe nom ena of trance and interior vision, the med ium s were the first divine persons who demons trated the facts of spirit existence and spirit"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"intercour se. And such were the earliest born immortals. They had the witness within. But thos e who were not mediums had to attain assurance as best they coul d; the y had to make use of the others. Paul speaks of not being certain of his ow n immortality. But he presses on to see if by any means he may attain to the resurrection from the dead. This led to a doc trine of condi tiona l immortality that was uni versal, and to a theory of the medium s or mediators being divine persona ges or bor n immortals, like the second Horus, who was the first fruits of them that previous ly slept. The earliest gui dance then was spiritual on this ground. The aboriginal priest - king or divine pe rson was looke d to as a ruler and leader in this world on account of his abnor mal relations hip to the other. He was the demons trator of a soul that was the first cons idered to be ever - living. This divine descent was based upon the derivation from the god i n spirit who was now supe rior to all other gods , and who in the Egypt ian religion is Ra the Holy Spirit. The three highe st ranks in Egypt were the divine, the roya l, and the nob le, and the three were distingui shed from each other by their peculiar type of beard. Thus the loftiest rank was spiritual, and this primacy originated not in men becom ing bishops , but in their pos sessing thos e spiritual pow ers and faculties which have been repudi ated and expur gated by the Chur ches of orthodox Christianity, but which were looke d upon of old as verily divine. We also learn from Syne sius’s Logos Aigupt ios, quot ed by Heeren (Ideen, vol . II, Egypt , p. 335 ), that in electing a mona rch, whereas the vot e of a soldier was reckone d as one , the vot e of a prophe t or seer was cou nted as one hundr ed. The Egypt ian priesthood pre - eminently exemplifies the idea that the incarnating pow er made use of certain persons as sacred agents, male or female, for such a pur pos e. Hence the highe r order of priests were know n as fathers in god. The y were suppos ed to share in the divine nature, with pow er to com muni cate the hol y spirit to others who desired to partake of its benefits. The insufflation of the Holy Spirit with the laying on of hands by mode rn religious impos tors who do but parody the a ncient custom without kno wledge is a relic of the sacred rite. The spiritualistic medium was originally revered not because he was a priest or king, not on account of his earthly office, but because of his being an intercessor with the supe rhum an pow ers on behalf of mortals. Among the Zulu Kaffirs the 167 mere pol itical chief has been know n to steal the medicines and fetish charms, the information and the magical vessel of the diviner and seer, on pur pos e to confer the sacred author ity on himself and then to put the spiritual ruler to death and take his place, which is similar to the method of the Christians in getting rid of the pagans and stealing the appur tenances of their religion, and ruling without their “ope n vision. ” Among the Hottentots the “great est and most respected old men of the clan” are the seers and prophe siers, or the medium s of spirit intercour se. Their practical religion, says Dr. Hahn, cons ists of a “firm belief in sorcery and the arts of the living medicine - man on the one hand, and on the other belief in and adoration of the pow ers of the dead” (Hahn, Tsuni Goam , p. 24) . That is the religion of all ancient spiritualism distingui shed from animism, and it is uni versal amongs t the abor iginal races. The spirits of the dead are accepted as o perative realities. They are dreaded or ador ed according to the mental status of the spiritualists, and the sorcerers, magi, the medicine - men, the witches, and witch doc tors are the spirit medium s employe d as the accepted and established means of"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"com muni ca tion. Also witches, wizards, sorcerers, shamans, and other abnor mals who had the pow er of goi ng out of the body in this life were feared all the more after death by many tribes because they had demons trated the facts which caused such fear and terror; they had also been their exor cists and layers of the ghos t whos e protective influence was now lost to the living. One way of denot ing that such beings were heavenly or of divine descent was signi fied by the custom of not allow ing them to touc h the ground with their feet. This was not an unc om mon kind of tabu appl ied to the divine persona ge as representative of the god . It was a mode of show ing that he was not of the earth earthy, and therefore he was heavenly, or som ething betwixt the earth and heaven, like Hor us, who was “the conne cting link” in spirit (Rit., ch. 42). It was because he was reckone d of divine descent that the king or other form of the ruler was not allow ed to show the ordinary signs of age, decay, and decrepitude , nor to die a natural death like any mere mortal, but was put to death in his prime whilst robust and vigor ous , and, as the saying is, “full of spirit.” The Japanese Mikado was carried on men’s shoul ders because it was detrimental to his divinity for him to go afoot . One account of him s ays, “It was cons idered as a shameful degradation for him even to touc h the ground with his foot ” (Pinke rton’ s Voyage s and Travels, vol . VII, p. 613 ). These were the divine kings , like the Egypt ian Ank, the everlasting one s, the born immortals among men. T his mode of doi ng honour and conf erring digni ty has its survivals in the custom of “chairing” or carrying the hero of the hour on the shoul ders of thos e whos e desire is to elevate him beyond a foot ing of equa lity with themselves on com mon ground; also in t he practice of taking the horses out of the hero’s carriage, when hum an beings take the place and pos ition of the beasts. It may be that there were other reasons than the one assigne d upon a previous page for the crucial seclusion of the girls at the peri od of pube rty. It is proba ble that they were at the same time initiated in the mysteries of medium ship. Seeing that it was a practice for pube scent lads to be initiated into the mysteries of seership and made medium s 168 of at the time they were made int o men, it is more than proba ble that the girls were also induc ted into the mysteries of trance at the time of their pube scent transformation. This woul d expl ain the extreme lengt h of time dur ing which the girls were often seclude d from all eyes save thos e of their female ove rseers. We hear of the boys being kept in their isolation and practised upon unt il they did see. Why not the girls? Clairvoya nce was “the vision and the faculty divine,” the “beatific vision” of all the early races. It was sought for and cultivated, prized and protected, as the most precious of all hum an gifts, and the pos sessor was held to be divine. The girls who were seclude d for the serpent’s visit woul d, as spirit medium s, becom e the oracles of the serpent wisdom , and as medium s they woul d attain to primitive divinity. Moreove r, when the typi cal serpent visits the Basuto virgin her limbs are plastered ove r with white clay and her face is cove red by a mask. This denot es her transformation into a supe rior being of a spiritual order, whi ch she woul d becom e as a spirit medium. This sugge stion finds suppor t from a story that is told by the Kirgis of Siberia. The daught er of a kha n was kept shut up in a dark iron hous e so that no man might look upon her. She was attende d by an old wom an. Whe n the girl attained her maidenhood she said to the old woman, “Where do you go so often?”"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"“My child,” said the old wom an, “there is a bright world. In that bright world your father and mother live, and all sorts of peopl e dw ell; that is where I go.” Obvi ou sly this other world was entered in the state of trance as well as at the time of death. The maiden said, “Good mother, I will tell nobody, but show me that bright world.” So the old wom an took the girl out of the dark iron hous e. But when the girl saw the bright world she fainted and fell. And the eye of God fell on her and she conc eived. This was evidently in the hypnot ic swoon that was induc ed by the aged wom an, who thus initiated the maiden into the mysteries of medium ship at the period of her pube rty. (Radloff, W., cited in The Golden Bough, vol. II, p. 237 .) According to Mansfield Parkyns , the greater num ber of the medium s or pos sessed persons among the Abys sinians were wom en. It is the same to - day in mode rn spiritual phe nom ena. Also in ancient Egypt the wom an was held to be the supe rior medium as seer and diviner. Duff Macdona ld (vol . I, p. 61) says of the Yao peopl e: “Their craving for clearer manifestations of the deity is satisfied through the prophe tess. She may be the principle wife of the chief. In som e cases a wom an without a hus band will be set apart for the god (or spirit). The god comes to her with his com mands at night. She delivers the message in a kind of ecstasy. She speaks (as her name implies) with the utterance of a person raving with excitement. During the night of the com muni cation her ravings are heard resoundi ng all ove r the village.” It was as a medium for spirit com muni cation that the witch or wise wom an attained her preeminence in the past and her evil character in the present. W itchcraft is but the craft of wisdom ; witches were the wise in a primitive sense and in ways cons idered to be magical for assigna ble reasons . But witchcraft and wizardry, magic and “miracle,” woul d be meaningl ess apart from primitive spiritualism. The witc h as abnor mal seer and revealer was the most ancient form of the mother’s wisdom . The 169 spirit medium was the nearest appr oach to a hum an divinity. He or she was the bor n immortal who demons trated the existence in this life of a soul or spirit beyond o r out side of the body for a life hereafter. And as he or she was the demons trator of that soul , they were the first to be accredited with the pos session of such a soul , and this pos session cons tituted him or her as born immortal. The Tong ans hol d that it i s not everyone who pos sesses a spiritual part capable of living a separate existence in Bolutu, the Tonga n Amenta. Only the Egi or chiefs are credited with the pos session of endur ing soul s in the life on earth. The status of these soul s of the nob les is we ll show n when it is said they cannot return to earth in the old totemic gui se of lizards, water - snakes, or porpoi ses. Not these, but the ghos t, or doubl e, is the one witness for the ever - living soul s. (Mariner, Tonga Islands , vol . II, pp. 99 - 105 .) The Fiji ans, amongs t others, declare that onl y the select few have soul s which are inhe rently immortal. Thus , when the ordinary Egypt ian entered Amenta he, like Paul, was by no means certain of his endur ing soul . This had to be attained, and his pilgrimage and pro gress to that end are portrayed in the drama of the Ritual, as will be hereafter show n. It is qui te com mon for the old dark races to be despised and badly treated by the more mode rn as the peopl e who have no soul s. They are not looke d upon as hum an beings , but are denounc ed as wild beasts, reptiles, monke ys, dog - men, men with tails, and it is here expl ained how it was they had no soul s."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"They were the preliminary peopl e, who onl y had totemic soul s which were bor n of the elements and onl y represented the elem ental or pre - hum an soul . An arresting instance is mentione d by How itt in which a group of the Australian abor igines ceased to use their ow n totemic name and called their children after a celebrated seer or medium . In doi ng this they were affiliating the fa therless one s to a highe r type than that of the old totemic elemental soul . This was the soul whos e origin was held to be divine, as demons trated by the supr anor mal faculties of the Birraark or spirit medium . The Incas of Peru were a supe rior race, who had soul s, whereas the abor igines were looke d dow n upon as the peopl e without soul s. The Incas, on account of this supe rior soul , were also born immortals or the ever - living one s, whos e name of the Inca agrees with that of the Egypt ian Ank, the king, or the A nkh, as the ever - living. Such persons did not originate in kings and emperors or as earthly rulers merely mortal. Unde r whatsoever persona l title or type , the divine or semi - divine character was primarily derived from intercour se with spirits or the gods , and the cons eque nt extension of hum an faculty in the abnor mal pha se of medium ship. The peopl e of East Central Africa, says Santos (1586) , “regard their king as the favour ite of the soul s of the dead, and think that he learns from them all that passes in hi s dom inions . This identifies the king in this case with the spiritual medium , and poi nts to the origin of the priest - king in the same character. The Fitaure of the Senegambian Sereres, who is the chief and priest in one , is a spiritual medium , with pow er o ver the soul s of the living and the spirits of the dead. “Every West African tribe,” says Miss Kings ley, “has a secret society — two, in fact, one for men, one for wom en. Every free man has to pass through the secret society of his tribe. If during 170 thi s educ ation the elders of the society discove r that a boy is what is called in Calabar an ebum tup (a medium ), a person who can see spirits, they advi se that he shoul d be brough t up to the medical profession. ” (Kings ley, W. A. S., p. 214 .) In Kimbunda the S ova or chief is the religious centre of his tribe. He is their wise man, their seer, their supr eme man of abnor mal pow ers. The religion, according to Magya r, cons ists in making sacrifices to the ghos ts of their ancestors, the richest offerings being made t o the Sova . The faculty of seeing and foreseeing formed the basis of their pow er ove r the com mon peopl e. The mchisango or witch - doc tor of the Yao and other Central African tribes, who is called by Stanley the “gour d - and - pebbl e man,” is the person sought by the peopl e in all their profounde st perplexities. The man of mental medicine still keeps his place and hol ds his ow n against the doc tors who deal in physics ( Africana, vol . I, p. 43) . He invoke s his spirits by means of a rattle made of a dried gour d with small pebbl es inside it. “Som e of these diviners,” says the Rev. Duff Macdona ld, “are the most intelligent men in the count ry.” The same account is given by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen of the Arunt a spirit medium s and medicine - men in Central Australia. The divine man was the diviner, the seer, the sorcerer, the spirit medium with all the early races. In the Marque san and the Sout h Sea Islands the divine man was supr eme, whether he was a priest, a king, or onl y a person of inferior birth and station. If he h ad the supe rnor mal faculty, the mana, he was the hum an representative of divinity on that account . “Among the Solom on Islande rs,” says Mr. Codr ingt on ( J. Anth. Inst., X, 3), “there is not hing to prevent any man becom ing a chief, if he can show that he is i n"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"pos session of the mana — that is, the abnor mal, medium istic, or supe rnor mal pow er.” The Egypt ian magical pow er will expl ain the mana of the Melanesians, described by Dr. Codr ingt on as a pow er derived from all the pow ers of nature that were recogni zed. They are not in the mental pos ition of thinki ng they can derive their mana directly from a god that is pos tulated as the one spiritual sour ce of pow er. The pow ers recogni zed in nature are various , and were recogni zed because they were supe rhum an though not sup ernatural. Hence their influence was solicitous ly sought to augm ent the hum an. The uns een pow ers were ope rant in nature from the first as elemental forces which man woul d like to wield if he onl y kne w the way to gain alliance with them and to share the pow er. “The mana,” says Dr. Codr ingt on, “can exist in almost anyt hing. Disembodi ed soul s or supe rnatural beings have it and can impart it, and it belongs essentially to persona l beings who originate it, though it may act through the medium of water, or a ston e or a bone ” (p. 119) . That is, it can be gathered from the pow ers that were pre - persona l and elemental, as well as from the ancestral spirits who are persona l. The Melanesian gathering his mana may be seen in the Manes of the Egyp tian Ritual in the act of collecting his magical pow er. Here the mana is magical, and it is described as the great magic Ur - heka which is formulated for use as the word of pow er that can be directed at will by the Manes in pos session of it. The soul of the deceased has great need of this supe rhum an pow er in his passage through Amenta. It is by means of this he ope ns the door s that are closed against him, makes 171 his transformations , and conque rs the direst of all difficulties. He collects his magical charm or word of pow er from every place and thing in which it exists and from which it rays out (ch. 24, 2, 5). “Behol d,” he exclaims, “I bring my magical charms which I have collected from every qua rter,” more persistently than the hounds of chase and more swiftly than the light . I n this way he is drawing influence from the nature pow ers as well as from the ancestral spirits. At a later stage of the present inqui ry it will be show n how the Egypt ian eschatology was formulated in the moul d of the mythol ogy. The typi cal seven soul s in the one are repeated as a type in the other. The seven elemental pow ers were cont inue d as the seven soul s of Ra, and are described as “the ancestors of Ra.” Thus , when the persona lity of the deceased is recons tituted in Amenta for the after life, it is on the founda tion of these seven external soul s, the highe st of which is represented by the “Ka.” The seventh in the series of soul s was personi fied in the hum an Horus, and this is the first soul to rise again and to be repeated after death as Horus in spiri t. When it is said of the Egypt ian king that spirit cons titutes his persona lity, he is Horus in spirit, the representative of Ra — the ka, or living likeness of the god on earth. The ka - image, then, is the type of this, the endur ing persona lity. With the Pel ew Islande rs the divine man is a spirit medium called a kor ong — that is, if the pow er be permanent; in other words, if he is naturally a medium , he is a kor ong . But they distingui sh betwixt the born kor ong and a person who may be temporarily pos sessed. The office of kor ong is not hereditary, and when the kor ong dies the manifestation of the spirit or the divine afflatus in anot her medium is eagerly awaited. This is looke d upon here, as elsewhere, as a new incarnation of the god , which show s that the reincarn ation was one of the pow er and not the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"personal ity of the kor ong . It was the pow er of seership, not the indi vidua l soul of the seer, that returned in the new avatar; hence the same pow er was not depende nt on the return of the same person. The pow er may be manifested by som e one of very low ly origin, but he is forthw ith exalted to the highe st place as a divine being. Thos e who are ignor ant of the facts of abnor mal expe rience are entirely “out of it,” bot h as stude nts and teachers of anthropol ogy . The most im portant of all data conc erning the origins of religion have to be om itted from their interpretation of the past of man, or, what is far worse, obf uscated with false or baseless expl anations . The wizards who are reverenced by the Australian Kurnai are thos e who can “go up aloft” and bring back information from the spirits of the departed com monly know n in many lands as “the ancestral spirits.” The spiritual medium ruled as a seer, a sorcerer, a diviner, a healer, who foresaw and uttered oracles, revealed s upe rior kno wledge by supe rnal pow er, and was looke d up to as a protector, a gua rdian spirit, because he was held to be in league with the spirit world; very divinity in a hum an form. The divine kings , the spiritual emperors, the gods in hum an gui se, the “s upe rnatural” beings , the intercessors for com mon peopl e, whether male or female, were incalculably earlier than the phys ical force hero, the pol itical ruler, or the ritualistic 172 priest. Hence it is amongs t the most unde velope d races, like the African and Melanesian, that these preserve their early status still. We have a survival of this status of the spirit medium in a modi fied form when the priest is called in as exor cist of spirits because he represents the wise man or wizard, in whom Latinity has t aken the place of the ancient wisdom . Thus when the ghos t of Hamlet’s father appe ars, Marcellus says, “Thou art a schol ar; speak to it, Horatio!” Som e of the most degraded abor igines among the dark race of Indi a still keep the pos ition of supe rior peopl e i n relation to the neighbou ring tribes on account of their being the masters of magical arts and the medium s of spirit intercour se. The Burghe rs of the Neilghe rry Hills have the custom of getting one of the neighbour ing tribe of Curum bars to sow the first h andf ul of seed and to reap the first sheaf of corn, evidently for mystical reasons , as the Curum bars are reput ed to be great sorcerers, and therefore the influence sought is spiritualistic which they are accredited with pos sessing. From the first sheaf thu s reaped cakes are made to be offered as an obl ation of first - fruits and eaten toge ther with the flesh of a sacrificial animal in a sacramental meal. (Harkne ss, Description of a Singul ar Abor iginal Race inhab iting the Sum mit of the Neilghe rry Hills, p. 56. ) Spirit medium s being cons idered divine beings , or immortals in a mortal gui se, like the Manus hya Devah, have been looke d to as the pur veyor s of a diviner essence than the protozoa of the ordinary mortal male for the procreation of children. “Rom an ladies ,” says Réclus, “flung themselves into the arms of the thaum aturgists, whom they took for qua si - divine beings able to bestow intenser pleasure and supe rior proge ny. ” The medium was looke d upon as a being loftily transcende nt, a channe l of com muni cation for the gods and the glorified in their intercour se with mortals. The Eskimos are not onl y willing but anxi ous that their Ange koks or spirit medium s should have sexua l intercour se with their wives, so that they may secure children supe rior to thos e of their o wn persona l begetting. The Ange kok is looke d upon as a medium for the descent of the hol y spirit, and as such"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"he is chos en to initiate young girls into the mystery of marriage. Thos e men who afterwards take the young wom an for wives cons ider this conne ctio n with the divine man a preparatory purification for motherhood . With other races it was looke d upon as a religious rite for the bride to coha bit with the hol y man or medium on the night before her marriage. There are instances, as on the Malabar coast, in which the bridegroom fees the hol y man to lie with his wife the first night after marriage. With the Cambodi ans, the right to spend the first night with the bride was the preroga tive of the priest. The Burmese great families have each their spiritual dire ctor, to whom they send their daught er before her weddi ng night , and, according to the official phrase, “pay him the hom age of the flow er of virginity.” A Brahm an priest com plained to Weitbrecht the missiona ry that he was the spiritual pur ifier in this sen se to no fewer than ten different wom en ( Jour nal des Missions Evangé listique s, 1852) , not one of whom was his ow n wife. According to Wilken, the Arabs act in the same way in order that the offspring may be ennobl ed. This practice – this desire for being enno bled – may have led to its being claimed as a right , the 173 jus prima noc tis, or right of the feuda l lord to sleep the first night with his vassal’s new - made bride. The primitive religious feeling woul d give the profounde st sanction to the pha llic rite. D escendi ng from the chief as a medium to the man whos e supr emacy was acknow ledge d on account of his courage, we find it was a custom with the Spartans for a hus band to select a hero or brave man to lie with his wife to beget heroic offspring. The offices of king, priest, or clergym an remain, but the vision and the faculty divine have fled. The king survives without the seal of sove reignt y, the priest without his spiritual influence, divines without divinity. The religious doctors still practise, but they are no longe r of the healing faculty. The curates cannot cure. False diplom as take the place of the genui ne warrant. The onc e living link cons idered to be the ever - living one is now the missing link betwixt two worlds. Inde ed, this was prepensely broke n by th e Christians, and that spiritualism was cast out as devilish which all gnos tics held to be divine. Blindne ss through believing a lie has taken the place of the “ope n vision” which was sought of old. The priests remain as medium s, without the medium istic fa culty; but they still take the tithe and receive paym ent for performing the magical rites as qua lified intermediaries betwixt the gods and men or wom en. Nor is the belief in their spiritual pot ency as fathers in God entirely extinct. The theory and practi ce of magic were funda mentally based on spiritualism. The greatest magician or sorcerer, witch or wizard, was the spirit medium . The magical appe al made in mimetic Sign - langua ge was addr essed to supe rhum an pow ers as the ope rative force. The spirits might b e elemental or ancestral, but without the one or the other there was no such thing as magic or sove reignt y. In one of its most primitive aspects magic was a mode of soliciting and propi tiating the supe rhum an elemental pow ers or animistic spirits, the want, the wish, the intention, or com mand being acted and chiefly expressed in Sign - langua ge. In anot her pha se it was the appl ication of secret know ledge for the produc tion of abnor mal phe nom ena for the pur pos e of cons ulting the ancestral spirits. The hyp not ic pow er of the serpent ove r its victims was recogni zed as magical. This is show n in the Ritual when the speaker says to the serpent that “goe th on his belly” (ch. 149) , “I am the man who put s a veil (of"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"darkne ss) on thy head.” “I am the great magician.” “Thi ne eyes have been given to me, and through them I am glorified.” He has wrested the magical pow er called its strengt h from the serpent by taking pos session of its eyes, and by this means he is the great magician. Black magic has its secrets onl y to be mut tered in the dark. In the mysteries of the Obeah and Voudou cults it was held that the starveling ghos ts coul d be evoke d by offerings of blood, and that they were able to materialize the more readily and becom e visible in the fum es of this phys ical element of life. Other mysteries of primitive spiritualism might be cited. For example, Miss Kings ley, who was so profound ly impressed on the subj ect of African “fetishism,” mentions a class of wom en who had com mitted adul tery with spirits, and who were recogni ze d as hum an out casts by the natives of West Africa, and cons eque ntly accursed ( West African Studi es, p. 148 ). 174 Sexua l com merce betwixt hum an sensitives and spirits is know n alike to the abor iginal races and to mode rn medium s. Telepathic com munication o f mind with mind directed by the pow er of will even without words was a mode of magic practised by the primitive spiritualists. All that is now adays effected unde r the names of hypnot ism, mesmerism, or hum an magne tism was know n of old as magic. In Egypt ian the word Heka, for magic, means to charm, enchant, or ensnare; it also signi fies thought and rule — ergo, thought as ruling pow er was a mode of magic; and the God Taht, the ruling pow er of thought , the thinke r personi fied, was the divine magician, mainly as the transformer in the moon . One mode of exercising magical pow er practised by Australian medicine - men, though not limited to them, is to poi nt at the person who is being ope rated on with a stick or bone . This is done to rende r the person unc ons cious . The refore the “poi nting - stick” thus used is a kind of magic wand, equi valent to the disk of the mode rn mesmerist intende d to fix attention and induc e the condi tion of com a. Pointing with the stick was naturally preceded by poi nting with the finge rs, as in mod ern hypnot ism. The “magne tic fluid” of the mode rn mesmerist was know n to the African mystery - men from time immemorial. This again corresponds to the magical fluid of the Egypt ians called the “Sa,” which was imparted from one body to anot her by the laying o n of hands or making passes as in hypnot izing. The Sa was a sort of ichor that circulated in the veins of the gods and the glorified. This they coul d com muni cate to mortals, and thus give health, vigou r, and new life. Maspero says the gods themselves were not equa lly charged with the Sa. Som e had more, som e less, their energy being in propor tion to the qua ntity. Thos e who pos sessed most gave willingl y of their supe rfluity to thos e who lacked, and all coul d readily transmit the virtue of it to manki nd. This transfusion was most easily accom plished in the temples. “The king or any ordinary man who wished to be impregna ted presented himself before the statue of the god , and squa tted at its feet with his back to the statue. The statue then placed its right hand on the nape of his neck, and by making passes caused the fluid to flow from it and to accum ulate in him as in a receiver.” By transmitting their Sa of life to mortals the gods cont inua lly needed a fresh supply, and there was a lake of life in the nor thern heaven, called the Lake of Sa, whither they went to draw the magical ichor and recruit their energies, when exha usted, at this celestial fount of healing. (Maspero, The Daw n of Civilization, Eng. tr., p. 110. ) Khuns u Nefer - hetep, the great god, giver of"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"or acles in Thebes, was the caster - out of demons , the driver - away of obs essing spirits; and in the story of “The Possessed Princess” his statue is sent for by the Chief of Bakht en to exor cise an evil spirit that has taken pos session of his daught er. This is e ffected by the god imparting the Sa, from the magical pow er of which the evil demon flees. ( Records, vol . IV, p. 55.) Magic has been described as a system of supe rstition that preceded religion. But magical ceremoni es and incantations are religious , inasm uch as they are addr essed to supe rhum an pow ers. Magical ceremoni es were religious rites. If religion signi fies a propi tiation or conc iliation of pow ers supe rior to man, it is not necessarily oppos ed to magic, which suppl ied the most ready means of influenc ing such 175 pow ers that were pos tulated as extant. Various modes of so - called “sym pathetic magic” have been practised in making a primitive appe al to the pow ers. The Tshi - speaking peopl e have a magical ceremony, the name of which denot es an invoc ation t o the gods for pity and protection. In time of war the wives of the men who are with the army dance publ icly stark naked through the tow n, how ling, shrieking, gesticulating, and brandi shing kni ves and swords like warriors gone insane. And from head to foot their bodi es are painted of a dead - white colour . (Ellis, A. B., The Tshi - speaking Peopl es, p. 226. ) Dancing in a state of nudi ty was a mode in which the wom en show ed the natural magic of the sex. Being all in white, they danced as spirits in the presence of the pow ers, whether sym pathetic or not , whilst soliciting aid and protection for their men enga ged in battle. In magic there was also a sense of bindi ng as the root idea of religion, far beyond the meaning of the word re - ligio in Latin. The bon d or tie had been magical before it was moral, as we find it in the “bonds of gesa” and other mode s of bindi ng by means of magical spells. One mode of com pelling spirits was by the making of a tie, and of tying knot s as a mode of acting the desire or of exhi biting cont rolling pow er. The most primitive and prevalent type of the African gree - gree is a magical tie. The magic of this proceeding was on the same plane as the utterance of the “words that com pel,” onl y the intent was visibly enacted in the langua ge of signs , how soever accom panied in the langua ge of sounds . The character of the fetish - man was cont inue d by the Christian priest. According to the prom ise made to Peter in the Gospels, it is said, “Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loos e on earth shall be loos ed in heaven” (Matt. XVI. 19). And thus in the latest official religion the pow er to bind, tie up, and make fast was reconf erred on Rom e, where theologi cal beliefs became identical with spiritual and intell ectual bonda ge. This attitude of cont rolling, com mandi ng, and binding of the supe rhum an pow ers by means of magic also poi nts to the low ly origin of these nature pow ers which became more and more inferior and of less and less account in later times when th ey were supe rseded by other “spirits” or gods , and the practices of magic were less and less appr opr iate to a deepening sense of the divine. The earliest hum an soul which follow ed thos e that were derived from the external elements had not attained the pow er of reproduc tion for an after - life, on which account the likeness of the Elder Horus in the mythos is an impube scent child. But when he makes his transformation in death Horus has acqui red the reproduc ing pow er, as"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"show n by his figur e of the virile male, por trayed in the person of Amsu, who arises from the tom b in ichthypha llic form. In the eschatology the reproduc ing pow er is spiritual. It is the pow er of resurrection and of reappe aring as a spirit — that is, the divine doubl e of the hum an soul , which was tabul ated as the eight h in degree. The soul that coul d reappe ar victorious ly beyond the grave was a soul that coul d reproduc e itself for “times infinite,” or for eternity. When Horus rose again from the dead as the divine doubl e of the hum an Horus he excla ims, “I am he who com eth forth and proceedeth. I am the everlasting one . I am Horus who 176 steppe th onw ards through eternity. (Rit., ch. 42. ) “I am the link. ” This is he who had passed and uni ted a soul that was elemental with the spirit that was held t o be divine. This is the soul beyond the hum an, which has pow er to reproduc e itself in spirit and prove it by the reappe arance of the Ka or doubl e of the dead. The Kamite Ka is por trayed in the Egypt ian drawings as a spiritual likeness of the body, to iden tify it with the soul of which it is the so - called doubl e — the soul , that is, which has the pow er to dup licate itself in escaping from the clutch of death, and to reappe ar in rarer form than that of the mortal, as the soul or spirit out side the body to be s een in apparition or by the vision of the seers. The ardent wish of the deceased in Amenta to attain the pow er of appe aring onc e more on the earth is expr essed again and again in the Ritual as the desire to becom e a soul or spirit that has the pow er to rep roduc e itself in appa rition, or as the doubl e of the former self, which was imaged in the Ka; the desire for cont inual dur ation after death, or in other words for everlasting life, also with the pow er to reappe ar upon the earth am ong the living. “My dur at ion” the speaker calls his Ka (ch. 105) . All life through it was an image of the highe r spiritual self, divine in origin and dur ation. The speaker cont inue s, “May I com e to thee (the Ka) and be glorified and ensoul ed?” It was a soul that coul d be drawn upo n and lived on in this life as a sort of food of heaven and sustenance for a future life. The Ka was propi tiated or worshippe d – that is, saluted with obl ations – as a divine ideal. It was the Ka of the god that was “propitiated according to his pleasure.” (Ri t., ch. 133. ) It was the Ka of the Pharaoh that was worshippe d as the image of Ra. So when the Manes propi tiates the Ka - image of himself it is not an offering to his mortal self, but to that highe r spiritual self which was now held to be an emanation of th e divine nature, and which had the pow er of reappe aring and demons trating cont inui ty after death. The Kamite equi valent for eternal life is the permanent persona lity which was imaged by or in the Ka. With the Tshi - speaking tribes the Ka is called the Kra, which name answers to the Kla of the Karens. The Kra, like the Ka, is looke d upon as the genius or gua rdian spirit who dw ells in a man, but whos e conne ction with him terminates when the Ka transforms or merges into the Sisa or endur ing spirit. According to Ellis, “when a man dies his Kra becom es a Sisa, and the Sisa can be born again to becom e a Kra in a new body” ( Tshi - speaking Peopl es, p. 149 .) The Ka was com mon to Inne r Africa as a statue or por trait of the spiritual man. Whilst the mum my of a king of Co ngo was being made, an image of the deceased was set up in the palace to represent him, and was daily presented with food and drink. This was his living likeness, his spiritual doubl e, which the Egypt ians called the Ka. The obj ect of worship or propi tiatio n was the Ka, not the"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"mum my. The Ka imaged the ghos t or doubl e itself, and not a spirit suppos ed to be residential in the mummy. The Esqui maux, the Lapps , and other nor thern races also preserved the Egypt ian Ka, especially in relation to the Shaman or Ange kok, who has his Ka or doubl e like the Egypt ian priest. With this he uni tes himself in soul when about to divine and make his revelations in the state of trance. 177 Uniting with the Ka or genius is a mode of describing his entrance into the spirit or th e entrance of the inspiring spirit into him. The practice of the Mexicans and others, who made an image of the dead and placed it on the altar and offered obl ations to it, show s that their effigy also represented the Ka or spiritual likeness. Amongs t many races an image of the deceased person was set up to receive the obl ations of food and drink. All primitive spiritualists held that in death the spirit rose again and lived on still, and for this reason the Ka statue was erected in the fune rary chamber as i t had been in the forest hut . A black shadow of the body cast upon the ground coul d not demons trate the existence of an eternal soul ; neither coul d the hawk or serpent or any other sym bol of force. But the Ka is the doubl e of the dead. It is a figur e of th e ghost. The Ka, then, was an image of the onl y soul of all the series that ever coul d be seen outside the hum an body. This was whol ly distinct from the soul of life in a tree, a plant, a bird, a beast, or a reptile, because it was an appa rition of the hum an soul made visible in the hum an form. The Battas of Sum atra have the seven soul s like the Egypt ians. One of these is out side the body, but when it dies, how ever far away it may be from the man, he also dies, his life being bound up with it. But the origi n and signi ficance of the Ka, toge ther with the doc trine of its propi tiation, are expl icitly stated in the rubrical directions to ch. 144 of the Ritual. At this stage of his spiritual progr ess the deceased has reached the poi nt where the mum my Osiris has t ransformed into the risen Horus, the divine one who is the eight h at the head of the seven great spirits. Thus , in the mysteries of Amenta, hum an Horus dies to rise again as lord of the resurrection and to manifest as doubl e of the dead. He is divinized in the character of the ghos t, and as such he becom es the spirit medium for his father, the hol y spirit; his “Witness for Eternity,” who is called the onl y - begot ten and anoi nted son. In this character the deceased is Horus in spirit, ready for the boa t of Ra . An effigy of the boa t was to be made for the deceased. Amongs t the other instructions given it is said that “a figur e of the deceased is to be made” in presence of the “gods .” This figur e is the Ka. Hence the obl ations of flesh and blood , bread and beer, ungue nts and incense, are to be offered; and it is stated that this is to be done to make the spirit of the deceased to live. It is also prom ised that the ceremony, if faithfully performed, will give the Osiris strengt h among the gods and cause his stride s to increase in Amenta, earth, and heaven. Thus the Ka image to which the offerings were made was representative of the deceased who lived on in the spirit, whether gropi ng in the nether world, or walking the earth as the ghos t, or voya ging the celestial water in the boa t of Ra on his way to the heaven of eternity. Naturally enough, the sustenance of life was offered to feed the life of thos e who were held to be the living, not the dead. Amongs t the other things it is com mande d that four measures of blood shall be offered to the spirit or Ka image of the deceased. The doc trine is identical with that of the other races who gashed and gor ed their bod ies to feed the spirits of the departed with their blood, because the blood was the life, and because it was"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"th e life they desiderated for their dead. In the same rubr ical directions it is ordered that incense shall be bur ned in presence of the Ka image as 178 an offering to the spirit of Osiris - Nu, and in Sign - langua ge incense represents the breath of life; in t hat way anot her element of life besides blood was offered the deceased “to make that spirit live.” And the offerings are to be presented to the Ka image of the deceased. Thus the Egypt ian wisdom witnesses and avouc hes that the primitive practices of offeri ng food and drink to the dead, and more especially the soul of life in blood , were based upon the pos tulate that the so - called dead were living still in spirit form. And, obvi ous ly enough, the sustenance of life was offered to feed the life of thos e who we re held to be living because seen to be existing in the likeness that was represented by the hum an figur e of the spirit - Ka. It is one of the various delusions recrude scent in our day that theology began with the self - revelation to the world of a one and o nly god . No delusion or mania coul d be a grosser birth of mode rn ignor ance, more especially as the “onl y one ” of the oldest know n beginni ng was female and not male; the mother, not the father — the godde ss, not the god. The Egypt ians gave a primary and perm anent expr ession to the dum b thought of the non - speaking, sign - making races that preceded them in the old African hom e. But they did not begin by personi fying any vague infinite with a definite face and form, nor by worshippi ng an abstraction which is but the shadow of a shade, and not the image of any subs tance know n. In the Book of the Dead (ch. 144 ) the adorations are addr essed to the Great Mother Sekhe t - Bast as the supr eme being, she who was unc reated by the gods and who was worshippe d as the “Only One” ; she who existed with no one before her, the only one might ier than all the gods , who were born of her, the Great Mother, the All - Mother when she was the “Only One.” By a cunni ng cont rivance this Great Mother is show n to be the onl y one who coul d bring fo rth bot h sexes. As Apt, and again as Neith, the genetrix or creatress is por trayed as female in nature, but also having the virile member of the male. This was the onl y one who coul d bring forth both sexes. She was figur ed as male in front and female in th e hinde r part (Birch, Egyptian Gallery ). Here we may refer to the Arunta traditions of the Alcheringa ancestors relating to the beings who were half wom en and half men when they first started on their jour ney, but before they had proceeded very far their o rgans were modi fied and they became as other wom en are (N. T., p. 442) . The mother was inde ed the Only One in the beginning, how ever various her manifestations in nature. She was the birthpl ace and abode . She was the Earth - mother as the bringe r forth, the giver of food and drink who was invoke d as the provi der of plenty. As the Great Mother she was depicted by a pregna nt hippopot amus. As a crocodi le she brought the water of the inunda tion. As Apt the water - cow , Hathor the milch - cow , or Rerit the sow she wa s the suckler. As Rannut she was the serpent of renewal in the fruits of earth. As the Mother of Life in vegetation, she was Apt in the dom - palm, Uati in the papyr us, Hathor in the sycamore - fig, Isis in the persea - tree. In one character, as the Mother of C orn, she is called the Sekhe t or field, a title of Isis; all of which preceded her being imaged in the hum an likeness, because she was the mother"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 179 divinized. This is the “onl y one ” who is said to have been extant from the time when as yet there had be en no birth (Brugs ch, Theosaur us In. Eg., p. 637) . The mother gave birth to the child as Horus, who came by water in the fish, the shoot of the papyr us, the branch of the tree, and other forms of food and drink that were most sorely needed. Hence the child as bringe r was a saviour to the land of Egypt . In the beginni ng of the Egypt ian theology , then, the Word was not the god, but the godde ss. The fecundi ty, the pow er, the glory, and the wisdom of the primordial bringe r forth were divinized in the Great Mot her, who was worshippe d at Ombos as the “Living Word.” In one of her many forms she is the lione ss - headed Sekhe t - Bast, who was the obj ect of adoration in Inne r Africa as “the Only One.” Follow ing the mythical mother, the son became her word or logos , and i n Sebek - Horus the Word was god. This was in the mythol ogy that preceded the eschatology. The earliest mode of worship recogni zable was in propi tiation of the supe rhum an pow er. This pow er of necessity was elemental, a pow er that was obj ectified by means of the living type ; and again of necessity the obj ect of propi tiation, invoc ation, and solicitation was the pow er itself, and not the type s by which it was imaged in the langua ge of signs . But, if we use the word worship at all, then serpent worship is the p ropi tiation of the pow er that was represented by the serpent as a proxy for the supe rhum an force. The pow er might be that of renewal in the fruits of earth which was divinized in the serpent godde ss Rannut or in the serpent of the inunda tion. “Tree worship ” was the propi tiation of a pow er in nature that was represented by the tree and by the vegetation that was given for food. Although the vot ive offerings were hung upon its branches, the tree itself was not the obj ect of the offering, but the pow er personi fied in Hathor or Nut as giver in the tree. Waitz tells the story of a Negro who was making an offering of food to a tree, when a bys tande r remarked that a “tree did not eat food .” The Negro replied: “Oh, the tree is not fetish; the fetish is a spirit and invi sible, but he has descende d into this tree. Certainly he cannot devou r our bodi ly food, but he enjoys its spiritual part, and leaves behind the bodi ly part which we see.” This, then, was not tree worship as com monl y assum ed; the tree was not the obj ect of religious regard. There was a spirit or pow er beyond that manifested in the tree. In like manne r, earth worship was the propi tiation of the pow er in nature that was worshippe d as the Great Mother, the bringe r forth and nur se of life, the “onl y one ” who was the produc er of plenty. The most primitive man kne w what he wanted. The obj ects of perpetual desire and longi ng were food and fecundi ty. It has been show n that the Egypt ian gods were primarily the elemental pow ers, and how the ancestral spirits becam e the glorified elect in the Egypt ian eschatology. It is now pos sible to trace the one god of the Osirian religion as the final out com e from the original rootage, the culmination and cons um mate flow er of all. Before the hum an father coul d be persona lized as the proge nitor it woul d seem that causation was represented by the embryo in utero, the child, whom the Egypt ians called the fecunda tor of the 180"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" mother. The eternal child is thus addr essed in one of the solar litanies: “O, thou beautiful being, who renewest within thys elf in season as the disk within thy mother Hathor ”; as “the Heir of Eternity, self - begot ten and self - bor n.” According to the Ritual, life was appr ehende d as a mode of motion or renewal com ing of itself, in the water welling from the ea rth, the vegetation springi ng from the water, or, more mystically manifested, in the blood of the pube scent virgin. The type of this self - motion is the eternal, ever - com ing child. Hence Child - Horus claims to be “the primary pow er of motion” (Rit., ch. 63 A ) . This was as the child of her who came from herself, the seventh soul that was imaged as Horus, the mortal who was incarnated in the virgin blood. There is anot her curious thing worth not ing. The seven elemental pow ers or animistic soul s were all male, an d male onl y, which may account for the tradition that women have no soul s, unl ess they derive them from the male; whereas the second Horus, Horus in spirit, represented a soul of bot h sexes, as the typi cal witness for the parent in heaven. With the Egyp tia ns (of the Ritual) real existence and endur ing persona lity were spiritual, and these were imaged by the Ka type of an existence and persona lity which coul d only be attained in spirit. The Ka image represented an endur ing or eternal soul as a divine ideal t hat was already realized, even in this life, by the bor n immortals who were medium s of the spirit. But for others it was a type of that which had to be attained by indi vidua l effort. On entering Amenta the soul of the deceased was not necessarily immortal. He had to be born again as a spirit in the likeness of Horus divinized. Thus the man of seven soul s was said to be attende d or accom panied all life through by the Ka likeness of an immortal spirit, which was his genius, gua rdian, gui de, or protector, to b e realized in death, when he rose again and manifested as the Ka or eid ō l on of the dead — that is, as the ghos t, the eight h man, the man from heaven, the Christ or risen Horus of the gnos is. The process of com poundi ng the many gods in one is made appa rent w hen Osiris says, “I am one , and the pow ers of all the gods are my pow ers” (Rit., ch. 7). In the cour se of uni fying the nature pow ers in one , the mother godde ss with the father god was blende d first in Ptah, the biune being, as a type of dua l sour ce such as was illustrated by the custom s of couva de and subi ncision, in which the figur e of the female was assum ed by the man with a vul va or the divinity as parturient male, the type that was repeated in bot h Atum and Osiris, as well as in Brahm a and Jehova h. In t he inscription of Shabaka from Memphi s, Ptah, in one of his divine forms, is called “the mother giving birth to Atum and the associate gods ” (line 14). The highe st of the elemental pow ers was divinized as solar in the astronom ical mythol ogy. This was the Elder Horus, who had been the soul of vegetation in the shoot of the papyrus plant as produc t of the inunda tion. As the young sun god he was now the calf or child upon the Western Mount and leader of the seven glorious Khut i (Rit., ch. 17) . In his second a dve nt, at his resurrection from Amenta, he became the Horus in spirit, Horus of the resurrection, he who arose hawk - headed on the Eastern Mount . This was Atum - 181 Horus, he in whom the spirit or ghos t was blende d with the elemental pow er in Atum - Ra, who had attained the status of the hol y spirit in the Egypt ian eschatology. The eight h was"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"now the highe st of the series as the god who demonstrated the pow er of resurrection by his rising from the dead, first as the sun, next as the soul which was represente d by the Ka as the image of the reappe aring other self. The god s were thus “essentialized in the one ” (as Thom as Taylor phr ased it): the seven in Horus the mortal, the eight in Horus of the resurrection, the nine in Ptah, or, as Damascius obs erved, “speaki ng Chaldaically,” “in the paternal peculiarity” ( Iam blichus on the Mysteries, by Thomas Taylor, not e, p. 74, ed. 1895) . This god was impersona ted as the one in Atum - Ra, the “Holy Spirit.” There was no god personi fied as the father in spirit unt il the All - O ne was uni que ly imaged in Atum - Ra as the first wearer of the Atef crow n, and in him the god in spirit was bas ed upon the ghos t instead of the earlier elemental soul . Not onl y was the “paternal peculiarity” represented in Atum as a begetter, he was the bege tter of soul s, or rather of soul and spirit; the one being persona lized in his son Hu, the other in his son Sa (or Ka). The soul of man the mortal had been derived from the seven elemental pow ers, includi ng the mother blood (Rit., ch. 85) . This was diviniz ed in Horus, who was Atum as the child (Tum ) the first Adam in the Hebrew creation. The soul of man the immortal was now derived from Atum - Ra, the father in spirit, and imaged in Nefer - Atum , the Hebrew second Adam. This was Horus of the resurrection as an eight h soul , the out com e of the seven. The soul with pow er to reproduc e itself in death was now an image of eternal life as Horus who became the resurrection and the life to men. The one god in spirit and in truth, personi fied in Atum - Ra, was worshippe d a t Annu as Huhi the eternal, also as the Ankhu or ever - living one in the character and with the title of the Holy Spirit. He is described as the divinized ghos t. Hence it is said that “it is Atum who nour ishes the doubl es” of the dead, he who is first of th e divine enne ad, “perfect ghos t am ong the ghos ts” (Hym n to Osiris, lines 3 and 4.) There was no father god or divinized begetter among the seven primordial pow ers. They were a com pany of brothers. Ptah was the first type of a father individua lized as the f ather who transforms into his ow n son, and also as a father and mother in one person. Ra, as the name implies, is the creator god , the god in spirit founde d on the ghos t. He is god of the ancestral spirits, the first to attain that spiritual basis for the next life which the Ka or doubl e in this life vouc hed for after death. Hence Atum - Ra was deified as “the perfect ghos t among the ghos ts,” or the god in spirit at the head of the nine. The elemental soul s were blende d with the hum an in the deity Ptah, and i n Atum - Ra, his successor, the ancestral spirit was typi fied and divinized as a god in perfect hum an form, who became the typi cal father of the hum an race and of immortal soul s proceeding from him as their creator, who is now to be distingui shed from all pr evious gods which had reproduc ed by transformation and by reincorpor ation or incarnation of the elemental pow ers. Thus the gods of Egypt originated in various mode s of natural 182 phe nom ena, but the phe nom ena were also spiritual as well as phys ical, the one god being ultimately worshippe d as the hol y spirit. Both categor ies of the gods and the glorified were, so to speak, com bined and blende d in the one person of Atum - Ra, who imaged the highe st elemental pow er as soul of the sun in the mythol ogy, and was divinized as Ra the hol y spirit, the ghos t of ghos ts, in the Egypt ian eschatology. The reappe aring human"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"spirit thus suppl ied the type of an eternal spirit that was divinized and worshippe d as the Holy Ghos t in Egypt and in Rom e. Maspero has said of Egyp t that she never accepted the idea of the one sole god beside whom there is none other ( The Daw n of Civilization, Eng. tr., p. 152) . But here the “one god” is a phr ase. What is meant by the phr ase? Which, or who, is the one god intende d? Every description appl ied to the one god in the Hebrew writings was pre - extant in the Egypt ian. Atum - Ra declares that he is the one god , the one just or right eous god, the one living god, the one god living in truth. He is Unicus, the sole and onl y one (Rit., chs. 2 and 17) , beside whom there is none other; onl y, as the later Egypt ians put it, he is the onl y one from whom all other pow ers in nature were derived in the earlier type s of deity. When Atum is said to be “the Lord of one ness,” that is but anot her way of calling hi m the one god and of recogni zing the developm ent and uni fication of the one supr eme god from the many, and acknow ledgi ng the birth of monot heism from pol ytheism, the culmination of manifold pow ers in one supr eme pow er, which was in accordance with the cour se of evol ution. In the Ritual (ch. 62) the Everlasting is described as Neb - Huhi Nuti Terui - f, the Eternal Lord, he who is without limit. And, again, the infinite god is por trayed as he who dilates without limit, or who is the god of limitless dilation, Fu - nen - tera, as a mode of describing the infinite by means of the illimitable. And it is this Nen - tera that we claim to be at the root of the word Nnut er or Nûter. Here the conc eption is not hing so inde finite or general as that of pow er. Without limit is bey ond the finite, and cons eque ntly equa l to the infinite. Teru also signi fies time. The name, therefore, conve yed the conc eption of beyond time. Thus Nnut er (or Nuter) denot ed the illimitable and eternal in one , which is som ething more expressive than mere p ow er. Pow er is of cour se include d, and the Nuter sign, the stone axe, is a very primitive sign of pow er. Of this one supr eme god it is said in the Hym n to the Nile or to Osiris, as “the water of renewal”: “He careth for the state of the poor . He maketh hi s might a buc kler. He is not graven in marble. He is not beheld. He hath neither ministrants nor offerings . He is not adored in sanctuaries. No shrine is found with painted figur es. There is no bui lding that can cont ain him. He dot h not manifest his forms. Vain are all representations .” ( Records of the Past, vol. IV.) Also, in the hym n to the hidde n god Amen - Ra, a title of Atum , he is saluted as “the one in his works,” “the one alone with many hands , lying awake while all men sleep to seek out or cons ider t he good of his creatures,” “the one maker of existence,” “the one alone without a peer,” “king alone , singl e among the gods ” ( Records of the Past, vol . II, 129 ). Surely this is equi valent to the one god with none beside him, so far as langua ge can go. The Egypt ians had all 183 that ever went to the making of the one god, onl y they bui lt on founda tions that were laid in nature, and did not begin en l’air with an idea of the “sole god” in any abstract way. Their one god was begot ten before he was conc eived. Egypt did not accept the idea. She evol ved and revealed it from the onl y data in existence, includi ng thos e of phe nom enal spiritualism which suppl ied the idea of a hol y ghos t that was divinized in the likeness of the hum an — the onl y data, as matter of fact , from which the conc ept coul d have ever been evol ved; and but for the Egypt ians, neither Jews nor Christians woul d have had a"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"god at all, either as the one , or three, or three - in - one. There is no beginni ng anyw here with the conc ept of a “one god” as male ideationa lly evol ved. But for thous ands of years before the era called Christian the Egypt ians had attained the idea, and were trying to expr ess it, of the one god who was the one soul of life, the one self - generating, self - sustaining force, the one mind m anifesting in all mode s of phe nom ena; the self - existent one , the almighty one , the eternal one ; the pillar of earth, the ark of heaven, the backbone of the uni verse, the bread of heaven and water of life; the Ka of the hum an soul , the way, the truth, the r esurrection, and the life everlasting; the one who made all things , but himself was not made. But, onc e more, what is the idea of the one god as a Christian conc ept? The one god of the Christians is a father manifesting through one historic son by means of a virgin Jewess. Whereas the father was the one god of the Egypt ians in the cult of Atum - Ra which was extant before the monum ents began ten thous and years ago. Only, the son of the one god in Egypt was not historic nor limited to an indi vidual personal ity . It was the divine nature manifesting as the soul of bot h sexes in hum anity. The one god of the Christians is a trinity of persons cons isting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and these three cons tituted the one god in the religion which is at least as old as the coffin of Men - Ka - Ra, who is called “Osiris living eternally, king of the doubl e earth,” nearly six thous and years ago. Finally, in the Egypt ian theology Osiris is Neb - Ua, the one and onl y lord. All previous pow ers were united in his pow er. Whe re Ra had seventy - two names denot ing his attribut es, Osiris has ove r one hundr ed and fifty. All that was recogni zed as beneficent in nature was sum marized in Osiris. All the supe rhum an pow ers previous ly extant were com bined and blende d in the final form of the all - in - one — the motherhood include d. For in the trinity of Osiris, Horus, and Ra, which three are one , the first person is imaged in the likeness of bot h sexes. Osiris as male with female mammæ is a figur e of the nour isher and sour ce of life, who had b een from the beginni ng when the mother was the “onl y one .” The one god of the Egypt ian theology culminated as the eternal pow er of evol ution, reproduc tion, transformation, renewal, and rebirth from death to life, on earth in food, and to a life of the soul that is perpetuated in the spirit. The one ness of the godhe ad uni fied from all the godde sses and gods was finally com pounde d in this supr eme one inclusive deity, in whom all others were absorbed — Horus and Sut, as twins of light and darkne ss; the seven ele mental pow ers, as the seven soul s; 184 Nnu, father of the celestial water, as the water of renewal in Osiris; Seb, the father of food on earth, as the father of divine food or bread of heaven in Amenta. The mother and father were com bined in Ptah as the one parent. Atum - Horus assum ed the form of man, as son of Seb on earth; Osiris - Sekeri that of the mummy in Amenta, as god the ever - living in matter; and Ra, bird - headed, as an image of the hol y spirit. Horus the elder was the manifestor as the eternal chil d of Isis the virgin mother and his foster - father Seb, the god of earth; and at his second adve nt in Amenta Horus became the son of the father in heaven as a final character in the Osirian drama. Taht gave place to Osiris in the moon , Ptah to Osiris in the Tat, Anup to Osiris as the gui de of ways at the pol e. It is said in the Hym n to Osiris that “he cont ains the doubl e enne ad of the doubl e land.” He is “the"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"principle of abunda nce in Annu” ; he gives the water of renewal in the Nile, the breath of life in th e blessed breezes of the north, the bread of life in the grain. And, lastly, he is the food that never perishes; the god who gives his ow n body and blood as the sacramental sustenance of soul s; the Bull of Eternity who is reincorpor ated periodi cally as the calf, or, unde r the anthropo morphi c type , as Horus the ever reincarnating, ever - com ing child who rose up from the dead to image an eternal soul . Such was the god in whom the all at last was uni fied in one ness and as One.   185 EGYPTI AN BOOK OF THE DEAD AND THE MYSTERIES OF AMENTA B OOK IV The Egypt ian Book of the Dead cont ains the oldest know n religious writings in the world. As it com es to us it is mainly Osirian, but the Osirian group of gods was the latest of all the divine dyna s ties, although these, as show n at Abydos (by Prof. Flinde rs Petrie), will account for som e ten thous and years of time in Egypt . The antiqui ty of the collection is not to be judge d by the age of the coffins in which the papyr us rolls were found. Amongs t oth er criteria of lengt h in time the absence of Amen, Maut, and Khuns u suppl ies a gauge . The presence and impor tance of Tum affords anot her, whilst the persistence of Apt and her son Sebek - Horus tells a tale of times incalculably remote."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" As a key to the myst eries and the method of the book it must be unde rstood at starting that the eschatology or doc trine of Last Things was founde d in the moul d of the mythol ogy , and that the one can onl y be unr aveled by means of the other. Moreove r, there is plenty of evidenc e to prove that the Ritual was based on the mythol ogy, and not the mythol ogy upon the Ritual. The serpent, of darkne ss, was the evil reptile in mythol ogy. In theology it becom es the delude r of manki nd. Here the beginning was with darkne ss itself, which was the deceiver from the first. The serpent, being a figur e of darkne ss, was cont inue d by theology as the official adve rsary of soul s in the eschatologi cal dom ain. The eschatology of the Ritual, then, can onl y be com prehende d by means of the mythol ogy. And i t is the mythos out of view that has made the Ritual so profoundl y difficult to unde rstand. Reading it may be com pared with a dance seen by a deaf man who doe s not hear the music to which the motion is timed, and who has no clue to the characters being per formed in the dum b drama. You cannot unde rstand what they are doi ng and saying as Manes in anot her world without know ing what was thought and said by hum an beings in this conc erning that representation of the nature pow ers, the gods and godde sses, which co nstitutes mythol ogy. Amenta is a huge fossil formation crow ded with the dead forms of a past life in which the horny cons pectuities of learned ignor ance will onl y see dead shells for a mode rn museum . As a rule, Egyp t is always treated differently from the rest of the world. No Egypt ologi st has ever dreamed that the Ritual still exists unde r the 186 disgui se of bot h the gnos tic and canoni cal gos pels, or that it was the fount ain - head and sour ce of all the books of wisdom claimed to be divine. In the mythol ogy – that is, in the primitive mode of rende ring the phe nom ena of external nature – Osiris as light - giver in the moon was torn in fourteen pieces dur ing the latter half of the luna tion by the evil Sut, the oppos ing pow er of darkne ss. He was put toge ther again and recons tituted by his son, belove d Horus, the youn g solar god . This representation coul d not have been made unt il it was know n that the luna r light was replenished mont hly from the solar sour ce. Then Horus as the sun god and the vanqui sher of Sut, the pow er of darkne ss, coul d be called the recons tituter of Osiris in the moon . In that way a founda tion was laid in natural fact according to the science of mythol ogy , and a mystery beque athed to the eschatology which is doc trinal. For as it had been with the dismembered, mutilated god in the mythos , so it is with the Osiris deceased, who has to be recons tructed for a future life and put toge ther bit by bit as a spiritual body in one of the great mysteries of Amenta. In the mythos Har - Makhu was the solar god o f both hor izons , or the doubl e equi nox , who represented the sun of to - day that rose up from the nether world as conque ror of darkne ss to join the west and east toge ther on the Mount of Glory, as the conne cting link of cont inui ty in time betwixt yesterday a nd to - morrow. The type was cont inue d in the eschatology, when Har - Makhu became the Horus of the greater mysteries, Horus of the religious legend who suffered, died, and was bur ied in Amenta, and who rose again from the dead like the winter sun, as Horus in spirit, lifting aloft the insigni a of his sove reignt y. This was he who made the pathw ay, not merely betwixt the two hor izons , but to eternal life, as son of Ra, the hol y spirit in the eschatology . The intermediate link in the mythos , which “conne cts the s olar orb with yesterday,” is now the intermediary betwixt the two"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"worlds and two lives in time and eternity. This is he who exclaims, “I am the link! I am the everlasting one ! I am Horus who steppe th onw ards through eternity” (Rit., ch. 42.) This was he wh o, in the words of the gnos tic Paul, “broke dow n the wall of partition” and “made bot h one ,” “that he might create in himself one new man” and “reconc ile them bot h in one body, ” even as the doubl e Horus, Har - Sam - Taui, was made one when blende d and establis hed as one person in anot her mystery of Amenta (Rit., ch. 42) . The mythol ogy repeated in the Ritual is mainly solar and Osirian, but with glimpses of the luna r and the stellar mythos from the beginni ng. For example, Apt the ancient genetrix, as godde ss of the Great Bear cons tellation, and leader of the heavenly hos t, was the kindl er of the starry sparks by night in the mythol ogy . In the eschatology she is cont inue d as the mistress of divine protections for the soul , and she who had been the kindl er of the light s in the darkne ss of night was now propi tiated as rekindl er of life from the spark in the dark of death (Rit., ch. 137 B ). Ra in the mythos is the solar god represented by the sun in heaven, and in the eschatology he became the god in spirit who is cal led the hol y spirit and first person in the trinity which cons isted of Atum the father god, Horus the son, and Ra the hol y spirit; the three that were also one 187 in the Osirian cult, first as three forms of the solar god and next as three forms of the god in spirit. It is thus we are enabled to trace the formation of the Egypt ian eschatology in the moul d of the mythol ogy. There is no death in the Osirian religion, onl y decay and change , and periodi c renewal; onl y evol ution and transformation in the dom ain of matter and the transubs tantiation into spirit. In the so - called death of Osiris it is rebirth, not death, exactly the same as in the change s of external nature. At the close of day the solar orb went dow n and left the sun god staring blankl y in the dark of death. Taht the moon god met him in Amenta with the eye of Horus as the light that was to illum inate the darkne ss of the subt erranean world. In the annua l rende ring on the third day light was generated by renewal in the moon . Thus Osiris rose again , and a doc trine of the resurrection on the third day was beque athed to the eschatology. The sun in sinki ng was buried as a body (or mum my) in the nether world of Amenta. When rising again at dawn it was transformed into a soul , a supr eme elemental soul , t hat preceded the god in spirit. This was in the mythol ogy. In the eschatology the same type s were reappl ied to the hum an soul , which was imaged in the flesh as the inarticulate, blind, and impube scent Horus, who died bodi ly but was preserved in mum my form to make his transformation into the lum inous Sahu, when he rose again in glory as Horus the divine adul t. “I am the resurrection and the life” is the perfect interpretation of an Egyp tian picture that was copi ed by Denon at Philæ. ( Egypt, vol . II, pl. 40, no. 8, p. 54. ) (Lundy , fig. 183 .) Divine Horus is por trayed in the act of raising the deceased Osiris from the bier by presenting to him the Ankh sign of life. He was the life in person who performed the resurrection, and therefore is “the resurrection and the life.” As such he simply stands for a soul cons idered to be the divine offspring of god the father, not for any historical character that makes prepos terous pretensions to pos sess miraculous pow er. Previous ly he had been the resurrection and the life as solar vivifier in the phy sical dom ain, or otherwise stated in the mythology. It was this difference betwixt the mythol ogy and eschatology that cons tituted the lesser and the"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"greater mysteries. The lesser in their origin were partly sociologi cal. They we re the custom s and the ceremoni al rites of totemism. The greater mysteries are eschatologi cal and religious . For instance, the transformation of the yout h into the adul t or the girl into a wom an in the totemic mysteries was appl ied doc trinally to the trans formation of the soul in the mysteries of Amenta. With the more primitive races, such as the Arunt a of Australia, the mysteries remain chiefly totemic and sociologi cal, though interfused with the religious sentiment. The greater mysteries were perfected in the Egypt ian religion, to be read of in the Ritual as the mysteries of Amenta. From the beginni ng to the end of the written Ritual we shall find it is based upon the mythical representation which was primary. The mythical representation was first appl ied to the phe nom ena of external nature, and this mode of representation was cont inue d and 188 re - appl ied to the hum an soul in the eschatology. Egypt ian myths, then, are not inve ntions made to expl ain the Ritual. Totemic representation was earlier. This mod e was cont inue d in the mythol ogy . Ritual arose from the rende ring becom ing religious in the pha se of eschatology, and did not originate as an expl anation of mythol ogy and totemism. But not unt il the different pha ses are discriminated can the Ritual be read , that which has been founde d on it unde rstood, or the mental status of the thinke rs ascertained. In the mythol ogy the solar god, who in his primary form was Ptah (Khepr), is the maker of a com plete circle for the sun as founde r and ope ner of the nether ea rth, this solar pathw ay being a figure of for ever, a type of the eternal working in time. In the eschatology the god in spirit who is Ra the hol y spirit is “the god who has created (or ope ned out ) eternity” (Rit., ch. 15). The one is on the phys ical basis , the other on the spiritual plane. In the mythol ogy the seven primordial pow ers that pass through various pha ses, elemental, stellar, or luna r, always in a group of seven, finally becom e the seven soul s of Ra, who attained supr emacy as the sun god in myth ology and also as the hol y spirit. Thence came the doc trine of the seven soul s in man, as seven gifts of the holy spirit in the eschatology. In the mythical representation Sothis on New Year’s Day was the bringe r forth of the child that was mothered by Hat hor or Isis. The type is employe d in the eschatology of the Ritual when the Manes in Amenta prays for rebirth as a pure spirit and says, “May I live (or rise up and go forth) from between the closed kne es of Sothis.” The rebirth of the child in Sothis was the renewal of the year, Sothis being represented in the feminine character by Hathor as the bringe r forth from betwixt her kne es or, as elsewhere rende red, her khe ptu, i.e., her thighs . So the Manes are reborn from between the thighs of Nut in the mysteri es of Amenta, and here the visible birthpl ace of spirits perfected is localized in Sothis, the ope ner of the year and bringer of the babe to birth upon the hor izon or the mount of glory. In this way the skies of night were made lum inous with starry lore in the later eschatology when the mysteries were represented in Amenta. Instead of flashlight s show ing pictures on the hous etops of a city after dark, the stars were used by the Egypt ians to illustrate the mysteries that were out of sight . The triumph of Hor us ove r Sut or ove r the Apap dragon of drought and darkne ss was illustrated in the stellar mythos when in the annua l round Orion rose and the Scorpion cons tellation set upon the oppos ite hor izon. The Egypt ian nearing death coul d lie and look upon a future"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"figur ed in the starry heavens. As it was with Osiris or Horus so woul d it be with him. The way had been mappe d out , the guiding stars were visible. His bier or coffin of new birth coul d be seen in the mesken of the mother. He rose again in spirit as the ba be of Sothis. “He joined the com pany of the holy Sahus ” in Orion with the pilot Horus at the look - out of the bark. He saw the gol den isles in a heaven of perpetual peace to which the pol e was the eternal moor ing pos t. Whilst he was passing from this life t he bark of Ra was making ready for his soul to go on boa rd. The founda tion of Amenta itself has yet to be delineated. It is a 189 tangi ble threshol d to the other world, the secret but solid earth of eternity which was ope ned up by Ptah when he and his s even Knemmu erected the Tat pillar that was founde d in the winter solstice as the figur e of a stability that was to be eternal. In the mythos the Tat is a type of the sun in the winter solstice that has the pow er of returning from the low est depth and thus com pleting the eternal road. In the eschatology it is the god in person as Ptah - Sekeri or Osiris, the backbo ne and suppor t of the universe. Horus erecting the Tat in Sekhe m was raising Osiris from the sepul chre, the father re - erected as the son in the typ ical resurrection and cont inui ty of the hum an spirit in the after life. The figur e of Amsu - Horus rising in the resurrection or “com ing forth,” with member erect, has two characters, one in the mythology, one in the eschatology. In the mythol ogy he images t he pha llus of the sun and the generative force that fecunda tes the Mother - earth. In the eschatology the image of erection is repeated as a sym bol of resurrection, and in this pha se the suppos ed pha llic god, the figure of regenerative force, is typi cal of t he resurrection or re - erection of the mortal in spirit. Horus the child with finge r to mout h is por trayed in the sign of the Scales at the autum n equi nox , the poi nt at which the sun begins to lessen and becom e impot ent. This the Egypt ians termed the “litt le sun, ” which when personi fied was infant Horus, who sank dow n into Hades as the suffering sun to die in the winter solstice and be transformed to rise again and return in all his glory and pow er in the equi nox of Easter. This was matter of the solar myth os, also of life in vegetation and in the water of the inunda tion. In the eschatology Horus the child is typical of the hum an soul which was incarnated in the blood of Isis, the immaculate virgin, to be made flesh and to be bor n in mortal gui se on earth as the son of Seb, and to suffer all the afflictions of mortality. He descende d to Amenta as the soul sinki ng in the dark of death, and as the soul he was transfigur ed, change d, and glorified, to rise again and becom e immortal as a spirit perfected according to the teachings in the eschatology. A brief list will show how certain zoot ype s that were founde d in the mythol ogi cal representation were cont inue d in the eschatology: — Type of power. Mythical. Eschatological.

He seeks to bar the way of the sun in the nether world. In the eschatology it is the hum an soul instead of the sun that has to struggle with the 190 oppos ing mons ter in making the passage of Amenta. The same scenery served, as alrea dy show n, to illustrate the mystery in a religious and spiritual pha se. Chapter 64 of the Ritual is know n to have been extant in the time of King Septi, of the first dyna sty, the Usaipha is of Manetho. That was ove r 6,000 years ago. It is a chapter from th e Book of Life “to be recited on com ing forth to day, that one may not be kept back on the path of the Tuat, whether on entering or in com ing forth; for taking all the forms which one desireth, and that the person may not die a second time.” If this chapte r be know n, the person is made trium pha nt on earth (as in the nether world), and he performeth all things which are done by the living. The chapter was then so ancient that it had been lost sight of, and was discove red “on a plinth of the god of the Hennu (or Sekru) bark, by a master bui lder in the time of King Septi the Victorious .” When this chapter was com pos ed the primary nature pow ers had been uni fied in the one god, who was represented as the lord of two faces, who “seeth by his ow n light ,” the “Lord of Resurrections , who com eth forth from the dus k, and whos e birth is from the Hous e of Death.” That is, as the solar god who was Atum on one hor izon and Horus on the other; hence the lord of two faces. The supr eme god thus described is the father in one ch aracter, the son in the other. The Manes speaking in the character of the son says of the father, “He is I, and I am he.” At that time the earth had been tunne lled by Ptah and his pigm y workers, and a spirit world created on the new terra firma in the eart h of eternity, ove r which the solar god effused his radiance night ly when he light ed up the Tuat with his inde scribable glories (ch. 15) . The “Lord of Resurrections ” as a solar god had then becom e the lord of resurrections as the generator of ever - living s oul s. Egypt ian theology , then, was based upon the mythol ogy which preceded it and suppl ied the moul d. So is it with the Hebrew and Christian theology. But here is the difference betwixt them. The mythol ogy remained extant in Egypt , so that the beginni ngs o f the theology coul d be know n and tested, and were know n to the mystery teachers, and the origins referred to for the pur pos e of verification. The com mentary which has been partially incorpor ated with the text of chapter 17 survives to show the developm ent of the theology from mythol ogy and the need of expl anations which cons tituted the gnos is or wisdom of the “mystery teachers of the secret word,” whereas the Hebrew and Christian theologi es have been accepted minus the necessary know ledge of the origins, t he means of appl ying the com parative method and checking false assum ptions . In Christianity the mysteries have been manuf actured out of mist, and it has been taken for granted that the mist was impenetrable and never to be seen through , whereas the mysteri es of the Ritual can be follow ed in the two pha ses of mythol ogy and eschatology. The main difference betwixt the mythos and the eschatology is that the one is represented in the earth of time, the"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"other in the earth of eternity. And if we take the doctrine of a resurrection from the dead, the soul that rose again at first, in mythol ogy , was a soul of the returning light , a soul of life in vegetation, or other of the 191 elemental pow ers; a soul in external nature. For instance, a soul of life, as sour ce o f drink, was appr ehende d in the element of water, seen also in the plant and figur ed in the fish. The supe rhum an type was divinized in Horus. A soul of life, as sour ce of breath, was appr ehende d in the breeze, and imaged as the panting of a lion. The supe r hum an type was divinized in Shu. A soul of food was appr ehende d in the earth, and represented by the goos e that laid the egg. The supe rhum an type was divinized in Seb. In the Masoni c and all other know n mysteries, ancient or mode rn, the initiate has his e yes banda ged so that he may enter the reception room blindf old. This figur e, in the Egypt ian mysteries, is Horus in the dark, som etimes called the blind Horus, An - ar - ef. In the mythos Horus is the sun in the darkne ss of Amenta and the depths of the winter solstice. He is the prototype of “blind Orion hunge ring for the morn,” and of Samson “eyeless in Gaza.” The character was foun ded in the mythical representation of natural phe nom ena, and was afterwards cont inue d in the eschatology. The same type serves in the two categor ies of phe nom ena which are here distingui shed as the mythical and the eschatologi cal. In the latter the sight less Horus images the hum an soul in the darkne ss of death, where it is blind from lack of outer vision. This dua lity may serve to ex plain the twofold rende ring of the eyes. According to the hierogl yphi c imagery, Horus is without eyes or sight less in one character. He is also por trayed in anot her as the prince of sight , or of doubl e sight . This, according to the mythos , is a figur e of t he risen sun and of dawn upon the coffin - lid of Osiris in Amenta. In the eschatology it is Horus, lord of the two eyes, or doubl e vision – that is, of second sight – the seer in spirit with the beatific vision which was attained by him in death. The change fro m one character to the other is represented in the mysteries by the unba nda ging of the initiate’s eyes, which are intentiona lly dazzled by the glory of the light s. The Egypt ian Book of the Dead is the one sole record of this twofold basis of the mysteries. Enough has now been cited to show the method of the Ritual and the mode in which the eschatology of the Egypt ian religion was founde d in the moul d of the pre - extant mythol ogy. The Book of the Dead is the Egypt ian book of life. It is the pre - Christian wor d of God. This we learn from the account which it gives of itself. It is attribut ed to Ra as the inspiring hol y spirit. Ra was the father in heaven, who has the title of Huhi , the eternal, from which we derive the Hebrew name of Ihuh . The word was given by God the father to the ever - com ing son as manifestor for the father. This was Horus, who as the com ing son is Iu - sa or Iu - su, and, as the prince of peace, Iu - em - hetep. Horus the son is the Word in person. Hence the speaker in the character of Horus says, “ I utter his words – the words of Ra – to the men of the present generation, and I repeat his words to him who is deprived of breath” (ch. 38). That is, as Horus, the sayer or logos , who utters the words of Ra the father in heaven to the living on earth, and to the breathless Manes in Amenta when he descends into Hades or the later hell to preach to the spirits in prison. The word or the sayings thus originated with Ra the father in heaven. They were uttered by Horus the son,"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 192 and when written dow n in hiero glyphi cs by the fingers of Taht - Aan for hum an gui dance they suppl ied a basis for the Book of the Dead. It had been ordained by Ra that his words, such as thos e that bring about “the resurrection and the glory” (Rit., ch. 1), shoul d be written dow n by the d ivine scribe Taht - Aan, to make the word truth, and to effect the trium ph of Osiris against his adve rsaries; and it is proclaimed in the ope ning chapter that this manda te has been obe yed by Taht. The Ritual pur por ts to cont ain the gnos is of salvation from t he second death, toge ther with the ways and means of attaining eternal life, as these were acted in the drama of the Osirian mysteries. Hence the Osiris says that freedom from perdition can be assured by means of this book , in which he trusts and by which he steadfastly abides. The object of the words of pow er, the magical invoc ations , the fune ral ceremoni es, the purgatorial trials, is the resurrection of the mortal to the life which is everlasting. This ope ning chapter is described as the “words” which bri ng about the resurrection on the Mount of Glory, and the closing chapters show the deceased upon the sum mit of attainm ent. He has joined the lords of eternity in “the circle of Osiris,” and in the likeness of his ow n hum an self, the very “figure which he h ad on earth,” but change d and glorified (ch. 178) . Therefore the most exact and com prehensive title for the Book of the Dead now put toge ther in 186 chapters woul d be “The Ritual of the Resurrection. ” The books of the divine words written dow n by Taht are in the keeping of Horus the son, who is addr essed as “him who sees the father.” The Manes com es to him with his copy of the writings , by means of which he prevails on his journey through Amenta, like Pilgrim with his roll. He exclaims: “O thou great seer w ho behol dest his father! O keeper of the books of Taht! Here am I glorified and filled with soul and pow er, and provi ded with the writings of Taht,” the secrets of which are divine for light ening the darkne ss of the nether earth (Rit., ch. 94) . With these the Manes is accout red and equi ppe d. The Word of god personi fied in Horus preceded the written word of god and when the words of pow er were written dow n by Taht the scribe of truth, they were assigne d to Horus as the logi a of the Lord, and preserved as the precious records of him who was the word in person; first the word of pow er as the founde r, then the word in truth or made truth, as the fulfiller. The divine words when written cons tituted the scriptures, earliest of which are thos e ascribed to Hermes or Taht, the reput ed author of all the sacred writings . And now we find that both the word in person and the written word, toge ther with the doc trine of the word according to the ancient wisdom , are more or less extant and living still in the Egypt ian Book o f the Dead. The magical words of pow er when written dow n by Taht became the nuc leus of the Ritual, which is late in com parison with the astronom ical mythol ogy and other forms of Sign - langua ge, and belongs mainly to the Osirian religion. The mystical word of pow er from the first was female. Apt at Ombos was worshippe d as “the Living Word.” The supr eme type of this pow er bor ne upon the head of Shu is the hinde r part of a lione ss, her sign of sexua l pot ency. The thigh or khe psh of Apt is also the typi cal Ur - h eka, and it is a sym bol of the great magical 193 "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"pow er. The Ur - heka or magical sign preceded words, and words preceded the writings . Great magical words of pow er are ascribed to Isis, whos e word of pow er in the hum an sphe re was personi fied in Horus the c hild, her word that issued out of silence. This is the word that was made flesh in a mortal likeness, the soul derived from blood . Child - Horus, how ever, manifests in divers phe nom ena as the Word - of - Pow er emaned by Isis, in the water, in vegetation, in food , and lastly in the virgin mother’s blood . The first Horus was the Word - of - Pow er, the second is the Word - made - Truth in Horus, Ma, t - Kheru, by doi ng it. Horus the Word - of - Pow er was the founde r, who was follow ed by Horus the Fulfiller. This title doe s not me rely mean the Word of Truth, the True Logos (Celsus), or the True Voice (Plutarch), but denot es the Word - made - Truth or Law by Horus the Victorious , the father’s ow n anoi nted son, who fulfilled the Word of Pow er. It is Horus the Word - of - Pow er persona lized a s a little child who survives as the miraculous worker two or three years old in the apoc rypha l gos pels. He is credited with doi ng these infantine marvels as the Word - of - Pow er in person. He also utters the word of pow er in performing his amazing miracles. The magical words were orally com muni cated in the mysteries from mout h to ear, not written to be read. They were to be got ten by heart. In the Book of the Dead memory is restored to the deceased through the words of pow er that were stored up in life to be remembered in death. The speaker in chapter 90 says: “O thou who restorest memory in the mout h of the dead through the words of pow er which I pos sess.” That is, by virtue of the gnos is, memory was restored by the deceased remembering the divine words. Now , Plato taught that a know ledge of past lives in a hum an pre - existence was restored to persons in this life by means of memory. The origin of the doc trine is undoubt edly Egypt ian, but it was made out by a perversion of the original teaching. This restorati on of or through memory occurs to the Manes in Amenta after death, and the things remembered appe rtain to the past life on earth. Plato has misappl ied it to the past lives and pre - existence of hum an beings dw elling on the earth. The words of pow er were not onl y spoke n. They were likewise represented in the equi pm ent of the mum my, som etimes called its ornaments, such as the word of salvation by the blood of Isis with the red Tet - buc kle, the word of dur ability by the white stone , the word of resurrection by t he scarabæ us, the word of eternal life by the cross, called the ankh. These were forms of the magical words expr essed in fetish figur es. The Manes in Amenta begins his cour se where he left off on earth when his mout h was closed in death; it is ope ned onc e more for him by Ptah and Tum , and Taht suppl ies him with the great magical words of pow er that ope n every gate. These were written on the roll of papyr us that is carried in his hand by the pilgrim who makes his progr ess through the nether regions in the s ubt erranean pathw ay of the sun. The so - called Book of the Dead, then, here quot ed as the Ritual for the sake of brevity, is the Egypt ian book of life: life now , life hereafter, everlasting life. It was inde ed the book of life and salvation, because it cont ained the things to be don e in the life here 194 and hereafter to ensure eternal cont inuity (Rit., ch. 15, hym n 3). The departing soul when passing away in death, or, as the truer phr ase is, when setting into the land of life, clasps and clings to his ro ll for very life. As the book of life, or word of salvation, it was bur ied"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"in the coffin with the dead when done with on earth. It show ed the way to heaven obj ectively as well as subj ectively, as heaven was mappe d out in the astral mythos . The Manes enters Amenta with a papyr us roll in his hand correspondi ng to the one that was bur ied in his coffin. This cont ains the written word of truth, the word of magical pow er, the word of life. The great que stion now for him is how far he has made the word of god (Osi ris) truth and established it against the pow ers of evil in his lifetime on the earth. The word that he carries with him was written by Taht - Aan, the scribe of truth. Anot her word has been written in his lifetime by himself, and the record will meet him in the Hall of Justice on the day of weighi ng words, when Taht will read the record of the life to see how far it tallies with the written word and how far he has fulfilled the word in truth to earn eternal life. The sense of sin and abhor rence of injustice must have been peculiarly keen when it was taught that every word as well as deed was weighe d in the balance of truth on the day of reckoni ng, called the Judgm ent Day. The questions conf ront ing the Manes on entering Amenta are whether he has laid sufficien t hol d of life to live again in death? Has he acqui red cons istency and strengt h or truth of character enough to persist in som e other more permanent form of persona lity? Has he sufficient force to incorporate his soul anew and germinate and grow and bur st the mum my banda ges in the glorified body of the Sahu? Is he a true mum my? Is the backbone sound? Is his heart in the right place? Has he planted for eternity in the seed - field of time? Has he made the word of Osiris, the word that was written in the papyr u s roll, truth against his enemies? The chapters for ope ning the Tuat, for dealing with the adve rsary in the nether world, for issuing forth victorious ly and thus winni ng the crow n of trium ph, for removi ng displeasure from the heart of the judge , tend to s how the ways of attaining the life everlasting by acqui ring pos session of an eternal soul . The Manes is said to be made safe for the place of rebirth in Annu by means of the books of Taht’s divine words, which cont ain the gnos is or know ledge of the things to be done on earth and in Amenta. The truth is made know n by the words of Horus which were written dow n by Taht in the Ritual, but the fulfilment depends on the Manes making the word truth by doi ng it. That is the onl y way of salvation or of safety for th e soul , the onl y mode of becom ing a true being who woul d endu re as pur e spirit for ever. The Egypt ians had no vicarious atone ment, no imput ed righteous ness, no second - hand salvation. No initiate in the Osirian mysteries coul d pos sibly have rested his hope of reaching heaven on the Galilean line to glory. His was the more crucial way of Amenta, which the Manes had to treat with the gui dance of the word, that step by step and act by act he must himself make true. It is said in the rubrical directions of chapt er 72 that the Manes who kne w it on earth and had it written on his coffin will be able to go in and out by day unde r any form he choos es in which he can penetrate his dw elling - place and also make his way to the Aarru fields of peace and plenty, 195 wher e he will be flourishing for ever even as he was on earth (Rit., 72, 9, 11) . If chapter 91 is know n, the Manes takes the form of a fully - equi ppe d spirit (a Khu) in the nether world, and is not imprisone d at any door in Amenta either goi ng in or com ing out . Chapter 92 is the one that ope ns the tom b to the soul and to the shade of a person, that he may com e forth to day and have the mastery ove r his feet. The book of giving sustenance"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"to the spirit of the deceased in the unde r world delivers the person from a ll evil things (Rit., 148) . There was anot her book wherewith the spirits acqui red strengt h by know ing the names of the gods of the sout hern sky and of the nor thern sky (chs. 141 - 3). The Ritual was pre - eminently a book of know ledge or of wisdom , because it cont ained the gnos is of the mysteries. Know ledge was all - important. The Manes make their passage through Amenta by means of what they know . The deceased in one of his suppl ications says: “O thou ship of the garden Aarru, let me be conve yed to that bread of thy canal, as my father the great one who adva nceth in the divine ship, becaus e I know thee” (ch. 106 , Renouf ). He kne w because, as we see by ch. 99, he had learned the names of every part of the bark in which the spirits sailed. Know ledge was pow er, know ledge was the gnos is, and the gnos is was the science of the mystery teachers and the masters of Sign - langua ge. Ignor ance was most dire and deadly. How coul d one travel in the next world any more than in this withou t know ing the way? The way in Amenta was i ndi cated topogr aphi cally very much in keeping with the ways in Egypt , chief of which was the water - way of the great river. Directions , names, and passwords were furnished in writing, to be placed with the mum my of the deceased. Better still, if these instr uctions and divine teachings were learned by heart, had been enacted and the word made truth in the life, then the Book of the Dead in life became the book of life in death. The word was given that it might be made truth by doi ng it as the means of learni ng the way by know ing the word. The way of life in three worlds, thos e of earth, Amenta, and heaven, was by know ing the word of god and making it true in defiance of all the pow ers of evil. According to this earlier Bible, death came into the world by igno rance, not by know ledge , as in the Christian travesty of the Egypt ian teaching. As Hermes says: “The wickedne ss of a soul is ignor ance. The virtue of a soul is know ledge ” (Divine Pym ande r, B. IV, 27, 28) . There was no life for the soul except in know ing, a nd no salvation but in doi ng, the truth. The hum an soul of Neferube n in the picture is the wise or instructed soul , one of the Khu - Akaru: he is a master of the gnos is, a know er or know ing soul , and therefore not to be caught like an igno rant fish in the ne t. Know ledge is of the first impor tance. In all his jour neyings and difficulties it is necessary for the deceased to know . It is by know ledge that he is light ed to find his way in the dark. Know ledge is his lamp of light and his com pass; to pos sess know led ge is to be master of divine pow ers and magical words. Ignor ance woul d leave him a prey to all sorts of liers in wait and cunni ng enemies. He trium phs cont inua lly through his know ledge of the way, like a traveller with his chart and previous acqua intancesh ip with the local langua ge; hence the need of the gnos is of initiation in the mysteries. Thos e who kne w the real name of the god were in pos session of the word 196 that represented pow er ove r the divinity, therefore the word of pow er that woul d be effica cious if employe d. Instead of calling on the name of god in prayer, they made use of the name as the word of god. And as these words and mysteries of magic were cont ained in the writings , it was necessary to know the writings in which the gnos is was religi ous ly preserved to be in pos session of the words of pow er. Hence the phr ases of great magical efficacy in the Ritual are called “the words that com pel.” They com pel the favour able action of the supe rhum an pow er to which appe al is made. To make magic was to act the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"appe al in a langua ge of signs which, like the words, were also intende d to com pel, and to act thus magically was a mode of com pelling, forcing, and binding the supe rhum an pow ers. Magic was also a mode of cove nanting with the pow er appr ehende d in t he elements. The qui d pro quo being blood, this was a most primitive form of blood - cove nant. Giving blood for food was giving life for the means of living. The Ritual ope ns with a resurrection, but this is the resurrection in the earth of Amenta, not in t he heaven of eternity. It is the resurrection of a body - soul emerging in the similitude of the moon - god from the dark of death. The first words of the Ritual are, “O Bull of Amenta [Osiris], it is Taht, the everlasting king, who is here!” He has com e as on e of the pow ers that fight to secure the trium ph of Osiris ove r all his adve rsaries. After the life on earth there was a resurrection in Amenta, the earth of eternity, for the hum an soul evol ved on earth. It was there that the claim to the resurrection in spirit and to life eternal in heaven had to be made good and established by long and painful expe riences and many kinds of purgatorial purification, by which the soul was perfected eventually as an ever - living spirit. The word of prom ise had to be performe d and made truth inde ed, for the Ma - Kheru of immortality to be earned and endl ess cont inui ty of life assured. Everyone who died was in pos session of a body - soul that passed into Amenta to becom e an Osiris or an image of the god in matter, although it was n ot every one who was rebor n or regenerated in the likeness of Ra, to attain the Horushood, which was por trayed as the hood of the divine hawk. Emergence in Amenta was the com ing forth of the hum an soul from the coffin and from the gloom of the grave in som e form of persona lity such as is depicted in the Shade, or the Ba, a bird of soul with the hum an head, which show s that a hum an soul is signi fied. Osiris the god of Amenta in a mum my form is thus addr essed by the Osiris N. or Manes: “O breathless one , let me live and be saved after death” (ch. 41) . This is addr essed to Osiris who lives eternally. Though lying as a mum my in Amenta, breathless and without motion, he will be self - resuscitated to rise again. Salvation is renewal for anot her life; to be saved is not to suffer the second death, not to die a second time. According to Egypt ian thought , the saved are the living and the twice dead are the damned. Life after death is salvation of the soul , and thos e not saved are thos e who die the second death — a fate t hat coul d not be escaped by any false belief in the merits of Horus or the efficacy of the atoni ng blood. There was no heaven to be secured for them by proxy. The Ritual is not a book of beautiful sentiments, like the poe tic literature of later times. It is a record of the things done by the 197 dram atis person æ in the Kamite mysteries. But now and again the beauty of feeling breaks out ineffably upon the face of it, as in the chapter by which the deceased prevails ove r his adve rsaries, the pow ers of dar kne ss, and com es forth to the day, saying, “O thou who shinest forth from the moon , thou that givest light from the moon, let me com e forth at large amid thy train, and be revealed as one of thos e in glory. Let the Tuat be ope ned for me. Here am I.” The sp eaker is in Amenta as a mum my soul appe aling to the father of light s and lord of spirits that he may com e forth in the character of Horus divinized to delight the soul of his poo r mother. He wishes to capitalize the desires of thos e who “make salutations ” to the gods on his behalf. These in mode rn parlance woul d be the"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"prayers of the priests and congr egation (ch. 3) for his welfare and safety in the future life, otherwise for his salvation. In the chapter by which one com eth forth to day he pleads: “Let me have pos session of all things soever which were offered ritualistically for me in the nether world. Let me have pos session of the table of offerings which was heapt for me on earth — the solicitations which0w ere uttered for me, ‘that he may feed upon the bre ad of Seb,’ or the food of earth. Let me have possession of my fune ral meals,” the meals offered on earth for the dead in the fune rary chamber (ch. 68) . The chief obj ect of the deceased on entering Amenta is the mode and means of getting out again as soon as pos sible upo n the other side. His one all - absorbing interest is the resurrection to eternal life. He says, “Let me reach the land of ages, let me gain the land of eternity, for thou, my Lord, hast destined them for me” (ch. 13) . Osiris or the Osiris pa ssed into Amenta as the lord of transformations . Various change s of shape were necessitated by the various mode s of progr ession. As a beetle or a serpent he passed through solid earth, as a crocodi le through the water, as a hawk through the air. As a jacka l or a cat he saw in the dark; as an ibis he was the know ing one , or “he of the nos e.” Thus he was the master of transformations , the magician of the later folk - tales, who coul d change his shape at will. Taht is termed the great magician as the lord of tra nsformations in the moon . Thus the deceased in assum ing the type of Taht becom es a master of transformation or the magician whos e transformations had also been made on earth by the transformers in trance who poi nted the way to transformation in death. When Teta com es to cons cious ness on rising again in Amenta he is said to have broke n his sleep for ever which was in the dw elling of Seb — that is, on the earth. He has now received his Sahu or inve stiture of the glorious body. Before the mortal Manes coul d att ain the ultimate state of spirit in the image of Horus the immortal, he must be put toge ther part by part as was Osiris, the dismembered god. He is divinized in the likeness of various divinities, all of whom had been include d as pow ers in the person of th e one true god, Neb - er - ter, the lord entire. Every member and part of the Manes in Amenta has to be fashione d afresh in a new creation. The new heart is said to be shaped by certain gods in the nether world, according to the deeds done in the body whilst t he person was living on the earth. He assum es the 198 glorified body that is formed feature by feature and limb after limb in the likeness of the gods unt il there is no part of the Manes that remains undi vinized. He is given the hair of Nu, or heaven, th e eyes of Hathor , ears of Apua t, nose of Khenti - Kâs, lips of Anup , teeth of Serk, neck of Isis, hands of the might y lord of Tattu, shoul ders of Neith, back of Sut, pha llus of Osiris, legs and thighs of Nut, feet of Ptah, with nails and bone s of the living Uræi, unt il there is not a limb of him that is withou t a god. There is no pos sibility of com ing back to earth for a new body or for a re - entry into the old mum my. As the Manes says, his “soul is not bound to his old body at the gates of Amenta” (ch. 26, 6) . Chapter 89 is designa ted the chapter by which the soul is united to the body. This, how ever, doe s not mean the dead body on earth, but the format or bodi ly type of the mum my in Amenta. “Here I com e,” says the speaker, “that I may ove rthrow mine adve rsari es upon the earth, though my dead body be bur ied” (ch. 86, Renouf ). “Let me com e forth to day, and walk"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"upon my ow n legs. Let me have the feet of the glorified” (ch. 86) . At this stage he exclaims, “I am a soul , and my soul is divine. It is the eternal for ce.” In chapters 21 and 22 the Manes asks for his mout h, that he may speak with it. Having his mout h restored, he asks that it may be ope ned by Ptah, and that Taht may loos en the fetters or muzzles of Sut, the pow er of darkne ss (ch. 23) . In shor t, that he may recove r the faculty of speech. In the process of transforming and being renewed as the new man, the second Atum , he says, “I am Khepera, the self - produc ed upon his mother’s thigh. ” Khepera is the beetle - type of the sun that is portrayed in pictures of the godde ss Nut proceeding from the mother’s khe psh. The name of the beetle signi fies becom ing and evol ving, hence it is a type of the becom er in making his transformation. The mout h being given, words of pow er are brough t to him, he also gathers them from every qua rter. Then he remembers his name. Next the new heart is given to him. His jaws are parted, his eyes are ope ned. Pow er is given to his arms and vigour to his legs. He is in pos session of his heart, his mout h, his eyes, his limbs, and his speech. H e is now a new man reincorpor ated in the body of a Sahu, with a soul that is no longe r bound to the Khat or dead mum my at the gates of Amenta (ch. 26) . He looks forward to being fed upon the food of Osiris in Aarru, on the eastern side of the mead of amara nthine flowers. In one pha se of the drama the deceased is put toge ther bone by bone in corresponde nce to the backbone of Osiris. The backbone was an emblem of sustaining pow er, and this recons truction of the deceased is in the likeness of the mutilated go d. The speaker at this poi nt says, “The four fastenings of the hinde r part of my head are made firm.” He doe s not fall at the block. There are of cour se seven cervical vertebræ in the backbone altoge ther, but three of these are peculiar, “the atlas which s uppor ts the head, the axis upon which the head turns, and the vertebræ prom inens, with its long spiral process” (ch. 30, Renouf ). No doubt the Osiris was rebui lt upon this mode l, and the four joints were funda mental, they cons tituted a four fold founda tion. In anot her passage the Osiris is appa rently perfected “upon the squa re,” as in the Masoni c mysteries. It is the 199 chapter by which one assum es the form of Ptah, the great architect of the uni verse. The speaker says, “He is four times the arm’s lengt h of Ra, four times the width of the world” (Rit., ch. 82, Renouf ), which is a mode of describing the four qua rters or four sides of the earth, as represented by the Egyp tians. There were seven primary pow ers in the mythical and astronom ical pha ses, six of w hom are represented by zoot ype s, and the seventh is imaged in the likeness of a man. This is repeated in the eschatology, where the highe st soul of seven is the Ka - eid ō l on with a hum an face and figur e as the final type of spirit which was hum an on the earth and is to be eternal in the heavens. The Manes who is being recons tituted says, “The [seven] Uræus divinities are my body . . . . My image is eternal” (ch. 85), as it woul d be when the seven soul s were amalgamated into one that was imaged by the divine Ka. The seven Uræus divinities represented the seven soul s of life that were anterior to the one endur ing soul . In the chapter of propi tiating one ’s ow n Ka the Manes say s, “Hail to thee, my Ka! May I com e to thee and be glorified and made manifest and ensoul ed?” (ch. 103) — that is, in attaining the highe st of the soul s, the uni fying one . These soul s may be conc eived as seven ascendi ng type s of persona lity. The first is fig ured as the shade, the dark soul or shade of the Inoi ts, the Greenlande rs, and"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"other abor iginal races, which is portrayed persona lly in the Ritual lying darkly on the ground. The shade was primary, because of its being, as it were, a shadow of the old body projected on the ground in the new life. It is por trayed as a black figure stretched out in Amenta. In this way the earth shadow of the body in life served as the type of a soul that passed out of the body in death. This may expl ain the intimate relations hip of the shade to the phys ical mum my, which it is som etimes said to cling to and remain with in the tomb, and to draw sustenance from the corpse so long as it exists. Thus the shade that draws life from the dead body becom es the mythical prototype of the vampire and the legenda ry ghoul . It may be difficult to determine exactly what the Egypt ians unde rstood by the kha bit or shade in its genesis as a soul , but the Inoi t or Aleutians describe it as “a vapour emanating from the blood” ; and here is wisdom for thos e who com prehend it. The earliest hum an soul , derived from the mother when the blood was looke d upon as the life, was a soul of blood , and the Inoi t description answers perfectly to the shade in the Egypt ian Amenta. Amongs t the most primitive races the typi cal basis of a future persona lity is the shade. The Aleutians say the soul at its departure divides into the shade and the spirit. The first dw ells in the tom b, the other ascends to the firmament. These, wherever met with, are equi valent to the twin - s oul s of Sut the dark one , and Horus the soul of light . For we reckon the Egypt ian seven to be earliest and old enough to account for and expl ain the rest which are to be found dispersed about the world. The soul as shade or shadow is know n to the Macusi In dians as the “man in the eyes,” who “doe s not die.” This is anot her form of the shadow that was not cast upon the ground. Dr. Birch drew attention to the fact that whilst the deceased has but one Ba, one Sahu, and one Ka, he has two shades, his Khabti bein g in the plural ( Trans . Soc iety of Bib. Arch., vol . VIII, p. 391) . These two correspond to the dark and light shades 200 of the abor igines. They also conf orm to the two souls of darkne ss and light that were imaged by the black vul ture and the gol den hawk of Sut and Horus, the first two of the total septenary of pow ers or soul s. The shade, how ever, is but one - seventh of the series. The other self when perfected cons ists of seven amalgamated soul s. Som e of the Manes in Amenta do not get beyond the state of the shade or Khabit; they are arrested in this condi tion of mum mied immobi lity. They do not acqui re the new heart or soul of breath; they remain in the egg unha tched, and do not becom e the Ba - soul or the glorified Khu. These are the soul s that are said to be eaten by certain of the gods or infernal pow ers. “Eater of the shades” is the title of the four th of the forty - two executione rs (ch. 125 ). The tenth of the mystical abode s in Amenta is the place of the mons trous arms that capture and carry away the Mane s who have not attained a condi tion beyond that of the shade or empty shell. The “shells” of the theosophi sts may be met with in the Ritual. The Manes who is fortified with his divine soul can pass this place in safety. He says, “Let no one take pos session of my shade [let no one take pos session of my shell or enve lope ]. I am the divine hawk.” He has issued from the shell of the egg and been established beyond the status of the shade as a Ba - soul . With this may be com pared the supe rstition that in eating eg gs one shoul d always break up the empty shell, lest it shoul d be made evil use of by the witches. There are wretched shades conde mned to immobi lity in the fifth of the mystical abode s. They suffer their final arrest in that place and pos ition, and are then"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"devour ed by the giants who live as eaters of the shades. These mons ters are described as having thigh - bone s seven cubi ts long (ch. 149 , 18, 19) . No mere shade has pow er enough to pass by these personi fications of devour ing might; they are the ogr es of leg enda ry lore, who may be found at home with the ghoul and the vampire in the dark caverns of the Egypt ian unde r world. These were the dead whos e developm ent in spirit world was arrested at the status of the shade, and who were suppos ed to seek the life they lacked by haunt ing and preying upon hum an soul s, particularly on the soul of blood. In its next stage the soul is called a Ba, and is represented as a hawk with a human head, to show that the nature of the soul is hum an still. This is more than a soul of shade, but it was not imagined nor believed that the human soul as such inha bited the body of a bird. In one of the hells the shades are seen bur ning, but these were able to resist the fire, and it is cons eque ntly said, “The shades live; they hav e raised t heir pow ers.” They are raised in status by assimilating highe r pow ers. Follow ing his taking pos session of the soul of shade and the soul of light the Osiris is given a new heart, his whol e or twofold heart. With som e of the primitive folk, as with the Bas utos, it is the heart that goe s out in death as the soul that never dies. Boba dilla learned from the Indi ans of Nicaragua that there are two different hearts; that one of these went away with the deceased in death, and that it was the heart that went away which “made them live” hereafter. This other breathing heart, the basis of the future being, is one with the Egypt ian heart by which the recons tituted person lives again. The heart that was weighe d in the Hall of Judgm ent could not have been 201 the orga n of life on earth. This was a second heart, the heart of anot her life. The Manes makes appe al for this heart not to bear evidence against him in presence of the god who is at the balance (chs. 30 A and 30 B ). The second is the heart that was fashione d anew according to the life lived in the body. It is said to be the heart of the great god Tehut i, who persona ted intelligence. Hence it is said to be young and keen of insight among the gods , or among the seven soul s. The phys ical representation com es first, bu t it is said in the text of Panchemisis, “The cons cience or heart (Ab) of a man is his ow n god” or divine judge . The new heart represents rebirth, and is therefore called the mother (ch. 30 A ); and when the deceased recove rs the basis of future being in his whol e heart he says, although he is bur ied in the deep, deep grave, and bow ed down to the region of anni hilation, he is glorified (even) there (ch. 30 A , Renouf ). Now if we take the shade to image a soul of blood , the Ba - hawk to image a soul of light , and the hati - heart to represent a soul of breath, we can perceive a raison d’être for the offering of blood , of light s, and of incense as sacrifices to the Manes in three different pha ses or states. Blood was generally offered to the shades, as we see in surv ival among the Greeks and Rom ans. The shade was in the first stage of the past existence, and most needing in Amenta the blood which was the life on earth and held to be of first necessity for the revivifying of the dead as Manes or shades. The Sekhe m was one of the soul s or pow ers. It is difficult to identify this with a type and place in the seven. Pro tem. we call it four th of the series. It is more impor tant to know what force it represents. The name is derived from the word khe m, for pot ency. Khem in p hys ics signi fies erectile pow er. The man of thirty years as typi cal adul t is khe mt. Sekhe m"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"denot es having the pow er or pot ency of the erectile force. In the eschatologi cal pha se it is the reproduc ing, formative pow er of Khem, or Amsu, to re - erect, the pow e r of erection being appl ied to the spirit in fashioni ng and vitalizing the new and glorious body for the future resurrection from Amenta. The Khu is a soul in which the person has attained the status of the pur e in spirit called the glorified, represented in the likeness of a beautiful white bird; the Ka is a type of eternal duration in which the sevenfold persona lity is uni fied at last for permanent or everlasting life. It is the Khu that is thus addr essed in the tom b as the glorified one : “Thou shalt not be imprisone d by thos e who are attached to the person of Osiris [that is, the mum my], and who have custody of soul s and spirits, and who shut up the shades of the dead. It is heaven onl y that shall hol d thee.” (Rit., ch. 92. ) The shade of itself coul d nev er leave the tom b. For this reason it was com monl y held that the shade remained with the corpse or mum my on the earth. But here the tom b, the mum my, and the shade are not on earth; they are in Amenta. Without the Ba - soul , the shade remains unvi vified. With out the Sekhe m, it lacks essential form or pow er of re - arising. Without the Khu - spirit the person doe s not ascend from the sepul chre or prison - hous e of the nether world. But when this has been attained the deceased is glorified. If chapter 91 is know n, “he taketh the form of a fully - equi ppe d Khu [spirit] in the nether 202 world, and doe s not suffer imprisonm ent at any door in Amenta, either in com ing in or goi ng out ” (Renouf , ch. 91) . It is onl y when the Manes is inve sted as a Khu that he ascends to the f ather as a son of god . So we gather from the follow ing words addr essed to Horus by the person who is now a Khu: “O might y one , who seest thy father, and who hast charge of the books of Taht, here am I. I com e, and am glorified and filled with soul and pow e r, and am his light in the darkne ss of Amenta. He now ascends to Ra his father, who is in the bark, and exclaims again and again, “I am a pow erful Khu; let thy soundne ss be my soundne ss” (Renouf , ch. 105) . When the deceased has been made perfect as a Khu, he is free to enter the great hous e of seven halls (ch. 145 ). Likewise the “hous e of him who is upon the hill,” and who is “ruler in the divine hall.” The great hous e is the heaven of Osiris based upon the thirty - six gates or duo - decans of the zodi ac. The other is the hous e of Anup at the sum mit of the mount in Annu. “Behol d me,” he exclaims; “behol d me. I am com e to you , and have carried off and put toge ther my forms,” or cons tituent parts of the permanent soul , which were seven altoge ther. These are: (1) The Khabit or dark shade; (2) the Ba or light shade; (3) the breathing heart; (4) the Sekhe m; (5) the Sahu; (6) the Khu; (7) the Ka. When the Manes has becom e a Khu, the Ka is still a typi cal ideal ahead of him; so far ahead or aloof that he propi tiates it with offerings . In fact, he presents himself as the sacrificial victim that woul d die to attain conj unc tion with his Ka, his image of eternal dur ation, his type of totality, in which the seven soul s were permanently uni fied in one at last. The Ka has been called the doubl e of the dead, as if it simply represented the Doppe l - gange r. But it is not merely a pha ntom of the living or persona l image of the departed. It serves also for the appa rition or revenant ; it is a type rather than a portrait. It is a type that was pre - natal. It images a soul which came into existence with the child, a soul which is food and sustenance to the body all through life, a soul of existence here and of dur ation for the life hereafter. Hence it is"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"absorbed at last in the perfected persona lity. It is depicted in the Temple of Luxo r, where the birth of Amenhe tep III, is por trayed as com ing from the hand of god. The Ka of the roya l infant is show n in the pictures being formed by Khnum the moul der on the pot ter’s wheel. It is in attenda nce on the person all life through, as the genius or gua rdian ange l, and the fulfilment of the persona lity is effected by a final reuni on with the Ka. As already show n, when divine honou rs were paid to the Pharaoh the offerings were made to his Ka, not to his mortal self. Thus the Manes in Amenta makes an offering of incense to pur ify himself in propi tiation of his Ka (ch. 105) . There is a chapter of “provi ding food for the Ka.” Also the mortuary meal was eaten in the chamber of the Ka, the resurrection cha mber of the sepul chre. Food was offered to the Ka - eid ō l on as the representative of the departed, instead of directly to the spirits of the ancestors. It was set up there as receiver - general of the offerings . Also the food was presented to it as a type of the divine food which sustained the hum an soul . Thus , when the divine sustenance is offered by the god or godde ss to the soul of the mortal on the 203 earth, or to the Manes in Amenta, it is presented by the giver to the Ka. Certain priests were appoi nted to be ministers to the Ka, and these made the offerings to the Ka of the deceased on behalf of the living relatives. This is because the Ka was the type of persona lity, seventh of the seven soul s attained as the highe st in which the others were to be include d and absorbed. In the vigne ttes to chapter 25 of the Ritual (Naville, Todt ., Kap. 25, vol . I, p. 36) the deceased is show n his Ka, which is with him in the passage of Amenta, not left behind him in the tom b, that he may not forget himself (as we might say), or, as he says, that he may not suffer lo ss of identity by forgetting his nam e. Show ing the Ka to him enables the Manes to recall his name in the great hous e, and especially in the crucible of the hous e of flame. When the deceased is far adva nced on his jour ney through Amenta, his Ka is still acc om panyi ng him, and it is described as being the food of his life in spirit world, even as it had been his spiritual food in the hum an life. “Thou art com e, Osiris; thy Ka is with thee. Thou feedest thys elf unde r thy name of Ka” (128, 6). When the Osiris ha s passed from the state of shade to the stage of the Ka, he will becom e what the Ritual designa tes a fully equippe d Manes who has com pleted his inve stiture. As a Sahu he was reincorporated in a spiritual body . As a Khu he was inve sted with a robe of glory. As a sacred hawk with the head of a Bennu he was endow ed with the soul of Horus (ch. 78) . It was here he exclaimed “Behol d me; I am com e to you [the gods and the glorified], and have carried off my forms and uni ted them.” But in chapter 92 he was anxi ous l y looki ng forward to the day of reckoni ng, when he said, “Let the way be ope n to my soul and my shade, that I may see the great god within his sanctuary on the day of the soul ’s reckoni ng, ” “when all hearts and words are weighe d.” He is not yet one of the spirits made perfect, being neither judge d nor justified. He has to pass his last examination, and is now approaching the great hall of judgm ent for his trial. He says, “I am com e that I may secure my suit in Abydos ,” the mythical re - birthpl ace of Osiris. This is the final trial of the long series through which he has hitherto successfully passed (Rit., ch. 117, Renouf ). He has now arrived at the judgm ent hall. It has been asserted that the deeds which the deceased had done here on earth in no wise influenc ed the fate that awaited the man after death (Maspero, Egyptian Archæ ology ,"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Eng. tr., p. 149 ). But how so, when the new heart which was given to the deceased in Amenta, where he or she was recons tituted, is said to be fashione d in accordanc e with what he h as done in his hum an life? And the speaker pleads that his new heart may not be fashione d according to all the evil things that may be said agai nst him (Rit., ch. 27) . He is anxi ous that the ministrants of Osiris in the Neter - Kar, “who deal with a man acco rding to the cour se of his life,” may not give a bad odour to his name (ch. 30 B ). And again he pleads, “Let me be glorified through my attribut es; let me be estimated according to my merits” (ch. 72). It is plainly appa rent that the future fate of the soul was depende nt on the deeds that were done in the body , and the character of the deceased was accreted according to his conduc t in the life on earth. The jury sitting in the judgm ent hall cons isted of forty - two masters of truth. Their dut y was to discove r the truth with fierce interro - 204 gation and the instinct of sleuth - hounds on their track. Was this Manes a true man? Had he lived a true life? Was he true at heart when this was tested in the scales? His viscera were present for inspection, and these keen scrutinizers in their animal - headed forms were very terrible, not onl y in visage, for they had a vested interest in securing a verdict of gui lty against the Manes, inasmuch as the viscera of the conde mned were flung to them as perqui sites and prey, th erefore they searched with the zeal of hunge r for the evidence of evil living that might be found written on this record of the inne r man. Piecemeal the Manes were examined, to be passed if true, to be sent back if not , in the shape of swine or goa ts or ot her Typhoni an animals, and driven dow n into the fiery lake of out er darkne ss where Baba the devour er of hearts, the Egypt ian “raw - head - and - bloody - bone s,” was lying in wait for them. The highe st verdict rende red by the great judge in this most awful Judgm en t Hall was a testimony to the truth and pur ity of character established for the Manes on evidence that was uni mpeachable. At this pos t - mortem the sins done in the body through violating the law of nature were probe d for most profoundl y. Not onl y was the de ceased present in spirit to be judge d at the dread tribuna l, the book of the body was ope ned and its record read. The vital organs, such as the heart, liver, and lungs , were brought into judg ment as witnesses to the life lived on earth. Any part too vitiat ed for the rottenne ss to be cut off or scraped away was conde mned and flung as offal to the pow ers who are called the eaters of filth, the devour ers of hearts, and drinke rs of the blood of the wicked. And if the heart, for example, shoul d be conde mned to b e devour ed because very bad, the indi vidua l coul d not be recons tructed for a future life. In order that the Osiris may pass the Great Assize as one of the justified, he must have made the word of Osiris truth on earth against his enemies. He must have liv ed a right eous life and been just, truthful, merciful, charitable, hum ane. In com ing to the Hall of Judgm ent or Justice to look on the divine count enance and be cleansed from all the sins he may have com mitted he says, “I have com e to thee, O my Lord. I kn ow thee. Lord of Right eous ness is thy name. I bring to thee right . I have put a stop to wrong .” His plea is that he has done his best to fulfil the character of Horus - Makhe ru. Som e of his pleas are very touc hing. “He has not exacted from the labour er, as t he first - fruits of each day, more work than was justly due to him. He has not snatched the milk from the"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"mout hs of babes and sucklings . He has not been a land - grabbe r. He has not damned the runni ng water. He has caused no famine, no weeping, no suffering t o men, and has not been a robbe r of food. He has not tampered with the tongue of the balance, nor been fraudul ent, mean, or sordid of soul . There is a goo dly list of pre - Christian virtues besides all the theoretical Christian one s. Amongs t others, he says, “I have propi tiated the god with that which he love th.” This was especially by the offering of Maat , viz., justice, truth, and right eous ness. “I have given bread to the hungr y, water to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, and a boa t to the shipw recked” (ch . 125 ). Yet we have been told that charity and mercy were totally unknow n to the pagan world. He asks the forty - two assessors for the great 205 judge not to go against him, for he did the right thing in Tamerit, the land of Egypt . His heart is weighe d in the scales of justice. He passes pur e, as one of thos e who are welcom ed by Horus for his ow n faithful follow ers, the blessed of his father, to whom it is said, “Com e, com e in peace.” Horus the intercessor, advoc ate, or paraclete, now takes him by the hand and leads him into the presence of Osiris in the sanctuary. The Manes in the Judgm ent Hall is black - haired, as seen in the pictures of Ani (Papyr us of Ani, pl. 4). But when he kne els before Osiris on the throne his hair is white. He has passed as one of t he pur ified and is on his way to join the ranks of the just spirits made perfect, who are called the glorified. The attenda nts say to him, “We put an end to thy ills and we remove that which is disorderly in thee through thy being smitten to the earth” in death. These were the ills of mortality from which he has now been freed in spirit. Here occurs the resurrection of the Osiris in the person of Horus, and it is said, “Ha, Osiris! thou hast com e, and thy Ka with thee, which uni teth with thee in thy name of Ka - hetep” (ch. 128) . An ordinary rende ring of “Ka - hetep” woul d be “image of peace”=type of attainm ent; but as the word hetep or hepti also means num ber seven, that coincides with the Ka being an image of the septenary of soul s, com plete at last to be uni f ied in the hawk - headed Horus. In the book or papyr us - roll for invoki ng the gods of the Kerti, or bounda ries, we find the speaker has now reached the limit of Amenta. He says, “I am the soul of Osiris, and rest in him” (ch. 127) . He is hailed as one who ha s attained his Ka and received his insigni a of the resurrection. It is now said to the Osiris, “Ha, Osiris! thou hast received thy sceptre, thy pedestal, and the flight of stairs beneath thee” (Rit., ch. 128) . The sceptre was the hare - headed sym bol of the resurrection first carried by Ptah the ope ner. The pedestal is the papyr us of Horus, and the stairs denot e the means of ascent from Amenta to the sum mit of the Mount of Glory. He is now prepared and empow ered to enter the bark of Ra which voya ges from east to west by day and from west to east by night . Before entering the bark the Osiris has attained to every one of his stations in Amenta previous ly to sailing for the circum pol ar paradise upon the stellar Mount of Glory. Chapter 130 is the book by which th e soul is made to live for ever on the day of entering the bark of Ra, which means that it cont ains the gnos is of the subj ect. It was made for the birthda y or re - birthda y of Osiris. Osiris is rebor n in Horus as the type of an eternal soul . Hence the speake r says, in this character, “I am coffined in an ark like Horus, to whom his cradle [or nest of reeds] is brought .” He is rebor n as Horus on his"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"papyr us, an earlier figure on the water than the bark of Ra. He prays, “Let not the Osiris be shipw recked on the great voya ge; keep the steering tackle free from misadve nture.” When he entered Amenta the deceased in Osiris bor e the likeness of the god in mum my form. Before he com es forth from the low er Aarru garden he can say, at the end of certain transformations i n type and persona lity, “I am the soul of Osiris, and I rest in him” (ch. 127) . This is in the character of Horus. “I am Horus on this auspicious day” at the “beautiful com ing forth from Amenta.” He 206 has reached the bounda ry, and now invoke s the god w ho is in his solar disk, otherwise in the bark of Ra. He died in Osiris to live again in Horus, son of god, or in his likeness. Chapters 141 and 142 begin the book of making the Osiris perfect. And this, as the Ritual show s, was in the likeness of Horus th e belove d sole - begot ten son of Ra, the god in spirit. Now , when the Manes had include d his Ka in the name of Ka - hetep (Rit., ch. 128) it is said to the deceased (in the Pyramid texts, Teta, 284, Pepi I, 34) , “Horus hath brought to pass that his ka, which i s in thee, shoul d uni te with thee in thy name of Ka - hetep,” which show s the Ka within him was the image of Horus divinized. This corrobor ates the sugge stion that the ka - type was derived from Ka (later Sa) the son of Atum - Ra, who was earlier than Horus as t he son of Osiris. Thus the divine sons hip of hum anity which was personi fied in Horus, or Iu, or Sa, was also typi fied in the ka - image of a highe r spiritual self; and when the Manes had attained the status of a spirit perfected it was in the form of the div ine son who was the expr ess image of the father god. He was Horus the belove d, in all reality, through perfecting the ideal type in his ow n persona lity. He now enters the divine presence of Osiris - Ra to relate what he has done in the character of hum an Ho rus, Har - Tema, and Har - Makhe ru on behalf of his father which cons titutes him the veritable son of god. When the Manes had attained the solar bark he has put on “the divine body of Ra” and is hailed by the ministrants with cries of welcom e and acclamations from the Mount of Glory (ch. 133) . In travelling through the unde r - world he had passed from the western hor izon of earth to the east of heaven, where he joins the solar boa t to voya ge the celestial waters. There is a change of boa t for the night . Hence the speaker says he is “com ing in the two barks of the lord of Sau” (ch. 136 B , Renouf ). There may be som e difficulty abou t the exact pos ition of the chapter num bered 110 in the Ritual, but there is no difficulty in identifying the fields of peace upon the sum mit of Mount Hetep as the low er paradise of two, which was the land of prom ise attainable in Amenta. This was the sub - terrestrial or earthly paradise of the legends . When the Manes com es to these elysian fields he is still in the earth of eternity, and has to prove himself an equa l as a worker with the might y Khus (Khut i), who are nine cubi ts high, in cultivating his allotment of arable land. The arrival at Mount Hetep in this low er paradise or heaven of the solar mythos precedes the entrance to the Judgm en t Hall which is in the dom ain of the Osiris below , and the voya ge from east to west in the Matit and the Sektit bark of the sun, therefore it is not in the ultimate heaven or the uppe r paradise of eternity upon Mount Hetep. We see from the Pyramid texts (P epi I, lines 192, 169, 182 , Maspero, Les Inscrip. Des Pyram ids de Sak karah ) that there were two stages of ascent to the uppe r paradise, that were represented by two ladde rs: one is the ladde r of Sut, as the ascent from the land of darkne ss, the other is th e ladde r of Horus, reaching to"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"the land of light . King Pepi salutes the two: “Hom age to thee, O ladde r of Sut. Set thys elf up, O ladde r of God. Set thys elf up, O ladde r of Sut. Set thys elf up, O ladde r of Horus, whereby Osiris appe ared in heaven when he wr oug ht protection for Ra.” Pepi likewise enters heaven 207 in his name of the ladde r (Budge , Book of the Dead, Intro., pp. 117 , 118 ). The Manes also says, in ch. 149 , “I raise my ladde r up to the sky, that I may behol d the gods .” But, having traced the r econs truction of the deceased for a future life, we now return, to follow him onc e more from the entrance to Amenta on his jour ney through the unde r - world. His mortal persona lity having been made as permanent as pos sible in the mum my left on earth, the Man es rising in Amenta now sets out to attain the persona lity that is to last for ever. He pleads with all his dum bne ss that his mout h may be ope ned, or, in other words, that his memory, which he has lost awhile, may be given back to him, so that he may utter the words of pow er (chs. 21 - 23) with which he is equi ppe d. The ceremony of ope ning the mout h after the silence of death was one of the profounde st secrets. The great type of pow er by means of which the mout h is ope ned was the leg of the hippopot amus godde ss, the sym bol of her mightiness as primum mobi le in the Great Bear having been adopt ed for this purpos e in the eschatology. The ceremony was performed at the tom b as well as in Amenta by the ope ner Ptah as a mystery of the resurrection. And amongs t the ma ny other survivals this rite of “ope ning the mout h” is still performed in Rom e. It was announc ed in a daily paper not long since (the Mail, Augus t 8th, 1903 ) that after the death of Pope Leo XIII and the corona tion of Pius X “a Cons istory woul d be held to close and ope n the lips of the cardinals newly created,” or newly bor n into the purple. The Osiris also prays that when his mout h is ope ned Taht may com e to him equi ppe d with the words of pow er. So soon as the mout h of the Manes is freed from the fetters o f dum bne ss and darkne ss (or muzzles of Sut) and restored to him, he collects the words of pow er from all qua rters more persistently than any sleuth - hound and more swiftly than the flash of light (chs. 23, 24, Renouf ). These words of pow er are magical in th eir effect. They paralyze all oppos ition. They ope n every door . The pow er is at onc e appl ied. The speaker says, “Back, in retreat! Back, crocodi le Sui! Com e not against me, who live by the words of power!” (ch. 31) . This is spoke n to the crocodi les or drag ons who com e to rob the Manes and carry off the words of pow er that protect the deceased in death. The magical mode of employi ng the words of pow er in the mysteries of Taht is by the deceased being assimilated to the character and assum ing the supe rhum an t ype as a means of protection against the pow ers of evil. The speaker in the Ritual doe s not mistake himself for the deity. He is the deity pro tem. in acted Sign - langua ge, and by such means is master of the magical pow er. It is the god who is the pow er, an d the magician employs the words and signs which expr ess that pow er; but instead of praying to the god he makes use of the divine words attribut ed to the god, and persona tes the god as Horus or Ra, Taht or Osiris, in character. He put s on the mask of a cro codi le, an ibis, a lion, or other zoot ype of the primary pow ers, and says to his adve rsaries: I am the crocodi le (=Sebek), or, I am the lion (=Atum ), or, I am Ra, the sun, protecting himself with the Uræus serpent, and conseque ntly no evil thing can ove rth row"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"me (ch. 32) . Repeating ch. 42 was a magical way of escaping from the slaught er which was wrought in Suten - Khen, and the mode of magic was for the deceased in his re - 208 birth to becom e or to be assimilated to the divine child in his rebirth. He tell s the serpent Abur that he is the divine babe, the might y one . Not a limb of him is without a god. He is not to be grasped by arms or seized by hands . “Not men or gods , the glorified one s or the damned; not generations past, present, or to com e, can inflic t any injury on him who com eth forth and proceedeth as the eternal child, the everlasting one ” (Rit., ch. 42), or as Horus, the son of Isis. These divine characters are assum ed by the Manes when he com mands his enemies to do his biddi ng. According to the m agical prescriptions , in fight ing the devil, or the evil Apap, a figur e of the mons ter was to be moul ded in wax with the name inscribed upon it in green (Budge , Proceedings Soc . of Arch., 1866, p. 21) . This was to be spat upon many times, spur ned with the foot , and then flung into the fire, as a magical mode of casting out the devil. When the Apap reptile is first encount ered and addr essed in the Ritual it is said, “O one of wax! who takest captive and seizest with violence and livest upon thos e who are mot ionless, let me not becom e motionless before thee” (Rit., ch. 7). This is because the presence of the devour ing mons ter is made tangi ble by the image of wax which represents the pow er addr essed, that is otherwise invi sible. The ideal becom es conc rete in th e figure that is thus magically employe d. It is in this magical sense that the ope ning chapters of the Ritual are declared to cont ain the “words of pow er” that bring about the resurrection and the glory of the Manes in Amenta. This mode of magic is likewis e a mode of hypnot ism or hum an magne tism which was uni versally com mon with the primitive races, especially the African, but which is onl y now being timidly touc hed by mode rn science. The pow er of paralyzing and of arresting motion was looke d upon as magica l pot ency inde ed. Hypnot ic pow er is magical pow er. This is described as being taken from the serpent as its strengt h. In one passage (Rit., ch. 149) the serpent is described as he “who paralyzes with his eyes.” And previous ly, in the same chapter, the spea ker says to the serpent, “I am the man who cove rs thy head with darkne ss, and I am the great magician. Thine eyes have been given to me, and I am glorified through them. Thy strengt h [or pow er] is in my grasp.” This might be termed a lesson in hypnot ism. T he speaker becom es a great magician by taking pos session of the paralyzing pow er in the eyes of the serpent. The description seems to imply that there had been a cont est betwixt the serpent - charmer and the serpent, and that the man had conque red by wrestin g the magical pow er from the reptile. The Manes has much to say about the adve rsary of soul s whom he meets in Amenta. This is the Apap of darkne ss, of drought and dearth, disease and death. It is the representative of evil in phys ical phe nom ena which was t ranslated as a figur e from the mythol ogy into the dom ain of eschatology. In chapter 32 the “Osiris stande th up upon his feet” to face and defy the crocodi les of darkne ss who devour the dead and carry off the words of pow er from the glorified in the unde r - w orld. They are stoppe d and turned back when the speaker says: “I am Atum . All things which exist are in my grasp, and thos e depend on me which are not yet in being. I have received increase of lengt h and depth and fulness of breathing within the dom ain of my father the great one . He hath given me the "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"209 beautiful Amenta through which the living pass from death to life” (ch. 32). Thus the Osiris appe ars, speaks, and acts in the characters of a drama previous ly extant in the mythol ogy. He com es forth: As t he bul l of Osiris (ch. 53 A ); as the god in lion form, Atum (ch. 54); as the jackal Ap - uat, of Sothis or Polaris; as the divine hawk, Horus (ch. 71) ; as the sacred hawk (ch. 78) ; as the lotus of earth (ch. 81) ; as the bennu - bird or phœ nix - soul of Ra (ch. 83 ); as the shen - shen or hernshaw (ch. 84); as the soul that is an image of the eternal (ch. 85) ; as the dove or swallow (ch. 86); as the crocodi le Sebek (ch. 88); as the khu, or glorified spirit (ch. 91) ; and many more. But the indi vidua l is show n to persis t in a hum an form. He com es forth by day and is living after death in the figure, but not as the mum my, that he wore on earth. He is por trayed staff in hand, prepared for his jour ney through the unde r - world (Naville, Todt ., Kap. 2, vigne tte). Also the ka - i mage of man the immortal is portrayed in the likeness of man the mortal. The hum an figur e is never lost to view through all the pha ntasmagor ia of transformation (Naville, Todt ., vigne ttes to Kap. 2 and 186) . From beginni ng to end of the Ritual we see it is a being onc e hum an, man or wom an, who is the traveller through the nether - world up the mount of rebirth in heaven, at the sum mit of the stellar paradise, where the effigy of the earthly persona lity was ultimately merged in the divine image of the ka, and the mortal put s on immortality in the likeness of the dear old hum anity, change d and glorified. This show s the ghos t was founde d on a human basis, and that it cont inue d the hum an likeness in proof of its hum an origin. Resurrection in the Ritual is the co ming forth to day (Peri - em - hru), whether FROM the life on earth or TO the life attainable in the heaven of eternity. The first resurrection is, as it were, an ascension from the tomb in the nether earth by means of the secret door way. But this com ing forth is in, not from, Amenta, after bur ial in the uppe r earth. The deceased had passed through the sepul chre, emerging in the low er earth. He issues from the valley of darkne ss and the shadow of death. Osiris had been cut to pieces in the luna r and other phe no mena by the evil Sut, and the limbs were gathered up and put toge ther by his son and by the mother in Amenta, where he rose again as Horus from the dead. And whatsoever had been pos tulated of Osiris the mum my in the mythol ogy was repeated on behalf of the Osiris in the eschatology. Osiris had originated as a god in matter when the pow ers were elemental, but in the later theology the supr eme soul in nature was conf igur ated in a hum an form. Matter as hum an was then cons idered highe r than matter unhum anized, and the body as hum an mum my was supe rior to matter in external nature. Also the spirit in hum an form was som ething beyond an elemental spirit; hence the god as supr eme spirit was based, as already show n, upon the hum an ghos t, with matter as the mum my. Osir is as a mummy in Amenta is what we might call the dead body of matter inve sted with the limbs and features of the hum an form, as the type to which the elemental pow ers had attained in Ptah, in Atum , and in the hum an - featured Horus, which succeeded the earl ier representation by means of zoot ype s. Osiris is a figure of inanimate nature, persona lized as the mum my with a hum an form and face, whilst being also an image 210 "},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"of matter as the phys ical body of the god. The process appl ied to the hum an body first i n death was afterwards appl ied to the god in matter, in the elements, or in the inert condi tion at the time of the winter solstice, awaiting corpse - like for his transformation or transubs tantiation into the young and glorious bod y of the sun, or spirit of vegetation in the spring. The solar god as the sun of evening or of autum n was the suffering, dyi ng sun, or the dead sun buried in the nether earth. To show this, it was made a mummy of, bound up in the linen vesture without a seam, and thus imaged in a li keness of the dead who bor e the mum my form on earth, the unknow n being represented by the know n. The sun god when descendi ng to Amenta may be said to mum mify or karas his ow n body in becom ing earthed or, as it were, fleshed in the earth of Ptah. Hence the mum my - type of Ptah, of Atum , and Osiris, each of whom at different stages was the solar god in mum mied form when buried in Amenta. It has now to be show n how it was brought about that the final and supr eme one god of the Egypt ian religion was represented a s a mum my in the earth of eternity, and why the mystery of the mum my is the profounde st of all the mysteries of Amenta. An essential element in Egypt ian religion was hum an sym pathy with the suffering god , or the pow er in nature which gave itself, whether a s herself or himself, as a living sacrifice, to bring the elements of life to men in light , in water, air, vegetation, fruit, root s, grain, and all things edible. Whence the type was eaten sacramentally at the thank sgiving meal. This feeling was pathetical ly expr essed at “the festival of the staves,” when crutches were offered as suppor ts for the suffering autum n sun, otherwise the cripple deity Horus, dyi ng dow n into Amenta and pitifully needing help which the hum an sym pathizers tried to give. Can anyt hing be more pathetic than this addr ess to the sufferer as the sun god in Amenta: “Decree this, O Atum , that if I see thy face [in glory] I shall not be pained by the signs of thy sufferings .” Atum decrees. He also decrees that the god will look on the suppl ia nt as his second self (Rit., ch. 173; Naville). The legend of the vol untary victim who in a passion of divinest pity became incarnate, and was clothed in hum an form and feature for the salvation of the world, did not originate in a belief that God had man ifested onc e for all as an historic persona ge. It has its root s in the remotest part. The same legend was repeated in many lands with a change of name, and at times of sex, for the sufferer, but none of the initiated in the esoteric wisdom ever looke d upon the Kamite Iusa, or gnos tic Horus, Jesus, Tammuz, Krishna , Buddha , Witoba , or any other of the many saviour s as historic in persona lity, for the simple reason that they had been more truly taught . Mythol ogy was earlier than eschatology, and the hum an vict im was preceded by the zoot ype ; the phe nom ena first rende red mythically were not manifested in the hum an sphe re. The natural genesis was in anot her categor y altoge ther. The earliest Horus was not incorpor ated in a hum an form. He represented that soul of li fe which came by water to a dried - up, withering world upon the verge of perishing with hunge r and with thirst. Here the fish or the first - fruit of the earth was the sign of his incorporation in matter; hence the typi cal shoot , the green ear, or the branch that were imaged 211 in Child - Horus. The saviour who came by water was Ichthys the fish. The saviour who came in fruit as produc t of the tree was the Natzer. The saviour who came by spirit was the soul of the sun. This was the earliest rende ring of the i ncorpor ation of Horus as the"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"primary life and light of the world made manifest in external nature, before the doc trine was appl ied to biology in the hum an dom ain, where Horus came by blood , as the mode of incarnation in the hum an form. In the later myth Os iris is the deity who suffered as the winter sun, assailed by all the pow ers of darkne ss. He also suffered from the drought as imaged in the fire - breathing Apap - reptile, and in other ways as lord of life in water, vegetation, and in various forms of food . This suffering deity or provi der was the god in matter. Ra is the god in spirit, Osiris in matter. Not onl y in the matter of earth, but also in the hum an form — the form assum ed by Horus as the child of earth, or Seb. Osiris, the great sufferer in the dead o f winter, was not simply the sun, nor was Osiris dead, how ever inert in matter, lying dum b in darkne ss, with non - beating heart. He was the bur ied life of earth, and hence the god in matter imaged in the likeness of a mum my waiting for the resurrection in A menta. Such was the eschatology. Mum my - making in Egypt was far older than the Osirian cult. It was at least as old as Anup the divine embalmer of the dead. Preserving the hum an mum my perfectly intact was a mode of hol ding on to the individua l form and feat ures as a means of preserving the earthly likeness for identifying the persona lity hereafter in spirit. The mum my was made on pur pos e to preserve the phys ical likeness of the mortal. The risen dead are spoke n of in the Ritual as “thos e who have found their faces.” The mum my was a primitive form of the African effigy in which the body was preserved as its ow n por trait, whereas the ka was intende d for a likeness of the spirit or immortal — the likeness in which the just spirit made perfect was to see Osiris in his glory. Both the mummy and the ka were represented in the Egypt ian tomb, each with a chamber to itself. From the beginni ng there had been a visible ende avour to preserve som e likeness or memento of the earthly body even when the bone s alone coul d be pre served. Mum my - making in the Ritual begins with collecting the bone s and piecing them toge ther, if onl y in a likeness of the skeleton. It is at this stage that Horus is said to collect the bone s of his father Osiris for the resurrection in a future life by means of transubs tantiation. The same primitive mode of preparing the mum my is implied when it is said to the solar god on entering the unde r - world, “Reckon thou thy bone s, and set thy limbs, and turn thy face to the beautiful Amenta” (ch. 133, Renouf ). Te ta, deceased, is thus addr essed, “O Teta, thou hast raised up thy head for thy bone s, and thou hast raised up thy bone s for thy head.” Also the hand of Teta is said to be like a wall as suppor t of Horus in giving stability to his bone s. Thus the founda tion was laid for bui lding the mum my - type as a present image of the person who had passed. Amongs t other type s, the Yucatanese made little statues of their fathers. The head was left hol low , so that the ashes of the cremated 212 body might be placed in the skul l, as in an urn; this, says Landa , was then cove red “with the skin of the occiput taken from the corpse.” The custom is akin to that which has been une arthed in the Europe an bone caves, where the skul ls of the adul t dead are found to have been trepanne d, and the bone s of little children inserted instead of human ashes. In Sign - langua ge the bone s of the child were typi cal of rebirth in a future life. The desire to live and the long ing for a life after death, in earlier times, are inexpr essible, and the e fforts made to give som e kind of expr ession to the feeling are ineffably pathetic. D’Acugna relates that it was a custom with the South American Indians to preserve and"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"keep the dead bodi es of relatives in their hom es as long as was pos sible, so as to have their friends cont inua lly before their eyes. For these they made feasts and set out viands before the dead bodi es. Here, in passing, we woul d sugge st that in the Egypt ian custom as described by bot h Herodot us and Plutarch it was not the dead mum my that wa s brought to table as a type of immortality, but the image of the ka, which denot ed what the gue sts woul d be like after death, and was therefore a cause for rejoicing. Carrying the ka image round the festive boa rd was just a Kamite prototype of the elevati on and carrying round of the hos t for ador ation in the Chur ch of Rom e. Indeed, the total paraphe rnalia of the Christian mysteries had been made use of in Egypt ian temples. For instance, in one of the many titles of Osiris in all his forms and places he is called “Osiris in the mons tranc e” (Rit., ch. 141, Naville). In the Rom an ritual the monstrance is a transparent vessel in which the hos t or victim is exhi bited. In the Egyp tian cult Osiris was the victim. The elevation of the hos t signi fies the resurrectio n of the crucified god , who rose again in spirit from the corpus of the victim, now represented by the hos t. Osiris in the mons trance shoul d of itself suffice to show that the Egypt ian Karast (Krst) is the original Christ, and that the Egypt ian mysteries w ere cont inue d by the gnos tics and Christianized in Rom e. The mode of conve ying the oral wisdom to the initiate in the mysteries of young man making was cont inue d in the mystery of mum my making. Whilst the mummy was being prepared for bur ial, chapters of th e Ritual were read to it, or to the cons cious ka, by an official who was know n as the man of the roll. Every Egypt ian was suppos ed to be acqua inted with the formulæ, from having learned them dur ing his lifetime, by which he was to have the use of his limbs and pos session of his soul restored to him in death, and to be protected from the dange rs of the nether - world. These were repeated to the dead person, how ever, for greater security, during the process of embalming, and the son of the deceased, or the mast er of the ceremoni es, took care to whisper to the mum my the most mysterious parts, which no living ear might hear with impuni ty. (Maspero, The Struggl e of Nations , Eng. trans., pp. 510, 511. ) But it is an error to suppos e with som e Egypt ologi sts, like M. de Horrack, that the new existence of the deceased was begun in the old earthly body ( Proceed. Soc iety of Bib. Archæ ology , vol . VI, March 4, 188 4, p. 126) . The resurrection of the dead in mum my form may look at first sight as if the old dead corpse had 21 3 risen from the sepul chre. But the risen is not the dead mum my, it is a type of persona lity in the shape of the mum my. It is what the Ritual describes as the mum my - form of a god. The Manes prays, “May I too arise and assum e the mum mied form as a god, ” th at is, as the mum my of Osiris, the form in which Amsu - Horus rose, a type of permanent preservation, but not yet one of the spirits made perfect by pos session of the ka. It was this mistake which led to a false idea that the Egyp tian held the dog ma of a cor poreal resurrection of the dead which became one of the doctrines that were fostered into fixity by the A - Gnos tic Christians. The Osiris as mortal Manes, or Amsu - Horus as divinity, doe s rise in the mum my form, but this is in anot her life and in anot her wor ld, not as a hum an being on our earth. It has the look of a phys ical resurrection in the old body, and so the ignor ant misinterpreters mistook it and foun ded on it a corpor eal basis for the future life. In the Christian scheme the bur ied dead were to rise again in the old phys ical"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"corpus for the last judgm ent in time at the literal endi ng of the world. This was anot her delusion based on the misrende ring of the Egypt ian wisdom . The dead who rose again in Amenta, which was the ground floor of a future state o f existence, also rose again for the judgm ent; but this took place in the earth of eternity which was mistaken by the Christians for the earth of time, just as they had mistaken the form of the risen sahu for the old body of matter that never was suppos ed to rise again by thos e who kne w. The earthly mum my of the deceased doe s not go to heaven, nor doe s it enter the solar boa t, yet the Osiris is told to enter the boa t, his reward being the seat which receives his sahu or spirit mum my (Rit., ch. 130) . Clearly this can only refer to the spiritual body , as the earthly mum my was left on the earth out side the gates of Amenta. Not onl y is the corpor eal mum my not placed on boa rd the boa t of soul s, the deceased was to be represented by a statue of cedar wood anoi nted with oil, or, as we might say, Christified (134, 9, 10). There is no pos sible que stion of a corpor eal resurrection. The obj ect, aim, and end of all the spiritualizing processes is to becom e non - corpor eal in the earthly sense — that is, as the Ritual represe nts it, to defecate into pure spirit. The word sahu (or the mum my) is employe d to expr ess the future form as well as the old. But it is a spiritual sahu, the divine mummy. Even the bone s and flesh of soul s are mentione d, but these are the bone s of Ösiris, the backbone of the uni versal frame, and the flesh of Ra. The terms used for the purpos e of divinizing are antipoda l to any idea of return to corporeality as a material mum my. The mum my of the Manes is a sahu of the glorified spirit. This state of being is attained by the deceased in chapter 73: “I am the beloved son of his father. I com e to the state of a sahu of the well - furnished Manes.” He is said to be mum mified in the shape of a divine hawk when he takes the form of Horus (78, 15, 16) , not as the eart hly mum my in a resurrection on our earth. The resurrection of Osiris was not corpor eal. The mum my of the god in matter or mortality rises from the tom b transubs tantiated into spirit. So com plete is the transformation that he is Osiris bodi ly change d into H orus as a sahu or spirit. The Egypt ians had no doc trine of a phys ical resurrection 214 of the dead. Though they retained the mum my as a type of personal ity, it was a change d and glorified form of the earthly body, the mum my that had attained its feet in the resurrection. It was the Karast mum my, or, word for word and thing for thing, Amsu - Horus was the Kamite Christ who rose up from the mum my as a spirit. Also it is entirely false to represent the Egypt ians as making the mum my and preserving it for the r eturn of the soul into the old earthly body . That is but a shadow of the true idea cast backw ards by Christianity. Millions of cats were made into mummies and sacredly preserved around the city of Buba stes, but not with the not ion of a bodi ly resurrection. They were the totems of the great cat clan or its metropol is, the Egyp tian “Clan Chattan,” which had becom e sym bol s or fetishes of religious signi ficance to later times when the totemic mother as the cat, the seer by night , was divinized in the luna r godd ess Pasht, and the worshippe rs embalmed her zoot ype , not because they ador ed the cat, but because the deess herself was the Great Mother typi fied by the cat. Both the mother and the moon were recogni zed beyond the cat, which was their totemic zoot ype and v enerated sym bol . Osiris was the mum my of Amenta in two characters; in one he is"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"the kha t - mum my lying laid out with corpselike face upon the fune ral couc h, in the other he is the mum my risen to his feet and incorpor ated in the glorious body . These two chara cters were cont inue d as the Corpus Christi and the risen Christ in Rom e. Hence in the iconogr aphy of the catacom bs the Egypt ian mummy as Osiris - sahu, and as Horus the new - bor n solar child, are the demons trators of the resurrection for the Christian faith, where there is no testimony whatever to an historical event. Any time during the last 10, 000 years the mum my made for bur ial in the tomb was imaged in the likeness of Osiris in Amenta, who, though periodi cally bur ied, rose again for ever as the type of lif e eternal. In making the mum my of Osiris the Egyptians were also making an image of the god who rose again in spirit as Osiris - sahu or as Horus divinized, the risen Christ of the Osirian cult. When the lustrations were performed with water in Tattu and the anoi ntings with oil in Abydos , it was what may be termed a mode of Christifying or making Horus the child of earth into Horus the son of god who became so in his baptism and anoi nting that were represented in the mysteries. The first Horus was bor n of the virgin, not begot ten. The second Horus was begot ten of the father, and the child was made a man of in his baptismal regeneration with the water and with unc tion, with the oil of a tree or the fat of a bul l. We have now to show that in making the mummy th e Egypt ians were also making the typi cal Christ, which is the anoi nted. The word karas, kares, or karis in Egypt ian signi fies embalmment, to embalm, to anoint, to make the mum my. Kreas, creas, or chros, in Greek denot es the hum an body , a person or carcase, more expr essly the flesh of it; cras, Gaelic and Irish, the body; Latin, corpus , for a dead body; these are all preceded by the word karas or karast, in Egyp tian, with the risen mum my for determinative of the meaning. Each body that had been embalmed was karast, so to say, and made into a type of immortality in the likeness of Osiris - sahu or Horus, the prototypa l 215 Christ. It will be made appa rent by degrees that the religion of the Chrestoi first began at Memphi s with the cultus of the mum my in its tw o characters, which represented body and spirit, or Ptah in matter and Kheper (Iu - em - hetep) in spirit. Hence the hawk as bird of spirit issuing from the karast - mummy was an image of the resurrection. The origin of the Christ as the anoi nted or “karast” wil l expl ain the conne ction of the Christ name and that of the Christiani with unc tion and anoi nting. Horus the Kamite Christ was the anoi nted son. The oil upon his face was the sign of his divinity. This suppl ied a figur e of the Christ to Paul when he says t hat for thos e who “put on Christ” “there can be no male and female, for ye are one [man or mum my] in Christ Jesus” (Gal., III, 28) . The Christ was “put on” metaphor ically in the process of anoi nting which originated with the making of the mum my. Whether th e dead were represented by the bone s inve sted with a coating of blood, of flesh - colour ed earth, or by the eviscerated and desiccated body that was banda ged in the cloth of a thous and folds, the obj ect was to preserve and perpetuate the deceased in som e per manent form of persona lity. The Egypt ians aimed at making the mum my imperishable and incorrupt ible, as an image of durability and cont inui ty, a type of the eternal, or of Osiris - karast in the likeness of a mum my. Hence the swathe without a seam and of incr edible lengt h in which the mum my was enfolded to represent une ndi ng"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"dur ation. Som e of these have been unw ound to the extent of seven or eight hundr ed yards, and one of them is described as being a thou sand yards in lengt h. But, how ever long, it was made wi thout a seam. This vesture is allude d to in the chapter of the gol den vul ture. The chapter is to be inscribed for the protection of the deceased on “the day of his bur ial in the cloth of a thous and folds” (Rit., ch. 157 , 3). This cloth was the seamless sw athe of the Egypt ian karast, which became the vesture or “coat without a seam wove n from the top throughou t” (John XIX. 23) for the Christ. Even the poo rest Egypt ian, whos e body was steeped in salt and natron and anoi nted with a little cedar oil, was wrapp ed in a singl e piece of linen equa lly with the mum my whos e swathe was hundr eds of yards in lengt h, because the fune ral vesture of Osiris, his body of matter, was without a seam. The dead are often called “the banda ged one s.” On rising from the tom b the dec eased exclaims trium pha ntly, “O my father! my sister! my mother Isis! I am freed from my banda ges! I can see! I am one of thos e who are freed from their banda ges to see Seb” (158, 1). Seb denot es the earth, and the Manes is free to visit the earth again, t his time as the ghos t or doub le of his former self. Cove ring the corpse with the transparent tahn, or gol den gum, was one way of turning the dead body into a type of the spiritual body which was imaged as the glorified. One cannot doubt that this was a mod e of show ing the transformation of the Osirian dead mum my into the lum inous body called the sahu of Osiris when he was transfigur ed but still retained the mum my form in Amsu - Horus at his rising from the sepul chre. Mum mies bur ied in the tom b at Medum had be en thus enve lope d. This was one form of inve stiture allude d to in the Ritual as distingui shed from the mum my banda ges. One of these mum mies is now to be seen in the Roya l College of Surgeons . 216 “The mode of embalming, ” says Prof. Petrie, “was very sing ular. The body was shrunk , wrappe d up in linen cloth, then mode lled all ove r with resin (or tahn) into the natural shape and plum pne ss of the living figure, com pletely restoring all the fullness of the form, and this was wrappe d round with a few turns of t he finest gauze.” (Petrie, Medum , Intro., ch. 2, pp. 17 and 18.) There was no coffin present in the tom b. The mum my thus inve sted with the tahn had been bur ied in this primitive kind of glass case, in which the form and features coul d be seen either direct ly or by means of the mode lling. The tahn, gum or resin, as a natural produc t from the tree, preceded glass, and woul d be fashione d for the earlier mons trance. Remode lling the dead in the likeness of the living form by means of the pellucid tahn is a mode of making the glorified body on earth that was imaged by the sahu in Amenta, and thus the mum my here attains the twofold type of the Osiris Khat, or corpse, and the Osiris - sahu, or the glorified in spirit. In the Christian aggl om erate of Egypt ian doc trines and dogm as, rites and sym bol s, the pellucid tahn may, we think, be recogni zed in the sacred mons trance of the Rom an ritual. This is a show - case in which the hos t or Corpus Christi is placed to be upl ifted and exhi bited. The eye of Horus is yet visible in the lanul a or crescent - shaped crystal of the mons trance which hol ds the cons ecrated bread. The name of this show - case is derived from the Latin mons trare, “to show ,” and this had been the obj ect of the mum my makers in employing the transparent tahn."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" In th e eschatologi cal or final pha se of the doc trine, to make the mum my was to make the typi cal anoi nted, also called the Messu, the Messiah, and the Christ. Mes or mas, in the hierogl yphi cs, signi fies to anoi nt and to steep, as in making the mum my, and messu i n Egypt ian means the anoi nted; whence Iah the Messu becom es Messiah in Hebrew. There was a previous form of the anoi nted in the totemic mysteries of young man making. When the body attained the age of puberty he was made into the anoi nted one at the time o f his initiation into the way of a man with a wom an. It was a custom with certain Inne r African tribes to slit the urethra of the boy and lubricate the member with palm oil. This was a primitive way of making the anoi nted at pube rty. Australian abor igines are also know n to slit the prepuc e cove r for the same pur pos e. At this stage of the mystery the anoi nted one is the adul t yout h who has attained the rank of begetter full of grace and favour , or is khe mt, as it was rende red in Egypt ian. Tertullian claims t hat the name of the Christians came from the unc tion received by Jesus Christ. This is in perfect keeping with the derivation of the typi cal Christ from the mum my which was anoi nted so abunda ntly with oil in its embalmment. It is said of the wom an who anoi nted Jesus in Bethany, “In that she pour ed the ointment upon my body, she did it to prepar e me for my bur ial” (Matt. XXVI. 12). She was preparing the mum my after the manne r of Anup the embalmer, who prepared Osiris for his bur ial and resurrection. But it w as onl y as a dead mum my and not a living man that the gnos tic Jesus coul d have been embalmed for burial. We now proceed to show that Christ the anoi nted is none other than 217 the Osiris - karast, and that the karast mum my risen to its feet as Osiris - sahu was the prototypi cal Christ. Unha ppi ly, these demons trations cannot be made without a wearisom e mass of detail. And we are bound for the bot tom this time. Dr. Budge , in his book on the mum my, tells his readers that the Egyptian word for mum my is ges, whic h signi fies to wrap up in banda ges. But he doe s not point out that ges or kes, to embalm the corpse or make the mum my, is a reduc ed or abraded form of an earlier word, karas (whence krst for the mummy). The original word written in hierogl yphi cs is krst, w hence kas, to embalm, to banda ge, to knot , to make the mum my or karast (Birch, Dictionar y of the Hierogl yphi cs, pp. 415 - 416; Champol lion, Gram. Egyptienne , 86) . krst The word krs denot es the embalmment of the mum my, and the krst, as the mum my, was mad e in the process of preparation by pur ifying, anointing, and embalming. To karas the dead body was to embalm it, to banda ge it, to make the mum my. The mum my was the Osirian Corpus Christi, prepared for bur ial as the laid - out dead, the karast by name. When raised to its feet, it was the risen mum my, or sahu. The place of embalmment was likewise the krs. Thus the process of making the mum my was to karas, the place in which it was laid is the karas, and the produc t was the krst, whos e image is the upr ight mum m y= the risen Christ. Hence the name of the Christ, Christos in Greek, Chrestus in Latin, for the anoi nted, was derived, as the present writer previous ly sugge sted, from the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Egypt ian word krst. Karas also signi fies the burial - place, and the word modi fies int o Kâs or Châs. Kâsu the “bur ial place” was a name of the 14t h Nom e in Uppe r Egypt . A god Kâs is mentione d three or four times in the Book of the Dead, “the god Kâs who is in the Tuat” (ch. 40) . This was a title of the mum my Osiris in the fune rary dw elling. In one passage Kâs is described as the deliverer or saviour from all mortal needs. In “the chapter of raising the body” (178 ) it is said of the deceased that he had been hungr y and thirsty (on earth), but he will never hunge r or thirst any more, “for Kâs delivers him” and doe s away with wants like these. That is, in the resurrection. Here the name of the god Osiris - Kâs written at full is Osiris the Karast — the Egypt ian Christ. Not onl y is the risen mum my or sahu called the karast, Osiris as lord of the bier is the Neb - karast equi valent to the later Christ the Lord, and the lord of the bier is god of the resurrection from the hous e of death. Neb - karast The karast is literally the god or person who has been mum mified, embalmed, and anoi nted or christified . Anup the baptizer and embalmer of the dead for the new life was the preparer of the karast - mum my. As John the Baptist is the founde r of the Christ in baptism, so Anup was the christifier of the moral Horus, he on whom the hol y ghos t descende d as a bird w hen the Osiris made his transformation in the marriage mystery of Tattu (Rit., ch. 17) . We read in the fune ral texts of Anup being “Suten tu hetep, Anup, neb tser khe nt neter ta krast - ef em set” (Birch, Funeral Text, 4th Dyna sty). “Suten hept tu Anup tep - t uf khe nt neter ha am ut neb tser krast ef em as - ef en kar 218 neter em set Amenta” (Birch, Fune ral Stele of Ra - Khepr - Ka, 12t h Dyna sty). Anup gives embalmment, krast; he is lord ove r the place of embalmment, the kras; the lord of embalming (krast), who, s o to say, makes the “krast.” The process of embalmment is to make the mum my. This was a type of immortality or rising again. Osiris is krast, or embalmed and mum mified for the resurrection. Passage into life and light is made for the karast - dead through th e embalmment of the good Osiris (Rit., ch. 162) — that is, through his being karast as the mum my type . Thus the Egyptian krast was the pre - Christian Christ, and the pictures in the Rom an Catacom bs preserve the proof . The passing of the karast into the Christ is depicted in the gnos tic iconogr aphy. It is in the form of a child bound up in the swathings of a diminut ive Egypt ian mum my, with the halo and cross of the four qua rters round its head, which show its solar origin. The Mummy - Babe"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" It is the divine infant which has the head of Ra in the Ritual who says, “I am the babe; I renew myself, and I grow young again” (chs. 42 and 43) . The karast mum my is the type of resurrection in the Rom an Catacom bs because the karast was the prototypa l Christ. It is the Eg ypt ian karast as thing and word that suppl ied and will expl ain the Greek Christ, Christos, Krstos, or Latin Chrestus, and account for the Corpus Christi, the anoi nted, the Saviour , doc trinally, typi cally, actually in every way except historically, and of t hat the karast, Krstos, or Christ is entirely inde pende nt. “Henceforth,” said a digni tary of the Chur ch of Engl and the other day, “Christianity has done with the metaphys ical Christ.” But there is no phys ical Christ except the karast mum my, which was Osiri s when laid out and lying dow n in death, and Horus of the resurrection standi ng up as Amsu risen from the sepul chre, having the whip hand ove r all the powers of darkne ss and the adve rsaries of his father. Say what you will or believe what you may, there i s no other origin for Christ the anoi nted than for Horus the karast or anointed son of god the father. There is no other origin for a Messiah as the anoi nted than for the Masu or anoi nted. Finally, then, the mystery of the mum my is the mystery of the Chris t. As Christian, it is allow ed to be for ever inexpl icable. As Osirian, the mystery can be expl ained. It is one of the mysteries of Amenta, with a more primitive origin in the rites of totemism. We now claim sufficient warrant for affirming that Christ th e anoi nted is a mystical figur e which originated as the Egypt ian mum my in the twofold character of Osiris in his death and in his resurrection: as Osiris, or mortal Horus, the karast; and Osiris - sahu, or Horus divinized as the anoi nted son. The Christ or k arast still cont inue s to be made when the sacrament of extreme unc tion is adm inistered to the dyi ng as a Rom an Cathol ic rite. Though but a shadow of the primitive reality, it perpetuates the “sacred mystery” of conve rting the corpse into the sahu, the tran subs tantiation of the inert Osiris by descent of Ra; the mortal Horus, child of the mother, 219 into Horus the anoi nted son of god the father. “Extreme unc tion, ” the seventh of the hol y sacraments, is inde ed a Christian rite. It will now be necessary to give an account of certain other mysteries of Amenta and doc trines of the Ritual. The Egypt ians celebrated ten great mysteries on ten different nights of the year. The first was the night of the evening meal (literally the last suppe r), and the laying of offerings on the altar. It is the night of provi sioni ng the Lord’s table. Osiris had been ove rcom e by Sut and the Sebau, who had onc e more renewed their assault upon Un - nefer when they were defeated and exterminated by his faithful follow ers. Therefore thi s was also the night of the great battle when the moon god Taht and the children of light anni hilated the rebellious pow ers of darkne ss. On the second night the ove rthrow n Tat - Cross, with Osiris in it, or on it, was again erected by Horus, Prince of Sekhe m , in the region of Tattu, where the hol y spirit Ra descends upon the mum my and the twain becom e uni ted for the resurrection. On the third night the scene is in Sekhe m; the mystery is that of the blind Horus or of Horus in the dark, who here receives his si ght . It is also the mystery of dawn upon the coffin of Osiris. We might call"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"it the mystery of Horus the mortal transfigur ing into Horus the immortal. On the four th night the four pillars are erected with which the future kingdom of god the father is to be founde d. It is called “the night of erecting the flagstaffs of Horus, and of establishing him as the heir of his father’s prope rty.” The fifth scene is in the region of Rekhe t, and the mystery is that of the two sisters with Isis watching in tears ove r he r brother Osiris, and broodi ng above the dead body to give it the warmth of new life. On the sixth night the glorious one s are judge d, the evil dead are parted off, and joy goe th its round in Thinni s. This is the night of the great festival named Ha - k - er - a , or “Com e thou to me,” in which the blendi ng of the two soul s was solemnized as a glorious mystery by a festival at which there was much eating and drinki ng. The mystery of the seventh night was that of the great judgm ent on the highw ay of the damned, whe n the suit was closed against the rebels who had failed onc e more and were ignom inious ly defeated. After the verdict com es the avenge ment. The eighth is the night of the great hoe ing in Tattu, when the associates of Sut are massacred and the fields are man ured with their blood . The ninth is called “the night of hiding the body of him who is supr eme in attribut es.” The mystery is that of collecting the remains of Osiris, whos e bod y was mutilated and scattered piecemeal by Sut, and of hiding it. The mystery o n the tenth night presents a picture of Anup, the embalmer, the anoi nter, or christifier of the mum my. This is in Rusta, the place of resurrection from Amenta. It may be the series is not in exact order, but that doe s not interfere with the nature of the m ysteries. In each of the ten acts of the drama the suffering Osiris and the trium ph ove r all his adve rsaries are por trayed as mysteries in a prototypa l miracle - play or drama that was held to be divine. The chapter of these ten mysteries was recited peniten tially for the purification of the Manes and the com ing forth after death (Rit., ch. 18, rubr ic). With this we may com pare the fact that the Jewish new year is ushered in with ten days of penitence. 220 The altar or com muni on - table thus provi sione d was the coffin lid. This also was cont inue d in the ritual of Rom e, for it is a fact that the earliest Christian altar was a coffin. According to Blunt ’s Dictionar y of Doctrinal and Historical Theology (p. 16) , this was a hol low chest, on the lid or mensa of wh ich the Eucharist was celebrated. This, as Egyp tian, was the coffin of Osiris that constituted the altar on which the provi sions were laid in Sekhe m for the Eucharistic meal. Hence the resurrection is described as “dawn upon the coffin of Osiris.” Therefor e he rose in spirit from the mum my in the coffin, beneath the lid which cons tituted the table. This was the body suppos ed to be eaten as the Eucharist, which was represented by the provi sions that were laid upon the altar for the sacramental meal. The firs t of the ten great mysteries is the mystery of the Eucharist, and we find that the primitive Christian liturgies are all and whol ly restricted to the Eucharist as the one primordial sacrament of the Christian Chur ch. The first of the Osirian mysteries is t he primary Christian sacrament. “Provi sioni ng the altar” was cont inue d by the Chur ch of Rom e. “The mysteries laid upon the altar” which preceded” the com muni on of the body and blood of Christ” were then eaten in the Eucharistic meal (Neale, Rev. J. M., The Liturgies, Introd. , p. 33) . Thus we see in the cam era obs cura that the provi sions laid on the altar or table represented the flesh and blood of the victim about to be eaten sacramentally. The night of the things that"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"were laid upon the altar is the night of the great sacrifice, with Osiris as the victim. The things laid on the altar for the evening meal represented the body and blood of the Lord. These, as the bread and wine, or flesh and beer, were transelemented or transubs tantiated by the descent of Ra the hol y spirit, which qui ckened and transformed the mum my Osiris into the risen sahu, the unl eavened bread into the leavened, the water into wine. Osiris, the sacrifice, was the giver of himself as “the food which never perishes” (Rit., ch. 89) . The Chri stian liturgies are reckone d to be the “most pur e sour ces of Eucharistical doc trine.” And liturgy appe ars to have been the groundw ork of the Egypt ian ritual. It is said by one of the priests (Rit., ch. 1), “I am he who reciteth the liturgies of the soul wh o is lord of Tattu” — that is, of Osiris who establishes a soul for ever in conj unc tion with Ra the holy spirit in the mysteries of Amenta. In one character Osiris was eaten as the Bull of Eternity, who gave his flesh and blood as sustenance for hum anity, an d who was the divine provi dence as the provi der of food. The eating of the mother was also cont inue d in the Eucharist, Osiris being of bot h sexes. This was typi cally fulfilled in one way by conve rting the bul l into an ox. The dua lity was also imaged in the bread and beer or wine, which is the mother blood in a com muted guise. It is said of the body that was eaten in “the Rom an mysteries” that it is “the body which bestow s on us, out of its wounds , immortality and life, and the beatific vision with the ange l s, and food and drink, and life and light , the very bread of life, the true light , eternal life, Christ Jesus.” “Wherefore this entrance sym bol izes at the same time bot h the second adve nt of Christ and His sepul ture, for it is He who will 221 be our beat ific vision in the life to com e,” as Horus of the second sight , all of which was por trayed of Osiris and fulfilled. (Neale, The Liturgies, Introd., p. 30. ) Blood sacrifice from the beginni ng was an offering of life, hence the life offering. When the mother was the victim her blood was offered as life to the ancestral spirits. It was also life to the brotherhood, and partaking of it in com muni on cons tituted the sacrament. So in the Christian Eucharist the blood is taken to be the life, and is partaken of as the life, the “life of the world” (Neale, Liturgy of Basil the Great ), “the divine life that is the life everlasting, the new life that is for ever” (Neale, Liturgy of St. Chrysostom , II). The bread broke n in the Christian sacrament represents a bod y that was “broken, immolated, and divided.” This doe s not appl y to the body of Jesus, according to the “history.” But it doe s appl y to the body of Osiris, which was “broke n, immolated, and divided” by Sut, who tore it into four teen fragm ents. The altar table, or coffin lid, was provi sione d with these parts of the broke n body to be typi cally eaten as the Eucharist on the night “when there are at the coffin the thigh, the head, the heel, and the leg of Un - nefer.” Moreove r, when the mother was eaten as the sacrifice , the flesh and blood were warm with life. She was not eaten in cold blood. It was the same with the Meriah of the Kolarians, and also with the totemic animal. The efficacy lay in the flesh being eaten alive, and the blood being drunk whilst it was warm wi th life which cons tituted the “living sacrifice.” This type of sacrifice was also cont inue d in the Christian Eucharist. Hot water was at one time pour ed into the chal ice with the wine at the cons ecration of the elements, to give it the warmth of life (Neal e, Liturgy of St. Chrysostom , p. 120. ) Even the act of tearing the flesh of the victim’s body piecemeal is pious ly perpetuated by the breaking instead of cutting the"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"bread for the Christian sacrament. The light s upon the coffin of Osiris are represented in the Rom an ritual by a doubl e taper, the dikerion, reput ed to signi fy “the adv ent of the Holy Spi rit,” which corresponds to the descent of Ra the hol y spirit on the inert body of Osiris in Tattu, where the two soul s are blende d to becom e one in Horus of th e resurrection. The flabellum or fan is a mystical emblem in the Egypt ian mysteries. For one thing, it signi fied the shade or spirit. Fans are freque ntly por trayed for soul s of a primitive type . (Birch, Trans . Soc . Bib. Arch., vol. VIII, p. 386. ) Soul s bu rning in the hells are imaged by flabella. These fans were brought on in the Oriental Chur ch. In the Clementine liturgy they are ordered to be made of peacocks’ feathers (Neale, p. 76, Introd. , pp. 29, 30). They are called fans of the Holy Spirit, and were carried in procession with the “veil that was wrappe d about the body of the Lord Jesus” like the folds of gauze that were wrappe d round the mum my at Medum . But the fan or shade=spirit had been reduc ed in status, and was then used as a flappe r for whisking the flies away from the sacrifice (Durandus , IV, 33 - 8; Neale, Introd., p. 29) . It is not pretende d that the second adve nt is historical, nevertheless it is por trayed in the mystery of the Eucharist by the descent of the Holy Spirit. The second adve nt is t he com ing forth of Horus in spirit from the 222 mum my or corpse which was his image in the human form. The first is in being made flesh and put ting on the likeness of mortality, the second is in making his transformation into a spirit, as the type of imm ortality. The marriage of Cupi d and Psyche is a fable that was founde d on this uni on of the two soul s which we have traced in the Ritual as the soul in matter, or the hum an soul , and the soul in spirit. Cupi d, unde r anot her name, is Eros, whilst Eros and A nteros are a form of the doubl e Horus, Eros in spirit, Anteros in matter, and the blendi ng of the two in the mysteries was the marriage of Cupi d and Psyche in the mystery of Tattu. Now here is anot her of thos e many mysteries which have no origin in histori c Christianity. The Agape was celebrated in conne ction with the Eucharist. This was not founde d at the time of the Last Suppe r, nevertheless it was held to be a Christian sacrament. Paul in speaking of the love - feast at Corinth as a scene of drunke n revelr y (I Cor. II. 20 - 22) , recogni zes the celebration of two suppe rs, which he is desirous of having kept apart, one for the church, and one for the hous e. These two are the Eucharist and the Agape. Ecclesiastical writers differ as to which of the two ought to be solemnized first, but there is no que stion that two were celebrated in conne ction with each other. In his attack on the licentious ness of the Christian Agape Tertullian asks the wives, “Will not your hus bands know what it is you secretly take before oth er food? ” and again, “Who will without anxi ety endur e her absence all night long at the Pascal solemnities?” “Who will without som e suspicion of his ow n let her go to attend that Lord’s banque t which they defame?” (Keating, Y. F., The Agape and the Euchar i st, p. 70. ) As Egyp tian, we can identify the two, and thus infer the order in which they stood to each other. Whether bot h were called suppe rs or not , the Egypt ians celebrated the last suppe r of Osiris on the last night of the old year, and the mesiu, or t he evening meal, on the first night of the new year. And this dua lity was maintained by the gnos tics and cont inue d by the Christians. These are two of the Osirian mysteries, and in the list of the ten great mysteries there are"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"two night s of provi sioni ng th e altar — that is, two night s of a feast or memorial suppe r. One is held in Annu , the other in Sekhe m, with the resurrection in Tattu com ing between the two. In Sekhe m the blind Horus receives his sight , or his beatific vision of the divine glory, which was seen when he had pierced the veil hawk - headed in the image of Ra. Provi sioni ng the altar in Sekhe m is designa ted “dawn upon the coffin of Osiris” (Rit., ch. 18) . The Eucharist was a form of the mortuary meal in which the death of Osiris was com memorated by the eating of the body and the drinki ng of the blood . The Agape, or pha llic feast, was a mode of celebrating the re - arising of Horus, Prince of Sekhe m, as por trayed by the re - erection of the Tat. This accounts for the sexua l orgie of the Agape, a primitiv e form of which was acted by the Eskimo in the festival of reproduc tion. In their mysteries this was the reproduc tion of food. In the Egypt ian it was the regeneration and resurrection of the soul that was celebrated at the Agape. The death, of cour se, came first. This was on the night of the great sacrifice, and the Eucharist was 223 eaten in com memoration. Then follow ed the trium ph in Tattu and the regenesis of the soul , which was acted by the “hol y kiss” or blendi ng of the sexes in the feast of love , as a dramatic rende ring of this uni on betwixt the hum an nature and divine, or of the brother and sister, Shu and Tefnut. In the totemic mysteries of young man making begettal was include d in the modus ope randi , and in this the women invoke d the spirit of the male for the new birth. The pha llic festival of prom iscuous intercour se still survived when the mysteries became religious , whether in Egyp t, Greece, or Rom e. In these Osiris was resuscitated as Horus the onl y begot ten son, the wom en being the begetters o r regenerators. In the evoc ations of Isis and Nepht hys we hear them calling on the lost Osiris to com e back to them in the person of the son. They plead that the lamp of life may be relight ed, or more literally that the wom b may be replenished. “Com e to th ine abode , god An,” they cry. “Belove d of the Adyt um ! Com e to Kha” (a name of pha llic signi ficance), “oh, fructifying Bull.” This is in the beneficent formulæ that were made by the two divine sisters, Isis and Nepht hys , to effect the resurrection of Osiris , which are said to have been com pos ed by them on the twenty - fifth day of the month Koiak, December 22nd. They are magical evoc ations of the god addr essed to the inert Osiris, who is caused to rise again by Isis in his ithypha llic form. Most pathetic in it s primitiveness is the picture of the two divine sisters, or mothers, Isis and Nepht hys , watching by the dead or inert brother who is Osiris in death and Horus in his resurrection, crooni ng their incantations , brood ing bird - like ove r the germ of life in th e egg, and breathing out the very soul of their ow n life in yearning for him, unt il the first toke n of returning cons cious ness is given, the earliest sign of the resurrection is made in respons e to the vitalizing warmth of their affection. These evoc ations follow the night of “the last suppe r” and the battle with Sut and the Sebau. “Oh, com e to thine abode !” the two dear sisters cry. “Com e to thy sister! Com e to thy wife! Com e to thy spous e!” they plead whilst stretching out their longi ng arms for his embra ce. “Oh, excellent Sove reign, com e to thine abode . Rejoice; all thine enemies are anni hilated.

Then was the onl y son of god begot ten of the hol y spirit Ra. The “pai r of soul s” were blende d in the Horus of a soul that was to live for ever, or to taste eternal life. The marriage rite was acted, and the marriage feast was celebrated in this prototypa l ceremony that was cont inue d in the Agape of the Osirian and the Chris tian cult. The Christian dogm a of a phys ical resurrection founde d on the historic fact of a dead corpse rising from the grave can be expl ained as one of the Kamite mysteries which were reproduc ed as miracles in the Gospels. If we take the original represe ntation in the solar mythos , the sun in the unde r - world, the diminished, unvi rile, impot ent 224 or suffering sun was imaged as Ans - Ra, the solar god bound up in linen, as the mum mified Osiris. The type remained for permanent use, but when the transformat ion had been effected the mum my vanished. The sepul chre was empty. The sun of winter or of night did not remain in Hades. Neither did it come forth as the dead body or unbr eathing mum my of Osiris. Osiris, the hidde n god in the earth of Amenta, doe s not com e forth at all except in the person of the risen Horus, who is the manifestor for the ever - hidde n father. To issue thus he makes his transfigur ation which cons titutes the mystery, not the miracle, of the resurrection. Osiris defecates and spiritualizes. Th e mum my as corpus is transubs tantiated into the sahu, the mortal Horus into the immortal, and the phys ical mum my disappe ars. But it did not disappe ar because the living Horus rose up and walked off with the dead body of Osiris. When the transformation took place the type was change d in a mom ent, in the “twinkl ing of an eye.” The mum my Osiris transubs tantiates, and makes his transformation into Osiris - sahu. As the Ritual expresses it, “he is renewed in an instant” in this second birth (ch. 182) . The place wa s empty where the mum my had lain upon the bier, and the body was not found. This change is described when it is said in the litany of Ra, he “raises his soul and hides his body .” Thus the body was hidde n in the resurrection of the soul . “Hiding his body” i s cons eque ntly a name of Horus, “emanating from Hes” as a babe in the renewal of Osiris. Conc ealing the body of dead matter was one way of describing the transubstantiation in texture and the transfigur ation in form. This was one of the greater mysteries. When Horus rent the veil of the tabernacle he had becom e hawk - headed, and cons eque ntly was a spirit in the divine likeness of Ra the hol y ghos t. Therefore the tabernacle was the body or mum my, “the veil of flesh” (Neale, Liturgy of St. Jam es, pp. 46 - 7) fr om which he had emerged. The speaker in the Ritual says, “I am the hawk in the tabernacle, and I pierce through the veil” — that is, when he is inve sted with the soul of Horus and disrobe s himself of the mummy (Rit., ch. 71, Renouf ) or the veil which represe nted the flesh, as did the veil of gauze when folded round the mum my in the pyr amid at Medum . The “hol y veil” was carried in the Christian mysteries, toge ther with the “hol y gifts” and “fans of the spirit,” and this is said to represent “the veil that was wrappe d about the body of the Lord Jesus” (Neale, The Liturgies, Introd., p. 30, “Prayer of the Veil.”) This (in the Liturgy of St. Jam es, Neale, p. 46) is “the veil of the flesh of Christ,” therefore the veil of the body or temple of the spirit that was r ent in the resurrection by Horus when he “pierced through the veil.” He rends or pierces through"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"the veil, saying, “I am the hawk in the tabernacle, and I pierce through the veil. Here is Horus!” who com es forth to the day as a hawk (ch. 71) . In the form o f a divine hawk the risen one is revealed and goe s forth as a spirit. In the Gospel the loud cry is immediately follow ed by the goi ng forth as a spirit. “And behol d, the veil of the sanctuary was rent in twain from the top to the bot tom . And the earth did qua ke, and the rocks were rent and the tom bs were ope ned, and many bod ies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised (Matt. XXVII. 45 - 53) . Horus now takes his seat at the table of his father Osiris, with thos e who eat bread in Annu. He gives breath t o 225 the faithful dead who are raised by him, he who is the resurrection and the life. The same scene is appa rently reproduc ed by John. Jesus makes his appa rition to the disciples at what looks like the evening meal, although the meal is not mentione d. Jesus is the breather. “He breathed on them and said, Receive ye the Holy Spirit” — which in the Ritual is the breath of Atum - Ra, the father, imparted by Iu the son, or by Horus to the faithful dead. The scene has now been change d from Amenta to the earth of Seb by thos e who made “historic” mockery of the Egypt ian Ritual, and sank the meaning out of sight where it has been so long subm erged. More of this hereafter. Enough at present to indi cate the way that things are tendi ng. In this divine drama natural rea lities are represented with no pernicious ly destructive attempt to conc eal the characters unde r a mask of history. Majestically movi ng in their ow n might of pathetic appe al to hum an sym pathy, they are simply represented for what they may be worth when righ tly appr ehende d. But so tremendous was this tragedy in the Osirian mysteries, so heart - melting the legend of divinest pity that lived on with its root age in Amenta and its flow erage in the hum an mind, that an historic travesty has kept the stage and held t he tearful gaze of generation after generation for nineteen hundr ed years. Amenta, the earth of eternity, is the land of the mysteries where Taht, the moon god, in the nether night was the great teacher of the sacred secrets toge ther with the seven wise m asters. The passage through Amenta is a series of initiations for the Osiris deceased. He is induc ted into the mysteries of Rusta (1, 7, 9), the mysteries of the Tuat (130, 27), the mysteries of Akar (148, 2, 3). He know s the mysteries of Nekhe n (113, 1). The deceased invoke s the god who dw ells in all mysteries (14, 1); the deceased learns the mystery of the father god Atum , who becom es his ow n son (15, 46) ; he is the mysterious of form (17, 91) and the mysterious of face, like Osiris (133, 9). “I shine in the egg, ” says the deceased, “in the land of the mysteries.” Chapter 162 cont ains the most secret, most sacred, the greatest of all mysteries. Its name is the book of the hidde n dw elling — that is, the book of Amenta or the ritual of the resurrection. Obscur e as these mysteries may seem, on account of the form – that of dramatic monol ogue and soliloquy – and the brevity of statement, we can recogni ze enough to know that these are the originals of all the other “mysteries,” Gnos tic, Kabalistic, Masoni c, or Christi an. The dogm a of the incarnation was an Egypt ian mystery. Baptismal regeneration, transfigur ation, transubs tantiation, the resurrection and ascension, were all Egypt ian mysteries. The mystery of an ever - virgin mother; the mystery of a boy at twelve years o f age transforming sudde nly into an adul t of thirty years, and then becom ing one with the father, as it had been earlier in the mysteries of totemism; the mystery in which the dead body of Osiris is transubs tantiated"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"into the living Horus by descent of the bird - headed hol y spirit; the mystery of a divine being in three persons , one of which takes flesh on earth as the human Horus, to becom e a mum my as Osiris in Amenta, and to rise up from the dead in spirit as Ra in heaven. These and other miracles of the C hristian faith were already extant among the mysteries of Amenta. But the meaning of the mysteries coul d onl y be know n 226 whilst the genui ne gnos is was authentically taught . This had ceased when the Christian Sarcolatræ took pos session of the “Word - made - flesh,” and literalized the mystical drama as a more tangi ble - look ing hum an history, that was set forth in the very latest of the Gospels as a brand - new revelation sent from God, and persona lly conduc ted in Palestine by the “historic Jesus.” When Bendi go , the pugi list, became conve rted he propos ed to take up preaching as his new profession. And when it was obj ected that he didn’ t know anyt hing and coul dn’ t read or write, he replied that he “expe cted to pick up a good deal by listening round. ” So was it wi th the early Christians. They coul d neither read nor write the ancient langua ge, but they picked up a good deal by listening round. “You have your man upon the cross,” said one of them to the Rom ans; “why do you obj ect to ours?” Their man upon the cross be ing identical with Osiris - Tat or the ass - headed Iu. It is said of Taht as a teacher of the mysteries, “And now behol d Taht in the secret of his mysteries. He maketh pur ifications and endl ess reckoni ngs , piercing the firmament and dissipating the storms aro und him and so it com eth to pass that the Osiris hath reached every station, ” and, we may add, attained his immortality through the teachings com muni cated in the mysteries of Taht (Rit., ch. 130 , Renouf ). The 148t h chapter of the Ritual recount s som e of th e most secret mysteries. It was written to furnish the gnos is or know ledge necessary for the Manes to get rid of his impurities and acqui re perfection in the “bos om of Ra” the hol y spirit. At the entrance to the mysterious valley of the Tuat there is a wa lled - up door way, the first doo r of twelve in the passage of Amenta. These twelve are described in the Book of Hades as twelve divisions correspondi ng to the twelve hour s of darkne ss dur ing the noc turnal journey of the sun. The first division has no visible door of entrance. The rest have ope n door s, and the twelfth has doub le door s. It is hard to enter, but made easy for the exit into the land of eternal life. Here is the mystery: how to enter where there is no doo r and the way is all unknow n? It is expl ain ed to the Manes how divine assistance is to be obt ained. When the stains of life on earth are effaced the strengt h is given for forcing the entrance where there is no door, and in that pow er the Manes penetrates with (or as) the god (Rit., ch. 148 , 2, 3). Thus Horus was the door in the darkne ss, the way where no entrance was seen, the life portrayed for the Manes in death. The secret entrance was one of the mysteries of Amenta. It was know n as “the door of the stone ,” which name was given to their Necropol i s by the peopl e at Siut, the stone that revol ved when the magical word or “ope n sesame” was spoke n. The entrance to the Great Pyramid was conc ealed by means of a mova ble flagstone that turned on a pivot which none but the initiated coul d detect. This, when tilted up, revealed a passage four feet in breadth and three and a half feet in height into the interior of the bui lding.

The means of entrance through what appe ared to be a blank wall was by know ing the secret of the nicely adjusted stone , and this secret was com muni cated to the initiates with the pass - word in the mysteries. 227 Horus begins his work by carryi ng out the divine plans of his father Osiris on earth. He makes firm the battlements to protect Osiris against the assaults of all the pow ers of darkne ss. He makes the word of Osiris truth against his enemies. He oppos es Sut, his father’s adve rsary, to the death. He makes war upon the evil Apap, that old serpent, and ove rthrow s the pow ers that rise up in rebellion, which are called the rebels in the Ritual, who are ever doom ed to failure in the fight betwixt them and the father, who is now represented by Ho rus his belove d son, Horus of the resurrection, who is himself the door in death as the means of entrance to Amenta. He cove rs the naked body of the breathless one . He ope ns the fount ains of refreshm ent for the god of the non - beating heart (ch. 1). He wage s battle on the “eater of the arm” (ch. 11) and the black boa r Sut, two type s of the pow er of dearth, death, and darkne ss. He protects his father from the devour ing crocodi les (ch. 32) , from the serpents Rerek, Seksek, and Haiu, also from the apshait, an i nsect that preys upon the buried mum my (chs. 33, 34, 36). He says, “I have com e myself and delivered the god in his dismembered condi tion. I have healed the trunk and fastened the shoul der and made firm the leg” (ch. 102) , i.e., in recons tructing the mum my . He restores to Osiris his sceptre, his pedestal, and his staircase from the tom b (ch. 128 ). He says, “I have done according to the com mand that I shoul d com e forth in Tattu, to see Osiris” (ch. 78) . He has kept the com mandm ent that was given him by the f ather. The Manes in Amenta tell of “the fortune s of that great son whom the father love th,” and how he had “pierced Sut to the heart,” and how they had “seen the death.” They also tell of the “divine plans which were carried out by Horus, in the absence of his father,” when he represented Osiris on the earth (ch. 78) . With his work accom plished, bot h on earth and in Amenta, Horus of the resurrection goe s to see his father, and they embrace each other. Horus addr esses his father, here called Ra - Unne fer - Osiri s - Ra. He exclaims: “Hail, Osiris! I am thy son Horus; I have com e. I have avenge d thee. I have struck dow n thy enemies. I have destroye d all that was wrong in thee. I have killed him who assailed thee. I stretched forth my hand for thee against thy adve rsa ries. I have brought thee the com panions of Sut with chains upon them. I have ploughe d for thee the fields. I have irrigated for thee thy land. I have hoe d for thee the ground. I have bui lt for thee the lakes of water. I have turned up the soil of thy pos s essions . I have made sacrifices for thee of thy cattle and thy victims. I have bound thy enemies in their chains. I have sow ed for thee wheat and barley in the field of Aarru. I have mow ed them there for thee. I have glorified thee. I have anoi nted thee wi th the offering of hol y oil. I have established for thee thy offerings of food on the earth for ever.” (Rit., ch. 173, excerpt from Naville’s rende ring in Renouf ’s Book of the Dead.) All this and more he claims to have done . “I have given thee Isis and Nep hthys .” The two divine sisters, the cons orts of Osiris, the mothers and protectors of Horus, are thus brought back by him to the father.

They are with him when he ascends to the father as conque ror of death, as ruler of the doubl e earth and lord of the kingdom which he and his disciples or children have established for ever. The work attribut ed to Horus, the divine exemplar, was to be fulfilled by his follow ers in the doubl e earth of time and eternity. That was the obj ect of the mysteries. It is in the character of t he divine Horus that the hum an Nebseni says to Osiris, “Thou one God, behol d me. I am Horus thy son. I have fought for thee. I have fought on thy behalf for justice, truth, and right eous ness. I have ove rcom e thine adve rsaries.” He also claims to have done the things that Horus did as set forth in the writings or represented in the drama, and thus fulfilled the ideal of self - sacrificing sons hip in very reality, making the word of Osiris truth against his enemies. And it was but the word even when personi fied , which to be of any actual efficacy must be made truth in hum an life, in conduc t, and in character (Pap. of Nebseni, Rit., ch. 173 , Budge ). If there be any revelation or inspiration in a great ideal dramatically por trayed, the Egypt ians found it in their divine mode l set forth in Horus: Horus the saviour, who was brought to birth As light in heaven and sustenance on earth. Horus in spirit, verily divine, Who came to turn the water into wine. Horus, who gave his life, and sowed the seed For men to make the bread of life indeed. Horus the comforter, who did descend In human fashion as the heavenly friend. Horus the word, the founder in his youth. Horus, fulfiller as the word made truth. Horus the lord and leader in the fight Against the dark powers of the ancient night. Horus the suffe rer with his cross bowed down, Who rose at Easter with his double crown. Horus the pioneer, who paved the way Of resurre ction to eternal day. Horus triumphant with the battle d one, Lord of two worlds, united and made one. It was the obj ect of their loftiest desires to grow in his likeness whilst looki ng lovi ngl y upon his features, listening to his word, and fulfilling his character in their ow n persona l lives. A mythical mo del may be no more than an air - blow n bladde r for learning to swim by. The reality lies in learning to swim. This was how the ideal Horus served the Egypt ians. They did not expe ct him to swim for them and carry them and their belongi ngs as well, but learned to swim for themselves. There is not hing in all poe try cons idered as the flower of human reality more pathetic than the figure of Horus in Sekhe m.

It is a com mon Christian belief, cont inua lly iterated, that life and immortality were brought to light , and death, the last enemy, was destroye d, by a persona l Jesus onl y nineteen centuries ag o, whereas the same revelation had been accredited to Horus the anoi nted and to Iu - su the com ing son for thous ands of years before, with Horus or Iu - su as the impersona l and ideal revealer who was the Messiah in the astronom ical mythol ogy and the Son of Go d in the eschatology. The doc trine of immortality is so ancient in Egypt that the “Book of Vivifying the Soul for Ever,” “said ove r a figure of the enlightened dead,” was not only extant som e 6,000 years ago in the time of Husapti, fifth king of the first dyna sty, it was then so old that the true tradition of interpretation was at that time already lost. The Egypt ian Christ - Jesus or Horus, as revealer of immortality, was the ideal figure of a fact know n to the ancient spiritualists, that the soul of man or the Manes persisted beyond death and the dissolution of the present body, and the drama of the mysteries was their modus ope randi for teaching the fact, with Horus (or Iu - su) as typi cal manifestor. In this character he was set forth as the first fruits of them that slept, the onl y one that came forth from the mummy on earth, as the sahu mum my in Amenta; the onl y one , how ever, as a type that prefigur ed pot ential cont inui ty for all, the doc trine being founde d on the ghos t as the phe nom enal appa rition of an et ernal reality. The Egypt ians, who were the author s of the mysteries and mythical representation, did not pervert the meaning by an ignor ant literalization of mystical matters, and had no fall of man to encount er in the fallacious Christian sense. Cons eque ntly they had no need of a redeemer for the effects of that which had never occurred. They did not rejoice ove r the death of their suffering saviour because his agony and shame and bloody sweat were falsely suppos ed to rescue them from the cons eque nces of broke n laws; on the cont rary, they taught that everyone created his ow n karma here, and that the past deeds made the future fate. The morality was a thous andf old loftier and nobl er than that of Christianity, with its delusive doc trine of vicarious atone men t and propi tiation by proxy. Horus did such or such things for the glory of his father, but not to save the soul s of men from having to do them. There was no vicarious salvation or imput ed right eous ness. Horus was the justifier of the right eous , not of the wicked. He did not com e to save sinne rs from taking the troub le to save themselves. He was an exemplar, a mode l of the divine sons hip; but his follow ers must conf orm to his example, and do in life as he had done before they coul d claim any fellow ship with him in death.

Its real origin, like thos e of the other Egypt ian dogm as and doc trines, was purely natural; it was prehistorical and non - persona l, and as the mystery of Horus and his virgin mother, who were equa lly prehistorical and non - historical, it had been the central mystery of the Egypt ian faith for ages, utilized by the ancient teachers for all it ever was or coul d be worth, and was cont inue d by the teachers of historic Christianity in ignor ance of its origin and only true signi ficance, or with a criminally culpable suppr ession of the gnos is by which alon e the inexpl icable latter - day mysteries coul d have been expl ained. The primitive mysteries were founde d on the facts in nature which are verifiable to - day as from the first, whereas the mysteries of the Christian theology have been manuf actured, shoddy - li ke, from the leavings of the past by the modus ope randi of miracle. These remain to - day unve rified because they are for ever unve rifiable. We know how Horus came by water on his papyrus; how then did he com e by blood? The child had been incorpor ated in the fish, the shoot , the branch, the beetle, calf, or lamb, as the representative type ; and in his incarnation Horus came by blood, but not by the blood shed on a tree, or the tat - cross. He came to earth by blood as representative of the human soul that came by blood . The Ritual tells us that the gods issued out of silence (ch. 24). This was por trayed in the Osirian system when the infant Horus is depicted poi nting with his finge r to his mout h, making the sign of silence as it was unde rstood in all the mysteri es. Horus is not the ordinary child or kha rt of the hierogl yphi cs. He images the logos , the word of silence, the virgin’s word, that gave a dum b or inarticulate utterance to the mystery of the incarnation. The doc trine of the incarnation had been evol ved a nd established in the Osirian religion at least 4,000 and pos sibly 10, 000 years before it was pur loined and perverted in Christianity. It was so ancient that the sour ce and origin had been forgot ten and the direct means of proof lost sight of or obl iterate d except amongs t the gnos tics, who sacredly preserved their fragm ents of the ancient wisdom , their type s and sym bol s and no doubt , with 231 here and there a copy of som e chapters of the Book of the Dead done into Greek or Aramaic by Alexandr ian scribes. The doc trine of salvation by the blood of Isis connot ed the idea of com ing into existence by means of the mother’s blood, or mystically the blood of the virgin mother. In primitive biology all birth and produc tion of hum an life was first"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"derived from the m other’s blood , which was afterwards informed by the soul of the fatherhood. The lesson first taught by nature was that life came by blood. Procreation coul d not occur unt il the female was pube scent. Therefore blood was the sign of sour ce as the primary cre ative hum an element. Child - Horus came by the blood of the virgin Isis, in that and no other way. Jesus, the gnos tic Christ, also came by blood that way, not onl y according to the secret doc trine of John, for the Musselmans have preserved a fragm ent of the true gnos is. In the not es to ch. 96 of the Koran, Sale quot es the Arabic tradition that Jesus was not bor n like any other men from blood conc reted into flesh, but came in the flow , or in the flow ing blood — that was, in the virgin’s blood first persona lized in Horus, who was made flesh as the virgin’s child. The doc trine of the incarnation was depende nt on the soul of life originating in the mother blood, the first that was held specifically and exclusively hum an on account of its incarnation. This was the so ul derived from a mother who was the mystical virgin in biology , and who was afterwards mystified by theology as the mother of god, the eternal virgin typi fied in the likeness of the totemic. The blood mother had been cogni zed sociologi cally as the virgin. Thence came the doc trine of a virgin mother as a type . Blood was the mother of a soul now differentiated from the external soul s as hum an. First the white vul ture of the virgin Neith, next the red heifer of the virgin Isis, then the hum an virginity, suppl ied the type of an eternal virgin, she in whom the mystery of maternal sour ce was divinized as the virgin mother in the eschatology. Thus “incarnation” prope r begins with the soul that came into being by means of the virgin blood . This was the child of th e mother onl y, the unbe got ten Horus, who was an imperfect first sketch of the soul in matter that assum ed the form of hum an persona lity as Horus the mortal, who was blind and maimed, deaf and dum b and impot ent, because it was a birth of matter or the mothe r onl y, according to the mythical representation. The mother being the sour ce and sustenance of life with her ow n blood, this led to a doc trine of salvation by the blood of Isis the divinized virgin. Thus the mystical blood mother was the earliest saviour , not the male. The elder Horus was her child who came by blood. He was her blood child in the eschatology; hence the calf, as his type , was painted red upon the tablets. As the Child - Horus he was an image of her suffering in the hum an form; thence Horus th e child of blood became a saviour through suffering, in a mystery which had a natural origin. This origin can be follow ed in the Christian iconogr aphy when, as Didron show s, a figur e of Jesus was por trayed upon the cross, as a little child of two years, na ked, and with its body painted red all ove r, as was the Horus - calf upon the tablets. A curious instance of salvation by the blood of Isis is given in the Ritual. In a vigne tte to ch. 93, the saving and protecting pow er of the red tet - buc kle, which 232 is an image of the blood of Isis, is show n. A pair of hum an hands are out stretched from this amulet to grasp the arms of the Manes and prevent him from going tow ard the east, as that way lies the tank of flame, or hell in mode rn phr ase. In the Gospel account of the incarnation the “word” was “made flesh,” but the blood basis of the doc trine has been om itted. Salvation through the blood of Isis was imaged by the red tet - amulet that was put on by her when she had conc eived her blood child. This salvation was ef fected when"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"the child was brought into existence. According to the Ritual, the salvation of the Manes is in living on hereafter. He pleads that he may live and be saved after death (ch. 41), and he wore the tet - buc kle in his coffin as the sign of his salva tion by the blood of Isis. Further, how did a purificatory pow er com e to be associated with blood so that one of the hor rible dogm as of later theology coul d be expr essed in lines like these: — “There is a fountain filled with blood Drawn fro m I mmanuel’s veins, And sinners plunged beneath that flood Lose all their guilty stains”? The natural genesis of such a mons trous doc trine can be traced on two lines of descent. One of these has its starting - poi nt in the theologi cal victim being slain as a scapegoa t in a sacrifice that was held to be piacular. The blood of the sin offering thus acqui red the character of the atoni ng blood . According to the Christian doc trine, “All things are cleansed with blood, and apart from the sheddi ng of bloo d there is no remission” (Heb. IX. 22). On the other line of descent, the idea of purification by blood was derived from a hum an origin, and not merely from the blood of the animal that was slain as a sacrifice for sin. This is one of the origins that were unf olded to the initiated by the teachers of the secret wisdom in the mysteries. The earliest form of the purifying blood was female. It was first the blood of the virgin mother, the blood of Isis, the blood of the incarnation, the flow ing blood , the elem ent in which Horus manifested when he came by blood , the blood on which the rite of pur ification was founde d as a natural mode of cleansing. This is the one sole origin in the whol e realm of nature for the blood which cleanseth, and it was in this feminine pha se that a doc trine of pur ification by blood was established for the use of later theology when the sacrificial victim had been made a male who was held to have shed the atoni ng, purifying, saving blood upon a tree. There was no other way by which a sou l was ever saved by blood than this act of salvation effected by the virgin mother. There never was any other incarnation than this of Horus in the blood of Isis, and no other saviour by blood was pos sible in the whol e dom ain of unpe rverted nature. Neither coul d the transaction be made historical, nor the saviour persona l, not if every tree on earth were cut into the figur e of a cross with the effigy of a bleeding human body hung on every bough. Purification by means of blood then originated in the blood of Isis, the virgin mother of the hum an Horus, who, as the red child, calf or lamb, persona ted that pur ification by blood which became doc trinal in the eschatology. To subs titute the blood of a Jew shed on a cross as a 233 means of making the pur ification for sins and the mode of cleansing soul s in the “blood of the lamb” for the natural pur ification of the mother was the grossest form of profanity, inconc eivably impious to thos e who knew the mystical nature of the doc trine and its origin in hum an phe nom ena cont inue d as a typi cal pur ification by blood that was practised in the mysteries, either by baptism or sprinkl ing with blood , or drinki ng blood, or eating the “bloody wafer” of the Rom an Eucharist. The natural blood sacrifice was feminine. The typi cal blo od sacrifice was that of the red calf, the lamb, or the child. The lamb on the cross was the Christian victim until the eight h century A.D. , at which time the man was permanently subs tituted for the lamb, and the blood sacrifice was thenceforth"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"por trayed a s hum an and historical. A doc trine of volunt ary sacrifice was founde d from the time when the hum an mother gave herself to be eaten with honour by her children in the most primitive form of the mortuary meal. She offered her flesh to be eaten and her blood to be drunk; she gave herself as a natural blood sacrifice on which the typi cal was founde d when the female totem as a cow , a bear, or other animal was made a subs titute for the hum an mother. Also, when the earth was looke d upon as the mythical mother of food and drink who was a wet - nur se in the water, and who gave herself bodi ly to her children for food , the sacrifice was typi cally cont inued in totemism when the animal suppl ied the sacramental food. As before show n, the earliest form of vol unt ary sacrific e was female. The hum an mother as victim was repeated in the mythol ogy as divine, the mother in elemental nature; she who gave her flesh and blood as life to her children was then cont inue d as a type in the more mystical pha se. Hence came salvation by the blood of Isis — that is, by the virgin blood in which Horus was incarnated and made flesh, as the saviour who thus came by blood. A Spaniard, who was paying expe nsively to regain the lost favour of the Holy Virgin, on being told by his priest that Mary had not yet forgiven him, is said to have shaken his fist in the face of his fetish and to have reminde d her that she need not be so proud in her present pos ition, as he had know n her ever since she was onl y a bit of green plum tree. The ancient Egypt ians kne w the natural origins of their sym bol s and dogm as. Christians have mistaken the bit of green plum tree for an historical virgin. The earliest form of god the father who became a vol unt ary sacrifice in Egypt was Ptah in the character of Sekari, the silent s ufferer, the coffined one , the deity that ope ned up the nether - world for the resurrection in the solar mythos . As solar god he went dow n into Amenta. There he died and rose again, and thus became the resurrection and the way into a future life as founde r o f Egypt ian eschatology. Atum the son of Ptah likewise became the vol unt ary sacrifice as the sour ce of life, but in anot her way and more appa rent form. The mother hum an and divine had given life with her blood, and now the father, who was blende d with the m other in Atum, is por trayed as creator of manki nd by the sheddi ng of his ow n blood. In the cult of Ptah at Memphi s and Atum at On there was a strenuous ende avour made to set creative sour ce as male above the female. Hence it was said of the sym bol ic beetl es that there was 234 “no female race among them” (Hor - Apol lo, B. I, 10). In cutting the member, Atum show ed that he was the creator by the blood shed in a vol unt ary sacrifice. Male sour ce is recogni zed, but according to what had preceded as the mother e lement, blood still remained a typi cal essence of creative life. And this is appa rently illustrated by the rite of circum cision. The custom pertains, world ove r, to the swearing - in of the yout hs when they join the ranks of the fathers or begetters and foll ow the example of Atum as the father, Ra, who was previous ly Horus the son. Atum, like Ptah, was also the typi cal sacrifice in the earth of eternity, who gave his life as sun god and as the master of food that sprang up for the Manes in Amenta. Osiris foll ow s. In him the human mother who first gave herself to be eaten, and the great mother Isis, who was the saviour by blood , were com bined with god the father in a more com plete and perfect sacrifice as mother"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"and father of the race in one . Lastly, the son as Horus or as Iusa is made a vicarious sacrifice, not , how ever, as an atone ment for sin, but as vol unt ary sufferer instead of his mother or his father. For in the Kamite scheme the mother never is om itted. Hence, when Horus com es in the character of the red god who orders the block of execution with the terrifying face of Har - Shefi, as the avenge r of the afflictions suffered by his father (or by himself in his first adve nt), it is he “who lifteth up his father and who lifteth up his mother with his staff” (R it., ch. 92, Renouf ). Egypt , how ever, had anticipated Rom e in attaining the “unbl oody sacrifice” that was represented by the wafer, or loaf, of Horus as the bread of heaven, which took the place of flesh meat in the Eucharistic meal, whilst retaining the b eer or wine, as subs titute for blood , in representing the female element. Thus Horus was eaten as the bread of life, and his blood was drunk in the red ale, or wine, as the final form in Egypt of the sacrificial, volunt ary, living victim that had been the hum an mother, the typi cal mother, the totemic animal, the cow of Hathor, the fish, the goos e, the calf, the lamb, the victim in various forms, each one of which, dow n to the lentils and the corn, was figurative of the beneficent sacrifice that from the fir st was typi cal of a pow er in nature, call it mother or son, father, godde ss or god , that provi ded food and drink, accom panied with an idea of sacrifice in the giving of life when blood was looke d on as the life. “How many sacraments hath Christ ordained i n His Chur ch?” is asked in the Prayer - book , and the answer is, “Two onl y as generally necessary to salvation — that is to say, baptism and the suppe r of the Lord.” And bot h of these were Egypt ian thous ands of years earlier. The proof is preserved in that tre asury of truth, the Ritual of the resurrection. In the first chapter of the Ritual (Turin Papyr us) it is said by the priest, “I lustrate with water in Tattu and anoi nt with oil, in Abydos .” We might call the Egypt ians very Particular Baptists for in the fi rst ten gates of Elysium or entrances to the great dw elling of Osiris the deceased is pur ified at least ten times ove r in ten separate baptisms, and ten different waters in which the god s and godde sses had been washed to make the water hol y (Ritual, ch. 14 5). The inunda tion was the water of renewal to the life of Egypt , and this natural fact was the course and origin of a doc trine of baptismal regeneration. The salvation that came to Egypt in the 235 Nile was cont inue d in the Egypt ian eschatology as salva tion by water. “I give thee the liqui d or hum idity which ensures salvation, ” is said to the soul of the deceased (Rit., 155, 1). They did not think that soul s were saved from perdition by a wash of water or a bath of blood, but bodi ly baptism was cont inue d as a sym bol of pur ification for the spirit. The deceased expl ains that he has been steeped in the waters of natron and nitre, or salt, and made pur e — pur e in heart, pur e in his forepart, his pos terior part, his middle, and pur e all ove r, so that there is n o part of him remaining soiled or stained. The pool of baptism is dua l in Amenta. In one part it is the pool of natron, in the other the pool of salt. Both natron and salt were used in preparing the mum my of the deceased, and the same process is repeated i n the purification of the soul to make it also permanent, which was a mode of salvation. The deceased says, “May I be fortified or protected by seventy pur ifications ” (Mariette, Mon. divers, pl. 63, f), just as Christians at the present time speak of being “fortified by the sacraments of the Chur ch.” “I purify myself at the great stream (the"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"galaxy) , where all my ills are made to cease; that which is wrong in me is pardone d, and the spot s which were upon my body upon earth are washed away” (Rit., ch. 86). “ Lo, I com e, that I may pur ify this soul of mine in the most high degree. Let me be purified in the lake of propi tiation and of equi poi se. Let me plunge into the divine pool beneath the two divine sycamores of heaven and earth” (ch. 97, Renouf ). The pool of purification and healing that was figur ed in the nor thern heaven at the pol e, and also reproduc ed in the paradise of Amenta, has been repeated in the Gospel according to John (ch. 5) as the Pool of Bethesda. In the Ritual (ch. 124 , part 3) one of two wate rs is called the pool or tank of right eous ness. In this pool the glorified elect receive their final pur ification and are healed. They are thus made pure for the presence of Osiris. The healing process was timed to take place at certain hour s of the night or day. The Turin text gives the fourth hour of the night and the eight h hou r of the day. But there are other readings . The Manes, as usual in the gos pels, are represented by the “multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, and withered,” waiting to be healed. The elect or chos en one s are those who are first at the pool when the waters are troubl ed. Hence the story of the man who was non - elect. It was a pos tulate of the Christians, maintained by Augus tine and others, that infants who died unba ptized wer e damned eternally. This doc trine also had its root age in the mysteries of Amenta. The root s have hitherto been hidde n in the earth of eternity which has been mistaken for our earth of time. We are now enabled to exhi bit them above ground and hol d bot h roo t and produc t up to the light like the bul b of a hya cinth suspende d in a glass water - bot tle. These can now be studi ed, root s and all. The flesh that is formed of the mother’s blood was held to share in the impurity of the female nature. It was in this sens e solely that wom an was the author of evil. The Child - Horus bor n of flesh and blood was the prototype of the unba ptized child — that is, the child unpur ified by baptism. Withou t baptismal regeneration in Tattu there was no blendi ng of the elder Horus with th e soul or spirit of Horus divinized. According 236 to the Egypt ian doc trine, the developm ent woul d be arrested and the soul from the earthly body might remain a wretched shade that was doo med to extinction, or, in the Christian perversion, was damned ete rnally. It was in Amenta that the dead were raised to inhe rit the second life. The resurrection had no other meaning for the Egypt ians. And in the resurrection the Osiris is thus greeted: “Hail, Osiris! thou art bor n twice! The gods say to thee: ‘Com e! com e forth; com e see what belongs to thee in thy hous e of eternity’” (ch. 170) . It is then that he is change d and renewed in an instant. In blendi ng the two halves of a soul that was dua l in sex, dua l also in matter and spirit, into one , according to the mys tery of Tattu, there was a return to the type beyond sex from which the two had bifurcated in the hum an creation. This one endur ing soul was typi cal of the eternal soul which include d motherhood and fatherhood in one persona lity like that of the multimamma lian Osiris which the Child - Horus coul d onl y represent in som e form of dua lity that imaged bot h sexes in one , as do the deities who are figured with one female bos om as a mode of en - one ment. Female mum mies have been exhum ed that were made up wearing the be ard of a male. This was anot her figur e of the soul com pleted by uni ting the two halves of sex in one figur e, the type affected by the Queen Hatshepsu when she clothed herself in masculine attire and reigne d"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"as Mistress Aten. It was the same with the Pharao hs who wore the tail of the cow or lione ss. They also include d bot h halves of the perfect soul , as a likeness of the biune being divinized in heaven which they represented on the earth. The doc trine was brought on in the iconogr aphy of the gnos tic artists when Jesus is figur ed as a wom an with a beard, who is designa ted the Christ as Saint Sophi a (or Charis) (Didron, fig. 50), and also when Jesus is depicted in the Book of Revelation as a being of bot h sexes, a yout h with female paps; in the likeness of Osir is, whos e male body is half cove red with female mammæ, and who is Osiris in the uppe r and Isis in the low er part of the same mum my. Not onl y was it necessary to be regenerated and rebor n in the likeness of god the father; the Manes coul d onl y enter the kin gdom of heaven as a being of bot h sexes or of neither. The two halves of the soul that were established for ever in Tattu were male and female; the soul of Shu was male, the soul of Tefnut female. When these were uni ted in one to form a com pleted Manes and a perfect spirit the result was a typi cal creation from bot h sexes in which there was neither male nor female. This one ness, in the Horus who was divinized, is the one ness in Christ described by Paul: “As many of you as were baptized into Christ, did put on Christ. There can be no male nor female, for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.” One of the fragm ents preserved by Clement Alexande r and Clement of Rom e from the lost “gos pel of the Egypt ians,” which is more than fully recove rable in the Ritual, will show the cont inui ty of the doc trine as Egypt ian in a gos pel that was designa ted “Egypt ian.” The Lord having been asked by Salom e when his kingdom woul d com e, replied, “when you shall have trampled und er foot the garment of shame; When two shall be one , when tha t which is without shall be like that which is within, and when the male with the female shall be neither male nor female.” The “garment of 237 shame” was feminine, being as it was of the flesh. On this the Ritual has a word to say. The impur ity of matte r which came to be ascribed to the mother of all flesh, or female nature, is sym bol ically show n in the chapters for arrangi ng the fune ral bed (Rit., chs. 170 - 171) . This is exemplified by means of the feminine garment – the apron – which is here cons idered to b e a sign of all that was wrong in the deceased; the wrong that was derived from the mother, as elsewhere described in the Ritual, because it is the garb of impurity called “the garment of shame” in the Egypt ian gos pel, which was to be trampled unde r foot w hen the male and female were to be made one in spirit, or as spirit. In the ceremony of “wrappi ng up the deceased in a pure garment,” the impur e one being now discarded is allude d to in ch. 172 . When the deceased was stretched upon the fune ral bed the body was divested of the apr on and clothed in the pure garment of the khus or spirits, “the pur e garment allotted to him for ever” (Rit., ch. 171) . But the feminine garment is still worn without shame by the masque rading male as the bishop’ s apron, which can b e traced back as feminine to the loin - cloth and apron first worn by the sex for the most primitive and pitiful of hum an needs at the time of pube rty. The bishop in his apron, like the priest in his petticoat and the clergyman in his surplice, is a likeness of the biune being who uni ted bot h sexes in one ; the mode rn Protestant equi valent for the Pharaoh with the cow ’s tail, and Venus with a beard, the mutilated eunuc h, or any other dua l type of hermaphr odital deity. Men who masque rade in wom en’s clothing are com monl y prosecuted, but the bishop carries on his mum mery without even being suspected. He walks about as"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"ignor ant of his vestmental origins as any of the passers by. Usually the custom of men dressing in wom en’s clothing is limited to our Easter pastime s, but the bishops still carry it on all through the year. The Christians prattle about the divine “sons hip of hum anity,” manifested in the historical Jesus. But they have no divine daught ership, no origin for the soul as female and no female soul . The Je ws did all they coul d to get rid of the female part of the divine nature, and the exigency of the Christian history has suppr essed the feminine element altoge ther in the hum an type that represented bot h sexes in hum anity as it was set forth by the Egypt ian s in the mysteries. Finally, it has been freque ntly asserted that onl y through the Gospel Jesus has a god of the poo r man ever been revealed — a statement most profoundl y false. A god of the poo r and suffering was personi fied in Horus the elder. But there is a corollary to the character. He is likewise an avenge r of the sufferings . Horus at Edfu is said to protect the needy against the pow erful. Also, in the great Judgm ent Hall the Osiris deceased upon his trial says, “I have not been a land - grabbe r. I have n ot exacted more than shoul d be done for me as the first fruits of each day’s work” (Rit., ch. 125) . Various other statements tend to show that the unj ust capitalists of thos e times had a mortal dread of facing Osiris the divinized judge , who was likewise g od of the poor and needy. In an Egypt ian hymn the one god, Atum the maker of men, is described as “lying awake while all men lie asleep, to seek out the good of his 238 creatures” (line 12) , “listening to the poor in their distress, gentle of heart when one cries to him. Deliverer of the timid man from the violent, lord of mercy most lovi ng, judgi ng the poor , the poo r and the oppr essed” (Hym n to Amen - Ra, Records, vol . II, p. 129) . Taht was the recorder in the Judgm ent Hall. At the weighing of hearts he po rtrayed the character of the deceased, and in one of the texts it is said that when he placed the heart in the scales against Maati, the godde ss of justice, he leaned to the side of mercy, that the judgm ent might be favour ably inclined, as though he exerte d a little pressure on the hum an side of the balance. It has also been said that the historic Jesus came to glorify the lot of labour , which antiqui ty despised, whereas the Egyptian paradise was the reward of labour , and Horus the hus bandm an in the harves t - field of the Aarru is the worker personi fied. No one attained the Egypt ian heaven but the worker, who reaped solely in propor tion as he had sow n. The portion of land allotted to the Manes for cultivation in Amenta was enlarged onl y for thos e who had been good labour ers on earth. The Shebti figur es in the tom bs are equi ppe d for labour with the plough or hoe in their hands . As agriculturists they put their hands to the plough . There was no une arned increment for loafers in the earth of eternity. A flash of revelation light ens from the cloud of Egypt ’s past when we learn from the Ritual that a part of the work to be performed in the Aarru paradise or field of harvest in Amenta was to clear away the life - choki ng sand. These fight ers and conque rors of the much - detested desert still retain that image of the earliest cultivators, the makers of the soil which they enclosed and first protected from the drifting, sterilizing sand. The Manes, addr essing the Shebti figures, says to them, “O typi cal one s! If I shoul d be judge d worthy of doi ng the work that has to be done in Amenta, bear witness for me that I am worthy to fertilize the fields, to flush the streams,"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"and transpor t the sand from west to east” (Rit., ch. 6). He became one of the glorified elect in being judge d worthy of the work. This will show that in making the primeval paradise they were still the cultivators who had conque red on earth by their long wrestle with the pow ers of dearth in the desert when they made their passage through the wilderness of sand a nd held on to the skirts of Mother Nile, who led them to a land which she herself had made for them to turn into an oasis and a paradise of plenty with her waters for assistance in the war against Apap, or Sut, the Sebau, and the bur ning Sahara. It may als o expl ain why the Pharaohs from the time of the eleventh dyna sty were officially entitled “Masters of the Oasis,” the oasis, that is, which had been created in Egypt by hum an labour to be localized in Amenta as the prom ised land that was to be attained at last among the never - setting stars in the oasis of eternity. The prototype s of hell and pur gatory and the earthly paradise are all to be found in the Egypt ian Amenta. There is, says the Christian rhym er, Dr. Watts: “There is a dreadful hell An d everlasting pains, Where sinners must with devils dwell In darkness, fire, and chains.” 239 The darkne ss, fire, and chains, as well as the brimstone , which was the stone of Sut, and other paraphe rnalia of the Christian hell, are also Egypt ian. But the chains were employe d for the fettering of Sut, the Apap, and the Sebau, the evil adve rsaries of Osiris, the good or perfect being, not for the torturing of soul s that onc e were hum an. The Egypt ian hell was not a place of everlasting pain, but of extinction for thos e who were wicked irretrievably. It must be adm itted, to the honour and glory of the Christian deity, that a god of eternal torment is an ideal distinctly Christian, to which the Egypt ians never did attain. Theirs was the all - parental god , Father and Mother in one whos e heart was thought to bleed in every wound of suffering hum anity, and whos e son was represented in the character of the Com forter. Also the hell - fire of Christian theology , the hell - fire that is unque nchable (Mark IX. 4 3, 44) , is a survival of the representation made in the Egypt ian mysteries. The Osiris in Amenta passes through this hell of fire in which thos e who are conde mned suffer their anni hilation. He says, “I enter in and I com e forth from the tank (or lake) of f lame on the day when the adve rsaries are anni hilated at Sekhe m” (Rit., ch. 1). When the glorified deceased had made his voya ge in heaven “ove r the leg of Ptah,” and reached the mount of glory, he exclaims, “I have com e from the lake of flame, from the lake of fire and from the field of flame.” He has made his escape from destruction, and attained the eternal city at the pol e of heaven. This lake of fire that is never que nched was derived from the solar force in the mythol ogy on which the eschatology was bas ed. Hence the locality was in the east, at the place of sunr ise. The wicked were cons um ed by fire at the place where the right eous entered the solar bark to sail the heavenly waters called the Kabhu, or the cool , and voya ge westward tow ard the heaven of th e setting stars. The lake of flame was in the east, the lake of out er darkne ss in the west. For when the bark of Ra or the boa t of soul s had reached the west at suns et there was a great gul f fixed between the mount called Manu in the west and the starry va ult of night, the gul f of Putrata (Rit., ch. 44) , where the dead fell into darkne ss unl ess suppor ted by Apua t the star - god , by"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Horus in the moon , and by Ra the solar deity, the visible representatives of supe rhum an pow ers in the astronom ical mythol ogy. At the “last judgm ent” in the mysteries thos e who had failed to make the word of Osiris truth against his enemies, as the formula runs , were doom ed to die a second death. The first was in the body on the earth, the second in the spirit. The enemies of justic e, law, truth, and right were doom ed to be destroye d for ever in the lake of fire or tank of flame. They were anni hilated onc e for all (Rit., ch. 1). The doc trine crops up in the Pauline Epistles and in Revelation, where the end of all is with a destructio n in the lake of fire. In the Epistle to the Hebrews the destruction of lost soul s is com pared with that of vegetable matter being cons um ed by fire. The doc trine, like so many others, was Egypt ian, upon which the haze of ignor ance settled dow n, to cause co nfusion ever since. Take away the Kamite devil, and the Christian world woul d suffer sad bereavement. The devil was of Egypt ian origin, bot h as “that old serpent” the Apap reptile, the devil with a long tail, and as Sut, who was Satan in an anthropo morphi c gui se. Sut, the pow er of drought and darkne ss in 240 phys ical phe nom ena, becom es the dark - hearted evil one , and is then described as causing storms and tempests, goi ng round the horizon of heaven “like one whos e heart is veiled” (Rit., ch. 39, Renouf ), as the adve rsary of Osiris the Good Being. The darkne ss, fire, and chains are all Egypt ian. Darkne ss was mythically represented by the Apap dragon , also as the dom ain of Sut in the later theology . Darkne ss in the nether world is identical with the tunne ls of Sut in Amenta. The chains are likewise Egypt ian, but not for hum an wear. Apap and the Sebau, Sut and the Sami are bound in chains. It is said to the pre - anthropom orphi c devil, “Chains are cast upon thee by the scorpion godde ss” (Rit., ch. 39) . Sut is al so imprisone d with a chain upon his neck (ch. 108 ). As already expl ained, the Sebau and the Sami represent the phys ical forces in external nature that made for evil and were for ever oppos ed to the Good Being and to the peace of the world. These were alway s rising in impot ent revol t as the hos ts of darkne ss and spawn of Apap, headed by the evil - hearted Sut. They had to be kept unde r; hence the necessity for prisons , bonds , and chains. The mythical imagery has been cont inued in the Christian eschatology, and the sinne rs put in the place of the Sebau, whereas in the Egyp tian teaching the sinne rs, onc e hum an, who were irretrievably bad, were put an end to onc e for all, at the time of the second death, in the region of anni hilation (Rit., ch. 18) . Com ing to an e nd for ever was, to the Egypt ian mind, a prospect worse than everlasting pains, so profound was their appr eciation of life, so pow erful their will to persist. They represented evil as negation. Apap is evil and a type of negation in the natural phenom ena t hat were oppos ed to good . In the eschatology Sut represents negation as non - existence. Evil culminated in anni hilation and non - being for the Manes, and the negation of being, of life, of good , was the ultimate form of evil. The Egypt ian pur gatory, called t he Meskat, is a place of pur gation where the primitive mode of purifying may be com pared with that of Fulling. It is effected by beating. Hence the Meskat is the place of scour ging. The Manes pleads that he may not fall unde r the kni ves of the executione rs in the place of extermination, as he has “pas sed through the place of pur ification in the middl e of the Meskat.” In chapter 72 the Manes prays that he may “not be stoppe d at the Meskat,” or in pur gatory, but may"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"pass on to the divine dw elling - place prepar ed for him by Tum “above the earth,” where he can “join his two hands toge ther,” and eat the bread and drink the beer upon the table of Osiris. The same plea, “Let me not be stoppe d at the Meskat,” or kept in pur gatory, is also uttered by the speaker in ch apter 99. The enemies of the Good Being were likewise pilloried. Hence the Manes says, “Deliver me from the gods of the pillory, who fasten (the gui lty) to their pos ts” (ch. 180 ). A late attempt has been made on behalf of the Roman Cathol ic religion to lu re peopl e into Hades by show ing that it is onl y a mitigated mour ning department; that the devil himself is not so black as hitherto painted; and that there is really a tolerable amount of happi ness to be obt ained in hell. But this is onl y looki ng a little closer into the traditions of Amenta which survived in Rom e. They belong to the same original sour ce as that from which the Chur ch derived its doc trines of pur gatory, the second death, and other 241 dogm as not to be found in the Gospels. There is no ever lasting bonf ire of eternal torture in the Egypt ian hells, of which there are ten, know n as the ten circles of the conde mned, in the inferno or divine nether region. The utterly worthless suffer a second death upon the highw ays of the damned, and are spoke n of as thos e who are no more. The Rom an Chur ch cont inue d the dogm a of a second death, and then som ewhat nul lified it by addi ng puni shm ent of an infinite duration, as being more coercive to all who did or did not zealous ly believe. There was no other identi fiable sour ce for the Christian eschatology than the Egypt ian wisdom . The Rom an Chur ch was founde d on the Ritual. Possibly a version of the original may one day be found preserved in the secret archives of Rom e, the text of which woul d expl ain num erous pic tures in the Catacom bs and other works of the gnos tic artists who were the actual author s of the Egypt o - Christian iconogr aphy, not the “few poor fishermen.” The Rom an Chur ch will yet find that she is at root Egypt ian, and will then seek to slough off the s pur ious history which by that time will be looke d upon as solely incremental. The Egypt ians were the greatest realists that ever lived. For thous ands and thous ands of years it was their obvi ous ende avour at full stretch to reach the ultimate reality of et ernal truth. Their interroga tion of nature was like the que stioni ng of children, very much in earnest: “But is it really true?” The real was the que st of their unc easing inqui ry. To be real was the end and aim; that was living in truth. The onl y one god wa s the real god . Horus in spirit was the real Horus. Reality was roya lty. In the time of the fifth dyna sty a certain Tep - en - ankh claims to be “the real judge and scribe,” the “real nearest friend of the king.” For them eternal life was the ultimate reality. The Egypt ian was pre - eminently a manly religion, and therefore calculated to develop manhood. In the hall of the last judgm ent the deceased expe cts justice and equi ty. His god is a just and right eous judge . He doe s not pray for mercy or writhe in the dus t to seek a sentimental forgiveness for sins, or sue for clemency. His was not a creed of that nature. He know s it is the life, the character, the conduc t that will coun t in the scales of Maati for the life hereafter. The hum an Horus put in no plea for sinn ers on account of his sufferings . Divine Horus throw s no make - weight into the scale. The deceased is judge d by what he has done and by what he has not done in the life on earth. He must be sound at heart. He"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"must have spoke n and acted the truth. The word o f god must have been made truth by him to be of any avail at the bar of judgm ent. That was the obj ect of all the teaching in all the mysteries and writings which were held to be divine. The standa rd of law without and within was set up unde r the name of Ma ati or Maat, a name denot ing the fixed, unde viating law and eternal rule of right . Hence the same word signi fies law, truth, justice, right fulness, and the later right eous ness. The foremost and the final article of the Egypt ian creed was to fulfil Maati. T his is the beginni ng, the middl e, and the end of the moral law. The deity enthrone d by them for worship was the god of Maati, the name, which has the four fold meaning of law, justice, truth, and right , which are one as well as synonym ous . Judgm ent with jus tice was their aim, their alpha and 242 om ega, in adm inistering the law which their religious sense had divinized for hum an use; and its supr eme type , erected at the pol e, in the equinox, or the Hall of Judgm ent, was the pair of scales at perfect equi poi se, for with them the equi librium of the uni verse was depende nt on eternal equi ty. It may look like taking a flying leap in the dark to pass from the Egypt ian Book of the Dead to Bunya n’s Pilgrim’s Progr ess, but whencesoever Bunya n derived the tradition, the Pilgrim’s Progr ess cont ains an out line of the matter in the Egypt ian Ritual. Christian persona tes the Manes on his jour ney through the nether earth, with the roll in his hand cont aining the word of life. The escape from the City of Destruction may be s een in the escape of the deceased from the destruction threatened in Amenta, when he exclaims, “I com e from the lake of flame, from the lake of fire and from the field of flame” (ch. 98) . The wicket - gate corresponds to the secret door way of the mysteries; the “Slough of Despond” to the marshes in the mythos ; the “Hill of Difficulty” to the Mount of Ascent up which the Osiris climbs with “his staff in his hand. ” The Manes forgets his name; Christian forgets his roll, the roll that was his gui de book for the jour ney and his passpor t to the celestial city. The prototypa l valley of the shadow of death is the Aar - en - tet in Amenta. This is the valley of darkne ss and death (Rit., ch. 19; 130 , 6). The Ritual says, “Let not the Osiris adva nce into the valley of darkn ess” where the twice - dead were bur ied for ever by the great anni hilator Seb. The mons ter Apap is the original Apol lyon . The equi pm ent of Christian in his armour for his conf lict with Apol lyon in the Valley of Hum iliation is one with the equi pm ent of the Os iris, who enters the valley “glorious and well equi ppe d” for the battle with his adve rsary the dragon. The fight of Christian and Apol lyon is identical with the cont est between Ra and Apap. All the time of his struggl e Apol lyon fought with yells and hideou s roarings ; Apap with “the voi ce of strong bellow ings ” (Rit., ch. 39). Christian passes by the mout h of hell; the Osiris passes by the ten hells, with all of them, as it were, making mout hs at him for their prey. There are two lions at the gate of the Pala ce Beautiful, and in the Ritual the two lions crouc h at the beautiful gate of exit from Amenta (vig. to ch. 18) . The waters of the river of life, the green meadow s, the delectable mount ains, the land of Beulah, the paradise of peace, the celestial city on the sum mit, all belong to the mythology of Hetep or the Mount of Glory — a bare out line, the mere skeleton of which has been clothed at different times in various forms, includi ng this of the Pilgrim’s Progress. Possibly Bunya n the tinke r"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"derived the traditi on from thos e travelling tinke rs the gipsies. How ever this may be, the Egypt ian Ritual is the verifiable sour ce of Bunya n’s Pilgrim’s Progr ess. Many illustrations might also be given to show that the mysteries of Amenta, which were finally sum med up as “O sirian,” have been carried to the other side of the world. In the mythol ogy of the 243 abor igines of New Holland, “Grogo ragally, the divine son, is the active agent of his father, who immovabl y presides ove r all nature (like Osiris, the mummy god of the motionl ess heart). The son watches the actions of men, and qui ckens the dead immediately upon their earthly interment. He acts as mediator for the soul s to the great god, to whom the good and bad actions of all are know n. His office is chiefly to bring at the close of every day the spirits of the dead from all parts of the world to the judgm ent - seat of his father, where alone there is eternal light . There he acts as intercessor for thos e who have onl y spent som e por tion of their lives in wickedne ss. Baym a, listening to the mediation of his son, allow s Grogo ragally to adm it som e such into Ballima,” or heaven (Manni ng, Notes on the Abor igines of New Holland, Sydne y, 1883 , copy from the author ). Grogor agally is one with the hawk - headed Horus, the paraclete or a dvoc ate who pleads for the Manes before the judgm ent - seat of his father. Again, the abor igines of the McDonne ll Range s have a tradition that the sky was at one time inha bited by three persons . One of these was a wom an, one was a child who always remained a child and never develope d beyond childhood; the third was a man of gigantic stature called Ulthaana — that is a spirit. He had an enor mous foot shaped like that of an emu. When a native dies he is said to ascend to the hom e of Ulthaana the spirit (Gillen, N otes, Horn Expedition, vol. IV, p. 183) . This is a far - off folk tale that may be traced back hom e to the Egypt ian myth. In this Child - Horus never develope d beyond childhood, and so remained the eternal child. This was Horus of the incarnation who made his transformation into the Horus that rose again as the adul t, the great man, Horus in spirit, the prototype of “Ulthaana.” The bird type is repeated. Horus has the head of the hawk, as a figur e of the man in spirit; Ulthaana, as a spirit, has the foot of an enor mous emu. The Arunt a also have a kind of Amenta or world of spirits unde r ground . About four teen miles to the sout h of Alice Springs there is a cave in a range of hills which rises to the north. This cave, like all others in the range , is suppos ed to be occupi ed by the Irunt arinia or spirit indi vidua ls, each one of whom is in reality the doubl e of one of the ancestors of the tribe who lived in the Alcheringa. The indi vidua l spirits are suppos ed to live within the cave in perpetual suns hine and among st reams of runni ng water, as in the Egypt ian meadow s of Aarru. Here, as in Amenta, the recons titution of the deceased takes place. Within the cave the Iruntarinia remove all the internal organs, and provi de the man with a com pletely new set, after which oper ation has been successfully performed he presently com es to life again, but in a condi tion of insanity. This, how ever, is of shor t dur ation, and the com ing round is equi valent to the recove ry of memory by the Manes in the Ritual, when he remembers his name and who he is in the great hous e of the other world (Spencer and Gillen, p. 525) . There are bird - soul s also in this nether earth, which are favour ed with unl imited suppl ies of dow n or unda ttha, with which they are fond of decorating their bodi es as spirit s. The mysteries of Amenta are more or less"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"extant in the totemic ceremoni es of the Central Australians at a more rudi mentary stage of developm ent, which means, according to the present reading 244 of the data, that the same primitive wisdom was carried out from the same central birthpl ace in Africa to the islands of the Sout hern Sea, and there fossilized dur ing long ages of isolation, which had been carried dow n the Nile to take living root and grow and flour ish as the mythology and eschatology of ancien t Egypt . In the mysteries of Amenta the deceased is recons tructed from seven cons tituent parts or soul s in seven stages of developm ent. Correspondi ng to these in the Arunt a mysteries, seven “status - terms are appl ied to the initiate.” (1) He is called Amba que rka up to the time of his being tossed in the air. (2) He is Ulpm erka unt il taken to the circum cision ground. (3) He is the Wurtja during the time betwixt being painted for it and the actual performance of the ceremony. (4) He is Arakur ta betwixt the op erations of circum cision and sub - incision. (5) He is Ertwa - kur ka after circum cision unt il he passes through the ordeal by fire. (6) Follow ing this he is called Illpongw ura, and (7) after passing through the engw ura he is designa ted Urliara. (Spencer and Gi llen, N.T., p. 638 .) In the mysteries of Amenta the mout h of the resuscitated spirit is ope ned and the silence of death is broke n when the lips are touc hed by the sacred implement in the hands of Ptah. It is said in the “ceremony of ope ning the mouth,” “Le t my mout h be ope ned by Ptah with the instrum ent of ba - metal with which he ope neth the mout hs of the gods ” (ch. 23) . The Arunta also perform the ceremony of ope ning the mout h by touc hing it with a sacred obj ect when the initiates are released from the ban of silence (Spencer and Gillen, pp. 382 , 385) . A mystery of the resurrection is acted by the Arunt a in the quabar ra ingw urninga inkinja, or corrobo rree of the arisen bone s, which bone s imaged the dead body, whilst the performers represented the Ulthaana or spirits of the dead (p. 473 ). The bone s were sacredly preserved by thos e who were as yet una ble to make the mum my as a type of permanence. Messrs. Spencer and Gillen tell us that every Australian native has to pass through certain ceremonies before he is adm itted to the secrets of the tribe. The first takes place at about the age of ten or twelve years, whilst the final and most impressive one is not passed through unt il proba bly the nat ive has reached the age of at least twenty - five, or it may be thirty years” ( N.T., pp. 212 , 213 ). These two initiations correspond to thos e in the mysteries of the doubl e Horus. At twelve years of age the Child - Horus makes his transformation into the adul t in his baptism or other kindr ed mysteries. Horus as the man of thirt y years is initiated in the final mystery of the resurrection. So was it with the gnos tic Jesus. The long lock of Horus, the sign of childhood, was worn by him unt il he attained the age of twelve years, when he was change d into a man. With the sout hern Aru nta tribe the hair of the body is for the first time tied up at the com mencement of the ope ning ceremony of the series by which he is made a man. His long hair is the equi valent of the Horus lock. The first act of initiation in the Arunt a mysteries is that of throw ing the boy up into the air — a ceremony that still survives with us in the tossing of the new - com er in a blanke t! This was a primitive mode of dedication to the ancestral spirit of the totem or the tribe, whos e voi ce is heard in the sound of the ch uringa or bul l - roarer whirling round. It is"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":" 245 said by the natives that the voi ce of the great spirit was heard when the resoundi ng bul l - roarer spoke . The great spirit was suppos ed to descend and enter the body of the boy and to make him a man, just as in the mystery of Tattu the soul of Horus the adul t descends upon and uni tes with the soul of Horus the child, or the soul of Ra the hol y spirit descends upon Osiris to qui cken and transform and re - erect the mum my. Where risen Horus becom es bird - headed as the adul t in spirit the Arunt a yout h is given the appe arance of flight to signi fy the change resulting from the descent of the spirit as the cause of transformation. When one becom es a soul in the mysteries of the Ritual by assum ing the form or image of Ra , the initiate exclaims “Let me wheel round in whirls, let me revolve like the turning one ” (ch. 83) . The “turning one ” is the sun god Chepera (Kheper), whos e name is identical with that of an Australian tribe. Kheper is the soul of “self - originating force ” that was imaged unde r one type by the bennu, a bird that ascends the air and flies to a great height whilst circling round and round in spiral wheels (Rit., ch. 85). Whether this be the chur inga , the bribbun , turndun, or whirler in a glorified form or no t, the doc trine of soul - making at pube rty is the same in the Australian as in the Egypt ian mysteries. In the Egypt ian mythol ogy Horus is the blind man, or rather he is the child bor n blind, called Horus in the dark. He is also described as the blind Horus in the city of the blind. In his blindne ss he is typi cal of the emasculated sun in winter and of the hum an soul in death. At the place of his resurrection or rebirth there stands a tree up which he climbs to enter spirit life. And we are told that “near t o Charlotte Waters is the tree that rose to mark the spot where a blind man died.” This tree is called the ape ra okilchya — that is, the blind man’s tree, and the place where it stands was the camp of the blind, the city of the blind, the world of the dead, in which the tree of life or dawn was root ed ( N.T., p. 552) . Shoul d the tree be cut dow n the men where it grow s will becom e blind. They woul d be like Horus in the dark, this being the tree of light or the dawn of eternal day. In one of their ceremoni es the Arunt a perform the mystery of the orunc ha which existed in the Alcheringa . These were evil spirits or “devil - devil men,” malevol ent and murderous to hum an beings , especially to the wom en after dark ( N.T., p. 329, 331, 390 - 1). In this performance they are por trayed as prow ling round, crawling, peering about , and seeking whom they may devou r. They run backw ards and forwards on all four s as beasts of prey, grow ling and pretendi ng to frighten each other. The orunc ha are the creatures of the dark, with hor ns li ke the mediæval devil, and they correspond to the Sebau fiends or evil spirits of the Egypt ian mythos who are the enemies of the good Osiris in Amenta. These devil - devil men made war upon the lizard men, the men of the lizard totem, but there were two brot hers who rushed upon them as avenge rs, and slew the whol e of the orunc ha. The evil pow ers were the creatures of chaos, the spawn of darkne ss, the devils of drought , with whom there was no law or order. The two brothers=brotherhoods belonge d to the lizard t otem, toge ther with their wives. This was the earliest totem of the Arunt a. In the last of the initiation ceremoni es the Arunt a raise a special 246 "},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"mound, called the parra, on the engw ura ground, where the final rites are performed and full initiation i s attained. Here the nur tunga was raised, and the parra mound was, so to say, erected at the pole. Messrs. Spencer and Gillen tell us they were una ble to learn the meaning of the word parra. But, as the com parison is not simply verbal, we not e that para is an ancient Egypt ian name for Annu, the place of the colum n, the mount of the pole, and of the balance in the Maat. The Chepara tribe of Sout hern Queensland also throw up the circular mound for their greater mystery of the kur inga l, in which may be identif ied the baptism and rebirth by fire (How itt, Australian Ceremoni es of the Initiation ). Amongs t the initiatory rites of the Arunt a mysteries is the pur ification by fire. When the initiate has passed through this trial he becom es a perfectly develope d member of the tribe, and is called an urliara, or one who has been prove d by fire ( N.T., p. 271) . The natives say that the ceremony has the effect of strengt hening the character of all who pass through it. This is one of the most obvi ous survivals. A fire ceremo ny is described in the Ritual as an exceeding great mystery and a type of the hidde n things in the unde r world. It is an appl ication of the fires by means of which pow er and might are conf erred upon the spirits (khu) among the stars which never set. These fires, it is said in the rubr ic (ch. 137, A ), shall make the spirit as vigor ous as divine Osiris. It is a great ordeal, and so secret is the mystery that it is only to be seen by the males. “Thou shalt not perform this ceremony before any hum an being, exce pt thine own self or thy father or thy son. ” Amongs t other things , the fire is good for destroyi ng evil influences and for giving pow er to Horus in his war with darkne ss. It is of interest to not e the part played by the females in the ordeals by fire. In o ne of these the fire is prepared by the wom en, and when the yout h squa ts upon the fire they place their hands upon his shoul der and gently press him dow n upon the smoki ng fuel ( N.T., p. 259) . Now in the Egyp tian mysteries of Amenta the puni shers or pur ifie rs in the hells or furnaces are wom en or godde sses, and it looks as if this character had survived in the mysteries of the Arunt a. When the elders shout through the darkne ss to the wom en across the river, “What are you doi ng? ” the reply is, “We are making a fire.” “What are you goi ng to do with the fire?” is asked, and the wom en shout , “We are goi ng to bur n the men.” This occurs during a pause by night in the ceremoni es of initiation, which terminate with the ordeal by fire. (Spencer and Gillen.) The conc lu ding ordeals by fire and the “final washing” in the Australian ceremoni es can be paralleled in the Ritual. “Lo, I com e,” says the speaker, “that I may pur ify this soul of mine in the most high degree” (ch. 97) ; and again, “I com e from the lake of flame, fr om the lake of fire and from the field of flame, and I live.” He is now a spirit sufficiently adva nced to join the ancient never - setting one s and becom e a fellow - citizen with them in the eternal city (ch. 98). The initiate in the Australian mysteries havin g passed through the initiatory ceremoni es, joins the elders as a fully - develope d member of his tribe. The most sacred ceremoni al obj ect of the Arunt a is called the kauaua. This is erected at the close of the engw ura mysteries. A young gum - tree, 20 feet i n height , is cut dow n, strippe d of its branches 247 and its bark, to be erected in the middl e of the sacred ground. The decoration at the top was “just that of a human head.” It was cove red all ove r with hum an blood , unl ess red ochre had been subs tituted . The exact signi ficance of the kauaua is not know n to the"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"natives, but , as the writers affirm, it has som e relation to a hum an being, and is regarded as com mon to the members of all the totems (p. 630). Its mystery is made know n at the conc lusion of the e ngw ura, a series of ceremoni es, the last of the initiatory rites through which the native must pass to becom e a fully - develope d member who is adm itted to all the secrets of the tribe, of which this is appa rently final and supr eme. All things cons idered, we think the sacred kauaua is a form of the Egypt ian ka - statue, which is a type of eternal dur ation as an image of the highe st soul . To make the kauaua, so to say, the pol e is hum anized. It is painted with hum an blood, and ornamented like the hum an head. It has but one form, and is com mon to all the totems. So is it with the Egypt ian ka, the eid ō l on of the endur ing soul . The name of the kauaua answers to a long - drawn - out form of the word “k ā ,” as k ā - ā - ā . The mysteries of the Arunt a, which som etimes take four mont hs toge ther for a com plete performance, cons titute their religious ceremoni es, their means of instruction, their books , their arts of statuary, painting, and Sign - langua ge, their mode s of preserving the past, whether lived on earth, or, as they have it , in the Alcheringa , dur ing the times of the mythical ancestors beyond which tradition doe s not penetrate. The main difference betwixt the Australian and the Egypt ian mysteries is that the one are performed on this earth in the totemic stage of sociology, the other in the earth of Amenta in the pha se of eschatology. Also the Egypt ians cont inue d grow ing all the time that the Australians were standi ng still or retrogr ading. Lastly, we may be sure that such mysteries as these did not spring from a hundr ed diff erent origins and com e toge ther by fortuitous conc our se from the ends of the earth, to be finally formulated as the Egypt ian mysteries of Amenta.  248 THE SIGN - LANGUAGE OF ASTRONOMICAL MYTHOLOGY B OOK V.

They have no totems, no signs of tattu scored upon their bodi es, no rites of pube rty, no eating of the parent in honour for the primitive sacrament. Judgi ng from specimens of the Pygm ies that have been brou ght to Engl and from the Ituri Forest, the founda tion of the Negroid features, the thick lips and large, spreading nos trils, was laid in the Pygm ean pha se of developm ent, but up to the present time the Pygm y has onl y reached the “peppe rcorn” stage of hair, and has not yet attained the “kinky” locks of the full - bloode d Negro. A German traveller lately claimed to have discove red a peopl e in the forests of Borneo who show som e vestige of the ancestral tail. He saw the tail on a child about six years old belong ing to the Pœnan tribe. There was the appe nda ge, sure enough — not very long , but plainly visible, hairless, and about the thickne ss of a man’s little finge r ( Daily Chroni cle, Augus t 10t h, 1904) . Also the persistent 249 rum our that som e remains of a semi - s imian race are yet extant among the hidde n secrets of the old dark land is not incredible to the evol utioni st. According to Lady Luga rd, there is a tribe in Nigeria who are reput ed not to have lost their tails ( Daily Mail, March 2nd, 1904) . The African Pyg mies, how ever, have not publ icly proclaimed the tail. The one sole race that can be traced among the abor igines all ove r the earth, above ground or below , is the dark race of a dw arf Negrito type , and the onl y one pos sible motherland on earth for these pr eliminary peopl e is Africa. No other count ry pos sesses the necessary backgr ound as a basis for the hum an beginni ngs . And so closely were the facts of nature obs erved and registered by the Egyp tians that the earliest divine men in their mythol ogy are portra yed as Pygm ies. Follow ing the zoot ype s, the primitive hum an form of Elder Horus was that of Bes, the dancing dw arf. Bes is a figure of Child - Horus in the likeness of a Negroid Pygm y. He com es capering into Egyp t along with the Great Mother, Apt, from Puant a in the far - off sout h. In reality, Bes - Horus is the earliest form of the Pygm y Ptah. In bot h the dw arf is the type of man in his most primitive shape. The seven pow ers that co - ope rate with Ptah are also represented as seven Pygm ies. Thus the anthropom orph ic type com es into view as a Pygm y! Moreove r, Ptah, the divine"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"dw arf, is the imperfect proge nitor of the perfect man in his son Atum . In this way the Egypt ian wisdom registers the fact that the Pygmy was the earliest hum an figure know n, and that this was b rought into Egypt from the forests of Inne r Africa and the record made in the mythol ogy . In this mode of registering the natural fact the Egypt ians trace their descent from the folk who were the first in hum an form — that is, from the Pygm ies. We have now t o sum marize a few of the pre - Egypt ian evidences for the Inne r African beginni ngs . In one of the later chapters of the Book of the Dead (no. 164) – later, that is, in pos ition – there are som e ancient mystical names which are said to have been uttered in the l angua ge of the Nahsi (the Negroes), the Anti, and the peopl e of Ta - Kenset, or Nubia. Dr. Birch thought this and other chapters were modern because of the presence of Amen - Ra. But the later insertion of a divine name or title doe s not prove the funda mental matter of the chapter to be late. In this the Great Mother is saluted as the Supr eme Being, “the Only One,” by the name of Sekhe t - Bast, the godde ss of sexua l passion and strong drink, who is the mistress of the gods , not as wife, but as the prom iscuous con cubi ne — she who was “unc reated by the gods ,” and who is “might ier than the gods .” To her the eight gods offer words of adoration. Therefore they were not then merged in the Put - circle of the nine. It is not iceable too that Sekhe t is not saluted as the cons o rt of Ptah. Sekhe t was undoubt edly far more ancient than Ptah. But the point is that the out landi sh names appl ied to her in this chapter are quo ted from the langua ge of the Negroes, therefore parts of the Ritual had been com pos ed in thos e langua ges; and if in the langua ges, then in the lands where these langua ges were spoke n, includi ng the count ry of the Nahsi, who were so despised by the dyna stic Egypt ians. This we claim as a partial recogni tion of the 250 sout hern origin of the Egypt ian mythol ogy . In ag reement with this, the Great Mother may be identified in chapter 143 as Apt of Nubi a, who had a shrine at Nepata on her way to Egypt , Khept, or Khebt. In a text upon a stele among the Egyp tian monum ents at Dorpat it is said to the worshippe r, “Make ador ati on to Apt of the dum - palms, to the lady of the two lands ” ( Proc. Soc . Bib. Arch., March 6th, 189 4, p. 152) . In this text the old first mother Apt appe ars as godde ss of the mama - tree, that is the dum - palm, which in Egypt is a native of the sout h. This poi nt s to the farther sout h as the primeval hom e and habitat of the most ancient hippopot amus godde ss, she who thus preceded Hathor in the sout hern sycamore as Mother - earth or Lady of the Tree, and who in the dum - palm was the “mama” or mother of the Inne r Afric ans. The King of Egypt as the Suten dates from Sut. The digni ty is so ancient that the insigni a of the Pharaohs evidently belong to a time when the Egypt ians wore not hing but the girdle of the Negro, and when it was cons idered a special distinction that t he King shoul d com plete this girdle with a piece of skin in front and ador n it with the tail of a lione ss behind. The oldest and most primitive form of the sacred hous e in Egypt know n from inscriptions of the ancient empire is a hove l dedicated to Sut for a temple. It looks like a hut of wattle - work without dab, and is a prehistoric type of bui lding in the Nile valley, belongi ng to a civilization immeasurably low er than that of Egypt . (Erman, p. 280 .) Sut the son of Apt was the deity of the second nom e.

The serpents of equa torial Africa have their likeness in the huge reptiles por trayed in pictures of the Egypt ian unde r - world. The sy camore fig of Hathor and the palm tree of Taht were imported into Egyp t from Central Africa. The burying - places of Abydos , especially the most ancient, have furnished millions of shells, pierced and threaded as in Africa at the present day (Maspero, Daw n o f Civilization, Eng. trans., p. 57) . The hoe s and woode n stands for head - rests used by the Egypt ians have their prototype s among the East Central African tribes (Duff Macdona ld). Dr. Peters found various custom s among the Wakintu in Uganda which made him t hink the peopl e were conne cted with the ancient Egypt ians. One of these was the practice of embalming the dead and of excavating the rocks. Also their burial mounds are coni cal, he says, and look like pyr amids. One might fill a vol um e with figures from In ner Africa that were develope d and made permanent in the sym bol ism of Egypt . “My lord the lion” is an African expr ession used by the Kaffirs and others in speaking of the lordly animal, also of the chief as lion - lord. So likewise in Egypt Osiris as king o f the gods was “my lord the crocodi le,” and King Assa is also called “my lord the king, ” as a crocodi le. (Rit., ch., 142, line 17, Prisse. Pap. 41.) Again, the lion of Motoko is a totem with the Kaffirs in the neighbou rhood of Fort Salisbur y, Mashona land. They have a priest of the lion - god called the Mondor o, who is venerated as a sort of spirit in lion shape. 251 Sacrifices are offered annua lly to the lion - god at the Zimbabw e of Mashona land; and it is held by the natives that all true men pass into the l ion form at death, precisely the same as it is with the Manes in the Egypt ian Ritual, who exclaims, on living a second time, “I am the lord in lion form” (ch. 4), and who rises again when divinized in that image of supe rhum an pow er. Such type s were Inne r A frican when totemic, and, as the lion of Motoko show s, they were also venerated as representatives of spiritual or supe rhum an pow ers which were deified in Egypt as the crocodi le divinities Apt, Neith, and Sebek, and the lion - gods Shu, Tefnut , Sekhe t, Horus , and Atum - Ra. In the Egypt ian judg ment scenes the baboon or Cynoc epha lus sits upon the scales as the tongue of the balance and a primitive determinative of even - hande d justice. This was an Inne r African type , now cont inue d in Egyp t as an image of the jud ge. In a Namaqua land fable the baboon sits in judgm ent on the other animals. The mous e had torn the tailor’s clothes and laid it to the cat, the cat lays it to the dog , the dog to the wood, the wood to the fire, the fire to the water, the water to the elep hant, and the elepha nt to the ant; whereupon the wise judge orders the ant to bite the elepha nt, the elepha nt to drink the water, the water to que nch the fire, the fire to bur n the wood , the wood to beat the dog, the dog to bite the cat, and the cat to bit e the mous e; and thus the tailor gets satisfaction from the judgm ent of the wise baboon, whos e name is Yan in Namaqua , whilst that of the Cynoc epha lus is Aan in Egypt ian. This in the Europe an folk - tales is the well - know n nursery legend of “the pig that wou ldn’ t go.” How then did this Bushm an or Hottentot fable get into the low ermost stratum of the folk - tales in Engl and? We answer, the same way that “Tom Thum b” did, and “Jack the Giant - killer,” the “Hous e that Jack Built,” and many more which are the poor re lations reduc ed from the"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"mythol ogy of Egypt to becom e the märchen of the world. Again, the yout hful hero who is Horus in Egyp t, Heitsi Eibib among the Hottentots, and the redoubt able little Jack in Britain, is also an Inne r African figur e unde r the name of Kalikalange . The missiona ry Macdona ld says, “We know a boy who assum ed, much at his ow n instance, the name of Kalikalange , the hero about whom there are so many native tales, remindi ng one of the class of tales to which Jack the Giant - killer belong s” ( Afr icana, vol . I, p. 115) . This is the hero who slays the giant or dragon of drought and darkne ss, or cuts ope n the mons ter that swallow ed him; who rescues the luna r lady from her imprisonm ent, and who makes the ascent to heaven by means of a tree, a stalk, o r, as in the case of Child - Horus, a papy rus reed. In his Uganda Protectorate (vol . II, p. 700) Sir H. Johns ton has reproduc ed a local legend of creation derived from the natives, which cont ains certain cons tituent elements of the nursery tale of Jack the G iant - killer. “Kintu was the first man. When he came from the unknow n he found not hing in Uganda — no food, no water, no animals, not hing but a blank. He had a cow with him, and on this he lived. The cow represented the earth as giver of food. Kintu is a form of the uni versal hero, the hero to whom the tests are appl ied for discove ring whether or no he is the real heir. Kintu eats or 252 dispos es of 10, 000 carcasses of roasted cow s, and thus prove s himself to be the man inde ed, as doe s Jack who out wits the g iant in a similar manne r. The story include s the beanstalk (or the bean), with other fragm ents foun d in the Europe an märchen, includi ng the bringi ng of death into the world through the disobe dience of Kintu, the first man, or by his violating the law of ta bu. The Wakintu of Uganda or Rhode sia derive their name from Kintu, the first man of the Central African legends . In a Zulu legend the unde r - world is the land of cannibals. Here dw ells the devour er from whom the yout hful hero makes his escape, toge ther wi th his sister, by climbing up a tree into the sky count ry, just as Horus climbs the tree of dawn in com ing forth from the unde rworld. We read in the Ritual of a gol den god - headed ape which is “three palms in height , without legs or arms.” The speaker in th is character says, “My cour se is the cour se of the gol den Cynoc epha lus, three palms in height , without legs or arms, in the temple of Ptah” (Rit. ch. 42, Renouf ). What this means no mortal know s. It is know n, how ever, that the dog - headed ape as Ani the sal uter was emblematic of the moon . Now , in the Kaffir story of Simbukum bukw ana there is a child bor n without legs or arms, who obvi ous ly represents the moon in its change s. He began to speak on the day of his birth. “The girl that was first born, who grew up in the valley and lived in the hol e of an ant - heap,” is called his sister. She has the pow er to give him legs and arms by repeating his name and saying, “Have legs and arms!” and to deprive him of them by saying “Shrink, legs and arms!” This, as a figur e of waning and waxing, helps us to unde rstand the dog - headed ape of gol d as an image of the moon in the waxing and waning halves of the luna tion. In “the story of the glutton” the conque rors of the swallow er are the mother and her twins. These, in an Egypt i an form of the mythos , are Sut and Horus, the twin brethren, who war against the mons ter of light in the moon (Rit., ch. 80) . In this way we can trace som e of the oldest of the folk - tales conc erning the deluge and the lost paradise, the hero as the wonde r - working child who climbs a tree or stalk and slays the mons ter of"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"the dark, to Inne r Africa, and follow these and others in the mythol ogy of the Egypt ians on their way to becom ing the uni versal legends of the hum an race. The mythol ogy , religious rites, to temic custom s, and primitive sym bol ism of Egypt are crow ded with survivals from identifiable Inne r African origins. The Egypt ian ka or image of a spiritual self was preceded by various rude but representative images of the dead. Livings tone tells us that t he natives about Lake Moere make little idol s of a deceased father or mother. To these they present beer, flour , and bha ng; they light a fire for the spirits to sit round and smoke in conc ert with their living relatives. The Ewe - speaking natives of the Gol d C oast also have their kra or eid ō l on, which existed from before the birth of a child and is exactly identical with the Egypt ian kra (Ellis, A. B., Ewe - speaking Peopl es, p. 13) . It is a com mon practice with the Bantu tribes described by the author of The Uga nda Protectorate for the 253 relatives of deceased persons to carve crude little images as likenesses of the dead, and set them up for worship or propi tiation. Offerings are made to these in place of the later ka of the Egypt ians. The earlier type of the departed was a bodi ly portrait. Hence the mum my. The ka is a later spirit likeness. But bot h imply the same recogni tion of the ancestral spirits that live on after death. The spirit hut s provi ded for the honour ed dead in the dense forests of Central Afric a, as by the Wanya mwezi for their Musimo, by the Congo Pygm ies (Geal), and by the Nilotic Negroes, which the Portugue se called devil hous es, are prototype s of the ka - chambers in Egyp tian tom bs. Erecting a little hut for the spirits is a recogni zed mode of propi tiation. Lione l Décle, as we have seen, describes his Wanya mwezi as making little hut s of grass or of green boughs even when on the march, and offering them to the Musimo or spirits of their ancestors ( Three Years in Sav age Africa, pp. 343 - 6). One of the fune ral offerings found in Theban tom bs is a loaf of bread in the shape of a cone (our pastille), or a mode l in bur nt terra - cotta that images the loaf. Why the offering shoul d be coni cal is adm ittedly unknow n. This typi cal cone is Inne r African, and i n a most peculiar way. The Yao people have the custom of making an offering to the dead in a coni cal form. They do not know how to make bread, but their offering to the spirits cons ists of a little flour. This they let fall slow ly from the finge rs on the g round, so that it may form a pile in the shape of a suga r - loaf. If the cone shoul d shape perfectly it is an om en that the offering is acceptable to the spirits. It may be sugge sted in passing that the coni cal shape of the pile in flour and the fune rary loa f was derived from that of the grave - mound of earth or stone s droppe d ove r the bur ied corpse as the still earlier tribut e offered to the dead. British peasants give the name of “fairy loaves” to the fossil echini or sea - urchins found in Neolithic graves. O bvi ous ly these loaves were representative of fune rary food that was likewise offered to the dead. The skeleton of a young wom an clasping a child in her arms was discove red in a round barrow on Duns table Dow ns, the bur ial mound being edge d round with these fairy loaves. Again, in the mysteries of the Yao peopl e the youn g girls are initiated by a female who is called “the cook ,” “the cook of the mystery” (mtelesi wa unya go) . This is the instructress who makes the mystery or is the “cook” that prepares it, an d who is"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"mistress of the ceremony. She is the wise wom an who initiates the girls, and anoi nts their bodi es with an oil cont aining various magical ingr edients. She clothes them in their earliest garment, the primitive loin - cloth, that was first assum ed at p ube rty with proud pleasure, and afterwards looke d upon askance as the sign of civilized wom an’s shame. Now this primitive persona ge has been divinized as the Cook in the Kamite pantheon. In Egypt ian, tait signi fies to cook, and this is the name of a godde s s Tait who is the cook in paradise and the preparer of the deceased in the greater mysteries of the Ritual, where she is the cook of the mystery more obv ious ly than a cook as preparer of food. The deceased, in speaking of his inve stiture for the garden of Aarru, cries, “Let my vesture be girt on me by Tait!” 254 — that is, by the godde ss who is the divine cook by name, and who clothes the initiate in the garment or girdle that here takes the place of the loin - cloth in the more primitive mysteries of Inne r Africa (Duff Macdona ld, Africana, vol . I, pp. 123 - 126; Rit., ch. 82, Renouf ). The Egypt ian record when correctly read will tell us plainly that the hum an birthpl ace was a land of the papyr us reed, the crocodi le, and hippopot amus; a land of the great lakes in Karua, the Koloë of Ptolemy, or in Apta at the hor n poi nt of the earth — that is, in Equa toria, from whence the sacred river ran to brim the valley of the Nile with plenty. The track of civilization with cities springi ng in its foot prints is seaward from the sout h, not upw ard from Low er Egyp t, which was a swamp when Uppe r Egypt was already the African home of civilization. The Egypt ians always gave priority to the sout h ove r the delta in the nor th. Also the sout h was and is the natural habitat of the olde st fauna and most peculiar of the sacred zoot ypes. It is in vain we judge of the race by the figures and faces of the rulers por trayed in monum ental times. Primary data must be sought for amongs t the Fellaheen and corrobo rated by the skul ls. Captain Burton wrote to me in 1883 , saying, “You are qui te right about the African origin of the Egyptians , and I hav e sent hom e a hundr ed skulls to prove it.” (Does anyone know what became of these skul ls?) The African legends tell us that the Egypt ians, Zulus, and ot hers looke d backw ard to a land of the papyr us reed as the primeval count ry of the hum an race, and that on this, as we shall see, the Egypt ians founde d their circum pol ar paradise in the astronom ical mythol ogy. There is a widespread African tradition, especi ally preserved by the Kaffir tribes, that the primeval birthpl ace was a land of reeds. The Zulus told the missiona ry Callaway that men originally “came out of a bed of reeds.” This birthplace in the reeds was called “Uthlanga ,” named from the reed. No one kne w where it was, but all insisted that the natal reed - bed of the race was still extant. It was a sign of lofty lineage for the native aristocracy to claim descent from ancient Uthlanga , the primeval land of birth. The Basutos identify Uthlanga the hum an birthpl ace with a cavern in the earth that was surrounde d by a morass of reeds. They also cling so affectiona tely to the typical reed that when a child is bor n they suspend a reed abov e the hut to announc e the birth of the babe, thus show ing in the langua g e of signs that the papyr us reed is still a type of the primitive birthpl ace in which Child - Horus was cradled on the flow er of the papyr us plant or reed. The Zulu birthpl ace in the bed of reeds was repeated and cont inue d in the nest of"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"reeds and the morass that were mythically represented as the birthpl ace of the child, which was cons tellated as the uranogr aph of Horus springi ng from the reed. What inde ed is the typi cal reed of Egypt , first in the uppe r, next in the low er land, but a sym bol of the birthpl ac e in the African bed of reeds? Low er Egypt, called Uat in the hierogl yphi cs, has the same name as the papyr us reed. Also Uati is a title of the great mother Isis who brought forth Child - Horus on her lap of the papyr us flow er. Uat in Egypt ian is the name of Low er Egypt ; Uat is the oasis, Uat is the water, Uat is wet, fresh, evergreen. Uat is the reed of Egypt , the papyrus reed, and a name of the most ancient mother in the Kamite mythol ogy. 255 Seb, the father of food, is clothed with papyr us reeds. The Mo unt of Earth was imaged as a papyr us - plant in the water of space. Lastly, the Mount of Amenta in the Ritual rises from a bed of papyr us reeds. Hor - Apol lo says of the Egypt ians, “To denot e ancient descent they depict a roll of papyr us, and by this they sig nify primeval food” (B. I, 30) . This is the same as with the Zulus. The papyr us reed, Uat, was turned into a sym bol of most ancient descent precisely because it had been the primeval food of the most ancient peopl e, a totem of the most ancient mother of th e race when called Uati in Egypt , and a type of the African paradise. As the sym bol ism show s, peopl e were sometimes derived from and represented by the food on which they lived. Thus the papyr us reed that sym bol izes ancient food and long descent woul d be t he sign of the peopl e who onc e lived on or who ate the shoot s of the water plant. The Egypt ians cont inue d to be eaters of the lotus and papyr us shoot s. Theirs was the land of the reed, and they, like the Zulus or the Japanese or the Pueblos, were the reed peopl e in accordance with the primitive mode of heraldry, just as with the Arunt a tribes the witchetty - grub peopl e are thos e who live on the witchetty - grub as their special totemic food. In later times the papyr us plant was eaten by the Egypt ians as a deli cacy. Its shoot s were gathered for that purpos e annua lly. Bread made from the root s and the seed of the lotus was the gou rmand’ s delight. Lily loaves are mentione d in the Papyr us Anastasi. It is said in the Hym n to the Nile that when food is abunda nt the p oor man disdains to eat the lotus or papyrus plant, which show s that it had been his diet when other food was scarce. The lotus and the papyrus are the two water plants worn as a headdr ess by the two figures that represent the Nile sout h and nor th, and who are often seen bindi ng the flow ers to the Sam sym bol of Upper and Low er Egyp t, as if joining the two count ries toge ther as the one land of the reed. Uthlanga is not irrecove rable. We glean from other Zulu legends that this was the African birthpl ace in th e bed of reeds, where the two children, black and white, were born of dark and day, and where the race of the reed peopl e broke off in the beginni ng. This cradle of creation is repeated mythically with Child - Horus in his nest of reeds or bed of the papyr us plant, when the field of reeds was figur ed in the heavens as the primitive paradise of food and drink. In the so - called “cosmogony” of the Japanese it is set forth that the first thing in which life appe ared on earth at the beginni ng was the reed, and th e earliest land or “count ry - place stand” (Kuni toko tachi) was the land of the reed. Japan was named as the central land of the reed expa nse from the fields of reed, whether geogr aphi cal on the earth or astronom ical in the fields of heaven. The “great reed” of the Japanese mythos is"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"identical with the papyrus reed that represented the Mount of Earth in Egypt or the lotus of Meru in Indi a. Any count ry figur ed as being atop of the reed woul d be the midland of the world, as Japan is said to be, and the Kamite r eed will expl ain why the land of the Kami shoul d be called Ashi - hara, the plain of reeds, when the reed is identified with the papyr us plant. Ashi - har a no nak a tsu Kuni , “the Middl e Kingdom of the Reed Plain,” which 256 lies upon the sum mit of the globe , is an ancient name for Japan. This, if munda ne, corresponds to the land of the papyr us reed in equa torial Africa, the sum mit of our earth; or, if onl y mythical, i.e., astronom ical, to the reed field of the Aarru paradise upon the sum mit of the mount in he aven. Again, the great reed standi ng up out of the water is identical with the typi cal mount of earth in the Navajo mythol ogy. As the mount grew highe r, highe r grew the reed. At the time of the deluge all that lived took refuge there, and were rescued from the drow ning waters by the reed. This is the papyr us reed which cradled Horus amid the waters, like the infant Moses in the ark of bulrush, appl ied in a folk - tale on a larger scale (Matthews). It is now propos ed to seek for the birthpl ace of the beginni n gs in Central Africa, the land of the papyrus reed, around the equatorial lakes, by the aid of the Egypt ian astronom ical mythol ogy and the legenda ry lore. In the first place, the Kami of Egypt , like the Kami of Japan, identify themselves by name as the ree d - peopl e. And the godde ss Uati is the African great mother in the bed of reeds. For it was thence, in the region of the two lakes and in the land of the papyrus reed, that soul s in the germ first emanated as the soul of life from water. The Kaffir traditio n thus appe ars to preserve the natural fact which the Egyp tians rende red mythically by means of the reed plant as a sym bol of the primeval birthpl ace on earth with Horus issuing from the waters on the reed, which became the lap of life, the cradle and the ark of the eternal child, who is also called the shoot of the papyr us, the primitive Natzer. A spring of water welling from abys mal depths of earth, that furnished food in the papyr us reed and other edible plants, is the earliest form in which the sour ce of life was figur ed by the Kamite mystery teachers. This is recorded in the Ritual (ch. 172) . It was in the birthpl ace of the reeds and of the reed peopl e in the region of the reeds that light first broke out of darkne ss in the beginni ng in the dom ain of S ut, and where the twin children of darkne ss and of light were bor n. The Mother - earth as wom b of uni versal life was the produc er of food in various kinds , and the food was represented as her offspring. Horus on his papyr us imaged food in the water plant as well as in the later lentils, the branch of the tree, or in general vegetation. The stands of the offerings presented to the gods in the Ritual are com monl y crow ned with papyr us plants, which com memorate the food that was primeval. Thus the doc trine of lif e issuing in and from the papyr us reed was Egypt ian as well as Japanese. Naturally the earliest life thus emanating from the water was not hum an life, but this woul d be include d soone r or later in the mythical representation. Hence the legend of the first man, or person who issued from a reed in the water of the deluge . In this American Indi an version the reed is a figur e of the birthpl ace instead of the Zulu bed of reeds, or Uthlanga , the land of reeds, but the typi cal origin is the same; and as Egypt ian t he mythos is to be expl ained."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" The origin of a saviour in the guise of a little child is traceable to Child - Horus, who brought new life to Egypt every year as the Messu of the inunda tion. This was Horus in his pre - solar and pre - hum an characters of the fish , the shoot of the papyr us, or the branch of endl ess years. In a later stage the image of Horus on his papyr us 257 represented the young god as solar cause in creation. But in the primitive pha se it was a soul of life or of food ascendi ng from the water in vegetation, as he who climbs the stalk, rangi ng from Child - Horus to the Polyne sian hero, and to Jack ascendi ng heavenw ard by means of his bean - stalk. Now , of all the lands on earth there is no reed land to be com pared with the land of the reeds round th e equatorial lakes, where the papyr us grow s about the waters in jungl es and forests so dense that a charging herd of hippopot ami coul d hardly penetrate the bus h, which stands out of the water full fifteen feet in height (Johns ton, H. H.), and there if anyw here upon this earth Uthlanga , the original reed land or birth land in the reeds, will yet be found. That is the natural fact which unde rlies the mythical representation when the Egypt ians show us Horus “on his papyr us” rising from his natal bed of the pap yrus plant. Child - Horus on his papyr us is the reed - born in mythol ogy who reflects the natural fact of the hum an birthpl ace in the field, the bed, or nest of reeds on earth or in heaven — that is, the African oasis of the beginni ng, whether the offspring repr esents food or other elemental force. Now the Egypt ian Aarru or paradise, established by Ra, was “a field of reeds” in seven divisions , and these were papyr us reeds which sprang up from the marshes. Thus the Kamite paradise was a land of the papyr us plant repeated on the sum mit of the mount in heaven at the nor th celestial pol e (Naville, Destruction of Mank ind ). According to their way of registering a know ledge of the beginni ngs , the Egypt ians were well acqua inted with the equa torial regions , which they des igna ted “Apta,” the uppe rmost poi nt, the mount , or literally the “hor n - poi nt” of the earth. This was afterwards reproduc ed at the highe st poi nt above , when the primeval birth land was repeated as the land of rebirth for spirits in heaven. It has now to be show n that much of the sign - language of astronom y which still survives on the celestial globe is interpretable on the ground and for the reason that the funda mental data of the unde rlying mythos was Egypt ian, although the com mencement in Africa may have b een inde finitely earlier than the fulfillment in Egypt . From the beginni ng certain type s evol ved in the Egypt ian mythol ogy have been conf igur ated in the planisphe re, many of which remain extant on the celestial globe to - day. As a conc ept of primitive thoug ht life came into the world by water. Hence in the mysteries of Osiris water is the throne of the eternal. Earth itself was the produc er or the mother of the element, the wet - nur se in mythol ogy , and water was her child by whom an ever - renewing sour ce was i maged as a type in Child - Horus, the eternal child. Water, we shall see, was self - delineated as very heaven. Drought was self - delineated as a huge black reptile coiling round the mount of earth night after night and drinki ng up the water of light day after day. Darkne ss and light were self - delineated as two immense, wide - winge d birds, one black and one white, which ove rspread the earth. The great squa t - headed evil Apap in the Egypt ian drawings is probably a water reptile, and pos sibly represents the mysterio us mons ter of the lakes in the legends of Central Africa. But,"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"wheresoever its habitat in nature, it suppl ied one of the type s that were depicted in the astronom ical ceiling of Kam — the type s that have now to be follow ed 258 by means of the mythogr aphy in the Sign - langua ge of the starry sphe re, amongs t which Apap, the “hellish snake” of drought and dearth and darkne ss, still survives as our ow n cons tellation “Hydr a,” the enor mous reptile imaged in the celestial waters of the sout hern heaven. The hero of li ght that pierced the serpent of drought or the dragon of darkne ss was also represented as the gol den hawk (later eagle), and at Hermopol is the Egypt ians show ed the figur e of a hippopot amus upon which a hawk stood fight ing with a serpent (Plutarch, On I. an d O., p. 50). Now , as the hippop otamus was a zoot ype of the Mother - earth in the water of space, the hawk and serpent fight ing on her back por trayed the war of light and darkne ss which had been fought from the beginni ng, the war that was a primary subj ect f igur ed in the astronom ical mythol ogy. The hawk represented Horus, who was the bruiser of the serpent’s head. Thus the same conf lict that was portrayed at Hermopol is may be seen in the cons tellation of Serpentarius as a uranogr aph depicted in the planisphe r e. The Egypt ians called the equa tor Ap - ta, as the highest land or sum mit of the earth. This, the earthly Apta in the equa torial regions , was then rende red mythically as the Apta or highe st poi nt of the nor thern heavens in the astronom ical representation. And naturally the chief facts of the earthly paradise were repeated for a purpos e in the circum pol ar highl and. Hence the Aarru paradise, as a field of papy rus reeds ooz ing with the water of life that suppl ied the world, from the two great lakes into which the element divided at the head of the celestial river or the White Nile of the “Milky Way.” In com ing dow n the Nile from Karua, the lake count ry, the migrants had to pass through parching desert sands , which made the sout h a synonym for Sut, as it is in E gypt ian. Their future heaven was in the nor th, whence came the blessed breezes with the breath of healing from the very land of life. And all the time ahead of them was that fixed polar star in the nor th — fixed, that is, as a centre of rest and peace amidst the starry revol utions of the heavens. Emerging from Cool er breezes brought the breath of life to meet them on the way, and plenty of sweet, fresh water realized the heaven of the African. The Kami found their old lost paradise in “Uat,” the name signi fyi ng green, fresh, well - watered. Uat was literally the land of wet as water. Here then was heaven in the north, heaven as the nor th, heaven in the water and the breezes of the nor th. And on this they founde d a celestial garden or enclosure, which was conf igu rated by them in the northern heaven as the primitive paradise of edible plants and plenty of water. The river Nile was traced back by the Egypt ians to a doubl e sour ce. This in later times was localized at Elepha ntine, but not originally. The Nile was know n to issue from the two great lakes which were the sout hern sour ce of the river according to the Ritual. A tablet discove red at Gebel Silsileh refers to two of the ancient festivals of the Nile which had fallen into disuse in the time of Rameses II. In thi s it is said, “I know what is written in the book - store kept in the library, that whenever the Nile com eth forth from the two fount ains, the offerings of the gods are to be plenty” ( Records of the Past, vol . X, 41) . The river was timed 259"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" to com e forth from its doubl e welling - place on the 15t h of Epiphi , and the inunda tion to reach Gebel Silsileh, or Khennut , on the 15t h of Taht. The first of these dates corresponds to our May the 31s t; the second to Augus t the 4th. This allow s two mont hs and three days for the inunda tion to travel from its swollen and overflow ing doubl e - breasted sour ce, wheresoever that was localized, to Gebel Silsileh. The lengt h of the river from the Victoria Nyanza to the sea is now estimated at 3,370 miles. It is less than 3,000 to S ilsileh, and water flow ing at the rate of onl y two miles an hour woul d make 3,120 miles in sixty - five days. This seems to afford good evidence that the two fount ains were identified with the two lakes, and that the doubl e sour ce was afterwards repeated loc ally low er dow n at Elepha ntine. The Egypt ians had tracked the river to its sour ces “in the recesses,” called “the Tuat of the sout h,” and the inunda tion to the bur sting forth and ove rflow ing of the sout hern lakes at high flood (Hym n to the Nile; also Ritua l, ch. 149) . The mother of water in the nor thern heaven was imaged as the water - cow . Anot her type of the birthpl ace was the thigh or haunch of the cow , and one of the two lakes at the head of the Milky Way in the region of the nor thern pol e was called the “lake of the thigh.” The Osiris (ch. 149 ), on attaining the divine regions of water, air, and food , or, as we say, heaven, exul tingly exclaims, “I alight at ‘the thigh of the lake.’” This was the thigh of the cow that was cons tellated in heaven at least t wice ove r, as a sign of the birthpl ace, when the birth was water, or Horus, the child of the inunda tion. Now the name of Tanga nyi ka, from the African “tanga ” for “the thigh” and “nyi ka” for the water, signi fies the lake of the thigh or haunc h. But the thig h is onl y a sym bol which in Sign - langua ge denot es the birthpl ace that was imaged more com pletely by the Cow itself; the water - cow of Apt, in Apta, which represented earth as the great mother and giver of the water that, according to the legend, bur st forth from the abys s in the deluge of the inunda tion when the lake was formed at first. The lake of the thigh= Tanga nyi ka was cons tellated in the nor thern heaven by name as a uranogr aph, and this lake of the thigh or haunc h was the lake of the water - cow . Hence w e find the cow and the haunc h are blende d toge ther in one group of stars that is labelled the “Meskhe n,” as the wom b or birthpl ace at the sum mit of the pol e. (P. 289. ) And, although this lake in Africa is a little ove r the line to the sout h, it is near eno ugh to have been reckone d on it, and therefore to have been the earthly prototype of the great lake at the hor n - poi nt of the nor thern pol e which the Ritual denom inates the “lake of equi poi se” as well as the lake of the thigh. Amongs t the other signs that w ere conf igurated at the sum mit of the northern heaven as obj ect - pictures of the old primeval hom eland were the fields of the papyr us reed, the waters welling from unf athom able depths, the ancient mother as the water - cow of Apt, who was the living image of Apta as the birthpl ace in the reeds. Thus , with the aid of their uranogr aphs the Egypt ian mystery teachers show ed the birthpl ace in the fields of the papyr us plant; the reed bed in Uthlanga , where the black and white twins of darkne ss and day were bor n; th e birthpl ace of the water flow ing from its secret sour ce in the land of the two lakes called “the 260 lake of equi poi se” and “the lake of the thigh,” or Tanga , whence the name Tanga nyi ka. There was the water that for ever flow ed in fields for ever fresh and green, which figur ed"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"now the water of life that has no limit, and the food that is eternal in the Kamite eschatology. In the astronom y Apta was the mount of earth as a figur e of the equa tor, whereas the sum mit of the circum pol ar paradise was the mount of heaven as a figure of the pol e. In the final picture to the Ritual (ch. 186) the mount of Amenta stands in a morass of the papyr us reed. The cow that represented the great mother is portrayed in the two forms of Apt the water - cow and Hathor the milch - co w, as the typical mother amongs t the reeds in the place of birth on the earth and thence of rebirth in heaven. Thus , as we interpret it, the imagery of equa toria was commemorated in the uranogr aphi c representation or Sign - langua ge of the astronom ical mytho logy. Sir Harry Johns ton sees traces of the Egypt ian or Hamitic influence amongs t the more primitive dw arfs and Negroes of the equa torial regions , but this he speaks of as the result of a returning wave from the Nilotic races. Assuredly the Kamite race of migratory colonizers on the low er Nile did return in later times in search of the old hom e. Their voya ges by water and travels by land had becom e the subj ect of popul ar tales. But this was as travellers, adve nturers, naturalists, and miners who expl ored t heir hinterland, dug for metals or gems, impor ted strange animals, and transplanted precious trees to furnish incense for the godde sses and gods . It was not the grow n - up, civilized Ruti of Egypt , who called themselves “the men” par excellence, that went ba ck to beget the ape - like race of Negroid dw arfs in the central regions of Africa, or to peopl e the impenetrable forests with non - civilized, ignor ant, unde velope d manikins. That was not the rout e of evol ution. It is an ancient and world - travelling traditio n that heaven and earth were close toge ther in the beginni ng. Now the heaven signi fied in the oldest of all mythol ogi es, the Kamite, was the starry heaven of night upr aised by Shu as he stood upon the mount of earth. This was the heaven in which the stars of our two Bears revol ved about the pol e. The writer of the present work has seen in equa torial regions how the Sout hern Cross arises and the Bears go dow n for thos e who are goi ng sout h. The nor thern pol e - star dips and disappe ars, and with it sinks the pri mal paradise of mythol ogy in general that was conf igur ated in the stars about the pol e. On com ing nor th again, the old lost paradise arose onc e more as paradise regained. At a certain poi nt, in regions of no latitude , the pol e - star rests for ever on the ho rizon in the nor th, or, as the Egypt ians figur ed it, upon the mount of earth in Apta. The heaven of the ancient legends and of the equa torial astronom ers was close to the earth, because the pol e - star rested on the sum mit of the mount like Anup on his moun t ain. Such traditions were depos ited as the mythical mode of representing natural fact, how ever much the fact may be obs cured. Now , the ordinary heaven of night and day coul d not suppl y the natural fact. Heaven is no farther off from earth than ever. Yet th ere is a starting poi nt in the various mythol ogi es that is equi valent to this beginni ng, at which time heaven rested on the earth, and was afterwards separated from it by the mythical upl ifter of 261 the sky. The name of heaven denot es the up - heaven. Nut or Nu, the Egypt ian name for heaven, has the meaning and the sign of upl ifted. And there was but one starting poi nt at which the heaven coul d be said to rest upon the earth. This was in the regions of no latitude , where the pol e - stars were to be seen upon the two horizons . As the nom ads"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"travelled tow ards the north, this heaven of the pol e, which touc hed the earth in equa toria, naturally rose up from the moun t, or, as mythically rende red, it was raised by Shu, who stood upon the steps of Am - Khemen to reach the height , and pus h the two apart with his huge staff that was the giant’s figur e of the north celestial pol e. There were no solstices in Apta. Time, if any, was always equi noc tial there. And on this equa l measure of day and dark the first division of the circle, the sep or turn - round of the sphe re, was founde d. When Shu upr aised the sky it was equa lly divided between Sut and Horus, the portion of each being half of the water, half of the mount , or half of the twenty - four hour s. And this was the time made permanent in Amenta, where the later register for all such simple mysteries was kept. There are twelve hou rs light and twelve hour s dark in this nether - world, the same as in the equa torial regions . It is the equi noc tial time of Shu and Maati. The earth was not an upr ight pillar in Apta, with the starry sphe re revol ving round it on a hor izont al plane. The risings and settings of the stars were vertical, and the two fixed centres of the pol es were on the two hor izons , or, in accordance with the Egypt ian expr e ssion, on the nor thern and the sout hern sides of the mount of earth. The sky, as the celestial water, was also divided into two great lakes, one to the nor th and one to the sout h of the mount . These survive in the Ritual as the Lake of Kharu and the Lake o f Ru to the sout h and the nor th of the Bakhu hill “on which heaven resteth” (chs. 108 and 109) . The system of dividing the celestial water was appa rently founde d on the two great equa torial lakes at the head of the Nile, which were repeated in the two lake s of Amenta and in the other pictures of the doubl e sour ce of the great stream now figur ed in heaven at the head of the Milky Way as “the stream without end. ” The Egypt ians also preserved traditions of Ta - nut er, the hol y land that was know n by the name of Punt or Puanta. Maspero spells the name Puanit. The present writer has rende red it Puanta. One meaning of ant a, in Egypt ian, is yellow or gol den. Hence Puanta the gol den. The name is appl ied in the Ritual (ch. 15) to the land of dawn, or anta, as the gol d en= the land of gol d. This was the mythical or divine Anta in Amenta where the tree of gol den Hathor grew. In that case, Puanta or Punt is identical with the orient in the mythos . But the land of Puanta is also geogr aphi cal, and there was an Egypt ian tradit ion that this divine count ry coul d be reached by ascendi ng the river Nile (Maspero, Histoire Ancienne , p. 5). It was repor ted that in a remote region sout h you came to an unknow n great water which bathed Puanta or the hol y land, Ta - nut er. This, we sugge st, was that nearest and largest of all the African lakes, now called the Victoria Nyanza, from which the river Nile debouc hes on its jour ney nor th. We gather from the inscriptions of Der - el - Bahari that the inha bitants of that Puanta for which the expe dition of Queen Hatshepsu sailed were lake - dw ellers. The hous es, bui lt on piles, were 262 reached by means of ladde rs, and pile - dw ellings imply that the peopl e of Puanta were dw ellers on the lake. Further, it is recorded on the monum ents that two naval expe diti ons were made by the Egypt ians to the land of Puanta. The first occurred in the reign of Sankh - Ka - Ra, the last king of the eleventh dyna sty, long before the expe dition to Puanta was made in the time of Queen Hatshepsu (eight eenth dyna sty). The leader of th is earlier expe dition was a nobl eman named Hannu, who describes his passage inland through the desert and the cultivated land. On his return to Egypt from the gol d land, he speaks of"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"com ing back from the land of Seba, and thus far identifies the one with t he other. He says: “When I returned from Seba, or Sebœ a, I had executed the king’ s com mand, for I brought him back all kinds of presents which I had met with in the por ts of Puanta, and I came back by the road of Uak and of Hannu” (Inscription, Roha n). In the story of the shipw recked sailor the speaker says of his voya ge: “I was goi ng to the mines of Pharaoh, in a ship that was 150 cubi ts long and 40 cubi ts wide, with 150 of the best sailors in Egypt .” He was shipw recked on an island, which turned out to be in the land of Puanta. The serpent ruler of the island says to the sailor: “I am prince of the land of Puanta.” It is not said that this was the land of the mines, but he was sailing to the mines when he reached the land of Puanta (Petrie, Egyptian Tales, pp. 82, 90) . An inscription found in the tom b of Iua and Thua (of the eight eenth dyna sty), which tom b was rich in gol d, informs us that the gol d had been brough t from “the lands of the sout h.” Also the Mazai tribes are know n to have had relations with the people of Puanta. Puanta, as a geogr aphi cal locality, is said to lie next to the spirit world, or the land of the shades, which is spoke n of as being in the sout h, but as far away as sailors coul d go up - stream; in fact, it was where the celestial waters c ame from heaven at the sour ces of the Nile. This surely means that Puanta, the gol d land, was at the sum mit of this world, and therefore closest to the next, where there was not hing but the firmamental water betwixt them and the islands of the blessed. If Mashona land shoul d prove to be the gol d land of Puanta, this woul d be the geogr aphi cal Puanta, not Arabia, from which the gol den Hathor and the hawk of gol d originally came. The sym bol ism of the ruined cities of Mashona land, discove red by the expl orer Ben t, suffices at least to show that the Egypt ians of a very remote age had worked the gol d mines in that count ry. Horus on his pedestal or papyr us is a figur e not to be mistaken, whether the bird is a hawk or a vul ture, for there was also a very ancient Horu s of the vul ture that was the bird of Neith. The hawk or vulture on the pedestal or papyr us (Uat) was inde finitely older than the hum an type of Horus the child in Egypt . Horus as the hawk or vul ture, standi ng on the column within the necklace zone or cestu s, was the child of Hathor ; and these two, Hathor and Horus, were the divine mother and child. The gol d hawk of Horus is conne cted with the Egypt ian mines, whilst precious metals and stone s, especially the turquoi se, were expr essly sacred to the godde ss Ha thor . The Egypt ian godde ss Hathor , as a form of the Earth - mother, was the mistress of the mines, and of precious stone s and metals, called mafkat. It was here she gave birth to the blue - eyed gol den Horus as her child, her golden calf or hawk of gol d. The 263 Egypt ian labour ers who worked the mines of the turquoi se count ry in the Sinaitic peninsula were worshippe rs of this gol den Hathor and the gol den Horus. These two are the divinities most freque ntly invoke d in the religious worship of the Egypt ian offic ers and miners residing in the neighbou rhood of the mafkat mines. Also the name for a mine in Egypt ian is ba or ba - t, and baba, or babait, is a plural for mines, likewise for caverns, grottoes, and lairs unde rground . Moreove r, this district of the Sinaitic mines was designa ted Baba or Babait by the Egypt ian miners. And this name of Baba or Babait, with the plural terminal for the mines, woul d seem to have been preserved and repeated for the Zimbabw e mines in Rhode sia, the Egypt ian word being left there by t he Egypt ian"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"workers. Lastly, as Mafekh or Mafkhe t is a title of Hathor , as mafekh is an Egypt ian name for the turquoi se, for coppe r and other treasures of the mines, as well as of Hathor , one wonde rs whether the name of Mafeking was not also derived from t he Egyp tian word “mafekh. ” The earliest Ta - Neter or hol y land of the Egypt ians, then, was Puanta in the sout h, which was sacred on account of its being the primeval hom e. But in the mythos the place of com ing forth had been given to the sun god in the east , and this became the hol y land in the solar mythol ogy which has been too hastily identified by certain Egypt ologi sts with Arabia as the eastern land. At present we are more conc erned with the original race and its primitive achievement than with the retu rn wave from Egypt in the later ages of the Pharaohs . The oasis in Africa was a heaven on earth, a paradise in nature ready - made in the vast expa nse of papyr us reed. Egypt from the beginni ng was based on the oasis, Uat. We might trace a form of the heptano mis with which Egypt began in the seven oases: the great oasis of Abydos , called Uaht, the great Theban oasis, the oasis of the Natron Lakes, the oasis of El - Kargeh, the oasis of Sinai, the oasis of Dakhe l, and the oasis of Bahne sa. Maspero says the Great Oasis had been at first considered as a sort of mysterious paradise to which the dead went in their search of peace and happi ness. It was called Uit or Uat. As late as the Persian epoc h the ancient tradition found its echo in the name of the “Isles of the Blessed” (Herod. , III, 26), which was given to the Great Oasis. “So soon as the deceased was prope rly equi ppe d with his amulets and formulas, he set forth to seek ‘the field of reeds’” ( D. of C., Eng. trans., p. 183) . The “field of reeds” was the field of Uat, the papyrus reed, which had been repeated in the heavens, from the Uat of Egypt ; the Uat of the oasis, the Uat of the reed land that was in the beginni ng. For thos e who lived on the papyr us shoot s, when this was a primeval food , there was a world of plenty in the region of the lakes, which woul d be looke d back to as a very paradise by thos e who wande red forth into the waterless deserts and suffered cruelly from thirst and hunge r midst the arid wastes of burning sand. In seeking “the field of reeds” th e deceased was goi ng back in spirit to Uthlanga , the cradle in the reeds, or to Karua, the land of the lakes; to Apta, the starting - poi nt; to Puanta, the ever - gol den; to Merta, the land of the two eyes, or som e other form of the primitive paradise, where, as the Ritual has it, he woul d drink the waters of the 264 sacred river at the sour ces of the Nile. This was the land where food and water had been abunda nt enough to furnish a type of everlasting plenty for the land of prom ise in the astronom ical mythol ogy and the eschatology. It is necessary to pos tulate a com mencement in equatorial regions , in order that we may expl ain certain primeval representations in the land of Egypt . We see a deluge legend originating in the wom an’s failing to keep the secret of the water sour ce, which was follow ed by an ove rwhelming, devastating flood . We see that a legend of the first man – he who brought death into the world by disobe ying the law of tabu – is indi genous to the natives of Uganda . A primitive picture of “the beginni ng” is also presented in an African story which was told to Stanley by a native of the Bashko on the Aruw imi River, and called “The Creation of Man.” It is related that “In the old, old time all this land, and inde ed the whol e earth, was cove red with sweet water. Then the water"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"dried up or disappe ared. No living thing was movi ng on the earth, unt il one day a large toad squa tted by one of the poo ls. How long it had lived or how it came into existence was not know n, but it was suspected that the water must ha ve brought it forth from som e virtue of its ow n. On the whol e earth there was but this one toad” — which in relation to water was the frog. Then follow s the legend of “creation. ” The toad becom es the maker of the primal hum an pair which came into being in th e shape of twins (like Sut and Horus, or the Zulu black and white twins in the bed of reeds), and these are said to be “the first like our kind that ever trod the earth.” (Stanley, H. M., My Dark Com pani ons and their Strange Stories, pp. 5 - 30.) The legend we judge to be an African original relating to the primordial water in which the earth was figur ed as a “large toad,” or frog, at the time when no other living thing move d on the earth, and there was no hum an creature know n. The frog floating on the water in the act of breathing out of it was an arresting obj ect to primitive man, and this became a type of earth emerging from the water of space. The cons tellation of Piscis Australis was know n to the Arab astronom ers as the frog. Inde ed, the two fish, the sou thern fish and the whale, were named by them as the two frogs (Higgi ns, W. H., Nam es of the Stars and Cons tellations ). But, whichever type was first, a mons trous frog or huge fish, a turtle or the water - cow , it was a figur e of the earth amidst the firmamen tal water, in the low er part of which was the abys s. And here the primal pair are also born as twins, like Sut and Horus. In Egypt the nor th celestial pol e was various ly imaged as a mount ain - sum mit, an island in the deep, a mound of earth, a papyr us plant or lotus in the waters of immensity, a tree, a stake, a pol e, a pillar, a pyr amid, and other type s of the apex in heaven. In Equa toria there was neither pol e nor pol e - star fixed on high in the celestial nor th. On the other hand, there were two pol e - stars visible upon the two hor izons , nor th and sout h. These, according to the imagery, might be represented by two jackals, two lions , two giraffes, moun tains – the mount and hor izon being synonym ous – two trees, two pillars of the firmament, or by the two eyes of t wo watchers. “Heaven’s - Eye Mount ain” is a Chinese title for the Mount of the Pole (De Groot , Fêtes d’Emoui , I, 74) . This woul d 265 appl y when onl y one pol e - star was visible. But in Equa toria there were two pol es or mount ains with the eyes of two non - sett ing stars upon the sum mits, the onl y two fixed stars in all the firmament. These we hol d to be the “pair of eyes” or merti that were also a pair of jackals in the Kamite astronom ical mythol ogy. But first of the two pol es as pillars. Josephu s has preserved a tradition conc erning two pillars that were erected in the land of Siriad. He tells us that the children of Seth (Egypt ian, Set) were the inve ntors of astronom y, and in order that their inve ntions might not be lost, and acting “upon Adam’s prediction tha t the world was to be destroye d at one time by the force of fire, and at anot her time by the violence and qua ntity of waters, they made two pillars, the one of brick, the other of stone ; they inscribed their discove ries upon them bot h, that in case the pil lar of brick shoul d be destroye d by the flood, the pillar of stone might remain and exhi bit thos e discove ries to manki nd, and also inform them that there was anot her pillar of brick erected by them. Now this remains in the Land of Siriad to this day .” ( Ant ., B. I, ch. 2.) Plato likewise speaks of these two columns in the ope ning of Timæus. The"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"place where the two pillars, or one of them, traditiona lly stood was in the land of Siriad. Where that is no mortal know s, but Seri in Egypt ian is a name for the sout h. Seri is also the mount that is figured as the twofold rock which is equi valent to the pillars of the two hor izons , sout h and north. Seri is also the name of the giraffe, a zoot ype of Sut, the ove rseer. Siriad, then, we take to be the land of the sout h w here the pillar “remains to this day.” According to John Greaves, the old Oxford astronom er, “these pillars of Seth were in the very same place where Manetho placed the pillars of Taht, called Seiread” ( Engl ish Weight s and Measures ). It is pos sible to ide ntify the missing pillar of the two, the pillar of Sut in the sout h. There was a sout hern Annu and a northern Annu in Egypt , and pos sibly a relic of the two pol es may be recogni zed in the two Annus, viz., Hermont hes, the Annu of the sout h, and Heliopol is, the Annu of the nor th. The original meaning of Annu appe ars to have been the place of the pillar, or stone , that marked the founda tion which preceded the - sign of station or dw elling - place. There was an Egypt ian tradition which conne cted Sut, the inve nto r of astronom y, with Annu, as the original founde r of the pillar, which makes him the primary establisher of the pol e. As an astronom ical character Sut was earlier than Shu. The Arabs also have a tradition that one of the pyr amids was the bur ial - place of S ut. The pillar of brick, being less permanent, went dow n as predicted in the deluge as a figur e of the sout hern pol e, whereas the pillar of stone remained for ever as an image of the nor th celestial pol e, or of Annu, the site of the pillar, in the astronom ical mythol ogy. It is repor ted by Diodor us that Annu (Heliopol is in the solar mythos ) was account ed by its inha bitants to be the oldest city in Egypt . Which may have been mystically meant, as Annu was also a city or station of the pol e, the most ancient fo unda tion in the nor thern heaven, described in the eschatology as the place of a thous and fortresses provi sione d for eternity. The two pillars of Sut and Horus were primal as pillars of the two 266 pol es thus figur ed in the equa torial regions as the two suppor ts of heaven when it was first divided in two por tions , sout h and north; and the pillar or mount of the sout h was given to Sut, the pillar or mount of the nor th to Horus. The typi cal two pillars are identified with and as Sut and Horus in the inscrip tion of Shabaka from Memphi s, in which it is said, “The two pillars of the gat eway of the hous e of Ptah are Horus and Sut .” The present interpretation is that the typi cal two pillars or props originated as figur es of the two pol es, the singl e pillar being an ideogr aph of Sut, that these were established in the two dom ains of Sut and Horus to the sout h and nor th of the land in which the veriest dawn of astronom y first occurred, and that the type s were preserved and re - erected in the earth of eternity as the two suppor ts of the heaven suspende d by Ptah for the Manes in Amenta, even as the sky of earth had been upl ifted and sustained by the two pol es of the sout h and nor th in Equa toria. Sut and Horus, then, were the twin props of suppor t twice ove r, onc e in Equ atoria as the two pol es, onc e in Amenta as the two tats of Ptah. Further, two brothers, Sut and Horus, as the founde rs of the two pol es in bui lding the heavens for the ancient mother, may expl ain the American story of the two brothers who planted each a ca ne in the hous e of their grandm other when they started on their perilous jour ney to the land of Kibalba. The old mother was to know how they fared by the flour ishing or"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"withering of the tree or cane, and whether they were alive or dead. Grimm traced the sa me legend in the story of the two gol d children who wished to leave their hom e and go forth to see the world. At parting they say, “We leave you the two gol den lilies: from these you can see how we fare. If they are fresh we are well; if they fade we are i ll; if they fall we are dead.” Now the reason why this story is told in Central America, in Indi a, and in Europe we hol d to be because it was first told in Africa and rende red mythically in Egypt . It appe ars qui te pos sible that a form of the two typi cal p illars which were visible at the equa tor also survives in the two sacred pol es of the Arunt a natives in Central Australia. These peopl e “dow n unde r” have no nor thern pol e or pol e - star of the nor th, but they carry two sym bol ic pol es about with them, which t hey erect wherever they go as signs of locality or encampm ent, bot h of which are limited to the sout h and the nor th. One is called the nurtunj a. This, so to say, is the nor th pol e of the two, and is never met with in the sout h. The other, called a waninga , is always limited to the sout h. The nur tunj a is typi cal of the nor thern and the waninga of the sout hern part of the Arunt a tribe. Each of these, like the Egypt ian tat - pillar, is a sign of establishing or foundi ng, as is show n from its use in the ceremony of young man making. In Greek myth the temple of heaven was raised on high by two brothers, who in one version are Trophon ios and Agamedes, the bui lders of the temple of Apol lo. The sinki ng of Trophoni os into the cave also corresponds to the engul fing of S ut in his goi ng dow n sout h with the disappe aring pol e. One of the two legenda ry pillars of Seth disappe ared, the other remained. And when the nom ads of the equa torial regions had begun the move ment nor thw ard on the way that led them dow n the 267 Nile, t hey woul d gradua lly lose sight of the sout hern pol e - star, and whatsoever else had been conf igur ated with it in the nightly heaven would sink below the hor izon sout h, like a subs idence of land in the celestial waters. Thus in astronom ical mythol ogy a fall f rom heaven, a sinki ng dow n in the waters called a deluge, and a lost primeval hom e were natural occurrences as certain stars or cons tellations disappe ared from sight for thos e who travelled nor thw ard from the equa torial plain. And these celestial events wo uld be told of as munda ne in the later legends of the “Fall” and “Flood” and man’s lost paradise of everlasting peace and plenty. It is enough , how ever, for the present pur pos e that a star or cons tellation first assigne d to Sut sank dow n into the dark abys m sout h, and disappe ared from the ken of the obs ervers who were on their journey of three thous and miles dow n into the valley of the Nile. It is certain that Sut went dow n sout h to som e sort of nether - world, and so became the pow er of darkne ss in Amenta, w hen our earth had been com pletely hol low ed out by Ptah, and Amenta below became the sout h to the circum pol ar paradise in the celestial nor th. The ancient Egypt ians had no antipode s on the out side of the earth. Amenta in the nether - world was their antipode s . Their two pol es were celestial and subt errestrial. The north pol e was at the sum mit of the mount . The sout h pol e was in the root - land of the earth below . The Ritual describes the ways of darkne ss in the entrance to the Tuat as the tunne ls of Sut, which t ends to show that a way to the nether - world was made by Sut when his star and standi ng - ground went unde r in the"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"abys s of the beginni ng in the sout h, where the Egyptians localized the Tuat or entrance to the unde r - world, which was the place of egress for th e life that came into the world by water from “the recesses of the sout h.” Without doubt the cont ention of Sut and Horus began with the conflict of darkne ss and light or drought and water when these were elemental pow ers, and the birthpl ace of the twin br others, one black, one white, was in the bed of reeds. This pha se was cont inue d by the twins that likewise struggl ed for supr emacy in the dark and light halves of the moon , which imaged the light eye of Horus and the dark eye of Sut. But the war extende d t o the whol e of nature, that was divided in halves betwixt the Sut and Horus twins, who were the first - bor n of the ancient mother in two of her several characters. In Central Africa the year is divided into two seasons of rain and drought . These are equi val ent to the two oppos ite dom ains of Horus and Sut as pow ers of good and evil. The winds of the north and sout h follow suit. The wind from the north in the rainy season is warm and wet and beneficent; on the other hand, the wind that com es up from the Sout h Pole is witheringl y dry, the wind therefore of Sut, the pow er inimical to man and animal in phys ical nature. (Johns ton, Brit. Centr. Africa, p. 42.) The desert drought , like darkne ss, was an element assigne d to Sut. As this was the region of drought and st erility and Typhoni an sands , and Sut the tawny - com plexione d was the force that dom inated in the sout h unde r the same name, we may see how and where he first acqui red his character in Egypt ian mythol ogy as representative of the arid desert oppos ed to water, fertility, and food. Thus Sut versus Horus imaged 268 the sout h versus nor th. Sut was deadly as the drought ; Horus was “right as rain.” This cont ention of the com batants and of the sout h versus the nor th was cont inue d in the stellar mythos unt il their r econc iliation was effected by som e other god, such as Shu, Taht, or Seb. When Sut, or his star, went dow n from the hor izon, moun t or pol e in the sout h, he gradua lly sank to the low ermost parts of the abys s which in the eschatology was called the secret ear th of Amenta. Here his character as the ope ner of roads or ways in the astronom y was cont inue d into the Egypt ian eschatology by Ap - Uat or the jackal as the conduc tor of soul s. He was the deity of the dark. In the obl ong zodi ac of Dende rah the two jackals o f the sout h and nor th, cont inue d in the solar mythos , are figured oppos ite to each other. These represent the two forms of Ap - Uat, the ope ner of ways, who was imaged as a jackal, the seer in the dark. One jackal was know n as gui de of the sout hern ways, the other as ope ner of the nor thern ways. No Egypt ologi st has gone further than to sugge st that this nor th and sout h may have been in Amenta — as they also were. But no one has dared to dream of a beginni ng with the primitive paradise in Equa toria. E GYPTIAN W ISDOM . Deluded visionaries, lift your eyes, Be hold the truths fro m which your fables rise!

"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" “The wisdom of the Egyp tians,” said Augus tine, “what was it but ast ronom y?” ( City of God, B. 18, ch. 39. ) The answer is that it was not simply the science of astronom y in the mode rn sense, but astronom ical mythol ogy was the subj ect of subj ects with the ancient “mystery - teachers of the heaven,” as the Egypt ian Urshi or ast ronom ers were self - designa ted. The most pue rile repor t of all which has played false with us so long is the exot eric tradition in the Hebrew Pentateuch. Professor Sayce has asserted that “Babyl oni a was really the cradle of astronom ical obs ervation” ( Hibbe rt Lect., p. 397 ). To which one might reply with the wise Egypt ian, “Do you really know that, or is it that you onl y pretend to know ?” The author of Researches into the Origin of the Cons tellations of the Greeks, Phœ nicians, and Babyl oni ans also claims a E uphr atean origin for these, whilst adm itting that “Egypt was not inde bted to any foreign region for her original scheme of cons tellations , which are entirely or almost entirely distinct” (Robe rt Brow n, Jun. ). But it is useless or pue rile to discuss the gen esis of astronom ical mythol ogy with the African originals om itted, and without allow ing for the alterations that were made by Greeks and Euphr ateans in the cour se of transmitting a celestial chart. To om it the Kamite “wisdom ” from the reckoni ng is to dispe nse with evol ution and leave no ground for a beginni ng — no gauge of time nor data of developm ent. Moreove r, the primary que stion of the origins is not astronom ical but mythol ogi cal. The type s of this Sign - langua ge had 269 been founde d in totemism. These w ere first employed for distingui shing the hum an motherhood and brotherhoods . They were reappl ied to the elemental pow ers in mythol ogy, and afterwards repeated in the cons tellation figur es as a mode of record in the heavens which can still be read by aid of the Egypt ian wisdom , but not by means of the Semitic legenda ry lore. The primitive cons tellations might be described as Egyp tian ideogr aphs conf igur ated in groups of stars, with the view of determining time and season and of registering the prehistoric hu man past. The principle of representation was similar to that of the mode rn teachers who draw their diagrams upon the blackboa rd. In like manne r the mystery teachers of the heavens appr oxi mately shaped the cons tellation figures on the backgr ound of the da rk, to be seen at night and to be expounde d in the mysteries. For example, if they were desirous of memorizing som e likeness of the old primeval hom e in Apta at the horn - poi nt of the earth, this woul d naturally be done by repeating the especial imagery of the equa torial regions at the highe st poi nt of beginni ng in the northern heaven as seen in Egypt . Or, if they wished to show that the river of the inunda tion issued from an abys s of water in the remotest sout h, this coul d be accom plished by constellating t he cour se of the stream in heaven on its long and windi ng way from the star Achernar to the star Rigel at the foot of Orion. Hence the water of the inunda tion was depicted in and as the river Eridanus . The cont est between Horus the lord of light and the se rpent of the dark was made uranogr aphi c in the “Serpent - Holder.” The conf lict betwixt Horus who came by water and the dragon of drought was exhi bited by the Apap - reptile being drow ned in the inunda tion as the mons ter “Hydr a.” The scene conf igur ated in the sout hern heaven where the conque ror Orion rose to bruise the serpent’s head or crush the dragon unde r foot is also represented in the Ritual when Apap is onc e more put in bonds , cut up piecemeal,"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"and subm erged in the green lake of heaven (ch. 39). Other im agery in the planisphe re bears witness to the drow ning of the dragon Apap in the waters of the inunda tion. The mons ter imaged in “Hydr a” is treated as carrion by the crow that is perched upon it, pecking at its dead body . Or, if we suppos e the mystery teac hers of the heavens wished to cons tellate a figur e of the mount of earth amidst the waters of surround ing space, and that this was in the time of the most primitive mound - builders, when no coni cal pillar coul d as yet be carved in wood or stone , how woul d t hey figur e the obj ect - picture forth as a uranogr aph? The earth was thought of as a mount amid the firmamental water, and to image this they woul d naturally raise a mound of earth. At the same time the heap of earth had acqui red a sacred character in relati on to the dead, and had becom e a kind of altar mound piled up with offerings of food . The earliest altar raised had been the mound of earth, and this was used to typi fy the mount of earth. Aratos, speaking of “the sout hern altar’s sacred seat,” calls this cons tellation “a mighty sign. ” Manilius says of the cons tellation, “Ara mundi templum est” ( Astron. , I, 427) . It is traditiona lly conne cted with the war of the earth - born giants or elemental pow ers which were succeeded by the glorious one s or Khut i in the astral 270 mythos . The Mesopot amian mound - bui lders likewise show us that the most primitive type of founda tion was the mound , that the earth - mound passed into the founda tion of brickw ork as the pillar, and the pillar culminating in the Ziggur at. So in Eg ypt the earth - mound led up to the pyr amid with steps, that culminated in the altar - mound of stone . The Chinese still call the altar a mound. Because of its being a figure of the earth amidst the Nun, the altar - mound was raised immediately after the deluge in the Semitic mythos . In this way the teachers who first glorified the storied window s of the heavens, like som e cathedral of immensity, with their pictures of the past, are demons trably Egypt ian, because the Sign - langua ge, the mythos , the legends , and th e eschatology invol ved are whol ly Egypt ian, and entirely inde pende nt of all who came after them. The so - called “wisdom of the ancients” was Egypt ian when the elemental pow ers were represented first as characters in mythol ogy. It was Egypt ian when that prim eval mythology was rende red astronom ically. It is also Egyp tian in the pha se of eschatology. Speaking generally, and it woul d be difficult to speak too generally from the present standpoi nt, the Egypt ian mythol ogy is the sour ce of the märchen, the legends, and the folk - lore of the world, whilst the eschatology is the fount ain - head of all the religious mysteries that lie betwixt the earliest totemic and the latest Osirian, that were ultimately cont inue d in the religion of ancient Rom e. The mysteries were a d ramatic mode of com muni cating the secrets of primitive know ledge in Sign - langua ge when this had been extende d to the astronom ical mythol ogy. Hence, we repeat, the Egypt ian Urshi or astronom ers were know n by the title of “mystery teachers of the heavens,” b ecause they expl ained the mysteries of primitive astronom y. For one thing, a later theology has wrought havoc with the beginni ngs previous ly evol ved and naturally rende red. And we have cons eque ntly been egregious ly misled and systematically dupe d by the S emitic perversions of the ancient “wisdom .” There was inde ed “a fall” from the foot hol d first attained by the Egypt ians to the dismal swamp of the Assyrian and Hebrew legends . In Egypt ian mythol ogy com pared with the"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Babyl oni an the same type s that represent evil in the one had represented good in the other. The old Great Mother of Evil, called the Dragon - hor se in the Assyrian version, was neither the sour ce nor the produc t of evil in the original. The serpent - godde ss Rannut , as renewer of the fruits of earth in the soil or on the tree, is not a representative of evil. We hol d that moral evil in the mythical dom ain is an abor tion of theology which was mainly Semitic in its birth. The Kamite beginni ng with the Great Mother and the elemental pow ers which are def inite and identifiable enough in the Egypt ian wisdom became conf used and chimerical in Babyl oni an and Hebrew versions of the same Sign - langua ge; the dark of a benight ed heaven follow ed day. Elemental evils were conve rted into moral evil. The type s of good and ill were indi scriminately mixed, pre - eminently so in the reproduc tion of the old Great Mother as Tiamat. Originally she was a form of the Mother - earth, the wom b of life, the suckler, the uni versal mother in an elemental pha se. But the type s of good and evil were conf ounde d in the later rende ring. The creation of evil as a 271 miscreation of theology is plainly traceable in the Akka dian, Babyl oni an, Assyrian, and Hebrew remains. The Great Mother, various ly named Tiamat, Zikum, Nin - Ki - Gal, or Nana, was not originally evil. She represented sour ce in perfect corresponde nce to Apt, Ta - Urt, or Rannut in the Egyp tian representation of the Great Mother, who, how soever hideous , was not bad or inimical to man; the “mother and nur se of all,” the “mother of gods a nd men,” who was the renewer and bringe r forth of life in earth and water. Nor were the elemental offspring evil, although imaged in the shape of mons ters or of zoot ype s. As Egypt ian, the seven Anunna ki were spirits of earth, bor n of the Earth - mother in th e earth, but they were not wicked spirits. The elements are not immoral. These are a primitive form of the seven great gods who sit on gol den throne s in Hades as lords of life and masters of the unde r - world. Moreove r, the seven Nunu or Anuna s can be traced to their Egypt ian origin. In the Cuthean legend of creation we are told that the great gods created “warriors with the body of a bird” and “men with the faces of ravens.” “Tiamat gave them suck.” “Their proge ny the mistress of the god s created.” “In the midst of the (celestial) mount ains they grew up and becam e heroes” and increased in num ber. “Seven kings , brethren, appe ared as begetters” — who are given names as signs of persona lity ( Baby loni an Story of Creation: Records of the Past, N.S., vol . I, p. 149) . Now the seven children of the great Mother as Egypt ian were produc ed as two plus five. The Sut and Horus twins were bor n warriors or fight ers. They are por trayed as two birds, the black vul ture or raven of Sut and the gol d hawk of Horus. These, the first two children imaged as two birds, one of which is black, will or may account for the two bird races, one of which had the face of a raven and were a black race, or were the “black - heads” in Akka d. The Sut and Horus twins were succeeded by five other pow er s, so that there were seven altoge ther, all brothers, all males or begetters — the seven which cons tituted a primary order of gods , as fellow - males who were the “Nunu” of Egypt , which became the Anuna s or primordial male deities of ancient Babyl oni a. But the seven nature pow ers evol ved in the Egypt ian mythos were the offspring of the great Earth - mother, not the proge ny of Apap. They were native to the nether earth, but were not wicked spirits. They are spoke n of in the Ritual (ch. 83) as “thos e seven Uræus - de ities who are bor n in Amenta.” The"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"serpent type is employe d to denot e the pow er, but it is the good serpent, the Uræus - serpent of life and of renewal, not the evil reptile Apap. These the Euphr ateans change d into the seven evil spirits or devils of their t heology. The spawn of Apap in Egypt are the Sebau, which were num berless in phys ical phe nom ena and never were portrayed as seven in num ber. The Euph rateans turned the evil serpent Apap into Tiamat, the old Great Mother in the abys s of birth, where she has been suppos ed to have brought forth the seven pow ers of evil and to have been herself the old serpent with seven heads. In Egypt , happi ly, we get beyond the root age of mythol ogy in Babyl oni a and Akka d. The godde ss Rannut was a form of the Earth - godde ss as the serpent - mother. The serpent brood or dragon proge ny of Rannut are mentione d in the Ritual, where they have becom e a subj ect of ancient know ledge in the 272 mysteries (ch. 125) . Elsewhere they are called the seven divine Uræi or serpents of life. Ther e are no seven serpents of death, no seven evil serpents, in the Kamite representation. The seven Uræi, though elemental, bor n of matter, and of the earth earthy, like their mother, are not evil pow ers; neither are they in the same categor y with the Sebau of Apap or the Sami - fiends of Sut; whereas in the Euphr atean version these have becom e seven wicked spirits as the evil brood of the Great Mother Tiamat. They are also por trayed as the seven heads or potencies of an infernal snake, which had been Egypt ian, but without the seven heads, the type s of good and evil being mixed up toge ther as Euphr atean. The Kamite elemental pow ers were just the pow ers of the elements represented by zoot ype s. They might be som etimes fearsom e, but they were not baneful. The inimi cal forces of external nature, the evil spawn of drought , plague s, dearth, and darkne ss, called the Sebau or the Sami, had preceded these, whereas in Babyl oni a the two categor ies are conf used and the seven have been reproduc ed as altoge ther evil. They are sevenfold in all things evil: seven evil demons , seven serpents of death, seven evil winds , seven wicked spirits; seven in the hol low s of the earth, seven evil mons ters in the watery abys s; seven evil incubi , seven plague s. But even these seven baleful and injurious spirits of Babyl oni a originated as pow ers of the elements, no matter where. Hence the first is a scorpion of rain (cf. the curse of rain); the second is a mons ter with unb ridled mouth (thunde r); the third is the light ning - flash; the four th is a serpent; the fifth is a raging dog; the sixth is a tempest; the seventh is the evil wind. Here the whol e scheme of evil is meteorologi cal, and is based upon bad northern weather (Sayce, Magi cal Texts, H. L., p. 463) . The theologi cal perversion and the degr adation of the type are traceable in Babyl oni a. The seven serpent pow ers were originally the same. In Egypt they are the seven spirits of the earth. And of the seven in Babyloni a it is said in the magical text from Eridu: “thos e seven in the earth were bor n. Thos e seven in the earth grew up. Thos e seven from the earth have issued forth” (Sayce, H. L., pp. 463 - 469 ). Only in Babyl oni a the Great Mother as the crocodi le type of water has been conf ounde d with the Apap - reptile of evil, and made to spawn the evil pow ers in the darkne ss of later igno rance. We can watch the change in a Babyl oni an version of the mythos . The seven nature forces here originated as seven evil pow ers; they were “rebellious spirits” and “workers of calamity” that were “bor n in the low er pa rt of heaven,” or the firmamental deep. ( War of the Seven Evil Spi rits: Records, vol . V; also vol. IX, 143. ) They are called “the forces of"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"the deep,” for ever rising in rebellion. In shor t, they are one with the Sebau of the Ritual, who were the proge ny o f Apap, which have been conf ounde d with the “seven” elemental spirits who were not originally evil. The beneficent great Mother - earth who had been imaged by the sloughi ng serpent as a type of renewal and rejuve nescence was transmogr ified into the serpent o f theology , the very devil in a female guise, the author of evil that was ultimately represented as a wom an who became the mother of the hum an race, and who doom ed her offspring to eternal torment ere she gave them birth in time. The Hebrews follow the 27 3 Babyl oni ans in conf using the Uræus - serpent of life with the serpent of death. The primal curse was brought into the world by Apap the reptile of drought , dearth, and darkne ss, plague and disease, but the evil serpent began and ende d in phys ical phe nom en a. Apap never was a spiritual type , and was never divinized, not even as a devil. The beneficent serpent Rannut represents the mother of life, the giver of food in fruits of the earth or the tree. She is por trayed as the mother bot h in the form of a serpen t and also as the human mother. But good and evil have been badly mixed toge ther in the Hebrew version of the Babyl oni an perversion of the Egypt ian wisdom . The way in which the Kamite mythos was conve rted into Semitic legenda ry lore and finally into Bibli cal history is palpably appa rent in the story of the fall. The wom an offering fruit as temptress in the tree was previous ly represented in Sign - langua ge as the serpent which was the sym bol of renewal in the tree, as is show n when the reptile offers the fru it to the man. Thence came the serpent - wom an, who was a com pound of the zoot ype and the anthrotype , and who was damned as Mother Eve, and deified as Rannut , the giver of the fruits of earth. Conc lusive evidence of the way that change s were made in the appr opriation of the prototype s and their readaptation to the change of fauna , and likewise of later theology, can be show n in relation to the primordial great mother who is Tiamat in Babyl oni a. One of her typi cal titles is the “dragon - hor se,” and as the Egypt ians had no hor se, it might be fancied at first sight that such a com pound type as the dragon - hor se, which also figur es in Chinese mythol ogy , was not Egypt ian. The ancient Egypt ians had no horse, and their dragon was a crocodi le. The hippopot amus was their first water - hor se as male — that is, the water - bul l. As female it was the water - cow . Now , the old first genetrix Apt (Khept, or Ta - Urt), when represented as a com pound figure is a hippopo tamus, that is the water - hor se, in front , and a crocodi le, that is the dragon, behind. The dua l type of Tiamat the dragon - hor se is based on the crocodi le and hippopot amus, which are to be seen com bined in the twofold character of the great Mother Apt, and these two animals were unk now n to the fauna of Akkad and Baby loni a. Th us as Babyl oni an they are not derived directly from nature, but from the mythol ogy and the zoot ype s that were already extant in Egypt as African. Horus, as Sebek, was the great fish of the inunda tion, typi cal of food and water. This great fish is the croc odi le, which was appl ied to Horus as a figur e of force in his capacity of solar god , the crocodi le in Egypt being a prototype of the mythical dragon — not the evil dragon, but the solar dragon, which was know n in relation to Sebek and to Saturn as the dragon of life. In one of the Greco - Egypt ian planisphe res this dragon keeps its original form and remains a crocodi le. It is por trayed as a cons tellation of"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"enor mous magni tude , and is truly the great fish of Horus - Sebek that was first of all a figur e of the inun dation cons tellated in the stellar mythos and reappl ied to the pow er that crossed the waters as the solar Horus of the doubl e hor izon (Drum mond , Œd. Jud. , pl. 2). The onl y form of evil to be found in the abys s was the dark and deadly pow er of drough t, that , as feared, might drink or dry up all the water. This was figur ed as the Apap - reptile 274 or som e other form of the mons ter Hydr a, the prototypa l serpent of the sea. The mother of life in the abys s was the giver of water as the wet - nur se of the world, n ot the destroye r of the water. In Babyl oni a the tree of life was change d into a tree of death. The serpent in the tree that offers fruit for food, as Rannut , the giver of food and representative of Mother - earth, was transformed into the evil serpent that “brought death into the world and all our woe,” but which had originated as a beneficent figur e in the Kamite representation of external nature. The transmogr ifying of Tiamat, the mother of all and suckler of the seven elemental pow ers, into the dragon of evil might be follow ed on other lines of descent, as in the conf lict of Bel - Meroda ch and the dragon. In the Egypt ian representation Apap the dragon of drought is drow ned in the water by Horus of the inunda tion, whos e weapon therefore is the water flood. No w in warring with Tiamat the deluge is the “might y weapon” wielded by Bel. “Bel (launc hed) the deluge , his might y weapon, against Tiamat, inunda ting her cove ring,” or drow ning the dragon of drought . Thus Tiamat is destroye d by Bel with the deluge , where Ap ap was drow ned by Horus in the inunda tion. This again show s that the great Mother Tiamat, the suckler, as the giver of water, had been conve rted into the evil dragon of drought . The good crocodi le has also been transmuted into the evil dragon and portrayed as falling dow n head foremost from the starry sum mit of heaven to be trodde n unde r foot and crushed beneath the heel of Horus, who is Herakles in Greece, Krishna in Indi a, Meroda ch in Assyria. It was the same with other fauna . The pregna nt hippopot amus wa s change d for the always female bear or the pregna nt wom an. The two dogs have been subs tituted for the two jackals of the sout h and nor th, the first two ope ners of the roads in heaven. The eagle of Zeus takes the place of the hawk of Ra, and the raven, the black Neh of Sut; the legend follow s, and the conf lict betwixt the eagle and the serpent is substituted for that of the warring hawk and serpent in the Egypt ian mythos . The huge Apap - reptile of drought and darkne ss has been suppl anted by the chimerical mo nster that is slain by Gilgames the solar god. And when the totemic matriarchate has been follow ed by the patriarchate, and the godde ss of the “living word” in heaven has been change d in the Euphr atean system for the lord who is “the voi ce of the firmament ”; when the waterman has replaced the multimammalian wateress, the cow or sow of an earlier system of signs ; when the heroes, or mighty one s, have been supe rseded by simple shephe rds of the heavenly flocks — it becom es a que stion of very minor impor t who mad e the change s and forged the count erfeits, or whether the originals were deliberately disgui sed by the Akka dians or Babyl oni ans, Phœ nicians or Greeks. In the cour se of the present inqui ry we shall learn that the creation exot erically described in the Semi tic legends of the beginni ng was not cosmogoni cal. Neither was it what one writer has called it, “the cosmogr aphy of appe arances”"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"(Schiaparelli, Astronom y in the Old Testam ent ). It was Uranogr aphy, not cosmogr aphy, and uranogr aphy is Sign - langua ge cons tell ated in the stars. That which has been called “chaos” in the “legends of creation” was a condi tion in which there was neither law nor order, time nor name, nor means 275 of representing natural phe nom ena. But it doe s not mean there were no natural phe nom ena because there had been no mode of expression. “Things ” existed even when they had no name or record in the Babyl oni an mythol ogy. It was never pretende d in the Egypt ian wisdom that there was any creation of the elements. Ground to stand on, food to eat, water to drink, air to breathe, had always been, and were in no wise depende nt upon any mode of representation; whereas the mythical representation did depend upon the elements or nature - forces being already extant to be named or to be cons tellated and be com e pictorial for the pur pos e of the mystery teachers. In no land or literature has the mythical mode of representation been perverted and reduc ed to drivelling fool ishne ss more fatally than in som e of the Hebrew legends , such as that of Jona h and the gre at fish, which is conne cted with the origin of the fish - man in mythol ogy who was bor n of a fish mother whom we shall identify with the cons tellation of the sout hern fish, and Horus of the inunda tion. The most ancient type of the fish was female, as a repre sentative of the great Mother - earth in the water. This as Egypt ian was the crocodi le. She was the suckler of crocodi les in the inunda tion. She was the bringe r forth as the great fish or crocodi le in the astronom ical mythol ogy . One of her children was the c rocodi le - headed Sebek, who made the passage of the Nun by night as sun god in the solar mythos . The fish - man was at first the crocodi le of Egypt , next the crocodi le - headed figur e of Horus who is called “the crocodi le god in the form of a man” (Rit., ch. 88 ). The deceased assum es this form to cross the waters in the nether - world, because it had been a figure of the solar god in the mythol ogy. The conve rsion of the crocodi le god in the Nun to the fish - man of Babyl oni a is thus made plausible. Jona h is a form o f the fish - man in the Biblical story (which is neither mythol ogy nor eschatology) , and therefore a figur e of the solar god who made the passage of the waters as Horus the crocodi le or as Ea the fish - man of Nineveh. As usual in later legend, the anthropom or phi c rende ring refaces and thus defaces the type . It was the fish itself that swam the waters of the inunda tion. It was the typi cal fish that swam the noc turnal waters, or the sun god represented by the might y fish, whereas, this being “history,” Jona h is made mere man, and therefore needed the great fish to carry him across the Nun or to land him at Nineveh. Birth, or rebirth, from the great fish in the Low er Nun is one of the oldest traditions of the race. It was represented in the mysteries and cons tella ted in the heavens as a means of memorial. The great fish that lande d Jona h on dry ground may still be seen as “Ketos” with its enor mous mout h wide ope n at the poi nt of emanation from the Nun, just where the landi ng - place on earth is represented in the equ atorial regions on the celestial chart. Naturally there woul d be som e change s in the cons tellations with the change of fauna as the primitive wisdom passed from land to land, but that is a different matter from working the oracle of the celestial orrery o n behalf of false and therefore all the more virulent theology .

According to the legend related by Berosos, a divine fish - man, Oanne s, or Oan, who had his dw elling in the Persian Gulf or Erythrean Sea, came forth from thence to teach the Chaldeans all they ever kne w, when, as it is said in the native tradition, the peopl e wisely “repeated his wisdom ” ( W. A. I., II, 16, 37 - 71). In all proba bility the instructor as a fish - man in Babyl oni a was represented by Ea, whos e cons ort was Davki or Davki na, the Earth - mother correspondi ng to the Egypt ian Great Mother, one of whos e names was Tef. “Among the chief deities reverenced by the rulers of Telloh was one whos e name is expr essed by the ideogr aphs of a ‘fish’ and an ‘enclosure,’ which served in later days to denot e the name of Nina or Nineveh” (Sayce, Hib. Lectures, p. 281 ). The same sign, i.e., of a f ish, and enclosure in the Egyp tian hierogl yphi cs, signi fies An, to appe al, to show , to teach, as did the fish - man. An in Egypt ian is a name of the teacher, the scribe, the priest. An was the fish in Egypt . An, with the fish for ideograph, is an ancient thr one name that was found by Lepsius among the monum ental titles on a tom b near the Pyramids of Gizeh (Buns en, Egypt’s Place, vol . II, p. 77) . This An, to show , to reveal, An, the fish of the enclosure, An, the teacher, as the fish, is the likeliest original of the Oan or Oanne s who issued from the waters to show the Babyl oni ans how to live, as the mythos was reflected in the later legend. Horus - Sebek was the earliest fish - man know n to mythol ogy . He calls himself the fish in the form of a man. Yet he issued f rom the female fish as a fish, the crocodi le as son from the crocodi le as Apt the mother and not as a man ejected from the mout h of a fish, as the legend reads when ignor antly literalized. The fish - mother also survived in the divine lady Nina, who was repr esented by the ideogr aph of a fish enclosed in a basin of water (Sayce, Hib. L., p. 37), which has the same signi ficance as the fish - mother in the lake at Ascalon. But to reach the beginni ng the bot tom must be plumbed in the abys s or nether parts of the f irmamental Nun upon the out side of the mount by means of which the earth was imaged in the astronom ical mythol ogy . The abys s was know n by various names in different versions of the mythos . It is the Phœ nician baev or deep. It is the bau of the Hebrew Genes is. It is the bau or bahu as Egypt ian. The word bahu is also a name for the god of the inunda tion called the pow er of the sout hern lakes. “I am Bahu the Great” is said four times ove r (in the Magic Papyr us) at the breaking forth of the water pow er from its sout hern sour ce in the abys s of the dragon, the crocodi le, or the Sout hern Fish ( Records, vol . X, p. 149) . The Egypt ian also has an earlier form of the word bahu in “bab,” for the well or whirlpool as a welling sour ce of water. Anot her term for this out ra nce from the Nun is the tepht , which signi fies the abys s, the sour ce, the out let. The Tiavat or Thavath of Berosos is a form of the Great Mother as a type of the watery abys s which is the Egypt ian tepht , the abys s, the sour ce, the well, the hol e from whenc e the water issues, the dw elling unde rground where the dragon - hor se gave suck to her brood of mons ters in the earth. Tepht or Tept is also an Egyptian name for the old first Great Mother as a"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":" 277 figur e of sour ce. This likewise had been appl ied to the pl ace of emanation for the waters of the Nile which issued from the well of sour ce, the bahu, tepht , or tuat. But the tepht of sour ce, the lair of the dragon , the “hol e of the snake” had been the out rance of the Nile from the abys s before there was a godde ss Thavath or Tiamat in Assyria. So was it with the bau, bahu, or bab. These names had been appl ied to the sour ce of the inunda tion itself and localized in Egyp t before they were repeated in the astronom ical mythology to becom e a subj ect of Semitic legenda ry lore. The bau, the bahu, or bab is Egypt ian. The tepht and tuat are likewise Egypt ian; and these names had been (already) appl ied to the sour ce of the inunda tion and to the facts of earth that formed the moul d of the astronom ical mythol ogy. In the later Semitic legend it was said the earth was founde d on the flood , as if it were afloat upon the water of the abys s. But according to the primary expr ession the earth stood on its ow n bot tom in the water, at the fixed centre, with the tree upon the sum mit as a figur e of food and water in vegetation. The mythical abys s of the beginni ng was the welling - place of water unde rground where life was brough t to birth by the Great Mother from the wom b of the Abys s. In the Ritual this is described as the Tuat, a place of entrance to and egress from the low er earth of Amenta. It is a secret Deep that nobody can fathom , which sends out light in the dark, and “its offerings are eatable plants.” It is the birthpl ace of water and vegetation, and therefore, more abstractly, of l ife. The bot tom less pit is a figur e that was derived from this unpl um bed deep inside the earth itself. From this abys s the Mother - earth (as wom b of life) had brought forth her elemental proge ny as the perenni al renewers of food to eat, water to drink, and air to breathe. The Tuat in the recesses of the sout h is likewise identified in the hym ns as the secret sour ce of the river Nile, which is thus traced to the abys s. Such was the birthpl ace of the beginni ng, the birthpl ace of water in the beginni ng from wh ich the papyr us plants arose as the primeval food, and as the fact is registered in the Ritual. In the Magic Papyr us the abys s is com prehensively spoke n of as “the water’s well.” It is the habitat of the dragon called “the crocodi le com ing out of the abys s .” It is also the lair of the Apap - mons ter, of whom it is said by Shu, “If he who is in the water ope ns his mout h, I will let the earth fall into the water’s well,” being the “sout h made nor th, or the earth turned ups ide dow n” ( Records, vol . X). Here the t wo dragons can be identified toge ther as the crocodi le - dragon of water and the Apap - dragon of drought , that were at war from the beginni ng as antagoni sts in the abys s. The strife in the abys s was betwixt the crocodi le of water and the fiery dragon of droug ht, the two dragons of good and evil, Sebek - Horus and the dragon or reptile of Apap. Both were bor n of the abys s; hence the Schol ia on ch. 17 of the Ritual add, “The devou rer com es from the lake of Puanta,” or the water of the abys s which the Egypt ians tra ced to the “recesses” in the sout h. The beginni ng in heaven, as on earth, was with water. Water was the first thing rende red uranogr aphi cally, not created, in the sout hern hemisphe re. This when “gathered into one place” was localized as “the water.” The 2 78 "},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Egypt ians had a huge sout hern cons tellation dedicated to Menat the wet - nurse, called “the Stars of the Water” (Egypt ian Calenda r of Astronom ical Observations ). The “Sout hern Fish” and “Ketos” are bot h depicted in this water of the sout h or the abys s. A ratos, speaking of the stars in the neighbour hood of these great fishes or mons ters of the deep, says “they are all of them called ‘the water’” (Aratos, line 399 , Brow n). Earth, the Great Mother, was imaged in the sout h. She was represented in two mythical characters. In one she is the mother who brought forth on dry ground, as the hippopot amus (or its equi valent type ); in the other she was the mother of life in water who is figur ed as the Sout hern Fish low dow n in the deep of the sout hern heaven. In mytho logy that which has been called “creation” begins with dupl icating by dividing: darkne ss was divided from light , dry land as breathing - place was divided from water; the nor th was divided from the sout h, and earth was divided from heaven, as in the Japanese creation. So the pow er of the two mons ters (in the Book of Enoc h) “became separated on the same day, one being in the depths of the sea and one in the desert” — that is, one in the water, as Leviathan (the crocodi le or dragon) , and one as the hippopot amus o n dry ground . Enoc h asks the ange l to show him “the pow er of thos e mons ters and how they became separ ated on the same day of creation, one in the depths of the sea, above the springs of waters, and one in the dry desert.” It is said of the two mons ters tha t they had been prepared by the peopl e of God to becom e food . In this there is a broke n ray of the refracted mythos . The two mons ters had represented food and drink from the first, one as the mother of life in the earth, the other in the waters. These two mons ters were prepared for food in the garden or enclosure of the beginni ng. The name of one is Behemoth, the name of the other Leviathan. Behemoth is the Egypt ian Bekha mut, the female hippopot amus, and Leviathan answers to the crocodi le or dragon of the d eep. The rabbi s repeated a true tradition when they rende red the Biblical “Behemoth” not as a plural of majesty, but as a pair of beasts. They were a pair of beasts in the mythol ogy of Egypt . The female Behemoth was the original Great Mother Kep, or Apt; t he male was her son. The crocodi le also, as zoot ype , was bot h male and female. For his pur pos e, how ever, Enoc h makes Leviathan a male mons ter and Behemoth female. Of cour se the type is or may be differentiated by the sex. The two mons ters in the Egypt ian s tarry scheme are bot h female as two forms of the Great Mother, who was the hippopot amus in her fore - part and the crocodi le behind, or the crocodi le in the sout h and the hippopot amus in the nor th. Thus the hippopot amus and crocodi le which were natural in th e Nile had becom e two huge , inde finite mons ters of legenda ry lore in the Book of Enoc h, and the two survived as the type s of dry and wet, for land and water. The sugge stion now to be made is that the two mons ters of dry and wet, or earth and water, were co nstellated as the Sout hern Fish and Ketos, or the whale, but that the whale has been subs tituted for the hippopot amus by the Euph rateans or the Greeks. The Sout hern Fish on the celestial globe is portrayed in the act of 279 emaning a stream of water fro m its mout h, whereas the mons ter Ketos is depicted as the breather out of the water, the two being representative of the earth as the mother of life in the water called the abys s. In the Sut and Horus mythos the first two children of the ancient mother rep resent the condi tions of dry and wet. They were bor n twins because the"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"condi tions were co - extant in earth and water. In the cour se of time everything that was dry, desiccative, or of the desert was ascribed to Sut, whereas the produc ts of water were assign ed to Horus. Hence the two mons ters were cont inue d as type s of the twins. The hippopot amus of earth as male was given to Sut. The crocodi le of water was given to Horus, to typi fy the fish as food of the inunda tion. The “abys s of waters” is described by Be rosos as the habitat of most hideous beings , which had been produc ed by a “twofold principle” that was as yet undi screted into wet and dry. “The person who was said to have presided ove r them was a female named Omoroca.” Then came Belos “and cut the wom an asunde r, and of one half formed the earth, and of the other half the heaven or firmament.” This is a mode of discreting the twofold principle of the dry earth and the celestial water. The story told by Berosos is a later legenda ry form of the mythos . The d upl ication of the motherhood is the same, but with a change of type . The later wom an has taken the place of the cow that was cut in two, divided, or made twain as the water - cow of earth and the milch - cow of heaven. Omoroca is the Great Mother who was one a s the representative of earth, and was then divided to becom e the representative of earth and water. The formation of earth and heaven out of the halves is identical with separating earth and water and distingui shing wet from dry. The “creation” with whic h we are now conc erned is uranogr aphi c as a mode of fashioni ng and giving names to the earliest cons tellation figur es, thos e that were truly primitive. Thus in the beginni ng of the astronom ical mythol ogy there is a figur e of unc reated ground that stands in space or amidst the firmamental water. If we use the word “creation,” which has been so ignor antly abus ed, the first creation figur ed in the astronom ical mythol ogy was the birth of water or, more abstractly, of life from the water, the sour ce whence came the inunda tion with its blessings to the rainless land of Egypt . As Plutarch repor ts, the Egypt ians held that water was “the beginni ng and origin of all things ” — that was, as an element of life. Hence in the Osirian mysteries the throne of the Eternal rest ed on the element of water, and Horus the child - saviour , the Messu or Messiah, came by water in the pow er of the sout hern lakes. So in the bui lding of the heavens the beginni ng was with water, or the firmament imaged in its aerial likeness. Thus it might b e said the heaven was made from water, as it is said in the Babyl oni an “legends of creation, ” the water based on being the abys s of sour ce. According to the present reading of the data, water had been recogni zed as the first and most vital element of life. Hence the beginni ng of all recorded hum an thought with water. Water in Africa was life inde ed, where drought was very death. Horus on his papyrus as lord of water was the lord of life. One Egypt ian name for 280 heaven is kabhu, derived from water, or th e inunda tion, as “the cool ,” and that which makes cool . Paradise was where water was plenteous. Hence water was divinized as heaven, and heaven is figured in the hierogl yph ics as water suspende d ove rhead, the firmament being held aloft on four sustaining p rops as water lifted up. There was no such crying want of water in Babyl oni a, no such devour ing dragon of drought in Akka d, therefore no such raison d’être for the origin from water as in Africa."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" The birth of water from the aby ss of earth is figur ed in th e “Sout hern Fish.” The star Fom alhaut at the mout h of the Fish denot es the poi nt of emergence whence the stream is seen ascendi ng from its sour ce beneath the cons tellation Aqua rius. A soul of life from the element of water was manifested by the fish as Hor us the crocodi le, also by Horus cradled on the water - plant. Thus the water element was funda mental in the making of the heavens. This was as the firmamental water. Earth as the mother of life and giver of water was portrayed in the abys s as a great fish em aning water from its mout h, which represents the fact that the earth in the abys s had been already recogni zed as giver of life because it was the sour ce of water, the primary wateress or the wet - nur se of mythol ogy . She, the Great Mother, as we read the hea venly story - book, was next cons tellated in the Sout hern Fish as the produc er of life and sustenance from water in the unf athom able abys s. In various legends there is a beginni ng with a world all water. This is one with the Egypt ian Nu or Nun. In the begin ning was the Nun. Thus saith the primordial word. Not in the beginni ng of the heavens and earth, but in the beginni ng of the uranogr aphi c representation or entification in the astronom ical mythol ogy. The Nun is a name in Egypt ian for the firmament when ima ged in the similitude of water, the world that was all water at the intellectual starting - poi nt. There is a relic of the ancient wisdom on one of the Assyrian tablets, the gnos is of which we hol d to be Egypt ian, and that as such it can be unr iddl ed and rea d. As it is said, “the heaven was created from the waters.” The earth was pre - existent. This is called the work of “Ansar and Kisar,” who “created the earth,” i.e., when “creation” had been rende red cosmogoni cally. But “the heaven was created from the wate rs” which were firmamental and uranogr aphi c. The non - Semitic legend of Cutha describes the beginni ng with a condi tion of non - entity or pre - entity; there was not hing but an amorphous world of water. As it is said, “the whol e of the lands were sea”; “the aby ss had not been made” below , nor was there any seat of the gods above . There was no field of reeds; no tree of life had been planted in the midst of an enclosure. There flow ed no stream from the abys s “within the sea” of the celestial water (Pinches, T. G. , Records of the Past, 2nd Series, vol. I, pp. 133 - 153) . This, when bot tom ed, means that configur ation of the signs in the astronom ical mythol ogy had not as yet begun. But as space the firmamental water was extant, and dry earth itself had stood for ever i n the midst thereof; earth and water were the unc reated subs tance which had no beginni ng, any more than they had in the Egypt ian Nun. The mons ters born of Tiamat had their hom e in the ground of earth. It was there she suckled 281 them. Earth as the natur al fact preceded the abys s in the astronom y. As Professor Sayce obs erves, som ewhat naïvely, “There was already an earth by the side of the deep” ( H. L., p. 377) . No. Earth was the ground to go upon in the deep, and this was the Mother - earth which brought f orth in and from the deep that was depicted as the abys s, or as the Great Fish in “the water” of the sout hern heaven. It was in the extreme sout h that the Babyl oni ans also placed their entrance to the unde r - world or the abys s. That is where the Egypt ians h ad already localized the out ranc e from this mysterious region whence the inunda tion came. Here was the “Ununa it” or place of springi ng up that was first appl ied"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"to water in the pre - solar mythos , the water that was pictured in its rising from the fish’s mou th. The abys s or great deep of the beginni ng was represented in the mysteries as the Lake of the Great Fish. It was related by Ktêsias of Knidos that the sacred lake was seen at Bamb  kê or Hierapol is. It was also said that in this lake the life of Derketô, daught er of Aphrodi te, was saved by the fish. And as the great fish of Kam was the crocodi le, the likelihood is that the Lake Moeris, sacred to the crocodi les in Egyp t, was also a form of the lake which rep resented the place of birth that was com memorated in the mysteries and told of in the legends as the abys s of the beginni ng, the birthpl ace or font al sour ce of water=life. A figur e of the “abys s” or “deep” survives still in the “basin.” Large ewers filled with water were used for purificatory rites in the Babyl oni an temples. These were called apsu, for “deeps” or “abys ses.” Tanks were used by the Egypt ians for their baptistries. The baptismal font still images the fount of sour ce. As a mythical or celestial locality the Gulf of Eridu is a munda ne form of the abys s that was in the beginni ng. This was the birthplace where the Earth - mother brought forth as a dragon or great fish, the mistress in the abode of the fish. Hence it was the place from whence not onl y the fish - man Oanne s, but the seven fish - like men or Anne dot i, ascende d before the time of the Assyrian deluge . The sour ce of water unde rground most naturally sugge sted the idea of a primordial deep, an unfathom able gul f, a bot tom less pit. This was then ap plied to the point of beginni ng in the low er Nun or firmamental water where the abys s was figur ed in the uranogr aphi c representation. If, as we sugge st, the story of the heavens was written by the race here generalized as “the Egypt ians,” and if that race descende d from the equa torial regions like the great river flow ing from its sour ce, it is to the sout hern hemisphe re we must look for the imagery which first reflects the mythol ogy. The sout hern cons tellations are com paratively few, but their character in relation to the Egyp tian wisdom is unm istakable. Besides which, these uranogr aphs of the beginni ng, or the first time, coul d not all have originated as Euph ratean, because so many of the stars were too far sout h to be seen or cons tellated in Akka d or Baby loni a. The Sout hern Fish is figur ed as the bringe r forth of water — that is, of life or of Horus the fish from the abys s. Ketos the monster represents the mother in anot her character. This, as we sugge st, is the mother in the water emaning life upon dry lan d as did the water - cow . The head of the mons ter is half out of the deep, with jaws agape and gasping like a fish on dry ground , sufficient to show that 282 these are a fish - form of the dua l motherhood that was imaged as a crocodi le and water - cow , as two cow s, as two wom en, or as the wom an Omoroca, who was cut in halves by Belos. If the sphe re is carefully examined it will be seen that a stream of water is gus hing upw ards from the fish’s mout h and appa rently ascendi ng tow ards the figur e of Aqua rius on the ecliptic. Hitherto it has been assum ed that water in heaven always ran dow nw ards from the nor thern pol e into the abys s of the sout h; that the water from the urn of Aqua rius was being pour ed into the mout h of the Sout hern Fish, and the river Eridanus starte d from the star Rigel at the foot of Orion and came to an end at the star Achernar, its cour se"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"being from nor th to sout h, or from right to left of the sphe re. But this reckoni ng has now to be reversed. On the celestial globe , then, the life of the world t hat was bor n of water and imaged as Ichthus the fish is represented still as issuing from the mout h of “the Sout hern Fish.” The word that issued from the fish’s mout h is mentione d by the writer of a hym n to Meroda ch, in which it is said, “The hol y writing of the mout h of the deep is thine” (Sayce, Hib. Lectures, p. 99). If this is right ly rende red, the word of Ichthus had then becom e the written word. Still, it issued from the mout h of the deep, which was that of the fish - mother, or the fish’s mout h. Now , t he mystical emblem know n by name as the Vesica Piscis is still a form of the fish’s mout h, or out ranc e into life. The present writer onc e though t the vesica was uterine. And it is such as a co - type , but not in its origin, because the child first bor n of it was not the hum an child! It is the emaning mout h of that fish which gave birth to water as the life of the world and to the saviour who came to Egypt by water as the fish of the inunda tion. In the langua ge of obs tetrics, the out ranc e of birth is called the os tincæ or tench’s mout h. That is the mout h of the fish, not because the origin in this instance was uterine, but because the fish’s mout h was first, and this has been cont inue d as a sym bol of the birthpl ace when that which was pre - hum an was reappl ied to the hum an organ. In the course of doc trinal developm ent geom etrical and anatom ical figur es are blende d in the vesica as a sym bol of the wom b. It was not so when the great mother (of life in water) was imaged in the Sout hern Fish. It becom es so, to all appe arance, when the door of life is figur ed in the shape of a vesica at the feminine (or western) end of a Christian chur ch. The fish’s mouth was figur ed in the heavens as the primordial doo r of out ranc e into life when the soul of life came to the world b y water. And although the true meaning may have been suppressed by overlaying the doc trine, enough survives in the sym bol s to show that the child Christ in the Virgin’s arms encircled by the Vesica Piscis has the same signi ficance as had the figur e in the planisphe re where the water of life is issuing from the fish’s mout h, and the star of annunc iation is the star Fomalhaut. Only the water of life, still represented by Ichthus the fish, is persona lized in later iconog raphy by the human child as the type of eternal rejuve nescence. The ova l being a co - type with the fish’s mout h, the Virgin and her child are a later equi valent for the divine mother bringi ng forth her fish in the lake, piscina, basin, or other water type of the primordial abys s, as in the astron om ical mythology. The vesica survives in Freemasonr y as well as in the 283 Christian Chur ch, which was founde d on the fish and font in Rom e. It represented an archetypa l and ineffable mystery as a geom etrical sym bol , not one that was simply anatom ical. S peaking of the vesica, Dr. Oliver says this mysterious figur e Vesica Piscis pos sessed an unbounde d influence on the details of sacred architecture, and it cons tituted the great and endu ring secret of our ancient brethren. The plans of religious bui ldings a re determined by its use, and the propor tions of lengt h and height were depende nt on it alone (Oliver, Descrip., p. 109) . The springs of water issuing forth as from the breast of the Mother - earth made her the wet - nur se to her children.

In each of these forms she wa s a type of Mother - earth, as we learn from the mythol ogy . The munda ne sour ce of water touc hes the origin of what has been designa ted the “worship” of wells and springs , which was at first a propi tiation of the supe rhum an pow er of Mother - earth by thos e who needed water, and who, like the Egypt ians, sought to be nursed at the dugs of the cow when rebor n above as the glorified. In Ireland there coul d be no religious place withou t a hol y well. St. Colum bki lle is said to have “sained three hundr ed well - springs that were swift [runni ng]” (Whitley Stoke s, Three Middl e Irish Hom ilies ). “Well worship,” so called, is propi tiation of the pow er in the well. This was the spirit of runni ng water, which as an element had the credit of giving life and the pow er of pur ifyin g. The doc trine is extant as Osirian in the Ritual (ch. 17) , where the water is a lake of healing at which all defects are washed away and all stains obl iterated. The speaker says, “I am purified at the two great lakes” (the lake of natron and the lake of salt) which purify (or sain) the offerings that living men (on earth) present to the great god who is there — that is, Osiris, who had taken the place of the mother as the sour ce of life in water. The poi nt is that the water purified or sained the offerings that were made to the pow er in the lake or well or living spring. But the Great Mother was the first to be solicited for water — she who was the wateress in the abys s, the primary Great Mother in mythol ogy , the water - cow as Apt in Egypt , the water - hor se as T iamat in Babyl oni a. The primordial abys s had originated as the sour ce of water in the earth. The well - spring unde rground was the fact in nature upon which the fabled foun t of immortality and the subt erranean lake of the waters of life were founde d in the divine nether - earth. Water generated by the earth was that which came from very sour ce itself thus visualized as wet - nur se of the world. Every spring or bubbl ing fount of liqui d life that issued from this sour ce below was sugge stive of a deep withou t a bot tom ; the tepht , the bab, or bau of sour ce that was afterwards represented in the astronom ical mythol ogy and cons tellated at the very founda tion of the sout hern heaven as the mystical abys s. The first abys s was in the earth. The abys s of firmamental water i s out side the earth; it is figur ative because celestial. The Nun was heaven entified as water. But there had 284 been two waters actual in external nature, as the waters that rose up in the fount ains, wells, and springs of earth, and the water that fell in dew and rain from heaven. This was por trayed as falling from the tree of wet, which is the Egypt ian tree of Nut or of heaven as water. Thence water from the well was the water of earth, and water from the tree was the water of heaven. These two water so urces in earth and heaven were figur ed as the abys s or well below and the tree of rain above , with Apt or Hathor the Mother - earth in the abys s, and Nut the heavenly mother in the tree of wet above . And these two type s seen in the well and tree are uni versa l signs of so - called “water worship” with the oldest races in the world. The hol y Well or water - hol e is com monl y found beneath the sacred moisture - droppi ng tree. The stone erected as an altar unde rneath the tree is almost as com mon. This was a place of pro pitiation and appe al to the elemental pow er. Libations of blood were pour ed out on the stone . Offerings were suspende d on the tree; gifts were cast"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"into the well and magical invoc ations made. The well suffices to establish the fact that the primitive want was water. But the sour ce was dua l in the water of earth and the water of heaven. The sour ce in earth was imaged in the well as a form of the abys s. The water that fell from heaven was imaged by the tree of Nut. The altar - stone is representative of earth. Thus it is a meeting - poi nt for the sycamore of Nut (the tree of celestial water, as Egypt ian), the altar of earth, and the abys s of water unde r the earth. The object of the rite is the spirit or pow er that sends the water from its “doubl e sour ce” in earth and heaven, with the stone as altar for the sacrificial offering. The Egypt ian old first mother, who is a hippopot amus in front and crocodi le behind, and who is repeated in the Babyl oni an dragon - hor se Tiamat, still survives in British tradition as the wate r - horse or kelpie, and also as the dragon. The river Yore near Middl eham is held to be haunt ed by a water - horse (Longs taffe, Richm onds hire, p. 96) . The River Auld Grandt , that springs from Loch Glaish in Ross - shire, is dreaded as the abode of the water - hor se. Som etimes the presiding pow er of the water in the well is indi cated by the fish, som etimes by the frog. Once the dragon of drought left his co - type in a nor thern hol y well. At the Devil’s Causeway between Ruckley and Acton there is a well in which the animal type is the frog, and the largest of these, which naturally enough appe ars but seldom , represents the devil Apap. In one instance two old wom en are said to keep the secret of the water. These are equi valent to the two fish, the two cow s, and the wom an who was cut in two. The doubl e sour ce of water having been identified as the water of earth and the water of heaven, the type of dua lity was appl ied to the firmamental water in the astronom ical mythol ogy, and heaven, as water, was divided into the two waters of the low er and uppe r firmament, the typi cal being foun ded as a figur e of the actual. These two waters are also cons tellated in the two celestial rivers of Eridanus and the Milky Way. The one reflects the river of the inunda tion, therefore the wate r of earth below , emaning from the low er Nun or the mythical abys s. The other is the “great stream” of the Via Lactea. The inunda tion rose up in the sout h. Its ebullient supe rhum an forces in the Ritual are called the pow ers of the sout h. These pow ers 285 of the sout h are in attenda nce “at the mom ent when the lord of his flood is carried forth and brings to its fulness the force that is hidde n within him” (ch. 64). And when onc e we know which way the river runs in heaven, Achernar in Eridanus becom es our g uide star from the sout h. From that the river travels nor thw ard to Orion’ s foot , or rather to the poi nt at which Orion rises up as Horus of the inun dation. Otherwise, Horus is brough t to birth on his papyr us, as depicted in the Egypt ian drawings . The two waters of earth and heaven are both recognizable in the doubl e sour ce assigne d to the river Nile. In som e of the traditions it is described as emanating from the abys s of earth, in others as falling from the skies. Both origins are mentione d in the Hym n to the Nile. In the first stanza the water is said to descend from heaven. In line thirteen we are told that “the Nile has made its retreat in Sout hern Egypt . Its name is not know n beyond the Tuat.” Thus the retreat of the Nile in the sout h is identifiable w ith the abys s as the earthly sour ce of the inunda tion, and its name is not know n beyond the bounda ry of that other world from whence it issues. In Inne r Africa the rains came from the cool heaven (Kabhu) of the nor th, and therefore in that qua rter (or half ) was the"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"creatory and sour ce of the celestial waters, as the fact was figur ed for ever in the cons tellation of the Water - Cow . In the hymns of ador ation to the Nile the river is addr essed as com ing forth and bringi ng all good things to Egypt from the nor th , whereas the geogr aphi cal Nile came with the inunda tion from the sout h. The Nile that issued from the two lakes of a doubl e sour ce was celestial in the nor th. The Nile that “made its retreats in Sout hern Egyp t” (hym n 13) was the munda ne Nile which came fr om the nor th to the sout h above , and from the sout h to the nor th below . As Hor - Apol lo show s, two of the Egypt ian vases denot ed water from a doubl e source, one being the earth as generator of water, the other heaven when the rains fell in the sout hern parts of Athiopæ ia (B. I, 21) . The urn was a figur e of the inunda tion. Aqua rius was called the cons tellation of the Urn by the Arab astronom ers. We shall unde rstand the sign of “Krater” better if we take it as an extra - zodi acal image of the urn, which not onl y represented the inunda tion and its bount y, but also the abys s of sour ce from which the welling waters came. The two urns are follow ed by the two vases at a later stage. How soever pour ed out , water was the primary means of fertilization. When the godde ss po urs out a libation from her vase – or two divine persona ges from two vases – on the water plant or shoot of palm, the signi fication is the same as when the wet - nur se Hathor suckles Horus as a child or Neith the crocodi le as a calf. According to the most primit ive imagery in Egyp t, the waters of the inunda tion issued from the Mother - earth as the water - cow , the wateress in the primordial abys s or water sour ce. But when the sky was looke d to as a sour ce of water, heaven was represented as the milch - cow , and the ri ver flow ing from the highe st sour ce was imaged as the Milky Way. Thenceforth there were two cow s. The cow of earth was the water - cow , and the milch - cow was the cow of heaven. The water - cow of earth was cons tellated in the stars of the Great Bear, the milch - cow of heaven in the group now know n as Cassiopœ ia, or the Lady in the Chair, which 286 was the earlier cons tellation of the Haunc h or Meskhe n as a figur e of the birthplace when the birth was typi cal of life in water (see fragm ent from a Theban Tom b, p. 289) . T HE D ROWNING OF THE D RAGON The “mystery of evil,” about which theologi ans ignor antly prate, was very simple in its origin. Water, food, and light were naturally good . Their oppos ites – thirst, hunge r, darkne ss, and disease – were as naturally bad. I n this way the origin of evil had its root age in the condi tions of external nature for which man coul d now ise be held respons ible. The rest is mainly the result of a primitive doc trine being develope d in the dom ain of theology . For example, Sut, the anthro pom orphi c devil of the later Egypt ian religion, was previous ly the pre - anthropom orphic representative of drought , dearth, and darkne ss long before the type of evil had been persona lized in the figur e of a satanic Mephi stophe les as the tempter of wom anki nd. Thus the representative of evil, “that old serpent” in mythol ogy, became the aut hor of evil in theology, and the devil was evol ved in the moral dom ain according to the eschatology."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" At the com mencement of mythical representation in Africa we meet the adve rsary of man in the shape of a mons trous serpent or devour ing dragon . This in Egypt is the Apap - reptile, the dragon of drought or the serpent of darkne ss. In one pha se Apap is the devour er of the moon in her eclipse, in anot her it is the destroye r of veget able life, and in a third it drinks or dries up all the water, or there is a mortal fear lest the mons ter shoul d do so. This was the primal adve rsary or prototypa l Satan. There is a saying that “the devil is know n by his long tail,” and the long tail of Sa tan may be seen as the appe nda ge of Apap the serpent of evil in the sout hern cons tellation Hydr a. The Egypt ians also have a class of evil beings called the Sebau. These were the spawn of the reptile Apap, bor n of darkne ss, drought , and other malefic influe nces in phys ical phe nom ena that were found to be inimical to man. The type of Apap, a flat - headed Inne r African snake, is uni versal. It is the Bushm an all - devour er Kwai Hemm, who swallow s the mantis - deity at night and brings him forth again alive by day; i t is the Norse dragon or worm, the Greek pyt hon , the throttling ahi or vrittra of the Vedas. With the Indi ans of Brazil it is still “the great serpent who is the ow ner of night.” It is the snake, toad, or frog (in the legends ) that swallow s all the water i n the world. Possibly the Apap - mons ter of Africa may be recogni zed even by name in Australia. In the centre of the cont inent whirlwinds occur that lift up colum ns of dus t two or three hund red feet in height . The Arunt a call them Apapa . The Warramunga say a n unf riendl y spirit, an Orantja, travels about in these on the look - out to kill black - fellow s. Whether this be the old dragon of the desert or not , it is not iceable that the name of the Apap in Egypt ian signi fies to mount on high, becom e tall, vast, gigant ic, like the swirling dus t and darkne ss of the sand - storm (S. and G., N. Tribes, p. 632) . Here 287 begins the war betwixt the evil serpent and the woman, who is the Great Mother in mythol ogy. It was the Apap - reptile who brought darkne ss, drought , and dea th into the world. The mother was the earliest slayer of the dragon, and the son of the wom an follow ed as her helper. She may be seen as Isis, a form of the luna r godde ss, spearing the head of Apap in the dark waters of night (Wilkinson). She may also be h eard in this character as the Lady of Light , who exclaims, “I light en up the darkne ss and ove rthrow the devour ing mons ter” (Rit., ch. 80) . In the Kaffir folk - tales we find the original mythos of the mons ter in three of its pha ses. In the story of “The Grea t Chief of the Animals” (Theal, p. 163) the victim swallow ed by “the terrible mons ter” is the moon - mother. She tears her way out of the mons ter as the deliverer of herself, and sets free all her children whom the devour er as dragon of darkne ss had previous ly swallow ed. The bow s and arrow s with which the twin brothers kill the mons ter tend to identify their weapon with the luna r bow that was periodi cally drawn and nightly employe d to ove rcom e the pow er of darkne ss. There is perhaps a further hint that the mo ther represents the moon, inasmuch as the children of the wom an had been left for safety in charge of the hare, which is a luna r zoot ype . In anot her Kaffir tale the wom an is mother of the twins who correspond to Sut and Horus as the twin pow ers of light an d darkne ss brought forth by the mother - moon in her dua l luna tion. In a third the swallow er, called “the Inabul ele”. (Theal, p. 79) , is slain by the hero Sikul um , who answers to Horus as slayer of the Apap - dragon."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":" Propi tiation of a supe rhum an nature pow er for food and drink was the most primitive form of the appe al that ultimately culminated, as we know , in worship. The gods of Egypt from the beginning represented food and drink, not onl y as givers of sustenance — they were the sustenance in food and liqui d. The Great Mother was the suckler or wet - nurse. Hathor offered food in the sycamore - fig and Isis in the persea tree of life. Child - Horus was the shoot , the branch, the calf, lamb, or fish. Seb, god of earth, was the father of aliment. Plenty of food and wat er first made heaven palpable to primitive or archaic men on earth. Hence the primitive paradise was imaged as a field of food. At one stage seven cow s were conf igur ated as the type of plenty that was eternal in the heavens. The tree of life was planted in the midst of the celestial oasis. Upon this grew the fruit as food on which the gods and the glorified were fed. The mother of food in the oasis of the papyr us plant, Uat, was divinized in the godde ss Uati, as a mother of all things fresh, flourishing, an d ever - green. The deity Atum - Ra, who first attained the status of “hol y spirit” in the eschatology, says of himself, “I am the food which never perishes” (Rit., ch. 85) . Horus of the inunda tion was cons tellated on his papyr us as the ever - com ing shoot (Plan . of Dende rah); he was also the giver of food as the fish, the calf, and the lamb, that were made celestial type s in the astral mythol ogy. An infinitude of water was an African ideal of the divine. A spring of water welling from the bos om of the earth made her the mother of life, and life that came by water was then divinized in Horus on his papyr us plant as the food - bringe r. Thence came a saviour to the land of Egypt as Horus of the inunda tion; Horus the shoot or 288 natzer, Horus as Ichthus the fish, Ho rus the mother’s child who came by water. It is pos sible to show that Horus on his papyr us or lotus was the African original of Jack who climbed the bean - stalk. It may be premised that the stalk up which the spirit of vegetation climbs to furnish food was an earlier type than the tree of life, and that the fact was preserved in the Egypt ian mythos . Also the tree of Tammuz in Eridu was “a stalk.” Now the lotus in Egypt was literally a bean - stalk. Its large seed was know n as the bean of Egypt . Thus when the l otus=papyr us was employe d for the figur e of food , and Horus, as the elemental spirit of vegetation, ascende d the stalk to take his seat upon “the flow er,” he was the yout h who climbed the “bean - stalk” to slay the giant Apap at first in nature, next in the mythos , and lastly in the legends . When water was the life, and Mother - earth was the sour ce, she was imaged as the great fish, and her young one was the lord of life as the food - bringe r in the inunda tion. Horus of the inunda tion was a real, ever - com ing sav iour of the world as periodi c bringe r of water and the food of life, who came in several characters. In one of which he was the fish. In one he climbed the stalk of the papyr us plant as the soul of vegetation. As the young hero it was he who fough t and ove rcame the dragon of drought at one season and the serpent of darkne ss at anot her. A pow er of perenni al renewal was perceived in nature. This was manifested by successive births. Hence the child - god of Egyp t became a type of the eternal, ever - com ing by rebi rth in time and season and the elements of life and light , which in the character of Horus was at first by food and water. This was the eternal, ever - com ing, ever - renewing spirit of you th. In the illustration from a Theban tomb the Great Mother, who in one form is a crocodi le, has just given birth to her child, Horus, Har - Ur, as the young crocodi le poised on end in"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"front of her. It is a picture of the young child that was brought forth annua lly from the water by the mother, who was cons tellated as the Croco dile or Hippopot amus at the nor thern centre of the planisphe re. The Meskhen, or Birthplace. The history of Horus is depicted in the heavens as if upon the walls and window s of som e vast cathedral of immensity. This was the subj ect of subj ects in the a stronom ical mythol ogy. He was conc eived of a virgin mother in the sign of Virgo. His birth or adve nt was announc ed by the star Phact in the cons tellation Colum bia. The 289 earliest mother who conc eived as a virgin in mythology was represented by the sacr ed heifer of the immaculate Isis. Also by the white vulture in the cult of the Virgin Neith. She was the dove of Hathor in the worship of Ius ā as, the mother of Iusa. The hum an only com es in as a challengi ng element when the mythos is related as history. Wh en the wom an took the place of the heifer, the vul ture, the dove , or other zoot ype of virginity – that is, when the type was hum anized and Horus imaged as a child – the doc trine of incarnation, or the incorpor ation of a spirit of life in matter, had entered in to the hum an sphe re. Thus the mystical virgin and child in hum an gui se, whether in Egypt or in any other land, was a result of doc trinal developm ent, and the doc trine itself coul d not be unde rstood without a know ledge of the earlier pha se. When the type of the Great Mother and her youngl ing had been change d from the totemic zoot ype to the anthrotype , and the godde ss was imaged as a wom an, a child became the figur e of a supe rhum an pow er that was ever - com ing, ever - renewing, ever - repeating, ever - incorpor ating or incarnating, ever - manifesting in phe nom ena. Then the yout hful god was naturally bor n as a child. This was Har - Ur, the child of Isis or the Virgin Neith. Horus the child or shoot , on the papyr us or on his mother’s lap, is representative of the resurrecti on and renewal of life for anot her year. Horus came to Egyp t as saviour of the peopl e from the dreaded drought . He came, inve sted with “the pow er of the sout hern lakes,” to drow n the dragon in the inunda tion.

Horu s brings the water of the inunda tion which is the sour ce of life to Egypt . The little one is cradled on the Nile in his ark of the papyr us reed. He is assailed by Apap, the dragon of drought , who lies in wait to destroy the young deliverer when he is bor n. As bringe r of the waters Horus slays the dragon of drought , which woul d otherwise have drunk the inunda tion dry. He also treads the serpent of darkne ss unde r food as the renewer of light . Unde r the name of Iu - em - hetep, Horus came as the prove rbial “prince of peace.” The word hetep denot es peace or rest, plenty of food , and also good luck. His com ing in this character had a very tangi ble signi ficance, for the inunda tion brought the season of rest to Egypt , which was celebrated by the Uaka festival, when the prince came out of Ethiopi a as the giver of rest to the weary, bread to the hungr y, water to the thirsty, and wine for the periodi c wassail. In the solar mythos Horus became the lord of light , but food and drink were first, according to the hum an needs. The fabled “war in heaven” began with the cont ending elements that strove with each other for supr emacy, whether as light and darkne ss, water and drought , or food and famine. Thus Horus of the inunda tion came by water as the deliverer when the land was suf fering from the dragon of drought . The picture was then cons tellated in the sout hern heaven. Horus the victor was represented by Orion 290 rising from the river and wielding the insigni a of his sove reignt y. His weapon is the club of Herakles in Greece; i t was the whip of ruling power as the Egypt ian khu. He rises from Eridanus as conque ror of the hydr a - dragon that is ove rwhelmed beneath the waters when the drought was put an end to by the lord of life with the water for his weapon. Here is a motive for th e war betwixt the dragon and the infant that was bor n to universal rule or predestined to be king. Horus also came as conque ror of the dragon of darkne ss. But it is of more impor tance to know that the evil reptile Apap represented drought and famine, disea se and death. This was the mortal enemy of man that drank up all the water in the world; hence the battle for the water. All the earth round the warfare of the hero with the mons ter is for water as well as for light , because the mons ter is representative o f drought as well as darkne ss. At first it is the water - reptile in the African lake; then the “hellish snake Apap” drinks up the water of the Nile. In Australia it is the mons trous frog that drinks up all the water. It is also the chimerical, maligna nt wil d beast that is slain by Gilgames. This struggl e, as som e of the drawings show , is literally over the water. Lastly, it becom es the sea - mons ter of the Greek mythol ogy, whereas the original conf lict was for drinki ng water. When Horus came by water as Ichth us the fish who gave himself for food, he swam the deluge of the inunda tion when there was no boa t or ark to breast the waters. But when the bark was bui lt Argo is cons tellated as the ark of Horus. This is figur ed in the planisphe re with the child on boa rd and the devour ing Apap coiling round it seeking to destroy the babe, the infant saviour of the world, who brings the food and water as the lord of life. Now Sothis in its heliacal rising was not the onl y star of annunc iation at the birth of Horus the chi ld.

Still farther was the glorious star Canopus , the pilot of the Argo at the starting - poi nt of the jour ney by water, which was the river Nile as the terrestrial wat er imaged uranogr aphi cally. The Egyptians com memorated the birthda y of the world — that is, of the age, the cycle, the beginning of time, as the day when Horus rose up on the lotus, or papyr us, from the waters of the Nun. Otherwise stated, this was the natal day of Horus in the inunda tion, which was afterwards appl ied to Atum by the priests of On or Annu in the eschatology. Thus the birthda y of the inunda tion was the birthda y of a primordial year, or the birthda y of the world. The cons tellation Hydr a represen ts the Apap - reptile of the Egypt ian mythos . This is a mons ter extendi ng ove r som e one hundr ed degrees in the planisphe re. From lack of better know ledge , this type of evil has been called the “water - serpent,” which gives no clue to its character. It is figu red in the water of the sout hern heaven, and is that fearsom e mons ter which in various legends drinks up all the water. In the later solar mythos Apap, the enemy of Ra, is the blind devour er darkne ss. But as the adve rsary of the elder Horus – he of the inund ation – Apap or Hydr a is the dragon of drought . Drough t in the old dark land was veritably “the curse,” and the evil dragon as its deadly image was the primitive type of phys ical, not of moral evil. The inunda tion was the sour ce 291 of life to Egypt . It wa s her annua l salvation, and Horus, or Sebek the fish - man, was her saviour . The earliest saviour ever know n was the giver of food and drink to thos e who were famishing. This is the origin of a saviour as the shoot of a water - plant, the branch of a tree, or a great fish — the bigge r the better, as a sign of abunda nce. This was how a saviour coul d be represented as Ichthus the fish. This was how a saviour coul d com e by water to the world; hence the subj ect of subj ects was the war of elements, of darkne ss in conf lict with the light , of drough t with the waters, of sterility with fertility, of dearth with plenty. The pow ers of good and evil, represented in the mythos , were also figured in the stars and portrayed in the religious drama as the eternal conf lict of the twins Sut and Horus, of Shu and the impious rebels, of Ra and the Apap - reptile. In the earliest mythos Horus precedes Ra as the eternal antagoni st of the dragon or serpent. This is the first Horus who was the seed of the Great Mother, whom the Semites cal l “the wom an.” He bruised or pierced the serpent’s head at one season, and was bitten by the serpent in the heel at anot her. One was the season of renewal for the waters, for food, for the grow ing light , and for the breezes of the nor th. The other was the season of drought , of sterility, of darkne ss, and for the withering blast of the desert. “In Uppe r Egypt ,” says Maspero, “there is a wide - spread belief in the existence of a mons trous serpent that dw ells at the bot tom of the river Nile” ( Daw n of Civilizati on, Eng. trans., p. 90) . This is the Apap - dragon of evil, especially of drought . Hence the crum bling of the banks and the falls of earth in the dry season are attribut ed to the great serpent which lies at the bot tom of the river, where it was drow ned by th e inunda tion with great rejoicings of the peopl e every year. It is as the fiery dragon of drought that the Apap is spoke n of in an inscription of Amenhe tep III. In this, venge ance is threatened on thos e roya l secretaries who neglect their dut ies to the The ban god Amen - Ra, and it is said, “They shal l becom e like the hellish snak e Apap on the morning of the new year; they shal l be overwhelmed in the"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"great flood” (Brugs ch, Egypt, p. 210 , Eng. trans. in one vol .). The morning of the new year was at that time de termined by the heliacal rising of Sothis as announc er of the inunda tion in which the Apap - dragon of drought was drow ned. This picture is to be seen in the planisphe re with the figur e of the fiery Hydr a ove rwhelmed in the water of the inunda tion. It was re presented in the mythol ogy that when Horus had conque red Apap in one of his great battles the reptile sank, pierced with wounds , into the depths of the waters, and this event was said to have occurred at the very mom ent of the new year (cited by Maspero fr om Birch and Chabas, The Dawn of Civilization, Eng. trans., p. 159 ). This is the exact pos ition of Hydra in the waters of the sout h, as still show n on the celestial globe . Thus Hydr a, as the drow ned, dead reptile, forms a fellow picture in the planisphe re to that of Apap drow ned in the lake of heaven, according to the description in the Ritual (ch. 39) . That Apap was cut up and drow ned in the waters of the inunda tion is likewise show n by the cons tellation Corvus , or the Crow . The bird stands on the body of the mons ter, and, as Aratos remarks (line 449) 292 “seems to peck the folds” of its prey. Corvus thus plays its part as scavenge r of the inunda tion, and at the same time demons trates that Hydr a is drow ned and dead. Thus far we see that certain natural f acts were given a celestial setting as obj ect - pictures in the stars. The abys s of the beginni ng was cons tellated as “the water” low dow n in the sout h. The birth of water from the Mother - earth was figur ed in the Sout hern Fish. Horus, the young deliverer who came by water periodi cally as the bringe r of food , was show n in the shoot of the papyrus plant; he also figur es as Ichthus the fish. The river of the water of life was represented by Eridanus , which can be traced back to its birthpl ace in the abys s, with the inunda tion rushing from the sout hern lakes. Various herald - stars of Horus and the waters, like Fom alhaut, Achernar, Canopus , and Phact, can also be identified according to their rising at different stages of the progr ess made by Horus dow n into the val ley of the Nile. We will now take a turn round the zodi ac, with a view of briefly identifying its signs with the seasons of Egypt and the characters in the mythol ogy, the first and foremost being that of Horus, the eternal, ever - com ing child. As represent ed in the zodi ac, Horus of the inunda tion was conc eived by his virgin mother in the sign of Virgo. This was the prom ised prince of peace who came to rest the weary from their work and to labour for them while they rested, listening to the waters and the we lcom e word the inunda tion brought . Then was the message of good tidings sent as if from heaven itself, which was made know n by the mother of the babe. She first sang the song of invi tation, “Com e unt o me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” The mother of life was now descendi ng with the waters, or with Horus in utero, as the most blessed among wom en the virgin broodi ng ove r her conc eption and inw ardly working out the mystery of fertilization and fulfilment. In the mythical ren dering of natural fact a child or youngl ing had been made prime move r of the universe. “I have set myself in motion,” says Child - Horus (Rit., ch. 42) . “I am the heir, the primary pow er of motion and of rest” (Rit., ch. 63 A ). The doc trine is repeated when t he Greeks maintained"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"that Eros was the primal cause of all things (Hesiod, Theogony ). Babe - Horus in his com ing forth is com pared with the lotus or papyr us issuing from the great stream. The birthpl ace of water (and of food) in the abys s of sour ce became t he birthpl ace of Horus in the inunda tion. This was represented in the later mythos by the swamps and marshes in which Isis hid herself with her babe and suckled Horus in a secret place. The water in which Horus came to Egypt was the inunda tion of the Nile that burst up from the abys s — the bau, the tepht of sour ce in the recesses of the sout h. And as we read the signs , the river Nile was cons tellated in Eridanus as the river of the inunda tion. The name of Eridanus , like the celestial river itself, is very sur e to have had an Egypt ian origin. Eri, later Uri, was an Egypt ian name of the inunda tion, meaning the great, the might y; whilst tun or tanu signi fies that which rises up in revol t, the bur sting forth from the gul f or well of the sout h. Thus rende red, Eri - t ana or Iarutana woul d be the mighty river rising up in the inunda tion and bursting forth from out the birthpl ace in the abys s, as is depicted in the Ritual. If we 293 glance at the river cons tellated on the celestial globe, we see that Eridanus runs one way, from the foot of Orion to the star Achernar, which has been called “the end of the river.” But, if looke d at the other way, Achernar marks the poi nt of departure from the sout h tow ards the nor th. And if this river represents the earthly Nile, the repl ica woul d naturally run the way of the original. That alone will expl ain the cour se of the water and its endi ng at the foot of Orion, who rises from the river as did Horus of the inunda tion com ing “out of Æthiopi a” (or Equa toria), or from that ancient sout h in which the tepht of sour ce was localized at first as “the water,” and afterwards configur ated in the stars that indi cate the river of the inunda tion windi ng on its northw ard way. Other stars announc ed the com ing of the Nile, or the birth of Horus in th e water of the inunda tion. The star Phact, says Lockye r, “so little familiar to us nor therners, is one of the most cons picuous stars in the sout hern por tion of the heavens, and its heliacal rising heralded the solstice and the rise of the Nile before the h eliacal rising of Sirius was useful for the pur pos e. In Phact we have the star sym bol ized by the ancient Egypt ians unde r the name of the godde ss Tekhi , whos e figur e leads the procession of the months” ( Daw n of Astronom y, p. 224) . In the Arabic names of the stars the star Phact is named from a word that signi fies “the thigh, ” and the thigh was an Egypt ian type of the birthpl ace, as we shall find it also figur ed in Egyp t as well as in the northern heaven. Now , the so - called sacred year of the Egypt ians ope ned at a certain starting - poi nt on the first of the mont h Taht, or Tehut i, equi valent to our 20t h of July. But this mont h in an earlier star calenda r is called the mont h of the godde ss Tekhi . Tekh or tekhi is an Egypt ian word for liqui d, to suppl y with drink, and Tekhi is the mont h of the inunda tion. But the mont h Tekhi , or Taht, was not named from the first beginni ng of the inunda tion. The previous mont h, the last of the twelve in the sacred year, was named Mesore, or Mesuri, from mes, for birth, and uri, lat er eri, the inun dation. Thus the actual birth of the river (in one place or other) is marked in the last mont h of the Egypt ian year instead of the first, the que stion being, At what poi nt of the cour se did the actual birth take place? The birth of water, o f Horus as Ichthus , had been indi cated by the star Fom alhaut at the Fish’s mout h; the star Phact was a herald of Horus in the inunda tion; Canopus , the pilot of Argo Navis, show ed that Horus was on boa rd the ark, or on his"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"cradle of the papyr us plant; and t he dog - star Sothis was the later guide to the watchers of the heavens in Egypt . If the arrival of the inunda tion at som e particular poi nt is dated by the heliacal rising of the dog - star in the mont h of Tekhi or Taht (July), the name of the previous mont h s how s the birth of the waters was reckone d to be earlier. This is the mont h Mesore or Mesuri, and Mesore answers roughl y to the mont h of June . In the sacred year the 1st of Mesore corresponds to our June 15t h and to July 25t h in the Alexandr ian year. Obvi ou sly the name of Mesore refers to the birth of the waters farther sout h, which was announc ed by the herald star Fomalhaut, Achernar, Canopus , or Phact, according to their pos ition and to the stage of high water at the different times along the rout e. 294 The seasons in Egypt have been previous ly com pared with the imagery in the planisphe re ( Nat. Genesis ), but might have been more closely verified. There were but two in the beginni ng with the Great Mother and her Sut and Horus twins. These were the seasons of the sum mer waters and the winter drought . The season of the waters and of rest is as plainly pictured in the sout hern heaven as ever it was actual in the valley of the Nile. That qua rter on the celestial globe is full of the inunda tion and its signs , a s it will be for all time. The inunda tion was not onl y pictured in the sout hern heaven rising from its most secret sour ce in the abys s “dow n sout h,” which was figur ed with the mout h of the Fish, and cont inue d runni ng nor thw ard in the river named Eridanus ; it was also cons tellated in the zodi ac, and can be traced there in accordance with the seasons of the year. The earliest hint of the inunda tion is given zodiacally in the month Mesore. In the Greco - Egypt ian planisphe re according to Kircher, Horus is figur e d in the decans of the Twins, at death - grips with the Apap - reptile which the inunda tion com es to drow n. Thus the battle is por trayed twice ove r, onc e as the struggle of Horus (or Ra) and the serpent cons tellated in the decans of the Gemini, and onc e on the ecliptic as the cont est of the Sut and Horus twins. Amongs t the harbinge rs of the inunda tion were the beetles that rolled up their seed in little balls of dung and bur ied them upon the river bank for safety against the com ing flood . The Nile - beetle was f igured where the Crab is cons tellated now . Here begins the imagery of the inunda tion in the zodi ac, with the mont h Mesore. The beetle, bus y on the banks of the Nile, was set above as a uranogr aph which show ed the beginni ng or the birth of the new inunda tio n at som e well - know n poi nt in time and locality. The figure of the beetle rolling up its seed with its tentacles is appa rently repeated in the Akka dian name of this same mont h, which is Su Kulna, the seizer of seed, with Cancer (or the beetle) for its zodi acal sign. An earlier type of Sirius than the dog was the bennu or nictorax. This was a beautiful water - bird that came to Egypt as a herald of the inunda tion, and was given the most glorious of extra - zodi acal signs . The bennu was the prototype of the mythi cal phœ nix. The ibis as a bird of passage also came to fish the waters of the inunda tion. This too was cons tellated for a sym bol . We find it figur ed in a zodi ac attribut ed to the second Hermes — that is, Taht, the luna r deity ( Nat. Gen. plate ). In this the s ign of Cancer is the ibis - headed god . The ibis was a typi cal fisher, and therefore a sign of com ing plenty to the fishers waiting for the waters, and their wealth of food . The lion in the hierogl yphi cs is a figur e of great force, and when the sun had reach ed the"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"lion sign the rushing waters had attained their fullest vol um e. As Hor - Apol lo tells us, the Egypt ians por tray a lion as a sign of the inunda tion, “because when the sun is in Leo it augm ents the rising of the Nile.” Inde ed, he says it happe ns at time s that one half of the new water is suppl ied to Egypt while the sun remaineth in that sign (B. I, 21) , At the same time of year the lion was a figure of the solar force at furnace heat, an image therefore of a doubl e force. In the next sign is the Virgin w ho conc eived the child that represented the food which was depende nt on the waters of the inunda tion. This was indi cated by the later ear of 295 corn, the green wheat ear of the mysteries, which is held in the hand of Neith or Isis in Virgo, and still su rvives in the star Spica of this constellation. The elder Horus came not onl y in the water. He was also the Kamite prototype of Bacchus as the lord of wine. When Horus came the grapes were ripe in Egypt and ready to be conve rted into wine. The season of g rapes is dated July 13t h in the Egypt ian calenda r. There is but little left upon the mode rn globe of the ancient cons tellation of the Vine, but the star Epsilon, called Vinde miatrix is still the sign of grape - gathering, and as we read in the calenda r — “July the 9th: the Nile begins to rise abunda ntly. July 28t h: abunda nce of grapes” (Egyptian Calenda r, A.D. 1878, p. 19) . Vinde miatrix, the sign of grapes being ripe, is described by Aratos as being so large in size and bright in splendour as to rival the stars in the Great Bear’s tail, whereas at present it is but a star of the third magni tude (lines 130 - 140) . The grape - gathering in Egypt is depicted in or near the signs of Virgo and the Vine. It is said of Horus at Edfu, “Thou didst put grapes into the water w hich com eth forth from Edfu.” From that day forth the water of Edfu was called the water of grapes — that is, wine. So anciently was the metaphor of the gos pel miracle founde d on the natural fact. Uaka is a name of the inunda tion, and also of the festival at which the deluge of drink was sym bol ically celebrated by the libation that was correspondi ngl y colossal. The vine was not onl y set in heaven to denot e the vinde mia or time for gathering the grapes, the ove rflow was also figur ed in the cons tellation Crate r, or the Gobl et, as a sign of the “uaka” that was held in Egypt when the land was full of water and the folks were full of wine. When the cons tellation Crater rose it show ed that the urn or vase, an artificial type of the inunda tion, was ove rflow ing with the waters that restored the droopi ng life of Egypt . At that time the Egypt ians celebrated a feast in honou r of Hathor , at which a deluge of drink flow ed freely. It is frankl y described in the inscriptions as “the festival of intoxi cation, ” and was com memo rated at Dende rah in the month of Taht, the mont h of the year that ope ned with the inunda tion and the helical rising of Sothis. Various other fruits were ripe, includi ng dates. Also water - melons were abunda nt. But Horus is the vine, whos e adve nt was celebr ated at the uaka festival with prodi gious rejoicings and a deluge of drink of which the vine and cup, or mixing - bow l, were constellated as celestial sym bol s. The juice of the grape was the blood of Horus or Osiris in the Kamite Eucharist. Hence the sacrame ntal cup was figur ed in the cons tellation “Crater,” the Gobl et, or it may be the jar, from the Egypt ian karau, a jar, the cup having two characters, one in the mythol ogy and one in the eschatology."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":" In an ancient planisphe re reproduc ed by Dupui s ( Planc hes de l’Origine de Tous les Cultes, no. 10) the swallow appe ars in close proxi mity to Isis the virgin of the zodi ac. In the Egypt ian mythos the swallow represented Isis in her character of the widow , when she was wande ring like the bird of passage from one la nd to anot her seeking for her lost Osiris. Thus Isis in her two characters of the virgin and the widow was figur ed in the zodi ac and in the decans 296 of Virgo, which two characters are only to be foun d in Egypt ian mythol ogy . Libra, or the Scales, was a t one time a figure of the equi nox, but its more proba ble origin is in relation to the supr emely important waters of the inunda tion. The four mont hs of the water - season, the first of the three tetramenes, began with the lion, and ende d with the scorpion. T he inunda tion reached its poi nt of equi poi se coincidently with the entrance of the sun into the sign that was figur ed as the Balance or the Scales. The tortoise or abtu of the Nile had been an earlier zodi acal sign than that of the Scales, by which it was supe rseded. When the Nile - tortoise climbed the banks of the river to give itself for food , it naturally became a self - cons tituted sign of the inunda tion to be figur ed in a group of stars. Thus the tortoise=Libra woul d denot e the poi nt at which the earth wa s emerging like a tortoise or a turtle from the deluge of the waters which periodi cally ove rspread the land. The scorpion was not a type of evil in the zodi ac. It represented Isis - Serkh who fought for Horus when the birthpl ace was in Scorpio. A fragm ent o f the myth survives in the Ritual. It is the merest allusion, but suffices to show that in the wars of the solar god (Horus or Ra) with the enemy Apap, Isis - Serkh joined in the battle and was wounde d. The passage is conf used but , as rende red by Renouf , it runs : “Apap falleth; Apap goe th dow n. And more grave for thee is the taste (tepit) than that sweet proof through the scorpion - godde ss (Isis - Serkh) which she practised for thee, in the pain that she suffered.” When the sum mer solstice was in the sign of Leo the autum n equi nox occurred in Scorpio, and it woul d be then and there the scorpion - godde ss gave proof of her sym pathy and suffering on behalf of Horus or of Ra in the latter mythos . It is evident that Scorpio was the sign at one of the cardinal points, f or it is said of Apap in this battle, “Apap is in bonds .” “The gods of the sout h, the north, the west and the east have bound him.” These include the godde sses as helpers. Hence it is said to Apap: “Thy whol e heart is torn out by the lynx - godde ss. Chains a re flung upon thee by the scorpion - godde ss. Slaught er is dealt upon thee by Maati.” (Rit., ch. 39.) About the time of the autum n equi nox the water of the inunda tion began to subs ide. At this poi nt the pow er of Horus in the light was on the wane, and bot h w ere represented now by him who was bor n to die dow n in the dw indling water and the lessening light . The word Serkhu , which is the name of Isis as the scorpion - godde ss, signi fies to breathe, and to suppl y breath. Thus Scorpio is the sign of a breathing - spac e which follow ed the water - season. Whilst the sun was in the cons tellation Libra (or the tortoise) the waters had attained their height and were resting at the equi poi se. Then it entered the sign of Scorpio. The scorpion lived in dry earth, and was onl y to be seen when the waters had subs ided. In som e Egypt ian zodi acs (zodi ac of Esné) the Sagittarius, or Archer, is the com pound figure of a centaur based on the lion instead of the hor se, with the human"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"face of Shu in front and the face of Tefnut the lioness behind. Shu was the elemental pow er of breathing force, and his twin - sister represents moisture. Her name Tef - nut signi fies the dew of heaven, and the dew of heaven was now the water 297 of earth in Egypt , the breath of Shu and moisture of Tefnut being imaged as the pow er of the twin brother and sister. Tefnut , the sister of Shu, was joined with him in his battles on behalf of Horus. “She is like fire against the wicked one s — ” the Sami and the Sebau, “thunde ring against thos e who are to be anni hilated fo r ever,” as it is said in the magical texts. When the sun entered this sign the Nile was failing, the day grew shor ter than the night ; and Horus needed all the help that coul d be given. Hence Shu the fight ing force was conf igur ated as the Archer. Shu, the pow er of the Air, had been against the rebel pow ers of darkne ss and of drought now mustering their forces in the nether - world for renewing the assault. Now here is it more necessary to com pare the face of the unde rlying fact with the mask of the mythos to see how closely the moul d was fitted to the features of nature by the Egypt ians. In Egypt , and in that count ry onl y, can the time of drought be absolutely identified with winter. Now the Apap - dragon in Egypt ian mythol ogy is the dragon of drought , and the d ragon of drought is the fiery dragon. Hence Apap in the form of Hydr a is cut in pieces to be drow ned in the water of the inunda tion. In Egypt onl y did the figur e correspond to fact as the image of droug ht in winter caused by the dragon of darkne ss. And it is this corresponde nce of natural fact to the sym bol ical figur e which will account for the fire - breathing dragon of winter in Europe which survives where it doe s not appl y from lack of the necessary climatic condi tions . The Norse mythol ogy preserves the fi ery dragon as a representative of winter in count ries where it cannot be correlated with heat or drought . It survives with us in the pastime of snap - dragon sacred to the winter season at Christmas. Here the dragon keeps its character as the representative of drought in relation to the prope r season of drought in Egypt as the fire - breathing dragon. Moreove r, the dragon of drought and of darkne ss are one and the same in winter; on that account onl y did the dragon of darkne ss appl y at winter - time in Europe , an d not as the dragon of drought . Yet, the drow ning of the dragon of drought became a Europe an pastime in many lands where there were seldom any lack of water, and never any want of it in winter. According to the seasons of Egypt , at the time when the sun h ad reached the sign of the sea - goa t not onl y had the fresh water of the inunda tion ceased to flow , the water from the Mediterranean travelling upw ards from the sea was now the stronge r current, bitter and brackish and detestable. The sea - goa t is a com pound type of goa t and fish. The fish signi fies water; the water was now com ing from the sea, and the sea - water was naturally imaged by the sea - goa t. Further, it is pos sible that the salt nature of the water at this poi nt was indi cated by the goa t, seeing that a young goa t is an Egypt ian ideogr aph of the word Ab for thirst; or it may be the offensiveness of the goa t represented the repellent nature of “Salt Typhon ’s foam.” When the sun was in the sign of Aqua rius the moon at full had taken up the leadership by night in heaven, as the mother - moon. This was she who fetched the"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"water of life from the low er regions and gave re - birth to vegetation in the uppe r - world. The great godde ss 298 that renewed the light above was also the renewer of the waters from the spri ngs of sour ce in the abys s below . In one legend which, like several others, is com mon to Egypt and Babyl oni a, the Great Mother, as Isis, also as Ishtar, descends into the unde r - world in search of the water of life, otherwise represented as her child, who w as Horus or Tammuz according to the cult. The “Descent of Ishtar” is dated in the Aramaic - Akka dian calenda r by the mont h Ki - Gingi r - na, “the errand of Ishtar,” which was dedicated to the godde ss with “Virgo” as its zodi acal sign. This descent in search of t he vanished water, the lost light , the disappe aring child, was obvi ous ly made by the godde ss in her luna r character. It was as the moon that Ishtar passed through the seven gates on her dow nw ard way when she was strippe d of all her glory. (Talbot , The Lege nd of Ishtar; Records of the Past, vol. I.) This search for the water of life occurs som e five mont hs earlier in the Babyl oni an calenda r than in the Egypt ian year. Plutarch, in speaking of the mysteries, tells us that “on the eve of the winter solstice” th e Egypt ians “carry the cow seven times round the Temple,” which is called “the seeking for Osiris.” (Isis and Osiris, 52.) This in the pre - Osirian mythos was the elder Horus as the mother’s child. Plutarch adds that the godde ss who in one character is the earth - mother was in great distress from want of water in the winter - time. The lost Osiris of the legend was not onl y signi fied by the loss of solar pot ency that Isis went to seek for, it was also the renewal of water that she sighe d for and wept in the fir st drops of the new inunda tion. The disappe arance of the water in Egypt was coincident with the shrinki ng of the sun in the winter solstice; bot h were com memorated in the mour ning of Isis. The jour ney of Isis in search of the water of life was about the ti me of the winter solstice, when the water disappe ared from Egypt and the com ing time of drough t began. The season coincided with the sun in the sign of Aqua rius when the lost Osiris or Child - Horus was re - discove red by the weeping mother seeking for the wat er in the nether - world. The same errand is ascribed to Ishtar in the Babyl oni an version of the mythos . But in the re - adjustment to the change of season in the Akka dian calenda r, the search is given to the mont h Ki - Gingir - na when the sun was in the sign of Virgo. The renewer of the water from the beginni ng was female. At first it was Apt the water - cow . Then Hathor or Nut the milch - cow , then Isis as the weeping - mother who had lost her child. In the legend of Leylet en - Nuktah, or “Night of the Drop,” a miracu lous tear was suppos ed to fall from Heaven on to the Nile, and, according to Pausanias, it was taught that the rise of the river was depende nt on the drops that fell from the eyes of Isis. In the Copt ic calenda r the “Night of the Drop” is dated Baoune h 11t h= June 17t h, by means of which the first drops of the inunda tion coul d be traced to the Great Mother weeping for the lost Osiris, or the earlier Horus of the inunda tion. Now , when the tail of the Great Bear poi nted nor thw ard and the sun coincided with the sign of Aqua rius there was a re - birth of water from the abys s that issued from the mout h of Piscis Australis. The picture of sour ce in the abys s was now repeated, and the wet - nurse or wateress was cons tellated in the zodi ac as the multimammalian Menat, who was a later form of Apt the water - cow ."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" 299 The imagery show s the perenni al sour ce of water in the unde r - world, and that which proceeded from the mout h of the fish now emanates from the num erous mammæ of the wet - nur se on the ecliptic. Thus the birth and re - birth of water are represented six mont hs apart with the Great Bear presiding ove r bot h. In other words the water (or Child - Horus) that was lost to Egypt in the uppe r world was now re - found by the Great Mother seeking in the abys s of sour ce from whence she drew the water of renewal for anot her year. The abys s was founde d in the sout h. Aqua rius is a sout hern sign, and it took six mont hs altoge ther to bring the water from the abys s to its fulfilment in the inunda tion. The sun had reached its “Utat” at the poi nt of sout hing for the region where the Urn of the waters was to be refilled; the Nile replenished from the abys s of sour ce conf igur ated as the fish’s mout h. When the winter - sun was low dow n in the solstice it was sout hing slow ly through the deep out sid e the earth. The hidde n sour ce of water was the same, when represented by the wet - nur se in the zodi ac, as that from which the inunda tion issued in the sout h. There was but one abys s, whether this was indi cated by the fish’s mout h, the dugs of Apt, the fema le breast of Hapi - Mu, or the multi - mammæ of the suckler Menat. At the time when the inunda tion had run dry in Egyp t the February rains were re - com mencing in the equa torial regions . The lakes began to swell and the waters of the White Nile to rise and rush forth on their joyful journey tow ards the nor th. The new flood onl y reached the Delta just in time to save the count ry from drought and sterility. “Krater” was the urn or waterpot of the inunda tion. This in the sout h was brimming full. But when the sun had reached Aqua rius, behol d! the urn was empty. Hence the reversal of the vessel in his hands . The inunda tion was pour ed out . The urn needed to be replenished anew from the well of secret sour ce, or the mout h of the abys s. Hitherto it has been conj ectured th at water from the urn was pour ing dow nw ard tow ard the mout h of the aby ss. But this woul d have no meaning in the mythos by which the imagery has to be interpreted. The water com es up from that welling - sour ce depicted low dow n in the sout h now looke d to for the future inunda tion. When the uranogr aph of Aqua rius is right ly read, we see the last of the inunda tion in Egypt . The water pou red out from the urn has com e to an end. The urn, or buc ket, being at times reversed, is cons eque ntly empty. Also the mode of r eplenishm ent from the tepht of sour ce, or well of the deep, is indicated in the planisphe re. On studyi ng the figur e of the “sout hern fish” we see a stream of water springi ng up from its mout h in the direction of Aqua rius. And this is met by Aqua rius with h is empty urn held in pos ition to receive the water of the new inunda tion from the welling - sour ce in the abys s. In the Osirian mythos Isis, or the cow - headed Hesi, had becom e the wateress or wet - nur se to the world in place of Apt the water - cow and Hathor t he milch - cow ; and now the New Nile was attribut ed to the tears which Isis shed for the lost Osiris or the earlier Child - Horus, when he vanished with the sinki ng water in the unde r - world. It is pos sible to take one step further round the zodi ac and thus in clude the sign of the fishes. But it has to be expl ained that Horus in the zodi ac was not simply the lord of life, as the bringe r of food 300 "},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"and water in the inunda tion. Horus in the zodi ac was also the solar god, who was the child conc eived in Virgo, a s Horus of the inunda tion, who was Horus of the resurrection, lord of the harvest, in the sign of Pisces. In the Greco - Kamite zodi acs the fish - mother gives re - birth to her child as a fish in the cons tellation of the fishes. ( Book of the Beginni ngs , plate.) Also in other monum ents, the mother, as Hathor - Isis, bears the fish upon her head. Thus the fish - man or fish - god was re - bor n of the fish - mother in the abode of the abys s or the hous e of the fish, and the poi nt of emergence for the sun - god in the zodi ac wa s indi cated by the sign of the fish or fishes at the time when the crocodi le was the fish of Neith as Sebek - Horus. No representation of the inunda tion or the drought is directly appa rent in the sign of Aries and Taurus. But the drama was not limited to the zodi ac. The rising Pleiads and the “rainy Hyades” have ever been the harbinge rs of water or of spring. One name of the Hyades in Greek is Hues, the Sow s or Suculæ, and in Egypt , Rerit the Sow was a figur e of the Great Mother as the wet - nur se or suckler, w ho was represented at one time by the seven sow s, at anot her by the seven cow s, at anot her by the many - breasted Menat as the typi cal provi der of plenty. In certain old Egyp tian calenda rs, the periodi c triumph of Horus ove r the plague s of drought and darkn ess was com memorated by a festival called “the woundi ng of Sut .” The event is referred to as occurring on the first of the mont h, Epiphi — May 16t h in the sacred year; June 25t h in the Alexandr ian year. This was exactly one mont h previous to the birth of the new inunda tion dated July 25t h. And as the mont h Mesore agrees with the sun in the sign of Cancer or the beetles, so the mont h Epiphi coincided with the sun in the sign of the Gemini, who were Sut and Horus as the twins cont endi ng for supr emacy in the equ inox or on the mount . At this poi nt Sut was mortally wounde d, and the victory of Horus, the bringe r of water and food and the renewer of light , was perfectly com plete. ( Festival Calendar s of Esné and Edfû. ) Now the worst was ove r. The long hol iday celebrat ed by the Uaka festival had com e at last with its relief. And here the Egypt ian hol iday was one with a hol y day as the time of rest from labour , and the great feast of eating and drinki ng was a mode of giving thanks as well as of making merry. The fulfille r in the water and the grapes was welcom ed in the drink he brought , with the drinki ng and the eating, at the festival of intoxi cation, dedicated to the godde ss Hathor . The history of Horus the child - hero, the eternal Messu who became incarnate as a typi cal saviour of the world, was thus por trayed and coul d be repeated by all who unde rstood the mythos which was depicted in the book above . His birth from the water was imaged by the figur e of Horus on his papyrus, which is represented astronom ically in a scene from the rectangul ar zodi ac of Dende rah. Horus in this is represented by the hawk on the papyr us - plant emerging from the water. By means of this we can identify the birth of the babe who was bor n “from between the kne es of Sothis” (Rit., ch. 65) as Horus of the inunda tion.

Enough to show that the zodi ac was a low er gallery in the pantheon of the Egypt ian planisphe re. And it is not humanly conc eivable that all these gods and godde sses and nature pow ers of Egypt were cons tellated as figur es in the starry vast by any other than the Egypt ian “mystery teachers” of the heavens. There m ay have been som e kind of stellar enclosure round the pol e of Sut in the sout h before a circum pol ar paradise coul d have been conf igur ated in the northern heaven by the Astronom ers in the land of Kamit. But, even so, it is not necessary to assum e a know ledg e of Precession to expl ain the sinki ng of the pol e and its accom panyi ng stars that went dow n in the sout hern Deep. To thos e who travelled nor thw ard from the equa torial regions heading for the valley of the Nile there was an actual subs idence and subm ergenc e of a hum an fore - world in the sout h. This was a matter of latitude determinable by the stars that sank into the abys s, the natural fact that preceded the figur e in mythology. The abys s became the grave as it were of som e lost world which had onc e been rea l on the earth. But the imagery of this far count ry has been preserved twice ove r, and is still extant; onc e in the cons tellation figur es and onc e in the doubl e earth of Ptah’s Amenta. That fore - world of the sout h was reproduc ed by the Egypt ians of the nor th when they raised their circumpol ar paradise to picture for all time som e features of the old primeval hom e. The sout hern pol e star sank into the blind abys s toge ther with the little bit of foot hol d that was first established. This, in later legend, woul d becom e a fall from heaven, or subm ergence in a deluge , as the fact was figured in the astronom ical mythol ogy . Hence we find the legends of the lost paradise: the primal pair as man and cow , the twin brothers, the fall from heaven, the deluge , and other s tories as indi genous produc ts at the centre of the old dar k land. But the grand scheme of uranogr aphi c representation was com pleted in the valley of the Nile where the nor th celestial pol e had 302 becom e the central sum mit of the starry system. The sout h was the scene of so - called “creation. ” The creation which as Egypt ian literally signi fies “of the first time.” And as we learn from the inscription of Tahtmes on the stele of the Sphi nx, the first time goe s back to the days and dom ain of Sut; Sut who is traditiona lly “the inve ntor of astronom y,” and who as such had erected the pillar of the pol e star. The dom ain of Sut was in the sout h. And it is show n by the ancient legends and the primitive cons tellations that the"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"beginni ngs of the astral mythos were in equa toria looki ng sout h. The abys s of water was figur ed in the sout h. The earth - mother in the abys s is in the sout h. The mons ters representative of her huge ness were cons tellated in the sout h. The tree first planted in the abys s was in the sout h. The fore - world that sank dow n beneath the waters of the deluge was in the sout h, and according to the legend lies to - day beneath the waters of Tanga , or the Thigh, in the lake of the birthpl ace, Tanga nyi ka. Egypt was set in heaven as the uppe r land, and low er Egyp t was repeated in Amenta. The name of Egypt is at root Egypt ian. It is derivable from Kep, later Kheb, whence Khept, or Khepti, is a plural for the doubl e land. Kep - Kep, anot her dua l form, had been a name of Nubi a. Kep, or Kheb, signi fies the chamber, the wom b, the birthpl ace. It is likewise a name of the water - cow that was conf igur ated as a type of Egypt in the planisphe re. The hierogl yphi c “Khept” is a sym bol of the birthpl ace. This is the Thigh, the Haunc h, or Meskhe n of the Mother Khept (or Apt). Thus t he Egypt ian Nom e of the “haunc h” was the Nom e of the birthpl ace in Khept, Khebt, or Egypt . When the anthrotype had succeeded the zoot ype we find that Egypt was figur ed as a female lying on her back with feet to the nor thw ard poi nting in the direction of th e Great Bear cons tellation. This was the motherland in the likeness of the hum an mother who had taken the place and pos ition of the African water - cow , an image of the birthpl ace and abode being thus palpably cont inue d (Stoboe us, Ecl. Eth., p. 992 , from a f ragm ent of Hermes) as a figur e of Egypt thus identified by nature and by name as the birthpl ace and bringe r - forth. The “haunc h” or thigh is an ideogr aphi c sign that was cons tellated in the nor thern heaven as a figure of the birthpl ace, and if so in the cel estial chart, assuredly it had the same signi ficance for a birthpl ace on the Libya n bank of the river Nile, hence its elevation to the sphe re as a uranogr aphi c sym bol of locality. A place of settlement is still called the seat, and the “haunc h” in sign - lan gua ge was the seat. Primordially it was the natural seat of the squa tters who sat with heel to haunc h. And the same sym bol was figur ed in the nor thern heaven to denot e the astronom e of the “haunc h” as a seat or birthplace above , whatsoever the birth and wh osoever was the divinized Nom arch. We may be certain it was not without intention that the great pyramid of Gizeh was founde d by King Kufu in the nom e of the “haunc h,” the seat of the Great Mother, Khebt, or Egypt . The inha bitants of low er Egypt also remai ned faithful to the Tree as a twofold sign which is the sycamore of Hathor in the sout h, and the sycamore of Nut in the nor th. There was a territory of the uppe r and lower Oleande r, also of the uppe r and low er Terebin tree. As Maspero remarks, “the princip ality of the Terebin (tree) occupi ed the very heart of Egypt , a count ry well suited to be the cradle of an infant civilization” ( Daw n of Civilization, p. 71, Eng. 303 tr.). “The district of the white wall, marched with that of the haunc h” alongs ide of ea ch other on the Nile, as they were likewise cons tellated in the nor thern heaven. Am - Khemen, the paradise of the eight great gods in the mythol ogy , had its likeness in the nom e of the hare, the chief tow n of which was Khemenu, the present Ashm une in, the to wn of Taht, who was an eight h to the seven gods in the luna r mythos . It was upon the steps of the mound in Khemenu that Shu stood as elevator of the cow of Nut=heaven of the eight great gods , which show s the priority of the nom e in Egypt as the prototype o f the astronom e that was cons tellated in the nor thern stars. Kenset is an"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Egypt ian name for Nubi a, and according to the pyr amid texts there was a celestial locality of the same name in the astronom ical mythol ogy which hol ds the mirror aloft to reflect the Kenset that was prototypa l on the earth, as it likewise reflected the nom es of the haunc h, the tree, the pillar, or others localized at first below . Anot her Egypt ian nom e was called the Serpent - mount ain, which was also repeated above with the great serpen t windi ng round the tree or mount ain of the north celestial pol e. Thus the beginni ngs of the race and the envi ronm ent were depicted for a pur pos e in the heaven of the north, and the field of the papyr us - reed that furnished the primeval food in the sout hern birthpl ace was set in Heaven, as the Aarru - field of peace and everlasting plenty on the sum mit of Mount Hetep at the pol e. In the Ritual (ch. 109) the paradise of plenty, first denot ed by the water plants, has becom e the harvest - field which is surrounde d and protected by a wall of steel. The wheat in this divine dom ain grew seven cubi ts high and was two cubi ts long in the ear. The barley, from which beer was brewed, was four cubi ts in the ear, but the original paradise, the Aarru or Allu, from which the G reeks derived their Elysian fields, was cons tellated as the land of the papyr us reed, the shoot s of which were eaten as the primitive food that grew in the greatest abunda nce in the region of the two great lakes. The most primitive ideal of paradise was th at of an ever - green oasis, in the midst of the African desert, welling with life - giving water, and with the large - leaved sycamore fig tree or dom - palm or the papyr us plant at the centre as a figur e of food. Inne r Africa cont ains the prototype of the Egypt i an paradise in a land of welling waters where the food came of itself and was perpetually renewed, and there was little need for labour . And when the out ward move ments of the wande ring nomads began, and thirst and hunge r were to be faced in waterless waste s of root less desert sand, there woul d be yearnings of regret for the old lost hom e and birth - land left behind, now glorified by distance and the glamour of tradition. And so the uni versal legend grew which was not absolutely baseless. The felicity enjoye d in this primeval land of legenda ry lore is such as was pos sessed at one time on the earth, the uppe r paradise being a subl imated replica of a low er or terrestrial paradise. Thus , the primitive paradise of the Egypt ians, as a land from which the hum an race had com e, was cons tellated in the nor thern heaven as the top of attainm ent in a world to which they were goi ng for an everlasting hom e, and in a clime where food and air and water never failed. 304 In the North, an Egyp t of the heavens was figur ed first within the circle of the Greater Bear. This was the land of Khept, as a celestial locality. The circle was then divided into sout h and nor th, as doubl e Egypt , uppe r and low er, and the two halves were described as the dom ains of Sut and Horus, who were the first two children of the ancient Genetrix, the mother of seven offspring altoge ther. Thus , according to the present reading of the astronom ical mythol ogy, the imagery conf igur ated in the stars was African in origin, and the teachers of its primitive mys teries were Egypt ian. The seven astronom es in the celestial heptanom is of the seven Egypt ian nom es, we hol d to have been figur ed first on earth, and subs eque ntly imaged in the heavens. Follow ing the totemic sept of the sevens Egypt appe ars to have been map ped out first in seven nom es, and this heptanomis below to have been repeated in the"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"planisphe re. Seven nom es are said to have been, according to a later transliteration of names, thos e of the Memphi tes, Heracleopol ites, Crocodi leopol ites, Aphr odi topo lites , Oxyr hync hites, Cynopol ites, and Hermopol ites. The great and lesser oases were cons idered to be parts of the heptanom is (Budge , E. A. W., The Mum my, p. 8). The godde ss of the Great Bear, Khebt or Apt, was mother of the fields of heaven when they cons isted of the seven astronom es. Thos e fields of the papyr us reed were figur ed within the circle made by the annua l turn round of the seven stars about the nor th celestial pol e. This, in the mythos , formed the enclosure of the typical tree, which was planted in t he midst of the garden — the tree of life or food in the celestial waters, otherwise the tree of the pol e in the astronom ical mythology. The cons tellation of the female hippopo tamus (or Great Bear) was the mother of the time - circles. It was a clock or horolo ge, on account of its wheeling round the pol e onc e every four and twenty hour s. This, or the “haunc h,” is obs curely referred to in the text from the Temple of Dende rah, as the clock or instrum ent by which the moon - god, Tehut i, measured the hou rs. Hence, th e hippopot amus remained a hierogl yphi c sign for the hour ( Hor - Apollo, B. II, 20) . The Great Bear was also a clock of the four qua rters in the circle of the year, as is witnessed by the saying of the Chinese: when the tail of the Great Bear poi nts to the ea st it is spring; when it poi nts to the sout h it is sum mer; when it poi nts to the west it is autum n; when it poi nts to the north it is winter. In Egypt , when the Great Bear poi nted to the sout h, or, astronom ically, when the cons tellation had attained its so uthernm ost elonga tion, it was the time of the inunda tion, the birthda y of the year, which was also called the birthda y of the world. Now , this is the particular poi nt at which appa rently the planisphe re, or orrery, was set at starting, whether two thous and or twenty - eight thous and years ago. As the celestial globe has com e to us it looks as if a starting - poi nt in time might still be made out in the year of the Great Bear and the inunda tion with the tail - stars of the Bear as poi nters to the birthpl ace of the waters, com ing from the sout h with their salvation, and with Horus in the ark as the deliverer from the dragon of drough t and thence doc trinally as the saviour of the world. It is a com mon assum ption that the earliest Egypt ian year was a year of 360 days based upon twelve moons of thirty days each. There was such a reckoni ng, and 305 no doubt its origin was luna r. This woul d be attributed to the moon - god, Tehut i (Taht), who was the measurer, although not onl y as the reckone r of luna r time; hence he becam e the ope ner of the year, beginni ng with the first month assigne d to Taht. But, in an older table of the mont hs found at the Ramesseum and at Edfu, the godde ss Tekhi is the ope ner of the year, and not the moon - god , Taht. Here the first mont h has the name o f Tekhi versus Taht. The word Tekhi signi fies a suppl y of liqui d, to suppl y with drink, and the godde ss Tekhi is the ope ner of the year with the inunda tion. We regard this year of the Great Bear and the inunda tion (that of Apt, Menat or Tekhi ) as primary. Next com es the year of 360 days, to which the five days were adde d by Taht; this was luna r, or luni - stellar. The inunda tion was a primary factor in the establishm ent of time in Egypt and the founda tion of the year. The fact is recogni zed in the “Hym n to th e Nile” when it is said “Stable are thy decrees for Egypt ,” that is, in the fixed periodi c return of the waters. Also, as the teacher of time, the Nile is said to be the inspirer of Taht, who was the measurer of time by means of the Great Bear, the moon, a nd the inunda tion. Unde r the name of Tekhi ,"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"the Old Great Mother was the giver of liqui d and suppl ier of drink; as Apt or Khept she was the water - cow with a wom an’s breasts; as Neith she was the suckler of crocodi les; as Rerit she was the suckler in the fo rm of the many - teated sow ; as Hesi (Greek Isis) she was the milch - cow , and as Menat she was the wet - nur se. Unde r all these type s she was primordially the Mother - earth, and funda mentally related to the water - sour ce, or in Egypt to the inunda tion. This is th e Old First Mother who was given the Great Bear as her cons tellation in the nor thern heaven where she became the maker of the starry revol utions or cycles, and thence the mother of the earliest year in time. It was a year depende nt on the inunda tion and de termined by the birth of Horus as the crocodi le - headed Sebek who, like Arthur , was the son of the Great Bear, otherwise the crocodi le of the inunda tion. The birth is represented in the astronom ical fragm ent from a Theban tom b. In this the Old First Mother has just given birth to her young crocodi le and droppe d it in front of her. Thus we behol d the birth of Sebek, which according to the sign - langua ge is equa lly the birth of anot her year, at the moment when the Great Bear’s tail is poi nting to the birthpl ace (see fig., p. 289) . One of the old Egypt ian legends , briefly repeated by Plutarch, may afford us a hint conc erning this beginni ng of the year with the annua l revol ution of the Great Mother in Ursa Major as the hippopot amus or crocodi le. According to this the solar god discove red that the Great Mother, Rhea, had been coha biting secretly with Saturn. He cons eque ntly laid a spell upon her that she shoul d not bring forth a child in either a mont h or a year. Then Hermes being likewise in love with the godde ss copul ated with her, and afterwards playing count ers with the female moon he won from her the seventieth part of each one of her light s. Out of the whol e he com pos ed five days, and adde d these to the three hundr ed and sixty, which days the Egyp tians call th e addi tiona l days. Who then were the Kamite originals of the Greek Rhea, Saturn and Hermes? Rhea, like Apt, or Nut, was the mother of the gods . 306 Saturn the dragon was a form of Sebek, the crocodile - headed Horus, the prototype of the good dragon; and H ermes is the Egypt ian Tehut i, the moon - god. The secret conne ction of the Great Mother with Saturn agrees with the conn ection between the godde ss of the Great Bear and Sebek, who was married to his mother. The year of the Great Bear and the inunda tion, or o f Apt and Sebek, was found to be wrong, and this was righted when Taht - Hermes, the measurer of time by the Great Bear and the moon , had adde d the five addi tiona l days to the earlier year, and thus established the truer cycle of 365 days to the year, by mea ns of his co - ope ration with the moon . Thus the mother of the revol utions established the earliest cycle of time in the circle of the year which ende d when the Bear was poi nting to the birthpl ace of the water in the sout h, and the festival of “the Tail” was celebrated for the com ing of the inunda tion. The tail of the Great Bear, as poi nter or indi cator on the face of the celestial hor ologe , was obvi ous ly still employe d and reckone d with for the Seb - Heb festival, which was celebrated by the Egypt ians every th irty years. This feast, or a section of it, was know n by name as “the Festival of the Tail.” It was the anni versary of som e very special year of years. There was a lord of the thirty - year festival, who was at one period Ptah, at anot her Horus. The birthpl a ce of the inunda tion when the Great Bear poi nted to it in the sout hern quarter was a poi nt for ever fixed in the"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"region of the waters, let us say (for the mom ent) coincident with the sign of Leo. That poi nt did not retrocede. But when the place of birth, a s solar, was shifted to the vernal equi nox and the equi nox receded, the birthpl ace went with it from zodi acal sign to sign. The time of the sun parted com pany with the time of the Great Bear and the inunda tion, for a cycle of 26,000 years. A great change w as made when the time of the inunda tion was suppl emented by the time of the sun. The birthpl ace of Horus (of the waters) had been in the sout h at the season of the year when the tail of the Bear denot ed the birthpl ace in that qua rter of the heavens and the Great Mother presided ove r the birth of the child, the crocodi le or the papyr us shoot . The birthplace in the solar mythos was shifted, and the poi nt was determined by the pos ition of the vernal equi nox as it travelled from sign to sign in the great circui t of precession: from Virgo to Leo, from Cancer to the Twins, from the Bull to the Ram, from the Fishes to the Waterer. Whether in the pre - solar or the solar mythos , whether as Apt, Tekhi or Hathor , the old Genetrix presided ove r the birth of Horus, on thi s great birthda y that was com memorated in Egypt as the birthda y of creation. It was an unpa ralleled meeting - poi nt. The star Phact, in the cons tellation Colum bia, far sout h, announc ed the inunda tion. Canopus show ed the babe on boa rd the bark, ascendi ng from the sout h. Heralded by Sothis, his dog, Orion rose up from the river, at the nor th end of Eridanus , the stellar representative of him who came as Horus of the inunda tion. This adve nt is depicted in the monum ents (Maspero, D. of C., Eng. tr., p. 97) . Thus the Egyp tian sacred year is that of the Inunda tion and the Bear. Its ope ning coincided roughl y with the sum mer solstice – when the solstices had at lengt h been recogni zed – with the sun in the lion - sign. And of course when the solstice, or the sun, was in 30 7 that sign, the vernal equi nox was passing through the sign of Taurus. Now , the earliest year we read of in Babyl oni a is that which ope ned with the vernal equi nox in the sign of the “directing bul l.” This was the same year or cycle, sign for sign, as the Egypt ian sacred year with the solstice in Leo, but with a different point of com mencement, the Egypt ian starting from the solstice; or rather from what had ever been the fixed poi nt of the inunda tion; the Babyl oni an from the vernal equi nox. Khebt, the god dess of the Great Bear, was said to “preside ove r the birth of the Sun.” In the stellar mythos she had presided ove r the birth of Horus in the inunda tion. But when solar time was established the child was solar too, and the sun - god Horus Har - Makhu supe rsed ed Sebek of the inunda tion. His place of birth was shifted to the vernal equi nox, and the birth itself was thenceforth timed no longe r to the inunda tion. Horus, the Child or Messu of the inunda tion, on his papyr us, was now brought forth by Hathor , with Sot his as the Star of Annunc iation. The birth took place in “Sothis,” the birthda y being determined by the heliacal rising of the star, as well as by the Tail of Ursa Major. Khebt, or Apt, the Old First Mother, still presided, as great correlator ove r all, as if she were the midw ife or meskhe nat in attenda nce at the birth when Hathor had becom e the mother. The godde ss Hathor was termed the mistress of the beginning of the year in relation to the rising of Sothis; and Hathor was a form of the hippopot amus - heade d mother of the beginni ngs in the Great Bear, with the milch - cow subs tituted for the water - cow ; bot h being type s of the wet - nur se and giver of the precious liqui d of life. And when the celestial figures of the"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"astral Mythol ogy were cons tellated in the nor t hern heaven the ancient Genetrix had been por trayed already in the three characters of mother - earth, the mother of water, and the mother of breath. But before we have done with the Great Bear Cons tellation in the nor thern heaven we have to poi nt out a prim itive sym bol of her who was figur ed as the mother of beginni ngs by nature and by name. A magical implement com monly called the “bul l - roarer” is found in divers parts of the world. It is one of the simplest things that ever acqui red a primitive sacredne ss from being made use of as a means of invoc ation in the religious mysteries and totemic ceremoni es of the past; an implement that is dyi ng out in Engl and to - day as a toy now called the “fun of the fair.” The Arunt a Chur inga show s that the “whirler,” “roarer ” or thun - thuni e, originally represented the female. Hence it has the pha llic emblem of the vul va figur ed on it as a device in the langua ge of signs . (N. T., p. 150. ) Others of the churinga are wom b - shaped. The ornament of others also indi cates the hum an b irthpl ace. Moreove r, life is portrayed in the act of issuing from the wood, as tree - frogs issued from the tree. Enough to show the primitive nature of the sym bol . It is used in the mysteries as a means of calling the initiates who are about to be made into men. The special dance of the nude young wom en, their exhi bition of the embellished organ and peculiar appe al to the youngs ters, demons trates that the call is made by female nature at the time for that fulfilment of the male which was the obj ect of the ce remony. These wom en were making the visible call that was audi ble in the sound of the bul l - roarer. In the cour se of time the implements had change d hands as 308 the mysteries became more and more masculine and the wom en were exclude d from the ceremoni es. But the Kurnai have two kinds of “Roarer,” one of which represents the inspiring spirit as female; this was primary. At first the “whirler” used in the mysteries to call the initiates for young - man - making was the voice of the female calling on the male, t o becom e a man; to be brave in fulfilling the laws of Tabu and rules of persona l conduc t; to be true to the brotherhood , and “not to eat the forbidde n food .” The forms of the magical instrum ent differ, but all are used for whirling round to make the call. Now Khebt, the Old First Mother in Egypt ian mythol ogy, who was cons tellated in the Great Bear, is por trayed with the “bul l - roarer” held in front of her wom b. The name of the Egypt ian instrum ent is “menai t,” which literally signi fies the whirler, from men t o rotate, to whirl round. Thus the sym bol of the whirling round can be traced to the mother of the revolutions as a figur e in the astronom ical mythol ogy of Egypt. The Great Bear godde ss was por trayed in this pos ition as the “mother of the revol utions ” and the maker of motion in a circle. Hers was the primary pow er that drew or turned, hurled or whirled the starry system round about the pol e, as the might y hippop otamus in the celestial waters. Her names of Rerit and Menait both indi cate the character of rota tor, which is signi fied by the menait in her hands . The godde ss of the Great Bear (hippopot amus) was ador ed at Ombos as the “living word.” She is conf igur ated in the planisphe re with huge jaws wide ope n in the act of uttering the word, or of roaring. The E gypt ian wisdom implies that the menait held in front of the First Mother signi fied the female emblem, the original instrum ent of magical pow er. With the roar of Rerit the water - cow called to her young bul ls, and her roar woul d be imitated by the bul l - roare r, menait or turndun , in calling"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"them, and as the voi ce of the female calling on the totemic mysteries. Thus we find the godde ss Apt, or Khebt the roarer, as a hippopot amus, the Great Bear, “rurring” or whirling round , with the “bul l - roarer” as her sign an d sym bol , at the centre of the nor thern heaven (see fig., p. 124 , also p. 311) . There is a remarkable survival of what may be tentatively termed the cult of the Great Bear amongs t the Manda ites or Sabeans of Mesopot amia, who are worshippe rs of the “living word.” In the performance of their worship the eyes are fixed upon the poi nters of the Great Bear. They celebrate a kind of feast of tabernacles annua lly, for which they erect a tabernacle called the Mishke na or Meskhe n. Lastly, the primordial star - cult o f the Great Bear is also British. In the ancient Welsh mythology the Great Mother Arth is the godde ss of the Great Bear, and Arthur =Horus is her solar son who makes his celestial voya ge with the seven in the ark. Hitherto Egypt ologi sts have been inclined to regard the female hippopot amus (our Great Bear) and the “haunc h” as one and the same cons tellation. This premature gue ss is errone ous . They were both signs of the Great Mother, but in two separate cons tellations which represented two different character s. In the Egypt ian planisphe re, as at Dende rah, the female hippopot amus answers to our Great Bear, whereas the sign of the “haunc h” is on the far side of the Lesser Bear, in the pos ition of Cassiopo ea, the lady in the chair. If 309 we take the tail - star of the Bear as gui de, the cons tellation Cassiopoe a is almost exactly oppos ite. Thus when the tail of the bear is poi nting nor th in winter, Cassiopoe a is at its sout hern elonga tion. These are two different type s of the Great Mother, who was Apt the Earth - Mo ther in one character, as the water - cow , and Nut the Mother Heaven in the other, as the milch - cow . Also in the illustration on a Theban tom b the cons tellation of the “haunc h” is widely distinct from the hippo pot amus. And it is this cons tellation that is di stingui shed by name as the “meskhe n” with the hierogl yphi cs written on it which read, , Mes - khe - n, the wom b as place or chamber of birth depicted in the cons tellation of the “haunc h” or “thigh. ” It is not iceable that the head of the milch - cow is portrayed upon the “haunc h.” This distingui shes the one cow from the other, the milch - cow of Nut from the water - cow of Khebt or Apt, or our Great Bear. It also show s that the “thigh” or “haunc h” belonge d to the milch - cow , and represented the same celestial “seat” a nd place of origin as the later lady in the chair. But, whether it is figur ed as the cow or Meskhe n, the “thigh, ” “haunc h,” or leg of the cow , it signi fied the birthpl ace of the celestial waters in the mythos , and the place of re - birth for soul s in the hea ven of eternity. Then follow s the tampering and retouc hing process of the Euphr ateans, Greeks, or other mode rn claimants to the ancient wisdom . The place of the “seat” or “thigh” was given to a wom an sitting in a chair, and the lady of the chair usurps the throne of Isis with her seat and the pre - anthropom orphi c type that was cons tellated ages on ages earlier in Egypt as the cow of Nut or heaven. The “thigh” in sign - language is a type of birth and thence of the birthpl ace, when the birth was water, as we fi nd it cons tellated in the nor thern heaven. The star “Phact” (in Arabic, the thigh) show s us that this birthpl ace had been cons tellated in the sout hern hemisphe re as the sign of Tekhi the giver of water in the inunda tion. Thus the “thigh” was figur ed bot h i n the sout h and in the nor th to signi fy the birthpl ace and the"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"birth of water. In the sout h the water was the river Nile, and in the north it is the river of the Milky Way. These are the two waters of earth and heaven proceeding from the cow that was the w ater - cow of Apt or Tekhi in the earth, and the milch - cow of Nut in heaven. As before said, one of the two great lakes at the celestial pol e is the Lake of the “Thigh” or “Haunc h,” which is mentione d by name in the Ritual (ch. 149 ). It is also called the Th igh of Khar - aba, at the head of the canal, or Milky Way. The Lake of the Thigh was the birthpl ace of the waters above , where the milch - cow or her “haunc h” was a cons tellated figur e of sour ce whence flow ed the great white river of the Via Lactea. The leg (t high, seat, wom b, or haunc h) of Nut, the celestial cow , onc e stood where the lady in the chair is seated now . Nut, or the milch - cow , was the bringe r to re - birth in this region of the pol e. The Seven Pow ers brought to their re - birth in Seven Great Spirits w ere cons tellated as her children in the Lesser Bear, as seven stars that never set, but were fixtures for eternity. The two cons tellations of the hippopot amus and the “haunc h,” or Meskhe n, are also found in the rectangul ar zodi ac that was carved upon the c eiling of the Great Temple at Dende rah. 310 Hippopotamus and Haunch. As may be obs erved, the two figur es of the hippop otamus and the “haunc h” (or milch - cow ) are yoke d toge ther by a chain, one end of which is held by Apt, and the other is made fast to the “haunc h” or cow . This is in the pos ition of the pole which was the yoke or bond of heaven, and which was know n in Babyl oni a as “the yoke of the enclosure.” The chain show s that the Great Bear was made fast to the pole for security in its swing round. It also show s that the pole was onc e imaged either in or by the cons tellation of the “haunc h,” the seat, or milch - cow in that region. The leg or thigh was an Egypt ian figur e of the pole, as we find it in “the leg of Ptah,” a cons tellation which has been id entified with the lady of the seat. Hence, “above the leg” is equi valent to “ove r the pol e” (Ritual, ch. 7, 74, and 98, Renou f). Heaven as a sour ce of liqui d life that droppe d in dew and rain upon the earth was likened to a cow , or, in sign - langua ge, was the cow . Apt is the cow of earth and"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Nut the cow of heaven. Appa rently the cow of heaven, or Nut, suppl ied the earliest founda tion for the pol e which, as the figure of the cow dislimned, was represented by the leg of Nut (otherwise called the “thigh, ” the “haunch” or “seat”) as the central figur e of suppor t in heaven. The cow being primary, it follows that the “leg of Nut” was an earlier image of the pol e than the “leg of Ptah,” the staff of Anup, or the backbone of Osiris — which were also figur es of fixity whether at or as the pol e of Heaven. The leg or haunc h of the cow was then left standi ng in the midst of the Milky Way. The speaker in the Ritual thus addr esses it, “Oh, thou leg in the northern sky, and in that most cons picuous but inaccessible stream,” w hich is elsewhere termed the canal. In the pyr amid texts it is called “the leg (Uarit) of the Akhemu - Seku,” the stars that never set — the eternals, as a type of stability (Pepi I, 411) . Cassiopoe a, the lady in the chair, also sits in the midst of the Milky Way. Thus the “seat” remains, if onl y as a chair; the white river flow s, with not hing to account for it; and the lake of milk, the cow , the haunc h, thigh or leg of Nut are all dislimned or have passed away. The Great Bear made her circuit on the out side o f the never - setting stars, whereas the “leg” or “haunc h” was a cons tellation in the circle of perpetual appa rition. It never set below the horizon, nor 311 did any of its stars go dow n through all the period of the long great year. Thus the bit of foot ho ld in the watery vast of space was figur ed as the “seat,” the Meskhe n, wom b, or re - birth - place in the heaven of eternity. The deceased, when speaking of his goi ng forth from the tom b, identifies this cons tellation with the place of re - birth above , saying, “I shall shine above the ‘haunc h’ as I com e forth in heaven” (Rit., ch. 74). That is, at the poi nt where the “leg” was cons tellated to show the upw ard way upon the starry map to him who lay looki ng heavenw ard “with a corpse - like face.” The deceased in Amen ta pleads for his re - birth above betwixt the thighs of the divine cow as a type of heaven (Rit., ch. 148) . The Old Great Mother, as the hippo pot amus, we repeat, was not within the circle of the never - setting stars, in the circum pol ar Paradise. It was the m ilch - cow Hesit, not the water - cow , that “gave the white liquor which the glorified one s love ”; the milk that flow ed from the cow , whether she was divinized as Nut, or Mehur it the Heaven, or Hathor , or Isis the cow - headed godde sses. The cow Hesit was design ated “the Divine Mother and fair nur se” as giver of the liqui d of life when this was represented in heaven by the milk of the celestial cow . This identification of the “thigh” as a totally different cons tellation from the Greater Bear will alter the readi ng of certain inscriptions in which the “thigh” and “Bear” have been mixed up toge ther. For example, when the alignm ent was made for the Temple of Hathor to be rebui lt at Dende rah, in the time of Augus tus, the King tells us that he oriented the corners an d established the temple as “it took place before,” whilst looki ng to the sky and directing his gaze to the Ak of the “thigh” cons tellation. Here the “Ak” denot es a central poi nt, the axis or middl e of the starry group . Also when the temple at Edfu was ref ounde d (about 257 - 37 B.C. ) the King who “stretches the measuring - cord” and lays the founda tion - stone is represented as saying, that when doi ng this his eye was fixed upon the Meskhe t or Meskhe n, which has been suppos ed to be in the Great Bear. This also wa s in the cons tellation of the “haunc h,” as may be seen by the fragm ent from a"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Theban tom b (p. 289) where the “haunc h” is labe lled the “Meskhen” or chamber of birth which the cons tellation indi cated; the birth chamber of the cow above , that was copi ed in th e temple of the cow - godde ss below (Lockye r, The Daw n of Astronom y, p. 172 ). The cow of heaven as the milch - cow was por trayed standi ng or resting on the sum mit of the mount which was “conne cted with the sky, ” as portrayed in the monum ents. This, in the Per sian rende ring, was the cow upon the sum mit of Mount Albor z. In the Norse mythol ogy it is the cow Audh um la. As the Prose Edda describes it, “immediately after the gelid vapour s had been resolved into drops , there was formed out of them the cow named Audhum la. Four streams of milk ran from her teats, and thus she fed Ymir” ( Prose Edda 6), just as the cow of heaven suckled Horus. Heaven, as the cow , is called the spous e upon the mount ain. She is the mother of the solar bull, and, as godde ss, is described as s uckling her child Horus, and as having “droopi ng dugs ” (Renouf , B. of D., ch. 62, note 1). The Milky Way was pictured as the celestial water, now called milk, that flow ed from the cow of heaven couc hed upon the 312 sum mit of the mount , the apex of which was at the celestial pol e; whether the cow was called Nut or Hesit, the Arg Roud, Audhum la, or the good lady. Now if we take the lady on the seat and the “haunc h” or “thigh” as a figur e of the cow , the pos ition on the globe is this: the lady of heaven= the cow , or the mistress of the mount , is cons tellated in the middl e of the Milky Way, which runs in two directions dow nw ards from the sum mit of the pol e. If we restore the figur e of the cow or its co - type the “haunc h,” this is the exact spot at which the rive r of milk onc e issued from the cow of heaven that gave her white liqui d to Horus and the glorified; or water to the world in dew and rain. The Milky Way has been disfigur ed sadly by the Greeks, but still runs visibly as the river of the Nun or great deep, the white river that engi rdles all the earth. The river Gange s, issuing from the mout h of the cow , retains the primitive type of a celestial sour ce for the water that fell from heaven, as it was seen by night descendi ng in the river of the Milky Way, or in four streams that issued from the udde r of the cow , which suppl ied a figure of four qua rters to the mount . The cow of heaven, or Nut, as giver of liqui d life, was the earliest mistress of the mount ain, or divine lady of the mound. Then the type of the goo d nur se, the suckler, was made anthropom orphi c and the udde r of the cow was supe rseded by the mammæ of the hum an mother. But it was a long way from the African cow or sow , as the suckler, to the wet - nur se divinized in hum an form. Lastly, the cow of earth was the mother of salt water as well as fresh; both fresh and salt water being found in the African lakes. The Albert Nyanza, for instance, is a salt - water lake, and one of the two lakes of the cow or “haunc h” at the pol e was evidently a salt - water lake, a s the primitive lake of pur ifying and healing. One of these, repeated in Amenta, is called the salt - water lake (Rit., ch. 17) . The Zulu form of this celestial “sour ce” is a young wom an who makes the water. “Leave it to me” says Lu, the Samoan Nut, when the re was no water, and she makes the water, which was salt (Turner, Sam oa, p. 12) . This may account for the origin of salt water in heaven. To very primitive folk urine was the first salt water used for cleansing, pur ifying, and healing. The earliest soap wa s made from the alkali in urine mixed with oil from the hum an skin. The Inoi t, amongs t others, still wash themselves with urine. The Banians of Mom ba wash in cow ’s"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"urine, because, as they say, the cow is their mother. An early type of the mother as wateres s in heaven was the cow , and first of all it was the water - cow . Urine was a very primitive form of hol y water as a means of purifying. At the present time hol y water is yet sained and made sacred by addi ng the ingredient of salt to water that is fresh. Uri ne is also a means of pur ifying when the English school boy, about to bathe in the stream, will micturate dow n his left leg as a protective charm against the raw - head - and - bloody - bone s, our form of the Apap mons ter, lurking at the bot tom of the water. Thus , as the pitiful hum an need was primitively reflected in the African heaven, the earliest water of pur ification, the salt water, the sour ce of the lake of pur ification, 313 was made by the cow . And so unbr eakable is the chain with which the hum an race, its custom s, its theology, and religious sym bol ism are bound toge ther from the beginning that we may be absolutely certain that this is why salt is put into the baptismal font to make the water hol y. This, we think, also touc hes the origin of the “salt wom an” in the Navajo legend who is described as resting at the top of the reed mount ain which rose up beyond the reach of the deluge . When the anthropo morphi c type had been adopt ed the wom an that made the water on the sum mit of the mount took the place of the co w. In such ways the matter of mythol ogy was cont inue d in the heavens on the grand scale of uranogr aphi c representation. In this celestial sign - langua ge, the oldest book of wisdom in the world was written by the mystery teachers and can still be read upon t he starry scroll of ancient night . The “upl iftings of Shu,” are spoke n of and por trayed in the Egypt ian Ritual. The first of these is said in ancient legends to have taken place at Hermopol is, where Shu stood on the mound to raise the firmament. This was the mound by which the mount of earth was imaged in Egypt as the altar of the mound - bui lders, cons tellated in Ara. At least two of Shu’ s upliftings can be identified. In his rôle of An - hur , Shu was the upl ifter of heaven, or Nut, by name. He is por trayed u pon the mount or mound in the at of raising up the cow of Nut with his two hands , or pushing up the heaven assisted by his suppor t - gods . And Kephe us standi ng on the mount with the rod in his upl ifted hand remains a representative of Shu, who stood upon the mound to raise the firmament of Am - Khemen. In his character of An - hur, he was the upl ifter of the sky or firmament in the pre - solar mythos . In the solar mythos he becomes auxi liary to Ra, and is called his son, Shu - Si - Ra. He is now the suppor ter of the su n - god who upl ifts the solar orb upon the mount of dawn, or, as it is also phrased, he brings the eye of light to Ra. In doi ng this he kne els upon the hor izon as the upl ifter. He is the helper of the solar god (Horus or Ra) upon the hor izon when the great b attle was waged against the Apap of darkne ss, who fought so long and fiercely that the god came staggering upw ards fainting from his wounds . (Rit., ch. 39.) It has been said that all tradition respecting the persona ge know n as “the kne eler” has been lost. Aratos kne w nothing of the character. (Brow n, Phai nom ena of Aratos, Introd., p. 5.) But in the Egypt ian astronom ical mythol ogy the god Shu IS “the kne eler” personi fied. In this form he is portrayed upon the hor izon or mount of dawn stoopi ng on bende d kne e to upl ift the solar disk, or to bear it on his head. He who had upl ifted the starry firmament with his two hands , or with the forked stick called his rod,"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"now represented the force that heaved up the sun in the pos ition of “the kne eler.” In the “Phainom en a” Aratos describes “the kne eler” in an attitude of worship with arms upr aised “from bot h his shoul ders each stretching on its side about a full arm’s lengt h.” (Brow n, lines 66, 69.) This is the attitude of Shu, but with the solar disk om itted. “The kne ele r,” then, who is Al Jatha in Arabic and Engo nansin in Greek, we identify with Shu, the deity who kne els upon the hor izon to suppor t his father Ra, the solar god , in his battle with the hos ts of darkne ss. He also passed into the 314 Eschatology as the typ ical kne eler; thence the keeper of the door in the hall of judgm ent is named after Shu, “the kne eler.” The keeper says to the initiate in the mysteries, “I ope n not to thee, I allow thee not to pass by me, unl ess thou tellest my name.” The password, given in reply, is “the kne e of Shu, ” which he hath lent for the suppor t of Osiris, is the name, that is as the suppor ter of the sun - god in the character of “the kne eler.” (Rit., ch. 125. ) Shu - Anhur , in his twofold rôle may still be recogni zed on the celestial c hart in the cons tellations of Kephe us and Leo, partly by means of the doubl e Regul us. As An - hur in Kephe us he stands upon the mount to lift up heaven with his rod or staff, and as Shu or Regul us in Leo he is the suppor ter and upl ifter of the solar orb on t he horizon as “the kne eler.” Shu the Kneeler. A picture in the cons tellation Lyra has survived to show us how the stories of the solar god were given a starry setting on the backgr ound of the dark. If we refer to this group upon the celestial globe we find a figure of the winge d Disk or Hut which still identifies the cons tellation with Horus of Edfu, who is now called Horus - Behut et. What then was the story told of Horus in the stars by night which coul d be read in Lyra when conj oined and illustrated wi th the winge d Solar Disk? We are show n a picture of Horus with his lyre, the prototype of Apol lo with his lyre, and Orphe us with his lute. Horus with the lyre or harp of seven strings was the sevenfold one as a divine type of attainm ent, the octave and the height in music as well as in the bui lding of the heavens. This Horus was"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"the first form of the All - One, or Pan, in whom the Seven Pow ers were uni fied in perfect harmony, or in the music of the sphe res. It was Horus who tore out the sinews of Sut and by d epriving him of pow er turned the discord of the uni verse to harmony . He was cons eque ntly depicted in the cons tellation Lyra as the maker of music that was played on the harp, the lute, the lyre, or the sevenfold pipes of Pan as a figur e of the All - One. Th e Serpentarius, or “Ophi nchus huge ” was cons tellated in the Decans of Scorpio as a figur e of Horus wrestling with the serpent of darkne ss. At this stage in the periodi cal display of the celestial pictures the sun was about to descend into Amenta from the p oint (say) of the Autum n Equi nox in Scorpio, to grappl e with the pow ers of darkne ss, decay, and dearth now rising in rebellion and gathering toge ther for the annua l assault. The drama coul d not be rende red in imagery directly solar; hence the representatio n figur ed as an obj ect picture in the rising stars that show ed the Lord of Light at death - grips with the serpent of the dark, in that sign where Horus or Osiris received his mortal wound . Thus , all along, the Gnosis was pictorially por trayed in heaven. Hen ce when the Osiris obt ains 315 com mand ove r the celestial water he says, “Collector of soul s is the name of my Bark. The picture of it is the representation of my glorious jour ney upon the canal .” The bark of salvation in which the soul s of the glorified were gathered, we repeat, was solar, whilst the picture show n by night was stellar. The canal is the name of the Milky Way, and on this the glorious voya ge was made by the Manes “to the abode of thos e who had found their faces as the glorified.” In anot he r illustration the great ship of heaven, in the solar mythos , is the Ark of Ra. When seen by day, the solar orb is carried on boa rd toge ther with the solar god and the spirits perfected. But the literature of the subj ect, so to say, was represented, and th e story was repeated, nightly in the stars. The blind god “hunge ring for the morn” is a Greek figur e of Orion, which expl ains not hing of itself. But Orion is the stellar representative by night of Horus the solar god in the darkne ss of Amenta who is An - ar - ef the sight less Horus, or Horus as the blind god whos e sight was restored to him at dawn. Several cons tellations , Orion the hunt er, Herakles, Serpentarius, Boöt es, are portraits of Horus conf igurated in his various characters bot h mythical and eschatolog ical. Amsu - Horus was the hus bandm an twice ove r as Egypt ian; onc e in the mythol ogy which sets forth the natural facts according to the seasons in Egypt ; and onc e in the eschatology which figur ed the same facts typi cally in relation to the harvest in the aft er - life. Amsu, we cons ider, was the original of Boöt es. On the celestial globe , high ove r Spica, Boöt es rises with the sickle in his right hand as a sym bol of the hus bandm an. Amsu issues from the tom b as the divine harvester, with the flail in his right ha nd. He is also the good herdsman, as is show n by the crook , whether as goa therd or shephe rd, and this character of the hus bandm an as gua rdian is repeated by Boöt es in the character of Bearward. Som e Egypt ologi sts have conj ectured that the wars of Horus in the Astronom ical mythol ogy were historical in Egypt . But this is to follow the will - o’ - the - wisp of a popul ar delusion. The mass of primitive “history” in many lands has been derived from nur sery legends and as folk - tale versions of the Egypt ian wisdom . Th e lords of light and life that ove rcame the pow ers of droug ht and darkne ss were conve rted into"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"ethni cal persona ges and glorified as natural heroes. We are told by Diodo rus of Sicily that the Egyp tians looke d upon the Greeks as impostors who reissued the an cient mythol ogy as their ow n history; in this they were not alone . But the wars of Horus were fought in heaven and Amenta against the Sebau, the Dragon, the Serpent, with Orion for one of his great stellar figur es. If there is any one figur e cons tellated i n heaven as the hero par excellence, in various characters, it is pre - eminently that of Orion. This, as Egypt ian, is Horus or Heru. The word Heru signi fies the chief; the one who is the ove r - lord, the ruler, the might y one , the hero. This hero as Horus of the inunda tion was pre - solar. He was the annua l bringe r of food and drink before there was a sun - god, when the stars were the annunc iators of the com ing times and seasons to the waiting, watching world. Then the character was made solar, and lastly eschato logi cal. Horus the might y conque ror, the Nimrod, the slayer of the gigantic Apap, is 316 the giant - killer of all later lore, not onl y as the solar god but also as the earlier elemental pow er, and the various legends are the reliqua ry remains of his sever al characters. They have to go a long way round to work who would unde rstand the scientific groupi ng of the stars according to the principles of astro - mythol ogy . For instance, Orion as the hunt er and Lupus the hare are two sout hern cons tellations . But Ori on doe s not mean that a scriptural character was taken out of the Bible and cons tellated as a typi cal spor tsman, and the might y hunt er of a miserable hare. It is an almost uni versal representation that the sun or solar god pursues the moon for ever daily a nd night ly in a never - ceasing chase. This is how the story was conf igur ated by the mystery teachers of the heavens in the groupi ng of the stars. Such a chase implies the character of the hunt er, and Orion, as representative of the solar Horus, is the hunt e r. The pur suit of the moon is signi fied by the stellar sym bol of the hare. In sign - langua ge, and in many lands , the hare has been a luna r zoot ype as the wide - eyed leaper that was follow ed night by night , day after day, by the solar hunt er in his perpetual round. Thus the hare, know n as a sym bol of the moon ove r half the world, is show n to have been a totemic type of the nom e, and a figure of the luna r deity in Egypt. The hare was imaged as a primitive cons tellation at the feet of Orion, who in one character was the might y hunt er. But he is not the hunt er of so insigni ficant an animal as the hare. Neither was Orion the hunt er only a figur e of the sun pur suing the moon, or the hare. He was the mythical hunt er in other characters. In the stellar mythos he was t he hunt er of the pow ers of darkne ss with the dogs of Horus, Kyon and Prokyon . On com ing forth from the darkne ss of Amenta in the resurrection, the Osiris says: “I com e forth as a Bennu (a type of Sothis) at dawn.” “I urge on the hounds of Horus” (Rit., ch. 13) . He was the hunt er of the pow ers of darkne ss on behalf of Horus in the solar mythos , and likewise in the pha se of eschatology as Sahu - Orion, or Orion as the Sahu, that is Horus in his glorious body. We may look on Horus, the original of Herakles, as t he earliest child that ever strangl ed serpents. He is portrayed in this character as the child standi ng upon two crocodi les and crushing the serpents with bot h hands . "},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":" Horus strangling Serpents. In later legends told of Herakles the Greeks have adde d t he cradle as a further illustration of the children’s story. But, ages earlier, before the figur es were hum anized, Horus pierced the serpent of evil when he was represented in the form of a hawk fight ing with a serpent on the back of a hippopo tamus at Herm opo lis (Plutarch, I. and O., p. 50) . He also fought the 317 serpent as an ichne um on or mongoos e, and as a cat, each of which preceded the anthropom orphi c type of an infant in the cradle. The wars of Apap and Horus, or Ra, also of Sut and Osiris in the es chatology, were thus dramatically rende red in the astronom ical mythol ogy. The grappl e first began with Horus and the reptile Apap. This is repeated by Horus the little hero crushing the serpent in the constellation of “Ophi uchus ,” that is by Horus in the c haracter of conque ror who triumphe d ove r drought , darkne ss, decay, and finally of death. In a scene copi ed by Maspero from the zodi ac of Dende rah, Horus, on his papyr us, rises from the waters, and is preceded by Orion in his papyr us bark. Orion was a figur e of the stellar Horus, or Horus of the inunda tion. But Horus represented by the sparrow - hawk has becom e the solar god now born of Hathor the milch - cow . All three appe ar toge ther in this scene ( Daw n of Civilization, Eng. tr., p. 97). Now if we turn to the celestial globe we find Orion standi ng club in hand as the might y warrior with one foot on the waters of the river Eridanus =Horus of the inunda tion inve sted with the majesty and pow er of the solar god . In the Egypt ian drawing the two characters are distinc t, but in the Greek com pound these are blende d in the one hero know n as Herakles the slayer of serpents as an infant in his cradle. In very old Egypt ian traditions Sahu - Orion was represented as the wild hunt er who traversed the nether world by night and h unt ed there whilst it was day on earth. The pow ers of darkne ss, the Sebau and the Sami, were the obj ects of pur suit. They are hunt ed for food ; and the chase, the capture, killing, and cutting up of the carcases are"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"described in the terminol ogy of canni bals — so ancient is the legend of the wild hunt er, a form of whom may proba bly survive with us as Herne=Orion the hunt er. In the solar mythos the lord of light was Horus, or, later, Ra or Osiris, waging war upon the evil pow ers in the unde r - world, and hun ting t hem to death by night and devour ing them as the mode of destruction; the drama being represented in the stellar pha se with the figure of Orion as the lord of light made visible by night . The canni balism of the past becom es present in the langua ge of the in scriptions . Eating and drinki ng were the primary mode s of assimilating strengt h and sustenance. The idea still lives in partaking of the Eucharistic meal in which the god is suppos ed to be assimilated by the eating and drinki ng of the elements. It is said in the Book of the Dead (ch. 149) that the great spirits, the khus , or glorious one s, “live on the shades of the motionl ess.” They eat the soul s of the unde velope d dead; eating being appl ied to spirit as well as matter. It is proba ble that the giant as th e eater of the Shades, the as yet unqui ckened soul s of the bur ied dead, was figur ed in heaven as the ghoul . The star Beta in the group of Perseus, the hero with Medus a’s head, is called Al - Ghul, the ghoul , in the Arabic names of the stars (Higgi ns, The Nam es of the Stars and Cons tellations , p. 27) . In Amenta the ghoul was the eater of the Shades; and like many mythical characters is the denizen of anot her earth than our s. “O eater of the Manes,” says the Osiris, “I am not a thief.” (125. 17. ) This is one of thos e who prey upon the dead; one of the forty - two type s of terror which the gui lty had to face in the great judgm ent hall. Thus , the ghoul or 318 vampire of anot her earth that survives as eater of the dead in this world was also figured in the planisph ere as a type of terror to evildoe rs. Inde ed, Amenta is a museum full of such prototype s, and the ghoul secured a starry setting with the rest, though the figur e is not extant on our celestial globe . A striking instance of the use of the planisphe re in con veying the teaching of the mysteries may be seen in the Ritual. In som e recensions of the first chapter, when the Manes enters the Amenta, one of the first things he asks is to see the starry ship or floating ark of the hol y Sahus making its voya ge by nigh t in heaven. He exclaims, “Let me see the Sekhe t - Nut of the holy Sahus (the ship of heaven) traversing the sky. ” He was in the paths of darkne ss and desirous of seeing the noc turnal sky with its old familiar stars by which he sought to make out his way to the place of re - birth and the region of Maati upon the moun t of glory, from this valley of the shadow of death. The cons tellation of Horus as Orion was the ship of the Sahu, and ark of salvation conf igur ated in the celestial waters as a boa t that saved the soul ’s from an eternal shipw reck. This was the sign of spiritual resurrection for the com pleted Manes. In anot her text the speaker prays that his soul may shine as a Sahu in the stars of Orion or Horus. It is said of Horus in the “hym n to Osiris” the whol e earth glorifies him, when his hol iness proceeds (on the vault of the sky) “he is a Sahu illustrious amongs t the Sahus ,” that is among the spirits glorified. The Sahu is a glorified form in which the soul of the deceased is re - incorpor ated for the life he reafter; this was represented by Orion the conque ror of death and darkne ss in the pha se of eschatology. Now one freque ntly finds that this seconda ry stage had been attained by the Egypt ian mythos before it went out of Egypt into other lands as the lesser a nd the greater mysteries. For instance, there is a cons tellation called the Sah or Sahu in the Babyl oni an astronom y. This is identical by"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"name with the Egypt ian Orion, that is Horus in his resurrection as the Sahu or glorified likeness of the risen god or soul ; the Sahu in the planisphe re who represents the Manes rising from Amenta to the enclosure on the sum mit which was paradise above . The descent of Herakles into Hades to grappl e with the triple - headed Kerberus was preceded by the descent of Horus into Amenta, where the devour er is triple - bodi ed if not three - headed. The speaker in this character (Rit., ch. 136 B ) says, “Grant that I may com e and bring (to Osiris) the two jaws of Rusta,” the outrance from Amenta. Herakles in the lion’ s skin is identical wi th Horus in the lion - sign, and his fight with the Lernean hydr a of the Hesperides and the great wild boa r is a repetition of the battles that were fought by Horus with the Apap hydr a and the black boa r Sut. The same speaker at the same time says, “I have r epul sed the Apap reptile and healed the wounds he made,” which is equi valent to the struggl e of Horus with the mons ter hydr a. The twelve legends of the solar hero Gilgames of cour se, com paratively late, as they are based upon the zodi ac of twelve signs whi ch belongs to the final formation of the heaven that was preceded by the heaven in ten divisions , and earlier still by the heptanom is in seven. But the twelve labour s of Herakles are zodi acal, and the first of these was at a poi nt of com mencement in the li on - 319 sign. The Greeks with their accustom ed indi fference to the facts, and their fondne ss for figur es and fancies, played many pranks with the astronom ical mythol ogy. It was fabled by them that “an enor mous crab came to the assistance of Hydr a and bit the foot of Herakles” when he was doi ng battle with the dragon of drought ( Apol lodor us 2, v. 2). By re - translating Greek fable into astronom ical fact, this statement can be read, onl y the Greeks have placed the crab on the side of the evil pow er, which it was not , any more than the beetle. The retouc hing by the Greeks, like that of the Semites, tende d to efface the figur es or falsify the meaning of the mythos ; and the astronom ical facts are of a thous andf old more importance than all the pretty embellishm en ts of irrespons ible fancy. The forms and pictures figur ed in the planisphe re are not merely mythical, they are also celestial illustrations for the eschatology of the Egypt ian Ritual and the oldest religion in the world. Perhaps the worst perversion of the true mythos made by the Greeks was in their treatment of the pol ar dragon. This, as already show n, was founde d on the crocodi le, not on the Apap reptile. The crocodi le was the goo d dragon, the solar dragon, the dragon of life, represented by the stellar D raconi s. Apap is the dragon of evil, of negation, and of death. It is not easy to unc oil the dragon, or rather the two dragons , the dragon of light and the reptile of darkne ss, on Greek ground. The evil dragon was imaged onc e for all below the ecliptic in the cons tellation Hydr a. But it was the good dragon, not hydr a, that coiled by night about the pole of heaven to protect the gol den fruitage on the tree of life, the Chinese peach - tree of the pol e. So far from Herakles being called upon to make war upon th e good dragon, or crocodi le, it was a starry image of Horus (Sebek) himself, who is the prototype of Herakles. Naturally there must have been som e mutilation and disfigur ement on the palimpsest of the starry heavens, but this has not effaced the African i magery of the celestial signs , which prove s the ground - plan of the structure to have been Egypt ian. The present pur pos e is to trace the raison d’être and meaning of the cons tellation - figur es as"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"type s of characters that were pre - existent in the mythol ogy of Egypt . For, as herein maintained, it was Egypt that peopl ed the planisphe re and for ever occupi es the celestial globe . The heavens are telling night ly of her glory and her workm anship on high, which is more marvellous even than any that she left upo n the surface of the earth. The vast revol ving sphe re unf olds a panor ama of her season s, her godde sses and gods for ever circling round about a wonde ring world that sees but cannot read the primitive uranogr aphi c signs .  320 THE SIGN - LANGUAGE OF ASTRO NOMICAL MYTHOLOGY (P ART II) B OOK VI T HE ancient Apt, the first great mother who was the bringe r - forth in Apta, as the wom b of life, was elevated to the planisphe re as bringe r - forth in heaven. She was cons tellated in the Hippopot amus or Greater Bear, and called “the mother of the fields of heaven”; “the mother of beginni ngs ”; “the mother of move ment in a circle”; “the mother of the starry revol utions ,” or the cycles of time. As such, Apt was the bui lder of a heaven that was founde d on the seven pillars of the Heptanom is. Now the most primitive Egypt ian type of bui lding is a figur e of turning round, as might be in making pot tery. The coni cal pillar, pile, or mound of earth was also a type of this turning round. Thus the Heptanom is was bui lt on seven pillars , and the mother of the revol utions was the founde r of the Heptanom is. How this was bui lt has yet to be expl ained according to “The Mystery of the Seven Stars.” The Heptanom is of the old Great Mother and her seven sons was follow ed by the Octona ry of Am - Kh emen, the park or paradise of the eight great gods . This, as we reckon, is the circum pol ar enclosure which was founde d when Anup, the pow er of Polaris North, was adde d to the primordial rulers, or Nom archs, and whos e animal - type , the jackal, remained as gu ide star in the Lesser Bear (planisphe re of Dende rah, plate in Book of Beginni ngs ). The Octonary was one of the “upl iftings of Shu” which are allude d to in the Ritual. The heaven, that is also called the mansion of his stars, which was again and again rene wed (ch. 110 ). Shu had been one of the sustaining pow ers of the firmament who were know n as the seven giants. He then became the elevator of the heaven that was imaged as the cow of Nut; and lastly his was the sustaining pow er with Atum - Horus in the doub le equi nox. Appa rently this change from the Heptanom is of"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"the ancient mother and her seven sons to the heaven of the eight great gods upr aised by Shu is indi cated in the Magic Papyr us. In this the giant of seven cubi ts is addr essed. A divine com mand is given to him: “Get made for me a shrine of eight cubi ts! And as thou hast been (or wast) a giant of seven cubi ts, I have said to thee, thou canst not enter this shrine of eight cubi ts. And, as (or although ) thou wast a giant of seven cubi ts, thou hast entered a nd repos ed in it.” The “giant of seven cubits” in the shrine of seven cubi ts now gives place to one who “has the face 321 of a Kafi ape, with the head of hair of a monke y Aani.” The type , that is, of the moon - god, Tehut i - Aani, in the shrine of eight cubi ts, or the heaven of the eight great gods in the enclosure of Am - Khemen, the Octona ry of Taht, upraised by Shu (Magic Papyr us, Records of the Past, vol . X, pp. 151 - 154 ). Aani, the Kafi ape, was Taht’s ow n especial monke y of the moon, and is a sign that the shrine of eight cubi ts was the octagona l heaven or Octona ry of Taht, the luna r god which tends to identify this with the enclosure of Am - Khemen that was upr aised by Shu. In all likelihood the giant thus addr essed is Shu, the lion of the upl ifting force. It is related in very old Egypt ian legends that when Shu - Anhur lifted up the paradise or park of Am - Khemen he was com pelled to make use of a mound or staircase with steps to it in order that he might reach the height . This mound, says Maspero, was famous t hroughout all Egypt . The event (as suppos ed history) took place at Hermopol is, the city of which Taht was lord; therefore we may look to the luna r deity for the origin of the step - mound. A figur e of this mound may be seen in vigne ttes to the Ritual as a py ramid with seven steps called the ladder or staircase of Shu. How then did the steps or stairs of the mound originate as a luna r type of the ascent? And why shoul d the steps be seven in num ber? The answer is because they were luna r. The moon fulfilled its four qua rters in twenty - eight steps; fourteen up and four teen dow n. For this reason, Osiris in the moon was represented by an eye at the top of four teen steps. The moon in its first qua rter took seven steps upw ard from the und erworld to the sum mit, which i n the annua l reckoni ng was the equi noc tial mount . In other words Shu now made use of a luna r reckoni ng previous ly established by the moon - god Taht, when the ark of seven cubi ts was supe rseded by Am - Khemen. There are two sets of names in the Ritual given to the seven primordial pow ers in two of their astronom ical characters. The first seven are called (1) An - ar - ef the great. (2) Kat - Kat. (3) The Bull who liveth in his fire. (4) The Red - eyed One in the Hous e of Gauze. (5) Fiery face which turneth backw ards. ( 6) Dark face in its hou r, and (7) Seer in the night . The second seven are (1) Amsta. (2) Hapi. (3) Tuamutef. (4) Kabhs enuf . (5) Maa - tef - f. (6) Karbek - f. (7) Har - Khent - an - maa - ti. The first four of the latter seven are the gods of the four qua rters, who stan d on the papyrus of earth and who became the children of Horus in a later creation. In this new heaven raised by Shu anot her god was bor n as eight h one to the seven. This was Anup (a form of Sut), as a deity of the nor th celestial pol e. The Egypt ian eight great gods cons ist of 7+ 1. The Phœ nician Kabiri were 7+ 1. The Japanese Kami are 7+ 1. In the Vâyu - Purana the group of Rishis, who are usually reckone d as seven, are spoke n of as eight in number, and are therefore anot her group of the 7+ 1. The com pany of ei ght British gods were seven with Arthur as the eight h. The seven pow ers"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"plus one are also to be seen in the seven sleepers of Ephe sus and their dog. Moreove r, the dog can be identified with Anup as the gol den dog or jackal at the pol e. When the god of the pol estar was appoi nted in the nor th it was as an eight h to the seven, and he who was the eight h became the 322 supr eme one , the head ove r all, like the occiput at the top of the seven vertebral joints in the back - bone of Anup, Ptah or Osiris (which was a figur e of the pol e). The head or headland in Egypt ian is Ap (or Tep), and the same word signi fies the chief, the first, and also the num ber eight or the eight h. Anup was distingui shed from the seven earth - bor n pow ers. He is expr essly called “the son of th e cow .” That is the son of Nut the cow of heaven; the heaven that was lifted up by Shu in the shape of the cow which brought forth Anup at the pol e. Ap - ta - Urt, the cow of earth, had been the mother of the seven, who were reproduc ed by Nut as the Khut i or g lorious ones who are eight with Anup adde d as the pow er of Polaris. Anup the highe st pow er at the pol e, then becom es arrange r of the stars in this new heaven of the eight great gods , that was upr aised by Shu the giant, who had been one of the primary seven pow ers. Anup, the eight h, is said to fix the places of the seven glorious one s, who follow after the coffin of Osiris, on the day of “Com e thou hither”; which was the first day of som e new creation in the Astronom ical Mythol ogy. (Rit., ch. 17. ) In the sol ar mythos the sun - god took the place of Sut - Anup , who was the earlier maintainer of the equi poi se and equi librium in the revol ving system of the heavens. The speaker in the Ritual (ch. 54) says, “I am the god who keepeth oppos ition in equi poi se, as the egg which circles round. ” The egg is the sun. But he cont inue s: “For me there dawneth the mom ent of the most might y one Sut” (or Sut - Anup ), who was the most might y one as prevailer on the side of order at the pol e before the equi librium of forces was know n to depend upon the pow er of gravitation and the revol ution of the sun. What the sun is at the centre of the solar system, the pol e - star had been at the centre of the stellar uni verse in the most ancient astronom y. In place of gravitation the force that swung the system round was represented by a cord or chain attached to the pol e as its sym bol of cont rolling pow er. This eight h one adde d to the seven primary pow ers came at times to be designa ted father of the seven. Thus the eight h was raised to the headship o ver the seven Japanese Kami. Anup, as representative of the pol ar star, is lord ove r the seven Akhe mu or non - setting stars. The Phœ nician Sydi k is father to the seven Kabiri, and he is the just, the right eous one . Which means that he also was a representat ive of the pol e, identical with Anup, who is the judge . The character is the same in relation to the seven earlier pow ers now called the sons , as the just one , or the judge . “King of the seven sons of earth” is a title of Anu. Reference is also made to the king of the seven Lu - Masi. (Maspero, Daw n of Civilisation, p. 631, not e 1, Eng. tr.) This was the god who, as eight h to the seven and the highe st of all, was the chief, the Suten or King, that is, Sut - Anup, chief to the Kamite seven in the circum pol ar hea ven of the eight great gods . The Assyrian seven are likewise designa ted the sons of Bel as the seven Anunna ki or earthly Anuna s. Anup the jackal - headed was the primordial judge , but so anciently that he had been supe rseded by Atum and Osiris in that charac ter. The pictures to the Ritual show him in the judgm ent - hall reduc ed to the pos ition of inspector of weight s and measures in the"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"presence of Osiris, who has now becom e the great judge in Amenta. But allusions to the earlier status still remain. As 323 i t is said in the inscription of Khnum hetep “all the festivals on earth terminate on the hill” or ove r the hill of Anup. That is in the eternal feast upon Mount Hetep, the mount of glory in the pol ar paradise. (Inscription, line 96, Records, v. 12, p. 71. ) In the Rig - Veda (X.82. 2) the habitation of the one god is placed in the highe st nor th “beyond the seven Rishis.” These are often suppos ed to be represented by the seven stars in the Great Bear, but errone ous ly so. The seven Rishis, Urshi or divine watchers were groupe d in the Lesser Bear, the stars of which cons tellation never set. These were the chief of the Akhe mu unde r Anup, god of the pol e - star. The Subba s or Mandoz o, the “Ancients” of Mesopot amia, are what is called worshippe rs of the pol e - star. To thi s they turn their faces in prayer, and in goi ng to sleep. The reason assign ed is that when Hivel Zivo the Subba n creator assum ed the gove rnm ent of the worlds which he had formed, he placed himself at the limits of the seven Matarathos , at the extreme poi nt of the uni verse where the pol e - star was then created to cove r him. (Siouf fi, La Relig. des Soubbas , Paris: 1880 .) The original old man of the moun tain was unque stiona bly the ancient deity of the pol e - star. Hence the group of seven stars which accom pany th e head of the “Old Man” on the Gnos tic stone s show ing that he was the head ove r the seven glorious one s. (King, Gnos tic Remains. ) The old man of the moun tain then, is Anup, who arrange d the stations of the seven on the day of “Com e thou to me” (Rit., ch. 1 7). It is just pos sible that we may now discove r the origin of the mystical eight - rayed star in the num erical sym bol of the eight great gods , who cons isted of the seven, with Anup, on his mount ain, as the eight h and highe st in the stellar mythos . In this w ay: there is a Gnos tic gem of loadstone figur ed in King’ s Book on which Anup is por trayed like Horus hol ding two mons trous scorpions in his hands . He is accom panied by the sun, as a winged scarab, the crescent moon and a star with eight rays. (Second ed., pl. 9.) This emblem was given to the solar god in Egypt , Assyria, Indi a and in Rom e, but here it is assigne d to Anup the supr eme one of the eight great gods , and the first who was the eight h to the seven in the Octona ry of Taht or the ark of eight measures that was lifted up by Shu in the paradise of Am - Khemen. As the pictures show , the zodi ac was founde d on the inunda tion. The mother of water figur ed in the sout hern fish, as the wom b of sour ce itself, was afterwards repeated on the ecliptic, as the watere ss (later Aquarius) with all her myriad mammæ streaming from the foun t of liqui d life, in the abys s, the Tepht , or Tuat, that was localized in the recesses of the sout h from whence the inund ation came, and from which it was perenni ally renewed. When the zo diac was established, she who had been the mother of water in the sout h woul d naturally be given a foremost place. The waterer was now repeated as the multimammalian wet - nur se in the sign of Aqua rius; the same in character, whether as the sout hern fish, th e water - cow , or the suckler divinized. How ever represented, earth as the giver of water was the type, and in Egypt the water was the inunda tion. The first two children of the great mother came into existence as the twin brothers, who cont ende d with each ot her in the oppos ite elements of 324"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" drought and water, or darkne ss and light , and in other phe nom ena. These twin pow ers were cons tellated in the sign of the Twins at the station where the two com batants were first reconc iled, that was at the equi noc tial level. These then, we reckon, were amongs t the earliest founde rs of the zodi ac on som e old com mon meeting - ground of night and day, or drought and inunda tion which is yet visible for us in the sign of the Gemini. Moreove r it is related in the ancient legend s and folk - tales that onc e upon a time there was a pair of brothers who were twins, and these twin brethren were the bui lders of a city. A typi cal illustration may be cited in Rom ulus and Remus as the mythical twins who are the reput ed founde rs of the city of Rom e. In Egypt the brother bui lders are the Sut and Horus twins. The city which they bui lt was in the heavens, not on earth, and this, the Gemini remained to show , was in the circle of the ecliptic. Thus Sut and Horus, follow ing the great mother, are a lso founde rs of the zodi ac. The first pair of twins were male. These were follow ed by a pair in Shu and Tefnut , that were male and female, called the brother and sister. These were twinne d, back to back, Shu in front , Tefnut behind, to form the figur e of S agittarius on the other side of the zodi ac exactly oppos ite the Gemini (obl ong zodi ac of Dende rah). We reckon Shu, the lion of breathing force and upl ifter of the firmament, to be third of the elemental pow ers bor n of the ancient Genetrix. Shu upraised th e heaven of day in one character and the heaven of night in the other. He is a pillar of suppor t to the firmament as founde r of the doubl e equi nox . He sustains the heaven with his two - pronge d stick, his two arms, or with the two lions of force which repres ent himself and his sister Tefnut the lione ss. It was at the equi noc tial level that the qua rrel of Sut and Horus was settled for the time being by Shu. Shu thus stands for the equi nox as the link of conne ction betwixt Sut and Horus in the nor th and sout h. The heaven in two parts, sout h and nor th, as the dom ains of Sut and Horus was now follow ed by the heaven in three divisions that was upr aised by Shu as establisher of the equi nox in the more nor thern latitude s. And this heaven in three divisions was the he aven of the Triangl e which preceded the one bui lt on the squa re, by Ptah. Horus and Sut had been the twin bui lders and the founde rs sout h and north. Shu follow ed with the new founda tion in the equi nox, which was doubl e, east and west. Sut, Horus, and Shu t hen, aided by his sister Tefnut , founde d the heaven of the triangl e based upon the twofold hor izon and the crossing. Shu as the equi noc tial pow er is the third to Sut and Horus of the sout h and nor th. With him a triad was com pleted and the two pillars with a line across woul d form the figur e of the triangl e ∇ . Thus , the twins in Gemini and Shu in Sagittarius, being the three first of the seven pow ers, poi nt at least to the equi noc tial line being laid in thos e two signs of the z odi ac. More particularly as his sister Tefnut , a form of the great mother, is joined with Shu in cons tituting the sign of Sagittarius. Thus the three brothers, Sut, Horus and Shu with one female (as the mother or sister) are found toge ther in these two fun damental signs of the zodi ac. A third pow er born of the 325 great mother in heaven was now adde d to the other two. Anot her of her seven sons was bor n, or the lion of force (Shu) joined the crocodi le (Sebek - Horus) and the hippopot amus Sut, in a trinity of pow ers that sustained the firmament."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":" As elemental forces Sut and Horus had been ever lawless com batants and claimants, always fight ing for supr emacy. When Shu had lifted up the heaven of Am - Khemen as the paradise of peace upon Mount Hetep, “he reconc iled the two warrior gods with each other” and “with thos e who had charge of the beautiful creation which he raiseth up. ” Law and order were established by put ting “bounds to the cont entions of the pow ers” and by dividing the whol e uni verse from Zenith to Nadi r into the two dom ains called the por tion of Sut and the por tion of Horus. The cont ention betwixt Sut and Horus had originated ages before the satanic character of the Evil One in his anthropom orphi c gui se had been assigne d to Sut. The twin oppone nts had b een on a foot ing of equa lity in the stellar, luna r, and solar mythos . But there always was a que stion of bounda ries to be settled. Shu is the arbitrator in the stellar pha se. (Rit., ch. 110. ) In the luna r stage Taht the moon god was the judge and reconc ile r of the warring twins. And in the solar mythos Seb, the god of earth, adjudi cates — as show n in the mythol ogi cal text from Memphi s ( Proceedings Soc iety of Bib. Archy., v. 23, parts 4 and 5). When Ptah had bui lt his mansion in the doubl e earth the two hor izo ns were uni ted, or, as it is said, the doubl e earth became uni ted, “the uni on is in the hous e of Ptah,” and “ the two pillars of the gat eway in the hous e of Ptah are Horus and Sut . The uni ted one s made peace; they fraternized com pletely. They made a treaty. ” Seb says to Horus and Sut, “there shall be an arbitration between you. ” Seb said to Horus, “com e from the place where thy father was subm erged,” that is in the nor th. Seb said to Sut, “com e from the place where thou wast bor n,” that was in the sout h. “A mount ain in the midst of the earth uni tes the por tion of Horus to the portion of Sut, at the division of the earth.” This, in the solar mythos , was the mount of the equi nox . Now Horus and Sut each stood upon a hillock; they made peace saying “the two earth s meet in Annu for it is the march (bor der) of the two earths.” In this legend there is a shifting of bounda ries from sout h and nor th to east and west in the uni on that is now cont racted in the hous e of Ptah, “in the hous e of his two earths in which is the bounda ry of sout h and nor th” that was drawn from east to west by the equi noc tial line. “Here the uni ted one s fraternized com pletely. They made a treaty”; which was sustained by Seb. And henceforth the twin pow ers, Sut and Horus, now called Horus and Sut, who had stood as the two pillars, sout h and nor th, for the two pol es in Apta, are now “the two pillars of the gateway to the hous e of Ptah”; which two pillars are afterwards por trayed as the doubl e Tat of eternal stability in the making of Amenta ( Text fro m Memphi s ). In this pha se the qua rrel of Sut and Horus represents the difference betwixt darkne ss and light in the lengt h of night and day which went on round the year and was rectified at the poi nt or on the Mount of Equi nox. Before the solar god attaine d his supr emacy as the 326 determiner of time Shu was the readjuster of the pow er of the equi nox. Hence Shu is said to have kept the cont ention of these warring pow ers within bounds and brought about their reconc ilement (Rit., ch. 110) . Thus the “reckoni ngs of Shu” invol ved the readjustment of the equi noc tial poi nt and re - establishing the equi librium of the equi noxe s in the different reckoni ngs of time. Taht the luna r time - keeper doe s the same thing when he “balances the divine pair,” and put s a stop to t heir strife in the circuit of precession"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"(Rit., ch. 123) . All the year round, except at this point of place, it was one scale up and the other dow n in the cont ention of Sut and Horus for the mastery. But at the vernal equi nox the scales were at the perfect level and the twins were exactly equa l in pow er for the time, with Horus the fulfiller about to rise in the ascenda nt. Horus was the bringe r of the gol den age to earth. This in Egyp t was the time of the inunda tion; in other lands and later days it is the spring - time of the year. The Saturnalia was a mode of celebrating this equa lity at the time of the equi noc tial level, by means of various kinds of levelling custom s. Slaves were equa l with their masters and mistresses. Wom en were equa l to men, the sexes ch ange d clothing with each other, on the natural ground of equa lity. This Saturnalia survived as a relic of the Golden Age called Saturnian by the Greeks and Rom ans. In Egypt Sut and Horus change d pos itions and were figur ed as Har - Suti, with the hawk of Hor us in front and the black Neh or Typhoni an animal of Sut behind. This reversal represented the change of seasons in relation to the nor th and sout h. In Equa toria the desert and the drought were given to the sout h, which was the dom ain of Sut. Refreshing ra in and cool ing breezes came from the dom ain of Horus in the life - giving nor th. In Egypt the water and the food of life were brought by Horus of the inunda tion from the sout h. Whereas the nor th in winter was the realm of darkne ss and of drought , and therefo re the dom ain of Sut became that of the evil elemental pow er of the twins. The three pow ers of earth, water, and breath, or Sut, Horus, and Shu, were given stations in the zodi ac; the twins, Sut and Horus, in the sign of Gemini, and Shu, as the Archer, in the sign of Sagittarius. The heaven foun ded on the sout h and nor th by Sut and Horus, the Twin Builders, was now follow ed by the heaven that Shu upl ifted in the equi nox as the lion of sustaining pow er, or rather as the dua l lion of Shu and Tefnut , his siste r, who is seen to be conj oined with him in Sagittarius. Thus far the zodi ac was founde d on the Great Mother with two pairs of twins; Sut and Horus as the Rehiu lions , with Shu and Tefnut as the Ruti or lions of the dou ble hor izon, one at each end of the eq uinoc tial line or level where the lost balance of the cont endi ng Twins was periodi cally restored by the reconc iler Shu. In one character Horus is designa ted “Horus of the Triangl e,” and a theory has been put forward in Germany to the effect that the figur e represents the pillar or cone of the zodi acal light. But the une xpl ained peculiarity of Horus of the Triangl e is that his triangl e is figured in a reversed pos ition with the apex dow nw ards and the base above , ∇ . Whereas the pillar of zodi acal light was never seen 327 bot tom - upw ards in that way, and never coul d have been so represented. On the other hand, the triangl e which was cons tellated in “Triangul a,” is, we hol d, the figur e of a tripar tite division of the ecliptic, an d the triple seasons of the Egyptian year. The water - season being represented by Horus; the season of wind, or breathing life, and of the equi noc tial gales by Shu; and the season of dryne ss, or drought , by Sut. These were called the water season, the green season, and the dry season. The three signs of which are (1) “water,” (2) “grow ing plants,” and (3) a barn or storehous e, which show ed the crops were harvested. Four mont hs for the water season gives the correct lengt h of the inunda tion. The Egyp tian harv est occurred in the eight h mont h of the year. Then"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"follow ed a season of drought and dearth, which came to be assigne d to the destroye r Sut. These three seasons can be traced as a basis for the zodi ac that was afterwards extende d to one of four qua rters and twelve signs . Horus of the inunda tion was given the Lion as a solar zoot ype . The Archer, four signs further round , was assigne d to Shu, the god of breathing force, and four signs are the correct measure of one season, or a tetramene. The Lion and Archer, or Horus and Shu, represent the two seasons of the inunda tion and of breathing life. The name of the Archer in the Hermean Zodi ac is Nepht e, and Neft signi fies the soul or breath. Sut was cont inue d in conf lict with Horus in the cons tellation of the Twins, the pow er of drough t that was oppos ed to the water of life. Shu was the reconc iler of these two cont inua lly warring pow ers, and in the zodi ac he represents the green season of water and of drought . This was funda mental, the rest is filling in. The three se asons of four months each woul d naturally lead to the circle of the ecliptic being measured and divided into three parts, which tripartite division was follow ed, at a distance, by the Babyl oni ans in their mappi ng out of the sphe re, and cont inue d by them in a far later calenda r of twelve signs . The Egypt ian mont h was divided into three weeks of ten days each, which obvi ous ly corresponde d to the heaven of the triangl e, the tripartite ecliptic, and the three seasons in Egypt . Then followed a heaven of four qua rters or sides, in which may be traced the hous es of Sut, Horus, Shu and Taht; but the division of the mont h or moon and the ecliptic in three parts equa ted with the three seasons in a circle or zodi ac that was measured mont hly by the luna r god with his 3 × 10= 30 days. The two roads of heaven had been divided between the twin brothers Sut and Horus. The three roads were next divided between Sut, Horus, and Shu in the heaven of the triangl e that stood as it were upon a tripod, = three roads of the sout h, nor th, and equi nox . Type after type , the mythical Great Mother and her children passed into the legenda ry lore of the whol e world. The mother and her twins were follow ed by the mother in the character of sister, who is the com pan ion of three brothers, our Sut, Horus, and Shu in the triangul ar heaven or triple division, the uranogr aphi c sym bol of which was cons tellated in “Triangul a,” com pos ed of three stars held in the hand of Horus (Drum mond, Œd. Jud. , pl. 3). Three brothers with one female, then, as an Egypt ian group, are representatives of the 328 Great Mother and her first three sons or elemental pow ers; the pow ers represented in her por trait by the water - cow , the crocodi le, and lione ss. The mother being indi cated by the preg nant wom b. The same group is also Japanese, cons isting of the three (out of seven, or the eight ) Kami, with their sister Izanami. The three Kami, called the “All - alone - born Kami,” our stellar Trinity, were gods of the beginning, and are conne cted with the sister in the raising up of heaven (Satow , Pure Shi nto, p. 67; Chamberlain, Kojiki, p. 19). And when the Christian divinity of a triune nature is portrayed with a triangul ar aureole upon his head, that figur e relates the deity onc e more to the phe nom ena in which a god of the Triangl e had originated. The god of the Triangl e was of a threefold nature in the trinity of Sut, Horus, and Shu, which three were one with the mother in the heaven of the Triangl e, the mount with the triple peaks, the ecliptic in three divisions , the year in the three season s, the mont h in three weeks. The Triangl e, like the Oval, is a figure of the female, as it was on the Godde ss Nana in Babyl oni a. The trinity of three males associated with"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"one female, who was originally the Great Mot her, survives in two ways still, for whilst they are performing in chur ch four more primitive representatives of the same dram atis personæ still keep it up in the pantom ime, as in the dum b show of the more ancient mysteries, in the characters of colum bine, clow n, harlequi n, and pantaloon. Harlequi n is Har (or Horus) the transformer. We might say the doubl e Horus, one with and one without the mask. The clow n is Sut, the sly and cunni ng one , whos e zoot ype was the jackal. Pantaloon and his crutch are the remai ns of Shu and his celestial prop of the pol e. Colum bine corresponds to Tefnut, the sister of Shu, which expl ains her peculiar relations hip to Pantaloon , whom she rejects in favour of Harlequi n. Now these four appe ar upon Mount Hetep when the later heaven i s por trayed in the ten divisions that preceded the final twelve as a trinity of primeval pow ers uni ted with the Great Mother, who was the abode as Triangl e when the heaven was not yet bui lded on the squa re (Rit., ch. 110) . The other four brothers who make up the group of seven great gods (at least in one form) are Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef, and Kabhs enuf , who stand on the lotus or papyr us, and are the four gods , paddl es or eyes of the four quarters. Thus , the seven are (1) Sebek - Horus, the crocodi le; (2) Sut, t he water - bul l; (3) Shu, the lion; (4) Hapi, the ape; (5) Tuamutef, the jackal; (6) Kabhs enuf , the hawk; (7) Amsta, the man, who, toge ther with the Great Mother, were the founde rs of the zodi ac — three in the Triangl e and four in the Squa re. Whatsoever the s even Khut i were as indi vidual stars, they were also conf igur ated as a group in Ursa Minor and called the follow ers of the coffin of Osiris, which was imaged in the Greater Bear. The seven in the stellar mythos had becom e the lords of rule, devoi d of wrong , and living for eternity. This was as spirits perfected unde r the type of stars that never set (Rit., ch. 72) . And here it may be expl ained that we have all been persistently wrong about the seven glorious one s, the seven Rishis, the seven Lu - Masi, the sev en Elohi m or the seven Kabiri, the “Seven Sleepers” being the seven stars in the Great Bear. For this reason, in all the starry vast there is but one group of seven non - set - 329 ting stars, and these are in the Lesser, not in the Greater Bear. Polaris wa s at one time chief of all the heavenly hos t, on account of its being fixed at the centre as a type of stability and upr ight ness. The characteristics and qualities assigne d to the divinity were first seen in the steadfastness of the pol e. The stars in Ursa Minor were circum pol ar. These show ed the seven in a group who never coul d be drow ned by the deluge of darkne ss. The waters did not reach them. Not so the seven in the Greater Bear, the seven that were not circum pol ar stars. About 5,000 years before the pr esent era there was but one , the star Dubhe in Ursa Major that was circum pol ar or non - setting (Lockye r, Daw n of Astronom y, p. 152 ). These, therefore, coul d not have been the seven never setting stars, who were the watchers and the rulers in the great year of the world; the starry type of the eternal pow ers. The typi cal seven were groupe d in the Lesser Bear as an obj ect picture of som ething out of sight , with Anup as El - Elyon at the pol e. In all the mythol ogies the Pole - star is an emblem of stability, a seat or throne of the pow er who is the highe st god pro tem., as was Anup in Egyp t, Sydi k in Phœ nicia, Anu in Babyl oni a, Tai - Yih (the arch - first) in China, Avather, or Zivo, in Mesopot amia, and others. It was not the seat that was"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"worshippe d, but the pow er; the sustainer and the judge that was enthrone d upon the stellar Mount of Glory as the god. The Pole - star was a type of the eternal, because appa rently beyond the region of time and change . It was the earliest type of a supr eme intelligence which gave the law in heaven that was une rring, just and true; if onl y as the law of equi poi se or, as we shoul d now say, of gravitation. This was the sole poi nt at which there seemed to be any certainty of foot hol d in that movi ng ocean of the starry infinite. And this becam e a standpoi nt in the heavens for the mind of man to rest on at the centre and radiate to the circum ference. The sum mit was well - named the Mount of Glory. Around this island - mount the hos ts of heaven appe ared to wheel by night in one vast, glorious , never - ceasing “march past” in the presence of the “Roya l Arch” or, more religious ly regarded, the Most High God. The earliest law in heaven was given on the mount because the mount was an image of the pol e. It was adm inistered by the judg e, whether as Anup , in t he nor th, or Sut as jackal of the sout h, because the jackal in Egypt was a zoot ype of the judge . It is not the mount , then, that was the divinity, but the pow er that dw elt upon it, as the deity called by the Japanese “the God Eternal - Stand of the heavens” (Ame - no - Foko - Tachi Kami). The pow er of stability fixed as the centre of the uni verse was the typi cal eternal. This was represented by the jackal, which is to be seen at the centre of the Dende rah planisphe re. The jackal also is a type , not a divinity, and a type may be various ly appl ied. The jackal itself is “Ap - Uat,” the ope ner or gui de of roads; proba bly as the seer and crier in the dark and leader of the pack. But it was the dog of Sut and of Sothis as well as of Anup. Thus the type in Sign - langua ge may not always determine the nature of the deity. But, as Hor - Apol lo right ly says, the jackal denot es the judge (B. I, p. 39). The gove rnor at an early period was the judge , with the jackal as his sign. There were several kinds of judge s in Egypt , and the “tot em” of each is the sab or 330 sapient jackal. Hence the jackal, representative of Polaris, was placed above the seven as the judge of heaven because he had imaged the judge on earth. Naturally the type was not always repeated; other count ries, other faun a. Besides which, the anthropo morphi c succeeded the zoom orphi c in an inde finitely later time; and the Semitic, Hinda ic, Greek, and various other rende rings are mainly anthropo morphi c. But the judge quâ judge thus set in heaven by the Egypt ians at the pol ar centre, with his seat upon the sum mit unde rneath the tree, was repeated and cont inue d in other mythol ogi es upon the stellar mount . Anup became the great judge in heaven, and the seven are his ministers, as executione rs, upon the judg ment - day. They are ter med the seven “arms of the balance on the night when the eye is fixed”; that is the eye of the judge , who saw through the dark (Rit., ch. 71) . The Eye of Heaven that Judge s the Wicked is the name of a Chinese cons tellation; and the god Anup was the judge w hose eye was the Pole - star in the nor th. He was the seer in the dark, therefore the jackal was his zoot ype ; and the jackal was follow ed by the later dog as a sym bol of Polaris. The luna r mythos succeeded the stellar, but the moon - god Taht was not reckone d as the ninth one . Neither was Horus. The eight h was the highe st pow er till the time of Ptah and the Put - cycle of the nine. The group of seven remained intact. Anup, as the eight h, was highe st in the luna r mythos ; and Horus was the highe st in the solar"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"myt hos , the highe st being worshippe d as the “Only One.” Anup and Tehut i then became two witnesses to the supr emacy of Horus, the one as the eight h, who in turn became the witness for his father, Ra - Unne fer. The deity of the Pole - star was know n to the Chinese as the supr eme god in nature, who has his abode on the Great Peak of Perfect Harmony. When Dr. Edki ns asked a school master at Chapoo who was the lord of heaven and earth, the reply of the Chinaman was that he kne w of non e but Tien - hw ang Ta - ti, god of the P ole - star. ( Religion in China, p. 109 .) Shang - ti, the supr eme ruler, was the highe st obj ect of worship. His heavenly abode , Tsze - wei, is “a celestial space round the nor th pol e” (Legge , Chinese Classics, v. III, pt. 1., p. 34) and his throne was indi cated b y the pol ar star ( Chinese Repos itory, v. IV, p. 194) . This is the most sacred as well as most ancient form of Chinese worship. A round hillock is the altar on which sacrifice was offered to him. It is said in the archaic Chow Ritual (Li) that when the sove reign worshippe d Shang - ti he offered up on a round hillock a first - born male, as a whol e burnt sacrifice (Dougl as, Conf uciani sm and Taoui sm, pp. 82 - 87). Both the mount and the first - born male are typi cal. Sut was the first - bor n male, and, as Sut - Anup, he w as the first male ancestor. The hillock is an image of the mount . This deity was also know n to the Chinese as the “Divine Prince of the Great Northern Equi librium ,” who promulgated “the laws of the silent wheels of the heavens palace,” or the cycles of tim e determined by the revol utions of the stars (De Groot , Fêtes d’ Emoui , v. I, pp. 77, 80) . 331 One of the profounde st secrets in the Egypt ian astronom ical mythol ogy was the mystery of the twofold hor izon, or, more exactly, the mystery of the doubl e equi nox, and one of the earliest forms of the solar god in the zodi ac was Horus of the doubl e equi nox, when this had been established by the sky - upl ifter Shu, with the aid of his sister Tefnut . Until the time of Har - Makhu the fatherhood of god had not been in dividua lised in Ra. Har - Makhu was the mother’s child when she was a virgin, represented by the white vulture of Neith, or the sacred heifer of Isis. The child coul d be self - generated as the spirit of life in vegetation, or in light , the phe nom ena being pre - hum an from the first. Child - Horus in the solar mythos was the little autum n sun conc eived upon the western mount as the calf or child. Adul tship was attained upon the hor izon east with what was termed the doub le force. The cult was that of Hathor and Horu s, the mother and the child, who was the calf on one hor izon and the bul l of the cow upon the other. In these two characters he was the doubl e Horus, or the “doubl e Harmachis,” the solar god of bot h hor izons , and fulfiller annua lly in the doubl e equi nox . T he pow er of evol ution was por trayed in Kheper, the transformer. Kheper show ed the old beetle changi ng into the young; the tadpol e transfigur ing into the frog; the hum an embryo developi ng in utero; the endur ing spirit emanating from the mortal mum my. Kheper was a form of Har - Makhu, as we learn from the inscription of the Sphi nx. From Har - Makhu, the father - god , Ra - Har - Machis was develope d in the mythol ogy which preceded the Egypt ian eschatology. Atum was Ra in his primordial sove reignt y. The divine fatherhood was develope d from Har - Makhu, who became the great god Ra in his primordial sove reignt y. Har - Ur, the elder, first - bor n Horus in the mythos , was the child of the mother when she had no hus band, and he had no father; hence she was the virgin mother"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"who conc eived but did not bring forth. There was not hing hum an in the transaction except the terminol ogy . Horus in the eschatology was he who died and was bur ied, and who rose again in spirit at his second adve nt. This time he was imaged in the likeness of the fat her as the belove d onl y begot ten Son of God, who manifested as the fulfiller of his word and doe r of his will. Two type s in this way were depos ited and made permanent in Horus, the child of twelve years, and Amsu - Horus, the man of thirty years. Both charac ters were uni ted and made one as solar in Horus of the doubl e hor izon. This character of Horus, as Repa or Heir - Appa rent, may be traced historically at a later time as that assigne d to a Pharaoh of the 12t h dyna sty, who represents the doubl e Harmachis, the sun - god of the twofold hor izon. He claims a divine origin as the virgin’s child that was not begot ten by God the Father. As an infant “in the egg, ” he was exalted to be “the Lord of bot h parts,” or bot h hor izons , like Har - Sam - Taui. Speaking of the god he says “he anoi nted my forehead as Lord of men, creating me as chief of mortals. He placed me in the palace as a yout h not yet com e forth from my mother’s wom b.” He was bor n in the likeness of elder Horus to be king, or to becom e the roya l Horus in the horiz on of the vernal equi nox, where 332 the two parts were uni ted as east and west in the solar mythos , which follow ed the stellar Peseshti, or two halves, that were the sout h and north of Sut and Horus ( Records, v. 12, pp. 53, 54) . Without a funda mental kn ow ledge of the mythol ogy as framework it is impos sible to com prehend the doc trines of the Egyptian religion. Horus of the doubl e hor izon, or the doubl e equi nox, was the solar prototype of the doubl e Horus in the eschatology. As sun - god on the western hor iz on in the autum n equi nox Har - Makhu was bor n, conc eived or incorporated as the virgin’s child. It was at this point, that Horus entered earth or the matrix of the mother in the mount , and thus became the child of Seb and Isis by adopt ion, though not by bege ttal. In the eastern equi nox he rose again as Horus of the doubl e force and master of the doubl e feather, or the later doubl e crow n. When the sun set at night , or in the autum n season, it sank dow n into the waters of the abys s below the hor izon, which Horu s - Sebek swam as the fish. The crocodi le, then, expr essed the unpa ralleled pow er by which the sun - god crossed the waters and rose again. The crossing was from equi nox to equi nox, from the western to the eastern side of the mount , let us say from the sign of Virgo in the autum n to the sign of Pisces in the vernal equi nox. Neith, the suckler of crocodi les, was an earlier form of the Virgin Mother than Isis, and by her aid we may obt ain a foot hol d in the zodi ac, like that of Horus resting on the mystical two c rocodi les, which became the two fishes in the sign of Pisces. When the autum n equi nox occurred in Virgo that was the place of conc eption for Sebek, the fish of the inunda tion. Six mont hs later the sun rose in the sign of Pisces, and in the eastern equi nox, where the fish, as child and cons ort, or as the two crocodi les, became the two fishes with Neith as the mother on one hor izon and Sekhe t on the other. Thus as we read the signs , the virgin Neith conc eived her child as Sebek - Horus, the fish of the inunda ti on, which was dupl icated to expr ess the adul tship, and there were two typi cal fishes. A well - know n picture of Child - Horus show s the you thful sun - god standi ng on two crocodi les,"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"which we take to express the pow er of the doubl e, or, more exactly, the doubl ed Horus. In this representation Har - Ur is described as the old child who becom es young . That is the elder who transforms into the younge r Horus on the Mount of Glory in the vernal equi nox. Standi ng on the two crocodi les Har - Ur has now acqui red the doubl e po wer — the pow er, for example, to take up serpents and other poi sonous reptiles in his hands without receiving any hur t. 1 Thus , the crocodi le - headed Sebek as the child attribut ed to Neith in Virgo, crosses the gul f of darkne ss or the abys s of waters to rise u p in the east as Horus of the twofold horizon which he had uni ted in the dou ble equi nox as Horus of the doubl ed pow er. The doubl ed pow er of the sun or god in symbol ism was expr essed by dupl ication of the type . For example, it was in the autum n equi nox, or, as more primitively imaged, on the western mount – the mount of the cow which was cove red with crosses indi cating the equi nox (Wilkinson) – that Child - Horus was conceived in the mythol ogy or incarnated in the eschatology. In the first he was the little suffer ing sun of the crossing, or the cross, who went dow n into the unde rworld to die ________ 1 See fig. of Horus, p. 317. 333 and be bur ied; to transform and to rise again. In the zodi ac of Dende rah, the sign of the “Scales” cont ains a por trait of Har - pi - Kha rt, or Horus the child, who was conc eived or incorpor ated in that sign as Horus of the doubl e equinox called Har - Makhu. The name identifies Child - Horus with the sign. The word for the scales or balance in Egypt ian is Makhu. Further, the scales denot e the e qui nox, as the poi nt of equi poi se. The Greek name of Harmachis is derived from the Egypt ian word Makhu, for the balance or scales, and thence for the level of the equi nox , where the balance was erected on the day of weighi ng words and of reckoni ng the year s. The Horus of the doubl e equi nox was also termed “the doubl e Harmakhu” ( Records, v. 12, p. 53), and this dua lity was also imaged in the twofoldne ss of the Sphi nx, with its tail to the west and its head to the east, poi nting to the equi nox each way. But h ow was the crossing from west to east effected at the time when no Amenta had as yet been ope ned in the unde r world? The passage of the sun - god through the mount ain had been imaged as a passage through the cow of earth. We have a perfect survival of the m ythos in the Märchen of Tom Thum b or Little Tom, whom we claim as a British form of the solar Tum (or Nefer - Atum ). In the Egypt ian mythos Tum makes his passage through the mount by means of the cow , and is rebor n as Little Tum =Tom Thum b, from the Khepsh of the cow Meh - ur. It is said of him in setting from the western hor izon, “Earth stretches her arms to receive thee.” He is embraced by the mother, whos e wom b is the Meskhe n of rebirth ( Magi c Papy rus, p. 6, lines 3 and 4). And, again, at his goi ng forth to t he eastern hor izon, it is said, “Thou hast rested in the cow ; thou hast been immerged in the cow Meh - ur” ( Inscription of Darius, lines 27, 28) . Sebek - Horus swam the water as a crocodi le. The eel of Atum made the crossing through the mud of the morass. Khep er the beetle bor ed his passage through the earth; Behut et rode upon the vul ture’s wings ; Horus made the aerial voya ge as a hawk, and Har - Makhu crossed from one hor izon to the other through the hol low body of the Sphi nx. These were mode s of making a passag e when the nether earth had not been ope ned up by Ptah, and the Sekru - sledge , which preceded the boa t, had not been laid upon the stocks as the means of travelling by land which was"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"illustrated in the mysteries of Memphi s. But, how ever represented, the Hor us who crossed the abys s was named Har - Makhu, the god of the doubl e hor izon, or the doubl e equi nox. The principle of this dupl ication on the horizon of the East can be established by means of the two lions , which expr ess the doubl e glory of the doubl e Horu s, who was lord of the solar force that was doubl e in the vernal equi nox. Horus of the doubl e horizon was also Horus of the two lions . In the Ritual Horus rises again saying, “I am the twin lions , the heir of Ra” (ch. 38, 1). He is Horus rising in the stre ngt h of the two lions as the “lion of the lum inous cour se.” Again, he says: “I am the twin lions ” (62, 2). “I am the doubl e lion” (72, 9). “I go out from the dw elling of the two lions to the hous e of Isis the divine” (which was in Sothis), “I com plete the greatness of Shu the lion” (78, 22, 24). In a vigne tte to the Ritual the sun of to - day rises betwixt two lions , which represent Safre the sun of yesterday and Tua the sun of to - morrow . This is the Horus - 334 sun, and the two lions image the doubl e streng th or glory of Horus in the sign of Leo. One title of Har - Makhu, or Horus of the doubl e horizon, is Har - Khut i - Khepera, the Horus who made his transformation as the beetle - headed Khepera. The astronom ical locality for this particular transformation woul d n aturally be in the sign of Cancer, which the Egypt ians som etimes represented by two beetles, at other times by one . Either way, the beetle was the sign of Khepera as Horus of the two horizons . Thus , two beetles mark anot her station in which the Horus of th e doubl e hor izon manifests, as the solar deity, with redupl icated pow er; just as he emerges on the doubl e horizon from betwixt the two lions or Kherufu, in the sign of Leo, as the lion of the doubl e force. Unde r one of his zoot ype s, child - Horus was “the la mb, son of a sheep;” and the lamb on the western hor izon or mount attained the doubl e pow er of the adul t, as a ram in the oppos ite sign of Aries on the eastern mount . Inde ed, Pisces is the first of six signs in all of which this dupl ication of the solar po wer was represented in the zodi ac. In the sign of Aries, Horus was the lamb upon the western moun t who became a ram upon the hor izon east, as the adul t figur e of redupl icated pow er. In the sign of Taurus he was the calf which became a bul l. A vigne tte to c h. 109 of the Ritual show s the “Horus of the solar mount ” as the calf in presence of the god, and of the morning star upon the western mount . Hathor , the divine cow , is also present with the calf upon the mount . This is the calf that is to becom e a bul l, “ the bul l of the mother” on the Mount of Glory in the doubl e equi nox, where Horus, the fulfiller, attained the doubl e pow er. Now , if we suppos e the autum n equi nox to coincide at the time with the sign of Scorpio, the vernal equi nox woul d then occur in Tauru s, and in that sign the Horus calf woul d becom e a bul l as sym bol of the solar pow er that was doubl ed in the vernal equi nox. When the autum n equi nox coincided with the sign of Virgo the place of doubl e glory was in the sign of Pisces on the oppos ite hor izon . The god was conc eived as the child, calf, or youngl ing, in the west. As Sebek, his image was the crocodi le of Neith, the virgin in the sign of Virgo. The crocodi le in the Ritual is the Kamite “great fish.” Two crocodi les are therefore the two fishes. The se are exactly oppos ite the sign of “Virgo, ” and the two fishes=two crocodi les are the dua l sign of Horus in his doub le glory, as the expr ession of his doub le pow er in Pisces, like the two lions in the sign of Leo. This principle of dupl ication may be trac ed in six of the solar signs : There are two lions as suppor ters of the sun - god in the"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"sign of Leo; two beetles in the sign of Cancer; two twins in the sign of Gemini. Further, Horus was the calf on the western hor izon, who became the bul l on the horizon ea st; also the lamb on one side and the ram upon the other. Thus the dupl ication extends from the sign of Leo to the sign of Pisces inclusive, which represents the sun - god as Horus the child and Horus the adul t, whos e doubl e pow er or glory was expr essed by t wo lions , two crocodi les, and other type s of twinship, in addi tion to the twins or Gemini who were figur ed in the hum an form. Or if we read the signs the forward way, the two fishes correspond to the two crocodi les of Horus. The sun in Aries answers for t he ram and lamb; in Taurus for the bul l and calf. In the sign of the 335 Gemini there is a pair of twins. The sign of Cancer or the Crab was represented by two beetles in Egypt ian planisphe res. In the lion sign two lions , called the Kherefu, suppor ted th e young solar god in his resurrection on the horizon in Leo. Thus , when Horus of the doubl e hor izon was conc eived with the autum n equinox in the sign of Virgo, he was twinne d and brought forth with the vernal equi nox in Pisces, where two fishes=two crocodi les, mark the birthpl ace. The lamb and ram are twinne d in Aries; the calf and bul l in Taurus. If we take these six signs in the circle of precession the two lions correspond to the dua lity of Atum - Horus; the two beetles to Kheper - Ptah; the two Gemini to Su t and Horus; the bul l and calf to Osiris and Horus; the ram and lamb to Ammon - Ra and Khuns u, and the two fishes to the twin crocodi les, as six different illustrations of the sun of the two hor izons at six different landi ng - stages on the other side of the c elestial deep. Thus , the doub le Harmakhi s include s two characters correspondi ng to the two equi noxe s on the doubl e horizon. In one he is the conc ept of a virgin, in the other he is brought forth by the parturient mother. In one he was the calf in time, in the other he is the bul l of eternity. In the one he is Horus in matter, in the other he is Horus in spirit. In the one he is the child of twelve years; in the other he is the adul t of thirty years. The first was the founde r, the second is the fulfiller. Th e first was Horus of the incarnation, the second is Horus of the resurrection. Horus of the resurrection in the solar mythos was the prototype of Amsu in the eschatology, who rose up in spirit from the inert condi tion of the mum my, as conque ror of death an d all the bande d pow ers of evil. In both pha ses of character this is Horus of the doubl e force, the doubl e crow n, the doubl e feather, the doubl e Uræi, the doubl e life, or other type s of dupl ication, includi ng the doubl e equi nox . Thus the doc trine of a two fold adve nt for an ever - com ing child, bor n of a virgin mother, can be traced in the solar mythos to a beginni ng with Horus of the doubl e hor izon. Whatsoever the point in precession, the horizon of the resurrection or the mount of glory coincided with the v ernal equi nox. The little sun, the calf, or the child Horus entered the mount at the beautiful gate of entrance in the West, for breeding pur pos es, and rose again as the great sun, the bul l, the lion, the adul t Horus, that went forth at the beautiful gate of exit in the East to becom e the bul l of the mother when the godhood cons isted of the mother, the child, and the divine adul t. The mystery of the doub le hor izon was inde ed a riddl e of the Sphi nx. The great Sphi nx of Gizeh is traditiona lly reput ed to sym b olize the river Nile at its rising, when the sun coincided with the signs of Leo or Virgo in the water - season of the year. It"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"is now know n, how ever, to be a representative image of the god Har - Makhu. The Sph inx itself has spok en onc e. On the stele of Tahtm es IV. it is called “the Sphi nx of Khepera, the very might y, the greatest of the Spirits and the most augus t.” Now Kheper, the son of Ptah is, as already said, a form of Tum - Harmakhi s who was not simply a solar god of the doubl e hor izon. In the eschatology he became the god in spirit, the one god living in truth, the sole pow er that was worshippe d as eternal. This is the “greatest of spirits” represented by the Sphi nx of Khepera. 336 There had been a sort of hol low unde r - world made out before Amenta was established as “the earth of eternity” by the ope ner Ptah. This was the Akar, Khar, or Kar, ove r which the Sphi nx presided broodi ng in her mysteries of birth — the birth of light , of water, of food , of the young solar god , and, lastly, of an ever - living soul . We learn from the Ritual that the mystery of the Sphi nx originated with the mount of earth as the place of passage, of burial, and re - birth for the solar god . An ancient Egypt ian name for the Sphi nx is Akar. This also was a name for the hol low of the und er - world. The speaker, in the character of the newly - risen solar god, exclaims, “I am the offspring of yesterday. The tunne ls of the earth have given me birth, and I am revealed at my appoi nted time” in the com ing forth to day (ch. 64, Renouf ). It is said that the very bone s of the deities qua ke as the stars go on their trium pha nt cour ses through the tunne ls of the Akar (Pyramid Texts, Teta, 319) . It is demons trable that a passage through the mount of earth, the same that was made through the Cow , was follo wed by the passage through Akar, the Sphi nx, which was bui lt for the god Har - Makhu, the Horus - sun that was immeasurably earlier than Ra. The speaker is in Akar, which is represented by the godde ss Akerit because it was the place of bur ial and re - birth. The tunne l through the mount of the Sphi nx is obl ong; and it is not iceable that the oldest know n pyramid in Egypt , that of Medum , is neither coni cal nor qua drangul ar, but obl ong. To unde rstand the nature of the Akar, says Renouf , we have to imagine a tunne l s tarting from the spot where the sun sets and extendi ng through the earth as far as where the sun rises. Each end of the tunne l has a sphi nx - like form. A hum an - headed lion couc hes at the entrance and also at the end. It is through the paws of this doubl e sp hinx that the galley of the sun - god enters on the western hor izon and com es out on the eastern mount. In the picture, Plate 14, taken from the tom b of Rameses IV, “Fair entrance” (Aka Nefer) is written at one end of the tunne l, “Fair exit” (Par Nefer) at t he other ( Proceedings , Soc iety of Biblical Archy., vol . XV, pt. 8, p. 285) . These two gates of entrance and exit on the hor izon were called the gates of Akar, and som etimes the gates of Seb, the god of earth. They were the two gates of earth for the sun in the mythol ogy , and the two gates of Akar for the manes in the eschatology. Thus the twofold hor izon was imaged for Har - Makhu in the figur e of the doubl e Sphi nx. The traditions lead one to think that profound secrets were bur ied in the bui lding of the Sphi nx, as was the way with these bui lders, who put all they kne w into all they did. We gather from the stele of Tahtmes that the monu ment was bui lt to com memorate the sacred place of creation, or, literally, “of the first time,” an Egypt ian expr ession general ly used for the creation or “in the beginni ng. ” This sacred site is said to go back to the days of the masters of Kher or Kar, which as a divine locality was the Neter - Kar of the unde r - world or the abys s. Kher is likewise an ancient name of the Egypt ian Ba byl on, old Cairo. Like"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Babyl on, this was the gate or pathw ay of the gods — the place of exit, as we read it, for the seven elemental pow ers who issued from Amenta, as the uræus - deities, or seven spirits of earth. (Rit., ch. 83. ) In the beginni ng was the Mot her - earth as the wom b of uni versal 337 life; vegetable, animal, reptile, fish, bird, and hum an life. The uterine figur e was repeated in the making of Amenta as “the Tuat” for the birthpl ace of water and for edible plants, or, more generally, the elements of life. Thirdly, this type was imaged as the abys s of the beginni ng in the uranogr aphi c representation of the sout hern heaven. Earth was the wom b of life when life was bor n of water. The birth - place was imaged by the abys s of the Tuat, the well, the gor g e, or other type of utterance, from the secret sour ce in the sacred place of creation, the creatory of the Mother - earth. The water of life became a type of the eternal, the fabled fount of immortality that was so precious ly preserved in the divine unde r - wo rld; the living water that was sought for by the mother when she periodi cally lost her child, who was the same to her as the water of life, and who was found in the abys s, which was inde ed the place of its rebirth. The generation of life by water, the birt h of Horus by water and in food , was the profounde st of mysteries. This was the way that life actually came into the world, before the subj ect was made doc trinal. This was a life which did save the world when Horus the Messu was the saviour who naturally g ave fulfilment periodi cally to the prom ise that he made. In various legends the secret of this water of life that wells up in the subt erranean region is jealous ly gua rded by dragons , crocodi les, or other mons ters of the deep. In the Chaldean versions the s even Anunna ki or spirits of earth are the gua rdians appoi nted to keep the secret of the waters of life in this unde r - world to which the dead descende d and from which the elemental pow ers first ascende d to the surface of the uppe r earth. There is warrant fo r assum ing that the mystery of the beginni ng from the abys s was also one of the great secrets that was gua rded by the Sphi nx at Gizeh. The final fact is that the Sphinx was carved out of the rock at the exact centre of the earth to com memorate “that sacred place of the creation” or beginni ng which goe s back to the dom ain of Sut, and to “the days of the masters of Kher.” That is the beginni ng in and with the primordial munda ne abys s from which life emanated and from which the elemental pow ers or seven uræus - deities were bor n of Mother - earth. The Sphi nx, then, like the cow of earth, or the hol low mount , was a means of crossing the abys s in which hum an handi work had succeeded to the natural type as the figur e of a passage. It was made as the means of crossing f or Horus of the two hor izons or the doubl e equi nox. Thus , the Sphi nx is a monum ent that com memorates the foundi ng of the equi nox in the dou ble hor izon, and as this was assigne d to Atum Harmachis, it may account for the Hebrew tradition which associated Ada m with the equi nox , Adam being a Jewish form of the Egyp tian Atum . Harmachis entered the Sphi nx at suns et in the west or hinde r part, and was reborn in the east as Horus of the fore part, lion - faced. The means of crossing the dark gul f in the solar mythos was now the bridge in death and the mode of uni ting the two worlds in one , when the re - arising of the sun was succeeded by the resurrection of the soul , the lion having been adopt ed for the Sphi nx upon the hor izon east as an emblem of the doubl e pow er whic h made the passage for the sun - god or the"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"soul . The Sphi nx is male in front and female in the hinde r part. It is a com pound image of the Mother - earth and the young god whom she brought 338 forth upon the horizon of the resurrection. Without the mother th ere was no rebirth. Where the earth ope ns for the sunr ise it was called the unnu or out rance of Neith. As the Sphi nx appe ars to us it has the hum an face. But the god Tum - Harmachis was the lion of the solar glory, and his bringe r - forth as Sekhe t was the lio ness. The perfect type was dua l as the lion and the lione ss com bined, onl y the forepart has been rende red anthropom orphi cally in the likeness of the Pharaoh who was the lion - ruler at the time. The great Sphi nx as keeper of these secrets was couc hed in moun tainous repos e upon the hor izon in the eastern equi nox, when the gate of “fair exit” was in the lion - sign and the gate of “fair entrance” was in Aqua rius, the water - sign that is figured ove r the abys s of sour ce on the celestial globe . The Sphi nx then is a figur e of the doubl e hor izon and the dua lity of Har - Makhu when the place of conj unc tion was at the poi nt of precession in the lion - sign. And if, as is the Egypt ian way, the fact was registered forthw ith, we may date the Sphi nx as a monum ent which was reare d by these great bui lders and thinke rs, who lived so largely out of themselves, som e thirteen thous and years ago. The “Aten” of the so - called disk - worship was an ancient form of Har - Makhu, god of the doubl e hor izon. This, how ever, was not a worship of the solar disk. The disk was but an emblem of the circle made by Aten as the god of bot h hor izons . His was a com pound type of godhood, in which the mother was dua l with the son who was her child on one hor izon and her bul l or fecunda tor on the other. The word Aten, from At, was an ancient name for the child. Horus - Behut et, god of the hut or winge d disk, we take to have been the earliest form of Aten. This is the solar god who crossed from the hor izon west to the hor izon east upon the vulture’s wings , which wer e an emblem of the motherhood. The “hut ” was a dua l emblem of the divine infant and the mother as bearer of the child. As the bird she carried him ove r the intervening voi d of darkne ss where the Apap lay in wait. Thus the godhood of Aten cons isted of the m other, her child, and the adul t male or bul l of the mother, in a cult which preceded that of the fatherhood of Atum - Ra. The glory of Aten as the pow er that is doubl ed on the horizon of the Resurrection was the obj ect of regard in this religion, not the dis k. This cult of the mother and the child who was worshippe d in Egypt as Har - Makhu, the child com monl y called Horus on the hor izon, had an uns uspected developm ent amongs t the Mediterranean races. The Mycenæ an Tree and Pillar Cult is the title of a som ewhat recent work by Arthur J. Evans (London, 1901) . The title implies the com mon not ion that trees and pillars, “stocks and stone s” were directly worshippe d instead of the pow er that was represented by them in sign - langua ge. But a vol um e of evidence might be c ollected show ing that the supr eme obj ect of worship in this cult was the deity of the doubl e equi nox, the yout hful solar god who in Egypt was called “the doubl e Har - Makhu. ” Both tree and pillar had been figur es of the pol e before they were erected in the e qui nox . The tree was planted in the abys s as a figur e of the sout hern pol e, the “tall sycamore of Sut” or tree of the sout h. The colum n of stone was raised in Annu , as the pillar of the nor thern "},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"339 pol e. When the equi noxe s were established, tree and pil lar bot h were cont inue d and often blende d at the poi nt of equi poi se as figur es of the birthpl ace that was shifted to the zodi ac in the solar mythos . The Mithraic monu ments show us that the tree was a figur e of the equi nox, and that two trees represented th e doubl e equi nox when this was resting in the signs of Scorpio and Taurus (Drum mond , pl. 13) . Both tree and pillar had been type s of Hathor as the abode of Horus. In the Egyptian Ritual the tree marks the place of com ing forth and poi nt of emergence from A menta in the equi nox. “I am the babe,” says Horus four times. “I am the god within the ash tree.” “I am the link which conne cteth the solar orb with yesterday” — and also with to - morrow , as is show n by the two lions (ch. 18) . This conne cting link is Horus of the two hor izons , who is here brough t forth from the ash tree. When colum ns coul d be carved, the raising of the stone pillar took the place of planting the tree, or was adde d to it as a co - type of station. In the twelfth dyna sty the founda tion of a solar temple is described. Amenemha and his son Usertsen I. were on the throne conj ointly as representatives of the solar god of bot h hor izons . The King says, “Henceforth I will make monum ents and erect carved colum ns to the doub le Harmachis.” ( Records of the Pa st, vol . XII, p. 53. ) That is, to the sun - god of the two hor izons or the doubl e equi nox , who was here represented by the Pharaoh and his son. The Mycenæ an sym bol ism of the two lions with the central tree or pillar can be read if follow ed as Egypt ian, but not otherwise. The tree, the pillar, or the mount was female as a figur e of the birthpl ace, the place of exit for the babe bor n from the mount , the meskhe n, or its equi valent (in wood or stone ). For example, a birthplace in the stellar mythos was in Sothis , the star that show ed the birthpl ace of the babe. Both child and mother met in Sothis as Hathor and her infant Horus. She was the hous e of Horus. The hous e was imaged as a cone or a tree. This will expl ain why the Mycenæ an figur e accom panyi ng the tree - pil lar is at times a wom an and at other times a child. They are the godde ss and her babe, identical with Hathor and Child - Horus in the place of birth. In the gol d shrine found at Mycenæ a (Evans, fig. 65) the figur es on each side are two dove s. Now the dove in Egypt was the very ancient bird of Hathor , and the two dove s are a figur e equi valent to the mother and the child that was bor n within her shrine, her hous e, her pillar, or her tree, as her dove of the generative spirit, or the later Holy Spirit. The cult of the mother and child is also illustrated on the impression of a gem from Knos sos. A sheep represents the mother as suckler of the child beneath her — that is, her lamb, as Horus was called when this type had taken the place of the calf (Evans, fig. 17) . I n two of the Mycenæ an pictures the godde ss in person is placed betwixt the two lions (Evans, figs. 44 and 45) . This is she who was the tree or pillar, shrine or birthpl ace, whether as Hathor - Sothis or as bringe r forth of the deity of the doubl e hor izon in the vernal equi nox. Hathor was cont inue d as the Venus of the Mediterranean races. What then was the obj ect of the suppos ed “worship”? Was it the tree, the pillar, or bot h? or was it the godde ss who was represented by the tree and pillar? or was it the chil d who was re - born from the birthplace in the tree or rock or shrine? The solar birthpl ace on the 340 "},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"hor izon had long been represented by the tree, the mount , the cone , shrine, gate, por tal, the unnu or other forms of the ope ning which was always female, and a figur e of childbi rth in the mythos , when the mother was the earth. As Egypt ian the godde ss herself is som etimes por trayed; som etimes the child, and som etimes bot h the mother and the child, are imaged inside the pillar or cone which stands for the pl ace of birth (Schiaparelli, Piram idi Egiziane , plates). The cult, then, whether as Egypt ian or Mycenæ an, was a worship of the mother and child, the divine dua d that was so prevalent amongs t the Mediterranean races, and not a tree - and - pillar cult, not a wor ship of “stocks and stone s.” The doubl e axe of what has been called “the Mycenæ an tree - and - pillar cult” is an emblem of the doubl ed pow er, and the so - called god of the doubl e axe is cons eque ntly a god of the doubl e equi nox , who was Har - Makhu, the Horus wh o passed into Atum - Ra as the Egypt ian Zeus. The sun that made its way through the earth or the abys s was know n as the divider, or the cleaver. This was the solar pow er which clove its way from west to east and from horizon to hor izon as Har - Makhu, god of t he doubl e hor izon or doubl e equi nox in the annua l round . He was the cleaver of the earth, who was represented by the cleaver as an axe which, we take it, was a sign of Horus, the cleaver of the way. The god of the doubl e equi nox who com pleted the cour se fr om hor izon to hor izon was Horus of the doubl e force, which dou bled force was various ly imaged by the doubl e crow n, the doubl e uræi, the doubl e feather, the two lions , the two crocodi les, and other dua l type s. Hence the god himself is called “the doubl e Har machis.” He was cleaver of the way, whos e doubl e pow er was likewise imaged by the two - headed weapon which has been termed the “divine doub le axe” of the Mycenæ an cult. The type itself may have been derived from the Egypt ian nuter - sign of divinity, or pow er divinized, which was the stone axe of the Palæolithic age; and a doubl e axe woul d be the visible sym bol of the pow er that was doubl ed in the vernal equi nox. On a Mycenæ an vase from Old Salamis the doubl e axe is figur ed between two bul l’s heads, each of wh ich suppor ts a doubl e axe. If we take the doubl e axe as a sign of the pow er that was doubl ed in the equi nox, it seems to follow that this representation indi cates an equi nox in the sign of Taurus; and as the bul l’s head and the axe are bot h dua l, this will be the equi nox that was doubl e at the time of celebration, therefore the doubl e equi nox determined by the two bul l’s heads and the doubl e axe as signs of the solar pow er that was doubl ed in the vernal equi nox . The reader has but to take up Count d’Alviel la’s book on the Migration of Symbol s to see how widely spread this equi noc tial imagery became. In this we find: — Fig. 58.

The tree here is shaped like the ankh - cross, thus show ing it to be the tree of life upon Egypt ian ground. The Assyrian com bination of the sacred tree and wi nge d solar disk uni tes the tree of dawn with the rising sun, and the sym bol has the same signi ficance no matter whether the sun - god climbs the tree or the disk is borne on wings above its branches. The tree of dawn stands in the solar birthpl ace. This is i n the vernal equi nox as birthplace of the annua l sun. That which brings forth is the female, and the feminine nature of the type expl ains the fecunda tion of the tree by the two acolytes or geni who take the place of the two lions , crocodi les, dragons , beet les, cherubs , birds, and other type s of the suppor ting pair. Amongs t the co - type s of the tree may be reckone d the figure of a god or child, a cone or a cross, a pillar, papyrus - reed, a lotus or a vase, the unnu or ope ning, the meskhe n or birthplace, whence issued the yout hful solar deity now fulfilled of his dupl icated pow er. The two confront ed lions are com mon on the Mycenæ an gems as two heraldic suppor ts of the central figure. This in one instance is the radiating solar orb itself (fig. 41, Evans). In ano ther a male divinity stands betwixt the two lions (fig. 43, Evans). In others the figur e standi ng or seated between the two lions is the divine mother who brought forth in the equi nox . On two different glass plaque s from Mycenæ a (Evans, figs. 13 and 14) th e suppor ts on either side of the tree - pillar are two lions . Amongs t other figures may be seen: — Two lions with the sun rising fro m between them, the same as in the Egyptian representation. (Evans, fig. 42, A and B., Ritual, vignette, ch. 18.) Two lions supporting a tat or tree - pillar. (Evans, fig. 35.) Two lions back to back with the tree - pillar between. (Evans, fig. 39.) Two lions with the tree - pillar. (Evans, figs. 40.) Two lions pouring out libations on the pillar. (Evans, figs. 12, 13, 14.) Two lions with the god in person between them in place of the tree or pillar. (Evans, fig. 43.) Two lions, with the goddess in person between them in place of the symbols. This is she who wa s the tree, the shrine, pillar, or birthplace. (Evans, fig. 44.) Two lions with the goddess seated between them. (Evans, fig. 45.) Other pictures show the moun t of the equi nox , the tree at the meeting poi nt of sun and moon in the equi nox (Evans, fig. 4), the equi nox as mount betwixt two bul ls (Evans, fig. 3). In anot her scene two bul ls suppor t a tree - pillar (Evans, fig. 34). In one instance two sphi nxe s suppor t the tree - pillar (Evans, fig. 33). The solution now to be propounde d is that the mount or pillar – the shrine or the tree – determines the poi nt of equi nox; that the du al nature of the sym bol show s it to be the doubl e equi nox as place of re - birth for the god of the doubl e horizon, and that the two lions , two sphi nxe s, two beetles, two bul ls, rams, or goa ts denot e the particular sign of the zodi ac in which the vernal equi nox and the re - birth of Har - Makhu occurred at the time that is thus visibly por trayed. The mystery of Har - Makhu and the doubl e equi nox was know n to Paul, who was a master of the secret wisdom . The doc trine conc ern - 342 ing Tum - Harmachis is well stated b y him, onl y it has been rende red Hebraistically. The two Atum s, or Atum and Nefer - Atum , are replaced by the first and second Adam as the man of earth and the man from heaven. The second Atum was “he who is our peace” with the title of Iu - em - hetep. This, as the second Horus, was “he who made bot h one ” and"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"“broke dow n the middl e wall of partition, ” “that he might create in himself of the twain one new man.” “The middl e wall of partition” is a figur e in the eschatology of that which was a fact in the equi noc ti al mythos (Eph. II. 14, 15). Whatsoever the type , the doubl e equi nox was indi cated by the twofold figur e. Thus , if a tree were the sym bol , then two trees were the sign of the doubl e equi nox, and when Horus of the resurrection rises, let us say, as the goo d shephe rd betwixt two trees, it is, as now sugge sted, a por trait of Har - Makhu, the conne cting link between the two hor izons or two lives. Now , one of the com mone st scenes in the Rom an catacom bs is this of the two trees betwixt which rises the so - called Go od Shephe rd, who is som etimes a goa therd. There is a scene from the Rom an catacom bs in which the good shephe rd is the central figur e betwixt the two trees, two birds, and also the lamb and ram, by which the resurrection is to be identified with the vernal equi nox in the sign of Aries (Lundy, fig. 76). In anot her of the pictures from the catacom bs the good shephe rd is accom panied by bot h the lamb and the ram, which are at least equi valent to the dua l type of the equi nox in Aries. He carries the lamb upon his shoul ders, whilst the ram is resting at his feet (Lundy) . Horus was the lamb upon the western and the ram upon the eastern hor izon, bot h being uni ted in a figure of the doubl e pow er. A kindr ed representation is por trayed upon a Gnos tic stone now in the Br itish Museum . This is Horus the Gnos tic Jesus as Ichthus the fish. That the scene occurs in the sign of Pisces is show n by the two fishes, one of which is ove r the head of Horus, the other unde r his feet. The latter also repeats the ancient type of the cro codi le on which the divine child was suppor ted in the Cippi of Horus. Horus in Pisces. There is also an altar of the Palmyrene at Rom e which has the image of the solar god on one side, and on the other a coni cal cypr ess tree, the foliage of which exhi b its a child carrying a ram upon its shoul der (d’Alviella, Mig. of Symbol s ), which show s a singul ar reversal in the pos ition of the child and adul t. But it was the child= the lamb that issued from the maternal tree, to be follow ed by the adul t as the ram. Wh en Horus rises from the dead in the Egypt ian tom bs it is as the good shepherd. The crook and whip (or flail) of rule are the insigni a of his sove reignt y. According to the Ritual (ch. 109) , he rises up between two trees called the “two sycamores of emerald. ” Thus he is the perfect"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"prototype of the good shephe rd in the Rom an catacom bs. The god who rises in this character is Horus of the doubl e equi nox in the mythol ogy, and Horus in spirit in the eschatology, who by his resurrection joined the 343 two lives toge ther and the two worlds in one . The good shephe rd in the catacom bs is self - identified by the cloak he wears, which is the cloak of roya lty, as a figure of the roya l Horus, the child who was bor n and predestined to be king. T HE M AKING OF A MENTA The puz zle - picture of the astronom ical mythol ogy had to be collected from its many scattered parts and put toge ther piecemeal, and the method of presentment is panor amic. It was not practicable to tell the story straight through with chronol ogi cal seque nce. Fo r instance, in por traying the eschatology of the Ritual, in the four th book, the existence of Amenta had to be taken for granted, before the making of this unde r - world had been described as the excavation made by Ptah the ope ner and his seven Ali or co - wor kers. As a group, the eight great gods of Am - Khemen were follow ed by the Put - cycle or Enne ad of the Nine. The word Put, whence the name of Putah or Ptah, denot es the num ber nine, and the Put - cycle was formed when Ptah was adde d to the earlier eight great g ods . Neither Anup nor Taht was now the highe st one . The groups of seven and eight , how ever, were not subm erged. The group of seven survived as 344 the seven Knemmu, moul ders or metallurgists who assisted Ptah the divine craftsman, and the group of eight to which he was the ninth god are som etimes described as the children of Ptah. In an inscription at Edfu they are called “the most great of the first time; the augus t who were earlier than the gods , children of Ptah, who issued forth from him, enge nde red t o take the north and the sout h, to create in Thebes and in Memphi s; the creators of all creation, ” according to the later, i.e., solar mythol ogy . The earliest form of a divine fatherhood was out lined though not perfected in the pyg my Ptah; hence one of his titles is “the Father of the Fathers,” which indi cates the fatherhood that was founde d on the eldest brother. Ptah was a solar god who did not attain the status of Ra. Now , unt il the time of Ptah, Amenta was not found ed as the earth of eternity in the su bterranean regions , nor excavated from one hor izon to the other as a pathw ay for the noc turnal sun and the Manes. Sebek, the crocodi le - headed god, swam in the water round about the earth from west to east upon the out side of the moun t. Horus crossed the wa ters on the wings of the hawk. Behut et or Aten of the disk rode on the wings of the vul ture, Tum - Horus was the calf that issued from the cow of earth, and Har - Makhu passed from one side of the mount to the other through the body of the Sphi nx. The Amenta h ad not then been hol low ed out .

The two pillars of the sout h and north were likewise utilized. As it is said in the mythol ogi cal text fro m Memphi s, “the two pillars of the gateway of the hous e of Ptah are Horus and Sut,” which had previous ly represented the two pol es of Sut and Horus, the twin founde rs, as we show , in the beginni ng. An inscription found bot h at Edfu and Esné mentions the “ festival of the suspension of the sky” by Ptah, which was conne cted with a celebration of the winter solstice. It has been sugge sted by Krall that this had descende d from the time when “the winter solstice marked the beginni ng of the year and also of the c reation” (cited by Lockye r, Daw n of Astronom y, p. 284) . Unde r anot her figur e this suspension of the sky by Ptah in Amenta was celebrated in the mysteries of Memphi s by the erection of the doubl e Tat - pillar which suppor ted the sky and was originally a twofo ld figure founde d on the pol e, but the sky now suspende d in the doubl e earth of Ptah was not the sky of day. It is the firmament of the noc turnal sun through which it passed at night when in the nether world which is for the first time fully ope ned up by P tah the great architect of the uni verse, who follow ed the earlier sky - suppor ters, Sut, Horus, and Shu. The Kamite Amenta is “the grave of man’s lost world,” where his legenda ry garden of the beginni ng may be rediscove red. In this subt erranean count ry will be found a copy of the primary paradise of all mythol ogy, which can be restored from the Ritual and the imagery set in the stars of heaven, and prove d to be the work of ancient 345 Egypt ’s wisdom . The most primitive imagery was sacredly preserved in Ame nta, which makes the Book of the Dead an eschatologi cal record of the beginni ngs in mythol ogy that is unpa ralleled, and not unt il we have mastered the wisdom of Egypt as recorded in Amenta shall we be enabled to read it on the surface of the earth. First c om es the natural fact, next the mythical representation, and lastly the eschatologi cal appl ication of the type , be it the mount , or tree, the Deluge , the ark, the evil serpent, or the victorious young hero. All three pha ses have to be studi ed, collated, an d com pared; and for this pur pos e the Egypt ian Books of the Dead and of Amenta are worth all other sacred writings in the world. The primal paradise of uni versal legend was above the earth upon the sum mit of the mount , up which the spirits climbed to reach the region of eternal rest among the stars that never set. It was conf igurated round about the pol e of heaven. This has yet to be depicted as the mount of glory. The later paradise was sub - terrestrial, the earthly paradise of legenda ry lore. The first was stellar, the last is solar, and it is this last that was founde d on the subt erranean path of the noc turnal sun first ope ned up by Ptah. The dupl icating of paradise was partly a result of repeating the imagery of the stellar representation in the solar myth os. The mount of glory in the east was adde d to the moun t of glory in the nor th, with the wide water of the heavens flow ing round between the terrestrial and celestial paradise. Kosmas Indi kopl eustis ( A.D. 535) tells us that beyond the ocean in every direc tion there exists anot her cont inent which cannot be reached by man, but of which one part was inha bited by him before the Deluge . To the east, just as in other maps of the world and in later systems, he placed the terrestrial paradise and the four rivers t hat watered Eden which came by subt erranean channe ls to water the pos t - diluvi an earth"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"(Blake, Astronom ical Myths, pp. 266 - 7). This can be follow ed by means of the uppe r paradise of Am - Khemen, that was raised by Shu, and the low er one now conf igur ated by th e ope ner Ptah, who suspende d a sky ove rhead in Amenta. In the mythol ogy, Amenta is the subt erranean count ry of the sun by night . The dawn and suns et were its gates of glory. It is called the beautiful Amenta, the earth of eternity. It was the passage of t he sun that made the pathw ay of the solar circle which was com pleted in the eastern equi nox . Hence it is said of the sun - god , “The junc tion of the doubl e earth is the head of the coffin of Osiris, the beneficent soul in Sutenkhe n, who hath determined the p aths of eternity,” that is in completing a circle by making the passage through Amenta (Rit., ch. 17, Renouf ). The road to heaven for the manes now began with a pathw ay through the nether earth, from the place of suns et to the gate of sunr ise. Previous ly t he way to heaven was up the mount which was a figur e of the nor th celestial pol e. There was no solar passage through the nether regions in the stellar mythos ; the sun went round the mount of earth, not through it. Ptah the ope ner adde d earth to earth and h eaven to heaven, the solar mythos to the stellar. The sky upr aised by him is indi cated by the figur e of heaven reversed. It is called the firmament of Ptah. Hence it is said by the Osiris in Amenta, “Mine is the radiance in which Ptah floateth ove r his fir mament” (Rit., ch. 64), his firmament 346 being that of the noc turnal sun in the unde r - world. There was now a firmament above and one below the earth. The firmament upl ifted first by Sut, Horus, and Shu was suppl emented by a nether sky upraised and suspe nde d by the ope ner Ptah. The nnu, nun, or heaven is the celestial water, and this, as sky, was bot h above and below the earth. Now , the account of creation in the book of Genesis, with its waters above the firmament and its waters below the firmament, coul d not have been written unt il the division of these waters of heaven above the earth and of Amenta below the earth was effected when Ptah created the firmament of the nether - earth and raised anot her heaven in Amenta. In many places the name of Nut has the sign of heaven in the reversed pos ition, thus . Renouf asks, is this one more proof that the Egyp tians believed in a sky below the hor izon? (Book of the Dead, ch. 15, not e 7.) This, how ever, doe s not touc h bot tom . The Egypt ian wise men did not believe i n this nether sky; they created it as a figur e in sign - langua ge. Thus in the making of Amenta there was a sky above the unde r - world as well as ove r the uppe r earth; this is the nether sky that was suspend ed ove rhead by Ptah and memorized in the mysteries. When the sun - god Atum - Ra mount s into heaven from the garden of Aarru it is from the low er Aarru in the secret earth of Amenta. Hence it is said at the same time he “goe th to the field of Aarru, appr oaching to the land of spirits in heaven” (Rit., ch. 17, Renouf ), i.e., to the uppe r Aarru, which was in the heaven of eternity, not in the nether - land of the doubl e earth, called the earth of eternity. This dua lity has to be com pletely com prehende d before the Ritual can be read, or its traditions follow ed round the world, as for example, in the Hebrew Genesis and the Assyrian legends of creation. Paradise in Amenta is said by the deceased to be the “beautiful earth of eternity.” But the deceased doe s not stay in it as his place of repos e. It is not the eternal dw elling. In passing through Amenta he is bound for the heaven of eternity above . This"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"below is but the earthly paradise, and there is an uppe r paradise to be attained across the celestial waters by thos e who can secure a seat in the boa t of Ra. The typi ca l moun t was doubl ed; a mount ain east was adde d to the most ancient mount of the north, which som etimes makes it look as if the site of the primitive paradise had been shifted and slewed round from the north to the east. The mistake hitherto made regarding the mount is in suppos ing the mount of earth, or Amenta, to be identical with the mount of the nor th, whereas the two belong to two distinct systems of the mythos , stellar and solar. The mount of heaven was stellar in the nor th; the moun t of earth is solar in the east. The mount of heaven had its sum mit at the north celestial pol e; the mount of Amenta was level with the sky - line on the hor izon. There is also a doubl e judgm ent seat, and a twofold judgm ent. One great hall was in Amenta. The other was at the a pex of the hill of heaven, the maat of the final judg ment that was given on the last great day. When the two are sunde red, we som etimes find the judgm ent seat is imaged at the nor th celestial pol e; at others, the great judge is seated as the Rhat - Amenta or Rhada - manthus , in the maat of the nether - earth. This doubl e maat or seat 347 of judgm ent can be expl ained by the Egyptian wisdom . It was the individua l judgm ent that now took place in the maat of Amenta. This was the first judgm ent of two; the second is the last great judgm ent in the maat above . The first is beneath the tree of dawn, the second is unde r the tree of the pol e. Thos e who were conde mned as gui lty in the primary trial of the dead suffered the second death in Amenta. They went no farther, but were extingui shed in the tank of flame or anni hilated on the highw ays of the damned. Thus the two different resurrections are differentiated the one from the other, in the Gospel according to John, when it is said the dead are to com e forth; they that have done evil to “the resurrection of judgm ent,” and they that have done good unt o “the resurrection of life.” Both resurrections occur in the Ritual; one for the judgm ent in Amenta, the other on the mount for the last judg ment and the resurrection to eternal life. The garden of Aarru or paradise of the eight great gods , whom we identify as a group with the seven in the Lesser Bear, plus the deity of the pol e - star, was in the nor th. Not on the hor izon nor th, but at the celestial pol e that was figur ed as the s um mit of a very lofty mount , the mythical moun tain of the north, diamond - poi nted at the apex with the pol ar star, whereas the Semitic Eden is the garden eastward. This is relatively late, because it belongs to the solar and not to the stellar mythos . It is not the circum pol ar paradise of earlier tradition. That may be the reason why the moun t is om itted from the book of Genesis. It is not Am - Khemen, the paradise of the eight great gods . It is the enclosure of the pair who in the solar mythos were Atum =Adam and the Great Mother Kefa=Chavah. The earth itself was figur ed as a mount ; its highe st poi nt was in Apta, at the equa tor. When tunne lled for a passage through it, this became the mount ain of Amenta, also the fune ral mount . The place of entrance for the su n or the manes of the dead was in the west, or, as it was termed, the western hill. The mount of earth is the mount of birth for Horus in the solar mythol ogy. The mount of heaven is the mount of rebirth for soul s in the eschatology. Both have been linke d t oge ther but not blende d in the Egypt ian representation, when the Osiris makes his jour ney from the base of the mount in"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Amenta, to the sum mit of Mount Hetep it may look as if the mount were all in one , but it is not so. There was a doubl e mount ; the mount of earth which was solar, and the mount of heaven which was stellar. In the Ritual (ch. 108 ) the mount of earth is said to be “the hill on which heaven resteth.” This is called the hill Bakhu, the solar mount . Its dimensions in lengt h and breadth are given in som e of the early papyr i. In the Papyr us of Nebseni the hill is 300 cubi ts in breadth. In the Turin Ritual it is 140 cubi ts in breadth. Now it happe ns that in the Mexican mythol ogy there is a “mount ain of the locust” or the mount of Capul tepec, and the ideogr aphi c signs of this mount ain include the follow ing num erical figur es: These figur es are Egypt ian. The sign is a figure of ten, which goe s 348 back to the origin in digital reckoni ng, as it is derived from the two hands clasped and cut off at the wrists. The Mexican figures therefore repeat the Egypt ian at the value of 10 × 14= 140, whatsoever the num bers may mean (Kingsbor ough, I, pt. 3, p. 10, fig. 218) . The Japanese also have the doubl e Mount Kagu; one is on t he earth, or rather it is the earth; the other is in Ame or heaven, the divine mount , that is the heaven, which had the North Pole for its highe st peak ( Trans . As. Soc . Jap., VII, p. 431 ). The Japanese likewise have the eight great gods of the mount , who a re said to have been produc ed by Kagut suchi, which we take to be a form of the original eight Kami that correspond to the Kamite Khemenu, the eight great gods in Am - Khemen, the heaven upr aised by Shu. The same dua lity of the moun t is illustrated in the two Chinese Kwenluns . Here the terrestrial paradise is described as being at the centre of the earth. The Queen - Mother dw ells there alone in its midst. At the sum mit there is a resplende nt azure hall, with lakes enclosed by precious gems. Above the clear ethe r rules the ever - fixed, the pol ar star ( Chinese Recorder, vol . IV, p. 95) . This is the Egypt ian mount of Amenta in which Hathor was que en. The “azure hall” is the empyr ean ove r the sum mit of the munda ne mount , which is here identified as the mother - mount . The other mount is celestial; on its sum mit at the nor th star is the heavenly palace of Shang - ti at the centre of the circum pol ar paradise, with its circle of thirty - six gods or rulers, which answer to the thirty - six decans of the zodi ac. The Toda s also h ave the twofold mount . Their mount ain of the world is the Makur ti, or navel of the earth, the pillar of the firmament. It is a tow ering rock, upon the table - land of which the soul s of the dead assemble for the leap into the abys s of waters that lies betwix t them and the mount of heaven. Either they, in com mon with som e other races, have lost, or never had, the solar boa t of the Egypt ian eschatology, by which the base of one mount was reached from the sum mit of the other. But, sink or swim, the jour ney tis t he same. So is the celestial chart. Hence the Toda s can see the cow s that grace the fields of heaven in the nebul æ of the Milky Way. These correspond to the"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Kamite cow s, the givers of plenty in the meadow s of Aarru, that rest by the still waters at the hea d of the river of light and the twin lakes in the region of the north celestial pol e. This stellar mount ain in the nor thern heaven and solar mount ain in the east will likewise account for the twofold moun t of the Babyl oni ans. Lenor mant describes the two s om ewhat conf usingl y, but no expl anation of their dua lity has ever been given. He says, “Above the earth extende d the sky, and revol ving round the mount ain of the east, the colum n which joined the heavens and the earth and served as an axis to the celestial vault. The culminating poi nt of the heavens, the zenith (Nuzku) was not this axis or pol e. On the cont rary, that was situated immediately above the count ry of Akka dia (in the nor th), and was regarded as the centre of the inha bited lands , whilst the mount a in which acted as a pivot to the starry system was to the nor th - east of this count ry. Beyond the mount ain, and also the nor th - east, extende d the land of Aralli, which was rich in gol d, and was inha bited by the gods and blessed spirits.” (Lenor mant, Chal dea n 349 Magi c and Sor cery, Eng. tr., pp. 151 , 152 .) The mount of earth and moun t of heaven becom e the doubl e mount in the Babyl oni an version. As it is said of Gilgames, “To the mount ains whos e name is doubl e, to the twin mountains in his cour se he came.” T he mount of earth or Amenta below was entered in the west. The uppe r mount was also entered at the west in the heaven of the setting stars. There is proba bly an astronom ical datum in the Babyl oni an legend. The scorpion - men are said to keep the gate and gua rd the sun. “Over them rising was the threshol d of heaven. Below them the tom b sank dow n.” The tom b is Aralli (or Amenta) in the mount. The threshol d of heaven was at the sum mit of the mount . We take the scorpion - men to denot e the western equi nox in the si gn of Scorpio when that was the gate to the twin mount ains, otherwise the moun t of earth and heaven, the mount whos e sum mit was the rise in Hetep at the pol e. In Pahlavi the two mount ains of heaven and earth are know n as Mount Taêra, the centre of the uni v erse, and Kakad - i - Dâîtîk, the centre of the earth ( West. Pahl avi Texts, I, pp. 22, 36) . Here the earth centre is distinct from the centre of the uni verse or moun t of heaven which preceded the mount of earth, and the two different centres correspond to the two different forms of the mount of earth and the mount of heaven. The heaven of the beatified had been appa rently shifted from the nor th to the east when certain chapters of the Ritual were written, which is the same as saying the solar had then succeede d and to a great extent supe rseded the stellar mythos . The sun in its supr emacy obs cured the stars. Anup was merged in Osiris; the seven glorious one s became the servants of Horus and subs idiary soul s of Ra. The place of sunr ise in the east was figur ed as the mount of glory in relation to Amenta instead of the mount in the celestial nor th; otherwise said, it was interpol ated in the solar mythos . Paradise now was bot h terrestrial (or sub - terrestrial) and celestial; in the east as well as on the northern sum m it, because it was solar as well as stellar. Not that the uppe r paradise was obl iterated or really lost. That onl y happe ned in the absence of the gnos is. Am - Khemen remained aloft, and the uppe r paradise of two was still led up to by the mount , the tree, th e way of soul s, or the river of the Milky Way. One form of this dua lity was represented in the Ritual by the mythical two hous es, the great hous e and the hous e of flame. The speaker says, “Let my name be given"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"to me in the great hous e. Let me remember my name in the hous e of flame on the night when the years are count ed and the mont hs are reckone d one by one ” (ch. 25). The great hous e was stellar in the heaven at the celestial nor th; the hous e of flame (Pa - Nasrut) was solar in the east. Egypt ian temples we re bui lt upon this dua l plan, and each had its great hous e and its hous e of flame. The great hous e was central, like the lady - chapel in Europe an chur ches, and the hous e of flame was on one side of it. The great hous e in a central pos ition corresponds to th e mount of heaven with its spire at the celestial pol e. The hous e of flame was a kind of side entrance to the mount in the east, which is equi valent to the gate of sunr ise. The chur ch to - day remains a dua l figur e of this doubl e hous e when bot h are blende d toge ther in one bui lding. The nave with its door way to the east corresponds to the mount of earth, and the 350 spire is a figure of the pol e or mount of heaven. One of the most perfect ways of illustrating this dua lity is show n by the mode of burying the dead in the Pyramid of Medum . Prof. Petrie says the bodi es were laid on their left side with the head to the nor th and the face turned to the east ( Medum , pp. 17, 21) . This pos ition of the dead is also indi cated by the prayer of the manes that he may “fee d on the food of Osiris, on the eastern side of the mead of amaranthine flow ers” (the kaiu of the oasis) (Rit., ch. 26, Renouf ). The face is here turned after death to the eastward side of the paradise that was primarily figur ed in the nor thern heaven. Wh en it was discove red that the earth rotated on its axis and was afloat in space, it was know n to revol ve on the doubl e poles, and what we call the two pol es of the earth were signi fied by the twofold tat - pillar of Ptah. The tat is a type of stability. The doubl e tat is the sign of tattu as the place of establishing for eternity, and tattu, like other mythical localities, was doubl ed when Amenta was founde d. It is not iceable that when Queen Hatshepsu had erected her two pillars she says she has made two obe l isks for him who is the lord of the throne s of the two worlds, or, as we shoul d say, of earth and heaven ( Records, vol . II, p. 132; 2, Pap. of Ani, pl.). This touc hes the origin of the well - know n doubl e pillar, the signi ficance of which is not kno wn. The d oubl e obe lisk is a co - type with the twofold mount , and the two pillars of Tattu, the place where it was show n that earth was fixed and heaven made stable for ever, on the two pillars of Sut and Horus, which had been the two pol es in Equa toria. The two obe l isks then, imaged the throne s of two worlds, the doubl e earth, or earth and heaven; and in Amenta the two pillars form the door way from the one world to the other. So in the Japanese mythol ogy the divine pillar of earth, Kuni - no - mi - Hashira, was adde d to th e divine pillar of the heavens, Ame - no - mi - Hashira ( Kojiki, Chamberlain’s Version, p. 19) . How it was adde d can be expl ained by the Egypt ian wisdom . The pillar of heaven was first erected. Shu - Anhur lifted up the heaven from the earth with that which cons ti tuted the divine suppor t as prop, pillar, or lion - like strengt h in sustaining the paradise above . The pillar of heaven naturally stood upon the earth to suppor t the heavens; but when the earth was hol low ed out by Ptah, the excavator, there was anot her ear th below in which the pillar had to be re - erected, and this pillar of the doubl e mount was represented by the doubl e Tat of Ptah as the backbone of that god, or later of Osiris. The Japanese also have the two pillars called the awful pillar of heaven, the pillar being a co -"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"type with the mount . “Heaven’s one pillar” was an ancient name for the Japanese island of Ski (Chamberlain, Kojiki, p. 23) . The Japanese have also a pillar whos e founda tion is at the centre of the world, where stands the tat or pole of Pt ah suppor ting the nether sky. In Chinese legenda ry lore there is a pillar that sustains the earth. They also have a pillar which sustains the heaven. These two correspond to the pillar of Shu that suppor ts the firmament above and the tat - pillar of Ptah whi ch suppor ts the earth in Amenta below . These are distinct from each other; they belong to two entirely different mythical creations , and cannot be resolved into one singl e pillar derived from the mount of earth as axis - 351 pillar of the heavens. Heaven had rested on the pillar of the earth or the pillars raised upon the munda ne mount by Shu. But the tat - pillar of Ptah was erected in the nether earth of two. Cons eque ntly our earth was then suppor ted on the pillar of Ptah. This will expl ain the tradition o f the Chinese, the Thlinke et Indians, and others, that the earth rests upon a pillar. Thus , as Egypt ian, there are two divine pillars answering to the doub le mount , which we call the pillar of Shu and the tat - pillar of Ptah. One is the sustainer of the fir mament above the earth, the other is the suppor t of the firmament below the earth. The two toge ther are the doubl e pillars of earth and heaven. This will enable us to read one of the many Greek märchen, which reflect and refract the Egyp tian mythos . There is a legend of Herakles relieving Atlas as sustainer of the heavens, or, in the original, the ceilings of the doubl e earth. Atlas is the Egypt ian Shu - Anhur , the elevator of the sky. And the relief of Atlas by Herakles is equi valent to the relief of Shu by the sun - god Ptah as sustainer of all things in Amenta, when the pillar of earth or tat of Amenta was adde d to the pillar of heaven. When the earth was doubl ed and the noc turnal sun god passed through Amenta as Ptah or Sekari with his tat, he was the susta iner in the nether earth who might be said to relieve Shu of his bur den in the uppe r earth. Horus is the prototype of Herakles, and Horus or Ptah in Amenta is the might y Herakles of this Greek fancy which so often takes the place of fund amental fact. There is no trusting the märchen in their Greek or Hindu , Hebrew or Christian gui se, without com paring them with the originals. Greek legends also assert that Herakles separ ated two mount ains to form the two colum ns or pillars which were a dua l figur e of the tw ofold munda ne and celestial mount . This helps to identify the doubl e colum ns with the moun t of earth and the mount of heaven. Many illustrations coul d be cited of these two pillars erected at the entrance to the temple or hous e of a god. Herakles, says Her odot us, was worshippe d in a temple at Tyre, and in the temple “were two pillars, one of fine gol d, the other of emerald stone , bot h shining exceedingl y at night ” (Bk. II, 44). These are, to say the least, som ewhat sugge stive of the green mount of earth, th e Egypt ian moun t of emerald, and the gol den mount of heaven, which survive as the “green hill” far away and “Jerusalem the gol den” in the Christian hym ns. The backbone was a figure of the pol e: it is at one time the backbone of Sut, at anot her the backbon e of Anup, at anot her of Ptah or Osiris — the backbone being a natural type of sustaining pow er. This at first was singl e as a figure of the pol e. It was dupl icated in Amenta, the same as was the pillar of suppor t and other figur es of sustaining pow er. The p ow er of Ptah in Amenta is not simply that of the pillar or"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"backbone . These are doubl ed in the earth of eternity to expr ess his pow er as sustainer of the uni verse. The figure is referred to in the magic papyr us as the long backbone of Ptah, the Nemma. “O Ne mma of the great face, of the long backbone , of the deformed legs! O long colum n which com mences in (bot h) the uppe r and the low er heaven. O lord of the great body which repos es in Annu, ” the place of the colum n or pol e, now doubl ed in Amenta ( Magi c Papy ru s, Records, vol . X, p. 152) . There was a tende ncy to blend the twofold mount in one as in the doubl e Mount 352 Meru, which is som etimes denom inated the North Pole, but was primarily a figur e on earth of the pol e in heaven, like the mound of earth and the cone or pillar. But Meru was doubl ed or divided into uppe r and low er, called Su - Meru and Ku - Meru, when it imaged the mount that was ope ned for the passage of the heavenly bodi es through the nether earth. One moun tain standi ng in the east and one in the no rth were not vertically blende d in one . They were sym bol ical of the doubl e mount of earth and heaven as a figure, but this was in the end, not at the starting - poi nt. The Kamite teachers also imaged the two pol es as the two trees called the two sycamores o f the sout h and nor th. The later tree in Eridu, as well as the Norse tree Yggdr asil, was com pounde d of the two as the tree which had its root s dow n sout h or in the unde r - world, and its branches high up in the northern heaven; a twofold tree that correspond ed to the doubl e mount . Again, the rock is a co - type with the mount , and the doubl e rock is equi valent to the twofold mount . These two were also blende d in one as in the rock that “begat” the Israelites. The rock and the doubl e rock are bot h mentione d in t he Ritual (ch. 134) . Taht the moon - god is said to be the “son of the rock proceeding from the place of the two rocks” in Anruti (Renouf , ch. 134) . The name of Anruti identifies the doubl e rock with the doubl e hor izon, which was also called the doubl e mount , . The son of the rock who proceeds from the two rocks is the moon - god as the son of earth and heaven, or son of the doubl e mount of earth and heaven, the two rocks having been blende d in one as a typical figure of Osiris, the rock of eternity, imaged as the pol e of heaven. The twofold origin of the mythical mount is now sufficiently established in relation to identifiable natural facts which alone can furnish the proof that the mount , the pol e, the tree, the paradise, pillar, colum n, or backbone were sin gle in the stellar and are dupl icated in the solar mythos , and that this dupl ication follow ed on the making of Amenta. The Rig - Veda speaks of “him who, as the collective pillar of heaven, sustains the sky” (Wilson, 3, 143 , 144 ). This collective pillar was the dua l type of the twofold mount of earth and of heaven imaged in one figur e of suppor t. The Hebrew pillar of the low er and uppe r paradise that is called “the strengt h of the hill Zion” was anot her form of the collective pillar. As Egypt ian, this collec tive pillar was the doubl e tat of Ptah erected in Amenta. The tat - pillar of Ptah and Osiris was cont inue d in the ancient Germanic Irmin pillars, which were mostly made of wood. The mythical pillar Irminsul was that which joined toge ther earth and heaven, l ike the mount of Amenta and the tat - suppor t of the gods . The Irmin - pillars were a form of the Hermae in Greece that were set up as bounda ry signs at cross roads and street corners to mark the extent of certain lands . This poi nts to an origin for their name . In Egypt ian the word remen or ermen denot es the"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"extent as far as the limit or bounda ry. Rema or erma is a measure of land. The deity Irmin, like Hermes of the pillar, was a god of boun daries. If the mount or the pillar had been singl e and not doubl e, th ere woul d have been no voya ge across the water that flow ed between the mount of earth and the mount of heaven; no need of boa t or bridge 353 or place of “jum ping off” from one side to the other. If the mythical mount had simply been a singl e figur e of th e uni verse axis (as O’Neil describes it), the climbers woul d have gone straight up to heaven, whereas the solar mount of glory in the east did not and coul d not blend vertically with the stellar mount of glory in the nor th. The moun t was dua l; the water ra n betwixt the two, and that necessitated the means of crossing from one to the other. Nothing coul d make the uni verse axis twofold, in keeping with the doubl e mount of earth and heaven. And this dua lity alone will expl ain why one type shoul d be cons idered female, the other male. The mount or pillar of earth was an image of the Great Mother as bringe r - forth, and the mount or pillar of heaven was typi cal of the fatherhood, the “rock that begat,” or rather of two sexes in one nature as they were blende d in the deity Ptah, Atum , Osiris, Ihuh, and Brahm a. The type of this dua lity is to be seen in the navel, the um bilicus, and the nabhi yoni uni ted and imaged in one as a figur e of the birthpl ace and prototype of the navel mounds ; the pit below and the pile of stone s above , the well and pyramid, the chur ch and steeple, the grave and monum ent. When the solar mythos had been adde d to the stellar, the pathw ay to paradise was through the nether - world. The road of the sun in the mythos now became the road of soul s in the eschatology. The entrance to the unde r - world was cons eque ntly in the west. The maker of the road was the noc turnal sun as the bul l or god of the west. One name of the western hill is Manu. It is said to Ra when setting, “Wake up from thy rest; thine abode is in Manu” (Rit., ch. 15) . This appa rently survives in the Samoan Mane. At death, the soul went to a paradise in the western horizon called Mane=Manu. “The dyi ng, ” says the missiona ry Turner, “were urgent in beggi ng thos e around them to see and make the tapune a or pessom ancy go all right , and so secure an entrance to the Mane paradise” ( Sam oa, p. 294) . If the pebbl es used for divination turned out odd instead of even it was thought that the soul woul d be caught and crushed between two great stone s at the entrance to the mount . The “hol low pit” was a name of the Samoan Hades. At the bot tom there was a runni ng stream which floated the spirits away to the Hades of Polotu. They were but little more than alive and onl y half cons cious unt il they reached Polotu, where there was a bathing - place called Vaiola or “the water of life.” In this water all infirmities were washed away and the aged recove red their lost yout h. Their new bod ies were singul arly vol atile, like the Egyp tian sahu. They coul d ascend to earth at n ight , becom e lum inous sparks or vapour , revisit their old hom es and retire at early dawn to the bus h or to Polotu (Turner, Sam oa, pp. 258, 259) . The subt erranean world of the Lapps is identical with the Amenta of the Egyp tians. Jabm a - Aimo is the hous e of t he dead in the nether - earth, which is a place of transition for thos e who have their bodi es renewed, who pass on and are taken up to heaven. Their hom e of the gods , Taivo Aimo, also answers to the uppe r Aarru - paradise of the Ritual. The jackal or dog is th e gui de of the dead through the paths of darkne ss in the nether - earth, and the Inoi t dead are said to descend by the"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"“dog’ s path” into their unde r - world. This is a most obs cure road, answering to the path of darkne ss in Amenta. The subt erranean region desc ribed at times as being 354 subm arine is the com mon sub - terrestrial paradise of the Inoi t peopl e generally. When the nether - world had been com pletely excavated by Ptah, Amenta was established as the low er story of two in the mount of earth which hencefo rth becom es the mount of Amenta. The name denot es the hidde n or secret (Amen) earth (ta). It is also called the earth of eternity, the land of the living; for the Egypt ians call thos e the living whom the less spiritualistic mode rns designa te the dead. The mount of earth became the mount of Amenta because Amenta had been tunne lled through the low er earth. It became the fune real mount because Amenta was the earth of the manes. In the Egypt ian chart the west is the beautiful gate of entrance to this divine net her - world, otherwise called the land of life. It is not paradise itself, but the way to it through pur gatory. The beautiful gate of exit was at the place of sunr ise, not suns et, in the garden eastward, and this was the locality of the terrestrial paradise, which was a copy of the garden of Aarru first conf igurated in the circum pol ar heaven of the stellar mythology. The dead in Egypt were called “the westerners.” On the way to the place of bur ial the mour ners sang the fune ral song “To the west, to the west, to the west!” The mum my was ferried ove r the water to the western mount , where Hathor - Isis or the cow waited to receive the solar god, and in his track the soul s of the departed. The entrance to the moun t was show n as the mout h of the cow , or cleft in the rock, such as was seen in the immediate neighbour hood of Abydos , which was reached through a narrow gor ge in the Libya n range , whos e “mout h” ope ned in front of the temple of Osiris - Khentamenta a little to the nor th - west of the city (Maspero, Daw n of Civili zation, Eng. tr., p. 197) . Here the soul s of the departed were suppos ed to enter and descend into the nether - world. The sun - god is described in his passage to the western hor izon (or mount ), whilst earth, as the mother, stretches her arms out to receive hi m. “In rapture is thy mother, the godde ss Meru, as thou dos t emit the irradiation of light till thou reachest that mount ain which is in Akar,” i.e., till suns et, when he will enter the female receptacle for his new birth. Taking this to be imaged by Isis a s the sacred heifer, the place of entrance is her mout h, and the place of exit was uterine, to the east of the mount (Magic Papyr us, p. 5, Records, vol . X, 145. ) The entrance into the mount of earth which was personi fied as the old first mother is one of the expl oits of Maui in the märchen of the Maori. Maui, at the end of his victorious career, that is at suns et, com es back to the count ry of his father and the land of his great ancestress Hine - neu - te - Po, the great wom an of the unde r - world, who is to be se en in the hor izon, “flashing, and, as it were, ope ning and shut ting. ” So Apt the hippopot amus and Hathor the cow may be seen in the cleft of the moun t that ope ned at suns et for the passage of the solar god, the mout h of the cow being equi valent to the clef t in the mount . Maui came to where the ancient giantess lay sleeping, with the obj ect of passing through her without waking her. He entered her body , but when he was half in and half out , a little bird, the Tiwakawaka, laughe d aloud to see the sight , and w oke the sleeper, who closed her thighs on Maui and crushed him so "},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"355 that he died, and thus brought death into the world; otherwise, it was fabled that the solar hero died to rise again in passing through the nether - world of darkne ss, and this was a pri mitive mode of por trayal. In the Kamite mythos he passes through the female hippopot amus or cow , or the sphi nx, all of which were figur es of the mother in the mount , otherwise the ancient Mother - earth. It is common for a cavern or entrance in the west to b e poi nted out as the way into spirit - world that leads to the fields of paradise. This is found in the Aztec Mictlan or land of the dead. The Fijian descent into the unde r - world is exactly the same as the Egypt ian. The dead go dow n in the west on their way to the judgm ent seat of Ndenge i (Williams, Fiji, vol . I, p. 239 ), just as the Egypt ian dead embark in the west for the judgm ent seat of Osiris. The nether - earth, Ngamat, of the Australian Woiworun also corresponds to the Kamite Amenta. It is the receptacle of the sun beyond the western edge of the earth, and likewise an abode for the departed, who do not remain there permanently, but com e back to our earth at times as the nga maget, like the manes in the Ritual. (How itt on Australian medicine - men.) In vario us märchen and other irrespons ible legends derived from mythol ogy we hear of heaven being situated in the west — that is, as the place of suns et. The Buddhi sts have their western paradise. The paradise of the Ottom acks of Guiana and of the Araucanians is in the west. The heaven of the Toda s, the Kalmucks, the Samoans, and others was localized in the west. The Iroquo is and Ojibw as describe the soul s of their dead as travelling westward till they com e to the plains of paradise. The Sekhe t Hetep or the fields of rest in Aarru are represented in the noble island of Flath Innis, the place of rest from storm and strife to which the Keltic heroes went in death, as a paradise in the western ocean. The Elysian Fields and Golden Isles of the Greeks were in the west. But that is onl y because the entranc e to the earthly par adi se was in the west, according to the solar mythos . At Samoa, says Gill, a spirit leaving the dead body at the most easterly island of the group woul d be com pelled to traverse the entire series of isla nds , passing the channe ls between at given poi nts, ere it coul d descend to the subt erranean spirit - world at the most westerly poi nt of Savaiki (p. 160 ), which right ly identifies the west with the gat e of entranc e to the earth of eternity. In the wisdom of “Manihiki” it is related as anot her of the expl oits of Maui that he found out the way to the nether - world. He had watched and seen his father go according to his wont to the main pillar of his dwelling and say “O pillar! ope n, ope n up, that Manua hifare ma y enter and descend to the nether - world,” which was the Heptanom is or seven sunke n islands of Avaiki. The pillar immediately ope ned, and Manua hifare descende d. Maui repeated the magic words of his father, and to his great joy the pillar obe diently ope ned, and he bol dly made his descent into the low er regions . Whilst expl oring this subt erranean spirit - world, Maui fell in with a blind old wom an, who turned out to be his ow n grandm other. Here also was the paradise in which the tree of healing grew, and with th e fruit of which Maui restored sight to the eyes of Ina - the - blind. (Gill, Myths and Songs , pp. 64 - 66.) The incident of a rock or door that 356 "},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"ope ns when the magic formula is uttered, and in no other way, is well - nigh uni versal. It may be termed the “ope n sesame” legend. In a Chinese version Chang discove rs the entrance to the unde r - world by findi ng out the secret of the stone door in the cave of Kwang - siu - fu in Kiang - si. “One day he ove rheard a genie saying, “Stone doo r, ope n! Mr. Kwei - ku is com ing. ” The reupon the door ope ned and the genie went in. When he came out he said, “Stone door , shut ! Mr. Kwei - ku is goi ng. ” Chang tried the charm, and found a vast paradise within, and there he lost his old grandm other. (Denny’ s Folk - lore of China, p. 134. ) In a Zul u tale the word is “Rock of two hol es, ope n for me, that I may enter” (Callaway, Tales, pp. 140 - 142) . In a Samoan rende ring it is “Rock, divide! I am Talanga : I have com e to work” (Turner, Nineteen Years in Polynesia, p. 252) . The sacred hol e - stone , the ne edle’s eye, the chimney, or the cow , and other apertures through which the twice - bor n was passed as an initiate in the mysteries derive their sym bol ical signi ficance from this passage through the rock or mount of earth. It was the same with the hum an soul in the eschatology as it had been with the soul of the sun in the mythol ogy. Som etimes the hol e in the dol men or other stone that peopl e wriggl ed through was very small. This increased the difficulty, and was a practical illustration of the trials in the p assage of Amenta. There was one near the sum mit of a rocky mount ain island in Ireland called the “eye of the needle,” which is described as “a narrow ope ning like a chimney.” To unde rstand the custom we must read the Ritual. The sun - god made his passage t hrough the mount of earth, or the sphi nx, for his rebirth and resurrection on the eastern side, and the ope ning in the rock was at the end or at the sum mit, in the Tser hill, the rock of the hor izon. In the Russian märchen Prince Ivan= Horus the prince, cli mbs up the magical ladde r to get into the “great hous e” of the “tremendous ly high steep mount ain.” His sister=the princess, or luna r lady, calls to him from the balcony . “See, there is a chink in the enclosure. Touc h it with your little finge r and it will becom e a doo r!” This he doe s, and obt ains entrance into the mount ain of Amenta. (Ralston, Russian Folk - tales, 102. ) The cleft or ope ning in the mount was also termed the grotto. And it is pos sible that this survives in the “grotto” that is exhibited in En gland, and is made of oys ter - shells at the time when oys ters are suppos ed to be first ope ned on one particular day of the year. This illustrates an ancient custom but not a legal enactment respecting oys ters. The ope ning of the oys ter=the annua l ope ning of the earth in the equi nox. The grotto is an interior or shrine, and the light which is kindl ed within it poi nts rather to the sun than to the lamp in any Christian sanctuary. The day and the ceremony have been assigne d to St. James, but that is only one mo re item in the total system of falsification designa ted Christian. Osiris also had his shrine “which stande th in the centre of the earth.” (Rit., ch. 64, Renouf , and Book of Hades.) The unde r - world of the Karens of Burmah is the Egyptian Amenta. They also have the doubl e mount into which the sun enters at suns et (or in the equi nox ). The mount consists of two great strata of rock, one low er and one uppe r, which cont inua lly ope n and shut as with an uppe r and a low er jaw, but the 357 Karens have no idea how the uppe r stratum is supp orted. At their departure from earth the Manes are thus addr essed: “Thou goe st unt o Thama. Thou goe st through the crevices of"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"rocks. At the ope ning and shut ting of the western gates of rock, thou goe st in between. Thou goe st below the earth where the sun travels.” (Mason, “Karens,” Jour nal of the Asiatic Soc ., Benga l, pt. 2, pp. 233 - 4, 1865. ) The dead descend to Khu - the and appe ar before Thama the great judge in Hades, who may be identified with the Egypt ian Tum u or Atum , the great judge in the Kamite Amenta, who is the representative of the setting sun as Atum - Ra and of the rising sun as Atum - Horus (Nefer - Atum ). The difficulty of obt aining entrance to the mount was insupe rable to mortals. Hence the need of divine assistance. The su n - god as ope ner in the mythology led up to the god as ope ner for soul s in the eschatology. In this character Horus became the door and the way of life to the manes, who follow ed in his wake of glory through the dark of death. The principle subj ect of the i nscriptions written on the sarcopha gus of Seti I., now in the Soane Museum , is the noc turnal passage of the sun or the sun - god through the nether - earth by night , having the blessed on his right hand, the damned upon his left. There are twelve divisions to the passage, which correspond to the twelve hour s of the night . But the first of these divisions , that of entrance, is without a door , whereas the last of the twelve, that of exit, has a doubl e door . Here the entrance to Amenta cons ists of a blind door way or a doo r which neither mortal nor manes coul d know the secret of, and none but the god , primarily solar, coul d ope n. Hence the need of a deity as the ope ner, or a god who is the door and the way on grounds as tangi ble as thos e of the doo r in the mythol ogy of Amenta. (The Book of Hades, Records of the Past, vol . X, p. 81.) When the god com es to illum inate the valley of darkne ss the door s ope n one after the other and he enters with his follow ers — thos e who were equi pped or, as the legend of the Ten Virgins ha s it, whos e lamps were already trimmed. The door then closes, “and they who are left behind in their por ch cry out when they hear it shut .” Thus we attain a natural origin for the mythos , the eschatology, and the folk - tales told conc erning the hidde n door that was som etimes represented by a revol ving stone , and the secret password or “Open sesame!” that was com muni cated to the initiates in the mysteries. If prope rly equi ppe d, the Osiris is in pos session of the magical words of pow er that secure the ope ning of every gate, includi ng this hidde n entrance to Amenta. These words he carries in his hand, in death, as his papyr us roll; or, better still, he know s them by heart, and has made them truth in his ow n life and death. He exclaims, “I am accout red and equi pp ed with thy words of pow er, O Ra,” the god , that is, who says of himself, “I am he who closeth and he who ope neth, and I am but one ” (Rit., ch. 17, Renouf ). In the low er paradise was the land of gol d, not as metal, but as the glory of the sun by night . Th e sun god rising from this land that was yellow with gol d is thus addr essed, “Ador ation to thee, who arisest out of the gol den and givest light to the earth” (Rit., ch. 15, Renouf ). Still, mining for metals had com menced when Ptah and 358 his pygm y worke rs hol low ed out the unde r - world. Amenta was based upon the mine. It was the secret earth in which the treasures were conc ealed. These were gua rded by the dragon, but they were likewise know n to the dw arfs, the wee folk, the fairies, the Tuatha de Danan. Am enta was the land of precious metals and the furnace of the solar fire. Hence Ptah, the miner, became the blacksmith of the gods , the Kamite Vulcan. Som e missing details respecting the work of Ptah the metallurgist may be found in the Greek"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"rende ring of th is god as Hepha istos. Ptah, working in conc ert with the godde ss Maati, bui lt the great doubl e hall of Truth and Justice, which was gilded and glorified with his precious metal. Hepha istos is the architect of the hous e of the gods . As a proof that his place and work are in the nether earth, Hepha istos doe s not know what occurs unt il he learns it from the com ing sun. Follow ing the burial on earth, the deceased enters as a manes into Amenta, the land of the living. He seeks to get on boa rd the boa t of soul s. The priest says, “O ye seamen of Ra, at the closing of day let the Osiris live after death as Ra doe s daily.” Here the helmsman: “As Ra is bor n from yesterday, so he too is bor n from yesterday, and as every god exul ts in life so shall the Osiris exul t even as they exul t in life.” (Ch. 3, Renouf .) A subt erranean pleasaunc e ope ned to the eastward of the mount of earth called now , the earth of eternity. This is a paradise to which the manes look forward on their path of progr ess. It was the field in which the y had to till and grow the divine harvest as the food of the gods . For Aarru was apportione d on the small allotment system. Each one had a share of arable land to cultivate, and by the fruit was know n and judge d at the great harvest - hom e as a true worker o r a lazy one; and by their labour in this spirit - world Egypt ians earned their living for the life hereafter. The low er Aarru, the garden eastward in Amenta, is that earthly paradise of legenda ry lore in search of which so many heroes sailed. In the Erik Sa ga, Erik sets out in search of Odainsakr, a form of the Norse paradise, which is said to be encircled by a wall of fire. He enters a dark forest - land in which the stars are seen by day. A dragon bars his way across the river — the Apap of darkne ss in the val ley of darkne ss (Rit., ch. 7). He rushes into the mons ter’s mout h and passes through its body — a com mon way with the solar hero. Erik emerges with his com panions in the land of light, the low er paradise of the mythos . After awhile they com e to a tow er that is suspende d in the air withou t any visible suppor ts; access to it was obt ained by means of a ladde r that enabled the seekers to reach the top of the tow er, which had neither founda tions nor pillars. They had now attained Odainsakr, the earth of living men , the Egypt ian land of the living, but not the uppe r paradise, the place of spirits perfected, which is said to be so glorious that Odainsakr in com parison was but a desert. Erik’s is but the jour ney of the noc turnal sun or the annua l sun in the inferior h emisphe re represented in the primitive form of a passage through the nether - earth. The aim and end of the Osiris on the journey by water or by land is to reach the circum pol ar paradise and secure a place among the stars that never set, the glorious one s t hat “beacon from the abode s 359 where the eternals are.” The mount of earth was the poi nt of emergence in the mythol ogy . It was the place of birth for the sun upon the moun t to the east where the temple of Sebek - Horus stood. In the eschatology it was the place of rebirth for the soul s or manes who ascende d by the mount or by the tree of dawn to the sum mit from which they entered the bark of the sun to make the voya ge ove r the waters round to Manu in the region of the west.

The pass age from the mount or island of earth to the mount of the uppe r paradise across the water was already mappe d out in the time of Pepi I., as the follow ing extract from his pyr amid show s: “Hail thou who (at thy will) makest to pass ove r to the field Aarru th e soul that is right and true, or dos t make shipw reck of it (if wrong ). Pepi is right and true in respect of the island of the earth, whither he swimmeth and where he ariseth.” (Budge .) This is not very clear, but the island of the earth is the mount on t he eastern sum mit of which the manes joined the solar bark to make the voya ge from Mount Bakhu east to Mount Manu in the west on their way to the mount of glory at the nor th celestial pol e. Thus the pathw ay for the dead from this life to the uppe r paradise was laid dow n by the Egypt ians. It was they who tunne lled the mount of earth and hol low ed out Amenta with its places of pur gatory, its hells, its paradise of plenty in the Aarru meadow s; its means of ascent for the Manes by the mount or up the tree; its s olar bark and boa t of soul s that voya ged ove r the waters of the Nun from east to west; its steps or ladde r that was raised at the landi ng - place by night for the ascent to heaven in the uppe r Aarru paradise. This pathw ay of the dead is well - nigh uni versal i n mythol ogy, and it can be traced from beginni ng to end by means of the Egypt ian mythol ogy and the eschatology. Led by the jackal Anup as gui de through all the ways of darkne ss, and light ed by Taht, the luna r god, who carries in his hand the lamp of light and eye of Horus as the moon of Amenta shining through the night , we emerge at lengt h from unde rneath the uppe r earth. We are now out side the mount of earth, which stands upon a vast illimitable plain of the nether - world. We thus retain our foot hol d in the Nun where uppe r earth com es to an end. We follow the track of the sun and therefore issue on the eastern side of the mount ain, which the solar god ascends at sunr ise when seen by the dw ellers on the uppe r earth. Now we are facing the solar east and the ga rden eastward, which originated in the oasis of Inne r Africa. The Book of the Dead is primarily based on the Amenta and the journey through its unde r - world. The track of the all - conqu ering sun is follow ed by the soul of the deceased. He enters the mount i n the west by the opening in the rock, or at a later stage is carried on the boa t. He is accom panied by thos e who have gone before as gui des. He doe s battle with the adve rsary, and is victorious in the character of Horus. He ope ns all the paths and gates w ith his words of magic pow er and spells of might . He cleaves ope n the earth for 360 the resurrection. He is delivered from the devour ing demon who lurks invi sibly in the lake of fire and feeds upon the damned (ch. 17) .

The deceased has here attained the sum mit of the solar mount of glory on his way to the circum pol ar heaven and the stars that do not set. There is a voya ge now in heaven from east to west, and as the sun was lifted up to enter the maatit bark at dawn, so is it in the escha tologi cal rende ring. The soul s of the departed who were pure enough in the presence of the sun now entered the maatit bark to cont inue the voya ge round the moun tain to the region of Manu. They were now the westerners in anot her sense which was eschatologi c al. All day the manes make their voya ge in the solar bark, and com e at suns et to the land of the west about which the song was sung in the fune ral procession, “To the west! To the west!” At this landi ng - stage they leave the maatit for the sektit bark. The sun goe s dow n to Amenta in the west each night , but their sun sets no more. They have done with the moun t of earth in the mythol ogy, and com e to the mount belongi ng to the heavens. But there is a great gul f fixed between the mount of Amenta and the stellar mount of glory. This is the lake of darkne ss and the lair of the Apap - dragon. The voi d is spoke n of as the cavern of Putrata, where the dead fall into darkne ss. It is also called the voi d of Apap. In strict accordance with natural phe nom ena, the gul f or v oid of Putrata lay betwixt the place of suns et on the western side of the moun t of earth and the heaven of the setting stars. It is the prototype of the abys s or lake of out er darkne ss, the pit, in the Christian version of the legend; the great gul f that w as fixed betwixt thos e who remained in the low er Amenta and thos e who had attained the bos om of Ra, an Egypt ian expr ession for the boa t. On the other side of the water “Shu stande th erect, and the non - setting stars are instantly active in raising the ladde r” by which the sinki ng soul s or setting stars are saved from destruction in the lake of out er darkne ss. These steps are carried round from east to west for that pur pos e on boa rd the solar bark. (Vigne ttes to Ritual.) With the change of boa t anot her voya g e begins by night , along the great stream of the Milky Way. This is described as “that most cons picuous but inaccessible stream” when cont emplated from the earth. (Rit., ch. 98.) When the departed reach the starry shor e, the seven steps or ladde r for ascen ding the mount of heaven is now erected in the boa t. This ladde r, as Egypt ian, was doubl e in the time of King Pepi. It is called the ladde r of Sut for the ascent from 361 Amenta, and the ladde r of Horus for the ascent to heaven. A bark that can ascend th e stream awaits the voya gers. This picture of the bark that made its glorious journey upw ard to the circum pol ar paradise was obvi ous ly cons tellated as the Argo Navis, which is figur ed in the pos ition of ascendi ng backw ards on the white waters of the Milky Way. The cavern and gulf of Putrata no doubt existed when there was as yet no boa t or bride extant. Hence in various legends the manes have to spring from one side of the chasm to the other. The “jum ping - off place” for departed spirits is know n in several legends of the abor iginal races, and this was the rock on the western side of the mount . There is a stone at the west end of Upol u called “the leaping - stone ,” from which departed spirits in their cour se leaped into the sea, swam to Manono, sprang from anot her stone on that island, crossed to Savaii and went ove rland to the Faf ∼ , at Falealupo, as the western entrance to"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"their other world is called. (Turner, Sam oa, p. 257. ) With the Greeks, “to leap from the Leu cadian Rock” was a prove rbial equi valent for death. In the Khond representation, the soul s of the dead “have to jum p across the black unfathom able gul f to gain a foot ing on the slippe ry leaping rock, where Dinga Pennu , the judge of the dead, sits writing h is register of all men’s daily lives and actions .” The Guinea negroes tell of a divine judge whos e judgm ent seat was on the other side of the water that spirits crossed in death, analogous to the Egypt ian maat in the circum pol ar region. Thos e who had relig ious ly kept the laws of tabu were conduc ted into paradise, whereas thos e who had not were sunk headlong in the waters like the damned that went dow n headlong in the waters of Putrata. ( Bosman, Pinke rton, vol . XVI, p. 401; Rit., ch. 44. ) The soul s that asc ende d from the mount of Amenta by the Milky Way, the path of spirits, were hawk - headed like the Horus - soul , and with the Lithua nians this way of soul s was called the “road of birds,” along which the departed went like birds, or AS birds in the Kamite repre sentation, to the regions of eternal rest. As Egypt ian, this road was a great stream, because with them the water was their earliest way (ch. 86). Anot her Egypt ian name for the heaven as water is urnas or uranus . This we claim to be the Kamite original of the Greek uranus . Dr. Birch rende rs it in his dictiona ry “Urnas, Ouranos , the celestial water.” The Egypt ians did not persona lize it unde r that name; still, the urnas is the celestial water, and urnas=uranos . The okeanus that flow s around the world was nei ther a fabul ous sea nor a stream of water, but the firmament itself, that was figured as the celestial water surroundi ng the mount of earth. Through this ocean ran the great stream of the white water or the Milky Way. Thus we have the oke anos and the ocean stream of Hom er for the first time separately identified. Again, the water appe ared divided into two lakes at the head of the celestial river uni ted to form one stream in the Via Lactea. The system of the waters in the Bunda hish is identical with the Egyp tian. It is said that all the waters in heaven and earth had their origin in the heavenly mount of Ardvi Sura at the sum mit of Albor z upon which the red cow rested. There is but one sour ce and onl y place of discharge for all the rivers in the world. This w as the river of the Milky Way, which the Egypt ians figur ed as 362 descendi ng from the celestial lakes to be cont inue d in the lakes and in the Nile below . In China the Yellow River is looke d upon as a cont inuation of the Tien Ho, or Milky Way, the river o f heaven cont inue d as the river of earth (Mayers’ Manual , p. 98). The Osirian looki ng heavenw ard in death exclaims, “O very high mount ain! I hol d myself in thy enclosure” (Rit., 149, 14) . He also says, “A divine dom ain hath been cons tructed for me. I know the name of it; the name of it is the garden of Aarru.” (Rit., ch. 109, Renouf .) But the enclosure at the sum mit of the mount was not onl y figur ed as a paradise of plenty. It was a dw elling - place which had expa nde d to a city; the city of the blessed, the hol y city, the city of the great king, the heavenly city, the eternal city, that was the mode l of Memphi s and Annu, Thebes and Abydos , Eridu and Babyl on, Rom e, Jerusalem, and other sacred cities of the world. On appr oaching this, the Osirian says, “I stand erect in the bark which the god is piloting, at the head of Aarru, and the non - setting stars ope n to receive me, and my fellow - citizens present to me the sacred cakes with flesh” (ch. 98, Renouf ). In an earlier chapter he had said, “I arrive at my ow n"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"cit y” (ch. 17) . On the Stele of Beka the speaker says, “I reach the city of thos e who are in eternity.” That is the eternal city. When the Osiris has attained the land of eternity he says his future is in Annu. That is Annu as a celestial locality, Annu as th e eternal city, not Heliopol is in Egypt . (Rit., ch. 133. ) Annu , like Tattu, was a form of the celestial city at the pol e. An is a name of the mount and the colum n, the pole, and in Annu was the pillar, fortress, or rock of eternity. In one form the pol ar mount was called the white mount ain. It was Mont Blanc in heaven. The Koreans term it “mount everwhite.” As a hous e it was the white hous e. As a city it was the city of the white wall. As the seat it was the great white throne of the eternal. As a count ry it is the land of the silver sky. It is also know n as the mount ain of white limestone , the stone of Sut. The hous e cons tructed by Ptah was doubl e - storied, a hous e of the low er and uppe r paradise com bined in one . Finally, the heaven of astronom ical mythol og y was figur ed as the great hous e of Osiris. This include d all the previous formations : the circle of the Bear; the heaven of Sut and Horus, sout h and nor th; the triangul ar heaven of the ecliptic; the heaven bui lt on the squa re; the doubl e hous e of Amenta b elow the earth, and the eternal dwelling - place above , whence the hous e of Osiris at Abydos , called the mansion of Seb and Nu, or earth and heaven, was bui lt in two stories. ( Magi cal Texts, p. 6; Records, vol . VI, p. 118 .) “In the year 22 of the reign of Ki ng Aahm es, his majesty gave the order to ope n the rock - chambers anew, and to cut out thence the best white stone (limestone ) of the hill - count ry (called) Annu, for the hous es of the gods ,” includi ng the hous e of Ptah at Memphi s (Brugs ch, Egypt unde r the Ph araohs , Eng. trans. in one vol ., p. 130) . The mount ain of white limestone was an actual fact on earth to the Egypt ians. It was in a spur of the Arabian range which projected in a straight line tow ards the Nile as far as the village of Troiu, and cont ained an inexha ustible suppl y of the finest and whitest limestone . The Egypt ians had qua rried the white limestone mount ain from the earliest ages to obt ain materials 363 for their pyr amids. (Maspero, Daw n of Civilization, Eng. trans., p. 383. ) It furnished the limestone for bui lding the city of the white wall, which represented the celestial city on the sum mit of the mount in heaven. The name of Troiu, mode rn Turah, is sugge stive of the Greek city of Troy, which in its mythical aspect was anot her form of the ci ty on the mount . The deceased are lifted up in the white hou se or within the circle of the white wall by Sekhe t the lione ss - cons ort of Ptah (Rit., chs. 42 and 106) , which was an astronom ical founda tion that follow ed the heaven of the eight great gods . The Osiris says, “May Sekhe t the divine one lift me up, so that I may arise in heaven and deliver my behest in Memphi s” (Rit., ch. 26, Renouf ). With the Chinese Taoists the city on the sum mit of the mount is “the metropol is of pearl mount ain.” (Edki ns, Religio n in China, p. 151 , 2nd . ed.) This corresponds to the Kamite city of the white wall, the celestial Ha - Ptah - Ka. To the dw eller in Annu the eternal city was Annu on the sum mit of the celestial mount . To the dw eller in Thebes the eternal city was Thebes on hi gh. To the dw eller in Jerusalem the eternal city was Jerusalem above . Only onc e was there a munda ne original for the paradise or later city set in heaven at the pole. That is demons trably derived from the land, the river, the Annu , the Troy or Teriu of Egy pt. The Egypt ians set “the pattern in the mount ,” and from this the later bui lders of the sacred cities, the ark cities, on the"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"mount of heaven, derived the plan. The city of Troy on earth was a type of the eternal Troy upon the sum mit of the mount . Both c ity and name are demons trably Egypt ian, as Troy= Terui. Terui denot es the circum ference or enclosure, and this was a name of Sesennu, and cons eque ntly of Am - Khemen — the paradise of the eight , the enclosure on the mount of heaven which afterwards suppl ied a n ame for the city of Troy in Greece. The “Tale of Troy” is based on the dow nfall of the great city on the sum mit, which was the lofty dw elling - place of thos e whom we may term the peopl e of the pol e. The Greeks are solarites, with the sun - god Achilles as the ir leader. This fall occurred when the stellar representation was follow ed by the luni - solar mythos. The fall of Babyl on in the book of Revelation is anot her form of the tale of Troy; and bot h were representations of the one great original in the astronom i cal mythos . The Semites woul d have had no heaven on the sum mit of the mount to go to if the Egypt ians had not enclosed it and planted it, and show ed the way in their astronom y. They woul d have had no Sheol if the Egyp tians had not excavated the Amenta for the passage of the sun in their mythol ogy and for the soul s in the eschatology. And it is by means of the Egypt ian imagery that we shall be able to restore som ething of the lapsed sense to the Hebrew writings . Entrance into the eternal city was preceded b y baptism, with Anup , father of the inunda tion, as the baptiser and sprinkl er bot h in one . On approaching the two lakes the speaker says, “Lo, I com e that I may purify this soul of mine in the most high degree. Let me be pur ified in the lake of propi tiatio n and equi poi se. Let me plunge into the divine pool beneath the two divine sycamores of heaven and earth.” (Rit., ch. 97, Renouf .) This precedes the sacrament or eating of the sacrifice cons isting of bread, beer, and meat. He also 364 says, “Give me brea d and beer. Let me be made pure by the sacrificial joint, toge ther with the white bread,” that is, by partaking of the sacrament. (Rit., ch. 106, Renouf .) Heaven as a hous e had been founde d by Sesheta or Sefekh, a form of the old First Mother as co - worker with Taht in the luna r mythos. Atum - Ra was also a bui lder of the hous e in the solar mythos . His son Iu - em - hetep, the Egypt ian Solom on, was the builder or designe r of the temple to whom The Book of the Mode l of the Temple is ascribed (Düm ichen, Temple Insch riften, vol . I, pl. 97) . It was the temple in heaven that was bui lt without the sound of workm en’s tool s; “there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the hous e while it was bui lding” (I Kings VI. 7). This onl y appl ies to the mythical bu ilding, which was astronom ical, and which is still cont inued in esoteric Masonr y. When such langua ge is appl ied to bui lding on earth it has no direct meaning. The eternal city was preceded by the place of assembly. Before the time of bui lding on the mount there was a gathering - place unde r the tree that represented the roof of heaven. This was the Egypt ian maat or judgm ent seat when it cons isted of a stone beneath a tree. The seat of assembly, the seat of judgm ent on the sum mit of the mount , was cont inue d as a sacred tradition by races who never saw the pol e star of the nor thern heaven. The Australian blacks have no nor th pol e to look to for their paradise. It sank out of sight for them long ages since, when they were emigrants from the old world, nor have th ey replaced it with the sout hern pol e. But they still turn to a mount of the nor th as the gathering place for the soul s of the departed. The Tundi , a judi cial assembly of the tribe, is there — an equi valent in its way"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"for the Egypt ian maat. When an old Austr alian aborigine was dyi ng he poi nted upw ard and said, “My Tundi is up there!” (Taplin, Native Races of Sout h Australia, p. 36). The great pyr amid was bui lt as a replica of this eternal hom e. One name of this is khut , a word which doe s not merely signi fy “l ight ,” or the horizon. It was the mount of glory permanently fixed in stone ; a type of heaven perfected which include d all the mansions in the great hous e of Osiris. Earth being figured as a mount or island in the abys sal water, it seems proba ble that the island in the water mentioned by Herodot us (B. II, 127) , where they say “the body of Cheops is laid,” was imaged in the subt erranean chamber of the great pyr amid. And if so, it follow s that the pyr amid itself is a figur e of the mount that stood amidst the water of surroundi ng space. For example, the “Queen’s Chamber” is seven - sided, and therefore a figure of the Heptanomis. Of the “King’ s Chamber” Sandys says, “The stone s are so great that eight floor it, eight flag each end, and sixteen the sides.” It is t herefore a figur e of the luna r octona ry, or the heaven of Am - Khemen. The Amenta of Ptah was imaged below as the abys s or well of the nether world. The steps or pathw ay to heaven were figur ed in the passage looki ng upw ard to the pol e. In such monum ents the architecture of the heavens found its supr eme expr ession on the earth. He whom Herodot us calls “the priest of Vulcan” is obvious ly the deity Ptah. The Greek writer speaks of the temple of Vulcan at Memphi s (II, 153) , when he means the temple of Ptah. Thus the reign of the priest of Vulcan refers to the dyna sty 365 of Ptah. Herodot us says, “The Egypt ians having becom e free, after the reign of the priest of Vulcan – for they were at no time able to live without a king – established twelve kings , having divided all Egypt into twelve parts” (B. II, 147) . This was in the Egypt of the heavens. The divisions were zodi acal. The twelve kings are thos e that row ed the solar bark around the twelve signs now established in the circle of the ecliptic. “The twelve kings ,” co ntinue s Herodot us, “determined to leave in com mon a memorial of themselves, and having so determined, they bui lt a labyr inth, a little above the lake of Mœris.” This labyr inth “surpasses even the pyr amid.” It has twelve cour ts enclosed with walls, with doo rs oppos ite each other, six facing the nor th and six the sout h,” which points to a bui lding that represented the heaven of the twelve kings and twelve zodi acal signs , that is, the heaven of Atum - Ra the son of Ptah. The starry roof was taken, so to say, ind oor s, to glorify the temples of the gods , and was reprodu ced more or less as in the ceiling of Dende rah. This has been shallow ly described as Greek, because Greek artists were employe d in the workm anship when the chart was last repeated, “as it had been be fore,” according to the text. But the type s in this planisphere are Egyp tian, not Greek. To mention onl y a few: At the centre is the old first mother of all, the pregna nt hippopot amus, Apt or Khebt, with the jackal Ap - Uat, the gui de of ways in heaven; and the haunc h or leg of Nut the celestial cow . Anup and Tehut i are figured back to back on the equi noc tial colure; Shu and his sister Tefnut , back to back, cons titute the sign of Sagittarius.

T HE I RISH A MENTA Anyone who cares to becom e familiarly acqua inted with the Kamite mythol ogy and the s cenery of Amenta can have little difficulty in recogni zing the sour ce of the ancient British and Irish legenda ry lore. Arthur , who ow es his birth to what has been termed the shape - shifting of his father, is identical with Horus, who ow es his birth to the t ransformation of Osiris, his father. Finn the pos thum ous child, who is reared in the woods to becom e the avenge r of his father, is one with Horus bor n in the reeds to becom e the avenge r of Osiris. Gawain as the child “bor n to be king” is brought up in the forest to which his mother had fled for conc ealment, as Isis fled to hide herself and bring forth Horus the heir - appa rent in the marshes of Amenta. The battle of the brothers Sut and Horus is paralleled in the fight between Gawain and his brother Gareth. T he “loathly lady” who transforms from a reptile at Gawain’s kiss answers to the frog - headed Hekat, who represents the moon that change s into Sati at the sun - god’ s kiss. 366 In an Irish legend the heroes Diarmait and Finn Mac - Camail set out on a voya ge i n search of the men that had been carried off by a wizard chief or a giant called the Gruagach. The Gruagach is a Keltic ogr e, or giant, who disappe ars at dus k into the well. The fight is the same as the conflict long cont inue d betwixt Horus, lord of light , and the Apap - dragon of darkne ss in the land where the dead have “gone to the dragon. ” Also when the conf lict ceases for a time the beaten Gruagach sinks dow n into the well, just as Apap sinks into the gul f or voi d and is drow ned in the lake of darkne ss. (Joyc e, Old Celtic Rom anc es, “Pursuit of the Gilla Dacker,” ch. 4.) Assuredly the dragon of drough t survived as British in the dragon of Wantley, who is reput ed to have been “a formidabl e drinker.” He was slain by “More, of More Hall,” who hid himself in t he well of the unde r - world where the dragon came to drink. (Percy, Relics of Ancient Poetry. ) Entrance to Amenta was oppos ed by the giant lurking in the “gul f of Apap” (ch. 7). Immediately after entering the valley of darkne ss Horus, the solar conque ror in the mythol ogy or the soul that follow ed him in the eschatology, had to cont end with the black mons ter and pass through him one way or the other. The hero is depicted in the act of piercing the Apap’s head (Naville, Todt , vol . I, kap. 7, vigne tte). This mo nster of drought and darkne ss becom es the huge black giant in the legends which are related of Kynon and of Cuchul ain the victorious inva der of the black fellow ’s dom ain. The lady of the tree that stands in the pool of the persea - tree of life, who is Hath or in Egypt ian mythos and Nut in eschatology, is one with the lady of the fount ain in the Welsh Mabinoge i, who was won by Owen when he slew the black kni ght of the fount ain and performed the same deed as Horus who rescued Hathor from her devour er, the drag on of darkne ss, otherwise the black giant. Horus enters Amenta by the blind doo r of death and darkne ss as the deliverer of the manes who are held captive by the pow ers of evil, Apap the giant, Sut the black man, and their conf ederates. To effect the rescue he,"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"like Diarmait, goe s dow n to the “land beneath the billow ” in the low er parts of the Nun. This liberation of the captives in Amenta is com mon in the British legends . The Aarru - paradise is the land of prom ise in a lake - count ry. This lakeland is Lochlan of the Welsh version, “a mysterious count ry in the lochs” or waters beneath the earth. In this realm of faerie Finn and Diarmait found their lost friends all safe upon the island that was know n as the Prom ised Land, which is identical with the Land of Prom ise that was sought for by the Jews, and by all who ever set out for the terrestrial or sub - terrestrial paradise, which never was and never coul d be found out side the Egypt ian earth of eternity; and finally in the uppe r paradise or heaven of eternity on th e other side of the celestial water. There is also a num erical not e in the statement that thos e who succeed in snatching som e of the fruit from the tree of life in the unde r - world returned forthw ith to the typi cal age of thirty years, even though they had com pleted their hund redth year: and in the Egypt ian representation Amsu the victor of Amenta, the conque ror of the black fellow , is the Horus of thirty years, the divine hom me fait, that anoi nted son of god who is always thirty years of age. 367 When g oing ove r the ground previous ly the present writer was not sufficiently versed in the mysteries of Amenta, and Akar had not yielded up its secret treasures. Appl ication of the com parative method to the voya ges of Maeldui n and Bran will show that one of th e most satisfactory survivals of the Kamite wisdom is to be met with in the Irish mythol ogy and märchen. The voya ge of Horus and his com panions in the solar bark that makes a circle is repeated in the Imram or “row ing about ” of the Irish heroes and their a ssociates in the boa t, or of British Arthur with the seven in the ark. The voya ge of Maeldui n is unde rtaken by him in search of his father’s murderers. This is the obj ect of Horus or the deceased in the Egypt ian Ritual. They sailed toge ther ove r the waters to the west unt il they came to a cliff so steep and high it seemed to touc h the clouds . Diarmait unde rtook to climb the cliff and search for the missing men. He looke d inland and saw a love ly count ry. He sets out to walk across the plain; he sees a great tree laden with fruit. This is surrounde d by a stone enclosure, a circle of pillar - stone s, with a large round poo l of water clear as crystal in the midst which bubbl ed up at the centre and flow ed away to nou rish all the land. The story need not be follow ed any farther as a story, but now for the interpretation. The missing men who were spirited away denot e the manes. The way across the water to the west was the road of soul s along the solar track. The steep and very lofty cliff was the mount ain of Amenta, w hich is said to reach the sky. The love ly count ry or the plain was the field of Aarru in the Egypt ian low er paradise, with the enclosure that protected it from Apap; its well of water as the living sour ce of all suppl y; its tree of life that bore the unfor bidde n fruit, and other features of the mythos are all identifiably Egypt ian. In the ope ning of the Ritual (chs. 3 and 4) the hero enters the vessel of the Kamite Charon and addr esses the helmsman and sailors. He is in search of his father, Osiris, who ha s been murdered by Sut, and says: “I am the belove d son. I have com e to see my father, Osiris, to pierce the heart of Sut,” and to slay the cons pirators (Rit., ch. 9, Renouf ), Horus being, like Maeldui n, the avenge r of his father (Rit., chs. 1, 17, 92,"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Ren ouf ). Amenta is the land of life (ch. 15); the sun sets into the land of life; it is the land of the tree of life and the water of life, in which the dead becom e the living, resting in the land of life. The mount in the west is called Mount Ankhu, the moun tain of life. One name for the mount (otherwise the hor izon) in Egyptian is Sut or Set, or , the rock, hill, or mount , which agrees with the Irish Síd for the hillock and the mound of the uns een world. The mounds were made as dw ellings for the dead, a nd in the Irish legends the peopl e of the other earth, the Tuat ha de Danan, the wee folk and fairies, are dw ellers in a world that is represented by the hillock or mound. “’Tis a large Síd in which the Aes Síde dw ell,” therefore equi valent to the mount , an d their hol low in the mount is one with the Kamite Amenta. There is no cons cious ness of time in this happy other - world. Thos e who have dw elt there for centuries seem to have been there no time. This is one way of identifying the land with the earth of eter nity. The Irish 368 nether - world is the land of the ever - living one s; as an irresistible lure to men it is set forth as the land of ever - living, ever - love ly wom en. In the Egypt ian Ritual Anup, the jackal - god, the swift runne r, who as the earliest form o f Mercury preceded Taht - Hermes, is the gui de of ways in the astral mythol ogy and the conduc tor of soul s in the eschatology. Anup was not onl y the gui de through Amenta; he is also god of the pol e - star and therefore lord of the pol ar paradise, before he fell from heaven and his station was assigne d to Asar in the later solar cult. In our British and Irish mythol ogy, Mananna n, the son of Lir, is a form of Mercury. And in the legend of “Cormac and Faery” he is lord of the prom ised land. He also acts as gui de to Cormac, and says to him, “I am Mananna n, son of Lir, lord of the land of prom ise, and I brought you here that you might see the fashion of the land.” This is the gui de of ways, Ap - Uat, whom Cæsar calls the “patron of roads and jour neys,” who was worshippe d by the Gauls above all other gods . The great adve rsary of the solar god whom Horus went forth to slay is the Apap - serpent or dragon of darkne ss, a huge water reptile lying at the bottom of the abys s. We get a glimpse of this mons ter in the follow ing des cription. In the Tale of Laegaire the land of heart’s delight is described as being unde r the waters instead of across them, or in the hol low of the moun t. This, how ever, invol ves no discrepancy. The nether - world of Ptah - Tanen was below the waves. When the sun entered the mount it descende d into the hol low earth tow ard the bot tom of the mount , which stood on its ow n fixed base in the abys s or surroundi ng waters of the Nun. The title of Ptah - Tanen indi cates the land (ta) in the Nun or Nnu which engi rdled the earth out side. Thus the out er world was below the level of the waters at the same time that it was in the nethermost parts of the moun t of Amenta. This necessitated the rampart that was erected by the bui lder Ptah against the deluge and other incursions o f Apap the destroye r. The mythical water round about the earth is described with exqui site delicacy of touc h in the Voya ge of Maeldui n: “It seemed like a clear thin cloud, and it was so transparent, and appe ared so light , that they thought at first it woul d not bear up the weight of the curragh” (ch. 23, Joyc e). Looki ng dow n through this water of aerial tenui ty, they saw a beautiful count ry, and in one place “a singl e tree,” and on its branches “they beheld an animal fierce and terrible to look upon ,” and w hilst they looke d they saw the mons ter stretch forth his neck, and, darting his head"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"dow nw ard, he plunge d his fangs into the back of the largest ox of a whol e herd. This he lifted off the ground into the tree, where he “swallow ed him dow n in the twinkl ing of an eye.” When Maeldui n and his peopl e saw this from the boa t they were in fear lest they “shoul d not be able to cross the sea ove r the mons ter on account of the extreme mist - like thinne ss of the water; but after much difficulty and dange r they got acros s it safely” (ch. 23, Joyc e). This love ly count ry seen beneath the waters, the sunke n city of so many märchen, is the “beautiful Amenta” of the Ritual. The tree is the tree of life in Amenta, and the mons ter is the Apap - reptile. The ox as victim represents the bul l of Amenta, a title of Osiris. The herd here answers to the herd of cow s to which the bul l 369 is lord. There is also a man on gua rd at the tree with shield and spear and sword, who corresponds to Ra, the gua rdian who defends the persea tree (Ri t., ch. 17) against the devour ing mons ter Apap. The passage ove r the pellucid water with the mons ter lurking darkly dow n below is described in the Ritual. “O thou who sailest the ship of heaven ove r the gul f which is voi d, let me com e to see my father, Osi ris” (Rit., chs. 44 and 99). Horus and his com panions had to cross the abys s of Apap, and the insubs tantial element of the Irish version answers to the hol low voi d of the original. When the deceased is making his way through Amenta, Hathor the godde ss of love and love liness=the amorous que en, emerges from the tree and offers him a dish of the fruit which she has gathered to woo him with. By accepting this he is bound to remain the gue st of the godde ss and return no more to the world of the living, unl ess b y her permission. Hathor is identical with the amorous que en of the Keltic legends . Seventeen grow n - up girls attend on her and prepare her bath. These in the original mythos are the seven Hathor s, and it looks as if the seven had been change d to seventeen, which is a num ber otherwise unknow n to the original mythos . Hathor is the godde ss in the tree who furnishes the fruit on which the soul s are fed. The amorous que en gives the magical fruit from her appl e - tree to visitors from the hum an world. The que en of Love was called the Golden Hathor , and in the Tale of Teague the gracious que en is “draped in vesture of a gol den colour .” Hathor was the godde ss of music, and the appr oach of the amorous que en of faerie is announc ed by music magically sweet. Hathor was t he godde ss who drew men with the gol den cords of a love that was irresistible. This is naïvely rende red in the Irish märchen. When Maeldui n and his men have stayed for three mont hs with the amorous que en and enter their boat to sail away, she rides after t hem and “flings a clew” which the hero catches. It clings to his hand, and he is drawn back again to the que en by the magical clew that represents the cord of love . Hathor the que en of love is the provi der of food and drink for the manes in Amenta, who hav e, or who pray to have, whatsoever heart can wish. So the amorous queen provi des food and drink for the wande rers, which has every savour that each one may desire. Hathor was the godde ss of beauty, to whom the mafkat and other precious stones were sacred. The necklace was her typi cal ornament, the predecessor of the cestus of Venus . And it is not iceable that the treasure snatched at by the foster - brother of Maeldui n, which cost him his life, was the magical necklace that was in every sense irresistible. The low er paradise in which the tree of Hathor grow s is in Amen - Ta. Ta is the earth or land. Amen signi fies the secret or hidde n. May not this be represented by Emain the nom en regioni s in the voya ge of Bran?"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"From Emain com es the branch of the appl e - tree, or fruit - tree that may have been a fig - tree, which woul d correspond more closely to the sycamore - fig of Hathor . There is unl imited love - making in the land of the amorous que en, who is the Irish Aphrodi té. She is a direct survival from the time when the divin e female was the ruler of men and the obj ect of their kne eling ador ation. She is the que en of faerie, who was onc e the 370 que en of love . Hathor in the Ritual is especially the sove reign. The speaker says, “Let me eat unde r the sycamore of Hathor the sov ereign (ch. 52) , among thos e who rest there.” It is prom ised to the mortal who attains the elysium with the amorous que en that he shall enjoy the delight s of love “without labour .” Even in the Egyp tian Ritual the speaker pleads that he may have the inve sti ture of the garden, that he may be glorified there, eat and drink, and have his fill of sexua l intercour se. The text in the Nebseni papyr us reads nahap am , not mere love “in the abstract,” for nahap signi fies coition. This is in agreement with the unlimite d love - making in the land of wom en which was the primal paradise. The Kelt remains to - day a true child of the matriarchate that was pious ly transferred from earth to heaven. In this religion the mother with the child is the obj ect of supr eme desire, the re ligion that began as and still cont inue s to be uterine. This divine ideal has fired the imagination of the Kelt as whisky fires the blood and brain. It was this that ultimately made him so devout a Rom an Catholic with Mary for a por trait of the earlier amo rous fairy que en. The Keltic land of promise is a land in which deep - bos om ed, ever - living, glorious wom en dw ell and make it worth while for men to strive and reach that heaven in the land of heart’s desire. In the Ritual, ch. 17, the noc turnal sun is repr esented as a cat, the seer in the dark who keeps the watch by night in Amenta. The cat especially protects the tree of life and its food and drink from the assaults of the serpent Apap and the encroachm ents of thos e prow ling thieves the Sebau. The cat is s aid to “gove rn the Sebau, and regul ate that which they do. ” The tree, be it remembered, is Hathor ’s in the Ritual, and she is the que en of love who reappe ars in Irish legends as the amorous que en. Now in the voya ge of Maeldui n they com e to the “island of t he amorous que en.” They also com e to a fort which is encom passed by “a great white rampart” wherein there is not hing to be seen but a cat that keeps on leaping from one to anot her of “four stone pillars.” The fort itself is full of food and drink and shini ng raiment. As the voya gers are leaving, one of them tries to steal a necklace, whereupon the protecting cat “leaps through him like a fiery arrow , bur ns him up so that he becom es ashes,” and then the cat “goe s back to its pillar.” This description indi cat es the nature of the type . As in the Ritual, the cat represents the protecting solar god . The cat in Amenta is goi ng round the night - side of the solar circle. The four pillars were the suppor ts at the four corners called the four pillars of Shu. The solar god as watchful cat cons um es the thief (one of the Sebau) to ashes, and “goe s back to his pillar” or goe s on his way. It is the zoot ype s that tell the nature of the origins in sign - langua ge and identify them as Egypt ian. Two or three of these may be dw elt on for a mom ent. The cat as a protector of the “prope rty” in Amenta; the ancient bird that renews its yout h, not as the phœ nix of fire, but by bathing in the lake of the water of life; the seven cow s that give"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"their milk in sufficient abunda nce to feed th e whol e inha bitants of the land of prom ise; the Apap - mons ter, the yout hful solar hero, the mount of Amenta, and lastly the tree of life in the garden eastward of the mount . “When Maeldui n was on his 371 voya ge he came to an island on which there stood at the centre of it — a singl e appl e tree, very tall and slende r. Its branches were likewise slende r and exceeding long, so long that they grew up ove r the circular high hill and dow n to the sea that bounde d the island. ” (Joyc e, Celtic Rom anc es, “Voya ge of Mae ldui n,” ch. 8.) So long were the branches that for three days and night s, whilst the ship was coasting the island, Maeldui n held a branch all the time, letting it slide through his finge rs, till, on the third day, he came to a cluster of appl es at the very end. This was the fruit of the tree of life. Alfred Nutt remarks on the gigantic stature of the peopl e who are met with by Finn and his men in the land of marvels, but does not think the trait has any traditiona l signi ficance (Bebind Story). But the gian ts of the prom ised land are identical with thos e in the Hebrew märchen, and the prototype s of bot h are to be found in the Kamite mythos . One origin will account for all. There are two classes of giants in the Ritual, the glorified and the wretched giant sh ades. The glorified one s are thos e who reap the fields of divine harvest in the low er Aarru and in presence of the pow ers of the east. These are said to be each nine cubi ts in height , i.e., fifteen or sixteen feet. The giants of the fore - world were not mag nified men, but representatives of the elemental pow ers, like the gigantic Apap of darkne ss, the hippopot amus of Sut, the crocodi le of Horus, the giant ape of Hapi, the lion of Shu, in the pre - anthropom orphi c pha se. This was the race of giants that precede d the pygm ies of Ptah in the Egypt ian mythol ogy. So in the Irish legends the Brobdi ngna gian race of the Fena, the might y heroes of enor mous stature, passed away and were follow ed by the little men who were Lilliput ians in com parison; there are also dw arfs as denizens of the land beneath the waters. (Joyc e, Old Celtic Rom anc es, “The Last of the Fena.”) Africa, the hom e of the pyg mies, is presum ably the birthpl ace of the dw arf races now represented by the diminut ive wee folk of the Dark Cont inent. The earlie st emigrants who made their way out of that land and wande red ove r Europe woul d be akin to these in stature, like the Lapps who follow them at a shor t distance. These were the wee folk in hum an form. But there is anot her factor to be taken into account bef ore we can ascertain the origin of the wee folk as spirits in a tiny fairy shape. These do not simply represent the pygm y race of hum an beings , but are the same primitive peopl e translated into spirit - world, from the time when the race was of the pygm y sta ture. We gather from the secret wisdom that the earliest beings who entered the nether earth were dw arfs or dw arfish peopl e. The god Ptah, who ope ned the unde r - world by tunne lling the mount of Amenta, is himself a dw arf. The seven Knemmu that assisted him were pygm ies. First com e the African pygm ies. Second, the mythical pygm ies of Ptah. Third, the hum an soul s that are the same in stature. Fourth, the wee folk of the legends , who inha bit the mounds , who work the mines, who dw ell beneath the sea, the natural , the mythical, and spiritualistic dw arfs being som ewhat mixed up toge ther. The märchen or folk - tales of the Asiatic and Europe an races are the débris of Egypt ian mythos . Fairyland is no conc eption of the Kelt, nor original produc t of the Aryan imagination ; it is the Kam ite earth of eternity in the low er world of the mount of earth"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":" 372 which was excavated by the pygm ies of the ope ner Ptah. From no other land or literature than the Egypt ian can we expl ain the wee folk in the fairy mound or Síd. (Síd, prono unc ed shee. cf. the Egypt ian she or shu, for the hol low , the voi d, and sheta, the sarcopha gus .) Various episode s of the passage through the nether earth and ove r the waters to the uppe r paradise that were represented in the drama of the mysteries and deta iled in the mythos have been reduc ed to mere allusions in the Ritual. For example, there is a land of weeping, a dw elling - place of the god Rem - Rem, or Remi the Weeper. (Rit., ch. 75, and Litany of Ra, line 21. ) The manes on his way to Annu says, “I have co me out of the Tuat. I am com e from the ends of the earth. I pass through the nobl e dw ellings of thos e who are coffined. I ope n the dw elling of Rem - Rem, that is the place of weeping. (Rit., ch.75, Renouf .) In the Irish legenda ry “Yarn” the voya gers com e to the Island of Weeping. This island is large and “full of hum an weeping. Whos oever lands in this place falls a - weeping. ” This lot happe ns to one of Maeldui n’s foster - brothers and others of the wande rers who are sent to bring him off. The coffined one s in th e Ritual, chief of whom was Osiris in his coffin, offer a raison d’être for the weeping in Rem - Rem (as a place). In their thirty - first adve nture Maeldui n and his com panions com e to an island of which it is said, “Around the island was a fiery rampart, and it was wont ever to turn around and about it.” This was evidently the revol ving sphe re. “Now , in the side of that rampart was an ope n door , and as it came opp osite them in its turning cour se, they beheld through it the island and all therein, and its indw ellers, even hum an beings , beautiful, num erous , wearing garments richly dight, and feasting with gol den vessels in their hands . The wande rers heard their ale - music, and for long did they gaze upon the marvel, delight ful as it seemed to them.” This is a gli mpse of the pleasant plain, the prom ised land, the land of heart’s delight and ever - living wom en, with their lure of love — in shor t, the Aarru - paradise. There was a protecting rampart reared around this garden, the low er paradise in the earth of eternity. “ A divine dom ain hath been cons tructed for me; the name of it is the garden of Aarru. I know the garden of Aarru; the wall of it is steel” or the bright shining ba - metal. (Rit., ch. 109 .) Inside the rampart were the glorified one s, “each of whom is nine cub its in height .” Also the manes were there as workers in the hum an form, who cultivated each their field of corn and fed upon the food and drank the beer that were made from it and divinized as sustenance for soul s. The twofold paradise, terrestrial and ce lestial, is also extant in Irish legenda ry lore. Not as an Irish conc eption, pagan or Christian, not as a “vision of the great young godl and - haunt ed Irish imagination, ” but as a survival from the Kamite sour ce that onc e suppl ied the world with a system of representation, mythical and eschatologi cal, which remains almost intact as Egyptian, whilst it has gone to wreck and sea - drift elsewhere on other shor es. The typi cal mount of earth with its hol low of the unde r - world has its representative in the Irish mou nd of the Síd, and the elysium across the sea is one with the paradise of Hetep ove r the celestial water. 373"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":" Alfred Nutt poi nts out the difference betwixt the Irish paradise in the hol low hill and their paradise that is ove r - sea. “In the hol low hill ty pe (The Wooi ng of Etain) the wonde rland is not figur ed as lying across the sea, but rather . . . . within the Síd or fairy hills. No special insistence is laid upon the immortality of its inha bitants,” nor is there any por tion of this land in which the amo rous wom en dw ell alone , as in the elysium ove r sea. (Nutt, The Voyage of Bran. The Happy Otherworld, ch. 9.) This is exactly as it woul d be if derived from the Kamite original. The low er paradise of two is in the mount of earth, also called the fune ral mou nt of Amenta. The departed are not born immortals in that land; immortality is condi tiona l. They have to fight and strive and wrestle with the pow ers of evil to com pass it. These, like the Irish manes dw elling in the Síd or hol low hill, were the “folk of t he godde ss,” who was Hathor in the mount ; whereas the spirits made perfect in the uppe r paradise are more expr essly children of the supr eme god , who was Horus, or Ra, or Osiris, according to the cult. We can trace the voya gers on the water way to this uppe r par adi se. When Horus, or Ra, and his com panions have conque red Apap, the Sebau, and other mons trous proge ny of darkne ss, the solar bark emerges from the unde r - world upon the hor izon of the orient heaven, and enters the water of dawn which is designa ted t he “lake of emerald.” The speaker says, “O ye gods in your divine cycles who travel round the lake of emerald, com e and defend the great one who is in the shrine from which all the divine cycle proceedeth” — that is, the god on boa rd the solar bark. So in th e voya ge of Maeldui n, after passing the islands of mons trous animals, the giants and devour ers, the com panions com e to a sea of green crystal sparkling in the sunl ight , and so transparent that they coul d see the sand qui te clearly at the bot tom . In this wa ter they saw neither mons ters nor any ugl y animals. In like manne r the crystal water is described in the Ritual as having neither fishes nor snakes in it. (Rit., ch. 110; Voyage of Maeldui n, ch. 22, Joyc e.) The “Isle of Truth” is a name of the divine land across the waters, “Whos oever set foot on it was una ble to tell a lie.” A naif way of indi cating its truth - com pelling influence. Surely this must be the Egyptian Maat, the land of truth. In starting on his voya ge ove r sea it is the desire of the speaker t o “attain the region of Maat” (Rit., ch. 1), which may be the region of truth, law, or right eous ness. The celestial bridge betwixt the two is described in the Voyage of Maeldui n as a bridge of crystal leading to a palace (ch. 18, Joyc e). It also appe ars in the form of a solid arch of water which spans the elysian island from side to side. Unde r this the travellers walked without ever getting wet. (ch. 25, Joyc e.) This in heaven is the archw ay of the galaxy that was represented as the river ove rhead. It is r elated that when the voya gers came at last in sight of land it was a little island with a large palace on it. Around the palace was a wall white all ove r without stain or flaw, as if it had been carved out of one unbroke n rock of chalk, and it was so lofty that it seemed almost to reach the clouds . “A num ber of fine hous es, all snow y white, were range d round the inside, enclosing a level cour t in the middle on which all the hous es ope ned.” (Joyc e, Old Celtic Rom anc es, pp. 131 - 133 .) This in the Egypt ian is t he city of the white wall of the 374 "},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"celestial Memphi s that was seen in the nor thern heaven at the sum mit of the mount . The Osiris looki ng up to this, his jour ney’s end, exclaims “May Sekhe t the divine one (cons ort of Ptah) uplift me so that I may arise in heaven and issue my behests in Memphi s, the city of the white wall.” (Rit., ch. 26.) The mount or rock of Anup, also called his cliff (Rit., ch. 31) , survives as the rock or fortress of Mananna n in the land of promise. One title of the Irish mount is “ the hill of two wheels in the pleasant plain of the Land of Prom ise.” ( Clidna Dinns henchas , Nutt, Voyage of Bran, p. 197 .) This prom ises to shed light on a crux in the Ritual. In the description of the mount and the two por tions of Sut and Horus the sign  is employe d ambiguous ly. (See Book of the Dead, Renouf , pp. 193 - 199 .) But if the halves of night and day were figur ed as two cycles or circles of time the reading woul d be perfected, and the mount of Hetep woul d also be t he hill of two wheels in the pleasant plain. It is said in the Rig - Veda (ch. 3, p. 6), “the two ador able Krishna s successively revol ve.” It is also said, “the dark day and the light day revol ve alternate.” The table - land which is called the plain of joy, t he great plain, is one with Hetep, the table of the mount , in the Kamite paradise. The bathing on the great table - land in the island of the amorous que en is particularly noticeable. All who reach that sum mit bathe. Cormac was bathed, “though there were non e to bathe him.” This answers to the place of final baptism in the lake of propitiation and of equi poise, where soul s are pur ified “in the most high degree” (Rit., ch. 97) . The tree of food in the midst of the garden of Hetep grow s the fruit on which the g ods and the assembled multitude of the manes feed and live. This, as aforementione d, is repeated in the Tale of Teigue as a “thickly - spreading appl e - tree bearing fruit and ripe blossom alike.” This tree is to “serve the congr egation that is to be in the ma nsion. ” It also bore a fruit for the gods and spirits. Beer is the divine drink of the beatified, not onl y in Amenta, but also in the uppe r paradise. Osiris in the mythical Memphi s, Hat - Ptah - Ka, says “O thou God of nut riment, O Great One who presidest ove r the mansions on high, give me bread and beer” (Rit., ch. 106 ). And beer was suppl ied in ove rflow ing abunda nce. In the Wooi ng of Etain, Mider the love r sings of beer as the divine drink in the earthly paradise. “Heady to you the ale of Erin, but headier is the ale of the Green Land. ” “When thou com est, Wom an, to my strong folk, fresh swine’s flesh and beer shall be given thee by me, O white - skinned Wom an.” It is also said of this wonde rland, “When it rains, ’tis beer that falls.” Now , the beer that rained i n the Irish paradise is identical with that which came dow n from the Egypt ian heaven. Notwithstandi ng the difference betwixt the num ber of attenda nts on the amorous que en and the num ber of Hathor s, the seven have been correctly preserved in their primitiv e shape and character as the seven cow s in the Irish paradise, the same as in the meadow s of the Egypt ian Aarru. In the adve ntures of Cormac in Faëry, the old wife tells the true tale of her seven cow s, the milk of which is plentiful enough to suppl y all t he inha bitants of the land of promise with nut riment. These are the cow s of the Elysian Fields in the Ritual who are called the seven cow s, provi ders of plenty. They are por - 375 trayed along with the bul l who is personi fied as the hero in the folktales ( Papy rus of Ani., pl. 35; Rit., ch. 148) , and are invoke d by the spirit of the Osiris to give him food and drink and sustenance for ever. Thus the “Irish version of the happy otherworld” becom es"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"a dim - eyed memory of the old Egypt ian astronom ical mythol ogy and eschatology. And as it is in Ireland so was it in Babyl oni a, Indi a, China, Greece, Britain, and other lands that were light ed by the rays of Egypt ’s wisdom that went dow n as the suns et of an ancient world, and rose again unrecogni zed by name as dayspri ng of the new. And thus the nearness to nature in its tende rest traits, the nobility of manne rs, the serene placidity, to be found in the Welsh and Irish fragm ents of the antique lore, were not necessarily native to the soil, but may have belonge d to the h igher civilization that was elsewhere develope d, as now we know it to have flourished in the valley of the Nile. Neither was the painted Pict or woad - stained Briton the sour ce of all this gentilesse and chivalry impor ted in the mythos and replanted in the islands by the “men of peace.” Such characters as Arthur and his twelve kni ght s were not the produc ts of men who dw elt in caves and wore the skins of animals. His mother Arth was godde ss of the Great Bear — she who was Ta - Urt, the oldest form of the Great Mo ther in the astronom ical mythol ogy of Egypt . And as the characters were impor ted in the mythol ogy, so likewise were the traits of character, and therefore these woul d not be indi genous to the islands of the north. T HE U PPER M OUNT OF G LORY . Whatsoever s hape was taken by the eternal dw elling - place on high, it was onl y attainable at the sum mit of the mount that reached up to the never - setting stars. And there is a cons ensus of widely - scattered evidence to show that the paradise of peace and plenty, of reun ion and rejoicing, which is the obj ect in view of “the Osiris” all through his jour ney out lined in the Ritual, is the uppe r paradise of a legend that is universal, the origin of which can be discove red in the astronom ical mythol ogy of Egyp t. The general tr adition is that this paradise was a primæval place of birth, and that it was in the nor th, upon the sum mit of a mount now inaccessible to the living anyw here on earth. This circum pol ar paradise is know n to the oldest races in the world as an initial starti ng - poi nt for gods and men. We have sought to trace an origin for the primitive paradise of this uni versal legend to the hum an birthpl ace on the mount of earth, or Apta, with the beginni ng in the time and the dom ain of Sut, which was com memorated as a secr et of the Sphi nx. This place of birth, as we sugge st, was thus repeated as a place of rebirth by the Egypt ian mystery - teachers in the astronom ical mythol ogy, from which the uni versal legend spread around the world. The Namoi, Barwan, and other tribes on t he Darling River, in Australia, poi nt out a paradise up the Milky Way to which the spirits of the right eous are welcom ed by Baiame, who corresponds to the Kamite god of the pol ar paradise. He is called “the great master” 376 and is the maker. It is he wh o sends the rain; and it was he who initiated the black - fellow s into their mysteries (Brough Smyth, vol . II, p. 285) . The abor igines of New Holland describe the dw elling - place of “Baym a” as a paradise to the nor th - east in a beautiful heaven. His throne is a crystal mount ain of vast magni tude , the base of which is fixed in"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"the great water, and its stupe ndous sum mit rises to the stars. In addi tion to this uppe r paradise upon the mount they also have an earthly paradise below . Moodge egally, the first man, who lives in this nether paradise, is alone immortal; the same as hum an Horus in the low er paradise of Amenta. He has the pow er and privilege of visiting the uppe r heaven of Ballima, which is a three days jour ney from the happy land below . He climbs up to the heaven nor th - east by a lofty and precipitous mount ain cove red with beautiful trees. His ascent on foot is made easier by a path windi ng round the mount ain which he ascends . A ladde r or flight of steps erected at top of this mount ain, leads up to heaven its elf. Ballima, where the sun shines by night beneath our earth, is the Egyp tian Hades. The exceeding high moun tain is the mount of Amenta, and the great water out of which it rises with the steps up to heaven is the Egypt ian Nun. But neither the aborigines of New Holland, nor the missiona ries, nor Mr. Manni ng knew anyt hing of the Egyp tian Book of the Dead, or of the Nun, or the moun t of Amenta, or the Aarru - fields, the doub le paradise, or the steps that led up to the solar boa t. Yet these and other features of the Kamite mythos are all identifiable in the version here recove red from the abor igines of New Holland. (Notes on the Abor igines of New Holland made by James Manni ng in 1844 - 5. Copy presented by the author.) The mount of the gods and the glorified is com mon in Africa, where, as we hol d, the founda tions of Egyptian mythol ogy were laid; and there, as in other lands , it is a poi nt of departure in the beginni ng for the race. Duff Macdona ld says of the Yao tribes: “Som e distinctly localize Mtanga as the god of Mangoc hi, the great hill that the Yao peopl e left. I regret much that I did not see this hill before leaving Africa, as I have heard so much of it. To these peopl e it is all that the many - ridge d Olympus was to the Greek. The voi ce of Mtanga , som e hol d, is still audible on Mangoc hi. Others say that Mtanga never was a man, and that Mtanga is anot her word for Mulungu (god or spirit). He was conc erned in the first introduc tion of men into the world, and he is intimately associated with a year of plenty.” Th us we find the main features of the mythical mount extant in Inne r Africa, which culminated in Mount Hetep as Egypt ian. It is the seat of the gods and the glorified. It is the primæval birthplace. It is the land of prom ise, of peace and rest, of water and eternal plenty, the scene of the Golden Age. It is the primitive paradise of the abor igines ( Africana, I, 71). The god whos e seat or station was the pol e is the pow er that gives the water of heaven to our world. Anup in Egypt is the master of the inunda tio n (Rit., ch. 97). The pol e was imaged by the mount , the cone , the round hillock, the artificial mound. Now the Gold Coast Africans worship a deity or nature - pow er named Bobow issi, whos e seat or stool is the coni cal hill near Winne bah know n as the Devil’s H ill, a title given by the Portugue se. He is the maker and sende r of rain, which 377 descends in a devastating deluge when he is provo ked to ange r by thos e who break his law. Bobow issi also appoi nts the local deities, even as Anup assigne d their places to the seven on the ope ning day of creation in the Egypt ian solar mythos (Rit., ch. 17; Ellis, The Tshi - speaking Peopl e, p. 22). The heaven of the western Inoi ts, in which good spirits dw ell, is a paradise above the firmament. This revol ves about a mount ain of prodi gious magni tude and majesty, a Meru that is situated in the remotest part of the pol ar regions . Here, as in the"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Egypt ian circum pol ar paradise, the spirits whos e inna te excellence has been prove d by an extraordinary activity for good go to mingl e w ith the never - setting stars. Various other features of this heaven are Egypt ian. Mount Hetep as the land that is blest with water and the breezes of the north is an African, but not an Esqui maux, ideal. The god , as Num , is the breath of thos e who are in th e firmament. The Inoi t supr eme being Tornga rsuk, the Great Spirit, is the “lord of the breezes.” Still more remarkable is the fact that the soul s of the Inoi t are drawn from an atmosphe ric reservoir of soul , to which in death the spirits of the just return . This is identical with the Egypt ian lake of Sa, one of the two lakes in the pol ar paradise, which is the sour ce of spirit - life and of life to the gods and the glorified. They also have the earthly and celestial paradise, one at the root of the mount , the other at the sum mit; the same as the Egypt ian Aarru in Amenta below , and Aarru in the pol ar paradise of the northern heaven (Réclus, Primitive Folk, Eng. trans., p. 106 ). This uppe r world of the Esqui maux, says Dr. Rink, may be considered identical with t he mount ain about the sum mit of which the vaulted sky for ever circled round . This is the celestial mount ain as a figure of the pol e. It was their moun t of glory light ed with the aurora bor ealis. The Egypt ian Ta - Nuter or divine land of the gods is usually described as being in the Orient. But there was also a Ta - Nuter Meh - ti, which is rende red by Brugs ch, “das nör dliche Gottesland” (Brugs ch, Astron. and Astrol. Inscript., p. 179) . This was the land of the gods in the nor th — that is, the pol ar paradise in he aven, not an elevated part of our earth. The breeze of the nor th was the breath of life to the Egypt ians. It is synonym ous with blessedne ss. The paradise of Hetep is the garden blessed with breezes. The breeze of the north, how ever, woul d not represent hea ven to the dw ellers in the nor thern qua rter of the world. But the paradise was figur ed in the nor th originally, and there it remained in every land to which the wisdom of Old Egyp t went. This will expl ain the paradise of Airyana Vaêjô described in the Aves ta. Ahur a - Mazda tells Zarathus tra that he has created a delectable spot which was previous ly una ppr oachable or now here habitable. But in this first of regions and best of count ries there was winter dur ing ten mont hs of the year. “Ten mont hs of winter are t here, two of sum mer, and these (latter) are cold as to water, cold as to earth, cold as to plants; then as the snow falls around there is the direst disaster” (Vendi dad, Fargard I). The goo d god made the good creation, and Angr o - Mainyus , the dark and deadl y, is said to have formed a might y serpent and brought on the frost that was created by the Dævas, who correspond to the Sebau in the Ritual as agents of evil in phys ical phe nom ena. It is also said in 378 the Minokhi rd (p. 322 , ff.) the Dev of winter is most vehement in Airyana Vaêjô. Which doe s not mean that the primal paradise was created at the northern pol e of the earth, to be ove rtaken by the glacial period. The true interpretation is that the legenda ry paradise was astronom ical, and that it was an e nclosure at the north celestial pol e, and not in the nor thern regions of the earth. In the Vendi dad version it has been made geogr aphi cal and rende red according to climate in som e nor thern region of the earth; the evils of a winter world being then attribu ted to the devil, or the opp osition of the black mind, Angr o - Mainyus .

The Chinese paradise, like the Egypt ian, is at the nor th pol e, the apex of the celestial mount . The sum mit is the seat of the gods . Heaven divided into the ten region s of space is identical with the Kamite heaven at the sum mit of Mount Hetep, that was divided into ten divine dom ains (Rit., ch. 110) which follow ed the celestial Heptanom is and the enclosure of Am - Khemen, and preceded the zodi ac with twelve signs . In no c ount ry is the mount of the nor th more sacred than in China. For thous ands of years the Chinese emperors have ascende d the hol y mount ain T’ai to offer sacrifice to heaven. This mount is designa ted “Lord of the World.” To the nor th there is not hing but hills upon hills. It has 6,000 steps of hewn stone , each fifteen feet in lengt h, leading upw ard like a staircase to the skies, exactly the same as the throne of Osiris, who “sits at the head of the staircase.” The pol e - star determined the one visible fixed cen tre of the starry uni verse, and the name of the Ainu as Ai - no - Ko is said to signi fy the “offspring of the centre.” That centre was the circum polar paradise. The Japanese god of the pole - star, Ame - no - mi - naka - nus hi - no - Kami, is likewise “the lord of the centr e of heaven.” The tradition of the Ainu is that they came from the nor thern sum mit of the world. So high and inaccessible are thos e lofty tablelands that non e of the living can attain them now . But the ancestral spirits go back to them after death. This, o f cour se, identifies the circum pol ar paradise of all the legends that had but one and the same origin — in the astronom ical mythol ogy. The region is identified still further by the bears. The ancestors of the Ainu are said to have married the bears of the mo unt ains in this high hom eland of the nor th (Griffis, The Mikado ’s Empire, pp. 27 - 29). We have the bears to - day, seven in the lesser and seven in the larger cons tellation, still revol ving round the stellar mount of glory. The Koreans pos sess the same tradi tion of the hum an birthpl ace in the circum pol ar paradise. Their first man, as ruler of Korea, 379 descende d from the great white mount ain Tê Pek San. This also was the poi nt of migration or beginni ng for the race, as it is in various other versions of th e primeval tradition (Low ell, Percival, Choi son, p. 209 ). The Badagas say that in the nor th arises Mount Kaylasa, their Meru. In the nor th infinity opens on the kingdom of the shades. If four men be dispatched to the four cardinal points, three will return , but never will he who has walked beneath the rays of the pol ar star. He makes the ascent of the north, which is not a qua rter, but the sum mit to a moun tain, as in Egypt . All that is great and pow erful com es from the nor th. The mother of the cow - godde sses dw elt on the Amnor, and the ancestors of the Badagas follow ed the cow . They came from the paradise of the nor th. Between the invi sible mount ains of Kaylasa and Kanagiri flow s the dread river that divides the world of the living from the world of the dead. That is the celestial water, the"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"river of soul s, which runs betwixt Mount Manu and Mount Hetep on the Egypt ian map of heaven. This is not the north of the geogr aphe rs. At the top of Mount Kaylasa is the palace of soul s, the hom e of the blessed, in which t heir efforts are crow ned with final success. This palace of soul s answers to the roya l palace referred to in the Ritual, where the speaker says, “I have made my way into the royal palace, and it was the bird - fly (or Abait) who brought me hither” (Rit., ch. 76, Renouf ). Mont ezum a the elder, in repeating an ancient tradition to Cortez, said, “Our fathers dw elt in that happy and prosperous place which they called Atzlan (a word that signi fies whiteness). In this place there is a great mount ain in the middl e o f the water which is called Culhua can, because it has the peak turned som ewhat ove r tow ard the bot tom ; and for this cause it is called Culhua can, which means ‘crooke d mount ain.’” The rest of the description of this delight ful count ry show s that it was the circum pol ar paradise upon the sum mit of the mount . And when it is identified with the moun t of Hetep we may surmise that it became the moun tain with its apex leaning ove r because it imaged the pol e; so that when the pol e - star change d, the bent pos ture of t he sum mit woul d becom e the curved figur e by which Culhua can was por trayed. In an Assyrian prayer this celestial mount is called the silver mountain. It is said, “Grant ye to the king, my lord, who has given such gifts to his gods , that he may attain to gre y hairs and old age! And after the life of these days, in the feasts of the silver mount ain (at the white sum mit of the pol e), the heavenly cour ts, the abod e of blessedne ss; and in the light of the happy fields may he dw ell and live a life eternal, in the presence of the gods ” ( Records, vol . III, pp. 133 - 4). Gwynnw esi, the blissful white abode of the Welsh, is anot her form of the paradise on the sum mit of the celestial mount in the nor th, which answers to the white mount ain of the Koreans, the city of the w hite wall, the peak of pearl, and the Assyrian land of the silver sky. Anot her form is Gwasgw yn, the white mansion, which is the happy abode of the beatified dead. The imagery survives in the legends of Merlin, where we meet with the glass hous e, the bow er of crystal; the tow er without any wall, or without any “closure”; the transparent prison that was aerial as “a smoke of mist in the air.” Also the typi cal tree appe ars as a noble whitethor n, all in bloom — a figur e, as we take it, of the starry pol e. 380 When Merlin died he is said to have taken with him the thirteen treasures of Britain, as he passed into the hous e of glass (Guest, Mab. , II, p. 354) . The ancient British Avalon was represented as an island in the north on which the “Loadstone Castle” stood . This identifies the island with the celestial mount and the magne tic pol e of the north. Anot her local figur e of the same signi ficance is the Mont e Calamitico, a magne tic mount ain in the sea to the nor th of Greenland (Hum bol dt, Cosmos, vol . II, p. 659, Bo hn’ s Ed.) In the Apoc alyps e of Zosimas the Hermit there is a description of the paradise in which the blessed dw ell. The seer was conve yed across the water that divides our earth from heaven by means of two trees which bent dow n and lifted him ove r in thei r arms (James, The Revelation of Peter, p. 69) . The two trees are Egyp tian, but as usual in Christian doc um ents, the miracle has been adde d. “Lo, I come,” says the seer in the Ritual. “Let me plunge into the divine pool beneath the two divine sycamores of heaven and earth,” when"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"he is about to ascend that “most cons picuous but inaccessible stream,” the Milky Way (chs. 97, 98) . One ideogr aph of Hetep, the mount of glory, is a table heaped with provi sions as the sign of plenty. In the mythical rende ring it i s a table - mount ain. This will expl ain the round table of King Arthur and that table of the sun which was said to exist among the Ethiopi ans as described by Herodot us. “There is a meadow in the subur bs,” he says, furnished with the cooke d flesh of all sorts of qua drupe ds. It is filled with meat at night , “and in the day time whos oever choos es com es and feasts upon it. The inha bitants say that the earth itself from time to time produc es these things .” Such is the description given of what is called the table of the sun. (Book III, 17, 18.) This table of the sun is referred to in the Ritual (rubr ic to chs. 1 and 72) . If the deceased has kept the com mandm ents, it is said that there shall be given to him bread and beer and flesh upon the table of Ra — that is, the table of the solar god, which was the table - land upon the sum mit of Mount Hetep, the mount of peace and plenty, where the follow ers of Horus as the spirits of the just made perfect gathered toge ther at the table of the Lord for their eternal feast. When th e beatified spirit attains the meadow of Aarru and the “table of the sun, ” he says, “I rest at the tabl e of my father Osiris” (Rit., ch. 70) . The deceased asks that he may be made strong with the “thous ands of loaves, beer, beef and fow l, and the flesh of the oxe n and various kinds of birds upon the table of his father” (ch. 69) . Thus , as the Egypt ian Ritual of the Resurrection show s, “the Lord’s table” was an institution in the Osirian mysteries which did not wait to be founde d at the beginni ng of the pres ent era. It has, of cour se, been remarked that the fellow ship of Jesus with the twelve in the Gospels is a table - fellow ship, and that he uses the image of a suppe r to sym bol ize the meeting in his father’s kingdom . The gor ging in a paradise of plenty descri bed by later legends is indi cated in the Pyramid Texts (Pepi I, 432; Merira, 618) . When the deceased is on his way to the mount of glory, he is bor ne to a region where he is filled with food by being fed from evening unt il daybr eak, and then he is said to seize upon the god Hu, the god of aliment, of corn, of food — in shor t, the 381 bread of life in a spiritual sense. The gorging and guzzling which are custom ary accom paniments of the Christmas festival in the north are a survival from the time when the pri mitive paradise was por trayed as a place of the grossest plenty. Even the more refined Egyp tian gloried in the prospect of the earthly abunda nce being repeated for ever in heaven. This is what he says on sitting dow n at the tabl e of the Lord : “I sit dow n i n the midst of all the great gods of heaven. The fields lie before me; the produc e is before me; I eat of it. I wax radiant upon it, I am saturated with it to my heart’s cont ent.” (Rit., ch. 77. ) The mount or altar in Hetep which is imaged as a pile of pl enty, a table of offerings , a mount ainous heap of food , is the prototype of thos e artificial mount ains exhi bited, for example, in Naples at the publ ic festivals, from which all kinds of eatables are distribut ed in the wildest profusion among the peopl e, wh ilst the godde ss Tait, who is the cook of divine dainties in that land of Brobdi ngnagian abunda nce, will account for the paradise of cooks and cooke ry which survives in various versions of Le Pays de Cocagne , where the most delicious food already cooke d is spont aneous ly produc ed like fruit upon the tree of life. A version of this promised land is current in the Sout hern States of"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"America, amongs t the Negroes, who preserve the tradition of a tree of life, on the branches of which hot buc k - wheat cakes hang ov er a lake of molasses that takes the place of the Kamite lake of the waters of life. This land of the godde ss Tait, the cook of the cakes and joints of meat already cooke d, is the Kamite original of Cockaigne , the land of laziness and luxur y, in which the streets were paved with pastry. The name is proba bly derived from the cooke ry: coquo, in Latin, to cook ; Kuchou, in German, for a cake; and cocaigne in Old French, signi fying abunda nce. The witches’ Sabba th, how ever degraded, was a mode of celebrating this great festival according to the most primitive ideal of a paradise which ove rflow ed with food and drink, and the glory of the sex was celebrated with Titanic wom en, fierce as Sekhe t, in evoki ng and matching the animal passion of primitive men. Even in the Rig Veda (ch. X, p. 154) it is said of the man who wins this heaven of blessedne ss, “Non urit igni s membrum virile nec arripit deus Yama semen ejus” (much wom anki nd shall be his in heaven). The witches’ festival was held on the hill - top or high place, whi ch is Mount Hetep in miniature. Each one brough t an offering of food and drink to the feast, and Mount Hetep is an altar, heaped with obl ations and offerings for a feast that was to last for ever. The food was brought in raw for this celestial banque t. The speaker says, “I net the duc ks and I eat the dainties. I take care to catch the reptiles.” With these we may com pare the reptiles in the witches’ cauldron. There is also a gruesom e witch - like Kamite godde ss Tseret, with long , flow ing red hair, who is arme d with hor ns. The divine drink that was brewed in Hetep as beer is imitated by the witches as a produc t of the magic cauldron, the cauldron of Keridw en in the ancient British mysteries, which survived to som e extent in the witches’ Sabba th. The milk of se ven rich - udde red cow s was typi cal of eternal plenty in the green pastures of this African paradise; or, in the later anthropo - 382 morphi c imagery, seven wom en, young and beautiful as Hathor the godde ss of love and love liness, of music and dancing and se xua l delight, were the figure of infinite felicity in this heaven which Moha mmed so successfully ado pted for the Turks. In bot h pha ses the seven were seen as the seven great stars of Ursa Major that were in attenda nce on “the bul l of the seven cow s,” or th e spirit of the glorified deceased who had risen to heaven in the image of Amsu - Horus. The Hebrew paradise upon the sum mit of the mount in the prom ised land is the same ideal of primitive blessedne ss. “In this mount ain,” says the prophe t Isaiah, “shall the Lord of Hosts make unt o the peopl e a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow ; of wines on the lees well refined” (Is. 25, 6). Papias, that ignor amus of a primitive Christian, also recount s how “the elders who saw Jo hn, the disciple of the Lord, related that they had heard from him how the Lord used to teach in regard to these times, and say: The day s will com e, in which vines shal l grow , each hav ing ten thous and branc hes, and in each branc h ten thous and twigs and in each true twig ten thous and shoot s, and in each one of the shoot s ten thous and clusters, and on every one of the clusters ten thous and grape s, and every grape when pressed will give five and twenty metretes of wine. And when any one of the saints shal l lay hol d of a cluster anot her shal l cry out , ‘I am a better cluster; take me: bless the Lord through me.’ In like manne r (the Lord declared) ‘a grain of wheat woul d produc e ten thous and ears, and that every ear shoul d hav e ten thous and grains, and every grain woul d yield ten"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"pounds (qui nque bilibres) of clear, pur e, fine flour ; and that all other fruit - bearing trees, and seeds and grass, woul d produc e in similar propor tions (secundum congr uentiam iis cons eque ntem). And these things are bor ne witness to in writ ing by Papi as, the hearer of John, and a com pani on of Polycarp, in his four th book , for there were five book s com piled (synt etagm ena) by him. And he says in addi tion, ‘Now these things are credible to believers.’” ( Irenæ us, B. 5, ch. 33, 3 - 4, Ante - Nicene L ibrary.) The Kamite paradise was the place of plenty and of strong drink. The Indi an’s idea of future felicity, which cons isted in being eternally intoxi cated, is but an extension from this primary basis. The “cauldron of regeneration for spirits” was der ived from the brewing - vat. Also it is not iceable that the Egypt ian garden of Aarru or Allu, in the Ritual, has the same name as the grape, the vine - branch, and the wine. Hetep was the land that flow ed with milk and hone y, and the imagery is demons trably Eg ypt ian. It flow ed with hone y because the flow ers were always in bloom . A curious illustration of this land of hone y and its Egypt ian origin may be drawn from the Ritual. There is a typi cal conduc tor that leads the spirits to their hom e in the Egypt ian fiel ds, called the abait or bird - fly, which in one form is the praying - mantis and in anot her the hone y - bee. This divine gui de is called in ancient texts the tiller of the rudde r of the neshemit ship of Osiris in which the spirits made their voya ge across the w aters to the land of hone y, gui ded by the bee (Rit., chs. 76 and 104 ). The land flow ing with milk is indi cated by the seven cow s of plenty, whilst the heavenly Nile woul d represent the hone y, as it was the water that was likened to hone y for sweetness. Ind eed, there is a tradition that 383 in the time of Nefer - Ka - Ra the Nile ran with hone y or the taste of it for eleven days. (Brugs ch, Egypt unde r the Phar aohs , Eng. trans. in one vol um e, p. 30. ) The Egypt ian paradise of Hetep is mappe d out in ten divine do mains which correspond to a heaven in ten divisions . These ten divisions were lost, or superseded, like the ten islands of the lost Atlantis, when the zodi ac of twelve signs was finally established. And naturally there woul d be ten popul ations lost, as in the Assyrian deluge . It follow s that the ten tribes of Israel, who preceded the twelve, were lost at the same time and in the same way, the legend being one as astronom ical, wheresoever met with in the märchen. There is a tradition that they will be found again in the Aarru - Hetep or Jerusalem above , the prom ised land which they attained at last. In the Æthiopi c “Conf lict of Matthew” it is said that the ten tribes “feed on hone y and drink of the dew.” “The water we drink is not from springs , but from the lea ves of trees grow ing in the gardens” (James, Texts and Studi es, 70) . These were they who passed in death like all the rest across the waters “into a farther count ry where manki nd never dw elt,” because it was in the spirit - world. (II Esdras XIII. 40 - 42. ) T he 110t h chapter of the Ritual suffices of itself to prove the Kamite origin of the moun t of glory and the circum pol ar paradise. This is the chapter of com ing forth from the nether - world by day, or with the sun, and arriving in the garden of Aarru, on the mount of resurrection in Hetep, and at “the grand dom ain, blest with the breezes.” This was the heaven lifted up by Shu of old as the sum mit of attainm ent. It is called “the beautiful creation which he raiseth up,” the mansion of his stars which had been a gain and again renewed in the heaven of astronom y. In the eschatology it was the heaven of"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"reconc iliation, reuni on, and of rest. It had been the heaven of Abydos , of Annu, Thebes, Memphi s, Hermopol is, and other cities on earth, and now it was the heaven of eternity, the heaven of spirits perfected; also the heaven of Chaldean, Hebrew, Hindu , Japanese, Greek, and all the others who repeated the astronom ical imagery and founde d their religious teaching on the wisdom of ancient Egypt . The sum mit of Hetep was t he seat of Hathor , que en of heaven and mother of fair love on earth. She who had drawn the world in offering her full breast as nur se to Horus now offered it upon the mount of glory to the weary spirits whom she gathered in her motherly embrace. She was al so represented by thos e seven cow s or meris, as the giver of plenty in the meadow s of Aarru, so abunda ntly that the river called the Milky Way was as the ove rflow ing plenitude from this perpetual sour ce. On a tablet in the Louv re (ch. 14) this divine mothe r of gods and men is asked for “the white liquor that the glorified one s love .” This is distinctly called milk upon a Florentine tablet (2567) , and vases of her milk are mentione d in the inscriptions of Dende rah (Rit., ch. 110, not e 9, Renouf ). Hesit the c ow is identified with Hathor the divine mother, the fair nurse, the mistress of heaven and sove reign of the gods . She was the cow - mother, and her child was the calf who became her bul l as fertilizer. Hence the deceased as Horus in Hetep exclaims, “I am the bull, raised on high in the blue, lord of the bul l’s field” (Rit., ch. 110 , Renouf ), whos e cow or nou risher is Hesit. (Düm ichen, 384 Resultate, 27, 6.) In this way the cow of heaven suppl ied not onl y milk for the infant Horus, but for all who were rebor n as babes in the new life, and the heaven of plenty and of rest was tende rly pictured in the welling bos om of the motherhood, thus divinized upon the mount . When the departed have reached the sum mit of life upon the mount of spirits perfected, they emerge in the garden of Hetep or paradise of Aarru. Here they attain the land of prom ise in the highe st sense of spiritual fulfilment. They eat of the fruit of the tree and drink the water of life, or the milk of the old First Great Mother, who yields it in the form of Hesit the cow : the ancient mother of gods and men to whom the Egypt ians assigne d a foremost station in the starry heavens. Here the beatified spirits who sat upon their throne s of ba - metal, “raised on high in the blue,” among the never - setting star s, extende d the hand of welcom e to the com ing generations of human beings . Three classes of hum an beings are recogni zed in the past, present, and future of existence: the Pait are thos e of the past, the Rekhit are the living, and the Ham emet are the future generations . In one of her inscriptions Queen Hatshepsu appe als to these latter as future witnesses to the glory of her present work. She says, “I make this know n to the Hamemet, who will live in times to com e.” ( Records, vol . XII, pp. 131 - 136 .) The name denot es the une mbodi ed, or, more literally, the un - mummied, from Ha, before, and mem or mum , the mum my. These are the future beings to whom the glorified spirits extend their welcom e in the garden of beginni ng and rebirth; and it is in this enclosure or pa radise that we shall at last discove r the garden on the sum mit of the mount in the nor th that has becom e a traditiona l cradle and creatory of life itself as the rebirthpl ace of the glorified. It is said to Ra, who had becom e the highe st god, “Glory to thee upon the mount of glory. Hail to thee who pur ifiest and prepar est the generations yet unbor n, and to whom this great qua rter of heaven offereth hom age.” (Rit., ch. 130 .) This great qua rter was the northern sum mit in the region of the two lakes of Sa and o f Purification. The divine rebirthpl ace of"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"the soul cons tellated in the meskhe n was conve rted by the later races, Asiatic, Europe an, American, Polyne sian, into the primeval place of hum an birth, from whence the successive migrations were suppos ed to have i ssued forth, because the localities and the scenery of earth had been subs tituted for thos e of the divine or mythical world of the Egypt ian eschatology. The “original Aryan home,” the Iranian paradise, the Semitic garden of Eden, the Greek Elysian Fields a re each derived from the Egypt ian Sekhe t - Hetep, the fields of peace and plenty, or the Sekhe t Aarru, where amid the still waters are por trayed the islands of the blessed, the amaranthine meads and pastures ever green. When Assyriologi sts speak of Urdu the mount ain of the world as the primitive cradle of the hum an race ( Trans . Soc . Bib. Arch., vol . VI, p. 535) , they are obl ivious of the fact that there are fifty or a hundr ed such cradles of the race. Hence ove r eight y different sites have been assigne d to th e garden of the beginni ng, called Edin or Eden by the Semites. The Akka dian Urdhu is one with or corresponds to the Egyp tian Urtu, a name bot h for the ascent or mount and the thigh or haunc h, as a figur e of the birthpl ace, hum an or divine. The 385 emigra nts from Urdhu, like the Merope s, were the peopl e of the thigh. The Hype rbor eans were reput ed to dw ell above the nor th wind, as Festus says, “supr a aqui loni s flatum ,” which gives us an astronom ical hint. Appa rently the bird aqui la represents the Egypt ian v ulture mut, which is described in the Ritual (ch. 149) as being on or above the leg cons tellation: “I am the divine vul ture who is on the uarit.” But whether it doe s or doe s not , the Hype rbor eans are localized above Aqui la in the nor thern heaven in the cel estial pol e - land, where dw elt the ancestors of the Ainu, and the Hamemet of the Egypt ian theology. Again, the cons tellation of the thigh, as sign of the meskhe n, wom b, or birthpl ace, will show us the origin of the Merope s. The word m š ropej (or peopl e of th e thigh) was a sacred expr ession used by the Greeks to denot e manki nd. It is said of the Hype rbor eans by Hellanikos (fragm ent 96) that they dw elt beyond the Ripaian mount ains, and were the teachers of justice, and ate the fruit of trees. This identifies th em with the glorified spirits in the pol ar paradise by two unm istakable determinatives of locality. One is the tree, or wood, of life, on the fruit of which the gods and glorified were fed; the other is the maat or judgm ent seat upon the sum mit of the moun t, where sat the great judge as Anup, or Atum , or Osiris, in succession according to the reigni ng dyna sty of gods , that were stellar, luna r, or solar. Mythical mons ters like the Cyclops have descende d from this birthpl ace of the beginni ng. According to He siod, the Cyclops were Titans, and the Titans are the giants who were prope rly a group of seven in later tradition. They were the assistants of Haphæ stus, the worker in fire, who was the Greek Vulcan. This tends to identify them with the seven Knemmu, who were the assistants of Ptah, the metallurgist; the seven who were the giants of an earlier time as turners of the sphe re in huge and mons trous form. Hom er calls Mycenæ , the ark - city on the sum mit, the altar of the Cyclops ; and the altar is a final form of the mount which was figur ed in the cons tellation “Ara.” In one character the seven pow ers that were groupe d in the Lesser Bear were the giants, and the giants as Cyclops had but one eye between them. Naturally Polaris as the one eye to the seven was said t o be the one eye of the seven, and the giants were then said to have been one - eyed."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"This woul d account for the Arimaspoi and other one - eyed peopl e as dw ellers in the uttermost vertical north. All was gol den in the primal paradise, and according to Hesiod t here was a “gol den race of men.” These were they who came the first. This race was stellar, like the gol d that made the circum pol ar heaven gol den. They were the glorious one s, the never - setting one s, the bor n immortals in the everlasting “gol den - hue d regio n whos e food never fails,” described in the Vendi dad (Fargard II, line 103 ). Now , the que stion for thos e who looke d up longi ngly to this paradise of peace and plenty as the sum mit of attainm ent for anot her life was how to reach that landi ng - place of soul s and haven of supr eme desire. There was heaven, but by what means coul d the height be climbed or the water crossed when as yet there were no boa ts or bridge s bui lt? Clearly there was not hing for it, from the first, but to leap or swim the waters flow ing tw ixt the mount that was 386 munda ne and the mount of glory. Hence the Great Mother Apt and Sut her son were figur ed as totemic hippopot ami, and Sebek as the crocodi le, for the passage of the water. This was in a mythical representation of natural phenom en a, the same mode of progr ession being cont inue d in the eschatology. When the deceased is about to cross the water betwixt the two worlds he says, “It is I who traverse the heavens. May I have com mand of the water.” (Rit., ch. 62. ) But, previous to being se lf - inve sted with the necessary pow er, he prayed to be carried across by the Great Mother, who was imaged as the pregna nt hippopot amus in the cons tellation of the bear, or as the milch - cow in the meskhe n, or the moon. For this reason the Great Bear was also called the coffin of Osiris, as the typi cal place of rebirth. She is the ark of souls who saved them from the waters in the cabin which was uterine. The mother of life as Apt the water - cow was follow ed by Hesit the milch - cow , and in a later though very an cient representation it is the dom esticated cow that carries the dead across the waters to the sum mit of the mount . But the earliest carrier of soul s across the waters in death is Apt, the most ancient mother of life. In the astronom ical pha se she is the g odde ss of the seven stars in Ursa Major and mother of the seven typi cal eternals who were safe for ever from the deluge in the never - setting stars (Rit., ch. 17) . In lands of low er latitude than our s the Great Bear, i.e., the female hippopot amus, set at ti mes beneath the horizon or was hidde n behind the mount of earth, to rise again as the bringe r - forth of life from the waters, because the reproduc er of soul s for a future life. It is as the bringe r of hum an soul s to their rebirth that she, the hippopot amus, is por trayed as hum an in her abund ant breasts and procreant wom b. In that gui se she was the wom b of life, great with the soul s she carried across the waters on their way to the uppe r paradise, when there was neither boa t nor bride extant. This is generall y represented by the mum my being bor ne upon the back of the cow that carries it off full speed by land or water till the islands of the blessed are in view. In these scenes the dead are carried out side the cow , whereas with Apt the soul s were carried in th e uterus or meskhe n. In the mysteries of the Ritual (ch. 64) when the Osiris (deceased) is crossing the waters that have bur st forth in a deluge, he exclaims, “Anup is my bearer.” In this instance the jackal is the carrier, the psychopom pus , because it rep resents the pow er of the pol e as the suppor t of the soul in death. In cons eque nce of being raised up by Anup, the gui de of roads (Ap - Uat), the deceased also exclaims, “I hide myself among"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"you, O ye stars that never set.” Which show s that he was raised to t he region of the eternals, the Akhe mu - Seku, or non - setting stars (ch. 33) whos e pos ition was fixed for ever as the most ancient lords of eternity, with Anup at their head. When the conc ept of an atmosphe re succeeded the likeness of water, the birds of air coul d be employe d as type s. The sun was represented by the gol den hawk, the moon by the black and white ibis; the stars, that did not set, as beautiful white birds a - floating on the lake in the paradise of Aarru on the sum mit of the mount . The deceased als o exclaims, “I am the swallow ! I am the swallow !” as one particular form of a bird of passage, on his way to the celestial count ry (ch. 86) . Or he assum es the pow er of the bennu - bird, or the 387 shen - shen, bot h of which ascend the air to a great height i n spiral whirls. The deceased in this character prays that he may “wheel round in whirls” and circle heavenw ard with the spiral motion of the bennu, i.e., the typi cal phœ nix (ch. 83). It was in this gui se the soul of Osiris rose again to ascend the tree of life or of dawn, hence the soul of the Osiris doe s the same. The moon was imaged also as the ibis on whos e wings the orb made its celestial ascent. The Osiris pleads that he may ascend to heaven in the disc of the moon , or in the pow er of Taht, the luna r god who show ed the way by night . The ibis now bears off the deceased across the water on its wings , and doe s battle with Sut, the pow er of darkne ss, for a passage. The natives of Torres Straits Islands have a tradition that at death the spirits of their d eparted wing their nor thw ard way in the shape of flying - foxe s to the pol ar paradise of all the abor iginal races. The pow er of wings is thus adde d to the spirit as the supe rhum an mode of flight . Swimming and flying are the two mode s of locom otion here illus trated, unt il we com e to the tree as means of climbing. The natural hum an way of ascent is climbing. But by no direct means coul d the helpless watchers climb the heavens with their hands and feet, and they had no wings of their ow n. As they were frugi vor ou s, they coul d climb the tree, and the tree suppl ied a mental means of ascent for thos e who climbed the heavens as the soul s of the departed. Dawn on the sum mit was imaged as a great green tree upon the mount . Thus the ascent was represented by bot h the mou ntain and the tree. Both were means of the ascent at the com ing forth by climbing from the dark land of Amenta. It may be premised that the papyr us - reed which rose from out the water was an earlier type of climbing heavenw ard than the tree. Child - Horus on his papyr us was a figur e of this ascent by means of the plant or stalk. When the Messu came by water it was by climbing up the stalk like little Jack. The pedestal of Horus, made of stone , was based on the papyr us - plant emerging from the water, and when th is was bur ied with the mum my it was a type of the ascent to heaven. The ascent emerging from the deep, as Mount Meru in Indi a, was called “the lotus (=papyr us) of immensity,” which also show s the water - plant to be a co - type with the mount or tree as the fi gure of the ascent. The tree is por trayed as a means of salvation amid the ove rwhelming waters which had to be crossed by the manes in the Ritual. The tree, then, like the mount and steps, was a typi cal means of ascent to heaven by which spirits attained t he pol ar paradise. It was a natural ladde r. There is no race so primitive but has a tree - type of the ascent to heaven. With the Mboc obi s of Paragua y the soul s of the dead ascend the llagdi gua tree, which is a conne cting link betwixt their earth and heaven (Hum bol dt). The"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"same water and tree occur in the Rig - Veda (II, 66 and 183) , when Bhuggu, son of Tugr a, has to cross the great waters and is “cast headlong into the deep and plunge d into inextricable darkne ss.” He likewise clings for suppor t to the tree “st atione d in the midst of the ocean.” The Australian natives make use of the tree as a mode of ascent to heaven for the spirits of the departed. The wizards also profess that they go up to cons ult the spirits of the dead by ascendi ng a tree. Some of them mak e a pathw ay for the spirits to ascend and descend the tree of earth and 388 heaven by cutting out a strip of bark, taken spirally from the top of a large tree dow n to the ground. (How itt, On som e Australian Ceremoni es of Initiation. ) The tree or pol e as means of climbing is various ly illustrated. The Yao - Miao peopl e bind their dead with withies to a tree for the soul to make the ascent. At other times the branch of a tree or bamboo pol e is stuck in the grave for the soul of the deceased to climb by (Colqu houn, A. R., Across Chrysê, vol . II, p. 369) . The Guarinis of Brazil were the worshippe rs of the god Tamoi who ascende d the tree of dawn, like Tum his Egypt ian prototype . Up this the spirits were to follow in his wake, and he woul d welcom e them to paradise when they attained the sum mit of the tree. The Polyne sians tell of the tree that reached up to the moon. When the deluge of Raitea occurred and the world of the seven divisions was subm erged the survivor s were saved by the tree that reached up to the moon or on an island (the mount ) named Toa - marama, the moon - tree or the tree reaching to the moon (Ellis, Polynesian Researches, vol . II, p. 58). So that bot h the mount and tree are here described toge ther unde r one name. The Samoans have various legends of th e way to heaven. One of these describes it as a mount , the sum mit of which reached up to the skies. Anot her tells of the tree that measured sixty miles in height . According to one account , when the topm ost branches of the tree were reached the climbers had to wait for a high wind which swayed them to and fro for a while and all of a sudde n slung them into paradise. The Samoans also had a tree with steps that formed a sort of ladde r up to heaven. Thus the mount , tree, and ladde r were all extant in one group amongs t the peopl e of the Pacific islands (Turner, Sam oa, pp. 199, 200 ). Both the mount and tree were mode s of ascent in thought , and phys ical means of reaching a little highe r tow ards heaven in making offerings to the pow ers. In Africa the prayer - tree is a com mon institution. The Yao peopl e lay their offering of first - fruits at the root of the prayer - tree before they themselves begin to eat the new crop of maize or pum pki ns. In anot her widespread custom the offerings were hung upon the branches of the tree . The Molucca Islande rs have the typi cal tree of ascent to heaven. This tree stood at the place of sacrifice where the offerings were made. Thus with them, as with various other primitive races, the tree was the first natural altar and stairs that figur ed the way and means of ascent to heaven. The Kasia of Benga l hol d the opi nion that the stars are soul s which onc e were men who climbed up to heaven by means of the tree, and were left aloft in the branches when the trunk was severed below . In the Huron versi on given by Brebeuf, we find the guide of roads for the spirits as the dog that is bot h the gua rdian and the gui de of soul s. In the Choc taw rende ring the tree has becom e a log of pine strippe d of its bark — that is, a kind of slippe ry pol e by which men cross or climb to paradise or else fall off into the chasm that awaits the wicked dow n below ."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":" Then the tree type passes into the pol e and staff. But the most tangi ble figur e for mental foot hol d in climbing based on natural fact was the mount . In almost every l and there is a mount ain know n as the moun t by which the soul s of the dead ascend to the paradise first 389 mappe d out astronom ically at the celestial pol e. This in mythol ogy is the mount of the nor th, the mount of the cow , of the haunc h, the navel, the w om b, the leg, the meskhe n and other images of the birthpl ace on earth appl ied to the place of rebirth in heaven. In Borneo the native gui des poi nted to the sum mit of Mount Kina - Balu as the landi ng - place of the ancestral soul s. They show ed the meat on which the spirits fed, but did not dare to pass the night in this abode of the re - arisen dead, or rather the local likeness of the celestial mount . In the Rocky Mount ains, near Denver, is the “Garden of the Gods ” and the mount of ascent up which the manes climb to attain the sum mit of life and happi ness. So is it in West Java, where the mount ain Gunung Danka is described as being the site of paradise, which means, here as elsewhere, that the paradisaical mount ain was the earthly local representative of the celes tial mount of glory. “The Path of the Shades,” by Basil Thom son, in the New Review, April, 1896, p. 417 , cont ains an account of the Fijian sacred mount ain Nakauva ndr a, toge ther with the motive for rearing it. According to local tradition, the ghos ts of th e dead were great disturbers of the living. They were willing to leave this earth if they coul d but make their way to the sacred mount ain by which the heaven of rest was reached. The tribes then bande d toge ther to make a road for the ghos ts to travel ove r on their last jour ney, so that they might troubl e the living no more. In the year 1892 a surveyor employe d to traverse the bounda ries of native lands in Fiji re - discove red this most ancient Via Sacra, or pathw ay of the shades. He was taken by his gui des al ong the crest of a high ridge , the water - shed between the Rewa river and the eastern coast of the island of Vitilevu. Cutting a way through the unde rgrow th, he found that the path on which he walked was level, and was seldom more than two feet wide; that h ill top was joined to hill top by a razor - edge d embankm ent. He reflected that nature never works in straight lines with so soft a material as earth: that natural banks of earth are always washed into deep depressions by the rains unt il they becom e mere rou nde d une ven slope s. And when his gui des had cleared away a patch of the unde rgrow th, he came upon unm istakable proof that the embankm ent on which he stood was artificial. The little glens had been bridge d with causeways, thirty or forty feet in height in t he deepest parts, tapering to a feather - edge at the top, so as to form a windi ng path along the line of the hill tops that extende d, so the natives said, clear to Nakauva ndr a, the sacred mount ain, forty miles away. For a peopl e without spades or picks, the piling of this embankm ent must have been a gigantic task. Every pound of earth must have been carried up labor ious ly in little cocoanut - leaf baskets, and paid for in daily feasts to the workers. And all to represent the road to heaven. Whatsoever the mea ns of ascent, the toil of climbing up to heaven was stupe ndous . The Mexican Mount Culhua can, for instance, is a Hill Difficulty inde ed. The uppe r part is formed of sand so fine that it offers no foot hol d for any mortal tread. This is a mode of show ing, not merely saying, how hard it is to climb, and none but right eous spirits coul d attain the paradise upon the sum mit."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":" Naturally the staircase, as the work of hum an hands, is com paratively late. But it follow s, as the pathw ay from the tom b. At 390 Abydos , t he seat of Osiris as god in the highe st is at the head of the staircase, when he was the pow er presiding ove r the pol e of heaven (Rit., chs. 7 and 22) . Thebes was anot her city in which the celestial staircase was imaged. As it is said in the inscription of Queen Hatshepsu, “Thebes is a heaven upon earth. It is the augus t staircase of the beginni ng of time. It is the Utat of the universal Lord, his heart’s throne , which sustains his glories and hol ds within it all who accom pany him” in the circle of Osiris, who presided at the top of the steps above the pol e of heaven. (Rit., ch. 7; Records, vol . XII, p. 133. ) The mound or stairway with the seven steps was permanently figured in the seven - steppe d pyr amid of Sakka rah as an image of the moun t with steps that sh ow ed the way to heaven in the astronom ical mythol ogy. The ambition of the Babel - bui lders, described in the book of Genesis, is to erect “a tow er whos e top may reach to heaven” (Gen. XI. 4). Here the tow er with seven tiers takes the place of the mount with seven steps or tree of seven branches, or the ladde r, as a mode of reaching the sum mit of attainm ent. The pillar follow s the mount as a co - type of the pole, first as a pillar of wood, then as a pillar of stone , or metal, or of glass. In various legends th e celestial pol e is imaged as a pillar of glass or other slippe ry subs tance, which also indi cates the difficulty of getting to heaven. This is the pillar by which the manes make their ascent every Sabba th day from the low er to the uppe r paradise; and havin g got a glimpse of all the glory, they slide dow n again into the subt erranean world (Yalkut Kadash, f. 57. c. 2, Stehelin, vol . II, p. 25) . It is related in a Taoist work that onc e upon a time a Chinese king ende avour ed to climb up to heaven by a pillar o f enor mous height , but it was so slippe ry that he always slid back again to the ground ( Chinese Repos itory, vol . VII, p. 519) . And without doubt this slippe ry pillar still survives as the greasy pol e of the British pastimes, which are not cont inue d for the ir grossness, but because they onc e had a sacred signi ficance. In this, the heaven of eternal plenty on the mount is represented by the leg of mutton at the top of the pole. The slippe ry pol e or pillar of glass can be paralleled in the Odys sey. “One rock reaches with sharp peak up to the wide heaven, and a dark cloud encom passes it. No mortal man may scale it or set foot thereon, for the rock is sheer and smoot h as if it were pol ished.” This is not the munda ne mount where mortals find their foot hol d, but the celestial mount , which none but spirits ever scaled in any form of the mythol ogy. When glass began to be manuf actured it woul d suppl y the material for a very perfect likeness to the aërial mount of heaven. The tow er of glass would succeed the tow er of brick and the mound of earth. There is a story told by Nenni us in his Historia Britanni um of “Nimeth the second who came to Erin,” and who, in sailing the ocean with his thirty vessels (luni - solar mont h), sees a glass tow er in the midst of the waters, with men on it who give no answer when they are addr essed. This seems to have been because of its height . So in Taliessin’s account of the glass fort of Arthur, “three score hundr eds stood upon the wall;"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"it was hard to conve rse with the watchm en.” Nimeth attac ks the tow er, and all his thirty vessels are sunk or wrecked. (Rhys , Hibbe rt Lectures, pp. 263 - 264; Skene, 391 Book of Taliessin, vol . II, 155. ) Taliessin the Bard professes to have been in the tow er of glass as well as in Amenta or Hades. This juxt apos i tion of the tow er with the nether - world show s that the dom e of glass was a form of the celestial sum mit. There is a glass hill in the Norse folk - tales. The princess is onl y to be won by the yout h who can ride up the hill of glass. The ash - lad, a male count erpart of Cinde rella, is the onl y one who at all succeeds. At the first trial he rides a third of the way up, and the king’s daught er rolls a gol den appl e dow n to him. On the second day he rides two - thirds of the way up, and wins a second gol den appl e. On the third day he ascends to the top of the hill, and takes the third appl e from the lap of the princess. Of cour se he wins the daught er of the king and half the kingdom besides. In this version the glass hill is the mount of the pole. The king in these mär chen is Ra in the Egyp tian mythos . The princess was Hathor , godde ss of love . The kingdom in two halves was the doubl e earth. Horus wins the second half, and uni tes the two into one kingdom by climbing the hill of glass and winni ng the princess as his wife. The tree on which the gol den appl es grew is the tree of dawn, the tree of Hathor the princess. The hero, who is the king’ s son, som etimes lives as a kitchen - lad beneath the stairs; and in the mythos the staircase is a co - type with the moun t or hill of gla ss. This show s that the stairs stand in the low er world, where the fire of old suns and moons will expl ain the ashes in which the cinde r - girl or ash - lad prove rbially sit in their poo r and low ly estate when the moon and sun are in the nether earth. One typ ical mode of rising to heaven was by means of a dense colum n of smoke ! This was acted by kindling a fire on the grave of the deceased, so that the spirit might ascend as it were in a chariot of cloud. ( Sam oa, Turner, pp. 199 and 335. ) The Samoans expl ained that this was done to save the soul from sinki ng into the pit. The same type was obvi ous ly cont inue d in the smoke of incense rising from the altar. Other illustrations might be cited to show that the ladde r by which the wizard, witch, or conj urer sought t o reach the land of spirits was imaged by means of som ething drawn out of or in som e way emitted from his mout h, a mere thread, a film, a subs tance like gos samer, which proba bly represents the spirit in a filamental form, when the soul was identified with the breath or unde r the same name as it is in the Egypt ian word “nef” for breath and spirit. Thus the subs tance drawn from the mout h of the wonde r - worker represented a kind of ladde r as the visible mode of ascent for the soul exhi bited in primitive mysteri es. The mystery is still extant and still performed to a gaping crow d in the Engl ish market - place, when the conj urer, who is now an acroba t, draws from his mout h a ladde r or spiral pol e made of shavings , or shall we call it the cone of the pol e, which was onc e a figur e of the ascent to heaven, that was follow ed by the ladde r and the steps, the pyr amid, the Babel - tow er, the minaret and spire, unt il its final form upon the low ermost line of descent became the pinna cle made in spiral coils of shavings proceedi ng upw ard from the conj urer’s mout h by dexterous sleight of hand, as the great mount of god, the staircase of Osiris, the figur e of the pol e at its final vanishing poi nt. Thus the conj urer’s twist of shavings drawn from his mout h may illustrate a mode of t he mysteries when it"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":" 392 was taught that the soul of breath came forth from the mout h as its ow n ladde r or means of ascent to the uppe r world. Anot her illustration of the difficulty in climbing up to heaven may be seen in the ladde r formed of kni ves whi ch is made use of by the Taoist jugg lers in China. This is cons tructed of two upr ight bamboos , with kni ves or sword - blades set between, edge uppe rmost, for steps. The ladde r was a co - type with the mount and steps of ascent. The Japanese have a mythical mou ntain called Kurahashi, the dark ladde r. The speaker, in a passage quot ed by O’Neil, says he climbs this vertical ladde r by the aid of his sister. “Steep though Kurahashi be, steep it is not when I climb it with my sister” ( The Night of the Gods , vol . II, p. 1015) . The sister is a godde ss whom we look upon as luna r. There was also a ladde r - mount near Ptolemais which is mentione d by Josephus ( Jew. War, II, 70) . Certain sacred hills in Engl and, called the “Step Hills,” repeat the ladde r of ascent to heaven. T here is one near Ivinghoe (Bucks) which is evidently an artificial formation. Cader Idris is reput ed to have had 365 steps from bottom to sum mit. The Egypt ians solemnized a feast of the dead or festival of the steps, by which they celebrated the ascent of the manes from the valley of Amenta to the sum mit of the mount . When bridge s were bui lt, a bridge suppl ied the typical means of crossing the celestial waters. The earliest figur e of a bridge in heaven was proba bly the rainbow . This was the Norse bridge ma de by the gods that reached from earth to the height of heaven and dow n again to the earth, and was therefore a visualized way for the com ing and goi ng of soul s. In the Prose Edda, Gangl er asks, “Which is the path leading from earth to heaven?” The answer of Har is, “Hast thou not been told that the gods made a bridge from earth to heaven and called it Bifrost? But perhaps thou callest it the rainbow .” ( Prose Edda, 13. ) The name of Bifrost denot es the evanescent aërial bridge . The rainbow is certainly a for m of the celestial bridge , though pos sibly the type may not have been Egypt ian. It is a pathw ay for spirits to the Brahm anic Svarga. It is the snake - bridge that crosses the river of the dead to the dw elling beyond in a North American Indi an version of the mythos . Also, the soul s of Maori chieftains are suppos ed to mount heavenw ard by means of the rainbow . The Samoans called the rainbow Laa Maom ao, the great step or the long step of the god (Turner, Sam oa, p. 35) . Wang - liang, or the king’ s bridge , is a cons t ellation in the Chinese planisphe re which is described as the bridge that spans the moat of the ruler’s castle. This is crossed by kings and chieftains when they go to pay their hom age to the mona rch. The moat was also crossed by boa t. This moat correspond s to the waterway of the Egypt ians, and to the “way which is above the earth”; in shor t, the galaxy on which the soul s of the dead were carried in the bark of Ra (Rit., ch. 4). The sym bol s of the garden of peace, includi ng the kissing dove s, may be seen po rtrayed upon the ordinary willow - pattern china plate. The bridge survives in som e old British ballads as the “Brig o’ Dread.” One of these is called “a lyke - wake dirge,” in which the jour ney of the dead is described. In “Lady Culross’s Dream” it is “a narr ow bridge of tree” suspende d ove r an unfathom able gulf. But, as Scott 393 "},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"poi nts out , the most minut e description of “the Brig o’ Dread” occurs in the legend of Sir Owain, who, after many fright ful adve ntures in St. Patrick’s pur gatory= Amenta, arrives at the bridge which, in the legend, is placed between pur gatory and paradise. “Lo! Sir Knight, see’st thou this? This is the Bri dge of paradis. Here over thou must go. Whoso falleth off the Bri gge adown, For him is no redemption.” He fal ls into the voi d of Apap, or the lake of out er darkne ss. The moral of the dirge is that whatsoever good works have been done on earth will be waiting at the bridge and help the deceased to cross the gul f. (Scott, The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border. ) Th e pyr amid is an artificial figur e of the mount as means of the ascent to heaven. And now , if we place our selves with the mum my at the bot tom of the Well, we shall see that the tubul ar shaft of the great pyr amid at Gizeh represented the way to heaven as it was imaged to Egypt ian though t. The Pharaoh resting at the foot might scan not merely the starry vast, but coul d fix his gaze in death upon the heaven of spirits at the sum mit of the mount , the paradise of peace, the enclosure that was finally configur ated in the circle of the seven pol e - stars that crossed his telescope (the passage poi nting nor thw ard) one by one in the circuit of precession, or the heaven of eternity. The pol e - star, a Draconi s, was not the onl y one that woul d com e within range of that grea t tube . The great pyramid was founde d on the Egypt ian astronom y, but was not bui lt simply to register the fact that a Draconi s was the fixed poi nt and pol ar pivot of all the stellar motion dur ing som e 3,700 years in the vast circuit of precession. The ceil ings of the pyr amid chambers were sprinkl ed ove r with stars to resemble the face of the sky by night . Astronom ical tables gave the aspect of the heavens tenat by tenat throughout the year. So that the manes “had but to lift their eyes” and see in what part of the firmament the cour se lay night after night . Thus , lying in his sarcopha gus , the dead man found his future destinies depicted thereon, and learned to unde rstand the blessedne ss of the gods . (Maspero, Egyptian Archy., Eng. trans., pp. 158 - 160.) The c hief cour se was mappe d out along the river of the Milky Way, as is show n in the Ritual, by the boa t of soul s ascendi ng to the pol ar paradise. The deceased, who is about to rise again and set his legs in motion, prays that he may “go up to Sekhe t - Aarru, and arrive in Sekhe t - Hetep.” Lying as the mum my in Amenta, he says “I shine above the leg as I com e forth in heaven, but (here, meantime) I lie helpless with a corpse - like face. I faint. I faint before the teeth of thos e whos e mout h raveneth in the nether - wor ld.” (ch. 74, Renouf .) The cynos ure of the watcher is a poi nt above the cons tellation called “the leg” by the Egypt ian astronom ers. This was a cons tellation in the nor thern sky which has been identified by Renouf with the group of Cassiope ia, and which the Egypt ians named the meskhe n or creatory of the cow . The earliest figure of an ark in heaven, or on the waters of the Nun, was that of Horus on his papyr us - reed, who issued as the soul of life in vegetation from the abys s. As the sacred bark bor ne heavenw a rd in the mysteries shows, this was a figure of the papyr us - 394 flow er which had been the cradle of Child - Horus previous to its being imaged in the eschatology or astronom y. When the boa t was bui lt the soul s of the deceased were ferried"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"ove r the waters in the mythical bark which was at first stellar, next luna r, and lastly solar. There is a bark that voya ged round the pol e as Ursa Minor , with seven soul s or glorious one s on boa rd, seen in the seven stars that never set, a primary type of the eternals. In anot her text we find a prayer for the deceased, “that he may reach the hor izon with his father the sun, in the solar bark; that his soul may rise to heaven in the disc of the moon; that his Sahu (or celestial body ) may shine in the stars of Orion, on the bos om of heaven” ( Book of Sen - Sen, Records, vol . IV, p. 121 ). Here are three forms of the boa t of soul s, one in the stellar, one in the luna r, and one in the solar representation, at three different stages of the mythos . Mode rn astronom y speaks of the star ry vast as a revol ving sphe re, where the ancient wisdom called it the ship of heaven or the bark of eternity. At first the supe rhum an force that hauled the system round was thought of as a might y mons ter swi}m ing the celestial lake — a hippopot amus or a croc odi le, or a com pound of both. This was the Great Mother of the revol utions , who was cons tellated as the primum mobi le, the godde ss Apt depicted in the Great Bear as the procreant wom b of life, the mother and nur se of uni versal life. Seven pow ers were born of her, and represented unde r different type s as hippopot ami, crocodi les, jackals, apes or uas - eared animals. Seven such were figur ed as the pullers round the pivot of the pol e. When the boa t was launc hed the seven were groupe d as seven kabbi rs or sailors in the Lesser Bear that made the voya ge night ly, annua lly, and for ever round the mount . They were likewise por trayed as seven tow - men of the starry vast, and haul ers of the solar boa t, the bark of millions of years, the vessel that was row ed by the twelve kings or twelve great gods around the final zodi ac. We learn from the solar mythos that the rope of the towers was made fast to the star Ak, which is to be identified with the pol e. The tow - men say, “The rope is with Ak.” “Ra calls it, and the rope put s i tself in its place.” Ra is then in Amenta, and the rope of the tow ers is fastened at the uppe r end to the pol e. Ra says, “Pow er to you , tow ers. Tow me to the dw elling of stable things . Free your selves on this mysterious mount ain of the hor izon. ” This tow in g upw ard of the solar bark is one of the great mysteries of Amenta. ( Book of Hade s, VI, pp. 8 - 32. ) The “navigators for this great god” who tow the boa t are also said to take their oars and row for Ra. Ra says to them, “Take your oars, uni te your selves to y our stars.” “O my pilots, you shall not perish, gods of the never - setting stars” (Akhe mu - Seku) . Thus the solar boa t or ship of heaven was navigated by the gods of the non - setting stars who voya ged round about the pol e; who did not sink below the hor izon, b ut became the lords of eternity. A Chinese cons tellation in the Milky Way is called “the ship of heaven,” and the “ship of Nu” as Egypt ian IS the ship of heaven by name. It is sailed ove r the voi d of the Apap - reptile or dragon of darkne ss, also called the lake of Putrata, into which the soul s fall headlong who do not secure salvation on boa rd the bark, and have no other means of attaining the “tip of heaven” in the Aarru - paradise 395 (Rit., ch. 99) . The ship Argo Navis, as a cons tellation, is a reduc ed f orm of “the ark of heaven” which is described in the Ritual (ch. 99) . Four parts of the ship of Nu remain in the Arabic figure of Argo Navis, viz., the “poop, ” the “keel,” the “mast,” and the “sail.” In the Ritual the “ship of Nu” is described in all its p arts. “Backbone of Apua t” is the name of the keel. Akar (in Amenta) is the name of the hol d. “Leg of Hathor ” is the name"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"of the hul l. The “two colum ns of the nether - world” is the name of the stem and stern pos ts, or masts. “Amsta, Hapi, Tuamutef, and Kabhs enuf ” are the names of the ribs; “Nut” is the name of the sail. “Bearer of the great one whilst she passeth” is the name of the mast. “Lord of the doub le earth in the shrine” is the name of the moor ing - pos t. The founda tion was laid on, or in, the backbone of Anup, which was onc e the type of stability as a figur e of the pol e, the earliest fixed founda tion laid in the bui lding of the heavens. Akar is anot her name for Amenta, the hol low nether - world of three, this ship being a three - decker. Amsta, Hapi, Tuamut ef, and Kabhs enuf are the suppor ts of the sky at the four corners or sides of the vessel. They are also the four oars of the vessel. The moor ing - pos t was an image of the pol e, to which the stellar ark or solar bark was fastened by the cable, as it made the voya ge round the starry moun t. The ship of heaven, then, is a figure of the nether - world in its hold and of the four qua rters in its ribs, which are also represented as the four paddl es, one at each of the cardinal poi nts. This was cons tellated in the hea vens as an ark that made the voya ge up the Milky Way to the tip of heaven and the place of com ing forth upon the mount of glory. The ship of heaven was an ark of salvation for soul s. Thos e who did not find safety on boa rd are described as falling headlong into the gulf of Putrata where the dragon Apap lurked to devour them. Now , in the planisphe re the cons tellation Hydr a is next to the ship Argo, and Hydr a the water - snake is identical in character and pos ition with the Apap - reptile who devour ed thos e that f ell into the voi d, otherwise the bot tom less pit of the abys s. A know ledge of this ship and its cons tituent parts, toge ther with the cour se of its jour ney through the heavens, was necessary to the initiate in making his passage to the paradise of the pol e. The Osiris was not allow ed to pass on boa rd unl ess he coul d answer every que stion put and tell the name of every part of the vessel. The names given show that the different parts of the vessel were conf igur ated in the stars according to the mythical type s, and that the mystery was astronom ical. Finally, the great bark of salvation was solar, with Horus at the outlook. The deceased prays to the god who is on boa rd, “O Ra, in that thy name of Ra, since thou passest through thos e who perish headlong: do thou k eep me standi ng on my feet.” “Are you com ing into the bark?” says the great god Atum - Ra, with a naïve familiar invitation that reminds us som ewhat of the invi tation “com e with us” of more recent salvationi sts. “The bark adva nceth. Acclamation com eth from t he mount of glory and greeting from the lines of measurement.” These are the cheers with which the boa t is hailed and welcom ed by the inha bitants of the uppe r paradise. “Lo, the lamp is lifted up in Annu” as a light by night to lead them on the way when th ey com e to the heaven of the stars that set, and 396 they have to steer by the pol e - star as their gui de of ways. While the Osiris passes ove r the waters to the west the Khabsu gods get ready for light ing up the heavens with their starry lamps, to greet t he passenge rs appr oaching in the bark with acclamations of great joy. “All right is the Osiris; his future is in Annu ,” the eternal city at the pol e. The glorified deceased sails in the great bark on the stream of the god Hetep, the White Way, unt il he com es to the ten divisions of the circum pol ar paradise. These he enters to take pos session of them one by one . As an astronom ical founda tion, the uppe r paradise of all mythol ogy upon the mount of glory was depende nt on establishing the celestial pol e for a fi xture in the waters of surroundi ng space, or, as the Ritual phrases it, “a moor ing - pos t” for the ship"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"of soul s. Here was the rock of safety and the tree to which the sinki ng spirits clung for their salvation. Here the mariner says, “I make myself fast to t he block of moor age on the heavenly stream.” That is, to the pol e which was figur ed as the final moor ing - pos t upon the landi ng - stage of an eternal shor e. The Kamite paradise, as an enclosure of the water and the tree of life upon the sum mit of the mount , is traceable in four different forms. At first it was the primitive paradise of the Oasis in the sout h. Next it is the circum pol ar paradise of Am - Khemen, upr aised by Anhur in the north. The third one is the paradise of Atum in the garden of Amenta. The fin al paradise was founde d on the mount of glory for the spirits of the just made perfect in the heaven of eternity. Thus there are four type s of paradise. And these appa rently are enum erated and described in Irish legenda ry lore when Cesair, “the first wom an who lande d in Ireland before the Flood ,” says of her great know ledge , “Truly I am well versed in the world’s history, for Inis Patmos is precisely the earth’s four th par adi se, the others being (1) Inis Daleb in the world’s sout hern, (2) Inis Escandr a in i ts bor eal par t, and (3) Adam’s paradise.” The four th paradise is that in which the righteous dw ell who have attained to everlasting life ( Adventures of Teigue , Son of Cian, Nutt, The Happy Otherworld, p. 203) . In such ways relics of the astronom ical mythol ogy remain unr ecogni zed in many scattered fragm ents of the ancient wisdom .  397 EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND THE HEBREW GENESIS B OOK VII T HE Egypt ian system of uranogr aphi c representation has been out lined and many of its details have been identi fied in the chapters on the astronom ical mythol ogy. It has now to be show n that the so - called “legends of creation” chiefly know n as Semitic are the detritus of the Egypt ian wisdom . These legends did not wait for their beginni ng unt il the Mosaic Pentateuch had been carried round the wide circum ference of the world either by the scattered Jewish peopl e or the Christian missiona ries. As we have"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"seen, the Semitic theologians did not know enough of the ancient sign - langua ge to distingui sh the evil serpent from the good, the great Earth - mother from the chimerical dragon of the deep, or the beneficent spirits of elemental nature from the Sebau, the Sami or fiendi sh forces of external phe nom ena. The Semitic versions of the legends , Babyl oni an, Assyrian, or Hebrew, mainly reprodu ce the débris of the astronom ical mythol ogy, which has so often been reduc ed to the status of the nursery - tale. It is their fatal defect that they are not the original doc um ents, and have no firsthand authority. In these the primitive wisdom of old Egypt has been perverted, and the mythical beginni ngs , which had their ow n meaning, have been transmogr ified into what is herein termed a cosmogoni cal creation. For example, the mythical abys s or deep was not the mother of all things . That was the M other - earth in the abys s, the nun, or firmamental water. As the Mother - earth she brought forth her elemental progeny in and from the abys s. Hence she was the wateress, or wet - nur se who suckled her young within the earth, as it is said of the mons ter Tiamat , because, as primordial bringe r - forth, she was the Mother - earth. In the Babyl oni an legends of creation the seven associate - gods , who are the creators in the Egypt ian mythos , have been conve rted into the seven evil spirits of a later theology . And on one o f the tablets (W.A.I.4.I. I .36, 37) it is said of these seven evil spirits, “The wom an from the loins of the man they bring forth.” Thus the creation of wom an is made to be the work of seven evil spirits, who, as the Kamite wisdom witnesses, did not origina te as wicked spirits or as pow ers of evil. (Sayce, H. L., p. 395 .) The legends of creation are know n, more or less, as Hebrew, Phœ nician, Babyl oni an, and Assyrian, but as Kamite they have not been know n. And when the mythical representations of natural phe nom ena first 398 por trayed by the Egypt ians were turned into cosmographi cal creations by the Semites, they had no verifiable meaning either as history or mythol ogy. Even Lenor mant held that the Chaldaic and Hebrew versions had one com mon origin and were not derived from each other, but he made no attempt to trace that origin to the Egypt ian astronom ical mythol ogy, which was to him a sealed and secret book. Egyp t’s know ledge of beginni ngs was labor ious ly derived by the long, unc easing verification of scien tific naturalists. Their ancient wisdom did not fall from heaven ready - made, nor had it any claims to a miraculous birth. It was dug for and qua rried out from the rock of reality. It was smelted, shaped, stamped, and warranted for current coin as perpetual sym bol of the truth, how ever primitive. It was and is, to - day and for ever, a coinage genui nely gol den, though the figur es on it may be som etimes difficult to deciphe r. The ancient wisdom in the Hebrew books has been conve rted into a spur ious specie, and passed off on the ignor ant and uns uspecting as a brand - new issue from the mint of God. According to Egypt ian thought , “creation” was mainly limited to the bringing forth of life — the life of water, fish and fow l, animal, reptile, and other forms from the me skhe n or creatory of earth, when this was represented by the wom b of Apt the pregnant water - cow . This idea of birth from the wom b is por trayed in Apt the first Great Mother (fig., p. 124 ). Next the idea of birth from the wom b is repeated in the making of A menta with the Tuat as the creatory or the place of rebirth for the manes. And thirdly, in the astronom ical mythol ogy the meskhe n, wom b or place of birth, was cons tellated in the “thigh” of the cow as the sign of rebirth in"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"the celestial rebirthpl ace. We h ave now to formulate the Egypt ian origins of the creation legends that have com e to us in a Semitic gui se or disgui se. In their account of “the beginni ngs ” the Egypt ians make no pretence of know ing anyt hing about a cosmical creation. Theirs is the natural genesis. A com mon Egypt ian phr ase for creation was “of the first time,” and the expr ession is well represented in the ope ning words of the Hebrew book of Genesis, which are rende red “in the beginni ng” (Stele of the Sphi nx, “Of the first time”). This begin ning was “in the dom ain of Sut,” “that sacred place of the first time.” This first time, says the inscription, goe s back to the dom ain of Sut and to the days of the masters of Khar, the later Akar and Neter - kar of the unde r - world. Darkne ss was the domain o f Sut, as a condi tion of com mencement, and the birthpl ace was where light broke forth from out the darkne ss. It was the African birthpl ace of the black and white twins of night and day. Otherwise the beginni ng in “the first time” described by the Ritual wa s with birth from the abys s, which was the birthpl ace of water within the earth. It is portrayed as “the Tuat which nobody can fathom ,” the place that “sent out light in the dark night ,” which was the birthpl ace of water and of eatable plants (Rit., ch. 17 2). Thus we have the Deep, the darkne ss on the face of the deep, the light breaking out of the darkness; the waters and the life springi ng forth from the waters in eatable plants, groupe d together in Amenta the earth of eternity. Water had revealed the sec ret of creation in the life which came as food by water from the Mother - earth in the unfathom able deep. The 399 secret of water as the sour ce of life was the primal mystery to the Egypt ians, as is show n by Kep (or Apt), the ancient mother of mystery, whe n the mystery was that of fertilization by means of water, as in the inunda tion of Egypt by the river Nile. That secret of the precious water - sour ce, the divul gence of which was the cause of the deluge at Lake Tanga nyi ka, the secret that is so persistentl y preserved as a matter of life or death by the Bushm en amongs t other African races, had been entrusted with occult signi ficance to the keeping of the Sphi nx. The Sphi nx was a figur e of the primitive abys s called Akar, the unfathom able deep of earth or wom b of life, and it is a monum ent that marked the sacred place of creation or “the first time.” As the inscription says, “The Sphi nx repos es in this very place” — the place, that is, where life came into the world by water with food from the unf athom able abys s and light from the primeval darkne ss. This was also the sacred way by which the elemental pow ers or gods came into being, who originated as the masters of the nether earth. The num ber is not given, but these are know n unde r several type s and names as the primordial seven pow ers, the seven spirits of earth, or seven Uræus divinities, who were bor n in the low er earth before this had been hol low ed out by Ptah in the making of Amenta. In the several Semitic account s of the first time, or in the beginni ng, mor e especially that of the Hebrew Genesis, the astro - mythol ogi cal representation has been merged in a material creation, as the result of a later and more literal rende ring of the subj ect matter; the later the version, the more exot eric the rende ring. In the Assyrian epic the uppe r and low er firmaments, called “Ansar and Kisar were created.” This is identical with the creation of the uppe r and low er firmament in the Hebrew Genesis. But in the Egypt ian wisdom onl y can we make out what “creation” means as a mod e of"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"representation in the ancient sign - langua ge. There are som e remains, how ever, of the astronom ical mythol ogy in the Babyl oni an and Assyrian legends . One of these is the beginni ng with a world all water as an image of the firmament, or, when otherwise e xpr essed, with the lands that were whol ly sea. This is follow ed by the stream that divided the celestial Okeanos , and the cons eque nt formation of a firmamental abys s, where the low er waters were gathered toge ther into one place. In the Babyl oni an account o f creation there was a time when the uppe r region was not yet called heaven; the low er region was not yet called earth, and the abys s was not yet formed. So, in the “non - Semitic” version the abys s had not been fashione d, the waters had not been gathered in to one place; the whol e of the lands were sea, and there was no stream yet conf igur ated in the celestial ocean (Talbot , Records of the Past, vol. IX; Pinches, Records of the Past, 2nd series, vol . VI). Beginni ng in the heavens was with the unc reated Nun. W hen this was divided into an uppe r and low er firmament so - called “creation” had com menced. When the waters were gathered into one place the firmamental abys s had been ope ned, and a basis laid for the astronom ical mythol ogy or uranogr aphi c representation. T he same beginni ng with the unc reated undi vided Nun, as in the Egypt ian myth and Babyl oni an legend, is appa rent in the book of Genesis. The Nun, or Nnu, was the firma - 400 mental water. This is “the water” of the Hebrew version; the water on which darkne s s broode d and from which the spirit of the Elohi m emerged; the water that was divided into the uppe r and low er firmaments, as an act of so - called “creation. ” The Nun was likewise the celestial water of the Akka dians and Babyl oni ans, as well as the Egypt ian s. When Nuna or Anuna signi fies the sky that is as the primordial water, the same as in the Kamite Nnu or Nun. The Irish firmament or celestial water is also called the Nion, an equi valent for the Kamite Nun. The first three of the seven pow ers bor n of th e Kamite mother of the elements were represented by Sut the pow er of darkne ss, Horus the pow er of light , and Shu the pow er of the air or breathing force. These three Ali or Elohi m appe ar in the ope ning statement of Genesis. Though unpe rsoni fied, they are p resent as the primary elemental pow ers. In the Hebrew beginni ng, darkness broode d on the face of the deep, and the spirit of the Elohi m move d upon the waters. The beginni ng, therefore, is with night or darkne ss. The spirit of Elohi m was the breathing force of Shu or the breeze of dawn. The name of Tefnut , who was bor n twin with him, denot es the dews of dawn. Thus the pow ers or elements of dawn emerged from out the darkne ss of the firmamental deep with Shu and Tefnut as the elemental pow ers of breath and liq uid life. The next two offspring of Neb - er - ter, the All - one in the Egypt ian account of creation, are Seb and Nut, or earth and heaven. These were unf ormulated by night , but the two were separated by Shu at dawn when Nut was lifted up from Seb, and heaven a nd earth were thus created or distingui shed in the onl y pos sible way. It is this “beginni ng” that was follow ed in the book of Genesis and in what has been made to look like a cosmical creation of the phys ical uni verse. This creation is a representation of natural phenom ena which might have been seen any day and night . But the gods of Egyp t have been defeatured and dislimned and resolved into their elements of darkne ss and the firmamental deep, the breeze of Shu,"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"the moisture of Tefnut; and the earth of Seb distinguished from the heaven of Nut. The action of the spirit moving on the waters had been perfectly expr essed in the Egypt ian version, when Neb - er - ter says that he created by means of divine soul , and that in foundi ng a place where he coul d obtain foot hold, he “worked with the spirit which was in his breast.” This, according to Egypt ian thought , was the breathing spirit first divinized in Shu as the pow er of the air or animistic soul of life. In the Hebrew version the elements of earth, heaven, darkne ss , light , water, spirit (or breathing force) are directly called into being, whereas in the Egypt ian, four of these com e into existence or are made appa rent by means of divine type s. Shu was the figure of breathing force with which the darkne ss was disperse d at dawn. This likewise was the breathing spirit with which Neb - er - ter created. In a vigne tte copi ed by Maspero ( Daw n of Civilization, p. 169 ) Shu is accom panied by a group of gods in lifting up the firmament. There are seven altoge ther, chief of whom is Shu himself standi ng unde rneath the upr aised heaven. These seven as the Ali who are co - workers with Shu are equi valent to the Elohi m in the Hebrew book . Shu is called the separator of heaven from the 401 earth, the elevator of heaven for millions of year s above the earth. He is the conque ror of chaos and the proge ny of darkne ss. Instead of the Elohi m saying, “Let there be light ” with this upl ifting of the firmament, the Egypt ian version represents Shu first as raising the firmament and next as bringi ng Ra his eyes to see with after the noc turnal heaven had been raised. In a Japanese account of creation the starting - poi nt is also with the upl ifting of the heaven from the earth. In the preface to the Japanese Kojiki this beginni ng with the separation of heav en and earth is described by Yasum aro, the editor: “Heaven and earth first parted, and the three Kam i performed the com mencement of creation. The passive and active essences then develope d, and the two spirits became the ancestors of all things .” These two are identified with Izanagi and Izanami in the Japanese system, and with the Yin and Yang in the Chinese. The three Kami called the “ alone bor n Kam i, who hid their beings ,” are one with Sut, Horus, and Shu, whilst the twin brother and sister are identical with Shu and Tefnut , who represented breathing pow er, or air, and moisture, as the two halves of a soul of life — Shu of breathing, Tefnut of liqui d life, the active and passive essences which blende d and became the creative spirit movi ng on the face of the firmament. In Genesis the pow ers of darkne ss and light are present when the drama ope ns, not as pow ers personi fied, but as elements. “Darkne ss was upon the face of the deep,” and the Elohi m said, “Let there be light .” These, as Sut and Horus, were the fir st of the primordial pow ers in an elemental pha se, the black Neh being the bird of night or Sut, and the solar hawk of Horus the bird of day. There was Sut the pow er of darkne ss on the one hand, and on the other Horus the hawk of light ; these are equi valen t to “there was evening and there was morning one day.” It is not iceable, too, that the Hebrew word for evening, bri , is also the name for the raven, the black bird of Sut. It is said in later texts that these nature - pow ers were derived from the primeval s tuff or matter of the Nun, which means that they originated in and were embodi ed from the phys ical elements, such as Sut from darkne ss, Horus from light , Shu from air, Hapi from water, Kabhs enuf from the solar fire, Tuamutef from earth, Amsta from the moth er - blood ."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":" Certain matters of mythol ogy were differently manipul ated in various versions of the mythos . The process had already begun in Egypt . In the creation performed by Kheper - Neb - er - ter the first two pow ers produc ed as breathing force and moisture, or wind and water, are divinized in Shu and Tefnut . The next two are Seb the god of earth and Nut the godde ss of heaven. These are now portrayed in the after - thought as having been emaned or emitted from the body of the one Supr eme Being who had now becom e t he Lord ove r all, whereas in an earlier myth the earth and heaven came into existence or were discreted when Shu upr aised the heaven, or Nut, and separated her from Seb the god of earth. The com ing into being of these four , Shu and Tefnut , Seb and Nut, is traceable in the Hebrew Genesis, but in a different mode and order of setting forth. “In the beginni ng Elohi m created the heaven and the earth.” These in the original are Nut and Seb, who were divided from each other (not created) and permanently proppe d a part by Shu and the suppor ting 402 pow ers or Elohi m. But, instead of a cosmogoni cal creation, the Egypt ian wisdom show s that the making of heaven and earth was a mode of representation in the astronom ical mythol ogy. Som e hints of this natural origin may be gathered from the Babyl oni an fragm ents of legenda ry lore. In the first tablet of the Chaldean account of creation, rende red by Talbot , the process is partially described ( Records of the Past, vol . IX, 117) . It is said of the Creator, “He fixed up cons te llations , whos e figur es were like animals.” It is also said on the seventh tablet, “At that time the gods in their assembly created (the beasts). They made perfect the might y (mons ters).” These, as is show n by the cont ext, were figur es of the cons tellation s. But in the Hebrew rende ring the living creatures of the water, air, earth, or other element have been literalized, whereas they were as much figur es in the astronom ical mythol ogy as were the two firmaments, the abys s, or the cons tellated light s of heave n. The Chaldean account of creation also describes the cons truction of “dw ellings for the great gods .” These were celestial habitations , as we say “hous es” of the sun and moon. In the Kamite creation by Ptah they are called the shrines of the gods . “He for med the gods , he made the tow ns, he designe d the nom es, he placed the gods in their shrines which he had prepared for them” ( Inscription of Shabak a, lines 6, 7). Thus “creation” in this pha se was a mode of representation in the heavens. It began with the a bys s and the water, the creatures of the abys s, such as the Sout hern Fish and Ketos, the Water - serpent, and other “cons tellations whos e figur es were in the likeness of animals”: and the habitations of the gods that were bui lt upon “a glorious founda tion. ” When the abys s had not been made, and Eridu had not yet been cons tructed, it is said that the whol e of the lands were water. But when a stream was figur ed within the firmamental sea, “in that day Eridu was made; E - Sagila was constructed which the god Luga l - Du - Azaga had founde d within the abys s.” Two earthly cities were bui lt upon a heavenly mode l, and the earthly Eridu corresponde d to a celestial or divine original. Thus the earliest seats of civilization founde d in Babyl oni a were mode lled on cities that we re already celestial and therefore cons idered to be of divine origin; the seats in heaven that were founde d first in the astronom ical mythol ogy, as we hol d, of Egypt. But it was not the genesis of the universe that is imaged in astronom ical mythol ogy. The firmament was there, already waiting to be distingui shed as uppe r and"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"low er, and divided into the dom ains of night and day, or Sut and Horus, or Ansar and Kisar. The cons tellations were not created from nothing when they were figured out of stars. The fir mamental water was not created by being divided into uppe r and low er. The earth was not created because distingui shed from water as ground to go upon . Darkne ss was not created when it was por trayed as a devour ing dragon. The pol e of heaven was not created in being represented by a tree or mount or altar - mound . Heaven and earth existed when these were nameless, and did not com e into existence on account of being named. Things were not created when images were assigne d to them, nor because names were conf erre d upon them. The conf usion of names and things is mode rn, not ancient; Aryan, not African. 403 The starting - poi nt of a beginni ng was from the Nun, the firmamental water, which encircled all the world with the aërial ocean of surroundi ng space. This was the world all water. The earth was imaged mentally, thence figur ed mythically, as a fixed and solid subs tance in the waters of the Nun. These have been mixed up toge ther by recent writers in a watery mass or mush of primordial matter, from which the cosmos is assum ed to have been solidified or created out of chaos. But that is an exot eric misinterpretation of the ancient wisdom . There was no such creation. The earth stood on its ow n founda tion in the low er Nun. The name of earth or land in Egypt ian is Ta. H ence, land or earth in the Nun is “Ta - nen,” which is the name of the earth in the waters of the Nun, the low er earth of the Egypt ian Tanen. Tanen as a locality was earlier than Amenta, and the name was cont inue d in the title of Ptah - Tanen, the ope ner of th e earth, which had been founde d in the Nun by the order of gods or pow ers called the “Nunu, ” as fellow - males, and a form of the first com pany, who were seven in num ber. In the Hebrew account of creation, the earth and firmament were already extant, but “th e earth was waste and voi d; and darkne ss was on the face of the deep.” Therefore the beginni ng is with the formlessness of the unf eatured Nun. Darkness existed. Light came forth. The light was then divided from the darkne ss as a mode of differentiating and describing day and night . Next, the uppe r firmament was separated from the low er, or, as it is otherwise stated, the waters above were divided from the waters below ; whereas in the genui ne mythos the uppe r and low er waters were the uppe r and low er firmame nt because the water was a figur e of the firmament. Then follow s the formation of the abys s, the waters “unde r heaven” being gathered toge ther unt o one “place” — the same as in the Chaldean account of creation (first tablet, line 5). The dry land is made to appe ar. “And the Elohi m called the dry land, earth, and the gathering toge ther of the waters they called seas.” In the beginni ng, then, was the unformed firmament or unc reated Nun. This was the uni versal, undi vided water of the mythos and the legends . Cre ation, as uranogr aphi c formation, follow ed in the astronom ical sign - langua ge. A stream was seen and figur ed in the atmosphe ric ocean as a dividing line. The firmament was discreted into uppe r and low er. In the low er the celestial abys s was formed. This was figured, as the Chaldean and Semitic legends tell us, when the waters were gathered into one place and were given the cons tellation of The Water as their uranogr aphi c sign in astronom ical mythol ogy. According to Esdras (II Es. VI. 41 - 2), the waters were “ gathered in the seventh part of the earth.” In this seventh part, “where the waters were gathered"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"toge ther,” the two mons ters of the deep were figured, which are here called “Enoc h and Leviathan,” who represent the water and dry land, as do Leviathan and B ehemoth in the book of Enoc h, and whos e images, as we have suggested, still survive in “the sout hern fish” and the mons ter “Ketos.” Taking the foot hol d of earth as a basis of beginning, there was nought around it but the firmamental water of space. This wa s without form or voi d throughout pre - cons tellationa l time. In an Aztec version of the beginni ng earth is separated from the waters in the form or unde r the type of shell - fish emerging from the deep. In 404 other legends , one of which is Japanese, this s hell - fish was the earth - tortoise amidst the waters. The earth emerging from the waters unde r the fish - type is cons tellated, as we show , in the gasping “Ketos,” or it was represented by the hippopot amus which came up from the water to bring forth its young upon dry ground. The firmament at first was thought of as water raised on high. In the Hebrew Genesis the water is one with the firmament. This celestial water was figured by the Egypt ians as a lake, the largest water know n to Inne r Africa. In Greece the firmamental water became the Okeanos of Hom er, flow ing round the earth. It is the water that was first divided in twain. If we call the one water a lake, we find the one was divided into two lakes, one to the sout h and one to the nor th of the circum pol ar e nclosure. The Okeanos was divided by a river that encircled all the earth. This is visible in the river of the Milky Way. In the Ritual it is called “the stream which has no end. ” It is also described as “the stream of the lake in Sekhet - Hetep” or paradise (ch. 149) . Further, the two lakes are por trayed as “the lake of Sa and the lake of the northern sky (Rit., ch. 153 , A ). It was obs erved that a stream came forth from the great lake in a white river that divided the one water into two great lakes. In this we see “the stream of the lake in the Sekhe t - Hetep,” just as “the river went out of Eden to water the garden.” As previous ly said, the Babyl oni an account s of the so - called creation did not begin as cosmogoni cal. They are legends of the first time, when as yet the heavens were not mappe d out to illustrate the mythol ogy. There were no type s yet cons tellated in the firmament. The glorious dw elling of the gods was not yet bui lt. The abys s was not yet formed; the waters were not yet gathered into one place. The y were uni versal. The whol e of the lands were sea, or the celestial water of the Nun. There was no stream or Via Lactea limned in the aërial vast. The uppe r region was not yet called heaven; the low er region was not yet called earth. Then the dw ellings wer e cons tructed (in heaven) for the great gods . Cons tellations were fixed up whos e figures were like ani mals. One of the figur es cons tellated is that of the Great Mother, Tiamat. As it is said in the Assyrian story, “Then the Lord measured the offspring of t he deep (Tiamat); the chief prophe t made of her image the hous e of the firmam ent.” So in the Egypt ian mythos the hous e of the firmament had been made in the image of Nut, the cow of heaven, or previous ly of Apt, the water - cow . In the Egypt ian doc um ents cre ation generally is attribut ed to Ptah, the first form of the god who was lord of all; one of whos e zoot ype s was the beetle, as a figur e of the former or the moul der of matter, which preceded the anthropom orphi c image of the pot ter. Kheper was a title of Pt ah as the former. The Egypt ian word Kheper signi fies formation, causing to assum e a shape, as when the pot ter moul ds his clay or the"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"beetle rolls its eggs up in a ball of earth. Ptah is portrayed as a beetle in the matrix of matter shaping the produc t. At this stage the seven elemental forces enter his service as the moul ders who are called his seven assistants or associate - gods , the Ali=Elohi m. In one of the hym ns it is said to Ptah, as Tanen, “There was given to thee a pow er ove r the things of earth that were in a state of inertness, and thou didst gather them toge ther after thou didst exist in thy form of 405 Ta - tanen, in becom ing the uni ter of the doubl e earth, which thy word of mout h begot and which thy hands have fashione d.” This was in making the lo wer earth of the Nun as the ground floor of Amenta, when the com mand to “let the earth com e into being” was uttered by the God. It is also said, “When the heaven and earth were not as yet created, and when the waters had not yet com e forth, thou didst kni t toge ther the earth; thou didst find thys elf in the condi tion of the one who made his seat and who fashione d, or moul ded, the two earths” (Budge , Gods of the Egyptians , vol . I, pp. 509 - 10) or who dupl icated the earth. In the Egypt ian mythos Ptah was the g reat architect of the uni verse. But not the uni verse as a cosmologi cal creation. The building, so to call it, was begun when the two pillars of the sout h and north were raised up by Sut and Horus, in that creation “of the first time” which is ascribed to S ut on the stele of the Sphi nx, and in the creations that were indi cated by the “upl iftings of Shu” or the uni ting of the doub le hor izon by Har - Makhu. Various structures and structural alterations preceded the work of Ptah, the architect of the doubl e earth and finisher of the bui lding on a new founda tion perfected for all eternity. Creation in the book of Genesis is described as an event, or a series of events, occurring onc e upon a time and onc e for all, whereas the genui ne mythos represents the natural ph enom ena as cons tantly recurring. The earth was seen emerging every morning from the firmamental water, but not onc e for all. Darkne ss was seen rising up and coiling like som e black reptile round about the earth at night , but not onc e for all. When Shu divi ded heaven and earth, or Nut from Seb at morning, this went on for ever: Nut descende d on a visit to her love r every night . There was a first time to the uranogr aphi c representation of the myth as Egyp tian, but not to the phe nom ena in external nature. In a sense there was no Horus or Orion in the heavens either figur ed or named unt il the type was cons tellated by the mystery - teachers, but the group of stars was always there ready to be called into being by name in what is termed “creation,” or the astronom ic al mythol ogy. As Egypt ian, then, the only creation of the heavens and the earth was mythical, not cosmologi cal. It was uranogr aphi c formation, not the making of matter. But to show how the mythical creation was rende red cosmogoni cally we have onl y to take the title of Kheper - Ptah in his character of “Let - the - earth - be,” or let the hidde n earth com e into being. This in the Genesis becom es “Let the dry land appe ar (I, 9, 10) , and the Elohi m called the dry land earth.” There is an Egypt ian account of “creation ” to be found in the Papyr us of Nes - Amsu (British Museum , No. 10, 188 ), which was written for a priest of Panopol is in the thirteenth year of “Alexande r the son of Alexande r,” or about B.C. 312. It is called “The Book of Know ing the Evol utions of Ra, and t he Overthrow al of Apap.” It pur por ts to cont ain the words that were spoke n by Neb - er - ter, a title of Osiris, the entire or all - one -"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"god, as lord ove r all. There are two versions of the legend. In the first the creator - god is Kheper - Ptah. In the second he is Osiris; the same legend being appl ied in two different cults, at Memphi s and Abydos . In the second version Osiris - Neb - er - ter is the speaker as creator. He says, “I produc ed 406 myself from primeval matter. Osiris is my name. There existed no created thi ngs in this land. ” A land is here described in which the plants and creeping things of earth had no existence. Neb - er - ter was alone by himself in that land, and there was no other being who worked with him in that land. This was in Tanen, the nether earth of Ptah. The beetle - headed Ptah was the Egypt ian creator in his primary form, the so - called maker of the heaven and the earth, but in a creation that was not cosmogoni cal. These, then, are the words that were also spoke n in the first version by Kheper - Ptah , who formed the earth of eternity and discreted the two earths in the making of Amenta, on his com ing into existence, when, according to the current phraseology, neither heaven nor earth was yet extant, and when the soil of earth, the plants and creeping things of earth, had not yet been created in that land. Kheper - Ptah then found a co - worker in the godde ss Mâ, the Egypt ian Wisdom , whom the present writer had previous ly identified with the Hebrew Kochm ah in “A Book of the Beginni ngs .” Working with Mâ deno tes creation according to eternal law or unde viating rule. Evidence for the non - cosmogoni cal nature of Kheper - Ptah’s creation may be gathered from the fact that the celestial bodi es, sun, moon, and stars, were not among the things that were called into be ing by him. The sun as “the eye of Nu,” the Nun or firmament, and the primeval matter of the paut were pre - extant. Nor doe s either of the two versions mention the creation of birds, or beasts, or cattle. Moreove r, a male - god who existed alone in the Nun as Kheper the begetter or father - god is impos sible on the face of the inscription, because Nu the god of the celestial water was already extant in the character of a begetter. Kheper calls him “my father Nu,” and the solar orb is also called “the eye of Nu.” Besides which Kheper - Ptah was preceded by several dyna sties of deities, luna r, stellar, or elemental. The Put - com pany of the nine gods was preceded by that of the eight ; the eight by that of the seven Ali, or associates; the seven Uræus - divinities; the se ven Khut i; and these by the mothers Apt, Neith, Tefnut , and the seven cow s or Hathor s. The founda tion of monot heism was laid when the various pow ers were com bined in a singl e deity to be worshippe d as the one true eternal spirit. These were primarily the Great Mother and her seven elemental pow ers. And when the godde ss was supe rseded by the god Ptah, bot h sexes were include d in the one Supr eme Being who was now the Lord ove r all. It was the same with Osiris, as the pictures show . Asar was the mother and ch ild (Hes - Ar) in one , and the perfect triune type was com pleted in God the father. There was no God the father without God the mother and God the child. In the mythol ogi cal text from Memphi s we read of Ptah in his divine forms. In one of these he is designa ted “Ptah of the earth.” “The Mother giving birth to Atum and his associate - gods ” (line 14) . Ptah of the earth was then “in the great resting - place” as the maker of Amenta. This was the place of that new creation and rearrange ment of the things that were p re - extant before the time of Ptah the ope ner, and this one god who was latest is"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"now cons idered to be the sour ce of all the gods and godde sses who had preceded him. Ptah became the god who was bor n of his ow n becom ing, or of his ow n self - 407 originating force, and who came into existence in the person of his ow n son — as a mode of representing the eternal manifesting in the sphe re of time. According to the school of thought , the male had been subs tituted for the mother as the begetter in matter. Hence the beetle of Kheper in this pha se of male - creator can be seen in the great French work on Egypt , a copy of which may be cons ulted in the British Museum . In these pictures, as in the legend of creation translated by Dr. Budge , the imagery show s with sufficient plainne ss how creative sour ce was figur ed in the likeness of male nature. This has been rende red with all its naked crudi ty, but needs the gnos is for an expl anation. By the gnos is here is meant that science of Egypt ian sym bol ism which alone enables us to read the palimpsest of the past that was scribbl ed ove r and ove r again by the teachers of the ancient wisdom . For example, Kheper in the pictures is the male, as beetle, who emanes the matter of creation from his ow n body , as doe s the spider or the silkw or m. In the later legend of Ra and Apap the anthropom orphi c type replaced the beetle; Kheper has been imaged in the likeness of a masturbating male, and then the act has been attribut ed in reality to the black - skinne d race (Budge , Gods of the Egyptians , vol . I, p. 304. ) But as the beetle was a pre - anthropom orphi c type of Kheper, we might ask if that also was a masturbating male, as the produc er of matter from itself? So necessary is the gnos is of the primitive sign - langua ge for the reading of these remains, t o prevent debasement of the type and perversion of the meaning. After com ing into being himself Kheper - Ptah is called the creator of all things that came into being. And here, if anyw here, we may identify the Word that was in the beginni ng, and was God. F or Kheper says he brought his name into his ow n mout h; he uttered it as the word that was in the beginni ng. Other things were spoke n or called into being by the word of his mout h. Of these things he says, “I raised them up from out of the Nun (or Nu) and f rom a state of inertia.” He had found no place where he coul d stand. But he laid a founda tion with Mâ, who, as we know , became the co - worker with Ptah the divine artificer. In version B. of the Egypt ian doc um ent the creator, as Kheper, says, “I made what I made by means of divine soul ; I worked with the spirit,” which is the action assigne d to the Elohi m, how ever differently stated. Soul , it is said in one of the texts, is “the breath of the gods ” (Budge , Gods of the Egyptians , vol . I, ch. 8). Creation by m eans of the word was the work of Ptah in his character of “Let the earth exist.” Stated in mode rn langua ge, he might be said to have called his creations into being by word of mout h in uttering the word to his co - workers. This word, as Egypt ian, was the we ll - know n Hekau or great magical word of pow er, which was female before it was assigne d to the deity as male; the living word of Apt; the great magic pow er of Isis or of Mâ, before it was ascribed to Ptah in the monot heism of Memphi s. Creation by the word i s calling into being things which did not pre - exist or were not previous ly entified, figur ed, or know n by name. In the Ritual the word of pow er becom es a ceremoni al act, and, as a mode of sign - 408"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":" langua ge, to be said or uttered magically, is to be perf ormed. Creation by the word is expr essed in the character of Ptah by his title of “Let - the - earth - be.” This is the creation by fiat, or the word, in the book of Genesis, when the Elohi m say, “Let there be light ” — “Let there be a firmament” — “Let the dry land appear” — “Let the earth put forth grass” — “Let the earth bring forth” — “Let us make man in our image” — and it was so. The word and act were one . And this was the Kamite creation by the word that was in the beginni ng; the word of Kheper - Ptah, who said, “Let the earth com e into existence” — that is, the low er of the two, called Amenta, the secret earth. This mode of calling and com ing into being by means of the word expl ains how the god coul d issue forth from silence as a word, how created things or beings coul d be said to have emanated from the mouth of the god, and how the divine wisdom , whether as Mâ or Kochm ah, coul d be said to com e out of the mout h of the most high. It is know n that the name was often held to be an equi valent for the thing, the act, or person, and in the text from Memphi s the creation by Ptah is in a measure resolved into a process of naming. In this it is said, “Now the creation of all the gods (that is to say, of Atum and his associate - gods ) was when proclamation was made of all the divine nam es in his wisdom ” — the wisdom of Ptah. Thus things , in this case gods , or pow ers, were created when names were given to them. The principle is appl ied in the book of Genesis, when it is said that “out of the ground Iahu - Elohi m formed every beast of the fiel d and every fow l of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he woul d call them. And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fow l of the air, and to every beast of the field” (ch. II, 19 - 20). In these and other texts creation is reduc ed to a p rocess of naming as a mode of representation, and in this way the uranogr aphi c mythology was founde d on the figur ing and naming of the cons tellations . When the Supr eme Being had been imaged or personi fied, the pow ers previous ly extant were represented as his offspring, his names, or members of his body. Hence the seven associate - god s, the Ali or Elohi m, are now called the limbs, joints, the hands , the finge rs, the lips, the teeth, the breath of the god, or, reversely stated, these parts of the one god beco me the associate gods , as a sevenfold emanation from Kheper - Ptah. “Now Ptah was satisfied after his making of all things , and conf erring all the divine names. He formed the gods , he made the tow ns, he designe d the nom es, he placed the gods in their shrines . He made their com pany flour ish.” “All the limbs move d when he uttered the word of wisdom which came forth from the tongue and worked a blessing upon all things .” The word (lit. speech ) became the making of men and the creation of gods for Ptah - Tatanen - Se pu. “Let - the - earth - be” is one of the titles of Ptah as the god who calls the earth into existence. Which looks , at first sight , like a cosmogr aphi cal creation. But the earth which was evol ved by Ptah and his associate - gods , the Ali, Phœ nician Elohi m, is n ot this world, not our earth. If it were, it woul d not be the doubl e earth, the earth that was dupl icated in the making of Amenta. In the text from Memphi s (line 6) it is said that “Ptah was satisfied after making all things , all the divine names.” He saw that it was good, and this 409 "},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"satisfaction of the creator in his work is repeated in the book of Genesis. Seven times ove r Elohi m saw that the work was good , and like Ptah, or the Put - com pany of gods , he or they were satisfied. But the making of Amenta by Ptah and the great paut of gods or Ali was an actual creation of imagination, not a mere “calling” of things into existence by naming them. It was also the creation of an earth, but not of the earth on which we stand. It was know n as Ta - nen, the earth i n the Nun; also as the low er earth distingui shed from the uppe r earth, to which it was adde d when the earth was dupl icated as the work of Ptah and the associate - gods . The firmament of uppe r earth was raised aloft by Shu, when establishing the pol e of Am Kh emen. The firmament of the nether earth was lifted up by Ptah. This was celebrated as his suspension of the sky. But the low er firmament is the sky that was raised up by him in Amenta, the earth of eternity, not in the uppe r earth of time. Thus , the creat ion of Amenta was not the com mencement of the external uni verse, although anot her heaven and earth were then called into being. At first there was no heaven and no earth in this unf ormulated realm of desert darkne ss. Or, as the Hebrew version has it, “the earth was waste and void.” There was no light of day or lamp of night , as neither sun nor moon coul d pass that way unt il the earth was hol low ed out and a sky suspende d ove rhead by Ptah the ope ner and his Ali, or com panions , who were afterwards repeated in the Elohi m of the Hebrew Genesis. So in the enclosure of Yima there was at first no light of stars, or moon , or sun. This was the condi tion of primeval darkne ss in which the Elohi m said, “Let there be light , and there was light .” The que stion being where a nd how ? In the making of Amenta Ptah was the upl ifter of the low er firmament, with which he roofed the unde r - world within the earth. This is recogni zed in the Ritual (ch. 64) , when the speaker dow n in Amenta says, “Mine is the radiance in which Ptah floate th ove r his firmament” — that is, the light of this new heaven and earth, which were solely a creation of astronom ical mythol ogy . In anot her text we read, “Hail to thee, Ptah - Tanen. The heaven was yet unc reated, uncreated was the earth, the water flow ed not ; thou has t put toge ther the earth, thou hast uni ted thy limbs, thou hast reckone d thy members; what thou hast found apart, thou hast put into its place. O let us give glory to the god who hath raised up the sky, and who causeth his disk to float ove r the b osom of Nut, who hath made the gods and men and all their generations , who hath made all lands and count ries, and the great sea, in his name of Let - the - earth - be” (cited by Renouf , Hibbe rt Lectures, pp. 222 - 3). This, being late, has the look of cosmology . B ut the sky raised up by Ptah was ove r the earth in Amenta; the sky that was imaged by the sign of heaven reversed. When Ra is being exalted above all previous gods in the glosses to the seventeenth chapter of the Ritual it is said that he had exercised his sove reignt y as Unen the ope ner when there was as yet no firmament. That is before Ptah had created the firmament below the earth, which is called the “lower firmament” in the Babyl oni an legends of creation. This beginni ng with the raising of the firmament is allude d to in the name of the gate - keeper to the second hall in the Hous e of Osiris, who is designa ted “Him who raised up or created 410 the beginni ng” (Rit., 147, 7). But, as before show n, there were two upliftings of the firmament, one above the ea rth and one below ."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":" There is hierogl yphi c evidence that the Egypt ian creation of the earth by Ptah was not cosmical but a mode of hol low ing out Amenta in the low er earth, and of tunne lling the mount to make a passage through. The sign for Ta, the earth, is a hol low tube , a pipe, a reed, or the tibia (leg - bone ). Thus , a passage hol low ed out is an ideogr aph of the earth that was formed by Ptah and his Knemmu, the moul ders. It was the tunne l of Ptah with its gates of entrance and exit that first gave signi fica nce to the expr ession, “the ends of the earth.” The manes in the Ritual who has passed through exclaims, “I have com e out of the Tuat: I am com e from the ends of the earth” (ch. 75, 1). The ope ning of Amenta was a primitive mode of thinking through the gro und of solid earth, as it stood in the waters of the Nun, and of making out a pathw ay for the sun or solar god to travel by in passing through from one hor izon to the other. Thus , the making of Amenta was a work of imagination based upon a ground of natura l fact. Before the earth was know n to float and revol ve in space, it was thought of as a fixture like a mount ain or an island, a tree or a stalk of papyr us standi ng in the firmamental water. Then it was made out , as mythically rende red, that som ehow the su n passed through the unde r - world of earth by night . This was por trayed in several ways. In one , a tortoise was the type . With Kheper - Ptah, the beetle was the bur row er in and through the hidde n earth. Ptah, as the divine worker, shaper, or creator in this s ubt erranean world, was also imaged by an embryo - in - utero as way - maker in the wom b of matter, or the earth. Fire was anot her solar type . Hence Ptah was the worker with that element, and his associate - gods became the blacksmiths and metallurgists, who blazed their way below from west to east through Tanen, earlier Tanun , termed the earth of Ptah. Then follow ed Ra in his primordial sove reignt y as Atum , son of Ptah. He crosses (later) in the solar bark that sailed the Urnas water by night . But first of all he h ad to wriggle through the mud of the abys s in the likeness of an eel. Before Amenta had been moul ded by the Put - cycle of pow ers there was a secret and infertile earth conc eived of in the Nun, where not hing grew and nought was cultivated, as no soil or sat a had been yet prepared, and no light had then appe ared. But this earth of eternity was not the world of hum an life, and cons eque ntly no human beings were created in Amenta. Atum , though a man in form, was not a hum an being. This will expl ain why neither m an nor wom an was created or formed by Kheper - Ptah, in the Book of Know ing the Evol utions of Ra. There was no man or wom an in the genui ne mythos . These onl y came into existence when the gods and manes had been euhe merized and creation was set forth as cosmo goni cal through literalization of the astronom ical mythol ogy and adul teration of the ancient wisdom . It has been assum ed by som e Egypt ologists that the two earths, or the doubl e earth, were limited to the division of space into sout h and north by the pass age of the sun from east to west. But in the making of Amenta the one earth was divided into uppe r and low er, with a firmament or sky to each, and thus the earth was dupl icated; 411 hence the making of Amenta was the creation of a doubl e earth or an eart h that was doubl ed. An apt illustration of this doubl e earth may be seen in the vigne ttes to the papyr us of Ani, where scenes in the uppe r - earth life are por trayed at the head of the page, with scenes in the life of Amenta unde rneath. Thus on pages 5 and 6 the fune ral"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"procession of Ani is to be seen wendi ng its way to the sepul chre, carrying the laid - out mum my, whilst Ani as the manes is to be seen on his jour ney through the nether earth accom panied by Tutu, his wife in spirit - world. The nether earth, when not yet excavated, was a world of solid darkne ss, because unvi sited by sun or moon . When Amenta was hol low ed out by Ptah it was for his son Atum , who is Ra at his first appe arance in Amenta as the solar god, the first to pass through this realm of subt err anean night . Naturally when the sun appe ared “there was light ,” and darkne ss with its hos t of evil pow ers fled, as related in the legenda ry lore. It is to this old netherland of darkne ss, with no out let, that the godde ss Ishtar descende d in search of the w ater of life. It was a land without an exit, through which no passage had been made; from whos e visitants, the dead, the light was shut out . “The light they behol d not , in darkne ss they dw ell.” “Dust is their bread; their food is mud. ” Still the secret sou rce of water, and thence of life, was hidde n in that land. This was the world of the gnom es, the gobl ins, and other elemental sprites, which, as Egypt ian, are sum med up, unde r the serpent - type , as seven Uræus - pow ers bor n in the nether earth (Rit., ch. 83). As Babyl oni an they were the seven “spirits of earth,” or Anunna ki. The beginning in this region was with the abys s inside the earth from whence the water welled that was to be most sacredly preserved as very sour ce itself. This subt erranean realm had som e what the character of a mine with the water welling upw ard from the unpl um bed depths below . It was a mine of hidde n treasure, one form of which was gol d. But first of all the treasure was water, the primary element of life. Hence a fount of the water of li fe was localized in the well of this unde r - world which the Egypt ians divinized as the Neter - Kar because it was the cour se of water and the way by which life came into the world. Here the spirits of earth, the pow ers of Khar, the Assyrian Anunna ki, were por trayed as watchers ove r the water of life and protectors of the hidde n treasures unde rground. It was these spirits of earth that peopl ed our mines and became the jealous gua rdians of their metals. These were the elemental spirits, not the spirits of the de ad who were worshippe d as the hum an ancestors; the gods , not the glorified. It is distinctly stated in the great Harris papyr us (plate 44, lines 4 and 6) that Ptah the ope ner “formed the hol low of the unde r - world, so that the sun coul d pas s through as revi vifier of the dead; and that he also encircled the earth with the firmamental water on which the solar bark might ride all round .” The sun - god here was Atum in his eschatologi cal character. Also, in a hym n to the earlier elemental pow ers found upon the wal ls of the temple in the oasis of El - Khargeh, it is said to Ptah, “Thou hast made the doubl e earth. Thou hast placed thy throne in the life of the doubl e earth. Thy soul is the four fold pillar and the ark of the two heavens.” Ptah the excavator of the nethe r earth is now the bui lder of the ark in which the dead are bor ne 412 across the waters of Amenta to the other world. The speaker in this character (Rit., ch. I) says, “I am the arch - craftsman on the day in which the ship of Sekari, or the coffined one ( whether as Ptah or Osiris), is laid upon the stocks.” This was represented in a ceremony at Memphi s, where the coffin, ark, or shrine of the god was placed upon a sledge and drawn in a procession round and round the great sanctuary when the drama of the re surrection was performed."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":" It was as the maker of Amenta that Ptah became the architect of the uni verse. When com pleted, the Egyp tian uni verse cons isted of heaven, earth, and the unde r - world, but it was not finished unt il he had formed the unde r - world or m ade the nether earth and heaven. Then Ptah, as the maker of Amenta, was called the architect of the uni verse. The tat - sym bol , which was erected in Amenta as a type of eternal stability, was the backbone of Ptah as a figure of the god who was now the verteb ral colum n and sustaining pow er, unde r, as well as ove r, all. The tat was also dupl icated to form the gateway of eternity in the region of Tattu, when the doubl e tats took the place of the two pillars of Sut and Horus in the hous e of Ptah. Ptah is describe d as the former of the egg of the sun and the moon . He is depicted in one of the representations , at Philæ, sitting at the pot ter’s wheel in the act of giving shape to an egg (Rosellini, Mon. del Culto, 21) . But this is not to be taken literally. The repre sentation is sym bol ical. Ptah was the creator of the circle in which the sun and moon revol ved, when the passage through the unde r - world was finished; and the egg is a hierogl yphi c sign of the circle, which circle was also a figur e of the eternal pathw ay. This solar pathw ay made by Ptah reminds one of Vaugha n’s magni ficent image: “I saw eternity the other night, Like a vast ring of pure and endless light.” Now , no Egypt ologi st whos e work is know n to the present writer has ever discriminated betwix t the “making of Amenta” and the cosmologi cal creation in the Hebrew book of Genesis, which is a chief obj ect of the present section. In his work on The Daw n of Civilization (Eng. tr., pp. 16 - 19) M. Maspero has given a version of what he suppos es the Egypt ians thought of the earth. He tells us “they imagined the whol e uni verse to be a large box, nearly rectangul ar in form, whos e greatest diameter was from sout h to nor th, and its least from east to west. The earth with its alternate cont inents and seas forme d the bot tom of the box; it was a narrow , obl ong , and slight ly conc ave floor, with Egypt in its centre.” M. Maspero’s obl ong box, which is longe st from the sout h to the nor th, is just a figur e of the Nile valley, reproduced in the nether earth of Amenta as a mythical locality, not as a picture of the universe. He has taken the cove r off Amenta and expos ed its depths to the stars of heaven, as if it were the cavity of an immeasurable crater, and has left no ceiling to the low er earth, no nether sky of Nut fo r the sun to traverse when it was day in the unde r - world; cons eque ntly he has failed to reproduc e the doubl e earth that was the creation of Ptah and his co - workers. The creation of Amenta by Ptah the ope ner was the cutting, carving, and hol low ing out of t he earth as tunne l for the heavenly bodi es and the manes, which were now to make the passage through 413 instead of round the mount . This for the first time rende rs the funda mental meaning of the Hebrew Bara ( a r B ) to create, as when it is said (Gen. I. 1) that the Elohi m created the heaven and the earth. Bara, appl ied to the creation of the world by the Elohi m, signi fies to cut, carve, fashion, and, in the form of Bari, to divide. The Elohim are the Ali or com panions who, as the Knemmu or moul ders with Ptah the ope ner, were the cutters, carvers, or pot ters, as fashione rs of Amenta in the work of dividing the uppe r from the"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"low er earth. The divine creation of the world resolves itself into the creation attribut ed to Ptah the ope ner and his co - workers the Ali, who divided the earth into uppe r and low er, and thus created, shaped, or moul ded a nether world as the secret earth of eternity, the next world made tangi ble for foot hol d in spirit life. There was no use for one firmament above and one below unt il the doub le earth was created by the ope ner Ptah, and it was in the making of Amenta that the firmament was dupl icated. It was on account of this new arrange ment when the doubl e earth was formed or the hous e of the two earths was bui lt by Ptah that the fresh treaty was made by Seb betwixt the two oppone nts Sut and Horus. Seb, as arbitrator, calls on Sut and Horus to com e from where they were born in the sout h and nor th, their original stations , to the mount ain in the middl e of the earth, which joined the por ti on of Sut to the por tion of Horus in the equi nox . This was the solar mount in Annu or Heliopol is. “The two earths meet in Annu, for it is the march or bor der - land of the two earths.” Peace was there proclaimed betwixt the warring twins. “This uni on is in t he hous e of Ptah”; “the hous e of his two earths” in which is the bounda ry of sout h and nor th, and also the meeting - poi nt of the two earths, low er and uppe r, as well as the junc tion of the dom ains of the north and sout h in the earlier division of the whol e. When Amenta was made out the east and west were adde d to the sout h and nor th, and the heaven of four qua rters was thus established on the solstices and equi noxe s as the hous e of Ptah. The two earths are the uppe r earth of Seb and the low er earth of Ptah - T atanen, lord of eternity. “Now Seb gave the inhe ritance (of his earth) to Horus.” “So Horus became the chief of the land, ” which henceforth cons isted of the two earths. Horus wears the doubl e diadem as ruler of the doubl e earth. He is now called “the trave rser of the two earths,” and is no longe r merely the uni ter of bot h hor izons . In the preface to the inscription from Memphi s he is hailed thus , “Live Horus, the traverser of the two earths; the conque ring Horus, the traverser of the two earths” ( Stele of S habak a ). On this the Engl ish translators of the text remark, “We are not aware that this epithet occurs elsewhere than in the titles of Shabaka.” It coul d only appl y to the solar god who shone upon the earth of time by day and on the earth of eternity in A menta by night . The title was depende nt on the creation of the twofold earth by Ptah. Broke n as is the inscription, it is evident that the Osirian mythos has been tacked on partially to an earlier version relating to Ptah, his son Atum - Horus, and the Ali o r associate gods of the Put - cycle. Thus Horus, the son of Osiris, takes the place of Atum - Horus, the son of Ptah, who was the earliest traverser of the two earths. 414 Amenta was not entirely “the happy other - world”; it was a world of various states and many parts. These include d an uppe r and low er Egypt , the seven nom es of the Heptanom is, also the fourteen dom ains that were based upon the low er half of the luna r circle, and the fifteen dom ains that belonge d to the solar reckoni ng (Rit., ch. 142) . The in ferno, the purgatory, and the paradise of Dante Alighi eri are extant recogni zably in the Book of the Dead as dom ains of Amenta. The manes had to go through the purgatory and pass by, if not through , the hells before they came to the out let from the mount o f earth in Amenta. This out let was to the east; and here the Aarru field was planted to produc e the harvest of eternity. In this field, which the garden follow ed as a type of tillage, stood the sycamore - tree of wisdom. We also meet with the two"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"sycamores o f the nor th and sout h that correspond to the tree of know ledge and the tree of life in the Garden of Eden. The tree of dawn was figur ed rising up above the horizon of earth with its root age in the secret earth of Amenta. Here also rose the mount of rebirth , and either by climbing the mount or the tree in the wake of the sun - god the manes made their ascent to the uppe r paradise of Aarru in the fields of heaven. When Horus, or Iu, the Egypt ian Jesus, came up from Amenta for his manifestation in the vernal equ inox , it was from the terrestrial paradise of the low er Aarru. If we woul d get a glimpse of the old lost earthly paradise we must descend in thought with the sun or manes in the west and traverse the subt erranean passage to the east. There we emerge in th e Aarru - fields to find ourselves in the Eden of Egypt glorified as the nether land of dawn. The great tree that tow ers evergreen above the horizon has its root age here, and unde rneath this tree the blessed find rest and drink of the divine life - giving liqu or which was afterwards called the hom a, the som a, nepenthe, nectar, or other name for the drink which made immortal. In the mythol ogy it was Hathor the godde ss of dawn who gave the dew of the tree for drink and the fruit of the tree for food; which tree i n Egypt was the sycamore fig. In the eschatology it is the heaven - mother Nut who pour s out the liqui d of life from the tree. The evidence for the Egypt ian origin is four fold. First, the green dawn is African, without parallel. Next, the tree is the sycamor e fig, the tree of know ledge and of life in one . Thirdly, the imagery belongs to the mythical representation of the beginni ng; and lastly, it is repeated for a religious pur pos e in the eschatology. It is a com mon charge brought against the paradise of theo logy that it doe s not provi de for progr ess and developm ent in the life hereafter. But the Egyp tian paradise in Amenta was not a place of unc hangi ng bliss cons idered to be a kind of une arned increment. For them the world to com e in Amenta was what they made it here. And the world to be in the uppe r paradise was what they made it by hard labour and by pur ification in Amenta. The sub - terrestrial paradise was mappe d out for the manes to work in and work out their salvation from the ills of the flesh and blemish es of the life on earth. This was the prom ised land depicted at the end of the jour ney through the nether - world, whether as a garden, a vineyard, a harvest - field, or a table - mountain piled with food and drink. Every pur pos e of the primitive paradise had be en sum med up in the 415 prom ise of everlasting plenty, but in the Egypt ian Aarru the plenty was the reward of indus try. This was the field of divine harvest, no mere pleasure ground, where abunda nce was the result of toil. The soil was appor tione d by the Lord of Eternity, and each one had to cultivate his share, no one lived upon anot her’s labour (164 , 13) . Inde ed, the allotment in this life was cultivated magically whilst the workers were yet upon the uppe r earth. The Egypt ians had out grow n the African c ustom of killing slaves for the pur pos e of sendi ng their spirits as avant cour riers to prepare the way for the pot entate in spirit - world, but the modus ope randi was sym bol ically practised. Amenta may be said to ope n with the fune ral valley in the west, an d to end with the mount of resurrection in the east. In the Osirian mythos when the sun god enters the unde r - world it is as the mum my or the “coffined one ” upon his way to the great resting - place."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":" Except when light ed by the sun of night . Amenta was a land of darkne ss and a valley of the shadow of death. It remained thus, as it was at first, to thos e who coul d not escape from the custody of Seb, the god of earth, “the great anni hilator who resideth in the valley” (Rit., ch. 19) . The resurrection in this net her region was the issuing forth to day which follow ed the bur ial on earth. As it com es to us, the Ritual is com paratively late. The pre - Osirian mythos – solar, luna r, and stellar – is obs cured by the Osirian eschatology. It lives on, how ever, in the Litanies and other fragm ents, which show that Atum - Horus, the son of Ptah, was the earliest representative of the noc turnal sun that made the passage of Amenta and rose again upon the hor izon of the resurrection as the master, and, as was also said, the maker of e ternity, by perfecting the circle through and round the doubl e earth. Amenta, in the solar mythos , was looke d on as the graveyard of the buried sun that died or became inert upon his jour ney through the unde r world. In the eschatology it was also depicted as a sort of cemetery or bur ial - place. Hence the chapter of “introduc ing the mum my into the Tuat on the day of bur ial” (Naville, Todt ., kap. 1 B) — not the earthly mum my, but the mum my of the dramatic mystery as a figur e of the living persona lity. In the boo k of know ing that which is in Amenta there is a description of the sandy realm of Sekari and of thos e who are resting on their sand. This poi nts to the sandy district as a primitive burial - place in which the bod ies of the dead were first preserved from cor rupt ion and decay. Before the mum mies coul d have been embalmed in Egypt , the dead were bur ied in the sand for preservation of the body; and the bur ial - place in a sandy district was repeated in Amenta as the sandy realm of Sekari, the silent or the coffined one , who was Ptah - Sekari in the pre - Osirian religion. It is the creation of Amenta, then, not of the universe, that is the subj ect of the mythos which was made cosmical in the Hebrew book of Genesis. The speaker is the god who came into being in the form of Kheper the creator or maker of all things that came into existence after he came into being. He was in Ta - nen, the earth of the Nun, the abys s within the uppe r earth. This was a land of darkne ss, the place where not hing grew, a type of which was preser ved in the region of Anrutef. In this land there was no heaven, no sun or moon ove rhead, nor earth beneath the feet. Or, as the text has it, there was 416 not hing to stand on. And as there was no earth, there were no plants nor creeping things of earth. No created things yet existed in this land, this low er earth that was waste and voi d; and there was onl y darkne ss on the face of the deep. There was not hing but the primeval matter for Kheper - Ptah and his assistants to moul d into shape for the making of th e seconda ry earth in Amenta. Whilst the unde r - world was yet the primordial abys s, it was the voi d of Apap, the dw elling - place of the things of darkne ss; but now it was the work of Atum as the master of Amenta to make war on Apap; to protect the tree or pla nts and the water of life; to bruise the serpent’s head or slay the dragon of drought and the destroye r of vegetation. Now according to a very ancient myth, there had been war in heaven from the time when the slayer of the dragon was female, and the Great Mother protected her child from the devour ing reptile of the dark with her arrow or lance of light in the moon . This is seen when Isis pierces the head of Apap in the firmamental water. Also when"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"Hemt - Nu, the lady of heaven, light ens up the firmament by o verthrow ing the devour ing mons ter of the dark (Rit., ch. 80) . The two oppone nts Sut and Horus also fought their battle in heaven when an eclipse befell the moon , and when Sut flung his filth upon the face of Horus, and Horus seized the genitals of Sut with his ow n finge rs to emasculate himself (Rit., ch. 17) . But when Amenta was formed the scene of strife was shifted to the new earth that was shaped by Ptah the divine artificer. As it is said in the Book of the Dead (ch. 17), when Amenta was created, and Ra assum ed the sove reignt y, Amenta also became “the scene of strife among the gods .” The speaker, who is Atum - Ra, says, “I am Ra at his first appe arance. I am the great god self - produc ed. A scene of strife arose among the gods when I assum ed com mand” (ch. 17 ). The great cause of strife in Amenta is depicted as the Apap - reptile, of whom it is said, “Eternal devour er is his name.” It is the serpent of darkne ss, the fiery dragon of drough t, the destroye r of vegetable life. Night by night the evil reptile attacks the tree of life in the midst of the garden, as show n in the vigne ttes to the Ritual. This, in the eschatology, is the adve rsary of Osiris and the enemy of soul s. The noc turnal sun as seer in the darkne ss of Amenta is depicted as the great cat in conf lict with the evil serpent. Ra says, “I am the great cat who freque nteth the persea - tree (of life) in Annu, on the night of battle when the defeat of the Sebau is effected and the adve rsaries of the inviolate god (Osiris) are exterminated.” On the night of con flict occurs the defeat of the children of failure. And it is adde d, “There was conf lict in the whol e uni verse, in heaven and upon the earth.” The conf lict betwixt Ra and the Apap is identified as being fought for the water as well as for the light ; the mo rtal enemy of man being drought as well as darkne ss. The strife in heaven, earth, and Amenta was the raison d’être of his com ing who is called the prince of peace, and, who, as Iu - em - hetep, is the bringe r of peace because he came to stop the war that was e lemental, not tribal or racial, but the war of darkne ss against light , the war of drought against water, the war of famine against fertility, or, as mythically rende red, the war of Apap against Ra, the Sebau against Un - Nefer, Sut against Horus, or the serp ent against the seed of the wom an. The type s had been evol ved in the 417 mythol ogy which were cont inue d in theology. Horus of the inunda tion had com e as the prince of peace who slew the dragon of drought ; as the young solar god he pierced the serpent of darkne ss. As prince of peace he passed into the eschatology. This is he who in his incarnation says, “I am the lord on high, and I descend to the earth of Seb that I may put a stop to evil. I com e that I may ove rthrow my adve rsaries upon the earth, though my dead body may be buried” (Rit., ch. 85) . Iu - em - hetep, as is indi cated by the name, com es to bring peace and goodw ill to earth as conque ror of drought , and dearth, and darkne ss. He grappl es with the dragon in the cons tellation Hydr a, and vanqui shes it wi th the water of the inunda tion. He bruises the serpent of darkne ss as “Ophi ucus”; he wrestles with the evil Sut and ove rcom es him in the cons tellation of the Twins. The first chapter of the Book of the Dead was repeated on the day when the Osiris N. was b uried. His entrance into the und er - world as a manes corresponds to that of Osiris the mum my of Amenta, who represents the inert or breathless god, and who also enters the place of burial called the Kâsu. In the absence of the sun there woul d be nought but darkne ss visible, in this the land of the dead, but for the presence of Taht the"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"moon - god. In this character the manes greets Osiris, saying, “O bul l of Amenta, it is Taht the everlasting king who is here!” — as the night - light of the sufferer dyi ng in the d ark. “I am the great god in the bark who have fought for thee” — that is, against Apap and all the pow ers of evil. Apua t is also present to upl ift and save the manes who might otherwise fall headlong into the lake of Putrata, where the mons ter lies in wait t o devour its prey. (Rit., ch. 44. ) It was as the moon in Amenta that Ra is said to have created Taht – a far older god – as a beautiful light to show the face of Apap, his evil enemy. But this was not the moon that was made and hung up in the Hebrew Genesis as a creation of four - and - twenty hour s. Taht carried the luna r lamp called “the eye of Horus” in the darkne ss of the nether earth, to show the hidde n lurking - place of the adve rsary. Thus , in the ope ning chapter of the Ritual the manes rises in Amenta after d eath on earth in the character of Taht the god who is the luna r light as representative of the supr eme god in the dark of death and in the ways of darkne ss in the unde r - world, which means that the Osiris N. deceased enters the nether earth, in the likeness of Taht, to make war upon the dragon on behalf of the sun - god struggl ing with the mons ter coiling round him in the darkne ss of Amenta. In this way the war that is fought out in the night of the nether earth was dramatized in the Book of the Dead, where th e souls of the deceased carry on the battle on behalf of the good Unne fer, whether as Horus or Osiris - Ra. After the making of Amenta there follow ed a re - division of the earth betwixt the two cont endi ng twins, which, as herein maintained, was now the doubl e earth of day and night , of Seb and Ptah, of time and eternity. The war that broke out in Amenta, when Atum took pos session of this nether earth that was prepared for him by Ptah, include s the conf lict of Ra and the Apap - reptile which is por trayed in the vigne ttes to the Ritual, and the battles of the twin - brothers Sut and Horus for pos session of the Aarru - garden, the same that they had fought in external nature. 418 In a doc um ent translated by Chabas there is an account of the agreement between Horus a nd Sut. This is a calenda r of lucky and unl ucky days with mythol ogi cal allusions . Unde r the date of Athyr 27t h, it is said that Kamit, the cultivated land, was given to Horus as his dom ain; and the Tesherit, the red land or desert, was given to Sut as his dom ain (Papyr us Sallier, IV, Chabas, Le Calendr ier des jour s fastes ). The black land of rich fertile loam, and the red land, or desert, thus divided were a form of the doubl e earth as the uppe r and low er land which follow ed on the foundi ng of Amenta; the d ivision being no longe r limited to sout h and nor th, or to the two halves of the luna tion. The uppe r and low er crow ns, white and red, were also brought to bear as sym bol s of the uppe r and low er earth. Hence we are told in this papyr us that on the 29t h of At hyr the white crow n was given to Horus and the red crow n to Sut, as the rulers of the two territories here assigne d to the two oppone nts warring for supr emacy in the Egypt of Amenta. The red and white crow ns had been previous ly given to Sut and Horus as th e rulers of the sout h and north; Sut being Suten in the sout h, and Horus king of the north. But in the Sallier Papyr us a change is made in the dispos ition of the two crow ns. The white crow n was now given to Horus and the red crow n to Sut, as the sym bol s of the uppe r and low er lands , the desert of Sut and the fertile land of Horus, or the wilderness of Anrutef and the paradise of plenty in the Sekhe t - Aarru. In one of his battles with Sut,"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"Horus, having got the better of him, takes pos session of bot h the uppe r and low er land. He says, “I am Horus, the lord of Kamit (the black land) and the heir of Tesherit (the red land) , which I have also seized. I who am the invi ncible one ” (Rit., ch. 138) . It is also said to Horus in “the crow n of trium ph” (Rit., ch. 19), “ Thy father Seb hath decreed that thou shoul dst be his heir. He hath decreed for thee the two earths, absolutely and without condi tion. ” Horus thus becom es the ruler of the doubl e earth and the wearer of the doubl e diadem, who uni ted the white and the red c row n of the uppe r and low er earths, not merely as the two crow ns of the nor th and sout h in the earlier mythos . A new type of deity had been evol ved in Atum - Horus, the son of Ptah. As solar god, he was the first that went bot h unde r and ove r in making the eternal round of night and day. “It is thou who hast created eternity,” is said to Atum - Ra, the divider and traverser of the doubl e earth. This is the god “who goe th round in his orb, and giveth light to the whol e circum ference which the solar orb enlight e neth.” He who had been Horus of the two hor izons and also Kheper the self - originating force was now the traverser and enlight ener of the doubl e earth with his rays (Rit., ch. 15) . After being conc ealed from men by night he presents himself each day at dawn ; his glories are too great to be told as he “arises out of the gol den.” “The land of the god s, the colour s of Puanta are seen in them, that men may form an estimate of that which is hidde n from their faces” (ch. 15, Renouf ). He divides the earths by his p assage through. He lights up the Tuat with his glories and wakens the manes in their hidde n abod es by shining into their sepul chres and coffins. He ope ns the Tuat and dispos es of all its door s in the unde r - world. The Litany of Ra is described as being the book of the worship of Ra and the worship of 419 Tum , that is Atum - Ra, in Amenta. He is worshippe d as the master of the hidde n sphe res who himself is invi sible in darkne ss and who causes the principles (of life) to arise. He is the onl y one that uni tes t he generative subs tances. His body is so great that it conc eals his shape. He is bor n of his ow n becom ing and manifests as his ow n son. In the ador ation of Ra it is said to Atum as he entereth Amenta or “setteth in the land of life,” “All the gods of Ament a are in exul tation at thy glory. They of the hidde n abode s ador e thee, and the great one s make offerings to thee, who have created for thee the soil or ground of earth.” That was in the making of the doubl e earth, not in the making of the earth itself as a cosmogoni cal creation. In shor t, it was not earth - making, but the framing of the doub le earth, with Amenta as the pathw ay of eternity. With the ope ning of Amenta, not onl y was a new world established in the doubl e earth of Ptah — a new dyna sty of deities was also founde d. This was the Osirian group of five, cons isting of Osiris, Isis and Nepht hys, sight less Horus and Sut, who were called the children of Seb. Here, again, the twin oppone nts, Sut and Horus, were far older than Osiris, but were brought on wit h the great god s, the Great Mother, and the two sisters, in this newer com bination of the pow ers effected in the unde r - world, the nether por tion of the doubl e earth. Amenta in one aspect was the world of the dead, the Kâsu or bur ial - place in the Osirian c ult. In this it was claimed to be “the great resting - place” of Osiris the mum my - god, which it became. But it had been created by Ptah for his son Atum before the Osirian dyna sty was founde d at Abydos . It was the way of the Egypt ians to put all"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"they kne w in to all they did in bringi ng on and aggr egating their wisdom of the past. Thus the circum pol ar paradise is repeated in the earthly paradise of Amenta. The stellar mount of glory in the nor th was reproduc ed as solar in the east. The Heptanom is with its seven entrances; the twenty - eight luna r stations , fourteen in the uppe r and four teen in the low er hemisphe re; the hous e of Osiris with its thirty - six gates. Various stars and cons tellations know n on high, such as Orion, Sothis, and Polaris, were repeated as the gui ding stars in this firmament of the low er earth to which the look s of the manes were directed in death. Amongs t other reproduc tions in Amenta we find the Aarru garden; the abys s of the Nun as the wom b of earth; the tree or edible plants in the water of the abys s; the dragon of drought or the serpent of darkne ss; the old first mother; the warring twins, Sut and Horus; the com pany of seven elemental pow ers; the low er firmament; the two pillars of Sut and Horus erected in Tattu, the hous e of eternity; Taht , the bearer of the luna r light ; the Sebau, or pow ers of darkne ss, fog, mist, cloud, plague , storm, and eclipse — all of which were pre - extant before Amenta had been made by Ptah. The primary group of seven elemental pow ers was succeeded by the eight great g ods , and the eight by the Put - circle of nine. Ptah was then cons idered to be the one supreme god, begot ten by his ow n becom ing, the maker of all things , who himself was not made. The eight were looke d upon as his children. The nine formed the Put - circle or cycle of Ptah, who are equi valent to the Elohi m of Genesis. In this conne ction we may 420 not e that No. 9 was the full Egypt ian plural. The word for nine is Put, and Putah (or Ptah) is of a ninefold nature. Ptah was inde ed the full Egypt ian plural as a group or Put of pow ers that were com bined in a supr eme self - originating force whos e mode of becom ing was by transforming from the elemental pow er or pow ers through the hum an into the divine. As “creators,” Ptah and his com pany of artizans did not originate in that which had no previous existence. They were the transformers of that which had always been as elemental in matter. The element of earth was pre - extant, likewise the pow er that brought forth life from the earth in water. This pow er ope rated by trans formation, and one of its type s was the serpent of Rannut (a form of the Mother - earth), which was a type of transformation because it periodically sloughe d its skin and renewed itself. The element of water was pre - extant, also the pow er that transformed in the water to bring forth life in food. This transforming pow er in the water was objectified by the tadpol e visibly turning into the frog. It was the same all nature through . The “creators” were the formers and transformers as uns een forces ope rating in th e phy sical dom ain, with each one traceable to an elemental origin. First the elements themselves. Next the elemental forces or self - originators in two categor ies, the baleful and the beneficent. Then the godde sses and gods that were por trayed totemically, and afterwards persona lized as divinities in the hum an likeness. Ptah was the divine artizan. In his time the masons , bui lders, pot ters, blacksmiths were at work, each in their com panionship, or brotherhood , as they are seen, hard at it, when the workers in the valley of the Nile com e into view. He is especially called the father of beginni ngs . He was the former in the likeness of the scarabæ us, the transformer in the image of a frog, and as the embryo in utero Ptah exhi bits the earliest attempt at impos in g the hum an likeness upon the shaping pow er that was previous ly"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"imaged by means of the typi cal insect, or sym bol ical animal, as in totemism. There is a group of primeval pow ers described in later times who are said to be “the first com pany of the gods of A arru,” or the fields of heaven. They are addr essed as the might y one s, the beneficent one s, the divine one s, who test by their level the words of men as the lords of law, justice, and right ; or as the lords of Maat. They are saluted in these words, “Hail t o you, ye gods , ye associate - gods , who are without body , ye who rule that which is born from the earth, and that which is produc ed in the hous e of your cradles. Ye prototype s of the image of all that exists; ye forms, ye great one s, ye might y one s, first c om pany of the gods of Aarru, who generated men and shaped the type of every form, ye lords of all things . Hail to you, ye lords of everlasting” (Louv re Papyr us, 3283; Renouf , Hib. Lectures, pp. 208 - 209 ). In this text the Aarru is celestial, not the Aarru i n Amenta, but the Aarru of the fields above , of which the godde ss Apt is said to have been the mother as the bringe r - forth of the seven primeval pow ers in their stellar character. As lords of Maat they are identical with the seven lords of rule or divine g ove rnor s who are called “the arms of the balance on the night when the eye is fixed” (Rit., ch. 71) . This first com pany of the gods in the fields of heaven were the Ali or Ari (as 421 in the seven Kab - ari) by name, and the Ali are a group of com panions w ho are herein set forth as co - creators of all that exists in heaven or in earth. The primordial nature - pow ers are mentione d unde r several type s and names. They are the seven Uræus - gods , born of Mother - earth as non - sentient elemental pow ers (Rit., ch. 83). They are the seven Khus or glorious one s whos e place in heaven was appoi nted by Anup on the day of “com e thou to me” (Rit., ch. 17) . They are the seven who assist the great judge in the Maat at the pol e on the night of the judgm ent day, called “the seven a rms of the balance,” as executione rs of the gui lty, who accom plish the slaught er in the tank of flame when the conde mned are exterminated (ch. 71, 7). They are the seven wise masters of arts and sciences who assisted Taht in his measurements of earth and h eaven. In the solar mythos they are to be seen in several characters with Horus, Ptah, and Ra. They were por trayed as the seven with Horus, in the eight great stars of Orion. They are the seven soul s of Ra, also the seven divine ancestors in the boa t of th e sun, the seven who suppor t Osiris in Amenta. In whichever pha se of phe nom ena, they are a group, a brotherhood, a com panions hip of pow ers originally seven in num ber. It is now propo sed to identify this “first com pany” of creators who passed through these several pha ses in the Egyp tian mythos as seven elementals, seven with the ancient Genetrix, seven with Anup, seven with Taht, seven with Horus, seven with Ptah, as the group of com panions called the Elohi m in the Hebrew Genesis, who were know n to the Gnos t ics and Kabalists as seven in num ber, with Ialdabaoth, a form of Sut, at their head. The word Elohi m in Hebrew is employe d bot h as a singul ar and a plural noun for god and gods , or spirits, with no know n origin in phe nom ena by which the plurality coul d be expl ained. For this we must cons ult the Egypt ian wisdom in the mythos which preceded the eschatology. In the “Dispatches from Palestine” there is a perfect parallel to the twofold use of Elohi m in the plural and singul ar forms employe d in the Hebrew book. The scribe addr essing the Egypt ian Pharaoh says, “To the king, my lord, my gods , my sun - god .” ( Records of the Past, vol . II, p. 62, 2nd series.) Here the gods"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"were the pow ers gathered into the one god as supr eme. These when sevenfold were called the soul s of Ra. They becom e the eight in the paradise of Am - Khemen. They are nine in the Put - cycle of Ptah, they were ten as the Sephi roth of the Kabalists, they are twelve in the final heaven of Atum - Ra. In a word, they are the Elohi m as a form of the Egypt ian Al i or Ari, a com panions hip of workers, and later creators. “In the beginni ng Elohi m created the heaven and the earth.” The astronom ical mythol ogy of Egypt , from the time of Sut to that of Ptah, is invol ved in that brief statement. There are at least three d ifferent groups of the Elohi m – that is, the Ali or Ili – with the plural endi ng of the name as Semitic. The first group of these creators was seven in num ber, with Sut at their head. The second was that of the eight in Am - Khemen, with Anup adde d to the seven. The third is the com pany of Ptah, who formed the Put - circle of the nine. These preceded Atum , who was Ra in his first sove reignt y. And to show how the past of Egypt ope ns into immensity, Ptah is credited with being the supr eme ruler for 9,000 years. Still earlier 422 the follow ers of Horus reigne d for 14,000 years; and, as the astronom ical legends show , the primary seven creators had previous ly marked out one great year in the circle of precession before they coul d becom e thos e lords of eternity at the n orth celestial pol e, which were represented by a group of seven stars that never set. Unde r the title of Elohi m, bot h the one god and the com pany of gods are present, though conc ealed, just as Ptah and his associates the Ali were include d in the Put - cycle, as Ptah the god , Iu the son of god, and the paut as the group of gods . And if the Put - cycle of the Ali, as now maintained, are the originals of the Phœ nician and Hebrew Elohi m, it follow s that the deity Ptah is the one god of the group in the Genesis as w ell as in the original mythos . Although the name of Ptah may not be given, yet the creator as the worker in earth, the pot ter, the moul der or carver, is plainly appa rent in the Hebrew Genesis. Also it may be parenthetically remarked that the Hebrew word t [ , puth, or peth, for the ope ning, is identical with Put, in Egyp tian, to ope n; and that Ptah or (Putah) was named from this root as the ope ner, whether as ope ner of the nether earth for the sun t o pass through, or for the resurrection of the manes from Amenta in the com ing forth to day. Moreove r, there is a biblical name, that of Puthahiah ( h y h t [ ), which appa rently proclaims the fact that Iah is the ope ner, or that he is identical with Ptah (I Chron. XXIV. 16; Ezra X. 23; Neh. IX. 5 and XI. 24) . The same root enters into the name of Pethue l, which is equi valent to Ptah - El or the divine ope ner, who was the Egypt ian god Ptah (Joel I. 1). In the Egypt ian divine dyna sties Ptah is god the father in one character and Iu the son in the other. In the person of Iu he is the yout hful deity who rises from th e dead bot h as the sun - god and as the soul which was imaged for the resurrection in the form of a sahu - mum my risen with the solar hawk for its head, as sym bol of the soul issuing from the body of Kheper - Ptah. Iu, in the character of the son, is also repres entative of the Put - cycle, that is of the Elohi m or com pany of the creators. Thus the Elohi m are represented in the first creation of man by the maker=Ptah, and in the second by Iu the son of Ptah; and Iu the son of Ptah is equi valent to Iahu - Elohi m, who b ecom es the creator of the second Adam in the second chapter of the Hebrew Genesis. In the first of two creations Ptah and the Ali who are his associate - gods , the Ali or Elohi m, are the creators of Atum , the Hebrew Adam, who in the first pha se was created m ale and female, man and wom an"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"in one . The associate - gods or Elohi m are said to becom e the lips, the teeth, the joints, the hands , of Atum the son of Ptah. In anot her version they are the seven soul s of man. In the second creation it is Atum and his associa te - gods who are the creators of man, the same as Iahu - Elohi m in the Genesis. The parallel is perfect; onl y in the Hebrew rende ring the gnos is is om itted. Still there are two Adams, man the mortal on earth, and man the manes in Amenta. It is the present wri ter’s cont ention that the Elohi m in the plural are the Ali or associate - god s of Ptah, and that Iahu - Elohi m is the deity Iu, who was a form of Ptah as god the son, and who afterwards became the father god in Israel unde r the name of Ihuh or Jehova h. Iu or I u - em - hetep, he who com es with 423 peace, is the Kamite original of the prom ised prince of peace, whos e com ing was periodi c and æoni an for ever and ever, or from generation to generation. The writer further maintains that the creation in the first chapter answers to the creation of Kheper - Ptah and his Ali, that the creation of Iahu in the second chapter is identical with that of Iu or Atum and his associate - gods , and that the garden in Eden is the Aarru garden which Ptah and his Ali or Elohi m created for A tum the son to cultivate as the earthly paradise in Amenta. Thus , the two different creations in the first two chapters of Genesis are in their prope r order. In the first “the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the hos t of them.” Man, or Adam, al so was made. All through this chapter the creators are the associate - god s, the Egypt ian Ali, the Phœ nician Elohi m. In the second chapter, one of the Elohi m is indi vidua lized by name as Iahu or Iahu - Elohi m, translated “the Lord God, ” which might be rende red the god Iahu= Iu - em - hetep. After the Elohi m had finished their work, it is said in the second chapter of Genesis that Iahu - Elohi m now made the earth and heaven which had already been assigne d to the Elohi m as makers in the pervious chapt er. This also may b e expl ained by the Egypt ian mythos . Ptah the creator and father of the Ali, or Elohi m, was one with Iu in the person of the son. Ptah, the speaker for the group in the first chapter, is the father, and Iahu in the second chapter is the same one god cont inu ed as the son, Iu, Iusa, or Iu - em - hetep. Thus the dua l character of Ptah - Iu was cont inue d in Atum - Iu as the divine father and son. Also, there are two Atum s, correspondi ng to the two type s of Adam, one hum an, one divine. One was the Atum who died= the Adam in whom all men die, as Paul expr esses the doc trine; the other is the second Atum called Nefer - Atum , or Iu the son, who rose again to change the earthly into the heavenly man, in whom the dead were to be made alive again in Amenta, as it was taught in Egyp t som e ten thous and years ago. In the Hebrew version Atum - Iu has been divided and brought on in two characters which really correspond to the two Adams, hum an and divine, the first Adam or man, who was of the earth earthly, the second Adam or man, who is o f heaven heavenly, the “life - giving spirit,” who became Atum - Ra the “hol y spirit” in the Kamite eschatology. More of the Genesis survived amongs t the Kabalists. Atum at Annu, like Ptah at Memphi s, was the one god in the two characters of father and son; t he eternal father who was persona lized in time as the ever - com ing son. The birth was periodi c in phe nom ena. Horus of the inunda tion on his papyr us came as the shoot ; Iu as the fish. Thus to have any meaning the com ing son was the ever - com ing one as a type of the eternal. The title of Ptah as Kheper has the meaning"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"of becom ing. The name of the son Iu signi fies the com ing one . This was he who came for ever, first as manifestor for the mother, “the seed of the wom an,” and then as the representative of the fath er. In the cult of Ptah bot h characters of the father and son were com bined in one god , and bot h were cont inue d in Atum . Iu the bringe r of peace was god the com ing son in bot h religions . The com ing son, we repeat, was the ever - com ing one . There was no adve nt onc e for all. Food and vegeta - 424 tion, water and light , depende d on cont inua l repetition and renewal. This was a subj ect of the astronom ical mythol ogy , in which the “com ing” according to time and season had perenni al fulfilment. The war of Horus the son with the serpent of darkne ss was fought out night ly. His conf lict with the dragon of drough t was repeated annua lly. But in the Hebrew version the “com ing” has been relegated to the dom ain of prophe cy. The saviour or deliverer is to com e to bruise the serpent’s head onc e for all; and in this passing of mythol ogy into the later eschatology the ever - com ing was change d into the long - expe cted and, as it turns out , never - com ing son of the Holy Spirit and a mother who was ever - virgin. It was not the obj ect of the adapters to be more expl icit, but to all intents and pur pos es the two characters of Atum the father - god, who was designa ted “the father of manki nd, ” and of Iu the son have been reproduc ed in Genesis as Adam the hum an father and Iahu - Elohim as the god . It is the making of Amenta by Ptah and his associate gods that has been conve rted into a creation of the heaven and the earth in the book of Genesis. This is show n by the firmament that was suspende d in the midst of the waters which were unde r the firmam ent and separated from the waters which were ove r the firmament. This is the firmament that was made by Ptah when he divided the heaven of Nut below from the heaven of Nut on high, and thus suspende d a low er sky above the nether earth. But when the heaven and the earth were made and the work was finished, the result was a world so unf urnished and unf it to live in that “no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up” : no rain had fallen, and “there was not a man to til l the ground” (ch. II, 5). This was in Amenta, the hidde n earth that was ope ned by Ptah for Tum (Atum) and his associate gods to cultivate. Now the impos sibility of the Hebrew creation being cosmical is fixed for ever, inasmuch as the heaven and earth are made twice over. In the second chapt er there is a second creation of heaven and earth, and the first creation is follow ed by the making of a second man. The creation of the garden, in the Egypt ian mythos , is a separate and subs eque nt creation from the call ing of a nether earth into existence. Amenta was first made, and then the Aarru - garden was planted in Amenta. This twofold creation will account for the two Adams, the man of earth and the man from heaven, or man the mortal and man the manes. In the mythol ogy the first Atum was solar. In the eschatology the second Atum is spiritual. The garden was made for the manes to cultivate, and the manes represents the second Adam, who as Egypt ian is Nefer - Atum , or Atum in sprit — otherwise man the manes in the garden o f Amenta. In the book of Genesis there are six creations or acts of creation, set forth as the work of six days or periods . (1) The light was divided from the darkne ss, and there was evening and morning — one day. (2) The firmamental water was divided into uppe r and low er, and there was a second day. (3) The waters were gathered into one place for"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"the dry land to appe ar; the earth put forth grass and herbs and trees, and there was a third day. (4) The light s were set in the firmament for signs and seasons , a nd there was a four th day. (5) The creatures of the waters were brought forth and the fow ls of the air, 425 and there was a fifth day. (6) The earth brought forth the living creatures after their kind, includi ng man, and there was a sixth day. Then in th e moralizing of the mythos the work of creation being ende d on the sixth day, the seventh is to be solemnized as a day of rest. In the cour se of literalizing the pre - extant mythos it is said that when Elohi m finished his work he rested on the seventh day f rom all the work which he had made. “And Elohi m blessed the seventh day and hallow ed it, because that in it he rested from all his work which Elohi m had created and made” (ch. II, 2, 3). So in the book of Amenta it is said that the nether earth was created by the solar god , who rested in that which he had made, just as Ptah was satisfied after making all things , and all the divine names, when like the Elohi m he had finished the work and saw that it was good. There is no great difficulty in discove ring the origin of the day of rest which has been ascribed to the Elohi m upon the seventh day of creation. Amenta was created as the place of rest for the sleeping dead, and also for the god of the resting heart. It had been the work of Ptah and his associate gods to create the great resting - place in the unde r - world. And cons eque ntly this character of Ptah, as the maker of Amenta, is determined by his designa tion of “Ptah in the great resting - place” (Stele of Shabaka, line 16) . The great resting - place was created fo r the god who rested there, as did Atum and later Osiris of the resting heart. This was the work which the creator or craftsman Ptah com pleted in seven stages or periods that were ultimately reduc ed to seven days. The mount called Hetep in the earthly para dise is named as the mount of rest. It was a kind of “rest - and - be - thankf ul” half - way up the ascent from the world of the dead to the sum mit on the mount of glory. The word Hetep has the various meanings of rest, peace, plenty, all of which were to be reali zed in Hetep, the garden of the blessed dead. The great obj ect is “to take pos session there.” The manes says, “I am uni ted there with the god of rest” — that is, with Osiris, god of the resting heart. “I take my rest in the divine dom ain. There is given to m e the plenty which belonge th to the kau and the glorified.” “Rise in Hetep (the mount ) blest with the breezes, I arrive in thee, my head is unc ove red. I am in my ow n dom ain.” One of the blissful islands of this earthly paradise is expr essly called the isle of rest or Hetep. The voya ger makes fast his bark to “the block of moor age on the stream,” and utters his praises to the gods who are in the garden of rest. The garden of Amenta was a place of rest in the refreshing shade of Hathor ’s tree. It was called t he garden of Hetep. The word Hetep is also spelt Hept. In fact, to judge from the hierogl yphi cal inscriptions in the Pyramid of Medum , it seems that this was the earliest spelling of the word. Thus Amenhe tep woul d be Amenhe pt. Now Hept (Gr. Epta ) in Egypt i an also signi fies the num ber seven. This may be related to the work of creation in seven days, which according to the non - biblical Jewish legends represented the earthly paradise in seven divisions as a figur e of the celestial heptanomis, the work in seven parts being com put ed as a work of seven days, and Hept the place of rest transformed into the seventh day of rest. In the later Semitic märchen, Assyrian and Hebrew, a division in time has been"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":" 426 subs tituted for the division in space — that is, the seve n divisions of the astronom ical heptanom is have been conve rted into a creation of seven days, and a great day of rest has been subs tituted for the great resting - place. We can perceive the Semitic Sabba th in the making and also where it was made. In the eld er version of the Assyrian legend of creation there was no Sabba th. The seventh day is a day of labour , not a day of rest. But whatsoever was signi fied by the seven successive divisions , acts, stages, or periods of creation that were ultimately com memorate d by the festival of the seventh day, the Semitic Sabba th belongs to the supe rstructure, not to the founda tion, and is not original, either as Hebrew or Assyrian. Time did not begin with Sunda y, either as the first or the seventh day of the week. The week was preceded by the mont h or a moon, and a moon by the year of the inunda tion that was com memorated by the festival of the Great Bear’s tail. In the Chaldean account of creation there is a hint of the solar origin of the Sabba th. In this it is said of the creator, “On the seventh day he appoi nted a hol y day. And to cease from all bus iness he com mande d. Then arose the sun on the horizon of heaven.” (Lines 17, 18, 19.) The day dedicated to the sun was Sund ay, but the solar calenda r was the latest. An inde fini tely more ancient version than anyt hing Semitic has been preserved in the Hawaiian legend of creation. This is said to have begun on the 26t h day of the mont h, on the day of Kane, and cont inue d during the days named Lono, Manli, Maku, Hilo, and Hoaka. In s ix days the creation was com pleted, and the seventh day, the day of Ku, became the first hol y day. The first and sixth of these seven days have been kept sacred ever since by all generations of Hawaiians. Yet the Polyne sians generally did not solemnize a w eekly Sabba th, and had no week of seven days. (Fornande r, vol. I, p. 121; Natural Genesis, vol . II, p. 56. ) More than onc e we meet with a sixth - day Sabba th in Africa. Dos Santos described this sixth day of rest as being obs erved in the ploughi ng season by the Monom atapa, which, according to Bent (p. 341) , is cont inue d among them to - day. “At Mangw edis dur ing the ploughi ng season they onl y work for five cons ecutive days. They obs erve the sixth and call it Muali’s day, and rest in their hut s and drink beer. Th ese days are feasts of the ancestral spirits or muzimos, called “the days of the hol y one s who are already dead.” A week of seven days conc ludi ng with the Sabba th, which was at first a festival, is more expr essly Semitic. Not that the Egypt ians had no sev en - day period in their reckoni ngs of time. The tenai t was a period of seven days, as well as of fourteen days or a half - moon; but a cycle of seven days as the measure of a cosmogoni cal creation had no meaning. The seven periods of creation did not originat e with seven days of twenty - hour s each. As will be seen, when all is put toge ther, the Egypt ians reckone d time upon a scale so vast that it include d the great year of the world. That is, the heptanom is founde d upon seven astronom es had been repeated in the great year with its seven periods in precession which were represented by the seven changi ng pol e - stars before the backw ard move ment coul d have been calculated by the pos ition of the equi noc tial colure. The reduc ed scale of the Semitic seven days is but a one - inch - to - the - mile sort of 427 "},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"rende ring of the seven stages in precession which have yet to be expl ained. The traditions show that one type of the unde r - world was the heptanom is, which had been munda ne in Egypt and was made celestial in the astronom ical mythol ogy. This was likewise reproduc ed in the making of Amenta. Ptah is said to have designe d the Nom es (Text of Shabaka, line 6). The Nom es were seven in num ber. The Knemmu who assisted Ptah were seven. The creations that culminated in man the speak er were seven. Also in one of the Rabbi nical traditions conc erning the low er and uppe r, or the earthly and heavenly, paradise, it is said that before his fall Adam was the heavenly dw eller in a habitation which cont ained seven palaces or mansions . These, a ccording to the Soha r, were afterwards rearrange d to becom e the abode s of the blessed. This cont ains a fragm ent of the genui ne legend when right ly interpreted. Adam is here cons idered to have been a dw eller in the paradise of the celestial heptanom is. This was repeated in Amenta when the low er paradise of the solar mythos was mappe d out in seven dom ains for Atum =Adam, as the land of promise destined for the glorified elect. It is related by Rabbi Manasseh Ben - Israel that the soul s of men were created dur ing the six days of the beginni ng, inde pende ntly of bodi es, like the first com pany of the Kamite gods . These were the spirits derived from the external elements that preceded the embodi ment of a special soul in hum an form. ( Nat. Genesis, vol . II, p. 282 .) “Tr ue Israelites believe,” says the Rabbi , “that all the souls which have existed from the first time, and which shall be to the end of the world, were generated in six days of creation.” These are the six soul s of the fish, the fow l, the beast, the reptile, and other forms of life which preceded the seventh soul of the speaker, man, or Atum =Adam. The seventh of the elemental pow ers, in the hum an shape, is described in the gnos tic systems of the Ophi tes and Sethians when they teach that Ialdabaoth called upon the rest of the Elohi m, saying, “Com e, let us make man after our ow n image.” They also relate that Ialdabaoth in the character of elder brother as the woul d - be father created six sons , he himself being the first person in the group. They further declare th at these are the seven munda ne demons who always oppos e and resist the hum an race, because it was on their account that their father (Ialdabaoth) was cast dow n to this low er world. (Irenaeus, Bk. I, ch. 30, 8.) It is also represented in the Rabbi nical wri tings that the soul s of the Israelites had a highe r origin than the soul s of the Gentiles. The soul s of the Goim, they say, have their origin from the external pow ers, the pow er of klippot h or the demons , whereas the soul s of the Israelites are derived fro m the Holy Spirit. The first originated from the elemental pow ers that were imaged by the zoot ype s, and were denounc ed as evil spirits by the later theology. As for Atum - Ra, the father of Iu, he was the Kamite hol y spirit. The soul s of the idol aters were n ot called men, because they were bor n in the totemic stage of sociology and were derived from the spirits of the elements which had been imaged by the zoot ype s. More simply stated, they were not men onl y because the mode of representation was pre - anthropom orphi c, and the soul of blood was not yet traced 428 to the maternal sour ce, or the spirit of man to the father. In the Babyl oni an legends the totemic zoot ype s, which preceded the man derived from the soul of blood , have been conf used with the beings bor n of the abys s as the creatures of darkne ss. “Then Belos the"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"sun - god came, and the animals died, as they were not able to bear the light . Belos seeing a vast space unoc cupi ed, though by nature fruitful, com mande d one of the gods to cut off his head and to mix the blood with the earth, and from thence to form other men and animals which shoul d be capable of bearing the light.” (Eusebius, Chron. , I, 4) This in its way is a mythical creation of the man who was made from the soul of blood . In anot her legend a g reat destruction follow s a rebellion called “the revol t in heaven,” which is onl y mentione d here for the sake of citing the statement that when the rebels were destroye d or driven out by the supr eme god, “in their room he created manki nd. ” As we unde rstand the gnos is, a group of six totemic pow ers was extant before the seventh, the soul of man, was specialized as a hum an soul that was incarnated in the blood of the motherhood, the first soul , so to say, that coul d talk. This group of six zoot ype s with no hu man figure include d is widely extende d ove r the world. As the Arunt a tell us, in the Alcheringa , or Auld Lang Syne , there were no men or wom en, only pre - hum an creatures designa ted the Inapertwa. In the Egypt ian mythos the six zoot ype s of Sut, Horus, Shu, H api, Tuamutef, and Kabhs enuf are follow ed and com pleted by the hum an figur e in Amsta the man or Horus the child. The Arunt a version com es fresh from an almost unknow n world. It may have been carried there from Africa, but it is certain that the Egypt ians d id not derive their mysteries, mythical legends , and sign - langua ge from the natives of Central Australia. The tradition of the Inapertwa onl y appl ied to certain totems, six in num ber (this will bear repeating) . The preliminary pre - hum an creatures who were made into men and wom en by the Unga mbikul a belonge d to the six follow ing totems: Akakia, or plum tree; Ingui tchika, or grass - seed; Echunpa , or large lizard; Erliwatchera, or little lizard; Atninpi richina, or Alexandr a parakeet; and the Untaina, or small ra t. Here are six totemic type s of creatures that preceded the hum an voice and image. There were six groupi ngs of elemental spirits based upon six elemental pow ers that were imaged by means of zoot ype s before ever an elemental pow er was imaged in the hum an l ikeness, or, as it was rende red at a later time, before the creation of man, who was seventh in a series of seven, or as the earliest hum an soul . Miss Kings ley gives it as the opi nion of Dr. Nassau of Gaboon that the nature - spirits com monl y affecting hum an affairs, which are believed in by the natives on the West Coast, can be classified “fairly com pletely” in six orders (Kings ley, M. H., Travels in West Africa ). The Damaras derive from six pre - hum an pow ers by means of six descents or eunda s. Six descents f rom supe rhum an pow ers woul d naturally follow for thos e who derived their descent from the pow ers, gods , or spirits that might be represented by six totemic zoot ype s such as the serpent, crocodi le, hippopot amus, lion, hawk, and other figures of the elementa l forces that preceded the hum an image as a primitive type of pow er. Afterwards the six pow ers woul d 429 account for six different classes of spirits recogni zed in the animistic interpretation of external nature according to religion in the fetishtic pha se. In Indi a there was a first form of the Aditya, six in num ber, who preceded the groups of seven and eight . There was also an Egypt ian “mystery of the six” which has not been unve iled. The seventh of the series is the soul that was first cons idered to be hum an because it was the soul of man, the speaker, which in this pha se was discreted from the totemic soul s by means of langua ge. No distinction coul d have been more natural."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":" As we have previous ly seen in Book IV, the Osiris deceased is recons tituted for the life hereafter by the blendi ng of his seven soul s, which correspond to the seven soul s of Ra. And when he has becom e a spirit by the seven being put toge ther at last in the likeness of the ka, it is said to him, “Thy perfect soul , O Nefer - Uben - f, triu mphant , hat h the pow er of speech” (Rit., ch. 149, 15) . Speech was the prope rty of the perfect soul – that is, the highe st of the seven soul s – which was cons eque ntly hum an. The Chinese also have the very ancient “six honour ed one s,” or six Tsung. The Zuni Indi ans ador ed the six pow ers that preceded the seventh in the likeness of man. In “The Wisdom of Jesus” or the book of Ecclesiasticus there is a description of the creation of man. It is said that men “received the use of the five ope rations of the Lord, and in the sixth place he imparted to them unde rstandi ng, and in the seventh speech” (Eccles. XVII. 5). This cont ains a fragm ent of the Egypt ian wisdom . The creation of man from seven soul s takes place in Amenta for the next life, with speech as the seventh co nstituent. In the mythol ogi cal text from Memphi s there is an account of Ptah’s creation, in which it is said that all the limbs move d ( i.e., as parts of the pauti or com pany of the gods ) when he uttered the word of wisdom which came forth from the tongue a nd worked a blessing upon all things . Spe ech caus ed (or literally becam e) the making of men and the creation of the gods for Ptah ( Proc. Soc . Bib. Arch., vol . XXIII, pts. 4 and 5, pp. 173 - 4). Thus the making of man qua man is attributed to speech in this K amite creation of man as the speaker, the same as in “The Wisdom of Jesus.” This may account for the custom , or religious rite, performed by the Hindu father, who put s his lips to the right ear of the new - bor n babe and mutters three times, “Speech! Speech! Speech!” This gives it a name. The previous soul s were onl y know n by totemic type s and semi - hum an soul s, not by prope r names. (Kelly, Indo - Europe an Folk - Lore, pp. 145 - 6.) Hindu sages tell us that six of the seven primordial soul s were bor n twins; the sev enth alone came into existence as a singl e soul . This too can be read by means of the gnos is. The six soul s were pre - hum an. That is, they were totemic soul s. Now , the totemic zoot ype was the representative of bot h sexes; the male stood for the men, the fem ale for the wom en. “Of thos e that are born toge ther, sages have called the seventh singl e - bor n, for six are twins” (Rig - Veda, Wilson, II, 131, 132) . Totemic man was born twin as represented by the zoot ype of bot h sexes. Six of these preceded the hum an figu re, which as hom o or man was bor n singl e and had to be divided into man and wom an according to the mythical representation of the cutting out in the second creation by Iahu - Elohi m. 430 (Gen. II). The twin - soul was what the Egypt ian Ritual describes as th e one soul in two bodi es (ch. 17). One of these was male as Shu, the other female as Tefnut . This was the man or Adam of the first creation in Genesis, who was figur ed as bot h male and female (Gen. I. 27). Shu and Tefnut were born twins, he as brother, she as sister, and bot h unde r one type , that of the lion. In the same way the crocodi le was female as Apt and male as Sebek. Thus a singl e totemic type denot ed a soul that was bor n twin when soul s were pre - hum an. It is the same doc trine when the Kabalists ass ert that in the beginni ng of the world soul s were created by God in pairs cons isting of a male and female. The twin - soul here is a produc t of the primary creation; the singl e soul belongs to the second creation."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"The doc trine is appa rent in the first chapte r of Genesis, when Adam was created in the likeness of the Elohi m, and was bot h male and female. Whereas in the second creation (ch. II) man, or Adam, is not a twin soul ; he is fashione d singl y, and the wom an is taken from the body of the man to form a con sort for him. When the supr eme pow er of seven was imaged in the hum an likeness this cons tituted a mythical man as the seventh in a series of seven prototype s. Thus Enoc h, the seventh from Adam, is pre - eminently the man. Also, when the group of manes travel round the zodi ac, in the Hindu astronom y, the seventh is a divine man or a Buddha . The seventh Buddha is always the man who is held to be divine. The seven Buddha s are often portrayed in the temples and mona steries of Tibet, where they are better know n as the seven Sang - gye , meaning increase of pur ity, who are named: (1) He who saw through and through, (2) he who had a crest of fire, (3) the preserver of all, (4) the dissolver of the round of life, (5) golden might , (6) the gua rdian of light , (7) the might y Shakya . The seventh is that pre - eminent persona ge know n as Sakya - Muni or Gautama, whos e life and history were evol ved from the pre - extant mythos , like thos e of the Christ in the gos pels — the true Buddha , who coul d no more becom e historical than the Christ of the gnos is. If Buddhi sm coul d but expl icate its ow n origins it woul d becom e appa rent that it is bot h natural and scientific. But the blind attempt to make the Buddha historical in one personality will place it ultimately on the same level with historic al Christianity at the bot tom of the ditch. The seventh Buddha that com es onc e in a phœ nix - cycle of 500 years is the divine man, who can only be repeated as an astronom ical figur e — a measurer for the eternal in the cycles of time. But the manifestation of t he seventh, the man of the group, has been made exot eric as an incarnation of the seventh Buddha in the hum an form on earth. The divine man as the seventh of a series is yet extant and ope rative in British folk - lore when the seventh son of a seventh son is always the great healer. The totemic soul was twin. The hum an soul was singl y bor n as the soul of the man or wom an. It was not as the Hebrew Adam that man was made, but as the Egypt ian Atum, earlier Tum ; and Tum in Egyp tian means “created man. ” Adam is a later rende ring of the name. And this “created man” was made as Atum son of Ptah with the aid of his Ali or co - creators. It was they who created the senses of man, the breathing of the nos trils, the sight of the eyes, the hearing of the ears, the thought o f the heart, and utterance by the tongue . 431 Man was made according to the out line of Child - Horus sketched by Ptah; the anthrotype that was to supe rsede the zoot ype . Man that is com pos ed of seven soul s, according to the doc trine, was the produc t of sev en elements. These were recogni zed at first as nature - pow ers that were ultimately divinized as makers or creators. They had been divinized as the first com pany of the associate - gods before the time of Ptah, and when Kheper - Ptah, Neb - er - ter, became supr eme, the seven Ali were associated with him in the work of creation, the evol ution of man, and the making of the garden in Amenta. Thus man in the Egypt ian mythos was a late creation, which is in agreement with the legends of the abor igines. Man was also made twice ove r, onc e as mortal on the earth, and onc e as the spirit - man or manes in Amenta. Hence the first and second Adam or Atum , the man of earth and the man from heaven. These will also expl ain the two forms of Adam in the book of Genesis (I. 27 and II. 7 ). The seventh of the elemental pow ers was the soul of"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"blood. This was represented in the elder Horus as the soul of matter by a child that was uns eeing, inarticulate, and altoge ther imperfect. The soul of blood as paternal sour ce was adde d to the rest whe n Atum cut himself to produc e his offspring Hu and Sau (Rit., ch. 17) . In the Assyrian legend, when the head of Belos is taken off the blood that gus hes out is mingl ed with the soil of earth or matter. “Thence men were formed. On this account it is that me n are rationa l, and partake of divine kno wledge .” That is as hum an beings bor n of the soul of blood , which in this later creation was adde d to the six pre - hum an soul s of Mother - earth, when the hum an origin was recogni zed as highe r than the earlier and pre - hum an sour ce of soul , such as air, water, and earth. The blood now mixed with the soil of earth is the soul of blood uni ted with the earth or matter in the märchen. The highe st of the seven was but a soul descende d from the mother - blood, with no immortal s park of spirit that was afterwards derived from God the Father who is Atum - Ra; but it was reckone d the supe rior of any soul that was previously derived from the external elements. The seventh alone was cons eque ntly given the human likeness in Child - Horus, or in Atum . Man is created twice ove r in the book of Genesis. The first Adam is formed in the image of the Elohi m or elemental powers. The Elohi m said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” (I. 26) . In the second creation man is formed by Iah u - Elohi m, who “breathed the breath of life into his nos trils and man became a living soul ” (II. 7). These are the first and second Adams of Paul’s doc trine. “The first man Adam became a living soul , the last Adam a life - giving spirit. The first man is of t he earth, earthy; the second man is of heaven” (I Cor. XV. 45 - 8). These two as Egyptian are Atum - Horus and Atum - Ra, who are identical in nature with the first and second Horus — the soul in matter and in spirit. The first man was a failure. In a gnos tic vers ion man was formed, but coul d not stand erect, because the seven workm en, the Ali or Elohi m, were una ble to inspire him with an endur ing soul . He writhed and wriggl ed like a worm upon the ground. Then the “pow er above ” took pity on him, seeing the creature had been fashione d in his likeness, and shot forth a spark of life which enabled him to rise erect and live. ( Nat. Genesis, vol . II, p. 39.) The seventh pow er in the hum an image can be traced in 432 legenda ry lore. For example, Apol lodor us the Athenian grammarian relates that there was at one time a tradition current in heaven that the giants or Titans coul d onl y be conque red by the aid of a man; and as he wrote his work on mythol ogy before the era called Christian, this has been taken as poi nting to th e incarnation of a Jewish Jesus. It was a floating fragm ent of old Egypt ’s wisdom . In the battle with the Sebau or the rebels, and the Sut - Typhoni ans, the pow ers of evil are conque red by Horus, who was incarnated in the hum an form on earth as son of the wo man, and who is victor in Amenta ove r death and darkne ss and typi cal rebels, in the person of Amsu - Horus the man in spirit — son of the god in hum an form. Thus the Titans or rebels, called the children of defeat, had already been conque red by the god, who be came incarnate not as a man but in the form of man, from the time when Atum - Horus first assum ed the hum an type as vehicle of the divine."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":" In the Egypt ian mythol ogy the great change in the mode of becom ing and of representing was effected in the cult of Pta h — the change , that is, in the genesis of soul s from the incorpor ation of totemic soul s by the elemental pow ers to the creation of soul s in the hum an image by the one god, Neb - er - ter. This change , which runs through all later mythol ogy , is traceable in Egyp t. Ptah is the link betwixt the elemental pow ers and the spirit - ancestors; the link by means of which the zoot ype passed into the anthrotype ; the gods as Elohi m into the one god , Atum , called the son of Ptah, or Iahu - Elohim in the book of Genesis. Ptah is the first one god of the Egypt ian religion whos e totality was com pounde d from the pre - existent pow ers. The Ali or associate - gods were now com bined in him who was the one god and who comprised the group in one . The group were now the nine or the Put, and Pt ah, as the all - one that was named from the Put. The Put - cycle of gods , which was sum med up in Ptah the one god, as father, will expl ain why and how the Elohi m are plural as a com pany called the Ali, and singl e as the one in whom the pow ers were unified cal led Ptah, who was the biune parent of Atum - Horus in Amenta, and the maker of man, or Atum , with the aid of the seven pow ers that were previous ly extant. The Elohi m, then, we take to be a form of the Put - cycle of Ptah the ope ner of Amenta. As a com pany of a ssociate - gods they originated in the primordial pow ers, which were seven in num ber; seven with the Great Mother; seven with Anup; seven with Taht; seven with Horus; seven with Ptah. When groupe d in the Put - cycle, with Ptah and Atum - Horus adde d as father an d son, the associate - god s are nine in num ber; som etimes called the enne ad of Memphi s, or of Annu. Thus Ptah and his Ali answer to the Phœ nician Elohim, who were one as the highe st El (in the singul ar) and plural in the group of the Elohi m. Ptah was now por trayed as the author of becom ing in the hum an form, and thence the mythical maker of man. He had been represented by the beetle and the frog as the transformer in matter. Afterwards he is imaged as the hum an embryo in utero, when he had becom e the creator of a hum an soul distingui shed from the totemic or elemental soul , which had been com mon to man and beast. Ptah is por trayed in the monum ents as the creator of the seventh, or human soul . Wilkinson met with a very rare picture of the god 433 who is alone , and who was enga ged in sketching with a pen the figur e of Child - Horus. In other words, he is out lining an image of the hum an soul that was incarnated in the mother - blood and persona lized in Horus as the child of Isis, one form of whom was Tum or Atum - Hor us. Ptah is also por trayed in the image of a male - mother. He is the earliest type of the god with a wom b in whom the male and female nature were uni ted in a biune parent who was divinized as the all - one . We learn from Joseph Thom son’ s travels that when th e Masai of Central Africa get married it is a native custom for the bridegroom to dress himself in wom en’s clothes and wear them for a mont h after the marriage. He is assum ing the pha se of parentage in the gui se of the mother, and literally follow ing suit to the female, because the maternal type and imagery of parentage are still dom inant, and thus the father com es into existence, so to say, as the male - mother. The signi ficance is the same as in the custom of couva de. The father was assum ing the parentage i n the likeness of bot h sexes. Thus Ptah, or Atum , or Osiris, presents a form of the same dua lity as the"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"Australian “man with a vulva,” who in his primitive way was a twofold figur e of the all - one . To recapitulate: in the Egypt ian Genesis “created man” is T um , later Atum , the original of the first man Adam. Atum was the son of the creator Ptah, the earliest biune parent divinized. The seven primordial pow ers had been previous ly recogni zed in nature as the offspring of the mother. Six of these were pre - hum an pow ers or soul s develope d from the external elements. The seventh was the earliest hum an soul , bor n of the mother - blood. This was the blind imperfect soul in matter that was imaged in Child - Horus, An - ar - ef. The soul of all the seven was matriarchal; they w ere the children of the mother onl y. Two other pow ers were adde d to make up the total in the Put - cycle or enne ad of Memphi s. The “doubl e primitive essence” had been assigne d to Ptah. Doctrinally this was the soul of blood derived from the maternal sour ce, in com bination with the spirit of the male. Thence came the hum an soul that was constituted in two halves, the soul in matter and in spirit. This biuni ty was first personi fied in Ptah as the mother and father in one divinity, and, as the biune parent, Ptah gave birth to man, or created his son Atum . In the text from Memphi s the god is called “Ptah of the earth. The mother giving birth to Atum ” (line 14) . Here Atum =Adam has a mother, an item which is omitted from the Hebrew version. Thus Atum - Horus is the pr oduc t of this biune parent; and the seven pow ers that cont ribut ed the seven soul s or cons tituent parts of created man with Ptah and Atum , and the seven associate - gods com pos e the cycle or enne ad of Annu. In this way the Put - cycle of the nine gods cons isted of Ptah and his eight sons ; an eight h one being adde d to the primary seven as the highe st because he was the son of god the father, not merely the product of the mother, like the seven Ali or Elohi m. That son of Ptah was Tum or Atum , bor n as Child - Horus, and one of Atum ’s names or titles is Iu the com ing son, or Iu - em - hetep, he who com es with peace. And in this Iu we propos e to identify the Jewish divinity and also the name of Iah, or Iahu, distingui shed from h v h v (Ihuh ). The com pound title Iahu - Elohi m show s that Iahu 434 is one of the Elohi stic group who was cont inue d in a new rôle as the planter of the garden in the second of the t wo creations in the book of Genesis. In the making of man by Ptah and the Ali or associate - gods , it may be said that man or Tum was created by their being conve rted into man, Tum , or Adam. It was they who made “the dexterity of the hands and the walking o f the feet”; also they “created the sight of the eyes, the hearing of the ears, and the breathing of the nos trils.” In other words, they cont ributed thos e faculties to the creation of the hum an being — such faculties as the sight of the hawk (Horus), the bre athing force of the panting lion (Shu) , the ears of the jackal (Anup) , the nos e or neb of the know ing ibis, the hand of the ape, and others which had been exalted as supe rhum an and were now made use of in the creation of man or Atum by the Kamite Elohi m. T hese pow ers in themselves were inde finitely earlier than Ptah, but in the theology of Memphi s they became auxi liaries to the supr eme one god, and were then held to proceed from him and to becom e his members and his attribut es. The change is indi cated when it is said of Ptah, “His associate - god s in his presence are the teeth and lips, the joints and hands of Atum , for these becom e the associate gods ” (line 10) . The same doc trinal change is appa rent in the"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"Ritual (ch. 17, 4), when it is said of the supr eme on e god, “It is Ra creating his members, which became thos e gods who are with Ra.” Iu, the com ing one , is the ever - com ing son of the father who was re - born as his ow n son; and Iu (or Atum ) with his associate - gods corresponds to Iahu - Elohi m in the Hebrew Gen esis, who follow s the gods of the primary creation in the first chapter. Thus Ptah and his Ali are the prototype s or originals of the Elohi m, in bot h the singul ar and the plural use of the word; whilst Iahu - Elohi m answers to Iu and his associate - gods in th e second creation. This developm ent in the divine character may suppl y a rationa l expl anation of the discrepancy conc erning the name of Iahu in the first two books of the Pentateuch. It is related in Exodus (VI. 2, 3) that “Iahu spake unt o Moses and said u nto him, ‘I am Iahu. I appe ared unt o Abraham, unt o Isaac, and unt o Jacob as El - Shadda i, but by my name Iahu I was not made know n to them.’” Whereas the nam e of Iahu had most certainly been know n from the time of the second creation (Gen. II). This therefor e must be a que stion of the nature, not merely of the name of the deity. If Iahu were one of the group of the Ali=Elohi m he woul d be a son of the mother, one of the Baalim who preceded the fatherhood of Ihuh or Jehova h. The god who was know n by the name of El was also one of the Baalim, Elohi m, or Ali; the first com pany of the associate gods , who ruled unde r the matriarchate. Atum was bor n “Iu” as the son of Ptah at Memphi s, and the same god became the father as Atum - Ra at On. The developm ent is to be trace d in the fact that the first Iu as Egypt ian was onl y a form of god the mother’s son, whereas the later Ihuh had attained the status of the maker, as god the father, who was Atum - Ra in Egypt . Chapter V announc es that “this is the book of the generations of Adam.” In this the previous “generation of the heaven and the earth” are represented as the generations of Adam, who meanw hile had been transformed from the divine Atum of Egypt into the hum an 435 Adam of the Jewish writings , and the genui ne mythos tran smogr ified into a spur ious history. The translators of the Memphi an text poi nt out the extreme likelihood that there were two “originally inde pende nt texts” which have been artificially blende d to produc e a deceptive appe arance of uni ty. This agrees with t he funda mental difference betwixt the Elohi stic and Jehovi stic versions in the book of Genesis, thos e of the Elohi m and Iahu - Elohi m, in which two account s of the creation have been run into one . It is plainly appa rent in the book of Genesis that two origin ally inde pende nt legends of creation have been imperfectly welded toge ther to give an appe arance of uni ty. This is prove d by the two different beginni ngs in which the heaven and earth are formed, and man is made twice ove r. The first chapter cont ains the g enerations of the heaven and the earth when these were created by the Elohi m. The second cont ains the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were created in the day that earth and heaven were made by Iahu - Elohi m. As Egypt ian, these were (1) the Ali, or associate - gods with Neb - er - ter or Kheper - Ptah; and (2) Iu the son of God, who became the one god of bot h the Egypt ians and the Jews, who, as we shall show , were the worshippe rs of Iu= Iahu. The man created by the Elohi m, or Ali, was totemic man, li ke the legenda ry Adam with the tail of an ape, a lion, or other zoot ype . It was thus the elemental"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"pow ers were represented: Sut by the hippopot amus; Sebek by the crocodi le; Atum by the lion; Iu by the ass; Seb by the goos e; Taht by the Ibis; Anup by the ja ckal; Kabhs enuf by the hawk, in whos e likenesses totemic men were imaged. This first man was the Adam, who failed and fell from lack of the vitalizing spark of the indi vidua l fatherhood; the man who was onl y bor n of the group in com muna l marriage unde r the matriarchate. These totemic forbears of man may also account for a Rabbi nical tradition in which it is related that previous to the creation of Eve the man Adam entered into sexua l intercour se with the animals. Which is doubt less an ignor ant misinterpreta tion of the totemic status of man and animals made by theologi ans who were ignor ant of totemic sign - langua ge. Som e of the Rabbi ns asserted that the first man, Adam, was created in the Garden of Eden with a tail like that of an our ang - outang. His tail was a fterwards cut off to improve his appe arance. The legend cont ains a fragm ent of the mythos which has been reduc ed to the status of Jewish märchen. This may furnish anot her link betwixt the Hebrew Adam and the Egypt ian Atum, as the fiery - spirited ape was a t ype of Atum , the solar god of the garden in Amenta. The pre - existent supe rhum an pow ers or associate - gods cont ribut ed all that they had previous ly attained for themselves to cons titute the highe r type of god as father. Atum was bor n as Horus or Iu, child o f the mother, and afterwards develope d into Atum - Ra as god the father. Hence he became the maker or creator of gods and men as the begetter, who succeeded the transformer Kheper - Ptah. The seven primordial pow ers had been recogni zed and divinized as offspri ng of the old First Mother. The Great Mother was com bined with the male in Ptah. Atum , or “created man,” was formed by Ptah as an evol ution from the seven elemental 436 pow ers. These became the seven soul s of Atum - Ra, otherwise called the seven soul s of man; the seven as elements or pow ers that went to the making of the manes in Amenta, or the hum an being when the rende ring was literalized. Thus the evol ution of man, according to the Egypt ian wisdom , was from seven pow ers of the elements, on which a doc tr ine of the seven soul s was founde d. Six of these had been pre - hum an soul s. The seventh alone attained the hum an type and status, whether as Child - Horus or the man as Atum the first father. These soul s of life had been identified and divinized in the mythol ogy: the soul of water as the fish of Sebek, the breathing force as the lion of Shu, the “creeping thing” of earth as the beetle of Kheper - Ptah. Such was the creation of man according to the Egypt ian wisdom . The seven elemental pow ers then furnished his se ven cons tituent parts, or seven soul s, as co - workers with Ptah, and merged themselves in Atum or were absorbed in created man. In the second chapter of Genesis the god Iahu succeeds the Elohi m. As an Egypt ian deity Iu= Iahu was the son of Ptah. The one ness of the father and son, with the son as representative of the father, is a doc trine that was founde d in the cult of Ptah at Memphi s and perpetuated in the religion of Atum - Ra at Annu. It is Atum who says he is bot h the closer and the ope ner, and he is but o ne (Rit., ch. 17) . And it is the father, whether as Ptah or Atum, who com es into being as his ow n son. Also, when Osiris has been mutilated by the murderer Sut he is recons tituted by Horus, and the father lives again in and as the son. It was by his ever - c om ing and"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"cont inua l rebirth that the son brought life and immortality or cont inui ty to light as demons trator in phe nom ena on behalf of god the father. The earliest Egyp tian type of a creator is the moul der or pot ter. The god Khnum , for example, is depicte d as the potter in the act of forming man from the matter of earth. Ptah, som etimes called the son of Khnum , is likewise the divine pot ter. He is por trayed at Philæ in the act of heaping plastic clay upon the potter’s table from which he is about to form t he image of man, which he had sketched in the likeness of Child - Horus. Previous ly the godde sses and gods were shaped in the likenesses of zoot ype s. Khnum himself was ram - headed; Kheper, the former, was beetle - headed. Up to the time of Ptah, or Bes, the Neg roid pygm y, the hum an likeness was not given to any god; and his son Atum - Horus is the earliest divinity in perfect hum an form. Now , as Egyp tian Atum is the original of the Hebrew Adam, it follow s that we are witnessing the creation of Adam from the earth in a mythical representation, when Ptah, the pot ter, shapes the archetypa l man as his son Atum from a lum p of plastic clay. We are also witnessing the creation of man, or of Tum , the son of Ptah, in the hum an likeness, when “the associate - gods as the Ali or Elohi m created the sight of the eyes and the hearing of the ears, the breathing of the nos trils, and sent up that which gave pleasure to the father.” That is to Ptah, who is the father of Tum in this creation of man by the Put - cycle of the primordial po wers, which corresponds to the first creation of Adam by the Elohi m in the first chapter of the Hebrew Genesis. “Then was ordained the utterance of every decision of the tongue , which repeats the deliberation of the heart.” 437 “Now the creation of the g ods ,” that is to say “of Tum and his associate - gods , was when proclamation was made of all the divine names in his wisdom .” “The associate - gods in his presence are as the teeth and lips, the joints and hands of Tum , for these becom e the associate - god s,” or the associate - gods becom e the members and pow ers of Tum , Atum or Adam the created man, who was formed in the likeness of Iahu - Elohi m. We are told in the texts that “men are mortal since the time of Ra,” that is since the time when a father in heaven or in Amenta was depicted in the image of man instead of being represented by som e pre - hum an and totemic type . This was Atum . Atum in the solar mythos was Ra in his first sove reignt y, and Atum =Hebrew Adam was primordial man. Otherwise stated, Atum was the first god delineated in the form of man. Hence men are mortal or human since the time of Atum - Ra (Rit., ch. 17) . Previous ly they might be imaged as beetles and frogs in the time of Ptah, kaf - apes in the time of Taht, crocodi les in the time of Sebek, and hippopo tami, giraffes, or black vul tures in the time of Sut. This difference betwixt the animal and hum an type s is also recogni zed in relation to Ra (Rit., ch. 153 A ) when the first creatures or beings are called “the ancestors of Ra” and “the ancestors of Seb,” a nd are designa ted “worms” to expr ess their inferiority. They were mere reptiles in com parison with the hum an type . In the Hebrew Genesis, when the man as Adam was created (I. 26) he was to have dom inion ove r all creatures of the water, air, and earth. And Atum , or Tum in the Ritual (ch. 79) , is designa ted “the Lord of all creatures,” that is when he makes his appe arance in the figur e of man, who is described as being “in the form of the Lord of all creatures” (Rit., ch. 82) . Atum , whom com es as the uni que o ne god in the form of man, is hailed in the Ritual as the lord of heaven who “issues forth"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"from the earth and createth whatever is begot ten,” and “who giveth vigou r to the men now living. ” “I am sum med up as Atum ,” says the speaker (Rit., ch. 83). As Atum he exclaims, “I am a soul , and my soul is divine. It is the self - originating force.” The speaker, in the character of Atum - Ra, who makes his adve nt as a man, expl ains that the seven Uræus - divinities formed his body , but his soul is divine. It is an image o f the eternal. These Uræi were a type of the seven primordial pow ers that were groupe d and uni fied in one , whether as god or man. They are companions , seven in num ber, who became the associate - gods of Ptah in his creative work, and who were afterwards abso rbed in Atum as cons tituents of his body, or the means of his embodi ment as man. The ascent of soul through various elemental pha ses of existence is allude d to in one of the “sayings of Jesus” when it is said that the fow ls of the air, the beasts of the e arth, and the fishes of the sea all “draw us” to the kingdom . These led the way as elemental and pre - hum an soul s. A soul of the air was imaged by the bird; a soul of earth was imaged by the beast, or reptile; a soul of water by the fish; a soul of vegetati on by the shoot or branch; and so on through the series, all of which were offspring of the Great Mother. But the highe st soul was now derived from god the father as an effluence of the hol y spirit. Therefore it is said, “The kingdom of heaven is within yo u; and whos oever shall know himself shall find it.” “Know your selves (then), and you shall be aware that ye are sons of 438 the Father.” Horus in his resurrection, at his second adve nt, came to proclaim the father as the begetter of a spirit that shoul d attain eternal life. He also came to persona te that spirit in the likeness of the father to the manes in Amenta. Atum , the Egypt ian holy spirit, was the author of that spirit by which totemic man became a living soul . With the Egypt ians the soul was of bot h sexes. The divine being, as Ptah, Atum , or Osiris, was of a biune nature. Hence Ptah and Osiris are por trayed as the male and female in one image, and this one prototypa l soul was discreted as hum an in the two sexes. In passing through Amenta the hum an s oul is represented as the male accom panied by the female, the wife, sister, or som e other female as suppl emental to the male. This soul , divided in the two halves of sex, was uni ted again in establishing an eternal soul . One form of the dua l type is imaged by the twins, Shu and his sister Tefnut , who are blende d in Tattu. They represent the soul that had been discreted in two sexes which is joined in one again to fulfil the likeness of the eternal spirit Atum - Ra, who was self - divided in the brother who wear s her emblem on his head, and who is the twofold type of a dua l soul now uni fied in one . Thus the soul that lived for ever was held to be established for eternity by the female being blende d with the male. Now amongs t the primitive races, African, Melanesi an and others, the wom en will vol unteer to be strangl ed at the fune ral, or buried alive in the graves of their hus bands (or the chiefs), believing it to be solely in com pany with the male that they can reach the realms of bliss; and the favour ite wife in t he abode of the blessed is held to be the one who meets her death with the greatest fortitude . That is, by the female being blende d with the male in death, as Tefnut was blende d with, or absorbed in, Shu. When the hum an soul had been derived from the esse nce of the male instead of the blood of the female, the wom an was naturally derived from the man, as she"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"is in the second of the Hebrew creations described in the book of Genesis. A soul derived from Atum was dua l in sex. This soul was divided into Adam an d Eve, the typi cal two sexes of the Hebrew legend. Adam was Atum in the original mythos , and the soul derived from Atum was discreted in Adam and Eve, as the two sexes derived from the one primordial soul , which was figur ed first as the soul of Shu and Tef nut in the Egypt ian mythos . Tefnut was not cut out of the side of Shu, but she was depicted as the hinde r half of the lion with Shu as the fore - part. Atum was the lion as representative of the soul or force, and the lion was severed in two parts, head and tail, as the dua l type of Shu and Tefnut , which preceded the anthropom orphi c representation in Adam and Eve. So late is the Hebrew rende ring com pared with the Egypt ian. The “self - splitting” of Atum is show n in the mutilation of his members. Hence we have m ade the sugge stion that in the rite of sub - incision practised by the most primitive of races, like the Australian Arunt a, this “self - splitting” of the male denot ed the claim of the man to being the pot ential sour ce of bot h sexes, and that, whereas the male was derived from the female unde r the matriarchate, it was now asserted that the wom an was made from the man in a process of self - splitting illustrated by the practice of sub - incision, and by the later creation of the female from the male in the mythol ogy . Queen 439 Hatshepsu claimed that the true image of the creator was formed by a com bination of the mother and the male in one , which image she persona ted unde r her title of Mat - Ka - Ra, the true image of Ra, but gave pre - eminence to female nature as the b ringe r - forth from the beginni ng. The picture of the male ende avour ing to take the place of the female as produc er of the child is at times exceedingl y pathetic. He carved the likeness of the female member on his ow n, as do the Arunt a in their rites to - day, and masque raded as “the man with a vul va.” He wore the wom an’s garb in marriage. In the custom of couva de he went to bed to becom e a mother like Ptah, and to nur se the new - born little one . In the earliest mythol ogy the wom an was dom inant. Men derived the ir descent from the mothers. This was in the time of the first creation. In the second, when the wom an was derived from the man, (even by a surgical ope ration) , the male com es uppe rmost, the matriarchal wom an succum bs to patriarchal man. This is glanced at obl ique ly in the doom pronounc ed upon the wom an by Iahu - Elohi m for “plucking the forbidde n fruit.” “Unto the wom an he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and conc eption; in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy hus ban d, and he shal l rule over thee.” There is to be an end of matriarchal supr emacy, and descent, as previous ly reckone d from the motherhood, is to be suppr essed in this the second of two creations for the Adamic race. The two races of Adam are referred to by Esdras (II. VI. 55 - 56) : “O Lord, thou madest the world for our sakes. As for the other peopl e, which also com e of Adam , thou hast said that they are not hing, but be like unt o spittle.” Both were Adamic, how ever, but the first came from the red earth or the mother - blood onl y; the second were derived from the fatherhood. In the Latin version of Esdras thos e who are not hing are the peopl e of the first - born world, whereas thos e of the second creation are called the “onl y - begot ten.” In the mythical rende ring of this twofoldne ss the first Horus was bor n but not begot ten. He was the child of the mother onl y. The second"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"Horus is the onl y begot ten of the father, twice bor n and onc e begot ten. In the primary pha se he corresponds to the totemic peopl e who were bor n unde r the matriarchate, thos e of the first - bor n world. In the second he is a representative of the peopl e who are called the “onl y begot ten” because they are the children of the fathers. The two primary castes or classes of Aryas in India, the sons of light an d the children of darkne ss, were based upon the same original distinction betwixt thos e who were bor n of the matriarchate and thos e who are begot ten unde r the divinized fatherhood. The Rabbi ns have retained som e fragm ents of totemic tradition without the g nos is. It is said in the Targum of Palestine, “The Lord God created man in two formations .” This dua l formation, or creation, is com mon to the märchen, which we are tracing to the original mythos . The first men recogni zable were made of red earth, which, w hen interpreted, means that flesh was shapen from the mother’s blood . Then, say the Melbour ne blacks, the god Punge l blew the spirit of life into the man at his navel ( Nat. Gen., vol . II, pp. 34 - 40) . The Arunt a tribes likewise hol d that the animistic spiri t enters the navel to cause conc eption in their wom en. In the Egypt ian texts it is 440 also said of thos e who derive from the mother, the Amu, the Tamehu, and the Negroes, “Sekhe t has created them and she creates their soul s,” the soul s that were created unde r the matriarchate, and were onl y soul s of blood, whereas the Ruti were derived from Ra the hol y spirit. In a magical text suppos ed to be of Akka dian origin there is a version of the “cutting out ” of the wom an from the man which is a little nearer to nature than the creation of the female from a rib of the male in the Hebrew Genesis. It is said the wom an was derived from the flank of the man. (Boscawen.) Scattered fragm ents of the ancient wisdom now identified as Kamite are often to be found in what th e Christian writers ignor antly scout as the wild and fool ish fables or the absurd fancies of egregious Talmudi sts. Here is an instance. It is related that the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam whilst he extracted som ething from his members which was dispersed ove r the globe so that the whol e earth might be inha bited by his seed ( Ende ckt. Jude nthum ). This account is nearer to the original than the version given in Genesis. The creation of the hum an race by Atum is biologi cal. The “doubl e primitive ess ence” of life was first assigne d to Ptah. This cons isted of blood and protozoa, and the twin sour ce was persona lized in Atum , who as creator was an image of the male and female blende d in one person. Atum is described as produc ing his children by spont aneo us emission, and also by the drawing of blood from his members, which was a way of show ing the dua lity of sour ce that was made one in the primal parent thus personi fied in Atum or in Adam, and in the male with the image of the female cut twice ove r on his member, onc e in the ovoi d figur e and onc e in the ope ning by sub - incision. According to the second Hebrew account of creation, “Iahu - Elohi m formed man of the dus t of the ground and breathed into his nos trils the breath of life” (Gen. II. 7), which can have no direct relations hip to aught that ever did occur in this our hum an world, nor had it any such signi fication in the esoteric version of the mystery teachers. But this can be follow ed in the mysteries of Amenta, in which Ptah was the vivifier of the mane s for the afterlife. The process of vivification was by ope ning the mout h of the dead and inspiring the breath of life into the nos trils. In the chapter by"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"which the mout h of a person is ope ned for him in the earth of Ptah the Osiris pleads, “Let my mout h be ope ned by Ptah, and let the muzzles which are on my mout h be loos ed by the god of the dom ain. Let my mout h be ope ned by Ptah with that instrument of steel or ba - metal wherewith he ope neth the mout hs of the gods and the manes.” (Renouf , Rit., ch. 23. ) Br eath was restored to thos e who had been deprived of it. In the chapter by which air is given in the nether - world it is said, “O Atum , let there com e to me the air which is in thy nos trils” (chs. 54 and 56). Again, the Osiris says, “My nos trils are ope ned i n Tattu,” the place of being permanently established; and by these ceremoni es performed in mysteries man became a breathing soul after he had passed into the land of life. For it was the man who had died on earth to reappe ar as a sahu - mum my in Amenta whos e mout h was ope ned and his nos trils inspired with the breath of second life derived from Atum - Iu= Iu - Elohi m. Atum likewise is the giver of breath in the new life of 441 Amenta. He gives it to the spirit in the egg. This is a re - creation of Adam, or man, a s manes in the earth of eternity, not the creation of a hum an being from the dus t on the surface of our earth, as it has been misrende red in the Hebrew version. The legend of the fall is not reproduc ed in the first account of the Hebrew creation. In this, hom o had been created male and female in the likeness of the Elohim or the pow ers which were imaged by zoot ype s. The first Adam was totemic man with a tail, who is said to have had conne ction with all or any of the animals. In the second chapter of Genesi s the first formation by the Elohi m is not recogni zed in the hum an figure as man. For it is said “there was not a man to till the ground. ” Now , the real man com es into being as “a living soul .” Iahu - Elohi m breathes into his nos trils the breath of life. Iah u - Elohi m is the author of a new creation; and it is this second Adam for whom the garden eastward is planted in Eden. “And there he put the man whom he had formed,” into the Garden of Eden to cultivate it, or “to dress it and to keep it” (II. 15). These tw o creations answer to the two creations in the Egypt ian Genesis, which are the creation of Amenta by Ptah and his associate - gods the Ali=Elohi m, and the creation of the garden for Atum and his associate - gods . In the Hebrew, Iahu and his Elohi m take the sec onda ry place of Tum and his associate - gods in the original. And how ever shadow y som e of this may seem, the shadow is all there was to go upon so long as the subs tance was out of sight — the subs tance which is Egypt ian. The Litany of Ra describes itself as b eing “the boo k of the worship of Ra,” and identifies Atum with Ra in Amenta. It is said that “when anyone reads this book, the por celain figur es are placed upon the ground at the hour of suns et — that is, of the trium ph of Ra ove r his enemies in Amenta” (Lit any of Ra). When he arrives in the Amenta at suns et, “his form is that of the old man”; in his resurrection his form is that of the lion. He sets as Ra; he rises again as Horus. Atum in Amenta is the hidde n soul of life that was imaged by the noc turnal sun . He is the supr eme power who dw ells in darkne ss and causes the principles to arise. He is “the pillar of Amenta” like the Tat with which Ptah suppor ted the sky. He is manifested or bor n as his ow n son; he who was Ra as father is Horus as the son — Atum in t he western mount , and Horus in the east. He is worshippe d as the supr eme pow er in seventy - five characters, unde r the same num ber of names. Atum is the one god who is always depicted in the hum an form, and who therefore enters"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"Amenta in the shape of man for the ove rthrow al of Apap the mons ter and all the pow ers of evil. Atum not onl y passed into the Hebrew legends as the earthly father in the book of Genesis, but also as the Adam Kadm on ( ] y mdq =cdX ) of the Kabalah, who is the primordial, archetypa l man, the heavenly man or man from heaven. The first Adam, like the first Horus, was finite and imperfect; the second was infinite and perfect. These are the first and second Adam according to the doc trine of Paul, who tells us that “the first man is of the earth, e arthy; the second man is of heaven.” The first man Adam became a living soul . 442 The last Adam became a life - giving spirit. How beit, that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural. Now , as Atum is the god who follow ed Ptah as a birth of the Put - cycle, he is the tenth, and the god of the ten circles of Ra (Rit., ch. 18) is now called the creator of the nine. This was done in the process of com poundi ng and unifying the pow ers, and of exalting the latest in the developm ent to the pos ition o f the first in status. The present poi nt is that in an addr ess to Amen, a form of Atum , it is said, “The gods proceeded from thee. Thou didst create the nine gods at the beginni ng of all things , and thou wast the lion - god of the twin lion - gods .” (Budge , Th e Gods of the Egyptians , vol. II, p. 88.) This was in the cour se of making the latest in developm ent first in status, which was the com mon cour se in the evol ution of Ra. Thus in the cycle of Ptah the gods were nine in num ber. With Atum adde d as Ra, the num ber is ten; and as Ptah was called the father of the eight , so Atum is the father of the nine. In the hym ns to Amen - Ra he is ador ed as one and the same with Atum ; hence we infer that “Amen” is a later title of Atum as the hidde n god of Amenta, the secret e arth, the garden in which was made for him by his father Ptah. The obj ect of the present comparison is to sugge st that these ten pow ers or pot encies were the originals of the ten Sephi roth which cons tituted the heavenly Adam Kadm on of the Kabalists, and wh ich, according to the metaphys ical doc trine, were the means whereby the En - Soph, the infinite or boundl ess, manifested within bounds (Ginsbur g, The Kabal ah ). Atum , as we reckon, was the builder of the heaven in ten divisions which preceded the final one in twelve. There is no Garden of Eden created in the first chapter of Genesis. No tree of life or know ledge was planted, nor is there any prohi bition against eating the fruit of the tree. On the cont rary, the primal pair, the male and female, are told that every herb and every tree are given to them for food. The theology of the Elohim differs from that of Iahu - Elohi m. This agrees with a non - Semitic version of the creation legend ( Records, New Series, vol . VI), in which there is no garden created, no mention of man being placed in the garden to tend it; no tree of life, nor tree of know ledge ; and no temptation by the serpent, or story of the Fall. The primal paradise, that of Shu and the seven suppor t - gods in Am - Khemen, is thus differentiated from the garden of Ptah in the seconda ry creation or representation. To reach the Kamite root of the matter we have to distingui sh betwixt the making of Amenta and the planting of the garden eastward. When “the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the hos t of them, ” man was formed; then Iahu - Elohi m planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed, to dress it and to keep it. We have now to tell the story of Eden from the"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"inde finitely older doc um ents, legenda ry fragm ents of which have b een mixed up toge ther by the Elohi stic and Jehovi stic narratives in the book of Genesis. Amenta and the garden of rest were not created for man the mortal, as mortal, on this earth. The man who was brought into being and placed in the garden to protect th e tree of life and defend it from the depredations of the evil Apap, the serpent of darkne ss, the dragon of drough t, the devour ing reptile, was man in the likeness0of Atum , or 443 man the manes; the onl y man in the garden of Amenta, whether this is calle d the Aarru - Sekhe t (field) or Gan - Eden. The primal paradise was founde d on the natural fact of the oasis. Follow ing this, the fundamental idea of a paradise made by hum an workm anship is an enclosure in which there was a tree or plants for food and an unf at hom able well - spring of water for drink. It was the oasis with som e kind of fence about it, which survives in the “little garden walled around” that is sung of in a mode rn hym n. Now , when the nom ads of the equa torial regions wande red northw ard they left the ir primal paradise behind them as a geogr aphi cal locality. This suffered a subs idence, in com mon with the sout hern pol e, and was hidde n beneath the hor izon to becom e the legenda ry paradise that sank dow n unde r the waters and was lost, as woul d be indi cated by the disappe aring gui de - stars, to becom e a subj ect of the Egypt ian astro - mythol ogy . The legend of a paradise, or state of supr eme blessedne ss, that was lost through the eating of forbidde n food , or in not keeping the law of tabu, is indigenous to Inne r Africa. It is the story of the first man, Khentu, in Uganda , previous ly cited. Dr. Nassau offers evidence that the Bantu tribes (who extend ove r a qua rter of the cont inent) have the legend of a great chief who always warned peopl e not to eat the fruit of a certain tree, but who ate of it himself and died. In anot her native legend it was a wom an who brought the fruit of a forbidde n tree to her village. She swallow ed it to hide it, and then became pos sessed of an evil spirit, which was the beginni ng of witch craft. (Nassau, F., Fetishism in West Africa, p. 40.) It is an ancient tradition that the hom eland of the human race was actual at the sour ces of the Nile. Milton allude s to and repeats it in his “Paradise unde r the Æthiop line by Nilus’ head.” The Rabbi ns likewise affirm that “Paradise is localized unde r the middle line of the world, where the days are always of equa l lengt h.” That is in equa torial regions . Such a tradition, how ever true, coul d onl y com e to us by means of mythol ogy and the folk - tales. The Sekhe t - Aarru or field of papyr us - reed was one name of this oasis on high, which was a heaven of boundl ess food and drink, and therefore a paradise of plenty. The poi nt to be established now is that water and vegetable food were the primeval elements of lif e in equa torial Africa in such abunda nce as to cons titute a permanent ideal; and these were cons tellated later in the nor thern heaven by the Egypt ians as a picture of an earthly paradise that “onc e upon a time,” som ewhere or other, had been geogr aphi cal. N ow , this circum pol ar paradise upr aised by Shu in Am - Khemen was reproduc ed with improve ments and addi tions in the earthly paradise or garden of Amenta, the stellar imagery being repeated in the solar mythos . The mount of glory, the tree on the sum mit, the s our ce of the water of life, the Apap - reptile of drought , the yout hful hero and other type s established in the uppe r paradise, were dupl icated in the paradise below — the garden enclosed by Ptah for Atum his son to cultivate. The uppe r"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"was the circum pol ar par adise upon the stellar mount of glory in the region of the stars that never set. At first there was the water onl y, called the celestial sea or lake. The pol e was imaged by the stalk, the reed or papyrus that was planted in the waters as the sign of a fixe d suppor t in a doubl e sense. This 444 became the later tree in the midst of the garden or cultivated enclosure. In the Pyramid Texts it is called the kha t - en - ankhu or tree of life, on the fruit of which the gods and the glorified were fed. When the garde n in Amenta was created by Ptah this paradise of rest was repeated in the earth of eternity, to becom e the earthly paradise of the manes in the Book of the Dead. As previous ly show n, the Jewish Kabalists preserve the tradition of an uppe r and a low er para dise. Manasseh Ben - Israel says, “Thos e who are learned in the Kabalah affirm that there is a paradise here on earth below .” Between the two it is said there is a pillar fixed that joins the two toge ther, which is called “the strengt h of the hill Zion” ( Nis hm ath Kajim, ff. 25, 26; Stehelin vol . II, pp. 2 - 8), and which corresponds to the ladde r and the moun t in the Ritual. The uppe r paradise, he says, is called by seven names: (1) The bundl e of life, (2) the tabernacle of the Lord, (3) the hol y hill, (4) the cour ts of the Lord, (5) the hous e of the Lord, (6) the hill of the Lord, (7) the holy place. He likewise gives the seven appe llations of the low er paradise: (1) The garden of Eden, (2) the palace of the Lord, (3) the land of the living, (4) the sanctuary o f God, (5) the city of God, (6) the dw elling of the Lord, (7) the lands of the living. Notwithstandi ng the vague ness of a later generalization, we may see (1) the garden of Amenta in “the garden of Eden”; (2) the palace of the prince in “the palace of the Lord” (Rit., ch. 1); (3) the earth of the living in “the land of the living” ; (4) the shrine in the midst of the earth in “the sanctuary of God. ” The ladde r that is raised up in Amenta for the glorified to get a glimpse of the gods (Rit., ch. 149) , when th e manes says, “I raise my ladde r up to the sky to see the gods ,” is repeated in the pillar that is the means of com muni cation betwixt the low er and the uppe r paradise. By this (says the Jalkut Kodas h, f. 57, c. 2) they are joined toge ther, and it is called “the strengt h of the hill Zion,” the hill which touc hes the sky being anot her Egypt ian figure of the means of ascent. “By this pillar, on every Sabba th and festival, the right eous climb up, and refresh themselves with a glimpse of the divine majesty, till the end of the Sabba th or festival, when they slide down and return to the low er paradise.” The heptanom is is repeated in the plan of both the low er and uppe r paradise. In bot h there are seven mansions or dw ellings for the reward of the right eous . All the glory, the excellency, the delight which the right eous obt ain in the uppe r paradise is prepared for them in the low er paradise. In the vigne ttes to the Ritual the ba - soul is seen ascendi ng and descendi ng the ladde r to visit the mummy in the tom b. In like manne r it is said in Nishm ath Kajim (f. 28, c. 1) that every twelve months after leaving the body the deceased descend and visit it, because they cannot be absolutely separated from their mum mies. Like other mythical type s, the twofold paradise passed on into the legenda ry lore of various lands . It is to be seen in the enclosure of Yima in the Avesta. In one form this is Eran Veg, the paradise that was in the beginni ng, or in the first time, the paradise upon the mount of glory answering to the Am - Khemen t hat was upr aised by Shu. Amenta, the secret earth of eternity, is also identifiable when it is said the hum an"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"race shall be recons tituted in Yima’s enclosure; and for that reason it was made in a secret place=Amenta (Avesta). 445 It was in Amenta, the se cret earth, that Osiris and the Osirified were recons tituted for the life hereafter. The Garden of Eden in the Hebrew Genesis is called the garden eastward. This is the pos ition of the Aarru - garden in Amenta. It was on the eastern side of the mount of glor y, in the very depths of dawn. According to the Ritual, life originated in the garden eastward. Hence it is there the man as manes inha les the breath of a new life (ch. 57) , and drinks the water of life and plucks the fruit from the tree of life. An oasis is the figur e that was follow ed by Ptah in making the garden of Aarru in Amenta. A mound or rampart is described as bui lt around the water and the plants or tree at the centre, to protect them and to keep the Apap - serpent from the sacred precincts where At um - Ra “freque nteth the persea tree of life.” “I know this field of Aarru, with the ba - enclosure,” says the Osiris in the Ritual (ch. 109 , 4). The enclosing wall was made of ba, a word that meant earth at one time, then iron, and lastly steel, as the rampar t was characterized according to the progr ess made in work from earth to iron and from one metal to anot her. This zeriba or barrier not withstandi ng, the destroyer night by night and year after year was cont inua lly breaking into the beautiful garden of Aarr u, to drink up the water and to wither the tree of life. The abys s within the earth from whence the water welled with life in the beginni ng, the abys s that is conf igur ated in the sout hern heaven, was repeated in making the garden of Amenta. It is described in the Ritual as the Tuat “which nobody can fathom ,” which “sends forth light in the dark night ,” and “the offerings from which are eatable plants” (ch. 172) . Also there are two lakes of water in Amenta, one of which is designa ted “the great Deep” (Rit., ch. 17). This agrees with the abys s which nobody can fathom (ch. 172) . Thus the beginni ng with the abyss, the breaking forth of light, the water welling from the abys s, and the primeval food issuing from the water were repeated and preserved. The tree of l ife was planted in the water of life as the persea or ash, which is the tree of life by name in Egypt ian, and which had taken the place of the papyrus - reed as the sign of vegetation. When the Garden of Eden was created the tree of life is said to be in th e midst of the garden, “and a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.” We shall find the same water goi ng forth from the Aarru - garden in Amenta. The original river that issued from the lake of the a bys s at the centre of the garden is determined by the 150t h chapter of the Ritual, in which it is said the four teenth division is “the dom ain of Kher - aba; the deity in it is the Nile.” The river that went forth from the circum pol ar paradise represented the Milky Way, whereas the water that issued from the midst of the garden in Amenta is the divinized river Nile (Rit., ch. 149) . Also in this form the celestial Nile is traced to its earthly sour ce in the lakes and to the pow ers of the inunda tion or high floo d in the sout h. Thus the Egypt ian Ritual, which is not to be gainsaid, indubi tably show s that the river which “went out of Eden to water the garden” in the original version of the mythos was the river Nile reproduc ed as the water - sour ce of life in the gard en of Amenta. On entering the low er earth the departed spirit prays, “May there "},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"446 be given to me a hom estead in the fields of Aarru” (Rit., ch. 15) . And again, the speaker for the pair says, “Open ye to the gods (or divinized spirits) who cam e to cult ivate the soil and grow the food” (in this earth of eternity). “Let the god Amsu, the divine hus bandm an, give me the ground to till. Let the god of green things ope n his arms to me,” as giver of abunda nce. (124, 5.) In the Egypt ian original this delight ful garden is the place in which the spirit was refreshed “unde r any type it wished” — a mode of saying that it offered all that heart coul d desire, and to wish was to have. It was the typi cal land of grapes and peaches, where the plenty flow ed in rivers of mil k and hone y according to the Hebrew repor t. But it was likewise a land of labour and industry — no lubbe r - land of lotus - eating laziness. In the true Egypt ian representation worship is work, and in these fields of food “They suck no honeycomb of drowsy pe ace Be cause ennobling natural cares all cease; They live no life, as many dream, caressed By some vast tideless sea of endless rest; For there, as here, unbusy is unblest.” In proceeding to this elysium the Osiris takes the good path to th e fields of flood. He says, “A divine dom ain hath been cons tructed for me: I know the name of it, the name of it is the garden of Aarru”=Eden (ch. 109) . “I know the place where to plough the earth and mow the corn, to collect the harvest in it daily. I am in it, I prevail in it, I unde rstand in it; food is in my hands from the lord of earth” (ch. 110) . This agricultural mode of earning an eternal living was typi fied by every one of the shebti figures set up in the tom bs with the hoe of the hus bandm an in the ir hands. It is said, “When thou hast mow ed with the soul s, having kept their stride to the closed gates, thou art acqui tted, and appr oachest thy hous e after thy labour s, to the delight of thy two soul s.” The Aarru paradise in Amenta is also the garden of the two trees, the same as the Hebrew Garden of Eden. A form of Eden is undoubt edly Babyl oni an, even by name. According to the native tradition, the type was localized in Eridu, the place of the eternal tree or stalk at the centre of the circum pol ar parad ise, or of Eridu in the firmamental water termed “the abys s.” In the mythos the Great Mother is called “the divine lady of Edin,” and also “the godde ss of the tree of life.” As the tree she brings forth her child, the branch, the same as Hathor doe s in Egy pt. The name of Hathor signi fies the hous e of Horus, as the tree. So the Great Mother Zikum is the hous e of Tammuz, as the tree that grew in Eridu. But the Egypt ian stalk of the uat or papyr us plant is inde finitely earlier than the typi cal tree. One fact o f itself will serve to show that the biblical Eden was not derived from the Assyrian Edin, because in this garden there is but a singl e tree, which is appa rently the tree of life. The divine lady of Edin is the godde ss of the tree of life, and there is no mention of a tree of know ledge . Secondl y, the serpent as a type of evil in the book of Genesis is not the Babyl oni an dragon Tiamat. The biblical dragon is of neither sex, whereas Tiamat is female. The Hebrew dragon or evil serpent is the Apap of Egypt from Genesis to Revelation. Apap is a water - reptile whos e dw elling 447 "},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"is at the bot tom of the dark waters called the void of Apap, from which it rises in rebellion as the representative of drough t. This is the serpent described by Amos: “Though they be hid from my sight in the bot tom of the sea, thence will I com mand the serpent, and he shall bite them” (Amos IX. 3). Another reason. The Hebrew Eden is in a land that was watered by a mist that went up from the ground, and where no rain fell on the earth (Gen. II. 5 - 6). That land above all earthly prototype s was Egypt , which assuredly did not suffer like Babyl oni a from the “curse of rain,” from which the Akka dian mont h “As - an” was named. But there was a pre - solar paradise enclosure which had but one tree in it. This as Egypt ian is the paradise of Am - Khemen, which Shu upl ifted with his two - pronge d prop that images the pol e, when he divided earth from heaven and raised the uppe r circum pol ar paradise. Paradise, says Ibn Ezra, is the place of one tree. Mount Hetep in the northern heaven is a kind of typi cal one - tree - hill. In som e of the Mexican drawings there is a poi nt of departure by water from the mount which has a singl e tree upon its sum mit. This we look on as the tree which represents the pol e, the “one - tree - h ill” of a legend that is uni versal. This typi cal one - tree - hill is also to be found at Sakapu in Manchur ia, where it is represented by a mount ain designa ted “lone tree hill.” The Norse tree Yggdr asil is singl e. Nor is there more than one tree or stalk in th e garden of Eridu, where the Great Mother is the lady of the eternal tree. The eternal tree was certainly the pol e. Its even branches show it to have been a num erical type of the heptanom is. Hence we infer that in the circum pol ar paradise there was but one tree as a figur e of the nor thern pol e of heaven. The Chinese Fu - tree, the self - supp orting, is likewise a figure of the pol e. Hence it is said to grow on the sum mit of a mount ain in mid - ocean at the nor th, and it is 300 Chinese miles in height . (Schlegel, Prof. G., Fou - Sang Kono .) There is not hing gained by calling this the tree of the uni verse instead of the pol e. That is onl y to lose in vague ness all that the astronom ers had gained by their definiteness. The two trees in the Garden of Eden can be account ed for upon Egypt ian ground, but on no other; one being the tree of the pole in the stellar mythos , the other the tree of life or of dawn in the garden eastward. The two typi cal trees are recogni zable as Egypt ian in the Book of the Dead. In one chapter (97 th) they are called the two divine sycamores of heaven and earth. The sycamore of heaven is identified as the tree of Nut. It stands in the “lake of equi poi se,” which is at the celestial pol e. The tree of earth is the tree of Hathor and of dawn. Atum - Ra, t he solar god, is also described as com ing forth from betwixt the two trees. “I know thos e two sycamores of emerald, between which Ra com eth forth as he adva nces ove r the firmament” (ch. 109) . The tree of earth, or Hathor, and the tree of heaven, or Nut, we re brought on together and uni ted in the tree of bur ial for the mum my. Wherever it was pos sible the Egyptian coffin was made from wood of the sycamore tree, the kha t - en - ankhu , or tree of life, so that the dead might be taken in the embrace of the mother of life, who was represented by the tree. This was Hathor as bringe r to birth in the mythol ogy , and Nut the bringer of soul s to 448 their rebirth in the eschatology. The relative pos itions of these two godde sses with the tree were illustrated by the pictur es painted on the coffin. Hathor as a form of the mother - earth, the tree - form, is por trayed inside the coffin on the boa rd upon which the mum my"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"rested, taking the dead to her embrace as the mother of life. Nut, the mother - heaven, was represented on the inn er part of the coffin - lid arching ove r the mum my as bringe r of the manes to new life above . It was bur ial in the tree when the tree had com e to be elabor ately carved in the shape of a coffin. This sym bol ized a resurrection of the spirit from the tree of li fe as Horus rose again from out the tree of dawn. Now when Amenta was planted by Ptah, the father of Atum , several features of the circum pol ar paradise, as before said, were not onl y repeated, they were dup licated. One of these was the typi cal tree. The tr ee of the pol e remained as the central suppor t of the uni verse, the tree of the three worlds, i.e., of Amenta, earth and heaven (Egypt ian), Arali, earth and heaven (Babyl oni an), hell, mid - gard and heaven (Norse), and others that might be adde d. In Egypt th is was almost supe rseded by the tat of Ptah, which is a pillar of the four corners based upon the tree as type of the pol e when this was erected in Amenta. Thus , the primal paradise was the place of one tree. The paradise or garden in Amenta is the place o f two trees — because the ground - rootage had been doubl ed in phe nom ena. These two trees appe ar in the Ritual as the tree of Hathor and the tree of Nut; the tree of earth and the tree of heaven; the tree of the north and the tree of the east. The tree of Hat hor was a tree of life in Egypt . It was the sycamore - fig tree, from the fruit of which a divine drink of the mysteries was made. Therefore it was a tree to make one wise, which became a tree of wisdom or abnor mal know ledge . The tree of Nut was the tree of heaven and eternal life, hence it was designa ted the eternal tree. As herein sugge sted, the two trees originated as a dua l sym bol of the two pol es in Equa toria. These were cont inue d in two tree - pillars called Sut - and - Horus by Ptah in his making of Amenta. Again they are repeated in the garden or cultivated enclosure of Eden. Here they are called the tree of know ledge and the tree of life. As show n in the vigne ttes to the Book of the Dead, the tree or eatable plant and the water suppl ied the elements of life to the manes in the low er paradise. The godde ss Nut pour s out the water and offers the fruit of the tree to Ani and his wife, when he has reached the garden of Amenta (Pap. of Ani, plate 16) . The pole had been the tree first planted in the astronom ical my thology. It was the tree of Nut, or heaven, in the stellar pha se, and being astronom ical it was naturally the tree of know ledge . But in the making of the nether earth a second tree was planted in the garden eastward. The mythos now was solar, and this was the tree of dawn, the tree of wet or dew, which was a veritable tree of life in Egypt . It was the emerald sycamore of Hathor in her character of godde ss of the leafy - green dawn. The first was the tree in the most ancient stellar mythos , the second was adde d as an equi noc tial type , the sycamore of earth now root ed in the land of dawn. This is the tree in which Child - Horus, the young solar god, proclaims himself to be the newbor n babe (Rit., ch. 42) at his com ing forth as the sun of anot her day, 449 or the offspring of Hathor . He com es forth from between the two sycamores just as the good shephe rd or roya l Horus issues from betwixt the two trees in the sym bol ism of the Rom an catacom bs (Bosio, Rom . Sot t., p. 311 ; Lundy, in Mon Christ y . ). It is related in a le gend cited by M. de Gube rnatis that the tree of Adam reaches to hell, Sheol, or Amenta with its root s, and to heaven with its branches, and that the infant Jesus lives in the top of the tree ( M. des Pl., vol . I, 18), like Horus, Unbu, and Bata. This, like a thous and other"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"things related of the divine, that is mythical, child, woul d be extremely interesting if the legend had not been put forth unde r the false pretence of its being historical. The only infant in the tree, who finally suppl ied the subj ect of a nursery song, “Hush - a - by Baby on the Tree - Top, ” was the yout hful god whos e cradle was the tree of dawn, and who says in the Ritual (ch. 42) , “I am the babe. I am the god within the tamarisk.” The tree of Adam was the tree of Atum in the garden of the low e r Aarru which Horus or Jesus (the Su of Atum ) climbs when he goe s upw ards from the garden to the eastern heaven. The infant was also Horus on his uat - papyr us, a sym bol of the earth amidst the waters of the Nun, and a co - type of the tree of dawn (Rit., ch. 17) . In one representation, the child issues from the papyr us or lotus, in anot her from the tree. Horus the Shoot of the Papyrus. The sun as soul of life in the tree of dawn is proba bly the nature - type of the soul in the bus h, the “bus h - soul ” of vari ous African races, i.e., the spirit of vegetation and food. The name of Heitsi - Eibib the Hottentot deity in his solar character signi fies the one who appe ars in the tree, misrende red by Hahn as the “one who has the appe arance of a tree.” The god was not th e tree itself but the pow er appe aring in the tree as giver of food . This tree that springs up below the horizon on the eastward side of the earth may be meant by the bus h of the Australian blacks who, on being asked by a missiona ry where the soul went when it left the body, said it went “behind the bus h,” the same bus h that was signi fied in the custom of the Hottentots. Behind the bus h was equi valent to our “beyond the veil.” The typi cal two trees in the enclosure are bot h Egypt ian, and bot h are represented in Amenta. The tree of earth is Hathor’s, called the sycamore of the sout h. The tree of heaven is the sycamore of Nut, who pours the water from it for the revivification of the manes. Water, as the supr eme element of life, retains its primacy of place in the Amenta in relation to the two waters of earth and heaven and the two godde sses Hathor and Nut. The sycamore of Hathor had been the discove rer of water with its deep root age in the desert sand. The sycamore of Nut droppe d dow n the liqui d of life in dew and rain as water of heaven. These two are bot h represented by two lakes or pool s of water welling in the garden of Amenta from the fount of sour ce itself in the abys s. The tree of life is imaged standi ng in a pool of the water of life in the midst of the Aarru - garden and the godde ss in the tree who gives the water also gives the fruit for food"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"and sustenance to the Osirified deceased. The tree is thus por trayed with its root s in the water of earth and its branches droppi ng dow n with the life - giving dew or 450 divine drink of heaven. In som e of the Egypt ian drawings the godde ss Nut is represented in the tree of know ledge , gathering baskets - full of figs from the sycamore - fig tree, and presenting them to the soul s of the departed. At other times she offers f ruit directly from the tree itself. Nut in the tree offering its fruit to the pair in the garden, who are Ani (male) and Tutu his wife, in the papyr us of Ani (plate 16) , are the nearest likeness to the wom an tempting Adam to eat the fruit of the tree; and Nut is the godde ss feeding soul s with the fruit of the tree of life here figur ed as the sycamore - fig tree. No name of species is given to the tree of know ledge in the book of Genesis, but we assum e it was the fig - tree that furnished the leaves from which t he loin - girdles of the primal pair were made. And the fig - tree as now traced was the sycamore - fig of Egypt . This was the tree of Hathor in the Aarru - paradise. Moreove r, the godde ss Ius ā as, the cons ort of Atum - Ra and mother of the com ing son, Iusa, or Iu - em - hetep, was a form of the cow - headed or cow - eared Hathor , lady of the sycamore - tree in the temple of the sun at Annu . Doubt less one cause of the curse pronounc ed upon the tree was on account of its being the tree of Hathor, the godde ss of fecundi ty. No be tter or more beautiful description of Hathor in the tree coul d be found than the one in the “Wisdom of Jesus.” This Jesus, as Iu the son of Atum , was brought forth by Hathor - Ius ā as from the tree. As Wisdom , she identifies herself with the tree of kno wledge . The pæ an of her exul tation might be called the hym n of Hathor . Hathor was the Egypt ian godde ss of love , though the love first persona ted by her was not the sexua l passion. It was the love of the mother for her offspring; the love of the mother of life who fed the child in the wom b and at the breast as the divine wet - nur se. In her pre - anthropo morphi c form she is the mother imaged as the milch - cow (this being preceded by the wate r - cow ) and therefore not a type of sexua l hum an love . As the wet - nur se she was also depicted in the tree of life and the tree of dawn, which droppe d the dew as very drink of life. Hathor is the habitation (from hat, the abode ), one primitive form of which was the tree, and hence the tree of dawn was a typi cal abode of the young god bor n of her, or from her sycamore as the branch of endl ess years. “I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypr ess - tree upon the mount ains of Hermon. I was exalted like a palm - tree in En - gaddi , and as a rose - plant in Jericho, as a fair olive - tree in a pleasant field, and grew up as a plane - tree by the water. As the vine brought I forth pleasant savour , and my flow ers are the fruit of honou r and riches. I am the mother of f air love , and fear, and know ledge , and hol y hope ; I therefore, being eternal, am given to all my children which are named of him. Com e unt o me, all ye that be desirous of me, and fill your selves with my fruits. For my memorial is sweeter than hone y, and mi ne inhe ritance than the hone ycomb. They that eat me shall yet be hungr y, and they that drink me shall yet be thirsty.” (The Wisdom of Jesus, ch. 24, 13 - 21, translated in the time of Euergetes.) The wom an who offers the fruit of the tree of know ledge in thi s book of the secret doc trine is in one form the godde ss Hathor , and if the Hebrew version of the tree of know ledge had been true, this woul d be the song of the siren tempting her love rs to perdition. "},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"451 The tree of know ledge being the sycamore - fig tre e of Hathor the godde ss of love , we see in that fact the raison - d’être of its being degraded by the Semitic bigot s and turned into the tree of temptation and the cause of the fabled fall. Very prope r phys iologi cal know ledge was also taught by means of the fable, but the primary motive for the perversion of the tree was the religious hatred of the motherhood by thos e who exalted the fatherhood as uni que and alone . Precisely the same spirit is show n in the cursing of the fig - tree, which is the sycamore - fig, i n the Gospels. “If ye had faith as a grain of mustard - seed, ye woul d say unt o this sycamore tree, Be thou root ed up, and be thou planted in the sea” (Luke XVII. 6). Cursing and casting out the sycamore - fig was damning the tree of the wom an, the emerald syc amore of the love ly Hathor, and also the sycamore of Nut, whether in the Old Testament or the New. And this was a mode of destroyi ng “the works of the female” (Gospel of the Egypt ians). The tree of the uppe r paradise was held to have been thor nless. As it is said in the Persian Revelation, on the nature of plants and trees, “before the com ing of the destroye r, vegetation had no thorn or bark about it. And afterwards when the destroye r came, it was coated with bark and grew thorny” ( Bundahi sh, ch. 27, West) . Thus the tree in the celestial paradise was differentiated from the tree in the earthly paradise, which became thor ny as the result of Adam’s fatal fall. Egypt is not a cloudy land, though there is sufficient morning - mist, how ever thin and filamental, fo r the golden rays of the sun to blend with the azure tints of uppe r heaven and produc e a greenish colour from the mixture of the two. This was represented as the great green sycamore of dawn, of Hathor or Nut, which in Egypt was a tree of life that struck its root s dow n to the eternal springs and woul d find moisture even in a Sahara of desert sand. And from this tree of heaven the earth was watered with refreshing dew. This imagery of Egypt is virtually repeated in the book of Genesis (II. 5, 6) when the wr iter tells us that “Iahu - Elohi m had not caused it to rain upon the earth, but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whol e face of the ground. ” The sycamore of dawn is mentione d in the Ritual. It is also spoke n of as the sycamore in the easter n sky ( Pyram id Texts, Pepi, I, 174 ). Few things in literature are more love ly than the way in which the imagery of dawn was thus utilized as the road to travel by in attaining the other uppe r land of life. So far as the Babyl oni ans and Assyrian versions of the mythos have been recove red we find no written account of the creation of man or the placing of the man in the Garden of Eden “to dress it and to keep it.” But the garden is represented on one of the cylinde rs in what has been termed the scene of the t emptation by thos e who read the subj ect backw ards according to the Hebrew story of the fall. The tree in Eridu is called the shrine of the two, whom we unde rstand to be the primeval mother and her son, who as Egypt ian was called the bul l of the mother. The pair are also described as “the lady of the eternal tree” and the great supr eme bull, he who was bot h the child and cons ort of the mother. These two, we now sugge st, are the male and female pair who are seated unde rneath the tree as the scene is pictured on the Assyrian cylinde r. The bul l of the mother is obvi ous ly represented by the pair of horns upon the figur e of the male. A tree with seven branches is portrayed with 452 "},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"the pair of male and female figur es seated unde rneath, and the serpent erect at t he back of the female, as if pos ed and holding forth in the character of the legenda ry tempter. The reptile corresponds to the flat - headed Apap of the Egypt ian drawings , which signi fies evil because it is the serpent of darkne ss, drought , dearth, and negat ion. One cannot resist the impression that this representation may be respons ible for the legend of the serpent, the temptation and the fall that is found in the Hebrew book of Genesis. Assyrian Cylinder. The Babyl oni ans were such perverters of the Ka mite mythol ogy in relation to wom an and the serpent. But instead of a human pair, the male and female seated unde r the tree are two divinities. The figur e next the serpent is a form of the Great Mother. Thence we infer that the male is a form of the son, a nd that the pair are the well - know n dua d of mother and son, as in Ishtar and Dum uzi or Zikum and Tammuz, the genetrix with the son who became his ow n father, as did Sebek - Horus, the son who was the hus band of his mother. Also, on the third tablet of the cr eation series there is a Babyl oni an prototype for the Hebrew legend of the fall that follow ed on the eating of forbidde n fruit. In this it is said that “the com mand was established in the garden of the god .” But, “in sin one with the other in com pact joine d.” “The asnan fruit they ate, they broke in two; its stalk they destroye d. Great is their sin. Themselves they exalted. To Meroda ch, their redeemer, he (the god Sar) appoi nted their fate” (Boscawen). The doc trine of a fall and of a redemption therefrom is plainly appa rent in this inscription which the Hebrew com pilers appa rently follow ed and in that way the later theologi cal legend woul d get intermixed with the original mythos in a Semitic moralizing of the Kamite mythol ogy . Various vigne ttes to the Ritua l show us Ani and his wife, the pair, as spirits, in the Aarru - garden eating the fruit of the tree and drinki ng the water of life, but with no relation to a fall from paradise through plucking the forbidde n fruit. The pair of beings in the Semitic versions are suppos ed to have fallen from the garden of the beginni ng through eating the forbidde n fruit of the asnan tree. And according to the rende ring of the myth in Hebrew, the pair are driven forth lest they shoul d also eat of the tree of life. “And Iahu - Elo him said, Behol d, Adam is becom e as one of us, to know good and evil: and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live for ever: therefore Iahu - Elohi m sent him forth from the garden. So he drove out Adam.” As there is no mention of the wom an in this expul sion, the man must have gone alone upon his “solitary way,” unl ess the wom an is include d in Adam - hom o as in the first creation. “So he drove out Adam, and he placed at the "},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"453 east of the Garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life” (Gen. III. 22 - 24) . The tree of life, we repeat, was the tree of dawn with its root age in the garden of Amenta. In the Hebrew Genesis, the tree is to be protected by the f lame of a sword that turns in all directions , which conve ys the idea of a swordsman dexterous ly making the moul inet figur e of defence. Now let us turn to the great original sym bol ism which has been so mutilated. The tree of life, the emerald sycamore of da wn, stood with its roots below the hor izon in the garden eastward. It needed protection by night from the insidious assaults of the Apap of darkne ss, drought , and dearth, as show n in the illustrations to the Book of the Dead. The precious water and tree of life were protected within the enclosure formed by Ptah that was raised against the incursions of Apap, the eternal devour er. The prohi bition against eating the fruit of the tree woul d have had no meaning for Ani and his wife. They were there to eat of i t and live as spirits. For that pur pos e the water and fruit are being given to them by Nut or Hathor in the vigne ttes. The protector of the tree of life by night is Atum - Ra, the solar god, whos e weapon is the flaming orb of the noc turnal sun (Rit., ch. 15) . The sword that turned in every direction is depicted in the radiating disk which is set all round as it were with sword - blades of the solar flame. “Salutation to Ra radiating in his disk as the light that issues out of the hor izon, ” is a greeting made by the worshippe r (Rit., ch. 148 ). In the pictures to the Ritual the sun is imaged by a radiating disk that rises up from the tree of life, the emerald sycamore - fig or the fig - tree of the garden eastward, and this is described as being a symbol ical represent ation of Atum - Ra. The radiating life - giving disk is a sworded flame which turns every way, seeing that it is rayed and darting fire all round. The way of the tree of life is tow ards the eastern hor izon where the sun goe s out of the garden eastward, and the sworded disk is not onl y in the way of the tree of life, it also rises out of the tree, and is described as turning round when it rises. The “flame of a sword which turns every way” is no doubt an adaptation of the radiating disk which is here portrayed a t the sum mit of the tree of life. Ra “circulating in his disk” (15, 32 - 3), who “radiates in his disk: who fashions himself in his metal and turns round so soon as Shu upr aises him on the hor izon” (Rit., 17, 50) . In one passage it is said that the flame of the solar disk emblematically designe d saves the god Ra from Apap (Rit., ch. 149, 12, Pierret), which is the prototypa l equi valent of the sworded flame that revol ves to keep the way of the tree of life in the book of Genesis. The way of the tree of life th at goe s out of Eden can be identified with the way that goe s out of the field of Aarru in Amenta. The speaker in the Ritual had travelled that way, as one of the manes, but NOT AS A MORTAL . He says (149, 5 - 9), “I know the way of the field Aarru by which At um - Ra goe s forth to the east of heaven” (or from the garden eastward). The “way of the tree of life” in Genesis is the “road of the disk” in the Ritual (ch. 129 , 1). We learn from Origen that there was a certain diagram current amongs t the gnos tic Ophi tes, which cont ained the seven ruling dæ mons . Amongs t the other matters 454 "},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"mentione d is the flaming sword that kept the tree of life at the gates of paradise. Of this he says the picture in the accursed diagram was impious ly unl ike the figur e drawn in “Sacr ed Writ”. “The flaming sword was depicted as the diameter of a flaming circle, and as if mount ing gua rd ove r the tree of know ledge and of life” (B. 6, ch. 33) . From this description of the figur e we perceive that the gnos tic diagram cont ained a copy of the Egypt ian original. The Flaming Sword which Guarded the Tree. As first poi nted out in the Book of the Beginni ngs (1881) , the word cherub, or kerub, is Egypt ian. It signi fies a primary figur e, a mode l form. The type may vary, but the word denot es prima cy whatsoever the figure. The variant khe rp means the first, chief, principal, forepart or foremost. Still more to the purpos e the Kamite khe refu= khe rebu are a pair of lion - gods joined back to back that keep the gates of dawn, or we might say, the way of t he tree of life, which is the green sycamore of dawn. The Egypt ian khe refu lift up the solar orb upon their backs; they form the primary figure of suppor t for the god that preceded the ark or chariot, which cons isted of an ark that rested on the boa t. The twin lions or khe refu form the natural throne or seat of the solar deity “Atum - Iu” (Vig. to ch. 18, Rit.; Pap. Ani., pl. 7). According to Josephus ( Ant. I, II, 6, 5), Moses had seen such things as the cherubs near the throne of Iahu; and here we find the khe refu, in the form of twin lions , are the throne of Atum in the Easter equi nox when it coincided with the Lion sign. These things are not merely matters of phi lology. The kherub as a determinative type passes into the griffin. A pair of griffins still ke ep the gate or gateway of the avenue of trees that leads up to the great hous e. Also the crab and the scarab still represent the khe rub bot h by name and type . In som e of the ancient Egypt ian zodiacs the scarabæ us takes the place of the crab. In others the sign is represented by a pair of scarabs or beetles; and two scarabs are also equi valent to the two cherubs . Thus when the equi nox had passed into the sign of Cancer the two khe refu or khe rubs as lions were succeeded in the astronom ical mythos by the two s carabs that now kept the way of the tree of life at the poi nt in precession"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"where the vernal equi nox was statione d for the time being — namely, in the sign of the Crab or the beetles. The mother of beginni ngs , the primordial parent in the abys s of earth and the height of heaven, was also reproduc ed as the Great Mother in Amenta. In the vigne ttes to the Ritual Apt is por trayed in bot h forms of the cow , the hippopot amus and the milch - cow , among the papyr us plants of the morass at the foot of the mount of Ament a, as the bringe r to rebirth for the uppe r paradise (Papyr us of Ani, pl. 37) . The mother of life on earth was now made protector of the dead in Amenta, and she who was the kindl er of the stellar sparks in 455 heaven by night became the re - kindl er of the sparks of life from the eclipse of death (Rit., ch. 137, B; Papyr us of Ani, Pap. Nebseni). Thus we can identify Eve, or Chavva h, as Kefa or Kep, the Great Mother, with Adam or Atum in the garden of Amenta. The name of Eve in Hebrew ( hvx ), Chavva h, signi fie s life or living, whence Eve is the mother of life. Life, how ever, is a som ewhat abstract term. Still the mother of life, as Egypt ian, was Khep, Kep, or Kefa=Chavva h by name. Kep signi fies the ferment of life, the mystery of fertilisation, the enceinte mot her; the Khep, Khev, or Kefa, as Egypt ian, we hol d to be the original of the Hebrew Chavva h. Kefa appe ars along with the great scarab in the thirteenth dom ain of Amenta (Renouf , Book of the Dead, ch. 149, pl. 52) . Moreove r, the lione ss Kefa, or Kheft, is a form of Sekhe t the solar godde ss, who was the belove d cons ort of Ptah and the mother of Atum - Ra. According to the Jewish legends Adam had two wives, one named Lilith, the other Chavva h, or in the Engl ish version, Eve. Atum also had two wives. These at An nu are Neb - hetep and Ius ā as, the mother of the prince of peace, in her two characters of “lady of peace” and she who is great with Iu the com ing son (or su), who was the prince of peace as conque ror of the serpent and all the evil pow ers in earth, in heave n, and in Amenta; otherwise in drough t, in darkne ss, and in death. We can identify the wife of Adam with the old first genetrix of gods and men and mother of beginni ngs in at least three of her mythical characters. In one she was imaged as Rerit the sow . I n anot her she is Kefa, or Kheft, the lione ss. Lastly, she was por trayed as the mother of life in hum an form, the prototype of Eve. Now , as the mother of Atum was the lione ss Sekhe t, as the mother of “the princes of Israel” was a lione ss (Ez. XIX. 2) who no urished young lions for her whelps, the inference is that Eve or Chavva h represents the lione ss Kefa. In Rabbi nical tradition Lilith is know n as Adam’s first wife, but only Chavva h has been brought on as Eve in the garden of the beginni ng. The Great Mother was singl e in herself, but may be dua l or several in type . She remained singl e in the fields of heaven, the uppe r Aarru, where the Great Bear was her cons tellation, but she might be represented as Rerit the sow , or Kep the hippopot amus, or Kefa the liones s, according to phe nom ena. Father Atum is conne cted with the sow . He also has two wives. One of these, Ius ā as, is a form of the godde ss Hathor , and in one character Hathor was Shaat the sow . The sow was sacred in Israel because it had been a zoot ype of the multimammalian Great Mother in Egyp t. According to the totemic law of tabu, the eating of the sow as ordinary diet was prohi bited because it was sacred to the periodi c celebration which passed into the Eucharistic meal, at which it was religious ly eaten o nce a year. For a long time the Jews"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"remained faithful to the Great Mother in their sacramental eating of swine’s flesh among the graves (Isaiah LXV. 4, and LXVI. 17). The graves identify the mortuary meal, and the swine’s flesh will answer for the mother, who was imaged in one form as the many - teated sow , the flesh of which was prohi bited in later ages because it was sacred and had originally represented the mother, who was at one time eaten with honou r in propr ia persona. This also tends to identify Eve, or Chavvah, with Kep or Kefa, the first mother in the 456 Egypt ian astronom ical mythol ogy. The story of Lilith, Adam’s first wife, has been om itted from the book of Genesis. There are two wives invol ved, how ever, in the two different creations , although no name is given to the first. Man, as hom o, was created “male and female” by the Elohi m (I. 27) . The Rabbi nical tradition relates that the wom an was created out of the ground toge ther with the man, and was named Lilith. She obvi ous ly represented the first Great Mother, one of whos e Egypt ian names was Rerit=Lilith, and whos e zoot ype was the sow as well as the hippopot amus. The subm erged gnos is respecting the priority of the matriarchate com es to the surface in the story of the cont ention betwixt Lilith and Adam for marital supr emacy. The two wives of Adam answer to the two cons orts of Atum , who were Neb - hetep, the lady of peace, and Ius ā as, she who was great with Iu - em - hetep, the bringe r of peace, the Kamite Jesus, as Iu - sa the com ing son. In the Hebrew leg end it is the wom an Eve who offers the fruit of the tree of know ledge . In other versions , especially the Greek, the fruit is offered to the man by a serpent in the tree. Now the serpent was anot her type of the Great Mother, Kep, who was earlier than the se rpent - wom an, Rannut ; and whether por trayed in the shape of a serpent or in the hum an form, she was the primordial giver of fruit from the tree. The serpent, the crocodi le or dragon, the hippopot amus, the sow , the cow , the lione ss and wom an all meet as one in Kep, the earliest mother of life. The primal mother in the Kamite representation was the bringe r - forth of Sut and Horus as her first two children, who were bor n twins. These, as the pow ers of darkne ss and light , or drought and fertility, were a pair of com batants who fought for the supr emacy unt il one brother slew the other. This is one of thos e primary legends that became uni versal, but not because it had a hund red different origins at different times. Sut and Horus were inde finitely earlier than the so lar Atum . But in the cult of Atum - Ra at On or Annu they were fathered on him and cont inue d as his sons . Sut and Horus offer an instructive instance of evol ution in mythol ogy . They were bor n sons of the first Great Mother as two of the primordial pow ers, th e twin pow ers of darkne ss and light . But in the re - cast of their theology the priests of Annu brought them on as the warring sons of Atum - Ra, who fought each other “up and dow n the garden” unt il, as here related, one of them was slain. In various inscripti ons Sut and Horus are called the sons of Atum (Renouf , Hib. Lectures, p. 84) . Otherwise stated, they became two of the associate - gods , the cons tituent parts and pow ers of Atum, as the sons of Ptah and members of the Put com pany of the Ali. The battle in A menta was not only fough t betwixt the Apap of darkne ss and the sun - god Ra. When the two brothers Sut and Horus were repeated in the solar mythos , as the sons of Atum , the conf lict was cont inue d for pos session of the garden."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"This was now the motive of the w arfare. Previous ly it was for the water of the inunda tion or light in the moon. Now it was for the water and the tree of life in the Aarru - garden. In one version of the mythos , Sut is the murderer of the good brother as Osiris. In the other, Sut pierces an d put s out the eye of Horus. This is represented as the cont est between Cain and Abel, the two sons of Adam, in the book of Genesis. Sut 457 and Horus represented two cont endi ng nature - pow ers. They fought each other as the two rehus or lions in the light and dark halves of the moon, with Taht as the adjudi cator of the landm arks. They also fought as two dragons , or as the crocodi le of water and the dragon of drought , bot h of which were right ly represented in the astronom ical mythol ogy. “Hydr a” remains for all time as the “hellish Apap” who drank up the water. And “Draconi s” is a figur e of the good dragon or Horus - crocodi le. Lastly, the two oppone nt pow ers were por trayed as twin - brothers, fighting for the birth - right , or seeking to ove rcom e each other. Thus they cont ende d for pos session of the garden in Amenta, where they fought upon the mount of glory or were cons tellated as the Gemini cont endi ng in the zodi ac. The conf lict of the brothers was cont inue d in the Garden of Eden, and Cain fulfils the character o f the murderer Sut, the slayer of his brother. There is an attempt even to discriminate betwixt the two domains of Sut and Horus, when it is said that “Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground” (Gen. IV. 2, 3). The Aarru - garden, or paradise, planted in Amenta by Ptah for Atum his son, was founde d on food and liqui d, that is on the water, and the tree, or plant, as food of life. These, in the Hebrew version, are called “the trees in the midst of the garden,” and “the river that went o ut of Eden to water the garden.” They represent the mythical tree and the water of life, which had their beginni ng in actual food and drink, and were afterwards repeated, on earth, in heaven, and in the making of Amenta. The well or water - spring that was t he sour ce of life to primitive man was here cont inue d as a basis for the re - beginni ng of life in the earth of eternity. In the Ritual the manes, or Osiris N., says, “I am he whos e stream is secret.” This was the hidden sour ce of water in the earth itself t hat was repeated as divine sour ce in Amenta. In som e of the vigne ttes to the Ritual Osiris, god of Amenta, is por trayed upon his throne within a shrine that rests upon the water welling from the unde rworld. One of his titles was the water of renewal. So su preme an element of life was water, by the aid of which the Aarru - paradise was made. “I know the names of the streams within the garden,” exclaims the manes; “I utter my praise to the gods who are in the garden” (Rit., ch. 110) . The water issues now from u nde rneath the throne of Osiris. But in the earlier cult the sour ce of life as water was the secret of the great god Ptah. In a hym n on the walls of the temple at El - Khargeh, Ptah is saluted as the lord of all, from the very beginni ng. It is said, “Thou has t made the doubl e earth.” “Thou hast placed thy throne in the life of the doubl e earth.” It is also said of this one god, “Thy secret is in the depths (or the deep) of the secret waters and unknow n” (Renouf , Hibbe rt Lectures, p. 231) . This secret rests in the beginni ng with water. The sour ce of water was the well within the earth, the wellspring of life in the Neter - Kar, the secret water emanating from the Nun, as if it broke up through the solid earth. It was the secret gua rded by the Sphi nx, by the seven spirits of the earth, the seven Anunna ki seated on their golden throne s. It was the water of the Tuat in the Ritual called “the deep which"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"no one can fathom ” (Rit., ch. 172 ). This is the beginni ng of life with water and vegetation now repeated at the point of a new departure in the making of Amenta by 458 Ptah the planter of the Aarru - garden. The four waters into which heaven was divided are por trayed in the Sekhe t - hetep or fields of peace. Cool water, eatable plants, and refreshing breezes cons tituted th e Egyptian heaven as it had been from the first time in Inne r Africa. And according to the pictures, paradise in Amenta is mappe d out in four divisions of land amidst the cool ing waters of the Aarru meadow s or Elysian Fields, the Semitic Garden of Eden. Th e sign of heaven or the sky is to be seen above a vertical table which is divided into four parts. The garden is intersected by the four waters of the book of Genesis. The great water is the celestial Nile, called the father of the gods , the giver of plent y. The other three are designa ted the pow er of the water, innum erable waters, and great place of the water (Rit., ch. 110, and vigne ttes). But the paradise depicted in the vigne ttes to the Ritual is sub - terrestrial, not celestial or circum polar; it is the earthly paradise. This is the garden of the low er Aarru, not the garden on the sum mit of the stellar mount of glory. In that, the one water was divided into the two lakes with the river runni ng dow n from the nor th to the sout h. The terrestrial paradise in Amenta is based upon the four qua rters of the sky that was suspende d by Ptah, and the four qua rters are equi valent to the four waters or rivers in the vigne ttes to the Ritual. The four rivers of Eden belong to this later heaven that was divided into four parts and are a co - type with the four qua rters. Hence they are por trayed as issuing from the four sides of the mythical mount in pictures of the garden. In a Buddhi st legend, cited by Hardy, a tree takes the place of the mount and four great rivers flow un ceasingl y from the four boughs of this tree of immensity. The river names, in the biblical version, belong to a later geography, which has to be allow ed for; they are a mixture of Egypt ian and Assyrian. “A river went out of Eden to water the garden, and fr om thence it was parted and became four heads.” The first is Pishon, the second is Gihon, the third is Hidde kel, the fourth is Euphr ates. Of the water or fount ain - head Pishon it is said, “That is it which com passeth the whol e land of Havilah, where there i s gol d, and the gol d of that land is good ; there (also) is bde llium and the onyx stone ” (Genesis II. 11, 12). This land of the good gol d corresponds to the Egypt ian Puanta or Ta - Neter the divine land which is called “the gol den” in the Ritual (ch. 15) . But this land of gol d was the land of the solar glory. Adorations are offered to Atum as he rises out of “the gol den” or com es up from Puanta to illum ine the earth. Atum was the god in spirit, the one god in spirit and in truth; and Atum or Adam in the garde n was the man in spirit striving as manes for assimilation to the god. The man of earth as the first Adam passes into the Amenta to becom e the second Adam in the garden as the heir of life eternal. Atum in Amenta represents generic man and indi vidua l manes . He is the god - man, bot h hum an and divine, the man in matter and the man in spirit. The French Egypt ologist, M. Lefébure, who has lately identified Adam with the Egypt ian Atum , as the present writer had done seven years earlier in A Book of the Beginni ngs , refers to a scene on the coffin of Penpi i in the Louvr e, which is similar to the history of Adam in the sub - terres - "},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"459 trial paradise, where a naked and ithypha llic personage called “the lord of food” (Neb - tefa) is standi ng before a serpent with two l egs and two arms, and the reptile is offering him a red fruit, or at least a little round obj ect painted red. The same scene is again found on the tom b of Rameses VI. And on a statue relatively recent in the museum at Turin it is to Atum =Adam that the serp ent, as tempter, is offering the round obj ect, or fruit of the tree. The same writer says, “The tree of life and know ledge was well know n in Egypt .” And “whether the scene of Neb - tefa can be identified with the history of Adam or not , we can see that the g reater num ber of the peculiar features of this history existed in Egypt — the tree of life and know ledge , the serpent in paradise, Eve thinking of appr opr iating divinity to herself, and in shor t Adam himself, are all there” ( Trans . S. Bib. Arch., vol . IX, pt . I, p. 180) . The entrance to the hidde n earth was in the western region, founde d on the pathw ay of the sun. The garden of Aarru was the land of prom ise, peace, and plenty on the eastward side of the Amenta. The manes carries the title - deeds of his allotm ent with him. In later copi es of the Book of the Dead som e lines were adde d to ch. 109: “There are writings in thy pos session for the grant of fields, of cornland in which there springe th corn from the effluxe s or sap of Osiris.” “Enter bol dly at the myste rious por tals, and be pur ified by thos e who are there.” The prom ise is that when the pur ified deceased com es forth to the Sekhe t - Aarru wheat and barley shall be given to him there, and he will sow and reap it with the glorified (Rit., rubr ic to ch. 72). In anot her chapter, when the speaker has arrived, he exclaims, “I am the great ow ner in the garden of Aarru. O this garden of Aarru, the walls of which are of steel (or ba - metal).” “I know the inne r gate of the garden of Aarru, out of which com eth Ra, in the east of the sky. ” “I know thos e two sycamores of emerald, between which he com eth forth as he adva nceth to the eastern gates of the sky, through which he proceedeth” (ch. 149 ). This is the garden to the eastward of Amenta, or of Eden in Genesis. The speak er also describes it as the garden which is a field of divine harvest. “I know this garden of Ra (Atum ): the height of its wheat is seven cubi ts, the ears are two cubi ts, the stalks five cubi ts, the barley is seven cubi ts. It is the glorified one s, each of whom is nine cubi ts in height, who reap there in presence of the pow ers of the east” (ch. 149 ). Whether imaged as the garden or the harvest - field, this was the earthly paradise, the land of prom ise and of plenty, and Atum in the harvest - field or Aarru - gar den represented not the man of earth, but the manes of Amenta, the man who died and was bur ied and who rose again in spirit to cultivate his plot of ground for edible plants, or the wheat that grew seven cubi ts high in this the earth of eternity. The manes makes his way tow ards thos e who have becom e the lords of eternity living for ever, the spirits made perfect, or the gods and the glorified. And it is proba ble that when he says, “Let me go up to the Sekhe t - Aarru and arrive in Sekhe t - hetep” (ch. 72) , there is a reference to the ascent from the low er to the uppe r paradise by way of the mount , the tree, or ladde r of Ra which reaches to the sky — that is, from the garden of the vine in Amenta to the field of rest in heaven. Hence the need of the ship. 460 "},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"The ship of Nu is thus addr essed by the manes in chapter 106: “O thou ship of the garden of Aarru, let me be conve yed to that bread of thy canal like my father, the great one , who adva nceth in the divine ship, because I know thee,” as was show n from the examin ation of the initiate in chapter 99. The garden was divided into four teen portions called dom ains, a num ber which indi cates a founda tion in one half of the lunar circle. The first of these is entered by the manes in the character of Atum =Adam. He enters w ith the crow n of Atum on his head. He says, “Doff your headdr ess in my presence. I am the great one ; I am the lord among the gods .” “Horus has crow ned me with ‘the diadem of Atum .’” The garden of Aarru itself is the second of the fourteen dom ains in Amenta . The manes in the character of Atum =Adam enters the second dom ain as the owner of it, saying, “I am the great propr ietor in the garden of Aarru.” This he goe s on to describe. It is on the hor izon of the east= the gar den eastward. The god who is in the gard en with the manes is Har - Makhu, that is Atum . And as Atum is the Kamite original of the Hebrew Adam so the garden of Atum is the Gan - Eden of Adam (ch. 149 and vigne tte). The third is the dom ain of “the glorious one s,” the seven great com panion - spirits who assisted Ptah as his craftsmen in the making of Amenta. In this, the third dom ain, the manes assum es the divinity of Atum himself, saying, “I am the lord of the red crow n which is on the head of the shining one , he who gives life to mank ind with the breath of his mout h.” It was Atum who gave life to manki nd or the manes with the breath of his mouth. This is repeated (Gen. II. 7) when Iahu - Elohi m breathed into his nos trils the breath of life, and man became a living soul . In the four th dom ain there is a grea t and lofty moun tain of the nether world, the moun tain of Amenta, three hund red measures in lengt h and ten in width, the highe st poi nt of which ends with the sky. There is a serpent coiling on it seventy cubi ts in its windi ngs . “He with sharp kni ves is his name,” or, in a word, it is the “piercing” serpent. “He lives by slaught ering the glorious one s and the damned in the nether world.” This is the Apap - reptile who may be seen in a vigne tte to the Ritual facing Sebek on the mount (ch. 108) . The manes addr es ses the mons ter in the four th domain, saying, “I see the way tow ards thee. I gather myself toge ther. I am the man who put a veil upon thy head, without being injured. I am the great magician. Thine eyes have been given to me, and through them I am glorifie d. Who is he that goe th on his belly? Thy strengt h is on thy mount ain; behol d, I march tow ard it (the mount ain), and thy strengt h is in my hand. I am he who takes pos session of thy strengt h. I go round the sky; thou art in thy valley, as was ordered to the e before.” He has deprived the serpent of his magical pow er and cast him dow n in the dus t, or into the valley. No soone r was Amenta made and the tree of life, which represented vegetation, planted in the water of life than the Apap - reptile, the serpent of darkne ss or the dragon of drought , broke into the enclosure. As the representative of drought , its fangs were fastened on the tree of food , of dew, of life. As the representative of darkne ss it warred against the light of Atum, Horus, Ra, and Taht. And, a s the 461 Ritual has it (ch. 17) , “There was conf lict now in the entire uni verse,” in heaven, upon earth, and in Amenta, inclusive of the garden. In the great battle betwixt Ra and Apap, described in chapter 39 of the Ritual, Atum as Horus the son fight s for the father Ra."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"When the victory is won Atum says, “Lift up you r count enance, ye soldiers of Ra!” The same part is taken by Atum in the garden of Aarru when he delivers Ra from Apap in the third dom ain. There is a scene in the vigne tte to ch. 17 (Pap. of Ani, plate 10) , in which Atum Ra appe ars as god the father and Atum - Horus as god the son. The yout hful solar god is imaged in the form of a cat, the seer in the dark, and is grappl ing with the serpent and cutting off or bruising its head. Ra the father is intently gazing at his son whilst the battle is raging. The group of gods looki ng on are watching the struggl e betwixt the great cat and the serpent Apap. Horus bruising the Serpent’s Head. The god in conf lict with the serpent is Iu the son of Atum , otherwise Atum in the person of the son. And here we have delved dow n to a tap - root of the Jesus legend. Iu - em - hetep in the cult of Atum - Ra is the com ing son, the ever - com ing su or son of the eternal; and Iu the su= Iusu, or Iusa the son of Ius ā as, is the original of Iusu or Jesus. In one pha se the battle was fought night ly betwixt Iu the son of Atum, or, in the Osirian version, betwixt Horus the son of Asar and the loathly reptile. In another pha se of the mythos the great battle was fought annu ally between the saviour - son and the serpent in the garden of Aarru hard by the tree of life, as described and por trayed in the Ritual (ch. 17, 20 - 22) . This war betwixt the serpent and the son who came to save went on for ever, every night , every year, and every other period of time; hence the bruiser of the serpent’s head was the saviour who for ever came as the lord of light , the giver of life, protector of the tree of life at its root age in Amenta. There is anot her personi fication of the wom an who wars against the serpent as Sekhe t, otherwise Pasht. This godde ss is som etimes depicted standi ng at the prow of the boa t in the act of spearing the serpent as he raises his head and tries to hypnot ise the passenge rs with his evil eyes (ch. 108, LL, 3, 4). It is Sekhe t who is mistress of the water in which the Apap lurks by night (ch. 57, L, 1), because she was a luna r godde ss, the seer by night , who was also imaged as the cat that killed the serpent or the rat abom inated by the sun. Thus there are two versions , luna r and solar. In one the wom an or godde ss is the slayer of the serpent, in the other it is the son of the wom an that bruises the reptile’s head. The Rom ish Chur ch has perpetuated the former; the latter survives in the Protestant world, and, as here show n, bot h are Egypt ian. Moreove r, Sekhe t the cat - headed cons ort of Ptah was the mother of Atum - Ra. When we have identified the son in this disgui se of a great cat killing a serpent as defende r of his father,"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"we may perhaps expe rience less surprise on learnin g that the cat was also cont inue d in the Christian Chur ch as a 462 living type of the “historical Christ.” At Aix, in Prove nce, the great cat was a representative of the newly - bor n Jesus. On the solemn festival of Corpus Christi the finest tom cat to be found in the canton was exhi bited in this character. It was wrapt up like a child in swaddl ing - clothes and made a show of in a gor geous shrine. Every kne e was bow ed in ador ation to this effigy, who was Iu in Egypt , and Iahu, cat and all, in Christendom . (H ampson, Medii Ævi Kalendar ium ; Mill, History of the Crusade s. ) In the pre - Osirian mysteries of Amenta Atum the father was re - bor n as his ow n son Iu, the bringe r of peace and plenty and good luck, as manifestor for the eternal in time. The birth was period ic because the phe nomena were first recurrent in external nature — in the renewal of the light , the return of the waters, the rebirth of vegetation. Hence the Messiah was know n as “the king of one year.” The son, as Horus, son of Isis, or Iu the su (son) of Atum , was incorpor ated or incarnated in matter as a spirit from heaven to becom e the second Atum , Iu - em - hetep, the ever - com ing son, whom we identify as the original Iu - su, the Egyp tian Jesus. His mission is sufficiently set forth in the texts and pictures of the Ritual, more expr essly as the oppone nt and the conque ror of Apap, the evil serpent. The fight is several times allude d to in which Horus, or the deceased who impersona tes him, defends the enclosure against the Apap - serpent. “He makes his way. He rep ulses the attack of Apap. He crosses the enclosure and repul ses Apap” (Rit., 144, 20) . “He put s an end to the rage of Apap and protecteth Ra against him daily” (ch. 130) . Again, he says, “I have repul sed Apap, and healed the wounds he made” (ch. 136 , 3). R a is identical with Atum , but the character is dupl icative. In one Atum - Ra is the father - god , in the other Atum - Horus, or Iu, is the son; and as the son he is the protector and deliverer of his father when he stagge rs forth upon the horizon from his conf li ct with the serpent, bleeding with many wounds (Rit., ch. 39) . There is hardly any more precious doc um ent on the face of the earth at the present mom ent than the Papyr us of Ani (publ ished by the British Museum ). In this the happy garden is por trayed with the pair of soul s, once hum an, passing through the various scenes which are depicted in the Ritual. The soul , or manes, makes the journey through Amenta in the two halves of sex; “male and female created he them.” Thus Ani is accom panied in the pictures by his wife Tutu, who had died eight years before him, and who com es to meet him at the entrance to Amenta, to protect him on the way she travelled first, and to scare away all evil spirits with the shaking of her sistrum as she gui des him to the heaven of t he glorified elect. As gods , the divine pair in the garden of this late beginni ng, called Gan - Eden, were Atum and Ius ā as. As hum an, they may be any pair of manes, or translated mortals like Ani and his wife, to whom an allotment in the Sekhe t Aarru was given for them to cultivate. In the Hebrew version the divine pair have been hum anized in Adam and Eve, as beings on thi s earth, and thus the mystery of Amenta loses all the meaning, which has to be restored by reading the mythos once more in the original. The male and female pair are por trayed toge ther in the vigne ttes to chapters 15, 15a , 2; 15a , 3; 15a , 4; 15b , 1; 15b, 2 , all of which "},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"463 scenes belong to the earth of eternity. (Naville, Das Ægypt., Todt., pp. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. ) The primal pair of hum an beings , who are Adam and Eve in the Semitic version of the legend, had been represented in the Papyr i as Ani and his wife Tutu, the man and wom an that onc e were mortal on the earth, but have passed into the state of manes, who are on their way to or in the terrestrial paradise. They enter the Aarru - garden. They drink the water of life at its secret sour ce in the Tua t. They eat the fruit of the tree of life, which is offered to Ani, the man, by the divine wom an in the tree, who may be Nut or Hathor . If it be Hathor who offers the fruit of the tree, there is a pos sible link betwixt this scene and the story of Adam’s te mptation by the wom an in the book of Genesis. Hathor ’s was the tree of earth, Nut’s was the tree of heaven. The pair are pictured in the earthly paradise, and therefore in the place of Hathor’s tree, the sycamore - fig tree. Now Ius ā as, the wife of Atum =Adam and mother of Iu at Annu, was a form of Hathor. So that Hathor - Ius ā as offering the fruit of the sycamore - fig to Atum in the Sekhe t - Aarru is equi valent to Eve, who offers the fruit of the tree of know ledge to Adam in the Garden of Eden, which, as show n by the apron of fig - leaves, was a fig tree. When Ani and his spirit - cons ort, who had been his wife on earth, appe ar toge ther in the happy garden, they drink the water of life and eat the fruit of the tree, as spirits among spirits. They nestle in the green b ow er of Hathor the godde ss of love , and the pleasures of the earthly paradise are denot ed by their playing games of draught s toge ther in the garden. In one scene the pair are portrayed hard by the tree of life, bot h of them drinki ng the water of life that flow s from beneath the tree. In the next vigne tte the man is kne eling alone before the tree, which is a sycamore - fig tree. A wom an in the tree is offering som e of its fruit to Ani. This is the godd ess Nut, the lady of heaven, who presents the fruit of the tree to the man in the garden of the earthly paradise (Pap. of Ani, pl. 16) , and who has been conve rted into the wom an that tempted Adam to eat of the tree as the cause of the fallacious fall. The biblical rendering of this representation is a blasphe my ag ainst the Ritual, against wom anki nd, against nature, and against know ledge . The godde ss Nut, who offers the fruit of the tree of know ledge to the kne eling man, is in shape a wom an, and the meaning coul d be onl y too easily misread, as it has been in the leg end of the first wom an who tempted the first man to eat of the forbidde n fruit and to cause the loss of paradise. According to the Ritual the manes who receive food in the garden of Aarru (ch. 99, 32, 38) or who eat of the fruit of the sycamore - fig tree o f Hathor (ch. 52) are empow ered to make what transformation they please, and go out of it as spirits. They literally becom e spirits among spirits as a result of eating the fruit of the tree. The manes says, “Let me eat unde r the sycamore of Hathor ! Let me see the forms of my father and mother” (ch. 52) , as he woul d when the spirit sight was ope ned for him to perceive with the beatific vision. This is sufficient as a text for the serpent when it says, “Ye shall not surely die; for God doth know that in the d ay ye eat thereof, then 464 your eyes shall be ope ned and ye shall be as gods , know ing good and evil” (Gen. III. 4, 5). Instead of being damned eternally through eating the fruit of the tree, the manes in"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Amenta are divinized piecemeal as the result of e ating it (82, 2, 5). In the rubr ical directions at the end of chapter 99 we read, “This chapter being know n, the deceased appe ars in the field (or cultivated enclosure) of Aarru. He receives food there, the produc e of its fields. His members becom e like to thos e of the gods . He goe s forth pur e spirit.” (Lines 32 - 34.) Instead of referring to the fall of man from the terrestrial paradise, this relates to the ascent of soul s from a low er heaven won by hard labour in Amenta to an uppe r heaven attainable at last by spirits perfected. When the manes have literally done their diggi ng in cultivating the fields of Aarru, they ascend the moun t of re - birth in heaven to enter the ark or bark of soul s, and sail or row themselves to the Hesperian isles. It follow s that t he hiding of the guilty pair in the garden is derived from the manes being ove rshadow ed and conc ealed by the foliage of the tree of Hathor unde r which they were refreshed. If these do not hide themselves, they make their refuge and secret resting place ben eath the tree. “I embrace and make my asylum of the sycamore,” says the speaker in the Ritual (64, 24). In the book of Genesis the fruit of the tree is the means of know ing good from evil, and in the Ritual bot h the good and evil are determined by the nat ure of the food presented to the cultivators of the garden, or field of divine harvest, in Amenta as it was on earth. The speaker has a choi ce between the good and the evil — that is, betwixt the food offered by the Apap - serpent of evil, which is denounc ed a s detestable, vile, excrementitious , and the fruit of the tree, upon which the gods and all good spirits feed. The speaker repudi ates the Typhoni an diet. He onl y accepts that which is offered to him by a messenge r who com es from the gods and not from the A pap - serpent. He subs ists on the food which is the bread of Horus and Taht. “The Osiris feeds on the fruit which is produc ed by the sycam ore - fig tree of Hathor .” On that he is nour ished in his turn. In Egypt ian the wise spirits are the akeru, which are the wise spirits of the instructed dead, and in eating the fruit of the tree the eaters are to becom e the wise as spirits. This therefore is the tree of wisdom , or of know ledge . In this way, eating of the tree is a part of the process by which the manes in the garden make their transformation into pur e spirits. Certain of the baser sort of manes were represented as feeding in Amenta on the excremental foul nesses of hum an life. In chapter 32 the speaker exclaims, “Back, crocodi le of the east, who livest upon tho se that devour their ow n excrement!” There is a Manga ian representation of som e poor wretches in Savaiki who are doom ed to endur e the indi gni ty of being befoul ed by the fæces that fall from the more fortuna te spirits who are happy in their world of plenty ove rhead. (Gill, p. 164) . The doc trine is native to the Book of the Dead. The Egypt ians held that thos e who were foul and filthy in this life woul d be fed on excremental matter in the next. The dirty woul d be dirty still. The Catamite and Sodom ite woul d de vou r the fæces that are proba bly denot ed figuratively by the words hesu and ushem, which 465 the deceased abom inates when he asserts that he doe s not eat the dirt or drink the lye. It is pos sible that hints for the story of eating that which was prohi bi ted, and the becom ing aware of their nakedne ss by the gui lty pair, and their hiding unde r the trees, were taken from chapters 53 A, B and 124 of the Ritual. The speaker who has been cons tituted a soul by Osiris says, “That which is forbidde n I do not eat. I do not walk"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"upon it with my sanda ls.” Here the forbidde n thing is odi ous because it is evil, filthy, excremental.

The speaker for bot h says they eat unde r the trees and beautiful branches of the tree upon which the fruit grow s within reach (124 , 1, 4). The not ion of a tree that grew forbidd en fruit is proba bly of totemic origin, with a mystical appl ication to sexual unc leanne ss. The peopl e whos e totem was a particular tree woul d be forbidde n to eat of its fruit, or if it were eaten it must be sacramentally, because it was sacred to them. “Do not eat forbidde n food, ” is a com mand sternly spoke n to the young men in the initiation ceremoni es of the Arunt a tribes. In one episode the guilty pair, having eaten of the tree that was to make them wise, perceive themselves to be naked in the garden, a nd are then clothed with skins by Iahu - Elohi m. This also may be expl icated by the gnos is. The manes in the Ritual cons ist of the clothed and the naked. Thos e who pass the judgm ent hall becom e the clothed. The beatified spirits are inve sted with the robe of the righteous , the stole of Ra, in the garden. There was a special inve stiture by the god in the garden of Aarru. This clothing in the garden is likewise a part of the process by which the manes pass into the state of spirits. The inve stiture in the garde n of Hetep denot es a spirit made perfect in the likeness of the Lord. This is follow ed at a distance in the Hebrew Genesis. When the man and wom an are inve sted in their coats of skin they also becom e spirits, if not as the spirits of the just made perfect. And Iahu - Elohim said, “Behol d, the man is becom e as one of us, to know good from evil.” The deceased pleads that he may attain the “inve stiture of the garden” (ch. 110 ). When clothed they issue in what is termed the “com ing forth in exul tation” (Renouf , c h. 99). “I hasten to the land, and I fasten my stole upon me, that I may com e forth and take pos session of the wealth assigne d to me” (ch. 110 ). “I range within the garden of Hetep; I fasten my stole upon me” (ch. 110 ). “I am the girdled one , com ing forth in trium ph” (ch. 117) . Now in the judgm ent scenes there is a skin called the nem - skin suspende d ove r a sign that represents the ba - soul (Hor - Apol lo, I, 40). The word nem denot es anot her, a second, also to repeat. Thus the nem skin is a second skin, cove rin g, or inve stiture. That which it hangs on in the vigne tte signi fies a soul . So that the nem - skin means anot her garment for the soul . The lord of transformations is said to have num erous skins, as the rehabiliments of soul s. A new skin was equi valent to a n ew lease of existence. It is this clothing 466 of the manes in a coat of skin that is repeated in the book of Genesis. Whatsoever astronom ical data there may have been for the typi cal rende ring of a fall in heaven, or from the Garden of Eden, it is the Semites, not the Egyptians , who are respons ible for introduc ing a fall into the moral dom ain and calling it the veritabl e fall of man in the beginni ng. The Babyl oni ans handl ing of the Egypt ian wisdom was begun by falsifying it on behalf of an inde finitely later system of theology, which was cont inue d on the Hebrew line of descent in the book of Genesis. Besides which, if the fall of Adam from paradise is identifiable with the falling away of Atum in the astronom ical"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"mythol ogy, it becom es at onc e appa rent t hat the restoration from the effects of such a fall is equa lly astronom ical and a matter of scientific verification. Atum , as father, sank dow n to Amenta every night, and every morning there was a restoration of the light made by the second Atum in his cha racter of the yout hful solar god. In the same way Atum , the closer of the year, was the autum n sun that went dow n in the winter solstice and rose again in the equi nox as ope ner and restorer in the person of Nefer - Tum , the com ing son, who was Iu - su= Jesus as Egypt ian. So was it through all the cycles of time, includi ng finally the cycle of the great year of the world. On the scale of precession he who made the lapse at first as Atum or Adam woul d naturally make the restoration as Iu at the end of 26, 000 years for thos e who right ly kept the reckoni ng and did not mistake this great endi ng in time for an actual endi ng of the world. It was the subj ect of astronom ical prophe cy that Atum in person of the son (that is, the su or sa) woul d com e again to restore that w hich was lost of old, when time had once more travelled to the place of the beginni ng in the Lion sign, the station of the sphi nx in heaven, who kept the secret for the mystery teachers of the eternal, or in whichever sign the cycle was to be fulfilled, wh en paradise woul d be regained, and all woul d be onc e more as at the first; when, as Vergil sang of the great cyclical renewal, “There shall be anot her ark, steered by anot her pilot, bearing the chos en heroes” (the twelve kings or gods that voya ged in the s olar bark), “and there shall be other wars, and great Achilles shall be sent onc e more to Troy” (Vergil, Eclogue IV). In other words, the wande ring Iu or Horus, Prince of Eternity, woul d travel onc e more round the cycle of precession as divine manifestor a nd fulfiller in the great year of the world. The tree of life retained its place and prom inence in the new heavens of Hebrew prophe cy as in the old heaven of the astronom ical mythol ogy. “For unt o you is paradise ope ned; the tree of life is planted, the tim e to com e is prepared, plenteous ness is made ready, a city is bui lded, and rest is allow ed. Sorrow s are passed, and in the end is show n the treasure of immortality” (II Es. VIII. 52 - 54) . All of which had been realized for the Egypt ians in the garden of Het ep, the Aarru - paradise upon the stellar mount of glory. Apart from the astronom ical allegor y, the onl y fall of man was that of the Adam whom the seven Elohi m tried to make out of the red earth, but failed from lack of the immortal spark of spirit, which w as ascribed to the father in heaven when the hum an father had been 467 indi vidua lized on earth. This was the man of flesh who was bor n, not begot ten; the man who descende d from the mother onl y — that is, totemic man, who was shaped by the appr entice hands of the seven pow ers, toge ther with their mother, and who preceded the supr eme being. The first - formed Adam was of the earth earthy, of the flesh fleshly, the man of matter=the mother. This was the origin of an oppos ition betwixt the flesh and spirit, the m an of earth and the man from heaven, which led to a doc trine of natural depravity and pol lution of the flesh when com pared with the pur ity of spirit. The doctrine of natural depravity did not originate in the moral dom ain, it originated in matter cons idere d to be at enm ity with the spirit. The cause of this depravity in the flesh was ascribed to the wom an after the soul or spirit had been assigne d to the fatherhood. The mother was the maker of flesh from her ow n blood or the red earth, and in one particular"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"pha se the blood of the wom an was held to be vile and filthy. Job asks, “How can man be clean that is bor n of a wom an?” (XXV. 4). But this “depravity” was a result of conf oundi ng the blood as virgin sour ce of life with the menstrualia. There is a hint of t he doc trine in the Ritual. In the chapter “whereby one com eth forth to day from Amenta,” the manes says, “Shine thou on me, O gracious power; as I draw nigh to the divine words which my ears shall hear in the Tuat, let no pol lution of my mother be upon me. ” The speaker is making his transformations into the glorious body of a manes who will be perfected in becom ing pur e spirit, which is the antithesis of the earthly body that was made flesh in the blood of the mother. “Let no pol lution of my mother be upon me” is equi valent to saying, “Deliver me from all fleshliness of the old earth life.” Here, how ever, the utterer of this prayer is one of the manes who has risen in the shape of the old body, but change d in texture, and who is desirous of being purified an d perfected in the likeness of the hol y spirit, which is persona lized in Amenta as Horus, the anoi nted son of god the father. A hundr ed times ove r one sees how these utterances pertaining to Amenta have been perverted through being assigne d to hum an beings in the life on earth. The addi tiona l features adde d by the Semites to the original version of the mythos cons ist in the introduc tion of a primal pair of mortals eating the forbidde n fruit; the temptation and seduc tion of the wom an by the deceiving serpen t; the turning of the wom an into the tempter of the man; the criminality of the first parents, who lost the world and damned the race before a child was bor n; the creation of an original sin which was destined to ove rshadow the hum an family with an antenat al cloud of gui lt and of hereditary depravity, and thus prepare the way and the need for the Christian scheme of redemption to regain a paradisaical condi tion which was never lost and never had existed. These were the crow ning achievements of thos e who fal sified the teachings of the Egypt ians. Nothing coul d better illustrate the difference between the two versions than the oppos ite treatment of work. In the biblical travesty the curse is to com e to the man in the shape of work and to the wom an with the labo ur pangs of maternity. Whereas in the Ritual work is the blessing and the workers in Aarru are the blessed. They cultivate their ow n allotted por tions in the field of divine harvest, and may be said to 468 make their way and win their other world by work . For the Egyp tian coul d find his heaven in the satisfaction of accom plished work. Again, if we take Ani and his wife, Tutu, as representatives of the pair, onc e hum an, and now manes, in the garden, we shall find that so far from the “wom an” having been th e cause of a fall in the Egypt ian Genesis, so far from her having been an agent of the evil serpent, or of Satan, as the Christian fathers ignor antly alleged and brutally maintained, she, the onl y one who ever had been a wom an in this or in other forms of the pair, is portrayed as defende r of the man all through the trials and temptations that beset him in his passage through the nether world. She is his gui de and protector. She propitiates the pow ers with offerings on his behalf. She makes his music and hi s magic all the way. The pair in Eden or the earthly paradise fulfil two characters in the Kamite myth and eschatology. They are either two of the gods , as Atum and Kefa (Kep), or two of the glorified, as Ani and Tutu. But in neither are the male and fema le in the garden a pair of hum an beings ; bot h as the gods and the glorified they are supr a - munda ne and"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"doubl y non - hum an. Finally, if the “fall” had ever been a veritable fact, the subs eque nt history of man might be sum med up as one long, vast, unc easing, v ain ende avour to remedy the disaster and the failure that befell the divine gove rnm ent of the uni verse in such a helpless way as woul d destroy all future trust. The vessel woul d have been lost in the act of being launc hed, and not a hand reached forth to s ave the victims unt il som e nineteen centuries ago, when God himself is said to have com e dow n in person for a long - belated rescue of shipw recked hum anity. But the Semitic story of the fall is false, and the scheme of redemption founde d on it is conseque ntl y fraudul ent. As it com es to us, the book of Genesis is based on misappr opr iated legends . It is respons ible for an utterly errone ous account of creation and the origin of evil, and its damnation of the race through Adam’s fall is the sole ground on which t he Christian world can now find foot hol d for its com ing Saviour. And, how ever long or how ever shor t a time the impos ition lasts, “The same old lie, for ever told anew, Will never serve to make the falsehood true.”  469 THE EGYPTIAN WISD OM IN OTHER JEWISH WRITINGS B OOK VIII T HE Kamite mythos of the old lost garden may be seen transforming into Hebrew legenda ry lore when Ezekiel describes an Eden that was sunk and bur ied in the low ermost parts of the earth. “Thus saith the Lord . . . Whe n I cast him (Pharaoh) dow n to Sheol with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, . . . and all that drink water were com forted in the nether parts of the earth. . . .” “To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the tree s of Eden? Yet shalt thou be brought dow n with the trees of Eden into the nether parts of the earth; thou shalt lie in the midst of the unc ircum cised.” (Ez. XXXI. 15, 16, 18.) This is the Garden of Eden in She ol, and Sheol is a Semitic version of the Egypt ian Amenta. That is why the lost Gan - Eden is to be found in the nether parts of the earth as an out cast of the later theology . When the word Sheol in the Old Testament is rendered in Engl ish by “the grave,” it is inadequa te times out of num ber. The Hebrew writers were not always speaking or thinki ng of the grave when they wrote of Sheol, which has to be bot tom ed in"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"Amenta, the divine nether - earth, not simply in the tom b. The grave is not identical with hell, nor the pit - hol e with the bottom less pit. The pa ngs and sorrow s of Sheol, like the pur ging pangs of the Rom ish pur gatory, have to be studi ed in the Egypt ian Ritual. Many of the moanings and the groanings in the Psalms are the utterances of Osiris or the Osiris suffering in Amenta. They are the cries for assistance in Sheol. The appe als in the hous e of bonda ge for help from on high, and for deliverance from afflictions and maladies more than hum an, were uttered in Amenta before they were heard in Sheol, and the Psalmist who first wrote the suppl ications o n behalf of the manes was know n as the divine scribe Taht before the Psalms in Hebrew were ascribed to David. The speaker of Psalm XVI is talking pur e Egypt ian doc trine in Amenta conc erning his soul and body when he says, “My flesh shall dw ell in safety, f or thou wilt not leave my soul in Sheol; neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corrupt ion; thou wilt show me the path of life; in thy presence is the fulness of joy, in thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.” As we see from the Ritual, thi s is the manes expr essing his conf idence in the duration of his persona lity, the persistence of his sahu or mum my - soul in 470 Amenta, and his hope of being vivified for ever by the Holy Spirit and led along the pathw ay of eternal life by Horus the Redeem er to the right hand of his father, Atum - Ra. He is the sleeper in Amenta when he says, “I shall behol d thy face in righteous ness; I shall be satisfied with thy likeness when I awake” (Ps. XVII. 15) . The Osiris woke in Sekhe m, where he saw the likeness of h is Lord who left his picture there; his true likeness as the risen one transformed, transfigur ed, and divinely glorified, that looke d upon the manes, smiling sun - wise through the defecating mist of death, for the Osiris to com e forth and follow him. The sp eaker was in Amenta as the land of bonda ge when the “cords of Sheol” were bound about him. He was assimilated to the suffering Horus, sitting blind and helpless in the utter darkne ss, pierced and torn and bleeding from the wounds inflicted on him by Sut, w ho had been his ow n familiar friend, his twin - brother, and who had turned against him and betrayed him to his death. The most memorable sayings in the Psalms, and the most misleading when misunde rstood, are uttered in this character of Osiris, who was the typical victim in Amenta, where he was tormented by the follow ers of Sut, the forsaken sufferer who was piteous ly left to cry, “My God! My God! Why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me?” The sufferer is in Sheol, the miry pit, when he says, “I sink in deep mire.” “Deliver me out of the mire, and let not Sheol shut her mout h upon me” (Ps. LXIX. 2, 14, 15). Sheol, then, is one with Amenta, and the drama with its characters and teachings belongs to the mysteries of Amenta, which are attr ibut ed to Taht, the Egypt ian psalmist, who is the great chief in Sekhe m, the place where Horus suffered or Osiris died. Taht was the writer of the sayings attributed to Horus in his dua l character of the hum an sufferer in Amenta and of Horus - Tema, the divi ne avenge r of the sufferings that were inflicted on Osiris by the “wicked,” the Sami, the co - cons pirators with Sut, the Egypt ian Juda s. This will account for the non - natural imagery and huge ly inhu man langua ge ascribed to the suppos ed historic David, who a s writer was primarily the psalmist Taht, and who called dow n the divine wrath upon the accursed Typhoni ans for what they had done in bindi ng, torturing, and piercing Horus (or Osiris) and pur suing him to death. So"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"far as the langua ge of Taht remains in th e Psalms of David, it is inhum an because the characters of the drama were originally non - hum an. This is one of the many misrende rings that have to be rectified by means of the Egypt ian Ritual, when we have discriminated between the earth of time and the ea rth of eternity, between the denizens of Jude a and the manes in Sheol, and learned that the Hebrew and Christian histories of these mystical matters have been com pounde d out of the Egypt ian eschatology. It is not eworthy that certain of the Psalms, in two different groups (XLII to XLIX and LXXXIV to LXXXVIII), are specialized as “Psalms of the Sons of Korah.” These were the rebels, onc e upon a time, who, according to Hebrew tradition, disappe ared when the earth ope ned and swallow ed them up alive. This is a legend of Amenta. The onl y earth that ever swallow ed hum an beings was the nether - earth of Sheol; and if we take our stand with the sons of Korah in Amenta we can 471 read these Psalms and see how they shoul d especially appl y to thos e who were swallow ed b y Sheol in the nether - world. “One thing,” says a com mentator, “which adde d to this surprising occurrence, is that when Korah was swallow ed in the earth his sons were preserved.” They went dow n to the pit in death, but lived on as did the manes in Amenta. T he sons of Korah are in Sheol. But, says the speaker, “God will redeem my soul from the pow er of Sheol” (Ps. XLIX. 15) . He exclaims, “Bring me unt o thy hol y hill and to thy tabernacles.” Psalm XLV is a Psalm addr essed to the anoi nted son, the king= the roya l Horus, who com es as a conque ror of death and Sheol. Psalm XLVII is a song of the resurrection from Amenta. “God is gone up with a shout ,” to sit upon his hol y throne , in the eternal city” on his hol y mount ain,” which was the way up from the dark valley f or thos e who, like “the sons of Korah,” sank into the nether - earth, but who lived on to rise again and reach the sum mit of the sacred mount . The Kamite steps of ascent were bur ied as a fetish figur e in the coffins with the dead for use, typi cally, when the y woke to life in Amenta. It is said to the Osiris in the Ritual, “Osiris, thou hast received thy sceptre, thy pedestal, and the flight of stairs beneath thee”; this was in readiness for his resurrection. These images of the stand on which the gods were el evated, like Anup at the pol e, the tat of stability, and the steps of ascent to heaven, were bur ied with the mummy as emblems of divine protection which are with him when he emerges from the com atose state of the dead. The steps thus bur ied stand for the m ount ain of ascent. We are reminde d of this by the Psalmist when he sings , “O Lord, thou has brought up my soul from Sheol. Thou, Lord, of thy favour hadst made my mount ain to stand strong” (Ps. XXX. 37) — the mount ain that was imaged in the tomb by the steps with the aid of which the deceased makes the ascent from Amenta, and can say, “I am the lord of the stairs. I have made my nest on the hor izon” (Rit., ch. 85) . The Pharaoh Unas exul ts that the ladde r or steps have been suppl ied to him by his father, Ra, a s means of ascent to spirit world. When King Pepi makes his exodus from the low er earth to the Elysian Fields Sut sets up his maket, or ladde r, in Amenta by which the manes reaches the hor izon; and, secondl y, Horus erects his ladde r by which the spirit of Pepi reaches up to heaven. This divides the steps of ascent into halves of seven each as these are figur ed in the seven steps of the solar boa t. Thus the total num ber is four teen, as it was in the luna r mythos when the eye of the full moon was attained at the sum mit of fourteen steps or top of the staircase. The number, as"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"may be expl ained, was fifteen in the soli - luna r reckoni ng of the mont h. Thus in one com put ation there were fifteen steps to the ladde r of ascent from the depths of Amenta to the sum mit of the mount . Now , fifteen of the Psalms (CXX to CXXXIV) are termed “Psalms of degrees.” In the Hebrew they are called “a Song of ascents.” In the Chaldee they were designa ted “a song that was sung upon the steps of the aby ss.” These are the steps from the a bys s or depths of Sheol mentione d by the speaker, who says, “Thou shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth” (Ps. LXXI. 20). “Out of the depths have I cried unt o thee, O Lord” (Ps. CXXX. 1). Thus the steps cons tituted a means of ascent from Sheo l or Amenta, 472 and in the song of ascents we can identify the staircase of the great god by which the sum mit of the mount was attained. The speaker has dw elt long in the death - dark land. He will lift up his eyes to the moun tains, or the moun t: “Unto th ee do I lift up mine eyes, O thou that sittest in the heavens.” “The Lord hath chosen Zion: he hath desired it for his habitation” — as he had already done when his name was Khnum , or Osiris, the lord of Sheni (Rit., ch. 36). The celestial mount ain is the pl ace where the throne was prepared for the last judgm ent in the mysteries of Amenta, and figur ed in the maat upon the sum mit of the mount . It was there Osiris sat “in his throne judging right eous ly” “as king for ever.” The mount was also called the staircas e of the great god. Osiris is said to sit at the head of the staircase, surrounde d by his circle of gods (Rit., ch. 22) . In the pre - Osirian cult it was Atum - Ra who sat as the great judge in the maat, the hall of truth, law, and justice. As we have seen, th e mount on high was also imaged by other type s of the ascent to heaven. The speaker in the song of ascents or the psalms of fifteen degrees is at the base of the mythical mount in Sheol=Amenta. The lord whom he addr esses is upon the sum mit of his hol y hil l, just as Osiris, or Atum or Sebek, is the great god seated at the head of the staircase. In his distress he cries unt o the Lord for deliverance from the enemy, who is Sut the liar and deceiver; “him that hateth peace.” “My soul ,” he says, “Hath long had her dw elling with him that hateth peace. I am for peace.” “Woe is me!” he cries, “that I sojour n in Meshech” (Ps. CXX. 5). Meshech, or meska in the Egypt ian, as a place - name signi fies the place of scour ging and pur ifying in Suten - Khen. It is the Kamite pur gatory as a place of rebirth in Amenta (Rit., ch. 17) for the soul , on its resurrection from the dead prior to the ascent of the steps, the ladde r, staircase, colum n, or mount . On passing through the sixth abode of Amenta (Rit., chs. 72 and 149 ) the speake r pleads, “Let me not be stoppe d at the meska; let not the wicked have mastery ove r me.” “Let me join my two hands toge ther in the divine dw elling which my father Atum hath given me, he who hath established an abode for me above the earth, wherein is wheat and barley of unt old qua ntity, which the son of my ow n body offereth to me there as obl ations upon my festivals.” And when the manes has passed through the meska or place of pur ifying he prays to be delivered from the hells that await the damned. In Meshe ch or the meska the sufferer says he will lift up his eyes unt o the mount ains from whence his help shall com e. The mount is pluralized, but it is the sum mit upon which stands the heavenly Jerusalem, “bui lded as a city that is com pact toge ther, whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of Ihuh , to give thanks unt o the Lord.” There were set “the throne s for judgm ent, the throne s of the hous e of David,” which are the twelve throne s in"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"heaven, as described in the book of Revelation. The singl e mount is Zion, th e Egypt ian shennu, or hetep, the mount of rest. “For the Lord hath chosen Zion, He hath desired it for His habitation; This is my resting - place for ever.” — Ps., CX XXII On the last of the fifteen steps of ascent a call is made upon the starry lu minaries to praise the Lord. “Bless ye the Lord, all ye 473 servants of the Lord, which by night stand in the hous e of the Lord. Lift up your hands to the sanctuary, and bless ye the Lord. The Lord bless thee out of Zion” (Ps. CXXXIV). These are they who stand by night around the throne at the top of the steps, and this last finishing touc h is very definitely astronom ical. As Egypt ian, there was an uppe r circle of the great spirits round the throne upon the sum mit of the mount , who were called the shennu, and the mount of the shennu= Mount Zion. Unde r one of its Egyp tian names the valley of Amenta or Sheol is called “Akar.” This valley of Akar we identify with Achor, the valley of sorrow in the Hebrew. ‘Achor ’s gloom y vale” is sung of in the Christian hym n , and this is the essential character of Akar. It has been obs erved by Renouf that the notion of obs curity is conne cted with Akar, whereas the not ion of bright ness is essentially associated with the mount ( Proc. Soc . Bib. Arch., March 7, 1893, p. 223) . The two gates of Akar are mentione d in the pyr amid texts of Pepi (line 72) as equi valent in sense to the two gates of Seb or the earth (Renouf , Rit., ch. 39, not e). The difference lies betwixt the mythical and eschatologi cal appl ication. The gates of Seb refe r to our earth, and the gates of Akar to Amenta, the land of shades in the earth of eternity. When the valley of Achor is to becom e a door of hope it is in the wake of the solar god who goe s forth from the gate of Akar to the sum mit of the mount . Israel wa s to be judge d and to make answer in the judgm ent hall (which stood at the place of exit in the topogr aphy of Amenta), “as in the day when she (previous ly) came up out of the land of Egypt ,” which was one and the same thing in the mythical representation o f the Exodus (Hosea II. 15) . In fact, the suppos ed history is identified with the mythos by Esdras, who por trays the last judgm ent, which is to be as it was in the time of Achan when he was doom ed to die in the valley of Achor , the Egypt ian valley of the s hadow of Akar (II Es. VII. 26 - 37) . In this valley was the sepul chre of Osiris, betwixt the two mount ains or hor izons of the west and east. So the graves of the Hottentot deity Heitsi - Eibib were made in a valley or narrow pass between two mount ains, and fro m these he, like Osiris, rose again and made his transformation in the tree of dawn. The nature of Achor is indi cated by Hosea when he says of Israel (II. 14, 15) , “I will allure her and bring her into the wilderness, and I will give her the valley of Ach or for a door of hope , and she shall make answer in the judgm ent there.” It was in Achor that the stoni ng of Achan occurred, in the valley of venge ance, and it is there that Israel was to answer for all her iniquities. Thus , whatsoever events had occurred in Achor ’s gloom y vale took place in the Akar or Auke rti of the nether - earth, which was a place of passage for the manes through Amenta. In the distance lay the Aarru - paradise with the seven cow s called the providers of plenty resting in the green meadow s, and out"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"of these arose the mount ain of the Lord, upon the sum mit of which was the place of rebirth in the uppe r paradise, the abode of the blessed. This is the imagery made use of by Isaiah (LXV. 9, 12) : “Thus saith the Lord: I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Juda h an inhe ritor of my mount ain; and my chos en 474 shall inhe rit it, and my servants shall dw ell there. And Sharon shall be a pasture for flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie dow n in, for my peopl e that have so ught me. But ye that forsake the Lord, that forget my hol y mount ain, that prepare a table for fortune and that fill up mingled wine unt o destiny, I will destine you to the sword.” This is the mount ain of Amenta. Fortune and Destiny are two Egypt ian deities who are mentione d here by the name of Gad and Meni, but onl y mentione d to be abjured. As Egypt ian the godde ss of fortune was Rannut , who was also the giver of good fortune in the harvest. The god of destiny or fate was Shai, the appor tione r of the lot. Th ese are to be cast out and their worshippe rs destroye d, but the moul d of the imagery remains in the valley of Achor . Inde ed, the chart of Jude a looks like a copy of the scenery in Amenta as it woul d be if the land had been originally mappe d out by the emig rants from Egypt . Amenta and the Aarru - paradise, with its heaven on the sum mit of the mount , have been repeated at innum erable sacred places of the world, such as the Garden of the Gods and the hol y mount ain of Shasta in Colorado. The first resurrection o f two and the com ing forth to day occur in the valley of Akar. The valley of passenge rs, the bur ial - place for Gog and his multitude ; the valley of Elah, the valley of giants, the valley of the Repha im, the valley of death, the valley of judgm ent, the valle y of Siddi m, the valley of Hinom — are all figur es of Amenta in the nether - earth of the mythos and eschatology, and therefore of the Hebrew Sheol. The “valley of decision” (Joel III. 14) is likewise the valley of Amenta associated with the mount of the Lord, the valley of the low er earth in which the great judgm ent was delivered at the end of the world, or age, or cycle of time, which was annua l in the mysteries, as it still is in the Jewish ceremoni es celebrated at the end of every year. The Lord is about to judge the whol e world in the valley of judg ment, here called Jehos apha t. “Multitude s, multitude s in the valley of decision, for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. The sun and moon are darkened, and the stars withdr aw their shining. And the Lord shall roar (as the god in lion form — Rit., 54, 1) from Zion, and utter his voi ce from Jerusalem; and the heavens shall shake; but the Lord will be a refuge unt o his peopl e, and a strongho ld to the children of Israel. So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God dw elling in Zion my hol y mount ain. And it shall com e to pass in that day that the mount ain shall drop dow n sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Juda h shall run with waters, and a fount ain shall com e forth out of the hous e of the Lord and water the valley of the acacias.” Every feature of this imagery is and ever had been Egypt ian. The valley of decision is the Egypt ian valley of judgm ent in which the great hall of mati, the hous e of the Lord in the solar mytho s, was the judg ment - seat. The lord who sat in judgm ent was Atum , in his lion form as lord of terrors. The lord enthrone d upon his hol y mount ain was Atum - Ra upon the mount ain of Amenta which the manes climbed for their rebirth in heaven. The mount ain that s oul s are com mande d to flee to for safety in the time of troub le and threatened destruction – which is repeated in"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"the New Testament – is the mount ain of the manes, who fled to its sum mit in the likeness of 475 birds. This is expr essed in Psalm XI, “In the Lo rd put I my trust. How say ye to my soul — flee as a bird (or birds) to your mount ain. For lo, the wicked bend the bow ; they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may shoot in darkne ss at the upr ight of heart. The Lord is in his hol y temple, the Lord, his throne is in heaven,” on the sum mit of the solar mount to which the hawk - headed manes fled and were out of the reach of the rebels, the Sebau, the wicked, the Sut - Typhoni ans who pur sued and shot at them in the darkne ss, and who were rained upon w ith fire and brimstone and the burning blast, or ove rwhelmed with the inunda tion in the Red Sea or lake of Putrata in Amenta. According to the ancient Osirian mythos , there was a cleft in the hill - side at Abydos , through which the manes passed as hum an - hea ded birds in the shape of hawks or herons . This was a prototypa l representation of the soul s fleeing for refuge to the mount ain, that was afterwards repeated in Semitic legends , Hebrew and Arabic. The typi cal valley, then, goe s with the mythical mount ain or mount ains in the Hebrew writings . The valley of Amenta is the dw elling - place of the manes, which are represented as the repha im who answer to the Egyptian repait. The repait, or pait, are the dead below the earth who are in the custody of Seb. The repha im are the dead in the Hebrew Sheol. In the day of venge ance, says Isaiah, “it shall be as when the corn is reaped and the ears are gleaned in the valley of Repha im.” In the valley of Amenta was the field of divine harvest and the vintage of venge ance. In tracing the Israelites on their jour ney out of Low er Egypt we shall meet with the repha im, who are the giants and at the same time shades of enor mous stature. Meanw hile, whatsoever battles were fought or vast events occurred in the valley of the repha im, t hey took place in the earth of the dead, and not upon the uppe r earth. The giant king of Bashan was one of the repha im; Goliath, the colossus, was anot her of the repha im; and these giants dw elt in the valley of the repha im. Cons eque ntly, the conque rors of the rephaim, whether called Moses or Abraham, Joshua or David, who warred with the giants as shades of the dead in the valley of the repha im, coul d no more be historical characters than were the repha im themselves. On entering the dark valley of Amenta th e Egypt ian manes most assiduous ly seeks for the place of refuge and safety provi ded by the great god, and for the entrance to the ark or tabernacle of Osiris - Ra. This is a secret cove rt in the midst of Akar. Osiris is denom inated “lord of the shrine which stande th at the centre of the earth” (Rit., ch. 64) . It is said by the speaker in the Litany of Ra, “Here is the Osiris; carry him into the hidde n sanctuary of Osiris, lord of eternity, who is unde r the care of the two divine sisters that give protection i n the tomb! Carry him into the hidde n dw elling where Osiris resides, and which is in Amenta, the mysterious sanctuary of the god at rest. Bear him, ope n your arms to him, stretch out you r hands to him, take off your veils before him, for he is the great es sence whom the dead spirits do not know ,” but to whom they are inde bted for the resurrection to new life. In the Psalms the tabernacle or sanctuary in Sheol takes the place of the ark or secret shrine of Osiris in Amenta. “Lord, who shall sojour n in thy Ta bernacle?” (Ps. XV. 1). “In the court of his tabernacle shall he hide me” (Ps."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":" 476 XXVII. 5). “In Salem is his tabernacle, and his dw elling - place in Zion” (Ps. LXXVI. 2). The resurrection of the manes took place in Sheol or Amenta. And it is as the risen manes in Sheol that the speaker seeks to dw ell in the sanctuary of the Lord and to cont emplate his temple. Hence he says, “In the cove rt of his tabernacle (or dw elling) shall he hide me. He shall lift me upon a rock. I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifi ces of joy” (Ps. XXVII). Such sacrifices or offerings are made to Osiris in his shrine of earth or tabernacle in Amenta, as show n by the vigne ttes to the Ritual. This was the “stronghol d of salvation to his anoi nted” in the earth of eternity. This we take to be the tabernacle, sanctuary, or hous e of the lord in Sheol, of which it is said, “Who shall sojour n in the tabernacle?” “In the day of troubl e he shall keep me secretly in his pavilion. In the cove rt of his tabernacle shall he hide me” (Ps. XXVII. 5, 6 ), “in the place where the divine glory dw elleth” (Ps. XXVI. 6). The mum my - Osiris in Amenta is the figure of a sleeping deity. This, as the mum my - Ptah or Putah, we hol d to have been the prototype of the sleeping Buddha . The mum my - image of divinity was con tinue d in Osiris - Sekeri. He is the inert in matter, the sleeping or resting divinity, the breathless one ; Urt - Hat, the god of the non - beating heart, the silent Sekari. Such also is the divine sleeper who is piteous ly appe aled to by the hum an sufferer in Sh eol, and who is identical with Osiris sleeping in Amenta. The speaker in the Psalms cries “unt o the Lord with his voi ce,” “Arise, O Lord! save me, O my God! ” “Arise, O God, judge the earth. O God, keep not thou silence. Hold not thy peace, and be not still , O God” (Ps. LXXXII. 8, LXXXIII. 1). The waking preceded the great judgm ent. “Arise, O Lord, in thine ange r; lift up thys elf against the rage of mine adve rsaries, and awake for me. Thou hast com manded judgm ent” (Ps. VII. 6). “O Lord, when thou awakest tho u shalt despise their help” (Ps. XLIV. 23, 26). “Then the Lord awaked as one out of a sleep, and he smote his adversaries backw ard” (Ps. LXXVIII. 65). This is the awaking of the god as Amsu, whip in hand, when he arises and asserts his sove reignt y ove r all the oppos ing pow ers. The speaker is in the pos ition of the Osiris, as the mum my sleeping in Amenta when he pleads with the protecting pow er, “Keep me as the appl e of the eye. Hide me unde r the shadow of thy wings from the wicked that spoi l me, my deadly e nemies that com pass me about .” “As for me, I shall behol d thy face in right eous ness; I shall be satisfied with thy likeness when I awake” (Ps. XVII. 8 - 15). In these passages Osiris the mum my - god as sleeper in Amenta and the Osiris as a manes are bot h repre sented, and are bot h distingui shable each from the other. The speaker in Psalm XVII is in Sheol waiting to awake in the living likeness of this redeemer from death, and he is surrounde d by “the wicked,” who are the “deadly enemies” that com pass him about . He cries, “Deliver my soul from the wicked which is thy sword” — as pow er of puni shm ent (XVII. 13) . It is the wicked who com e upon the sufferer “to eat up his flesh,” not as canni bals on earth, but as evil spirit - pow ers of prey (Ps. XXVII. 2). The oppone nts of the sun and the manes appe ar in the Psalms as the adve rsary and the adve rsaries. The indi vidua l adve rsary is discriminated from the 477 "},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"adve rsaries. Also the indi vidua l adve rsary is reproduc ed in the two characters of the Apap - dragon and of Sut or Sat an, onc e the familiar friend or twin brother of the good Osiris, and afterwards his betrayer and inve terate persona l enemy. Now , the adve rsaries of Osiris, or of soul s in Amenta, include the Sebau, and these are the “wicked” by name, for the word in Egyp ti an signi fies the profane, impious , blasphe mous , culpable, or wicked. They rise up from Amenta as the pow ers of darkne ss in revol t, but are for ever driven back into their native night by Horus or Ra, Taht or Shu. These are the wicked of whom it is said in the Psalm, “They shall return or be driven back to Sheol” (Ps. IX. 17) . The com parative process show s that, like Taht, the Psalmist ope ns in Amenta, the place of the wicked who have no pow er to “stand in the judgm ent.” The “wicked” in Amenta are the adve r saries of the sun and the soul of man. These are the rebels who for ever rise in impot ent revol t against the Lord and his anoi nted, Osiris - Ra and Horus in the Ritual, Ihuh the father - god and David the belove d in the Psalms. The “wicked” rage against the Lo rd and his anoi nted, saying, “Let us break their bands asunde r and cast away their cords from us” (Ps. II. 3). These are the “cords of death,” the “cords of the wicked” (Ps. CXXIX. 4), the cords with which the manes are fettered in the land of bonda ge and the depths of Sheol. The Lord that sitteth in the heavens has these children of failure in derision. He has set his son as king upon the hol y hill of Zion, who is to break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a pot ter’s vessel. These are th ey of whom it is said to the Lord, “Thou hast broke n the teeth of the wicked.” That is in defence of the sufferer in Sheol, who exclaims, “I cry unt o the Lord with my voice, and he answereth me out of his hol y hill. I laid me dow n in death and slept; I awa ked, for the Lord sustaineth me” (Ps. III. 4, 5). Osiris the typical sufferer in Amenta was imaged as the mum my bound up in the banda ges of bur ial. As Osiris the mum my he was the Karest or prototypa l Corpus Christi. As Osiris - Sekeri he was the coffined one . As Osiris - sahu he rose again in a spiritual body . As Osiris - tat he was a figure of eternal stability. For reasons now to be adduc ed, Osiris, or the Osiris, represents that typi cal sufferer whos e cries and ejaculations are to be heard ascendi ng from Ament a in the Egypt ian Ritual and from Sheol in the Hebrew Psalms. David pleading in the cave is equi valent to Osiris crying in the caverns of Sut in Amenta. He says, “I cry with my voi ce unt o the Lord. With my voice unt o the Lord do I make my suppl ications . I said, Thou art my refuge , my por tion in the land of the living” (he being in Sheol, the land of the dead). “I am brought very low . Deliver me from my persecutors. Bring my soul out of prison” (Ps. CXLII). The prison here is identical with the deep, the pi t, the miry clay of Sheol, elsewhere specified. The sufferer in Amenta is Osiris or Horus in the Egypt ian eschatology. He is also the Osiris as the suffering manes. Both have to be taken into account in tracing the sufferer in Sheol. He enters Amenta as a prison - hous e. He prays that it may be ope ned for him to com e forth, so that he 478 may be finally established with thos e who have secured a place among the stars that never set, and who are called the masters of eternity. He cries, “O Ra, ope n the earth! Traverse Amenta and sky! Dissipate our darkne ss! O Ra, com e to us!” (Book of Hades, 4th div., tablets 2, 7, and 8). Amenta or Sheol was the prison - hous e of the soul in death,"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"and the soul of the deceased is por trayed as a prisoner in the banda ges of the m um my, like Osiris in the Kâsu. The Osiris says to the warders of the prisons , “May I not sit within your dunge ons , may I not fall into you r pits” (Rit., ch. 17) . Horus, the deliverer of the “spirits in prison, ” com es to set the prisone rs free from their se pul chres, to dissipate the darkne ss and ope n all the pathw ays to the land of light . In the chapter by which the prison - hous e of Amenta is ope ned to the soul and to the shade of the person, that he may com e forth by day and have the mastery ove r his feet, t he speaker prays that the eye of Horus may deliver his soul . He cries to the keepers, “Imprison not my soul , keep not in custody my shade. Let the path be ope n to my soul . Let it not be made captive by thos e who imprison the shades of the dead” (Rit., ch. 92) . Horus is the Kamite prototype of the chos en one , called the servant by Isaiah, who came “for a light of the Gentiles, to ope n blind eyes, to bring out prisone rs from the dunge on and them that sit in darkne ss out of the prison - hous e” (Is. XLII. 7). It is not pretende d that mortal Horus was bor n on earth of a mother who was a hum an virgin in the hous e of bread at Annu, or that he lived as Unbu the branch at Nazareth or its Kamite equi valent. Such localities in the Ritual are in Amenta, and the transactio ns take place there, not on this earth. There was the prison - hous e of death, and from thence the resurrection to a future life by transformation of the hum an soul into an immortal spirit, as it was represented in the greater and most solemn mysteries. Whe n the mortal entered Amenta, it was in the likeness of Osiris, who had been bodi ly dismembered in his death, and who had to be recons tituted to rise again as the spirit that never died. The mortal on earth was made up of seven cons tituent parts. The Osiris in Amenta had seven soul s, which were collected, put toge ther, and uni fied to becom e the ever - living one . The deceased in the image of the ba - soul asks that he may be given his new heart to rest in him (Rit., ch. 26). He becom es a sahu, or glorified body (ch. 47) . He pleads that the way may be made for his soul , his khu (glory), his shade, and his ka (chs. 91 and 92) . These have to be united in the likeness of the typi cal divine soul which was persona lized as Horus the son of Ra, in whos e image the spirits of the just made perfect finally became the children of God. When the deceased enum erates his soul s, he is a manes in Amenta, and it follow s that when the speaker in the Psalms doe s the same, he is in Sheol, the Hebrew Amenta, not on earth, and therefore is neither a King David nor any other mortal. This identifies the doc trine as Egypt ian. As we have seen, man, formed in the image of God, had seven soul s. Seven soul s were assigne d to Atum - Ra, and the human being who was made in his likeness had seven com pone nt parts. These were described as the ka, the I or ego; the ba, a hum an - headed soul ; the hati, or breathing heart; the sahu, or spiritual body; the khu , 479 or glory; the kha bit, or shade; and finally, the perfect spirit. At least six of these can be identified in a passage of the sixteenth Psalm. “Because he (the Lord) is at my right hand, I shall not be move d. Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh (the mum my - form) also shall dw ell in safety. For thou wilt not leave my soul in S heol; neither wilt thou suffer thine hol y one to see corrupt ion. Thou wilt show me the path of life.” In this passage we can perceive a reference to the hati or breathing heart, the khu or glory, the sahu or mum my - form, the ba - soul , the Horus - spirit, and t he ka. If the kha bit or shade"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"had been mentione d, there woul d have been seven altoge ther, which cons tituted the totality of a future persona lity. The speaker in Psalm VII had said, “Let the enemy pur sue my soul ” (or hum an - headed ba); “let him tread my life (ankhu) dow n to the earth, and lay my glory (khu) in the dus t,” but for all this he will be avenge d upon his adve rsaries in the judgm ent. The khu is the particular soul of the seven that was know n as the luminous one , or the glory — the soul that was brough t up from Sheol or Amenta when it had attained the glory or becom e one of the glorified. At this stage the speaker in the Ritual says, “Here am I; I com e, and am glorified and filled with soul and pow er” (ch. 94) . He has attained the glory of the khu. In t he book of Psalms the speaker, who has passed through Sheol, says, “Thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol.” “Thou hast girded me with gladne ss, to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee” (Ps. XXX. 3, 11, 12). “Awake up, my glory” (Ps. LVII. 8). “I will sing praises with my glory” (Ps., CVII, 1). The langua ge is akin to that of the manes in the Ritual, who says he may be bur ied in the deep, deep grave and be bow ed dow n to the region of anni hilation, yet he shall rise again and be glorified (ch. 30, A ), or he will attain the glory of the venerablekhu. Sheol is a land of darkne ss and the shadow of death. So is Amenta, unt il light ed up with the presence of the sun by night in its nether firmament. Sheol is the place of the repha im or shadow s of the pas t. The repha im are to be found in Amenta as giants, huge shades of enor mous stature; type s of terror, made more formidable by their exagge rated size. Sheol is the place of the shades, the unde r - world to which the soul s of the departed went, and from which the dead were sum mone d by the cons ulters of obot h or familiar spirits. It include s pur gatory and hell, the Ethiopi c Siol and Assyrian Saul. There were deeper abys ses in the abys s, and chambers of death in the hous e of death. “Tophe t” is anot her Hebrew name for Sheol. “A Tophe t is prepared of old . . . . deep and wide” (Is. XXX. 33) , which may be traced to the Egypt ian Tepht , a name of the abys s, the cavern of Apap or hol e of the serpent. It was from Amenta, the hidde n earth, that the ghos ts of the dead were sum mone d by the magi, or rekhi - khe t, not as evil demons , but as pur e, wise spirits. It is from this nether earth of Amenta that the soul of Samuel is suppos ed to have ascende d when invoke d by the witch, pyt hone ss, or 'Eggastrimuqo j of Endor . “And the wom a n said unt o Saul, I see a god (or Elohi m) com ing up out of the earth,” but which earth of the two is not stated in the Hebrew (I Samuel XXVIII. 13) . In several of the Psalms the singe r utters the cries of a soul that suffers purgatorial pains in Sheol. As we have seen, the Egyp tian pur gatory is a 480 dom ain in Amenta called the meska=meshek. It was a place of spiritual rebirth by pur gation — a meaning that survives in the name of pur gatory. This is described in the Ritual (ch. 17) as “the place of scour ging and pur ifying. ” “Let not the Osiris adva nce into the valley of darkne ss.” “Let not the Osiris enter into the dunge on of the captives.” “Let him not fall among thos e who woul d drag him behind the slaught ering block of the executione r” are cries of the Mane s. Amenta is the land of mons ters, chief of which in the mythos is the Apap - dragon, which has its lair in the lake of out er darkness. In Amenta the crocodi les have to be repelled (ch. 31) . Also the serpent Seksek (ch. 35); Apshai, the devour er of the dead (ch. 36); the serpent Rekrek (ch. 39) ; the serpent Haiu (ch. 40) ; the serpent Abur (ch. 42) ;"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"the crocodi le - dragon in the land of bonda ge (ch. 72); the raging bul l (ch. 78) ; the devour ing mons ters (ch. 80) ; the how ling dogs (ch. 102) ; the piercing serpent (ch. 108) ; the black boa r of Sut (ch. 112 ). Baba, the eternal devour er of the conde mned, is the mons ter most eminent in the eschatology. “Deliver me from the crocodi le (or devou ring mons ter) of this land of bonda ge” (Rit., ch. 72) . “Grant that I may com e f orth and have the mastery of my two feet. Let me adva nce to the goa l of heaven.” “Deliver me from Baba, who feeds upon the livers of princes, on the day of the great reckoni ng. ” These are also the cries of the manes. The appe als for divine protection dur i ng the passage of Amenta and for deliverance from the pangs of pur gatory and the terrors of the hells are echoe d in the land of Sheol. “Many bul ls have com passed me. Strong bul ls of Bashan have beset me round. They gape upon me with their mouth” (Ps. XXII. 12, 21) . “Thou hast sore broke n us in the place of jackals, and cove red us with the shadow of death” (Ps. XLIV. 19) . “My soul is among lions . I lie among them that are set on fire” (LVII. 4). “Deliver not the soul of thy turtle unt o the wild beast” (LXXIV . 19) . There is a description in the Ritual of the torn and mutilated Osiris encom passed by the how ling dogs of Amenta. “Salutation to thee, Ur - ar - set, in that voya ge of heaven and the disaster in Tennu, when thos e dogs were gathered toge ther, not without giving voi ce.” The dog is a prom inent type of the devour er in Sheol. The sufferer exclaims, “Deliver my soul from the sword; my onl y one (or my soul ) from the pow er of the dog” (Ps. XXII. 20) . The dog in Amenta represents the devour er “who lives upon the d amned. His face is that of a hound and his skin is that of a man. Eternal devour er is his name” (Rit., ch. 17) . He seizes upon soul s in the dark, and is therefore said to be invi sible, as a type of very great terror. Osiris bound as a mummy in Amenta prays to be released by the god who had tied the cords about him in the earth. That is, by Seb, the god of earth, who was custodi an of the mum mies in the earth, whos e hands and feet were bound up typi cally in Amenta in the likeness of the earthly mum my. The suf ferer in Sheol cries, “My God! Why hast thou forsaken me? All they that see me laugh me to scorn. They shoot out the lip, they wag the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord that he woul d deliver him.” “Thou hast broug ht me into the dus t of death. For dogs h ave encom passed me. The assembly of evil - doe rs have enclosed me. They bound my 481 hands and my feet. They look and stare upon me. They part my garments among them, and upon my vesture do they cast lots.” “Yea, mine ow n familiar friend in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted his heel against me.” “I looke d for som e to take pity, but there was none ; and for com forters, but I found none .” They gave me also “gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. ” These are the pi tiful cries and ejaculations of the suffering Osiris or Horus, the saviour in the Egypt ian wisdom , and these scenes, circum stances, and sayings have been reproduc ed as the very founda tions of the “history” in the Gospels. They were conf essedly found among “the parables and dark sayings of old,” which, as the scribe adm its, “we have heard and know n and our fathers have told us.” That is, they were found in the writings of the divine scribe and psalmist Taht, which were preserved in the psalms of the Hebrew D avid. The matter of the mythol ogy goe s with the mythical characters, and this has been mistaken for prophe cy that was to be fulfilled in some future hum an history."},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":" There is a chapter in the Ritual on not letting the mum my decay — that is, the mum my as a typ e of the persona lity cont inue d in a future life (ch. 154) . In this the mum my - god Osiris is addressed as the father by the Osiris as the manes in Amenta. The speaker says, “Hail to thee, my father Osiris! Thy limbs are lasting, thou dos t not know corrupt ion .” And as with the god so is it with the manes. In spite of death, he says, “I am, I am; I live, I live; I grow , I grow ; and when I awake I shall awake, I shall awake in peace. I shall not see corrupt ion. I shall not be destroye d in my banda ges.” My limbs are lasting for ever. I do not rot. I do not put refy. I do not turn to worms. My flesh is firm; it shall not be destroye d; it shall not perish in the earth for ever.” (Ch. 154, Naville.) In the parallel passages of the Psalms the speaker says, “My heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh shall dw ell in safety (or conf idently). For thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol; neither wilt thou suffer thine hol y one to see corrupt ion. Thou wilt show me the path of life.” As for me, I shall behol d thy face in r ight eous ness. I shall be satisfied with thy likeness when I awake.” (Ps. XVI and XVII.) The “flesh” in the Psalm takes the place of the mum my in the Ritual. The speaker in the Psalms “cries out ” cont inua lly, and calls on the ka or image of the eternal, in the likeness of which he expe cts to rise again and live as Horus or as Jesus the belove d son. Anot her type of the belove d son in Sheol is the turtle - dove . The speaker cries to the god of his salvation, “Oh, deliver not the soul of thy turtle - dove unt o the wild beast. The dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence” (Ps. LXXIV. 19, 20) . The soul of the turtle - dove is the dove that was a sym bol of the soul . When the transformation from the mum my was made in Amenta the deceased became bir d - headed as a soul , and thus assum ed the likeness of Ra the hol y spirit. This bird of soul in the later eschatology was the hawk, the sign of a soul that was cons idered to be male, the soul of god the father. The dove of Hathor was an earlier type of a sou l derived from the mother. This is the turtle - dove of the Psalmist. In one of the Egypt ian drawings the soul is por trayed in the process of issuing from the mum my in the shape of a dove , instead of the usual hawk. 482 Both are emblems of the risen soul , but the dove in monum ental times was almost supe rseded by the hawk of Ra and Horus. In the Ritual snares are set and a net is prepared to catch and destroy the manes. The deceased prays that he may not be taken like a fool ish fish in the net. In the Psalm s the speaker, who is David in the cave, exclaims, “They have prepared a net for my steps” (Ps. LVII). “Pluck me out of the net that they have privily laid for me” (Ps. XXXI. 4). These are the liers in wait (Ps. V. 8) who privily lurk to catch the passing soul s. In vigne ttes to the Ritual the soul s of the ignorant are show n in the gui se of fishes being caught in the net by Cynoc epha li, who are allow ed to capture them because of their ignor ance. The waters of the deep were in Amenta. The deep is identical w ith the pit, the pit with Sheol, and Sheol with Amenta. “Save me, O God; for the waters are com e in unt o my soul . I sink in deep mire, where there is no standi ng. I am com e into deep waters where the floods ove rflow me.” “Deliver me out of the mire, and le t me not sink. Let me be delivered from them that hate me. Let not the water - flood ove rwhelm me, neither let"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"the deep swallow me up. ” In the Psalms the Hebrew deity is he who sitteth on the waters. “The Lord sitteth on the flood; yea, the Lord sitteth as k ing for ever.” “He hath founde d the earth upon the waters and established it upon the floods ” (Ps. XXIV. 2). “Even the Lord upon many waters.” This is the picture of Osiris in Amenta sitting on his throne of the waters as lord of all the earth. The earth i tself is imaged by the lotus rising from the water as the mount arose from out the Nun, and the water springs up and flow s from unde rneath the seat which is the throne of the god. The representation in the great hall of judgm ent is precisely the same as th at described in the book of Revelation: “And he show ed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God” (Rev. XXII. 1). The action of the god throughout nature is imaged as a welling and a flow ing forth of water from its secret sour ce. Ihuh the Lord is described by Jeremiah as “the fount ain of living waters” (XVII. 13). When it is said that the Lord sitteth on the flood (Ps. XXIX. 10, 11) , or that “Ouranos ( OuranÕj ) is the throne of God” (Matt. V. 34, 35) , the imagery is Egypt ian, with certain features defaced. The Ouranos is heaven as the celestial water, upon which the lord has been left sitting without the solar boa t. The lord as Ihuh is one with Atum - Huhi or Ra, who is described as making his voya ge night ly on the Urna s=Ouranos , leaving the trail of otherworld glory in the river of the Milky Way. It is the same solar deity that rode through the deserts of the unde r - world, but again the modus ope randi is om itted. In this way the Egypt ian imagery has been divorced from th e natural phe nom ena which it was intende d to por tray. In the Ritual the waters are described as bur sting forth in an ove rwhelming deluge . “Know ing the deep waters is my name,” exclaims the sinki ng manes (ch. 64) . “Do thou save me!” he cries to the Lord. Th en he exul ts in not being one of thos e who drow n. “Blessed are they that see the bour ne. Beautiful is the god of the motionl ess heart (Asar), who causeth the stay of the ove rflow ing waters. Behol d! there com eth forth the lord of life, Osiris my suppor t, wh o abideth day by day. I embrace the sycamore, I am 483 uni ted to the sycamore.” The tree is a type of stability and safety in Amenta. In Sheol the refuge of the sinki ng soul is depicted amidst the waste of waters as the everlasting rock, but bot h have on e and the same signi ficance as the means of safety from the flood . The mum my sleeping in Amenta as the god or as the manes waits the resurrection there. Horus wakes the manes in their coffins for the com ing forth, when they are freed from the cerements, w hich he rends asunde r. This resurrection is attained in Sheol when the speaker says, “I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast raised me up. Thou hast loos ed my sackcloth and girded me with gladne ss, to the end that my glory (the khu) may sing praise to th ee and not be silent” (Ps. XXX). In the Kamite resurrection there was a change from the earthly body . The bandages of bur ial were cast aside and the sahu mum my was inve sted in the robe of immortality. In fact, to be inve sted thus was to becom e a spiritual being. The “glory,” as one of the Egypt ian seven soul s called the khu , was now attained by the Osiris in the course of his being recons tituted. Salvation for the Egypt ian was being saved from the fate of the irredeemably wicked, the doom of the second deat h, which was anni hilation. Salvation was cont inui ty of life hereafter, and this was onl y attainable by the right eous — thos e who did the right and acted justly, thos e who effected the truth of the word in their ow n life and pur sued it through Amenta. They"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"at tained eternal life by persona l, not by imput ed, right eous ness. Hence the deceased pleads his right eous ness before the lord of right eousness in the great hall of right eous ness. He pleads not what he believes, but what he has done . “I have done that which m aat (the law) prescribeth, and that which pleases the gods . I have propitiated the god with that which he love th. I have given bread to the hungr y, water to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, a boa t to the shipw recked.” “I am one of thos e to whom it is sai d, Com e, com e in peace, by thos e who look upon him” — that is, the divine com pany of the gods . He passes in peace, and is inve sted with the robe of the right eous on account of his ow n right eous ness. This is the doc trine of the Ritual, and it is likewise the doc trine of the Psalms. “Answer me when I call, O God of my righteous ness” (Ps. IV. 1). “Judge me, O Lord, according to my right eous ness and to mine integrity” (Ps. VII. 8. “As for me, I shall behol d thy face in righteous ness” (Ps. XVII. 15) . “The Lord rew ardeth me according to my right eous ness” (Ps. XVIII. 20) . This is not Christian doc trine, but it is Jewish, because it was Egypt ian. Persona l right eousness is pleaded in the Psalms, the same as in the Ritual. “Judge me, O Lord, according to my right eous nes s” (Ps. VII. 8). “The Lord rewarded me according to my right eous ness” (Ps. XVIII. 24). In the Kamite judgm ent hall the speaker says, “I have done the right eous ness of a lord of right eous ness. There is not a limb in me which is void of right eousness” (ch. 1 25) . This, as we interpret the Hebrew version, is the pos ition of the speaker in Sheol who is awaiting judgm ent amidst the trials and the terrors that beset the manes in the caverns of Sut, through which he has to grope his way. On arriving at the judgm ent hall the Osiris says, “Hail to thee, might y god, lord of right eous ness. I am com e to thee, O my Lord; I have brough t myself that I may look upon thy glory.” He pleads in presence of thos e whos e natural 484 prey is the soul s of the wicked, “devour ing tho se who harbour mischief and swallow ing their blood , upon the day of searching examination in presence of the good Osiris. Behol d me; I am com e to you voi d of wrong, without fraud; let me not be declared gui lty; let not the issue be against me. I subs ist up on right eous ness. I sate myself with upr ight ness of heart. I have propitiated the god with that which he love th. I am com e, and am awaiting that inqui sition be made of right eous ness” (ch. 125 ). In the Psalms “God is the judge ” (Ps. VII. 11) . “Right eous ness and judgm ent are the founda tions of his throne ” (Ps. XCVII. 2, XCVIII. 2). “Thou sattest in thy throne judgi ng right eous ly” (Ps., IX, 4). “The Lord sitteth as king for ever. He hath prepared his throne for judgm ent, and he shall judge the world in right eo usness” (Ps. IX. 7, 8). In one form of the mythos Sut and Osiris, in the other Sut and Horus, are bor n twin brothers. Sut becom es the adve rsary of Osiris, the Good Being. This conf lict of the two oppone nt pow ers reappe ars in the Psalms as well as in the b ook of Job. “Yea, mine ow n familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me (Ps. XLI. 9 - 11) . But thou , O Lord, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, that I may requi te them. By this I know that thou delight est i n me, because mine enemy dot h not trium ph ove r me.” “It was thou, a man mine equa l, my com panion and my familiar friend. We took sweet couns el toge ther, we walked in the hous e of God with the throng. ” “He hath put forth his hands against such as were at pe ace with him; he hath profaned his cove nant. His mout h was smoot h as butter, but his heart was war; his words"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords” (Ps. LV. 20, 21). Nothing coul d more aptly reproduc e the figur e of fact as a figur e of speech th an the quot ation from the Psalmist to the effect that he, the intimate friend and very brother, had “lifted his heel against” the Christ, the Lord’s anoi nted. In the dou ble figur e of Horus and Sut they are twinne d toge ther back to back and therefore heel t o heel. David and the adve rsary are equi valent to Osiris and Sut, or to Horus and Sut in anot her pha se of the mythos , the twin brothers being characters in bot h. When Sut and the Sebau had com passed the death of Osiris, a day of dissolution follow ed the g reat disaster. There was an ove rthrow al of the pillars — the tat - pillar at the centre of all, and the four suppor ts at the four corners. Then Horus came as the avenge r of his father and as the judge of the wicked, who after trial were anni hilated on the high ways of the damned. The tat was re - erected, and the four pillars (pos ts or flagstaffs) were set up onc e more “on the night of setting up the pillars of Horus and of establishing him as heir of his father’s prope rty.” This was at the time when Horus, as Har - Tema, came to judge the adve rsaries of his father Osiris (Rit., ch. 18). A fragm ent from this woul d seem to have strayed into the 75t h Psalm, like many other wande ring words that have lost their senses. “When I shall find the set time, I will judge upr igh tly. The earth and all the inha bitants thereof are dissolved. I have set up the pillars of it” — which looks as if the Osiris deceased in Sheol were speaking in the character of Horus who re - erected the pillars. In the Ritual the dissolution and re - establish ing of the earth by setting up 485 the pillars, immediately follow s the battle with the Sebau, the Apap, and Sut; and in the preceding psalm (LXXIV) the war with the dragon is described. “Thou breakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.” “Thou break est the heads of leviathan in pieces; thou gavest him to be meat to the peopl e inha biting the wilderness.” The dragons in the psalm are the evil crocodi les in the Ritual. A profound study of the Ritual reveals the fact that the wisdom of Egyp t was the sou rce and fount ain - head of the books of wisdom assigne d to Moses and David, to Solom on and Jesus; and also prove s the persona ges or characters to have been Egypt ian. It is chiefly the wisdom of Egypt that gives a value to the Hebrew writings , as will be indu bitably demons trated. In Psalm XXIV there is a glorification of the com ing king of glory: 7. Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; And the King of Glory shall come in. 8. Who is the King of Glory? The Lord strong and mi ghty, The Lord mighty in battle. 9. Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And the King of Glory shall come in. 10. Who is the King of Glory? The Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory. "},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"This king of glory was the sun - god in the astronom ical mythol ogy. The Heb rew repeats the king of glory, the gates, and the door s, but om its the astronom ical founda tion; and in this way the wisdom of Taht was deprived of its scientific value. But who is this king of glory? and what are the gates that are called upon to ope n and let him in? As the “Lord of hos ts” we know him for Iao - Sabaoth, lord of the seven great spirits; therefore he is the solar god; but we must turn to the Ritual to unde rstand the nature of the gates. There are thirty - six altoge ther, correspondi ng to the thir ty - six decans of the zodi ac. At the same time the gates are thirty - six door s in the great hous e of Osiris. Chapter 145 is devot ed to the passage of the sun - god through twenty - one of these celestial gates. The sun - god is the king of glory in the Ritual. In “the book that was made on the birthda y of Osiris,” in which “glory is given to the invi olate one ,” Taht, the Kamite psalmist, sings , “Opened be the gates of heaven! Opened be the gates of earth! Opened be the gates of the east! Opened be the gates of the west! Opened be the gates of the sout hern and of the northern sanctuaries! Opened be the gates and throw n wide ope n be the por tals as Ra ariseth from the mount of glory, the swift of speed and beautiful in his rising, and almight y through what he hath done .” “Glory to thee, O Ra, lord of the mount of glory.” (Rit., ch. 129. ) The gates and door s are thos e that ope n as the solar god com es forth at dawn. He is the king of glory; these are the gates of glory that were ope ned on the mount of glory “at the beauti ful com ing forth of his pow ers.” “It is the gate and the two door s and ope nings through which Father Atum issueth on the eastern hor izon (or mount ) of heaven.” (Rit., ch. 17. ) That is Atum - Huhi =Ihuh. The mythol ogy is abso - 486 lutely necessary all throug h for us to unde rstand the eschatology, whether in its Egypt ian gui se or Hebrew disgui se. When the Psalmist says, “The Lord is my shephe rd,” it has becom e a mere phr ase. The Egypt ians presented the portrait. Horus was the lord as leader of the flock and g uardian of the fold, because he represented the first who rose again from the dead, though not at any particular historic date. Amsu - Horus, with his crook in hand, shephe rded the flocks of Ra beyond the grave. After the resurrection in Amenta he says to hi s first four follow ers, who are called his children, “Now let my fold be fitted for me as one victorious against all thos e adve rsaries who woul d not that the right shoul d be done to me, the onl y one ” (Rit., ch. 97) . He is the “master of the champaign” and “of the inunda tion, ” and therefore of the green pastures and the still waters of life. Horus, the son of god, came into the world as shephe rd of his father’s sheep, to lead them through the darkne ss of Amenta to the green pastures and still waters of the f inal paradise upon Mount Hetep in the heaven of eternity. It was not suppos ed that he came to secure the Jew his cent. per cent., or the Christian capitalist the pow er to rob the workers of the fruits of their labour , or the Boers and Belgians to eat up th e abor igines and lie dow n as loafers in the still pastures of their stolen lands . Psalm XXIII cont ains a description of the green fields of pasture and the still waters that run through that paradise of plenty, peace, and rest: The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul:"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":" He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of de ath (A menta or Sheol), I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: And I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. The staff of Amsu was a sym bol of Osiris who rose again as Horus. It was bur ied with the deceased, and is found in the oldest coffins together with other weapons that were interred with the dead as type s of a protecting pow er. “The Osiris receiveth the Amsu staff wherewith he goe th round the heaven” (Rit., ch. 130) . This elsewhere is called the palm of Amsu. It was the suppor t of the Osiris in life and in d eath. This psalm is one of thos e that have been least denude d of the original obj ect - pictures. The valley of the shadow of death is the Ar - en - Tet or valley of the dead in the Ritual, where thos e who suffer the second death are bur ied for ever (Rit., ch. 19 ) by the great anni hilator Seb. Horus in one character is the good shephe rd, but the lord, as leader in the green pastures, is the bul l of the seven cow s, who are the provi ders of plenty. He is called the lord of the pastures, or fields of the bul l, the gr een meadow s of Aarru. He also says, “I am the bul l, the lord of the gods .” This answers to “The Lord is my shephe rd; I shall not want. “He maketh me to lie dow n in green pastures,” says the Psalmist. The speaker in the Ritual says, “I take my rest in the d ivine dom ain.” “I sail upon its stream, and I range 487 within its garden of peace.” The speaker sings for joy, it may be, in the Psalms of Taht. He exclaims, “I utter my praise to the gods who are in the garden of peace.” The “still waters” are in Hebre w the “waters of rest”; these, in the Egyp tian, are the waters of Hetep= the waters of rest and peace. The departed rests beside these waters in the green fields where Hetep, as the god of peace, is “put ting toge ther the obl ations ” for the spirits of the j ust made perfect. “Thou preparest a table before me,” says the Psalmist. The table likewise was prepared upon Mount Hetep, and piled with heaps of imperishable food . Hence the Osiris says, “I rest at the table of my father Osiris” (Rit., ch. 70) . Mount Het ep was itself the tableland of the obl ations . The “hous e of the lord” is designa ted by the speaker in the Ritual “the mansion where food is produc ed for me,” the mansion that was lifted up by Shu, the paradise of Am - Khemen. Two paths led up to it, called t he “doubl e path.” These are the “paths of right eous ness.” The deceased in the Ritual is seen ascendi ng the mount with the suppor ting rod or staff in his hand. Where the Psalmist says, “He restoreth my soul ,” the speaker in the Ritual says rejoicingl y, “My soul is with me.” This in Egyp tian is the ka, that was ultimately attained in the garden of peace. The ka is the final form of the soul restored to the departed when they are perfected in the assembly or congr egation on the mount . The speaker in Hetep says , “There is given to me the abunda nce which belonge th to the ka and to the glorified.” It was in Amenta that the lord’s anoi nted was begot ten: one mode was by the transformation of Horus the mortal into Horus the belove d son. In the Hebrew Psalms the same transaction is repeated in the place of the “wicked” who rebel and rage against the Lord and his anoi nted. The son begot ten by the father is born to becom e the ruler ove r them, and to effect the trium ph of the father ove r all his adve rsaries on the day of judgm ent, the same as in the Ritual (ch."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"1). The Lord himself that sitteth in the heavens “shall have them in derision, ” yea, he has also set the son as king upon the hol y hill of Zion, the mount ain of the Lord. Here it may be remarked that the change from Horus the hum an yout h with the side - lock to Horus the divine avenge r woul d lend itself to the euhe merists for the conve rsion of David the shephe rd boy into the solar hero who made war upon the giant and slew the Philistines. The Jews, we are told, believ e in a twofold kind of immortality, the one being in a state immediately follow ing death, the other in the resurrection from Sheol at the judgm ent - day. These two aspects of cont inuity after death are to be expl ained by the Egypt ian eschatology. The Hebrew Sheol is the Egypt ian secret earth of eternity, the divine nether - world. In death the manes passed into the Amenta as a body - soul that survived the body and became a ghos t or shade with pow er to reappe ar as an appa rition on the earth. After passing through pur gatory and all the other places and mode s of pur ification, and making the necessary transformations as an Osiris, or hum an Horus, the manes rose from Amenta to the paradise of spirits perfected in the likeness of Horus the divine. The immortality that was previous ly pot ential for the hum an Horus or manes was established in Tattu and assured by the resurrection of the glorified spirit 488 from the Akar (Rit., 30, A ). The manes in the Ritual says of himself, “After being bur ied on earth I am not dead in Amenta.” He is there “reuni ted to the earth on the western side of heaven,” to becom e a “pur e spirit for eternity” (ch. 30, A ). This is the original doc trine of a body , soul , and spirit — a body on earth, a manes soul in Sheol, and an immortal spirit in the resurrection on high. Horus was incarnated in the hum an body on earth. He died and rose again in Amenta as a sahu or soul in a rarer but corporeal form. This was a resurrection from the first death. Then he made his transformation into Horus the pur e spir it, and ascende d to his father in heaven, hawk - headed or dove - headed, from the mount of Amenta or the doubl e earth. These things were visibly portrayed upon the walls and in the papyri of Egyp t, not to be lost sight of there; but , away from Egypt , the pict ures were no longe r present, and the Jews lost their living memory of Amenta. They had onl y words, without the means of verification in the representative signs which had given a palpable reality to the most ancient mysteries in the chambers of Egypt ian im agery; and gradua lly Sheol dw indled to the dimensions of the grave, as we find it cont inue d in the Old Testament. In the mythol ogy the messianic resurrection from Sheol was the annua l re - arising of the Horus - sun at Easter. In the eschatology it was the res urrection of Horus divinized as son of Ra the holy spirit who ascende d with his follow ers to the fields of peace in the uppe r paradise of the celestial Aarru. And just as the colour s in Egypt ian tom bs remain at times as fresh as if the paint had never drie d, so do the pictures and por traits survive in the mythol ogy and eschatology, unf ading in colour and imperishable in form, after they had grown dim and dead for the Hebrews and Greeks, to be count erfeited as historic for the Christians, who had no means of detecting the impos ition by any reference to the prototype s, that are as living to - day as the hue s in which the imagery was painted by Egypt ian scribes, whos e drawing was a means of bringi ng on and on the most ancient wisdom dow n from the days of gesture - langua ge, when there was as yet no pos sible registry in words, to the time of the Egypt o - gnos tics."},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":" There is plenty of proof that the same funda mental matter belongi ng to the wisdom of Egyp t, in which Osarsiph of On was an adept, appe ars thrice ove r in the Hebrew writings . It is mythol ogi cal in the books of Genesis, Exodus , and Joshua . It is eschatologi cal in the Psalms. And in the later book s it is conve rted into matter of prophe cy. All three pha ses were Egypt ian. With this difference: the sole pos sible fu lfilment of prophe cy was astronom ical, not hum anly historical. To illustrate two of these pha ses: the land of bonda ge in the book of Exodus is the Amenta of the solar drama, the low er Egypt of the doubl e earth, the scene of the never - ceasing battles betwee n the pow ers of light and darkne ss, the sun - god and the Sebau, Ra and the dragon, or Horus and Sut; Amenta in the mythol ogy becom es Sheol in the Hebrew eschatology. The land of bonda ge, then, is the place of suffering soul s that seek deliverance from the d esert of darkne ss, the prison - hous e of death and hell. It is the sufferer in Sheol, the Osiris of the Ritual, who says, “Thou wilt not leave my soul in Sheol; neither wilt thou suffer thy belove d to see 489 corrupt ion. Thou wilt show me the path of life” (Ps. XVI. 10, 11) . “That thy belove d may be delivered, save with thy right hand and answer us” (Ps. LX. 5). There is the same assimilation of the manes to the suffering Horus, or Osiris, as in the Ritual. There is also the same mixture of the mythical and eschatologi cal. This is especially marked in the 18t h Psalm, which pur por ts to cont ain the words that were spoke n by David on the day the Lord delivered him from all his enemies. According to the Egypt ian wisdom , whoe ver the speaker may be in the Hebrew Sheol, it is the suffering Osiris or the Osiris in Amenta; and the god appe aled to by him in his troub le is the god who was Ra the father in heaven as Atum - Huhi in the Egypt ian and Ihuh in the Jewish cult. Also it is the solar god alone that will account f or the imagery. Not onl y are the ground - plan and total scheme Egypt ian, the mythology and eschatology can be follow ed in innum erable details. It looks at times as if the scribes were directly citing the earlier scriptures, from which the mythos is quot ed a nd conve rted into prophe cies, chiefly conc erning the com ing judge and avenge r, who in the Egypt ian original is the avenge r of Osiris - Un - Nefer, and his follow ers, the chos en peopl e, or the glorified elect, who suffer in Amenta from the persecution of Sut an d the Sebau, his co - workers in iniqui ty. Let the 34t h and the 35t h chapters of Isaiah be com pared with the Hym n to Osiris. (There are two versions of this hym n in the Records of the Past, first series, vol . IV, and 2nd series, vol . IV, that by Mallet bein g much the closer rende ring.) “Seek ye out the book of the Lord and read,” exclaims Isaiah in his description of the com ing one . The day of venge ance for long - suffering had obvi ous ly been foretold in this book. And at the adve nt of the Lord who was to brin g deliverance to his peopl e, it is said, “The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad, and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.” “They shall see the glory of the Lord, the excellency of our God. ” “Behol d, your God will com e with venge a nce: he will com e and save you.

And it is this com ing of Messiah as Horus the prince of peace on earth and the avenge r who makes Osiris trium pha nt ove r his adve rsaries in Amenta or Sheol that is described in the Hym n to Osiris. When he has gone forth in peace by the com mand of Seb (that is, as the hum an Horus bor n of Seb, god of ea rth), the divine com pany of the gods ador e him, the inha bitants of the Tuat prostrate themselves to the ground, the loftiest bow the head, the ancestral spirits are in prayer.

The great prince, eldest of his brothers, the chiefs of the divine com panies, who establishe s the truth in the doubl e land, who seats the son (himself) upon the throne of his father, the favour ite of his father Seb, the belove d of his mother Nut (heaven, one of whos e names is Meri).

Seb cont emplates his benefits (the benefits of his adve nt to the earth); he has ordered him to gove rn all count ries to assure their prosperity. . . . The desert carries its tribut e to the son of Nut; Egypt is happy when it sees him appe ar upon his father’s throne . The au thor of evil (Sut) pronounc es magical words and displays his pow er in his turn, but the son of Isis makes his way to him and avenge s his father, sanctifying and honour ing his name. The paths are cleared, the roads are ope ned, evil flees away. He has caused the author ity of his father to be recogni zed in the great dw elling of Seb — that is, of earth. In this abstract the adve nt of Horus, which was annua l in Egypt , whence he was the king of one year, is hym ned in various pha ses of his pre - Christian character. H e com es by order of Seb, the foster - father on earth, as his favou rite of the brothers, who were five in num ber when Horus is count ed as one . He com es in peace, but also brings the sword as a terror to the workers of iniqui ty and as the immolator of his adv ersary Sut. He com es also as Horus of the inunda tion; and thus the desert is made to blossom , and to carry its tribut e to the son of Nut, who has conque red Sut, the cause of drough t and sterility, in his cont est with the devil in the wilderness in which Ho rus vanqui shes his adve rsary and avenge s his father. Again, the follow ing might have been designa ted a song of Har - Tema, who is Horus the fulfiller at his second adve nt. “The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord hath anoi nted me to preach good tidings unt o the poo r.

LXI. 1, 2). Horus in his second adve nt came hawk - headed in the likeness of Ra as the anoi nted and belove d son. The divine hawk was his sign that the spirit of the Lord was upon him. He brought good tidings for the poor"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"and com fort for the opp ressed. He is Horus the compassiona te. One of his titles is “the Com forter.” In one passage of the Ritual he says, “I have been produc ed to repul se the evil pow ers” — literally thos e who grove l on their bellies. “I com e as the forerunne r or messenge r of the Lord, as c ounc illor of Osiris.” He goe s forth from the state of the disk to bring light and liberty to the manes who are darkling in their prison cells. He solaces thos e that mour n, he wipes away the tears from those who weep, and ope ns the eyes of thos e who are bre athless, bound, and blind. At the same time he was the stern avenge r of injustice. The judgm ent day and dread assize were annua l, in accordance with the 491 natural fact, and there was a time of terrible venge ance onc e a year. The “acceptable year of th e Lord” was based upon this judgm ent and readjustment, the setting of the captives free and puni shing the gui lty onc e a year; and bot h the first and second adve nts of Horus were of annua l occurrence in the year of “the Lord’s good pleasure.” The funda ment al doc trines and the imagery of the book of Job are also Egypt ian.

The pyr amid tom bs (III. 14) . Leviathan, the crocodi le - dragon (XLI. 1), and the repha im beneath the waters. These are one and all Egypt ian. That which is non - hum an as matter of the mythos becom es inhum an when retailed as history, and it is inhum an in the one pha se because it was not hum an in the other. This criterion is infallible. For example, the persecution of Job by Satan the adve rsary repeats the treatment of the good Osiris by the evil Sut. This of itself suffices to show that the drama was non - hum an in its oldest form. The Osirian drama unfolded in the mysteries of Amenta likewise furnished matter for the book of Job. The land of darkne ss described as Sheol by Job is one with Amenta in its secret uni llumined parts. It is the land of darkne ss and the shadow of death, a land of thick darkne ss, as darkne ss itself, a land of the shadow of death (Job X. 21, 22). This is the Ar - en - Tet of the Ritual (ch. 19), the valley of darkne ss and death, whos e unm itigable gloom conc eals the secrets that are absolutely unknow able, and where tho se who died the second death were bur ied for ever in their mum mied immobi lity. This is the condi tion threatened in the book of Job (XLIX. 19) for the wicked: “He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see the light .” This region of imp enetrable darkne ss becom es the whol e of Sheol, or Sualu, in this version of Amenta. Sheol is especially described as the land of shade, which sugge sts a Kamite origin for the name. As Egypt ian, the root - word “shu” signi fies shade, shadow , to be destitute, dark, voi d. Thence, the voi d, the hol low , the land of shade, is the land of Shua l or Sheol as a Semitic place - name.

Funda mentally Egypt ian, it has been re - adapted without the wisdom of Egypt . All has been change d by making the sufferer Job a human persona ge on this earth; and when we know the true nature of mythical characters l ike thos e of Job or Samson, David or Jona h, or Jack the Giant Killer, it lessens the interest we might otherwise take in them as hum an heroes. We must resort to the original. The drama of Job and Satan cont ains a euhe merized version of the 492 ancient co nflict betwixt the prince of darkne ss, Sut, and Osiris or Horus, who suffers from the adve rsary in Amenta. The Hebrew Satan was the Egypt ian Sut, who became the evil one of the later theology as an anthropom orphic rende ring of Apap the serpent of evil. Sut was one of the seven sons of the old First Mother, the godde ss of the Great Bear in the astronom ical mythol ogy. He was not one of “the sons of god, ” as there was no god extant when he was bor n. Sut was brought forth twin with Horus, and first born as the adve rsary of his brother Osiris. In a truer version of the mythos the conf lict was in phe nom ena that were phys ical, not moral. There are no morals in mythol ogy , when the characters are non - hum an, and when the mythical heroes and mons ters have been represen ted as hum an characters we need to know the mythol ogy onc e more. The Bible is full of such characters, and Job is one of them. In the Ritual Sut is the adve rsary of Osiris, or, still earlier, the oppone nt of Horus. He undoe s what the Good Being doe s. He is a malicious destroye r; the author of disease. He is permitted to persecute Horus and Osiris to the death. In his character of the adve rsary, the pow er of darkne ss, he says, “I am Sut, who causeth the storms and tempests, and who goe th round the hor izon of heaven, like one whos e heart is veiled” (Rit., ch. 39) . Which is equi valent to saying, “I am black - hearted.” Sut is here the prototype of Satan, who “goe s to and fro in the earth,” and of whom it is elsewhere said, “Your adve rsary the devil walketh about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour ” (I Peter V. 8). So Satan the destroye r plays the devil with the person, the pos session s, the belongi ngs of Job, who answers to the suffering Osiris in this developm ent of the ancient drama, in which Horus or Jo b was no more a hum an persona ge than is Sut or Satan. They can be studi ed in the Ritual without disgui se or falsification of character, and without a long series of disput ations , lamentations , and sermons taking the place of the primitive mystery. The “par able” taken up by Job is the battle of Sut and Osiris in the mythical representation. Job the afflicted one is the suffering Osiris who passed into Amenta as the victim of the pow er of darkne ss, Sut the tormentor, the tempter, the desolator, the destroye r. Amongs t other devilries, Sut flung his ordur e at Horus (Rit., ch. 17); he also pierced him in the eye; but , where Osiris suffered dum bly and ope ned not his mout h, Job laments his lot, and takes to cursing the day of his birth and wishing that he had been addl ed in the egg. The character of Job is fathom lessly inferior to that of the good Osiris, called the motionl ess of heart. The suffering Horus transforms in “the west” and becom es the bennu Osiris or the phœ nix. Job doe s the same, or expe cts to do so, w hen he says, “I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the phœ nix.” The phœ nix was the emblem of the solar god who died to resuscitate in the nest of Amenta. He enters the nest as a hawk and issues forth as a phœ nix (Rit., 13, 1).

This is pue rilely represented b y the Lord restoring to Job twofold of all he had before and ove rwhelming him with material wealth. 493 The drama in the mysteries of Amenta was a stupe ndous representation, true to nature; but when the chief character has been turned into a hum an perso nage cove red with put refying sores, when the adve rsary is made equa lly persona l, and the Lord com missions the Devil to try to torment and to tempt this poor hum an sufferer becaus e he was a perfectly just, good, and upr ight man, the drama becom es a stupe ndo us misrepresentation not onl y of divine justice, but of the original setting forth and rende ring of the mythos . The name of Job is com monl y taken to signi fy “the assailed one ,” which perfectly describes the type of the suffering Osiris. He is the assailed one , and Sut is the assailant. How the good Osiris was assailed by the evil Sut and his Sami, the Apap - dragon and the Sebau, may be seen through all the mysteries of Amenta or of Sheol. Sut the prototypa l adve rsary is the evil one personi fied in Amenta as oppone nt of the deliverer Horus; he is the keeper of the prison - hous e for death, to which Horus com es as lord of life and liberty. The speaker in the Ritual cries to Ra, “O deliver me from the god who seizes soul s. The darkne ss in which Sekari dw ells is t errifying to the weak.” This god is Sut (the Hebrew Satan), and darkne ss is the breath of his dom ain. In this darkne ss the Osiris suffers, suppl icating Ra for light. Job sitting in the ashes, cove red with boi ls from head to foot , and scraping himself with a potsherd, is a gross phys ical rende ring of the manes in Amenta, who is scraped to get rid of the impur ities and unc leanne sses with which the soul from this world finds itself afflicted in the other life. The que rulous , com plaining Job is but a poor por tr ait of the speaker in the Ritual, and the Egypt ian wisdom has to be restored before the genesis of the drama can be unde rstood. Osiris was the great god in matter as sour ce or well - spring of life. He rested as the perfect one in Amenta, without sign of br eath or beat of heart, but as the fount of motion and the fulfiller of existence in the nether earth, where he suffered in his death and bur ial, though not directly. Deity coul d not die nor suffer in itself; and this part of the character was represented b y the human Horus. He was the sufferer in various natural phe nom ena; and being por trayed in hum an gui se as the mortal, this led the way to the later euhe merizing of the mythical representations and the reproduc ing of the drama as hum an history. It was the hum an Horus who was pierced and tortured by Sut in death when it was his time to trium ph and he became the king and conque ror in his turn. The suffering Horus onl y conque red Sut when he transformed and became the god in his turn and made his resurrection f rom Amenta. Job is this fearfully afflicted Horus or Osiris, suffering every evil that coul d be let loos e on him by his adve rsary. But the scene is in Sheol, not on earth. Job is the “servant,” like the suffering Messiah described by Isaiah, and like the h um an Horus, who was maimed and deformed, dumb and blind, as An - ar - ef in the land of darkne ss. When Job “takes up his parable” he is the sufferer in Amenta, the Hebrew Sheol. He goe s blackened where there is no sun.

He is cast into the mire of the pit. He exclaims, “Why do ye persecute me as a god, and are not satisfied with my flesh? And after my skin hath been thus destroye d, out of 494 my flesh shall I see God” (Job XIX. 22, 26). A skin for the body is an expr ession peculiarly Egypt ian. The god who is called the divine soul in the Ritual (ch. 165 , A ) is addr essed as the “conc ealer of skins” — that is, a hi der of the body of thos e who rise again transformed in the divine likeness of a soul eternalized. In the judgm ent scenes a second skin= a second body is the sign of re - embodi ment after death, as a sahu or divine mummy. That is the shape in which Amsu - Horus rises from the tom b as vindi cator and avenge r of Osiris and the bur ied dead, the naked who becom e the clothed in the new body . In the case of Job it seems that the Lord has taken the skin or body of flesh, but is not satisfied. Job is a manes in Sheol. Nev ertheless his resurrection from the pit is assured. Hence his exclamation, “I know that my vindi cator liveth, and that he shall stand up at the last upon the earth. And after my skin hath been thus destroyed, yet from (or without ) my flesh shall I see God” — for himself, and not vicarious ly by means of anot her (Job XIX. 25 - 27) . There is an impos ing picture in the book of Job (XXVI) which is purely Egypt ian. “The dead tremble beneath the waters, and the inha bitants thereof in the presence of the deity. Sheol is naked before him, and Abaddon hath no cove ring. He stretcheth out the north ove r empty space and hangeth the earth upon not hing. He binde th up the waters in his thick clouds , and the cloud is not rent unde r them. He closeth in the face of his throne and spreadeth his cloud upon it. He hath described a bounda ry upon the face of the waters unt o the conf ines of light and darkne ss. The pillars of heaven tremble and are astoni shed at his rebuke . He stilleth the sea by his pow er, and by his unde rstandi ng he sm iteth Rahab. By his spirit the heavens are established. His hand hath pierced the fleeing serpent.” The stretcher of heaven for cove ring was Atum - Iu (or Ra) when he attained the solar sove reignt y. He is addr essed in this character by the manes, who is in d read of the deluge : “O thou great cove rer of heaven, in thy name of stretcher (of the sky) grant that I may have pow er ove r the water and not be drow ned” (Rit., 57) . The heaven thus stretched ove rhead was represented as water, hence the greatness of the po wer that held it aloft in safety. The deceased beneath the waters are the manes in Amenta, where the waters are an image of the low er Nun, the sky as water below the hor izon. Abaddon or destruction lurked below in the shape of the Apap - reptile, the destroy er, the great serpent in the waters of darkne ss, who was pierced and smitten through and through when he rose up in rebellion against Ra or Horus or Atum - Iu= Iahu. Atum - Iu the Lord, whom we shall identify with Ihuh, was the architect who finished the bui ldi ng of the heavens; and in the book of Job it is Ihuh the Lord who claims to have laid the founda tions of the earth and says, “Declare, if thou hast unde rstandi ng, who determined the measures thereof, or who stretched the line upon it. Whereupon were the fo unda tions thereof fastened, or who laid the corner - stone thereof when the morning stars sang and all the sons of God shout ed for joy? ” (Job XXXVIII. 4, 7.)

T he first and foremost of these was Behemoth, the hippopot amus of Sut (and his mother), who is described here as “the chief of the ways of god .” His fellow was the crocodi le of Sebek - Horus, which is here called Leviathan. The founda tions of the heavens were certainly laid in or by the bear and her seven sons , the first two of which were the twins Sut and Horus, the hippopot amus and the crocodi le; and it is equa lly certain that these founda tions were laid in the Egypt ian astronom y. This will show that the wri ter is employi ng the Egypt ian wisdom , and therefore it may be that he refers to the course of precession, albeit vague ly, in the follow ing allusion: “Hast thou com mande d the morning since thy days began, and caused the day spring to know its place, that it might take hol d of the ends of the earth?” which looks like the equi nox upon its travels, although treated as the “morning” and the visiting “dayspring” from on high that makes its all - embracing circuit in the great year of the world. When Job “took up hi s parable” he found it in the Book of the Dead, and is himself the speaker as the manes in Amenta, where we obt ain foot hol d onc e more in the phe nom ena of nature, which were represented sanely and scientifically by the Egypt ian sages, who laid the ground so that the eschatologi cal rende ring coul d follow the earlier mythos . Names have been om itted, the prototypa l figur es effaced, wisdom turned into ignor ance, and the remains of Egypt ian mythology and eschatology have been foisted on the world as an original r evelation given in the Hebrew tongue ; whereas the funda mental subj ect - matter of the sacred writings and the very God himself who is suppos ed to have revealed the truth in them are non - original as biblical, and onl y recogni zable as Egypt ian. The prayer of J ona h in the belly of the fish show s him to be anot her form of the Afflicted One who is for three days and three night s in the low ermost depths at the time of the winter solstice. In this legend the belly of the fish is identical with the belly of Sheol, th e wom b of the unde r - world. In the ancient fragm ent quot ed in the second chapter Jona h says, “I called out of mine affliction unt o the Lord, and he answered me; out of the belly of She ol cried I; thou heardest my voi ce. For thou didst cast me into the depth , in the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me; all thy waves and thy billow s passed ove r me. And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes; yet I will look again tow ards thy hol y temple ( i.e., on the mount ). The waters com passed me about , even to the soul . The deep was round about me; the weeds were wrappe d about my head. I went dow n to the bot tom s of the mount ains; earth with her bars (closed) upon me for ever; yet thou hast brought up my life from the pit, O Lord my God. ” There is not hin g whatever about the fish in this fragm ent. On the cont rary, the speaker is in the belly of Sheol, which is the Kamite Amenta. In this nether - world he is at the root s of the mount of earth which stands in the waters of the abyss. The wom b of Sheol might be represented as it was by the water - cow or a great fish. A great fish in the form of a crocodi le was one of the type s of the ancient mother who brough t forth Sebek - Horus from the Nun as her young crocodi le, just as she 496"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":" brought forth Sut as her young hippopot amus. The sufferer in Sheol is the same here as in the Psalms and the book of Job, and bot h are identical with the suffering Osiris in the mysteries of Amenta. We have now to take a backward look in the cour se of establishing the links between the Egypt ian wisdom and the Hebrew writings . Religion in Egyp t first began in worship or propi tiation of the primal provi dence that was figured as the Great Mother who brought forth the seven elemental pow ers called her children. These pow ers in Egyp t were th e seven Ali. In Phœ nicia they are the seven Elohi m, in Assyria they are seven forms of the Ili, and in Israel the seven Elohi m, Kabirim, or Baalim. Sut was one of these, and Sut upon his mount ain at the pol e became El - Shadda i in his Hebrew form of Seth. Th e com pany of seven (with the Great Mother) passed into the astronom ical mythol ogy as the seven great spirits which were divinized as star gods with Anup , a form of Sut, at the pol e. Unde r the figur e of Israel, the abandone d female, later writers in the Old Testament denounc e the pre - monoga mous Great Mother as the harlot of prom iscuous sexua l intercour se. Jeremiah rejoices furious ly because “she that hath bor ne seven langui sheth,” ashamed and conf ounde d, and “hath given up the ghos t” (XV. 9). When the one go d had been “lifted up” as Ra in the solar mythos and Huhi the eternal in the eschatology by bot h the Egypt ians and the Jews, or by the Egypt ian Jews, the previous divinities called the ancestors of Ra were supe rseded, or their pow ers were absorbed in or bl ende d with the one great pow er, who was now the all - one as Neb - er - ter. “When the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord” (Ihuh) , and served the Baalim and Ashtoreth (Judge s II. 11, 14) , they were returning to the worship of th e most ancient Great Mother and her sons the Ali, the com panions , the brothers in the first circle of the gods ; the Baalim being one with the Elohi m and the Kabirim. “Return (says Ihuh) , O backsliding children (the two sisters Juda h and Israel), for I am a hus band to you” (Jer. III. 14) . This backsliding, how ever, was itself a return to Israel’s earlier love — “Israel,” that is, as a part of the “com mon, dim popul ations ” of Syria, Phœ nicia or Canaan, and Palestine. The change from Baal to Ihuh is indi cated by Hosea (II. 16, also by Jeremiah III) when it is said to Israel, “And it shall be at that day, saith the Lord, thou shalt call me ‘my hus band, ’ and thou shalt call me no longe r Baal. For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mout h, and they s hall no more be memorialized by name.” The Baalim, like the Elohi m and Âbirim, were the Ali, com panion gods or pow ers, that were originally a group of seven, to whom El or Baal was adde d as the eight h or highe st God. They existed in the time of the totemic matriarchate before the hus band or the father coul d be know n persona lly, whether as hum an or divine. In this passage the deity becom es monoga mous , and Israel, as a feminine equi valent for the suppr essed godde ss, is to be his wife. The langua ge of the “pro phe ts” conc erning the whor edom of Israel cannot be com prehende d apart from the status of the wom an in com muna l connubi um . The whor e of later langua ge is the representative of the totemic wom an, who might coha bit with seven or any other appoi nted num ber of cons orts. The harlot in mythology was the Great Mother, 497 "},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"whos e ow n children were her cons orts in the beginning. When the fatherhood was divinized the god became the hus band, the one instead of the seven or eight , who were the Ali, Illi, Elohi m, Âberim , or Baalim. Israel had cons orted with the Baalim, and therefore coha bited prom iscuous ly. And after the one god was made know n to her as a father and a hus band, she still went a - whor ing after the earlier gods . Hence the denunc iations of Israel as the whore who woul d not truly play the part of wife. Hebraists have surmised, and som e Hebrews (kno wn to the writer) have adm itted, that the prefix B in B’Jah (B’Jah is Jehovah, Is. XXVI. 4, and B’ Jah is his name) is an abbr eviation for the name of Baal. If writt en out fully this woul d read, Baal - Iah= Baal is Jah. Bealiah is a prope r name in the book of Chroni cles I. XII. 5, in which we see that Baal - Iah as divinity suppl ied a persona l name. Thus the Baal who is Iah Hy woul d be the Iah who was one of the Baalim; an d the earliest Baalim were a form of the seven com panions , like the Kabarim and Elohi m, which are follow ed in the book of Genesis by the god named Iahu - Elohi m. The one god in Israel is made know n to Moses by the two names of hvh y and Hy , Ihuh and Iah. Now a priest of On (Osarsiph) woul d naturally learn at On of the one - god Atum - Ra, who was Huhi the eternal in the character of God the father and Iu in the character of God the son, which two were one . In accordance with Egypt ian though t, that which was for ev er was the onl y true reality. This was represented by Huhi the eternal. And Huhi is the god made know n to Israel by the priest of On. Gesenius derives the name of Ihuh from a root huh, which root doe s not exist in Hebrew. But it doe s exist in Egypt ian. Huh or heh signi fies ever, everlastingne ss, eternity, the eternal. Huhi was a title that was appl ied to Ptah, Atum - Ra, and Osiris, as Neb - Huhi the everlasting lord, or as the supr eme one, self - existing, and eternal god, which each of these three deities repre sented in turn as one divine dyna sty succeeded anot her in the Egypt ian religion. An eternity of existence was imaged by the Egypt ians as ever - com ing or becom ing; hence ever - com ing or ever - becom ing was a mode of imaging the eternal being. Thus the one god a s their Huhi was not onl y he who is for ever as the father, but also he who com es for ever as the son. This visible mode of cont inui ty by means of com ing naturally invol ved becom ing, according to the Egyp tian doc trine of khe per, which include s ever - evol vin g, ever - transforming, ever - perpetuating, ever - becom ing, unde r the one word khe per. Thus the name of an eternal, self - existent being which is hvh y in Hebrew can be traced as Huhi , the name for the one eternal, ever - living, ever - lasting god as Egypt ian. And now for the first time we can distingui sh the one name, hvh y from the other Hy , if onl y on Egypt ian groun d. “Iu,” with variants in Au, Iau, Aui, and others, is also an Egypt ian word, but with no lingui stic relations hip to the word Huh. Iu is likewise the n ame of an Egypt ian god, as Iu - em - hetep, he who com es with peace, who was primarily the son of Ptah, and who was repeated in the cult of Atum - Ra as Nefer - Atum . In fact, Atum - Ra is bot h Huhi and Iu as the one god living in truth, the father manifesting as th e ever - com ing son, who was Iu - sa the son of Ius ā as in the cult of On. All that was ever represented to the Jewish mind by the name of Ihuh 498 (Ihvh or Jehova h) had been expr essed to the Egyp tian by the word huhi , or, later, hehi. As Egypt ian “huh” signi fied everlastingne ss, millions of times, eternity, and “Huhi ” was also a name of their god the eternal. It had been a title, we repeat, of Ptah, of Atum , and of"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Osiris, each in turn, in three different cults at Memphi s, On, and Abydos . Huhi , then, was the eternal as the father; he who always had been, ever was, ever shoul d be, and hence the everlasting god. Iu was the ever - com ing son, Iu - sa or Iu - em - hetep, the son who com es with peace as periodi c manifestor for the eternal father. Thus the One God of the J ews was Egypt ian in this twofold character, bot h by nature and by name. The change in Israel from the worship of El - Shaddai to the worship of Ihuh, from the Elohi stic to the Jehovi stic god, corresponds to the change from the stellar to the solar worship i n the astronom ical mythol ogy . El in the highe st was the star - god on the sum mit of the mount ain, who in the Kamite mythos might be Sut, Seth, or Anup at the pol e. The pol e was represented by the mount , one Egypt ian name of which is Sut, denot ing standi ng - gr ound. The ruler of the pol e - star was the lord of standi ng - ground or station at the fixed centre of the heavens. The highest El was the eight h of the Ali or Baalim. In Hebrew he is called El - Shadda i, com monl y rende red the pow erful or might y one . Anot her ren dering, how ever, of the name is more than proba ble. This was the most high god, El - Elyon , whom the Phœ nicians also called Israel. As Egypt ian, it was Anup on the mount , or at the pol e, the highe st of the star - gods or Elohim who preceded the solar sove reign ty of Ra. El - Shadda i, who was Phœ nician, and had been co - worker with the Elohi m in the legends of creation, was succeeded and supe rseded by the god of two names who is made know n to Israel as “Ihuh” and Iahu, or “Iao”=Egypt ian Iu. The Egypt ian word Iu is a lso written , with u inhe rent, and has the meaning of com ing, com e, to com e, and is the name of the ever - com ing and eternal child, Iu - em - hetep, or Iusa, the com ing son. In the Phœ nician version the deity Iao= Iu is the com ing son, the well - belove d, the onl y - begot ten son of El, who was to be called Ieoud (or dvh y ), the suppos ed, prototype of “som ething to com e” in Christianity ( see Bryant). The word Iu with these meanings in Egyp tian agrees with Iah or Iahu in Hebrew, signi fying com e and to com e. Thus Huhi i s equi valent to hvh y , and Iu is equi valent to Hy as Ihu or Iao, the two forms of which name are different from each other at the root , but coul d be appl ied as two titles of the one god . Iah is por trayed as the god who is ope rative, audi ble, and visible in material phe nom ena. His are the might y deeds. He is the manifestor for the father, the ope ner of Amenta in the solar mythos . The Song of Moses show s that Iah was the divine deliverer who trium phe d glorious ly ove r the adve rsaries of the father, as did this deliverer in the exodus from the low er Egypt of Amenta (Ex. XV. 2). Iah is the oppone nt of Amalek, with whom he makes war for ever, as did Horus with Apap, the eternal enemy (Ex. XVII. 16) . Iah is the god who rides as conque ror through the deserts, (Ps. LX VIII. 4) and goe s forth before his peopl e marching through the wilderness. It was he who led his peopl e “like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron” (Ps. LXXVII. 20) . Iah is called upon as deliverer 499 from death and as the saviour from the sufferings of Sheol (Ps. CXVI). He is the com ing one who is looke d to and watched and waited for as the redeemer of Israel. It is to Iah the Hallelu - Iah of the Psalmist is raised. In shor t, the char acter is that of God the son, and therefore Iah is one with Iu the s on of Atum - Huhi . Iah is god the son, and the son in Egypt ian is the Messu. Thus , Iah the Messu is the Mes - Iah, hence the Messiah in"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"Hebrew. The Messiah as Iah the Messu was the ever - com ing son, like Iu, and Iu as Egypt ian is he who com es as manifestor for the eternal father. The dua lity of Ptah, also of Atum as Huhi the eternal father, and Iu the ever - com ing son, is repeated and preserved in the “Pistis Sophi a” of the Egypt o - gnos tics. Ptah is not mentione d by name. But the great forefather is called the fa ther of all fatherhood, the god who was “parentless”; and Ptah is the one god , who, being got ten by his ow n becom ing, was the self - existent and eternal one , Huhi (Eg.), Ihuh (Hebrew), Iao (Phœ nician), or Ieou (Egypt o - gnos tic). The one god in two persons , o r, as the Ritual expr esses it, with two faces, becom es twain in the father and son. These are called Ieou the greater and Iao the lesser. Ieou the elder is “the ove rseer of the light ”; Iao the younge r is the good Sabaoth, who emanates from Ieou as a son fr om the father (B. II, 193 ). Iao is also designa ted Sabaoth - Adamas, who is the gnos tic and Jewish deity Iao - Sabaoth thus identified with Atum - Ra, lord of the heavenly hos t. The same dua lity of father and son was figur ed in the twofold Athamas at Samothrace. “The two great books of Ieou” are mentione d in “Pistis Sophi a,” which are said to have been written dow n by Enoc h when Jesus “spoke with him from the tree of know ledge and the tree of life, which were the two trees in the paradise of Adam” (B. II, 246 ). T he paradise of Adam was the garden of Atum , and the Jesus who spoke and uttered the sayings was the wise yout h Iu, or Iu - em - hetep, the son of Atum , or Atum in his earlier character of Iu as the son of Ptah. Moreove r, it is not improba ble that a version of these is extant in two books of the apoc rypha , viz., the Wisdom of Jesus and the Wisdom of Solom on. The expounde r of the mysteries in these writings was the Egypt ian Jesus, who is the Sayer, word or logos , twice ove r as Egypt ian, onc e as Iu the son of Pta h, at Memphi s, and onc e as the son of Atum - Ra, Iu - em - hetep, the prince of peace, and prototype of the Hebrew Solom on, at On. The Egypt ian Jesus was equa lly the Egypt ian Solom on, the yout hful sage, as sayer and teacher of the oral wisdom . When Iamblichus de scribes the one god who was worshippe d at Heliopol is or Annu as “Ichton and Emphe ,” he refers to Atum in his two characters of father and son or Ra and Horus. Atum was represented at Annu by the fish of the inunda tion, and also by Iu - em - hetep, the bringe r of peace and plenty, as Ichton the fish that typi fied the saviour to Egypt . And now if for the mode rn Jews we read the ancient worshippe rs of Atum - Iu or, still earlier, of Ptah, we shall be able to follow Isaiah in his survey of the great dispersion of the Jewish peopl e ove r all the earth. “The Lord shall set his hand to recove r the remnants of his peopl e which shall remain from Assyria, and from Egypt , and from Pathros, and from Kush, and 500 from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the isla nds (or coast - lands ) of the sea. He shall assemble the out casts of Israel, and gather toge ther the dispersed of Juda h from the four corners of the earth.” (Is. XI. 11, 13.) It is noticeable that the prophe t calls the Lord who is to gather the Jews toge ther from all lands by the doubl e name of Iah - Jehova h. Iah is the Egyp tian Iu, whos e follow ers were the primeval Jews of Egypt nor th and sout h (Pathros), of Æthiopi a and Chaldea, of the islands of the sea, and the remotest shor es of the earth, includi ng the Je ws of Cornw all. These are the prehistoric Jews who are to be know n by the name of the god they worshippe d. This range will include the black Jews of Africa and Indi a, and all the rest of thos e whos e god we"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"identify with Iu the Egypt ian original and prototy pe of all; Iu as god the son, whether of the father as Atum or as Ptah. No such world - wide dispersion of the Jewish race from Palestine or Jude a had ever occurred in the time of Isaiah. It is the religious com muni ty, not the race, that will account for the Jews who emigrated to the ends of the earth, and for the names of the Jewish god, who was the Egypt ian Iu, Phœ nician Iao, Hebrew Iah, Assyrian Iau, Egyp to - gnos tic Ieou (greater and lesser), Chinese Iaou, Polyne sian Iho - Iho, Dyak Iaouh, Nicoba r Islands Eew u, Mexican Ao, Toda Au, Hunga rian Iao, Manx Iee, Cornish Iau, Welsh Iau (greater and lesser), Hebrew Iao - Sabaoth, Chaldean Iao - Heptaktis, Greek Ia, and IE, Latin Jupi ter and Jove . To follow the Jews as the Aiu of Egypt in their world - wide dispersion, we s hall have to think in cont inents rather than in Petticoat Lanes and Ghettos. The worshippe rs of Iao in Phœ nicia, of Iau in Assyria, of Iao in Syria, Iau and Hu in Britain, Ia or Iu in Greece, Jupi ter in Italy, Iho - Iho in Polyne sia, Iau in America were eac h and all of them Jews in a sense, but the sense was religious , not originally ethni cal; and religion doe s not determine race any more than langua ge doe s in later ages of the world. There was a religion of the god Iu or Iao in Egypt thirteen thous and years ago. That god was Atum - Iu, bor n son of Ptah. He was the earliest father in heaven because he was the divine Ra in his primordial sove reignt y. He is the god in two persons who was first figur ed as the sun upon the doubl e hor izon= the father in the west, the son in the east. This god went forth from Kam by several names and various rout es. Thos e who worshippe d him as Atum became the Adamites, the Edom ites, the red men; thos e who worshippe d him as Iao, Iah, or Iu became the Jews in many lands , and these are th e Jews of that world - wide dispersion recogni zed by Isaiah, which did not follow any know n historical exodus from Egypt or captivity in Babyl on, or migration from Palestine. The Jews were onl y ethni cal at root when the root was the vine in Egypt , or in Æthi opi a beyond, and the Jews were one of its branches. They were onl y ethni cal at root when the race was black, whether these were the black Jews in Africa or in Indi a. From the beginni ng the Jews were as they are to - day, a religious com muni ty. It is the wor ship of Iu in Egypt thirteen thous and years ago and the goi ng out from thence that will account for the supr eme being amongs t the Dyaks of Borneo being know n to them as Yavua h, which name was not derived from the Hebrew Jehova h, but 501 from the original of bot h (A. M. Cameron, Proc. Soc. of Bib. Arch. ). The Dyaks also preserve the tradition of a great ancestor who was determined to cons truct a ladde r that shoul d reach up to heaven, but one night a worm ate into the foot of the ladde r, and it fell like th e tow er of Babel. The Dyaks also have the legend of a great deluge which drow ned the chief part of manki nd and divided the rest. These two catastrophe s mark the endi ngs of two vast periods in time which preceded the supr emacy of Atum - Iu in the Zodi ac of tw elve signs . Thus amongs t a peopl e so isolated as the Dyaks they have the god Yavua h and the tradition of the two catastrophe s which are represented in the book of Genesis by the destruction of the tow er and the deluge of Noah. Naturally the “wisdom ” was ca rried into the island of Borneo with the cult of the god Iaoua h, whos e worshippe rs are elsewhere called the Ius or Jews from the Egypt ian deity who was Iu or Aiu by name bot h in the cult of Ptah at Memphi s and of Atum - Ra at On. The same god is found in the"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"Babyl oni an mythol ogy with the name Ia, or Iau= Iah in Hebrew (Pinches, T. G., Proc. Soc . of Bib. Arch. ). But it is not necessary to suppo se the Assyrian god Iau was derived from the Hebrew deity Iahu, or vice versa, when there is a com mon origin for bot h i n the Egypt ian god Iu. This is not a matter merely of phi lology, but of the characters in the mythol ogy. Iau is “the sage of the gods ” ( Assyn. Fragm ents ). He is also described as the divine artisan or art - workm an, especially in the character of the pot ter. This is Ptah all ove r. He was pre - eminently the pot ter, and the head of the Knemmu or divine moul ders. Further and finally, it was Ptah - Iu who, with his Ali, the Elohi m, created the Aarru - garden as a paradise of pleasure in the earth of eternity. And in t he Assyrian eschatology it is Iau, “the sage of the gods ,” who transpor ts the justified spirits after death to the “place of delight s,” where they are fed on but ter and hone y and drink the water that gives eternal life ( Records, vol . XI, 161 - 2). Our Britis h Druids worshippe d a deity of the same name and dua l nature as the Egypt ian Iu, the Assyrian Iau, the Hebrew Iahu. This divine dua lity, cons isting of the father and the son, was called by them Iau the elder and Iau the younge r, correspondi ng to the gnos ti c Ieou and Iao. The god Iu, as son of Ptah, was an astronom ical builder and architect of the heavens. Iu the son of Atum was also reput ed to be a great bui lder. As the Kamite Solom on he was not onl y the prince of peace and the divine healer; he was also s aid to have designe d the Temple. The stages of bui lding on earth were reflected in the heavens. The mound - bui lders were first. They raised the seven mounds of the heptanom is. Shu raised the four pillars of the four qua rters. Ptah was the architect who base d his bui lding on the pol e and the four cardinal poi nts=the four - squa re tent and tent - staff. Atum , his son, was the bui lder of heaven as the hous e, “the Father’s hous e on high” of which the Christian sings . This in the Ritual is called “the dw elling of my father Tum” (ch. 17) . It is also said to the deceased, “Tum hath bui lt thy hous e” (ch. 17, 30). “The doubl e lion - god hath founde d thy habitation. ” Lastly, the temple was designe d by Iu - em - hetep the son of Atum , as the builder in the astronom ical mythol ogy. Thence the peopl e named after the deity Iu as the Aiu, 502 or later Jews, woul d com e to be recogni zed in Egypt, the land of temples, as the great bui lders. And according to Rabbi nical traditions the Jews=Ius or Aaiu were the great typi cal bui lders. They are said to have excavated the mount ains, raised the pyr amids, bui lt temples and cities, and surrounde d them with walls; divided the Nile into several canals, and cons tructed dyke s against the inunda tion (Josephus and Philo). One of these great works was the canal of Joseph, i.e. the divine architect who as son of Ptah was his sif, Iu - sif=Joseph. Also, if we have to do with Egyptians who are onl y identified by a religious name, that of the deity Iu, there is no difficulty about their having bui lt the Meske not h of Tum , or, as it is rende red, the store - cities of Pithom and Rameses, when the great temple of Atum - Iu was originally erected at Annu or On, which according to the divine dyna sties follow ed Memphi s in attaining its supr emacy. The Jew - name was Egypt ia n then as Iu, or Aiu, with other variants. Aiu is a form of the word, and Neb - Aiu, the Lord Aiu, filled the office of high priest in the temple of Osiris at Abydos . The Aiu as manes in Amenta are the children of Ra, who was Atum - Huhi as Ra the father and A tum - Iu as Horus the son. The land of Jude a or Juda h was named in Egypt ian. It appe ars upon"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"the monum ents as Iuta or Iutah. Iu is dua l, ta is earth or land, and Iuta is the doubl e land or doubl e earth of the Egypt ian mythos localized in Jude a. The dua l king dom of Jude a was derived by name from the dua l deity Iu, whos e follow ers in Egypt were the Ius, Iews, or Jews, and given to Joseph in the persons of his two sons , Ephr aim and Manasseh. “Joseph shall have two por tions ” says Ezekiel (XLVII. 13) ; and these ha d already been assigne d to the two sons of Joseph by Jacob in the book of Genesis. In the mythos the two por tions of the doub le earth were uni ted onc e a year to form the kingdom of the sif or son, who is Joseph in the Hebrew version and Iu the sif as son o f Atum - Ra. The two halves were uni ted by the son in his name of Har - sam - taui, uni fier of the doubl e land. It has been show n that the Hebrew deity Ihuh was god the father in one character and in the other god the son. If the type of these was the bul l, thi s woul d represent the father, and the bul lock or calf the son, as with the bul l of Osiris and the calf of Horus. If the lion were the type , the old lion would represent the father, the young lion the son. The same with the ass, which was anot her type of th e deity Iu, the father and the son being represented by the ass and its foal. The sym bol ism of the lion, the bull, and the ass has its tale to tell conc erning Israel and the Kamite origins. The lion was a zoot ype of Atum - Iu. He is called the lion - faced in the Ritual. His mother was a lione ss. He is addr essed as a lion - god (Rit., ch. 28), the god in lion form (chs. 38, 41, 53, 54, 62) . It is the same with Ihuh in Israel. The god is described by Hezekiah (Is. XXXVIII. 13), as a lion: “As a lion, so he breaket h all my bone s.” This is looke d upon merely as a tropi cal figur e of speech, but it is a figure of fact in the original sym bol ism. Atum - Iu was the lion of Juda h in the Egypt ian mythos . The lion origin of Juda h’s totem was know n to Nahum in his inqui ry for t he lion - spirit of the past: “Where is the den of the lions and the feeding place of the young lions , where the old lion and the lione ss walked with the lion’s whelp and no one made them afraid? The 503 lion tore in pieces enough for his whelps, and stran gled for his lione ss and filled his caves with prey.” (Nahum II. 11, 12, 13.) These are equi valent to the lion as Ptah, the lione ss as Sekhe t Merptah, and Atum as the whelp. Iah roareth as the typi cal lion: “Thou shalt walk after the Lord, who shall roar l ike a lion, for he shall roar” (Hos. XI. 10) . “The Lord shall roar from on high, he shall might ily roar” (Jer. XXV. 30) . “The Lord shall roar from Zion” (Joel III. 16). “The lion hath roared: the Lord God hath spoke n” (Amos III. 8). Job was hunt ed by the L ord in the shape of a lion. “Thou hunt est me as a lion,” says the fearfully - afflicted one (Job X. 16) . The Lord was know n in Israel by his roaring like a lion, because he had been know n in Egypt as the lion - god who was Atum - Ra, the lion of the doubl e force which was represented by the twin lions (Rit., 162, 1). The solar Dionys ius was know n by the name of “the roarer,” and he was also por trayed as a lion - headed god. In the Bakchai of Euripides (1078) he is invoke d by the chor us to manifest in his might and appe ar as a flaming lion. The reason of this roaring in that shape is that the Lord was imaged as a lion on the moun t of the lions, which was the Mount Shennu= Sinai, the lion - mount where the Lord was the solar lion — where, in fact, he was the two lions , the old lion and the young one . These are referred to by Hosea. “I will be unt o Ephr aim as a lion, and as a young lion to the hous e of Juda h. I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.” (Hosea V. 14.) The solar"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"bir thpl ace in the mythos was upon the mount of the two lions . Horus the son was reborn upon the hor izon as “the young lion made resplende nt at his birth by the two lions ” (Rit., ch. 3). Also it is said that “Juda h is a lion’ s whelp; he stoope d dow n, he couc he d as a lion and as a lione ss.” In this description we have the typical lion in the triple form of a lion, the lione ss, and the whelp, as the type was por trayed in Egyp t. There was a triple - headed lion - god at Meroe with four arms, which may well stand for t he dua l - natured Atum - Iu as the son of the lion - headed Ptah and Sekhe t (Rawlinson on Herodot us, II, 35) . According to the langua ge of the Ritual, this woul d be the “lion of the doubl e lions ,” or doubl e force. It is proclaimed by Ezekiel that the mother of I srael was a lione ss. As “a lione ss she couc hed among lions and she brought up one of her whelps; he became a young lion; the nations also heard of him: he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with hooks into the land of Egypt ” (Ez. XIX. 1, 5). This is anot her and a truer version of the mythos euhe merized in Exodus as the story of Joseph and his brethren. The lion was taken in the same pit into which Joseph was cast in the “historic” account , and this identifies the Egypt signi fied as low er Egypt in Amenta. Joseph is the Iu - sif in Egypt ian — that is, Iu the son, who is here represented as the young lion whose mother was a lione ss. The origin of the mother as a lione ss was the same as with the sow or the cow . It was totemic and typical. The lione ss was a zoot ype of the mythical Great Mother, Kefa (or Kheft), who became the Hebrew Chavva h, the genetrix of life and mother of the hum an race. Sekhe t, the Great Mother in her solar form, was also a lione ss, and in certain Egypt ian texts the godde ss Sekhe t has been represented as an ancestress of the hum an race (Lefébur e, Tom beau de Seti, I, 11, pl. 504 4, 5). She also was the mother in Amenta who reproduc ed the Aiu or Jews, as the children of Ra, for anot her life. “I know ,” says the manes, “that I have been c onc eived by Sekhe t and bor n of Neith” (Rit., ch. 66). This likewise was the divine or mythical ancestry of the Jews; but onl y the Egypt ian wisdom ever coul d expl ain the derivation of the race, of either Jew or Gentile, from the lione ss. Sekhe t was the cons ort of Ptah, one of whos e type s is the lion. These two, Ptah and Sekhe t, were the parents of Atum , the lion - god in the cult of Atum - Ra; and Atum was the first man and reput ed father of the hum an race, with Iu, the sif, or son, who is the young lion as Jose ph. Thus , and in no other way, was man or manki nd mothered by Sekhe t the lione ss, by Kefa, by Chavva h, or by Eve. And in that way onl y was a lione ss the mother of Israel, whos e whelp is the young lion as the lion of Juda h. The Lord who was a lion as the re presentative of solar force becom es the “lion - like” of later langua ge. Thus the Egypt ian origins of the Jews, their gods , their mythol ogy, and their sym bol ism were veiled from view, and phi lology was left without the necessary determinative type s and palpa ble figures of the unde rlying facts. The Egypt ian deity Iu, the son of Atum - Ra, was also por trayed as a shor t - hor ned bul l - calf. Not as the god in person, but as a figur e to be interpreted by a necessary know ledge of the sym bol ism. Osiris was designa ted th e “bul l of eternity.” Atum was the earlier bul l - father. His cons ort was Iusâas, a form of the cow - headed godde ss, their divine child being Iu, the su or sif, in the image of a bul l - calf; and as here show n Iu is =Jah in Hebrew, as god the son, who is identi fiable with Joseph. The difficult passage in Genesis (XLIX. 22) might be more correctly rende red, “Joseph is son of the heifer.” This he"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"woul d be as Iu (em - hetep), the sif (son) of the cow - headed Iusâas, who was a form of Hathor , the gol den heifer, in the temple of Atum - Ra at On. The god who brought up Israel out of Egyp t is not onl y represented by the golden calf; he is also said to have the hor ns of the ox or wild bul l (Num bers XXIII. 22) . Iu was the bul l in one character and the calf in the other; and as it was with Iu in Egypt so is it with Iahu in Israel, onl y we must learn to read the imagery aright in accordance with the Egyp tian wisdom , which we are told was so familiar to “Moses.” As Kuenen states it, “Ihuh was worshippe d in the shape of a young bul l. It cannot be doub ted that the cult of the bul l - calf was really the cult of Ihuh in person. ” This statement, how ever, is not in keeping with the present mode of presenting the facts. The existence of type s doe s not of necessity invol ve a worship of the t ype . The whol e range of sign - langua ge lies between such an assum ption and the pos sible truth. Otherwise stated, the young bul lock was one of the type s unde r which the god Iu was represented by the Egypt ians and the Israelites. The bul lock, for example, was identified with Joseph and venerated as the zoot ype of his divinity by certain of the ancient Jews (Kircher, vol . I, p. 197) , Joseph being, as herein maintained, a form of Iu the son (sif), with Jacob as a figur e of the father - god . The calves of Beth - Aon also poi nt to Iu, the calf - headed god , and the beth or temple of Atum - Ra in Annu, the Hebrew On (Hosea X. 5). It is said by Hosea, “Ephr aim is an heifer that is taught , that love th to tread out 505 the corn; but I have passed ove r upon her fair neck” ( Ib . X. 11) . Iusâas, the mother of Iu, was the heifer on whos e neck, or between the horns of whos e head, the sun - god rode . Her son was Joseph as the Iu - sif; and in this passage we have a casting back aimed at the origins after the attempted casting out of the cult. The sons of Joseph are identified with the calves of Beth - On, and Ephraim with the heifer. Cove nants also were established in Israel by cutting a calf in twain and passing the contracting persons between the two parts (Jer. XXXIV. 18, 19) , which mad e the type equi valent to the two sexes of the mother and child or heifer and calf, or the calf that was bot h male and female; also to the dua lity of father and son. The Vigne ttes to the Ritual prove that Atum - Ra the solar god and his son Iu were also repr esented by the ass. The sun or sun - god goe s dow n to Amenta as, if not riding on, the ass. He is attacked there by the Apap - serpent who devour s in the dark (Vigne tte, Rit., ch. 40). At dawn he rises and is hauled up by the ass, or by the young solar god wit h ass’s ears. Thus we have the old ass and the young , the Hebrew ass and the foal of an ass, on which the sun - god in the later legend rode when he came up from Amenta riding on the ass in the mythol ogy which preceded the eschatology. The ass and the young sun - god also were bot h named Iu, and Iu was the son of Atum - Ra, the ass being his zoot ype . Iu, as Egypt ian, is represented by Iao in Phœ nician and in Hebrew. Clement Alexande r, who was an Egypt ian, spells the name of Jehova h as Iau. Thus , “Iu” is the ass i n Egypt ian, Iao is a name of the god with an ass’s head, and Iau is Jehova h, the god of the Jews and the Christians also. Epipha nius asserts that the deity Sabaoth was also the Jew - god, or god Iu, who was know n by the name of Iao - Sabaoth. The ass - god is po rtrayed on som e of the talismanic stone s that were copi ed by King in his work The Gnos tics and their Remains. In one of these Iao is ass - headed in the character of Horus"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"grasping the two scorpions as he stands upon the cippus (pl. G, 2). But King, who call s this “the ass - headed Typhon, or the principle of evil,” is hope lessly wrong. According to the Egypt o - gnos tic “Pistis Sophi a,” Iao - Sabaoth is god the son to Ieou (Ihuh) as god the father, both of whom were forms of the ass - headed deity. And Iao, or Abraka s, is likewise por trayed upon the gnos tic gems in the shape of a doubl e - headed ass, which is equi valent to the father - god and son in the same image as Ieou and Iao, Ihuh and Iah, or Huhi and Iu with their dua lity blende d in one figure (King, G. R., pl. B). It represented Horus, or Iu in the cult of Atum - Iu. King kne w onl y of one ass, which to him was a type of the evil Sut or Typhon. But this was not the ass of Iu, Iao - Sabaoth or Atum - Ra. In the Museum of the Collegio Rom ano to - day there may be seen a fig ure of the ass - headed god who was Egypt ian, Jewish, and Gnos tic. It is the image of a man extende d cross - wise on the Rom an cross. The figure is being saluted by a worshippe r of the god, who was thus por trayed with the head of an ass. It was discove red som e years since scratched roughl y on the wall of a room in a hous e that was bur ied in ancient times beneath the bui ldings of the Palatine Hill, and was cut out from the wall and depos ited in the Rom an 506 Museum . King, in describing it, tries hard but vainl y to make out that the animal is not an ass, but was intende d for Anubi s, the jackal. He says: “In reality the produc tion of som e devout but illiterate gnos tic, it is cons trued into a shoc king heathen blasphe my and a gibe upon the good Christian Alexamenos , because they mistake the jackal’s head for that of an ass, and cons eque ntly imagine an intentiona l caricature of their ow n crucifix.” There is no mistaking the ass for Anubi s. There was no caricature in the crucifix. The ass is a type of the solar suffer er in Amenta, who came to be called the crucified. The Rom an or Latin cross is a figur e of the longe st night and shor test day when the sun was in the winter solstice. The ass - headed god upon the cross is the exact equi valent of Osiris - tat, and in this crud e representation we find the divine victim on or as the cross instead of the tat, or instead of being devour ed by the “eater of the ass,” as in the Vigne ttes to the Ritual. The ador ation of Alexamenos was directed to the god who is por trayed upon the cross , not of the equi nox, but of the winter solstice, as the sufferer in Amenta, and as the form of the solar deity who made himself a sacrifice like Ptah, or Osiris in the cross - tree of the tat. (King, The Gnos tics and their Remains, 2nd ed., pp. 229 - 30). It was charged against the Christians in Rom e that they also were worshippe rs of the ass - god. Tertullian in a passage of his reply says to his oppone nts, “Like many others, you have dreamed that an ass’s head is our god, but a new version of our god has late ly been made publ ic at Rom e, ever since a certain hireling convi ct of a bul l - fight er put forth a picture with som e such inscription as this, ‘The god of the Christians O N O K O I H T H S .’ He was portrayed with the ears of an ass, and with one of his feet hoof ed, hol ding in his hand a book, and clothed with a toga ” (Apol ., 16). Diodor us says, according to the fragm ent of Lib. 34 preserved by Photius, that when Antiochus Epipha nes, after conque ring the Jews, went into the inne r sanctuary of God, he found th ere a stone statue of a man with a long beard, hol ding a book in his hand and sitting on an ass. This he took to be an image of Moses. We shoul d rather take it to have"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"been the image of the ass - headed god Atum - Iu, who passed out of Egypt as Iao, Iau, or Ia o - Sabaoth, the solar god who as lord of hos ts in Egypt , before going forth, had attained the status of Huhi the eternal, the one god in spirit and in truth; Ra in the mythol ogy, the hol y ghos t in the eschatology; Atum - Huhi as the father, Iu as the son, and Ra as the hol y spirit. But the ass was not the god , whether of the Egypt ians or the Jews, the Gnos tics or Christians. It was but a type of the pow er that was recogni zed at first as solar, the pow er that was divinized in Atum, who was Ra in his primordial sove reignt y, and whos e son was the ass - headed Iao, Iau, or Iu. But we must make a further digression on account of Joseph as a form of the young solar god in Israel who was Iu, the ass - headed sif or son of Atum - Ra, in Egypt . Not one of the legends in the Hebrew writings attribut ed to Moses coul d be unde rstood apart from the mythol ogy from which they were funda mentally derived. Nor doe s the mythol ogy remain intact in the form of the märchen. The story of Joseph, for example, is a collection of fugi tive frag ments, each one of which is separately identifiable. Joseph is not simply one of 507 ten or twelve or seventy brethren in the family of Jacob or Israel. Joseph - El as the belove d son of Jacob was divine, and woul d be a divinity if there were any pos sibili ty of all the other sons being hum an. It is now know n that Jacob - El and Joseph - El were worshippe d as two divinities in Northern Syria, and it is there we find a remnant of the seed of Israel or Isiri - El, and therefore of Jacob - El whos e son was Joseph. But it is not to be suppos ed that Jacob was a hum an father, and that Joseph was his hum an son, who were divinized by addi ng the divine El as a suffix to their names. This leaves us with not hing but the two divinities to go upon. These proba bly originated with Iu in Kheb, or Low er Egypt, as Jacob, and Iu, the sif, or son, as Joseph; the two divinities being hum anized in the later legends of the Iu, Aiu, or Jews, as was the com mon way in conve rting mythos into history. It can be show n that Joseph was a form of th e divine, the belove d son, whos e father was hvh y in one version of the mythos and Jacob in anot her. Io or Jo= Iu in the name of Joseph ( [chy ) is taken by Hebraists as the equi valent of Iahu; and in Ps. LXXXI. 5, the name of Joseph is written Iahus iph ( [cvh y ) — that is, Iah the siph or sif, which in Egypt ian denot es the son. Also the names hypcvy , that is Joseph - Iah and of Josephi ah (Ez. VIII. 10) proclaim the fact, in accordance with the use and wont of the Hebrew langua ge, that Joseph is Iah= Iu in Egypt ian. I n the same way the name of El - Iasaph (Num . I. 14 and III. 24) identifies the deity of Joseph, and affirms that Iasaph is one with Iah, and therefore is Joseph - El. Joseph as son is Iu the sif, or the com ing son, in Egypt ian. These names show the identity of Joseph and Iu the sif, and denot e that Joseph was the son of the same father, who is Jacob in the one version and Ihuh in the other. The descent of the sun - god into the low er Egypt of Amenta is por trayed in the märchen as the casting of Joseph into the pi t, and the ascent therefrom in his glory by the coat of many colour s. In Egypt Joseph plays the part of Repa to the Ra or Pharaoh. In this character he rides in the second chariot when he goe s forth as the Adon, or Aten, ove r all the land. But as Joseph - El he is the divine Repa, the Horus of thirty years — that is, Iu the sif in the cult of Atum - Ra. At thirty years of age the son as Horus, or Iu the sif=Joseph, took his seat upon the throne beside the father, and went forth as ruler ove r all the land of Egypt , the"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"halves of which were uni ted when the young god assum ed the sove reignt y of the doub le count ry in the mythos , and is called Har - sam - taui, uni ter of the doubl e earth, or earth and heaven, in the eschatology. His relations hip to Neith likewise attests hi s divinity. When the throne - name of “Zaphe nath Paneah”=Sif - Neith the living, is conferred upon him he is identified as the son who became the cons ort of the cow - headed Neith, a form of whom was the godde ss Iusâas, the mother of Iu the sif=Joseph, at Heliop olis. This relations hip to the great Neith is fulfilled when he becom es the cons ort of Asenath or Asa - Neith, whos e name identifies her as the great godde ss Neith, the daught er of Ra, or, as “historically” rende red, the daught er of Potipha r. As mythical ch aracters, Joseph and Jesus are two forms of one original. Joseph in Israel was a name of the Messiah who was 508 expe cted as the ever - com ing son. Now , in Egyp tian there are two names for the com ing son: one is Iu the su= Jesus; the other is Iu the sif=Jos eph. And when the wande ring Jew, named Kartaphi les, became a Christian he is called Joseph, and was said to have fallen into a trance onc e every century, and to have risen again at thirty years of age . That is the age of Horus the adul t in his second adve n t; also of Jesus in the Gospels, as well as of Joseph when he became the Adon ove r all the land of Egypt , the doubl e land or doubl e earth of Egypt in Amenta. Joseph being identified as a god in Joseph - El, the god Joseph is further identifiable as an Egyp t ian deity who was Iu, the ever - com ing son, bot h in the dyna sty of Ptah at Memphi s and also of Atum - Ra at On. The divine nature of Joseph - El may expl icate a passage from Cheremon, cited by Josephus , who records a tradition that one of the two leaders of the Israelites, in an exodus from Egypt which can no longe r be cons idered historical, was Joseph. Cheremon was one of the most learned men in Egypt , and the cont empor ary of Apion, against whom Josephus wrote his reply. He was keeper of the rolls and books . He was an Egypt ian historian in the library of the Serapæ um . He also com pos ed a hierogl yphi cal dictiona ry, fragm ents of which are still extant and have been of service to Egypt ologi sts. Cheremon, therefore, was one of thos e who kne w. He not onl y asserts that one of the two leaders was Joseph, but also that his Egypt ian name was Peteseph, and that he was a sacred scribe. Now , as may be seen, the name of Ptah was rende red by Pet in the Greek name of Petesuchis for the Ptah (Putah) of crocodi les; and Joseph= Pete seph in Egypt ian is the sif or son Iu, i.e. Iusif, whilst Peteseph is the son of Ptah, which he was as Iu the sif of Ptah in the Egypt ian divine dyna sties — that is, Iu - em - hetep. Peteseph as Iu the son of Ptah (or Ptah the son) was the divine scribe in perso n who is por trayed in that character with the papyr us - roll upon his kne e and the cap of wisdom on his head. The fact of Joseph being the son of Ptah, or Ptah in the character of the divine son, was certainly not derived from the biblical history of the Jew s, but it was derived by Josephus from an uni mpeachable Egypt ian author ity, viz., that of Cheremon. Thus , Iu the sif of Ptah, with Moses, is equi valent to the yout hful solar god with Shu - Anhur in the exodus from the low er Egypt of Amenta. Of cour se, Joseph and Moses coul d not be cont emporaries as historical characters according to the book of Exodus , but they coul d as mythical divinities. And when Moses and Joseph are restored to their"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"prope r pos ition as deities there need be no difficulty about dates. As g ods they coul d be cont empor aries 509 (see “The Exodus ,” in Book X). Joseph is the typi cal dreamer and diviner in his yout h. And if Iu the sif of Atum - Ra be not an interpreter of dreams, he was the revealer of the future by means of dreams. One of the Pto lemaic tablets records the fulfilment of the prom ise that was made in a dream by this god to Pasherenpt ah conc erning the birth of a son (Renouf , Hib. Lect., p. 141) . This woul d be ground enough for the “inspired” writer to go upon in establishing the chara cter assigne d to Joseph as the dreamer and interpreter of dreams. The dream of the sun, moon, and eleven stars making obe isance to Joseph show s the astronom ical relations hip of the twelve to the signs of the zodi ac. Doubt less there was “corn in Egyp t,” wh ich was at all times par excellence the land of corn, but the typical corn - land of the religious mysteries is in Amenta, where the corn germinates periodi cally from the bur ied body of Osiris. We need to go no farther than the Papyr us of Ani to see from whe nce the legend of the seven kine was derived. In the Hebrew märchen it is related that Pharaoh – which Pharaoh is never specified, and this is as it woul d or shoul d be if Ra, the solar god , is meant – dreamed that seven kine came up out of the river that were fat and well - favour ed, and seven other kine that were lean and ill - favou red. When interpreted by Joseph, the seven fat kine are said to signi fy seven years of plenty and the seven lean kine seven years of famine. The dream was fulfilled in proof that Josep h was an historical persona ge, and that all the rest of the mythos reduc ed to märchen was matter of fact. Now, in the Ritual these are the seven cow s which are the givers of abunda nce in the Egypt of the low er earth, through which the river runs as the cel estial Nile. This then is the river out of which the seven cow s arose, and the count ry is in the other world, the lower Egypt of the doubl e earth, from which the original exodus was made in the goi ng forth of the manes from Amenta. The land of Egypt , the r iver and the seven cow s, all go toge ther in the mythical representation from which the “history” has been manufactured. The seven cow s are associated with the bul l in the Aarru - paradise of plenty. The bul l was the young solar god as Horus, or the bul lock - h eaded deity Iu, who passed out of Egypt as Joseph, the bul l of Israel. If there ever had been a failure of the Nile for seven years toge ther, the biblical account is none the less a pious fraud ( see the fraudul ent “Tablet of the Seven Years of Famine,” Pr oc. Soc . of Bib. Arch. ). For the fact is there was no real famine in the land of Egypt . “And the seven years of famine began to com e, according as Joseph had said: and there was fam ine in all lands : but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. And the fam ine was over all the face of the earth. And all count ries came into Egyp t to Joseph to buy corn, because the famine was sore in all the earth.” (Gen. XLI. 54 - 57. ) But not in Egypt . That is, not in the Egypt of eternal harvest, where the corn grew seven cub its high with ears som e eight y - four inches long . There is no historical sense in which such a statement coul d be truly interpreted. The mythos onl y can rende r it intelligibly. As may be seen in the Vigne ttes to the Ritual, the seven cow s, called the provi d ers of plenty, are depicted in the Aarru - paradise. This is in the lower Egypt of Amenta, and it is a land aboundi ng with corn, the "},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"510 onl y harvest - field in all the earth of eternity. There was nought but arid desert and the wilderness of sand in the dom ain of Sut. The Aarru in Khebt was the harvest - field of Horus=Joseph, of the twelve who are his reapers, and the peopl e who are his follow ers, amongs t whom we shall at last discove r the Jews as the Aaiu in Egypt . Joseph in Egypt has been assigne d the plac e of Horus in the Egypt of Amenta. “Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, King of Egypt ,” and went forth as the Repa to buy up the corn against the com ing famine. This is the age of Horus when he rises in Amenta as Amsu the hus bandm an, the master of food, or lord of the harvest, to becom e the ruler for Ra, the divine Pharaoh, with the flail or khu sign in his hand. Pharaoh makes Joseph ruler ove r all the land of Egypt , second onl y to himself; that is, according to Egypt ian usage, Joseph becom es the Repa to the Ra. In the Stele of Excom muni cation “Tum the creator god” is said to be “the dupl icate of Aten.” This tells us two things . First that the dua lity of the god, which is expr essed by the names of Huhi and Iu, was also expr essed by the names of Atum and Aten. Atum was god the father, and Aten the Nefer - Atum , the Repa, or roya l son. Thus Iu the sif is Aten= Adon by name, and Aten is the Adon to Atum - Ra, the divine Pharaoh. Now we are told that it is, or was, a practice of the Jews to use the word Adon instead of the word Ihuh in calling on the sacred name. And Adon, we repeat, is the Hebrew equi valent of the Egypt ian Aten as a title of Iu, the son of Atum - Ra, or of Atum who was “the dupl icate of Aten” in the person of the father. The Aten in Egypt ian is the lord, one with the Hebrew Adon , and when Joseph rode in “the second chariot” as lord ove r all the land of Egypt , and second onl y to the Ra, the Adon represented Aten the son to Ra, the father who was Atum - Ra or Atum - Huhi the eternal. Atu m was ador ed at On or Annu as the living god who in Egypt ian was p - ankhu, the living god. Now when the Egypt ian titles are conf erred on Joseph, and Pharaoh is said to have called him by the name of Zaphe nath - Paneah, whatsoever Egypt ian word may be represen ted by Zaphe nath, it is generally agreed by Egypt ologi sts that Paneah or Paneach is a rende ring of p - ankhu , the living god, which was the especial title of Atum - Iu in the temple of On. Joseph was thirty years of age when he “went out ove r the land of Egypt .” Horus was thirty years of age when he went forth ove r all the land of Egypt . Thirty years was the age of full adul tship. It is the typi cal age of the Sheru, the Prince, the Messiah in the Egypt ian, Persian, and Christian mythol ogy. Joseph was the Adon o f the Pharaoh, the Aten of Atum - Ra, and therefore he was thirty years of age when he went forth as ruler ove r all the land of Egypt . Joseph as the Aten was the lord ove r Egypt , with Atum - Ra as ove r - lord. The divine Ra and Horus were impersona ted in the hum an Pharaoh and Repa: these were previous ly extant as Atum and Aten, Tum and Nefer - Tum , who were the divine Ra and Iusif in the pre - Osirian religion of the Egyp tian Ius who became the unc lean, the accursed, the lepers, the out casts of Egyp t in later monum en tal times. Seek for the Jews in Egypt as the Iu, or Aaiu, and they will be found there in the same character that they assign to themselves as a peopl e suffering terribly from leprosy and other diseases said to have been the result of 511 "},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"unc leanne ss in their religious rites, which are so fervidly denounc ed in the Old Testament. The conc lusion that Joseph was the young solar divinity, Iu the Son of Atum - Ra at On, may be clinched by the story related of Potipha r’s wife, which is the same that is told in va rious other legends of this same mythical persona ge. The märchen that do exist in Egypt ian, as show n by the “Tale of the Two Brothers,” prove themselves to be the depos it of inde finitely earlier myth, the tale in this instance being a literary version of t he Sut - Horus legend, and of the two brothers, the twins of light and darkne ss, which is found world - wide as myth or märchen. The tale contains its ow n evidence of ancientness in the fact that the sun - god invoke d is not Ra, but the Horus of both hor izons , H ar - Makhu, who preceded the earliest form of Ra. The seven Hathor s, who are otherwise the seven cow s of plenty, are also present with Bata, the bul l of the divine com pany. The history of Joseph can be partly traced to the Egypt ian story of “The Two Brother s,” written by the scribe Anna in the time of Seti II, nineteenth dyna sty, on a papyr us now in the British Museum ( Records of the Past, vol. II, p. 139 ). In this story we find a form of the Sut - Horus myth reduc ed to the status of the popul ar märchen. Sut a ppe ars in his later character of Sut - Anup or Anup (to drop the name of Sut). Anup is the elder brother of Bata, who is Horus as the younge r brother. Like Horus, he is the bul l of the divine com pany of the gods who went dow n into Egypt or the dark land of E thiopi a. The doubl e Sut and Horus imaged back to back is repeated when Anup is described as sitting on the back of Bata. “Anup his elder brother sat upon his back at dawn of day,” that is, in the twilight which was represented when Sothis rose heliacally, or, as it is imaged, sat upon the back of Horus the young solar god. The dua l nature of Child - Horus is repeated in Bata when he says to his cons ort, “I am a wom an even as thou art,” and declares that his male soul or his heart is in the flower of the acaci a tree. This soul of Bata in the flow er of the tree of life can be paralleled in the Ritual, where Horus is the gol den Anbu, the flow er of the hidde n dw elling (ch. 71) . Anup is the gui de of Bata in the märchen, as of Horus in the myth. Anup is the attenda n t on Bata in the mount ain and his mour ner in death, as he is of Horus in the Ritual. Anup is the master of the fields of food , and he ordains that thos e who are in charge of the food shall be with the Osiris (ch. 144 ). Bata follow s the beautiful cattle, wh o tell him where the greenest grasses and the richest herbage grow . These are the seven cow s who are the provi ders of plenty, to whom Bata, like Osiris or Horus, is the fecunda ting bul l. The seven cow s likewise appe ar in the same story as the seven Hathor s . Bata the strong one can be identified with Horus in the character of Amsu the hus bandm an, who is por trayed as the preparer of the soil and sow er of seed. Bata doe s the plough ing and other labour s in the fields of Aarru, and his equa l was not to be found in all the land. Thus the myth of Sut - Horus the twin brothers can be traced in the ancient folk - lore of Egypt , and this can be follow ed into the “historic” or euhe meristic pha se in the book of Genesis, where it reappe ars as the story of Joseph 512 the be autiful yout h and Potipha r’s wife. Bata was the bul l of the divine com pany that went dow n into the Egypt of Amenta. Joseph is the bul l or chief one of the children of Israel who went dow n into Egypt . Bata is the divine hus bandm an and lord of the harvest. J oseph is the one to whos e sheaf the other sheaves bow ed dow n in recogni tion of his"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"supr emacy as lord of the harvest (Gen. XXXVII. 5 - 8). The seven cow s or Hathor s are the foretellers of fate cons eque nt on their being the bringe rs of good fortune . Also the b ull of the cow s is the diviner of fate. Bata the bul l divines and foretells the events that will occur to him. This is the character ascribed to Joseph as the diviner in the biblical version. If the parallel had been perfected, Potipha r, whos e name denot es the servant of Ra in Egypt ian, shoul d have taken the rôle of Anup, who is the servant of Ra. In the Hebrew version we read that “Joseph was com ely and well - favour ed. And it came to pass after these things that his master’s wife cast eyes upon Joseph, and she said, Lie with me. But he refused, and said unt o his master’s wife, Behol d, my master know eth not what is with me in the hous e, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand: there is none greater in this hous e than I; neither hath he kept anyt hing fro m me but thee. How then can I do this great wickedne ss, and sin against God? And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unt o her, to lie by her, or to be with her. And it came to pass about this time that he went into the hous e to do his work, and there was none of the men of the hous e there within. And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out ” (Gen. XXXIX. 9 - 12). In the Egypt ian folk - tale Bata goe s into the hous e of Anup to fetch seed, and the wife of Anup cast her eyes upon him. “And she spoke to him, saying, What strengt h there is in thee; inde ed, I obs erve thy vigour every day. Her heart kne w him. . . . She seized upon him, and said to him, Com e, let us lie dow n for a little. Better for thee. . . . beautiful clothes. Then the yout h became like a panther with fury on account of the shameful discour se which she had addr essed to him. And she was alarmed exceedingl y. He spoke to her, saying, Verily, I have looke d upon thee in the light of a mother, and thy hus band in that of a father to me. ( For he is older than I, as much as if he had begot ten me. ) What a great abom ination is this which thou hast mentioned to me. Do not repeat it again to me, and I wil l not speak of it to anyone . Verily, I will not let anyt hing of it com e forth from my mout h to any man” ( Records, vol . II, pp. 140, 141) . Joseph being identified as the same character with Bata, it is Bata who will expl ain that character. Bata signi fies th e soul of the earth. In the Egypt ian mythos this was the sun. “I am Bata,” says the manes in the character of the solar god who is renewed and rebor n daily as the soul of the earth and multiplier of the years (Rit., ch. 87). He might be rebor n unde r the se rpent type , or as the soul of Atum from the lotus, or the soul of Bata from the flow er of the tree of dawn. But the myth is not merely solar. In fact, there is no bot tom to the solar myth except in the luna r. Anup and Bata must be identified with Sut and H orus as the brothers in the two halves of the luna tion before the tale can be correlated and correctly read. 513 Sut - Anup was the elder brother of the two. His consort was Nepht hys , the lady of darkne ss, who is charged with soliciting the young lord of l ight . There was som e scanda l respecting her and Osiris. The typi cal wanton who seduc es or tries to seduc e the yout hful hero is the lady of the moon , who ove rcom es or who assails the lord of light . The character is determined in relation to Anup= Sut, the el der of the twin brothers in the mythos which passed into the eschatology and finally survived in the märchen of the two brothers. The story was represented three times over: (1) as mythical, (2) as eschatologi cal, and (3) as a folk - tale, before it was narr ated of Joseph in Egypt as Hebrew"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"history or biblical biography. The origin of the mythos rests with the darkly beautiful Nepht hys , cons ort of Sut (or Anup) , the pow er of darkne ss in the nether - earth. That she had a character som ewhat aphr odi siacal assigne d to her, which became the subj ect of the legend, may be gathered from her being a divinity of the Egypt ian tow n Tsebets, called Aphr odi topol is by the Greeks. But she has been degraded as a wicked wanton in later representations of the dark lady who was or iginally the lady of darkne ss, at first in com plexion, afterwards in character. The Semites began it with their scanda l - monge ring conc erning Ishtar (or Shetar, the bride in Egypt ian), because she had been the pre - monoga mous great mother whos e child and spo use were one . The Greeks follow ed them either directly or indirectly. Plutarch repeats a tale in which it is charged against Nepht hys that either she seduc ed Osiris or he succum bed to her wiles. It is represented in the rom ance that after Nepht hys had beco me the wife of Anup she fell in love illicitly with Horus, and besought him to stay with her when he came to plough and sow the seed - fields of Amenta. It is as the sow er of seed that Bata goe s to the hous e where Anup ’s wife is sitting at her toilet. He say s, “Arise and give me seed, that I may go back to the field.” Nepht hys is literally the hous e of seed personi fied. She carries bot h the hous e and the seed - bow l on her head, and her name of Nebthi signifies the seed - hous e or granary of the earth. The story of Joseph and Potipha r’s wife cont ains a mutilated fragm ent of this ancient Egypt ian märchen reduc ed from the mythos into a romance. In this Potipha r is Anup, the wife is Nepht hys , and Joseph is Bata or Horus, who is called the bul l. Bata was the bul l, and Joseph is also the bul l, in Israel; hence the totem of the tribe of Ephr aim was the bul l. Bata is the bul l of the seven cow s which com e to him as the seven Hathor s, and, to make use of the Egyp tian figure, Joseph, likewise is the bul l of the seven cow s th at were seen in Pharaoh’ s dream. He was also the bul l as the adul t of thirty years. In the Egypt ian story Bata becom es a bul l. “And Bata said to his elder brother, Behol d, I am about to becom e a bull with all the sacred marks, but with an unknow n history. The bul l arrived, and his majesty the Pharaoh inspected him and rejoiced exceedingl y, and celebrated a festival above all description; a mighty marvel and rejoicings for it were made throughout all the land. To the bul l there were given many attenda nts and many offerings , and the king love d him exceedingl y above all men in the whol e land. And when the days were multiplied after this his majesty was wearing the collar of lapis lazuli with a wreath of all kinds of flow ers on his neck. He was 514 in his braz en chariot, and he went forth from the royal palace. Bata was brought before the king, and rejoicings were made throughout the whol e land. They sat dow n to make a hol iday (and they gav e him his nam e ); and his majesty at onc e love d him exceedingl y, and rais ed him to the digni ty of Prince of Æthiopi a. But when the days had multiplied after this, his majesty made him hereditary prince of the whol e land. And the sun - god Horus of bot h hor izons said to Khnum , O, make a wife for Bata, that he may not remain alone . And Khnum made him a com panion, who as she sat was more beautiful in her limbs than any wom an in the whol e earth; the whole godhe ad was in her.” And now a tale is told of this cons ort of Bata which tends to identify her with Neitochris, that is primarily with the godde ss Neith, and thence with Asenath the wife of Joseph. These quot ations from the Egypt ian tale cont ain the gist of the following statement. “And Pharaoh said"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"unt o Joseph . . . . Thou shalt be ove r my hous e, and according to thy word shall all my peopl e be ruled; only in the throne will I be greater than thou . And Pharaoh said unt o Joseph, See, I have set thee ove r all the land of Egypt . And Pharaoh took off his signe t - ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph’ s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gol d chain about his neck; and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had: and they cried before him Abrech: and he set him ove r all the land of Egypt . And Pharaoh said unt o Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and withou t thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt . And Pharaoh called Joseph’ s name Zaphe nath - Paneah ( hnip=tnpj ), and he gave him to wife Asenath the daught er of Potiphe ra. And Joseph went out ove r the land of Egypt . And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh the King of Egyp t” (Gen. XLI. 40, 46) . The passage in which Joseph makes himself know n to his brethren shoul d be com pared with the scene in which the lost Bata reveals himself and says, “Look upon me; I am inde ed alive. Loo k upon me, for I am really alive. I am a bul l!” and Bata “reigne d for thirty years as king ove r Egypt .” “And Joseph said unt o his brethren, I am Joseph; dot h my father yet live? And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into the land of Egypt ” (G en. XLV. 3, 4). Joseph also had becom e a bull or typi cal adult like Horus the man or god of thirty years. The fact is adm itted when it is said that “Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, King of Egypt .” In the solar sym bolism the sun as a calf in the winter solstice became a bul l in the vernal equi nox , where he found his heart, his soul , his force, som etimes imaged as pha llic, upon the sum mit of the tree of dawn. In the hum an sphe re the boy became a bul l — that is, a typi cal adul t of thirt y years. Asenath we take to be a form of the great Neith, who was represented at On (Annu) by Ius ā as the mother of the young bul l Aiu (or Iu= Io), who as her sif or son was Iusa. Professor Sayce in his “History of Joseph” says, with an una bashed effront ery, “What is impor tant ” (in this episode ) “is that the incident which played so large a part in Jose ph’ s 515 life shoul d hav e been preserved in Egyptian tradi tion! It becam e par t of the literary inhe ritanc e of the Egyptians !” (p. 36). Thus sugge sting that the Egypt ians derived their mythol ogy and folk - tales from the Hebrew Pentateuch. But to resum e: t he dramatis personæ in the Hebrew books of wisdom are chiefly the father and the son. The father is Ihuh, the self - existent and eternal god , and Iu (or Iusa) is the messianic son as manifestor in the cycles of all time. It is the father that is speaking of one of these periods , pos sibly a sothiac cycle, who says to Esdras, “The time shall com e.” “My son Jesus shall be revealed with thos e that be with him, and they that remain shall rejoice within 400 years.” This was long thought to have been a prophe cy of a Christ that was to com e as an historical persona ge. But this son of god , whether named Iu, Iao, Iusa, Jesus, or Joseph, coul d no more become historical than god the father, bot h being one . And if this divine son coul d ever have becom e historical, he woul d have been Jesus the son of Atum - Ra at On, or, still earlier, Jesus the son of Ptah at Memphi s. The “Wisdom of Jesus” in the Apoc rypha is, according to the Prologue , the wisdom of two different Jesuses, the one being grandf ather of the other. This can be expl ained by the Kamite mythol ogy and the two representatives of that name in the two divine dyna sties of Ptah and Atum - Ra. As Wilkinson remarked, “The Egypt ians acknow ledge d two of this"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"name (Jesus), the first the grandf ather of the other, according to th e Greeks, and the reput ed inve ntor of medicine, who received peculiar honour s on a certain mount ain on the Libya n side of the Nile, near the City of Crocodi les, where he was reported to have been bur ied” ( The Ancient Egyptians , vol. III, p. 205) . There are not only two with the name of Jesus who represent the sayer for the father god; Solom on is likewise a form of the wise yout h who uttered the wisdom in the sayings or logi a kuriaka. We are told in the prologue that “this Jesus did imitate Solom on.” But Iu - em - hetep, the Egypt ian Jesus, as the prince of peace, was Solom on by name. Thus the Jesus and Solom on of the Apoc rypha , to whom the Wisdom of Jesus and the Wisdom of Solom on are ascribed, were two forms of the Word or Sayer, who was Iu the son (su) of Ptah , and Iu - em - hetep, the prince of peace, otherwise know n to the Hebrews by name as Jesus and Solom on. The most ancient wisdom was oral. It was conve yed by word of mout h, from mouth to ear, as in the mysteries. This cons isted of the magical sayings or the g reat words of pow er. Follow ing the oral wisdom , the earliest know n records of written wisdom were collections of the sayings , which were cont inua lly enlarged, as by the Egypt ian Jesus, or “the two of this name.” The Osirian Book of the Dead is largely a co llection of sayings which were given by Ra the father in heaven to Horus the son, for him to utter as teacher of the living on earth and preacher to the manes in Amenta. The wisdom of Ptah the father was uttered by the son, who is the Word in person. The n ames for the son may be various in the several religious cults, but the type was one , no matter what the name. The sayings collected in som e of the Hebrew books of wisdom , such as the book of Prove rbs, are spoke n as from the father to his son. “My son, att end to my words; incline thine ear unt o my sayings ” (Prov. IV. 20) . “Hear me, 516 O my son, ” is the formula in the book of Ecclesiasticus. It has now to be sugge sted that the mythical or divine originals of this father and son in the books of wisdom were the wise god Ptah and the yout hful sage Iu, the sayer or logos , who was his manifesting word as the son. Egypt ian literature as such has been almost entirely lost, but amongs t the survivals lives the oldest book in the world. This is a book of wisdom , in the form of sayings , maxims, precepts, and other brief sentences, called the Prove rbs of Ptah - Hetep, which was written in the reign of Tet - Ka - Ra or Assa, a Pharaoh of the fifth dyna sty, who lived 5,500 years ago. The author ’s name denot es that he was the w orshippe r of Ptah, and his collection cont ains the ancient wisdom of Ptah, although it is not directly ascribed to the god or to his son, the sayer, Iu - em - hetep. In this vol um e Ptah - hetep collects the good sayings , precepts, and prove rbs of the ancient wis dom ; the words of thos e who have heard the couns els of former days and the couns els heard of the gods . He addr esses the god Ptah for authority to declare these words of wisdom , speaking as from a father to his son; and in reply “the majesty of this god say s, Instruct him in the sayings of former days” ( Records of the Past, 2nd Series, vol . III, p. 17) . Ptah - hetep, then, the author who wrote a book with his ow n name to it 5,500 years since, assum es the pos ition of the wise god Ptah addr essing his son Iu - em - h etep, to whom the wisdom was com muni cated which was uttered in “the wise sayings , dark sentences, and parables,” and collected in such books as the Sayings of Jesus, the Wisdom of Jesus, the Wisdom of Ecclesiastes, the Wisdom of Solom on, the Psalms, and th e Book of the Dead. We quot e a few of the"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"sayings from Ptah - hetep, which give us a glimpse of the intellectual height attained by the Egypt ians 5,500 years ago. “No artist is endow ed with the perfections to which he shoul d aspire.” “He who perverts the tru thfulness of his way, in order to repeat onl y what produc es pleasure in the words of every man, great or small, is a detestabl e person. ” “If thou art wise, look after thy hous e. Love thy wife without alloy. Fill her belly, clothe her bac k, anoi nt her, and fulfil her desires as long as she lives. It is a kindne ss which doe s honour to its pos sessor.” “If thou art pow erful, com mand onl y to direct.” “To be abs olute is to run into evil.” “The gentle man penetrates all obs tacles.” “Teach the man of great pos ition that one may even do him honour .” “If thou has t becom e great who onc e was small, and rich after having been poor , grow not har d of heart becaus e of thy prosperity. Thou has t onl y becom e the steward of the good things of God. ” Ptah was the father of Atum - Ra, therefore an earlier god. Memphi s was an older founda tion than On, the northern Annu. And the wisdom of Ptah - Iu was inde finitely older than the writings of the Aiu or Jews which had been preserved in the library at On and brought forth thence by Osarsi ph as the basis of the Pentateuch. But the sayings of Jesus or logi a of the Lord did not com e to an end with the collection called the Wisdom of Jesus, that was translated “when Euergetes was king, ” and ascribed to two of the name of Jesus, with Sirach int erpos ed between. The first gos pel of the Christians began with a collection of the Sayings of Jesus, fatuous ly suppos ed to have been an historic teacher of that name. Every sect had its collection of the sayings that were uttered as the word of God 517 b y the Word in person, who was Horus in the Osirian religion, or Iu, the Egypt ian Jesus, to whom the books of wisdom were attribut ed thrice ove r, onc e as the son of Ptah, onc e as the son of Atum - Ra, and onc e as the son of Ieou in the Pistis Sophi a. The veil is being torn away from the eyes of thos e who were una ble or unw illing to see through it, and dead Egypt speaks onc e more with a living tongue . Expl orers are just beginni ng to find som e missing links betwixt the Ritual and thos e “gospels” that were canoni zed at last which were needed to com plete the argum ent conc erning the Egypt ian origin of the Christian legend herein presented, and to demons trate beyond doubt that the historic rende ring of the mythos doe s but cont ain an exot eric version of the esoteric w isdom . Only the other day a loos e leaf was discove red in the rubbi sh - heaps of Oxyr hync hus which had belonge d to som e unknow n collection of the sayings or logi a of “the Lord,” who was not Jesus, a Jew in Palestine, but Jesus or Iu - em - hetep, a god of the Jew s in Egypt ( Say ings of our Lord, Grenfell and Hunt ). It was at Memphi s, we sugge st, the book of wisdom , know n to later times as Jewish, originated as the wisdom of Ptah, whos e manifestor was Iu the com ing son, who was his logos , his word, the teacher of hi s wisdom and sayer of his sayings . Atum - Ra was born son of Ptah as Iu - em - hetep in his primary form. When raised to the dignity of Ra, Iu - em - hetep, the typi cal bringe r of peace and all good things , was cont inue d as his son. Both Ptah and Atum had the title of Huhi the eternal, and each of them was also a figur e of the one supr eme god who was bot h father and son in one person. In the gnos tic representation the propa tor was know n to Monoge nes alone , who sprang from him. It was also taught by the Egypt ian Valen tinus"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"that the father produc ed in his ow n image without conj unc tion with the female (Irenæ us, Against Heresies, B. I, ch. II, 1, 4, Ante - Nicene Library). The follow ing brief list will serve to give an ape rçu of this divine dua lity in various pha ses. Huhi t he eternal god the father, Iu the ever - com ing son; Atum - Ra as father, Nefer - Atum as the son; Osiris the father, Horus the son; Ihuh the eternal father, Iah the messiah or ever - com ing son; Jacob - El the father, Joseph - El the son; David the father, Solom on th e son; Ihuh the father, Jesus the son (Christian); Ieou the father, Iao the son (Pistis Sophi a); Jehova h as the father, Jesus as the son. These are all twofold type s of the same great one god in the religion that was established, first at Memphi s, with Pta h as Huhi the eternal, the self - existent, lord of everlastingne ss, “he who is,” or the “I am,” and Iu - em - hetep as his su, sif, or son, cont inue d in the cult of Atum - Ra at On, and broug ht forth from Egypt as the religion of the Ius or Jews, who were the wor shippe rs of Huhi the eternal and of Iu the ever - com ing messianic son, which dua l type was also represented by the old lion and the young one , by the bul l and the bullock, and by the ass and the foal of an ass. Moreove r, it is recorded in the Hebrew legend that the one god of Israel was made know n to Moses unde r two entirely different names. In two passages the name given is “ Hy ” (Ex. XV. 2 and XVII. 16) . Moses says, “Iah is my strengt h and son. ” “This is my God and I will praise him.” The other name is hvh y , rende red Jehova h. Unde r bot h names it is the one lord. Unde r bot h names the god is celebrated in the Psalms. Then 518 the name of Iah is droppe d altoge ther, except by Isaiah, who com bines the two names unde r the one title of hy - =hvh y , rende red “Jehova h - Jah,” or the Lord Jehova h (Is. XII. 2). These two names, we repeat, represent the Egyptian names of Iu= Iah for god the ever - com ing son, and Huhi =Ihuh the eternal father, who was the one god as Atum - Ra. Thus Isaiah’s Iah - Jehov ah com bines the names of bot h the father and the son in the name of Israel’s one god. And now , as the two characters of Huhi (Ihuh) and Iu (Iah) met in one person and the two names were com bined in Iah - Ihuh, it appe ars proba ble that bot h the names were blende d in one word to form the d ivine name of Ihuh (or hvh y ) in Hebrew, by com poundi ng thos e of Iu and Huh, thus , Iu - Huh, as a title of the eternal one . Iu woul d then be represented by the Ï or yod alone , and the final form woul d be Ihuh , which, with the introduc tion of the Hebrew letter vav, was extende d into Javeh and Jehova h for Jewish and Christian use. An insupe rable difficulty was beque athed to the later monot heists of Israel in the mystery of a biune being cons isting of a father and son who were but one in person. This needed a kn ow ledge of the ancient wisdom to expl icate the doc trine. How coul d the one god be two, or the twain one , to the plain and uns ophi sticated man? There was no abstract conc eption of any one god in two persons , or three, or 153 (Rit., ch. 141 ) as a spiritual e ntity. The origins are root ed in the phenom ena of external nature, and have to be interpreted by means of sign - langua ge and the mythical mode of representation. The Jews had got the father and son, and finally kne w not what to do with bot h. The son was a p erpetual difficulty in their writings , which repeated fragm ents of Egypt ian mythos in the old dark sayings without the oral wisdom of the Gnos tics, and left a stum bling - block that has remained to trip up all good, dunde r - headed Christians. Still the son is present, as the anoi nted Son of God, the Christ that was, who has been all along mistaken for the"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"Christ that was to be and is not yet, although the reign of the son as Ichthus in Pisces is nearly ende d now , and the Pisciculi are gasping for breath like l ittle fishes out of water. Jewish theologi ans did their utmost to suppr ess the sons hip of the godhe ad, as well as to get rid of the motherhood . This was preparatory to the rejection of the sons hip altoge ther when presented in the scheme of “historic” Chris tianity. They pur sued their messianic pha ntom to the verge of the qua gm ire, but drew back in time to escape. They left it for the Christians to take the final fatal plunge into the bog in which they have wallow ed, always sinki ng, ever since; and if the Jew s did but know it, the writings called Jewish have wrought an appa lling avenge ment on their ignor ant persecutors, who are still provi ng themselves to be Christians, as in Russia, by ignom inious ly mutilating and pitilessly massacring the Jews. Their god , li ke the Moha mmedan deity, was to be a father who never had a son. To put it in Egyp tian terms, they held to their one god Ihuh the eternal, as the fixed and everlasting fact, and dropp ed the Iu or ever - becom ing son, toge ther with the modus ope randi of becom ing, whether astronom ical or eschatologi cal, and so they parted com pany with the follow ers of Ptah - Iu and of Atum - Iu. Or rather the son was turned into the subj ect of prophe cy, whos e 519 ultimate com ing was suppos ed to be fulfilled in the cult of Christi anity. Thus the Jews are worshippe rs of the father, whereas the Christians subs tituted the son. These are two branches of the original religion in which the one god connot ed the father and the son, who was Huhi or Ihuh the eternal, with Iu as the ever - com i ng cyclical manifestor for the father in the sphe re of time. Celsus casts it up against Moses, as leader of the Israelites, that he deceived them with his magical tricks, and misled them into the belief that there was but one god (Origen, Cont ra Celsum , c h. 23) . For goo d or evil, how ever, the one god was established on the ground herein set forth, and this as hvh y the Hebrew god, the eternal, self - existent, supr eme one , whos e other name is Hy , Iah, Iao, or Iu. These are the two lords who cons titute the one god in the Hebrew version of the Egypt ian doc trine. In destroyi ng the cities of the plain it is said, “The Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gom orrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven” (Gen. XIX. 24, 25) , which is identical with Horus the lord as Har - Tema, the son who avenge s his father Osiris in the great judgm ent and destruction of the conde mned, who are ove rwhelmed in the cities of the plain because the occurrence is on the level at the place of equi librium in the equi nox of which there was a yearly representation in the mysteries of Amenta. There may be an attempt at times to conc eal the dua l persona lity in the phr aseology, as when the Psalmist says, “God stande th in the congr egation of gods ,” “He judge th among the gods ” (Ps. LXXXII. 1). But the writer lets in a flood of pol ytheism at the same time that he acknow ledge s the dua lity of Ihuh. In one psalm the anoi nted son is begot ten (Ps. II); in anot her he is appoi nted (Ps. LXXXIX) as the hol y one of Israel. In the latter instance it is David wh o is made the anoi nted son. Isaiah proclaims the god of Israel to be “the everlasting father” or father of eternity at the same time that he is the “prince of peace” who was the ever - com ing son as Horus or Iu - em - hetep, the prince of eternity in the astrono mical mythos of Egypt and the prince of peace in the eschatology. “For unt o us a child is bor n, unt o us a son is given; and the gove rnm ent shall be upon his shoul der, and"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"his name shall be called alp ” (rende red wonde rful), “counc illor, might y God, the fath er of eternity, prince of peace” (Is. IX. 6, 7). This song, upl ifted so majestically by the music of Hande l, might have been sung at On, or Memphi s, many thous and years ago, as regards the subj ect - matter, which is pur ely Egypt ian. Atum was the father of et ernity, and Iu - em - hetep, the su or son, was the prince of peace, and these two were one . Proba bly the Hebrew word alp (pehla) represents the Egypt ian pera or pela=to appe ar, show a great sight , in relation to the messianic manifestor, who was the messu or child, the prince of peace, and who “bor e the gove rnm ent upon his shoulder” in a sym bol ical way peculiarly Egypt ian. Atum , in his dua l character of father and son, is he who says, “I am he that closeth and he that ope neth, and I am but one ” (Rit., ch. 17). This doc trine of divine dua lity was based upon the Egypt ian Pharaoh as the father and the repa or heir - appa rent as the son — the ever - com ing king in the person of the prince who was always bor n to be a king. The father was king of Egypt , the son was the pr ince of 520 Ethiopi a, which was the birthpl ace of an earlier time and remained the typi cal birthpl ace of the young prince of eternity for all time. The messu was the root of the Messiah by nature and by name. The prince of Ethiopi a is the messu whence th e Messiah is Iu the son, messu or messu - iahu — that is, Iahu as the son or repa. In the mythical representation Horus was rebor n each year as the messu, and the rebirth was celebrated by the festival called the Messiu. The repa sym bol ized the succession of R a, or the sun, to himself, in a mode of show ing that the god or the king never died, but cont inue d for ever by transformation of the father into the son. The transformation was also seen in the old moon changi ng into the new, and the sun that set sym bol ica lly rende red as the old beetle that went unde rground to hatch its seed and die, to issue forth again renewed in its young . The Pharaoh transformed into his ow n son and manifestor as the repa, Atum into Iu - em - hetep, Osiris into Horus, Jacob into Joseph, and Ihuh into the Messiah. This transformation occurred in natural phe nom ena periodi cally, therefore at the end of som e particular cycle of time which was always inde finite for thos e who kne w not the method of measurement astronom ically. The Lord and his ano inted as father and son had been already represented at Memphi s by Ptah and Iu - em - hetep, at On by Atum and Nefer - Atum , at Abydos by Osiris and Horus of the resurrection. The lord’s anointed was the second Horus, Horus the adul t, Horus who rose again in spi rit after death to manifest the glory of the father with the hol y oil upon his shining face which made him the anoi nted. The Lord’s anoi nted, called the Messiah in Hebrew, the Kristos in Greek, and Chrestus in Latin, is the Messu in Egypt ian. Messu signi fi es the son, the child, or heir - appa rent, the prince of Ethiopi a. As hum an he was the repa, son of the Pharaoh. As divine he is the son of god . Messu is also an Egypt ian word signi fying the anointed and to be anoi nted. The Lord and his anoi nted are freque nt ly mentione d in the Hebrew writings . These are the father and son, equi valent to Osiris and Horus his son; also to Ptah and Iu the prince of peace. “The Lord shalt exalt the horn of his anoi nted” (I Samuel II. 10). “Here I am: witness against me before the Lord and before his anoi nted” (I Samuel XII. 3). “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take couns el toge ther, against the Lord and against his"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"anoi nted” (I Ps. II. 2). “The Lord show eth lovi ng - kindne ss to his anoi nted” (Ps. XVIII. 50) . “T he Lord saveth his anoi nted; he will answer him from his hol y heaven” (Ps. XX. 6). “He is a stronghol d of salvation to his anoi nted” (Ps. XXVIII. 8). “Behol d our shield O God, and look upon the face of thine anoi nted” (Ps. LXXXIV. 9). “Thine enemies have r eproached the foot steps of thine anoi nted” (Ps. LXXXIX. 51) , who was the witness and the messenge r that show ed the way of the Lord in the heavens, in the earth, in the waters and in the nethermost depths of Sheol. The “anoi nted of the Lord” was the very br eath of their nos trils to them who had said, “Unde r his shadow we shall live among nations ” (Lam. IV. 20) . “The Lord goe s forth for the victory with his anoi nted” (Hab. III. 13) . This dua lity of Ihuh and the Messiah or rebor n son was the sour ce of a great dilemma to the Jews, and the cause of a conf lict betwixt their monotheism and the Messiahship. They kne w of a 521 doc trine conc erning the Messiah, but were afraid of the astronom ical fulfilment being mistaken for the hum anly historical, and thus insisted all the more upon the divine uni ty in its simplicity. In the Ritual, Horus is described as the son who conve rses with the father. He is thus addr essed, “O son who conve rsest with thy father!” (ch. 32) . This character is ascribed to David as the divine son in the Psalms, he who declares, “The Lord said unt o me, Thou art my son, this day have I begot ten thee” (Ps. II. 7). In the same psalm the Lord is said to have begot ten his anoi nted son and set him as the king upon his hol y hill in Zion. This is the son a s the divine avenge r of whom it is said, “Kiss the son, lest he be angr y and ye perish by the way, for his wrath will soon be kindl ed.” The father says to his son, “Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inhe ritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy pos session. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a pot ter’s vessel” (Ps. II. 7, 8, 9). In the Ritual (chs. 17 and 175) , this avenge r is the son who “com eth red with wrath as the heir of Osiris s eated upon the throne of the dw eller in the lake of twofold fire.” This is Horus who says to his father after the periodi c battle with the evil pow ers, “I, thy son Horus, com e to thee.” “I have avenge d thee. I have ove rthrow n thy foes. I have established a ll thos e who were of thy subs tance upon the earth for ever.” That is when he returns to the father in heaven with his work accom plished on the earth and in Amenta. In the time of Isaiah and of the Hebrew psalmist the type of the son, the chos en one, the se rvant who became the belove d of the Lord, was extant as a man, not merely as the lamb or the branch. It is the same type in the gos pels, which were written with reference all through to the figure that was pre - extant (Ps. II. 7, 12; Is. XLII. 1; Matt. III. 1 to 3). Moreove r, the same things were said of that type in the earlier as in the later time. He was equa lly the crucified or suffering Messiah; gall was given to him for meat, and vinegar for drink (Ps. LXIX. 21) . He was bound in his hands and feet; his garments were parted amongs t his spoi lers, who cast lots for his vesture (Ps. XXII. 18) . All that was fabled to have been historically acted at a later period had been already fulfilled with non - historical signi ficance. It is the same also with the charac ter of John the Baptist as with Jesus in the gos pels. In defiance of the fact that the event is cont empor ary with or had occurred previous ly in the prophe tic writings , the Christian world suppos es that the so - called prophe cies simply refer to a Messiah who is to com e in a “persona l and historical character.” Thus it is assum ed that the “prophe cy of"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Isaiah, “The voi ce of one that crieth, Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of the Lord! Make straight in the desert a highw ay for our God. Every valley shall be exalted and every mount ain and hill shall be made low , when the une ven shall be made level, and the rough places a plain, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed” (Is. XL. 3 - 5; Matt. III. 3); it is assum ed that this was historically fulfilled when the passage is quot ed in the gos pel according to Matthew and appl ied to John the Baptist, whereas the alleged history in the New Testament is based upon the suppos ed fulfilment of this prophe cy in the Old. Yet it is onl y a fragm ent repeated from the Egypt ian mythos , in which Anup was the crier in the wilderness and 522 the gui de in the ways of darkne ss through which the road was made from equi nox to equi nox in the desert of the unde r - world. When reduc ed to their prope r level, the elevation of the valley and the low ering of the mountain are but anot her mode of describing the equi noxe s. Anup was the precursor, the forerunne r, the prophe t of Horus the Lord who came in glory, and the preparer of his way. As such he appe ars in the ope ning chapter of the Ritual, wh ere we read, “O openers of roads! O gui des of paths to the soul made in the abode of Osiris (the hous e of heaven with thirty - six gates), ope n ye the roads! Level ye the paths of the Osiris.” That is, bring the lofty low in process of levelling or making th e road equa l in the moun t of the equi nox at the com ing of Horus the lord. Horus as lord of the two hor izons was Har - Makhu, lord of the equi noc tial level. At the time of the Easter equi nox the path was made level, the valley exalted, and the mount ain brough t low at the com ing of Har - Makhu who revealed the glory of the lord. If the Jews had onl y held on to the sons hip of Iu, the su or sif, they might have spoi led the market for the spur ious wares of the “historic” Saviour , and saved the world from wars innu m erable, and from count less broke n hearts and immeasurable mental misery. But they let go the sons hip of Hy with the grow th of their monol atry. They coul d not subs titute the “historic” sons hip; they had lost touc h with Egyp t, and the wisdom that might have set them right was no long er available against the Christian miscons truction. They failed to fight the battle of the gnos tics, and retired from the conf lict dour and dum b; strong and firm enough to suffer the blind and brutal Jude n - Hetze of all these centu ries, but pow erless to bring forward their natural allies the Egypt ian reserves, and helpless to conc lude a treaty or enforce a truce. The Jews have suffered and been damned along the line of 1,800 years on account of the false belief which they unw ittingl y helped to foster; and if they shoul d still suffer slinki ngl y for gross gains instead of turning round and rendi ng their persecutors and helping us to win the battle for uni versal freedom , when onc e the truth is made know n to them, they will, if such a fa te were pos sible, be deserving of eternal damnation in the Christian hell. The root age of matters like these lies out of sight , and is not to be bot tom ed in the Hebrew scriptures, but such passages as thos e quot ed show the existence of a god the father and a god the son. Not a son who is to be begot ten at som e future period by miraculous interpos ition of divine pow er playing pranks with hum an nature in a female form. The anoi nted son was then begot ten and already extant.

And on account of this langua ge in the Curs ing Psalms, as they have been called, the militant Christians have claimed a divine sanction for all their brutality in goi ng forth with fire and sword to blast the face of this fair earth and slay the utterly astoni shed natives of other lands who woul d no t or coul d not accept a doc trine so damnable as a revelation emanating from the most high God. The Psalmist celebrates this son of God, his begettal, his adve nt, but offers no real clue to the nature of the sons hip; and the Christians, know ing 523 not hin g of the astronom ical mythol ogy or of the Egypt ian eschatology, coul d onl y conc lude that it must be historical. No “Jewish monot heist” coul d expl icate the dua lity of the deity. The Psalmist celebrates the com ing of the Lord, but who the Lord is or what the adve nt may be it is impos sible to tell when the mythical backgr ound has been left out of view by the adapters of the ancient matter. As Egyptian, Iu the son is the ever - com ing one as the means by which the father of eternity manifests in time and other na tural phe nom ena. As Egypt ian, the divine dua d of father and son had been Ptah and Iu, or Atum and Iu, or Osiris and Horus, according to the cult through pre - Hebraic and pre - Christian ages. In Israel it might be Jacob - El the father, with Joseph - El as the be love d son; or Abraham with Isaac, the sacrificial son; or Ihuh and David, the divinely - begot ten son; or David and Solom on, the wise yout h and prince of peace. It has now to be show n that these two represent the father and his belove d son who are Ihuh and David in the book of Psalms. These are the two lords as the Lord and the Lord’s anoi nted in Psalm CX: “The Lord said unt o my Lord, sit thou at my right hand unt il I make thine enemies thy footstool . The Lord shall stretch forth the rod of thy strengt h out of Zion. In the beauty of hol iness from the wom b of the morning thou hast the dew of thy yout h. Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek” (Ps. CX. 4). That is the Lord who is the “com ing son” in all the so - called prophe cies; and David is t he son who thus conve rses with the father as Horus did with Ra, or as Jesus is represented in conve rse with Jehova h. As a divine persona ge David is a form of the belove d son; hence perhaps the origin of his name. David, Daoud , or Dood means the belove d; an d as a mythical character the belove d one, the Lord’s anoi nted, the Messiah, is the son of Ihuh, not the son of Jesse, who is not mentione d in the Psalms. This is the typi cal character with which we are now conc erned, the original in the mythos who afterwa rds became a subj ect for the popul ar märchen. The inscription on the Moabite Stone show s that the Israelites of the northern kingdom worshippe d a deity named Dodo or Dod (=David) by the side of Ihuh , “or rather they ador ed the supr eme god unde r the name of Dodo as well as unde r that of Ihuh” (Sayce, Hib. Lectures, pp. 56, 57) . Mesha, the Moabite king, announc es that he has carried away the altars of Dodo and “dragge d them before Chemosh,” Dodo and Ihuh being David and Ihuh as two divinities, or the one god in the dua l character of father and son. And if, like Jacob - El, Joseph - El, and Israel, David was a god , it follow s that the son assigne d to him as Solom on was so likewise. Only a divinity coul d be the prince of peace. Solom on was also a form of the divine son called the belove d. Hence the prophe t Nathan gives him the name of Jedidiah, the “belove d of the Lord” (II Sam. XII. 24, 25). And the belove d son was the messianic or anoi nted son."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":" In addi tion to the divine dua lity of father and son which was imaged i n Ptah and Kheper, Atum and Iu, Osiris and Horus, Ihuh, and Iah, and the Egypt o - gnos tic Ieou and Iao, there was a twofold nature manifested in the sons hip hum an and divine. This has been one of the most profound of the ancient and most perplexing of 524 mode rn mysteries. It is to the Egypt ian wisdom we must turn if we woul d trace the origin of this messianic mystery to the root in nature. But there is no beginni ng with the solar mythos . As it is said of Jesus, there are three which bear witness that the M essiah came in the water, in the blood, and in the spirit (I John V. 6, 7). As Egypt ian, the first was Horus who came by water in the inunda tion, the second was Horus who came in the blood of Isis, the third is Horus of the resurrection, who came again in the spirit; and, as Horus in these characters, “the three agree in one . The Book of the Dead describes the sour ce and origin of life as water and the water - plants. This was religious ly com memorated as a mystery of Amenta. The water - spring was imaged in the tuat of the nether - world, “which nobody can fathom ,” and the offerings of which are “edible plants” (Rit., ch. 172) , the water - plant being a form of primeval food. Thus Horus on his papyr us springi ng from the water represents the soul of life that came by water in or as primeval food. Hence he was depicted as the shoot . He woul d now be called the spirit of vegetation, born of water. Horus is also imaged as the child that issues from the plant or from the mother earth. The child= the shoot was typi cal of an ever - renewing and eternal yout h; hence Horus the eternal child. The Egypt ian “eternal” was æoni an and ever - com ing, whether figur ed by the shoot or as the child. Horus came by water annually, and brought abunda nt food. There was famine when the water failed , and therefore Horus as the spirit of vegetation was a kind of saviour to the world. He came from Ethiopi a as the messu. The messu in Egypt ian is the child, and Horus was the messu of the inunda tion, the water - born upon his papyr us, and an image of the so urce and sustenance of life bor n of a mother who was ever - virgin but non - human. Such is the root origin of the messianic mystery, and also of the mythical virgin and her ever - com ing child. But the ever - com ing child not onl y came by water. He also came by b lood as Horus who was incarnated in the blood of Isis. Thus Horus of the incarnation was the child that came by blood and was made flesh by her who doc trinally was the ever - virgin mother. This is the elder Horus, the eternal child of her who was know n to t he gnos tics as the eternal virgin. This dua lity in the sons hip of Horus has its origin in his twofold adve nt and his twofold character, which implied a twofold motherhood . In the first he was the child of the virgin mother as the soul of the mother onl y. I n the second he was Horus in spirit, the belove d onl y - begot ten son of the father in heaven, who was Ra the Holy Spirit. Horus in two of his characters is palpably depicted in the Hebrew scriptures. In the first he is Horus, who in the Ritual (ch. 115) is c alled the “Afflicted One.” This was the Horus of the incarnation, the god made flesh in the imperfect human form, the type of vol untary sacrifice, the image of suffering; being an innoc ent little child, maimed in the low er members, marred in his visage, la me and blind and dum b, and altoge ther imperfect. No man upon the cross or in the Tat - tree coul d ever make appe al to equa l this, the most pathetic picture in the world. And Horus, “lord of resurrections ” from the hous e of darkne ss (Rit., ch. 64) , who as the first “of them that"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"slept” woke up in death as the “soul most might y” and bur st the mum my - banda ges and rent the tom b asunde r and arose as Horus divinized, 525 the victor ove r death and hell and all the pow ers of evil, is the most trium pha nt figur e in th e world. A piteous por trait of the first Horus, the afflicted sufferer, is depicted by Isaiah. “Behol d, my servant shall deal wisely; he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high. Like as many were astoni shed at thee (his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men).” “Who hath believed our repor t? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? For he grew up before him as a tende r plant, and as a root out of a dry ground; he hath no form nor com eliness; and when we see him, there is no beauty that we shoul d desire him. He was despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrow s and acqua inted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised, and we esteemed him not . Surely he hath bor ne our griefs and carried our sorrow s, yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounde d for our trans gression s, he was bruised for our iniqui ties; the chas tisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. He was oppr essed, yet he hum bled himself and ope ned not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaught er, and as a sheep that before her shearers is dum b; yea, he ope ned not his mout h. And they made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his deaths. Thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin” (ch. 53) . The character here por trayed for the Messiah is that of the Messu - Horus in every feature, except that he was not “wounde d for our transgressions ” nor “bruised for our iniqui ties.” The Egypt ians were inde finitely older than the Semites, but had never heard of the world being lost by Adam’s fall, or its need of an historic saviour who shoul d take the place and act the part of the Jewish scapegoa t. The later doc trine of vicarious atone ment has been adde d . That is Semitic, not Egypt ian. Osiris of the mysteries was dramatically represented as a victim, but not as a vicarious sacrifice on account of hum an “transgressions ” or “iniqui ties.” Osiris, the good being, gave his life that men and animals might live, which was in providing the elements of water and food. This was com memorated in the sacramental meal, at which his body was eaten as the bread of life and his blood was drunk in the red wine or beer. The doc trine itself is inde finitely older. The Great Mo ther was imaged earlier still as the giver of life and sustenance in or as the tree by Hathor , who was imaged in the sycamore - fig as the tree of life, which was her body; and by the Cypr ian Venus, who was appa rently bound upon the tree. In neither case is there any doc trine of the scapegoa t, neither as animal, hum an being, or divine. Horus is said to be the altar and the offering in one , and a form of the altar is the tat. The tat - cross was the tree, whether of Hathor or Horus, of Osiris or Ptah. But there was no sufferer on it or in it who bor e the sins of the world. That is a doc trine of barbarous , non - Egypt ian igno rance, onl y fit for cow ards, slaves, and criminals. The onl y subs titution in the Osirian religion is when Horus becom es the vol unt ary subs titut e for the suffering god the father as a type of divine sons hip and an example for all men to follow in the war of good against evil. But there is no scapegoa t and no innoc ent victim of divine wrath, no expi atory sacrifice in the Egyp tian eschatology. That was a perversion"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"of the Egypt ian doc trine. There is a sacrificial victim as Child - Horus, but it was a vol unt ary sacrifice. 526 He com es to earth and takes upon himself the bur den of mortality, and is cons cious that he has to suffer and die in order that he may demonstrate the resurrection in spirit to the manes in Amenta and to men on earth. He com es as the calf of the sacrificial herd, and in a body that will be eaten at the sacramental meal (Rit., ch. 105 ). “In his deaths,” which are periodi c, he com es to an end on behalf of the father in heaven, at whos e table he will ultimately rest (Rit., ch. 70) . The elder Horus in the Osirian cult is that child of the virgin mother who in a second pha se and at the second adve nt is the father’s ow n begot ten and belov ed son, who takes upon himself to suffer in the father’s and the mother’s stead, not onl y in the phe nom ena of external nature, but also as a figur e of the hum an soul immersed in matter. This invol ved the doc trines of the incarnation, the virgin mother, bap tismal regeneration, the begettal of the anoi nted son as Horus of the resurrection, Horus the great judge , Horus the avenge r, Horus the spirit glorified in the likeness of the father. He dw elt on earth as mortal Horus in the house of Seb (earth) unt il he w as twelve years of age. He went dow n to Amenta as the hum an soul in death, or as the sun of winter sinki ng in the solstice. He rose again from the dead in search of his father, whom he had not know n on earth. The father, as Osiris in Amenta, had been ove rc om e by Sut, the pow er of darkne ss. Horus rises in Amenta as the avenge r; he rises as “the living soul ,” Horus who now com es in the spirit (Rit., ch. 5). He com es to see Osiris and to drive away the darkne ss (ch. 9). He com es as the belove d son to seek for Sut, the adve rsary of Osiris, in the nether earth, and pierce him to the heart (ch. 11) . The teaching of the Ritual is that sacrifice was of a twofold nature. In one aspect of the doc trine it was vol unt ary, in the other it was venge ful and piacular. This d octrine was brought on at second - hand in Rom e as the bloody and unbl oody sacrifice, bot h being associated with one victim there instead of two. But as Egypt ian there were two, one innoc ent and one gui lty. Osiris or Child - Horus of the mysteries was the vol u ntary victim of the unbl oody sacrifice, and Sut the victim of the venge ful sacrifice that is celebrated in the Ritual on the night of the great slaught er and the manur ing of the fields with blood. Osiris was the vol unt ary sacrifice. He was the god who gave himself in all the elements of life that all his creatures might have life. He came to earth or manifested in the water, and in flesh and blood, in vegetation and cultivated corn, or, more abstractly, as the bread from heaven. For the later provi dence was imaged in som e likeness of the primitive provi der. Hence Osiris is depicted as the wet - nur se with a myriad mammæ. The Great Mother as the bringe r of plenty might be supe rseded toge ther with her seven cow s, and Isis, the good lady, by Osiris as Un - Nefer, t he good being, with whom she was uni ted in one ; but still the figur e of food and drink remained as an eternal type , when the god gave “the food that never perishes” by the incorpor ation, or the later incarnation, of himself. This was the vol unt ary victim w ho was made a sacrifice in the Osirian mysteries. As represented, he was slain by Sut, the leader of the evil pow ers, on the night of the great battle. Then follow s the vast venge ful sacrifice of Sut and his co - cons pirators, who in the form of the Typhon ia n animals were slain upon the highw ay of the damned so long as there was any blood to flow ."},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":" 527 The venge ful sacrifice is also show n when Apap, the enemy of Ra, is slain. It is said, “Apap is stricken with swords; he is sacrificed” (Book of Hades, Recor ds, vol . XII). Horus the child was the typi cal babe and suckling that was accredited with a revelation beyond the range of hum an faculty conc erning things that were hidde n from the wise and unde rstandi ng. That was in a mystery, not meant for an apot heosis of infants or simpletons and bibliolaters. Horus the hum an was the child, and the divine Horus was the prince, the repa with the kingl y count enance; and these are allude d to disparagingl y by Iahu when he says of the peopl e of Israel, “I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule ove r them” (Is. III. 4). Hum an Horus came to earth in the character of a little child, a type of gentleness otherwise figur ed as a lamb or a calf. This typi cal little child is described by Isaiah in his millenni al account of the Messiah who came periodi cally as the bringe r of peace, Iu - em - hetep or Horus, or the Hebrew Mes - Iah, which is equi valent to Mes - Iu the com ing child in Egypt ian, who is otherwise the Iu - su, son of Atum and Ius ā as. “And the wolf shall dw ell wit h the lamb, and the leopa rd shall lie dow n with the kid; and the calf and the young lion falling toge ther; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young one s shall lie dow n toge ther; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hol e of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder’s den. They shall not hur t nor destroy in all my hol y mount ain” (Is. XI. 6, 9). This little child was the hum an Horus in the Egypt ian myth os. The tende r plant that springs up out of the dry ground, in the prophe cy of Isaiah, is also represented bot h in the Osirian religion and in the earlier cult of Atum - Ra. Horus, the branch, or natzer, was the branch of the unbu or gol den bough. The speake r in this character says (Rit., ch. 71, Renouf ), “I am unbu of An - ar - f, the flow er in the abode of occultation. ” An - ar - f denot es the abode of the sight less Horus, who was encircled by darkne ss and obs curity. It was there, in a waste place where not hing gre w, that the gol den unbu , or gol den bou gh, bur st into blossom as the living shoot from out the soil or the annua lly decaying tree of vegetable life, as offspring of the sun. Child - Horus as the natzer or Messiah was the “tende r plant” that literally grew up “as a root out of a dry ground. ” As the plant of Anrutef he is root ed in the dry desert (Rit., ch. LXXI; cf. Is. LVIII. 11) which precedes the place of emergence from Amenta in the east. The dry ground was intensely actual in Egypt at the time of the winte r solstice, when the land was left waterless. It was the season of com ing drought that was reflected in the wilderness of Anrutef, through which the suffering sun god had to pass. It was there that Isis sought the water of life which was imaged as her lost Osiris. In this desert Horus suffered his great thirst, and here he sprang up as the tende r plant from a root in the dry ground when nour ished at the breasts of his mother. He had no form of com eliness, because he was that amorphous produc t of the virgin that lacked the soul and seal of the authenticating fatherhood which conf erred the grace and favour upon Horus the divinized adul t. This was the hum an Horus who was but human in the way already indi cated as the maimed, crippl ed, shapeless, dum b, blind, imp ube scent produc t of the mother nature onl y. It was the ancient Child - Horus who was cont inue d in the catacom bs 528"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":" as the little old and ugl y Christ. “He hath no form nor com eliness” (says Isaiah), “and when we see him there is no beauty that we shoul d de sire him; as one from whom men hide their face he was despised.” Or as one who hid his face from men. The man of sorrow s who had neither form nor com eliness was but a typi cal, not a natural man, still less an historic persona ge who hid his face and ope ned not his mout h; and the type was identical with that amorphous birth of the gnos tic Sophi a which she produc ed when flow ing away into immensity unt il she was crossed and stayed by Stauros, who stoppe d the issue of blood. Both were the same as the imperfect, inarticulate child of Isis. The tende r plant of Isaiah is one with Horus the shoot , who is also called a plant out of the Nun. The Hebrew man of sorrow s is thus doubl y identified with the hum an Horus, and onl y in the hum an Horus do we reach the genesis in nature of that Jesus who was reput ed to have been bor n of flow ing not of conc reted blood. For mystical reasons this was the child who never coul d becom e a man, and never did; the typi cal victim of this sacrifice always remained a child. And because the Hor us was but a type , he coul d be represented by the red shoot , the red fruit, the red calf or lamb, the red crow n, or the red sun as sufferer in the winter solstice. Various type s of this meek and low ly Horus made divine appe al to hum an tende rness and melted their way to the heart on behalf of the suffering mother and her dear, deaf, dum b, and sight less little one , the child of silence who was her Logos in sign - langua ge. The dua lity represented by Horus the Messiah in his twofold character is described in th e Ritual from the root. This is the chapter (Renouf , 115) by which the manes com eth forth into heaven, or the Child - Horus change s into the Arm of the Lord, the mortal Horus into Horus the immortal. The speaker says, “I know the pow ers of Annu. Doth not the all - pow erful issue forth like one who extende th a hand to us? It is with reference to me the gods say, Lo the Afflicted One, who is the heir of Annu! I know on what occasion the lock of the male - child was made. Ra was speaking with Amhauf, and a blindne ss came upon him. Ra said to Amhauf, Take the spear, O offspring of men. And Amhauf said, “The spear is taken.” Whatsoever the meaning of this instruction, the result was that “two brethren came into being. They were Heb - Ra and Sotemanes, whos e arm resteth n ot. As Child - Horus, he assum ed the form of a female with the lock, which became the lock in Annu . Sotemanes is an image of Horus as the arm of Osiris. This is the arm that takes the spear to wield the weapon might ily. The Child - Horus might be of either sex , and the lock of childhood was worn by him as the type of bot h sexes. In his condi tion of blindne ss Horus of the lock was the afflicted one , but he is still the heir of Annu. That is the city where the transformation takes place in the temple. “Active and pow erful is the heir of the temple, the active one of Annu. The flesh of his flesh is the all - seer, for he hath the might divine as the son whom the father hath begot ten. And his will is that of the might y one of Annu” (Gr. Heliopol is). This, we repeat, i s the account given by the Ritual conc erning the origin of the divine duality that was manifested in the doubl e Horus, as the child of twelve years and the adul t of thirty years, the wearer of the lock and the victorious lifter of the arm. Now , Horus in t hese two characters can be as clearly traced in 529 "},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"the Psalms as he is described in the Ritual. As Horus the hum an, he is the child with the side - lock, the afflicted one , the maimed, dum b, and blind sufferer who is persecuted by Sut. As Horus divinized, Horus the king’s heir, “he hath the might divine as the son whom the father hath begot ten” — that is, begot ten in spirit for the resurrection from the dead. This is he whom the Psalmist celebrates: “My heart ove rflow eth with a goodl y matter: I speak the thi ngs which I have made touc hing the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is pour ed into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O might y one , thy glory and t hy majesty. And in thy majesty ride on prosperous ly. Thou hast love d right eous ness and hated wickedne ss: therefore God, thy God, hath anoi nted thee with the oil of gladne ss above thy fellow s” (Ps. XLV. 1 - 9). This in the original was Horus the anoi nted, the son of god , the oil of gladne ss on whose face was typi cal of his divinity. The person addr essed in the 45th Psalm is also recogni zable as “the roya l Horus,” Horus of the beautiful count enance. The Psalmist cont inues: “All thy garments (smell of) myrrh and aloes and cassia; out of ivory palaces stringe d instrum ents have made thee glad. Kings ’ daught ers are among thy honour able wom en: at thy right hand dot h stand the que en in gol d of Ophi r” (Ps. XLV. 2, 9). Isaiah has likewise reproduc ed a portrait of Har - Te ma the might y avenge r in his second adve nt, who came at the end and re - beginni ng of the period which is called the year of redemption: “Who is this that com eth from Edom , with garments crimson from Bozrah; he that is glorious in his appa rel, marching in th e greatness of his strengt h, might y to save?” “Wherefore art thou red in thine appa rel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine - vat?” “I have trodde n the wine - press alone ; and of the peopl e there was no man with me: yea, I trod them in mine ang er and trampled them in my fury: and their life - blood is sprinkl ed upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment. For the day of venge ance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemer is com e. I looke d, and there was none to help; and I wonde red if t here was none to uphol d; therefore my ow n arm wrought salvation unt o me, and my fury it uphe ld me; and I trod dow n the peopl e in my ange r and made them drunk in my fury, and I pou red out their life - blood on the earth” (Is. LXIII. 1 - 6). This in the original is magni ficent; in its perversion it is bewildering, but no bibliolater coul d pos sibly have know n what it was about . Hence the ende avour to make it a matter of prophe cy by means of marginal misinterpretation; a feast of venge ance for good Christians to lo ok forward to at the second com ing of their long - belated Lord. It is not prophe cy: it has no other meaning and had no other origin than that of the Egyp tian mythology and the mysteries of Amenta. Horus in his hum an persona tion was the mother’s suffering so n, the victim as described by Isaiah (chs. LII, LIII) and by the Psalmist as the sacrificial victim in the present, not in a future, near or far (Ps. XXII. 17, 18; XXXI. 5; XLI. 9; LXIX. 21) . After his death, a representative of the Osiris rises again triu mpha nt as the maker of justice visible. He doe s not merely speak of right eous ness. He is the just and right eous judge who doe s justice in the judgm ent hall of Maati on the 530 day of doom . As the divine avenge r of the suffering Osiris or the hum an Horus he arises in the person of the red god , who is thus addr essed: “O fearsom e one , thou who art ove r the two earths, red god who orderest the block of execution, to whom the doub le crow n is"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"given,” as Horus at his second com ing (Rit., ch. 17). He com es back i n his second adve nt as the lifter of the arm, great in his glory, as wearer of the doubl e crow n, the terrible avenge r of the wrongs that were inflicted by the wicked on the suffering Osiris, or on hum anity in that appe aling and pathetic representative in t he god of hum anity who gave himself a sacrifice to show the way that others might have life. The way of salvation was revealed by the hum an Horus being divinized in death, and emerging as an immortal on the hor izon of the resurrection, safe beyond the vall ey of the shadow and the darkne ss of Sheol. The drama from which scenes are given in the Hebrew writings , as if these things occurred or woul d occur upon the earth, belongs to the mysteries of the Egypt ian Amenta, and onl y as Egypt ian coul d its characters ever be unde rstood. We have to bear in mind that the typi cal teacher of Israel is alleged to have been learned in all the wisdom of the Egypt ians. Unfortuna tely, the key of the Mosaic writings was mislaid, and the Bible has becom e a lock - up of bonda ge for the prisone rs of the Christian faith. Isaiah asks, “Who hath believed that which we have hard, and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?” To none , we reply, save thos e who kno w the god who lifted up the arm in death, who bared the hol y arm in ret ribut ion, and who wrought salvation with it for the oppr essed who suffered from the adve rsaries in Amenta. Horus - Amsu is the god who upl ifts the arm of Osiris the lord, which he has freed from the swathings of the mum my as he rises from the tom b. The bur ie d Osiris represented the god in matter, the earthly half of the divinity, so to say, earth being termed his body and heaven his soul . Hence he is imaged by one arm, one leg, one side. Hence also the typi cal right and left arms. Osiris bur ied in Sekhe m is r epresented with the left arm still bound and pow erless. Horus in his resurrection is the right arm that was lifted when he had bur st the bonds of death and got the better of Sut as conque ror of the grave and manifestor in phe nom ena both natural and eschato logi cal for the father in Amenta, the father of eternity, or the eternal father, he whos e son was manifestor by periodi c repetition in the sphe re of time. The tat - type of suppor t and stability on which all rested in Tattu is said to be the arm or shoul der of Horus in Sekhe m (Rit., 18) , whos e figur e with the fan or khu in his right hand will show us how the gove rnm ent was on his shoul der. The abstract langua ge of the Jewish writings takes the place of the earlier conc rete representation and the Egypt ian sym b ol, which were figur es of the facts that dislimn and ultimately fade away in words. Amsu - Horus, who rises from the grave in Amenta with his right arm freed from the mummy - swathe, is designa ted the “lifter of the arm,” and in this conn ection we may com pare a Fijian bur ial custom . When a hero or distingui shed “brave” is buried, the body is interred with the right arm lifted up above the moul d of the grave mound. The peopl e passing by, on seeing this, exclaim, “Oh, the hand that was the slayer of men” (Lorimer Fison, “Notes on Fijian Burial Custom s,” 531 Jour nal of the Anthropol ogi cal Institute ). The natural fact was first rende red in sign - langua ge, and this suppl ied the type to the mythical or eschatologi cal pha se. The Fijian custom show s the figur e, straight from nature, of the arm - lifter as the conque ror in life thus imaged memorially in death; Amsu - Horus is the lifter of his right arm as the victor ove r death. Such a custom is by no means “gha stly” when interpreted by the Egypt ian wisdom , but a mode of hono uring the brave spirit, which in Amsu - Horus is exhi bited as trium pha nt ove r death and all the ills of mortality, as the arm of the lord, the conque ror of"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"his father’s enemies, trium pha nt ove r death and the grave. It was Amsu - Horus who “hath show ed strengt h with his arm,” for he has wrenched and raised it from the leaden grasp of the bur ial - place and the bonda ge of the mummy, holding aloft the sign of rule and gove rnm ent as the expr ess image of pot ency personified. Amsu persona tes the “arm of the lord” out st retched from the mum my of matter. He is called the arm - raiser, and through his pot ency the other arm bound up in the mum my case is set free, and the Osiris emerges pur e spirit, with both arms intact and bot h feet in motion. “Behol d,” says the prophe t; “Beh old, the Lord God will com e as a might y one , and his arm shall rule for him” (Is. XL. 10). In this aspect he com es as the good shephe rd. “He shall feed his flock like a shephe rd; he shall gather the lambs in his arm and carry them in his bos om , and gently lead thos e that are with young” (Is. XL. 11). This was Horus the lifter of his arm for Osiris, upon whos e shoul der rested the insigni a of his gove rnm ent, which include d the whip (or flail) and the shephe rd’s crook . As the Good Shephe rd Horus tends the shee p of his father, and com es to gather them in his fold. He was personi fied as the delegated pow er that drove with the whip and drew them with the hek of rule, which became the shephe rd’s crook. The por trait of Horus the good shephe rd, who was likewise the a rm of the lord in this picture of pastoral tende rness, was readapted by the Hebrew writer for the com forting of distressed Jerusalem. The character and the picture belong to the Amenta in the Ritual, and these have been represented as if belongi ng to this earth, whereas the good shephe rd and the sheep, the fields of peace and pastures of plenty beside the still waters, pertain to hetep, the paradise of peace. Of the “prince of peace,” who is proclaimed by Isaiah as hav ing com e (he came annually or periodi ca lly in the mythos ), it is said, “The gove rnm ent shall be upon his shoul der” (ch. 9, 6). So was it with the Egypt ian prince of peace as Horus the “sustainer of his father.” On the night of setting up the tat and of establishing Horus in the place of the dea d Osiris Horus takes the gove rnm ent upon his shoul der. It is said, “The setting up of the tat (of stability) means the shoul der of Horus” — that is, the shoul der with which he sustains the gove rnm ent (Rit., ch. 18) . In this sense he was the arm of the lord, “the lifter of the arm,” called “the avenge r of that left arm of Osiris which is in Sekhe m.” Horus images the mum my - Osiris in the resurrection. With the right arm lifted he wields the sceptre of his pow er that signi fies his trium ph ove r death and hell and the grave; he also bears the sign of gove rnm ent upon his other shoul der. What a por trait of level - brow ed justice is that of Amsu - Horus, who is 532 described as the god “whos e eyebrow s are like the two arms of the balance (or scales) upon that day when ou trage is brought to account and each wrong is tied up to its separate block of settlement” (ch. 17) . This is the judge in person of the son, the god who lifteth up his arm, and who is the arm of the lord made manifest for the execution of justice. And this is the arm of the lord invoke d for the same pur pos e by Isaiah, which alone expl ains the expr ession, “Mine arm shall judge the peopl es.” The veil of words in the Hebrew cons tantly conc eals the wisdom of the Egypt ians that lies beyond it in the Jewish scrip tures, and this is the rendi ng of the veil. One needs must obs erve in passing that if the divine victim and the redemption from sin were historical and onc e for all, these must certainly have already taken place when Isaiah wrote; and if it had been onc e"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"f or all it coul d not have occurred onc e afterwards. Besides, the same victim is described in the Psalms as suffering or having suffered as the same sacrifice. And how the Sarkol atræ have gloated and are gloating ghoul - like ove r this cow ardly doc trine of the divine victim suffering in a hum an form to ransom the gui lty with the blood of the innoc ent, and save them from Nemesis of natural law and the cons eque nces of their ow n sins. But we have to do with no historical transactions , prophe tic or fulfilled. Horus is described in the Ritual (ch. 17) as making his first and second adve nt in the two characters of blind Horus (An - maati) and Horus the avenge r or recons tituter of his father. These two forms of the Messiah, the founde r and fulfiller of the kingdom of hea ven on behalf of the father, can now be traced in the Hebrew scriptures, especially in the books of the Psalms, Isaiah, Zechariah, and Daniel. Mortal Horus in his hum anity was bor n as the servant. He was the divine heir in the likeness of the child that fr om the earliest totemic times was bor n to be a servant or a slave, which was its natural status. He is por trayed as blind and deaf and dum b. This is the com ing Messiah described by Isaiah as the servant who is blind and dead and dum b. “As a lamb that is le d to the slaught er, and as a sheep that before her shearers is dum b” (LIII. 7). “Who is blind as my servant, or deaf as my messenge r that I send? Who is blind as he that is made perfect, and yet is blind as the Lord’s servant?” (ch. 42). As was Horus the c hild, who suffered in his mortality as the servant and was deaf and dum b and blind in the earth of Seb to attain the beatific vision of the Horus perfected in spirit. The blind messenge r described by Isaiah is the sight less Horus, whos e zoot ype was the mol e or shrewmous e because it was an eyeless digge r unde rground, and therefore a likeness of Horus in the darkne ss of the nether earth. Hum an Horus, called the elder because the first bor n, and who “had no form nor com eliness,” was the virgin’s amorphous chil d. Horus divinized was the god with the beautiful face, who was “fairer than the children of men,” and bloom ing with eternal yout h as the type of immortality. In the Jewish traditions conc erning the Com ing One we find the doc trine of a Messiah in two aspec ts: in one character he was bor n to suffer, in the other he was destined to trium ph. In the one he is identical with the maimed and suffering 533 Horus, in the other with the victorious Har - Tema. In the first he was to com e as Joseph’ s son, who woul d mak e war on the adve rsary and himself be slain (as was the elder Horus) at Jerusalem. Then the second Messiah, called the son of David, was to defeat the enemy, called by the Gentiles Antichrist, and, according to the solar imagery employe d, cons um e him with the breath of his mouth. This cons um mation was to be on the grandl y inde finite scale, but the tradition preserves details of the annual representation. When Messiah came as conque ror in the glory of his strengt h there was to be a reign of nine months. At t he end of the nine mont hs, Messiah Ben - Joseph was to be revealed — that is, the sufferer who was foredoom ed to fall, and who was follow ed by the Messiah Ben - David, who was destined to succeed. Now , the annua l cycle in the Kamite mythos was divided into nine mont hs and three. The elder Horus was bor n about the time of the winter solstice, answering to the birth of Christ at Christmas. This is a form of the victim who was slain or blinde d by Sut the prince of darkne ss. Three months afterwards the risen Horus wa s revealed upon the mount of glory as the vanqui sher of Sut. And after his reincarnation it"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"was nine mont hs before the next rebirth at Christmas. Thus the circle was com pleted bot h in time and space according to the facts in nature upon which the myth was founde d ( Avkath Rochel apud Huls., pp. 22, 23, 35, 36; Eisenm enge r, Ende cktes Jude nthum ), and the two births or adve nts of Messiah Ben - Joseph and Messiah Ben - David, at the end of nine mont hs, and again at the end of three, are exactly the same as the adve n t of the elder Horus in the winter solstice and the second com ing of Horus trium pha nt in or follow ing the vernal equi nox. So necessary is the moul d of the astronom ical mythol ogy for unde rstandi ng the eschatology, whether we call it Jewish, Egypt ian, or Chr istian. It is the ruler for one year in the solar mythos that will account for “the year of the Lord” which was “the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of venge ance of our God” proclaimed in Israel by Isaiah (Is. LXI. 2). But the doc trine of a com ing Messiah who came to rule for one year has no meaning apart from the mythos , in which the com ing was annua l, whether as Horus of the inunda tion or as Iu the youthful solar god . It was this reign of Messiah on the scale of one year that beque athed the tradit ion of the one year’s ministry of Jesus re - announc ed by Luke (IV. 19) from Isaiah. The gnos tics Ptolemæus and Herakleon, also the Christians Clement Alexande r and Origen, who were bot h from Egypt , held this view of the reign that lasted onl y one year. And it was this founda tion in the mythical representation which has made it impossible to bui ld the gos pel history on any other basis, or to conc lusively define any other lengt h of time for “our Lord’s publ ic ministry.” Whether written by Paul or not , the Epi stle to the Hebrews cont ains the Egypt o - gnos tic doc trine of the Christ which was taught by Paul in accordance with “the beginni ng of the first principles of the oracles of God” — that is, of the divine wisdom which was com muni cated in the mysteries, and in w hich Paul was an adept and perfect. This, for example, is a brief sketch of the twofold Horus who suffered as Horus in his mortality and ove rcame as Horus in spirit, who persona tes the redeemer from death. This was he “who in the days 534 of his flesh, h aving offered up prayers and suppl ications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his god ly fear, though he was a son, yet learned he obe dience by the things which he suffered: and having been made perfect, he became unt o all them that obe y him the author of eternal salvation” (Heb. V. 7). This in the Egypt ian was the maimed and suffering hum an Horus who was saved from death in becom ing the anoi nted son, the glorified sahu, the spirit perfected, the typi cal initiator into an existence hereafter that was called salvation to eternal life. The change from Horus the mortal to Horus in spirit is plainly described by Isaiah (XLII). “Behol d my servant whom I uphol d, my chos en in whom my soul delight eth; I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgm ent to the nation. He shall bring forth judg ment in truth.” The meek and low ly one , the virgin’s lamb, the suffering Messiah, was Horus in a maimed and most imperfect hum an form. This was the typi ca l sufferer for the mother and the servant of the Lord, who in his change d and glorified estate became the onl y - begot ten from the father; his belove d son. The spirit of God was “put upon him” when he was a divine hawk of soul or became dove - headed; and he w ho was so dum b and gentle that he woul d not break a bruised reed was transformed"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"into the Horus who as Tema was the terrible judge , the red god, and as Horus - Makhe ru the judge in very truth. It was on the mount of glory in the east, the mount that rose up from Amenta, that Messiah in his second adve nt came in the glory of his father with his ange ls, who were represented as spirits of fire in attenda nce on the sun or solar god . This in the annua l fulfilment was in the vernal equi nox , at the poi nt where the two earths were uni ted in one . It is also said in the Talmud (Talmud, Cod. Sanhe drin, ch. 3, p. 38) that the Messiah called the son of David “will not com e till the two hous es of Israel shall be extinct.” Here the two hous es answer to the doub le hor izons i n the Egypt ian mythos which were uni ted and made one in the new heaven and earth established at the adve nt of Horus Sam - taui, the uni ter of the two hous es of the doubl e earth. The follow ing “prophe cy” cont ains an appe al to the father god on behalf of the a noi nted son. “Give the king thy judgm ents, O God, and thy right eous ness unt o the king’s son. He shall judge thy peopl e with right eous ness, and thy poor with judg ment. The mount ains shall bring peace to the peopl e. He shall break in pieces the opp ressor. In his days shall the right eous flour ish, and abunda nce of peace. . . . All kings shall fall dow n before him. All nations shall serve him. There shal l be abundanc e of corn in the earth upon the top of the mount ains, and the fruit thereof shall shake like Leb anon. And they of the city shall flour ish like grass of the earth. His name shall endure for ever; his nam e shal l be cont inue d as long as the sun, and men shall be blessed in him; all nations shall call him happy” (Ps. LXXII). The reign of justice, law, an d right eous ness was renewed at the adve nt of the prince, the repa or heir - appa rent, who came to represent the father god. The maat or hall of justice was erected on the plain as the seat of Har - Tema the great judge . The kingdom or hous e of heaven was refou nde d for the father onc e a year by Horus, or by Jesus, the Messiah - son. It was 535 founde d upon the four qua rters, which were represented by the four mystical creatures, by four flag - staffs or pillars, or by the four fold Cross of the tat. Horus is descr ibed in bot h characters by Zechariah at the second com ing. “And they shall look unt o him whom they pierced, and they shall mour n for him as one mour neth for his onl y son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first - born” (Zech. XII. 10, 11) . He is to com e in the “day of the Lord,” to fight the battle called the battle of Har - Magedon in Revelation, which was fough t annua lly in the astronom ical mythol ogy. Har - Makhu was the ancient Horus of bot h horizons , more exactly of bot h equi noxe s, and most exactly of the doubl e earth that was uni ted annua lly in one at the eastern equi nox upon the Mount of Olives, or Bakhu in Egyp tian. Person, place, event, and circum stances are all the same as in the original. This is the avenge r Har - Mak hu, otherwise described as Har - Tema, executor and executione r of divine justice in the maat upon the moun t of glory. And it is to be as in the previous manifestations . They shall look upon him whom they had pierced. In the Kamite representation Horus came periodi cally in the vernal equi nox as the king’s son, who was called the prince of eternity, the roya l Horus, Horus of the kingl y count enance, now made judge of all the earth. He took his seat upon the sum mit; the balance was erected in the hall of right eo usness or of maat, where judgm ent was delivered and unde viating justice done ."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"But this was the annua l assizes of “all soul s” held in the earth of eternity, not in Jude a nor the earth of time. Isaiah foretells that in the great day that will com e there is t o be “a vineyard of wine”: “sing ye of it. I the Lord do keep it night and day.” “And in the mount ain shall the Lord of hos ts make unt o all peoples a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined” (Is. XXV. 6 and XXVII. 2, 3). And the com ing, which was actual in Egypt , and was celebrated yearly with the Uaka or Nile festival, is to be fulfilled at som e inde finite future time that was chiefly know n to prophe cy as the day of doom and the end ing of the world. The vine and fig were two especial forms of the typical tree in the garden of Hetep, Aarru, or Eden. According to the prophe cy of Micah, every man was to sit beneath his ow n vine and fig - tree in the paradise of peace, with none to make t hem afraid (IV. 4). But this garden of the gods and the glorified, which is relegated to the future by the biblical writers, had been planted by the Egyp tians in a far - off past. The vine and sycamore - fig were two type s in the Kamite paradise. In the papyr u s of Nu he prays that he may sit unde r his ow n vine and also beneath the refreshing foliage of the sycamore - fig tree of Hathor. The garden of Aarru is a garden of the grape, and the god Osiris is som etimes seated in a Naos unde rneath the vine, from which b unc hes of grapes are hangi ng. Moreove r, Osiris was the vine, and his son Horus - unbu is the branch. The solar mount was called the mount of glory. This is in accordance with the natural fact. It is the same in the Hebrew writings . The mount of God in Exodus is the mount of glory. It is called the mount of the glory of God: “The glory of the Lord abode upon Mount 536 Sinai” (Ex. XXIV. 16). The solar nature of the glory is appa rent in certain passages. “The glory of the Lord went up and stood upon the mounta in which is on the east side of the city” (Ez. XI. 23). This identifies the solar mount of glory. “And in appe arance the glory of the Lord was like devour ing fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel” (Ex. XXIV. 17). The law was gi ven to Israel on the mount in the shape of the Com mandm ents, that were written on two tablets. This corresponds to the law of maati given in the great judgm ent hall upon the mount of glory at the place of equi librium , or the scales of justice in the equi no x. The two tablets image the dua lity of maati, or the twofold law and justice. The mount is identified with the Egypt ian judgm ent - seat by the statement made to Moses in the mount : “Now these are the judgm ents which thou shalt set before them” (Ex. XXI. 1) — these being the laws distingui shed from the Ten Com mandm ents. The maat was the judgm ent - seat, the great hall, the place or city of truth and right eous ness. The scales of justice were periodically erected on the mount , whether at the vernal equi nox in the s olar mythos or at the pol e in the earlier stellar representation. Hence the appl ication of the maat to Jerusalem by Zechariah. “Jerusalem shall be called the city of truth (maati), and the moun tain of the Lord of hos ts the hol y mount ain” (Zech. VIII. 3, 4) . The Lord, he com eth, “He com eth to guide the earth; he shall judge the world with right eous ness; right eous ness and judgm ent are the founda tion of his throne ” (Ps. XCVI and XCVII). These are the founda tion of maati, truth, right eous ness, law, and justice all being expr essed by the one word maati. The doc trine of maati coul d not be more perfectly illustrated than it is in Psalm XLV. 6. “Thy throne , O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of equi ty is the sceptre of thy kingd om .” From the time of Tum, i.e. At um -"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"Iu, the Egypt ian one god was the deity of justice, truth, and right eous ness. He is still the god of maat or maati, which has the meaning of law, truth, justice, and right . In this wise the mythos and the eschatology of Egyp t were converted into matter o f prophe cy that was to be fulfilled on earth as the mode of future realization. The mythical moun t is also typi cal of two different characters, female and male: one was the mount of earth, the other the mount of heaven. The worship of the Great Mother nev er died out whol ly with the children of Israel. The high places, the asherim, the sacred prostitutes, the heifer, the sow , and other type s were inde structible, all the Protestantism and Puritanism of the monot heists not withstandi ng. Hence we are told, as s om ething very terrible, that Solom on bui lt a temple to Ashtoreth “on the right hand of the mount of corrupt ion” (II Kings XXIII. 13) , the mount of the Great Mother. The female nature of the moun t of earth was show n when the Lord “cove red the daught er of Zi on with a cloud in his ange r and cast dow n the beauty of Israel,” and is said to have “forgot ten his foot stool .” She was the foot stool of Ihuh as a type of the earth - mother, just as Isis is the seat of Osiris. There is a general casting out of the divine m otherhood by the Hebrew writers, especially unde r the type of the female mount . For the Lord of hos ts was to reign in Mount Zion after the casting out of the wom an Wickedne ss, whos e emblem was an abom ination in all the earth (Is. XXIV. 23) . “Behol d, I am a gainst 537 thee, O destroyi ng mount ain, saith the Lord. I will make thee a bur nt mount ain. . . . Thou shalt be desolate for ever” (Jer. LI. 25). “O my mount ain in the field, I will give thy subs tance and all thy treasures for a spoi l, and thy high places , because of sin through out all thy borders” (Jer. XVII. 3). This was the moun t of earth and of the motherhood, and the seat of the Great Mother in the moun t of earth or Jerusalem below is now to be supe rseded by the throne of God most high in the hol y mou nt of Jerusalem above . The change is described in the book of Zechariah. Jerusalem that was forsaken in one sense, and her mount of the motherhood cast dow n, is to be restored to Israel, in anot her character, by the erection of anot her mount and sanctuary. “Thus saith the Lord: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my hous e shall be bui lt in it. The Lord shall yet com fort Zion, and shall yet choos e Jerusalem” (Zech. I. 17). The mother in the earlier cult was cast out and her seat denounc ed as the mount o f corrupt ion because she had been worshippe d and fecunda ted beneath every green tree on this mons veneris of the earth (II Kings XXIII. 13) , in all the high places that were cons ecrated to Ashtoreth and the asherim, as the mount of the mother. This was the hill of Jerusalem on which her whor edom s were com mitted by the daught er of Zion (Is. X. 32) . It is the hill of Esau, and of her “that dw elt in the clefts of the rock” as the old earth - mother, who was now to be swept away in the com ing day of the Lord, the mount ain that before Zerubba bel was to becom e a plain for the founda tion of a new hous e of heaven (Zech. IV. 7). The preparations for the bui lding – the four hor ns or corners, the four smiths, the man with a measuring - line in his hand – show that the new Jeru salem signi fied is celestial or astronom ical. It is to be bui lt by Zerubba bel, whos e hands “have laid the founda tions of this hous e.” The mount that had been is to be levelled by him and becom e a plain. This was the mount of the wom an called Wickedne ss, wh ose emblem was to be remove d to the land of Shinar, where her hous e was to be bui lt, and when it was established she was"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"to be set upon her ow n base. The new hous e of heaven or the new Jerusalem is bui lt upon the mount ain of the Lord, who is about to bring forth his servant, the Branch. And now we learn that, not withstandi ng the historic - looki ng instructions given by “the word of the Lord to Zerubba bel” conc erning the building, the actual bui lder is the man whos e name is the Branch. “Thus speaketh the Lord of hos ts, saying, Behol d the man whos e name is the Branch; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall bui ld the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne ; and he shall be a priest upon his throne , and the couns el of peace shall be between them bot h” (Zech. VI. 12, 13) . As Egypt ian, this bui lder of the temple was Iu - em - hetep, the prince of peace. In one of its various meanings the word hetep signi fies gathering and uni ting toge ther. Hence hetep is the mo unt of congr egation. This was cont inue d as a Hebrew title of the mount . Isaiah identifies “the mount of congr egation,” or place of gathering toge ther, as the mount in the uttermost parts of the north — that is, with the sum mit of rest at the celestial pol e ( Is. XIV. 13) . As is said by the Psalmist, “The wicked shall not stand in the judgm ent nor sinne rs in the congr egat ion of the right eous ” (Ps. I. 5). “In the 538 midst of the congr egation will I praise thee” (Ps. XXII. 22) . “God stande th in the congr egat io n of God; he judge th amongs t the gods ” (Ps. LXXXII. 1). The final landi ng - place in the Egypt ian paradise, where the soul s of the departed reach an anchor age in the still waters of hetep or peace eternal in the heavens, is a divine district called “the isle of corn and barley” (Rit., ch. 110) . This was attainable onl y at the sum mit of Mount Hetep, the mount of peace and everlasting plenty in the circum pol ar paradise, not on any local mount of Zion in Jude a or in Palestine, although it was thus literalized in the biblical prophe cies. The great and glorious good time com ing for the Egypt ians was not in this life nor the present world. It was in the heaven of eternity. It was a picture of the paradise awaiting the blessed dead. This was por trayed twice ove r; onc e in the nether earth of the solar mythos , onc e in the highe st, earlier heaven, in the garden of hetep on the stellar mount . The pictures of this paradise in the Hebrew writings , the Psalms, the books of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Micah, Zechariah, and Revelation, w ere pre - extant long ages earlier as Egyptian. What the so - called “prophe ts” of the Jews did was to make subl una ry this vision of the good time in anot her life. There were already two Jerusalems from the time when Jude a and Palestine were appe nda ges of Egyp t. Two Jerusalems were recogni zed by Paul, one terrestrial, one celestial. The name of Jerusalem we read as the Aarru - salem or fields of peace, equi valent to Aarru - hetep or Sekhe t - hetep, the fields of peace in Egypt ian. Jerusalem below was the localized re presentative of Jerusalem above , the Aarru - salem or Aarru - hetep on the mount of peace in the heaven of the never - setting stars. The burden of Jewish prophe cy, which turned out so terribly misleading for thos e who were ignor ant of the secret wisdom , is that the vision of this glorious future shoul d be attained on earth; whereas it never had that meaning. But the Hebrew non - initiates came to think it had; they also prophe sied as if they thought it had. Thus Jerusalem on earth was to take the place of Jerusale m above , and the Aarru - hetep becom e the Jeru - salem simply as a munda ne locality. Jerusalem is to be rebui lt, and to be called the City of Truth, which had been the Maat upon the mount in the Egypt ian eschatology (Zech. I. 16; II. 1, 2, and 10; VIII. 3). Th e bringe r of peace is to return and bui ld the temple of the"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"Lord, and the couns el of peace is to be between him and the Lord. And “there shall be the seed of peace; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shal l give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this peopl e to inhe rit all these things ” (Zech. VIII. 12), “all these things ” being the things predicated of the prom ised land of the mythos , the fields of peace or gardens of Hetep in the eschatology, the abode of the blessed in Jerusalem above . In this new Jerusalem on earth it was to be as it had been in the maat upon the moun t, where Atum or Osiris imaged the eternal on his seat who presided ove r the pol e of heaven (Rit., ch. 7). Every man was to speak t he truth with his neighbour , and execute the judgm ent of truth and peace in their gates after attaining the maat. Amongs t the Egypt ian sayings that have been taken literally by the Jews and Christians is the statement that the meek shall inhe rit the earth. We read in the Psalms, “Thos e that wait on the Lord, they shall inherit the land. Yet a little 539 while and the wicked shall not be. But the meek shall inhe rit the land, and shall delight themselves in the abunda nce of peace. Their inhe ritance shall be for ever. But the wicked shall perish. Such as be blessed of him shall inhe rit the land, and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off. The righteous shall inhe rit the land. Wait on the Lord, and he shall exalt thee to inhe rit the land” (Ps. XXXVII). If such prom ises and prophe cies had appl ied to the lands of this world (which they did not ), our Engl ish race woul d have prove d itself to have been the most right eous peopl e on earth, and the landl ess Jews the most utterly deceived by the Lord on whom they w aited, like the hungr y animal in the fable, when he depende d on the word of the nur se who threatened to throw the child to the wolf, and was deceived regarding his suppe r. It never was our earth that the meek or the right eous were to inhe rit, but the land in the earth of a future life, the land that was promised to the doe rs of right and the fulfillers of justice on this earth, who became the cultivators in the fields of divine harvest for eternity. In the Egypt ian teaching this land of prom ise, of plenty, and of peace was the land of Hetep, the garden of Aarru, the Elysian Fields, the paradise of spirits perfected who were the onl y right eous on the sum mit of the mount , which had to be attained by long climbing in the life hereafter as well as in the life on earth. That was the onl y land to be attained by thos e who waited on the Lord. It was a land of pur e delight mappe d out in the nor thern heaven, to be seen through the darkne ss that cove red the earth by night . In that land every worker had his appoi nted por tion given to cultivate and bring forth his share of produc e. There were no Feringhe es or eaters of the earth up there. But change the venue and pervert the teaching by making this land of promise an earthly pos session, as is done all through the biblical writings , and you have an alleged divine sanction and warrant for all the robbe ry of land and all the iniqui ty that has been perpetrated against the weaker races of the abor igines by God Almight y’s favour ite whites. The Jews professed to wait upon the Lord , therefore they were to inhe rit the land. The Spaniards likewise waited on the Lord, and therefore the lands of the Peruvi ans and Mexicans were theirs by divine right. So has it been with the Engl ish in America, in Australia, in Africa. They who wait upon the Lord onc e a week, or onc e a year upon Atone ment Day, without atone ment, shall inhe rit the earth. And all the time such teaching is not onl y utterly immoral, not onl y ethically false; it never had the signi ficance assigne d to it by the Jews and Christi ans when first taught by the Egyp tians. A false bot tom has"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"thus been laid by this perversion of old Egypt ’s wisdom , and on that false bot tom have the Jews and Christians bui lt for this world, whereas the Egypt ians laid their founda tions for eternity. The Egypt ian wisdom , to which the whol e wide round of the world is one vast whispering gallery, has been looke d upon by the bibliolater as “the materials that Revelation had to deal with” (Cobb, Origines Judai ca ) — that is, the wisdom pre - extant, for which the E gyp tians had toiled during a dateless antiqui ty, becom es divine revelation when mutilated and misrende red in the biblical version. For the sounde r inference to be drawn from the com paratively late origin of the Hebrew letters is not that the subj ect - matter of the doc um ents is necessarily 540 late, but that it was preserved in the hierogl yphi c langua ge which was read by Osarsiph and his fellow - priests from On, before it was transcribed in the later letters. The truth is that the primary records on which th e Bible was based were not a produc t of the Palestinian Jews. In the original scriptures no mistakes are made by the speaker as to the nature of the prom ises or the place of performance. In one of the rubrics to the Ritual it is said: “If this chapter be r ecited ove r him (the deceased), he will make his exodus and go forth ove r the earth, and he will pass through every kind of fire, no evil thing being able to hur t him.” But this was in making his progr ess ove r the earth of Amenta, the land of life, as a ma nes, and not as a hum an being in the earth of time. The secret of the whol e matter is that in bot h the Old and the New Testaments the mysteries of Amenta have been literalized and shifted to the human dw elling - place, and the readers have been left gropi ng and wande ring in the wrong world. It is the peopl e of Israel who were in Sheol, not in Palestine, that speak in the follow ing words of Hosea: “Com e, and let us return unt o the Lord (who is described in the preceding chapter as the doubl e lion) ; for he hat h torn and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. After two day s will he revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, and we shal l live before him. And let us know , let us follow on to know the Lord. His goi ng forth is sure as the mo rning; and he shall com e unt o us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth” (Hos. VI. 1 - 3). These were the peopl e of Israel who suffered their captivity in the prison - hous e of Amenta. They have suffered death from the lion god, who has laid t hem low in Sheol, but will raise them upon the third day to live with himself. This was the captivity of Job the sufferer from Satan in Sheol, and also the sufferer in the Psalms whos e soul is a prisone r bou nd in Sheol, waiting for deliverance and for the salvation that com eth out of Zion (Ps. XIV and XVI). It is a captivity that never was historical, in a land of bonda ge which may be called Babyl on, Egypt , or Sodom ; but , as Hosea show s, it was a bonda ge from which the prisone rs were set free after two day s — that is, in the resurrection on the third day . A know ledge of the matter at first hand in the Egypt ian rende ring will disintegrate the historical captivity and exodus , leaving but little to set foot upon beyond a heap of ever - shifting sand. In Alexandr ia, about the year 140 B.C. , the Sibyl was giving forth her oracles in a farrago of the ancient wisdom , conc erning an adve nt of the righteous king who was to rise up in the east, as all such persona ges ever had done in the solar mythos , and found his kingdo m of perpetual peace. The Jews in Alexandr ia, being in subj ection, cultivated this idea, and did their"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"utmost to conve rt the mythical Messiah into an ethni cal saviour . Their falsely - excited hope s, how ever, ende d in a few desperate ende avour s to fufil the sup pos ed prophe cies respecting a pol itical deliverer who shoul d free them from the Rom an yoke . And the same delusion, mainly bor n of misinterpreted mythology, lived on afterwards as Christian. More especially after the alleged historic fulfilment. It broke ou t as a belief in the second adve nt and the establishm ent of the millenni um which had not been historically realized the first time. The Christian opinion most prevalent for 541 many centuries was that the Messiah woul d com e again, like Arthur and other Æ oni an heroes of the astronom ical mythol ogy, and that his kingdom was to last one thous and years. After that the deluge , or the dragon. Christian Chiliasim was unw ittingl y founde d on the periodi c return of the ever - com ing one who had been Horus or Iu the pr ince of peace in the “hous e of a thous and years,” an earthly likeness of which was restored for Amen of Nepata by King Harsiatef of the 26t h dyn asty (Stele, Records of the Past, vol . VI, p. 85). This ever - recurring adve nt was dated for thos e who kept the c hronol ogy , but the ignor ant Christian Chiliasts were left literally dateless from their lack of the gnos is. That which had been in the astronom ical mythos was yet to com e according to the biblical prophe cies. In the Kamite eschatology the mount ain of the L ord’s hous e had been established at the sum mit of Aarru - hetep, the paradise of peace, the count ry that is called the “tip of heaven” (Rit., ch. 99) . The hous e of the Lord upon the moun t was the great hall of judg ment called the maat, from which proceeded t he law and the word of the Lord and the son of God who came to make the word of the Lord truth against his adve rsaries. “But in the latter days it shall com e to pass that the mount ain of the Lord’s hous e shall be established in the top of the moun tains, an d it shall be exalted above the hills; and peopl es shall flow unt o it. And many nations shall go and say, Com e ye, and let us go up to the mount ain of the Lord, and to the hous e of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge between many peopl es, and shall rebuke strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into ploughs hares, and their spears into pruni ng - ho oks ; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. They shall sit every man unde r his vine and unde r his fig - tree, and none shall make them afraid; for the mout h of the Lord of hos ts hath spoke n it,” “and the Lord sh all reign ove r them in Mount Zion from henceforth even for ever” (Micah IV. 1 - 8). But whilst the prophe t is appa rently peering forward into som e inde finite future, he is onl y looki ng into the cam era obs cura in front , which is all the while reflecting thing s that lie behind him in a far - off past. Ages on ages earlier the feast of fat things , with the heaps of food, the thous ands of geese and duc ks, the corn and beer in huge abunda nce, had been spread in the Egypt ian paradise for the eternal feast, with Mount Hetep for the table. This was the heaven of all good things that were imaged as provi sions in the land of prom ise that coul d not be attained in Jerusalem below , but only at the sum mit of anot her life. This was the mount of peace where the Lord of all thin gs rested, he whos e name was Neb - Hetep, the lord of peace. That was the land in which there was no more night and the tears were wiped from all faces, and pain and sorrow ceased, and sighi ng had for ever passed away. A close acqua intance with the Ritual sh ow s that the Ius"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"brought out of Egypt certain writings that cont ained the Egyp tian eschatology, the wisdom in which they tell us their giver of the law was learned. That wisdom of the other world was conve rted into history for this, and all turned tops y - tu rvy by changi ng the earth of 542 eternity into the earth of time and the manes into mortals. In this way the nobl e, full, flow ing river of old Egypt ’s wisdom ende d in a quagm ire of prophe cies for the Jews and a dried - up wilderness of desert sands for the Christians. And on thos e shifting sands the “historic” Christians reared their temple of the eternal, which is giving way at last because it was not founde d on the solid rock, and because no amount of blood woul d ever suffice to solidify the sand or form a conc rete foun dation or even a but tress for the crum bling bui lding. The secret of the ancientness and sanctity of the writings is that they were originally Egypt ian, like the Jewish com muni ty. They are not the produc t of any ground - root age in the land of Jude a. They com e to us masked and in disgui se. The wisdom of old, the myths, parables, and dark sayings that were preserved, have been presented to us dreadfully defeatured and deformed in the cour se of being conve rted into history. An exot eric rende ring has taken the place of the esoteric representation which cont ained the onl y true interpretation. The past was know n to Philo, the learned Jew, who when speaking of the Mosaic writings told his count rym en that “the literal statement is a fabul ous one , and i t is in the mythical that we shall find the true.” To unde rstand their ow n books , their religious rites, festivals, and ceremoni es, the Jews will have to go back to Egypt for the purpos e of com parison. The Egyp tian Ritual will show them why their New Year’ s Day is the annua l judgm ent day, the great day of doom ; and why it is also the “great day of memorial” for celebrating the creation of the world, as it was in Egypt . Their “great day of atone ment” is identical with that on which the Sut - Typhoni ans and adv ersaries of Osiris were slain in a bloody sacrifice that was offered up as pleasing to the Good Being, Un - Nefer, who was annua lly put to death by these emissaries of the evil one and annua lly avenge d by Har - Tema and his faithful follow ers. The blow ing of t he trum pet, or Shof ar, is the signa l for the resurrection from Amenta, or Sheol, and has been so since the vernal equi nox entered and the solar resurrection occurred in the sign of the Ram, 4,300 years ago, to say not hing of the earlier stations in precess ion. The Rabbi ns have preserved the tradition that the dead are sum mone d before the divine tribuna l to be judge d upon the day of doom , which occurs each New Year’s Day. Gleams of the ancient glory are afloat in Jewish eyes that still turn Zionw ard, still mistaking the earthly for the heavenly vision of the eternal city, a prom ised land in Palestine for a celestial locality that is still en l’air or in the clouds of prophe cy. If they were to see the prom ised land in Palestine to - day, they woul d not find the eternal city of their dreams at Jerusalem any more than at Rom e or Thebes, at Memphi s, at Annu, or any other founda tion upon which the celestial hom e of rest was por trayed in heaven or localized in a pattern on this earth. On the other hand, the Jews in t heir religious mysteries go back to Jerusalem onc e every year; and onc e a year Messiah com es to them, from generation to generation as “the persistent traveller upon heaven’s"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"highw ays, who steppe th onw ards through eternity” (Rit., ch. 42) . The yearning for Zion by these hom eless lodge rs who 543 are aliens in all lands did not arise from love of count ry or desire to cultivate its soil. It originated in religious feeling and the follow ing of a heavenly mirage that coul d be pur sued ove r all the earth and its deserts, inde pendently of locality or of race. This view is also enforced by the persistence of the Messianic craze that yet survives amongs t the Jewish victims of misinterpreted mythol ogy, who still await that fulfilment of the impos sible which the perse cuting Christians fatuou sly suppos e they have secured for all time and for eternity.   544"}]
