A Joseph Campbell Companion: Reflections on the Art of Living has longbeen one of our favorite Campbell titles, and it is perennially one of thisquotable man's most quoted.This book was drawn from transcripts of a month-long series of workshops thatJoseph Campbell gave at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California in March,1984—the year of his eightieth birthday. The idea for the book was conceivedby workshop attendee Diane K. Osbon in 1990, some three years after Campbelldied. The text was edited into its present form by longtime Campbell editor andJCF president Robert Walter. Filmed segments from this same month-long celebration of Campbell and his workare available in The Hero's Journey, which is available as part of the CollectedWorks of Joseph Cambpell[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=275&JCComp]series in both video[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=681&JCComp]and print[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=705&JCComp]formats.A Joseph Campbell Companion was originally published by HarperCollins in 1991.In addition to this edition, the book is currently available in a paperbackedition published by HarperPerennial[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=2&JCComp].This electronic edition was published in August, 2011.

Adam was bored.He was doing the job, but it was no fun. God saw that he needed entertainment,and so he created the animals to entertain him. All Adam could think of to dowith the animals was to give them names.Then God said, “Well, here goes.” So he put Adam to sleep and pulled Eve out ofhis rib—as Joyce said, she was “the cutletsized consort.” Then the troublestarted and we were in the game. Male and female, life and death,good and evil: problems of opposites. The trouble that began was the discovery of duality. That was the Fall. Therewas no real recognition of duality before this. How did duality take place inthis garden? There were two trees that were forbidden trees. “You can eat thefruit of any tree in the place but not of this or of that one.” Tree number onewas the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of duality. Tree number two wasthe tree of the knowledge of eternal life.The serpent—who represents lunar consciousness and life in the field of time,where there are pairs of opposites—saw Eve and thought she must be bored, asmost wives are when their husbands are working all the time. When that happens,there’s always a friend that appears, and this one was a little serpent.The serpent said: “Look there’s an interesting thing about this tree. Don't mindthat old buzzard—have a taste and you will really know something.” Well, she hada taste, and when Adam came along, she said, “Look, this is okay.”So, he had a taste, and then God, who walked in the cool of the evening in theGarden, saw the pair of them wearing fig leaves, and he said, “What’s this?You’ve got leaves on.” The female activates the male;then he is the action,and she has to take the results. They told God what happened, and that ran the usual way: the man blamed thewoman, and the woman blamed the snake. God then cursed the lot of them inincreasing degrees. Man got it fairly easy: all he had to do was to work andsweat. The woman had to bring forth children in pain, and the serpent had tocrawl on his belly for the rest of his life. God kicked them out of the Gardenand put at the gate two cherubim, door guardians, with a flaming sword betweenthem. And that’s the explanation of why we’re out here in the cold and not inthe Garden. Christianity and Judaismare religions of exile:Man was thrown out of the Garden. It seems impossible today, but people actually believed all that until asrecently as half a century or so ago: clergymen, philosophers, governmentofficers and all. Today we know—and know right well—that there never wasanything of the kind: no Garden of Eden anywhere on this earth, no time when theserpent could talk, no prehistoric “Fall,” no excl-sion from the Garden, nouniversal Flood, no Noah’s Ark. The entire history on which our leadingOccidental religions have been founded is an anthology of fictions. But theseare fictions of a type that have had—curiously enough—a universal vogue as thefounding legends of other religions, too. Their counterparts have turned upeverywhere—and yet, there never was such a garden, serpent, tree, or deluge.7[part0105.html#footnote7] The serpentwas the wise one in the Garden.Adam and Evegot thrown into the field of time. “…in the beginning this universe was but the Self in the form of a man. Helooked around and saw nothing but himself.…“He was just as large as a man and a woman embracing. This Self then dividedhimself in two parts; and with that, there were a master and mistress.—Thereforethis body, by itself, as the sage Yajnavalkya declares, is like half of a splitpea. And that is why, indeed, this space is filled by a woman.—He united withher, and from that mankind arose.…“She became a cow, he a bull and united with her; and from that cattle arose.She became a mare, he a stallion; she an ass, he a donkey and united with her;and from that solid-hoofed animals arose. She became a goat, he a buck; shebecame a sheep, he a ram and united with her; and from that goats and sheeparose.—Thus he poured forth all pairing things, down to the ants.”—BṛhadāranyakaUpaniṣad8 [part0105.html#footnote8] Marriage is reconstructionof the androgyne. If you marry only for the love affair,that will not last. You must also marry on another levelto reconstruct the androgyne,to make the perfect whole,male and female. …consider the allegory in Plato’s Symposium, where it is said byAristophanes—playfully, yet in the form of the same myth—that the earliest humanbeings were “round and had four hands and four feet, back and sides forming acircle, one head with two faces looking opposite ways, set on a round neck andprecisely alike; also four ears, two privy members, and the remainders tocorrespond.” According to this Platonic version of the great theme, theseoriginal creatures were of three kinds: male-male, male-female, andfemale-female. They were immensely powerful; and since the gods were in fear oftheir strength, Zeus decided to cut them in two, like apples halved forpickling.… “After the division the two parts of man, each desiring his otherhalf, came together, and threw their arms about one another eager to grow intoone, and would have perished from hunger without ever making an effort, becausethey did not like to do anything apart… : so ancient is the desire of oneanother which is implanted in us, reuniting our original nature, making one oftwo and healing the state of man. Each of us when separated is but the indentureof a man, having one side only like a flat fish, and he is always looking forhis other half.9 [part0105.html#footnote9] When seeking your partner,if your intuition is a virtuous one,you will find him or her. If not,you’ll keep finding the wrong person."},{"pageContent":"How does one talk about whether or not there is a destiny between couples? Ifeel it, but I don’t believe it. In my case, at Sarah Lawrence College I wasteaching all these beautiful girls, and there were certain classes when I’d feela little hopped up. It took me six months to locate the one who was responsiblefor this, and when I did, I knew I was gone.When I first saw the woman who is now my wife, I felt like that and didn’t knowit. She was in the class, and I was hopped up—who the hell is doing this? Then Ifinally located who she was, and there was a whole constellating of relationshipthat I didn’t let her know about until I gave the mildest sign: she was about toleave school, so I gave her a book: Spengler’s Decline of the West. It was alittle present, but a loaded one.There was something behind that projection of mine. Why does this projectioncome out of me instead of someone else? Because it’s based upon my deep lifeexperiences, and that’s where one’s destiny is. It is structured by your ownlife. It is my life that put the projection that way—experiences that I’ve hadof the female, even in my infancy.So that’s what destiny is: simply the fulfillment of the potentialities of theenergies in your own system. The energies are committed in a certain way, andthat commitment out there is coming toward you. The projection-making factor [in the male] is the anima, or rather theunconscious as represented by the anima. When-ever she appears, in dreams,visions, and fantasies, she takes on personified form, thus demonstrating thatthe factor she embodies possesses all the outstanding characteristics of afeminine being. She is not an invention of the conscious, but a spontaneousproduct of the unconscious. Nor is she a substitute figure for the mother. Onthe contrary, there is every likelihood that the numinous qualities which makethe mother-image so dangerously powerful derive from the collective archetype ofthe anima, which is incarnated anew in every male child. —Jung 10[part0105.html#footnote10] The woman’s bodyis the first world to the newborn.The child’s projections of animawill be of her from then on. Just as the mother seems to be the first carrier of the projection-making factorfor the son, so is the father for the daughter.…Woman is compensated by amasculine element and therefore her unconscious has, so to speak, a masculineimprint. This results in a considerable psychological difference between men andwomen, and accordingly I have called the projection-making factor in women theanimus, which means mind or spirit.…when anima and animus meet, the animus drawshis sword of power, and the anima ejects her poison of illusion and seduction.The outcome need not always be negative, since the two are equally likely tofall in love (a special instance of love at first sight). —Jung11[part0105.html#footnote11] You know about your anima or animusby your response to the opposite sex. There’s a fundamental image in the old Babylonian mythology of the God Marduk,the great sun god, the shaper and creator of the world. What does he create theworld out of? His grandmother, Tiamat, who comes as a monster, and he carves herup.She would have cut herself up anyhow, but she lets him become the agent of thisdeed, because one has to have that kind of confidence in action out there inorder that the world can live. So, this is a generous woman, who lets the littleboy think he is doing the job, when she could have done it herself.That’s the way the animus is: it is a projection of something the female coulddo but instead allows the male to do for her. Though not half so vital apresence, he is a machine with a body that’s specialized, so he can do thesethings. The realization that the power is within you is one thing; but torealize that the action implied by that power is more adequately rendered by themale than by you as a female is to recognize relationship.When a woman realizes that the power is within her, then the man emerges as anindividual, rather than just being an example of what she thinks she needs. Onthe male side, when a man looks at a woman and sees only somebody to go to bedwith, he is seeing her in relation to a fulfillment of some need of his own andnot as a woman at all. It’s like looking at cows and thinking only of roastbeef. Falling in love is nature coming in.It starts with being carried offby the opposite sex."},{"pageContent":"It is amazing, but our theologians still are writing of agape and eros and theirradical opposition, as though these two were the final terms of the principle of“love”: the former, “charity,” godly and spiritual, being “of men toward eachother in a community,” and the latter, “lust,” natural and fleshly, being “theurge, desire and delight of sex.”12 [part0105.html#footnote12] Nobody in apulpit seems ever to have heard of amor as a third, selective, discriminatingprinciple in contrast to the other two. For amor is neither of the right-handpath (the sublimating spirit, the mind and the comm-nity of man), nor of theindiscriminate left (the spontaneity of nature, the mutual incitement of thephallus and the womb), but is the path directly before one, of the eyes andtheir message to the heart.There is a poem to this point by a great troubadour (perhaps the greatest ofall), Guiraut de Borneilh:So, through the eyes love attains the heart:For the eyes are the scouts of the heart,And the eyes go reconnoiteringFor what it would please the heart to possess.And when they are in full accordAnd firm, all three, in the one resolve,At that time, perfect love is bornFrom what the eyes have made welcome to the heart.Not otherwise can love either be born or have commencementThen by this birth and commencement moved by inclination By the grace and by commandOf these three, and from their pleasure,Love is born, who with fair hopeGoes comforting her friends.For as all true loversKnow, love is perfect kindness,Which is born—there is no doubt—from the heart and eyes.The eyes make it blossom; the heart matures it:Love, which is the fruit of their very seed.13 [part0105.html#footnote13]Troubadour love was bornwith the meeting of the eyes.The eyes are the scouts of love.If it is a gentle heart, love is born. At the moment of the wakening to love, an object, apparently without, “passes[in the words of Joyce] into the soul forever.…And the soul leaps at the call.To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!”14[part0105.html#footnote14] Love is not only a life experience,but also a mystical experience.In courtly love, the pain of love,the impossibility of fulfillment,was considered the essence of life. For when a heart insists on its destiny, resisting the general blandishment,then the agony is great; so too the danger. Forces, however, will have been setin motion beyond the reckoning of the senses. Sequences of events from thecorners of the world will draw gradually together, and miracles of coincidencebring the inevitable to pass.15 [part0105.html#footnote15] The distance of your loveis the distance of your life. Love is exactly as strong as life."},{"pageContent":"The loss of a love and the pain of a broken relationship is an overload ofprojection. That’s all it is. In youth, your whole life is this wonderful dreamthat “This is It”: this relationship is the fulfillment of my fantasy and Ican’t imagine life otherwise. No argument can quell this feeling of totalprojection, of everything in the other one. I guess we can all recall an episodeof an adolescent relationship that seemed to be the all-in-all and then went topieces for some reason.When a relationship breaks off, it takes a person a little while to settle andfind a new commitment. It’s after the breakoff, when there is no new commitmentand life has been divested of all of its potentials, that this painful reactiontakes place. For some people this is a dangerous period.The psyche knows how to heal, but it hurts. Some-times the healing hurts morethan the initial injury, but if you can survive it, you’ll be stronger, becauseyou’ve found a larger base. Every commit-ment is a narrowing, and when thatcommitment fails, you have to get back to a larger base and have the strength tohold to it.Nietzsche was the one who did the job for me. At a certain moment in hislife,the idea came to him of what he called “the love of your fate.” Whateveryour fate is, whatever the hell happens, you say, “This is what I need.” It maylook like a wreck, but go at it as though it were an opportunity, a challenge.If you bring love to that moment—not discouragement—you will find the strengthis there. Any disaster you can survive is an improvement in your character, yourstature, and your life. What a privilege! This is when the spontaneity of yourown nature will have a chance to flow.Then, when looking back at your life, you will see that the moments which seemedto be great failures followed by wreckage were the incidents that shaped thelife you have now. You’ll see that this is really true. Nothing can happen toyou that is not positive. Even though it looks and feels at the moment like anegative crisis, it is not. The crisis throws you back, and when you arerequired to exhibit strength, it comes. The dark night of the soulcomes just before revelation. When everything is lost,and all seems darkness,then comes the new lifeand all that is needed."},{"pageContent":"Jean and I have been married for forty-six years, and we have a kind of back andforth of feelings and intelligences, so that we’ve experienced “the one that istwo and the two that are one.” We do not have to theorize about it, we know whatthe hell it means. It’s what Goethe calls the “Golden Wedding,” and it isbeautiful when that feeling becomes a fact in your life. Mythology helps you to identifythe mysteries of the energiespouring through you. Therein lies your eternity. It is nice to know enough about mythology to realize how beautiful such anexperience can be. A lot of people could have the experience and not know theyhad it. One of the wonderful things about these age-old realizations that areconstellated in the mythic images is that they let you know what it is you areexperiencing. Mythology is an organization of imagesmetaphoric of potentials of experience, action, and fulfillment of the humanspiritin the field of a given culture at a given time. The goal of the Golden Wedding is implicit in the first moment of arelationship. Old age is implicit in the generation of a child: the child’s oldage is there waiting. Similarly, the older you get, the more you realize thatyou are still a kid, and your early experiences are the ones that are now justopening out. It is one system all the time.This is one of the big themes in James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake. He has this imageof the heroine, Anna Livia Plurabelle, as being the personification of the RiverLiffey that flows through Dublin.The River Liffey rises in the hills south of Dublin as a little girl, thosedancing little rivulets that are going to form the river. Then it flows north toa lovely suburban area, where you have the mother with her family: the mid-pointof life. The river is the same river. Then it turns and runs through Dublin andbecomes an old, dirty, city river, carrying all the rubbish of the city back tothe ocean, the Father Ocean. The sun then brings the vapor up to the cloud, andit’s now a little cloud in the Mother Womb of the blue sky. It floats over thehill and discharges the rain on the mountains. The first half of lifewe serve society—engagement.The second half of lifewe turn inward—disengagement. She is the same person, the same river, all the time. Joyce makes it so you canfeel the old woman in the little girl and the little girl in the old woman. It'smarvelous. And it’s the way you actually feel as you get older, if you arepaying attention to the experiences you’re having inside.You know, they say that old people can’t remember what happened yesterday, butthey can remember with great vividness what happened fifty years ago. This isreally true. In old age, you are relaxed from the immediate occasion of theday’s summons, and you’re sinking down into your memory system, which is asalive as can be. Moments with your parents that were crisis moments are rightthere with you. They become important. They’re determinate moments that helpilluminate what the relationship was.Sometimes when I look back, I think, “Son of a gun, you missed everything.” It’sfunny how, at a certain age, all I could see were the negatives in the way Ilived: I missed it that time, or another time I was a stupid boob. Now, I trynot to think about it. I’m wanting to get to heaven, where they tell me that youdon’t remember all those things. In the age of decrepitude,you look back over your lifewith gratitude,and forward to deathas a return home. When Dante passed out of Purgatory, he drank at the river where all of his sinswere wiped out of his memory. The first river from which he’d drunk forgave allof his sins, but that wasn’t good enough, because then he still had to forgetthem."},{"pageContent":"In Hinduism, the religion of the god Viṣṇu is that of love. In the Viṣṇu way ofanalyzing love, there are five degrees of love and a model that represents eachof these different stages. The whole discipline of seeking and achievingillumination can be conducted from the energy of this channel.The first degree of love, that of servant to master, is a low degree of love:“Oh Lord, you are the master. I am the servant. Tell me what I am to do, and Ishall do it.” This is the way of the religion of law, where there are a lot ofcommands—ten commandments, a thousand commandments, a hundred and ten thousandcommandments. It is a religion of fear. You have not awakened to the divinepresence. It’s out there, and you are here. This way is principally for peoplewho have not had much time to devote themselves either to religious thinking orto love.The model that represents this first stage is that of the little monkey king,Hanumān, who is the servant of Rāma. I don't know whether there is a specificexample of this stage in the Christian tradition, but there doesn’t have to be,because the Christian tradition is nothing else for most people: obeying tencommandments here, ten commandments there.Degree number two, the relationship of friend to friend, is the awakening ofwhat we would call love. Here, one thinks of one's friend more than in the firstsituation. The model of this second stage of love, friend for friend, would bethat of the apostles to Jesus, or of anyone who really is a lover of anything oranybody.Sri Ramakrishna, a wonderful Hindu saint of the last century, once asked a womanwho said she did not love God, “Is there nothing in the world that you do love?”And she answered, “I love my little nephew.” “Well then,” he replied, “There Heis. Your service is there.” Whenever there is an experience of love as aspontaneous act, rather than as the following of a command, you have moved outof stage one and into stage two.This is worth thinking about. How much religious service reaches that level? I’dsay very little. Yet this is how it ought to be. Religious experience is greatlylowered when it’s only a fulfillment of laws and commands, and you are but awilling or non-willing person doing or not doing as you are told. When it comesto a spontaneous relationship of love, you’re in another category.The third order of love is that of parent for child. It is a more intimate andintense affair than that of friend to friend. The image of this third order oflove in the Christian system is the Christmas crib, in which the babe representsthe coming to us of the Christ in our own hearts. This is symbolic of theawakening in your heart of the realization that the divine power is within you.It’s the dawn of the true religious life. You are fostering the spiritual childwithin yourself. The model for this stage in the Hindu tradition is the love ofthe Gopis for the little boy Kṛṣṇa, the naughty butter thief.There’s one very amusing Kṛṣṇa episode, in which his foster mother is told thather little boy is out-side eating mud. She goes out to clean the mud out of hismouth, and when he opens his mouth, he reveals to her all the heavens and hellsand gods and demons in himself. She is , of course, stunned by this display, andher relationship to him would be pretty well damaged from then on if sheremembered it, so he very kindly erases it from her memory. How we know thatthis event happened—since she was the only one who had the experience and thenshe forgot it—I do not know. But that’s the way religious things are.The fourth level of love is that of spouse to spouse, and here there is thebusiness of the androgyne, of identification with the Other. You have found thegod in your heart, and now the god is found in this intimate and most enduringkind of relationship. That’s why marriage is regarded, in such traditions, as apermanent affair. There is only one chance to have this type of experience. Nunswear a wedding ring, because they are brides of Christ. Their relationship is tothis invisible spouse, which, on the spiritual level, is good enough.Then we come to the highest order of love, the fifth, and that is compulsive,uncontrollable, illicit love, where there is nothing but love and you aretotally ripped out of yourself in relation to God. You are le fou, the crazedone who’s gone mad with love. In courtly love,the man goes crazy, not the woman.When the man’s been moved like this,he is capable of incredible feats,but he’s on a narrow path. When you follow your passion,society’s help is gone.You must be very careful.You’re completely on your own. In marriage, one is still harmoniously related to society and to theneighborhood, but with this fifth stage of love, everything except love dropsaway, and there is just a one-pointed attachment to the other. All else isforgotten, and nothing else matters. I am sure some of you have had thisexperience. If you haven’t, it’s too bad."},{"pageContent":"In this little scale that the Hindus give—first servant to master; second,friend to friend; third, parent to child; fourth, spouse to spouse; and thenfifth, just this total love—one is always in danger of over-valuing the sheerlove experience. You feel that you are losing something if you pull theexperience down, but you have got to pull it down. All you have to do, really,is know what the possible relationship can be.If you’re already married and this rapturous experience happens, then you’re notgoing to have a marriage, because you’ve got to have some other kind ofrelation-ship to the person. The way to pull down the sheer love experience isto take very deep pleasure of some kind in the concrete aspects of therelationship that you are establishing. Sheer rapture has no relationship tolife, but there are relationships in life which also have value. Begin tocultivate those, and this total rapture can be pulled down and not lost. It’snot necessarily lost. And this is the trick in marriage.There are lots of joyful experiences in marriage that have nothing to do withtotal rapture, but these experiences absorb that energy system and make itpossible for one to stay married and not think it’s only about taking out thegarbage. Anyone who gets married is going to have problems with daily chores,because the problem of a household is on you whether you are a male or a female.But you can make wonderful little ritual experiences out of the things that haveto be done, and life can ride beautifully on these events. I think it is afailure to accept the tangibilities of two people living together that makesmarriages break up. Marriage is not a love affair,it’s an ordeal.It is a religious exercise, a sacrament,the grace of participating in another life. There is another kind of breakup that takes place late in marriage, and this onejust baffles me: people who break up when the kids are out of the house andlaunched. I have seen this happen in five or six cases to people whom I neverwould have thought would have had that happen. They are well on in theirfifties, they have been living together, they’ve brought up a family together,had life together, and it goes to pot. The only thing holding them together hadbeen the children.This is the failure of what I called the alchemical marriage. They have had abiological marriage, but there has been no realization of the interlocking ofthe psyches and the mutual education that comes out of that acquiescence andrelationship. It’s a damned shame that there has been no preliminary notion ofwhat the possibilities are of that second half of life. If you go into marriage with a program,you will find that it won’t work. Successful marriageis leading innovative lives together,being open, non-programmed.It’s a free fall: how you handleeach new thing as it comes along. As a drop of oil on the sea,you must float,using intellect and compassionto ride the waves. It seems to me, you have to think of significant things to do together thatrequire both of you. The medieval idea of the gentle heart is very much a partof this. If what you’ve been calling love is really lust, that is a statealright: one that can die. Love doesn’t die. For the gentle heart,marriage must first be spiritual,then comes physical consummation. It's hard to talk about anything as sensitive as this, but that term “gentleheart” to me is a clue to what love is. The idea of the gentle heart involves asense of responsibility to the person. If that is not there, you have not gotlove, you’ve got something else. If that is there, it will last. Lust doesn’t,no responsibility there. In marriages that go when the children go, the parents’sense of responsibility was to the children, not to each other, and when thatwas gone, the link was gone.Before there are any children or even before there is a marriage, the crucialquestion is: “Is this the gentle heart?” Is the person seeking a possession? Oris the person feeling a responsibility to the one with whom the relationship istaking place? If there is feeling of responsibility, then I think you are indanger.What I am saying is, not that responsibility constitutes love, but that lovewithout a sense of responsibility is not love. It’s taking possession. Are youtrying to possess somebody? Or are you in a relationship?Talking about what one has done in one’s own life, I wouldn’t have thought ofmarrying anyone unless, in committing myself to the marriage, I understood thatI was taking that person’s life in my hands. I can’t under-stand that otherfeeling of possessing somebody. It is a failure to take responsibility for whatthe hell you are doing. One can have love affairs and all the weeping that goeson in all that, but that is very different from moving into a marriage.In the first place, you have to know what you are doing. I think a lot of peopledon’t know what they are doing, and they don’t know what they’re doing to thatother person. If you don’t have the maturity to control your compulsivepassions, it seems to me that you are ineligible for marriage. I think what I amsaying probably comes from my Catholic upbringing. In Catholicism, marriage is adestiny decision.Beyond that, there was an omen in our marriage. I had a littletwenty-dollar-a-year house in Woodstock, on a road called Maverick Road. We weredriving up there for our honeymoon, and as we approached that road, a hearsecame from the other side and drove before us. I had never seen a hearse in thatneighborhood, and I read the omen as meaning we would be together until death.There it was.What I see in marriage, then, is a real identification with that other person asyour responsibility, and as the one whom you love. Committing yourself toanyone, turning your destiny over to a dual destiny, is a life commitment. Tolose your sense of responsibility to the person who has given you thatcommitment because something comes along that enables you to think, “I'd like tofly off in this direction and forget that which has already been committed”—thisis not marriage. I do not think you are married unless your relationship to yourspouse has primary consideration in your life. It’s got to be top.Compulsive erotic relationships can break in on this. One is not in perfectcontrol of oneself. I don’t mean that everything outside of the marriage islust. It can be love also. When you cut off a love that comes to you outside ofmarriage, you have cut off a part of yourself in the marriage.But then you have the problem of relating with responsibility to that loveaffair and to the marriage that you’ve already got as your prime relationship,and that is not an easy thing to do. You have to develop a number of differentways of relating to people, not just one. Sometimes, if there is a mutual senseof the nature of the relationship and its value, then something can be workedout; but I would understand that, no matter what happened, the marriage wouldhave to come back together again. It’s prime. It’s number one.If the marriage is toxic, you have to decide whether there is a possibility oftransforming the situation. If you feel that there can be a transformation, thenyou can go through the ordeal of effecting one. You can exert the necessaryenergy on the other to effect the transformation. That is to say, you can, as akind of personal discipline, increase the atmosphere of love and confidence andcooperation. On the other hand, if your life is threatened, or even your love oflife, and the situation cannot be transformed or you don’t think it is worth thecommitment, then you have got to clear out.All of this depends, of course, on the individual case and one’s own judgment.There are no basic rules that can be applied right across the board because theconflict situation differs in intensity and in character from case to case."},{"pageContent":"When I was a student in Germany, an old German professor said that the way tochoose a wife is to look at her mother. If the mother is a good woman and thekind that you regard as ideal, then marry any one of her daughters, and she willshape a life for you. In marriage,the woman is the initiator,and the man rides along. That idea of the wife being the one that shapes a life for you is one that Itook to heart, and it's a good idea. The woman is the energy, the śakti, oflife. The male must learn to ride on that energy and not dictate the life. I'mcertain of that. He is the vehicle of the woman's energy. That’s what he is.When the male won’t disintegrate, you do not have a marriage. You have aliving-together, perhaps, for practical or erotic reasons, but a marriagerequires the dissolution of the male initiative. Marriage can’t work withouta psychological guiding of both people. There must be disintegration of egofor the two to combine. The uniting process involvesfermentation, amalgamation, disintegration, and putrefactionin their psyches. When I married Jean, I felt it was a crucifixion. The bridegroom does go to thebride as to the cross. The bride gives herself equally. It’s a reciprocalcrucifixion. In marriageyou are not sacrificing yourselfto the other person.You are sacrificing yourselfto the relationship. That’s the problem with getting married. You must ask yourself, “Can I openmyself to compassion?” Not to lust, but to compassion. I don’t mean you have tohave unconditional love. Committing yourself to a person unconditionally is verydifferent from having unconditional love for everybody in New York City. I’m notthe Dalai Lama, who’s suppose to have unconditional love for everything in theworld. Even God doesn’t have unconditional love. He throws people into hell. Ipersonally don’t even think that unconditional love is an ideal. I think you’vegot to have a discriminating faculty and let bastards be bastards and let thosethat ought to be hit in the jaw get it. In fact, I have a list. If anybody has aworking guillotine, I’d be glad to give them my list. When I lookin the faces of my enemies,it makes me proud. I think perhaps unconditional love is the Grail. The Grail is between God andthe Devil, and it does not judge the way God judges. It goes past God—a prettybig picture. Love, which is unconditional in marriage, is specific; it isfocused. It is for that person and not for somebody else. Unconditional lovegoes right through everything, and it’s a breakthrough in spiritual life. Do notlook for it outside of yourself. The only place to look for it is inside. If itis going to be unconditional love, what’s out there doesn’t matter. The key to the Grail is compassion,suffering with, feeling another’s sorrowas if it were your own. The one who findsthe dynamo of compassionis the one who’s found the Grail. The question is: “Can I open myself to compassion?” Compassion for me is justwhat the word says: it is “suffering with.” It is an immediate participation inthe suffering of another to such a degree that you forget yourself and your ownsafety and spontaneously do what’s necessary.I think this has something to do with what’s meant by the image of the Grail,since the thing that effected the healing of the Grail King was the spontaneousact of asking that question and not withholding it. Often you feel that such aspontaneous act will make a fool out of you and so you don’t do it—I will looklike a fool if I do that. That’s the failure in the Grail Castle. “How is it possible that suffering that is neither my own nor of my concernshould immediately affect me as though it were my own, and with such force thatit moves me to action?” —Schopenhauer16 [part0105.html#footnote16] And in the third chapter of Ulysses, Joyce writes that Stephen, as he walkedalong the seashore, asked himself essentially this question: Would I forget myown self-protection to the extent of risking a swim out there and be at themercy of someone whose power out there I wouldn’t know anything about? When yourescue someone from drowning, you never know if they’ll pull you down with them. “This is something really mysterious, something for which Reason can provide noexplanation, and for which no basis can be found in practical experience. It isnevertheless of common occurrence, and everyone has had the experience. It isnot unknown even to the most hard-hearted and self-interested. Examples appearevery day before our eyes of instant responses of this kind, without reflection,one person helping another, coming to his aid, even setting his own life inclear danger for someone whom he has seen for the first time, having nothingmore in mind than that the other is in need and in peril of his life.”—Schopenhauer17 [part0105.html#footnote17] There was an article in the New York papers a few months ago about a kid whodove into the Hudson River to save a drowining dog and then had to be savedhimself. When asked why he’d dove in, he said, “Because it was my dog.” Thenthere was the girl who went into a burning building—twice—to save her littlebrother and sister, and when she was asked why she’d done that, she said,“Because I loved them.” Such a one is then acting, Schopenhauer answers, out of an instinctiverecognition of the truth that he and that other in fact are one. He has beenmoved not from the lesser, secondary knowledge of himself as separate from theothers, but from an immediate experience of the greater, truer truth, that weare all one in the ground of our being.18 [part0105.html#footnote18] That’s the power. These people didn’t know if they had the strength or not. It’snot duty, not reckoning. It is a flash: a breakthrough of the reality of thislife that lives in us. At such moments, you realize that you and that other are,in fact, one. It’s a big realization. Survival is the second law of life.The first is that we are all one."},{"pageContent":"IT is possible to observe, in the earliest phases of the development of theinfant, symptoms of a dawning “mythology” of a state beyond the vicissitudes oftime. These appear as reactions to, and spontaneous defenses against, thebody-destructive fantasies that assail the child when it is deprived of themother’s breast.19 [part0105.html#footnote19] “The infant reacts with a tempertantrum and the fantasy that goes with the temper tantrum is to tear everythingout of the mother's body. …The child then fears retaliation for these impulses,i.e., that everything will be scooped out of its own inside.”20[part0105.html#footnote20] Anxieties for the integrity of its body, fantasies ofrestitution, a silent, deep requirement for indestructibility and protectionagainst the “bad” forces from within and without, begin to direct the shapingpsyche; and these remain as determining factors in the later neurotic, and evennormal, life activities, spiritual efforts, religious beliefs, and ritualpractices of the adult.21 [part0105.html#footnote21] The myths are cluesto unite the forces within us. And so we have…this critical problem as human beings of seeing to it that themythology—the constellation of sign signals, affect images, energy-releasing and-directing signs—that we are communicating to our young will deliver directivemessages qualified to relate them richly and vitally to the environment that isto be theirs for life, and not to some period of man already past, some piouslydesiderated future, or—what is worst of all—some querulous, freakish sect ormomentary fad. And I call this problem critical because, when it is badlyresolved, the result for the miseducated individual is what is known, inmythological terms, as a Waste Land situation. The world does not talk to him;he does not talk to the world. When that is the case, there is a cut-off, theindividual is thrown back on himself, and he is in prime shape for thatpsychotic break-away that will turn him into either an essential schizophrenicin a padded cell, or a paranoid screaming slogans at large, in a bughousewithout walls.22 [part0105.html#footnote22] Myth makes a connection between our waking consciousness and the mystery of theuniverse. It gives us a map or picture of the universe and allows us to seeourselves in relationship to nature, as when we speak of Father Sky and MotherEarth. It supports and validates a certain social and moral order. The TenCommand-ments being given to Moses by God on Mount Sinai is an example of this.Lastly, it helps us pass through and deal with the various stages of life frombirth to death. We have, consequently, the comparatively complex problem in educating our youngof training them not simply to assume uncritically the patterns of the past, butto recognize and cultivate their own creative possibilities; not to remain onsome proven level of earlier biology and sociology, but to represent a movementof the species forward.23 [part0105.html#footnote23] Basically, everyone needs a father. The father has a vital role. The motherrepresents nature, but the father introduces the son and daughter to socialrelationships. From your mother you get your body.From your father you getyour role in the social world. The son has to play a role like that of his father, so the father is a model,either a positive or a negative one. You may be disgusted with the kind of lifeyour father lives, but you have that model, and responding negatively to it willbe your life. If he’s not there, it’s almost impossible to relate effectivelyfrom where you are in your family to the outside world.For the girl, the father is the first intimate relation-ship to the maleprinciple in some way or other. With the father gone, the mother must play bothroles, and I think the child, down deep, blames the mother for there being nofather there. It’s a sense of “you have deprived me of the person who would havebeen absolutely my guide and my messenger.”"},{"pageContent":"MONEY is congealed energy and releasing it releases life possibilities. Yourealize that the possibilities of life in an economically oriented society arereally a function of how much money you’ve got.On the other hand, money has never meant any-thing to me. I got back from mystudent years in Europe three weeks before the Wall Street crash. The only moneyI had was what I’d made playing in a jazz band in college. I’d earned severalthousand dollars—which was a lot in those days—and that was what I had until itdisappeared. I didn’t make another cent for five years. I found that, if you hadno responsibilities, you could live wonderfully without any money. In fact, Ithought anybody who worked for money was a fool. I took a vow never to doanything for money. Now, that does not mean that when I do something forsomebody I don’t ask for money. I want as much as I can get, but that’s thesecondary part of the game. My life course is absolutely indifferent to money.As a result, a lot of money has come in by my doing what I feel I want to dofrom the inside. If you do that, you are doing things that attract money,because you are giving life and life responds in the way of its counterpart inhard coin. If you follow your bliss,you will always have your bliss,money or not. If you follow money,you may lose it,and you will have nothing. Being as I was, and given the field I was interested in, I had a certain disdainfor people who gave their lives to making money. Now that I have made money, indealing with it I’ve had to be in touch with people whose business is money,whose whole life has been in that field, and I’ve had an interesting andsurprising experience: I’ve met some magnificent people.Money experienced as life energy is indeed a medi-tation, and letting it flowout instead of hoarding it is a mode of participation in the lives of others.There’s a beautiful thing that can grow out of a life devoted to money thatsurprised me.In the living of a life today, money is a facilitating energy source. With moneyin the tank like gasoline, you can get places you other wise couldn’t go.You’ve got to use the advantages that you have cultivated. Otherwise, if youdrop those, you are going to have a negative reaction in ten years or so. What Imean is, as you go from threshold to threshold, it must be the same you thatmakes the jump. You don’t go down again, you start from where you are. Fromthat, more and more will blossom. The potentialities from your center are usedfor further extrapolation in the next venture.From what I have seen in the history of the arts in New York, when money ispoured on something it flowers. With money there has to be a flow. I had abeautiful experience of a man with money when I was a trustee of the BollingenFoundation, which was founded by Paul Mellon, an enormously wealthy man. He andhis wife had been in analysis with Carl Jung when the war came and they had toleave Switzerland. They asked Jung what they could give him in the way of a giftto express their gratitude for what he had done. He suggested they establish afoundation for the interpretation and study of symbols. That’s what they did,and it is an example of a lot of money being put to the right use. The influenceof that Bollingen Series on the literature and science of America has beenenormous. Without that money it would never have happened.You have to have not only the energy, but also the capacity of mind that givesthe model of the channel—with that, life really flowers. When you put the moneyin the wrong place. it can be devastating. Where is the money going and where isit coming from in the economy of a nation, the economy of a city? That’s one ofthe big problems. You can turn a flowering culture into a desiccating culturejust by wrong channeling.I always think you can translate sociology into psychology. It has to do withenergy distribution. What are you going to do with your money? What factor inyour own consciousness are you going to favor in the spending of the money? Forinstance, I have a seventy-five-dollar book coming out. Some people will saythat is expensive, but those same people will spend one-hundred-and-fiftydollars to have dinner in a restaurant with another couple. So, is the moneygoing up here in your mind or is it going down here in your stomach? Up here,you can’t replace the book I would have given you; but down here, you could havebought cheaper food that would have been just as nourishing."},{"pageContent":"IF you’re getting a degree to compen-sate for an inferiority complex, give upthe complex, because it’s an artificial thing.When you’re going for a degree, you don’t do what you want to do. You find outwhat the professor wants you to do to get the degree, and you just do it. If youwant a degree so you can teach, the idea is to get the degree in the quickest,easiest way. When you have it, then you can expand and get your education.I was given a fellowship to go to Europe, and I went to the University of Paris.I was working on medieval French and Provençal and on the troubadour poetry.When I got to Europe, I discovered Modern Art: James Joyce, Picasso,Mondrian—the whole bunch of them. Paris in 1927–28 was something else. Then Iwent to Germany and started studying Sanskrit and got all involved in Hinduism.I discovered Jung while in Germany. Everything was opening up—this way, thatway. Well, my question then was, “Am I going to go back into that bottle?” Myinterest in Celtic Romance was gone.I went to the university and said, “Listen, I don’t want to get back into thatbottle.” I had put in all the hours necessary for the degree; all I had to dowas write that goddamn thesis. They wouldn’t let me move into another place andcontinue my education, so I said to hell with it. I went up into the woods andspent five years reading. I never got the Ph.D. I learned to live on absolutelynothing. I was free and had no responsibilities. It was marvelous. It takes courageto do what you want. Other peoplehave a lot of plans for you. Nobody wants you to dowhat you want to do. They want you to go on their trip,but you can do what you want. I did. I went into the woodsand read for five years. It was from 1929 to 1934, five years. I went up to a little shack in Woodstock,New York, and just dug in. All I did was read, read, read, and take notes. Itwas during the Great Depression. I didn’t have any money, but there was animportant book firm in New York called Stechert-Hafner, and I would write tothem for books—the books of Frobenius were expensive—and they’d send me copies,and I wouldn’t pay. That was the way people behaved during the depression. Theywaited until I got a job, and then I paid them. That was noble. I reallyappreciated that.I read Joyce and Mann and Spengler. Spengler speaks about Nietzsche. I go toNietzsche. I then find you can’t read Nietzsche until you’ve read Schopenhauer,so I go to Schopenhauer. I find you can’t read Schopenhauer until you’ve readKant. Then I go to Kant—well, okay, you can start there, but it’s tough going.Then Goethe.The exciting thing was to see that Joyce was actually dealing with the samematerial. He never mentions the name of Schopenhauer, but I can prove he was amajor figure in Joyce’s construction of his system. Then I read Jung, and I seethat the structure of his thinking is basically the same as that of Spengler’s,and I’m putting all this stuff together…I don’t know what it was during those five years, but I was convinced I wouldstill be alive for a little while. I remember one time when I had a dollar billin the top drawer of a little chest, and I knew as long as that was there Istill had resources. It was great. I had no responsibilities, none. It wasexciting—writing journals, trying to find out what I wanted. I still have thosethings. When I look into them now, I can’t believe it.Actually, there were times when I almost thought—almost thought—”Jeez, I wishsomeone would tell me what I had to do,” that kind of thing. Freedom involvesmaking decisions, and each decision is a destiny decision. It’s very difficultto find in the outside world something that matches what the system inside youis yearning for. My feeling now is that I had a perfect life: what I needed camealong just when I needed it. What I needed then was life without a job for fiveyears. It was fundamental.As Schopenhauer says, when you look back on your life, it looks as though itwere a plot, but when you are into it, it’s a mess: just one surprise afteranother. Then, later, you see it was perfect. So, I have a theory that if youare on your own path things are going to come to you. Since it’s your own path,and no one has ever been on it before, there’s no precedent, so everything thathappens is a surprise and is timely."},{"pageContent":"In the midst of my time in Woodstock, I decided I would look for a job. I had alittle Model A Ford, and I drove it across the continent right in the middle ofthe Great Depression. I will never forget that drive. I’d pass automobiles onthe road that had broken down with whole families in them. It was awful. Peopleof today have no notion of what went on at that time.When I started driving to the west coast from New York in that car, I drove downthrough Virginia and stopped at a beautiful natural bridge. I spent two hoursjust walking back and forth in that natural bridge area, thinking how GeorgeWashington was a surveyor here and all that kind of thing. Somehow I felt thatit was teaching me something, that I was learning something. I put it in mydiary as a very important experience.When I arrived out here, there was no job, and when you get to California, youcan’t keep driving west. On a boat back from Hawaii in 1925, I had met a girlwho was living in San Jose. We’d kept a long-range correspondence, littlepostcards from here and there. I was going down to Carmel, so I thought, “Whynot drop in on Idell and just say ‘Hi.’” So I dropped in—“Hello, hello, hello.”“You’re going down to Carmel? Let me go down with you. My sister Carol’s downthere. She’s married a chap who wants to be a writer. I’ll introduce you.”Her sister was married to John Steinbeck, so I met him. And I discovered a worldof wonderful people sitting around wondering what to do next. The people in thiscrowd were John and Carol Steinbeck, Rich Lovejoy and his wife, Natalya—“Tal,”who was doing Steinbeck’s typing—and Ed Rickets—”Doc” in John’s novels. Rich andTal are the couple in Cannery Row. By the way, that party in Cannery Row wasgiven for me—Steinbeck put another cast of characters in it.Nobody, except Ed, had a job or anything of the kind. Everybody was “without anystrings,” you know, just flopping around. Steinbeck was writing and writing andwriting. He’d just finished a book called Pastures of Heaven and was starting ToA God Unknown. When I arrived, the first thing he said was, “Come, let me readyou the first chapter of my book.” I was twenty-eight, and he was aboutthirty-four or -five. He found me a place to live, a tiny little house on 4thStreet called the Canary Cottage, right next to a house owned by Ed.When you’re at a loss, you’re really at a loss. I had no philosophy. I had noanything after Columbia—we had been studying John Dewey for God’s sake. In theCarmel library, my hand went up to a book in two volumes, Decline of the West byOswald Spengler, and, boy, that was the thunderbolt. Spengler says, “Young man,if you want to be in the world of the future, put your paintbrush and poet’s penon the shelf and pick up the monkey wrench or the law book.” I said toStein-beck, “Listen, you have to read this thing.” When I had finished the firstvolume, I gave it to him. He came back a little while later and said, “Oh, Ican’t read this. Oh—my art.” He was knocked out for about two weeks and couldn’twrite.One day, after he had recovered from the paragraph in Spengler, he was walkingaround, rubbing his sides, saying, “I feel creative.” Steinbeck was always goingaround rubbing his sides. He loved to rub his sides. Another day, he came in andsaid, “I’ve sold Pastures of Heaven, and they want my next two books.” Well, Iknow now that every publisher who takes your first book wants your next two,because they’re not going to advertise you and then lose you to somebody else.That was a great day, so we had a party.After I’d read Spengler’s book, which was a major experience for me, I said toEd, “Say, Ed, you know, I’ve been saying ‘no’ to life all my life, and I thinkI’d better begin saying 'yes.’” He said, “Well, the way to do that is to getdrunk. Let’s have a party.\" It was in the middle of, not only the Depression,but also Prohibition. He said, “I’ll use my laboratory alcohol, and we’ll putsomething together.\"Jesus, that was a night! He mixed this concoction of fruit juice and alcohol ina bowl. Then he put that bowl in a larger bowl, and put salted ice around it tokeep it cold. We started the party around four in the afternoon, and at threeo’clock in the morning, a police car pulled up to the front door and two copscame in. They said, “What's going on here?” Well, Steinbeck knew them, so hesaid, “We’re having a party. Here, have a drink.” Now we had stopped drinkingabout an hour before, and meanwhile, the center bowl had shipped salt water, soit was now alcohol, fruit juice, and salt water. Well, when those two copstasted that drink, they just looked at us as if to say, “What the hell are youpeople drink-ing here?” And that was that."},{"pageContent":"Ed Rickets was the only one who had work.

When the tide was low where there was goodcatching—for instance, up at Santa Cruz—we would all go off to collect thesedamned things for Ed.He was great with animals. He had two rattle-snakes in a box in the lab, and heinvited us all down one day to see him feed white mice to the snakes. Well, thiswas something. Steinbeck actually wrote a short story about it. Here’s thissnake that’s been asleep for weeks—snakes with nothing to do are like that. Eddrops this white mouse in the cage with the snake, and we’re all gathered aroundto watch. Somehow, you’re automatically on the mouse's side. The little mousesniffs around and goes up the length of the snake, and finally he gets the ideathat this isn’t a good place to be, so he goes into the corner and sits there.The rattlesnake looks at the mouse, moves over, and—“Bing!”—hits it. Two littlered spots appear on the mouse’s nose, and it just spins up and flops back. So,the mouse is dead, and the snake is alive, so now you’re on the side of therattlesnake trying to eat that mouse—the mouse is bigger around than the snake’sdiameter.Ed says, “Now watch him. He’s going to unhook his jaws.” He unhooks his jaws andbegins injesting the mouse—you could see it changing shape in the snake’s mouth,because the saliva has digestive qualities. I tell you, you felt it right inyour throat. The most absurd moment was when the rattlesnake got tired, andthere was nothing left but two legs and a tail sticking out of its mouth. Butpresently that went down too."},{"pageContent":"Every detail of those years stands out in my memory. In Goethe’s wonderful bookWilhelm Meister’s Student Years, and again in Wilhelm Meister’s Wander Years,there’s the idea of bumping into experience and people while you’re wandering.You really are experiencing life that way. Nothing is routine, nothing is takenfor granted. Everything is standing out on it’s own, because everything is apossibility, everything is a clue, everything is talking to you. It’s marvelous.It’s as though you had a nose that brought you into the right places. You are infor wonderful moments when you travel like that—for example, my putting up myhand in the Carmel library and finding a book that became a destiny book. Itreally did! That rambling is a chance to sniff things out and somehow get asense of where you feel you can settle.The poor chap who gets himself in a job and goes down that groove all his life.…A friend gave me a list of things that let you know you are old. Some of themare silly, others are serious. One is “…when you sink your teeth into a juicysteak and they stay there.” Another is “…when your back goes out more often thanyou do.” “…When you see a pretty girl, the garage door flies open responding toyour pacemaker.” The really serious one is “…when you’ve gotten to the top ofthe ladder and find it’s against the wrong wall.” And that’s where so manypeople are. It’s dreadful. And then, Jesus, to descend the whole ladder andstart up another… Forget the ladder and just wander, bump around.I spent eight months rambling. I studied Russian for no reason except that itwas the next language to learn after I’d learned Spanish, French, and German. Iread War and Peace in Russian. I can’t read two words in Russian now, but it gotme into the Russian community in Los Angeles, where there were lots of peoplewho’d come here after the revolution. It was wonderful Then I got into my carand went somewhere else.After a year in California, I returned to New York to take a job in a prepschool. I was paid nine-hundred dollars for teaching the boys corrective Germanand French, Ancient History, and English. Meanwhile, I was their nursemaid: Iput them to bed at night, got them up in the morning, made them obey, and thentook them out on the athletic field. I’ll tell you, that was another kind oflife, and I couldn’t take it. I was in a beautiful school, a beautiful job, butI knew I was off the rails. I went right back on the Depression.Oh, those were grand experiences. I was just flop-ping around, sniffing out whatI would do and what I wouldn’t do. I only wanted to do what made sense to myinterior. I don’t see how one can live otherwise. And nothing is better thanreading when there is nothing else to do.When you wander, think of what you want to do that day, not what you toldyourself you were going to want to do. And there are two things you must notworry about when you have no responsibilities: one is being hungry, and theother is what people will think of you. Wandering time is positive. Don’t thinkof new things, don’t think of achievement, don’t think of any-thing of the kind.Just think, “Where do I feel good? What is giving me joy?”I mean it. This is simply basic. Get those pressure ideas out of your system,and then you can find, like a ball on a roulette wheel, where you are going toland. The roulette ball doesn’t say, “Well, people will think better of me overthere than over there.” Take what comes and be where you like. What counts isbeing where you feel you’re in your place. What people think is their problem. “What will they think of me?”—must be put aside for bliss. My parents never pushed me around. I had special luck there. By the time I wasinvited to teach at Sarah Lawrence, I had decided that I didn't need a job anddid not want one. It would interrupt my reading. But when I saw that school fullof gorgeous girls, I thought, “Well this is alright.” When I finally got thatjob, I was thirty years old, and Dad said, “Joe, I thought you were going to bea literary bum.” But until I got the job, he never said a word. He was a goodfather. When The Hero with a Thousand Faces came out, he said, “I prophesy thisis going to be a wonderful book.” He hadn’t read a word of it, but he knew hisboy had done it.I know that wandering might seem a strange form of life to someone with ascience background, which tends to give you a prospect out ahead of what you’redoing, but while wandering, you experience a kind of mysteriously organicprocess. It’s like a tree growing. It doesn’t know where it’s growing next. Abranch may grow out this way, then that way, and then another way. If you let itbe that way and don’t have pressures from outside, when you look back, you’llsee that this will have been an organic development. Just remember: Parzivalblew the job when he did what people expected him to do."},{"pageContent":"THE Grail Hero—particularly in the person of Perceval or Parzival, the “GreatFool”—is the forthright, simple, uncorrupted, noble son of nature, withoutguile, strong in the purity of the yearning of his heart. In the words of thepoet Wolfram von Eschenbach…describing his Grail Hero’s childhood in the forest:“Of sorrow he knew nothing, unless it was the birdsong above him; for thesweet-ness of it pierced his heart and made his little bosom swell: His natureand his yearning so compelled him.”24 [part0105.html#footnote24] His widowed,noble mother, in their forest retreat had told him of God and Satan,“distinguished for him dark and light.”25 [part0105.html#footnote25] However, inhis own deeds light and dark were mixed. He was not an angel or a saint, but aliving, questing man of deeds, gifted with paired virtues of courage andcompassion, to which was added loyalty. And it was through his steadfast-ness inthese—not supernatural grace—that he won, at last, to the Grail.26[part0105.html#footnote26]Parzival makes two visits to the Grail Castle. The first is a failure. The GrailKing is a wounded man, whose nature has been broken by castration in a battle.Parzival spontaneously wishes to ask him, “What is wrong?\" But then, he has beentold that a knight does not ask questions, and so, in order to preserve theimage of himself as a noble knight, he restrains his natural impulse ofcompassion, and the Grail quest fails. …in the end, as in the case of Parzival, the guide within will be his own nobleheart alone, and the guide without, the image of beauty, the radiance ofdivinity, that wakes in his heart amor: the deepest, inmost seed of his nature,consubstantial with the process of the All, “thus come.” And in thislife-creative adventure the criterion of achievement will be…the courage to letgo the past, with its truths, its goals, its dogmas of “meaning,” and its gifts:to die to the world and come to birth from within.27 [part0105.html#footnote27]The twelfth centuryis the follow-your-bliss time. What the Holy Grail symbolizes is the highest spiritual fulfillment of a humanlife. Each life has some kind of high fulfillment, and each has its own giftfrom the Grail. The theme of compassion is part of the clue about how to getthere and where it is. It has to do with overcoming the same temptations thatthe Buddha overcame: of attachment to this, that, or the other life detail thathas pulled you off course.What pulls you off from spiritual fulfillment? I know when my life is not in thecenter. I get desirously involved with my relation to some achievement or systemthat is tangential to the real centering of my life. And I know when I’m ontrack—that is, when every-thing is in a harmonious relationship to what I regardas the best I’ve got in me.In the Grail legends, the land of people doing what they think they ought to door have to do is the wasteland. What is the wasteland to you? I know damned wellwhat the wasteland would be to me: the academic approach to my material; or amarriage to someone who had no thoughts or feelings for me or my work. Livingwith such a person would be the wasteland.I find working for money to be the wasteland—doing something that somebody elsewants instead of the thing that is my next step. I have been guided all along bya strong revulsion from any sort of action that does not correspond to theimpulse of my own wish. The person of noble heartacts spontaneouslyand will avoid the wasteland,the world of “Thou Shalt.” “I will not serve that in which I no longer believe whether it call itself myhome, my fatherland, or my church.…And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even agreat mistake, a lifelong mistake, and perhaps as long as eternity too.”—Stephen Dedalus28 [part0105.html#footnote28]The crucial thing to live for is the sense of life in what you are doing, and ifthat is not there, then you are living according to other peoples’ notions ofhow life should be lived.The opposite to doing what you think you ought to do is compassion. The one whofinds the Grail is symbolic of the one who has come to that place and whose lifeis of compassion. The one who finds as his motivation the dynamism of hiscompassion has found the Grail. That means spontaneous recognition of theidentity of I and Thou. This is the Grail center.To become—in Jung’s terms—individuated, to live as a released individual, onehas to know how and when to put on and to put off the masks of one's variouslife roles.…The aim of individuation requires that one should find and thenlearn to live out of one’s own center, in control of one’s for and against. Andthis cannot be achieved by enacting and responding to any general masquerade offixed roles.29 [part0105.html#footnote29]Parzival achieves the Grail Castle, and Galahad beholds the Grail. These are twototally different Grail traditions. Parzival is the fulfilled, secular man.Galahad is the monastic, chaste knight, who has insulated himself from life.In the story of Sir Galahad, the knights agree to go on a quest, but thinking itwould be a disgrace to go forth in a group, each “entered into the forest, atone point or another, there where they saw it to be thickest, all in thoseplaces where they found no way or path.”30 [part0105.html#footnote30] Wherethere is a way or a path, it’s someone else's way. Each knight enters the forestat the most mysterious point and follows his own intuition. What each bringsforth is what never before was on land or sea: the fulfillment of his uniquepotentialities, which are different from anybody else’s. All you get on yourlife way are little clues.In that wonderful story, when any knight sees the trail of another, thinks he’sgetting there, and starts to follow the other’s track, he goes astray entirely. “In the last analysis, every life is the realization of a whole, that is, of aself, for which reason this realization can be called ‘individuation.’ All lifeis bound to individual carriers who realize it, and it is simply inconceivablewithout them. But every carrier is charged with an individual destiny anddestination, and the realization of this alone makes sense of life.”—Jung31[part0105.html#footnote31]"},{"pageContent":"part0105.html#footnote31In all traditional systems, whether of the Orient or of the Occident, theauthorized mythological forms are presented in rites to which the individual isexpected to respond with an experience of commitment and belief. But suppose hefails to do so? Suppose the entire inheritance of mythological, theological, andphilosophical forms fails to wake in him any authentic response of this kind?How then is he to behave? The normal way is to fake it, to feel oneself to beinadequate, to pretend to believe, to strive to believe, and to live, in theimitation of others, an inauthentic life. The authentic creative way, on theother hand, which I would term the way of art as opposed to religion, is,rather, to reverse this authoritative order.32 [part0105.html#footnote32] As in the novels of Joyce, so in those of Mann, the key to the progression liesin the stress on what is inward.…In the words of Joyce’s hero: “When the soul ofa man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back fromflight. You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly bythose nets.”33 [part0105.html#footnote33]For what to the soul are nets, “flung at it to hold it back from flight,\" canbecome for the one who has found his own center the garment, freely chosen, ofhis further adventure.34 [part0105.html#footnote34] What kind of action and life experience would be appropriate for one who has hadthis fulfilling moment of the Grail experience? There are no rules for what youdo. Buddha came back and taught for fifty years. To answer such a question, onewould have to predict the circumstances of the life that one would enter.Once you’ve achieved the experience, you have to achieve it the next second andthe next second also. The process of achievement comes in translating theexperiences of life into that eternal elixir, which is the “happy with Himforever in Heaven” part of the answer to the penny catechism question: “Why didGod make you?” The answer I learned was: “God made me to know Him, to love Him,and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him forever in Heaven.”Translating that into metaphor: Heaven is the symbol of the eternal life that iswithin you. It’s a basic aspect of yourself for-ever. That’s the rapture. Andthen, temporal life asks for “knowing, loving, and serving… God,” the generatingenergy of the life that is within you and all things.My experience is that I can feel that I’m in the Grail Castle when I’m livingwith people I love, doing what I love. I get that sense of being fulfilled. But,by god, it doesn’t take much to make me feel I’ve lost the Castle, it’s gone.One way to lose the Grail is to go to a cock-tail party. That’s my idea of notbeing there at all.My sense of it is that you have to keep working to get there. It may take alittle while. Even when you have gotten there, it’s easy to get flipped out,because the world has things it wants you to do and you have decided not to dowhat the world wants. The problem is to find a field of action to give you thatinner satisfaction so that you’re not thrown out. …not all, even today, are of that supine sort that must have their life valuesgiven them, cried at them from the pulpits and other mass media of the day. Forthere is, in fact, in quiet places, a great deal of deep spiritual quest andfinding now in progress in this world, outside the sanctified social centers,beyond their purview and control: in small groups, here and there, and moreoften, more typically (as anyone who looks around may learn), by ones and twos,there entering the forest at those points which they themselves have chosen,where they see it to be most dark, and there is no beaten way or path.35[part0105.html#footnote35]"},{"pageContent":"The hero’s journey always begins with the call. One way or another, a guide mustcome to say, “Look, you’re in Sleepy Land. Wake. Come on a trip. There is awhole aspect of your consciousness, your being, that’s not been touched. Soyou’re at home here? Well, there’s not enough of you there.” And so it starts. The herald or announcer of the adventure…is often dark, loathly, or terrifying,judged evil by the world; yet if one could follow, the way would be openedthrough the walls of day into the dark where the jewels glow.36[part0105.html#footnote36] The call is to leave a certain social situation, move into your own lonelinessand find the jewel, the center that’s impossible to find when you’re sociallyengaged. You are thrown off-center, and when you feel off-center, it’s time togo. This is the departure when the hero feels something has been lost and goesto find it. You are to cross the threshold into new life. It’s a dangerousadventure, because you are moving out of the sphere of the knowledge of you andyour community. The first step, detachment or withdrawal, consists in a radical transfer ofemphasis from the external to the internal world, macro- to microcosm, a retreatfrom the desperations of the waste land to the peace of the everlasting realmthat is within. But this realm, as we know from psychoanalysis, is precisely theinfantile unconscious. It is the realm that we enter in sleep. We carry itwithin ourselves forever. All the ogres and secret helpers of our nursery arethere, all the magic of childhood. And more important, all thelife-potentialities that we never managed to bring to adult realization, thoseother portions of ourself, are there; for such golden seeds do not die.37[part0105.html#footnote37] When one thinks of some reason for not going or has fear and remains in societybecause it’s safe, the results are radically different from what happens whenone follows the call. If you refuse to go, then you are someone else’s servant.When this refusal of the call happens, there is a kind of drying up, a sense oflife lost. Everything in you knows that a required adventure has been refused.Anxieties build up. What you have refused to experience in a positive way, youwill experience in a negative way.If what you are following, however, is your own true adventure, if it issomething appropriate to your deep spiritual need or readiness, then magicalguides will appear to help you. If you say, “Everyone’s going on this trip thisyear, and I’m going too,” then no guides will appear. Your adventure has to becoming right out of your own interior. If you are ready for it, then doors willopen where there were no doors before, and where there would not be doors foranyone else. And you must have courage. It’s the call to adventure, which meansthere is no security, no rules.When you cross the threshold, you are passing into the dark forest, taking aplunge into the sea, embarking upon the night sea journey. It involves passingthrough clashing rocks, narrow gates, or the like, which represent yes and no,the pairs of opposites. There will be a moment when the walls of the world seemto open for a second, and you get an insight through. Jump then! Go! The gateswill often close so fast that they take off the tail of your horse. You may bedismembered, lose everything you have. This is Christ leaving the Mother, theworld, and going to the Father, the Spirit. This is Jonah swallowed by thewhale, its jaws being the pairs of opposites.What this represents psychologically is the trip from the realm of conscious,rational intentions into the zone of those energies of the body that are movingfrom another center: the center with which you are trying to get in touch.As you now go towards the center, there will come more aids, as well asincreasingly difficult trials. You have to give up more and more of what you’rehanging on to. The final thing is a total giving up, a yielding all the way.This is a place directly opposite to your life experiences and all that you’vebeen taught in school. Psychologically, it’s a shift into the unconscious;otherwise, it’s a move into a field of action of which you know nothing.Anything can happen, and it may be favorable or unfavorable.The deeper you go, and the closer you get to the final realization, the heavierthe resistance. You are coming down to those areas that are the ones that arerepressed, and it’s that repression system that you have to pass through. Andthere, of course, is where magical aid is most required. The hero may herediscover for the first time that there is everywhere a benign power supportinghim in his superhuman passage.You come then to the final experience of discovering and making your own thatwhich was lacking in the place from which you departed. This experience can berendered in four different ways.One rendition is the Sacred Marriage, the meeting with the beloved which bringsthe birth of your own spiritual life, with the bride being whatever the life isthat your relating to: male/female, I/Thou, this/that.Another rendering is Atonement with the Father. The son has been separated fromthe father, meaning he has been living a life that’s inappropriate to his realheritage. The son is the temporal aspect, and the father is the eternal aspectof the same being. The father represents the natural order from which you havebeen removed. You are trying to find your character, which you inherit from yourfather. Atonement is bringing your own personal and contemporary program intoaccord with the life momentum out of which you have come.Then there is Apotheosis, the realization that “I am that which all these otherbeings are.” The hero knows that he is It, the Buddha image, the knower of thetruth. “The Kingdom of the Father is spread upon the earth and men do not seeit.” That’s the illumination that comes with Apotheosis. You are not allowedthat realization in Christianity, except in Gnostic Christianity. You can’t say,“The Christhood is in me.”Finally there’s the Elixir Theft, an entirely different sort of realization.Instead of a slow progress through the mysteries with the good will of thepowers, there is a violent pressure through and a seizing—the fire theft byPrometheus or the use of LSD in the 60s—and you flee from the powers that youdid not appease on the way. This is the transformation flight, where the hero,with the powers after him, carries his goods back to the light world as fast ashe can. Or one can have a schizophrenic crack up and stay down there. The two worlds, the divine and the human, can be pictured only as distinct fromeach other—different as life and death, as day and night. The hero adventuresout of the land we know into darkness; there he accomplishes his adventure, oragain is simply lost to us, imprisoned, or in danger; and his return isdescribed as a coming back out of that yonder zone. Nevertheless—and here is agreat key to the understanding of myth and symbol—the two kingdoms are actuallyone. The realm of the gods is a forgotten dimension of the world we know.38[part0105.html#footnote38] An image of the return that amuses me is that of a young man who comes fromWisconsin to New York to study art. He’s gone into Greenwich Village, theunderworld of Manhattan. He has a number of nymphs to help him and a master withwhom he is studying. He finally achieves an art style. Then, having achieved hisstyle, he comes to 57th Street with his paintings, and he meets the cold eye ofthe dealer. The great problem is bringing lifeback into the wasteland,where people live inauthentically. Bringing back the gift to integrate it into a rational life is very difficult.It is even more difficult than going down into the underworld. What you have tobring back is something that the world lacks—which is why you went to get it—andlacking it, the world does not know that it needs it. And so, on the return,when you come with your boon for the world and there is no reception, what areyou going to do? There are three possible reactions.One answer is to say, “To hell with them, I’m going back to the woods.” You buyyourself a dog and a pipe and let the weeds grow in the gate. You have come backto the world with your gift, and people look at you with glassy eyes, call you“a kook,” and so you retreat. This is refusal of the return.The second way is to say, “What do they want?” You have a skill. You can givethem what they want, the commercial way. Then you have created a whole pitch foryour expressivity, and what you had before gets lost. You have a public career,and you have renounced the jewel.The third possibility is to try to find some aspect of the domain into which youhave come that can receive a little portion of what you have to give. You try tofind a means to deliver what you have found as the life boon in terms and inproportions that are proper to the world’s ability to receive. It requires agood deal of compassion and patience. Look for cracks in the wall and give onlyto those who are ready for your jewel.If all else fails, you can get a job teaching and introduce your message to thepeople who are studying with you. If you can get one little hook into the givensociety, you will find presently that you are able to deliver your message.Artists who teach are an example of this: they are doing their creative work,but they are being sustained by something that is secondary to their primaryjob. They are receiving adequate income and gradually build up a following.You do not have a complete adventure unless you do get back. There is a time togo into the woods and a time to come back, and you know which it is. Do you havethe courage? It takes a hell of a lot of courage to return after you’ve been inthe woods.Those are modes of having this realization, and the final thing is knowing,loving, and serving life in a way in which you are eternally at rest. That pointof rest has got to be in all of it. Even though you are active out there in theworld, within you there’s a point of complete composure and rest. When that’snot there, then you are in agony. When the worldseems to be falling apart,the rule is to hang onto your own bliss.It’s that life that survives.Freedom to pass back and forth across the world division …is the talent of themaster. The Cosmic Dancer, declares Nietzsche, does not rest heavily in a singlespot, but gaily, lightly, turns and leaps from one position to another.39[part0105.html#footnote39]"},{"pageContent":"THERE is a Japanese saying I recall once having heard, of the five stages of aman’s growth: “At ten, an animal; at twenty, a lunatic; at thirty, a failure; atforty, a fraud; at fifty, a criminal.\" And at sixty, I would add (since by thattime one will have gone through all this), one begins advising one’s friends;and at seventy (realizing that everything said has been misunderstood) one keepsquiet and is taken for a sage. “At eighty,” then said Confucius, “I knew myground and stood firm.”40 [part0105.html#footnote40] Jung speaks of the curve of a lifetime being divided in half: the first half isthe time of relationships, and the second half is the time of finding the senseof life within; or, as the Hindus say, “following the marga”—the path, thefootsteps of the human experience you’ve had—to your own inward life. And then,total disengagement. going through the last passage without anxiety, with-outfear. You go to your death singing. “As a physician I am convinced that it is hygienic…to discover in death a goaltoward which one can strive; and that shrinking away from it is somethingunhealthy and abnormal which robs the second half of life of itspurpose.”—Jung41 [part0105.html#footnote41] It is important to know how old you are in spiritual development, where you areon this path. The function of initiations is to commit one’s whole psychologicalpitch to the requirements of a particular stage in life. The big initiation iswhen one has to leave the psychology of childhood behind: the death of theinfantile ego, which is dependant and obedient, and the birth of theself-reliant adult participating in the society.The first quarter of life is that of student, and the ideal there isobedience—“comeliness of appearance and sweetness of conduct,” according toDante—and this would mean conforming generally to the patterns required by thesociety. This interval is what Nietzsche calls the period of the camel, for thecamel gets down on his knees and asks to have a load put on him.The second quarter is that of householder; that is to say, you have moved intothe responsibilities of adult life. In the Indian system, your responsibilitiesare dictated in terms of the dharma, the law of your social order. In oursociety, you voluntarily choose your responsibilities, and it is through theassumption of those responsibilities, whatever they may be, that you achieveyour position, name, and fame in the world. Making such choices involves adevelopment of the ego function, the function of independent evaluation, andyour assumption of tasks and positions is relevant to your own valuedeterminations. This period is the age of the dragon on whose every scale areemblazoned the words “Thou Shalt.”Midlife is typically the period, not of achievement, but of realization, and itshould be the period of fulfillment. In Nietzsche’s stages, when the camel iswell-loaded, it gets to its feet and goes out into the desert and turns into alion. The lion’s job is to kill the dragon named Thou Shalt. When it has beenkilled by the lion of self-discovery, all the energy that had been caught up inthe dragon is now yours. People in mid-life who are still expecting benefitsfrom being good, or punishment from being bad, are delayed. Their infantile egosare still operating in midlife, and this is not appropriate.When you come into Jung’s second stage, the last half of life, the quest is forthe import of the OM that you’ve heard in the heart cakra, so that it willbecome the forming and structuring energy of your life, without care forachievement, without care for prestige."},{"pageContent":"Almost anyone making a transition would have an experience of shedding the oldskin. Suppose you have shed the serpent’s skin but want to leave some tagged onthe end. This is a major problem. It is an anxiety that has to do with what’sback there. You have to know enough to cut it off. You have to know what it isthat’s hanging on: the old skin that is being peeled away gradually, bit by bit,like taking off a bandage without pulling all the hair.Sri Ramakrishna, talking about this fundamental stage of renunciation—“goinginto the forest,” in the Indian system—speaks of three kinds of renunciation.The first is gradual renunciation. That’s where you know the time is coming, youtake advice from your guru or chaplain or whatever, you think it out, makearrangements for the place you’re going, and so on. If you are a man, youtransfer your dharma to your son. He is the one that now has to carry on thedharma of the family, and you are released from that. Then you are nobody, nolonger in caste. It’s a real, real quittance.The second is sudden renunciation is. Ramakrishna gives the example of a man whois on his way down to the stream to wash one morning, when he has an argumentwith his wife. The man says to her, “Now you shut up, or I will go into theforest, become a yogi, and you’ll never see me again.” She says, “Oh, you wouldnever do that.” And he says, “I wouldn’t? Watch.” And he walks into the forestwith his towel on his shoulder. That’s sudden renunciation.Then there is what he calls “monkey renunciation,” when a man who has gone awayinto the forest finds a nice comfortable ashram. He writes back to his familythat he has gone to the ashram, and it’s going fine. That is not renunciation.The recommended one is gradual renunciation. That means getting quit of what youcan in a decent, organic way. You can even take with you a few littleresponsibilities, with the understanding that they are terminal—you’re not goingto add to them. The responsibilities that you add will be those of your own newcondition, whatever that may be.Now in my case, I leave for the forest, as it were—actually, for Hawaii—withthree volumes of a book to do, but it’s still renunciation: I’ve cut off mylecturing, and I’m settling in out there with my library and my notes, and I’mjust digging in. Renunciation is literally a death and a resurrection. It wasn’teasy writing letters to people I’m fond of, people I like working with, andsaying I wouldn’t be able to go on these lecture trips.I like Hawaii. It’s nice to be in a place where every-body’s having a good time.No children are allowed in the building, so all around us are people of aboutour own age, all still married. It is so nice to be with people still in lovewith each other after all the rough water of the years past. It’s like shipsthat have come into harbor and are now just floating with all kinds of seastories.I work out on a veranda—they call it a “lanai” out there—with my back to theocean and to what’s going on.

That’s what you’ve already earned, and it hasto support this relatively carefree last stage of life. Since I am myself inthat stage now, I can tell you that it is the best part of life. It’s properlycalled, in this wonder-ful language that we have, the “Golden Years.” It is aperiod when everything is coming up and flowering. It is very, very sweet.…the old in many societies spend a considerable part of their time playing withand taking care of the youngsters, while the parents delve and spin: so that theold are returned to the sphere of eternal things not only within but without.And we may take it also, I should think, that the consider-able mutualattraction of the very young and the very old may derive something from theircommon, secret knowledge that it is they, and not the busy generation between,who are concerned with a poetic play that is eternal and truly wise.43[part0105.html#footnote43] The image of decline in old age is a bit deceptive, because even though yourenergies are not those of early youth—that was the time of moving into thefield. of making all the big drives—now you are in the field, and this is thetime of the opening flower, the real fulfillment, the bringing forth of what youhave prepared yourself to bring forth. It is a wonderful moment. It is not aloss situation, as if you’re throwing off some-thing to go down. Not at all. Itis a blooming.“When he comes to weakness—whether he come to weakness through old age orthrough disease—this person frees himself from these limbs just as a mango, or afig, or a berry releases itself from its bond; and he hastens again, accordingto the entrance and place of origin, back to life.

Here he comes!’ so indeed do all thingswait for him who has this knowledge and cry: ‘Here is the Imperishable coming!Here is the Imperishable coming!’” —Bṛhadāranyaka Upaniṣad, 4.3.36–3744[part0105.html#footnote44]"},{"pageContent":"PEOPLE ask me, “What can we have for rituals?” Well, what do you want to have aritual for? You should have a ritual for your life. All a ritual does isconcentrate your mind on the implications of what you are doing. For instance,the marriage ritual is a meditation on the step you are taking in learning tobecome a member of a duad, instead of one individual all alone. The ritualenables you to make the transit. Ritual introduces youto the meaning of what’s going on. Saying grace before mealslets you know that you’re about to eatsomething that once was alive. When eating a meal, realize what you are doing. Hunting peoples thank the animalfor having given itself. They feel real gratitude. The main rituals of maturehunting tribes, like those of the Americas, were addressed to the animal. On theNorthwest Coast, the principle rites were when the first wave of salmon came in,and they were intended to thank the salmon. The life of the animal that you’ve takenis given back when you recognizewhat you’ve done. And so, sitting down to eat, realize what you are doing: you are eating a lifethat has been given so that you might live. …man, like no other animal, not only knows that he is killing when he kills butalso knows that he too will die; and the length of his old age, furthermore,is—like his infancy—a lifetime in itself, as long as the entire span of many abeast.45 [part0105.html#footnote45] When I was working on the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, I had a lot of meals withthe monks. Their grace before meals is the most beautiful invocation. It goeslike this: “brahman is the cosmic, universal, life consciousness energy of whichwe are all manifestations. brahman is the sacrifice. brahman is the food that weare eating. brahman is the consumer of the sacrifice. brahman is the ladle thatcarries the sacrifice to the fire. brahman is the process of the sacrifice. Hewho recognizes that all things are brahman is on the way to realizing brahman inhimself.”The meaning of this grace is that taking food into your system is like putting alibation into a sacrificial fire: the fire of your digestive apparatus consumeswhat you eat, so eating is the counterpart of a sacrifice.The communion ritual is an extension of this idea, a motif that came into theworld with the dawn of agriculture: “If the seed does not die, there is noplant.” It dies as seed and yields to the sprout. Now, since we are composed ofspirit and matter—the two substances are what live in us—we need two types offood. The food that nourishes our material part—vegetables, animals, whatever itis we eat—is earthly food, but we must also have spiritual food, nourishment forour spiritual part. And communion, the eating of Christ, is a symbolization ofthe imbibing of that spiritual nourishment, a concretization of the idea ofmeditation, But in order to eat anything, it has to be killed, so again we havethis notion of the sacrifice. You should be willingto be eaten also.You are food body. Every ritual is of that order, properly putting your mind in touch with what youreally are doing. And so, we should realize that this event here and now: ourcoming together to help each other in the realization is a beautiful, beautifulritual.You can ritualize your entire life that way, and it’s extremely helpful to doso. The whole thing of compassion comes in there. What helped me was waking upand thinking of my penny catechism: “to know, to love, to serve God.” I don’tthink of God as up there. I think of God as right here in whatever I’m knowingand loving and serving. “To be happy with Him forever in heaven” means torecognize your own compassion, your own participation in that creature or personyou’re with. That seems to be the goal of the journey."},{"pageContent":"The principle ritual in most puberty and initiation rites is a death andresurrection ritual in which your name is changed. You die to the name you hadand are resurrected with a new identity.I once saw a film of the consecration of a group of young men who were becomingmonks. They were standing in the aisle of a church, and then they all prostratedthemselves, and a great canvas emblazoned with the cross was laid over them.When the canvas was removed, they were monks.The experience of boys being initiated in Australia and New Guinea is of death.Their eyes are covered, and they hear the bullroarer coming, and they are toldthat the dragon is coming to consume them. When itis right over their heads andthey’re about to be eaten, their eyes are uncovered, and now initiated, they seethat it’s Uncle Charlie with the bullroarer.In another such rite, described in a book about the Ona of Tierra del Fuego, theboy is in the men’s house, where there are these masked forms that he believesto be deities and punishing powers. One of them comes forward, and the boy hasto wrestle with him. The man whom he's fighting almost puts the boy down, butthen he yields. He lets the boy defeat him and pull off his mask. Then the maskis not simply regarded as a fake. It is both conquered and worshiped, because itrepresents both the bounding and the bonding power of the society. The boy putsthe mask on himself, and he is now that power. What was feared is transformedinto what is now supported.I was very much interested in the work of George Catlin, who did hundreds ofpaintings of American Indians. He traveled among the Mandan Indians in 1832 andpainted a series of pictures depicting their initiation rites. The young men arehung from the ceiling by spikes through their chests and spun around until theycollapse. One young man said to him, “Our women suffer, and we must learn tosuffer too.”That was, to me, a very interesting observation, because suffering overtakeswomen. There is nothing they can do to avoid it. When a girl has her firstmenstruation, she's a woman.Now the fear of menstrual blood, which is almost biological in the male, is inprimitive cultures emphatic. There is a real fear of it that incorporates thewhole mystery and power. Consequently, the girl’s initiation at that timeusually consists of her sitting, isolated, in a little hut, realizing that sheis a woman. Next thing she knows, in most societies, she’s a mother.I’ve been told by some women that the first crash-through of this blood is ashock and a fearful thing. It’s a threshold-crossing that you’ve been pushedacross. You don’t have to strive for anything. What you have to do is come toknow what’s happened: appreciate the implications of the biological changethat’s taken place without effort. After listening to many women, I have had therealization that the woman’s characteristic experience is having to enduresomething, and that the prime requirement is tolerance, the ability to endure.The man, on the other hand, has to go out to seek the problem. The boy,accordingly, has to be systematically withdrawn from the women and put in themen’s camp in order to find his action field. As a man, he will have to endureonly moments of great pain and struggle and difficulty with things just out ofsight, which is what gets thrown at him in the initiation rites. The boy has toenact being a man. The girl has to realize that she’s a woman. Life overtakesher.The man never has a comparable experience. That's why many male initiation ritesare so violent—so that the man knows for certain he is no longer a little boy.And that’s also why a young man has to be disengaged from his mother. In ourculture, there are mothers who understand this and assist in the separation. Aclinging mother is a terrible weight on the life of a young man. In theprimitive cultures, they are definitely separated.I was just reading of a Hindu rite in Bengal, where the woman’s condition isextremely blocked. As a girl, she has to do what her father tells her to do;when she marries, she has to do what her husband tells her to do; when he dies,if she doesn’t throw herself on the funeral pyre, she has to do what her oldestson tells her to do. She’s never her own boss. Her only strong emotionalconnections are with her children, and the strongest is with her son.So, there is this ritual to enable the woman to let her son go. Over a series ofyears, the family chaplain, the guru, comes and asks her for some valuable thingthat she must give him. It starts with some of her jewelry—about the onlypossessions she has—and then she has to give up certain food that she likes. Shehas to learn to be quit of that which she values. Then comes the time when herson is no longer a little boy, and by then she has learned how to say that themost precious thing in her life can go."},{"pageContent":"Have I ever told you about the ritual in Kentucky where I had to give up seventhings? It was one of the most interesting group experiences I’ve ever had. Wewere a group of about forty-nine people in one of those meetings of some societyfor the transformation of consciousness. Two couples from the University ofVermont, professors and their wives, had arranged a ritual that we were allgoing to undertake. We were divided into seven groups of seven and told to spenda day thinking of the seven things without which we’d not want to live: “Whatare the seven things for which you feel your life is worth living?” Then youwere to gather seven little objects, small enough to hold in your hand, whichwere to represent your seven cherished things, and you were to know which waswhich.In the evening we went down a wooded road in the dark to the mouth of a cave.The cave had a wooden door on it which could be opened. In front of the door wasa man wearing the mask of a dog: Cerberus at the gate of hell. He put his handout and said, “Give me that which you least cherish.” When you gave him one ofthe little objects you were holding, he opened the door and allowed you toenter.Then you proceeded forward through the cave, an enormous place, holding the sixremaining things you most cherished. On five further occasions, you were askedto surrender that which you least cherished, until you were left with one objectthat represented what you treasured most. And you found out what it was, believeme. You really, really did. And the order in which you gave up your treasureswas revelatory: you really knew what your order of values was. Then you came toan exit, where there were two people between whom you had to go. But before youcould go through that guarded exit, you had to give up that which you mostcherished.I can tell you that ritual worked. All of the participants with whom I’ve talkedhad an actual experience of mokṣa, “release,” when they had given up their lasttreasure. One damned fool was the exception. He did not give up anything. That’show seriously this ritual was taken. When he was asked to give up something, hejust stooped down, picked up a pebble, and handed that over. That’s the refusalof the call. …every failure to cope with a life situation must be laid, in the end, to arestriction of consciousness. Wars and temper tantrums are the makeshifts ofignorance; regrets are illuminations come too late.46 [part0105.html#footnote46] The exciting thing to me was the actual experience. It was a feeling of joyousparticipation. Watching your earlier bondages go really did change your feelingfor the treasures you’d given up. It increased your love for them without thetenacity. I was amazed."},{"pageContent":"THE meditation associated with catastrophes like the end of the world is on thisprocess of coming and going, coming and going, and settling yourself at peacewith the fact that things come and go. Apocalypsedoes not point to a fiery Armageddon,but to our ignorance and complacencycoming to an end. I’ve been feeling that a terrific amount of the anxiety associated with the fearof an impending atomic explosion and the dissolution of the universe is aprojection of anxiety coming from a world of people who have never found thecenter beyond coming and going. If you are at peace with eternity, the blowingup of the universe is perfectly acceptable—just as your own death has to beacceptable. It is going with organic processes. Everything that comes… goes. …the hero would be no hero if death held for him any terror; the first conditionis reconciliation with the grave.47 [part0105.html#footnote47] Chief Seattle, of the Indians that inhabited the Seattle area, wrote a wonderfulpaper that has to do with putting oneself in tune with the universe.

Guided by the practical judgment ofthe kings and the instruction of the priests of the dice of divine revelation,the field of conscious-ness so contracts that the grand lines of the humancomedy are lost in a welter of cross-purposes. Men’s perspectives become flat,comprehending only the light-reflecting, tangible surfaces of existence. Thevista into depth closes over. The significant form of the human agony is lost toview. Society lapses into mistake and disaster. The Little Ego has usurped thejudgment seat of the Self.48 [part0105.html#footnote48]Let us imagine ourselves for a moment in the lecture hall. …Above, we see manylights. Each bulb is separate from the others, and we may think of them,accordingly, as separate from each other.…just as each bulb seen aloft is a vehicle of light, so each of us below is avehicle of consciousness. But the important thing about a bulb is the quality ofits light. Likewise, the important thing about each of us is the quality of hiscon-sciousness.

Thereare a lot of meditation disciplines that open one to the experience of death,the acceptance of death. It is a motif that is absolutely universal ininitiations. There is always a death aspect and a birth after it. Death and begettingcome at the same time.Only birth can conquer death—the birth, not of the old thing again, but ofsomething new. Within the soul, within the body social, there must be—if we areto experience long survival—a continuous “recurrence of birth” (palingenesia) tonullify the unremitting recurrences of death.54 [part0105.html#footnote54] Forit is by means of our own victories, if we are not regenerated, that the work ofNemesis is wrought: doom breaks from the shell of our very virtue. Peace then isa snare; war is a snare; change is a snare; permanence a snare. When our day iscome for the victory of death, death closes in; there is nothing we can do,except be crucified and resurrected; dismembered totally, and then reborn.55[part0105.html#footnote55]Sometimes the death is, as it were, enacted. In primitive puberty rites, thereis often an enactment of dying or the young person thinks he’s about to bekilled and actually experiences a going into death. I know of a number ofexamples in contemporary life of people who have been in a blocked situation andthen have actually experienced death.One case I know was a woman caught in an automobile accident where two truckscollided with her in the middle, and she thought she was dead. When she came outof it, the whole life that she had been living just dropped off, and she had anentirely new life. So it is a valid psychological theme, this one of death outof which life comes.Among primitive hunting people, where the men continually kill animals, thiskilling of the animals is the principle sacrifice, and among those peopletypically we have no human sacrifices. But in early planting cultures, there isalmost a fury of sacrifice, sacrifices of all kinds, and it’s in those culturesthat we have human sacrifice. Only the best are sacrificed.Being sacrificed is a way to go home.“He who loses his life shall find it.“ Generally, the principle sacrifice is of a major food animal. For instance, inSoutheast Asia, it’s the pig; in Europe, principally, it’s the bull. Both ofthese animals are symbolic of the moon. The tusks of the pig are the crescentsof the moon, with the black face between; the horns of the bull, the same. Themoon is that which dies and is resurrected, dies and is resurrected. The bullrepresents, in a way, the death of the moon out of which a new life can come. Snake and moon both die to the old,shed their shadow to be reborn."},{"pageContent":"In Rome, suicide was a noble act. When one was about to be captured, which wouldmean living a disgraceful life, there was suicide, a practice that went on amongthe Celts too. There is a Hellenistic picture of a Celt killing himself and hiswife as they’re about to be captured.In Japan, the highest example of ceremonial suicide is hara-kiri, an interestingand subtle ritual act. A man who has conspicuously failed in the performance ofhis duty, which he places above his personal wish, commits hara-kiri, for it isthe only thing that can redeem him from the disgrace. The man who is to commithara-kiri kneels in the center of a tatami mat, the four corners of which aremarked off by objects—like Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John around Christ: themotif of the center and the four points. He inserts his sword, the symbol of hisnobility and honor, into the right side of his belly, and carries it across anddown. He must fall face for-ward. It is an extremely painful way to killyourself. You can’t just stab and go out. It is a deliberate act, and a matterof honor that you experience the whole thing. In the woman’s counter-part ofhara-kiri, she cuts her jugular vein—a different act, but the sense is the same.An Indian aristocrat, whose sword is his honor, can behead himself. You can’tpractice this one either. The way it’s done, according to the illustrations, isyou bend down a pliant sapling, attach a rope to it, put the rope around yourhead, bend over, take your sword, and cut off your head. The further the treepitches your head, the greater the merit you’ve gained by the act. You areimmediately translated to wherever the merit has brought you, and your friends‘round about know what has happened. This type of suicide has high dignity andbelongs to the ritual practice of the community."},{"pageContent":"I think the idea of life after death is a bad idea. It distracts you fromappreciating the uniqueness of the here and now, the moment you are living. Forexample, if you think that when you die your parents will be there and you’lllive with them forever, you may no longer appreciate the significant momentsthat you share with them on earth.Every moment is utterly unique and will not be continued in eternity. This factgives life its poignancy and should concentrate your attention on what you areexperiencing now. I think that’s washed out a bit by the notion that everyonewill be happy in heaven. You had better be happy here, now. You’d betterexperience the eternal here and now.. Being “happy with Him forever in heaven”means that while you are here on earth you should be happy: that is to say, yourlife should be identified with the divine power, the eternal power in all life.If you concretize the symbol of heaven, the whole situation disintegrates. Youthink, for example, that eternity is there, and your life is here. You believethat God, the source of energy, is there, and you are here, and He may come intoyour life or He may not. No, no—that source of eternal energy is here, in you,now.That is the essence of Gnosticism, Buddha consciousness, and so forth. St. Paulgot close to the idea when he said, “I live now, not I, but Christ in me.” Ionce made this observation in a lecture, and a priest in attendance said,“That’s blasphemy.”—an example of the church not conceding the very sense of thesymbol.On the other hand, since the function of the heaven image is to help you to die,to yield to where nature’s taking you rather than resist, I think you would tella Christian child who is going to die that he is going to go to heaven. The resistance to deathhas to do with not knowingwhere you’re going when you die. In one of the sūtras, the Buddha is asked how one person helps another facedeath. He responds: “Suppose a house caught fire, and in the house was a fatherwith three little children, and the children were afraid of the flames, but theywouldn’t go outside. The father says, ‘Now, look, outside we have a darlinglittle goat cart. The goats are all waiting for you, so let’s go out and get inthe cart.’” That is to say, you put something out past the flames for the personwho is not able to experience anything else. This approach is a convenient meansof bringing about a desirable and necessary act that the person would otherwisebe incapable of performing.When you support someone who is dying, you are helping that person to identifywith the consciousness that is going to disengage from the body. We disengagefrom various things all of our lives. Finally, we identify with consciousnessand disengage from our bodies. In Buddhism,the central thought iscompassion without attachment. And so, the death of one for whom you feel com-passion shouldn’t be anaffliction. Your attachment is the temporal aspect of the relationship; yourcompassion is the eternal aspect. Hence, you can reconcile yourself to feelingsof loss by identifying with that which is not lost when all is lost: namely, theconsciousness that informs the body and all things. This yielding back intoundifferentiated consciousness is the return, and that is as far as you canthink, as much as you can know. The rest is transcendent of all consciousknowledge.[Discuss] [http://www.jcf.org/new/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4724&CompMyth]"},{"pageContent":"COMING INTO AWARENESS"},{"pageContent":"THE first aphorism of Patanjali’s classic handbook of yoga supplies the key tothe entire work:“Yoga consists in the intentional stoppingof the spontaneous activity of the mind-stuff.”56 [part0105.html#footnote56]…Any person unused to meditation, desiring to fix in his mind a single image orthought, will find within seconds that he is already entertaining associatedthoughts. The untrained mind will not stand still, and yoga is the intentionalstopping of its movement.It may be asked, why should anyone wish to bring about such a state?The mind is likened, in reply, to the surface of a pond rippled by a wind.…Theidea of yoga is to cause that wind to subside and let the waters return to rest.For when a wind blows and waters stir, the waves break and distort both thelight and its reflections, so that all that can be seen are colliding brokenforms. Not until the waters will have been stilled, cleansed of stirred-upsediment and made mirror-bright, will the one reflected image appear that on therippling waves had been broken; that of the clouds and pure sky above, the treesalong the shore, and down deep in the still, pure water itself, the sandy bottomand the fish. Then alone will that single image be known of which the wave-bornereflections are but fragments and distortions. And this single image can belikened to that of the Self realized in yoga. It is the Ultimate—the Form offorms—of which the phenomena of this world are but imperfectly seen, ephemeraldistortions: the God-form, the Buddha-form, which is truly our ownKnowledge-form, and with which it is the goal of yoga to unite us.57[part0105.html#footnote57] In kuṇḍalinī yoga, largely through the exercise of meditation and breathcontrol, called prāṇāyāma—breathing in through one nostril for a certain numberof counts, holding the breath, filling the body with the prana, the breath, thenbreathing out for a number of counts, holding briefly, breathing in through theother nostril, and so forth—one gradually stills the whole psyche, calms thewaters, as it were.There is a notion that breath and emotion are linked. When you are shocked, yourbreathing changes. When you are full of rage or passion of any kind, yourbreathing changes. When you are at rest, your breath-ing changes. So the goalhere is to make your breathing regular, to still and calm the mind. And at thesame time there is a meditation that activates the kuṇḍalinī serpent and startsher up the spine.[Kuṇḍalinī]…the figure of a coiled female serpent—a serpent goddess not of“gross” but of “subtle” substance—which is to be thought of as residing in atorpid, slumbering state in a subtle center, the first of the seven, near thebase of the spine: the aim of the yoga then being to rouse this serpent, lifther head, and bring her up a subtle nerve or channel of the spine to theso-called “thousand-petaled lotus” (sahasrara) at the crown of the head.…She,rising from the lowest to the highest lotus center, will pass through and wakethe five between, and with each waking the psychology and personality of thepractitioner will be altogether and fundamentally transformed.58[part0105.html#footnote58] The word cakra means “wheel.” Cakras are also called padmas, which means“lotuses.” There are seven: three associated with the pelvic area, three withthe head, and one in between—the heart cakra—in that great cavity of all thepulses: the pulsation of the heart and the pulsation of the breath.Cakra I, Mūlādhāra, the “Root Support,” is located at the base of the spine. Theworld view is of uninspired materialism, governed by ‘hard facts’…and thepsychology, adequately described in behavioristic terms, is reactive, notactive. There is on this plane no zeal for life, no explicit impulse to expand.There is simply a lethargic avidity in hanging on to existence; and it is thisgrim grip that must finally be broken so that the spirit may be quit of its dullzeal simply to be.…The first task of the yogi, then, must be to break at this level the cold dragongrip of his own spiritual lethargy and release the jewel-maid, his own shakti,for ascent to those higher spheres where she will become his spiritual teacherand guide to the bliss of an immortal life beyond sleep.59[part0105.html#footnote59]Cakra II, Svādhishṭhāna, “Her Special Abode,” is at the level of the genitals.When the kuṇḍalinī is active at this level, the whole aim of life is in sex. Notonly is every thought and act sexually motivated, either as a means towardsexual ends or as a compensating sublimation of frustrated sexual zeal, buteverything seen and heard is interpreted compulsively, both consciously andunconsciously, as symbolic of sexual themes. Psychic energy, that is to say, hasthe character here of the Freudian libido. Myths, deities, and religious ritesare understood and experienced in sexual terms.60 [part0105.html#footnote60]Cakra III, Maṇipūra, “City of the Shining Jewel,” is located at the level of thenavel. Here the energy turns to violence and its aim is to consume, to master,to turn the world into oneself and one’s own. The appropriate Occidentalpsychology would be the Adlerian of the “will to power”: for now even sexbecomes an occasion, not of erotic experience, but of achievement, conquest,self-reassurance, and frequently, also, revenge.61 [part0105.html#footnote61] The function of Cakra III is organizing your life, establishing a family,building a business, learning how to master the world in terms appropriate toyour condition and place. Self maintenance, family maintenance. societymaintenance, world maintenance—but maintenance in the sense of transformation:life is maintained, not in a petrified condition, but in a growth condition, asis a tree by the gardener that cultivates it.All three of these lower cakras are of the modes of man’s living in the world inhis naive state, outward turned: the modes of the lovers, the fighters, thebuilders, the accom-plishers. Joys and sorrows on these levels are functions ofachievements in the world “out there,” what people think of one, what has beengained, what lost.62 [part0105.html#footnote62] These three cakras are of functions that we share with the other animals. Theyare also clinging to life, begetting, building nests, making their way. Popularreligion works on these levels, and the individual living on these levels isego-oriented and his action must be controlled by social law.…a religion operating only on these levels, having little or nothing to do withthe fostering of inward, mystical realizations, would hardly merit the name ofreligion at all. It would be little more than an adjunct to police authority,offering in addition to ethical rules and advice intangible consolations forlife's losses and a promise of future rewards for social duties fulfilled.63[part0105.html#footnote63] Cakra IV, Anāhata, meaning “not hit,” is at the level of the heart. It is thebeginning of the religious life, the awakening where the new life begins, andits name refers to the sound that is not made by any two things strikingtogether. All the sounds that we hear are made by two things striking together.What would the sound be that is not made by two things striking together? It isthe sound of the energy of which universe is a mani-festation. It is, therefore,antecedent to things.The heart cakra, then, is the opening of the spirit-ual dimension: all ismetaphoric of the mystery. Once you have got that point of all being metaphoricof the mystery, then these lower powers become spiritualized. The very doing ofthe things of the first three cakras become the realizations of Cakras V, VI,and VII. When you reach the upper cakras,you don’t do without the first three:survival, sex, power. You don’t destroythe first three floors of a buildingwhen you get to the fourth. Cakra V, called Viśuddha, “Purified,” is at the level of the larynx. This is thecakra of spiritual effort to hold back the animal system from which the energiescome. One has gone through the lower cakras to get to here, but the pelviccakras have not been rejected. They now have to be turned to a spiritual, ratherthan a merely physical, aim. Cakra V is commonly referred to by Tibetan imagesof deities standing on prostrate forms, putting down the merely physical withweapons and ferocity: the ferocity with which you have to handle yourself. Cakra VI, Ājñā, the lotus of “Command,” located between the eyebrows, is what wewould call the cakra of heaven, the highest cakra in the world of incarnateforms. The forms of the pharaohs from Egypt show the Uraeus Serpent coming outof this point between the brows. When the kuṇḍalinī has reached this point, onebeholds God. Any god you have been meditating on or have been taught to revereis the god that will be seen here. This is the highest obstacle for the completeyogi. As Ramakrishna says, “One is tempted to stay there tasting the juice.” Itis so sweet, so blissful. On the brink of illumination,the old ways are very seductiveand liable to pull you back. The Sufis have a wonderful image connected with Cakra VI. This is the story toldby Hallaj: One night a moth sees a lamp, a burning flame enclosed in glass. Itspends the whole night bumping against the glass, trying to become one with theflame. In the morning it returns to its friends in the morning and tells them ofthe beautiful thing it has seen. They say, “You don't look the better for it.”This is the condition of the yogi trying to break through. So it goes back thenext night and, somehow or other, gets through. For an eternal instant itachieves its goal: it becomes the flame—tat tvam asi—”thou art that.” And so,here is the subject and here is the object—the Soul and God—between is a pane ofglass. Remove the pane and there is neither subject nor object, because to havean object you have to have a subject.The final barrier to enlightenment is the barrier that prevents you frombecoming God. The pane of glass is a way of speaking about the dividing factor.Removing the glass suggests the annihilation of the veil of ignorance that keepsyou from knowing God. Beholding God—God with characteristics—is the final whispof ignorance. At this level you have to have a symbol, an experience because youare still holding the last whisp of you. I am beholding God. That’s the finalbarrier.It is so sweet that one is reluctant to yield, but the ultimate yielding is theyielding of your own being. If you’re going to hang onto your soul, you can’tbecome one with God. You can’t even become one with your spouse. This is whathas to be given up. I hear OM. I know God is ubiquitous. Divine energy is allaround me. It is here. It is here. It is here.When you come to fulfillment, you have come to that high point. The god’s namedoesn’t matter, they are all included. The different gods are personificationsof aspects of the total functioning. The ultimate thing is going past gods.Meister Eckhart said, “The ultimate leave-taking is the leaving of God forGod.”64 [part0105.html#footnote64] That means leaving the folk idea of God—theecclesiastical idea of God, what you’ve been taught of God—for that transcendentreference of which God is the metaphor. Where are you between two thoughts?Where is God between two Gods?It’s a simple idea,yet we are so used to being taught something else that thewords tend to block us instead of letting us through. Leaving God for God is,for me, a very vivid statement. Indian philosophy has no problem with thisconcept. When the kuṇḍalinī reaches Cakra VI, you see God: “brahman withcharacteristics.” At Cakra VII, you go past God and are in the transcendent:“brahman without characteristics.” Cakra VII, Sahasrāra, “Thousand Petalled,” is the lotus at the crown of thehead. At this cakra there is no person to be conscious of God. There is onlyundifferentiated consciousness: the silence. When you hit Cakra VII, you areinert. It is a catatonic knockout, you might say, and you are reduced simply toa thing."},{"pageContent":"Now as I see it, if you come back down to the heart, to Cakra IV, wherespiritual life begins, subject and object are together. Cakra I corresponds toVII. The inertia from Cakra I sets in when you have hit Cakra VII. Cakra IIcorresponds to VI. Cakra III corresponds to V. You are then able to take the warenergy from Cakra III and practice self control in Cakra V. So you can bendthings at Cakra IV.For example, through the experiences of Cakra II, if they are of love, you arereally experiencing the grace of God in Cakra VI. You transmute the lust energyof Cakra II into love. If there has been no experience of the discipline ofCakra V, you’ll never get an inkling of what it is you are to be experiencingthrough the physical. If in your physical love, you can realize that what youare touching is the grace of the divine in its proper form for you, this is atranslation of the carnal adventure into the spiritual, without the loss of thecarnal. The two are together. You are then beholding the god as in Cakra VI andexperiencing the beloved as a manifestation of that divine power, that lovewhich informs the world.In the courtly love tradition, the woman had to test the man by holding him offuntil she was sure that it was not lust that was approaching her, but love, thegentle heart. That is the whole sense of courtly love. The same theme is laterrepresented in Dante’s Divine Comedy, where his love for Beatrice brings him tothe throne of God. In his wonderful book of poems called La Vita Nuova, “The NewLife,” Dante describes how he looks at her, not with the eye of Cakra II, butwith that of Cakra VI, as a manifestation of God’s love, and that carries himthrough the whole thing."},{"pageContent":"My wonderful friend, Heinrich Zimmer, my final guru, often said, “The bestthings cannot be told.” That is to say, you can’t talk about that which liesbeyond the reach of words.The second best are misunderstood, because they are your statements about thatwhich cannot be told. They are misunderstood because the vocabulary of symbolsthat you have to use are thought to be references to historical events.The third best is conversation, political life, economics, and all that. Andthat’s what we are usually dealing with: the first three cakras.Zimmer loved to recount an amusing animal-fable from India. It tells of atigress, pregnant and starving, who comes upon a little flock of goats andpounces on them with such energy that she brings about the birth of her littleone and her own death.The goats scatter, and when they come back to their grazing place, they findthis just-born tiger and its dead mother. Having strong parental instincts, theyadopt the tiger, and it grows up thinking it’s a goat. It learns to bleat. Itlearns to eat grass. And since grass doesn’t nourish it very well, it grows upto become a pretty miserable specimen of its species.When the young tiger reaches adolescence, a large male tiger pounces on theflock, and the goats scatter. But this little fellow is a tiger, so he standsthere. The big one looks at him in amazement and says, “Are you living here withthese goats?” “Maaaaaa,” says the little tiger. Well, the old tiger ismortified, something like a father who comes home and finds his son with longhair. He swats him back and forth a couple of times, and the little thing justresponds with these silly bleats and begins nibbling grass in embarrassment. Sothe big tiger brings him to a still pond.Now, still water is a favorite Indian image to symbolize the idea of yoga. Thefirst aphorism of yoga is: “Yoga is the intentional stopping of the spontaneousactivity of the mind-stuff.” Our minds, which are in continual flux, are likenedto the surface of a pond that’s blown by a wind. So the forms that we see, thoseof our own lives and the world around us, are simply flashing images that comeand go in the field of time, but beneath all of them is the substantial form offorms. Bring the pond to a standstill, have the wind withdraw and the watersclear, and you’ll see, in stasis, the perfect image beneath all of thesechanging forms.So this little fellow looks into the pond and sees his own face for the firsttime. The big tiger puts his face over and says, “You see, you’ve got a facelike mine. You’re not a goat. You’re a tiger like me. Be like me.”Now that’s guru stuff: I’ll give you my picture to wear, be like me. It’s theopposite to the individual way.So the little one is getting that message; he’s picked up and taken to thetiger’s den, where there are the remains of a recently slaughtered gazelle.Taking a chunk of this bloody stuff, the big tiger says, “Open your face.” Thelittle one backs away, “I’m a vegetarian.” “None of that nonsense,” says the bigfellow, and he shoves a piece of meat down the little one’s throat. He gags onit. The text says, “As all do on true doctrine.”But gagging on the true doctrine, he’s nevertheless getting it into his blood,into his nerves; it’s his proper food. It touches his proper nature.Spontaneously, he gives a tiger stretch, the first one. A little tiger roarcomes out—Tiger Roar 101. The big one says, “There. Now you’ve got it. Now we gointo the forest and eat tiger food.” Vegetarianismis the first turning away from life,because life lives on lives.Vegetarians are just eatingsomething that can’t run away. Now, of course, the moral is that we are all tigers living here as goats. Theright hand path, the sociological department, is interested in cultivating ourgoat-nature. Mythology, properly understood as metaphor, will guide you to therecognition of your tiger face. But then how are you going to live with thesegoats?Well, Jesus had something to say about this problem. In Matthew 7 he said, “Donot cast your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feetand turn and tear you.” The functionof the orthodox communityis to torture the mystic to death:his goal. You wear the outer garment of the law, behave as everyone else and wear theinner garment of the mystic way. Jesus also said that when you pray, you shouldgo into your own room and close the door. When you go out, brush your hair.Don’t let them know. Otherwise, you’ll be a kook, something phony.So that has to do with not letting people know where you are. But then comes thesecond problem: how do you live with these people? Do you know the answer? Youknow that they are all tigers. And you live with that aspect of their nature,and perhaps in your art you can let them know that they are tigers.And that’s the revelation then. And so this brings us to the final formula ofthe Bodhisattava way, the way of the one who is grounded in eternity and movingin the field of time. The field of time is the field of sorrow. “All life issorrowful.” And it is. If you try to correct the sorrows, all you do is shiftthem somewhere else. Life is sorrowful. How do you live with that? You realizethe eternal within yourself. You disengage, and yet, reengage. You—and here’sthe beautiful formula—“participate with joy in the sorrows of the world.” Youplay the game. It hurts, but you know that you have found the place that istranscendent of injury and fulfillments. You are there, and that’s it."},{"pageContent":"I haven’t kept up with psychology since the death of Jung, but I’d say that Jungwas such a person: one grounded in eternity and moving in the field of time.Jean and I had tea for an hour-and-a-half with Dr. and Mrs. Jung at Bollingen,his place at Lake Zurich. It was a lovely occasion. Since he was editing some ofthe German posthuma of Zimmer and I had done my work on the English, we had notrouble saying hello and enjoying things together without any anxiety ofunderstanding. When we were about to leave Jung said, “So, you’re going toIndia. Well, let me tell you the meaning of OM.“When I was in Africa a group of us went for a little hike. Presently, we knewwe were lost. Then we looked around and saw all these boys with things in theirnoses, standing on one leg, supporting themselves with spears. Nobody knew howto talk to anybody else. We had no knowledge of their language. It was a tensemoment. We all just sat down and kept looking at each other. When everybody feltthat everything was okay—”it’s okay, these are good people, they’re perfectlyokay”—what do I hear? ‘OM…OM…OM…’“Then, the next year I was in India with a group of scientists, and if there’sone variety of the human species that is not susceptible to awe, this is it. Wewent up to Darjeeling, to Tiger Hill, which is a wonderful experience. You areawakened early in the morning about a half hour before sunrise and driven in thechilly morning air to a lofty ridge. And it’s dark. When the sun rises, you seebefore you millions of square miles of Himalayan peaks breaking into rainbowcolors. What did I hear from the scientists? ’OM…OM…OM…’ OM is the sound naturemakes when it’s pleased with itself.”That’s an example of the kind of playful conversa-tion that we had. He was abeautiful man, and Jean said that he had beautiful eyes.Jung found out in 1909 that myth and dream were linked, but it has been wellknown in India forever. It is implicit in the syllable OM, or A-U-M. According to the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad, the world of the state of wakingconsciousness is to be identified with the letter A of the syllable AUM; that ofdream consciousness (heaven and hell, that is to say) with the letter U; anddeep sleep (the state of the mystical union of the knower and the known, God andhis world, brooding the seeds and energies of creation: which is the statesymbolized in the center of the mandala) with M.65 [part0105.html#footnote65]The soul is to be propelled both by and from this syllable AUM into the silencebeyond and all around it: the silence out of which it rises and back into whichit goes when pronounced—slowly and rhythmically …as AUM—AUM—AUM.66[part0105.html#footnote66] If you want to hear AUM, just cover your ears and you’ll hear it. Of course,what you are hearing is the blood in the capillaries, but it’s AUM: Ah—wakingconsciousness; ou—dream consciousness; and then, mmm—the realm of deep,dreamless sleep. AUM is the sound of the radiance of God. This is the mostmysterious and important thing to understand, but once you get the idea, it’svery simple. “The dream is a little hidden door in the innermost secret recesses of the soul,opening into that cosmic night which was psyche long before there was anyego-consciousness, and which will remain psyche no matter how far ourego-consciousness may extend. For all ego-consciousness is isolated: because itseparates and discriminates, it knows only particulars, and it sees only whatcan be related to the ego. Its essence is limitation, even though it reach tothe farthest nebulae among the stars. All consciousness separates; but in dreamswe put on the likeness of that more universal, truer, more eternal man dwellingin the darkness of primordial night. There he is still the whole, and the wholeis in him, indistinguishable from nature and bare of all egohood.“It is from these all-uniting depths that the dream arises, be it never sochildish, grotesque, or immoral. So flowerlike is it in its candor and veracitythat it makes us blush for the deceitfulness of our lives.”—Jung67[part0105.html#footnote67] The secret of dreams is that subject and object are the same. The object isself-luminous, fluent in form, multivalent in its meanings. It’s your dream, themanifestation of your will, and yet you are surprised by it. This is therelationship of ego-consciousness to the unconscious. Ego-consciousness has tolearn about the unconscious, and dreams are the vocabulary of the unconsciousspeaking to the conscious mind. Yet, in dreams and in visions, subject andobject are the same.Dream, vision, God—God is a luminous vision. The image of God is equivalent tothe dream vision.So your God is an aspect of yourself, just as your dream image is. That’s whatis meant by the Hindu saying, nādevo devam arcayet, “by none but a god shall agod be worshiped.” Your god is a manifestation of your own level ofconsciousness. All of the heavens and all of the hells are within you. Thisunderstanding is just taken for granted in India, so we are in the realm ofmyth. Write down your dreams.They are your myths. Now, this consciousness is unconscious, but the body is conscious; there isconsciousness still there. The heart is beating, the blood is running throughthe body. If you are cold you will pull the blanket up over you; if you are hotyou will push the blanket down. I recall a cartoon in a magazine of a husbandand wife in bed. He has all the covers over him, and he’s dreaming aboutwatching a hula dancer on a South Sea isle. She’s freezing and thinks of herselfin an Eskimo igloo. The body is conscious.The point is that consciousness itself is below this level of darkness, beyonddream consciousness. In one of the Upaniṣads there is a saying: “We go into thatbrahman world every night, but, alas, we are asleep.” The goal of yoga is to gointo that realm awake. If you do, you will have arrived at pure, unmitigated,undifferentiated consciousness. Not consciousness of any thing, because you arenot on levels A or U, but consciousness per se. Since all of our words relateeither to things or to a relationship of things—whether things of waking orvisions of dream—there are no words for this experience. All that can be saidabout it is silence.Silence is the proper vocabulary of this realization. The Buddha is calledShakyamuni. The word muni means “the silent one,” and Shakya is his family name,so he is the silent one of the Shakya clan. This is why Zimmer said that thebest things can’t be told—there are no words for this realization. And when youutter words in order to refer the mind to it, the danger is that the words willtrap you and you won’t go through. So, for anyone lecturing, there’s a not verycomfortable saying: “He who speaks, does not know. He who knows, does notspeak.” That’s the final word.The point is that this AUM heard in silence informs all things. All things aremanifestations of it. Now you are inward turned. The secret to having aspiritual life as you move in the world is to hear the AUM in all things all thetime. If you do, everything is transformed. You no longer have to go anywhere tofind your fulfillment and achievement and the treasure that you seek. It ishere. It is everywhere. Clearly the occurrence of such visions over the whole in-habited earth requiresno explanation in terms either of racial or of cultural diffusion. The problemis, rather, psychological: of that depth of the unconscious where, to quote thewords of C. G. Jung, “man is no longer a distinct indivi-dual, but his mindwidens out and merges into the mind of mankind—not the conscious mind, but theunconscious mind of mankind, where we are all the same.”68[part0105.html#footnote68]"},{"pageContent":"part0105.html#footnote68NOW in every human being there is a built-in human instinct system, withoutwhich we should not even come to birth. But each of us has also been educated toa specific local culture system.…We are taught to respond to certain signalspositively, to others negatively or with fear; and most of these signals taughtare not of the natural, but of some local social order. They are sociallyspecific. Yet the impulses that they activate and control are of nature,biology, and instinct.69 [part0105.html#footnote69] In a mature life you’re hanging onto life, your erotic relationships are in playand established, and you have found a way to maintain yourself. I will give youan example of how these various energies work against each other. There’s onemale fish that is normally colored in such a way that the upper part of its bodyis dark and the lower part is light. That’s the usual coloring of fish, becausewhen you are below looking up into the light, the fish is relatively invisible,and when you are above looking down into the dark, it’s also camouflaged. Butwhen this particular fish is in love, his color shifts so that he’ll be visible.This puts him in danger, you see, and it seems to me symbolic of this lovething. You give up self-protection when this other comes along and you areseized with erotic compulsion.It’s a very amusing exchange. When the female fish goes by, a dance takes place.There is something about his coloration that makes her give a little move, andthen that move triggers his response. If any one of the little moves is missed,the dance ends and that choreography is finished. But if they can go through thewhole choreography, then something happens.There was a beautiful movie of three whales: two bulls and a cow. A little jobof nature was going to be done for the cow. She was ready. It was one of themost impressive and moving things to see the cooperation of these three animals.They were swimming, the three of them plowing along, and when she was ready toreceive one of them, she slowed down. The one on the right was supporting herand, my god, like a rainbow this penis comes curving over the body of thisenormous animals. It was very moving and awesome.When animals get involved with something that comes pushing from inside likethat, there are elaborate ritual relationships. One can say that ritual getsgoing when the species principle begins operating in individuals. It is acommitment of the individual to whatever might be the intention of nature or thesociety given the circumstances. But how is it that the second bull, who is notinvolved in the act itself, can participate in this? This to me is something wayout. There was absolutely no sense of competition. This was cooperation. I’veheard that now that boats are taking out tourists to look at the whales, thewhales are moving out beyond Catalina Island. The crowds can ruin anything.I was watching a flock of birds the other day. The rhythm of their flight issomething to see. They all seem to know just when they are going to turn, wherethey are going, and what’s up now. How does this happen? That’s participating ina transpersonal rhythm of some kind.I recall once having seen one of those beautiful Disney nature films, of a seaturtle laying her eggs in the sand, some thirty feet or so from the water. Anumber of days later, out of the sand there came a little multitude of tinyjust-born turtles, each about as big as a nickel; and without an instant’shesitation they all started for the sea. No hunting around. No trial-and-error.No asking, “Now what would be a reasonable place for me to head for first?” Nota single one of those little things went the wrong way, fumbling first into thebushes, and there saying, “Oh!” and turning around, thinking, “I’m made forsomething better than this!” No, indeed! They went directly as their mother musthave known they all would go: mother turtle, or Mother Nature. A flock ofseagulls, meanwhile, having screamed the news to each other, came zooming likedive bombers down on those little nickels that were making for the water. Theturtles knew perfectly well that that was where they had to get, and they weregoing as fast as their very little legs could push them: the legs, by the way,already knowing just how to push. No training or experimenting has beennecessary. The legs knew what to do, and the little eyes knew that what theywere seeing out in front of them was where they were going. The whole system wasin perfect operation, with the whole fleet of tiny tanks heading clumsily, yetas fast as they could, for the sea: and then…Well now, one surely would havethought that for such little things those great big waves might have seemedthreatening. But no! They went right on into the water and already knew how toswim. And as soon as they were there, of course, the fish began coming at them.Life is tough!70 [part0105.html#footnote70]"},{"pageContent":"The Bushmen in South Africa have very pitiful little bows that don’t have ashooting distance beyond twenty yards or so, but they also have a deadly poisonthat they put on the points of these little arrows. The Bushmen’s counterpart tothe American Indian’s buffalo would be the eland: a big, beautiful type ofgazelle. A Bushman has to hypnotize an eland to get close enough to send hisarrow. The eland will live for another day in great pain while the poison killsit, and the hunter has to identify himself with the animal and observe certaintaboos, and the way he behaves actually influences the death of the animal.The Hopi Snake Dance relates to this. It’s a strange and wonderful ritual, wherethe dancers hold snakes in their mouths and stroke them with feathers as theydance. I saw a film about the snake worshipping, or snake using, people in themountains of, I think it was, Georgia or Tennessee. These people have ceremoniesin which they toss a tangle of rattlesnakes back and forth. The participantsbelieve that if they are “in the Christ” they won’t be bitten. They getthemselves into a psychological state that the animals somehow recognize. But inthe film, the leader of this particular ceremony is bitten. He says he had afeeling that his consciousness “slipped,” as it were, so he won’t allow anybodyto cure him, and he dies.Living as I have in New York City, with no real relationship to animals—exceptwhen I was a kid out in the country—I never could understand such things. Soit’s amazing to me to hear stories of what can take place between a human beingand a wild animal, when these symbolic ideas of sacrifice and compassion areactually worked out in action. How can city peoplecall upon animal powersif they know nothing about animals? In Hawaii, I love to watch birds in palm trees. They don’t consciously know thatpalm leaves will go down when they light on them. But when some little birdlands on a leaf that goes down, the bird knows immediately how to catch itself.It’s fantastic. What kind of consciousness is that?I remember when I was a kid walking through the woods and came upon a barbedwire fence with a tree leaning up against it. The tree had incorporated thebarbed wire, had very neatly taken it into itself. You cannot tell me thereisn’t consciousness there. How far down the line does that go?In the nineteenth century, when systematic vivisection was beginning to bepracticed, the animals being used didn’t matter. Animals did not haveconsciousness. Their reactions were thought to be just stimulus responses of amechanistic organism. How far can you push that way of reading life? Can youbring it right up into human beings? Are we also just mechanistic organisms?That’s behavioristic psychology.The other extreme is what you get with the Hindu perspective of the ubiquity ofātman and brahman: all things are living things. Hindu meditations are intendedto put you in accord with Nature. When you are in accord,all the boons come. The ego that relates to the other as to a “Thou” is different from the egothat’s relating to an “It.” You can turn anything into a Thou, so the wholeworld is a Thou. That’s what the mystical experience is supposed to be. As soonas anything is an It, you have duality. I-Thou is not a duality. It is thenondual realization.Working with that realization, the whole world is then radiant of life and joy.Finding everything a Thou and realizing it’s life is the extreme statement ofthe implication of all of these religious meditations. That’s the perspectivethat the mechanistic scientists resist.When I lecture around, it’s funny the negative reaction I get from somescientists and Anglo-Saxon philosophers who object to my use of the word“consciousness” for what they would term “energy.” I have come more and more tothink that these two words are two ways of saying the same thing, two aspects ofa single thrust. There’s an implicit tendency in conscious-ness todifferentiation and movement, and it strikes me that perhaps the energy we seeis consciousness. In the biological sphere at least, energy seems to beassociated with consciousness, almost to the point of identity.I think there are three states of being. One is the innocent expression ofNature. Another is when you pause, analyze, think about it. When you do, Natureis not just living; and while you are analyzing, your nature isn’t pushing you.Then, having analyzed, there comes a state in which you’re able to live asNature again, but with more competence, more control, more flexibility."},{"pageContent":"I am more and more convinced that there is a plane of consciousness that we areall sharing, and that the brain is a limiting machine that pulls it in. It ispossible to sink back, lose this definition, and participate in that plane ofconsciousness. How else do you explain extrasensory perception? And since timeis a form of sensibility—meaning, that which is going to happen has alreadyhappened in a certain sense—you cannot say that premonitions are coincidences.They are not. They happen too often to be attributed to chance.I’ve had such experiences on enough occasions to attest to that: meetingsomebody, having a kind of “click,” and knowing that you are going to dosome-thing important together that will be a major feature in your lives. Imean, when you meet people who are going to be of deep significance in yourlife, knowing that it’s going to happen is somehow right there in the firstmeeting.

I havehad the feeling that I’ve missed it, that I should have talked to that personnext to me because that’s why they were sitting there. But then there are othertimes when you wonder how the hell a particular person ever got in on yourprogram.You can get distracted by the desire for psychic powers. Whether you havepsychic powers or not, you still face the problem of a life destiny and a lifetragedy. I feel that, with the academic life, I have gone on my life journey ina shallow shell. My confession would be that I’m a thinking-intuition type,short in both the feeling side and the sensation side. Okay, that’s the boat Ihave, and that’s the one I’m using. My sensations and feelings are there, but Icouldn’t guide myself by them. I’m certain of this from knowing and living withpeople who do live in their feelings. I see the richness and nuances of theirexperiences. Mine are very crude, but I’ll match any of them for thinking.Carl Jung, in his analysis of the structure of the psyche, has distinguishedfour psychological functions that link us to the outer world. These aresensation, thinking, feeling, and intuition. Sensation, he states, is thefunction that tells us that something exists; thinking, the function that tellsus what it is; feeling, the function that evaluates its worth to us; andintuition, the function that enables us to estimate the possibilities inherentin the object or its situation.71 [part0105.html#footnote71] Feeling, thus, isthe inward guide to value; but its judgments are related normally to outward,empirical circumstance.72 [part0105.html#footnote72]The wonderful thing about symbology is that it includes all four functions. Jungspeaks of a fifth, in the center, that he calls “the transcendent function.”That’s the one that symbols help you to attack. The symbol carries the thoughtto domains not of the head, but the head can lead it. I’ve been afraid that theother functions would interrupt the flow of this shell. It’s a damn good craftI’ve got, but it can’t do those other things.I haven’t meditated, and I know I have been afraid that meditation might open uplots of things that could delay the passage of this craft I’m rowing. It is anintentional limitation in order to go in a direction and get there. And I havegotten there, and I know it. Psychic experiences don’t necessarily yield thiskind of dimension. Each of us has individual capacities. The real trick isknowing the machinery of the boat in which you are crossing the channel.The only way you can talk about this great tide in which you’re a participant isas Schopenhauer did: the universe is a dream dreamed by a single dreamer whereall the dream characters dream too."},{"pageContent":"WHEN we talk about scientific truth—just as when we talk about God—we are introuble, because truth has different meanings.

That quote from Keats’s Ode on a GrecianUrn—“‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty’—that is all ye know on earth, and all yeneed to know.”—it is a nice poetic thought, but what does it mean? Speaking ofplatitudes, I like Robert Bly’s extrapolation of Descartes: “I think, thereforeI am. The stone doesn’t think, therefore it isn’t.” Ideals are dangerous.Don’t take them seriously.You can get by on a few. A human being in action cannot represent perfection. You always represent oneside of a duality that is itself perfection. The moment you take action, you areimperfect: you have decided to act that way instead of that other way. That’swhy people who think they are perfect are so ridiculous. They’re in a badposition with respect to themselves.It is a basic thought in India—it also turns up in China—that life itself is asin, in this sense of its being imperfect. To live, you’re killing and eatingsomething, aren’t you? You can reduce what you eat to fallen leaves if you want,but you’re still eating life. You are taking the common good, you might say, andfocusing it in your direction. And that is a decision on one side rather than onthe other. So, decide to be imperfect, reconcile yourself to that, and go ahead.That’s “joyful participation in the sorrows of the world.”The idea in India is that after many incarnations you achieve perfection anddon’t get reincarnated. You quit. You’re out. Hence, all Buddhas are depictedmore or less alike, because they all are perfect and don’t reincarnate. As longas you’re reincarnating, you are imperfect. So, you have to be loyal to yourimperfection: find out what it is, then continue on your track. By being loyalto your part of the duality, you are keeping the mystery of history informed. Do not give up your vices.Make your vices work for you. If you are a proud person,don’t get rid of your pride.Apply it to your spiritual quest."},{"pageContent":"The sublime in contrast to beauty? That which is beautiful does not threatenyou. Even the terror of tragedy is not as threatening as something that blowsyou to pieces. The sublime is rendered by prodigious power or by enormous space:when you reach a mountaintop, for instance, and the world breaks open:a motif that is used in Buddhist art a great deal., and the reason temples areput on the top of hills. In Kyōto, there are gardens where you are screened fromthe expanding view while climbing, and suddenly—bing!—the whole vista opensbefore you. That’s sublimity. So, power and space are two renditions ofsublimity, and in both cases, the ego is diminished.

Then, in preparing, serving, and drinking,every phase of the action is rendered in such a gracefully functional mannerthat all present may take joy in it, the common affair might well be said tohave been elevated to the status of a poem. And, in fact, in the writing of asonnet, words are used that are quite normal, secular, common day tools. Just asin poetry, so in tea: certain rules and manners have been developed as aconsequence of ages of experience; and through a mastery of these, immenselyheightened powers of expression are achieved.

The gods represented excellencies in various categories. The golden meanwas the middle way, “nothing in excess.” I think excellence in living is a finepurpose. The Greeks were humanists. The Platonic mandate was “Know Thyself.” Thephilosophical papers of that period have to do with conduct and virtue: virtuein the sense of excellence, not in the sense of good-versus-evil.This is a point that Nietzsche brings out in Beyond Good and Evil. Hedistinguishes between what he calls “slave morality”—obeying a rule, doing whatyou’re told, being good and not bad—and “master morality,” which is equivalentto the Greek idea of virtue, and the Renaissance idea of virtu, and has to dowith the kind of excellence achieved by one who is competent in some-thing. Ican remember somebody saying, “He’s a good man.” And somebody else asking, “Goodfor what?” That’s a very important shift in accent. There is somethingexhilarating about the idea of sheer excellence and aggressive performance: “Iget in there and do it!” in contrast to “Everything’s okay, and I submit.”So, following Nietzsche, the lion of virtue is the one that tears a lamb topieces, and the bad lion is the one that won’t. But from the lamb’s point ofview, the bad lion is the one that eats him. And so, what you find in slavemorality is that the people of excellence—the masterly ones—are regarded as bad.It really is so.With the idea of the masterly ones, we get the idea of elitism. “Elitism?Elitism is bad.” Have you ever heard that said? It’s slave morality speaking. Irecall lecturing at the University of Oklahoma to a select group of outstandingstudents from colleges all over the country. I’d never before had such anassemblage of excellent students. One of the professors later told me that onestudent came to him and said, “Having only excellent students in this group iselitism.” The professor replied, “This program is for people who are up to thescholarship.” “No,” the student argued, “it’s elitism and shouldn’t be on thiscampus.” So the professor said, “I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Bill. I’m going torecommend to the football coach that you play defensive halfback. What do youthink?” He got the idea. The only place where excellence is appreciated is onthe athletic field.Around the eighteenth century, linguists discovered that almost all of thelanguages from India to Ireland, across that whole range, were of theIndo-European language family. At the time, they did not know how ancientcivilization is—the Mesopotamian region and Egyptian civilization had not yetbeen explored—but it was evident that the Greek, Roman, and Europeancivilizations were all out of the impulse of the Indo-European peoples. And so,a Frenchman came up with the idea of a master race. The idea of Aryan supremacythat Hitler later picked up had to do with this idea of a master race. It hadnothing to do with master morality or slave morality. But Hitler usedNietszche’s words, which is very unfortunate, because Nietzsche absolutelydespised anti-Semitism and the idea of the state. In fact, he said, “The newidol is the state.” And that’s what Hitler represented. A horrible little man.His ideas were not Nietzsche’s."},{"pageContent":"PSYCHOLOGY is a means of interpretation, a way of interpreting what’s going on.Are you going to interpret it as the work of a concrete deity up there who hasbrought it about? Is that concrete deity a fact? How did it get there? Thatdiety has to be interpreted psychologically, so that you know that what we’retalking about is not “out there,” but “in here.” It was for me a startling experience, as it must have been for many otherswatching at that time the television broadcast of the Apollo space-flightimmediately before that of Armstrong’s landing on the moon, when Ground Controlin Houston asked, “Who’s navigating now?” and the answer that came back was,“Newton!”I was reminded of Immanuel Kant’s discussion of space in his Prolegomena to AnyFuture Metaphysic, where he asks: “How is it that in this space, here, we canmake judgments that we know with apodictic certainty will be valid in thatspace, there?”75 [part0105.html#footnote75]Kant’s reply to the question was that the laws of space are known to the mindbecause they are of the mind. They are of a knowledge that is within us frombirth, a knowledge a priori, which is only brought to recollection by apparentlyexternal circumstance.…In other words, it then occurred to me that outer space is within us inasmuch asthe laws of space are within us; outer and inner space are the same. We know,furthermore, that we have actually been born from space, since it was out ofprimordial space that the galaxy took form, of which our life-giving sun is amember. And this earth, of whose material we are made, is a flying satellite ofthat sun. We are, in fact, productions of this earth. We are, as it were, itsorgans. Our eyes are the eyes of this earth; our knowledge is the earth’sknowledge. And the earth, as we now know, is a production of space.…And so now we must ask: What does all this do to mythology? Obviously, somecorrections have to be made.For example: It is believed that Jesus, having risen from the dead, ascendedphysically to heaven (Luke 24:51), to be followed shortly by his mother in hersleep (Early Christian belief, confirmed as Roman Catholic dogma on November 1,1950). It is also written that some nine centuries earlier, Elijah, riding achariot of fire, had been carried to heaven in a whirlwind (2 Kings 2:11).Now, even ascending at the speed of light, which for a physical body isimpossible, those three celestial voyagers would not yet be out of the galaxy.Dante in the year A.D. 1300 spent the Easter weekend in a visit to hell,purgatory, and heaven; but that voyage was in spirit alone, his body remainingon earth. Whereas Jesus, Mary, and Elijah are declared to have ascendedphysically. What is to be made today of such mythological (hence, metaphorical)folk ideas?Obviously, if anything of value is to be made of them at all (and I submit thatthe elementary original idea must have been something of this kind), where thosebodies went was not into outer space, but into inner space. That is to say, whatis connoted by such metaphorical voyages is the possibil-ity of a return of themind in spirit, while still incarnate, to full knowledge of that transcendentsource out of which the mystery of a given life arises into this field of timeand back into which it in time dissolves. It is an old, old story in mythology:of the Alpha and Omega that is the ground of all being, to be realized as thebeginning and end of this life.76 [part0105.html#footnote76] The limits of psychology are the same as the limits of theology. They have todo with the problem of symbolization, not with the transcendence, and they gothe same distance. When you simply translate God into a psychological functionor factor, you have gone as far as God and no further. As long as you have aGod, you’re stuck. Recall Meister Eckhart: “The ultimate leave-taking is theleaving of God for God.”It’s a shame we have only one word for the two concepts. In India, there areseveral—jīva, ātman, brahman—and they are all different. “God,” our one word, isa really inadequate word. It always implies a personification, and unless onesays “Goddess,” it implies a male personification. Our limited vocabulary iswhat binds us, what ties us up."},{"pageContent":"In relation to the first books and chapters of the Bible, it used to be thecustom of both Jews and Christians to take the narratives literally, as thoughthey were dependable accounts of the origin of the universe and of actualprehistoric events. It was supposed and taught that there had been, quiteconcretely, a creation of the world in seven days by a god known only to theJews; that somewhere on this broad new earth there had been a Garden of Edencontaining a serpent that could talk; that the first woman, Eve, was formed fromthe first man’s rib, and that the wicked serpent told her of the marvelousproperties of the fruits of a certain tree of which God had forbidden the coupleto eat; and that, as a consequence of their having eaten of that fruit, therefollowed a “Fall” of all mankind, death came into the world, and the couple wasdriven forth from the garden. For there was in the center of that garden asecond tree, the fruit of which would have given them eternal life; and theircreator, fearing lest they should now take and eat of that too, and so become asknowing and immortal as himself, cursed them, and having driven them out, placedat his garden gate “cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way to guardthe way to the tree of life.”77 [part0105.html#footnote77] Those cherubim are an important symbol. The Garden of innocence and spontaneouslife, of unity before the knowledge of pairs of opposites, exits into the worldof time and historical duality, symbolized by the cherubim at the gate with theflaming sword between: you can’t go through. How are we to interpret thosecherubim and the Garden?Well, you go to Japan to see the Great Buddha at Nara. He is seated in thegarden at the foot of the Tree of Immortal Life. As you approach the temple, youcome to a preliminary building where two terrific figures stand as doorguardians. They are the cherubim. One of them has his mouth open, the other’smouth is closed: a pair of opposites. One represents the fear of death, and theother the desire for life—the temptations that didn’t touch the Buddha.No earthly paradise has been found.…for it is the garden of man’s soul. Aspictured in the Bible tale with its four mysterious rivers flowing in the fourdirections from a common source at the center, it is exactly what C. G. Jung hascalled an “archetypal image”: a psychological symbol, spontaneously produced,which appears universally, both in dreams and in myths and rites.…Like the imageof a deity, the quadrated garden with the life source at its center is a figmentof the psyche, not a product of gross elements, and the one who seeks withoutfor it, gets lost.78 [part0105.html#footnote78] So what is keeping you out of the Garden? Your fear and desire: that which theBuddha transcended. And when the Buddha did not respond to temptations of fearand desire, he passed through the gate to the tree, where he now sits with hishand pointing to the earth. That’s redemption. The Buddha and the Christ areequivalent. Jesus has gone through and become, himself, the fruit of the tree. When threatenedby fear and desire,let ego go. So the idea of redemption in both Christianity and Buddhism has to do with one’shaving come through. Whether one does or not, in either tradition, is some-thingelse. You can walk between those figures at Nara and enter the temple, bringingfear and desire with you, and you’ve not really gone through. You may thinkyou’ve achieved illumination, but you’re still in exile.The Buddhist interpretation of this whole thing is one of psychologicaltransformation. The Christian interpretation is one of debt and payment. Paulwas preaching to a group of merchants, who understoodthe whole mystery in terms of economics: there is a debt, and you get anequivalent payment. The debt is enormous, so the payment has to be enormous Thisis all bankers’ thinking. Christianity is caught up in that.I see Buddhism and Christianity as two vocabularies for speaking about the samething. In Buddhism we are lost in the world of fear and desire, the field ofmāyā, illusion. This is, in Christian iconography, the Fall. Redemption islosing those fears and having the experience of eternal life. You experiencethat through the act of Jesus in affirming the world, in participating in theworld with joy.The Buddha is saying, “Don’t be afraid of those gate guardians. Come in and eatthe fruit of the tree.” The act of communion is eating the fruit of the secondtree in the Garden. The fruit is symbolic of the spiritual nourishment thatcomes when you have reached the knowledge of your eternal life. There arevarious ways of interpreting these mysteries. I am not telling you something Iinvented.“Since in the world of time every man lives but one life, it is in himself thathe must search for the secret of the Garden.”—Loren Eisely79[part0105.html#footnote79]…in the Levant, the accent is on obedience, the obedience of man to the will ofGod, whimsical though it might be; the leading idea being that the god hasrendered a revelation, which is registered in a book that men are to read and torevere, never to presume to criticize, but to accept and to obey. Those who donot know, or who would reject, this holy book are in exile from their maker. 80[part0105.html#footnote80]So, then, what is it that our religions actually teach? Not the way to anexperience of identity with the Godhead, since that, as we have said, is theprime heresy; but the way and the means to establish and maintain a relationshipto a named God. And how is such a relationship to be achieved? Only throughmembership in a certain supernaturally endowed, uniquely favored social group.81[part0105.html#footnote81]A religion of relationshipsis a religion of exile.The Old Testament God has a covenant with a certain historic people, the onlyholy race—the only holy thing, in fact—on earth. And how does one gainmembership? The traditional answer was most recently (March 10, 1970) reaffirmedin Israel as defining the first prerequisite to full citizenship in thatmythologically inspired nation: by being born of a Jewish mother.82[part0105.html#footnote82]Our actual ultimate rootis in our humanity,not in our personal genealogy.83 [part0105.html#footnote83] And in the Christian view, by what means? By virtue of the incarnation ofChrist Jesus, who is to be known as true God and true man (which, in theChristian view, is a miracle, whereas in the Orient, on the other hand, everyoneis to be known as true God and true man, though few may have yet awakened to theforce of that wonder in themselves).84 [part0105.html#footnote84]We are all Christsand don’t realize it.Among tribesmen depending on the hunting skills of individuals for theirexistence, the individual is fostered: even the concept of immortality isindividual, not collective.

For years people have used religious affiliations to dothis. Martin Buber speaks of “I-Thou” and “I-It” relationships. An ego talkingto a Thou is different from an ego talking to an It. Wherever we emphasizeotherness or outgroups, we are making persons into Its: the gentile, the Jew,the enemy—they all become the same.Totem, tribal, racial, and aggressively missionizing cults represent onlypartial solutions of the psychological problem of subduing hate by love: theyonly partially initiate. Ego is not annihilated in them; rather, it is enlarged;instead of thinking only of himself, the individual becomes dedicated to thewhole of his society. The rest of the world meanwhile (that is to say, by farthe greater portion of mankind) is left outside the sphere of his sympathy andprotection because outside the sphere of the protection of his god. And theretakes place, then, that dramatic divorce of the two principles of love and hatewhich the pages of history so bountifully illustrate. Instead of clearing hisown heart the zealot tries to clear the world.86 [part0105.html#footnote86]If you fixon yourself and your tradition,believing you alone have got “It,”you’ve removed yourselffrom the rest of mankind."},{"pageContent":"Some say Communism is a social system without a religion; but you can’t say thatCommunism is not religious, for the laws of a Communist society have all thequalities of a religion because Communism has become the religion.In terms of the ritual side of it, Communism has all the character of areligion, and it has the characteristics of one that is a biblical descendent.There is a good and there is a bad, and we’re fighting for the good, and therewill be a day, come the Revolution, when all will be Communist and right.

This credo gives warriors enormous courage andpower: whether they’re going to get killed or not get killed, they move in withsubmission to the fate. In fact, that’s what a warrior has to do anyhow. The warrior’s approachis to say “yes” to life:“yea” to it all. In terms of historical action, Christianity and Islam have the same character.They’re going to remake the world for their God.

When Satan had been flung out of heaven for his pride and disobedience, hewas supposed to have fallen like a flaming comet and, when he struck the earth,to have plowed right through to its center. The prodigious crater that he openedthereupon became the fiery pit of Hell; and the great mass of displaced earthpushed forth at the opposite pole became the Mountain of Purgatory, which isrepresented by Dante as lifting heavenward exactly at the South Pole.87[part0105.html#footnote87]Dante saw even the fires of hellas a manifestation of God’s love.You will have heard the old legend of how, when God created the angels, hecommanded them to pay worship to no one but himself; but then, creating man, hecommanded them to bow in reverence to this most noble of his works, and Luciferrefused—because, we are told, of his pride. However, according to the Moslemreading of his case, it was rather because he loved and adored god so deeply andintensely that he could not bring himself to bow before anything else. And itwas for that that he was flung into Hell, condemned to exist there forever,apart form his love.88 [part0105.html#footnote88]Satan is the epitome of infractible ego.The Persian poets have asked, “By what power is Satan sustained?” And the answerthat they have found is this: “By his memory of the sound of God’s voice when hesaid, ‘Be gone!’” What an image of that exquisite spiritual agony which is atonce the rapture and the anguish of love!89 [part0105.html#footnote89]“The God that holds you over the Pit of Hell, much as one holds a spider or somelothsome Insect over the Fire, ab-hors you, and is dreadfully provoked; hisWrath towards you burns like Fire; he looks upon you as Worthy of nothing elsebut to be cast into the Fire; he is of purer Eyes than to bear to have you inhis Sight; you are Ten Thousand Times so abominable in his Eyes as the mosthateful venomous Serpent is in ours.…you are thus in the Hands of an angry god;‘tis nothing but his mere Pleasure that keeps you from being at this Momentswallowed up in everlasting Destruction.” —Pastor Jonathan Edwards90[part0105.html#footnote90]”God’s mere pleasure,” which defends the sinner from the arrow, the flood, andthe flames, is termed in the traditional vocabulary of Christianity God’s”mercy”; and ”the mighty power of the spirit of God,” by which the heart ischanged, that is God’s “grace.” In most mythologies, the images of mercy andgrace are rendered as vividly as those of justice and wrath, so that a balanceis maintained, and the heart is buoyed rather than scourged along its way. “Fearnot!” says the hand gesture of the god Śiva, as he dances before his devotee thedance of the universal destruction.“Fear not, for all rests well in God.

It’s a joy that comes from inside. It is not something that puts thejoy in you, but a place that lets you so experience your own will, your ownintention, and your own wish that, in small, the joy is there.

The gentlemenin these groups would always invite me to have lunch at a very nice restaurantat the Watergate Hotel, and this time they asked this chap to drive me overthere.He had a zoom-zoom sports car, and he was quite the guy.

Anyone who is unable to understand a god sees it as a devil. “Devil” is a word we usefor another peoples’ god. All anyone is really trying to do is have an expansion of consciousness, so thatthe knowing and loving are on greater and greater horizons. That’s what happenswhen the kuṇḍalinī comes up: more and more of the body is informed with radianceand consciousness. The goal of the journeyis to discover yourselfas consciousness. Joyce says in Ulysses, “If you can put your five fingers through it, it is agate, if not a door.”93 [part0105.html#footnote93] The difficulties oneencounters may be looked at as having the possibility of transformation intoopening gates rather than closed doors.When you find yourself blocked by a concretized symbol from your childhood,meditation is a systematic discipline that will solve your problem. The functionof meditation, ideally, would be to transcend the concretized response anddeliver the message.The first thing I’d do would be to think, “What are, specifically, the symbolsthat are still active, still touching me this way?” What are the symbols?There’s a great context of symbols in the world. Not all of them are the onesthat afflict you. When you do find the symbol that is blocking you, find somemode of thinking and experience that matches in its importance for you what thesymbol meant. You cannot get rid of a sym-bol if you haven’t found that to whichit refers.If you find in your own heart a center of experience for which the symbol hasbeen substituted, the symbol will dissolve. Think, “Of what is it the metaphor?”When you find that, the symbol will lose its blocking force, or it will become aguide.This is the “knowing” part of “to know, to love, to serve.” If you’re in troublewith this part because you do not really know what this thing refers to, then itwill push you around. I’m very, very sure of that.To dissolve such a concretization as an adult, you need to find what thereference of the symbol is. When that is found, you will have the elucidation.The symbol will move into place, and you can regard it with pleasure: assomething that guides you to the realization of what its message is, instead ofas a roadblock. This is an important point.That is the downward-pointed triangle. It is either an obstruction or the fieldthrough which the realization is to come."},{"pageContent":"Heaven and hell are psychological definitions. The Catholic definition of mortalsin should relieve you of the thought that you have committed one. As aCatholic, you learn that for a sin to be mortal, the kind that condemns you tohell, it has to be a grievous matter, over which there has been sufficientreflection, done with full consent of the will. So, a mortal sin is a deliberateexclusion of the gift of grace, and that is what the devil symbolizes. Youcannot open to supernatural grace, to the voice of God.Deliberately breaking the ritual law can be a mortal sin. But here’s the bizarrething about such a religion of ritual laws: kill your mother in a passion, andthat is not a mortal sin. That’s a venial sin, and you will have yourtwo-thousand years in purgatory on that one. But one little mortal sin, andyou’re bound for hell. Let’s all go in a big chariot. When the Church said thateating meat on Friday was no longer a mortal sin, there was a crisis in theentire Catholic community. In New York City, where there are a lot of Catholics,there was a great crisis, part of which had to do with the fish merchants. When the symbols are interpretedspiritually rather than concretely,then they yield the revelation. I want to tell about my relationship to confession. As a kid, you go toconfession, and you say, “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I disobeyedMother three times, didn’t say morning prayers two mornings, and told a lie.” Hesays, “You mustn’t do these things. Say five Our Fathers and five Hail Marys,and you’re clear.”I never got old enough to confess any significant sin. I don’t know what thehell would have happened. I did commit one little sin one summer, at ShelterIsland out on Long Island. I was about nine years old. There was a wonderfulhardware store named Ferguson’s. I remember it well. I’d go there with my motherand see her buy things. She’d say, “Charge it,” and then go out with them. Onesuch trip, I saw a wonderful penknife with all these things on it. So a few dayslater I went in alone and said, “I want that knife.” the owner said, “Here,Joe.” I said, “Charge it.” He said, “Okay.”I went home and said to Mother, “Look at the wonderful penknife I found.” Shesaid, “Are you sure you found that?” I said, “Yes, yes, I found it.” Well, atthe end of the month a bill came for the penknife, and Mother said, “Joe, comehere. When you go to confession on Saturday, take that penknife to FatherIsadore. Confess the sin, and then take the knife around to the sacristy andgive it to him.This was not easy. It was the most severe indication of what I’d done. Five OurFathers and five Hail Marys were nothing like giving up that knife. So, I wentto confession and tried to tell the priest what I had done. I was an altar boyat the time: you know, “mea culpa, mea culpa” stuff. Afterward, I went around tothe sacristy and gave him the penknife. And he said, “Oh, Joe, I didn’t know itwas that serious.”I knew something then that I didn’t know before I stole that penknife: chargingit without any idea of what the hell was going to happen was wonderful."},{"pageContent":"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The forgiveness in Roman Catholic confession is conditional. The absolution thepriest gives is conditional on a resolution on your part.First, you need contrition, meaning you are really, really sorry for havingcommitted that sin. Second, you make a resolution never to commit it again. Thatdoes not mean that you are not going to commit it again. It means that yousincerely resolve not to.In that wonderful Arthurian Romance of La Questa del St. Graal, where all theknights go out to discover the Grail, Lancelot could not behold the Grail. Why?Because of his adulterous affair with Guinevere. But the real reason was that hecould not honestly feel contrition for that love. How could Lancelot possiblyhave contrition for having experienced through Guinevere an illumination beyondwhat even the church had given him? And it is represented as such. He could notfeel sorry, and he could not resolve to cancel it, so he was unworthy to beholdthe Grail. The Grail is being in perfect accordwith the abundance of nature,the highest spiritual realization,the inexhaustible vessel from whichyou get everything you want. In a religion of duality,the sin and eternal punishmentcomes from the outside,from the ruling concrete god. There’s a knight in mortal sin. And yet, the monk who wrote that Romance had asense of the charm of Lancelot’s life: he’s the most human, the most touchingcharacter in the whole context. These are ironical things, which is why,finally, the priest says, “God’s will? We don’t know God’s will. There may beforgiveness that we don’t know anything about.” I will hold this love against God,eternal damnation, anything.That is true love. When I was about sixteen years old, in prep school, and knew I was losing mychildhood faith, I resolved that I would not quit the Catholic church until Iknew why I was quitting, that is to say, until I had dissolved the symbols andknew what they referred to and meant. The whole thing wasn’t over until I wastwenty-five years old and in Germany. I spent nine years working everything out,and then it just dropped off like a worn-out shirt. That’s the knowing thing. Ifyou don’t know what the hell that symbol is saying to you, then it’s just thereas a command, and there is going to be more and more of this hanging on. If youcan’t use your mind in this rather complex field, I don’t know how you are goingto work it out. You become maturewhen you becomethe authority for your own life."},{"pageContent":"COULD God exist if nobody else did? No. That’s why gods are very avid forworshipers. If there is nobody to worship them, there are no gods. There are asmany gods as there are people thinking about God. When Mrs. Mulligan and thePope are thinking about God, it is not the same God. In choosing your god, you chooseyour way of looking at the universe.There are plenty of Gods.Choose yours. The god you worshipis the god you deserve. When you say that God needs man and man needs God, that “God” that’s beingtalked about is the image of God, the concept of God, the name of God, theethnic God. You bet he needs man. He wouldn’t be there if it weren’t for man. In the tribe, deities were personifications of power.In later years,they became the source of power. All the gods of the world are metaphors, not powers. All imaging of God, if the word is going to mean anything besides “this is whatMother taught me,” is supposed to refer to that which transcends all knowledge,all naming, all forming; and, consequently, the word has to point past itself.In our tradition, the idea of God is so strongly personified as a person thatyou get stuck with that problem whenever you think of God. God is not an illusion,but a symbol pointing beyond itselfto the realization of the mysteryof at-one-ment. Jung, in his book Answer to Job, deals with the image of God that has come downthrough the centuries. How can we relate to it? Well, the Old Testament image,Yahweh, is of a lawgiver, a very strong dictator, an angry father. And in theBook of Job, you have the epitomization of that image.Here is this Job, who has been a good man, and Yahweh, the God, boasting to thedevil, Satan, says: “Have you considered Job? How loyal he is to me? How heloves me?” And Satan says, “Well, you’ve been pretty good to him. Make it toughand see how long this is going to last.” Yawheh says, “I bet ya.” And Satansays, “I bet ya.”Gilbert Murray has commented: “It’s as though someone says, ‘My dog won’t biteme no matter what I do.’ And someone else says, ‘I bet he will.’ The dog’smaster says, ‘I bet he won’t.’ And the other person says, ‘Get going now, seehow badly you can abuse him, and then see if he won’t bite you.’”So that’s the situation, and after the wager, things get rough. What a time Jobhas! His family is killed, his wealth is taken from him, and he ends up on aheap of ashes with a case of boils. His friends, his so-called “comforters,”annoy him further by saying, “You must have been a pretty bad chap to deserveall this.” He says, “No, I’m good.” And he’s right: he is good.Well, with this challenge to God, he finally has to come through and showhimself. I mean, it’s a big deal. So, God shows himself, and what does he say?He says, “Who are you, you little worm, to question me? How dare you evenconsider that you could understand what is happening to you? Could you fillLeviathan’s nose with harpoons? I did it. Try it.”Job is completely cowed. He suspends human judgment. He says, “I have heard ofyou with the hearing of my ears. Now I behold you with my eyes, and I amashamed. I cover my head with ashes.”Now, reading that in terms of its real spiritual message, what it means is thatyou cannot judge your destiny in terms of something that was done to you bysomebody. I mean, what is actually happening there—although it is notadmitted—is that the image of God as a person is exploded. When you get to thetrans-personal, you can’t speak of “justice” and “injustice.”What about all the landslides along the Big Sur coastline and the millions ofdollars of damage they’ve caused? If you take these acts of nature as somethingthat somebody has done to the people living there, you have the whole thingmessed up. But that’s not the way the Book of Job has been understood. It hasbeen under-stood in the way of submission to a person. And a person who wouldpull a deal like that on somebody is a pretty unappetizing type.Actually, the Book of Job, which dates from around the fifth century B.C., isanticipated by a Babylonian text from about 1500 B.C. called the “BabylonianJob,” in which a king, who has been sacrificing to the deities and building themtemples, has been overcome by, I think it was, leprosy. He tries to interprethis affliction in terms of what he has done in worship as a payment. Now, if youthink of worship as a form of payment for something, you’re on the wrong trackaltogether. The Book of Job really breaks down that idea. But if you are goingto hold to the image of God that is presented in the Book of Job, you havesomething that needs a little bit of refinement.So then the Christians, as a next step, take the idea of the Incarnation of thesecond person of the Blessed Trinity offering himself in love to the world to bea higher, more illuminated, form. In other words, God has been tempered bytaking the form of man and experiencing the world of man.But, says our friend Jung, this is not the answer either, because Christ was adivine incarnation born of a virgin, so he really wasn’t man, he was God. Yet,Jung argues, “God wanted to become man and still wants to.” So he provided forhis continuing incarnation, as it were, within man as the Holy Ghost, the thirdperson of the Blessed Trinity. So, if you want to see God in the world,recognize it in mankind. That’s the essence of Jung’s answer to Job: Don’t throwthis blame back on God, on the universe, or on anything of the kind. Realizethat all notions of God are historically conditioned images for qualities thatare to be recognized as actually being in man.“The incarnation in Christ is the prototype which is continually beingtransferred to the creature by the Holy Ghost.”—Jung94[part0105.html#footnote94] There is a darling little woman who comes to my lectures in New York, who was anun. She left the con-vent after hearing a couple of my talks. She did. That’sone of my great credits, you old bastard up there. The last time I was lecturingand she was in the group, she came up to me afterward and asked, “Mr. Campbell,do you think that Jesus was God, was God’s son?” I said, “Not unless we allare.” “Ahh!” she said, and off she went.And that’s what Jung is saying in his Answer to Job : it is actually the work ofman that is projected in the image of an imagined being called God. And so,historically, the God image is really a mirror image of the condition of man ata given time.Yet, I think most people take their image of God very concretely. Except for theFrench. A survey was taken in which people were asked, “Do you believe in God?Do you believe in hell?” The French—I think, seventy-five percent of them—didnot believe in God, but did believe in hell! I like Alan Watts’ reply: “If youbelieve in God, I don’t. If you don’t, I do.”My belief is that nobody experiences the ultimate rapture, because it’s beyondpairs of opposites, so if anyone did, there’d be nobody there anyhow. Jung isamusing on that point. “If you go beyond subject and object,” he wonders, “whois there to have the experience?” I think to give oneself a ground for anythingother than monastic living, all one has to do is realize that such a thing isimplied; that is to say, a mystery that is beyond subject, object, and all pairsof opposites is the mystery on the ground of which we ride.When the physicist explores the depths of the atom or the outer reaches ofspace, he discovers pairs of opposites and mysteries that science hasn’t beenable to penetrate. When it does penetrate to the next level, it’s stillmysterious. They’ve got so many sub-atomic particles. One is named after Joyce’s“quark.” It seems to me that’s about as mysterious as you can get. There is thetranscendent. Know it’s there, and then don’t worry about it. Simply behold theradiance everywhere."},{"pageContent":"People know there is a way to have this spiritual development take place, butthe Church is not helping us do it, because it’s talking about metaphoricalevents as if they were historical facts. The Pope is having a hard time nowbecause nobody believes any of it. Who believes in the Virgin Birth? The VirginBirth is metaphorical, and so is the Ascension. Sure, I can believe in theAscension of Jesus, but I’ve turned the outer space into the inner space: hewent into the place where heaven is: right inside. His Ascension represents theinward, mythological journey. And the Virgin Birth refers to the birth of thespiritual life in the human.“…this birth befalls in the soul exactly as it does in eternity, neither morenor less, for it is the same birth: this birth befalls in the ground and essenceof the soul.95 [part0105.html#footnote95]“God is in all things as being, as activity, as power. but he is procreative inthe soul alone; for though every creature is a vestige of God, the soul is thenatural image of God.… Such perfection as enters the soul, whether it be divinelight, grace, or bliss, must needs enter the soul in this birth and no otherwise. Do but foster this birth in thee and thou wilt experience all good and allcomfort, all happiness, all being, and all truth. What comes to thee thereinbrings the true being and stability; and whatsoever thou mayest seek orgrasp without it perishes, take it how thou wilt.”—M. Eckhart96[part0105.html#footnote96]That font of life is the core of the individual, and within himself he will findit—if he can tear the coverings away.97 [part0105.html#footnote97] The idea that we will have a divine visitation by some friendly forms, benignforces from other planets who will come to our aid and save us, is a clearreflection of an outmoded understanding of the universe. Jung wrote that themodern myth of unidentified flying objects tells us something of humankind'svisionary expectations. People are looking for visits from the outside worldbecause they think our deliverance will come from there. But the space agereminds us that voyages into outer space turn us back to inner space. TheKingdom of God is within us, but we have this idea that the gods act from “outthere.” The Kingdom of the Father is notgoing to come through expectation. We bring it about in our own hearts. The Kingdom is here. One looks at the worldand sees the radiance. The Easter revelation is right there.We don’t have to waitfor something to happen.98 [part0105.html#footnote98] What has always been basic to Easter, or resurrection, is crucifixion. If youwant resurrection, you must have crucifixion. Too many interpretations of theCrucifixion have failed to emphasize that relationship and emphasize instead thecalamity of the event. If you emphasize the calamity, you look for someone toblame, which is why people have blamed the Jews. But crucifixion is not acalamity if it leads to new life. Through Christ’s crucifixion we wereunshelled, which enabled us to be born to resurrection. That is not a calamity.So, we must take a fresh look at this event if its symbolism is to be sensed.If we think of the Crucifixion only in historical terms, we lose the symbol’simmediate reference to ourselves. Jesus left his mortal body on the cross, thesign of earth, to go to the Father, with whom he was one. We, similarly, are toidentify with the eternal life within us. The symbol also tells us of God’swilling acceptance of the cross, that is to say, of his participation in thetrials and sorrows of human life in the world, so that he is here within us, notby way of a fall or mistake, but with rapture and joy. Thus the cross has dualsense: one, of our going to the divine; the other, of the coming of the divineto us. It is a true crossing.In the Christian tradition, Christ’s crucifixion is a major problem: Why couldthe savior not have just come? Why did he have to be crucified?Well, various theological explanations have come down to us, but I think anadequate and proper one can be found in Paul’s Epistle to the Philippians, wherehe writes in chapter 2 that Christ did not think that God-hood was something tobe held to—which is to say, neither should you—but rather, yielding, he took theform of a servant even to death on the cross. This is joyful affirmation of thesufferings of the world. The imitation of Christ, then, is participating in thesuffering and joys of the world, all the while seeing through them the radianceof the divine presence. That’s operating from the heart cakra, where the twotriangles are joined together.That’s what I see in the Crucifixion. Of all the explanations I’ve read, it isthe only one that makes, what I would call, respectable sense. The others areall concerned with a wrathful god who has to be appeased by the sacrifice of hisson. What do you do with a thing like that? It is a translation of the sacrificeinto a very crude image. The idea of God being entity that has to be appeased isjust too nasty a concretion. Christ’s crucifixion,his going to the Father, the spirit,is not somethingthat should not have happened. It must happen. The hero’s death and resurrectionis a model forthe casting off of the old lifeand moving into the new.Not the animal world, not the plant world, not the miracle of the spheres, butman himself is now the crucial mystery. Man is that alien presence with whom theforces of egoism must come to terms, through whom the ego is to be crucified andresurrected, and in whose image society is to be reformed. Man, understoodhowever not as “I” but as “Thou”: for the ideals and temporal institutions of notribe, race, continent, social class, or century, can be the measure of theinexhaustible and multifariously wonderful divine existence that is the life inall of us.99 [part0105.html#footnote99]"},{"pageContent":"The central truth about Easter and Passover, which have the same roots, is thatwe’re all called out of the house of bondage, even as the Jews were called outof their bondage in Egypt.

Easter is not Easter and Passover is notPassover, unless they release us even from the tradition that gives us thesefeasts. Easter and Passovermake us experience in ourselvesa call out of bondage. So experiencing themdoesn’t destroyour religious traditions. Understanding these symbolsin their transcendent spiritual senseenables us to see our traditions freshlyand to possess them anew. Easter and Passover are prime symbols of what we are faced with in the spaceage. We’re challenged both mystically and socially, because our ideas of theuniverse have been reordered by our experience in space. The consequence is thatwe can no longer hold onto the religious symbols that we formulated when wethought that the earth was the center of the universe. The misunderstanding is readingspiritual mythological symbolsas though they were referencesto historical events."},{"pageContent":"The Kingdom of God is within us. Easter and Passover remind us that we have tolet go in order to enter it. The space age demands that we change our ideasabout ourselves, but we want to hold onto them. That’s why there is a resurgenceof old-fashioned orthodoxy in so many areas at the present time. There are nohorizons in space, and there can be no horizons in our own experience. We cannothold onto ourselves and our in-groups as we once did. The space age makes thatpossible, but people reject this demand or don’t want to think about it. So theypull back into one true church or black power or the unions or the capitalistclass.Easter and Passover offer the perfect symbols, for they mean that we are calledto new life. This new life is not very well defined, which is why we want tohold onto the past. The journey to this new life, a journey we all must make,cannot be made unless we let go of the past. The reality of living in spacemeans that we are born anew; not born again to an old-time religion, but born toa new order of things: there are no horizons. That is the meaning of the spaceage. We are in a free fall into a future that is mysterious. It is very fluid,and this is disconcerting to many people. All you have to do is know how to usea parachute.St. Augustine speaks of Christ’s going to the cross as a bridegroom to hisbride. There is an affirmation here. In the Prado, there is a great painting byTitian of Simon of Cyrene as he willingly helps Jesus with the cross. Thepainting captures the free, human, voluntary participation we all must have inthe Easter-Passover mystery. That is what we are all challenged to do.Self-preservation is only the second law of life. The first law is that you andthe other are one."},{"pageContent":"IN Mark 13, Jesus says that the end of the world is going to come, and hedescribes it as a terrible crisis of fire and all kinds of other horrors. So,according to the teachings of the Catholic church, it’s going to be a concretehistorical event. And in Mark 13:30, Jesus says, “Amen I say to you, thisgeneration will not pass away till all these things have been accomplished.” Butthat generation did pass away, and the end of the world didn’t come, so it’soften called “the great nonevent.” It didn’t happen. So then the Catholic churchsaid that when Jesus used the words “this generation,” what he meant was thegeneration of mankind, and so this event is yet going to happen.In the Thomas Gospel, on the other hand, when the apostles ask, “When will theKingdom come?” Jesus says, “The Kingdom will not come by expectation. They willnot say ‘see here, see there.’ The Kingdom of the Father is spread upon theearth, and men do not see it.”100 [part0105.html#footnote100] That’s Gnosticism. Gnosticism is the Westerncounterpart of Buddhism. Thomas says, in other words, that there is a revelation possible to you rightnow. It is here. So, “to be happy with Him forever in heaven” means to reachthat depth now. It’s a totally different slant. If you read Christian mythologyin the Gnostic way,it makes universal sense. Yet because the Catholic church insists that the coming of the Kingdom of theFather is going to be a historical event, every now and then, especially everythousand years, people think the end of the world is coming. In the year 1000,for instance, it was thought the end of the world was going to come, so peoplewith a lot of property gave their property to the church to gain merit. Thereare still cases in the French courts to get that property back. Now it’s timefor the second millennium, so everyone is expecting annihilation. Theseexpectations come automatically. There’s always a way to envision that the endis going to happen. I do not know what the situation will be in the year 3000,but if any of you happen to be around in a later incarnation, you can expectthat there will be some kind of panic.You see, Christianity was born in a panic time. In the centuries just before theChristian era, the Levant was in turmoil. The Hellenistic empire was breakingup, Rome was in its ascendancy, and the Jewish community was in a hell of acondition.In 167 B.C., Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Seleucid emperor of Syria, installed aGreek altar on the Jewish altar in the temple court of Jerusalem. Byestablishing a Greek shrine in the Jewish temple compound, he hoped he wouldshow that this religion was a variant of what all religions are about. No siree!Instead, Judas Maccabeus and his brothers killed the commissioner who was toestablish the shrine. There was an uproar, the Maccabean revolt, which led toindependent governance of the Jewish state for nearly a hundred years by asuccession of Maccabean priest-kings.In the age of the Maccabees the leaders in Jerusalem of the Hellenizing partywere the Sadducees, among whom were priestly families claiming descent from thepriestly patriarch Zadoc (Zadoc>Sadducee), and these were opposed chiefly by thePharisees, or “Separatists,” who believed themselves to be of a stricterorthodoxy—though, in fact, they had combined the old Hebrew heritage of a Day ofYahweh to come with the idea of the world end of Zoroastrian eschatology.101[part0105.html#footnote101] During that period there was continual internecine conflict, which intensifiedin 104 B.C., when the Jewish king Aristobulus claimed that he was, essentially,also the Messiah. This was heresy! Though he reigned only a year, his son,Alexander Jannaeus, spent the next thirty fighting a series of wars andsuppressing all Jewish insurrections with his foreign troops.And with [his] death, 76 B.C., the Pharisees came to power, and the internecinetide only ran the other way. New purges, fratricides, betrayals, liquidations,and miracles kept the kingdom in uproar until, after a decade of such madness,the Roman legion of Pompey was invited by one of two brothers who were thencontending for the crown to assist him in his holy cause; and it was in this waythat the city of God, Jerusalem, passed in the year 63 B.C. into the sphere ofRome.102 [part0105.html#footnote102] It was a fantastic period in Jewish history. With all this going on, at leastone sect, the Essenes, thought that the end of the world was coming. So, theywent out near Wady Qumrân, at the northwest corner of the Dead Sea, and built amonastery, where they rigorously trained to survive that ultimate moment whenthe Messiah would appear. We’ve learned about this Essene community from theDead Sea Scrolls, which were discovered hidden in desert caves and rockcrannies. These fantastic documents exhibit a very strong Zoroastrian influence.Even some of the vocabulary is Zoroastrian. One of the scrolls, for example,projects detailed plans for a forty-year apocalyptic war between “the Sons ofLight” and “the Sons of Darkness.”It is in this context, then, at precisely that time, the first century B.C.,that St. John the Baptist was baptizing people only a few miles north of theQumrân community. Now ritual bathing was a Qumrân rite, but John was not one ofthe Essenes, who wore white garments, for he wore the skins of animals and atelocusts and wild honey. The gospels recount that Jesus went out there, wasbaptized by John, and then went into the desert to have his own experience,known as “the Temptation in the Desert.” After forty days in thedesert—imitating, in small, the Hebrew’s forty years—he returned and began toteach. And that’s where his story really begins.It is not dissimilar from the story of the Buddha, who also goes out, studieswith the principle teachers of the time, goes beyond them in his austerities,comes to illumination, and returns. Whether or not it happened to either of themis a question. The myth of a teacher who goes past all teachers is a standardmotif.What Jesus thought he was, we just don’t know. He didn’t write anything. Hetalked sometimes as though he thought he was the god of the Greek mys-teries whodies and is resurrected—dies to today and is resurrected to tomorrow—but hewrote, as it were, in sand. What little we do know about him, we’ve learned fromthe four gospels, and they are of different dates and actually differconsiderably. For instance, if you look in your Bible, you will see that theVirgin Birth motif is found only in the gospel of Luke, a Greek. In Matthew andMark, where the genealogy of Jesus is related in detail from David on down theroyal line, it ends up, not with Mary, but with Joseph. Though we do not knowthe date of Jesus’ birth—we know nothing about it, in fact, except what we readin Luke—if he died, he probably died around 30 A.D. The gospels are funnythings. They don’t agree. Unfortunately, four people wrote them, and they wrotediffering accounts.Luke seems to have traveled with Paul, and the earliest writings about Jesus arethose of Paul, who never saw him. Paul, in fact, was in the crowd of Jewishzealots who killed the first Christian martyr, St. Stephen—which, by the way, iswhy Joyce calls his hero Stephen Dedalus. It was shortly after that event, onthe road to Damascus, that Paul’s conversion took place: he had a vision, felloff his horse, and, so to speak, “founded Christianity.” It seems that Paul, aJew who wrote elegant Greek, was torn between the monotheistic culture ofJudaism and the non-dualistic Greek tradition. So, my notion of what happened toPaul is that he realized that the catastrophic killing of this young, inspiredJewish rabbi could be read as an enactment of the death and resurrection of theGreek mystery hero."},{"pageContent":"Now, monotheism is a concretization of God, a mystery that actually transcendsconcretization, and the concretization of the mystery savior in Jesus isequivalent. So, God is concretized, the savior is concretized, the end of theworld is concretized, and Christianity loses its metaphoric perspective. If youread the historical “facts” as metaphors, however, then you will discover inChristianity a marvelous array of psychologically valid symbols that arefundamentally okay until they’re concretized.Concretization is alright for teaching little children, who don’t understandmetaphor. Matters such as these, they tend to take concretely. What has tohappen at a certain point in one’s development is that these child-hoodconcretizations have to be opened up. You can’t get rid of them, because symbolsthat are taken concretely are put right into you. They are internalized andcan’t just be dismissed. They have to be reread. I know. Until I wastwenty-five-years old I took Christianity concretely. And I must say I’mgrateful for having been exposed to such rich symbolism.Yet there’s also some great strength to be gained by giving up that religion, bygoing beyond it. I mean, if you really do. If you just “drop out,” that’ssomething else. But if you think it through—if you learn to read the symbols asmetaphors instead of accepting them as the facts they’re purported to be—if youknow, in other words, why you are out, then it can be a source of greatstrength. But when you do break out, you then have to set up your own sacredfield.When I was student, still in the Catholic church, there was one week each yearwhen we gave up all our studies and spent our time listening to sermons: somewere like the hell sermon Joyce recounts in A Portrait of the Artist as a YoungMan; others were on such themes as the meaning of the sacraments. The purpose ofthese “retreats,” as they were called, was to remove us from the secular worldand put us in a sacred space.Such events are examples of the church creating a sacred space, but it’s thechurch’s sacred space, set up according to its program. Now, if the church isthe rope you’re hanging onto, if that is what’s bringing you to your blissplace, then this approach avoids the problem of working this stuff out foryourself. But another way is to have your own little tabernacle, your own sacredspace, from which you exclude everything else.A sacred space is any space that is set apart from the usual context of life. Inthe secular context, one is concerned with pairs of opposites: cause and effect,gain and loss, and so on. Sacred space has no function in the way of earning aliving or a reputation. Practical use is not the dominant feature of anything inthe space. You do not have anything in your sacred space that’s not ofsignificance to you for the harmonization of your own life. In your sacredspace, things are working in terms of your dynamic—and not anybody else’s. Your sacred space iswhere you can find yourselfagain and again. You really don’t have a sacred space, a rescue land, until you find somewhere tobe that’s not a wasteland, some field of action where there is a spring ofambrosia—a joy that comes from inside, not something external that puts joy intoyou—a place that lets you experience your own will and your own intention andyour own wish so that, in small, the Kingdom is there. I think everybody,whether they know it or not, is in need of such a place."},{"pageContent":"Sacred space and sacred time and something joyous to do is all we need. Almostanything then becomes a continuous and increasing joy. What you have to do,you do with play. I think a good way to conceive of sacred space is as a playground. If whatyou’re doing seems like play, you are in it. But you can’t play with my toys,you have to have your own. Your life should have yielded some. Older people playwith life experiences and realizations or with thoughts they like to entertain.In my case, I have books I like to read that don’t lead anywhere. One great thing about growing oldis that nothingis going to lead to anything.Everything is of the moment. When Jung decided to try to discover the myth by which he was living, he askedhimself, “What was the game I enjoyed when I was a child?” His answer was makinglittle towns and streets out of stones. So, he bought some property and, as away of playing, began to build a house. It was a lot of work, utterlyunneces-sary for he already had a house, but an appropriate way to create sacredspace. It was sheer play. What did you do as a childthat created timelessness,that made you forget time? There lies the myth to live by. What do you like to do? What have you learned to do? Jung was a big, strong man,and he liked to push rocks around, so that’s what he did. I’ll bet that if yousearch back, you’ll find connections between the sacred space that you have nowand a really special space that you had as a child. As an adult,you must rediscoverthe moving power of your life. Tension, a lack of honesty,and a sense of unrealitycome from followingthe wrong force in your life. In my own situation, when I was between the ages of about eleven and fifteen, Iwas crazy about American Indians. My family bought me The Complete Works ofParkman, reports of the Bureau of Ethnology, and all sorts of other books on thesubject. I had a very nice little library, with beautiful, bronze, Indian headsthat were bookends, and Navajo rugs, and so on. Then the house burned down. Itwas a terrible crisis in our family. My grandmother was killed. All of my thingswere gone.I now realize that the sacred space I created for myself, the room in which I domy writing, is really a reconstruction—a reactivation, if you will—of myboy-hood space. When I go in there to write, I’m surround-ed by books that havehelped me to find my way, and I recall moments of reading certain works thatwere particularly insightful. When I sit down to do the writing, I pay closeattention to little ritual details—where the notepads and pencils are placed,that sort of thing—so that everything is exactly as I remember it having beenbefore. It’s all a sort of “set-up” that releases me. And since that space isassociated with a certain kind of performance, it evokes that performance again.But the performance is play. Work beginswhen you don’t likewhat you’re doing. And if your life isn’t play, or if you are engaged in play and having no fun,well, quit! The spirit of the sacred space is Śiva dancing. All responsibilitiesare cast off. There are various ways of doing this casting off. and it doesn’tmatter how it happens. The rest is play.“Any man who is attached to the senses and things of this world…is one who livesin ignorance and is being consumed by the snakes that represent his ownpassions.” —Black Elk103 [part0105.html#footnote103] A sacred space is hermetically sealed off from the temporal world. When you’rein such a space, there is no penetration through the enclosure. You are in aneternal zone that is protected from the impact of the stimuli of the day and thehour. That’s what you do in meditation: seal yourself off. The meditationposture is a sealing-off posture, and the regularized breathing furthers yourinward-turned explorations. The world is sealed off, and you become aself-contained entity.You must have such a sealing-off program for yourself whenever you require it:once a week, once a day, or once an hour. Of what value is that? It is anabsolute necessity if you are going to have an inner life. What it provides isan interval in which the eternal within you is disengaged from the field oftime. We spoke earlier of God’s making us “to know Him, to love Him, and toserve Him in this world,” out there, “and to be happy with him forever inheaven,” in the hermetically sealed sacred space within yourself. The furtheryou can get into that, the more at peace you will be with whatever happens.I was thinking of the sorts of conditions you set up for yourself to achieve thevisit to the Grail Castle—for that’s what this sacred space is: the place whereyour associations are not with the field of phenomenal experience, but with thefield of your own inward life. You do not get there in the normal run of life.To visit the Grail Castle, you have to have a sacred space. Then, once you havefound the connection in your sacred space, you can perhaps translate it intoother parts of your life. But first you have to have a little oil well, as itwere, that goes down deep. To live in sacred spaceis to live in a symbolic environmentwhere spiritual life is possible,where everything around youspeaks of exaltation of the spirit."},{"pageContent":"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I’ve been traveling a lot the last ten years, and when I’m not somewhere I’vebeen before, the kind of hotel room I prefer is a completely noncommittal room,an efficient room, the kind you find in a Holiday Inn. I open my bag, put mybooks on the table, hang my clothes on the open rack, and that’s it: here is JoeCampbell and here are his books—so what more do we have in the world? You canturn any place into a sacred space once you have your own sacred space. However,you can say that sacred space is everywhere only after you have learned, througha meditation discipline or the experience of sacred places, what the sanctityis. It is the metaphoric relevance of the object. In sacred space,everything is doneso that the environmentbecomes a metaphor. In India, I’ve seen sacred places that are just a red circle put around a stickor a stone in such a way that the environment becomes metaphoric: when you lookat that stick or stone, you see it as a manifestation of brahman, amanifestation of the mystery.Sacred space is a space that is transparent to transcendence, and everythingwithin such a space furnishes a base for meditation. I’m thinking specificallyof those Indian temples with a great wall around them: when you enter throughthe door, everything within that space is symbolic, the whole world ismythologized.The earliest sacred spaces of which we have any evidence might well have beenthe little shrines of Neanderthal man, where there was a cave-bear skull and alighted fire to build up a little atmosphere. The first, real sacred spaces wereprobably caves in southern France and northern Spain, dating from 30,000 B.C.When you go into those caves, you are in a magical sacred space, and yourconsciousness is transformed. I remember going into the big cave in Lascaux. Itwas fantastic. That universe down there seemed to be the primary world. Theanimals above ground were simply reflections of those on the walls of the caves.You don’t want to leave a place like that. The majesty and magic of it allsomehow brings you into your own center. And once you are there, then sacredspace is everywhere.I’ve been a few places like that where I’ve thought, “A breakthrough is possiblehere. This is a place for the exercises that will bring me to where I want tobe.” That’s the whole meaning of a cult. A cult is a sacred place. But if youget stuck in a cult—if you think, “I just can’t be anywhere if I’m nothere”—well, that’s too bad. You’re still in training."},{"pageContent":"WHEN I was in India, I wanted to meet a real, first-class master, and I didn’twant to hear any more slop about māyā and how you’ve got to give up the worldand all that kind of thing. I’d had enough of that for about fifteen or twentyyears. I was nosing around, listening, and I heard of one master in Trivandrum,in southwest India, and I decided to go see him. His mystic name was “SriAtmananda.” I’ll call him that. Now when you get close to a master of that kind,you’re bound to meet a lot of nuts. You just are, there’s no doubt about it. ButI knew that if I went, and if I was on the beam, I would get to see him.I went to this funny little hotel called the Mascot Hotel, where all the roomsopened out onto a veranda. It was fiercely hot, and I was seated on the veranda,when this chap comes up to me without any introduction, shows me this great bigwatch, and says, “See that? I have an hour hand, and I have a minute hand, and Ihave a second hand. ” Before I can respond, he says, “Men have periods, just aswomen do, only they don’t know it. But I’ve worked mine out. It’s represented onthis watch.” I looked at the watch. On it were two little scales, a red andwhite one on one side and a black and white one on the other, with littleindicators that could go this way or that. He points to the red and white scaleand says, “When this hand is over on the red side, I’m in my period. When it isin the white, I’m out.” Then pointing to the other scale, he says, “We havemental periods also, and I have those worked out too. When this hand is on theblack and the other is on the red, I stay home.” Imagine what it cost him tohave that thing made.That evening, down in the dining room, I saw a man and woman, who looked liketranslucent praying mantises. They were seated just across the room, and betweenthem, on the table, was a tall vase, and it was filled with food that they tookout and ate with their fingers. Later I met the man and learned that he waspresident of the International Vegetarian Society. He said he had come to Indiato reform vegetarianism, that the Indian people didn’t know anything about it!At the next table, two gentlemen were talking, and I heard one of them mentionthe name “Arthur Gregor.” Now, I knew a young American poet with that name, andI knew that he was in India, so I said, “Pardon me, did I hear you mentionArthur Gregor?” They said, “Yes, he is with Sri Atmananda.” I said, “Would yougive him my regards? My name is Joseph Campbell.”Two days later, I was invited to meet the guru. If you’re on your right track,that’s the way it goes: doors open miraculously. So, I went to a lovely cottage,and at the door was an Indian with a long, white beard. He said, “The master isupstairs.” I went up to an attic that was perfectly naked except for two chairs.Atmananda was seated in one, and I was to sit in the other, facing him. I mean,it was a real confrontation.He said, “Do you have a question?” I had the good fortune, I later learned, toask exactly the question that had been his first question to his guru, so we hada very good conversation. When we’d concluded, he said he had now to go down tohis class. He dismissed me, and I thanked him. Now, I had made arrangements tomeet some members of that class in a coffee shop after the class was finished.When I came in, one of them said, “The master said you are on the brink ofillumination.” Why? Because of the question I had asked.My question was this: “Since all is brahman, all is the divine radiance, how canwe say ‘no’ to ignorance or brutality or anything? His answer was: “For you andme, we say ‘yes.’” Breaking the ideals of societyis the path of the mystic. Then he gave me a little meditation: “Where are you between two thoughts?” Thatis to say, you are thinking all the time, and you have an image of your-self.Well, where are you between two thoughts? Do you ever have a glimpse beyond yourthinking of that which transcends anything you can think about your-self? That’sthe source field out of which all of your energies are coming. In meditating,meditate on your own divinity. The goal of life is to be a vehiclefor something higher. Keep your eye up therebetween the pairs of oppositeswatching your play in the world. Let the world be as it isand learn to rock with the waves. Remain “radiant,”as Joyce put it,in the filth of the world."},{"pageContent":"A Buddha image is not a picture of the historical Buddha. We are all Buddhabeings, all things are Buddha beings. So, an image of the Buddha is not a gravenimage to be understood concretely. It is a meditation tool, something to be seenthrough. It is a support for meditation on the Buddhahood within you, not adepiction of any actual Buddha “out there.”God and Buddhas in the Orient are not final terms like Yahweh, the Trinity, orAllah, in the West—but point beyond themselves to that ineffable being,consciousness, and rapture that is the All in all of us. And in their worship,the ultimate aim is to effect in the devotee a psychological transfigurationthrough a shift of his plane of vision from the passing to the enduring, throughwhich he may come finally to realize in experience (not simply as an act offaith) that he is identical with that before which he bows.104[part0105.html#footnote104]The entire heavenly realmis within us, but to find itwe have to relate to what’s outside. It is in this context that one says, “If you see the Buddha coming down theroad, kill him.” That is to say, if your notion of Buddhahood is concretized tothat extent, then cancel the concretization. You cannot say that about Jesus, atleast not in the orthodoxy. You must kill your god. If you are to advance,all fixed ideas must go. Most Buddhas that one sees depicted are what are known as “meditation Buddhas,”and they never lived. They represent Buddha powers within all of us, and incontemplating them, you will choose and be guided by your own Buddha—as, in theCatholic tradition, your principle guide is a particular saint, who representsvirtues and qualities that are somehow accessible to you. The Buddha image,then, isn’t a picture of the Buddha. It is a tool to help you meditate on theBuddhahood within yourself.This whole drift of Buddhism comes to a very clean expression in Zen, wherethere are no images. The only picture in a Zen monastery would be ofBodhidharma, the wall-gazing teacher who came to China from India, and thatimage would simply be a reminder of how to meditate. Finding the Buddha withinyourself is a difficult exercise, and sometimes images help. You have to realizethat Buddhism is not only an elite religion, but also a popular religion. Apopular religion must provide bases for meditation. As a result, there is a longhistory in Buddhism of relic worship. All of those great stūpas, those monumentsof the early Buddhist world, are reliquary mounds. Each one contains a relic,just as every Catholic church is supposed to be built on a relic. It is all abase for meditation."},{"pageContent":"Two great divisions of Buddhist thinking are distinguished. The first wasdedicated to the ideal of individ-ual salvation and represented the way to thisend as monastic self-discipline. The second, which seems to have matured innorthern India during and following the first and second centuries A.D. (longafter the other had been disseminated as far southward as the island of Ceylon),proposed the ideal of salvation for all and developed disciplines of populardevotion and universal secular service. The earlier is known as the Hīnayāna,“the lesser or little (hīna) boat or vehicle (yāna),” while the secondis Mahāyāna, “the great (mahat) boat or vehicle,” the boat in which all canride.105 [part0105.html#footnote105] Before the period of Mahāyāna Buddhism, the Buddha was never depicted. Hence, inthe illustration of the Buddha’s life on the early stūpas, there are onlysymbols of the Buddha—his footprints, an umbrella, a sun disk—because the Buddhais one who is identified no longer with his ego but with total consciousness,and consequently, cannot be depicted. He’s like the sun that has set, and youdon’t depict what is not. As a result, in early depictions of the Temptation ofthe Buddha, the temptation is rendered—on one side of the throne are theposturing daughters of Kāma, Lord Desire, and on the other, the ogres of Māra,King Death—but nobody is in the throne. Well, there was nobody there. He was notidentified with this personality.With the arrival of Mahāyāna, however, comes the idea that the distinctionbetween nirvāṇa and saṁsāra —“the round of being,” the round of rebirth—is adualism, and the two are, in fact, one: nirvāṇa is here, this is it. There is atotal transformation of consciousness, and images of the Buddha appear. Imagesof everything appear, because they are all Buddha things.The word saṁsāra refers to the torrent of time, to our participation in theDionysian passage of time with all things coming and going. Time explodes formsand brings out new ones, and you are one of those forms. In so far as youidentify with your body, you think, “Oh, my God, here I go!” You live in life;you die; and, depending on your life, you go either to a hell or a heaven, andfrom there you come back to the next life. In the Oriental system, this isall saṁsāra, the round of being. nirvāṇa goes past that. We are but reflectionson the wall of the cave. From where do they come?The word nirvāṇa means “blown out,” the breath that enlivens the world has beenblown out of you. In Jainism, another Indian philosophy, nirvāṇa is thought ofas death. But in Indian there is reincarnation, so you cannot truly die untilyou’ve achieved release from life.The Buddha is the one who stresses the psycholog-ical aspect of this “dying.”You can stay alive, in action, but be disengaged from desire for, and fear of,the fruits of your actions. This psychological disengagement of your passionsfrom the events of your life is nirvāṇa.With the Mahāyāna, then, comes the simultaneous experience of these twoattitudes toward the one thing which is life. So, you can be alive, in samsara,but acting without passion—that’s nirvāṇa. That’s also the idea in thepost-Buddhistic Bhagavad Gītā, 563–483 B.C. The Bhagavad Gītā says:“Get in there and do your thing.Don’t worry about the outcome.” Recognize sorrow as of the essence.When there is time, there is sorrow. We can’t rid the world of sorrow,but we can choose to live in joy."},{"pageContent":"The term bodhisattva, “one whose being (sattva) is enlightenment (bodhi),” hadbeen employed in the earlier vocabulary…to designate one on the way torealization but not yet arrived: a Buddha in his earlier lives, a Future Buddha.In the new vocabulary…the term was used to represent the sage who, while livingin the world, has refused the boon of cessation yet achieved realization, and soremains a perfect knower in the world as a beacon, guide, and compassionatesavior of all beings.106 [part0105.html#footnote106] The Bodhisattva voluntarilycomes back into the worldknowing that it’s a mess. He doesn’t come back“only if it’s sweet for me.” The Bodhisattvaparticipates joyfullyin the sorrows of the world. ”The great Mahāyāna Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara is a personification of thehighest ideal of the Mahāyāna Buddhist career. His legend recounts that when,following a series of eminently virtuous incarnations, he was about to enterinto the surcease of nirvāṇa, an uproar, like the sound of a general thunder,rose in all the worlds. The great being knew that this was a wail of lamentuttered by all created things—the rocks and stones as well as the trees,insects, gods, animals, demons, and human beings of all the spheres of theuniverse—at the prospect of his imminent departure from the realms of birth. Andso, in his compassion, he renounced for himself the boon of nirvāṇa until allbeings without exception should be prepared to enter in before him—like the goodshepherd who permits his flock to pass first through the gate and then goesthrough himself, closing it behind him.”—Zimmer107 [part0105.html#footnote107] The Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, with a woman’s earring in one ear and a man’sin the other, represents mercy, or compassion. The name Avalokiteśvara is adifficult word to translate, but the sense of it is “he who looks down on theworld with mercy.” Avalokiteśvara is frequently pictured as a male flanked bytwo female figures called “Tārās,” personifications of the tears of mercy thatflow from the Bodhisattva’s eyes: one from the right eye, the other from theleft. The word tārā is related to our word “star” and to the verb “to strew.”The Tārās strew out mercy to the world, which is, to me, one of the most darlingnotions.When this tradition went to the Far East, to China and Japan, Avalokiteśvara’sfeminine aspects were accented and this Bodhisattva became female, representedin the character of Kuan-yin, Kannon in Japanese, for the female form wasthought to be a more appropriate manifestation of the fostering of self-givingcompassion than the male, which usually represents discipline.Peace is at the heart of all because Avalokiteśvara-Kannon, the mightyBodhisattva, Boundless Love, includes, regards, and dwells within (withoutexception) every sentient being. The perfection of the delicate wings of aninsect, broken in the passage of time, he regards—and he himself is both theirperfection and their disintegration.108 [part0105.html#footnote108] In another manifestation, Avalokiteśvara has a thousand hands surrounding himlike a halo, and in the palm of each is an eye that is pierced by the sorrows ofthe world, as Christ’s hands were pierced by nails. They are equivalent symbols.Christ is a Bodhisattva. Buddhists have no problem accepting Christ, but theydon’t accept him as a unique manifestation and the only way.Mahāyāna Buddhism and Christianity grew up simultaneously. The two systems areof the same dates and developed fifteen-hundred miles apart on a military roadthat was built by the Persians.When the Bodhisattva teaches, we have been told, he assumes the outward forms ofhis auditors; but his message is addressed to the Wisdom-Self within each, towake and call it to life.109 [part0105.html#footnote109]"},{"pageContent":"When the Dalai Lama, the incarnation of Avalokiteśvara, first came to New York,there was an interesting event. At his first reception, in St. Patrick’sCathedral—where there were Roman Catholic clergy, Eastern patriarchs, Jewishrabbis, and, I suppose, even psychiatrists—what he said was, “All of your waysare valid ways to expansion of consciousness and illumination.” Of course,Cardinal Cook had to get up and say, “No, we’re different. Our religion is notto be confused with these other ways.”I was also at the next event, a Buddhist event at the Cathedral of St. John theDivine. About fifteen-hundred people from various Buddhist communities orsocieties in New York gathered in the big nave of that cathedral and had a realTibetan ceremony, with monks chanting and all. The Dahli Lama gave a brief talkin Tibetan and a young man instantly translated his intricate theologicalTibetan into English. What a fantastic performance!What the Dalai Lama said was, “Now you are on the Buddhist way. Keep up yourmeditation, as there is no instant illumination. The mind moves slowly intothis. Do not become attached to your method. When, in the course of yourmeditation, your consciousness will have expanded and been transformed, you willthen recognize that all the ways are valid ways.” The rational mindstresses opposites. Compassion and lovego beyond pairs of opposites."},{"pageContent":"The Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī is shown with a sword known as “the sword ofdiscrimination.” Discrimination has to do with discriminating between the mortaland the eternal. The mortal is that which you see. When you see yourself in themirror, that is the mortal. The eternal is that which you are. So,discriminating in your life between the eternal and the mortal is the essence ofthis figure. The sword is usuallya benevolent instrumentwhich clears the way. When you are desiring things and fearing things, that’s mortality. The threetemptations of the Buddha—desire, fear, and duty—are what hold you in the fieldof time. When you put the hermetic seal around your-self and, by discriminatingbetween the mortal and the enduring, you find that still place within yourselfthat does not change, that’s when you’ve achieved nirvāṇa. That still point isthe firmly burning flame that is not rippled by any wind.When you find that burning flame within yourself, action becomes facilitated inathletics, in playing a musical piece on the piano, or in performance of anykind.. If you can hold to that still place within yourself while engaged in thefield, your performance will be masterly. That’s what the Samurai does. And thereal athlete.Watch a professional marathon runner: he is not concerned with his showing theway somebody who is running his first race is. You win, you lose, you run therace. The race is what counts, not the winning or the losing. Running themarathon is itself the event. Everybody wins. Whether you win or place is asecondary matter. This is participation without engagement.But if you lose that still point, you are all in the world. If, for example, yougo into the race as a front runner, thinking you are going to have to win, andyou are concerned that you don’t quite have the capacity to do so, then youwon’t be participating in the marathon. Nietzsche says one must act with onlythree-quarters of one’s power. That’s the discrimination. Anything you do has a still point.When you are in that still point,you can perform maximally. Where are you between two thoughts? If you identify yourself with certainactions, certain achievements and failures, those are thoughts. That’s you inthe field of time and experience. Where are you otherwise?If it weren’t difficult to get to that still point, there wouldn’t have to be somuch talk about it and all this sitting in postures trying to get there. Andthen, when you get up from the posture, you are right back where you were. So,you go back to the posture to see if you can get there again. It’s not easy;yet, it’s very easy. It’s like riding a bicycle: you keep falling off until youknow how to ride, and then you can’t fall off.It’s a perspective problem. Running through the field of time is this energywhich is the one energy that is putting itself into all these forms. Byidentifying with that one energy, you are at the same time indentified with theforms coming and going. If you see the two modes—involvement and the still pointwithin you, samsara and nirvāṇa—as separate from each other, you are in adualistic position. But when you realize that the two are one, you can hold toyour still point while engaging. It’s the same world experienced in twodifferent ways. You can experience both ways at once.Sri Ramkrishna was devoted to the Goddess Kālī. Kālī, the word means “black” andalso “time,” is that black abyss of mystery out of which all things come andback into which they go. That’s Kālī. Her principle image is that of dancing inthe burning ground,the place where corpses are burned. This is dissolution. Sheis dancing on the body of her god, Śiva, her husband. Your god is the finalobstacle to get past.Any idea, any concept, any name, is a final obstacle. The one preached in thechurch in any religion is the final obstacle. The only Western teacher I havefound who gets it is Meister Eckhart, who says, “The ultimate leave-taking isthe leaving of God for God.” All of our religions hang onto the image. None hasgone past its god. The still point is going past the god. Goethe says,“Everything temporal is but a symbol.”110 [part0105.html#footnote110] Nietzschesays, “Everything eternal is but a metaphor.” They are saying the same thing.“Everything” includes God, heaven, hell, the whole works. So as long as you areliving to get to heaven, you won’t find that still place. One has to go beyondthe pairs of oppositesto find the real source."},{"pageContent":"In Buddhism, those who attain nirvāṇa are said to have “achieved the yondershore”; that is to say, they have crossed the river from the normal experienceof life to the yonder shore of nirvāṇa, beyond all pairs of opposites, beyondtwoness. Heinrich Zimmer gave this amusing anecdote to help us understandBuddhism:Let’s say you’re living in San Francisco, and you are simply fed up with SanFrancisco. You have heard of Berkeley: the wonderful people there and thesecouncils of sages. There are domes that suggest temples. You’ve never been tosuch a place, but you have heard of it. It seems that this Berkeley would be agreat escape from San Francisco, and so—in the old days before the bridge—you goto the shore, you look across, and you think, “If I could only get away fromthis place—saṁsāra, the world of pain and effort—and go to Berkeley, I would besaved.”Well, one fine day, you see a ferryboat set off from the yonder shore, and itcomes right to where you are standing. There’s a man in the boat who says,“Anyone for Berkeley?” This is the Buddha in the Buddha boat. And you say, “I.”And he says, “Well, get aboard, but remember: this is a one-way trip. It takesgreat effort. There’s no coming back to San Francisco. You will give upeverything: your career, your family, your ambitions. Everything.” You say, “I’mfed up with every-thing.” “Okay,” he says, “you are eligible.”This ferryboat is known as the “lesser vehicle.” It’s for “Little Ferryboat”Buddhism, Monk Buddhism. To board it, you have to be ready to become a monk or anun and give up the whole thing. In India, the saffron robes the monks wear arethe color of the garment put on a corpse. These men are dead. Are you ready toput on the garment of a corpse? You are? Get on the boat. Sri Ramakrishna says,“Do not seek illuminationunless you seek itas a man whose hair is on fireseeks a pond.” The ferryboat starts out, and it suddenly comes over you what you’re leaving,but you are already on the boat. You’re a monk or a nun. You’re a sailor. Youlove the sound of the waves slapping on the side of the boat, you learn how tolift sails and bring them down, and you use a different vocabulary: you call theright side, the “starboard” side, and the left side, the “port”; the front is“fore,” the back, “aft.” You don’t know any more about Berkeley than you didbefore you got on the boat, but people in San Francisco you’re now calling“fools.” You thought it would be a short trip, butit may continue for three or four incarnations.This is the monk’s life. This is the student’s life. This is obeying orders.Life is reduced to pushing beads here and there and chanting OM. You havereduced life to something that is a pretty simple affair. You would not wantthat to end. It’s like a situation I’ve seen in art studios: the student isworking on a piece of sculpture, and the master looks at it and says,“Continue.” Of course, the disaster would be if he said, “You’ve got it, you’refinished.” “Oh no, I don’t want to leave school.” The last thing you want is notto be a monk or a nun.Finally, after several incarnations, the boat scrapes ashore, and you think,“This is it: rapture, nirvāṇa!” You go ashore. There are explosions: LSD and thewhole goddamn thing—but it’s not the goal at all.The Buddha, in the conversations known as the “Medium-length Dialogues,” says,“Oh, Monks, supposing a man, wishing to get to the yonder shore, should buildhimself a raft, and by virtue of that raft, achieve the yonder shore; then, outof gratitude for the raft, he picks it up and carries it about on his shoulder.Would that be an intelligent man?” The monks reply, “No, Master, that would notbe an intelligent man.” “So,” says the Buddha, “the laws and experiences of theorder of yoga have nothing to do with nirvāṇa. The vehicle of the doctrine isthe way that you get to the yonder shore, and having attained it, you cast awaythe raft and forsake it.”So, you are on the yonder shore, and you think, “I wonder how San Franciscolooks from Berkeley?” You turn around and…there is no San Francisco, there is nobay, there is no boat, there is no Buddha.You thought there was an opposition. You were still thinking in terms of pairsof opposites. The place you have left is exactly where you are. It’s simply yourperspective that has been changed. This is the point of view of the so-called“Great Ferryboat,” or Mahāyāna tradition, where we realize that all things areBuddha things, we are on the Great Ferryboat, and the ferry-boat is alreadythere. Furthermore, since the first doctrine of Buddhism is “no self,” there isnobody on the boat! The real self is that transcendent life and Buddhaconsciousness of which we are all just visionary moments. This is the Mahāyāna."},{"pageContent":"So we hear next, “Delight is yoga.” The life you are living is your yoga. AsRamakrishna put it, “The little nephew that you love is your God.” The irony ofthis wonderful discipline is that it teaches that you, who were bored, are inexactly the same place, but in rapture, simply because you’ve shifted your levelof consciousness. You’ve given up thinking things should be the way they arenot, and you realize, “This is it. This is it. This is it.” And you get tosaying “This is it” by first saying, “This is not it.” That discriminationforces you into a different level of consciousness. What “isn’t it” is the wayyou’re looking at it. The Buddha is the one whose eyeof full consciousness has opened. This is the journey that comes through worship, because a deity represents adegree of power,a degree of consciousness of knowledge and love that is on alevel not immediately apparent to the eyes. The Tantric saying “to worship agod, you must become a god” means you must find in yourself the level ofconscious-ness and love that the deity epitomizes and symbolizes. When you do,you are worshiping that deity.It doesn’t matter what name you give the deity. People say, “Oh, we areChristians: Father, Son, Holy Ghost, and the Virgin Mary.” But if you can’t getinto yourself on the level of the Christ within you, you are not a Christian.And depending on the level of awareness you have reached, your worship will bedifferent from that of people in the same church who aren’t at the same level.Saying you are a member of this church, that church, or the other is a socialnotion, a sociological phenomenon that has nothing to do with religion. What is your religion telling you?How to be a Jew? A Catholic?Or how to be a human being? I had a friend, a marvelous young man named John, who became an editor of theJesuit periodical America about the time that the Catholic church got interestedin the ecumenical movement. Everybody was trying to correlate Catholicism withthe other religions, but at the same time, they were denigrating them. So, Johnwould always be telling them, for example, “No, you can’t do that with Hinduism.You can’t put it down by misrepresenting it. You’ve got to face up to it.”Well, there was a big Roman Catholic conference of the meditationorders—Cistercians, Trappists, and so forth—in Bangkok, and John was there as anobserver. By the way, it was while attending this conference that Thomas Mertondied. He was electrocuted by a bad fixture in some absurd Thai hotel. John latersaid that the talk that Merton had given just before his death was one of themost magnificent he’d ever heard.When John came back, he said the Christian monks and Buddhist monks had noproblem communicating. As anyone who’s tried to be a poet knows, when you’ve hada spiritual experience, the words don’t render it. All they can do is give aclue. The experience goes beyond anything that can be said. The religious senseis implied in the metaphoric language of religion. “But,” he said, “the layclergy who have never had the experience, but have only read the books, are incollision all the time.” What is the Kingdom? It lies in our realization of the ubiquityof the divine presence in our neighbors, in our enemies, in all of us.111[part0105.html#footnote111]"},{"pageContent":"The big lesson in Buddhism, then, the sense of what we have been saying is, “Getaway from your rational system and get into the wonderful experience that ismoving through all things all the time.” It is through livingthat we experience and communicatethe spirit. It is through lifethat we learn to live in the spirit. One in full quest of the spiritknows that the goal of life is death. I recall a wonderful talk I had with Alan Watts, who was a marvelous man. One ofmy problems was that Jean was always late. I’d make an appointment to meet hersomewhere or other, and there I’d sit waiting for half an hour. I found it’s anormal thing for men to wait for women. They have so many things they have to dobefore they can walk out of the house that half an hour or more goes by quickly.Now, it’s a basic rule in New York that it takes a half-hour to get anywhere,but Jean always thought that the time when she was supposed to be somewhere wasthe time to leave. So, I had this long wait problem, and I said to Alan, “Whatcan I do about this? I get aggravated, and when she arrives, I’m a little bitnasty.”Alan said, “Well, your problem is that you want her to be there, and you’rewishing for a situation that is not the one you are in. Just realize that youare ruining the experience that you could be having there while waiting bythinking it should be otherwise.”So then, waiting for Jean became a spiritual exercise. I said to myself, “Youshould not be thinking that Jean should be here. Look around you and see what isgoing on.” And, you know, the place where I was be-came so goddamn interestingthat I wasn't bored at all. Oftentimes, I hoped that Jean would make me wait alittle longer. That would have seemed impossible to me, until Alan suggestedshutting out any thought that my situation should have been otherwise.That’s an example of what fear and desire do. I de-sired the situation to be theone we planned, and that desire forbade me my immediate experience: “This is it!This is life! Look at it! Isn’t it bubbling?” But now that I could love thesituation I was in, the waiting was no longer a bore. The psychologicaltransformation would be that whatever was formerly endured is now known, loved,and served. As long as you movefrom a place of fear and desire,you are self-excludedfrom immortality."},{"pageContent":"The aim of all religious exercises is a psy-chological transformation. You canmake up your own meditations and rites based on knowing, loving, and serving thedeity in caring for your children, doctoring drunks, or writing books. Any workwhatsoever can be a meditation if you have the sense that everything is brahman:the process, the doing, the thing that is being looked at, the one that islooking—everything. The returnis seeing the radianceeverywhere. The main problem is changing the location of your mind. The town you come backto is the one you left, otherwise the journey is not complete. You come back towhatever you regard as the place that is your life, to the same career, notnecessarily to the same locale. The yoga disciplines are disciplines. They arenot the place. You give yourself to lifeby leaving temporality behind. Desire for mortal gainsand fear of losshold you back from givingyourself to life. Fear and desire do not give rise to social duty, society does. Do-gooders comeand say, for example, “We have this picket line against nuclear armament. Pleaseget on the line, give up your thinking, and do what we ask you to do.” If you’re performing your social duty,it is not your act at all.Society has put it upon youand it will keep you from life. Dealing with such demands as compulsory social obligations means you are linkedand locked to a given order of life in the phenomenal world. You can involveyourself voluntarily, but there is no compulsion upon you to participate inthese actions. Nor are they necessarily the final good of mankind. That’s thewhole didactic sphere.People put social duty on you. Your neighbors say, “Why this apathetic sittingin meditation? Get up and do something for the world. You owe it to the world.”All that kind of thing. Duty doesn’t rise out of your fear. People put it onyou. Duty is dharma; that is to say, dharma understood as social dharma.Notice that little icon on the dollar bill, the static eye at the point wherethe pair of opposites come together. If you’re going to be in the world inaction, you have to be down the pyramid on one side or the other. It doesn’tmatter whether you are for Democracy or Communism or Fascism, you are still inthe field of time, and the radiance shines through no matter which one you’rein. You can also get locked into compulsive participation in any position. It isa matter of relativity. All judgments are transformed as you move from oneposition to another. Good and evil are not absolute. They are relative to whichside you are on. The limitation comeswhere your judgment comes. A wonderful example is a story I was told about a Buddhist monk whom a friendwas following. Now in Tibet, people go to a slaughter-house, buy a lamb that isabout to be killed, then give the lamb its freedom, and that is a pious act.Accordingly, this monk, who had a cluster of beautiful girls around him, wasgoing to perform a pious act by freeing five hundred fish.And so, with his constellation of beauties, he went from one bait shop toanother in Monterey trying to buy five hundred minnows. But bait was in shortsupply, and the shopkeepers said they were not going to sell him minnows forliberation. Finally, however, he found a shop that would, and he and hisentourage, carrying buckets filled with fish, went down to the shore, where theyhad a ceremony of blessing the fish that were about to be given their freedom.Then they dumped one bucket after another into the ocean. Well, pelicans flockedfrom every point of the compass, and the little monk ran back and forth, wavinghis robe, trying to keep the pelicans away.Now, what is good for pelicans is bad for fish, and this monk had taken sides.He was not in the middle place. This is to me a very important story. Every nowand then, I wake up laughing at that monk and his banquet for the pelicans.That is why the story of the lion lying down with the lamb is so silly. Readconcretely, you realize that when the lion is eating the lamb, he is lying downwith it. That’s how it was meant to be, and “shanti, shanti, shanti”: nothing ishappening. That is the perspective of the sublime, which annihilates egoconsciousness and its relationship. Without changing the world, there is escapefrom sorrow just by shifting the perspective. Life will always be sorrowful. We can’t change it, but we canchange our attitude toward it."},{"pageContent":"There is a story of the Buddha, in a little company of yogis, and he says, “Atone time I starved my body to such a degree that, when I touched my stomach, Icould grab my backbone. The thought occurred to me that this is not the way toachieve enlightenment. There is not enough strength in the body to absorb theexperience or even to achieve it. So it was then that I ate my first meal.”There was a lovely little girl around who was the daughter of a cattleherder,and she took the milk of a thousand cows and fed it to a hundred, that of ahundred she fed to ten, and the milk of those ten cows she fed to one. There wassuch power in that concentrated milk that, when she gave the bowl to the Buddhaand he drank of it, his whole body was refreshed. When he was finished, he threwthe bowl into the river and said, “If this bowl goes upstream, I shall become aBuddha.” It went upstream. That night the illumination came. Fear of your poweris what commits youto the lower system. If in me there is the kind of power that can stand against the tide of history,then I can become disengaged from it. Nietzsche says, “Beware of spittingagainst the wind.” You know what will happen. But if you can spit against thewind and it hits somebody else in the eye, then you’re going to be a Buddha.I’ve always looked for signs like that. When I had to register for the drafts,behind the desks there were three men and one woman. I said if the woman callsme, I won’t be drafted. The woman called me, and just when it was time for me tobe taken in, they learned that I was thirty-eight, and they could not use peopleof that antiquity. I think, as do the Buddhists, that what is to be is somehowimplicit in what is, and that to look for such signs is a natural and amusingthing to do.In our tradition, we do not operate in accordance with those fixed patterns. Webelieve that the ego, which makes value judgments and decisions for action,brings about change. Freud speaks of the ego as “the reality principle,” thatwhich puts you in touch with “reality,” reality with a small “r”: meaning, theindividual circumstances of your life and your relationship to thosecircumstances. And in our culture, the ego, the evaluating principle, isdeveloped. The mother asks, “What kind of ice cream do you want, Johnny,strawberry or vanilla?” “I want vanilla.” And he gets vanilla.In the East, by contrast, where everything you do is what you are told to do,they put something in front of you and you get what you are given. And ifeverything you do is what you are told to do, your ego is not being developed.Consequently, in the East, people have no concept of the ego. They don’t knowwhat the ego is. It doesn’t play any role. There is no individual evaluation.In Freudian psychology, the pleasure principle, the id, the zeal of life forholding on to food, comfort, sex, and life itself—the context I call “health,wealth, and progeny”—is what most people live for. Against the id, Freud positsthe superego, the social laws that discipline the individual, so that one does,not what one wants, but what society says one should do. In the East, inpsychological terms, the whole conflict is between superego and id. No egoprinciple is even considered.So, without anything that we would call an ego, the Easterner seekingillumination leaves his family, goes to a guru, and brings a little ball orshell, his ego, and he asks the guru to break it. And the guru takes a littlemallet, the yoga discipline, and—“bing!”—his ego is gone. But the Westernergoing to a guru brings with him a rock-solid ego that’s been the guiding forceof his whole life. And when he asks the guru to break his ego, the guru takesthe same little mallet and goes “bing! bing! bing!” for forty years and nothinghappens. The person just feels increasingly unhappy.I submit that if you are a person with an evaluating psyche. who is havingthoughts no guru ever had, there must be another way to have illumination. Ithink what Ramakrishna calls “the monkey way” can, in our culture, turn into theequivalent of the Buddhist “middle way.” That is to say, when you have found thecenter within yourself that is the counterpart of the sacred space, you do nothave to go into the forest. You can have a technique for extracting your ownrepose from that center. You can live from that center, even while you remain inrelation to the world."},{"pageContent":"There is a popular Indian fable that Ramakrishna used to like to tell, toillustrate the difficulty of holding in mind the two conscious planessimultaneously, of the multiple and transcendent. It is of a young aspirantwhose guru had just brought home to him the realization of himself as identicalin essence with the power that supports the universe and which in theologicalthinking we personify as “God.” The youth, profoundly moved, exalted in thenotion of himself as at one with the Lord and Being of the Universe, walked awayin a state of profound absorption; and when he had passed in that state throughthe village and out onto the road beyond it, he beheld, coming in his direction,a great elephant bearing a howdah on its back and with the mahout, the driver,riding—as they do—high on its neck, above its head. And the young candidate forsainthood, meditating on the proposition “I am God; all things are God,” onperceiving that mighty elephant coming toward him, added the obvious corollary,“The elephant also is God.” The animal, with its bells jingling to the majesticrhythm of its stately approach, was steadily coming on, and the mahout above itshead began shouting, “Clear the way! Clear the way, you idiot! The youth, in hisrapture, was thinking still, “I am God; that elephant is God.” And, hearing theshouts of the mahout, he added, “Should God be afraid of God? Should God get outof the way of God?” The phenomenon came steadily on with driver at its headstill shouting at him, and the youth, in undistracted meditation, held both tohis place on the road and to his transcendental insight, until the moment oftruth arrived and the elephant, simply wrapping its great trunk around thelunatic, tossed him aside, off the road.Physically shocked, spiritually stunned, the youth landed all in a heap, notgreatly bruised but altogether undone; and rising, not even adjusting hisclothes, he returned, disordered, to his guru, to require an explanation. “Youtold me,” he said, when he had explained himself, “you told me that I was God.”“Yes,” said the guru, “you are God.” “You told me that all things are God.”“Yes,” said the guru again, “all things are God.” “That elephant, then, wasGod?” “So it was. That elephant was God. But why didn’t you listen to the voiceof God, shouting from the elephant’s head, to get out of the way?”112[part0105.html#footnote112] Wisdom and foolishnessare practically the same.Both are indifferentto the opinions of the world. According to legend, when Avalokiteśvara looked down upon this suffering worldhe was filled with such compassion that his head burst into innumerableheads…while from his body sprang a thousand helping arms and hands, like an auraof dazzling rays, and in the palm of each hand there appeared an eye ofunimpeded vision.…Every pore of the body of Avalokiteśvara contains and pours forth thousands ofBuddhas, saints of all kinds, entire worlds. From his fingers flow rivers ofambrosia that cool the hells and feed the hungry ghosts.…He appears to brahmansas a brahman, to merchants as a merchant, to insects as an insect, to each inthe aspect of its kind.…113 [part0105.html#footnote113]"},{"pageContent":"part0105.html#footnote113\"THE goddess alone knew of the all-moving, secret world energy which had helpedthe gods to victory; it was the power within them, of which they were unaware.They believed that they were strong in themselves, but without this force, oragainst it, they could not so much as harm a blade of grass. The goddess knew ofthe universal force, which the Vedic priests called brahman and which Hinduscall śakti, for śakti, i.e. energy, is the essence and name of the Great Goddessherself, hence she could explain the mysterious being to the gods, she couldteach them its secret—for it was her own secret.”—Zimmer114[part0105.html#footnote114] In Hinduism, all power, śakti, is female. So, the female represents the totalityof the power, and the male is imaged as the agent of the female. In that sense,the power that a female feels from the male—the animus, in Jungian terms—is aspecification of the female power, a mode of application of that power. Every being has a twofold aspect, reveals a friendly and a menacing face. Allgods have a charming and a hideous form, according to how one approaches them;but the Great Goddess is the energy of the world, taking form in all things. Allfriendly and menacing faces are facets of her essence. What seems a duality inthe individual god, is an infinite multiplicity in her total being.…She is the mute security of life in itself; from the ashes of burned forests sheraises eager fresh flowers whose decay is pregnant with new life, a new lifewhich all around it sees only life in its transitions and transformations withno shadow of death, just as we ourselves, when we sink our teeth into a ripefruit, or draw a living plant from the garden, are without awareness of death.Whatever you do, in waking or sleeping, consciously or involuntarily in thecycle of your flesh to the accompanying music of your soul; whatever you do asyour body builds and destroys, absorbs and excretes, breathes and procreates, orbestows joy infringing on the limits of rage and pain—all this is a mere gestureof the Great Mother, jaganmayi (consisting of all worlds and beings), whounremittingly does likewise with her world body in endless thousands offorms.…To see the twofold, embracing and devouring, nature of the goddess, tosee repose in catastrophe, security in decay, is to know her and to besaved.…She is the perfect figuration of life’s joyous lures and pitilessdestruction: the two poles charged with the extremest tension, yet forevermerging.—Zimmer115 [part0105.html#footnote115] Also, in Hinduism, the sun is female and the moon is male: he is born of her,dies into her, and is born of her again every month. Śiva, this great power, isthe moon god. Pārvatī, his consort, is the sun power. And although the worshipin the masculine-oriented action systems in India is directly to Śiva, it’s tothe goddess Kālī, that the worship finally goes. So that, actually, in India,Kālī is the great divinity. …the Hindu goddess Kālī…is shown standing on the prostrate form of the god Śiva,her spouse. She brandishes the sword of death, i.e., spiritual discipline. Theblood-dripping human head tells the devotee that ”he that loseth his life forher sake shall find it.” The gestures of “fear not” and “bestowing boons” teachthat she protects her children, that the pairs of opposites of the universalagony are not what they seem, and that for one centered in eternity thephantasmagoria of temporal “goods” and “evils” is but a reflex of the mind—asthe goddess herself, though apparently trampling down the god, is actually hisblissful dream.116 [part0105.html#footnote116] The Goddessgives birth to formsand kills forms."},{"pageContent":"It’s interesting that in the North, in the European systems—and in the Chinesesystem, where one hears of yang and yin—the man is the aggressor, the activeprinciple, and the woman is the receptive and passive aspect. It’s just theopposite in India. The Hindu position is that woman is the śakti, the serpentpower that comes up the spine, the life-energy principle. She’s the activator,and the man just wants to be left alone. The man, psychologically, is interestedin other things, but when this power field goes by, he’s activated. As Joycewrites in Finnegans Wake, “With lipth she lith-peth to him all to time of thuchon thuch and thow and thow. She he she ho she ha to la.”117[part0105.html#footnote117] And wouldn’t it be nice to sthart the world again?And he thinks, “My god, yeah, it would.” And that’s it, he’s gone. He getsinvolved that way because she’s the whole damned energy in any of it’s aspects.Similarly, in the mythological systems of what we call, basically, the BronzeAge, the female was the great divinity and the source of all power. Forinstance, in the Egyptian image of the Pharaoh on the throne, the throne beingwhat gives him his authority, the throne is the goddess Isis. The same mythicimage comes up in Byzantine iconography of the Virgin and the Christ: the ChristChild sits on the Virgin’s knee just the way the Pharaoh sits on the throne: sheis his power. He is called the world ruler, but she’s behind him all the way.Likewise, in old pictures of Presidents of the United States, one usually seesthe President’s wife standing behind him. She’s Isis, and he’s the child on thethrone.There is a Pygmy dance where the woman ties the whole male community up with arope. They stand there completely immobilized and one of them says, “She hasmade us all silent.” Then she loosens them, and as each one is loose, he sings.They know this basic, basic mythological stuff that we’ve lost.Her womb is the field of space, her heart the pulse of time, her life the cosmicdream of which each of our own lives is a reflex; and her charm is theattractive power, not of a yonder shore, but of this. In short: in Biblicalterms, she is Eve; or rather, Eve extended to be the mother, not only of mankindbut of all things, the rocks and trees, beasts, birds and fish, the sun and moonand stars.118 [part0105.html#footnote118] The male power comes in with the Semites and Indo-European Aryans,masculine-oriented societies of herding peoples for whom the specific functionof the energy was to control the animals on the plains. Then you have theproblem of the relationship between male and female mythologies. Where agricultureis a main means of support,there are earth and goddess powers. Where hunting predominates,it’s male initiativethat empowers the killing of animals. In the Semitic tradition, the goddess is wiped out, and a prominent feature ofthat orthodoxy is a masculine fear of the female body, the prime anthropomorphicsymbol of Nature’s allure and power. This went to such extremes in Christianitythat nuns were not even allowed to look at their bodies. In Islam, the mostmale-oriented of the modern religions, a woman is nothing but a vehicle forproducing sons, and the male function is, in large part, the protection of thewomen. I was in PakistanI for only a few hours, but what I saw! Those women weregoing around in tents! Even their eyes were covered with cheesecloth, so you didnot know if it was an old hag or a glorious goddess walking around. And youcan’t respond to a tent. Male = social order.Female = nature order. The male’s job is to relate to life.The female’s job is to become it. The prime function of the male is to set up an eco-logical situation in whichthe woman can give birth, to prepare the field so that the female may bringforth the future, because she is the life. She is the totality. He is aprotecting factor, the agent of her power. If a woman loses her husband, she hasto take over a male role, but it is a mistake to regard that as somethingforeign to her own energy. The animus function is in every woman, but it isusually delegated to somebody.What I think has happened now—with so many women, left without husbands, beingthrown into the field of male achievement—is that women have been sold a bill ofgoods—perhaps not intentionally, but actually. With our strong emphasis on suchdramatic and conspicuous male activities as building cities filled withskyscrapers and sending jet-propelled rockets to the moon, women have come tobelieve that only the aims and virtues of the male are to be considered, andthat male achievement is the proper aim for everyone, as though that is whatcounts. No indeed.Women used to know how to run the world, but when they move into the secondaryenergy position of doing the job of the man—who is, in fact, just the agent ofthe female power—women lose their real power and become resentful. Spenglersaid, in a telling sentence that got into me when I read it: “Man makes history.Woman is history.” She’s what it is about, and the man fashions the field withinwhich she can produce history and be history. The man’s function is to act.The woman’s function is to be.She’s “It.” She is Mother Earth. So, the female is “It.” When you say the woman brings forth children, that’spart of just being, fulfilling a role that is already there in the very bodyitself. And the production need not be children. It can be in represent-ing thatpower, that quality, that being in life which the woman represents. This is whythe woman’s beauty or quality of character is so important in mythologicaltales, which does not mean that a woman who’s not physically beautiful does nothave this power. It’s right there in the female presence.The mythological figure of the Universal Mother imputes to the cosmos thefeminine attributes of the first, nourishing and protecting presence. Thefantasy is primarily spontaneous; for there exists a close and obviouscorrespondence between the attitude of the young child toward its mother andthat of the adult toward the surrounding material world. 119[part0105.html#footnote119]When Heinrich Zimmer, a great devotee of the Goddess, was trying to find hisplace in America, he was helped by the old ladies of the Jung Foundation. Theywere getting him jobs, helping his wife to find a place and so forth. He said,“When I look into those eyes, I say, ‘I see you there.’” So, she’s operative inevery woman in a way that the god is not operative in a man. I’ll never forgetthat wonderful twinkle in his eye when he said, “I see you there.”"},{"pageContent":"Woman, in the picture language of mythology, represents the totality of what canbe known. The hero is the one who comes to know. As he progresses in the slowinitiation which is life, the form of the goddess undergoes for him a series oftransfigurations: she can never be greater than himself, though she can alwayspromise more than he is yet capable of comprehending. She lures, she guides, shebids him burst his fetters. And if he can match her import, the two, the knowerand the known, will be released from every limitation.

Now gold is the in-corruptible metal, thesphere is the perfect sphere, and the circle is her soul.

She has lost her soul. This is depression. This is loss ofenergy and joy in life. Some-thing has slipped out. It is the counterpart ofHelen of Troy being stolen in the classic story of the Iliad: Helen of Troy wasstolen, so they want to get her back.So, the little golden ball has dropped, her soul has been swallowed by the wolfof the underworld. Now, when the energy goes down like that, the power that’s atthe bottom of the pool, the inhabitant of the under-world, comes up—a dragon, orin this case, a little frog. He says “What’s the matter, Little Girl?” And shetells him, “I’ve lost my golden ball.” And he says, “I’ll get it for you.” Andshe says, “That would be very nice.” And he says, “What will you give me?”Now, she has to give up something, there has to be some kind of exchange, so shesays, “I will give you my golden crown.” He says, “I do not want your goldencrown.” “I’ll give you my pretty silk dress.” “I don’t want your pretty silkdress.” “Well,” she demands, “what do you want?” “I want to eat with you at thetable, be with you as your playmate, sleep with you in your bed.” So,underestimating the frog, she says, “Okay, I’ll do that.”The frog dives down and brings up the ball. Now he is the hero who is on theadventure. She, without so much as a thank you, takes the ball and goes trottinghome, and he comes flopping after her, saying, “Wait for me.” He’s very slow.She gets home, and that evening, when the little princess and King Daddy andQueen Mother are having dinner, doing very nicely with their meal, this greencreature comes flopping up the front steps: plomp, plomp, plomp. The girl goes abit pale, and her father asks, “So, what’s the matter? What’s that?” And shesays, “Oh, just a little frog I met.” And he says, “Did you make any promises?”Now there’s the moral principle coming in; you have to correlate all thesethings. So, when she answers, “Yes,” the king says, “Well, then, open the doorand let him in.” So, in comes the frog, and he’s down on the floor, and then hesays, “I want to be on the table. I want to eat off of your golden plate.” Well,that spoils dinner. The dinner is finished, and she goes up to bed. He comesflopping up the stairs after her and bangs against the door, saying, “I want tocome in.” So she opens the door and lets him in. “I want to sleep in your bedwith you.” Well, that is more than she can take.There are several ways of ending this part of the story, but the one I like bestis where she just picks up the frog and throws him against the wall. The frogcracks open, and out steps this beautiful prince, with eyelashes like a camel.It seems he had also been in trouble: he had been cursed by a hag into thecondition of a frog. Now that’s the little boy who hasn’t dared to move on intoadulthood. She is the little girl who is at the brink of adulthood. Both of themare refusing it, but each now helps the other out of this dilemma, and it’s abeautiful, beautiful experience.Then, the story says, the next morning, after they had been married, a coachcomes to the front door. It was his coach. He was a prince, after all, whosekingdom had been in desolation since his transformation into a frog. So he andhis bride get into the coach, and as they are driving away, they hear a loudsound: Bang! He says to the coachman, “What’s the matter, Henry? What’shappened?” And Henry says, “Well, ever since you have been gone, my Prince,there have been four bands of iron around my heart. One of them has now broken.”As they ride further, there are three more “Bangs,” and then the heart of thecoachman beats properly once again.The coachman is symbolic of the land that requires the prince as its generatingand governing power. He’d failed in his duty and gone down into the underworld,but down in the underworld, he found his little bride.I like that story particularly, because both of them are in trouble, both are atthe bottom of the pond, and each rescues the other in this funny way. Meanwhile,the world up there has been waiting for its prince to return. So that is oneexample of the hero journey."},{"pageContent":"THE question that comes—always, always, always—is: “What about the woman’sjourney?” The woman’s life, if she is following the biologically grounded norm,is that of life in the world, in one relationship or another to a family. Thenwhen the retirement time comes, the normal passage is into the stage which canbe pictured as the Grandmother, of giving advice to the new life coming along.One can be in a position of being a grandmother to the grandchildren of theworld. One is in a role, then, of mature, life-fostering advice. The womanbrings forth life in one way or another, either biologically or socially, andthen, in the latter stage, is life-fostering and life-guiding. The man is moreinward than the woman in that last stage.The relationship of age to childhood, it seems to me, is a very sweet thing.There is a sweet, amusing picture of Ida Rolf and a little child looking at eachother, west to east, across the distance of life: the whole, historicallyconditioned stage between is missing, and there’s just one eternity looking atthe other. If you can be in some kind of social relationship that enables thatprinciple of the eternal experience to look at the eternal innocence and fosterit, that is really archetypal.In cases throughout history, however, where there have been inadequate responsesto what the woman is doing—that is to say, she is doing what nature and societyexpect, but it’s an arid and bad situation—this is what I would term a “call toadventure.” And if a woman engages in the man’s task of entering the field ofachievement, then her mythology will be essentially the same as that of the malehero.The heroine will, of course, encounter difficulties and advantages which are notthose that the male meets, but whether one is male or female, the stages of theinner journey, the visionary quest, are the same, even though the imagery isgoing to be a little different. For instance, the central image in a man’smandala is often some radiant jewel, or gem, or something like that, but thecentral image for a woman might be of her holding a child in her arms, the childof her spiritual birth, since the imagery of biological commitment is translatedeven to the spiritual forms.My wife, who is anything but the housewife, has no trouble in seeing the malehero as the counterpart of the female hero, if the woman is engaged in the kindof task that has traditionally been seen as a male task; that is to say, if sheis engaged in achieving something, rather than waiting in solitude to beachieved, which is the woman’s normal role. Jean is an artist, richly fulfilledin an active role, and her crises are essentially the same as a male’s crises.The women we know with whom she has worked are also not typical housewives. Theyhave achieved fulfillment in the realm of the arts, which is the only place Iknow of—except, perhaps, for academe—where women can have this unconventionalway of life. In my own work, I have known a lot of women in the world of “thehead trip,” but they never seemed to me to be as richly fulfilled as the onesthat went into the arts. Their fulfillment was more in the way of achievement,whereas the artists’ fulfillment was in doing what the artist does, and that isa different thing."},{"pageContent":"In all of literature there is very little of the woman’s adventure because sheis already “It,” and her problem is the realization of that. There are quite afew adventures of little girls in Grimm’s Fairy Tales, and most of them have todo with the hesitation before moving into the threshold of acceptingwomanhood—the sleeping princess, and all that sort of thing, and then thewaking. When women dream, often their active aspect appears in male form.What the male represents is the agent of the femi-nine power directed to aspecific kind of functioning. In the male body, however, there’s not the recallto female nature that there is automatically in the female body. Consequently, amale going forth and finding the place of, the instrument of, his full powerwould not have the problem of discovering the feminine factor in himself, for itis quite slight compared with the feminine factor in the female body. It is agreater distance from what the body has given you. It’s a matter of proportion. A man must do.He must disengage from the motherand find his way of “doing,”which is a way of pain.A woman has only to be. In my twenties, I lived with artists, many of them women. I noticed that whenthey approached the age of thirty, the marriage problem came up with each one.“I have to get married now and have a child.” When the female within calls thesculptress who has found her instruments of power, the mallet and chisel, herart falls apart, because she can’t carry a serious art career unless she is atit, and nothing else, all day long.This wreckage doesn’t happen with men. When the female calls the male, all hedoes is go and get married, because the female is out there, where she naturallyis. I would say that this is one of the points in the female journey: there is aheavier load of given nature to deal with. It starts with the girl beingovertaken by the menstrual moment, and then she’s a woman.That much of a summons to life is the problem that you ladies have that we mendon’t. Your whole body tells you that you have disowned it. A man does not havethat problem. A woman can follow the hero’s journey, but there will be othercalls and another relationship that’s asked of her, namely, to the nature fieldof which she is the manifestation.It took me a long time to get around to marriage, principally because I feltthat women always wanted to have fun, and that was not my interest at all. Itwould interfere with my reading. That’s really the truth. But another reason wasthat every time I would get really involved with a woman, I’d have the feelingof weight: life was heavy. And pretty soon I’d just get fed up with thatheaviness, with that feeling of everything being so goddamn important and allthese little bits of things becoming mountainous problems, and—Jesus!: “I’mout.” And then, a little while later, here it is again."},{"pageContent":"I have taught hundreds of young women, many of whom have gone into the arts, asdid Jean, who went into classic dance. But many of the others had husbands whowould not stand for that. Each of these women had to make a choice, and if shechose to knuckle down to what her husband wanted, that ended her adventure. Itreally did. Everything else then became a substitute. But the objective is tohave your own adventure, not a substitute, and it is not by any means an easything to do.When I was teaching these young women, I wasn’t thinking of turning them intophilologists or historians. So what was I giving them this stuff for? Most weregoing to get married, have children, and give them-selves to dailychores—comparable to my daily chore of teaching them, which, after the firstexcitement, was no fun either. But there are many ways of using the material,and my thought was this: they will have their families, and then, when they arefifty and their families have been launched, there they’ll be. And it was myintention to give them this spiritual message of how to read the world in thesecond half of life’s journey. That was a long time ago. I still know many ofthese women—twenty, thirty, or forty years later—and I hear unanimously, that myapproach worked, that I gave them something that is now feeding this aspect oftheir lives.It’s interesting that in traditions like the Japanese or the old Oriental, andthis goes all the way back to Greece in Plato’s time, the housewife was one kindof woman, and the courtesan was another. The courtesan was the woman proficientin the arts, in literature, and in talk. It was a different type of human lifefrom that of the housewife, and in those traditions, the woman was fulfilled inthat role.Then there’s another woman’s role in literature, but one I have never seen, thatof the woman who appears as an Amazon. There is one such story about thedaughter of the King of France, who’s been kidnapped by the Muslims. After sheand a Muslim fall infinitely in love, she is rescued by her family and broughtback from Islam. Her Muslim lover follows, recaptures her, and now, as they arerunning to escape from this military group of brothers who are trying to takeher back, she says to him, “How good are you with your sword?” He says, “Nogood. I’m just good in bed.” “Well,” she replies, “you go on then, and I willtake care of this bunch.” It is a wonderful story, one of the best in the world,and it’s worth looking for in the Arabian Nights.Joyce speaks of the woman as the one who is the link between: between nations,between people. The ability women have to marry men of totally alien culturesand find themselves at home with them is more than what happens when men marrywomen of alien cultures. Woman is the link between. Another thing that Joycebrings out in Finnegans Wake: a woman has three or four sons: one is a greatson, another is a poor son. She loves them all. She is not evaluating in termsof achievements or anything of the kind. She represents a human-to-humanrelationship. Where male power dominates,you have separation.Where female power dominates,there’s a non-dual, embracing quality. Having taught young women, I’ve been amazed to see how competent they are inunderstanding their hus-band’s job, if they are in a marriage that’s reallygoing. She never studied that stuff, but she’s right in there with him, becauseany failure on the part of either member ruins the duad. In my own case,everything that I write I read to Jean, who gives me the criticism and supportthat my work requires. The man might feel sometimes as though he does not needcooperation, but he does. There is a big difference between a man operating witha woman behind him and one out there alone.When we were first married, and I was driving the car, it didn’t matter what thehell I did, Jean went along with it. Then there came a time when I realizedthere would been a psychological transformation, that some-times she wascritical of the way my driving was done. There then came a stage where she wasdirecting, And all of that was acceptable: it had to do with changes in herthinking. First, she thought, “Anything he does is great.” Then, when she hadlearned a little more about me, her uncritical acceptance went away. Finally,after she had learned still more about me—and it always goes like this—now, sheis the boss. I know the feeling of turning a car over to someone and just havingto say, “If we run into something, that’s okay. Here we go, Dear.” And you findthat she manages very well. It’s different, that’s all. It is the Perilous Bed. A knight, in full armor,approaches the Perilous Bed.Whenever he tries to settle into it,the bed jumps and bucks and moves. The Perilous Bed representsthe female temperament. If the male can just hold on,if he can endure,the bed will settle down,and he’ll get the reward. Some time ago, I had a sabbatical and spent the whole year traveling, mostly inIndia and Japan, but I was also in Thailand, Ceylon, Burma, and Taiwan. Myimpression was that, in anything, the women in these cultures were morecompetent than the men. Perhaps I had to go abroad to see something that is alsoa fact back here, but I was tremendously impressed by the vigor and authority ofOriental women.I was a long time in India, and since I had already published the Zimmer books,I saw every department of India that one could ask to see, including the houseof Nehru. His younger sister took me as her person-to-go-to-parties-with, so Imet the whole bunch. Indian women look so darned humble with their saris andall, but they are nothing of the kind. They are potent. In Japan, however, it isa different situation, because those men are really strong men. But when you seea Japanese couple in a restaurant, who pays the check? The woman. She has themoney."},{"pageContent":"The principle characterization of Athene is as the guardian of heroes, as apatroness, like Lakṣmī, the Indian goddess who isthe supporter of the king or ofanybody who then becomes her hero. We find Athene depicted in art as theprotector of heroes: she is there when Perseus takes the head of Medusa, and sheis the one who initiates the young man into his heroic career. In the Odyssey,she tells Telemachus to go find his father. She is present when Odysseus landson the island of Scherie and meets the Phaeacian princess Nausicaa, and she isagain present at the meeting of father and son. So, we can think of her as theguardian of heroes.Athene is also the protectress of the Acropolis, the fortress of the city.Athene relates to the father, not to the mother. Her mother was Metis, but whenMetis was pregnant, Zeus swallowed her, so she gave birth to her child in Zeus’belly, and Athene emerged from his head. That’s what Freud calls a transfer toabove—the birthplace of the male creation—and she comes forth from there. Insocieties with such traditions, as I see it, the mother is the mother of ournature. The child is born of the mother and is the little nature object. Thefather is the parent of one’s social maturity. Hence, in the boy’s initiation,he goes from the mother to the men’s camp, and they initiate him. Father is the separator.Mother brings together. Hera is the consort of Zeus, who represents royal rule, the justice that governsthe world, so she is matron of the household. This role is different from thatof Athene, patron of the heroic adventure. In the contrast between seductressand wife, Hera is the wife, and the seductress role goes to Aphrodite.Aphrodite, however, is more than just the seductress. She is the goddess of alllove, a tremendously powerful figure, for love can overtake a person asseductress, but it is also the supporting love of life.The Ouranian Venus is the one who gives the inspiration of the muses that is theinspiration of the spirit. She feeds not only the body but the spirit as well.The way she pours life into the world shows that this one life is the one truthof all things. That’s why I think that the woman as artist is in a field whichfurnishes not only physical life but spiritual life as well—the spiritual lifeat once the revealing power.I have noticed that the way women look at children is different from the way mendo. There are two ways of looking at a little kid in an airplane toddling up anddown the aisle: one is the way the woman looks at the child; the other is theway the man does. That’s why I say that the prime female power and virtue iscompassion: the lack of egoistic isolation , the opening to participation. Evenin sex, the man is aggressive, but the woman opens. The opening to thatubiquitous presence which is the ground of us all is compassion. Recognizingthat spontaneous feeling, embracing it, and manifesting it in action is thefemale power."},{"pageContent":"In my book The Mythic Image, I have a wonderful story about Kuan-yin, one of thepersonifications of the great Mahāyāna Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, theembodiment of compassion.121 [part0105.html#footnote121]It seems that Kuan-yin realized that in a certain part of China, out in therural areas, nobody had ever heard of enlightenment. They were all interested inhorse racing and all this macho stuff. So she turns herself into a gloriouslybeautiful girl, comes into town with fresh fish from the river to sell, and whenher basket is empty, she disappears. Early the next day, this beautifulfish-selling girl is there again, and then once again she disappears. This dailypattern continues, and soon all of the men have become enchanted by her.One morning, when she appears, about ten or twenty of them surround her and say,“You have to marry one of us.” “Well,” she says, “I cannot marry twenty men, buttomorrow morning, if one of you can recite by heart the Sūtra of theCompassionate Kuan-yin, I will marry that man.” The next morning, a dozen menknow the entire sūtra by heart, so she says, “Well, I cannot marry all of you,but I will marry the one who can interpret this sūtra to me tomorrow.”The next day, there are four men who can interpret the sūtra, so now she says,“I am only one woman, and I can’t marry four men, but if one of you hasexperienced the meaning of this sūtra three days from now, then I will marrythat man.”Three days later, there is but one man waiting for her. Now she says, “My littlehouse is down by the bend in the river. Come there this evening, and you will bemy husband.”So that evening, he goes to where the shore bends and comes to a little house.An old couple is standing outside, and the old man says, “Oh, we’ve been waitinga long, long time for you. Our daughter is inside.” But when he goes into theroom, it’s empty. She isn’t there. So he looks out the window and seesfootprints, which he follows down to the river, where he finds a little pairshoes at the water’s edge, but no girl.Then, as he’s standing there, with the reeds blowing and so forth, he realizesthat all the reeds and everything else is she. Through her allure and charm,which is what the female figures represent in these Mahāyāna images, he realizesthe nirvāṇic grace of beauty in the universe. Having understood the sūtra, heknew what he was experiencing, and he received illumination.Dante realized something of this kind at the end of The Divine Comedy. He hadfollowed the allure of Beatrice, who had guided him through the heavens to thevery throne of God, and when he got there, she was there, together with theTrinity and the angelic forms. Behind the three persons of the Trinity, he sawthree circles of flame and light, which represented the non-personal aspect ofthe god. He said that he was wondering how the personified forms andnon-personified illumination could be the same, when suddenly he under-stoodthat the whole world was of the love and grace of God: the love he’d firstexperienced in Beatrice. When it’s all love,all must be love.Nothing must interfere:love conquers all.[Discuss] [http://www.jcf.org/new/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4724&CompMyth]"},{"pageContent":"LIVING IN THE SACRED"},{"pageContent":"NOW the Indian term for “illusion,” māyā—from the verbal root mā, “to measure,to measure out, to form, to create, construct, exhibit or display”—refers toboth the power that creates an illusion and the false display itself. The art ofa magician, for example, is māyā; so too the illusion he creates. The arts ofthe military strategist, the me-chant, actor, and thief: these also are māyā.Māyā is experienced as fascination, charm; specifically, feminine charm. And tothis point there is a Buddhist saying: “Of all the forms of māyā that of womanis supreme.” 122 [part0105.html#footnote122] Let’s say we have the world of that which is no world: the Garden of Eden beforethe world of duality, the transcendent mystery. Then we have the world ofthings: the world of duality and multiplicity, of māyā, where we’ve lostconnection with the transcendence. Māyā is that powerwhich converts transcendenceinto the world. As a cosmogenic principle—and as a feminine, personal principle, also—māyā issaid to possess three powers: 1. A Veiling Power that hides or conceals the “real,” the inward essential character of things; so that, as we read in a sacred Sanskrit text: “Though it is hidden in all things, the Self shines not forth.”123 [part0105.html#footnote123] The first stage, the veil, manifests from the fact that you don’t see the white light. This is what is called the māyā veil. The image that’s given is of white light broken into the colors of the rainbow by a prism. This prism is the Goddess. With the veiling power, the obscuring power, the white light can’t get through. 2. A Projecting Power, which then sends forth illusionary impressions and ideas, together with associated desires and aversions—as might happen, for example if at night one should mistake a rope for a snake and experience fright. Ignorance (the Veiling Power), having concealed the real, imagination (the Projecting Power) evolves phenomena. And so we read: “This power of projection creates all appearances, whether of gods or of the cosmos.”124 [part0105.html#footnote124] With the projecting power, the forms of the world come through. The prism is the veil, but it is also the projector: what stops the white light and what projects the colors of the rainbow. In this second stage, the white light shows through the forms of the world. If you put a number of colors on a disk and spin it, you’ll get a white spinning disk—that’s the revealing power. These first two powers, concealing and projecting, can be compared to those properties of a prism by which sunlight is transformed into the colors of the rainbow. Arrange these seven colors on a disk, spin it, and they will be seen as white. So too, when viewed a certain way, the phenomena themselves may reveal what normally they veil; which demonstrates: 3. The Revealing Power of māyā, which it is the function of art and scripture, ritual and meditation: to make known.125 [part0105.html#footnote125] It is the function of art to servethe revealing power of māyā.The old voice of the ocean, the bird-chatter of little rivers,(Winter has given them gold for silverTo stain their water and bladed green for brown to line their banks)From different throats intone one language.So I believe if we were strong enough to listen withoutDivisions of desire and terrorTo the storm of the sick nations, the rage of the hunger- smitten cities,Those voices also would be foundClean as a child’s; or like some girl’s breathing who dances aloneBy the ocean-shore, dreaming of lovers.—Robinson Jeffers126 [part0105.html#footnote126]Fear and desireare the problem of the artist also. We need more poetry that revealswhat the heart is ready to recognize. …the first function of art is exactly that which I have already named as thefirst function of mythology; to transport the mind in experience past theguardians—desire and fear—of the paradisal gate to the tree within ofilluminated life. In the words of the poet Blake, in The Marriage of Heaven andHell, “If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to manas it is, infinite.”127 [part0105.html#footnote127] But the cleansing of thedoors, the wiping away of the guardians, those cherubim with their flamingsword, is the first effect of art, where the second, simultaneously, is therapture of recognizing in a single hair “a thousand golden lions.”128[part0105.html#footnote128] “Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptibleeon of the gods.”129 [part0105.html#footnote129] That is James Joyce. Thestatement is quoted in Ulysses by Buck Mulligan. The situation is that LeopoldBloom, thinking of his home problem, is looking intently at a red triangle onthe label of a bottle of Bass ale. When someone starts to disturb Bloom,Mulligan stops him, saying, “…preserve a druid silence. His soul is far away. Itis as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. Any object,intensely regarded, may be a gate of access…,” and so on.Take, for example, a pencil, ashtray, anything, and holding it before you inboth hands, regard it for a while. Forgetting its use and name, yet continuingto regard it, ask yourself seriously, “What is it?”…Cut off from use, relievedof nomenclature, its dimension of wonder opens; for the mystery of the being ofthat thing is identical with the mystery of the being of the universe—and ofyourself. 130 [part0105.html#footnote130]Art is the transforming experience. The revelation of art is not ethics, nor a judgment, nor even of humanity as onegenerally thinks of it. Rather, the revelation is a marveling recognition of theradiant Form of forms that shines through all things.In the simplest terms, I think we might say that when a situation or phenomenonevokes in us a sense of existence (instead of some reference to the possibilityof an assurance of meaning) we have had an experience of this kind. The sense ofexistence evoked may be shallow or profound, more or less intense, according toour capacity or readiness; but even a brief shock (say, for example, whendiscovering the moon over city roofs or hearing a sharp bird cry at night) canyield an experience of the order of no-mind: that is to say, the poetical order,the order of art. When this occurs, our own reality-beyond-meaning is awakened(or perhaps better: we are awakened to our own reality-beyond-meaning), and weexperience an affect that is neither thought nor feeling but an interior impact.The phenomenon, disengaged from cosmic references, has disengaged ourselves, bythat principle, well known to magic, by which like conjures like. In fact, boththe magic of art and the art of magic derive from and are addressed toexperiences of this order. Hence the power of the meaningless syllables, themumbo jumbo of magic, and the meaningless verbalizations of metaphysics, lyricpoetry, and art interpretation. They function evocatively, not referentially;like the beat of a shaman’s drum, not like a formula of Einstein. One momentlater, and we have classified the experience and may be having utterablethoughts and describable feelings about it—thoughts and feelings that are in thepublic domain, and they will be either sentimental or profound, according to oureduca-tion. But according to our life, we have had, for an instant, a sense ofexistence: a moment of unevaluated, unimpeded, lyric life—antecedent to boththought and feeling; such as can never be communicated by means of empiricallyverifiable propositions, but only suggested by art.131[part0105.html#footnote131] The goal of life is rapture.Art is the way we experience it."},{"pageContent":"I will give you what seems to me to be the most clear and certain exposition ofbasic esthetic theory I know, namely, that of James Joyce in A Portrait of theArtist as a Young Man .Joyce makes a distinction between what he calls “proper art” and “improper art.”By “proper art” he means that which really belongs to art. “Improper art,” bycontrast, is art that’s in the service of something that is not art: forinstance, art in the service of advertising. Further, referring to the attitudeof the observer, Joyce says that proper art is static, and thereby inducesesthetic arrest, whereas improper art is kinetic, filled with movement: meaning,it moves you to desire or to fear and loathing.Art that excites desire for the object as a tangible object he callspornographic. Art that excites loathing or fear for the object he termsdidactic. All sociological art is didactic. Most novels since Zola’s time havebeen the work of didactic pornographers, who are preaching a social doctrine ofsome kind and fancying it up with pornographic icing.Say you are leafing through a magazine and see an advertisement for a beautifulrefrigerator. There’s a girl with lovely refrigerating teeth smiling beside it,and you say, “I’d love to have a refrigerator like that.” That ad ispornography. By definition, all advertising art is pornographic art. Or supposeyou see a photograph of a dear old lady, and you think, “I’d love to have teawith that dear old soul.” That photograph is pornography. Or you go into a skibuff’s house, where there’s a paint-ing of a mountain slope, and you think, “Oh,to go down that mountain slope…” That painting is pornography: your relationshipto it is not purely esthetic: just perceiving the thing. Most of the art thatone sees is either didactic or pornographic.For help with proper art, Joyce goes to Aquinas.He says, and he uses the Latin words, that the esthetic object renders threemoments: integritas, “wholeness”; consonantia, “harmony”; and claritas,“radiance.”Say that you have several objects on a table. Put a frame around any portion ofthis situation, and what is within that frame is now to be regarded not as anas-sortment of separate objects but as something else: a single entity, awholeness: integritas.The late Buckminster Fuller has left with us a definition of this way of seeingand appreciating…:“In order to be able to understand the great complexity of life and tounderstand what the universe is doing, the first word to learn is synergy.Synergy is the behavior of whole systems, unpredicted by the behavior of theirparts. The most extraordinary example of it is what we call mass attraction. Onegreat massive sphere and another massive sphere hung by tension members areattracted to one another. We find there is nothing in one sphere in its ownright, that predicts that it’s going to be attracted to another. You have tohave the two. It is, then, synergy which holds our earth together with the moon;and it is synergy which holds our whole universe together.…Synergy is to energyas integration is to differentiation.”132 [part0105.html#footnote132]The Buddhist doctrine of “dependent origination, or mutual arising” (pratityasamutpada) corresponds to this of Fuller’s “synergy.” When, on the occasion ofthe Buddha’s silent flower sermon (which is regarded traditionally as thefounding sermon of Zen), he simply held out to his congregation a single flower,the only one who understood was his foremost disciple, Mahakashyapa, who quietlysmiled at him in recognition.133 [part0105.html#footnote133] In the symbol,which is almost universal in the Orient, of the universe as a lotus and thelotus as manifest sign on the surface of the waters of an invisible life belowwaves, the Buddhist doctrine is already implicit of pratītya-samutpāda,“dependent origination, or mutual arising”; for the petals are not to beinterpreted as in any way independent of each other, casual or consequential ofeach other. The whole system has simply arisen, “thus come” (tathāgata), likethe Buddha himself.134 [part0105.html#footnote134] Now, when you have integritas, wholeness inside such a frame, the only thingthat counts is the harmonious placement of everything, the consonantia , whatJoyce calls the “rhythm of beauty,”135 [part0105.html#footnote135] whichincludes the relationship of colors to each other, of masses to each other, andof the spaces in between. All elements are part of this harmonious rhythm. Whenthe rhythm is fortunately achieved, one experiences the claritas, or radiance:one sees that the aesthetic object is itself and no other thing, and one is heldin esthetic arrest. ”The mind,” [Joyce] writes, “is arrested and raised above desire andloathing.”136 [part0105.html#footnote136] The original, biological function ofthe eye, to seek out and identify things to eat and to alert the mind to danger,is for a moment, or (in the case of a true artist) for a lifetime suspended, andthe world (beheld without judgment of its relevance to the well-being of theobserver) is recognized as a revelation sufficient in itself.137[part0105.html#footnote137] In other words, the frame is a border hermetically sealing-off the object, sothat all you are experiencing, all that matters, is within that border. It’s asacred field, and you become pure subject for a pure object. You no longer haveto know what these things are named or what can be done with them. This is thea-b-c of esthetics. Next comes the d-e-f."},{"pageContent":"The mystery of art is why one rhythm fixes you in esthetic arrest and anotherdoesn’t. Music is nothing if not rhythm. Rhythm is the instrument of art. Musicis the organization, not only of rhythm, but of scale and of the notes playedagainst each other: quarter notes, half notes, and so forth. If you are playinga C-Major chord and move to a dominant Seventh, that’s an organization of therelationship of one note to another. It is really space.It’s wonderful to see a jazz group improvise: when five or six musicians arereally tuned in to each other, it’s all the same rhythm, and they can’t gowrong, even though they never did it that way before.The Pygmy people have little pipes that each sound one note, and a bunch of themsit around, each piping one note, and when they get going, something darlingcomes out: like birds, like forest noises.Indian music never has a beginning and never has an end. The music represents aplane of consciousness and is going on all the time. When you go to a concert,it’s the strangest event. They’re fooling around with the instruments, tuningand zinging them, and this may go on for a half hour. Then presently they’replaying. It is as though the music were going on continuously, and the musicianssimply dip down, pick it up, play with it for a while, and then leave it. It isaltogether different from western music: there is not only no tension orrelease, but no beginning and no end. It’s always there.There’s a relationship between musical organization and architecturalorganization. All architecture is an organization in space. It happens to have afunction that is also related to space. The Century Club in New York was builtby Sanford White, an important architect, around the end of the nineteenthcentury. The building is an historical monument. The lounge floor is veryharmonizing: a room so proportioned that it puts you at peace. But why thishappens is mysterious.The only answer I can think of is Cezanne’s: “Art is a harmony parallel tonature.” There are, of course, two natures involved: Nature, the world outthere, and the world of nature within. That is to say, when it is the artist’sintention is to arrange “a harmony parallel to nature”—and any other intentionprobably involves didactics or pornography—then that harmony resonates withsomething inside you, fixes you in esthetic arrest, and you have that big“a-ha!” experience. So it is the function of art to open the consumable thingsof the tangible, visible world, so that the radiance—the same radiance that’swithin you—shines through them.I think one feels this harmony most powerfully in Japan, where your own natureis constantly invoked, and you don’t know where Nature ends and art begins. Whena garden is constructed, the man who composes it tells his son when to bend eachbranch: “When it grows out to here, bend it”—so that it looks like Nature. It isart: Nature that has been harmonized with the nature within. That harmony is thefirst stage of this rhythm. This is basic. Abstract art, any kind of art, has tobe thought of in terms of this rhythm. Choosing what verse form you are going touse in poetry in relation to what it is you are going to say, the echoing of oneconsonant against another: it is all rhythm, to be conceived of in terms ofsensuous rhythmic effects that touch you. Certain rhythms render certainresponses.And the two kinetic movements that block this harmonious rhythm are exactly thetwo temptations of the Buddha: desire, which draws you to possess the object,and loathing or fear, which turns you away from it. When you move to possess orto turn away from an object, you are reacting to the world of delusory appealsand terrors that māyā has projected. And esthetic arrest, the condition of theheart or spirit or whatever not being moved by desire or fear, is precisely thecounter-part of the experience of the Buddha under the tree of the immovablespot. It is the immovable spot. It is a psychological stasis with respect toyour relationships to the forms of the world around you.The biological urges to enjoy and to master (with their opposites, to loathe andto fear), as well as the social urge to evaluate (as good or evil, true orfalse), simply drop away, and a rapture in sheer experience supervenes, in whichself-loss and elevation are the same. Such an impact is “beyond words;” for itis not such as can be explained by a reference to anything else. The mind isreleased—for a moment, for a day, or per-haps forever—from those anxieties toenjoy, to win, or to be correct which spring from the net of nerves in which menare entangled. Ego dissolved, there is nothing in the net but life—which iseverywhere and forever. The Zen masters of China and Japan have called thisstate the state of “no-mind.” The classical Indian terms are mokṣa, “release,”bodhi, “enlightenment,” and nirvāṇa, “transcendence of the winds of passion.”Joyce speaks of “the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure,”138[part0105.html#footnote138] when the clear radiance of the esthetic image isapprehended by the mind, which has been arrested by its wholeness and fascinatedby its harmony. “The mind,” he says, “in that mysterious instant Shelley likenedbeautifully to a fading coal.”139 [part0105.html#footnote139]So the esthetic vehicle, the instrument of the rhythm of beauty that inducesesthetic arrest, is the revealing power of māyā."},{"pageContent":"One application of the artist’s craft is in doing something like making a turkeydinner, another is in creating art that is of no use whatsoever exceptesthetically. When I use the word “art,” it has to do with “divinely superfluousbeauty” and esthetic arrest. There’s no esthetic arrest in eating a turkey.That’s life in action, doing what it has to do, namely eating some-thing that’sbeen killed, putting it into your system. It’s totally different from estheticarrest and recognizing the radiance. Are you going to look at the object or eatit? Eating the object is related to desire and loathing.The distinction between the two has to do with whether it is the projectingpower of māyā or the revealing power that is present when you look at theobject. It’s very important to make a clear distinction between the two. Ifyou’re concerned with prospering or failing with the object, eating or noteating it, your perspective involves desire and loathing, the temptations of theBuddha, the projecting power of māyā.This bringing together of Joyce’s esthetic theory with the māyā idea was awonderful illumination for me. I just woke up this morning and said, ”My god, Ihave finally got it after eighty years.” I have known the implications ofesthetic arrest, but I’d never linked it up to the māyā idea. It is your mentalattitude that determines whether you experience the projecting or the revealingpower. The world is there in both modes. It is not that the world changes, it’syour consciousness.Esthetic arrest is the result of this change of focus. “The Kingdom of theFather is spread upon the earth and men do not see it.” You see it in estheticarrest. But to develop the inward depth experienced through this change offocus, those who seek to achieve fully the goal of life should set aside asacred space. The sacred space, when you think of where it appears intraditional cultures, is for initiations and meditations. If you are sofulfilled already that no further initiations are necessary, then you can dowithout such a space. But, insofar as you’ve not struck the ultimate depth andare interested in enriching and building the interior, in addition to theexternal aspects of your life, then you have to have some place, some way, topractice this.All the world will open up when you’ve achieved this inner depth, and your playin life will be informed by this radiance. The Grail Castle is in the field thatis adventured in the way of experiencing esthetic arrest. The Grail is the senseof total rapture and spiritual fulfillment that comes from your experience ofthis hermetically sealed field. It is like probing for oil: you put a pipe down,strike oil, and then realize the oil is under everything. But you first have togo down somewhere to find it, and this is the field of this plunge.I think if you imagine yourself taking the position of esthetic stasis, you’llunderstand about withdrawing fear and desire for what happens, and about samsarabeing nirvāṇa, the still point in the midst of the turning world. That’s allthere is to it. Then the world becomes a display of things from which you aredisengaged, and yet, voluntarily, you can become engaged: “joyous participationin the sorrows of the world.” It is very different from being compulsivelylinked.The change of consciousness from stasis to kinesis is the Fall in the Garden.The bondages from which the Buddha disengaged—desire, fear, and social duty—aretemporal matters. You can engage in them voluntarily, but compulsive engagementis linked to māyā. If you have gotten that, you have gotten all I can give you.Now Ramakrishna, speaking of brahman and Sakti—or Devi, the Goddess—says thatbrahman is the still point, the milky ocean experienced as stillness; Sakti isthe movement, the joy and the pain; and the two together are one. That’s theidea of the Yab-Yum. One thing after another was coming together last night interms of this simple analysis that Joyce has given us.Then, in Joyce’s analysis, we have the emotions of pity and terror. Now, terroris not the same as fear and loathing. It is the realization of both thetranscendent operating principle and the effect of the passage of time: thesorrows of the world. It’s static, a still terror, not the terror of flight. Itis the realization of compassion: identification with the human sufferer: notthe poor sufferer, the black sufferer, the Communist or Fascist sufferer, butthe human sufferer—which eliminates the sociological didactic. You identify with”the suffering servant,” you might say, and the terror goes past all movement tothe still point of Goethe’s “schaudern”: the shudder of realization of the merephenomenalityof the world. That’s the whole story.One might add that, in the way of either lust or love, the female enables themale to make the transit: the seductress lures him to the world, and thevirgin—the Virgin Birth mother, Mary—introduces him to the transcendent, theChrist principle that transcends individualism. It seems to me that everythingfalls right in-to place with this very simple realization.My life has been one job, one wife, one image: the Grail. This is known asconservatism. There is a won-derful line in the Portrait, where Stephen’sfriend, who’s been hearing all this heretical stuff, asks if he intends tobecome a Protestant. “I said that I had lost the faith,” Stephen replies, “butnot that I had lost my self-respect. What kind of liberation would that be toforsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to embrace one which isillogical and incoherent?”140 [part0105.html#footnote140]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Buddhist art before the first century was mostly narrative: the life of theBuddha and similar discursive art, although the Buddha himself was neverdepicted. However, with the Mahayana realization that samsara is nirvāṇa and allthings are Buddha things, the earliest Buddha images, and other images, began toappear—all presented as revelatory of that realization—and the art object itselfbecame a revelation of Buddha consciousness. It became transparent to theradiance, claritas,. which is what we have been talking about.In Christian art, by contrast, I don’t think you have that concept, because inthe orthodoxy tangible things are not regarded as being informed by the Christ.It is only in the Thomas Gospel that we read, “Split the stick, there am I. Liftthe stone. I am there.” And so, in the Christian tradition, one finds onlyanecdotal. art. The Crucifixion is an anecdote of Jesus’s suffering on thecross. It’s not a revelation. It doesn’t induce esthetic arrest. It’s didactic.Early Christian art was meant to be didactic, because nobody could read. In theGothic period, the story of Christ and his apostles and disciples was renderedas when you go to Chartres Cathedral.I’ve been there five times. Once I used a guidebook to identify every figure inevery window. They are all references to anecdotes of the Christiian tradition,and I could get the whole of the Christian doctrine there. The Rose Window,however, does reveal the radiance. It is magnificent art. Looking at it, oneexperiences esthetic arest. And the cathedral itself is an art object. …within the field of a mythology, the symbolic details reflect, indeed, a localmaterial history and environment, yet they are of an order of the mind, and tobe interpreted by the faculty of reason as expressions of a spiritualinsight.…The idea of a temple (or European cathedral) is what is here announced,an enclosure wherein every feature is meta-phorical of a connoted metaphysicalintuition, set apart for ritual enactments.The heart in such an environment is at home, as it were, in its own place:removed from the chaotic spectacle of the world of waking consciousness, at restand at peace in the recognition of a harmony (which is of one’s own nature)informing the whole terrible scene of lives forever consuming lives. And thefunction, then, of the ritual is to bring one’s manner of life into accord withthis non-judgmental perspective in the way, not of crude ego-maintenance in aworld one never made, but of synergetic participation in a phantasmagoricrapture.141 [part0105.html#footnote141] The town of Chartres lives around that cathedral, just as ancient temple citiesused to be centered around the temple, which represented the spiritualinformation the entire city lived by. We have nothing comparable.I had the most marvelous experience at Chartres. I had been there for severaldays going through all of this, and the concierge came to me and asked if I’dlike to help him ring the noontime bell. Well, you bet. So we went up the northfleche to where there is a great big bell. The bell is down below you, and thereis a seesaw-like thing above it with a little railing across. He stood on oneside, I stood on the other, and we hung onto the bar between us. He gave a push,this thing started to move, and our hair was blowing, and then, underneath us:“Bong! Bong!” We were on that damned thing four or five minutes. It wastremendous. Then he brought me down and showed me where he lived.Now, in a cathedral of that kind there is a nave and a crossing. Then there isan apse and a choir screen that runs around it. That choir screen was wideenough for a little room to be in there. He had his bed in that little room inthe choir screen and lived there. You could see out between the figures, andright there was the Black Virgin. Oh, I tell you, he had a privileged life inthat place. Everything went together: the imagery, the architecture, the rhythmof the day, going up to ring the bells. It was a beautifully coordinatedexistence.In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, there was a body of stories known asthe Miracles of the Virgin that included some wonderful little Romances. One ofthe cutest—years ago it was turned into a miraculous play in New York—was of anun who was assigned to scrub the chapel floor just when she had a date with herlover. The imaged Virgin comes down, takes the scrub-brush and pail, and says,“Go on out and have your day.” She did not play by the rules of the Cardinals.Art, then, is the Virgin’s medium. Art is the vehicle of the revealing power ofmāyā, the vehicle by which we go from the earth to the transcendent. One canalways see the Goddess in the world of art.In the Protestant community, where Mariolatry is abominated, there is no art. Gointo any New England chapel and you’ll see that it is very pretty, but hymns arethe closest things to art that you’ll find. I was raised a Catholic and marriedJean, daughter of a Protestant minister, so the first Protestant service I wentto was with her. We were standing there singing hymns, and I said to her, “YouProtestants do not have images, but just look at the images in this hymn: Godcoming to my little room and all that kind of thing.”One of the most interesting and amusing services I have experienced was in abeautiful church with marvelous stained-glass windows in Grand Rapids, where Igave a sermon entitled “Trick or Treat,” for Halloween, the Celtic festival ofAll Souls. In the middle of the service, the doors opened, and in came all thechildren of the congregation wearing masks. The big ones led the way, followedby smaller and smaller kids, until, finally, in came these tiny little tots withthese absurd masks. The masked children represented the spirits about to beborn. Then they all lined up near one of the upright pianos and sang, “I’ve beenworking on my costume, all the live long day.” It was really a spiritualexperience: the children, the choir—just members of the congregation—it wassimply sublime.Then I got up in this pulpit and, my god, I tell you, the pulpit is a weapon.Now there’s art for power: just the placement of that thing—where it is inrelation to everybody else. Unless you’ve stood in a pulpit, you don’t realizewhat you have on your side. When you stand there, nobody can hurt you. You areat the prow of a ship, poised to plow right through that sea of faces downbelow. I did it twice in two years. The first time, I was a little in awe of thepulpit, but the second time, I really knew how to use it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------An artist, to me, is a person who is a competent practitioner of an art.Somebody who just gets up to splash around is not necessarily an artist. Onedefinition of an artist that I heard someone seriously give is: “anybody who, inthe telephone book, calls him or herself an artist.” I do not go along withthat. Even in the practical arts, the principle of perfection in work is a basicexpectation.An artist is someone who is completed an art work, not a person who merelyintended to. Whether or not it is saleable either this year or next affectsneither its intrinsic value nor its intrinsic definition as an art work. VanGogh never sold a thing, but a couple of his works can make a museum. He was ingreat psychological trouble, but that man was an artist.The word artist is used in a number of ways, the two principle ones, the twoextremes, being: (a) one competent in performance and (b) an artist in the finearts. You cannot be an artist in the fine arts unless you are competent inperformance, but you can be competent in cooking or acrobatics or whatnot. Butthe experience of esthetic arrest has to do with the fine arts. One doesn’t seekesthetic arrest in looking at a good plumbing job. Its real function would bemissed.I heard of an amusing experiment when LSD was first around. Four bridge playerswere given light doses of LSD, with the understanding that they would then playbridge. When the cards had been dealt and picked up, all they did was look atthem. There was no playing of the game. It was esthetic arrest, an example ofsacred space. The cards were of no use except for esthetic rapture. The object,formerly in certain relevant situations in the life of secular enjoyment,suddenly becomes a thing-in-itself, a final thing.In action, it makes a difference whether all you are trying to do is to act orwhether you are trying to act competently. It helps a great deal to know whatthe hell you’re doing. What are you going to do well? Are you going to be apainter, a Picasso? Is this where your life achievement is? That is a realsacrifice of life.Whatever choice you make, there is a period of learning and analyzing, when youare not in action, the body is not in performance. Anyone who has taughtsomebody a skill has seen this stage, where the student is analyzing and tryingto do it, but really not in it. Then, finally, the person is able to giveexpression to what he or she is intending to express.My first and strongest experience of this was once when Jean came to Esalen withme and was going to give classes in dance. She got this bunch of people who werenot interested in technique, but wanted to dance. What they called creative workwas going out, opening their arms, and breathing at the ocean. It was not worthbeing with them even to see what was going on.There is nothing esthetic about a bunch of ballet people doing their barexercises. Then they move into dance and are still thinking about the rules, andtheir work is contrived. But then, finally, the rules melt and naturalspontaneity takes over again. There is an old standard saying about the arts:“You need to learn all the rules, and then forget them.” That is to say, letthem melt back into pure action.When young people who’ve not had the schooling I’ve had decide they’re going infor writing, editing, or something like that, I’ve noticed they don’t reallyhave the full equipment. Working on my books, I’ve hired intelligent youngpeople to help me with the editorial aspects, only to discover they can’t readGerman, they can’t read French., they don’t know this, they don’t know that. Itmakes me realize what all those years of schooling gave me. The fantastic amountof work that’s all under the water. One sees only the tip of the iceberg.In writing a book, you are moving along on the wave of your inspiration andintuition, and then you come to a difficult passage, an area you have to coverin order to get from here to there, and your momentum stops. That’s when youhave to bring in the rules.Also, in athletics, after you practice and practice, there is a lot you can thendo spontaneously. But at certain points, you have to act according to rules formoving the body that are not yet spontaneous to you. I think of pole vaulting orthe high hurdles: the time that has to be spent just on the technical posture.Or playing golf: how are you going to hold that club? There is no spontaneitywhen you are thinking all these things. When that is all absorbed, then you havea stronger propulsion than you had before you were forced to break it all up.I don’t think it is proper at all to take the position that C. P. Snow has:namely, that the science—the knowledge, the mathematical side of life—runs in anopposite direction to the life of spontaneous humanistic action. They supplementeach other. In literature, for instance, writing sonnets: it takes a lot ofpractice to make that kind of structure become something that just pours out,but when it does pour out, it is possible to say things that cannot be saidwithout the sonnet form. Form and expression are very close together.If you are going to act on the basis of what you know, you cannot just hold ontoyour knowledge. You have to translate it into a movement. This is the wholething in the arts. The student studies, studies, studies—learning thetechniques, the rules, what it is he must strive for—and when he gets used todoing all of that, then he can move. The creative act isnot hanging on, but yieldingto new creative movement. Think, for instance, of someone studying the piano. There is nothing worse thanhaving somebody in the neighborhood studying the piano, practicing theirexercises. There’s nothing at all beautiful about them. Their function is togive you facility. Then presently there comes a point when you have thefacility, it happens automatically, and you do not have to think, “do…re…me…fa….” Although analysis facilitates competent action, your spontaneity ofaction is inhibited when you are constantly thinking of the rules. This is truefor everything. The one who attempts to be an artist and has not learned thecraft is never going to be an artist. If you find you are trying,go back to school.You’re not ready yet. There is a big difference between art as therapy, where the person is trying tobecome human, and art as art, where the art carries the person past humanityinto new spheres. The difference is that, in therapy, the technique and the artobject are of no importance, since all you are trying to do is turn a personwho’s off the track into someone who is on the track. The therapeutic operationin the art is to bring the person back to his own self, to turn him into aharmonized human being again. But art comes from harmonized human beings—“Art isa harmony parallel to nature.” And if the person is not parallel to nature yet,then art is just a therapy to bring him or her to that point. Therapeutic art istrying to “catch up,” you might say. It is no art for anybody but the personwho’s doing it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Highly stylized dance, like ballet and Indian dance, is a wonderful example ofthis thing we are talking about: what has to be learned to manipulate the body,all those exercises, eliminates dance fora while. In Hindu dance, the whole bodyis taken apart: there are certain things the eyes do, certain things the handsdo, and so on. Then it is put back together again, and what you get is atransformation of nature in art. It is nothing to look at until you see a dancerwho really can do it, and then, my god, another nature comes in on anotherplane. The danceis the highest symbolof life itself. In song and dance man expresses himself as a member of a higher community; hehas forgotten how to walk and speak and is on the way toward flying, dancinginto the air. His very gestures are of enchantment.… He feels himself to be agod, going about in ecstasy, exalted, like the gods beheld in his dreams.…He isno longer an artist, he has become a work of art. In a paroxysm of intoxicationthe creative power of all nature has come to light in him as the highest raptureof the one that is All. Nature, with its true voice undissembled cries out tous: “Be as I am! I, the primordial ever-creating mother amidst the ceaselessflux of appearances, ever impelling into existence, eternally finding in thesetransformations satisfaction.”—Nietzsche142 [part0105.html#footnote142] Art is the set of wingsto carry you out ofyour own entanglement. Spengler makes an interesting distinction between what he calls “art asornament” and “art as imitation.” The prime example of art as ornament isarchitecture, where a structure is timeless once it is achieved: there it sits.The opposite, art as imitation, would be the dance: if you do not see aparticular performance, you’ll never see that dance again. It is something of alife moment. It’s an idea that has meant a lot to me in realizing the differentproblems of various artists. One of the sad things about a dancer’s career isthat such great moments are of an essence, and anybody who was not there missedit. For instance, what about Pavlova? If you didn’t see that particularperformance, it’s gone.I have lived close to the dance world ever since my marriage to Jean. She hadthe idea of dance being a part of her life, so that when dance in the high stylewas no longer possible, she was able to handle it: always her life, not her art,was the number one thing. Jean has had an elegant career, and she has had ahusband who was willing to see it happen. She was taken into Martha Graham’sgroup just when we were married, and that was a marvelous group of wonderfuldancers: Merce Cunningham, Erick Hawkins, Jane Dudley, Jean. Believe me, theywere all first-rate dancers.The big shift that the dancer has to make in later years is that the dance is nolonger to be thought of as something in the way of a performance or anexhibition, but rather, like a bird singing, just for itself, and only to thedistance the body feels it would be lovely to go. Out of that will come a life,because you are in the center of action of your psyche’s need and joy, and thatwill radiate into the rest of what you are doing. The whole world will join thedance. All we really want to do is dance. Sacred Dance is for the gods, not for an audience. This is one of the thingsthat comes up when you try to put folk dance on the stage. It’s for the joy ofthe people doing the dance, and it just does not work any other way. The factthat dance was cut out of our religions way back in the late Middle Ages hasturned dance into a purely secular thing.I’m working on the posthumous papers of a young man who went to India to studydance. He was one of Jean’s students at New York University’s Tisch School ofthe Arts, and he became so fascinated with Indian dance that he went to India.He was a young Jew, who had been studying to be a rabbi, and his family was ingreat distress when he went over there, not only to dance, but to study thedance of Śiva, an alien god. Being a religiously oriented person, he wasfascinated by the religious implications of the dance: the god is the dancer,and you have to become the god to worship the god, to find that god in yourself.What he recognized was the total difference in implication between dancing foran audience and dancing for the god. When you are alone and in your own place,you are dancing for the god and identifying with it. This whole idea is basic toTantra: to worship a god, you must become that god. No matter what you call thegod or think it is, the god you worship is the one you are capable of becoming.The power of a deity is that it personifies a power that is in Nature and inyour nature. When you find that level, then you are in play. That is the work ofart in general, because art really is a worship.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are two approaches to choosing a profession. One is to study thestatistics on the number of jobs that are going to be available in this or thatcate-gory in the next ten years and base your life on that. That’s following therim of the wheel. The other, is to ask yourself, “What do I want to do?” If youdo that, then you are up against your decision. But if you say, “I am going todo what I want to do,” and if you stay with it, then something will happen. Youmay not have a job, but you will have a life, and it will be interesting. In the wheel of fortune,wisdom points to the center.Youth points to the rim. I have known dozens of artists, and most of them, unless they become commercialartists, live without knowing where their life is going or how it is going tobe. You should see what kids in dance go through, and there are no jobs. If youreally want to know what it is like in a profession where there are no jobs, goto an actors’ school. It is disheartening to see those young people come infull-of-beans and, boy, do they get it.The normal situation is that, perhaps for years, you work away at your art, yourlife vocation, your life-fulfilling field of action, and there’s no money in it.You have to live though, so you get a job, which may be a low-degree activityrelative to what you are interested in. You could, for instance, teach peoplethe art you are operating in yourself. So, let’s say you have a teaching job,and you also have sacred space and time to perform your own work. Your art iswhat I would call your work. Your employment is your job.Then, you are doing so well in your job that your employer wants to move youinto a higher position. You’ll have to give more to the job than before, and youwill receive a higher salary, but your new commit-ments will cut down on yourfree time. My advice is: don’t accept the promotion. Don’t accept anything thatpiles more on you than what you must do to earn your base income, because youare developing, not in your job, but in your artistic work. You can see oncampuses all the time what happens with promotions: you move up, up, up, untilyou are in administration, and it uses up everything you’ve got. The artist mustbuild a structure, not in the way of being of service to society, but in the wayof discovering the dynamism of the interior.To do that, to keep up with your responsibilities and your fitness and stillnurture your creative aspect, you must put a hermetically sealed retort, so thatthere is no intrusion, around a certain number of hours each day—however manyyou can honestly afford—and that time must be inviolate. You can allow yourselfa few more hours than you think you deserve, but you must make certain you haveenough energy and time left over to attend to whatever you have to take care of.It’s like doing your exercises: you set aside a time when you’re going toexercise, and that is a holy time. With your art, you should do the same: give acertain number of hours a day to your art, and make it consis-tent. Then,whether you’re writing or not, sit there for those hours: it’s a meditation oncommunication and expression, the two factors in the art work. What will happen,ideally, is that gradually—and it might not be this week or next or even thisyear—as your given responsibilities drop off, there will be an expansion of thetime available to you for the practice of your art. The point I’m making is thatyour work—that is, your art—and your job must not contaminate each other.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The creative adventure is always reckless. That goes even for the simple thing Ido in writing a book. Friedrich Schiller, a German poet in Goethe’s time, wrotean interesting letter to a young writer who had writer’s block—that’s refusal ofthe call in a writer. Schiller said in the letter, “Your problem is that youbring in the critical factor before the lyric factor has had a chance to expressitself.” In poetry, for example, we spend our youth studying Shakespeare andMilton, and then, when we start to write our own pitiful little poem, we think,“Oh, my god.” When writing,don’t criticize the words coming out.Just let them come.Let go of the critical factor:Will I make money? Am I wasting time? My writing is of a very different kind from anything I have heard about. Allthis mythological material is out there, a big gathering of stuff, and I havebeen reading it for some forty- or fifty-odd years. There are various ways ofhandling that. The most common is to put the material together and publish ascholarly book about it. But when I’m writing, I try to get a sense of anexperiential relationship to the material. In fact, I can’t write unless thathappens. It is like putting it into some kind of meat grinder that grinds itinto a new thing and yet does not do violence to the material. It’s veryexciting when it comes together that way.I don’t write unless the stuff is really working on me, and my selection ofmaterial depends on what works. Usually, with mythology, you are almostcheating, because it is all in shape anyhow. All the elementary ideas are there.You only have to recognize them, and the work cooks. It’s the damnedest thing:you are going along, and suddenly you find you have said things you did not knowyou were saying, because it is all right there.When I’m writing, I think of the whole academic world: I know how they thinkabout this material, and it is not the same way that I think about it. I justhave to say, “Let the guillotine come down. You are still going to have thismessage.” I always feel as if I am going through the Clashing Rocks, and theyare just about to close, but I manage to get through before I let that thoughtovercome me. It’s a very strange process: actually holding that door open andgetting the sentences out. Do not think about the negative side. There will benegatives that are going to come down, but you have to hold the door open if youare going to do any-thing that has not been done before. You have to suspend allcriticism to do your work. In writing, you have to do this all the time in orderto get the sentence out. Suspending criticism is killing the dragon Thou Shalt.Kill him. Get the writing out first.Forget the critic and just write.Afterward, you can bring inthe critical factor and prune. If you have trouble because you are thinking, “Who is ever going to seethis?”—then think of someone you know who would resonate to your statement andwrite for that person. It is a great facilitator to have a specific person inmind, until you no longer need an audience. Think of little children, forexample, with their tiny eyes looking up at you. Talk to them. Write to them. Ina book, you will often see a sincere dedication to the person for whom the bookwas written. Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, for instance, was written for onespecific little girl. When I started writing, I thought of my students at SarahLawrence, the actual people with whom I was dealing. I knew their thinking andthe kinds of words that spoke to them.The two things, then, that I’d say are necessary for breaking through what’scalled writer’s block are, first, to have a person to whom you are addressingyourself and, second, to set aside a couple of hours a day when, as it were,you’re writing letters of love to that person. Writer’s block results fromtoo much head. Cut off your head.Pegasus, poetry, was born of Medusawhen her head was cut off.You have to be reckless when writing.Be as crazy as your conscience allows. When you begin to get a sense of the material dictating the form, you will bewriting. It may happen fast, or it may take you a little while to find the flow.When I started The Masks of God, I dashed off the first book, PrimitiveMythology I was in a great hurry to get finished, because I had been given somemoney to go to Japan for a big session of the International Congress for theHistory of Religions, so I just churned it out. And then, the reaction to it wasso impressive to me—it was a much better book than I thought I had written—thatwhen I started to write Volume II, I was blocked for awhile, until I said, “Hey,listen, come off it. Stick your neck out and just write the book.” I thank Godthat I had read that letter of Schiller’s to the young poet.In religion, one speaks of the fear of God and the love of God. Fear of God willblock you. Love of God will carry you on. If you can do something that you loveto do without fear of criticism, you will move. You will find joy in it. You donot have to move more than an inch to feel the joy. Remember, the Buddha’s thirdtemptation was dharma, duty, doing what people expect you to do. That’s thecensorship fear.After you have written something, when you see it in typescript, you will wantto fool around with it, because it will be different from the way it was inscript. Then, when you are satisfied with the typescript, you send it to thepublisher. He accepts it, and when he sends you the galleys, you will want tofool with it again. Every time it appears in a form that is not the one directlyout of your hand, you get an objective attitude toward it. In a way, you becomethe reader instead of the writer, and you see it in a new light. This craftingis part of the process of turning something into a work of art. I think thatmany people today do not realize what it means to be an artist, instead ofsimply a person who is writing. I mean, there is a craft and an attitude and awillingness to recognize that, unless it is in form, it is not art. Let your darlings out,but murder them,or two years later,you’ll wish you had.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you are going to stay in the village compound, the town will take care ofyou. But if you go on the adventure, it is prudent to go at the right time. Thisis a real problem if you are overcome late in life, if you have already taken onresponsibilities when the light goes on: like Gauguin ,who made a total mess,not only of his life, but of his family’s life. But as he went to pieces, hisart became greater and greater. He did not go into painting seriously until hewas around forty-five-years–old, and then his life was in his paintings. His wasa hero’s journey, but at a very high price. It is an ironic situation: you’d sayhe made a mess of it as a man, but as an artist, he was a triumph.Then there is the experience of coming back with your jewel and nobody wants it:the “don’t-throw-your-pearls-before-swine” sort of thing, lest people turnagainst you. Often there is not a waiting public. You know the story of theartist who is “ahead of his time,” the one who is only appreciated ageneration-and-a-half later.During the 40s and 50s, Jean was working with some artists who were way out, andtwenty years later they are top people. John Cage, for example, did music forfour of her dances and nobody knew Cage. He was doing the most bizarre things,but he just hung on and knew and knew. Now, he is a major figure in the field.He also said, “Fame is of no importance.” The light of fame comes past, and onemay be in it for three minutes, for thirty minutes, or never at all. But fame isnot what the artist is working for. It’s the commercial artist who says,“Whatever they want, I am going to give it to them.” The real artist givesexpression to a gift that has come to him, and the susception of the giftimplies, “I have to put it out.”Sometimes, however, an artist becomes so enraptured by the creative plunge, thatyou might say “life drops off.” This is one of the problems in yoga also. Whenillumination hits, life drops off, and you can’t get back. That’s the effectthat follows one who is an artist but has not gotten the realization into his orher life. In loving the spiritual,you cannot despise the earthly. Joyce was such a person: my god, what a life! When you read Richard Ellman’sJames Joyce, his biography, you wonder how anyone could have lived such a life.You don’t know how that man stood it, how his family stood it, how any of hisfriends stood it. But look what he accomplished. I mean, if you have the eyes tosee it.It took him twelve years to finish A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Hebegan the project as an essay in 1904, but the novel wasn’t published until1916. And if Yeats had not recommended him to Ezra Pound, who got him published,we would never have heard of Joyce. Meanwhile, he had written Dubliners and wasat work on Ulysses, which he spent seven years writing. It’s as though he said,“There it is. I have to formulate this thing for my own realization of what itis.”The first editions of Ulysses were burned by New York and English customsauthorities I think only one or two copies remain. Finally, he had to have itprinted in France, and when I was a student, that was the only place you couldbuy Ulysses. People here in the United States did not even know it existed.He spent sixteen years writing Finnegans Wake, and you should have read thereviews when that came out: “What is this guy doing? Has he gone nuts? Is hejust pulling a crazy job on us?” The first edition of Finnegans Wake wasremaindered within two months. I bought four hardcover copies for fifty-sixcents each. When a book is remaindered, the publisher is trying to get back themoney for printing it. The author gets nothing.Joyce died three weeks short of his fifty-ninth birthday, with the final book hewas planning left undone. He would not be my model for a life, but he is a modelfor my relationship to art. Thomas Mann said Joyce was probably the greatestnovelist of the twentieth century. But, look what it cost him to do that.Joyce endured all these travails because his intention was perfection.Perfection is the fulfillment implicit in art, and he achieved it. Imperfectionis life. All forms in life are imperfect, but the function of art is to see theradiance through the imperfection. The artist opensthe forms of the workto transcendence. What I understand art to be, then, is the revealing power of māyā: theproduction in music, in dance, in the visual arts, and in literature of such“divinely superfluous beauty,” of objects for esthetic arrest which are of nopractical use, but which open up dimensions within. And the projecting power ofmāyā, on the other hand, I take to be desire and loathing, which link you inphenomenal discourse to the object as object. It is as clear and clean as that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In India, there are two orders of art: one is esthetic art; the other, templeart, is not esthetic in its aim. Temple art is concerned not with arresting theeye but with affecting a psychic transformation in the artist and the beholder.We’re into another kind of art here. The source of the image is a vision.Europeans for quite a while had a hard time appreciating Indian art. Indianpoetry and philosophy were appreciated, but not the art, until they realized theimages weren’t representations of things, but tools for psychic transformation.Now, with Joyce, I would say Finnegans Wake is a book that affects a psychictransformation in the reader. If the reader really works on it and finds outwhat Joyce is saying, there is a vision there that can transform one’srelationship to the world.Coomaraswamy has given considerable attention to the conception of an Indianreligious work of art. Let us say an artist is going to do something on Śiva inthe dance. First he studies the textbooks on Śiva: what the organization of theimage should be, what should be in the god’s hands, and all that. Then hepronounces the god’s name, meditates, and brings forth in his own consciousnessan image of the god dancing, so that what is presented has been derived frominner, rather than from outer, vision.Normally we look at the Nataraja Śiva with an esthetic intent: we see it simplyas an art object. But the one who is devoted to Śiva lets that object become anopening of those centers in his own consciousness that correspond to the Śiva inhimself: “I am Śiva.” That is very different from just looking at a Śiva image.One is often unable to experience Indian temple art in an esthetic way at all,because it has intended another kind of effect. You have to move into the godposition to grasp what the image has given you. Indian temple art is notpornographic, because you are not excited to desire the object depicted. Say yougo to an art gallery desiring to have an esthetic experience. It is static, andinsofar as it affects a transformation of consciousness, it brings about a newstasis within you. There is a trans-formation just as there is a transformationwith esthetic arrest. You are no longer the lecherous human being. You arestabilized in esthetic arrest. Temple art pushes that one dimension further, sothat your consciousness with respect to all things in the world is changed. It’sa permanent change that takes place in you. Perhaps one could say that all trueart is temple art, but there is a difference between art that intends estheticarrest and art that intends psychic transformation. You could say the latter isnot properly art. It is a religious device.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Some artists are in pain, others are not. Picasso had a run of wives and womenthat was just fantastic. What one wife did would not have mattered a bit. I donot think it possible to interpret Picasso’s life as one of pain. In the PicassoRetrospective, which I saw twice at the Museum of Modern Art, there was one roomfilled with about twenty-five paintings that he had done in one day. What was itthat impelled him to this fury of action? He was certainly the type of artist inwhom life is so abundant that the art is easily handled, which shows the greatskill of his nature.I read Wagner’s autobiography—fantastic! That guy was writing three operas,carrying on three love affairs, and actually being resentful that the women’shusbands would not give money to help produce his operas! He was outta sight!His knowledge of mythology was way ahead of what any of the scholars in his timeknew. In the Ring Cycle, he combined into one unit two aspects of Germanicmythology: the hero journey and the cosmic order—coming into the world and goingout of the world. On top of that, at the same time he was writing the librettos,he amplified the orchestra to such an extent—using reeds and French horns and soon—that he effectively invented a whole new orchestra! And he designed what isprobably the best theatre that Europe has had. I can’t understand how he did itall. I think some people justhave so much spunk that they cannot be judged inordinary terms.I never knew an artist who didn’t want money, but they don’t pursue it. Theirminds are elsewhere. Joyce begged everyone he knew for money. But he couldn’tmake money and do what he did: sixteen years writing Finnegans Wake. Bringingthat prodigious load into the “room of his life” was all that Joyce couldmanage.Schiller, a sensitive and intelligent student of psy-chology in relation to art,distinguished two types of artists: one, he called the “sentimental” artist; theother, the “naive” artist. He used as his models Goethe and himself. He was thesentimental artist: the one without great means, who did not pay properattention to his health, for whom art was his life, not the other way around.Everything went into his art. Goethe, on the other hand, was the naive artist: aman of ample life, an important person in local politics, a person for whom artwas but one aspect of his life. Some such people require a bit more instructionthan others, but Goethe had fantastic intuition, great energy, and vitality. Hewas a masterly artist.Thomas Mann wrote an interesting paper called “Goethe and Tolstoy,” based onthis idea of Schiller’s. He compared Dostoevsky to the sentimental artist, asSchiller had described himself, and Tolstoy to the naive artist. Tolstoy was aproperty owner, who used to put on a nice silk shirt, go out, and harvest thegrain with his peasants. He would make believe he was a peasant, but that wasall part of the game too.It’s interesting to compare the works of these two types of writers. TheSchiller-Dostoevsky types tend to be highly hopped up. There’s a strong,dramatic conflict in their writing. Both Tolstoy and Goethe, on the other hand,are genial authors, and their works have powerful passages of epic proportionsand a wonderful majesty. Conversely, in Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment it ispain, pain—a life of inward, spiritual agony. These are two different ways, twodifferent temperaments. The pain is not something sentimental artists strivefor, it results from their giving all of their energy to divinely superfluousactivity and not paying attention to the living of life.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We are to fill the sacred space, then, with art. And when I say “art,” I mean“divinely superfluous beauty,” not doodling and having pretty decorations inyour house. The sacred space is where things are experienced as not being of anypractical use. It is through the contemplation of something “thuscome”—“divinely superfluous”—that the aspects of oneself that are not ofimmediate practical use can come forth. I think organic growth comes in thatway, not in the way of going into a practical activity.The practical activity comes after the organism has stated itself in itsmaturity, or else it comes forth in a distorted way: the person thinks ofhimself as nothing but a plumber or something like that. That’s the problem in atraditional culture like India, where people from birth are cookie-molded intothe dharma of their caste. And they are nothing but that. They never becomehuman beings, individuals, but remain individuals: people that are elements in alarger structure.I think that is the big difference between the Oriental and the Occidental idealfor a human being. The person in the Orient is either a warrior, or a merchant,or whatever, and nothing else. In the West, however, the person is anindividual. The Greeks had the idea of the total individual and held it up asbeing completely different from the Oriental idea of people being trained into apattern of life in accordance with the necessities of society. I experiencedthis idea of the total individual at Delphi, where you see everything related:the oracle, the art, the theatre, and the stadium up on top.For most people, the life of art is an all-absorbing matter, and it requires ahell of a lot of work. What Ramakrishna said about illumination is also trueabout art: “Unless you seek it as a man whose hair is on fire seeks a pond,don’t pursue it.” It is too difficult.For women who marry, it requires a hell of an ac-quiescence on the part of thehusband, too—I can tell you about that. I know so many young women who were indance, then married, and the husband could not stand it. And, of course, it isdifficult to have a family with an art that requires the kind of disciplinedance demands. The thing about dance is that if you are not disciplined, it isdamned evident the next time you get on stage.Jean once said, “The way of the artist and the way of the mystic are similar,but the mystic lacks a craft.” The craft keeps the artist in touch with thephenomenality of the world and in a relationship to it: a constant evaluation ofthe uniqueness of each event in the world. The mystic, by contrast, can be sodarned abstract that there is no link to life except the begging bowl. Yet,sometimes those begging bowls can be very productive. Some of our gurus arepulling in millions of dollars. But that does not mean they are related to life.I have seen the training of artists in this country and in Europe. They aretrained only in the craft. They are given techniques for rendering something,but they do not know what to do with the techniques. I’ve know many of them whojust cracked up. Their art technique becomes a wall they cannot penetrate, sothey try to think of anecdotes and narratives to render that show off theirtechnique. They are so loaded with sociology, that they think they do not havean art object if there is not some kind of lesson in there for fixing the worldor themselves. But, in fact, an art object by definition is “divinelysuperfluous beauty.”Do you see in this the projecting power of māyā and the revealing power? As longas the motifs of desire and loathing are moving you, it is the projectingaspect. You are yourself the māyā-maker, and you are the one who opens therevealing power when your attitude is that of the Buddha. When I realized this,it was thrilling to me. I think that art and this knowledge of what art is canbe the modern Western way to illumination. It will release you from all kinds oflinkages. It will not keep you from practicing all those things you hardlybelieve in, but it will help you in achieving the esthetic before you becomelinked to the objects of your life. When you distinguishbetween good and evil,you’ve lost the art. Art goes beyond morality. The reach of your compassionis the reach of your art."},{"pageContent":"JOYCE’S trick wasseeing symbols everywhere. …Dr. John W. Perry has characterized the living mythological symbol as an“affect image.” It is an image that hits one where it counts. It is notaddressed first to the brain, to be there interpreted and appreciated. On thecontrary, if that is where it has to be read, the symbol is already dead. An“affect image” talks directly to the feeling system and immediately elicits aresponse, after which the brain may come along with its interesting comments.There is some kind of throb of resonance within, responding to the image shownwithout, like the answer of a musical string to another equally tuned. And so itis that when the vital symbols of any given social group evoke in all itsmembers responses of this kind, a sort of magical accord unites them as onespiritual organism, functioning through members who, though separate in space,are yet one in being and belief.143 [part0105.html#footnote143] Once you understand symbolic things,you, too, will see symbols everywhere. The wonder is that the characteristic efficacy to touch and inspire deepcreative centers dwells in the smallest nursery fairy tale—as the flavor of theocean is contained in a droplet or the whole mystery of life within the egg of aflea. For the symbols of mythology are not manufactured; they cannot be ordered,invented, or permanently suppressed. They are spontaneous productions of thepsyche, and each bears within it, undam-aged, the germ power of its source.144[part0105.html#footnote144] The divine manifestation is ubiquitous,only our eyes are not open to it. The symbol opens our eyes. “A true symbol takes us to the center of the circle, not to another point on thecircumference. It is by symbolism that man enters effectively and consciouslyinto contact with his own deepest self, with other men, and with God.…”—ThomasMerton145 [part0105.html#footnote145] Frequently a symbol doesn’t openour eyes, but closes them instead. If we concretize the symbol,we get stuck with it. In short, then: just as the buffalo suddenly disappeared from the North Americanplains, leaving the Indians deprived not only of a central mythic symbol butalso of the very manner of life that the symbol once had served, so likewise inour own beautiful world, not only have our public religious symbols lost theirclaim to authority and passed away, but the ways of life they once supportedhave also disappeared; and as the Indians then turned inward, so do many in ourown baffled world—and frequently with Oriental, not Occidental, guidance in thispotentially very dangerous, often ill-advised interior adventure, questingwithin for the affect images that our secularized social order with itsincongruously archaic religious institutions can no longer render.146[part0105.html#footnote146] The world has been desanctified."},{"pageContent":"The chick from the eggis a symbol of the spirit of Easter. The image of the cosmic egg is known to many mythologies; it appears in theGreek Orphic, Egyptian, Finnish, Buddhistic, and Japanese. “In the beginningthis world was merely nonbeing,” we read in a sacred work of the Hindus; “It wasexistent. It developed. It turned into an egg. It lay for the period of a year.It was split asunder. One of the two parts became silver, one gold. That whichwas of silver is the earth. That which is of gold is the sky. What was the outermembrane is the mountains. What was the inner me-brane is cloud and mist. Whatwere the veins are the rivers. What was the fluid within is the ocean.

Snake and moon both die to the old,shedding their shadows to be reborn. Birds in flight and Christ on the cross: both symbolize the spirit released fromthe bondage of earth. The moon, like Christ, dies and is resurrected. The moonis three nights darkk: Jesus was three nights in the grave with a stone coveringthe cave entrance—the dark disk over the moon. The dating of Easter according toboth lunar and solar calendars suggests that life, like the light reborn in themoon and eternal in the sun, finally is one. The whole mystery is right there inChristian symbology.The moon, furthermore, and the spectacle of the night sky, the stars and theMilky Way, have constituted, certainly from the beginning, a source of wonderand profound impression. But there is actually a physical influence of the moonupon the earth and its creatures, its tides and our own interior tides, whichhas long been consciously recognized as well as subliminally experienced. Thecoincidence of the menstrual cycle with that of the moon is a physical actualitystructuring human life and a curiosity that has been observed with wonder. It isin fact likely that the fundamental notion of a life-structuring relationshipbetween the heavenly world and that of man was derived from the realization,both in experience and in thought, of the force of the lunar cycle. The mystery,also, of the death and resurrection of the moon, as well as of its influence ondogs, wolves and foxes, jackals and coyotes, which try to sing to it: thisimmortal silver dish of wonder, cruising among the beautiful stars and racingthrough the clouds, turning waking life itself into a sort of dream, has been aforce and presence even more powerful in the shaping of mythology than the sun,by which its light and its world of stars, night sounds, erotic modes, and themagic of dream, are daily quenched.149 [part0105.html#footnote149]Dew is an ambrosiafallen from the moon. This lunar symbology is ancient: the moon god in Mesopotamia was named Sin; themountain that Moses ascended was Mount Sinai. It may have been the moon goddessmountain. When Moses came down from that mountain, he was so luminous from hisreception of God’s energy that he wore a veil in front of his face, andemanating from his forehead were horns of light: the horns of the lunar mystery.”The moon lives twenty-eight days and this is our month. Each of these daysrepresents something sacred to us: two of the days represent the Great Spirit;two are for Mother Earth; four are for the four winds; one is for the SpottedEagle; one for the sun; and one for the moon; one is for the Morning Star; andfour are for the four ages; seven for our seven great rites; one is for thebuffalo; one for the fire; one for the water; one for the rock; and finally, oneis for the two-legged people.

Every now and then, while I’m walking along Fifth Avenue, everything just breaksup into subatomic particles and I think, “Well, Jesus Christ, that is what itis. This is the experience of māyā, an illusion of the senses if there ever wasone.” It’s a fantastic thought.His disciples said to Him: “When will the Kingdom come?” Jesus said: “It willnot come by expectation; they will not say: ‘See, here’ or: ‘See there.’ But theKingdom of the Father is spread upon the earth and men do not see it.”159[part0105.html#footnote159]The return is seeingthe radiance everywhere.“The president in Washington sends word that he wishes to buy our land.

Every single pine needle,every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every meadow, every humminginsect.

We are part of the earth and it is part of us. Theperfumed flowers are our sisters. The bear, the deer, the great eagle, these areour brothers.

So you must give to the rivers the kindness you would giveany brother.“If we sell you our land, remember that the air is precious to us, that the airshares its spirit with all the life it supports.

Whatever he does to the web, he doesto himself.“One thing we know: our god is also your god. The earth is precious to him andto harm the earth is to heap contempt on its creator.“Your destiny is a mystery to us. What will happen when the buffalo are allslaughtered? The wild horses tamed?

Where will theeagle be? Gone!

Care for it as we have cared for it.Hold in your mind the memory of the land as it is when you receive it. Pre-servethe land for all children and love it, as God loves us all.“As we are part of the land, you too are part of the land. This earth isprecious to us. It is also precious to you.

And we ourselves areno less mysterious. In searching out its wonders, we are learning simultaneouslythe wonder of ourselves. That moon flight as an outward journey was outward intoourselves. And I do not mean this poetically, but factually, historically. Imean that the actual fact of the making and the visual broadcasting of that triphas transformed, deepened, and extended human consciousness to a degree and in amanner that amounts to the opening of a new spiritual era.…that lovely satellite has been out there circling our earth for some fourbillion years like a beautiful but lone-some woman trying to catch earth’s eye.She has now at last caught it, and has caught thereby ourselves.

And their sons?What voyages are to be theirs?164 [part0105.html#footnote164]Follow your bliss.What is, or what is to be, the new mythology? Since myth is of the order ofpoetry, let us ask first a poet: Walt Whitman, for example, in his Leaves ofGrass (1855):I have said that the soul is not more than the body,And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one’s-self is,And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral, dressedin his shroud,And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth, And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning ofall times,And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become ahero,And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheeled universe,And any man or woman shall stand cool and supercilious before a millionuniverses. And I call to mankind, Be not curious about God,For I who am curious about each am not curiousabout God,No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death. I hear and behold God in every object, yet I understand God not in the least,Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself. Why should I wish to see God better than this day?I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass;I find letters from God dropped in the street, and every one is signed by God’sname,And I leave them where they are, for I know that others will punctually comeforever and ever.165 [part0105.html#footnote165]These lines of Whitman echo marvelously the sentiments of the earliest of theUpaniṣads, the “Great Forest Book” (Bṛhadāranyaka) of about the eighth centuryB.C.“This that people say, ‘Worship this god! Worship that god!’—one god afteranother! All this is his creation indeed! And he himself is all the gods.…He isentered in the universe even to our fingernail-tips, like a razor in a razorcase, or fire in firewood. Him those people see not, for as seen he isincomplete. When breathing, he becomes ‘breath’ by name; when speaking, ‘voice’;when seeing, ‘the eye’; when hearing, ‘the ear’; when thinking, ‘mind’: theseare but the names of his acts.…“One should worship with the thought that he is one’s self, for therein allthese become one. This self is the footprint of that All, for by it one knowsthe All—just as, verily, by following a footprint one finds cattle that havebeen lost.… One should reverence the Self alone as dear. And he who reverencesthe Self alone as dear—what he holds dear, verily, will not perish.…So whosoever worships another divinity than his self, thinking, ‘He is one, I amanother,’ knows not. He is like a sacrificial animal for the gods.…”166[part0105.html#footnote166]Indeed, do we not hear the same from Christ himself, as reported in the earlyGnostic Gospel According to Thomas?“Whoever drinks from my mouth shall become as I am and I myself will become he,and the hidden things shall be revealed to him.…I am the All, the All came forthfrom me and the All attained to me.

[../images/00005.jpeg]Over one hundred years ago, on March 26th in 1904, Joseph John Campbell was bornin White Plains, NY. Joe, as he came to be known, was the first child of amiddle-class, Roman Catholic couple, Charles and Josephine Campbell.Joe's earliest years were largely unremarkable; but then, when he was sevenyears old, his father took him and his younger brother, Charlie, to see BuffaloBill's Wild West show. The evening was a high-point in Joe's life; for, althoughthe cowboys were clearly the show's stars, as Joe would later write, he \"becamefascinated, seized, obsessed, by the figure of a naked American Indian with hisear to the ground, a bow and arrow in his hand, and a look of special knowledgein his eyes.”It was Arthur Schopenhauer, the philosopher whose writings would later greatlyinfluence Campbell, who observed that…the experiences and illuminations of childhood and early youth become in laterlife the types, standards and patterns of all subsequent knowledge andexperience, or as it were, the categories according to which all later thingsare classified—not always consciously, however. And so it is that in ourchildhood years the foundation is laid of our later view of the world, and therewith as well of its superficiality or depth: it will be in later years unfoldedand fulfilled, not essentially changed.And so it was with young Joseph Campbell. Even as he actively practiced (untilwell into his twenties) the faith of his forbears, he became consumed withNative American culture; and his worldview was arguably shaped by the dynamictension between these two mythological perspectives. On the one hand, he wasimmersed in the rituals, symbols, and rich traditions of his Irish Catholicheritage; on the other, he was obsessed with primitive (or, as he laterpreferred, \"primal\") people's direct experience of what he came to describe as\"the continuously created dynamic display of an absolutely transcendent, yetuniversally immanent, mysterium tremendum et fascinans, which is the ground atonce of the whole spectacle and of oneself.\" (Historical Atlas of WorldMythology[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&JCComp&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=701],I.1, p. 8)By the age of ten, Joe had read every book on American Indians in the children'ssection of his local library and was admitted to the adult stacks, where heeventually read the entire multi-volume Reports of the Bureau of AmericanEthnology. He worked on wampum belts, started his own \"tribe\" (named the\"Lenni-Lenape\" after the Delaware tribe who had originally inhabited the NewYork metropolitan area), and frequented the American Museum of Natural History,where he became fascinated with totem poles and masks, thus beginning a lifelongexploration of that museum's vast collection.After spending much of his thirteenth year recuperating from a respiratoryillness, Joe briefly attended Iona, a private school in Westchester NY, beforehis mother enrolled him at Canterbury, a Catholic residential school in NewMilford CT. His high school years were rich and rewarding, though marked by amajor tragedy: in 1919, the Campbell home was consumed by a fire that killed hisgrandmother and destroyed all of the family's possessions.Joe graduated from Canterbury in 1921, and the following September, enteredDartmouth College; but he was soon disillusioned with the social scene anddisappointed by a lack of academic rigor, so he transferred to ColumbiaUniversity, where he excelled: while specializing in medieval literature, heplayed in a jazz band, and became a star runner. In 1924, while on a steamshipjourney to Europe with his family, Joe met and befriended Jiddu Krishnamurti,the young messiah-elect of the Theosophical Society, thus beginning a friendshipthat would be renewed intermittently over the next five years.Joseph Campbell, graduate student at the University of Paris, 1928[../images/00006.jpeg]After earning a B.A. from Columbia (1925), and receiving an M.A. (1927) for hiswork in Arthurian Studies, Joe was awarded a Proudfit Traveling Fellowship tocontinue his studies at the University of Paris (1927-28). Then, after he hadreceived and rejected an offer to teach at his high school alma mater, hisFellowship was renewed, and he traveled to Germany to resume his studies at theUniversity of Munich (1928-29).It was during this period in Europe that Joe was first exposed to thosemodernist masters—notably, the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, Pablo Picasso andPaul Klee, James Joyce and Thomas Mann, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung—whose artand insights would greatly influence his own work. These encounters wouldeventually lead him to theorize that all myths are the creative products of thehuman psyche, that artists are a culture's mythmakers, and that mythologies arecreative manifestations of humankind's universal need to explain psychological,social, cosmological, and spiritual realities.When Joe returned from Europe late in August of 1929, he was at a crossroad,unable to decide what to do with his life. With the onset of the GreatDepression, he found himself with no hope of obtaining a teaching job; and so hespent most of the next two years reconnecting with his family, reading, renewingold acquaintances, and writing copious entries in his journal. Then, late in1931, after exploring and rejecting the possibility of a doctoral program orteaching job at Columbia, he decided, like countless young men before and since,to \"hit the road,\" to undertake a cross-country journey in which he hoped toexperience \"the soul of America\" and, in the process, perhaps discover thepurpose of his life. In January of 1932, when he was leaving Los Angeles, wherehe had been studying Russian in order to read War and Peace in the vernacular,he pondered his future in this journal entry:I begin to think that I have a genius for working like an ox over totallyirrelevant subjects. … I am filled with an excruciating sense of never havinggotten anywhere—but when I sit down and try to discover where it is I want toget, I'm at a loss. … The thought of growing into a professor gives me thecreeps. A lifetime to be spent trying to kid myself and my pupils into believingthat the thing that we are looking for is in books! I don't know where it is—butI feel just now pretty sure that it isn't in books. — It isn't in travel. — Itisn't in California. — It isn't in New York. … Where is it? And what is it,after all?Thus one real result of my Los Angeles stay was the elimination of Anthropologyfrom the running. I suddenly realized that all of my primitive and AmericanIndian excitement might easily be incorporated in a literary career. — I amconvinced now that no field but that of English literature would have permittedme the almost unlimited roaming about from this to that which I have beenenjoying. A science would buckle me down—and would probably yield no moreimportant fruit than literature may yield me! — If I want to justify myexistence, and continue to be obsessed with the notion that I've got to dosomething for humanity — well, teaching ought to quell that obsession — and if Ican ever get around to an intelligent view of matters, intelligent criticism ofcontemporary values ought to be useful to the world. This gets back again toKrishna's dictum: “ The best way to help mankind is through the perfection ofyourself.”His travels next carried him north to San Francisco, then back south to PacificGrove, where he spent the better part of a year in the company of Carol and JohnSteinbeck and marine biologist Ed Ricketts. During this time, he wrestled withhis writing, discovered the poems of Robinson Jeffers, first read OswaldSpengler's Decline of the West, and wrote to some seventy colleges anduniversities in an unsuccessful attempt to secure employment. Finally, he wasoffered a teaching position at the Canterbury School. He returned to the EastCoast, where he endured an unhappy year as a Canterbury housemaster, the onebright moment being when he sold his first short story (\"Strictly Platonic\") toLiberty magazine. Then, in 1933, he moved to a cottage without running water onMaverick Road in Woodstock NY, where he spent a year reading and writing. In1934, he was offered and accepted a position in the literature department atSarah Lawrence College, a post he would retain for thirty-eight years.Campbell and Jean Erdman on Honeymoon [../images/00007.jpeg]In 1938 he married one of his students, Jean Erdman, who would become a majorpresence in the emerging field of modern dance, first, as a star dancer inMartha Graham's fledgling troupe, and later, as dancer/choreographer of her owncompany.Even as he continued his teaching career, Joe's life continued to unfoldserendipitously. In 1940, he was introduced to Swami Nikhilananda, who enlistedhis help in producing a new translation of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna(published, 1942). Subsequently, Nikhilananda introduced Joe to the IndologistHeinrich Zimmer, who introduced him to a member of the editorial board at theBollingen Foundation. Bollingen, which had been founded by Paul and Mary Mellonto \"develop scholarship and research in the liberal arts and sciences and otherfields of cultural endeavor generally,\" was embarking upon an ambitiouspublishing project, the Bollingen Series. Joe was invited to contribute an\"Introduction and Commentary\" to the first Bollingen publication, Where the TwoCame to their Father: A Navaho War Ceremonial[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&JCComp&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=118],text and paintings recorded by Maud Oakes, given by Jeff King (Bollingen Series,I: 1943).When Zimmer died unexpectedly in 1943 at the age of fifty-two, his widow,Christiana, and Mary Mellon asked Joe to oversee the publication of hisunfinished works. Joe would eventually edit and complete four volumes fromZimmer's posthumous papers: Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization(Bollingen Series VI: 1946), The King and the Corpse (Bollingen Series XI:1948), Philosophies of India (Bollingen Series XXVI: 1951), and a two-volumeopus, The Art of Indian Asia (Bollingen Series XXXIX: 1955).Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson at work on A Skeleton Key to FinnegansWake, 1944 [../images/00008.jpeg]Joe, meanwhile, followed his initial Bollingen contribution with a \"FolkloristicCommentary\" to Grimm's Fairy Tales[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&JCComp&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=511](1944); he also co-authored (with Henry Morton Robinson) A Skeleton Key toFinnegans Wake[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&JCComp&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=3](1944), the first major study of James Joyce's notoriously complex novel.Hero with a Thousand Faces, 1st Edition [../images/00009.jpeg]His first, full-length, solo authorial endeavor, The Hero with a Thousand Faces[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&JCComp&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=101](Bollingen Series XVII: 1949), was published to acclaim and brought him thefirst of numerous awards and honors—the National Institute of Arts and LettersAward for Contributions to Creative Literature. In this study of the myth of thehero, Campbell posits the existence of a Monomyth (a word he borrowed from JamesJoyce), a universal pattern that is the essence of, and common to, heroic talesin every culture. While outlining the basic stages of this mythic cycle, he alsoexplores common variations in the hero's journey, which, he argues, is anoperative metaphor, not only for an individual, but for a culture as well. TheHero would prove to have a major influence on generations of creativeartists—from the Abstract Expressionists in the 1950s to contemporaryfilm-makers today—and would, in time, come to be acclaimed as a classic.Joe would eventually author dozens of articles and numerous other books,including The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&JCComp&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=217](Vol. 1: 1959), Oriental Mythology[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&JCComp&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=205](Vol. 2: 1962), Occidental Mythology[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&JCComp&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=194](Vol. 3: 1964), and Creative Mythology[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=83&JCComp&p9999_action=details&p9999_wid=183](Vol. 4: 1968); The Flight of the Wild Gander: Explorations in the MythologicalDimension (1969); Myths to Live By (1972); The Mythic Image (1974); The InnerReaches of Outer Space: Metaphor as Myth and as Religion (1986); and five booksin his four-volume, multi-part, unfinished Historical Atlas of World Mythology(1983-87).He was also a prolific editor. Over the years, he edited The Portable ArabianNights (1952) and was general editor of the series Man and Myth (1953-1954),which included major works by Maya Deren ( Divine Horsemen: the Living Gods ofHaiti, 1953), Carl Kerenyi ( The Gods of the Greeks, 1954), and Alan Watts (Myth and Ritual in Christianity, 1954). He also edited The Portable Jung (1972),as well as six volumes of Papers from the Eranos Yearbooks (Bollingen SeriesXXX): Spirit and Nature (1954), The Mysteries (1955), Man and Time (1957),Spiritual Disciplines (1960), Man and Transformation (1964), and The MysticVision (1969).But his many publications notwithstanding, it was arguably as a public speakerthat Joe had his greatest popular impact. From the time of his first publiclecture in 1940—a talk at the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center entitled \"SriRamakrishna's Message to the West\"—it was apparent that he was an erudite butaccessible lecturer, a gifted storyteller, and a witty raconteur. In the ensuingyears, he was asked more and more often to speak at different venues on varioustopics. In 1956, he was invited to speak at the State Department's ForeignService Institute; working without notes, he delivered two straight days oflectures. His talks were so well-received, he was invited back annually for thenext seventeen years. In the mid-1950s, he also undertook a series of publiclectures at the Cooper Union in New York City; these talks drew an ever-larger,increasingly diverse audience, and soon became a regular event.Joe first lectured at Esalen Institute in 1965. Each year thereafter, hereturned to Big Sur to share his latest thoughts, insights, and stories. And asthe years passed, he came to look forward more and more to his annual sojournsto the place he called \"paradise on the Pacific Coast.\" Although he retired fromteaching at Sarah Lawrence in 1972 to devote himself to his writing, hecontinued to undertake two month-long lecture tours each year.Joseph Campbell at work at home, 1985 [../images/00010.jpeg]In 1985, Joe was awarded the National Arts Club Gold Medal of Honor inLiterature. At the award ceremony, James Hillman remarked, \"No one in ourcentury—not Freud, not Thomas Mann, not Levi-Strauss—has so brought the mythicalsense of the world and its eternal figures back into our everydayconsciousness.\"Joseph Campbell died unexpectedly in 1987 after a brief struggle with cancer. In1988, millions were introduced to his ideas by the broadcast on PBS of JosephCampbell and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers, six hours of an electrifyingconversation that the two men had videotaped over the course of several years.When he died, Newsweek magazine noted that \"Campbell has become one of therarest of intellectuals in American life: a serious thinker who has beenembraced by the popular culture.\"In his later years, Joe was fond of recalling on how Schopenhauer, in his essayOn the Apparent Intention in the Fate of the Individual, wrote of the curiousfeeling one can have, of there being an author somewhere writing the novel ofour lives, in such a way that through events that seem to us to be chancehappenings there is actually a plot unfolding of which we have no knowledge.Looking back over Joe's life, one cannot help but feel that it proves the truthSchopenhauer's observation.For more information on the works of Joseph Campbell, click here[part0102.html].Open Circle Logo® [../images/00001.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"ABOUT JOSEPH CAMPBELL FOUNDATIONJoseph Campbell Foundation (JCF) is a not-for-profit corporation that continuesthe work of Joseph Campbell, exploring the fields of mythology and comparativereligion.
