He was at the opening of what would certainly have been the most productive period of his career. Two bins of notes and papers remained to testify to his rapidly maturing projects. The lectures that he had been delivering at Columbia University were roughly typed and arranged for conversion into books; a volume on Hindu medicine was half completed; an introduction to the study of Sanskrit had been outlined; a popular work on mythol- ogy had been begun. Scraps of paper, scribbled in German, Eng- lish, Sanskrit, and French, were sifted everywhere into the pages of his library and files, suggesting o,rticles to be written, research work to be accomplished, even excursions to be made to specific localities in India after the close of the war. He had quickly adapted himself to the ways of his new country and was fired with an eagerness to make his contribution to its intellectual heritage. Hardly had he begun to find his stride, however, when, suddenly stricken, he passed from full career to his death within seven days. The task of rescuing from oblivion as great a portion as possible of the abruptly interrupted labors was taken up immediately. MYTHS AND SYMBOLS IN INDIAN ART AND CIVILIZATION is a reworking of the lecture course delivered at Columbia University the winter term of I942. The typewritten notes had been supplemented in the classroom by impromptu amplifications and illustrated by a series of over two hundred V"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"lantern slides. Their transformation into a book demanded con- siderable recomposition, re-arrangement, abridgments and augmentation. Recollections of conversations with Dr. Zimmer supplied most of the materials for this reconstruction. Where such help was lacking, I turned to the authorities he most respected. Dr. Ananda K. Coomaraswamy very kindly supplied a number of supplementary notes to complete the work. His additions have been introduced in square brackets and initialed AKCi un- doubtedly they would have met with the approval of Dr. Zimmer. I am indebted to Dr. Coomaraswamy, also, for the print of Fig- ure 55, and for many indispensable emendations throughout the length of the text. Since Dr. Zimmer had no need to fill his private papers with such annotations, credits, and references as are necessary to a published volume, a complicated task confronted the editor when it came to tracking down the sources of the numerous myths and illustrations. For valuable assistance I wish to thank Dr. Marguerite Block of Columbia University, who helped select, arrange, and identify the pictures, and who read an early draft of the manuscripti Mr. and Mrs. Nasli Heeramaneck, who enabled me to discover the sources of many of the photographsi Dr. David Friedman, formerly of the University of Leyden, whose suggestions guided me to the Sanskrit originals of several of the mythsi and Mrs. Peter Geiger, who performed a large por- tion of the actual work of research, labored on the manuscript and proofs, and took charge of a cumbersome burden of details. Swami Nikhilananda opened his library and aided with advice. Mrs. Margaret Wing reviewed the last two drafts of the manu- script, prepared the index, and assisted with the proofs. Without the generous co-operation of these friends, the work would not have been accomplished. J.C.

The Parade of Ants INDRA slew the dragon, a giant titan that had been couching on the mountains in the limbless shape of a cloud serpent, holding the waters of heaven captive in its belly. The god flung his thunderbolt into the midst of the ungainly coils; the monster shattered like a stack of withered rushes. The waters burst free and streamed in ribbons across the land, to circulate once more through the body of the world. This flood is the flood of life and belongs to all. It is the sap of field and forest, the blood coursing in the veins. The monster had appropriated the common benefit, massing his ambitious, selfish hulk between heaven and earth, but now was slain. The juices ~were pouring. The titans were retreating to the under- Yt ~~l~; the gods were returning to the summit of the central mountain of the earth, there to reign from on high. .-/ During the period of the supremacy of the dragon, the majestic mansions of the lofty city of the gods had cracked and crumbled. The first act of Indra was to rebuild them. All the divinities of the heavens were acclaiming him their savior. Greatly elated in his triumph and in the knowledge of his strength, he summoned Vishvakarman, the god of arts and crafts, and commanded him to erect such a palace as should befit the unequaled splendor of the king of the gods. The miraculous genius, Vishvakarman, succeeded in construct- ing in a single year a shining residence, marvelous with palaces"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"and gardens, lakes and towers. But as the work progressed, the demands of Indra became even more exacting and his unfolding visions vaster. He required additional terraces and pavilions, more ponds, groves, and pleasure grounds. Whenever Indra ar- rived to appraise the work, he developed vision beyond vision of marvels remaining to be contrived. Presently the divine crafts- man, brought to despair, decided to seek succor from above. He would turn to the demiurgic creator, Brahma, the pristine embodiment of the Universal Spirit, who abides far above the troubled Olympian sphere of ambition, strife, and glory. When Vishvakarman secretly resorted to the higher throne and presented his case, Brahma comforted the petitioner. \"You will soon be relieved of your burden,\" he said. \"Go home in peace.\" Then, while Vishvakarman was hurrying down again to the city of Indra, Brahma himself ascended to a still higher sphere. He came before Vishnu, the Supreme Being, of whom he himself, the Creator, was but an agent. In beatific silence Vishnu gave ear, and by a mere nod of the head let it be known that the request of Vishvakarman would be fulfilled. Early next morning a brahmin boy, carrying the staff of a pilgrim, made his appearance at the gate of Indra, bidding the porter announce his visit to the king. The gate-man hurried to the master, and the master hastened to the entrance to welcome in person the auspicious guest. The boy was slender, some ten years old, radiant with the luster of wisdom. Indra discovered him amidst a cluster of enraptured, staring children. The boy greeted the host with a gentle glance of his dark and brilliant eyes. The king bowed to the holy child and the boy cheerfully gave his blessing. The two retired to the hall of Indra, where the god cere- moniously proffered welcome to his guest with oblations of honey, milk, and fruits, then said: \"0 Venerable Boy, tell me of the purpose of your coming.\" The beautiful child replied with a voice that was as deep and soft as the slow thundering of auspicious rain clouds. \"0 King of 4"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Gods, I have heard of the mighty palace you are building, and have come to refer to you the questions in my mindt How many years will it require to complete this rich and extensive residence? What further feats of engineering will Vishvakarman be expected to accomplish? 0 Highest of the Gods,\"-the boy's luminous fea- tures moved with a gentle, scarcely perceptible smile-uno Indra before you has ever succeeded in completing such a palace as yours is to be.\" Full of the wine of triumph, the king of the gods was enter- tained by this mere boy's pretension to a knowledge of Indras earlier than himself. With a fatherly smile he put the question: \"Tell me, Child I Are they then so very many, the Indras and Vishvakarmans whom you have seen-or at least, whom you have heard of?\" The wonderful guest calmly nodded. uYes, indeed, many have I seen.\" The voice was as warm and sweet as milk fresh from the cow, but the words sent a slow chill through Indra's veins. \"My dear child,\" the boy continued,~'I knew your father, Kash- yapa, the Old Tortoise Man, lord and progenitor of all the crea- tures of the earth. And I knew your grandfather, Marichi, Beam of Celestial Light, who was the son of Brahma.. Marichi was be- gotten of the god Brahma.'s pure spirit; his only wealth and glory were his sanctity and devotion. Also, I know Brahma., brought forth by Vishnu from the lotus calix growing from Vishnu's navel. And Vishnu himself-the Supreme Being, supporting Brahm in his creative endeavor-him too I know) \"0 King of Gods, I have known the dreadful dissolution of the universe. I have seen all perish, again and again, at the end of every cycle. At that terrible time, every single atom dissolves into the primal, pure waters of eternity, whence originally all arose. Everything then goes back into the fathomless, wild in- finity of the ocean, which is covered with utter darkness and is empty of every sign of animate being. Ah, who will count the universes that have passed away, or the creations that have risen"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"a&esh. again and again. &om the formless abyss of the vast waters? Who will number the passing ages of the world. as they follow each other endlessly? And who will search through the wide in- finities of space to count the universes side by side. each contain- ing its Brahm. its Vishnu, and its Shiva? Who will count the Indras in them all-those Indras side by side, who reign at once in all the innumerable worlds; those others who passed away before them; or even the Indras who succeed each other in any given line, ascending to godly kingship. one by one, and. one by one, passing away? King of Gods, there are among your servants certain who maintain that it may be possible to num- ber the grains of sand on earth and the drops of rain that fall &om the sky, but no one will ever number all those Indras. This is what the Knowers know. \"The life and kingship of an Indra endure seventy-one eons. and when twenty-eight Indras have expired, one Day and Night of Brahma has elapsed. But the existence of one Brahma, meas- ured in such Brahma Days and Nights, is only one hundred and eight years. Brahma follows Brahma; one sinks, the next arises; the endless series cannot be told. There is no end to the number of those Brahmas-to say nothing of Indras. \"But the universes side by side at any given moment, each harboring a Brahma and an Indra: who will estimate the num- ber of these? Beyond the farthest vision, crowding outer space. the universes come and go. an innumerable host. Like delicate boats they float on the fathomless, pure waters that form the body of Vishnu. Out of every hair-pore of that body a universe bubbles and breaks. Will you presume to count them? Will you number the gods in all those worlds-the worlds present and the worlds past?\" A procession of ants had made its appearance in the hall dur- ing the discourse of the boy. In military array, in a column four yards wide. the tribe paraded across the floor. The boy noted them, paused. and stared, then suddenly laughed with an aston· 6"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ishing peal, but immediately subsided into a poofoundly in- drawn and thoughtful silence. \"Why do you laugh?\" stammered Indra. \"Who are you, mys- terious being, under this deceiving guise of a boy?\" The proud king's throat and lips had gone dry, and his voice continually broke. \"Who are you, Ocean of Virtues, enshrouded in delud· ing mist?\" The magnificent boy resumed: \"I laughed because of the ants. The reason is not to be told. Do not ask me to disclose it. The seed of woe and the fruit of wisdom are enclosed within this secret. It is the secret that smites with an ax the tree of worldly vanity, hews away its roots, and scatters its crown. This secret is a lamp to those groping in ignorance. This secret lies buried in the wisdom of the ages, and is rarely revealed even to saints. This secret is the living air of those ascetics who renounce and tran- scend mortal existence; but worldlings, deluded by desire and pride, it destroys.\" The boy smiled and sank into silence. Indra regarded him, unable to move. \"0 Son of a Brahmin,\" the king pleaded pres- ently, with a new and visible humility, \"I do not know who you are. You would seem to be Wisdom Incarnate. Reveal to me this secret of the ages, this light that dispels the dark.\" Thus requested to teach, the boy opened to the god the hid- den wisdom. \"I saw the ants, 0 Indra, filing in long parade. Each was once an Indra. Like you, each by virtue of pious deeds once ascended to the rank of a king of gods. But now, through many rebirths, each has become again an ant. This army is an army of former Indras. \"Piety and high deeds elevate the inhabitants of the world to the glorious realm of the celestial mansions, or to the higher domains of Brahma and Shiva and to the highest sphere of Vishnu; but wicked acts sink them into the worlds beneath, into pits of pain and sorrow, involving reincarnation among birds and vermin, or out of the wombs of pigs and animals of the wild, 7"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"or among trees, or among insects. It is by deeds that one merits happiness or anguish, and becomes a master or a serf. It is by • deeds that one attains to the rank of a king or brahmin, or of some god, or of an Indra or a Brahmii. And through deeds again, one contracts disease, acquires beauty and deformity, or is re- born in the condition of a monster. \"This is the whole substance of the secret. This wisdom is the ferry to beatitude across the ocean of hell. \"Life in the cycle of the countless rebirths is like a vision in a dream. The gods on high, the mute trees and the stones, are alike apparitions in this phantasy. But Death administers the law of time. Ordained by time, Death is the master of all. Perish- able as bubbles are the good and the evil of the beings of the dream. In unending cycles the good and evil alternate. Hence, the wise are attached to neither, neither the evil nor the good. The wise are not attached to anything at all.\" The boy concluded the appalling lesson and quietly regarded his host. The king of gods, for all his celestial splendor, had been reduced in his own regard to insignificance. Meanwhile, another amazing apparition had entered the hall. The newcomer had the appearance of a kind of hermit. His head was piled with matted hair; he wore a black deerskin around his loins; on his forehead was painted a white mark; his head was shaded by a paltry parasol of grass; and a quaint, circular cluster of hair grew on his chest: it was intact at the circumfer- ence, but from the center many of the hairs, it seemed, had disappeared. This saintly figure strode directly to Indra and the boy, squatted between them on the floor, and there remained, motionless as a rock. The kingly Indra, somewhat recovering his hostly role, bowed and paid obeisance, offering sour milk with honey and other refreshments; then he inquired, falteringly but reverently, after the welfare of the stem guest, and bade him welcome. Whereupon the boy addressed the holy man, asking the very questions Indra himself would have proposed. 8"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"\"Whence do you come, 0 Holy Man? What is your name and ,. what brings you to this place? Where is your present home, and what is the meaning of this grass parasol? What is the portent of that circular hair-tuft on your chest: why is it dense at the circumference but at the center almost bare? Be kind enough, o Holy Man, to answer, in brief, these questions. 1 am anxious to understand.\" Patiently the old saint smiled, and slowly began his reply. \"I am a brahmin. Hairy is my name. And 1 have come here to be- hold Indra. Since 1 know that 1 am short-lived, 1 have decided to possess no home, to build no house, and neither to marry nor to seek a livelihood. 1 exist by begging alms. To shield myself from sun and rain 1 carry over my head this parasol of grass. \"As to the circle of hair on my chest, it is a source of grief to the children of the world. Nevertheless, it teaches wisdom. With the fall of an Indra, one hair drops. That is why, in the center all the hairs have gone. When the other half of the period allotted to the present Brahma will have expired, 1 myself shall die. 0 Brahmin Boy, it follows that 1 am somewhat short of days; what, therefore, is the use of a wife and a son, or of a house? \"Each flicker of the eyelids of the great Vishnu registers the passing of a Brahma. Everything below that sphere of Brahma is as insubstantial as a cloud taking shape and again dissolving. That is why 1 devote myself exclusively to meditating on the incomparable lotus-feet of highest Vishnu. Faith in Vishnu is more than the bliss of redemption; for every joy, even the heav- enly, is as fragile as a dream, and only interferes with the one- pointedness of our faith in Him Supreme. \"Shiva, the peace-bestowing, the highest spiritual guide, taught me this wonderful wisdom. 1 do not crave to experience the various blissful forms of redemption: to share the highest god's supernal mansions and enjoy his eternal presence, or to be like him in body and apparel, or to become a part of his august sub- stance, or even to be absorbed wholly in his ineffable essence.\" 9"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Abruptly, the holy man ceased and immediately vanished. It had been the god Shiva himself; he had now retumed to his supramundane abode. Simultaneously, the brahmin boy, who had been Vishnu, disappeared as well. The king was alone, baf- fled and amazed. The king, Indra, pondered; and the events seemed to him to have been a dream. But he no longer felt any desire to magnify his heavenly splendor or to go on with the construction of his palace. He summoned Vishvakarman. Graciously greeting the craftsman with honeyed words, he heaped on him jewels and precious gifts, then with a sumptuous celebration sent him home. The king, Indra, now desired redemption. He had acquired wisdom, and wished only to be free. He entrusted the pomp and burden of his office to his son, and prepared to retire to the her- mit life of the wilderness. Whereupon his beautiful and passion- ate queen, Shachi, was overcome with grief. Weeping, in sorrow and utter despair, Shachi resorted to In- dra's ingenious house-priest and spiritual advisor, the Lord of Magic Wisdom, Brihaspati. Bowing at his feet, she implored him to divert her husband's mind from its stern resolve. The resource- ful counselor of the gods, who by his spells and devices had helped the heavenly powers wrest the govemment of the uni- verse from the hands of their titan rivals, listened thoughtfully to the complaint of the voluptuous, disconsolate goddess, and knowingly nodded assent. With a wizard's smile, he took her hand and conducted her to the presence of her spouse. In the role, then, of spiritual teacher, he discoursed sagely on the vir- tues of the spiritual life, but on the virtues also, of the secular. He gave to each its due. Very skillfully he developed his theme. The royal pupil was persuaded to relent in his extreme resolve. The queen was restored to radiant joy.

It would not do to seek to constrain the Oriental conceptions into the delim- iting frames familiar to the West. Their profound strangeness must be permitted to expose to us the unconscious limitations of our own approach to the enigmas of existence and of man. The wonderful story of the Parade of Ants opens before us an unfamiliar spectacle of space and throbs with an alien pulse of time. Notions of space and time are commonly taken for granted within the pale of a given tradition and civilization. Their validity is seldom discussed or questioned, even by peo- ple who sharply disagree on social, political, and moral issues. They appear to be inevitable, colorless and unimportant; for we move through and are carried on by them, as the fish by water. We are contained within and caught by them, unaware of their specific character, because our knowledge does not reach beyond them. Hence, the time and space conceptions of India will at first seem to us of the West unsound and bizarre. The fundamentals of the Western view are so close to our eyes that they escape OUf criticism. They are of the texture of our experience and reac- tions.

The wheel of birth and death, the round of emanation, fruition, dissolution, and re-emanation, is a com- monplace of popular speech as well as a fundamental theme of philosophy, myth and symbol, religion, politics and art. It is un- derstood as applying not only to the life of the individual, but to the history of society and the course of the cosmos. Every mOo i ment of existence is measured and judged against the backdrop i of this pleroma.) I According tel the mythologies of Hinduism, each ~~ycle i~divided into four yugas or world ages. These are co~ rable to the four ages of the Greco-Roman tradition, and, like the latter, decline in moral excellence as the round proceeds. The Classical ages took their names from the metals, Gold, Sil- ver, Brass, and Iron, the Hindu from the four throws of the In- dian dice game, Krita, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali. In both cases the appellations suggest the relative virtues of the periods, as they succeed each other in a slow, irreversible procession. 1 Krita is the perfect participle of the verb kri, to do; it means, literally, \"done, made, accomplished, perfect.\" This is the dice- throw that wins the jackpot, the total gain. According to the In- dian conception, the idea of total, or totality, is associated with the number four. \"Four square\" signifies \"totality.\" Anything complete and self-contained is conceived as possessing all of its four \"quarters\" (piida). It is established firmly on its \"four legs\" (catulJ.-piida). Thus, Krita Yuga, the first of the ages, is the per- fect, or \"four-quartered,\" yuga. Dharma, the moral order of the world (which is in virtual existence before the beginning, but then becomes manifest in the spheres, energies, and beings of the world), is during this period firm on its four legs, like a sacred cow; one hundred percent, or four quarters, effective as an all-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"pervading structural element in the organism of the universe. During this yuga men and women are born virtuous. They de- vote their lives to the fulfillment of the duties and tasks divinely ordained by Dharma.· The brahmins are established in saintli- ness. Kings and feudal chiefs act according to the ideals of truly royal conduct. The peasants and townsfolk are devoted to hus- bandry and the crafts. The lower, servile classes abide lawfully in submission. People even of the lowest extraction observe the holy order of life. As the life-process of the world-organism gains momentum, however, order loses ground. Holy Dharma vanishes quarter by quarter, while its converse gains the field. Treta Yuga is there- fore named after the dice-cast of the three. Treta is the triad or triplet; three of the quarters. Etymologically, the word is re- lated to the Latin tres, Greek treis, English three. During Treta Yuga, the universal body, as well as the body of human society, is sustained by only three fourths of its total virtue. The modes of life proper to the four castes have begun to lapse into decay. Duties are no longer the spontaneous laws of human action, but have to be learned. Dvapara Yuga is the age of the dangerous balance between imperfection and perfection, darkness and light. Its name is de- rived from dvi, dva, dvau, meaning \"two\" (compare the Latin duo, French deux, English deuce, Greek duo, Russian dva). This is the dice-cast of the duad.

True saintliness, to be achieved only through devotional observances, vows, fasting and ascetic practices, becomes extinct. Finally, Kali Yuga, the dark age, miserably subsists on twenty- five percent of the full strength of Dharma. Egoistic, devouring, blind and reckless elements now are triumphant and rule the day. Kali means the worst of anything; also, \"strife, quarrel, dis- sension, war, battle\" (being related to kal-aha, \"strife, quarrel\"). In the dice-play, kali is the losing throw. During the Kali Yuga, man and his world are at their very worst. The moral and social degradation is characterized in a passage of the Vishnu Purina:· \"When society reaches a stage, where property confers rank, wealth becomes the only source of virtue, passion the sole bond of union between husband and wife, falsehood the source of suc- cess in life, sex the only means of enjoyment, and when outer trappings are confused with inner religion . . .\" -then we are in the Kali Yuga, the world of today.

It should be observed that the traditional texts allude only very seldom to the fact that the mythological events which they are describing and extolling take place again and again, recur- ring every four billion three hundred and twenty million years, i.e., once every kalpa.

From the human standpoint the lifetime of a Brahma seems to be very lengthy; nevertheless it is limited. It endures for only one hundred Brahma years of Brahma days and nights, and con- cludes with a great, or universal, dissolution. Then vanish not only the visible spheres of the three worlds (earth, heaven and the space between), but all spheres of being whatsoever, even those of the highest worlds. All become resolved into the divine, primeval Substance. A state of total re-absorption then prevails for another Brahma century, after which the entire cycle of 311,- 040,000,000,000 human years begins anew. The Wisdom of Life IT is easy for us to forget that our strictly linear, evolutionary idea of time (apparently substantiated by geology, paleontology, and the history of civilization) is something peculiar to modern man. Even the Greeks of the day of Plato and Aristotle, who were much nearer than the Hindus to our ways of thought and feel- ing and to our actual tradition, did not share it. Indeed, Saint Augustine seems to have been the first to conceive of this modern idea of time. His conception established itself only gradually in opposition to the notion formerly current. The Augustinian Society has published a paper by Erich Frank,· in which it is pointed out that both Aristotle and PlatG believed that every art and science had many times developed to its apogee and then perished. \"These philosophers,\" writet • E. Frank, Saint Augustine and Gred Thought (The Augustinian Society, Cam· bridge, Mass., 1941, obtainable from The Harvard Cooperative Society), see pp. 9.10."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Frank, \"believed that even their own ideas were only the redis- covery of thoughts which had been known to the philosophers of previous periods.\" This belief corresponds precisely to the Indian tradition of a perennial philosophy, an ageless wisdom revealed and re-revealed, restored, lost, and again restored through the cycles of the ages. \"Human life,\" Frank declares, \"to Augustine was not merely a process of nature. It was a unique, unrepeat- able phenomenon; it had an individual history in which every- thing that happened was new and had never been before. Such a conception of history was unknown to the Greek philosophers. The Greeks had great historians who investigated and described the history of their times; but • • • the history of the universe they considered as a natural process in which everything recurred in periodical circles, so that nothing really new ever happened.\" This is precisely the idea of time underlying Hindu mythology and life. The history of the universe in its periodic passage from evolution to dissolution is conceived as a biological process of gradual and relentless deterioration, disintegration, and decay. Only after everything has run its course into total annihilation and been then re-incubated in the boundlessness of the timeless cosmic night, does the universe reappear in perfection, pristine, beautiful, and reborn. Whereupon, immediately, with the first tick of time, the irreversible process begins anew. The perfection of life, the human capacity to apprehend and assimilate ideals of highest saintliness and selfless purity-in other words the di- vine quality or energy of Dharma-is in a continuous decline. And during the process the strangest histories take place; yet nothing that has not, in the endless wheelings of the eons, hap- pened many, many times before. This vast time-consciousness, transcending the brief span of the individual, even the racial biography, is the time-conscious- ness of Nature herself.

India-as Life brooding on itself-thinks of the problem of time in periods comparable to those of our astronomy, geology. and paleontology. India thinks of time and of herself, that is to say. in biological terms. terms of the species. not of the ephemeral ego. The latter becomes old: the former is old. and therewith eternally young. We of the West on the other hand, regard world history as a biography of mankind. and in particular of Occidental Man. whom we estimate to be the most consequential member of the family. Biography is that form of seeing and representing which concentrates on the unique, the induplicable. in any portion of existence. and then brings out the sense-and-direction-giving traits. We think of egos, individuals, lives. not of Life. Our will is not to culminate in our human institutions the universal play of nature, but to evaluate, to set ourselves against the play, with an egocentric tenacity. As yet our physical and biological sciences -which, of course, are comparatively young-have not affected the general tenor of our traditional humanism. So little. indeed, are we aware of their possible philosophical implications (aside from the lesson of \"progress\" which we like to derive from their account of evolution) that when we encounter something of their kind in the mythological eons of the Hindus. we are left, emo- tionally, absolutely cold. We are unable, we are not prepared. to fill the monstrous yugas with life significance. Our conception of the long geological ages that preceded the human habitation of the planet and are promised to succeed it, and our astronomi- cal figures for the description of outer space and the passages of the stars, may in some measure have prepared us to conceive of the mathematical reaches of the vision; but we can scarcely feel their pertinence to a practical philosophy of human life. It was consequently a great experience for me, when, while reading one of the Purinas. I chanced upon the brilliant, anony- 21"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"mous myth recounted at the opening of the present chapter. Suddenly the empty sheaves of numbers were filled with the dynamism of life. They became alive with philosophical value and symbolic significance. So vivid was the statement, so power- ful the impact, that the story did not have to be dissected for its meaning. The lesson was plain to see. The two great gods, Vishnu and Shiva, instruct the human hearers of the myth by teaching Indra, king of the Olympians. The Wonderful Boy, solving riddles and pouring out wisdom from his childish lips, is an archetypal figure, common to fairy tales of all ages and many traditions. He is an aspect of the Boy Hero, who solves the riddle of the Sphinx and rids the world of monsters. Likewise an archetypal figure is the Old Wise Man, beyond ambitions and the illusions of ego, treasuring and im- parting the wisdom that sets free, shattering the bondage of possessions, the bondage of suffering and desire. But the wisdom taught in this myth would have been incom- plete had the last word been that of the infinity of space and time. The vision of the countless universes bubbling into exist- ence side by side, and the lesson of the unending series of Indras and Brahmas, would have annihilated every value of individual existence. Between this boundless, breath-taking vision and the opposite problem of the limited role of the short-lived individual, this myth effected the rt--establishment of a balance. Brihaspati, ~e high priest and spiritual guide of the gods, who is Hindu wisdom incarnate, teaches Indra (i.e., ourself, the individual con- fused) how to grant to each sphere its due. We are taught to recognize the divine, the impersonal sphere of eternity, revolv- ing ever and agelessly through time. But we are also taught to esteem the transient sphere of the duties and pleasures of in- dividual existence, which is as real and as vital to the living man, as a dream to the sleeping soul."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"• CHAPTER TWO THE MYTHOLOGY OF VISHNU I. Vishnu's Maya THE vision of endless repetition and aimless reproduction mini- mized and finally annihilated the victorious Indra's naive con- ception of himself and of the permanence of his might.

But as the cycles of the vision expanded, levels of consciousness opened in which millenniums dwindled to moments, eons to days.

The burdens and delights, pos- sessions and bereavements of the ego, the whole content and the work of the human lifetime, dissolved into unreality.

The transformation was effected by a shift in Indra's point of view. With the enlargement of the perspective every aspect of life shifted value. It was as though the mountains-permanent when considered from the standpoint of our brief human span of some seven decades-should be beheld, all at once, from the perspective of as many millenniums.

But the gods are themselves the productions of a greater maya: the spontaneous self-transformation of an orig- inally undifferentiated, all-generating divine Substance. And this greater maya produces, not the gods alone, but the universe in which they operate. All the universes co-existing in space and succeeding each other in time, the planes of being and the crea- tures of those planes whether natural or supernatural, are mani- festations from an inexhaustible, original and eternal well of being, and are made manifest by a play of maya. In the period of non-manifestation, the interlude of the cosmic night, maya ceases to operate and the display dissolves. Maya is Existence: both the world of which we are aware, and ourselves who are contained in the growing and dissolving en- vironment, growing and dissolving in our tum. At the same time, Maya is the supreme power that generates and animates the dis- play: the dynamic aspect of the universal Substance. Thus it is at once, effect (the cosmic fl.ux), and cause (the creative power). In the latter regard it is known as Shakti, \"Cosmic Energy.\" The noun sakti is from the root sak, signifying \"to be able, to be pos- sible.\" Sakti is \"power, ability, capacity, faculty, strength, energy, prowess; regal power; the power of composition, poetic power, genius; the power or signification of a word or term; the power inherent in cause to produce its necessary effect; an iron spear, lance, pike, dart; a sword\"; sakti is the female organ; sakti is the active power of a deity and is regarded, mythologically, as his goddess-consort and queen.

Now the character of Maya-Shakti-Devi (devi = \"goddess\") is multifariously ambiguous. Having mothered the universe and the individual (macro- and microcosm) as correlative manifesta- tions of the divine, Maya then immediately muffles conscious- ness within the wrappings of her perishable production. The ego is entrapped in a web, a queer cocoon. \"All this around me,\" and \"my own existence\" -experience without and experience within-are the warp and woof of the subtle fabric.

The aim of Indian thought has always been to learn the secret of the entanglement, and, if possible, to cut through into a reality outside and beneath the emotional and intellectual convolu- tions that enwrap our conscious being.

The tales have been handed down in a great tradition of oral communication; they appear today in many variants. A vast number of these variants have become fixed in literary renderings; others continue in the fluid form of unwritten folklore. The story is told of a semi-divine ascetic, Narada, who once demanded directly of the Supreme Being to be taught the secret of his Maya. This Narada, in the mythology of Hinduism, is a favorite model of the devotee on the \"path of devotion\" (bhakti- mtirga).- In response to his prolonged and fervent austerity, Vishnu had appeared to him in his hermitage, and granted the fulfilment of a wish. When he humbly expressed his profound desire, the god instructed him, not with words, but by subject- ing him to a harrowing adventure.

It is presented as recounted by a saint named Vyasa. A group of holy men had gathered around the venerable her- mit, Vyasa, in his forest-solitude. \"You understand the divine eternal order,\" they had said to him, \"therefore, unveil to us the secret of Vishnu's Maya.\" \"Who can comprehend the Maya of the Highest God, except himself? Vishnu's Maya lays its spell on us all. Vishnu's Maya is our collective dream. I can only recite to you a tale, coming down from the days of yore, of how this Maya in a specific, sin- gularly instructive instance worked its effect.\" The visitors were eager to hear. Vyasa began: \"Once upon a time, there lived a young prince, Kamadamana, 'Tamer of Desires,' who, conducting himself in accordance with the spirit of his name, spent his life practicing the sternest of ascetic austerities. But his father, wishing him to marry, ad- dressed him on a certain occasion in the following words: 'Kama- damana, my son, what is the matter with you? Why do you not take to yourself a wife? Marriage brings the fulfilment of all of a man's desires and the attainment of perfect happiness. Women are the very root of happiness and well-being. Therefore, go, my dear son, and marry.' \"The youth remained silent, out of respect for his father. But when the king then insisted and repeatedly urged him, Kamada- mana replied, 'Dear father, I adhere to the line of conduct desig- nated by my name. The divine power of Vishnu, which sustains and holds enmeshed both ourselves and everything in the world, has been revealed to me.' \"The royal father paused only a moment to reconsider the case, and then adroitly shifted his argument from the appeal of personal pleasure to that of duty. A man should marry, he de- clared, to beget offspring-so that his ancestral spirits in the 28"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"realm of the fathers should not lack the food-offerings of de- scendants and decline into indescribable misery and despair • .. 'My dear parent,' said the youth, 'I have passed through lives by the thousand. 1 have suffered death and old age many hundreds of times. 1 have known union with wives, and bereave- ment. 1 have existed as grass and as shrubs, as creepers and as trees. 1 have moved among cattle and the beasts of prey.

No one has ever comprehended it. There will never be anyone ca- pable of penetrating to its secret. Long, long ago, there lived a godlike holy seer, Narada by name, and he was a direct son of the god Brahma himself, full of fervent devotion to me. Like you, he merited my grace, and I appeared before him, just as I am appearing now to you. I granted him a boon, and he uttered the wish that you have uttered. Then, though I warned him not to inquire further into the secret of my Maya, he insisted, just like you. And I said to him: 'Plunge into yonder water, and you shall experience the secret of my Maya.' Narada dived into the pond. He emerged again-in the shape of a girl. ~\"C:Narada stepped out of the water as Sushila, 'The Virtuous One,' the daughter of the king of Benares. And presently, when she was in the prime of her youth, her father bestowed her in marriage on the son of the neighboring king of Vidarbha. The holy seer and ascetic, in the form of a girl, fully experienced the delights of love. In due time, then, the old king of Vidarbha died, and Sushila's husband succeeded to the throne. The beau- tiful queen had many sons and grandsons, and was incomparably happy . .. , \"However, in the long course of time, a feud broke out be- tween Sushila's husband and her father, and this developed pres- ently into a furious war. In a single mighty battle many of her sons and grandsons, her father, and her husband all were slain. And when she learned of the holocaust she proceeded in sorrow from the capital to the battlefield, there to lift a solemn lament. And she ordered a gigantic funeral pyre and placed upon it the dead bodies of her relatives, her brothers, sons, nephews, and grandsons, and then, side by side, the bodies of her husband and her father.

Narada stood confounded and ashamed. The god continued: 'This is the semblance of my Maya, woeful, som- ber, accursed. Not the lotus-born Brahma, nor any other of the gods, Indra, nor even Shiva, can fathom its depth less depth. Why or how should you know this inscrutable?' \" , \"Narada prayed that he should be granted perfect faith and devotion, and the grace to remember this experience for all time to come. Furthermore, he asked that the pond into which he had entered, as into a source of initiation, should become a holy place of pilgrimage, its water-thanks to the everlasting secret pres- ence therein of the god who had entered to le~d forth the saint from the magic depth-endowed with the power to wash away all sin. Vishnu granted the pious wishes and forthwith, on the instant, disappeared, withdrawing to his cosmic abode in the Milky Ocean.\" \" 'I have told you this tale,' concluded Vishnu, before he with- drew likewise from the ascetic, Sutapas, 'in order to teach you that the secret of my Maya is inscrutable and not to be known. If you so desire, you too may plunge into the water, and you will know why this is so.' \"Whereupon Sutapas (or Prince Kamadamana in his next to last incarnation) dived into the water of the pond.

Through prolonged austerities and devo- tional practices, he had won the grace of Vishnu. The god had appeared before the saint in his hermitage and granted him the fulfilment of a wish. \"Show me the magic power of your Maya,\" Narada had prayed, and the god had replied, \"I will. Come with me\"; but again with that ambiguous smile on his beautifully curved lips. From the pleasant shadow of the sheltering hermit grove, Vishnu conducted Narada across a bare stretch of land which blazed like metal under the merciless glow of a scorching sun. The two were soon very thirsty. At some distance, in the glar- ing light, they perceived the thatched roofs of a tiny hamlet. Vishnu asked: \"Will you go over there and fetch me some water?\" \"~ertainly, 0 Lord,\" the saint replied, and he made off to the distant group of huts. The god relaxed under the shadow of a cliff, to await his return. ( When Naradareached the hamlet, he knocked at the first door. A beautif~aiden opened to him and the holy man experi- enced something of which he had never up to that time dreamed: the enchantment of her eyes. They resembled those of his divine Lord and friend. He stood and gazed. He simply forgot what he had come for. The girl, gentle and candid, bade him wel- come. Her voice was a golden noose about his neck. As though moving in a vision, he entered the door.;> The occupants of the house were full of respect for him, yet not the least bit shy. He was honorably received, as a holy man, yet somehow not as a stranger; rather, as an old and venerable acquaintance who had been a long time away. Narada remained with them impressed by their cheerful and noble bearing, and feeling entirely at home. Nobody asked him what he had come • The Sayings of Sri Ramakrishna (Mylaporc, Madras, 1958), Book IV, Chapter II."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"for; he seemed to have belonged to the family from time im- memorial. And after a certain period, he asked the father for permlssion to marry the girl, which was no more than everyone in the house had been expecting. He became a member of the family and shared with them the age-old burdens and simple de- lights of a peasant household. Twelve years passed; he had three children. When his father- in-law died he became head of the household, inheriting the estate and managing it, tending the cattle and cultivating the fields. The twelfth year, the rainy season was extraordinarily violent: the streams swelled, torrents poured down the hills, and the little village was inundated by a sudden flood. In the night, the straw huts and cattle were carried away and everybody fled. With one hand supporting his wife, with the other leading two of his children, and bearing the smallest on his shoulder, Narada set forth hastily. Forging ahead through the pitch dark- ness and lashed by the rain, he waded through slippery mud, staggered through whirling waters. The burden was more than he could manage with the current heavily dragging at his legs~ Once, when he stumbled, the child slipped from his shoulder and disappeared in the roaring night. With a desperate cry, Narada let go the older children to catch at the smallest, but was too late. Meanwhile the flood swiftly carried off the other two, and even before he could realize the disaster, ripped from his side his wife, swept his own feet from under him and flung him headlong in the torrent like a log. Unconscious, Narada was stranded eventually on a little cliff. When he returned to consciousness, he opened his eyes upon a vast sheet of muddy water. He could only weep. \"Childl\" He heard a familiar voice, which nearly stopped his heart. \"Where is the water you went to fetch for me? I have been waiting more than half an hour.\" Narada turned around. Instead of water he beheld the bril- 83"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"liant desert in the midday sun. He found the god standing at his shoulder. The cruel curves of the fascinating mouth, still smiling, parted with the gentle question: \"Do you comprehend now the secret of my Maya?\" From the period of the early Vedas down to the Hinduism of the present, water has been regarded in India as a tangible mani- festation of the divine essence. \"In the beginning, everything was like a sea without alight,\" declares an ancient hymn;· and to this day, one of the most common and simple objects of wor- ship in the daily ritual is a jar or pitcher filled with water, rep- resenting the presence of the divinity and serving in the place of a sacred image. The water is regarded, for the period of the worship, as a residence or seat (pitha) of the god. In our two stories of N arada the significant trait was the trans- formation worked by the waters. This was to be read as an operation of Maya; for the waters are understood as a primary materialization of Vishnu's Maya-energy. They are the life- maintaining element that circulates through nature in the forms of rain, sap, milk, and blood. They are substance endowed with the power of fluidal change. Therefore, in the symbolism of the myths, to dive into water means to delve into the mystery of Maya, to quest after the ultimate secret of life. When Narada, the human disciple, asked to be taught this secret, the god did not disclose the answer by any verbal instruction or formula. In- stead, he simply pointed to water, as to the element of initiation. Boundless and imperishable, the cosmic waters are at once the immaculate source of all things and the dreadful grave. Through a power of self-transformation, the energy of the abyss puts forth, or assumes, individualized forms endowed with tem- porary life and limited ego-consciousness. For a time it nourishes and sustains these with a vivifying sap. Then it dissolves them again, without mercy or distinction, back into the anonymou& • .flig Veda, X. 119.!!.

That is the work, that is the char- acter, of Maya, the all-consuming, universal womb. This ambivalence of the dreadful-yet-benign is a dominant trait in all Hindu symbolism and mythology. It is essential to the Hindu concept of divinity. Not alone the Supreme Godhead and Its Maya, but every godling in the teeming pantheons of the mighty tradition, is a paradox: potent both to further and to destroy; to entangle with benefactions and to redeem with a stroke that slays. The Waters of Non-Existence THE symbolism of Maya is developed further in a magnificent myth describing the irrational adventures of a mighty sage, Markandeya, during the interval of non-manifestation between the dissolution and re-creation of the universe. Markandeya, by a miraculous and curious accident, beholds Vishnu in a series of archetypal transformations: first, under the elemental guise of the cosmic ocean; then as a giant reclining on the waters; again, as a divine child, alone at play beneath the cosmic tree; and finally as a majestic wild gander, the sound of whose breathing is the magic melody of the creation and dissolution of the world.· The myth begins with a review of the deterioration of the cosmic order, during the slow but irreversible passage of the four yugas. Holy Dharma vanishes, quarter by quarter, from the life of the world, until chaos supervenes. Men are filled, at last, with only lust and evil. There is no one, any more, in whom enlight- ening goodness (sattva) prevails: no real wise man, no saint, no one uttering truth and standing by his sacred word. The seem- 35"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"ingly holy brahmin is no better than the fool. Old people, desti- tute of the true wisdom of old age, try to behave like the young, and the young lack the candor of youth. The social classes have lost their distinguishing, dignifying virtues; teachers, princes, tradespeople, and servants sprawl alike in a general vulgarity. The will to rise to supreme heights has failed; the bonds of sym- pathy and love have dissolved; narrow egotism rules. Indistin- guishable ninnies conglomerate to form a kind of sticky, un- palatable dough. When this calamity has befallen the once harmoniously ordered City of Man, the substance of the world- organism has deteriorated beyond salvage, and the universe is ripe for dissolution. The cycle has completed itself. One day of Brahma has elapsed. Vishnu, the Supreme Being, from whom the world first emanated in purity and order, now feels growing within himself the urge to draw the outworn cosmos back into his divine substance. Thus the creator and maintainer of the universe comes to the point of manifesting his destructive aspect: he will devour the sterile chaos and dissolve all animate beings, from Brahma on high, the inner ruler and cosmic life-spirit of the universal body, down to the ultimate leaf of grass. The hills and the rivers, the moun- tains and the oceans, gods and titans, goblins and spirits, ani- mals, celestial beings, and men, all are to be resumed by the Supreme. In this Indian conception of the process of destruction, the regular course of the Indian year-fierce heat and drought alter- nating with torrential rains-is magnified to such a degree that instead of sustaining, it demolishes existence. The warmth that normally ripens and the moisture that nourishes, when alternat- ing in beneficent co-operation, now annihilate. Vishnu begins the terrible last work by pouring his infinite energy into the sun. He himself becomes the sun. With its fierce, devouring rays he draws into himself the eyesight of every animate being. The whole world dries up and withers, the earth splits, and through S6"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"deep fissures a deadly blaze of heat licks at the divine waters of the subterranean abyss; these are caught up and swallowed. And wheR the life-sap has entirely vanished from both the egg- shaped cosmic body and all the bodies of its creatures, Vishnu be- comes the wind, the cosmic life-breath, and pulls out of all crea- tures the enlivening air. Like desiccated leaves the sear substance of the universe leaps to the cyclone. Friction ignites the whirl- ing tumult of highly inflammable matter; the god has turned into fire. All goes up in a gigantic conflagration, then sinks into smoldering ash. Finally, in the form of a great cloud, Vishnu sheds a torrential rain, sweet and pure as milk, to quench the conflagration of the world. The scorched and suffering body of the earth knows at last its ultimate relief, final extinction, Nirvana. Under the flood of the God-become-Rain it is taken back into the primal ocean from which it arose at the universal dawn. The fecund water-womb receives again into itself the ashes of all creation. The ultimate elements melt into the undifferen- tiated fluid out of which they once arose. The moon, the stars, dissolve. The mounting tide becomes a limitless sheet of water. This is the interval of a night of Brahma. Vishnu sleeps. Like a spider that has climbed up the thread that once issued from its own organism, drawing it back into itself, the god has consumed again the web of the universe. Alone upon the immortal substance of the ocean, a giant figure, sub- merged partly, partly afloat, he takes delight in slumber. There is no one to behold him, no one to comprehend him; there is no knowledge of him, except within himself. This giant, \"Lord of Maya,\" and the cosmic ocean on which he is recumbent, are dual manifestations of a single essence; for the ocean, as well as the human form, is Vishnu. Furthermore, since in Hindu mythology the symbol for water is the serpent (niiga) , Vishnu is represented, normally, as reposing on the coils of a prodigious snake, his favorite symbolic animal, the serpent Ananta, \"Endless.\" So that, not only the gigantic an- 37"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"thropomorphic form and the boundless elemental, but the rep- tile too is Vishnu. It is on a serpent ocean of his own immortal substance that the Cosmic Man passes the universal night. Inside the god is the cosmos, like an unborn babe within the mother; and here all is restored to its primal perfection. Though without there exists only darkness, within the divine dreamer an ideal vision thrives of what the universe should be. The world, recovering from decline, confusion, and disaster, runs again the harmonious course. And now, it is during this spellbound interlude that there occurs-according to the tale-a fantastic event: A holy man, Markandeya by name, is wandering inside the god, over the peaceful earth, as an aimless pilgrim, regarding with pleasure the edifying sight of the ideal vision of the world. This Markandeya is a well-known mythical figure, a saint en- dowed with life unending. He is many thousands of years old, yet of unaging strength and alert mind. Wandering now through the interior of Vishnu's body, he is visiting the holy hermitages, gratified by the pious pursuits of the sages and their pupils. At shrines and holy places he pauses to worship, and his heart is made glad by the piety of the people in the countries through which he roams. But now an accident occurs. In the course of his aimless, un- ending promenade, the sturdy old man slips, inadvertently, out through the mouth of the all-containing god. Vishnu is sleep- ing with lips a little open; breathing with a deep, sonorous, rhyth- mical sound, in the immense silence of the night of Brahma. And the astonished saint, falling from the sleeper's giant lip, plunges headlong into the cosmic sea. At first, because of Vishnu's Maya, Markandeya does not be- hold the sleeping giant, but only the ocean, utterly dark, stretch- ing far in the all-embracing, starless night. He is seized by despair, and fears for his life. Splashing about in the dark water, he be- comes presently pensive, ponders, and begins to doubt. \"Is it a"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"dream? Or am I under the spell of an illusion? Forsooth, this circumstance, utterly strange, must be the product of my imagina- tion .. For the world as I know it, and as I observed it in its har- monious course, does not deserve such annihilation as it seems now suddenly to have suffered. There is no sun, no moon, no wind; the mountains have all vanished, the earth has disap· peared. What manner of universe is this in which I discover myself?\" These searching reflections of the saint are a kind of commen- tary on the idea of Maya, the problem \"What is real?\" as con- ceived by the Hindu. \"Reality\" is a function of the individual. It is the result of the specific virtues and limitations of indi- vidual consciousness. While the saint had been wandering about the interior of the cosmic giant he had perceived a reality which had seemed to him congenial to his nature, and he had regarded it as solid and substantial. Nevertheless, it had been only a dream or vision within the mind of the sleeping god. Contrariwise, during the night of nights, the reality of the primal substance of the god appears to the human consciousness of the saint as a be- wildering mirage. \"It is impossible,\" he ponders, \"it cannot be real.\" The aim of the doctrines of Hindu philosophy and of the training in yoga practice is to transcend the limits of individu- alized consciousness.

By an eloquence rather of incident than of word, the mythology of India serves its function as the popular vehicle of the esoteric wisdom of yoga experience and of orthodox religion. An immediate effect is assured, because the tales are not the products of individual experiences and reactions. They are pro- duced, treasured, and controlled by the collective working and thinking of the religious community. They thrive on the ever- renewed assent of successive generations. They are refashioned, reshaped, laden with new meaning, through an anonymous cre- ative process and a collective, intuitive acceptance. They are effective primarily on a subconscious level, touching intuition, feeling, and imagination. Their details impress themselves on the memory, soak down, and shape the deeper stratifications of the psyche.

Such treatment would only sterilize them of their magic. For they are of a more archaic type than those familiar to us from the literature of the Greeks-the gods and myths of Homer, the heroes of the Athenian tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. The latter have been re- fashioned by poetic master-minds, are largely individual cre- ations, and in this respect resemble our modem attempts to deal with traditional forms. As in the works of Shelley and Swin- burne, or, above all, Wagner, there is always in the post-Homeric productions of the Greeks an attempt to stamp old mythological coins with new meanings, new interpretations of existence based on individual experience. On the other hand, in the myths of India we are brought the intuitive, collective wisdom of an age- less, anonymous, and many-sided civilization. One should feel diffident therefore when offering to comment on any Hindu myth. There is always the risk that the opening of one vista may be the closing of another. Details familiar to the Hindu listener as part of his experience and tradition, but strange to the Western reader, must be explained; yet the formu- lation of definite interpretations should be as far as possible eschewed. The predicament, therefore, of Markandeya we shall respectfully leave to speak for itself. The saint, forlorn in the vast expanse of the waters and on the very point of despair, at last became aware of the form of the sleeping god; and he was filled with amazement and a beatific joy.

He could"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"only think of his brief yet unforgettable experience as a kind of vision. Paradoxically, however, he himself, the human being un- able to accept any reality that transcended the interpretative powers of his limited consciousness, was now contained within that divine being, as a figure of its universal dream. And yet to Markandeya, who had been suddenly blessed with a vision of the Supreme Existence-in and by itself, in its all-containing soli- tude and quietude-that revelation likewise had been but a dream. Markandeya, back again, resumed his former life. As before, he wandered over the wide earth, a saintly pilgrim. He observed yogis practicing austerities in the woods. He nodded assent to the kingly donors who performed costly sacrifices, with lavish gifts for the brahmins. He watched brahmins officiating at sac- rificial rituals and receiving generous fees for their effective magic. All castes he saw piously devoted to their proper tasks, and the holy sequence of the Four Stages of Life he observed in full effect among men.· Graciously pleased with this ideal state of affairs, he wandered in safety for another hundred years. But then, inadvertently, once again, he slipped from the sleep- er's mouth and tumbled into the pitch-black sea.

Then again, by an effect of Maya, Markandeya saw the lonely little boy cheerfully at play, undismayed amidst the vast ocean. The saint was filled with curiosity, but his eyes could not stand the dazzling splendor of the child, and so he remained at a comfortable distance, pondering as he kept himself afloat on the pitchy deep. Markandeya mused: \"Something of this kind I seem to remember having beheld once before-long, long ago.\" But then his mind became aware of the fathomless depth of the shoreless ocean and was overcome with a freezing fear. The god, in the guise of the divine child, gently addressed him. \"Welcome, Markandeyal\" The voice had the soft deep tone of the melodious thundering of an auspicious rain cloud. The god reassured him: \"Welcome, Markandeyal Do not be afraid, my child. Do not fear. Come hither.\" The hoary, ageless saint could not recall a time when anyone had presumed either to address him as \"child,\" or to name him simply by his first name without any respectful appellation re- ferring to his saintliness and birth. He was profoundly offended. Though weary, pained with fatigue, and at a very great disad- vantage, he burst into a display of temper. \"Who presumes to ignore my dignity, my saintly character, and to make light of the treasure of magic power stored in me through my ascetic aus- terities?

Even the highest gods regard me with exceptional respect. Not even Brahma would dare to ap- proach me in this irreverent manner. Brahma addresses me courteously: '0 Long-Lived one,' he calls me.

Who merits death?\" 43"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"When the saint had thus expressed his wrath, the divine child resumed his discourse, unperturbed. \"Child, I am thy parent, thy father and elder, the primeval being who bestows all life. Why do you not come to me? I knew your sire well. He practised severe austerities in bygone times in order to beget a son. He gained my grace. Pleased with his perfect saintliness, I granted him a gift, and he requested that you, his son, should be en- dowed with inexhaustible life-strength and should never grow old. Your father knew the secret core of his existence, and you stem from that core. That is why you are now privileged to be- hold me, recumbent on the primal, all-containing cosmic waters, and playing here as a child beneath the tree.\" Markandeya's features brightened with delight. His eyes grew wide, like opening blossoms. In humble surrender, he made as if to bow and he prayed: \"Let me know the secret of your Maya, the secret of your apparition now as child, lying and playing in the infinite sea. Lord of the Universe, by what name are you known? I believe you to be the Great Being of all beings; for who else could exist as you exist?\" Vishnu replied: \"I am the Primeval Cosmic Man, Narayana. He is the waters; he is the first being; he is the source of the uni- verse. I have a thousand heads. I manifest myself as the holiest of holy offerings; I manifest myself as the sacred fire that carries the offerings of men on earth to the gods in heaven. Simul- taneously, I manifest myself as the Lord of Waters. Wearing the garb of Indra, the king of gods, I am the foremost of the immor- tals. I am the cycle of the year, which generates everything and again dissolves it. I am the divine yogi, the cosmic juggler or magician, who works wonderful tricks of delusion. The magical deceptions of the cosmic yogi are the yugas, the ages of the world.

I put an end to everything that exists. My name is Death of the Universe.\" ~rom this self-revelation of Vishnu it appears that Markandeya was far more privileged than Narada. Both saints plunged into the water, the substantial aspect of Vishnu's Maya, Narada in- tentionally, Markandeya inadvertently. To each the waters dis- closed \"the other side,\" \"the totally different aspect,\" the totaliter aliter. But Narada, who in his fervent devotion and loving sur- render (bhakti) was apparently on such familiar terms with the god's secret essence, broke into another existence, another en- tanglement of earthly suffering and joy. The transformation bound him with those very ties which he, in his fervent asceticism, had been striving to ignore and overcome. The waters initiated him into the unconscious side of his own being; introduced him to longings and attitudes still alive within him, which had been screened from his consciousness by the one-pointedness of his en- deavor. \"You are not what you fancy yourself to be,\" was the lesson implied in the startling experience that overwhelmed him when he was for but an instant submerged.· • The imagery of the Hindu myth allows for a cautious, intuitive reading in terms of psychology-the psychology of the conscious and unconscious. Among other interpretations this approach is indeed demanded, {or Maya is as much a psycho· logical as a cosmic term. The individualized, differentiated forms of the universe-earth as well as the higher and lower spheres of the heavens and underworlds-are supported by the formless fluid element of the depth. All have evolved and grown out of the primary fluid and are maintained by its circulation. Likewise. our individual. conscious personality. the psyche of which we are aware. the character-role that we enact socially and in solitary seclusion. is supported, as a mental and emotional micro- cosm, on the fluid element of the unconscious. The latter represents a potentiality in largest part unknown, distinct from our conscious being. far wider. far stranger than the cultivated personality, yet supporting it as its deep foundation and com- muning with it, circulating through it, as an enlivening, inspiring, and frequently disturbing fluid. The water represents the element of the deeper unconscious and contains every- thing-tendencies, attitudes-which the conscious personality, striving in the case of Narada for perfect saintliness, has ignored and pushed aside. It represents the indiscriminate, comprehensive potentiality of life and nature present in the in- dividual, though split off from the perceived, realized, consciously enacted character. 45"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Markandeya was a holy man of a different character. Con- tained within the world-dream in the body of the sleeping god, he was only one of many figures, yet was delighted to play his role as the ever-enduring saint-pilgrim, gratified by the ideal state of human affairs. He had no obsessive craving to transcend the Maya-spell by penetrating the miracle of the mirage. When Markandeya slipped from the god's mouth, he fell out of existence, in so far as existence is comprehensible and bear- able. He found himself confronted by what amounted to the Great Nothingness, the vast desert of the shoreless sea. The world familiar to him had vanished. In sudden succession he had ex- perienced two contradictory, incompatible aspects of the one essence, and his human mind failing to co-ordinate the two, Vishnu taught him the identity of opposites, the fundamental unity of everything in God. Stemming from His sole substance, thriving and perishing in God, all melts away again into the only source. Vishnu teaches the identity of opposites, first by manifesting himself as the babe, unafraid though utterly solitary in the in- finite expanse of the abysmal waters and the starless night; again, by addressing the age-old saint as \"child,\" and by calling him by his first name, as an old friend or relative, though apparently the two had never met. The secret of Maya is this identity of opposites. Maya is a simul- taneous-and-successive manifestation of energies that are at variance with each other, processes contradicting and annihilat- ing each other: creation and destruction, evolution and dissolu- tion, the dream-idyll of the inward vision of the god and the desolate nought, the terror of the void, the dread infinite. Maya is the whole cycle of the year, generating everything and taking it away. This \"and,\" uniting incompatibles, expresses the fun- damental character of the Highest Being who is the Lord and Wielder of Maya, whose energy is Maya. Opposites are funda- mentally of the one essence, two aspects of the one Vishnu. That"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"is the wisdom which this myth undertakes to disclose to the Hindu devotee. The deep-booming voice of the child continued, and instruc- tion rolled from his lips in a wonderful, soul-gratifying stream: \"I am the holy order (dharma), I am the glowing fervor of ascetic endeavor (latJas), I am all those appearances and virtues through which the true essence of existence manifests itself. I am the Lord-Creator-and-Generator-of-all-Beings (prajiipati), the order of the sacrificial ritual, and I am called the Lord of Sacred Wis- dom. As celestial light, I manifest myself, as wind and earth, as the water of the oceans, and as the space extending to the four quarters, lying between the four quarters and stretching above and below. I am the Primeval Being and the Supreme Refuge. From me originates whatever has been, shall be, or is. And what- ever you may see, hear, or know in the whole of the universe, know me as Him who therein abides. Cycle after cycle, I produce out of my essence the spheres and creatures of the cosmos. Con- sider that in your heart. Obey the laws of my eternal order and wander in happiness through the universe within my body. Brahma lives in my body and all the gods and the holy seers. Know me as Him who manifests, yet whose manifesting magic remains unmanifested and not to be grasped. I am beyond the goals of human life-gratification of the senses, pursuit of pros- perity, and pious fulfilment of sacred duties-yet I point out those three goals as the proper aims of earthly existence.\" With a swift motion, then, the Primeval Being brought the holy Markandeya to his mouth and swallowed him, so that he vanished again into the gigantic body. This time, the heart of the saint was so flooded with beatitude, that instead of wander- ing further he sought rest in a solitary place. There he remained in lonely quietude and joyfully listened to \"The Song of the Immortal Gander\": the at first hardly audible, secret, yet univer- sal melody of God's life-breath, flowing in, flowing out. And this is the song that Markandeya heard: \"Many forms do I assume. 47"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"And when the sun and moon have disappeared, I float and swim with slow movements on the boundless expanse of the waters. I am the Gander. I am the Lord. I bring forth the universe from my essence and I abide in the cycle of time that dissolves it.\" This melody and song, with its figure of the cosmic gander, is the last of the series of archetypal revelations of the god, made to the pious saint, Markandeya. In Hindu mythology the wild goose is associated, generally, with Brahma. Just as Indra rides on an elephant, Shiva on the bull Nandi, Shiva's son, the war-god Skanda-Karttikeya, on the peacock, and \"The Goddess\" (devi) on the lion, so Brahma soars through the atmosphere on a mag- nificent gander. These vehicles or mounts (vahana) are manifesta- tions on the animal plane of the divine individuals themselves. The gander is the animal mask of the creative principle, which is anthropomorphically embodied in Brahma. As such, it is a symbol of sovereign freedom through stainless spirituality. That is why the Hindu ascetic, the mendicant monk or saint who is supposed to have become freed from the bondage of rebirth, is said to have attained to the rank of \"gander\" (hamsa), or \"highest gander\" (paramahamsa). These are epithets commonly applied to the orthodox teacher-saints of present-day Hinduism. Why, we must ask, is the gander such an important symbol? The wild gander (hamsa) strikingly exhibits in its mode of life the twofold nature of all beings. It swims on the surface of the water, but is not bound to it. Withdrawing from the watery realm, it wings into the pure and stainless air, where it is as much at home as in the world below. Flying through space it migrates south and north, following the course of the seasons. Thus it is the homeless free wanderer, between the upper celestial and the lower earthly spheres, at ease in both, not bound to either. When the gander wishes, it alights upon the waters of the earth; when it wishes, it withdraws again to the void on high. Hence it sym- bolizes the divine essence, which, though embodied in, and"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"abiding with, the individual, yet remains forever free from, and unconcerned with, the events of individual life. On the one hand earth-bound, limited in life-strength, in vir- tues and in consciousness, but on the other hand a manifestation of the divine essence, which is unlimited, immortal, virtually omniscient and all-powerful, we, like the wild goose, are citizens of the two spheres. We are mortal individuals bearing within ourselves an immortal, supra-individual nucleus. Shrouded by the limiting, individualizing stratifications of the tangible gross frame of our physical nature, and by the subtle sheaths of our animating psyche, is the Self (iitman), fundamentally unaffected by the processes and activities of the conditioning layers, isolated and steeped in beatitude. Without knowing it, we are immaterial, divine, exalted, though also changing, subject to experiences, joys and griefs, decay and rebirth. The macrocosmic gander, the divine Self in the body of the uni- verse, manifests itself through a song. The melody of inhaling and exhaling, which the Indian yogi hears when he controls through exercises (prii'Qiiyiima) the rhythm of his breath, is re- garded as a manifestation of the \"inner gander.\" The inhalation is said to make the sound, ham, the exhalation, sa. Thus, by con- stantly humming its own name, ham-sa, ham-sa, the inner pres- ence reveals itself to the yogi-initiate. Markandeya is listening to this song. He is listening to the breathing of the Highest Being. That is why he sits alone in a solitary place and does not care any more to follow the course of the world, no longer delights to roam around and observe the ideal state of human affairs. He is released from the spell of endless, though delightful, sight-seeing, liberated from the com- pulsion to migrate through supernal landscapes. The most di- vine melody imaginable is absorbing his entire attention. The song of the inner gander has a final secret to disclose. \"Harhsa, ham-sa,\" it sings, but at the same time, ttsa-'ham, sa- 'ham.\" Sa means \"this\" and 'ham means \"I\"; the lesson is, \"This 49"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"am I.\" I, the human individual, of limited consciousness,. steeped in delusion, spellbound by Maya, actually and fundamentally am This, or He, namely, the A.tman, the Self, the Highest Being, of unlimited consciousness and existence. I am not to be iden- tified with the perishable individual, who accepts as utterly real and fatal the processes and happenings of the psyche and the body. \"I am He who is free and divine.\" That is the lesson sung to man by every movement of inhalation and exhalation, assert- ing the divine nature of Him in whom breath abides. Markandeya's doubts as to what is \"real\" are put at rest by this song. \"Many forms do I assume,\" the god is singing. That is to say, through the creative energy of his Maya the Divine Being transmutes himself and exfoliates into the hosts of perishable individuals and universes-into the universe, for instance, of which Markandeya forms a part. \"And,\" sings the glorious bird, \"when the sun and moon have disappeared I float and swim with slow movements on the boundless expanse of the waters.\" Thus the opposing views of reality, which so baffled and dis- turbed the saint when he fell out of the familiar world into the starless night of the fathomless ocean, are for him now recon- ciled and identified as one. \"1 am the Lord, and I am the Gander.\" I am the supreme All-Being, whose playful transmutation is the macrocosm, and I am the innermost principle in man-in the microcosm; I am the divine life-principle revealed in the mel- ody of the breath. I am the Lord, the all-containing cosmic giant and the Self, the imperishable, divine life-center in man. \"I bring forth the universe from my essence and I abide in the cycle of time that dissolves it.\" The operation of Maya was revealed in Markandeya through alternating cosmic visions. Whereas Narada experienced the enigma through a personal dream-transforma- tion, Markandeya beheld the wonder of the play on a scale that was universal. The myth opened with a description of the dissolution of the eon, it concludes now with an account of the re-beginning:"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Highest Being, in the form of water, gradually gathered and stored within himself a glowing energy. Then, in his bound- less strength, he determined to produce again the universe. He who is himself the Universal visualized the form of the universe in its five elements of ether, air, fire, water, and earth. Calm lay over the ocean, fathomless and subtle. Vishnu, having entered the water, gently stirred it. Waves rippled. As they followed each other, there was formed among them a tiny cleft. This cleft was space or ether, invisible, intangible, the most subtle of the five elements; carrier of the invisible, intangible sense-quality of sound. Space resounded, and from the sound arose the second element, air, in the form of a wind. Wind, spontaneous motor force, had space at its disposal in which to grow. Pervading space, it relentlessly expanded far and wide. Violently rushing, fiercely blowing, it aroused the waters. From the resultant commotion and friction the third element, fire, originated-a mighty divinity whose path is black with smoke and ash. Fire, increasing, devoured a great quantity of the cosmic water. And where the water had disappeared, there remained a mighty void, within which came into existence the upper sphere of heaven. The Universal Being who had permitted the elements to proceed from his essence, now rejoiced to behold the forma- tion of heavenly space. In preparation for the bringing forth of Brahma he centered his mind. It is the nature of the Supreme Being to take delight in him- self in the cosmic ocean. Presently, out of his cosmic body, he puts forth a single lotus, with a thousand petals of pure gold, stainless, radiant as the sun. And together with this lotus he puts forth the God-Creator of the Universe, Brahma, who is seated in the center of the golden lotus, which expands and is radiant with the glowing energy of creation.

To the right of the entrance is a magnificent stone relief show- ing Indra, the king of gods. (Figure I.) He is seated on his giant elephant, Airivata, the celestial ancestor of all earthly elephants, animal-shaped archetype of the rain-bestowing monsoon-cloud. Compared with the earth below, which is seen in the relief as if half from above, the god and his mount are of enormous size. Minute, toy-like figures cover the landscape beneath. In the center is a holy tree, surrounded by a fence. To the left is a court scene: a king seated under an umbrella on a wicker throne, at- tended by musicians and dancers. The celestial elephant, with uplifted trunk, carries a mighty tree which he has uprooted in his course, symbolizing the irresistible fury of the storm. This Bhlijli relief is executed in a distinctly \"visionary style\" and resembles rather a plastic painting than the work of a chisel in stone. Subtle yet bold, with a fluent, vigorous stroke, it tes- tifies to a long antecedent tradition, of which the earlier docu- ments have not as yet been found. The figures emerge from the rock and cover its surface in thin, rippling layers, like subtle waves of c10udlike substance; so that, though carved from solid rock, they suggest a kind of mirage. The substance of the stone seems to have assumed the contours of lightly fleeting emana- tions. Formless, undifferentiated, anonymous rock is in the very process, as it were, of transforming itself into individualized and 55"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"animate forms. Thus the basic conception of Maya is reflected in this style. It represents the apparition of living forms out of formless primal substance; it illustrates the phenomenal, mirage- like character of all existence, earthly and divine. But the view of the universe as Maya is not the only world- interpretation known to India. In fact this view, this mode of experience, represents a considerable philosophical victory, ob- tained during the first millennium B.C., over an earlier, strictly concretistic, dualistic system of belief, such as persists to this day in the teachings of the J aina sect, and which may have flourished generally, in pre-historic times, among the pre-Aryan popula- tions of the Indian sub-continent. The Jains numbered, in 1931, only 1,252,105 members, for the most part wealthy traders, bankers and merchants, settled in the larger cities-this prosperous lay community supporting an all-important inner circle of extraordinarily austere, advanced ascetics, both monks and nuns. But at one time the Jains were nu- merous, and their teachings have played an important part in the history of Indian thought. Their last great prophet, Mahavira (d. ca. 500 B.C.), was a contemporary of the Buddha (563-483 B.C.), and was himself a follower of the much earlier Jaina prophet, Parshvanatha (872?-772? B.C.), who is regarded as the twenty- third of the Jaina saviors. The twenty-second, Neminatha, is said to have preceded him by 84,000 years'(The first, Rishabhanatha, existed in an earlier epoch of the world, when husbands and wives were born together as twins, had sixty-four ribs apiece, and were two miles tall)For many centuries Jainism flourished , side by side with orthodox Hinduism, attaining to a peak of prosperity in the fifth century A.D. But since the Mohammedan invasions and massacres some seven centuries later (especially, since the conquest of the region of Gujarit by Ala-ud-den, \"The Bloody,\" in 1297-8), the sect has steadily declined. Its present almost vestigial state was long foretold by its seers: with the de- cline of virtue in the world, during the slow, irreversible course"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"of the cycle of the ages, the true religion should steadily dwindle, until, at last, with the fall of the world into utter degradation, it should disappear. The last Jaina monk should be named Dup- pasahasiiri, the last nun Phalgushri, the last layman Nagila, the last laywoman Satyashri.- Jainism is characterized by a profound and absolute pessimism with respect to the nature of the world. Matter is not finally a transformation of spirit, but a permanently existing substance, concrete and ineradicable, made up of atoms and capable (like clay) of taking many forms.1)ifferent from matter, imprisoned within it and working upon it from within, like a yeast, to give it forms, are the souls (jiva, \"the lives\"), which are practically in- numerable (the world is literally filled with them), and which, like matter itself, are never to dissolve. The goal of Jaina re- ligious practice is to release these Jivas from their entanglement with matter (matter is \"non-jiva,\" ajiva). In order to accomplish this end, an elaborate and gently graduated system of life-rules and vows is carefully maintained, to conduct the layman by slow degrees to the ultimate state of the advanced ascetic. Man is fet- tered because he goes on acting and doing, every deed bringing an accumulation of new entanglements; the way to victory, there- fore, resides in absolute inaction. When this state has been prop- erly and very gradually attained, every trace of Ajiva will have been put away by the time the moment of death occurs. The Jiva then breaks free into absolute release (kaivalya, \"perfect isolation\"). This condition is not regarded by the J ains as re- absorption into any ultimate Universal Substance; for they know of no such all-subsuming, non-dual state of being. On the con- trary, the individual Jiva, the Monad, simply ascends, like a free • The Jaina cycle. it should be noted. differs from that of the Miyl-world of Vishnu.

The space occupied by each of the perfected ones is boundless. The perfected ones are all-aware.· Although the perfected state, Kaivalya, is far beyond and above the worldly spheres presided over by the gods, the Jains admit to their popular household devotions (for the aid and con- solation of lay-people in their daily affairs, until the higher reaches of spiritual clarification shall have been attained) cer- tain of the divinities of the Hindu pantheon. But these are un- derstood to partake of a distinctly inferior mode of being. Like the world over which they preside, they are heavy with the stuff of temporal existence. And this weightiness, this durable ma- teriality, is reflected in their representation in the works of Jaina art. Figure 2 shows a Jaina image of Indra, the heavenly raja, king of the gods. This is a work dating from about A.D. 850; it stands in a Jaina sanctuary at Eliira, a monolithic temple cut into the living rock of a cliff. J aina art of all periods is characterized by a puppet-like stiffness, barrenness, and rigidity. Sometimes it draws a certain vigor and vitality from its close kinship to popu- lar art: its images often resemble the fetish figures of the primi- tive levels of the population. Like the doctrine and life-experi- ence that it renders and interprets, it is archaic, fundamentalist, inflexible-unsophisticated by any alleviating insight. Nothing • The universe is represented by the mythological symbolism of the Jains as a giant in human form, the Cosmic Giant, which may be represented either as a male or as a female.

Nothing finally ceases to be. The everlasting contrariety of primal matter and the living, straining souls is never resolved. Indra, king of the gods, with a dignified, almost threatening heaviness, sits on his mount, the elephant. He is flanked by two attendants and overshadowed by a tree, a \"wish-fulfilling tree\" (kalpa-vrilqa): the inhabitants of Indra's paradise gather from the branches of this arboreal symbol of life the fruits of their desires-jewels, precious garments, and other delightful objects of vanity and pleasure. But the god, the tree, and all that they can give, are loaded with the heaviness of corporeality. In the clear contours and ornaments of this work the vigor and solid resistance of the rock are made to serve the intended effect. The stone of the image retains its solidity. Mineral, animal weight is what we here behold. There is no conversion of the stone into something subtle and fleeting, no hint of cloud-like transciency. Life-force is expressed in terms of massiveness and bulk, with a thoroughly respectable realism and an utterly prosaic devotion. Here are stateliness and the beatitude of vegetable-animal na- ture, but in the higher mode of an immortal god. This Indra is the stout and sturdy master of the sensuous, living world, out of whose pale the Jaina saint is strenuously exercised to escape. Little wonder if the monk should be forced to the most extraor- dinary extremes of physical self-castigation, in order to break free. An epoch-making philosophical and psychological victory over this literal-minded religiosity is represented in the subtle, mirage-effects of the art of Bhaja.

The Serpent, Supporter of Vishnu and the Buddha WHEREAS the myths of emanation and dissolution revolve with a cold and ruthless impersonality that reduces to virtual non- entity the great world of human weal and woe, popular lore abounds with divinities and genii warmly sympathetic to the life-illusion. The sages Narada and Markandeya were vouch- safed magical experiences of the impalpability of Maya. On the other hand, the millions of mankind dwell and labor within the net of the dream-web.

The most conspicuous and generally beneficent of its manifestations on earth arc the mighty rivers, and particularly the great sacred three: Ganges, Jumna, Saraswati. The mythology of India is rich in personifications of the life- giving power of the waters. Chief among these is Vishnu him- self, the supreme procreator of the universe. Second to him is the goddess Padma (\"Lotus\"), his spouse and queen-called also Lakshmi and Shri (\"Prosperity,\" \"Fortune,\" \"Beauty,\" \"Virtue\"). The god and goddess are depicted on Indian shrines in close association with the multitudinous local genii who typify the play of the living waters in the created world.

In a graceful, relaxed posture the god reclines in slumber, as if absorbed in the dream of the universe inside him. At his feet, in the humble place assigned to the Hindu wife, is Lakshmi-Shri, the goddess Lotus, his spouse. Her right hand holds his foot, her left hand gently strokes the leg. Such stroking is part of the wor- ship traditionally paid by the Hindu wife to the feet of her lord. From the navel of the god grows a lotus, which is a duplicate- manifestation of the goddess at his feet. The flower bears on its corolla Brahma, the four-faced demiurge-creator. Arrayed above are major divinities of the Hindu pantheon. The figure to the right of four-faced Brahma is Indra, mounted on Airavata, his elephant. The couple seated on a bull and soaring through space are Shiva and his spouse, \"The Goddess.\" A boyish personage is to be distinguished in the right hand corner, exhibiting sev- eral profiles; this is probably the six-faced war god, Skanda Kart- tikeya. Below are aligned five masculine figures and a woman: ap- parently the five Pandava princes with their wife, the heroes of the epic of the Mahabharata. These are associated with Vishnu as celebrated recipients of his favor. According to the great story, they lost their kingdom to their cousins, the Kauravas, in a gam- bling match, and were then supported in the struggle to recover it by the High God himself. Vishnu, in the human form of their companion, Krishna, served them as advisor and charioteer. Be- fore the onset of the final battle, he revealed to their leader, Arjuna, the blessed gospel of the Bhagavad Gita, thus bestowing on him eternal freedom as well as victory on earth.-In the Deogarh relief the central personage is apparently Yudhishthira; the two to his left are Bhima and Arjuna, and those to his right, 61"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Nakula and Sahadeva, the twins. The common wife of the five, Draupadi, is in the corner.· Returning now to the problem of the great serpent-bed, we may review the whole subject of the snake symbol in Indian iconography. Vishnu's shoulders and head are surrounded and protected by nine serpent heads with expanded hoods; he couches on the mighty coils. This multiheaded snake is an animal- counterpart of the anthropomorphic sleeper himself. It is named Endless (ananta), also The Remainder, The Residue (se~a). It is a figure representing the residue that remained after the earth, the upper and infernal regions, and all their beings, had been shaped out of the cosmic waters of the abyss. The three created worlds are afloat upon the waters; i.e., they balance on the expanded hoods. Shesha is the king and ancestor of all the snakes that crawl the earth. The shield of expanded serpent-hoods surrounding the shoul- ders and head is a characteristic feature of serpent-genii in In- dian art. A typical representation was discovered during the ex- cavation of the great Buddhist monastery-university of Nllianda in northeast India. (Figure 4.) This is a work in the mature classic style of the later Gupta period, about the fifth century A.D. The serpent prince, or naga, in human form is represented sitting in a devotional attitude, in meditative posture, with a rosary slung around the palm of his right hand. From the back spreads the characteristic halo: an uneven number of expanded cobra-hoods, forming a part of the body and shielding the head. • These heroes are regarded as themselves incarnations. Yudhishthira is a human manifestation of Dharma, the Sacred Order of Life. Bhima represents the Wind God, Vayu; he is characterized by the huge iron club with which he smashed (by a foul) the thighs of the leading hero of the opponents, whom he had engaged in single combat. Arjuna is a human counterpart of Indra. Nakula and Sahadeva incarnate the twill \"Horseman Gods,\" the A,hvin (Hindu parallel~ to the Greek Dioscuri). Draupadl, finally, is a duplicate of Indranl, the queen of the gods and spouse of Indra. Her polyandrous man'iage to the five brothers is an extraordinary and exceptional case in the Brahmin tradition. 6a"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Occasionally the sinuous body of the snake is represented as run- ning down the back. Or again, at the hips, the human figure may become serpentine, after the manner of a mermaid. In a gigantic relief depicting the myth of the Descent to Earth of the Ganges (which we shall discuss at the conclusion of the present chapter) two such figures, a male and a female, are to be seen. (Fig- ures 27-8.) Nagas are genii superior to man. They inhabit subaquatic paradises, dwelling at the bottoms of rivers, lakes, and seas, in resplendent palaces studded with gems and pearls. They are keepers of the life-energy that is stored in the earthly waters of springs, wells, and ponds. They are the guardians, also, of the riches of the deep sea-corals, shells, and pearls. They are sup- posed to carry a precious jewel in their heads. Serpent princesses, celebrated for their cleverness and charm, figure among the an- cestresses of many a South Indian dynasty: a nagini or naga in the family tree gives one a background. An important function of the nagas is that of \"door guardian\" (dviira-piila). As such they frequently appear at the portals of Hindu and Buddhist shrines. In this role their proper attitude is one of pious devotion (bhakti), fervent and loving concentra- tion on the inward vision of the god or the Buddha whose pre- cincts they attend. It is extremely interesting and important to observe that the Buddhist and Hindu representations of such popular divinities do not differ from each other, either essen- tially or in detail; for Buddhist and Hindu art-as also Buddhist and Hindu doctrine· -were in India basically one. Prince Gautama Siddhartha, the \"historical Buddha,\" who taught in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., was a reformer, a monastic re- former, remaining within, and taking for granted, the context of Indian civilization. He never denied the Hindu pantheon or • Cf. Ananda K.

His specific deed was not that of refuting but of re-formulating, on the basis of a profound per- sonal experience, the ageless Indian teaching of redemption from the toils of Maya. The new order of mendicant monks that he established for the practice of his special code of disciplines was, in India, one order among a multitude. \"I have seen the ancient Way,\" he is reported to have said, \"the Old Road that was taken by the formerly All-Awakened, and that is the path I follow.\" • Like every considerable Indian saint, Gautama was venerated even during his lifetime as a human vehicle of Absolute Truth. After his passing, his memory became clothed with the standard accouterments of myth. And when the Buddhist sect expanded, developing from the estate of an essentially monastic to that of a largely secular community,t the great founder became less and less exclusively an example to be followed (for how can a layman follow an ascetic and at the same time do justice to family duties?), more and more a symbol to be venerated-symbol of the re- demptive power of enlightenment which is latent in every de- luded being. During the golden centuries that followed the period of the Buddha and endured until the fiery arrival in India of the zealots of Mohammed, Buddhism and Hinduism developed side by side, submitting to common influences, exchanging argu- ments and insights. In later Buddhist art we find the Blessed One throned supreme-as representing the highest personifica- tion of the Absolute-amidst the old, old demonic and divine presences of the fertile land, the heavens, and the hells. The earliest stone monuments in India date from the Maurya period (320-185 B.C.), particularly from the epoch-making reign of the emperor Ashoka (272-232 B.C.).

Not only did his domain embrace the whole of northern India, expand- ing to include Afghanistan, Kashmir, and the Dekkan, but he sent out missionaries to the south as far as Ceylon, and westward even into Syria and Egypt. He established throughout his em- pire countless monasteries, and is reputed to have constructed up to eighty thousand dagabas or stiipas (Buddhist reliquary shrines). It is among the ruins of his era that the pictorial tradi- tion of Indian myth and symbol first breaks for us, like a torrent, into the light of day. It is apparent, however, from the sophistication, the degree of perfection, and the variety of the work that abruptly appears in the period of Ashoka and then rapidly increases, that already in the earlier centuries (though invisible to us. because com- mitted to the perishable materials of ivory and wood) the tor- rent of Indian religious art must have been flowing strong.

In his left hand is a tree, in his right a water-jar, the vessel of abundance, out of which is growing a luscious plant. This attitude of the serpent prince as doorkeeper and devotee goes back to the earliest period of Buddhist art.' Between the Buddha and the naga in India there is no such antagonism as we are used to in the savior versus serpent sym- bolism of the West. According to the Buddhist view, all the genii of nature rejoice, together with the highest gods, upon the ap- pearance of the incarnate redeemer, and the serpent, as the prin- cipal personification of the waters of terrestrial life, is no excep- tion. Eager to serve the universal teacher, they watch solicitously his progress toward final enlightenment; for he has come to re- deem all beings alike, the creatures of earth, of the heavens, and of the hells. There is a special Buddha-type that stresses this supreme har- mony between the savior who has overcome the bondage of na- ture and the serpent who represents that very bondage; the type figures conspicuously in the Buddhist art of Cambodia and Siam. (Figure 7.) Like the image of Vishnu on Ananta (Figure 3), this buddha represents a special modification of a traditional Hindu naga formula. (Figure 5.) The type does not appear among the art works of India proper, yet the legend that explains it forms a part of the earliest Indian Buddhist tradition and is accorded a prominent place in the orthodox canon preserved by the ven- erable Buddhist community of Ceylon. It is based on an event that is supposed to have occurred shortly after Gautama's attain- ment of enlightenment. • When the Blessed One, in the last watch of the Night of Knowledge, had fathomed the mystery of dependent origination, the ten thousand worlds thundered with his attainment of omni- • MGh4·wggtJ, i. 1-5."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"science. Then he sat cross-legged for seven days at the foot of the Bo-tree (the Bodhi tree, the \"Tree of Enlightenment\"), on the banks of the river Nairaiijana, absorbed in the bliss of his illu- mination. And he revolved in his mind his new understanding of the bondage of all individualized existence; the fateful power of the inborn ignorance that casts its spell over all living beings; the irrational thirst for life with which everything consequently is pervaded; the endless round of birth, suffering, decay, death, and rebirth. Then after the lapse of those seven days, he arose and proceeded a little way to a great banyan-tree, \"The Tree of the Goatherd,\" at the foot of which he resumed his cross-legged posture; and there for seven more days he again sat absorbed in the bliss of his illumination. After the lapse of that period, he again arose, and, leaving the banyan, went to a third great tree. Again he sat and experienced for seven days his state of exalted calm. This third tree-the tree of our legend-was named \"The Tree of the Serpent King, Muchalinda.\" Now Muchalinda, a prodigious cobra, dwelt in a hole amongst the roots. He perceived, as soon as the Buddha had passed into the state of bliss, that a great storm cloud had begun to gather, out of season. Thereupon he issued quietly from the black abode and with the coils of his body enveloped seven times the blessed body of the Enlightened One; with the expanse of his giant snake-hood he sheltered as an umbrella the blessed head. Seven days it rained, the wind blew cold, the Buddha remained in meditation. But on the seventh, the unseasonable storm dis- persed; Muchalinda unloosed his coils, transformed himself into a gentle youth, and with joined hands to his forehead bowed in worship of the savior of the world. In this legend and in the images of the Muchalinda-Buddha a perfect reconciliation of antagonistic principles is represented.

The bliss of inner absorp- tion in the experience of enlightenment, triumph over the bondage of life, supreme peace, Nirvana-Release, pervade the substance of the image and emit a radiance, tender, compas- sionate, and sweet. It is said by some that when the Buddha began teaching his doctrine, he soon realized that men were not prepared to accept it in its fullness. They shrank from the extreme implica- tions of his vision of the universal Void (sunyata). Therefore, he committed the deeper interpretation of reality to an audi- ence of nagas, who were to hold it in trust until mankind should be made ready to understand. Then to his human disciples he of- fered, as a kind of preliminary training and approach to the para- doxical truth, the comparatively rational and realistic doctrine of the so-called Hinayana division of Buddhism. Not until some seven centuries had passed was the great sage Nagarjuna, \"Arjuna of the Nagas,\" initiated by the serpent kings into the truth that all is void (sunya). And so it was he who brought to man the full- fledged Buddhist teachings of the Mahayana.· • For a discussion of Hinayina and Mahiyina Buddhism, see Ananda Coomara· Iwamy, Buddha and the Gospel Of Buddhism (New York, 1916). ,68"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"2. Divinities and Their Vehicles \\VHEREVER we encounter a fairly continuous series of Buddhist monuments dating from the final centuries B.c.-such as have survived the inclemencies of the Indian climate and the vicissi- tudes of history-representations of serpent genii occur in as- sociati9n with a variety of other divine patrons of fertility, pros- perity, and earthly health. These personify under various aspects the life energy-beneficent but blind-which the message of the Buddha broke and dissolved. In attitudes of devout concentra- tion, deep faith, and rapture, they watch now at the shrine of him who pointed the difficult path that leads beyond them: the embodiments of the powers of earthbound life stand in worship of the master of asceticism and release. Conspicuous among these figures are the voluptuous tree god- desses or dryads, generally represented in a characteristic posture: with one arm entwining the trunk of a tree and the other bend- ing a branch down, the goddess gives the trunk, near the root, a gentle kick. (Figure 19.) This curious formula derives from a ritual of fecundation. According to an ageless belief, nature re- quires to be stimulated by man; the procreative forces have to be aroused, by magic means, from semi-dormancy.Q, particu. lar, there is in India a certain tree (aSoka) which is supposed not to put forth blossoms unless touched and kicked by a girl or young woman.

It is a duplicate-representa- tion of the energy and character of the god. Shiva, similarly, is depicted on the bull; \"The Goddess,\" his spouse-consort, on the lion. Their son, the elephant-headed god Ganesha, \"The Lord and Leader of the Hosts of Shiva,\" called also \"The Lord and Master of Obstacles\" (vighneJvara), sits above a rat. (Figure 58.) Ganesha forges ahead through obstacles as an elephant through the jungle, but the rat, too, is an overcomer of obstacles, and, as such, an appropriate, even though physically incongruous, mount for the gigantic pot-bellied divinity of the elephant head. . The elephant passes through the wilderness, treading shrubs, bending and uprooting trees, fording rivers and lakes easily; the rat can gain access to the bolted granary. The two represent the power of this god to vanquish every obstacle of the Way. ./ Kubera, overlord of all the genii (yak$as), frequently is rep- resented as standing on a crouching man. His common epithet is \"He whose mount or vehicle is a man\" (nara-vahana). Kubera and his following are genii of fertility, riches, and prosperity, prin- cipally associated with the earth, the mountains, and the treas- ures of the precious stones and metals underground. They are tutelary divinities of the Indian household, deriving from the pre-Aryan, aboriginal tradition, and playing a considerable role in Hindu and early Buddhist folklore. The man-vehicle beneath his feet distinguishes Kubera from all other superhuman kings and prince just as the cobra hoods mark for us the superhuman naga~riman e ve icle is a determinant, to let us know pre- cisely who the figure is that is represented in the given work of art. The device did not originate in India, but was imported, at an early period, from Mesopotamia.

In this work the com- posite monster occupies the place of the vlihana in Indian art and serves the identical function. It represents and embodies, on an inferior plane, the energies of the anthropomorphic god and serves as a vehicle. In the art works of Mesopotamia the device can be traced back to at least 1500 B.C. In the earliest monuments of India (those of the Indus Valley Civilization of the fourth and third millenniums B.C.)· it does not occur. The origin of the determinative \"vehicle\" is to be sought in the technique of picture or rebus writing of the ancient Near East. According to a common convention of the hieroglyphic, pictographic scripts-as preserved in the Egyptian and Meso- potamian inscriptions, and as underlying the Hebrew and Phoe- nician alphabets-characters that originally represented objects were employed to express phonetic values. Then, in order to preclude ambiguity, another symbol, the \"determinant,\" was added, which specified the reference of the original sign. Simi- larly, in these images of divinities the simple kingly or womanly form of the anthropomorphic figure is somewhat ambiguous; its reference becomes specified by the determinant, or parallel symbol, added underneath. As we shall see, this device of the animal vehicle is by no meant the only instance of Mesopotamian influence on Indian sym- bolism. There must have flourished, at an early period, a sea- going traffic between the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and the western coast of India. The original centers of Mesopotamian civilization were located close to the deltas of the rivers, at the head of the Persian Gulf. It was a matter of only .. • Cf. pp. 98-6. infrtl.."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"a few days to India. And we have evidence of influences running in both directions. An early Indian alphabet, the Brahmi script, was adapted from a Semitic writing style of about 800 B.C.; and there is a Buddhist tale describing an expedition of Indian mer- chants to Babylon. Babylon is called in the story \"Baveru.\" The men from India are described as having excited the astonish- ment of the inhabitants of the western city by exhibiting a peacock. J. The Serpent and the Bird AMONG the motifs deriving from early Mesopotamian art and continuing in the traditions of India to the present day is the pattern of the entwined serpent-pair. This ancient device com- monly appears on votive slabs erected to serpent genii. Such stone tables, called nagalkals, variously decorated with serpent forms, are votive gifts from women desiring offspring. They are set up in temple courtyards, at the entrances of villages and towns, near ponds, or under holy trees. (Figure 8.) The ponds are sup- JKlsed to be peopled by nagas. When the sculptor has finished such a stone, it is placed for some six months in a pond, to become imbued with the life force of the watery element. Also, and for the same reason, it is treated with a ritual and with magic formulae (mantra). Then the stone is set up, preferably under a pipal or a nimba tree. These two trees often stand together, and are regarded as mar- ried couples. The snakes are supposed to inhabit the terrestrial moisture among the roots. J The nagakals of Figure 8 are from the state of Mysore, South India. The reliefs decorating them are of several kinds. Some exhibit a snake queen of the mermaid type, with serpent tail"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"and human body, and with a halo of expanded cobra hoods: she folds her arms across her breast supporting in them two ser- pent children who rise above her shoulders. Others exhibit one snake with a number of heads and expanded hoods. Others again show the Mesopotamian serpent pair, heads facing each other, entwined in amorous embrace. In Mesopotamia this device appears in a very early design traced on the sacrificial goblet of King Gudea of Lagash. (Figure 11.) In this work of the Sumerian period, ca. 2600 B.C., we find the familiar pair of serpents, entwined, and facing each other. The motif must have been diffused into India at an extremely remote era, before the arrival of the Aryans. Together with cer- tain other non-Vedic, pre-Aryan, aboriginal traits, it is preserved to this day in the conservative local traditions, particularly of Central and South Indian folklore. Interestingly enough, in the living Indian traditions as well as in this golden goblet of the archaic Sumerian past, the classical antagonist of the fabulous serpent is the fabulous bird. The goblet of King Gudea displays a warlike pair of winged, birdlike monsters, standing erect on eagle claws and with the forepaws of a lion. Such bird-beings represent the firmament- the upper, celestial, ethereal realm-just as the serpents repre- sent the life-bestowing, fertilizing element of the terrestrial waters. They stand in eternal opposition to the serpent powers, and, accordingly, constitute with them an archetypal pair of sym- bolical antagonists, the champions respectively of heaven and of earth. The eagle belongs to Father Heaven, Father Zeus in the my- thology of the Greeks. Serpents, on the other hand, attend the god- dess Hera, Zeus' consort, Mother Earth. Many are the mythologi- cal episodes delineating the opposition of the two. For example, when Herakles, the child of a clandestine affair between Zeus and the mortal woman Alkmene, was still an infant in the cradle, jealous Hera dispatched her snake attendants to kill him: the 73"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"little son of Father Heaven, however, was able to slay them. Again, according to Homer's Iliad, an eagle appeared to the as- sembled Greek heroes, one day during the siege of Troy. The bird was observed slowly soaring in the sky, and bearing in its talons a bleeding snake. Ka1chas, the priest-soothsayer, inter- preted the apparition as an auspicious omen, denoting the tri- umph of the Greeks over the Trojans. The heavenly bird ravag- ing the serpent symbolized to him the victory of the patriarchal, masculine, heavenly order of the Greeks over the female prin- ciple of Asia and Troy.1rhe latter was typified in the luxurious Asiatic goddess, Aph~te, and particularly in her immoral deed which had been the cause of the Trojan War: she had persuaded Helen, the wife of Menelaos, to break the ties of her marriage under the patriarchal, masculine order, and to lie with Paris, a mate of her own selection. The twofold symbol of eagle and serpent is possessed of a vitality that outlasts the ages. In the West it reappears in mod- em literature in Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra, where the eagle and serpent are the two animal companions of the philos- opher's \"Solitary Sage.\" \"The proudest and the shrewdest among animals,\" he calls them. As embodiments of the principal virtues of the first Superman, they symbolize the re-united powers which are to open the way to the New Age. (Probably the symbolism is very much older than the chalice of the ancient Sumerian king, Gudea. Nevertheless, Mesopo- tamian Sumer may well have been the cradle out of which the formula made its way, on the one hand westward to Greece and modern Europe, on the other hand eastward into ancient India, and then, somewhat later, into remoter Indonesia. The two snakes were regarded in Mesopotamia as symbolical of the god of healing, Ningishzida; hence, in Greece they became attached to the god of medicine, Asklepios. Today they are our symbol /of the medical profession. Like a river winding its way, the serpent creeps along the 74"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"ground; it dwells in the earth and starts forth like a fountain from its hole. It is an embodiment of the water of life issuing from the deep body of Mother Earth. Earth is the primordial mother of life; she feeds all creatures out of her substance, and again devours all; she is the common grave. She clasps to her bosom the life she has brought forth, denying to it the unbound freedom of celestial space. In contrast, the infinity of heaven de- notes the free sway of the unbound spirit, freely roaming as a bird, disentangled from the fetters of earth. The eagle represents this higher, spiritual principle, released from the bondage of matter and soaring into the translucent ether, mounting to its kin, the stars, and even to the supreme divine being above them. On the other hand, the serpent is life-force in the sphere of life- matter. The snake is supposed to be of tenacious vitality; it rejuvenates itself by sloughing off its skin. WHefeas in Western tradition the spiritual antagonism of bird and serpent is commonly understood and stressed, the opposi- tion, as symbolized in India, is strictly that of the natural ele- ments: sun force against the liquid energy of the earthly waters. Ablaze with the heat of the glowing sun, drying up the moisture of the land, the \"fair-feathered\" (supaT1)a), golden-winged, grif- fon-like master of the sky violently attacks, ruthlessly and eter- nally, the embodier and guardian of the vivifying liquid of the all-nourishing earth. The bird is addressed as \"He who kills nagas or serpents\" (niigiintaka, bhujagiintaka), \"He who devours serpents\" (pannagasana, niigasana). His proper name is Garuda, from the root gri, \"to swallow.\" As the relentless annihilator of serpents, he is possessed of a mystic power against the effects of poison; hence is popular in folklore and daily worship. At Puri, in the Indian province of Orissa, persons suffering from snake- bite are taken to the main hall of the Great Temple, where they embrace a Garuda pillar filled with the magic of the celestial bird. Garuda is represented, generally, with wings, human arms, vulture legs, and a curved, beaklike nose. Two amusing exam- 75"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"pIes are represented on the endpiece of a balustrade from Siam (Figure 9): in a triumphant attitude above a pair of giant snakes with lifted heads, the sturdy little garudas clutch their conquered victims in their claws. • Garuda is the vehicle, or vahana, of the Supreme God, Vishnu. He bears him on his shoulders, the god carrying meanwhile in uplifted hand the sharp-rimmed battle-discus, \"Fair to See\" (sudarsana), the fiery sun disk of a thousand spokes, the wheel (cakra) which he hurls against his opponents. In Cambodian architecture not Vishnu alone but his whole temple is supported by Garuda. The bird is multiplied and arrayed in caryatid-rows bearing the structure. The temple is regarded as an earthly copy of Vaikuntha, the god's celestial abode. Thus Vishnu is linked (like Nietzsche's Zarathustra) with both of the eternal antagonists. Shesha, the serpent Endless, repre- sentative of the cosmic waters, who is the source of all water whatsoever, is his animal representative; but then so too is Garuda, the conquering principle, the snake's opponent. This is a paradox with reason; for Vishnu is the Absolute, the all- containing Divine Essence. He comprises all dichotomies. The Absolute becomes differentiated in polarized manifestations, and through these the vital tensions of the world-process are brought into existence and maintained. • In the Hellenistic Buddhist art of Gandhara (Northwest India, first century B.C. to fourth A.D.) the Greco-Roman formula of the eagle, Zeus, bearing away the youth Ganymede is employed to represent the! Indian theme of the sun·bird, Garuda, abducting and devouring a young nAgini.

A rather isolated myth, not connected with the major cycles of the avatars of Vishnu, is that of The Deliverance of the Ele- phant. - A sculptural representation of the event is shown in a relief in the Dasha-Avatar Temple of Deogarh. (Figure 13.) A magnificent elephant, in quest of its fare of lotus stalks and roots, has ventured too far into the watery element, and the serpents of the deep have seized and fettered it. The great animal, strug- gling in vain, has at last implored the help of the High God. Vishnu has just appeared, seated on Garuda. No deed of Vishnu is required; his presence is enough. The mighty serpent king pays obeisance, together with his queen. The serpents bow with folded hands before the Lord Ruler of the Universe and sur- render to him their victim.

Like a lotus on the quiet surface of a lake, or like human consciousness on the darkness of the uncon- scious, so the earth now reposes, fresh and fair, on the waters of the cosmic abyss. But the course of evolution is subject to setbacks. According to the Indian view. it is punctuated by recurrent crises which re- quire the intervention of the Highest God. There exists an ever threatening counter-current, antagonistic to the trend of evolu- tion. which periodically halts, engulfs, and takes back what has already been given form. This force is represented in classical Hindu mythology under the guise of the giant serpent power of the world abyss. Thus it happened at the very dawn of the pres- ent day of Time. that the Earth, newly blossomed, was suddenly ravished from the surface of the cosmic sea to the lowest deep. It was at this juncture that Vishnu assumed the form of a gigan- tic boar. The boar is a warm-blooded animal belonging to the earthly sphere. yet reveling in swamps. and familiar with the watery element. Vishnu in this form plunged into the cosmic sea. Overcoming the great serpent king and treading him down-the enemy. with folded hands, imploring at last his mercy-the High God incarnate in the animal shape gathered into his arms the lovely body of the still very youthful Mother Earth, and while she supported herself by clinging to his tusk, brought her up again to the surface of the sea. Vishnu, as the embodied absolute, is intrinsically not at vari- ance with the serpent principle of the water; nevertheless, in symbolic episodes such as this, the god has to interfere with the serpent's action. The serpent must be checked. because it en- dangers the further evolution of the universe: it represents, in- deed. the all-containing substance of Vishnu. but on a primitive level of differentiation.

There was no universe at that time, only night and the interminable sleep of the infinite sea. Vishnu counteracts that retrogressive tendency of his own substance by taking form and playing the role of the World Creator and Maintainer-in the present in- stance, in the warm-blooded, animal form of a boar. The event is magnificently depicted in a relief of Udayagiri, Gwalior, dated A.D. 440. (Figure u.) The celestial beings here watching the exploit of the heroic boar are aligned in regular rows, after the manner of ancient Mesopotamian patterns-like hieroglyphs or cuneiform symbols. This is an astonishing cir- cumstance, as yet unexplained. In fact, no one has hitherto even expressed surprise at the isolated apparition, amidst the totally different forms of the classic Hindu style, of this rigid, orna- mental composition, obviously and very strongly influenced by the hieroglyphics of the ancient Near East. A third instance of Vishnu as opponent and conqueror of the serpent principle is recounted in connection with the life story of his most popular incarnation, Krishna. The tale is told in the Vishnu Purana,'\" and since it is fraught with highly significant myth-motifs, is well worth reviewing at considerable length. The account opens with a review of the circumstances of Krishna's coming into the world.t As usual, the titans or demons having won a victory over the gods, a savior-incarnation was to be born, to restore the balance of the powers. This particular example of the recurrent crisis is regarded as having occurred at the close of the yuga just preceding our own, i.e., at the close of the Dvapara Yuga that terminated 3102 B.C.t A race of demons had sprung into existence over the whole surface of the eanh, and having unseated the gods, had established a reign of terror, injustice, and disorder.

She ascended to the summit of Mount Meru, the central mountain and axis of the universe, and there gained entrance, as a petitioner, to the Assembly of the Gods. Before Brahma and the celestials the goddess Earth prostrated herself. \"The God of Fire is the paternal protector of gold,\" she said, \"and the Sun God the protector of cows. My paternal pro- tector is Vishnu. He is venerated by the entire world. \"My Lords, over the realm of mortal beings a demon-host is swarming. Day and night cities howl, the land blazes. Villainous personages too numerous to name, demons celebrated through- out the yugas for their wickedness, have been born again, into the families of powerful kings, and they are working their in- tolerable deeds without restraint. Even Klllanemi, the infamous devil slain of old by Vishnu, has returned. He is now Kamsa, the son of King Ugrasena. My body is so burdened by iniquities, that I can no longer sustain them. They are shattering my sinews. 0 ye Mighty Ones, save me; see to it, or I shall sink, overcome, to the bottom of the Abyss.\" Brahma heard. The gods urged him to relieve the goddess. Brahma spoke: \"0 ye Celestialsl Myself, Shiva, and You-all beings-are no more than a portion of Vishnu. We know that the manifesta- tions of Vishnu's boundless substance are moved by an ever- changing tide. Violence and weakness alternate with order and strength; there is a continuous waxing and waning of his grace. Let us proceed, therefore, to the shores of the Milky Ocean-which is the abode of Vishnu-and there humbly communicate to him, the Highest Being, this complaint and petition of the Earth. For, as we have so often seen, Vishnu is ever willing to send a minute particle of his essence down into the world-the world being but a manifestation of his pleasure; and thus he has repeatedly re-established the orderly course of the Day.\" Brahma, together with the Earth and all the gods, resorted 80"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"therefore to Vishnu.

All the gods, too, shall go down to her, each in a portion of his essence, and rescue the Earth by conquest of the demons. There is a certain princess, Devaki, the wife of Vasudeva, and she is like unto a goddess among men. This dark hair of mine is to become the eighth fruit of her womb. I shall descend into her and be born of her, and shall kill again the demon Kalanemi, in his present incarnation, Kamsa.\" Vishnu vanished, and the gods, falling to their knees, paid homage to the Invisible. Then all descended from the summit of Mount Meru. The hairs became presently a brother-pair of hero saviors.

Here, among the children of the good and simple folk, tending the flocks and playing in the woods and fields, they passed a series of idyllic years which have become a favorite theme of Hindu myth and contemplation. The cycle of boyhood deeds associated with this period is one of the most charming passages among the mythologies of the world. The little savior, time after time, playfully baftled and amazed the cowherds with marvelous deeds out of all proportion to his childlike guise, yet never dis- closed to them his divinity. At last, misinterpreting the phe- nomena as ominous of earthquake or other imminent evil, the whole community moved for safety-herds and carts and all-to the mighty forest of Vrindivana, on the bank of the sacred Yamuna, just across from Kamsa's capital city, Mathura.· There they constructed a crescent-shaped camp of carts and fences, set their flocks to graze, their children to play, and resumed their ageless way. Krishna, their divine charge, regarded with pleas- ure the new surroundings, benignly blessed the forest and be- stowed welfare on the cows. Immediately, though the merciless heat of the summer was at its height, the meadows-as though it were the rainy season-brought forth fresh grass. It behooves a superhuman savior, when he has been born of an earthly mother, to conform to the environment he has chosen to inhabit. To all appearances, he is as much enmeshed in Maya as everybody else. But then, of a sudden, a superhuman deed or gesture betrays his supernatural essence. So it was with Krishna in the Vrinda forest. In this way it happened, that, even as a boy, he met and overcame a certain serpent king, Kaliya by name, who inhabited the waters of the river near his home. Krishna and his brother, Rima, played among the cowpens • Modern Brindaban. on the Jumna. opposite Muttra.

They made drums of leaves, and Krishna blew the flute. Laughing and frolicking, they romped among the great trees, sometimes alone, sometimes together, sometimes with a host of other boys. It was when wandering alone, on a little exploring expedi- tion. that Krishna came to a place along the river where the water was whirling. white with foam. This was the region of the underwater den of the great serpent king, Kaliya, whose poisonous, fiery breath, spreading about, had burned all of the trees overhanging the stream. Even birds flying above the hor- rible abode were scorched and fell to their death. Krishna, the adventuring seven-year-old, came to this danger- ous place and curiously peered into the depths. \"Here dwells the wicked Kaliya,\" he brooded. \"whose weapon is venom. Already. I have subdued him.· If released by me, he will vanish into the vast ocean. Because of this Kaliya the whole of the Yamuna, from here to the sea, has become impure. Neither men nor cattle may quench their thirst in these waters. Therefore, I shall vanquish this king of serpents and release the inhabitants of the country from their continual dread. It was to make them happy and free, and to chastise the wicked who dwell in the paths of evil, that I descended into the world. All right-I shall climb up yon- der broad-branched tree overhanging the water, and jump.\" The boy girded his loins, made his way up the tree, and jumped with a great leap into the depths. His impact shook the Abyss. The flaming water splashed high into the trees along the bank, setting them afire. The firmament seemed ablaze. Then with his palms Krishna smote the water, and the snake king, challenged by the unwonted noise, came forth, eyes red with wrath. hoods puffing with fiery poison. Kaliya was surrounded • A reference to the coming battle."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"by swarms of red serpent warriors. Serpent queens and-serpent maidens attended him by the hundred. The writhing bodies, adorned with glittering necklaces of pearl, sparkled as they rose in undulating coils, lifting their innumerable heads. The ser- pents sprayed Krishna with their poison. They bit him with mouths running with venom, and they fettered his limbs with their coils. A little group of the cowherds, watching in horror near by, saw Krishna sink, inert and unconscious, entangled by the swarm of serpents. Overwhelmed, they hurried home. \"Krishna, in a fit of madness,\" they cried, \"has jumped into the den of Kaliya. The serpent king is devouring him. Hurry! Help!\" The cowherds rushed for the river, followed by their wives and children. \"Alas, alas, where have you gone?\" the women cried as they stumbled among the trees. Balarama led the way. He pointed out to the people Krishna lying powerless at the bottom, fettered by the coils. Nanda and Yashoda, the boys' foster parents, stood aghast when they beheld the face of their child. The other women, looking on, wept and stammered without hope. \"In the abyss of Kaliya we all will join you,\" they cried; \"for we cannot return to the cowpens without you, our beautiful boy! What is day without the sun, or night without the moon; what are cows without milk. and what will our homes be without Krishna?\" Balarama saw his foster-mother. Yashoda, in a swoon, and the heartbroken N anda staring into the stream. Then, because of his secret knowledge of Krishna's divine nature, Balarama ad- dressed him, gazing down at him with a piercing eye: \"Divine Lord of the Gods, why do you exhibit this human frailty? Are you not aware of your divine essence? You are the navel of the universe, the support of the gods, the creator, destroyer, and guardian of the worlds. The universe is your body. These who have been your relatives since our descent to man, the cowherds and their wives, are overwhelmed with despair. Have mercy on 84"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"them! You have played the babe and the boy; you have enacted the human weakness. Display now your infinite power; arise and conquer the mighty fiend!\" The words rang in Krishna's ears. They reminded him of his true essence. Over his face there moved a smile, and his eyes gradually opened. His arms stirred; his hands began to beat the coils that entwined him. With a burst, he released his limbs from the serpent coils, and, springing free, placed his foot on the ser- pent king. He lifted his knee, and began to dance on the mighty head. Whenever the monster attempted to rear its neck, the divine boy trod it down; again and again this happened, until finally the snake grew weak and fainted. Krishna continued his dance until the great king spat blood, and lay stiff as a stick. The queens then in awe, beholding their lord with battered and bloodied head, implored Krishna in the following words: \"Divine Master of the Gods, Supreme Ruler of the Universe, we recognize you now! Who is worthy to praise your world-tran- scending greatness? Be merciful, and spare the life of this our king!\" (Figure 14.) The exhausted Kaliya recovered somewhat at this prayer, and with faltering voice implored the victor: \"I have only acted ac- cording to my nature. As you created me with strength and en- dowed me with my poison, so have I behaved. Had I comported myself otherwise, I should have violated the laws laid down by you for every creature according to its kind; I should have chal- lenged the order of the universe and been liable therefore to punishment. But now, even in striking me, you have blessed me with the highest boon, the touch of your hand. My force is broken, my poison spent; I implore you to spare my life to me and declare what I must do.\" Krishna, in his mercy, replied: \"You shall not henceforth re- side in the waters of the Yamuna, but in the vastness of the ocean. Depart! Moreover, I declare to you that Garuda, the sun-bird of"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"gold, arch enemy of all serpents and my vehicle through the reaches of space, forever shall spare you, whom I have touched.\" The serpent king bowed, and with his kinsfolk withdrew to the ocean. The cowherds embraced Krishna, as one who had been miraculously restored to life. Shedding tears upon his head, they rejoiced in his deed, which had restored to the waters of the river their beneficent quality. Extolled by the cowherds, praised by the women and girls who surrounded him in flattering dalliance, Krishna, the boy hero, incarnation of the All Highest, returned to the camp circle and the cows. This very popular and often repeated tale is freighted with many charges of meaning, and can be interpreted from a number of points of view. In terms of religious history, it means that a local nature divinity, a demon dwelling in the river Yamuna, the spirit of the water, a wrathful power very difficult to pro- pitiate, was conquered and dislodged. A primitive serpent-cult was superseded by the worship of an anthropomorphic divine savior. Through the intermediary, Krishna, the special cult of a local demon became merged into the widespread, general cult of Vishnu, the Supreme Being, and thus was linked into a con- text of superior symbolic import, representing concepts and in- tuitions of a general validity. In Greek mythology and religious history a similar circum- stance is registered in Apollo's conquest of the earthbound ser- pent lord of Delphi. This python would send up revelations through a fissure in the rock; a priestess, the Pythea, inhaling the potent fumes, would be inspired to give voice to cryptic utter- ances: the prophecies of the Oracle of Delphi. But then the great god, Apollo, challenged and overcame the dragon-demon; slew it and took its seat. Thereafter, Delphi was the sanctuary of the anthropomorphic Olympian, a god related to solar power and standing for enlightenment, wisdom, moderation and propor- tion. A higher, celestial principle had replaced the terrestrial 86"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"presence-and yet, had not completely erased it. The priestess remained in her ancient role; the beneficent power of the earth still spoke to man; the Delphic Oracle continued in operation. Only now, the patron and owner of the sanctuary was no longer a primitive earth demon but an Olympian: Apollo, as the Pythic god. Likewise, Kiliya was dislodged by Krishna. In this case, the demon was not killed; he had only to resign his power and with- draw to the remote sea, so that the idyllic life of man, as repre- sented by the camp-circle of the cowherds, should not be injured by the blaze of his poison. Krishna played the role rather of moderator than of annihilator. He liberated mankind from a threat and a peril, favoring life against the slaying breath of the serpent, and yet recognized the rights of the destructive power; for the venomous serpent was as much a manifestation of the Supreme Being as were the pious cowherds. It was a manifesta- tion of one of the darker aspects of God's essence, and had ap- peared out of the all-producing, primary, divine substance. There could be no elimination, once and for all, of this presence which to man seemed wholly negative. Krishna effected only a kind of boundary settlement, a balanced judgment as between demons and men. For the good of the human kingdom, Kiliya was as- signed to a remoter sphere, but he was allowed to remain un- changed both in nature and in power. Had he been transformed, redeemed, or altogether eliminated, the counter-play between human and demonic, productive and destructive energies would have been disrupted-and such an eventuality was far from the intent of the Highest Being. Vishnu's role as the maintainer of the world involves this func- tion of mediator, or moderator, between the antagonistic ener- gies that are active in the life-process of the universe. He restrains the overbearing impact of the destructive, disruptive powers. This he does by descending into the universe in one or another"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"of his avatirs, curbing and subduing the terrible forces that threaten general ruin, and finally restoring a working equilib- rium of opposites. Yet, as the Supreme Being, the all<ontaining SubstaIice, he cannot be fundamentally at variance with the demons of the realm of water. Indeed, one of his principal mani- festations is Shesha, the cosmic snake. We must not be surprised, therefore, to find that Krishna, Vishnu's human avatir and the conqueror of Kaliya, may be represented with the typical at- tributes of the serpent genii. Figure 6 shows Krishna in conjunction with the naga-symbol. This is a bronze figure from Bengal; an example of the Pala style of the first half of the ninth century A.D. The d~vinity has four arms, and holds the discus (cakra, sudarsatza) and the iron club (kaumodaki). Vishnu's two queens are at either hand: Shri- Lakshmi, the goddess of earthly welfare, and her opponent, Saras- vati, patroness of speech, song, and wisdom.· They are rivals, as the two wives of one male must be. It is said that whenever one of them bestows her boons on a man the other remains away: the wise are not wealthy and the wealthy are not wise. But at Vishnu's feet the two are subdued to antagonistic co-operation. Here the charm of the youthful god-incarnate is blended with the grandeur of the cosmic being. The human aspect discloses the Krishna for whom the hearts of all women and maidens were moved with love-first, during the years of his boyhood idyll among the cowherds, later on, at the courts of the princely clans. The naga-symbol, on the other hand, forming the background, represents that divine nature which the hero-savior concealed from those whom he gladdened by his human presence and amazed by his deeds. This is the sign of his real character, the • SaralVatt (the river SaraswatI) is related also to Brahml, who Is wisdom and revelation inalrnarej though, preferably, Brahmll's oonsort is Slivitrl, the anthro- pomorphic embodiment of a certain holy prayer from the Rig Veda that oonfcn initiation.

For the human avatar is a blending of opposites. Such a blending also. are we ourselves, though unaware of our twofold nature: we are at once the illimited, unconditioned, divine Self, and the shrouding at- tributes of personality-experience and ego-consciousness. In the case of Krishna's half-brother, Balarama, the naga char- acter is strongly emphasized. He is a human embodiment, a par- tial incarnation, of Shesha himself, and this character is exhibited particularly in the story of his end. He is described as sitting be- neath a tree on the shore of the ocean, lost in thought; where- upon a large snake crawls out of his mouth, leaving the human body of the hero-savior inanimate. This is his Shesha-nature, his secret life-essence, going back to the watery deep. As it winds its way in gigantic undulations, serpents sing its praises. The ocean itself arises in the form of a mighty serpent king to salute the great guest, its own higher Self, the serpent of the universal waters. The serpent essence of the divine hero goes back into the formlessness of the Abyss-returning into itself after having accomplished the momentary role of companion and supporter to a human avatar. In the mythologies of the West analogous themes are to be found, but here the antagonism is not resolved. The semi-divine hero, Herakles, son of Father Heaven, Zeus, and thus a part of the celestial energies, is a relentless enemy of the snakes of the earth. As an infant, he strangles the serpents that the old earth- goddess, Hera, sends into his cradle. Later on, he conquers the Hydra, a destructive monster almost unconquerable-blind life- force, growing seven heads for every one severed from its body. Christ, too, crushes the serpent's head, though he falls victim to its sting. In the West, the hero-saviors descending from heaven to in- augurate a new age on earth are regarded as embodiments of a spiritual and moral principle superior to the blind, animal life- force of the serpent power.

The first literary work containing evidence of her existence is a relatively late hymn, one of the so-called Khilas or \"Supple- ments,\" appended to the ancient corpus of the Rig Veda.· Here, in twenty-nine stanzas, she is celebrated and described. Most sig- nificantly, all the traits that are to characterize her in the still later, \"classical\" period of Hindu mythology and art, already are announced in this earliest hymn. Not improbably, she existed among the people long before the priests of the invaders deigned to grant her recognition. Ageless as the basic culture-forms of India itself, she comes down, as it were, from everlasting to ever- lasting, without essential change. In this apocryphal hymn appended to the Rig Veda the Lotus Goddess is already called by her two classic names, Shri and Lakshmi, and is associated in every possible way with the lotus symbol. She is praised as \"lotus-born\" (padmasarhbhavii), \"stand- ing on a lotus\" (Padme~thitii) \"lotus-colored\" (padmavaT7J.a), \"lotus-thighed\" (padma-ilril), \"lotus-eyed\" (Padmaksi), \"abound- ing in lotuses\" (padmi1)i, p~karni1)i), \"decked with lotus gar- lands\" (padmamali'Qi). As the tutelary deity of the rice-growing agriculture of native India, she is called, \"The One Possessing Dung\" (kari#'Qi). Her two sons are Mud (kardama) and Mois- ture (ciklita), personifications of the ingredients of a rich soil. She is \"honey-like\" (madhavi), and is said to grant \"gold, cows, horses, and slaves.\" She wears \"garlands of silver and gold.\" She bestows health, long life, prosperity, offspring, and fame.

She is associated with this flower as in- variably as is Vishnu with the Milky Ocean. The goddess \"to whom the lotus is dear\" (padmapriya) is among the principal figures sculptured on the richly decorated gates and railings of the earliest Buddhist stu pas-those of Safichi and Bharhut (second and first centuries B.C.). In Figure 15, from Bharhut, she is shown in one of her classic poses. Out of a jar filled with water. the vessel of abundance, five lotus blossoms stem, two supporting a flanking pair of elephants. From uplifted trunks the animals gently pour water over the broad-hipped patroness of fertility- Gaja-Lakshmi, \"Lakshmi of the Elephants\"-who smiles. and with the right hand uplifts her fully rounded breasts in a gesture of maternal benevolence. The hymn attached to the Rig Veda addresses her: prajanam bhavasi mata, \"Thou art the mother of created beings\"; anaas the Mother she is called. ~ama, \"Earth.\" She is thus a special aspect or local development of the Mother Earth of old: the great mother goddess of the Chalcolithic period, who was worshiped over a wide area of the world, and of whom innumerable images have been found throughout the ancient Near East, in the lands of the Mediterranean. the Black Sea, and in the Danube valley. She is a sister, or double, of the well known goddesses of early Sumero-Semitic Mesopotamia; and thus she furnishes a clew to pre-Aryan linkages between India and the sources of our West- ern tradition of myth and symbol. An archaic image of the goddess Lotus appears on a terracotta plaque from Basarh. dating from about the third century B.C. (Figure 16.) She stands on a lotus pedestal, with two lotus blos-"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"soms and two buds at her sides. She wears armlets on her upper arms and rich, pearl-fringed bracelets-Hindu ornaments such as are familiar from other monuments of the era. But the ele- phants, her characteristic animal-companions, are missing; in- stead, she has wings-a rare and astonishing feature for India. Wings, common in Western tradition, do not figure among the attributes of Indian gods or superhuman beings, except in the case of Garuda, the birdlike carrier of Vishnu. In general, the celestial beings of India either float through space without visible support or are carried by their_vehicles. On the other hand, in ancient Mesopotamian art winged divinities or genii were the rule. This Indian figure betrays connection with that tradition. That is the sphere from which are derived the wings of our divini- ties of the West, the Greek victory-goddesses as well as the Chris- tian angels. We have already noted and briefly discussed the commercial intercourse between India and the Land of the Two Rivers, which must have flourished in archaic times.· A dramatic spot of light was thrown on the problem, during the second decade of the present century, when a series of excavations along the Indus River suddenly disclosed a hitherto unsuspected chapter of ancient Indian history. Up to that time, the Tigris-Euphrates and the Nile had represented to us the dawn of civilization. Now, abruptly, the Indus flashes its claim. Highly developed ancient cities were discovered, giving abundant evidence of an advanced civilization that apparently reached its climax about 2500 B.C. It extended over an area very much larger than either Egypt or Sumer. Of the three principal sites investigated, Mohenjo-Daro. Harappa, and Chanhu-Daro, the first two were explored by the India Archaeological Survey under Sir John Marshall, the third by the American archaeologist, Dr. Ernest Mackay.

In the ancient Mesopotamian site of Esh- nunna (Tell Asmar, fifty miles northeast of Bagdad), in a stratum dating from the so-called Early Dynastic Period (ca. 3000-2550 B.C.), was found a seal cylinder with a frieze of such elephants and rhinoceroses as occur nowhere but on the seals of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.t Correspondences in pottery decoration and design, beads apparently from Egypt unearthed among the In- dian remains, and a number of other very suggestive fragments of evidence, bespeak a commerce of some kind-its proportions as yet impossible to estimate-during the remotest centuries of the third millennium B.C.

The domestic and civic architecture at Mohenjo-Daro is much more highly developed than that of either Egypt or Mesopotamia of the same period. Now it is very interesting to observe that among the substruc- tures and outlines of the innumerable houses excavated at Mo- henjo-Daro none has been found of proportions great enough to suggest the site of a temple or public sanctuary. In the Meso- potamian excavations, on the other hand, temple sites are exceed- ingly prominent. Nevertheless, in the center of the city of Mohenjo-Daro were discovered the substructures of an imposing edifice that contained a large bathing pool. The tank is sunk eight feet below the floor level, is thirty-nine feet in length and twenty-three in breadth; the outer wall is more than eight feet thick; a row of chambers is ranged along the east side. Probably this establishment was not meant for purely secular purposes: it very strongly suggests the innumerable holy bathing-places of the popular religion of later India, such as are to be found today along the sacred rivers and in the center of the temple compounds. These are the resorts of pilgrimage, for the washing away of sins, evils and sufferings of every kind. Apparently here we have evi- dence of a continuous tradition from the bathing place of Mohenjo-Daro to the river sanctuaries of the present day. Other evidences of continuity over the long millenniums in- clude the forms of ox-carts and of tools, as well as the art of the domestication of the elephant. The Mohenjo-Daro seals supply the earliest known representations of the elephant. They exhibit the animal both in domestic and in fabulous roles-which corre- sponds to the situation in late~ classic Indian tradition. The ele- phant is depicted standing before a feed-trough, so that it must already have played a role in the human household.

(Figure 25.)· Furthermore, the complement to the male symbol, in Mohenjo-Daro as well as in modem India, is our god- dess with the lotus in her hair. (Figure 24.) She exhibits her breasts with the familiar maternal gesture; they are the source of the abundant milk that gives life to the universe and its beings. And so now it appears that though the earliest literary evidence of the existence of the goddess Lotus-Shri-Lakshmi is a late and apocryphal hymn attached to the Aryan corpus of the Rig Veda, this mother of the world was actually supreme in India long be- fore the arrival of the conquerors from the nort4. The occlusion of the Indus Civilization together with its goddess queen must have resulted from the arrival of the strictly patriarchal warrior- herdsmen, and the installation of their patriarchal gods. The Mother was removed from her lotus and Brahma seated in her stead, she herself relegated-as in the shrine of Vishnu Ananta- shayin (Figure g)-to the servile position of the brahmin wife. Nevertheless, in the hearts of the native population, her suprem- acy was maintained, and with the gradual merging, through the centuries, of the Vedic and pre-Vedic traditions, gradually she re- turned to her position of honor. She is visible everywhere in the monuments of early Buddhist art, and in the works of the classic period she stands triumphant on every side. Today she is the greatest power in the Orient. The ubiquitous lotus is a sign of her presence even where her human features do not appear. And not uncommonly the mas- culine divinities even copy her traditional poses. A characteristic attitude of the goddess, that known as \"lotus in hand\" (padmtJ.. hastii, padmapiit)i), is taken over in the iconography of Mahayana Buddhism by the universal savior Padmapani (\"Lotus in Hand\"), the greatest among the Bodhisattvas, or immortal helpers of the Buddhas.

In the sweet melody of the contours and proportions, and in the subtle musicality of the posture, the virtues of the Bodhisattva are appropriately ex- pressed. Here are embodied his infinite mercy and loving com- passion, his unearthly spirituality and angelic charm. In Indian Buddhist tradition, Padmapani, or Avalokiteshvara, is of an ambivalent or polyvalent character. He is, like Vishnu, the master of Maya, and is possessed of the divine power of assum- ing forms at will. According to the needs of the situation, he may appear as man or woman, or as animal; he may appear as a fabu- lous winged horse named \"Cloud\" (valiihaka), or as an insect. His manner of manifestation depends upon the particular group of living beings he may wish to assist on the path of salvation through enlightenment. Padmapani is the Hindu prototype of the Chi- nese Buddhist goddess Kwan-yin and the Japanese Kwannon; in this Far Eastern version of the Bodhisattva the female character prevails-as if the figure were returning to its archetypal nature.

On the one hand, she represents the termination of de- light in earthly or even celestial existences, the extinction of every craving for individual duration; on the other hand (but this amounts to the same realization differently described) she is the adamantine, indestructible, secret nature of all and everything, itself devoid of all limiting, differentiating characteristics. Now, according to the Buddhism of the medieval, Tantric period-where Buddhist and Hindu conceptions were mingled in a magnificent harmonization-the great Bodhisattvas and his- torical Buddhas (the historical Prince Gautama being now re- garded as but one Buddha-manifestation among many) who descend as saviors to walk the earth and who go down even into the purgatories to rescue the suffering inmates, or who preside over paradises and everywhere spread the gospel of release- through-enlightenment, teaching and working miracles in a timeless career of saviorship, are but radiations of One Trans- cendental Enduring Essence, which is called \"The Buddha of the Beginnings\" (adi-buddha), or again, \"The Lord of the Uni- verse\" (lokeSa). In the Buddhist pantheon this Primeval Buddha occupies much the same position as the Highest Being in Hindu- ism. He is the sole source of all temporal appearances-the only real reality. The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas go forth from him into the phenomenal mirage of the universe, just as the avatars go forth from Vishnu. And just as Lakshmi is the consort of the Hindu God, so is Prajiia-Paramita the female aspect of the Uni- versal Buddha.

Brahmi, the four-headed spiritual demiurge, is often represented with manuscripts of the Holy Vedas in his hands; the so-called \"Pra jiii-Piramiti Texts\" are the corresponding liter- ary manifestation of the transcendent wisdom of the Buddha. In the present image these have supplanted Brahma himself. Thus the ancient calyx of spontaneous procreat~ve energy has been made to carry the symbol of the wisdom that transcends it, the wis- dom that leads beyond the spell of Miyi. The lotus of the world supports the symbol of the enlightenment that dispels the dark- ness of the naive ignorance inherent in all living beings. The lotus symbol, which originally gave birth to beings and existences in unending succession, now carries the powerful wisdom of N ir- vina: the Word that puts an end to all individualized existence, whether in heaven or on earth. To sum up: As the goddess Lotus is characterized by the vege- table symbol beneath her and carries at her left the lotus flower, so Prajiii-Paramiti is invariably characterized by the lotus seat and the lotus at her left supporting the manuscript. As Lakshmi is Vishnu's consort, representing his creative energy. so Prajiii- Piramiti is the female consort of the transcendent Universal Buddha and represents his nature, the nature of eternal, blissful quietude in enlightenment-limitation and individualization being extinguished.

The background, a shield in slightly ogived form, has a rim of gentle flames, radiating the spiritual energy of enlightenment. The oval head is majestically elongated by the huge, rich diadem. The pure oval halo expresses something of the supreme Void of the transcendental essence. The countenance is perfectly symmetrical and a model of womanly beauty. The fingers touch each other in the gesture that indicates meditation on the cycle of causation, the cycle of life, suffering, and death. Prajiia-Paramita is the Buddhist version of Sophia, the mother and source of enlightening knowledge. It is interesting to note that this representation of a most lofty abstraction is at the same time, presumably, a portrait-effigy. Among the Hindu and Buddhist rulers and princes of Java and Cambodia the custom prevailed of erecting \"consecration fig- ures\" after death or during the lifetime. In \"consecration figures\" the princely person is portrayed in the attitude, and wearing the dress, ornaments, and symbols, of a divine being, a Hindu divin- ity or a Buddha. In order to express the assumption of the human person after death into the divine supramundane essence, or in order to indicate that the living prince is an emanation, incarna- tion, reflex, or avatar of the highest essence, he is identified with the superhuman being. The idea is that the prince, and, funda- mentally, all beings, all of us, are brought forth from the divine creative essence, are virtually parts of the Highest Being. This is a concept insisted upon in later Hinduism and Buddhism. It is but a logical consequence of earlier basic concepts. It is implied in the monistic idea developed in the philosophy of the U pani- shads and illustrated through the pictorial script of classic Hindu mythology-the idea, namely, of man's Inner Self (atman) as iden- tical with the only Universal Self (brahman). 101"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"This figure of Prajfii-Piramiti is a \"consecration portrait\" celebrating the divinization of a certain Javanese queen.

The Elephant THE elephant as a \"determinant\" placed beneath the anthropo- morphic symbols of divine powers is a common feature in the early Buddhist reliefs at Bhirhut. Most of the divinities are not labeled and cannot be identified; others bear the names of cer- tain yakshas and yakshinis-male and female earth genii, patrons of fertility and wealth. The association of a pair of elephants with the figure of the goddess Lotus is also a feature of the Buddhist art of the second and first centuries B.C. (Bhirhut and Safichi; 102"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"d. Figure 15.) From there it can be traced through the whole extensive course of Hindu and Buddhist iconography, down to the late Hindu temples of the South. In Hindu miniatures and present-day popular drawings it is a constantly recurring motif. Furthennore, on the very early seals of Mohenjo-Daro-among the earliest art works not only of India but of human civilization -the elephant is depicted, sometimes standing before a manger; but no clew is offered to the symbolic meaning of the animal. We well may ask: What is the function and connotation of this majes- tic fonn? Little help is offered by the religious monuments, but much can be learned from a study of the traditional medical encyclo- pedias devoted to the domestication and care of the elephant. The owning of elephants, it appears, was a prerogative of kings. Elephants were hunted and captured in the wilderness and then kept on forest reservations, or in garrisons, for the purposes of warfare-they served as a corps of heavy and highly mobile cav- alry, a sort of armored division on legs; or the elephants were assigned to the royal stables, to serve as mounts of state and for purposes of magic. • The standard encyclopedia on the subject is the Hastyo:yur- veda, \"The Sacred Wisdom (veda) of the Longevity (tiyus) of the Elephants (hasti).\" It is a compendium ofoveq600 verse-couplets, in addition to chapters in prose. There is also a briefer treatise, \"The Playful Treatise on the Elephants\" (mtitangalilti), which contains a number of remarkable mythical details. We learn, for example, from the latter work, t that when • [In the Vedas the elephant is a symbol of royal splendor. and Indra is \"as it were an elephant\"; the symbolism survives in Ganesha. and the Buddha is more than once still called an elephant.-AKC.] t Mtltat'lgaliltl, I.

The moment the celestial bird broke from its egg, Brahma, the demiurge-creator, took the two half egg- shells in his hands and sang over them seven holy melodies (saman). Through the vinue of these incantations Airivata came forth, the divine elephant that was to become the mount of Indra. The name Airavata sounds like a metronymic appellation-as though, according to some as yet undiscovered tradition, this elephant were the son of a female called Iravati. Irrawaddy, we know, is the name of the principal river and life-artery of Burma; also, it is the alternate name of a great river in the Punjab, the Rbi. Ira, furthermore, means water, any drinkable fluid, milk, refreshment, the liquid contained in the cosmic Milky Ocean. Iravati then would be \"She who is possessed of fluid\" (ira). This \"She\" would be the river itself; for rivers and waters are feminine, maternal, fostering divinities, and water is a female element. Pursuing the genealogy one step further: Ira (\"Fluid\") is one of the daughters of an archaic demiurge or creator-god named Daksha, \"The Dexterous One,\" a figure parallel to, and in func- tion partly identical with, Brahma, the Lord Creator of Beings (praja-pati). Ira, in another context, is known as the queen-consort of still another old creator-god and father of creatures, Kashyapa, the Old Tortoise Man, and as such she is the mother of all vegetable life. Airavata is thus related in many ways, through his mother, to the life-fluid of the cosmos. This relationship is evinced further by the fact that the name Airavata is used to designate both the rainbow-which is regarded as Indra's weapon-and a certain type of lightning: the two most conspicuous luminous manifes- tations of thunderstorm and rain. Airavata was the first divine elephant to proceed from the egg- shell in the right hand of Brahma; he was followed by seven more males. From the shell in Brahm's left then appeared eight female 10 4"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"elephants. The sixteen constituted eight couples, and became the ancestors of all elephants, both in heaven and on earth. They became also the Dig-Gajas, or \"elephants (gaja) of the directions of space (dik).\" • They support the universe at the four quarters and four points between. Elephants are the caryatids of the universe. As such they very properly appear in the rock-cut Shiva-temple at Eliiri, \"The Temple of the Lord of Mount KaiHisa.\" (Figure 26.) This is one of the great classic monuments of Hindu religious architecture. It dates from the eighth century A.D. Nowhere has more adequate and dignified expression been given to the majesty and grandeur of the elephant-this sole surviving representative of the ancient species of the giant mastodon, more ancient than the rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and other pachyderms. In these figures there is an intimate feeling for the character of the elephant, at once realistic and monumental, testifying to the long and close companionship of the Hindu with this mighty beast. Another and totally different account of the origin of Airivata and his consort, Abhramii, appears in the celebrated myth of the Churning of the Milky Ocean. t After the gods and titans had labored at their task for a thousand years, a curious assortment of personifications and symbols began to arise out of the milk of the universe. Among the earlier figures were the goddess Lotus, and Airavata, the milk-white elephant. Finally appeared the physician of the gods bearing the Amrita, the elixir of immortal- ity, in a milk-white bowl. A special value is attached to the so-called \"white elephants\"- albinos showing light or rosy spots-because they suggest the origin of their ancestor from the Universal Milk.

Abhramu, the name of Airavata's consort, denotes this special power: mu means \"to fashion, to fabricate, to bind or knit\"; abhra means \"cloud.\" Abhramu is \"Producing Clouds,\" \"She Who Knits or Binds the Clouds\"-specifically, the beneficent monsoon- clouds that quicken vegetation after the scorching period of summer heat. When these fail to appear, there will be drought, no crops, and a general famine. In the wonderful age of the mythological beginnings, the off- spring of the original eight elephants had wings. Like clouds, they freely roamed about the sky. But a group of them lost the wings through heedlessness, and the majestic race, ever since, has been forced to remain on the ground. The story is told of how a flight of elephants had the misfortune to incur the sudden wrath of a saint-ascetic-a type that must be approached with only the ut- most respect and then treated very cautiously, for ascetics are of a most susceptible and irascible nature. Inadvertently, these blithe, winged elephants one day alighted on the branch of a giant tree north of the Himalayas. An ascetic named Dirghatapas, \"Long Austerity,\" had his seat beneath it and was at that moment teaching-when the heavy arm of the tree, unable to support the load, broke and fell upon the pupils' heads. A number were killed, but the elephants, not worrying in the least, nimbly caught themselves in flight and settled on another bough. The angry saint cursed them roundly. Henceforth they and their whole race were deprived of their wings, and remained on the ground sub- servient to man. And what was more: together with their faculty of roaming through the air, they forfeited also the divine power- which is characteristic of the clouds and of all divinities-of as- suming various forms at will.· It is said that horses, too, originally had wings. Indra sheared them off with his thunderbolt, to make the free-ranging animals • MiJtaAgalJliJ, I. 106"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"docile, so that they might draw the chariots both of the celestials and of the king-warriors of earth.· Furthermore, even the tower- ing mountain ranges-whose snow-capped summits intermingle with the clouds and so closely resemble them that sometimes it is very difficult to say whether the form be cloud or mountain-were winged in the beginning; indeed, they were a variety of cloud. Indra deprived them of the power of flight in order to steady with their weight the shaky surface of the land. t As Airavata belongs to Indra, so elephants belong to kings. In stately processions they are the king's symbolical mount; in war- fare they are the watchtower and citadel from which he controls the strategy of battle. But their most important function is to attract their celestial relatives, the clouds, the heavenly elephants. Hence Hindu kings keep elephants for the welfare of their sub- jects; and to give a white elephant away would make the ruler very unpopular among his people. But precisely such a deed, inspired by compassion for the suf- ferings of a neighboring kingdom, is ascribed to the Buddha in his next to last existence. At that time, as a Bodhisattva, or Buddha-in-the-making, he was born as the prince Vishvantara.t Practicing the highest virtues of self-detachment, self-sacrifice, generosity and compassion, he gave away the white elephant of his father's realm to a neighboring country suffering from drought and famine. His subjects thereupon felt betrayed and forsaken, and forced him into exile.

In a yearly ritual devoted to rainfall, the fertility of crops, the fecundity of cattle and man, and the general welfare of the king- dom, the white elephant, so constantly associated with the goddess Lotus, plays a significant and conspicuous role. Such a festival is described in the Hastyayurveda.· The elephant is painted white with sandal paste, and then led in solemn procession through the capital. Its attendants are men wearing women's dresses and mak- ing merry with clownish, salacious remarks and witticisms. Through this ritualistic female disguise they do honor to the cos- mic female principle, the maternal, procreative, feeding energy of nature, and by the ritualistic utterance of licentious language stimulate the dormant sexual energy of the living power. (The occurrence together of these two devices can be traced over the entire world.) The elephant is finally worshiped by the high officials of the realm, both civil and military. The text remarks: \"If they did not pay worship to the elephant, the king and the kingdom, the army and the elephants, would be doomed to perish, because a divinity would have been disregarded. Contrariwise, if due worship is paid to the elephant, they will thrive and prosper together with their wives and sons, the country, the army, and the elephants. Crops will sprout in due time; Indra, the rain god, will send rain in due time; there will be no plague, no drought. They will live a hundred years (a full lifetime) with many sons and many cattle and will have a sturdy progeny. Whoever wishes to have sons will have sons, and longings after riches and other goods will also be fulfilled. The earth will abound in treasures of precious metals and jewels.\" Thus the worship of the white elephant, as a divinity not to be disregarded, bestows on man all those earthly blessings which the goddess Lotus, Shri-Lakshmi, Fortune and Prosperity, the 108"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Mother Earth, fertile and abundant with water and riches, has in store.

By its magic presence it conjures the winged fellow clouds of the atmosphere to approach. When the earthly elephant cloud is duly worshiped, its celestial relatives feel gratified and are moved to show forth their gratitude by favoring the country with abundant rain.

Her magic power of salvation is shared-only to a lesser degree-by all the bodies of water in the land. In the beautiful black image from Bengal she is represented as an embodiment of both celestial and earthly vitality and sweetness. She is a personification of health and abundance, dignity and prowess. A rich diadem frames her fore- head; a necklace descends to her breasts; the rich ornaments and chains of her girdle and loincloth designate her wealth-bestowing virtue. She stands upon a sea-monster (makara), which serves her as a vehicle. The gentle ripples of the giant stream, as though its surface were animated by a light breeze, play over her firm and slender body. Much like a Bengal bride or happy young house- wife, she is intended to procreate new life and to rule in the house. In the image of this river goddess is embodied the idyllic, earth- bound aspect of prosperous Hindu peasant life-its devout union with the divine forces that pervade the living organism of the universe; its recognition of the gentle play of divinity in the sim- ple wonders of the surrounding world. Physical contact with the body of the goddess Ganga has the magic effect of transforming automatically the nature of the devotee. As if by an alchemical process of purification and trans- mutation, the base metal of his earthly nature becomes subli- mated; he becomes an embodiment of the divine essence of the highest eternal realm. In the hymn just quoted, that realm is conceived under the image of Shiva's supernal mansion, again as Shiva's divine form. It is to be regarded not as something re- mote from the world of man, but as the core of every least exist- ence, the source of every moment of life. The Ganges itself is regarded as flowing directly from that realm-and thus the heart is conducted back along its blessed course to the place of the Beginning and the End.

The most extensive work of relief-sculpture extant in Indian art-one of the largest. most beautiful and dramatic reliefs of all time-is the representation of a great and celebrated myth de- scribing the descent of the Ganges from heaven to earth. (Fig- ure 27.) A huge wall of rock, rising vertically in the fierce sunshine of southern India, has been converted into a prodigious master- piece, teeming with hosts of gods, titans, genii, serpent princes, human beings, and animals, all converging towards a great cleft in the middle of the composition. The tableau, measuring twenty- seven meters in len~th by nine in height and covered with more than a hundred figures, stands amidst a number of other aston- ishing sculptural works, on the shore of the Indian ocean, at Mimallapuram, near Madras. These are the remains of a gigan- tic artistic and religious enterprise, undertaken by the Pallava kings of South India in the seventh century A.D. The intention was to transform a striking group of natural cliffs and boulders into a cluster of little temples and great shrines, all cut from the living rock. The Descent of the Ganges is rendered in a realistic style. Fur- thermore, on the upper surface of the ledge immediately above the central perpendicular cleft, we find today a number of pre- pared channels: there was originally a cistern up there, about twenty-three feet square, with plastered walls; rock-cut steps lead up from the ground. Apparently, on certain festival occasions, the cistern was filled and the water allowed to flow down the cleft in the form of a cascade, simulating the descent of a mountain torrent-Gangi falling from heaven to the Himilayas, and streaming, then, down to earth.

The first of these is Agastya, patron saint of southern India, who is sup- posed to have played an important role in the colonization of that part of the country. He is represented as a great philosopher, kind-hearted, and unsurpassed in the science of archery. In Vedic tradition he is reputed to have been born from the seed of the two great gods, Mitra and Varuna. When the Vindhya Moun- tains, at one time, in an excess of pride, so enlarged themselves that they fairly eclipsed the sun and even blocked its path, this mighty ascetic, by the magic power of his will, humbled them, forced them to prostrate themselves before him, and thus saved the world. He is famous especially for the marvels accomplished by his digestive juices. There was, for example, a certain demon in the shape of a ram, who, believing himself to be absolutely undi- gestible, had developed a cruel trick: disguising himself as a palatable dish of meat, this malicious being would permit himself to be served by his brother to the prospective victim. And when he thus gained entrance into the stomach of his enemy, the brother who had served the dish would cry: \"Come out, Brotherl\" Whereupon the demon would burst forth and the victim explode. However, when he tried his stratagem on Agastya he was fooled; for the saint-who somehow is related to solar energy and its fierce devouring power in the south of India-digested the tasty meal in less than no time. When the other called, \"Come out, Brotherl\" nothing was left to escape but a little wind. Now Agastya one day put the devouring tropical solar heat of his gastric energy to a major test: he swallowed the entire ocean. His intentions were good and the deed a brave one, but inciden- tally it had the effect of depriving the earth and all beings of the necessary life-maintaining water. That was what made it neces- sary for the Ganga, the celestial river, a kind of Milky Way, to descend from the sky.

They would be chased into the ocean, but by night would emerge, as fresh as ever, and harass the holy men. The latter, in desperation, appealed to the celebrated saint. Agastya solved the problem at a stroke by sim- ply swallowing the sea. But now the earth was left without its water, and all its creatures were brought to the point of perishing. When a person tries to be particularly helpful, he sometimes causes more trouble than he removes. So it was, at any rate, in the case of Agastya with his boundless digestive fire. It fell to the share of another superhuman saint to put an end to the terrible drought. This hero, the pious king, Bhagiratha, was the scion of a long lineage of kings descending from Manu Vaivasvata,· and he was sorely in need of water to appease and gratify the ashes and souls of a host of his deceased forefathers who had perished in another, earlier, mythical catastrophe. He decided to force his will upon the celestial POWeTS and compel them to release the heavenly Ganges itself, to send it down to succor the earth. Committing the administration of his realm to his ministers, he proceeded to a celebrated center of pilgrimage sacred to Shiva, a place called Gokarna, \"Cow's Ear,\" in the south. Here, for a thousand years, he devoted himself to fierce penances. With unflinching determination he accumulated superhuman energy through self-inflicted bodily sufferings. Standing with arms uplifted (urdhavabahu) he practiced the \"penance of the five fires\" (pancatapas). t Eventually Brahma, pleased and attracted by this ascetic fervor, manifested himself, declared himself satisfied with Bhagiratha's perfect asceticism, and promised to grant a wish. Whereupon the kingly saint asked the god to let Gangi descend to the earth. • The Solar Dynasty, reigning in Oudh (Ayodhyl), whose most famous issue was !Uma, hero of the lUmtl,tJ,tJ. t The ascetic lits beneath the merciless IUD, with four great fires blazing around him, one in each of the four directions."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Brahma was agreeable. but declared that it would be necessary to gain the grace of Shiva.

It is employed, especially, for the purposes of creation. The god-creator heats himself and thereby produces the universe: by internal incan- descence, by giving forth an emanation in the form of perspira- tion, or by hatching the cosmic egg. Utter impassivity under self-inflicted mortification elevates the human being above the exigencies and limitations of human nature. It equates him with the superior energy of the cosmic powers. It displays him endowed with that supreme indifference to weal and woe which is inherent in the forces of nature and which is mythologically personified in the impassive semblances of the gods.

The climactic episode sets the stage and dominates the picture, but within its field side-exhibits are inserted. These review the most important stages of the action that led up to the dramatic, central moment. It is on the latter that attention is first and finally brought to focus. The centralizing episode of the Ganges relief is the descent of the celestial stream. This is depicted in the central cleft of the great rock wall. From the cistern above (which we now have to imagine) water rushes down. A giant serpent king, covered by the torrent, is moving upward, his powerful serpent body undulating with slow movements; shielded by his halo of snake heads and hoods, he greets the water, rejoicing with rapt devotion. (Fig- ure 27.) He is followed by a snake queen in a similar attitude of bhakti, devout rapture and pious bliss. Beneath her, again, is a giant animal-shaped serpent-genius lifting its body. Meanwhile, from all sides flock together gods, celestial beings, demons and genii, men and animals, to observe the miracle that is to rescue life on earth. But to the left of the cleft, on the lower level, we have a scene that precedes in time the final event. Here we see a sanctuary with a saint squatting before it. (Figure 28.) The saint is Bhagiratha, in yoga posture, lean from fasting, absorbed in concentration, seeking to gain the favor of Brahma. It is a most impressive repre- sentation of ascetic fervor, executed in a bold and graceful style, at once strong and subtle, sparing in detail, convincing and effec- tive. Bhagiratha is squatting before the sanctuary of Gokama, which is here shown as a little temple in typical Pallava style.

These are the angel faces (gandharoa- mukha) of the inhabitants of the heavenly palaces of the gods. The word for temple, devakula, de-ul, means \"the house of a god\": a temple is an earthly copy, or symbol, of a god's celestial abode. Bhagiratha is bent inward. He is conjuring the apparition of the divinity. Two other ascetics are squatting in yoga posture on the other side of the temple-door. (Their heads have been de- stroyed.) They are the pupils or attendants of Bhagiratha, fol- lowing him in his ascetic training. The decisive moment of the exercises has been reached. Attracted and bound by the saint's unflinching concentration, the divinity has just made his appear- ance from the dark interior of the shrine. This important scene of the con juring up of Brahma at Gokarna in the south of India is placed near the lower margin of the relief. Near the top, and to the left of the central cleft, is represented the conjuring of Shiva on the Himalaya height. (This is visible in Figure 27.) The bearded saint is again Bhagiratha. Body emaciated by fasting, he stands in one of the typical pos- tures of tapas-yoga, poised on a single leg in pillar-like rigidity both arms uplifted (ilrdhvabiihu), the fingers firmly interlocked. And again, he has just attained the goal of his fervent endeavor: Shiva stands manifest before him, four-armed, of giant stature, left lower hand extended in a boon-bestowing gesture (varadii- mudrii), and accompanied by the dwarfish, potbellied spirits of his attendant host (gatza). The god's head is surmounted by an enormous tiara of matted hair. The emblems in his hands are not clearly discernible: the huge, staff-like weapon may be either his trident (triSilla) or his spear. To the right of the saint are two large aquatic birds, wild geese, winging to the watercourse.

Celestial couples walk nimbly through the air to greet the down- pour of the water. Monkeys hustle through the wilderness. In a bold and superbly animated style, at once broad and deli- cate in its effects, the various forms of life-divine, titanic, human, animal-are perfectly differentiated and characterized. Overlook- ing minute traits and details, this work of art aims to convey the attitudes, the typical motions or postures of repose, of the beings concerned. It insists on the basic kinship of all creatures. All issue from the one life-reservoir and are sustained on their vari- ous planes, whether heavenly or earthbound, by the one life- energy. Here is an art inspired by the monistic view of life that appears everywhere in Hindu philosophy and myth. Everything is alive. The entire universe is alive; only the degrees of life vary. Everything proceeds from the divine life-substance-and-energy as a temporary transmutation. All is a part of the universal display of God's Maya.

They are a company of young brahmins who have come to the riverbank. The middle one carries on his shoulder a pitcher full of water.

The heavenly couples of gods and goddesses are borne along lightly. They do not share the bulk and weight of earthly creatures.

Among the divinities of the Hindu pan- theon, only those not too closely associated with special func- tions, activities, or departments of nature, can serve as embodi- ments of the personified Absolute. Agni, the Fire God, specifically an aspect of the element Fire,· is much too particularized to represent the Source of all five of the elements. Likewise Vayu, the 'Wind God, is specialized as the representative of the element Air in motion, hence is incapable of representing the Universal. Indra is the lord, primarily, of clouds, thunderstorm, and rain. Even the figure of Brahma is unsatisfactory, in spite of the fact that he is a member of the highest Hindu triad of Brahma the ~ . -- Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, Shiva the Destroyer..For in Hindu \"\"'C\"\" mythology Brahma personifies exclusively the positive aspect of the life-process of the universe, and is never represented as de- stroying what he has produced.

In his myths he does not exhibit, through a multitude of mutually antagonis- tic attitudes and activities, such an ambivalent, self-contradictory, enigmatic character as would render him fit to represent in per- sonalized form the paradoxical, all-comprehending nature of the Absolute. Vishnu and Shiva, on the other hand, as well as the Goddess Mother of the World, are strongly visualized as both terrible and benign, creative and destructive, hideous and comely.

The plenitude of Shiva's mutually antagonistic functions and aspects is made evident by the fact that his worshipers invoke him by a hundred names. He is described also under twenty- five \"playful manifestations\" (liliimurti), or according to another tradition, sixteen. Occasionally we find the multitude of expres- sive aspects reduced to five: (1) The Beneficent Manifestation (anugrahamurti), (2) The Destructive Manifestation (samhiira- murti), (3) The Vagrant Mendicant (bhi~iitanamurti), (4) The Lord of Dancers (nrttamurti), (5) The Great Lord (mahesa- murti). Among the titles included in the longer lists are The God with the Moon in his Hair (candraSekhara), The Supporter of the Ganges (gangiidhara), The Slayer of the Elephant-Demon (gajasamhiira), Consort of the Goddess Uma and Father of Skanda, the War God (somiiskanda), The Lord Who is Half Woman (ardhaniiri.roara), Lord of the Peak (sikharesvara), Lord of Physi- cians (vaidyaniitha), The Destroyer of Time (kiilasamhiira), Lord of Cattle (paSupati), The Beneficent (sankara), The Propitious (siva), The Howler (rudra). But the basic and most common object of worship in Shiva shrines is the phallus or lingam. This form of the god can be traced back to the worship of primitive stone symbols as early as the neolithic period. Already at Mohenjo-Daro • the lingam occurs, side by side with other important symbols similar to those employed in later Hindu iconography. (Figure 25.) The lingam denotes the male creative energy of Shiva, and in con- tradistinction to all other representations of the god is called \"the fixed, or immovable\" (dhruva), \"the fundamental form\" (mulavigraha). Compared with it the other representations are regarded as secondary. The anthropomorphic images are known as \"movable\" (cala), • Cf. pp. 95-6. mIWtz. u6"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"\"festival, or ceremonial, figures\" (utsavamilrti), \"images for fes- tival enjoyment\" (bhogamilrti).

Stand- ing in files along the corridors that surround or lead up to the main shrine, they display the various aspects or manifestations of the god, and compose an instructive picture gallery for the pilgrim devotee. The great subterranean rock-cut cave-temple of Elephanta, near Bombay, one of the most impressive and beautiful monu- ments of Hindu religious art, is adorned with many anthropo- morphic representations of Shiva, as well as with scenes from his rich mythology. The central sanctuary of this extensive tem- ple is a simple, monumental, square shrine, with four entrances on the four sides, each guarded by a pair of divine door keepers. (Figure 29.) Within is the austere symbol of the lingam, emanat- ing to the four quarters its all-productive energy. This lingam, as the main stone image, forms the center of the innermost cella, the holy of holies or \"womb house\" (garbha-griha). In the inner- most recess of the organism of the temple it serenely stands, con- stituting the life-center of the subterranean cave. As the symbol of male creative energy, the lingam is frequently combined with the primary symbol of female creative energy, the yoni, the latter forming the base of the image with the former rising from its center. This serves as a representation of the cre- ative union that procreates and sustains the life of the universe. Lingam and yoni, Shiva and his goddess, symbolize the antago- nistic yet co-operating forces of the sexes.

(Fig- ure 80.) Shiva in this myth is represented as winning a momentous victory over the other two supreme divinities of the Hindu triad, Brahmi and Vishnu; and this victory, if we may judge from the literary remains, corresponds to an actual, historical develop- ment. For in the earlier and classic Purinas t Shiva is no more than a function or mask assumed by Vishnu whenever the mo- ment approaches for the reabsorption of the universe. Only in a later stratification of Purinic myth :t: do we find Shiva coming to the fore to enact independently and alone all three of the great world roles of creation, preservation, and destruction. The myth of \"The Origin of the Lingam\" (lingobhava) § opens with the familiar primeval situation: no universe, only water and the starless night of the lifeless interval between dissolution and creation. In the infinite ocean all the seeds, all the potentiali- ties, of subsequent evolution rest in a dormant state of undiffer- entiation. Vishnu, the anthropomorphic embodiment of this fluid of life, is floating-as we have seen him before-in and upon the substance of his own essence.

But now a new and astonishing event: Vishnu perceives, all of a sudden, another luminous apparition, and it is approaching him with the swiftness of light, shining with the brilliance of a galaxy of suns. It is Brahma, the fashioner of the universe, the four-headed one, full of yogic wisdom. Smiling, this new arrival inquires of the recumbent giant: \"Who are you? How did you originate? What are you doing here? I am the first progenitor of all beings; I am He Who Originated from Himself'\" Vishnu begged to differ. \"On the contrary,\" he protested, \"it is I who am the creator and destroyer of the universe. I have created and destroyed it time and again.\" The two mighty presences proceeded to contest each other's claims and to quarrel. And while they were arguing in the time- less void, presently they perceived rising out of the ocean a tow- ering lingam crowned with flame. Rapidly it grew into infinite space. The two divinities, ceasing their discussion, regarded it with amazement. They could measure neither its height nor its depth. Brahma said: \"You plunge; I shall fly upward. Let us try to discover its two ends.\" The two gods assumed their well known animal forms, Brahma the gander, Vishnu the boar. The bird winged into the heavens, the boar dove into the deep. In opposite directions, on and on, they raced but could attain to neither limit; for while the boar descended and Brahma climbed, the lingam grew and grew. Presently the side of the prodigious phallus burst open, and in the niche-like aperture the lord of the lingam stood revealed, Shiva, the force supreme of the universe. While Brahma and Vishnu bowed before him in adoration, he solemnly proclaimed himself to be the origin of them both.

The Phenomenon of Expanding Form BUT let us now consider. for a moment, the monument in which this mythological idea has been represented. (Figure 30.) Some years ago I paid a visit to the Musee Guimet in Paris to see this work of art which the museum had then just acquired. I was already familiar with its myth. And as I stood before it. suddenly there dawned on me an awareness of something which I imme- diately recognized as characteristic of other Hindu monuments and symbols-a particular phenomenon of style-an aesthetic effect which I have encountered nowhere except in certain of the most remarkable and significant Hindu creations. I should like to call it. \"the phenomenon of the growing. or expanding. form.\" It is now quite clear to me that this particular monument was not intended to be regarded. deciphered. or understood. as some- thing static. of abiding, concrete dimensions.

This piece of sculpture might be said not merely to com- memorate or signify a mythical event, but actually to exhibit the process of its taking place. While Brahma and Vishnu speed in opposite directions, the substance of the stone correspond- ingly expands, outmeasuring their movement. The solid rock is apparently animated by an energy of growth. The niche-like split in its side seems actually to be widening, unfolding, to disclose the anthropomorphic apparition within. The solid, static mass of the stone, by a subtle artifice of the craftsman, has been con- verted into a dynamomorphic, multiple event. In this respect, this piece of sculpture is more like a motion picture than a painting. The notion that there is nothing static, nothing abiding, but only the flow of a relentless process, with everything originating, growing, decaying, vanishing-this wholly dynamic view of life, of the individual and of the universe, is one of the fundamental conceptions (as we have already seen) of later Hinduism. We discovered it in the tale of the Ant Parade. It is of the essence of the conception of Maya. We shall study it again in the cosmic Dance of Shiva, where all the features and creatures of the liv- ing world are interpreted as momentary flashes from the limbs of the Lord of the Dance. In the phenomenon of the growing or expanding form an effect of this typically Hindu \"total dy- namism\" is imparted to a solid monument; the elusive element of time is woven, with its imperceptible flow, into the pattern and substance of a block of stone. Once having become aware of the effect, we can rediscover it, again and again; for the Hindu craftsmen have freely employed their subtle artifice. Consider, for example, the celebrated relief from Badami shown in Figure 31. This is a specimen of early Chalukya art, from the sixth century A.D., representing Vishnu in the form of his fifth avatar, as the pigmy who suddenly waxed into the cosmic giant. According to the story, a mighty demon or titan had driven all the lesser divinities from their seats, and"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"in order to wrest the world from the terrible grasp, the essence of all being, Vishnu, maintainer of the universe, descended-as he had so often descended before and would descend so often again-out of his transcendental quietude into the troubled sphere of cosmic event. Born of the good woman Aditi, mother of Indra and Indra's brother divinities, he appeared in the form of a brahmin pigmy, no bigger than a stunted child. And this unimpressive, rather amusing little figure, bearing a parasol such as brahmins are wont to carry, comically craved audience with the demon tyrant, and asked of him a boon. What he wished was only as much space as he might cover with three of his puny strides. But when the titan, entertained, freely granted the tri- fling favor, 10, the god, mightily waxing. swelling in every limb, with his first stride stepped beyond the sun and moon, with his second reached the limits of the universe, and with his third re- turned to set his foot on the head of the conquered foe. In the Badami relief both the pigmy form and that of the giant infinitely expanding are represented side by side, signifying re- spectively the beginning and the process of the miracle. The vic- tor is depicted as about to step on the head of the foe, either to crush him, or (if he but recognize and pay worship to the Pres- ence) to bless him with the touch of Vishnu's foot. The body of the dilating god crowds with its tiara the upper frame of the composition, as if to burst the bounds of space. The dynamic character of the whole universe, with all its creatures, as con- ceived by Hindu philosophy, is rendered in this impressive cen- tral figure. The work as a whole is to be deciphered and compre- hended, not as a static symbol, but as an event; it is a rendition of something actually coming to pass. The quality of time per- meates the inert matter of the stone. Flow and growth transform the mineral substance into an organism interminably expanding. There is a colossal Shiva-image from Parel, near Bombay, in which this peculiar sculptural effect is realized in a particularly striking way. (Figure 82.)

They probably represent the hosts or ga1)4S of the god, his followers and attendants, who in countenance, figure, attire, and attributes, resemble the divinity himself. Some carry musical instruments, a tambour, a 8ute. On the lowermost level of the monument five such figures are crowded, roughly sketched, only one quite finished. These correspond to the five hosts of"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Shiva's followers, each host being represented by a single indi- vidual. Then to either side of the two upper figures of the central column, as they emerge and grow from each other, the motif of the emanating lateral forms is powerfully restated. Here the mul- tiples of the central god repeat with both hands the gestures (mudra) of the presence of the center and display identical sym- bols. With their legs in attitudes of flight, they break forth from the axial Shiva-pillar, soaring out from their point of origin. Their faces remain turned back to it, as if to confirm their in- trinsic identity with the center. In this bold and monumental work, accessories, reduced to a minimum, are of an extremely simple style: smooth rings, wrist- lets, and armlets. Whereas in many Hindu images (born from and meant for inner visualization) the descriptive details and ornamental features so insist upon themselves that they smother the piece in static pedantry, in the present case they are strenu- ously subdued in favor of a vigorous, effulgent, almost sweeping elan. This relief is conceived, and should be read by the eye, as a never-ending process. The giant granite slab seems to be ex- panding, both vertically and sidewise, with the life-force of the athletic organisms that throb and heave across its surface. The physical power of the seven principal figures is gathered in their splendid chests. These are fine examples of the typical chest of the lion-like, broad-shouldered, slim-waisted Hindu hero, the Indian Superman (mahapur~a); also, the broad chest of the perfect yogi, trained by breathing exercises and capable of storing in Ytfinite quantity the life-element of pra1)a~ \"the Breath.\" VThe piece is a \"Shiva Trimurti,\" • a rendition of the exfoliation of Shiva into three appearances or aspects (tri-milrti).

The understanding of this unity is the goal of Hindu wisdom. The power not to be confused by the fluent play of Maya-energy, but to rejoice at the sight of even the most harrowing of its manifestations, consti- tutes the victory and solace of this view. Hindu wisdom, Hindu religion, accepts the doom and forms of death as the dark-tones of a cosmic symphony, this tremendous music being the utter- ance. paradoxically, of the supreme quietude and silence of the Absolute. Every moment of experience is suffused with a deep Dionysian joy, deeper far than the pains and disasters that break the surfaces of our lives and worlds.

Below are re- posing their respective animal vehicles (vahana), the lion, coun- terpart of the Goddess, and Nandi, Shiva's bull. Shiva has four arms. With one he holds his consort, with two others he exhibits the trident (his weapon as a hero) and the rosary (his emblem as an ascetic), which together symbolize the combination in him of the active principle and the contempla- tive, the extravert and the introvert. His remaining right hand, before his chest, holds a stalk-like symbol twined with the tendril of a lotus plant and crowned with lotus petals.

Thus the human couple are shown to participate in the mystical union of the divine; they, too, are of one flesh.

Such chowry bearers· gen- erally flank the presences of kingly persons sitting in state, but as a rule the whisks are held uplifted. In the present case, the attendants are so distracted by pious rapture that they are for- getting their appointed office. Indeed, the emotion with which the god and his spouse are gazing at each other affects all of the figures, both human and divine, privileged to behold the spectacle. Not only the donors and chowry bearers, but the hov- ering swarm of Shiva's hosts, the heavenly musicians, are filled with exalted bliss.

She has her living counterpart in every woman, as the God in every man. But these seated couples are static in their presentation of the mystery. A more dynamic symbol-characteristically Indian in its rendition of growing or expanding form-is represented by the profoundly eloquent Shri Yantra, \"Auspicious Yantra,\" \"Yantra above Yantras.\" (Figure 36.) Though apparently no more than a geometrical device, this intricate linear composition is con- ceived and designed as a support to meditation-more precisely, to a concentrated visualization and intimate inner experience of the polar play and logic-shattering paradox of eternity and time. But before its meaning can unfold and its effects begin to be ex- perienced in the mind, the beholder must understand the exact relationship of its concise and compendious delineation to the basic principles of Oriental metaphysics. This composition sum- marizes in a single moment the whole sense of the Hindu world of myth and symbol. To begin with, then, what is the meaning of the term \"yantra\"? The suffix -tra in Sanskrit is used to form substantives denoting instruments or tools. For example, khan means \"dig,\" khani, \"digging or rooting up\"; khanitra is \"an instrument for digging, a spade, hoe, pickax, shovel, a primitive stick for drawing fur- rows and for digging holes in which to deposit seed.\" Similarly, man (related etymologically to \"mental\") means \"think or have in mind\"; mantra therefore is \"an instrument for evoking or producing something in our minds,\" specifically \"a holy formula"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"or magic spell for evoking or bringing to mind the vision and inner presence of a god.\" • Correspondingly, yantra is an instru- ment to make yam. What, however, is the meaning of yam? \"Curb, subdue, rule, control.\" The verb yam means to gain control over the energy inherent in some element or being. Accordingly, yantra denotes, primarily, any kind of machine-machine, that is to say, in a pre-industrial, pre-technical sense: a dam to collect water for irrigation, a catapult to hurl stones against a fort-any mechanism built to yield energy for some definite purpose of man's will. In Hindu devotional tradition, \"yantra\" is the general term for instruments of worship, namely, idols, pictures, or geometrical diagrams. A yantra may serve as (1) a representation of some per- sonification or aspect of the divine, (2) a model for the worship of a divinity immediately within the heart, after the parapher- nalia of outward devotion (idol, perfumes, offerings, audibly uttered formulae) have been discarded by the advanced initiate, (3) a kind of chart or schedule for the gradual evolution of a vision, while identifying the Self with its slowly varying contents, that is to say, with the divinity in all its phases of transformation. In this case the yantra contains dynamic elements. We may say, then, that a yantra is an instrument designed to curb the psychic forces by concentrating them on a pattern, and in such a way that this pattern becomes reproduced by the wor- shiper's visualizing power. It is a machine to stimulate inner visualizations, meditations, and experiences. The given pattern may suggest a static vision of the divinity to be worshiped, the superhuman presence to be realized, or it may develop a series • Originally the word mantra meant simply a verbal instrument for producing 1OIDe- thing in our minds.

The latter is the richer, more interesting type, and makes the greater demands upon the initiate. It works in two directions: first, forward as a course of evolution, then backward again as a process of involution, undoing the visions previously unfolded. That is to say, it restates in miniature the stages or aspects of the manifestation of the Absolute in the evolution and involution of the world. Furthermore, the visualizing power of the devotee is required to follow in two ways this twofold process of creation and dissolution: on the one hand, as a temporal and spatial de- velopment, but on the other, as something transcending the categories of space and time-a simultaneity of antagonistic as- pects in the one and only Essence. Thus, whereas on the one hand the dynamic diagrams suggest a continuous process of expansion from the center of the pattern to the circumference and requiring a passage of time for its course, on the other hand they are to be grasped as an enduring hierarchy, or gradation, of simultaneously manifested degrees of being, with the highest value situated at the center. These degrees symbolize the vari- ous transformations, or aspects, of the Absolute on the phenome- nal plane of Miyi-Shakti, - and at the same time supply a pic- torial analysis of the structure of man's soul and body; for the Highest Essence (brahman), which is the core of the world, is identical with the Highest Self (titman), the kernel of man's existence. t The visualizations, meditations, and experiences • For de&nidona of Mlyi and Shakti, cf. pp. 14-6, mFG. t BrGhman fa the Life that lives in all things, [Heradeitus' \"ever-living Fire,\" Plato'. \"ever-progenitive Nature\"-AKCJ. \"It is never born. nor does It ever die, nor, having once been, does It again c:eue to be.

When utilized, in connection with the practice of yoga, the contents of the yantra diagram repre- sent those stages of consciousness that lead inward from the everyday state of naIve \"ignorance\" (avidyii), through the de- grees of yoga-experience, to the realization of the Universal Self (brahman-iitman ). Typical of the whole class are the elements of the Shri Yantra (Figure 36): (I) a square outer frame, composed of straight lines broken according to a regular pattern, (2) an inclosed arrange· ment of concentric circles and stylized lotus petals. (3) a concen- tric composition of nine interpenetrating triangles. The square framework is called, in the Tantric tradition, \"shivered\" (sisirita), i.e., trembling, as if with a chill. This curious expression does not refer to its symbolic meaning, but to its shape. What the \"shivered\" frame represents is a square sanctuary with four doors opening out to the four quarters. a landing before each entrance, and a low flight of steps leading up from the ground to the raised floor of the sanctuary. This sanctuary is the seat (pitha) of the divinity. and should be thought of as the center of the heart of the devotee. Herein resides his own particular \"Chosen Deity\" (illa-devatii), who, finally, is to be understood as a symbolization described: yet It can be experienced as the very Life within us (litman), or intuited as the Life of the cosmos (brahman). \"He who knows that It is incomprehensible, comprehends: He who conceives of It, comprehends It not.

This is the com- mon case in Tibet, where a Lamaistic tradition of circular pat- terns (mavt)ala) amplified into superb paintings has produced an inexhaustible treasury of magnificent forms. This northern Buddhist tradition developed under the influence of doctrines strongly imbued with Hindu-and especially Shiva-Shakti-ideas. For example, in the beautiful temple-ceiling from the holy city of Lhasa that is reproduced in Figure 37, a perfect yantra- diagram appears, but with a Buddha-figure in the position of the Ishta Devata, and strictly Buddhist amplifications throughout. The personification in the center is the primal, eternal, Adi- Buddha, or Vairochana. Radiating from him to the four quar- ters and the four points between are eight doubles or manifesta- tions of his essence, differing in their special colors, gestures, and attributes. These denote the specific constituents going out from the immovable Absolute into the world. Illuminating and hold- ing extended the universe, they are represented as contained within the heart of the cosmic flower. This, in turn, is set within the square sanctuary, and to each of the four quarters stands a meticulously pictured door. Beyond are lesser presences, door guardians, ceremonial umbrellas, and other symbols of the Lamaistic cult. Finally, the outermost rim of the lotus of the created universe is represented as a gigantic corolla of sixty-four varicolored petals.

From the standpoint of the per- fect Bodhisattva or Buddha-mind, there is only one essence, to wit, Buddhahood, enlightenment itself, the indescribable state or essence that is realized and attained when all the products and effects of Maya-ignorance have been transcended. This is the sheer \"Such-ness\" or \"That-ness\" beyond differentiating qualifications, definable limitations and characteristics. This is tatha-ta, literally, \"the state (-to') of being 'so' (tatha).\" Tatha means \"yes, so it is, so be it, amen.\" It is the everyday, whole- hearted affirmative. Hence the term tatha-ta, \"such-ness,\" repre- sents the utterly positive aspect of Nirvana-enlightenment, the only really real state or essence, not to be undone or dissolved. All other states of consciousness are built up and dissolved again -the waking-state with its sense experiences, its thinking and its feeling, the dream-state with its subtle apparitions, and even the states of \"higher\" experience. But the state tatha-ta is indestruc- tible; for it is at once the experience and the reality of the Abso- lute. And it is termed \"adamantine\" (vajra); for it is not to be split, disintegrated, dissolved, or even scratched, either by physi- cal violence or by the power of critical-analytical thought. The only possible anthropomorphic symbol for tatha-td is the Buddha, he who has attained to the experience of the adaman- tine. And the most appropriate symbolic object or utensil is the thunderbolt, the weapon of Father Heaven, and in later times of Indra, king of the gods. Accordingly, the thunderbolt (vajra, same term as for \"adamantine\") is the characteristic emblem of a special school of Buddhist doctrine which styles itself Vajrayana, \"The Vehicle of the Irresistible Thunderbolt,\" \"The Way to- ward the Adamantine Reality of Transcendent Truth.\" The vajra here commonly figures in every possible phase of icono- graphic decoration. It appears as a magic wand for the exorcism of evil forces, or as the handle of the bell used to mark time in the recital of sacred texts. (Figure 47.)

Vajra-sattva. \"He Whose Essence, or Being (sattva). is the Ada- mantine Substance.\" Just as the animal \"determinants\" of the Hindu gods are in essence identical with the anthropomorphic forms that they support. so also. in the case of this supreme sym- bol of the Vajrayana sect, the adamantine bolt is identical with the Buddha who holds it in his hand.

This lotus having been originally the exclusive sign and \"vehicle\" of the goddess Padma-mother. or yoni. of the universe-· it is symbolic of the procreative power (sakti) of the immortal. adamantine. eternal Substance. Thus a Buddha on or in the lotus symbolizes the essence of enlighten- ment as it permeates and sustains the universe of Time. An alternate symbol of this mystery. based on the Hindu pat- tern of the God and his Shakti. is commonly encountered in the iconography of Tibet: Vajradhara with a female counterpart in close embrace. (Figure 35.) This is a formula known in Tibetan as \"Yah. Yum.\" The two figures, merging into each other in su- preme concentration and absorption. are seated on the lotus throne in a commanding attitude of imperishable calm. Both wear the jeweled attire and the tiaras of crowned Bodhisattvas. Scarcely could the ultimate'identity of Eternity and Time.

The central head is the face of Eternity. Insisting on nothing whatsoever, it contains, blended in transcendental harmony, all the powers of the paired existences to either side. Out of its solid silence, time and the life-processes are continuously flowing-or apparently are flowing: from the viewpoint of the Middle, there is nothing flowing. In the august presence of the face of eternity the two expressive relief-profiles become cloud-like. Th!!ir drama on the stage of space and time becomes an effect as insubstantial as a play of light and shade. Perpetually asserting themselves to right and to left-yet wholly disregarded by the very essence from which they ceaselessly proceed-they are the producers and di- rectors of the world spectacle, self-multiplying into an infinite number of actors.

Maya-Shakti-Devi. ,. The Dance of Shiva SHIVA, the lord of the lingam, the cons on of Shakti-Devi, also is Natarija, \"King of Dancers.\" Dancing is an ancient form of magic. The dancer becomes am- plified into a being endowed with supra-normal powers. His personality is transformed. Like yoga, the dance induces trance, ecstasy, the experience of the divine. the realization of one's own secret nature, and, finally, mergence into the divine essence. In India consequently the dance has flourished side by side with the terrific austerities of the meditation grove-fasting, breathing ex- ercises, absolute introversion. To work magic, to put enchant- ments upon others, one has first to put enchantments on one- self. And this is effected as well by the dance as by prayer, fasting and meditation. Shiva, therefore, the arch-yogi of the gods, is nec- essarily also the master of the dance. Pantomimic dance is intended to transmute the dancer into whatever demon, god, or eanhly existence he impersonates. The war dance, for example, converts the men who execute it into"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"warriors; it arouses their warlike virtues and turns them into fearless heroes. And the hunting-party dance-pantomime, which magically anticipates and assures the successes of the hunting party, makes of the participants unerring huntsmen. To sum- mon from dormancy the nature-powers attendant upon fruitful- ness, dancers mimic the gods of vegetation, sexuality, and rain. The dance is an act of creation. It brings about a new situation and summons into the dancer a new and higher personality. It has a cosmogonic function, in that it arouses dormant energies which then may shape the world. On a universal scale, Shiva is the Cosmic Dancer; in his \"Dancing Manifestation\" (nritya- murti) he embodies in himself and simultaneously gives mani- festation to Eternal Energy. The forces gathered and projected in his frantic, ever-enduring gyration, are the powers of the evo- lution, maintenance, and dissolution of the world. Nature and all its creatures are the effects of his eternal dance. Shiva-Nataraja is represented in a beautiful series of South Indian bronzes dating from the tenth and twelfth centuries A.D. (Figure 38.) The details of these figures are to be read, accord- ing to the Hindu tradition, in terms of a complex pictorial al- legory. The upper right hand, it will be observed, carries a little drum, shaped like an hour-glass, for the beating of the rhythm. This connotes Sound, the vehicle of speech, the conveyer of revelation, tradition, incantation, magic. and divine truth. Fur- thermore, Sound is associated in India with Ether, the first of the five elements. Ether is the primary and most subtly pervasive manifestation of the divine Substance. Out of it unfold, in the evolution of the universe, all the other elements, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. Together, therefore, Sound and Ether signify the first, truth-pregnant moment of creation, the productive energy of the Absolute, in its pristine, cosmogenetic strength. The opposite hand, the upper left, with a half-moon posture of the fingers (ardhacandra-mudra), bears on its palm a tongue of flame. Fire is the element of the destruction of the world. At 151"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"the close of the Kali Yuga, Fire will annihilate the body of ae- adon, to be itself then quenched by the ocean of the void. Here, then, in the balance of the hands, is illustrated a counterpoise of creation and destruction in the play of the cosmic dance. As a ruthlessness of opposites, the Transcendental shows through the mask of the enigmatic Master: ceaselessness of production against an insatiate appetite of extermination, Sound against Flame. And the field of the terrible interplay is the Dancing Ground of the Universe, brilliant and horrific with the dance of the god. The \"fear not\" gesture (abhaya-mudra), bestowing protection and peace, is displayed by the second right hand, while the re- maining left lifted across the chest, points downward to the up- lifted left foot. This foot signifies Release and is the refuge and salvation of the devotee. It is to be worshiped for the attainment of union with the Absolute. The hand pointing to it is held in a pose imitative of the outstretched trunk or \"hand\" of the ele- phant (gaja-hasta-mudra), reminding us of Ganesha, Shiva's son, the Remover of Obstacles. The divinity is represented as dancing on the prostrate body of a dwarfish demon. This is Apasmara Purusha, \"The Man or Demon (purula) called Forgetfulness, or Heedlessness (apas- mara).\" • It is symbolical of life's blindness, man's ignorance. Conquest of this demon lies in the attainment of true wisdom. Therein is release from the bondages of the world. A ring of flames and light (prabhii.-mat;u!.ala) issues from and encompasses the god. This is said to signify the vital processes of the universe and its creatures, nature's dance as moved by the dancing god within. Simultaneously it is said to signify the energy of Wisdom, the transcendental light of the knowledge of truth, dancing forth from the personification of the All.

All five activities are made manifest, simultaneously with the pulse of every moment, and in sequence through the changes of time. Now, in the Shiva-Trinity of Elephanta we saw that the two expressive profiles, representing the polarity of the creative force, were counterposed to a single, silent, central head, signifying the quiescence of the Absolute. And we deciphered this sym- bolic relationship as eloquent of the paradox of Eternity and Time: the reposeful ocean and the racing stream are not finally distinct; the indestructible Self and the mortal being are in essence the same. This wonderful lesson can be read also in the figure of Shiva-Nataraja, where the incessant, triumphant mo- tion of the swaying limbs is in significant contrast to the bal- ance of the head and immobility of the mask-like countenance. Shiva is Kala, \"The Black One,\" \"Time\"; but he is also Maha Kala, \"Great Time,\" \"Eternity.\" As Nataraja, King of Dancers, his gestures, wild and full of grace, precipitate the cosmic illu- sion; his flying arms and legs and the swaying of his torso produce -indeed, they are-the continuous creation-destruction of the universe, death exactly balancing birth, annihilation the end of every coming-forth. The choreography is the whirligig of time. History and its ruins, the explosion of suns, are flashes from the tireless swinging sequence of the gestures. In the medieval bronze figurines, not merely a single phase or movement, but the entirety of this cosmic dance is miraculously rendered. The cyclic rhythm, flowing on and on in the unstayable, irreversible round of the Mahayugas, or Great Eons, is marked by the beating and stamping of the Master's heels.

A tension exists between the marvel of the dance and the serene tranquillity of this ex- pressively inexpressive countenance, the tension, that is to say, of Eternity and Time, the paradox-the silent, mutual confuta- tion-of the Absolute and the Phenomenal, the Self-Immortal and the perishable Psyche, Brahman-A.tman and Maya. For neither one is the entirety it would seem, whereas, on the other hand, the two, invisible and visible, are quintessentially the same. Man with all the fibers of his native personality clings to the duality, in anxiety and delight; nevertheless, actually and finally, there is no duality. Ignorance, passion, egotism, disin- tegrate the experience of the highest Essence (crystal clear and beyond time and change, free from suffering and bondage) into the universal illusion of a world of individual existences. This world, for all its fluidity, however, is-and it never will end. The bronze, dancing figures of southern India insist on the paradoxical identity of the personality, carried away by experi- ences and emotions, with the quiet. aU-knowing Self. In these figures the contrast of the blissfully dreaming, silent countenance with the passionate agility of the limbs represents, to those ready to understand, the Absolute and its Maya as a single trans-dual fonn.

The first deed of the Buddha-in-the-making, after his depar- ture from within the pale, is depicted in two eleventh century images of the great Ananda Temple of the Burmese city of Pagan. (Figures 44-5') He severed his long and beautiful hair with his princely blade.· In the earliest canonical Buddhist rec- ords, the Pali Canon, committed to writing in Ceylon during the first century B.C., the event is described in the following stately terms:t \"He thought, 'These locks of mine are not suited to a monk; but there is no one fit to cut the hair of a Future Buddha. There- fore I will cut them off myself with my sword.' And grasping a scimitar with his right hand, he seized his top-knot with his left hand, and cut it off, together with the diadem. His hair thus became two finger-breadths in length, and curling to the right, lay close to his head. As long as he lived it remained of that length, and the beard was proportionate. And never again did he have to cut either hair or beard. \"Then the Future Buddha seized hold of his top-knot and diadem, and threw them into the air, saying,- \" 'If I am to become a Buddha, let them stay in the sky; but if not, let them fall to the ground.' \"The top-knot and the jewelled turban mounted for a distance • [Like many other verbal or visual formulae, the Bodhisattva's tonsure has Brahmanical antecedents; \"They cut off the top-knot, for success, thinking 'More swiftly may we attain the world of heaven.'''

Below, meanwhile, are the heavenly damsels, the so-called Apsarases, dancers and singers of Indra's princely household, who are contributing their share to the festival by executing a ballet to musical accompaniment. These ever youthful, ever charming damsels form the seraglio of the inhabitants of Indra's paradise. They are the ever desir- able, ever willing mistresses of those blessed souls who are re- born into Indra's heavenly world as a reward for virtuous and devout conduct. Apsarases are the perfect dispensers of sensual delight and amorous bliss on a divine scale, and in sheer celes- tial harmony.

These very forces of Nature and Life acclaim the supreme sacrifice and conquest of the Future Buddha, though the Buddha's victory is to negate and annihilate their own very power and existence. They hallow his decisive step, his severing of the vegetation of his head, his decision to embark on that adventure of self-con- quest which in the end will invalidate, annihilate, simply ex- plode all the heavens and hell-pits together with their inhabi- tants, both alluring and terrible-revealing them all to be only so many projections, mirages, externalizations, of our own vege- tative, animalistic, emotional-intellectual propensities. In the early records we read that when the Future Buddha severed his hair, \"so sweet with many pleasant scents,\" it became \"two finger-breadths in length, and, curling to the right, lay close to the head.\" The cropped, curly locks remain to this day the canonical hairdress of the Buddha-image. In the classical Buddhist art of eighth century Java this formula was followed faithfully; the many sculptured representations of the eternal supramundane Buddhas that line the upper galleries and terraces of the gigantic mandala-structure of Borobodur bear witness to it. So also in the Mon-Khmer creations of Cambodia, this motif has been both steadfastly and skillfully employed. In the best works it is converted into an impressively simple, ornamental surface, abstract and anonymous. In the case, for example, of a certain mask-like Buddha portrait, which I once saw at an expo- sition in Paris, it forms a most inspiring frame. (Figure 48.) This is a piece, not much bigger than the palm of the hand, completely corroded by time, soil and rain, brittle and thin as an autumn leaf. It is one of the most knowing and solemn masks of a Buddha -breathtaking in its silence and composure.

The fragil- ity of all transitory beings and things, which itself is the root of suffering, has penetrated and transfigured this indescribable face and nearly destroyed it. Still, it is there-this brittle foil- even enhanced by the added frailty: with the sublime indiffer- ence and composure of its features it wipes away the powers of suffering and decay. The relentless processes of time, here execut- ing their sentence of destruction, the doom of that lamentable Samsara from which the Wisdom of the Buddha brings redemp- tion, have collaborated with the inspiration of an unknown artist to put the finishing touch to this precious document of the human spirit. Another Buddha head from Cambodia is shown in Figure 50. It is of a portrait-like intimacy. Yet there is about it a sublime, ethereal melodiousness, a subdued musicality, which is effected by its eloquent absence of striking detail. And particularly from the treatment of the skull and hair, this softly ringing silence proceeds. I remember that when I saw for the first time this mag- nificent symbol of the essence of Buddhism amongst a collection of Cambodian masterpieces assembled in Paris at the Musee Guimet, I was struck by it as by something quite singular. It is said that when the Future Buddha was born, the brahminical soothsayers, reading the physiognomy of the newborn child, foretold for him conquest of the world, and declared that his dominion would be either as Universal Monarch (cakravartin) or as Universal Savior (tathiigata). This is that fateful physiog- nomy. This is the mask of him who declined all the kingdoms of the world. And while I was looking at these features with this idea in mind, my thoughts flew from the Musee Guimet on the Place lena (which is named after Napoleon's decisive victory over Prussia, 1806), across the Seine, to the tomb of Napoleon, the Dome of the Invalides; and before my vision was another mask, the profile of that other Conqueror, the Buddha. In such 16 5"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"heads the symbolic and significant mark of asceticism is converted into a symbol of supreme spirituality. The ascetic hostility to the hair of the human organism is so excessive in the extreme sect of the jains that they will tolerate no hair whatsoever on the person of an ordained holy-man. Pan of their ritual of ordination consists in a thorough weeding out of every single hair growing on the head and body. Here the idea of the tonsure is, so to say, carried to its limit; and corre- spondingly, the jaina idea of life-renunciation is drastic beyond bounds. In accordance with their archaic, fundamentalist, and thoroughgoing doctrine, the jains so schedule their disciplines of bodily mortification, that in old age these ideally culminate in death from an absolute fast. As with the hair so with the last vegetable-requirement of the flesh: the revolt against the prin- ciple of life is pressed to the end. But though the spiritual and even eardlly rewards of the ascetic attitude are high, Shiva does not shave or shear his hair, \"so sweet with many a pleasant scent.\" Refusing to take advantage of the symbolical and potent devices of self-curtailment and deprivation, the divine dancer and arch-yogi is forever the un- ·shorn male. The long tresses of his matted hair, usually piled up in a kind of pyramid, loosen during the triumphant, violent frenzy of his untiring dance, and expand, so as to form two wings, to right and to left, a kind of halo-broadcasting, as it were, on their magic waves, the exuberance and sanctity of vegetative life, the charm, the appeal, the solemn command, of the generative forces of procreating Miyi. Shiva's tresses are commonly represented as filled with little symbolic figures. Those that appear most frequently in his images are the following: (1) a diminutive figure of the goddess Ganges, whom he received on his head when she descended from heaven to earth,· (2) flowers of the datura (from which an intoxicating • Cf. p. 115. mFG."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"drink is prepared), (3) a skull, symbolic of death-the common crown-jewel or forehead-ornament both of Shiva and of the lesser divinities who constitute part of his retinue and realm (the Memento mor; of the Lord of Destruction), and (4) a crescent moon, called in Sanskrit siSu, \"the quickly swelling one, the eagerly growing one,\" but also, \"the newborn babe,\" which from week to week, clinging to the mother breasts, quickly grows, like the crescent moon . • Shiva is the personification of the Absolute, particularly in its dissolution of the universe. He is the embodiment of Super- Death. He is called Yamantaka, \"The Ender of the Tamer, He who conquers and exterminates Yama the God of Death, the Tamer.\" Shiva is Maha-Kala, Great Time, Eternity, the swal- lower of time, swallower of all the ages and cycles of ages. He reduces the phenomenal rhythm and whirlpool to nought, dis- solving all things, all beings, all divinities, in the crystal pure, motionless ocean of Eternity-from the viewpoint of which noth- ing whatsoever fundamentally comes to pass. But then again as Shishu, the babe, the crescent moon, Shiva is a sheer delight and the most auspicious thing to see, a promise of life and life- strength, gentle but irresistible. The moon, Shishu, is regarded as the cup of the fluid of life immortal, quickening the vegetable realm and whatsoever grows in the sub-lunar sphere, quickening also the immortals on high, so that they may be fit to perform their beneficent cosmic duties. Shiva as Shishu is this cup, this moon. Shiva is apparently, thus, two opposite things: archetypal ascetic, and archetypal dancer. On the one hand he is Total Tran- quillity-inward calm absorbed in itself, absorbed in the void of the Absolute, where all distinctions merge and dissolve, and all tensions are at rest. But on the other hand he is Total Activity -life's energy, frantic, aimless, and playful. These aspects are the dual manifestations of an absolutely non-dual, ultimate Real- ity.

It is extremely interesting to observe that among the few re- mains surviving to us from the Indus Civilization-coming down through a corridor of some six thousand years as echoes of a re- ligiosity antedating the arrival of the Vedic Aryans, an antique religiosity, old as the pyramids of the Nile-the two aspects of the God are already revealed. Figure 42 shows a little faience plaque from Mohenjo-Daro, on which is engraved a horned deity, seated like a yogi with his heels pressed close together, naked, having three faces, and with phallus erect. The personage wears many bracelets on his arms and a great fan-shaped headdress-per- haps the latter is the piled up, matted hair. He is seated on a lit- tle throne or altar, and is surrounded by two antelopes, an ele- phant, a tiger, a rhinoceros, and a buffalo. (The glyphs along the upper margin cannot be deciphered.) The figure resembles nothing so much as Shiva-Pashupati, \"The Lord of Beasts.\" - Shiva-Nataraja, meanwhile, is powerfully suggested by the sig- nificant torso depicted in Figure 41. This is from the Indus Val- ley city of Harappa. The head is lost; so are the arms; so are the knee, shank, and foot of the left leg. All of these extremities were wrought separately and then fixed to the trunk by means of plugs which have since disintegrated. But the holes into which they were inserted are clearly to be seen. Evidently, it was for the sake of convenience that the figure was not carved from a single block of stone, and this probability supplies a hint as to how the posture of the missing limbs is to be imagined. They cannot have clung closely to the body; perhaps, by virtue of the plugs, they were capable of swinging to and fro. (The children's toys of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa are equipped with such moving • Cf. discwaion by Sir John Marshall.

Particularly significant is the point at which the left shank was affixed to the thigh: it is above the knee. The position suggests that the foot cannot have rested on the ground; it must have hung uplifted, as though in a pos- ture of dance. In fact there is every reason to believe that this archaic torso represents a dancer, not very different in form from those of the much later Nataraja type.· The probability is that we have here a precious symptom of a continuity of tradition over a period of no less than four thousand years.

Tdtlt/.ava, the fierce, violent dance, fired by an explosive, sweeping energy, is a delirious outburst, precipitating havoc. On the other hand, lasya, the gentle, lyric dance, is full of sweetness and represents the emotions of tenderness and love. Shiva is the perfect master of the two. JShiva in his gentle aspect is Pashupati, \"The Herdsman, the Owner of Cattle, Lord of the Animals.\" All beasts (paSu) are of his flock, both the wild and the tame. Furthermore, the souls of all men are the \"cattle\" of this herdsman. Thus the tender sym- bol of the herdsman watching his flock, which is familiar to us in the figure of Christ, the Good Shepherd, as represented in early Christian art, - is familiar also to the Shiva-devotee. As a member of the shepherd's flock, the worshiper realizes his re- lationship to the benign aspect of the august god. In this way, the term paSu has come to denote \"a follower of Shiva, a Sou1.\" Specifically, paSu is a term signifying the un- initiated person, the general and lowermost grade of Shiva dev- otee. In a spiritual sense, such an uninitiated one is as dumb as a brute and must be goaded by the god. PaSu, then, represents the grade opposed to that higher one of spiritual evolution, vira, \"The Hero.\" As early as the sixth century B.C. the term vira had ceased to be used to denote the valorous knight of the feudal epic, the kingly warrior and hero of the battlefield and of the mythical combats with demons and monsters. The earlier usage is rep- resented by the heroes of the feudal warfare of the Mahdbhdrata and by Rima of the Rdmdyatla, conqueror of monsters and de- mons.

The vira has become the perfect yogi. a true spirit- ual Superman, a \"man-hero.\" no longer merely the human beast. The Tindava-dance. the violent, phrenetic effusion of divine energies, bears traits suggesting some cosmic war-dance, designed to arouse destructive energies and to work havoc on the foe; at the same time, it is the triumphant dance of the victor. There is a myth. instructive in this connection, that represents Shiva as the conqueror of a great demon who had assumed the shape of an elephant. The god, having forced his opponent to dance with him, continued until the victim fell down dead, then flayed him, donned the skin as a kind of mantle, and finally, wrapped in this blood-dripping trophy, executed a horrendous dance of victory. A late but magnificent image representing this warrior-triumph in celebration of the annihilation of the ele- phant-demon (gajiisura-sarhhara) is to be seen in the South In- dian, seventeenth century, Nataraja Temple of Perfir. (Figure 39.) This is a facile creation in an extremely sophisticated style. The god wears a garland of skulls, and a skull is in his diadem. The two uppermost hands stretch out the skin of the ele- phant. The next pair of hands bears a pair of weapons, the noose (pliSa) and the hook (ankuJa).

The lowermost paIr of hands holds a trident (trisula) and the almsbowl of the vagrant mendicant (bhikjiipiitra). In the countenance of the god is a dreamy yet deliberate, sly aloofness, as he enjoys the solemn, slow strides that are holding his delirious energy compressed. This Shiva dancing in the elephant skin is a \"terrific or wrath- ful apparition\" (ghora-murti) of the god. The divine dancer is encompassed by the skin of his prey, as by a gruesome halo. The ponderous head of the victim, with its large ears, dangles at the bottom; the tiny tail is visible at the top; the four feet hang down at the sides. In the interior, the god extends his eight arms, in his measured, slow, and sophisticated dance. The trident and the other symbolic weapons characteristic of the hero-ruler are carried together with the alms bowl of the ascetic, symbol of the god's supreme aloofness. In his agility he is lizard-like; serpent- like in his slimness and grace. This pattern represents a perfect, enigmatical blending of polar-opposites. In it we may sense the dionysiac ambiguity, the ominous smile, of the forces of life. Blood-dripping, gruesome, the flayed trophy-skin of the violated victim constitutes a sinister background. In a poem by Kalidasa· it is told that even the Goddess-Spouse who watched the combat and the subsequent dance of her beloved husband felt alarm at this terrible sight. It sent the shivers up and down her spine. Against the sinister background, however, there flash the divine, youthful limbs, agile, delicate, and graceful, moving with their measured solem- nity; and in these is the beautiful innocence of the first athletic powers of young manhood. Four of the nine \"moods\" or \"flavors\" (rasa) of the Hindu sys- tem of rhetoric-four at least-are blended in this representa- tion.

Here is a blending familiar to the Hindu mind, everywhere documented in Hindu art. It is understood as expressive of the Divine, which in its totality comprises all the goods and evils, beauties. and horrors, joys and agonies, of our phenomenal life. Another seventeenth century South Indian representation of Shiva dancing in the elephant skin appears in \"The Great Tem- ple\" of Madura. (Figure 40.) Here, however, the attitude has be- come frozen into a sullen solemnity. The delirious dance of the victorious god has lost its bewitching, demonic agility; instead we find a somewhat static repose of threatening aloofness and terrific grandeur. The god seems to be withdrawn and absorbed in his own solitary majesty. This heavy, comparatively lifeless style is nearer than the other to perennial, primitive, local han- dicraft. The weight of matter, the solidity of the stone, and a pious pedantry of detail here assert themselves. The subtle art of the earlier periods - which knew how to convert solid ma- terial into a fleeting mirage, a sublime phantasmagoria expres- sive of the subtle nature of the bodies of the divine apparitions, has here evanesced, and we find asserting itself again the solid tangible matter of the primitive idol and the primitive fetish.

The Face of Glory THERE was once a great titan king called Jalandhara. By virtue of extraordinary austerities he had accumulated to himself irre- sistible powers. Equipped with these, he had gone forth against the gods of all the created spheres. and, unseating them, had established his new order. His humiliating government was tyran- nical, wasteful, careless of the traditional laws of the universe, wicked and utterly selfish. In a tremendous and ultimate excess of pride, Jalandhara sent a messenger-demon to challenge and humble the High God himself, Shiva the creator. sustainer. and destroyer of the world. Now the messenger of Jalandhara was Rahu, a monster whose function is the eclipsing of the moon.· The moon-this gentle luminary of the night, streaming with the cool milk that refreshes the vegetable and animal worlds after their vital fluids have been extracted by the scorching sun of the day-is a representa- tive of the life-giving principle; the moon is the effulgent cup • [l'hls Is a very complex: subject.

The challenge brought by the mes- senger, Rahu, was that Shiva should give up his shining jewel of a bride, \"The Fairest Maiden of All the Worlds,\" and with- out further ado turn her over to the new master of existence, the titan tyrant, Jalandhara.

The moment Rahu tendered Jalandhara's demand that the Goddess should be delivered to him-the Shakti of the universe to become the tyrant's principal queen-Shiva countered the colossal challenge. From the spot between his two eyebrows- the spot called \"The Lotus of Command\" (iijfiii-cakra), where the center of enlightenment is located and the spiritual eye of the advanced seer is opened-the god let fly a terrific burst of power, which explosion immediately took the physical shape of a horrendous, lion-headed demon.

Rahu, the messenger, was adept, however, in the techniques of supernatural power-politics.

Some new victim has to be offered to assuage and stay the voraciousness of this new power-body at large in the reaches of the world. In the pres- ent instance, Shiva was equal to the occasion. Shiva suggested that the monster should feed on the flesh of its own feet and hands. Forthwith, to this incredible banquet that incredible in- carnation of blind voraciousness proceeded. Ravished by its con- genital hunger, it ate and ate. And having devoured not only its feet and hands, but its arms and legs as well, it was still unable to stop. The teeth went on through its own belly and chest and neck, until only the face remained. Embodied in that monster was the wrath of the Supreme Being, the destructive power of the Universal God, who, under the form of Shiva-Rudra (rudra, \"The Howler, The Roarer\"; this was the Vedic name of Shiva, and refers to his world-annihi- lating aspect), periodically annihilates the created universe, the wrath and hunger of the cosmic fire that, at the world's end, re- duces everything to ash and then itself is quenched by torren- tial rain.

Presently, then, the \"Face\" began to be used indiscriminately on various parts of Hindu shrines as an auspicious device to ward off evil; it is incorporated generally into decorative friezes. Kirttimukha appears also in Shiva's crown of matted hair-presumably in ac- cordance with another version of the story, where the monster was rewarded by being inserted into Shiva's locks. In this posi- tion it developed into an ornamental finial for the upper decora- tion of images, and came thence to figure at the summit of the aureole (prabhO.-ma7;,uj,ala) the so-called \"Gate of Splendor\" (prabhO.-torat;la), at the back of images. With repetition, Kirt- timukha became conventionalized and presently was combined with a pair of sea monsters (makara) that commonly serve the same function as himself. Like the Gorgon head in the tradition of the Greeks (but, as we have seen, with a totally different back- ground of legend), Kirttimukha serves primarily as an apotro- paic demon-mask, a gruesome, awe-inspiring guardian of the threshold.

As usual, they were led by an austere and crafty tyrant, who, like J alandhara, had acquired special power by dint of years of fierce self-discipline.

The titan was a colossal monster named Mahisha, in the shape of a prodigious water-buffalo bull. The gods, under the leadership of Brahma, had taken refuge in Vishnu and Shiva. They had described the case of the vic- torious demon and implored the assistance of the twofold All- Highest. Vishnu and Shiva swelled with wrath. The other divini- ties also, swelling with the power of their indignation, stood about. And immediately, their intense powers poured forth in fire from their mouths. Vishnu, Shiva, and all the gods sent forth their energies, each according to his nature, in the form of sheets and streams of flame. These fires all rushed together, combin- ing in a flaming cloud which grew and grew, and meanwhile gradually condensed. Eventually it assumed the shape of the Goddess.

Pausing a moment, in full wrath, she lifted to her lips, serenely, a bowl filled with the inebriating, invigorating, liquor of the divine life-force, and while she sipped the matchless drink, her eyes turned red. The buffalo-demon, uprooting mountains with his horns, was fling- ing them against her, shouting defiantly at her the while, but with her arrows she was shattering them to dust. She called out 19i:."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"to the shouting monster: \"Shout onl Go on shouting one moment more, you fool, while I sip my fill of this delicious brew. The gods soon will be crying out for joy, and you shall lie murdered at my feet.\" Even while she spoke, the Goddess leapt into the air, and from above came down on the demon's neck. She dashed him to the earth and sent the trident through his neck. The adversary attempted once again to abandon the buffalo-body, issuing from its mouth in the shape of a hero with a sword; but he had only half emerged when he was caught. He was half inside the buffalo and half outside, when the Goddess, with a swift and terrific stroke, beheaded him, and he died. This lively series of transformations is an excellent example of the mythological trait of externalization or projection. The buf- falo-demon, employing his Maya-power, projects his vital energy into new forms. His aggressiveness, his ambition, his will to vic- tory, relinquish shape after shape, in order to survive. The char- acter of the projections derives from the nature of the energy in play. Shiva's wrath assumed the form of Kirttimukha. The wrath of the company of the gods produced the invincible goddess of the many arms. So now, the supranormal energies of the world- tyrant, gathered through years of inhuman austerity and self- mastery, powerful enough to unseat the gods and bring the uni- verse to heel, break swiftly and cleverly into form after form. Vital energy of body and soul, when aroused, flows forth, be- comes externalized, in shapes wrathful or beneficent, demonic or divine, depending upon the nature of the occasion. The bat- tleground of the universe is filled by the gods with such tempo- rary externalizations or projections. Furthermore, the universe itself is at most but such a transformation-a transformation or externalization of the Absolute. In the myths celebrating Shiva, Shakti is the materialization of the vital power of her spouse. According to the Vishnu formula, the Goddess is the anthropomorphic counterpart of the cosmic golden lotus: Vishnu 195"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"puts forth the lotus-calix and thus begins the evolution, the un- folding of the spheres of the world-these to become peopled, presently, with creatures, who in tum are but energy-transforma- tions. Vishnu, recumbent, by sending space forth from himself and then filling it with the process of the universe, simply projects the powers that he has been harboring in his belly. The world- process is the materialization of Vishnu's dream. The lesson may be read psychologically, as applying to our- selves, who are not gods but limited beings. The constant projec- tion and extemalization of our specific shakti (vital energy) is our \"little universe,\" our restricted sphere and immediate en- vironment, whatever concerns and affects us. We people and color the indifferent, neutral screen with the movie-figures and dramas of the inward dream of our soul, and fall prey then to its dramatic events, delights, and calamities. The world, not as it is in itself but as we perceive it and react upon it, is the prod- uct of our own Maya or delusion. It can be described as our own more or less blind life-energy, producing and projecting demonic and beneficent shapes and appearances. Thus we are the captives of our own Maya-Shakti and of the motion picture that it incessantly produces. Whenever we are entangled and en- meshed in vital, passionate issues, we are dealing with the projec- tions of our own substance. That is the spell of Maya. That is the spell of creative, life-engendering, life-maintaining energy. That is the spell of nescience, \"not knowing better.\" In so far as this is true, the shapes and figures projected by the angered and embattled Hindu gods represent a very reveal- ing psychological insight, in fact they amount to a philosophy and a metaphysic. The Highest Being is the lord and master of Maya. All the rest of us-the lower gods, the demons, human beings-are the victims of our own individual Maya. We fall prey to the spell of our own vitality as it infects us with its blind- ness, passion, and obsessions. Its processes in our psyche are au· tonomous, beyond our control; our reactions to them are com- 194"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"pelled. Our state is, thus, one of serfdom and bondage to the life-supporting, life-rwhing spell of Maya-Shakti. Were this not the case, we should not be individuals at all; we should have no history, no biography. The very essence of our personal life is our life-illusion. Indra was prompted by his personal Maya to believe in his own magnificence, and felt compelled to build his lordly resi- dence on a plan ever increasing in dimensions. To liberate man from such a spell, the thralldom of his own inherent shakti, the Maya of the purposes and pursuits of his existence, the glow- ing tints of desirability and fearsomeness, terror and delight, that color for him the objects of his environment, is the principal aim of all the great Indian philosophies. In contradistinction to the modem philosophies of the West, which are purely intellectual pursuits, clarifying, labeling, describing, and systematizing the contents of human thought, Indian wisdom, based as it is on the thought-transcending experiences of yoga, aims at a total trans- mutation of human nature and at an altogether new awareness both of oneself and of the world. Indian thought aims to re- lease men from the spellbound acceptance of the projections and externalizations of their own shakti-the productions of their own Maya, their own subjective, phenomenal, emotional \"reality.\" What it seeks is to change the serf of Maya into a lord of Maya, comparable to the Highest Being, to God personified either in Vishnu or in Shiva. Indian philosophy seeks seriously -and with a will to results-to make men divine through yoga and enlightenment; divine, even above those divinities who. like Indra. remain tented under the net of their own Maya. Indian symbols of art voice the same truth as Indian philos- ophy and myth. They are signals along the way of the same pil- grim's progress, directing human energies to the same goal of transmutation. Our task. therefore. as students of Indian myth and symbol, is to understand the abstract conceptions of India's philosophical doctrines as a kind of intellectual commentary on 195"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"what stands crystallized and unfolded in the figures and patterns of symbolism and art, and, conversely, to read the symbols aa the pictorial script of India's ultimately changeless wisdom. For example, in such a case as that of Figure 58 we must strive to grasp the sense of the peculiar attitude of the Goddess while she slays the buffalo-demon. This is perhaps the most magnificent of the representations of Durga Mahishasura-mirdini. It is a work of classical Javanese art. The classical art of Java of the eighth century A.D. and the centuries following, stems from southern India. Its seeds were planted by immigrants sailing from the Malabar shore. Not only for Javanese art, but also for the early Khmer art of Cambodia, the example is set by the Pallava style of India proper, and the finest of the colonial masterpieces match the achievements of the motherland. Furthermore, the peculiar tendencies of Pallava art are continued in the aims and style of the classical Hindu art of Java. Elements of violence and cruelty are avoided, mitigated, keyed down; the dramatic, climac- tic element is sublimated into a serene grandeur; sensuality is subtilized into a spiritual charm and gracefulness. The bulky body of such a demon as the fierce buffalo-adversary here shows nothing of threatening fierceness; it is subdued to an almost friendly appearance. The titan is so reduced that he becomes a fine farm-specimen of the docile, phlegmatic, ruminant, bovine species. And the desperate demon-hero who emerges for a last stand from the bull-shape, exhibits, with his elaborate hair-do, a grotesquely feminine loveliness. He is wholly resigned to his doom at the hands of the Goddess. She haa caught the demon by the hair and is about to deal the death-blow, the heroic stroke that is to save the world. But in the features of the great victress there is no trace of wrath- ful emotion; she is steeped in the serenity of eternal calm. Though the deed in time and space is bound to be accomplished, the expression on the countenance of the Goddess minimizes, indeed annihilates, its importance. For her the whole course of 19 6"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"this universe, including her own apparition in the role of itJ rescuer, is but part of a cosmic dream.

Fundamentally and consciously this presence remains totally unconcerned with her own triumphant manifestation. Her splendid countenance, vigorous and graceful, dreamy and far away, is comparable in this respect to the enigmatic mask of the dancing Shiva. 2. The Island of Jewels SHIVA and Devi, Shiva and his consort with the many names- Kali, DUrgi, Pirvati, Chandi, Chimundi, Umi, Sati, etc.-are re- garded as the primeval twofold-personalization of the Absolute. They are the first and primal unfolding of the neuter Brahman into the opposites of the male and the female principles. The literary religious tradition of the Tantra represents an unend- ing dialogue between these two, each alternately teaching and asking questions of the other. Through this dialogue the secret essence of the Brahman is made known to human understand- ing, and instruction is given in the means for approaching it by ritual and yoga-ritual remaining within and yoga going beyond the natural, inborn limitations of the individualized human con- sciousness as beclouded by the shakti of Miyi. There are many representations of the sacred union of the Two-in-One. We have already discussed Figure 34.

The perfect serenity and timeless harmony of the couple is emphasized in this relief by their re- sponse to an attempt of a demon to shake their Olympus from below. The villain of this piece is Rivana, who in the RamaytJf}tJ appears as the antagonist of Rima; as a great foe of the godly powers, he has been imprisoned in the netherworld and is held down by the towering weight of Shiva's mountain. Here he is shown suddenly trying to break free. He is shaking the moun- tain and the quivering has been felt. The goddess in a grace- ful, semi-recumbent posture, turns to Shiva, as if in a sudden access of fear, and grasps his arm. But the great god remains unmoved and by calmly pressing down his foot holds all secure. In spite of Pirvati's lively gesture of anxiety, an atmosphere of safety prevails, not to be disturbed by the world-shaking demon who rocks the universe with his twenty arms. As evidence of the character of the divine couple we have here not the dramatic triumph of the godly principle through a hero-manifestation in one of the vivid, ever-recurrent battles of the cosmogonic round, but an undramatic, almost anti-dramatic, vision of their unconquerable grandeur. They are beyond every earthly assault -beyond even the superhuman-demonic-absolutely secure. This is an eighth century work from the Kailasanitha Temple at Ehiri. In the eighteenth century miniature reproduced in Figure 61 Shiva and Pirvati are again in their solitary resort: this time we see a honeymoon-idyll. Nindi, the milk-white bull, Shiva's ani- mal representation and vehicle, is in the foreground. Shiva's staff with the trident is in the background. The god is girded with the typical loin-cloth of the brahmin-ascetic, a black antelope- skin, and wears in his matted hair the crescent; serpents take the place of bracelets and the other usual ornaments. The couch of the lovers is a tiger-skin, the classic seat-cover of the yogi. Not only the opposition of the male and the female but also that of the ascetic and the perfect husband-lover we discover here Ig8"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"transcended. All polarities whatsoever stem from the supernal non-dual duality of this timeless, world-central scene of bliss. Kailua is the mountain of the hean, wherein the fire of life, the energy of the creator, is quick with the ardor of its eternal source and at the same instant throbbing with the pulse of time. Here God and Creature are consubstantial, Eternity and Life one and the same. This is the mountain-the cave-the bed-of rapture, cosmogonic rapture, the world and all its myriads proceeding &om the re-conjuncture of the One who was never Two. The tender atmosphere of this perfect love-idyll is typical of the Hindu God-and-Consort scenes. Shiva and Devi as the primeval pair in close embrace have set the model for countless similar couples. Also we find that from Shiva and Devi was derived the general pattern for the representation of gods and their shaktis in the schools of Shivaite Buddhism and in the Lamaism of Tibet. Shiva and the Goddess represent the polar aspects of the one essence and therefore cannot be at variance; she expresses his secret nature and unfolds his character. A startling expres- sion of this idea appears in a late Cambodian development of the Shivaite tradition, where the symbol of the lingam opens up at the four sides and discloses, among other figures representa- tive of its power, the Goddess herself. Figure 64 is a good exam- ple; here the Goddess has ten arms and five heads, the latter feature being symbolical of Shiva's universal supremacy, since the five heads immediately place him above the four-headed Brahma. This female figure is the essence, the creative energy, the shakti, of the phallic pillar. It is possible that this late development may have been in- spired by a parallel evolution of the highest Buddhist symbol, the stupa. For centuries Buddhism and Hinduism flourished and developed side by side, submitting to identical influences, cross-influencing each other, and bringing to expression in their diverse systems of iconography identical ideas. The stupa is a very different thing from the lingam. It is a relic-shrine, often 199"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"containing a bone of the Buddha, and symbolizing him who haa attained to extinction through enlightenment. An austere, com- pletely anonymous structure crowned by the parasol of univer- sal spiritual emperorship, it is representative of the state of Nir- vana, which is beyond all concepts and forms. Figure 62 shows a chaitya hall, or Buddhist church, at Bedsi, dating from about 175 B.C. This monument is carved into the living rock. It is pat- terned after wooden structures of the practically undocumented earlier centuries, and consists of a great nave, flanked by aisles and terminating in an apse. The aisles are separated from the nave by pillars (not constructed, but carved from the body of the rock) and are continued round the apse, where they come together. In place of an altar we behold a simple stiipa, austere, severe and serene, magnificent and forbidding. The hall itself is devoid of ornamentation. Here the puritanical severity of the earliest Buddhist regimen is reflected tellingly; the intensity of the concentration on the ideal and experience of Nirvana renders superfluous, distracting, uninteresting, every suggestion of the play of the worlds of form. Contrast with this the richness of the stiipas of the later periods. Figure 65 shows an early sev- enth century structure at Ajanti. The negative, forbidding shell of Nirvana, beyond human conception, beyond all earthly and celestial forms, now discloses its positive kernel-the apparition of the Enlightened One, the transcendent Savior, who is the em- bodied and personalized substance of the Absolute. Sheer Such- ness, That-ness, beyond limiting, qualifying attributes and char- acteristics, has become reflected in Him who became one with it while yet remaining in the flesh. And even aa the apparition of Devi out of the extreme symbol of maleness, the lingam. brought with it a shock of new realization (namely, that the God and Goddess, the Absolute and its reflection in Phenomenal Nature, are ultimately one), so in this stiipa the abrupt burst- ing of an anthropomorphic Buddha out of Nirvana, the anony- mous void, lets it be known that in the light of final enlighten- 100"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"ment, in the thought-transcending experience of the \"Wisdom of the Farther Bank\" (prajiia-paramita), the ultimate polarity- that of Nirvana and Samsira, Freedom and Bondage-is totally annihilated: N irvanic serenity and the wild play of the worlds of form are one and the same. Clearly, this is a Buddhistic parallel to the Shivaite realization. Very likely a considerable interaction took place during the centuries of the neighborly common devel- opment of the two systems in the rich spiritual soil of medieval India. There is much to be said for the later symbols, ornate and ambiguous though they may appear to those whose taste has been developed in a sterner tradition. Depths and abundances of meaning and implication come to light through them, as though through a breaking and decay of surfaces. We stand aston- ished before apparitions emerging from profundities hitherto forbidden to the mind. And a vast reconciliation of the senti- ments and powers of judgment with everything that may have hitherto seemed either abominable or absurd unstrings the last resistance of the living ego to the all-inclusive, all-affirmative, all-annihilating death-and-life womb of final peace. Shiva symbolism delves deeper into the mystery of the Two- in-One than any other Hindu tradition of Shakti worship. That is what makes it particularly interesting and illuminating. The motif of the union of opposites here is orchestrated with pierc- ing harmonies. To grasp fully the implications, however, we cannot simply trust our own resources; we have to study a very recondite Shivaite-Tantric tradition, which is represented in certain miniatures and their corresponding literary texts. Fig- ure 66 is a representation of the so-called \"Island of Jewels\" (mat;li-dvipa). It is rich with allegorical meaning in every detail. It reveals the pair of opposites, in union with each other, grow- ing out of each other, supporting and counter-balancing each other.

First, there are the deep-blue, tranquil waters of the ocean of life-substance. Their melody is voiced in the prelude of Wag- ner's Rheingold, and in the soothing passage of the next to last bars of the Giitterdammerung, where the waters engulf the uni- versal conflagration. This is the ocean of etemallife in its primal state. And just as in the Vishnu mythology the ocean, as repre- sented by the cosmic serpent and recumbent Vishnu, brings forth the lotus of the cosmos which floats upon its waves, so here, the vast sea of infinite life-energy, this ocean of nectar, this elixir of immortality (amrita-af\"Qava), discloses in its center a mystical isle. The ocean represents the \"Alogical Immense.\" It is an ex- panse, dormant in itself, and full of all potentialities. It contains the germs of all conflicting opposites, all the energies and fea- tures of all the pairs of co-operating antagonisms. And these energies concentrate and evolve here at the center, in the Island. Out of the dormant, quiescent state they move here to creation. The ocean, standing for universal consciousness, is comparable to the ubiquitous, subtle element of the ether (akasa), which con- stitutes, substantially, all space, and supplies the stage for all subsequent evolution and development. The Island, in contra- distinction to this surrounding fluid, is regarded as the meta- physical Point of Power. It is called \"The Drop\" (bindu) the first drop, which spreads, unfolds, expands, and becomes trans- muted into the tangible realm of our limited consciousness and the universe.

It is forested with blooming, fragrant 101"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"ttees, and in the center stands a palace made of the precious stone that grants all desires (cintama7;li), a kind of lapis phi- losophorum. Within the palace is a jeweled awning (mandapa), under which, on a jeweled and golden throne, is seated the Universal Mother (jagad-ambd, matar), \"The Fairest One of the Three Worlds or Towns\" (tripura-sunda\"). She is the deity, the energy of the Bindu, which in tum was the first, concentrated Drop of the dynamic force of universal divine substance. Out of the Goddess there come into being the three world-spheres of the heavens, the earth, and the space between. The Goddess is red in color, for here she is creative. Red is the active color. She is the primordial energy, planning and pro- ducing the evolution of the universe. She is called vimarla-saktij vimarla meaning \"deliberation, reasoning, planning\"; sakti, \"energy.\" The Goddess is our familiar Maya: ma is \"to measure out, to plan (after the manner of the carpenter and house- builder).\" She is the potentiality and maternal measure of the world. Regarded from the standpoint of the all-containing divine Essence, she is a mere \"This\"; she is indeed the first-born \"This\" emerging from indiscriminate, latent totality; the quintessence of \"This,\" the first, pure object-of-experience known to the su- preme, divine Self-experience, out of which she herself has emerged. What man, later on (as a late product and link in the chain of evolution), is to call \"matter,\" divine Consciousness first experienced as a mere \"This,\" or \"Other,\" which yet was identical with the Supreme Self. Gradually, by the operation of Maya, this \"This\" became experienced by Mind as separate from, and dif- ferent from, and outside of Itself; it was experienced as total \"otherness.\" This experience was identical with the creation of the world.

The two are antagonistic, yet equally valid aspects of the Absolute, which contains and reflects all and every- thing, and in which all distinctions and oppositions vanish and come to rest. The Absolute is both plenitude and voidness, everything and nought. It is the source and receptacle of every energy, but at the same time utter inertia, the slumber of all slumbers, deep and quiet. Sakala Shiva, the uppermost of the two, is in the state of ac- tualization because he is in bodily contact with his own univer- sal energy, the Shakti, the Goddess, the feminine active prin- ciple, the efficient and material cause of the universe, the Miya that evolves the differentiated elements and beings. Sakala Shiva bears on his head the crescent of the moon. This moon, this tiny sickle of the crescent, is here to be understood as sym- bolizing the first utterance of sound, that is to say, the first mani- festation of the element that is perceived through the quality of sound: ether, space, the most subtle and first-born of the five. As the primary element of sense-perception, associated with the pristine ether, this \"sound\" (nada) represents the State of Power. It is experienced by the yogi when he plunges deep into himself. It is made manifest in the heartbeat. And since the microcosm is finally identical with the macrocosm, when the yogi hears the Nada, this Sound of Power, he is listening to the heartbeat of the Absolute; this is the universal Life Power as made manifest within his own ephemeral frame. He is coming very near to the final experience of the Absolute itself. Every detail of the Island of Jewels is meant to be visualized, and to be understood as an aspect of the innermost recess of the heart. Sakala Shiva throbs with the resounding Sound of Power because he is in immediate contact with the active, creative, feminine principle. Since he is pure consciousness, spontaneous Self-Illumination (sva-prakasa), he is white. The Goddess above him, his own energy (sakti), helps him to display himself as the universe, which is both being and becoming. He is the immacu-"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"late spirituality of the Self, shining forth of itself; she is the former of forms. It is he who illuminates the forms that she has evolved. But now, beneath this Sakala Shiva lies another, Nishkala Shiva, his twin or double. The eyes are closed, and this figure is not so much radiant white as colorless. Ni~kala means \"with- out parts.\" When applied to a man, its meaning is \"worn out, decrepit, old.\" When applied to a woman, it means \"unable to bring forth children, sterile.\" As applied now to Shiva, it de- notes the Absolute in that state in which nothing comes to pass. Nishkala Shiva is the unchanging, sterile Absolute, devoid of every urge of energy towards procreation and cosmogonic trans· mutation. This is the Absolute as sublime lifelessness, primary and ultimate inertia, the supreme void; here nothing whatso- ever throbs or stirs. Nishkala Shiva is called \"the dead body, the corpse\" (lava). In Sanskrit there is a meaningful play implied in this juxtaposi- tion of the two names, Shava and Shiva. The pun is based on a peculiarity of the Sanskrit mode of writing, and when grasped supplies a very neat formulation of the sense of these three sym- bolic personages of the Island of Jewels. In the classical Devana- gari script, the basic signs represent consonants plus the vowel a. For example, II' = sa,,.. = va. To convert the a into an i, the element f is added: 'Br = li, fer = vi. Hence Shiva is written k and ShavaJPl\"; that is to say, if the sign f is omitted from the written name of Shiva, there is left the ScrIpt equivalent for Shava. Without this l' or i, Shiva is but a corpse, a Shava. Who or what, then, is this enlivening vowel-sign, or i, if not the God- dess, Shakti, the supreme representative of movement and life? The Absolute (brahman) regarded in and by itself, devoid of this activating, vitalizing energy, this sign of its procreative, cos- mogonic impulse (maya), is but a corpse. The German philos- opher, Hegel, in the closing, crowning paragraph of his great work, \"The Phenomenology of the Universal Spiritual Prin- ciple\" (Die Phaenomenologie des Geistes) refers to this same 106"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Ultimate as das leblose Einsame, \"the lifeless Solitary One.\" Shiva thus regarded as Shava, Brahman destitute of Maya, can do nothing (so far as Manifestation is concerned); he is nothing; he is the purest Nought. In the picture of the throne-hall of the Island of Jewels, Nish- kala Shiva is dissociated from the red energy of life, in contrast to Sakala Shiva, who is in bodily contact with the upper, feminine figure. It is because he is separated from her that he is Shiva without the i, Shava, a corpse. This point is emphasized in the picture and in its doctrine. The emphasis gives stress to the dig- nity and supreme virtue of the Goddess. She is the Maya that produces the world; she is the motller of our individual, swiftly transitory lives. The meaning is, that, though these lives of ours are caught in the whirligig of rebirth where everything fails of its end, and are fraught with sufferings and guilt, shortcomings, cruelties, and absurd infatuations, nevertheless they are the unique manifestation of divine energy. Through the processes of universal life, the divine has become phenomenal actuality. Whatever we may perceive or experience, and no matter how we may perceive it-whether brightly or darkly-everything, both ourselves and our world, is a revelation of the virtual infinity of divine energy. Hence: the supreme sanctity of Maya-whatever she may signify, or be. Distressed though we inevitably are, in all our deficiencies, we constitute, nevertheless, particles of the abundant display. We are emanations, children, of the Absolute: we are of its fold; we are in its lap; we cannot be lost. Individually we pass through all kinds of disaster, and suffer, in the end, destruction. Indi- vidually, at the same time, we are refractions of the Image of God. We have no need to go in quest of the Absolute in and by itself, the Absolute dormant in its first and ultimate inertia, lying prostrate like a corpse; for the very life essence, the Energy. of the Absolute is manifest in everything around us, it is every- where before our eyes, by virtue of the transforming power of"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"the Goddess.

The chil- dren of the world are in immediate contact with the divine, if they can only look upon and deal with everything as part and parcel of its everchanging-everlasting self-revelation. In symbols such as this one produced by the Shivaite Tantra philosophy, the old \"accursed Maya of somber and woeful appearance,\" as Vishnu himself styled her when letting Narada experience her spell, the Maya whose power is so difficult even for fervent and advanced saints to overcome, assumes a surprising aspect: she becomes suddenly the revelation, the very incarnation of the divine energy of the Absolute. Life with all its features and ex- periences, the universe in its decline and strife, though screen- ing the divine Self within us, is holy and divine. Just beneath the veil of Maya, the magic mirage of the universe, dwells the Absolute. And the energy of Maya is precisely the energy of that Absolute, under its dynamic aspect. Shakti, the Goddess, emerges from Nishkala Shiva, so that he may show forth the totality of his potentialities, as the moon its total orb. The three figures-Nishkala Shiva, Sakala Shiva, and Shakti- Miyi-superimposed as they are, one upon the other, can be read either upward or downward as, respectively, the evolution and the involution of the Absolute in its unfolding and reab- sorption of the universe. Nishkala Shiva is the Absolute, the divine essence in and by itself, beyond event and change, inac- tive, dormant, void. Sakala Shiva is the state in which the Abso- lute shows. its infinite potentiality for differentiation into the universe. Shakti-Miyi is the energy of the Absolute making it- self manifest, its static repose transmuted into procreative energy. Thus reading the picture from bottom to top, the Absolute evolves through three aspects or gradations, passing from the pole of inertia, complete inactivity and voidness, to that of in- finite activity and dynamic differentiation, the universe teeming log"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"with its creatures and abundant in its variety of forms. Reading from top to bottom, on the other hand, the three figures express in abbreviation the progress of the yogi-initiate from normal consciousness to the realization of the Self. They outline the way back from the experiences of the senses, the awareness of the intellect, first to the plenitude of supra-individual consciousness, the radiant and pure essence of Sakala Shiva, and then finally to a complete self-absorption in the utter Void, Nishkala Shiva, unconscious of itself in supreme quiet. The symbolic pattern is meant to guide the initiate in a process of introvert regression to the state beyond all attributes, limita- tions, and characterizations. This psychological process occurs in time and space. Time and space, however, are but categories of our individual, limited consciousness, the most elementary limi- tations or frames of our human perception and conception, they do not apply to the transcendent Absolute. What appears to the human mind of the adept yogi as a sequence or gradation of an- tagonistic states-proceeding from the Maya of normal individual consciousness (the Shakti at the top) to the experience of the highest Self (Shava beneath)-is not a sequence at all, from the standpoint of the Absolute. The three are only aspects of a single, unique and eternal essence. The truth is voidness and plenitude, everything and nought. Through concentrating on this truth, the initiate should ultimately come to realize the basic identity of the individual personality with the universal Self. What is mortal in himself and what is imperishable he should know to be one. What is changing and what is above change he should discover to be coincident. Thus he should learn at last to accept the Maya of his transient, frail existence as a dynamic radia- tion of the Self-Eternal.

But the energy of life is finally no less destructive than creative: so too the Goddess. Life feeds on lite. In the end, every creature be- comes food for another. The aging and dying generation is to be replaced by the younger, pressing on its heels. What the God- dess bestows benignantly upon the one, she has taken ruthlessly from the other. Studying the rich and meaningful symbol of this Mani-dvipa pattern, this Goddess of the Jewel Island, one might be tempted to say that there is something missing-at least, from the standpoint of the Absolute; for the Goddess in the Brahma-like, Vi marsha-aspect is all too benign, beneficent, and bright. She exhibits only the positive aspect of the Shakti-Maya life-force. \\Ve have now to see how the opposite side of the coin is represented in the fearless world of Indian myth and art. It might be said that the Goddess represents clearly enough by her feminine nature the life-bearing, life-nourishing, maternal principle; this, her positive aspect, hardly needs to be further em- phasized. But the counter-balancing, negative aspect, her ever- destructive function, which takes back and swallows again the creatures brought forth, requires a shock of vivid horror, if it is to be duly expressed. To this end she is represented as Kali, the Black One.

There is a celebrated hymn to Kali, the Goddess, composed by the famoU6 Shankaracharya, the great philosopher and divine who flourished about A.D. 800, the Thomas Aquinas of orthodox Vedantic non-dualism.

She holds in her right hand a golden ladle t adorned with rare jewels, and in her left the vessel of abundance, from which she deals to all her children in the universe sweet milk-rice, \"the best of all food\" (parama-anna). But now, in the very next stanza, Shankaracharya describes this Goddess according to her other aspect: with four hands that hold the symbols not of abundance but of death, renunciation, and the spiritual path of devotion. These are the noose (the lasso that catches and strangles the victim), the iron hook (which drags the victim to his doom), the rosary, and the textbook of prayer. Shankaracharya addresses her: \"Who art thou, 0 Fairest One! Auspicious One! You whose hands hold both: delight and pain? Both: the shade of death and the elixir of immortality, Are thy grace, 0 Mother!\" That is to say: the creative principle and the destructive are one and the same.

The hun- ger for life, which impels all ot us throughout the length of our days-makes the adorable suckling cry and seize upon its moth- er's nipples to drink her sweet milky heart blood-here shows it- self in its most loathsome transformation, hideous, and yet as spontaneous, \"natural\" and innocent as the tender infant's en- dearing gesture. The Goddess feeds upon the entrails of her victim. And who among beings born is not her victim? She cleaves the belly and draws out and gobbles the intestines-that is what she is fond of-steaming with the last breath of expiring life. And she is encompassed by the halo of flames, the aureole of the Dancing Shiva: these are the tongues of the universal con- flagration that reduces everything to ashes at the termination of a world-period (kalpa). But these tongues, furthermore, lick incessantly: for life feeds on life. With every newborn creature's entrance into the world, there is another turning back to clay. Just as the Creatrix is visualizes! as surrounded and supported by an ocean, so also this negative, annihilating aspect of the Mother Shakti.

The blood is the lifeblood of the world of children that she is bring- ing forth, sustaining, and eating back. She stands there and sips the intoxicating warm blood-drink from a cranial bowl that she lifts to her insatiable lips.

One of the most popular symbols of the perennial, loving union of the God and his Spouse is that of the Goddess, Kali, the Black One, adorned with the blood-dripping hands and heads of her victims, treading on the prostrate, corpse-like body of her Lord. (Figure 69.) The Goddess is the feminine partner of the Two-in-One, the faithful spouse, the ideal wife-consort of Hindu myth and civilization, yet she treads on the inanimate body of her beloved and only mate. She is black with death and her tongue is out to lick up the world; her teeth are hideous fangs. Her body is lithe and beautiful, and her breasts are big with milk. Paradoxical and gruesome, she is today the most cher- ished and widespread of the personalizations of Indian cult. To us of the West-brought up under the shadow of the Gothic Cathedral, where the benign figure of the Blessed Mother, im- maculate, is uncontaminated by the darker principle, the poison- brood of the serpent whose head she has come to crush, the hell- brood and the gargoyle-brood that swarms over the outer walls and up the spires-India's Mother, eternal India's horrific-beau- tiful, caressing-murdering symbolization of the totality of the worldcreating-destroying eating-eaten one, seems more than dif- ficult to love.

As for the general remark: It is well known that our Chris- tian Western tradition has long refused to accept the wisdom of the pagans on an equal footing with the body of revelation that it cherishes and worships as its own. The books that it ac- cepts as divinely inspired are the Four Gospels, penned by four members of the early Christian community, the pamphlets ad- dressed by St. Paul to certain small, ex-Jewish, heretical commu- nities in Salonika and Cappadocia, and in the oriental quarters of Rome and Corinth, a few minor letters to other communities composed by other apostles (as it were, mere typewritten or mimeographed sheets, quite inconspicuous and unknown at the time, yet destined to outlive and outshine all the marketable best-sellers of the period), and then together with these the cryp- tic, somewhat delirious Book of Revelation; added to this Chris- tian corpus are the very different tribal records of the legendary history of the Chosen People (including a biography of their jealous, wrathful God) as shaped and colored by Jewish leaders back from exile. These and only these have we deigned to ac- cept as the all-comprehensive source of guidance for the human soul. And yet, there has been a semi-liberal, timid, and guarded acknowledgment that in pagan tradition also there may be found 211"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"some light, the \"natural light,\" a kind of bedimmed reflex of the truth of revelation. The most enlightened, virtuous, and pious souls of Antiquity, even though pagan and deprived of both baptism and the Lord's gospel, are not inmates of the hell-pit proper. Dante, touring the circles of the underworld, encountered them in a sort of idyl- lie, Elysian lobby, near the entrance to, yet set quite apart from, the frightening inner apartments of the satanic Inferno. He rec- ognized in that outer circle Socrates and Plato, Democritus, Diogenes, Anaxagoras and Thales, Empedocles, Heraclitus, Zeno, Dioscorides, Orpheus, Cicero, Livy, Seneca, Euclid, Ptolemy, Hippocrates and Galen, together with the Muslim au- thorities on Hellenistic philosophy and science, Avicenna and Averroes, and then, along with these, Noah and Moses, Abra- ham, Abel, King David, Jacob and his sons, Rachel, and even the wise Muslim ruler, Saladin; furthermore, many heroic and pious figures of Greek mythology were there: Hector of Troy, Aeneas and Caesar, Penthesilea, Electra, Lucretia, and many others.- The fact that there are virtue, wisdom, and inspiration to be found even among the historical enemies of Christianity, the Jews who hung the Savior on the tree, the Romans who perse- cuted the martyrs, the Muslims who battled the Crusaders, was ever acknowledged by the broad-minded, orthodox doctrine of medieval Christianity, and is to this day upheld by the Roman Catholic Church-though it was rejected by certain Protestant denominations of narrow-minded, fanatical, Calvinistic extrac- tion. During the Renaissance, there was even a moment (repre- sented strikingly in the figure of Pico della Mirandola) when the last walls of orthodox exclusiveness seemed about to yield, and Ovid, Homer, the Kabbalah, the Koran, were being found to be in essential concord with the sacred pamphlets of the Chris- ·'nferno, Canto IV. 218"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"tian movement. Behind the variety of symbols, a universally con- stant, vastly sophisticated, tradition of human wisdom was joy- fully recognized, and was on the point, even, of being officially conceded by the guardians of the \"One True Faith.\" • There is a humorou~ Jewish parable in the tradition of the Hassidim (this is the text on which I wish to close) that brings into an eloquent image the final sense to the individual of a broad-minded, fearless adventure into the worlds of \"gentile\" faith and life. When I first read this tale,t some ten years ago, I realized that I had been living and acting along its lines for over a decade-ever since that moment when the millenary, spiritual, treasure of Hindu myth and symbol had begun to reveal itself to me through my academic studies of Indian sacred diagrams and Mandalas, in conjunction with research in the Tantras and Puranas. It is a brief story, told of the Rabbi Eisik, son of Rabbi Jekel, who lived in the ghetto of Cracow, the capital of Poland. He had remained unbroken in his faith, through years of afflic- tion, and was a pious servant of the Lord his God. • [Extra ecclesiam nulla salus is an admittedly difficult Christian doctrine. not to be taken au pied de la lettre.

I-II. 109. 1 and 1); accordingly. even St. Thomas could speak of the doctrines of the pagan philosophers as affording \"extrinsic and probable proofs\" of the truths of Christianity; and the same would apply to the teachings of Indian and Chinese metaphysicians of whom there was no knowledge in those days. All fundamental theOlogical propositions. the doc- trine. for example. of the \"single essence and two natures\" (respectively impassible and passible). after which also \"there are two in us\" (respectively immortal and mortal). are common to all orthodox traditions. \"All Saipture aies aloud for freedom from self.\" Religions (subject to the fallibility of human interpretation) necessarily differ in emphasis and modality. but the infallible truth of which all are expressions is one; and the time is coming when a Summa of the Philosophia Perennis (et Universalis). based on all orthodox sources whatever. not excluding those of \"folklore.\" will have to be written. Aldous Huxley's Philosophia Permnis represents a step in this direction; a step. that is to say. towards the \"reunion of the churches\" in a far wider sense than that in which this phrase is commonly taken.-AKC.] t Martin Buber.

The Rabbi was surprised, and put off his going. But the dream recurred twice again. After the third call, he bravely girded his loins and set forth on the quest. Arriving at the city of his destiny, Rabbi Eisik discovered sen- tries at the bridge, and these guarded it day and night; so that he did not venture to dig. He only returned every morning and loitered around until dusk, looking at the bridge, watching the sentries, st,:!gyjng.J~.~os!enta~iously the masonry and the soil. At length, the captain of the guards, struck by the old man's per- sistence, approached, and gently inquired whether he had lost something or perhaps was waiting for someone to arrive. Rabbi Eisik recounted, simply and confidently, the dream that he had had, and the officer stood back and laughed. \"Really, you poor fellow'\" the captain said; \"Have you worn your shoes out wandering all this way only because of a dream? What sensible person would trust a dream? Why look, if I had been one to go trusting dreams, I should this very minute be doing just the opposite. I should have made just such a pilgrimage as this silly one of yours, only in the opposite direction, but no doubt with the same result.

With a portion of the money he erected a prayer- house that bears his name to this day. Now the real treasure. to end our misery and trials. is never far away; it is not to be sought in any distant region; it lies buried in the innermost recess of our own home. that is to say. our own being. And it lies behind the stove. the life-and-warmth giving center of the structure of our existence. our heart of hearts-if we could only dig. But there is the odd and persistent fact that it is only after a faithful journey to a distant region. a foreign country. a strange land. that the meaning of the inner voice that is to guide our quest can be revealed to us. And together with this odd and persistent fact there goes another. namely. that the one who reveals to us the meaning of our cryptic inner mes- sage. must be a stranger. of another creed and a foreign race. The Bohemian captain at the bridge does not believe in inner voices or in dreams. yet he opens to the stranger from afar the very thing that terminates his troubles and brings to fulfillment his quest. Nor does he do this wonderful thing by intention; on the contrary. quite inadvertently his epochal message is delivered while he is making a special point of his own.
