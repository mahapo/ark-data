Thisself-contained anthology also serves as part of a television course based on aseries of lectures by Joseph Campbell, world-renowned scholar and mythologist.Joseph Campbell—author, scholar, teacher, and storyteller, inspiration to peopleof all walks of life the world over—firmly believed in the importance andrelevance of myths to our lives. He wrote: \"Religions, philosophies, arts, thesocial forms of primitive and historic man, prime discoveries in science andtechnology, the very dreams that blister sleep boil up from the basic magic ringof myth.\" His life's work was devoted to studying the various mythologies of theworld and learning how they reconcile human beings to the mysteries of life.A National Academic Advisory Committee of leading scholars has guided theselection of the readings for this anthology:Dr. Charles Briggs Dr. Joseph Epes BrownDepartment of Anthropology Department of Religious StudiesVassar University University of MontanaDr. Grace Burford Dr. Marcus CunliffeDepartment of Theology University ProfessorGeorgetown University George Washington UniversityDr. Wendy Doniger Dr. Marija GimbutasMircea Eliade Professor of the History Department of European Archaeologyof Religion University of California, Los Angeles University of ChicagoDr. James JacksonHumanities DepartmentJohnson County Community CollegeThe committee's goal was to create a collection of readings by Campbell andother scholars and writers with varying perspectives on mythology's role inhuman history, a collection to serve as an introduction to the study of theworld's mythologies.Transformations of Myth Through Time, the title of this anthology of readings,refers to the fundamental idea that all myths of humanity are expressions, inone way or another, of certain basic, perennial themes. These are themes whichJoseph Campbell believed were deeply embedded in the human psyche and whichnaturally found expression in the myths of each of the cultures createdthroughout our long history. Each culture transformed the basic patterns byembodying them in their own images, but the patterns remained, and still remain,the same.vi PrefaceThe selections in the Anthology of Readings explore the cultural manifestationsof these basic patterns. They also provide a general background to thesemythologies, including primal mythologies, the grounding principles and earlyexpressions of myth; American Indian myths; goddesses and gods; Egyptianmythology; Hinduism and Buddhism; Kundalini Yoga, an Eastern system ofmeditation; the Tibetan Book of the Dead; ancient Greece's mystery cult; thehistorical and mythological significance of the Quest for the Grail; and thefamous Arthurian Romances on love, marriage, and the individual.We hope that these readings will captivate you and serve as the beginning pointfor your study of myth and for your better understanding of yourself and yourculture.The EditorsEditors' AcknowledgmentsThe editors take full responsibility for selecting the excerpts that have beenincluded in the Anthology of Readings, but we wish to acknowledge the manypeople who helped us accomplish this task.

JUNG\"Confrontation with the Unconscious\" from Memories, Dreams, and Reflection 481IntroductionThe Hero's Journey: The World of Joseph Campbellpicture0 [images/picture0.jpg]The Inner Reaches of Outer Space:Myth as Metaphor and as ReligionJOSEPH CAMPBELLIn this selection, Joseph Campbell discusses the various influences on thedevelopment of his own thought such as the ideas ofFrobenius, Spengler, andBastian. He distinguishes between the universal and local aspects of worldmythologies, pointing out the universal compulsions from which myths have beengenerated. Campbell presents his concern that the old myths are dying, and thatnew mythologies are needed with new symbols and metaphors that will inject themythology with renewed vitality. The development of such a new mythology wouldillustrate how myth is transformed through time.Jtieviewing with unprejudiced eye the religious traditions of mankind, onebecomes very soon aware of certain mythic motifs that are common to all, thoughdifferently understood and developed in the differing traditions: ideas, forexample, of a life beyond death, or of malevolent and protective spirits. AdolfBastian (1826-1905), a medical man, world traveler, and leading ethnologist ofthe last century, for whom the chair in anthropology at the University of Berlinwas established, termed these recurrent themes and features \"elementary ideas,\"Elementargedanken, designating as \"ethnic\" or \"folk ideas,\" Vol-kergedanken, thediffering manners of their representation, interpretation, and application inthe arts and customs, mythologies and theologies, of the peoples of this singleplanet.Such a recognition of two aspects, a universal and a local, in the constitutionof religions everywhere clarifies at one stroke those controversies touchingeternal and temporal values, truth and falsehood, which forever engagetheologians; besides setting apart, as of two distinct yet related sciences,studies on the one hand of the differing \"ethnic\" or \"folk ideas,\" which are theconcern properly of historians and ethnologists, and on the other hand, of theElementargedanken, which pertain to psychology. A number of leadingpsychologists of the past century addressed themselves to the analysis of theseuniversals, of whom Carl G. Jung (1875-1961), it seems to me, was the mostinsightful and illuminating. The same mythic motifs that Bastian had termed\"elementary ideas,\" Jung called \"archetypes of the collective unconscious,\"transferring emphasis, thereby, from the mental sphere of rational ideation tothe obscure subliminal abysm out of which dreams arise.For myths and dreams, in this view, are motivated from a singlepsychophysiological source—namely, the human imagination moved by theconflicting urgencies of the organs (including the brain) of the human body, ofwhich the anatomy has remained pretty much the same since ca. 40,000 B.C.Accordingly,as the imagery of a dream is metaphorical of the psychology of its dreamer, thatof a mythology is metaphorical of the psychological posture of the people towhom it pertains. The sociological structure coordinate to such a posture wastermed by the Africanist Leo Frobenius (1873-1938) a cultural \"monad.\" Everyfeature of such a social organism is, in his sense, expressive and thereforesymbolic of the informing psychological posture. In The Decline of the West,Oswald Spengler (1880-1936) identified eight colossal monads of great majesty,with a ninth now in formation, as having shaped and dominated world historysince the rise, in the fourth millennium B.C., of the first literate highcultures—(1) the Sumero-Babylonian, (2) the Egyptian, (3) the Greco-Roman(Apollonian), (4) the Vedic-Aryan, of India, (5) the Chinese, (6) theMaya-Aztec/Incan, (7) the Magian (Persian-Arabian, Judeo-Christian-Islamic), (8)the Faustian (Gothic Christian to modern European-American), and now, beneaththe imposed alien crust of a Marxian cultural pseudomorphosis, (9) thegerminating Russian-Christian.Long antecedent, however, to the world-historical appearances, flowerings, andinevitable declines of these monumental monads, an all but timeless period isrecognized of nonliterate, aboriginal societies—some, nomadic hunters, others,settled horticulturalists; some of no more than a half dozen related families,others of tens of thousands. And each had its mythology—some, pitifullyfragmentary, but others, marvelously rich and magnificently composed. Thesemythologies were all conditioned, of course, by local geography and socialnecessities. Their images have been derived from the local landscapes, flora andfauna, from recollections of personages and events, shared visionaryexperiences, and so forth. Narrative themes and other mythic features,furthermore, have passed from one domain to another. However, the definition ofthe \"monad\" is not a function of the number and character of such influences anddetails, but of the psychological stance in relation to their universe of thepeople, whether great or small, of whom the monad is the cohering life. Thestudy of any mythology from the point of view of an ethnologist or historian,therefore, is of the relevance of its metaphors to a disclosure of the structureand force of the nucleating monad by which every feature of the culture isinvested with its spiritual sense. Out of this emerge the forms of its art, itstools, and its weapons, ritual forms, musical instruments, social regulations,and ways of relating in war and in peace to its neighbors.In terms of Bastian's vocabulary, these monads are local organizations of thenumber of \"ethnic\" or \"folk ideas\" of the represented cultures, constellatingvariously in relation to current needs and interests the primal energies andurges of the common human species: bioenergies that are of the essence of lifeitself, and which, when unbridled, become terrific, horrifying, and destructive.The first, most elementary and horrifying of all, is the innocent voraciousnessof life which feeds on lives and provides the first interest of the infantfeeding on its mother. The peace of sleep shatters in nightmare into apparitionsof the cannibal ogress, cannibal giant, or approaching crocodile, which arefeatures, also, of the fairy tale. In Dionysiac orgies the culminating frenziesissue still, in some parts of the world, in the merciless group-cannibalizing ofliving bulls. The most telling mythological image of this grim first premise oflife is to be seen inthe Hindu figure of the world-mother herself as Kali, \"Black Time,\" licking upwith her extended, long, red tongue the lives of all the living of this world ofher creation. For, as noticed in a paper on \"ritual killing\" by the latedirector, Adolf E. Jensen, of the Frobenius Institute in Frankfurt-am-Main, \"itis the common mark of all animal life that it can maintain itself only bydestroying life;\" citing to this point an Abyssinian song in celebration of thejoys of life: \"He who has not yet killed, shall kill. She who has not yet givenbirth, shall bear.\"The second primal compulsion, linked almost in identity with the first (asrecognized in this Abyssinian paean), is the sexual, generative urge, whichduring the years of passage out of infancy comes to knowledge with such urgencythat in its seasons it overleaps the claims even of the first. For here thespecies talks. The individual is surpassed. In the quiver of the Hindu god Kama,whose name means \"desire\" and \"longing,\" and who is a counterpart of Cupid—nochild, however, but a splendid youth, emitting a fragrance of blossoms, dark andmagnificent as an elephant stung with vehement desire—there are five floweredarrows to be sent flying from his flowery bow, and their names are \"Open Up!\"\"Exciter of the Paroxysm of Desire,\" \"The Inflamer,\" \"The Parcher,\" and \"TheCarrier of Death.\" Orgies of whole companies overtaken by the released zeal ofthe arrows of this god are reported from every quarter of the globe.A third motivation, which on the world stage of world history has been theunique generator of the action—since the period, at least, of Sargon I of Akkad,in southern Mesopotamia, ca. 2300 B.C.—is the apparently irresistible impulse toplunder. Psychologically, this might perhaps be read as an extension of thebioenergetic command to feed upon and consume; however, the motivation here isnot of any such primal biological urgency, but of an impulse launched from theeyes, not to consume, but to possess. An ample anthology of exemplary texts tothis purpose, readily at hand, will be found in the Bible; for example:When the Lord your God brings you into the land which you are entering to takepossession of it, and clears away many nations before you, the Hittites, theGirgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and theJebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than yourselves, and when the Lordyour God gives them over to you, and you defeat them; then you must utterlydestroy them; you shall make no covenant with them and show them no mercy. Youshall not make marriages with them, giving your daughters to their sons ortaking their daughters for your sons. For they would turn away your sons fromfollowing me, to serve other gods; then the anger of the Lord would be kindledagainst you, and he would destroy you utterly. But thus shall you deal withthem; you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, andhew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire. For you are apeople holy to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you to be apeople for his own possession, out of all the peoples that are on the face ofthe earth. (Deuteronomy 7:1-6)When you draw near to a city to fight against it, offer terms of peace to it.And if its answer to you is peace and it opens to you, then all the people whoare found in it shall do forced labor for you and shall serve you. But if itmakes no peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiegeit; and when the Lord your God gives it into your hand you shall put all itsmales to the sword, but the women and the little ones, the cattle, andeverything else in the city, all its spoil, you shall take as booty foryourselves; and you shall enjoy the spoil of your enemies, which the Lord yourGod has given you. Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far fromyou, which are not cities of the nations here. But in the cities of these peoplethat the Lord your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alivenothing that breathes, but you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittites and theAmorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, asthe Lord your God has commanded. (Deuteronomy 20:10-18) And when the Lord yourGod brings you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, toIsaac, and to Jacob, to give you, with great and goodly cities, which you didnot build, and houses full of all good things, which you did not fill, andcisterns hewn out, which you did not hew, and vineyards and olive trees, whichyou did not plant, and when you eat and are full, then take heed lest you forgetthe Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.(Deuteronomy 6:10-12)War gods of this kind, always tribal in their ranges both of mercy and of power,have abounded over the earth as the fomenting agents of world history. Indra ofthe Vedic Aryans, Zeus and Ares of the Homeric Greeks, were deities of thisclass, contemporary with Yahweh; and in the period (sixteenth to twentiethcenturies a.d.) of the Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Anglo-Saxon strugglesfor hegemony over the peoples of the planet, even Christ, his saints, and theVirgin Mary were converted into the tutelaries of pillaging armies.In the Arthasastra, \"Textbook on the Art of Winning,\" which is a classic Indiantreatise on polity believed to have been compiled by the counselor, Kautilya, ofthe founder of the Maurya dynasty, King Chandragupta I (reigned c. 321-297B.C.), the moral order by which all life is governed, and according to whichkings and princes are therefore to be advised, is recognized and expounded asthe \"Law of the Fish\" (matsya-nydya) , which is, simply: \"The big ones eat thelittle ones and the little ones have to be numerous and fast.\"For, whether in the depths of the forgotten sea out of which life originated, orin the jungle of its evolution on land, or now in these great cities that arebeing built to be demolished in our recurrent wars, the same dread triad ofgod-given urgencies, of feeding, procreating, and overcoming, are the motivatingpowers. And for the proper functioning of at least the first and third of thesemotivations in the fish pond of world history, the first requirement in theorder of nature—as already recognized in the passage just quoted fromDeuteronomy 7:1-6 (seventh century B.C.)-is suppression of the natural impulseto mercy.For the quality of mercy, empathy, or compassion is also a gift of nature, lateto appear in the evolution of species, yet evident already in the play and careof their young of the higher mammals. In contrast to the bioenergetic urge toprocreate, however, which is an immediate urgency of the organs, compassion,like the will to plunder, is an impulse launched from the eyes. Moreover, it isnot tribal- or species-oriented, but open to the appeal of the whole range ofliving beings. So that one of the first concerns of the elders, prophets, andestablishedpriesthoods of tribal or institutionally oriented mythological systems hasalways been to limit and define the permitted field of expression of thisexpansive faculty of the heart, holding it to a fixed focus within the fieldexclusively of the ethnic monad, while deliberately directing outward everyimpulse to violence. Within the monadic horizon deeds of violence are forbidden:\"Thou shalt not kill . . . Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife\" (Exodus20:13, 17; also, Deuteronomy 5:17, 21), whereas abroad, such acts are required:\"you shall put all its males to the sword, but the women . . . you shall take asbooty to yourselves\" (Deuteronomy 20:13-14). In Islamic thought the nations ofthe earth are distinguished as of two realms: dar aY islam, \"the realm ofsubmission [to Allah],\" and dar alharh \"the realm of war,\" which is to say, therest of the world. And in Christian thought, the words reported of theresurrected Christ to his eleven remaining apostles—\"Go ye therefore, and makedisciples of all the nations\" (Matthew 28:19)—have been interpreted as a divinemandate for a conquest of the planet.In our present day, when this same planet, Earth, rocking slowly on its axis inits course around the sun, is about to pass out of astrological range of thezodiacal sign of the Fish (Pisces) into that of the Water Bearer (Aquarius), itdoes indeed seem that a fundamental transformation of the historical conditionsof its inhabiting humanity is in prospect, and that the age of the conqueringarmies of the contending monster monads—which in the time of Sargon I of Akkad,some 4,320 years ago, was inaugurated in southern Iraq—may be about to close.For there are no more intact monadic horizons: all are dissolving. And alongwith them, the psychological hold is weakening of the mythological images andrelated social rituals by which they were supported. As already recognized halfa century ago by the Irish poet Yeats in his foreboding vision \"The SecondComing\"Turning and turning in the widening gyreThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;Things fall apart; the center cannot hold;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhereThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;The best lack all conviction, while the worstAre full of passionate intensity,Surely some revelation is at hand . . .The old gods are dead or dying and people everywhere are searching, asking: Whatis the new mythology to be, the mythology of this unified earth as of oneharmonious being?One cannot predict the next mythology any more than one can predict tonight'sdream; for a mythology is not an ideology. It is not something projected fromthe brain, but something experienced from the heart, from recognitions ofidentities behind or within the appearances of nature, perceiving with love a\"thou\" where there would have been otherwise only an \"it.\" As stated alreadycenturies ago in the Indian Kena Upanishad: \"That which in the lightning flashesforth, makes one blink, and say 'Ah!'—that 'Ah!' refers to divinity.\" Andcenturies before that, in the Chhandogya Upanishad (c. ninth century B.C.):When [in the world] one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, recognizesnothing else: that is [participation in] the Infinite. But when one sees, hears,and recognizes only otherness: that is smallness. The Infinite is the immortal.That which is small is mortal.But sir, that Infinite: upon what is it established?Upon its own greatness—or rather, not upon greatness. For by greatness peoplehere understand cows and horses, elephants and gold, slaves, wives, mansions andestates. That is not what I mean; not that! For in that context everything isestablished on something else.This Infinite of which I speak is below. It is above. It is to the west, to theeast, to the south, to the north. It is, in fact, this whole world. Andaccordingly, with respect to the notion of ego (ahamkaradesa): I also am below,above, to the east, to the south, and to the north. I, also, am this wholeworld.Or again, with respect to the Self (atman): The Self (the Spirit) is below,above, to the west, to the east, to the south, and to the north. The Self (theSpirit), indeed, is the whole world.Verily, the one who sees this way, thinks and understands this way, takespleasure in the Self, delights in the Self, dwells with the Self and knows blissin the Self; such a one is autonomous (svardj), moving through all the world atpleasure (kdmacdra). Whereas those who think otherwise are ruled by others(anya-rdjan), know but perishable pleasures, and are moved about the worldagainst their will (akdmacdra).The life of a mythology derives from the vitality of its symbols as metaphorsdelivering, not simply the idea, but a sense of actual participation in such arealization of transcendence, infinity, and abundance, as this of which theupan-ishadic authors tell. Indeed, the first and most essential service of amythology is this one, of opening the mind and heart to the utter wonder of allbeing. And the second service, then, is cosmological: of representing theuniverse and whole spectacle of nature, both as known to the mind and as beheldby the eye, as an epiphany of such kind that when lightning flashes, or asetting sun ignites the sky, or a deer is seen standing alerted, the exclamation\"Ah!\" may be uttered as a recognition of divinity.This suggests that in the new mythology, which is to be of the whole human race,the old Near Eastern desacralization of nature by way of a doctrine of the Fallwill have been rejected; so that any such limiting sentiment as that expressedin II Kings 5:15, \"there is no God in all the earth but in Israel,\" will be (touse a biblical term) an abomination. The image of the universe will no longer bethe old Sumero-Babylonian, locally centered, three-layered affair, of a heavenabove and abyss below, with an ocean-encircled bit of earth between; nor thelater, ptolemaic one, of a mysteriously suspended globe enclosed in an orderlycomplex of revolving crystalline spheres; nor even the recent heliocentric imageof a single planetary system at large within a galaxy of exploding stars; but(as of today, at least) an inconceivable immensity of galaxies, clusters ofgalaxies, andclusters of clusters (superclusters) of galaxies, speeding apart into expandingdistance, with humanity as a kind of recently developed scurf on the epidermisof one of the lesser satellites of a minor star in the outer arm of an averagegalaxy, amidst one of the lesser clusters among the thousands, catapultingapart, which took form some fifteen billion years ago as a consequence of aninconceivable preternatural event.Introduction to The Power of MythBILL MOYERSAcclaimed television journalist Bill Moyers is widely respected for his effortsto bring outstanding thinkers to television. In this selection, Moyers explainshow Campbells work has influenced him personally and demonstrates in greatdetail how it can teach us \"the experience of being alive.\" Moyers synthesizesthe essential assumptions underlining Campbells thought, showing us theimportant relevance of myths to our lives today.For weeks after Joseph Campbell died, I was reminded of him just abouteverywhere I turned.Coming up from the subway at Times Square and feeling the energy of the pressingcrowd, I smiled to myself upon remembering the image that once had appeared toCampbell there: \"The latest incarnation of Oedipus, the continued romance ofBeauty and the Beast, stands this afternoon on the corner of Forty-second Streetand Fifth Avenue, waiting for the traffic light to change.\"At a preview of John Huston's last film, The Dead, based on a story by JamesJoyce, I thought again of Campbell. One of his first important works was a keyto Finnegans Wake. What Joyce called \"the grave and constant\" in humansufferings Campbell knew to be a principal theme of classic mythology. \"Thesecret cause of all suffering,\" he said, \"is mortality itself, which is theprime condition of life. It cannot be denied if life is to be affirmed.\"Once, as we were discussing the subject of suffering, he mentioned in tandemJoyce and Igjugarjuk. \"Who is Igjugarjuk?\" I said, barely able to imitate thepronunciation. \"Oh,\" replied Campbell, \"he was the shaman of a Caribou Eskimotribe in northern Canada, the one who told European visitors that the only truewisdom lives far from mankind, out in the great loneliness, and can be reachedonly through suffering. Privation and suffering alone open the mind to all thatis hidden to others. \"\"Of course,\" I said, \"Igjugarjuk.\"Joe let pass my cultural ignorance. We had stopped walking. His eyes were alightas he said, \"Can you imagine a long evening around the fire with Joyce andIgjugarjuk? Boy, I'd like to sit in on that\"Campbell died just before the twenty-fourth anniversary of John F. Kennedy'sassassination, a tragedy he had discussed in mythological terms during our firstmeeting years earlier. Now, as that melancholy remembrance came around again, Isat talking with my grown children about Campbells reflections. The solemn statefuneral he had described as \"an illustration of the high service of ritual to asociety,\" evoking mythological themes rooted in human need. \"This was aritualized occasion of the greatest social necessity,\" Campbell had written. Thepublic murder of a president, \"representing our whole society, the living socialorganism of which ourselves were the members, taken away at a moment ofexuberant life, required a compensatory rite to reestablish the sense ofsolidarity. Here was an enormous nation, made those four days into a unanimouscommunity, all of us participating in the same way, simultaneously, in a singlesymbolic event.\" He said it was \"the first and only thing of its kind inpeacetime that has ever given me the sense of being a member of this wholenational community, engaged as a unit in the observance of a deeply significantrite.\"That description I recalled also when one of my colleagues had been asked by afriend about our collaboration with Campbell: \"Why do you need the mythology?\"She held the familiar, modern opinion that \"all these Greek gods and stuff\" areirrelevant to the human condition today. What she did not know— what most do notknow—is that the remnants of all that \"stuff\" line the walls of our interiorsystem of belief, like shards of broken pottery in an archaeological site. Butas we are organic beings, there is energy in all that \"stuff.\" Rituals evoke it.Consider the position of judges in our society, which Campbell saw inmythological, not sociological, terms. If this position were just a role, thejudge could wear a gray suit to court instead of the magisterial black robe. Forthe law to hold authority beyond mere coercion, the power of the judge must beritualized, mythologized. So must much of life today, Campbell said, fromreligion and war to love and death.Walking to work one morning after Campbell's death, I stopped before aneighborhood video store that was showing scenes from George Lucas' Star Wars ona monitor in the window. I stood there thinking of the time Campbell and I hadwatched the movie together at Lucas' Skywalker Ranch in California. Lucas andCampbell had become good friends after the filmmaker, acknowledging a debt toCampbell's work, invited the scholar to view the Star Wars trilogy. Campbellreveled in the ancient themes and motifs of mythology unfolding on the widescreen in powerful contemporary images. On this particular visit, having againexulted over the perils and heroics of Luke Skywalker, Joe grew animated as hetalked about how Lucas \"has put the newest and most powerful spin\" to theclassic story of the hero.\"And what is that?\" I asked.\"It's what Goethe said in Faust but which Lucas has dressed in modern idiom—themessage that technology is not going to save us. Our computers, ourtools, our machines are not enough. We have to rely on our intuition, our truebeing.\"\"Isn't that an affront to reason?\" I said. \"And aren't we already beating ahasty retreat from reason, as it is?\"\"That's not what the hero's journey is about. It's not to deny reason. To thecontrary, by overcoming the dark passions, the hero symbolizes our ability tocontrol the irrational savage within us.\" Campbell had lamented on otheroccasions our failure \"to admit within ourselves the carnivorous, lecherousfever\" that is endemic to human nature. Now he was describing the hero's journeynot as a courageous act but as a life lived in self-discovery, \"and LukeSkywalker was never more rational than when he found within himself theresources of character to meet his destiny.\"Ironically, to Campbell the end of the hero's journey is not the aggrandizementof the hero. \"It is,\" he said in one of his lectures, \"not to identify oneselfwith any of the figures or powers experienced. The Indian yogi, striving forrelease, identifies himself with the Light and never returns. But no one with awill to the service of others would permit himself such an escape. The ultimateaim of the quest must be neither release nor ecstasy for oneself, but the wisdomand the power to serve others.\" One of the many distinctions between thecelebrity and the hero, he said, is that one lives only for self while the otheracts to redeem society.Joseph Campbell affirmed life as adventure. \"To hell with it,\" he said, afterhis university adviser tried to hold him to a narrow academic curriculum. Hegave up on the pursuit of a doctorate and went instead into the woods to read.He continued all his life to read books about the world: anthropology, biology,philosophy, art, history, religion. And he continued to remind others that onesure path into the world runs along the printed page. A few days after hisdeath, I received a letter from one of his former students who now helps to edita major magazine. Hearing of the series on which I had been working withCampbell, she wrote to share how this man's \"cyclone of energy blew across allthe intellectual possibilities\" of the students who sat \"breathless in hisclassroom\" at Sarah Lawrence College. \"While all of us listened spellbound,\" shewrote, \"we did stagger under the weight of his weekly reading assignments.Finally, one of our number stood up and confronted him (Sarah Lawrence style),saying, 'I am taking three other courses, you know. All of them assignedreading, you know. How do you expect me to complete all this in a week?'Campbell just laughed and said, I'm astonished you tried. You have the rest ofyour life to do the reading.'\"She concluded, \"And I still haven't finished—the never ending example of hislife and work.\"One could get a sense of that impact at the memorial service held for him at theMuseum of Natural History in New York. Brought there as a boy, he had beentransfixed by the totem poles and masks. Who made them? he wondered. What didthey mean? He began to read everything he could about Indians, their myths andlegends. By ten he was into the pursuit that made him one of the world's leadingscholars of mythology and one of the most exciting teachers of our time; it wassaid that \"he could make the bones of folklore and anthropologylive.\" Now, at the memorial service in the museum where three quarters of acentury earlier his imagination had first been excited, people gathered to payhonor to his memory. There was a performance by Mickey Hart, the drummer for theGrateful Dead, the rock group with whom Campbell shared a fascination withpercussion. Robert Bly played a dulcimer and read poetry dedicated to Campbell.Former students spoke, as did friends whom he had made after he retired andmoved with his wife, the dancer Jean Erdman, to Hawaii. The great publishinghouses of New York were represented. So were writers and scholars, young andold, who had found their pathbreaker in Joseph Campbell.And journalists. I had been drawn to him eight years earlier when,self-appointed, I was attempting to bring to television the lively minds of ourtime. We had taped two programs at the museum, and so compellingly had hispresence permeated the screen that more than fourteen thousand people wroteasking for transcripts of the conversations. I vowed then that I would comeafter him again, this time for a more systematic and thorough exploration of hisideas. He wrote or edited some twenty books, but it was as a teacher that I hadexperienced him, one rich in the lore of the world and the imagery of language,and I wanted others to experience him as teacher, too. So the desire to sharethe treasure of the man inspired my PBS series and this book.A journalist, it is said, enjoys a license to be educated in public; we are thelucky ones, allowed to spend our days in a continuing course of adult education.No one has taught me more of late than Campbell, and when I told him he wouldhave to bear the responsibility for whatever comes of having me as a pupil, helaughed and quoted an old Roman: \"The fates lead him who will; him who won'tthey drag.\"He taught, as great teachers teach, by example. It was not his manner to try totalk anyone into anything (except once, when he persuaded Jean to marry him).Preachers err, he told me, by trying \"to talk people into belief; better theyreveal the radiance of their own discovery.\" How he did reveal a joy forlearning and living! Matthew Arnold believed the highest criticism is \"to knowthe best that is known and thought in the world, and by in its turn making thisknown, to create a current of true and fresh ideas.\" This is what Campbell did.It was impossible to listen to him—truly to hear him—without realizing in one'sown consciousness a stirring of fresh life, the rising of one's own imagination.He agreed that the \"guiding idea\" of his work was to find \"the commonality ofthemes in world myths, pointing to a constant requirement in the human psychefor a centering in terms of deep principles.\"\"You're talking about a search for the meaning of life?\" I asked.\"No, no, no,\" he said. \"For the experience of being alive.\"I have said that mythology is an interior road map of experience, drawn bypeople who have traveled it. He would, I suspect, not settle for thejournalist's prosaic definition. To him mythology was \"the song of theuniverse,\" \"the music of the spheres\"—music we dance to even when we cannot namethe tune. We are hearing its refrains \"whether we listen with aloof amusement tothe mumbo jumbo of some witch doctor of the Congo, or read with cultivatedrapture translations from sonnets of Lao-tsu, or now and again crack the hardnutshell of anargument of Aquinas, or catch suddenly the shining meaning of a bizarreEski-moan fairy tale.\"He imagined that this grand and cacophonous chorus began when our primalancestors told stories to themselves about the animals that they killed for foodand about the supernatural world to which the animals seemed to go when theydied. \"Out there somewhere,\" beyond the visible plain of existence, was the\"animal master,\" who held over human beings the power of life and death: if hefailed to send the beasts back to be sacrificed again, the hunters and their kinwould starve. Thus early societies learned that \"the essence of life is that itlives by killing and eating; that's the great mystery that the myths have todeal with.\" The hunt became a ritual of sacrifice, and the hunters in turnperformed acts of atonement to the departed spirits of the animals, hoping tocoax them into returning to be sacrificed again. The beasts were seen as envoysfrom that other world, and Campbell surmised \"a magical, wonderful accord\"growing between the hunter and the hunted, as if they were locked in a\"mystical, timeless\" cycle of death, burial, and resurrection. Their art—thepaintings on cave walls—and oral literature gave form to the impulse we now callreligion.As these primal folk turned from hunting to planting, the stories they told tointerpret the mysteries of life changed, too. Now the seed became the magicsymbol of the endless cycle. The plant died, and was buried, and its seed wasborn again. Campbell was fascinated by how this symbol was seized upon by theworld's great religions as the revelation of eternal truth—that from death comeslife, or as he put it: \"From sacrifice, bliss.\"\"Jesus had the eye,\" he said. \"What a magnificent reality he saw in the mustardseed.\" He would quote the words of Jesus from the gospel of John— \"Truly, truly,I say unto you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, itremains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit\"—and in the next breath, theKoran: \"Do you think that you shall enter the Garden of Bliss without suchtrials as came to those who passed away before you?\" He roamed this vastliterature of the spirit, even translating the Hindu scriptures from Sanskrit,and continued to collect more recent stories which he added to the wisdom of theancients. One story he especially liked told of the troubled woman who came tothe Indian saint and sage Ramakrishna, saying, \"O Master, I do not find that Ilove God.\" And he asked, \"Is there nothing, then, that you love?\" To this sheanswered, \"My little nephew.\" And he said to her, \"There is your love andservice to God, in your love and service to that child.\"\"And there,\" said Campbell, \"is the high message of religion: Inasmuch as yehave done it unto one of the least of these . .A spiritual man, he found in the literature of faith those principles common tothe human spirit. But they had to be liberated from tribal lien, or thereligions of the world would remain—as in the Middle East and Northern Irelandtoday—the source of disdain and aggression. The images of God are many, he said,calling them \"the masks of eternity\" that both cover and reveal \"the Face ofGlory.\" He wanted to know what it means that God assumes such different masks indifferent cultures, yet how it is that comparable stories can be found in thesedivergent traditions—stories of creation, of virgin births, incarnations, deathand resurrection, second comings, and judgment days. He liked the insight of theHindu scripture: \"Truth is one; the sages call it by many names.\" All our namesand images for God are masks, he said, signifying the ultimate reality that bydefinition transcends language and art. A myth is a mask of God, too—a metaphorfor what lies behind the visible world. However the mystic traditions differ, hesaid, they are in accord in calling us to a deeper awareness of the very act ofliving itself. The unpardonable sin, in Campbell's book, was the sin ofinadvertence, of not being alert, not quite awake.I never met anyone who could better tell a story. Listening to him talk ofprimal societies, I was transported to the wide plains under the great dome ofthe open sky, or to the forest dense, beneath a canopy of trees, and I began tounderstand how the voices of the gods spoke from the wind and thunder, and thespirit of God flowed in every mountain stream, and the whole earth bloomed as asacred place—the realm of mythic imagination. And I asked: Now that we modernshave stripped the earth of its mystery—have made, in Saul Bellow's description,\"a housecleaning of belief\"—how are our imaginations to be nourished? ByHollywood and made-for-TV movies?Campbell was no pessimist. He believed there is a \"point of wisdom beyond theconflicts of illusion and truth by which lives can be put back together again.\"Finding it is the \"prime question of the time.\" In his final years he wasstriving for a new synthesis of science and spirit. \"The shift from a geocentricto a heliocentric world view,\" he wrote after the astronauts touched the moon,\"seemed to have removed man from the center—and the center seemed so important.Spiritually, however, the center is where sight is. Stand on a height and viewthe horizon. Stand on the moon and view the whole earth rising—even, by way oftelevision, in your parlor.\" The result is an unprecedented expansion ofhorizon, one that could well serve in our age, as the ancient mythologies did intheirs, to cleanse the doors of perception \"to the wonder, at once terrible andfascinating, of ourselves and of the universe.\" He argued that it is not sciencethat has diminished human beings or divorced us from divinity. On the contrary,the new discoveries of science \"rejoin us to the ancients\" by enabling us torecognize in this whole universe \"a reflection magnified of our own most inwardnature; so that we are indeed its ears, its eyes, its thinking, and itsspeech—or, in theological terms, God's ears, God's eyes, God's thinking, andGod's Word.\" The last time I saw him I asked him if he still believed—as he oncehad written—\"that we are at this moment participating in one of the verygreatest leaps of the human spirit to a knowledge not only of outside nature butalso of our own deep inward mystery.\"He thought a minute and answered, \"The greatest ever.\"When I heard the news of his death, I tarried awhile in the copy he had given meof The Hero with a Thousand Faces. And I thought of the time I first discoveredthe world of the mythic hero. I had wandered into the little public library ofthe town where I grew up and, casually exploring the stacks, pulled down a bookthat opened wonders to me: Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods for the sakeof the human race; Jason, braving the dragon to seize the Golden Fleece; theKnights of the Round Table, pursuing the Holy Grail. Butnot until I met Joseph Campbell did I understand that the Westerns I saw at theSaturday matinees had borrowed freely from those ancient tales. And that thestories we learned in Sunday school corresponded with those of other culturesthat recognized the soul's high adventure, the quest of mortals to grasp thereality of God. He helped me to see the connections, to understand how thepieces fit, and not merely to fear less but to welcome what he described as \"amighty multicultural future.\"He was, of course, criticized for dwelling on the psychological interpretationof myth, for seeming to confine the contemporary role of myth to either anideological or a therapeutic function. I am not competent to enter that debate,and leave it for others to wage. He never seemed bothered by the controversy. Hejust kept on teaching, opening others to a new way of seeing.It was, above all, the authentic life he lived that instructs us. When he saidthat myths are clues to our deepest spiritual potential, able to lead us todelight, illumination, and even rapture, he spoke as one who had been to theplaces he was inviting others to visit.What did draw me to him?Wisdom, yes; he was very wise.And learning; he did indeed \"know the vast sweep of our panoramic past as fewmen have ever known it.\"But there was more.A story's the way to tell it. He was a man with a thousand stories. This was oneof his favorites. In Japan for an international conference on religion, Campbelloverheard another American delegate, a social philosopher from New York, say toa Shinto priest, \"We've been now to a good many ceremonies and have seen quite afew of your shrines. But I don't get your ideology. I don't get your theology.\"The Japanese paused as though in deep thought and then slowly shook his head. \"Ithink we don't have ideology,\" he said. \"We don't have theology. We dance.\"And so did Joseph Campbell—to the music of the spheres.Patterns in Comparative ReligionMIRCEA ELIADEThe work ofMircea Eliade, past professor of history of religion at theUniversity of Chicago, focuses on the elements of religious experience in bothmyth and ritual as symbolic realities. His study of Shamans has beenacknowledged as the definitive work on the subject. In this selection, Eliadediscusses the fundamental unity of seemingly opposite concepts such as life anddeath and masculine and feminine principles as they are manifested in the greatmythological structures. As Eliade explores the relationship between myth andhistory, he enhances the readers understanding of the concept that mythsurpasses history by being transformed through time.WHAT MYTHS REVEAL1 he myth, whatever its nature, is always a precedent and an example, not onlyfor man's actions (sacred or profane), but also as regards the condition inwhich his nature places him; a precedent, we may say, for the expression s ofreality as a whole. \"We must do what the gods did in the beginning\"; \"Thus thegods acted, thus men act.\" Statements of this kind give a perfect indication ofprimitive man's conduct, but they do not necessarily exhaust the content andfunction of myths; indeed one whole series of myths, recording what gods ormythical beings did in illo tempore, discloses a level of reality quite beyondany empirical or rational comprehension. There are, among others, the myths wemay lump together as the myths of polarity (or bi-unity) and reintegration,which I have studied by themselves in another book. There is a major group ofmythological traditions about the \"brotherhood\" of gods and demons (forinstance, the devas 1 and asuras), the \"friendship\" or consanguinity betweenheroes and their opponents (as with Indra and Namuki), between legendary saintsand she-devils (of the type of folklore's Saint Sisinius and his sister theshe-devil Uerzelia), and so on. The myths giving a common \"father\" to figuresembodying diametrically opposed principles still survive in the religioustraditions which lay the stress on dualism, like the Iranian theology. Zervanismcalls Ormuzd and Ahriman brothers, both sons of Zervan, and even the Avestabears traces of the same idea. This myth has in some cases also passed intopopular traditions: there are a number of Rumanian beliefs and proverbs callingGod and Satan brothers.There is another category of myths and legends illustrating not merely abrotherhood between opposing figures, but their paradoxical convertibility. Thesun, prototype of the gods, is sometimes called \"Serpent\" and Agni, the god offire, is at the same time a \"priest Asura\"—essentially a demon; he is sometimesdescribed as \"without feet or head, hiding both his heads\" just like a coiledsnake. The Aitareya Brahmana declares that Ahi-Budhnya is invisibly16 MlRCEA ELIADE(paroksena) what Agni is visibly (pratyaksa); in other words, the serpent issimply a virtuality of fire, while darkness is light in its latent state. In theVdjasaneyi Samhitd, Ahi-Budhnya is identified with the sun. Soma, the drinkwhich bestows immortality, is supremely \"divine,\" \"solar,\" and yet we read inthe Rg Veda that soma, \"like Agni, slips out of its old skin,\" which seems togive it a serpentine quality. Varuna, sky god and archetype of the \"UniversalSovereign,\" is also the god of the ocean, where serpents dwell, as theMahdbhdrata explains; he is the \"king of serpents\" (ndgardjd) and the AtharvaVeda even goes so far as to call him \"viper.\"In any logical perspective, all these reptilian attributes ought not to fit asky divinity like Varuna. But myth reveals a region of ontology inaccessible tosuperficial logical experience. The myth of Varuna discloses the divinebi-unity, the apposition of contraries, all attributes whatever brought to theirtotality within the divine nature. Myth expresses in action and drama whatmetaphysics and theology define dialectically. Heraclitus saw that \"God is dayand night, winter and summer, war and peace, satiety and hunger: all oppositesare in him.\" We find a similar formulation of this idea in an Indian text whichtells us that the goddess \"is sri [splendour] in the house of those who do good,but alaksmi [the opposite of Laksmi, goddess of good luck and prosperity] in thehouse of the *J> v wicked.\" But this text is simply making clear in it own waythe fact that the Indian Jj^ v-K Great Godesses (Kali and the rest) like allother Great Goddesses, possess ataK it* once both the attributes of gentleness and of dread. They are at oncedivinities of yj^* fertility and destruction, of birth and of death (and oftenalso of war). Kali, forjs<*^ instance, is called \"the gentle and benevolent,\" although the mythologyandiconography connected with her are terrifying (Kali is covered in blood, wears anecklace of human skulls, holds a cup made out of a skull, and so on), and hercult is the bloodiest anywhere in Asia. In India, every divinity has a \"gentleform\" and equally a \"terrible form\" (krodha-murti). In this, Siva may be lookedon as the archetype of a tremendous series of gods and goddesses for herhythmically creates and destroys the entire universe.COINCIDENT1A OPPOS1TORUM— THE MYTHICAL PATTERNAll these myths present us with a twofold revelation: they express on the onehand the diametrical opposition of two divine figures sprung from one and thesame principle and destined, in many versions, to be reconciled at some illudtempus of eschatology, and on the other, the coincidentia oppositorum in thevery nature of the divinity, which shows itself, by turns or evensimultaneously, benevolent and terrible, creative and destructive, solar andserpentine, and so on (in other words, actual and potential). In this sense itis true to say that myth reveals more profoundly than any rational experienceever could, the actual structure of the divinity, which transcends allattributes and reconciles all contraries. That this mythical experience is nomere deviation is proved by the fact that it enters into almost all thereligious experience of mankind, even within as strict a tradition astheJudaeo-Christian. Yahweh is both kind and wrathful; the God of the Christianmystics and theologians is terrible and gentle at once and itis this coincidentia oppositorum which is the starting point for the boldestspeculations of such men as the pseudo-Dionysius, Meister Eckhardt, and Nicholasof Cusa.The coincidentia oppositorum is ^riP ^ f ^ ™ns,t primitive wavs of expressingthe paradox of divine reality. ^ Ve shall be returning to this formula when wecome to look at divine \"forms,\" to the peculiar structure revealed by everydivine \"personality,\" given of course that the divine personality is not to besimply looked upon as a mere projection of human personality. However, althoughthis conception, in which all contraries are reconciled (or rather,transcended), constitutes what is, in fact, the most basic definition ofdivinity, and shows how utterly different it is from humanity, the coincidentiaoppositorum becomes nevertheless an archetypal model for certain types ofreligious men, or for certain of the forms religious experience takes. Thecoincidentia oppositorum or transcending of all attributes can be achieved byman in all sorts of ways. At the most elementary level of religious life thereis the orgy: for it symbolizes a return to the amorphous and the indistinct, toa state in which all attributes disappear and contraries are merged. But exactlythe same doctrine can also be discerned in the highest ideas of the eastern sageand ascetic, whose contemplative methods and techniques are aimed attranscending all attributes of every kind. The ascetic, the sage, the Indian orChinese \"mystic\" tries to wipe out of his experience and consciousness everysort of \"extreme,\" to attain to a state of perfect indifference and neutrality,to become insensible to pleasure and pain, to become completely self-sufficient.This transcending of extremes through asceticism and contemplation also resultsin the \"coinciding of opposites\"; the consciousness of such a man knows no moreconflict, and such pairs of opposites as pleasure and pain, desire andrepulsion, cold and heat, the agreeable and the disagreeable are expunged fromhis awareness, while something is taking place within him which parallels thetotal realization of contraries within the divinity. As we saw earlier, theoriental mind cannot conceive perfection unless all opposites are present intheir fulness. The neophyte begins by identifying all his experience with therhythms governing the universe (sun and moon), but once this \"cosmisation\" hasbeen achieved, he turns all his efforts toward unifying the sun and moon,towards taking into himself the cosmos as a whole; he remakes in himself and forhimself the primeval unity which was before the world was made; a unity whichsignifies not the chaos that existed before any forms were created but theundifferentiated being in which all forms are merged.THE MYTH OF DIVINE ANDROGYNYAnother example will illustrate more clearly still the efforts made by religiousman to imitate the divine archetype revealed in myth. Since all attri-bntespvist together in the divinity, then one must expect to see both sexes more orless clearly expressed together. D ivine androgyny is simply a primitive formulafor the divine bi-unity; mythological and religious thought, before expressingthis concept of divine two-in-oneness in metaphysical terms (esse and non esse),or theological terms (the revealed and unrevealed), expressed it first in the18 MlRCEA ELIADEbiological terms of bisexuality. We have already noted on more than one occasionhow archaic ontology was expressed in biological terms. But we must not make themistake of taking the terminology superficially in the concrete, profane(\"modern\") sense of the words. The word \"woman,\" in myth or ritual, is neverjust woman: it includes the cosmological principle woman embodies. And thedivine androgyny which we find in so many myths and beliefs has its owntheoretical, metaphysical significance. The real point of the formula is toexpress—in biological terms—the coexistence of contraries, of cosmologicalprinciples (male and female) within the heart of the divinity.This is not the place to consider the problem which I discussed in my MitulReintegrarii. We must simply note that the divinities of cosmic fertility are,for the most part, either hermaphrodites or male one year and female the next(cf. for instance the Estonians' \"spirit of the forest\"). Most of the vegetationdivinities (such as Attis, Adonis, Dionysos) are bisexual, and so are the GreatMothers (like Cybele). The primal god is androgynous in as primitive a religionas the Australian as well as in the most highly developed religions in India andelsewhere (sometimes even Dyaus; Purusa, the cosmic giant of the Rg Veda, etc.).The most important couple in the Indian pantheon, Siva-Kali, are sometimesrepresented as a single being (ardhanarisvara). And Tantric iconography swarmswith pictures of the God Siva closely entwined with Sakti, his own \"power,\"depicted as a feminine divinity (Kali). And then, too, all of Indian eroticmysticism is expressly aimed at perfecting man by identifying him with a \"divinepair,\" that is, by way of androgyny.Divine bisexuality is an element found in a great many religions and—a pointworth noting—even the most supremely masculine or feminine divinities areandrogynous. Under whatever form the divinity manifests itself, he or she isultimate reality, absolute power, and this reality, this power, will not letitself be limited by any attributes whatsoever (good, evil, male, female, oranything else). Several of the most ancient Egyptian gods were bisexual. Amongthe Greeks, androgyny was acknowledged even down to the last centuries ofAntiquity. Almost all the major gods in Scandinavian mythology always preservedtraces of androgyny: Odhin, Loki, Tuisco, Nerthus, and so on. The Iranian god oflimitless time, Zervan, whom the Greek historians rightly saw as Chronos, wasalso androgynous and Zervan, as we noted earlier, gave birth to twin sons,Ormuzd and Ahriman, the god of \"good\" and the god of \"evil,\" the god of \"light\"and the god of \"darkness.\" Even the Chinese had a hermaphrodite SupremeDivinity, who was the god of darkness and of light; the symbol is a consistentone, for light and darkness are simply successive aspects of one and the samereality; seen apart the two might seem separate and opposed, but in the sight ofthe wise man they are not merely \"twins\" (like Ormuzd and Ahriman), but form asingle essence, now manifest, now unmanifest.Divine couples (like Bel and Belit, and so on) are most usually laterfabrications or imperfect formulations of the primeval androgyny thatcharacterizes all divinities. Thus, with the Semites, the goddess Tanit wasnicknamed \"daughter of Baal\" and Astarte the \"name of Baal.\" There areinnumerable cases of the divinity's being given the title of \"father andmother\"; worlds, beings, men, allwere born of his own substance with no other agency involved. Divine androgynywould include as a logical consequence monogeny or autogeny, and very many mythstell how the divinity drew his existence from himself—a simple and dramatic wayof explaining that he is totally self-sufficient. The same myth was to appearagain, though based this time on a complex metaphysic, in the neo-Platonic andgnostic speculations of late Antiquity.THE MYTH OF HUMAN ANDROGYNYCorresponding to this myth of divine androgyny—which reveals the paradox ofdivine existence more clearly than any of the other formulae for thecoinci-dentia oppositorum —there is a whol e series of myths ^A ritnolg r ^lQfjn g fr> iumanjandrogyny. The divine myth forms the paradigm for man's religiousexperience. A great many traditions hold that tj^e \"primeval man . \" *hp anrpstnr wa<; a hermaphro di^(Tuisco is the type) and later mythical variantsspeak of \"primeval pairs (Yama—that is, \"twin\"—and his sister, Yami, or theIranian pair Yima and Yimagh, or Mashyagh and Mashyanagh). Several rabbinicalcommentaries give us to understand that even Adam was sometimes thought of asandrogynous. In this case, the \"birth\" of Eve would have been simply thedivision of the primeval hermaphrodite into two beings, male and female. \"Adamand Eve were made back to back, attached at their shoulders; then God separatedthem with an axe, or cut them in two. Others have a different picture: the firstman, Adam, was a man on his right side, a woman on his left; but God split himinto two halves.\" The bisexuality of the first man is an even more livingtradition in the societies we call primitive (for instance in Australia, andOceania) and was even preserved, and improved upon, in anthropology as advancedas that of Plato and the gnostics.We have a further proof that the androgyny of the first man must be seen as oneof t he expressions of pe rfection and totalization in the fact that the firsthermaphrodite was very often thoug ht of as sphericalj Australia; Plato): and itis well known that the splieig symbolized perfection and totality from the timeof the most ancient cultures (as in China). The myth of a primordialhermaphrodite spherical in form thus links up with the myth of the cosmogonicegg. For instance, in Taoist tradition, \"breathing\"—which embodied, among otherthings, the two sexes—merged together and formed an egg, the Great One; fromthis heaven and earth were later detached. This cosmological schema was clearlythe model for the Taoist techniques of mystical physiology.The myth of the hermaphrodite god and bisexual ancestor (or first man) is theparadigm for a whole series of ceremonies which are directed towards a periodicreturning to this original condition which is thought to be the perfectexpression of humanity. In addition to the circumcision and subincision whichare performed on young aboriginals, male and female respectively, with the aimof transforming them into hermaphrodites, I would also mention all theceremonies of \"exchanging costume\" which are lesser versions of the same thing.In India, Persia, and other parts of Asia, the ritual of \"exchanging clothes\"played a20 MlRCEA ELIADEmajor part in agricultural feasts. In some regions of India, the men even worefalse bosoms during the feast of the goddess of vegetation who was, herself,also, of course, androgynous.In short, from time to time man feels the need to return—if only for aninstant—to the state of perfect humanity in which the sexes exist side by sideas they coexist with all other qualities, and all other attributes, in theDivinity. The man dressed in woman's clothes is not trying to make himself awoman, as a first glance might suggest, but for a moment he is effecting theunity of the sexes, and thus facilitating his total understanding of the cosmos.The need man feels to cancel periodically his differentiated and determinedcondition so as to return to primeval \"totalization\" is the same need whichspurs him to periodic orgies in which all forms dissolve, to end by recoveringthat \"oneness\" that was before the creation. Here again we come upon the need todestroy the past, to expunge \"history\" and to start a new life in a newCreation. The ritual of \"exchanging costumes\" is similar in essence to theceremonial orgy; and, indeed, these disguises were very often the occasion foractual orgies to break loose. However, even the wildest variants on theserituals never succeeded in abolishing their essential significance—of makingtheir participants once more share in the para-disal condition of \"primevalman.\" And all these rituals have as their exemplar model the myth of divineandrogyny.If I wished to give more examples of the paradigmatic function of myths I shouldonly have to go again through the larger part of the material given in thepreceding chapters. As we have seen, it is not simply a question of a paradigmfor ritual, but for other religious and metaphysical experience as well, for\"wisdom,\" the techniques of mystical physiology and so on. The most fundamentalof the myths reveal archetypes which man labours to reenact, often quite outsidereligious life properly so called. As a single example: androgyny may beattained not only by the surgical operations that accompany Australianinitiation ceremonies, by ritual orgy, by \"exchanging costumes\" and the rest,but also by means of alchemy (cf. rebis, formula of the Philosophers' Stone,also called the \"hermetic hermaphrodite\"), through marriage (e.g., in theKabbala), and even, in romantic German ideology, by sexual intercourse. Indeed,we may even talk of the \"an-drogynization\" of man through love, for in love eachsex attains, conquers the \"characteristics\" of the opposite sex (as with thegrace, submission, and devotion achieved by a man when he is in love, and soon).MYTHS OF RENEWAL, CONSTRUCTION, INITIATION, AND SO ONIn no case ca n a m yth be taken as merely the fantastic projection of a\"natu-mr^eventOn the -pla nejof magico -religious experience, as 1 have already*pointed out, nature is never \"natural, what looks like\" a natural situation or■process to the empirical and rational mind, is a kratophany or hierophany inmagico-religious experience. And it is by these kratophanies or hierophaniesalone that \"nature\" becomes something magico-religious, and, as such, ofinterest to religious phenomenology and the history of religions. The myths ofthe\"gods of vegetation\" constitute, in this regard, an excellent example of thetransformation and significance of a \"natural\" cosmic event. It was not theperiodic-disappearing and reappearing of vegetation which produced the figuresand myths of the vegatation gods (Tammuz, Attis, Osiris, and the rest); atleast, it was not the mere empirical, rational, observation of the \"natural\"phenomenon. The appearing and disappearing of vegetation were always felt, inthe perspective of magico-religious experience, to be a sign of the periodiccreation of the Universe. The sufferings, death and resurrection of Tammuz, asthey appear in myth and in the things they reveal, are as far removed from the\"natural phenomenon\" of winter and spring as Madame Bovary or Anna Karenina froman adultery. Myth is an autonomous act of creation by the mind: it is throughthat act of creation that revelation is brought about—not through the things orevents it makes use of. In short, the drama of the death and resurrection ofvegetation is revealed by the myth of Tammuz, rather than the other way about.Indeed, the myth of Tammuz, and the myths of gods like him, disclose aspects ofthe nature of the co smo s which extend far beyo nd the sphere of plant Co&w*life; it discloses on the one hand, the fundamental unity ot lite and d eath,and on Mirf * the other, the hopes man draws, with good reason, from thatfundamental unity, ' / m>^ tor his own lite after death. From this point otview, we may lodk upuii the lily ihs ^ ^ot the sufferings, deaths and resurrections of the vegetation gods as paradigmsof ftth^^ the state of mankind: they reveal \"nature\" better and more intimatelythan any t j l y^ -~'»0 empirical or rational experience and observation could,and it is to maintain and jrenew that revelation that the myth must be constantly celebrated and repeated;t<4^ ' the appearing and disappearing of vegetation, in themselves, as \"cosmicphe- ^tf&t . nomena,\" signify no more than they actually are: a periodicappearance and disappearance of plant life. Only myth can transform this eventinto a mode of being: on one hand, of course, because the death and resurrectionof the vegetation gods become archetypes of all deaths and all resurrections,whatever form they take, and on whatever plane they occur, but also because theyare better than any empirical or rational means of revealing human destiny.In the same way, some of the cosmogonic myths, telling how the universe was madeout of the body of a primeval giant, if not of the body and blood of the creatorhimself, became the model not only for the \"rites for building\" (involving, aswe know, the sacrifice of a living being to accompany the setting up of a house,bridge or sanctuary) but also for all forms of \"creation\" in the broadest senseof the word. The myth revealed the nature of all \"creations\"—that they cannot beaccomplished without an \"animation,\" without a direct giving of life by acreature already possessing that life; at the same time it revealed man'spow-erlessness to create apart from reproducing his own species—and even that,in many societies, is held to be the work of religious forces outside man(children are thought to come from trees, stones, water, \"ancestors,\" and soon).A mass of myths and legends describe the \"difficulties\" demi-gods and heroesmeet with in entering a \"forbidden domain,\" a transcendent place— heaven orhell. There is a bridg e th at cuts like a knife to c ross, a quivering creepingph nV^^L^WU^±mM lmost touchmgi prks hi,pass between, a door to heenteredtTiaTisjppenonlv for an in stant^a place surrounded by mountains,picture1 [images/picture1.jpg]by water, by a circle of fire, guarded by monsters, or a door standing at thespot \"where Sky and Earth\" meet, or where \"the ends of the Year\" come together.Some versions of this myth of trials, like the labours and adventures ofHercules, the expedition of the Argonauts and others, even had a tremendousliterary career in antiquity, being constantly used and remodelled by poets andmyth-ographers; they, in their turn, were imitated in the cycles ofsemi-historic legend, like the cycle of Alexander the Great, who also wanderedthrough the land of darkness, sought the herb of life, fought with monsters, andso on. Many of these myths were, without doubt, the archetypes of initiationrites (as for instance, the duel with a three-headed monster, that classic\"trial\" in military initiations). But these myths of the \"search for thetranscendent land\" explain something else in addition to initiation dramas; theyshow the paradox of getting beyond opposition, which is a necessary part of anyworld (of any \"condition\"). Going through the \"narrow door,\" through the \"eye ofthe needle,\" between \"rocks that touch,\" and all the rest, always involves apair of opposites (like good and evil, night and day, high and low, etc.). Inthis sense, it is true to say that the myths of \"quest\" and of \"initiationtrials\" reveal, in artistic or dramatic form, the actual act by which the mindgets beyond a conditioned, piece-meal universe, swinging between opposites, toreturn to the fundamental oneness that existed before creation.THE MAKE-UP OF A MYTH: VARUNA AND VRTRA^[ythi like ^ymknl has its own particular \"logiji \" lf s. own intrimi n consistency which enables it to be \"true\" on a variety of planes, however far removedthey may be from the plane upon which the myth originally appeared. I remarkedearlier in how many ways and from how many differing standpoints the creationmyth is \"true\"—and therefore effective, \"usable.\" For another example, let usturn once again to the myth and structure of Varuna, sovereign sky god,all-powerful, and, upon occasions, one who \"binds\" by his \"spiritual power,\" by\"magic.\" But his cosmic aspect is more complex still: as we saw, he is not onlya sky god, but also a moon and water god. There was a certain \"nocturnal\"keynote in Varuna—possibly from a very early date indeed—upon which Bergaigne,and, more recently, Coomaraswamy, have laid great stress. Bergaigne pointed outthat the commentator ofTaittiriya Sarhhitd speaks of Varuna as \"he who envelopelike darkness.\" This \"nocturnal\" side of Varuna must not be interpreted only inthe atmospheric sense of the \"night sky,\" but also in a wider sense more trulycosmological and even metaphysical: night, too, is potentiality, seed,non-manifestation, and it is because Varuna has this \"nocturnal\" element that hecan become a god of water, and can be assimilated with the demon Vrtra.This is not the place to go into the \"Vrtra-Varuna\" problem, and we must becontent with noting the fact that the two beings have more than one trait incommon. Even leaving aside the probable etymological relationship between theirtwo names, we should note that both are connected with water, and pri-marily with \"water held back\" (\"Great Varuna has hidden the sea\") and thatVrtra, like Varuna, is sometimes called mdyin, or magician. From one point ofview, these various identifications with Vrtra, like all Varuna's otherattributes and functions, fit together and help to explain each other. Night(the non-manifest), water (the potential, seeds), transcendence and impassivity(both marks of supreme gods and sky gods) are linked both mythologically andmetaphysically with, on the one hand, every kind of being that \"binds\" and, onthe other, the Vrtra who \"holds back,\" \"stops\" or \"imprisons\" the waters. At thecosmic level, Vrtra, too, is a \"binder.\" Like all the great myths, the myth ofVrtra has thus got many meanings, and no single interpretation exhausts it. Wemight even say that one of the main functions of myth is to determine, toauthenticate the levels of reality which both a first impression and furtherthought indicate to be manifold and heterogeneous. Thus, in the myth of Vrtra,besides other significations, we note that of returning to the non-manifest, ofa \"stopping,\" of a \"bond\" preventing \"forms\"—the life of the Cosmos, infact—from manifestation. Obviously we must not push the parallel between Vrtraand Varuna too far. But there can be no denying the structural connectionbetween the \"nocturnal,\" \"impassive,\" \"magician,\" Varuna, \"binding\" the guiltyfrom afar, and Vrtra \"imprisoning\" the waters. Both are acting so as to stoplife, and bring death, the one on an individual, the other, on a cosmic scale.MYTH AS \"EXEMPLAR HISTORY\"Every myth, whatever its nature, recounts an event that took place in illotempore, and constitutes as a result, a precedent and pattern for all theactions and \"situations\" later to repeat that event. Every ritual, and everymeaningful act that man performs, repeats a mythical archetype; and, as we saw,this repetition involves the abolition of profane time and placing of man in amagico-religious time which has no connection with succession in the true sense,but forms the \"eternal now\" of mythical time. In other words, along with othermagico-religious experiences, myth makes man once more exist in a timelessperiod, which is in effect an illud tempus, a time of dawn and of \"paradise,\"outside history. Anyone who performs any rite transcends profane time and space;similarly, anyone who \"imitates\" a mythological model or even ritually assistsat the retelling of a myth (taking part in it), is taken out of profane\"becoming,\" and returns to the Great Time.We moderns would say that mvtjj (and with it all other religious experiences) abolishes \"history!f But note that the majority of myths, simply because theyrecord what took place \"in illo tempore,\" themselves constitute an exemplarhistory for the human society in which they have been preserved, and for theworld that society lives in. Even tkeCJ)smogonic,myt h is historvfor it recountsall {fat fo ol plapp ah nrieine . but we must, I need hardly say, remember thatit is not \"history\" in our sense of the word—things that took place once andwill never take place again—but exemplar history which can be repeated(regularly or otherwise), and whose meaning and value lie in that veryrepetition. Thehistory that took place at the beginning must be repeated because the primevalepiphanies were prolific—they could not be fully expressed in a singlemanifestation. And myths too are prolific in their content, for it isparadigmatic, and therefore presents a meaning, creates something, tells ussomething.The function of myths as exemplar history is further apparent from the needprimitive man feels to show \"proofs\" of the event recorded in the myth. Supposethat it is a well known mythological theme: such and such a thing happened, menbecame mortal, seals lost their toes, a mark appeared on the moon, or somethingsimilar. To the primitive mind this theme can be clearly \"proved\" by the factthat man is mortal, seals have no toes, the moon has got marks on it. The mythwhich tells how the island of Tonga was fished up from the bottom of the sea isproved by the fact that you can still see the line used to pull it up, and therock where the hook caught. This need to prove the truth of myth also helps usto grasp what history and \"historical evidence\" mean to the primitive mind. Itshows what an importance primitive man attaches to things that have reallyhappened, to the events which actually took place in his surroundings; it showshow his mind hungers for what is \"real,\" for what is in the fullest sense. But,at the same time, the archetypal function given to these events oiillud tempusgive us a glimpse of the interest primitive people take in realities that aresignificant, creative, paradigmatic. This interest survived even in the firsthistorians of the ancient world, for to them the \"past\" had meaning only in sofar as it was an example to be imitated, and consequently formed the summa ofthe learning of all mankind. This work of \"exemplar history' which devolved uponmyth must, if we are to understand it properly, be seen in relation to primitiveman's tendency to effect a concrete realization of an ideal archetype, to liveeternity \"experientially\" here and now—an aspiration which we studied in ouranalysis of sacred time.THE CORRUPTION OF MYTHSA myth may dege nerate into an epic lege nd, a ballad or a romance, o rsurvive^rwrry in the attenuated tprm of superstitions, customs, nostalgias, anaso on; for all this, it loses neither its essence nor its significance. Rememberhow the myth of the Cosmic Tree was preserved in legend and in the rites forgathering simples. The \"trials,\" sufferings, and journeyings of the candidatefor initiation survived in the tales of the sufferings and obstacles undergoneby heroes of epic or drama before they gained their end (Ulysses, Aeneas,Parsifal, certain of Shakespeare's characters, Faust, and so on). All these\"trials\" and \"sufferings\" which make up the stories of epic, drama or romancecan be clearly connected with the ritual sufferings and obstacles on the \"way tothe centre.\" No doubt the \"way\" is not on the same initiatory plane, but,typologically, the wanderings of Ulysses, or the search for the Holy Grail, areechoed in the great novels of the nineteenth century, to say nothing ofpaperback novels, the archaic origins of whose plots are not hard to trace. Ifto-day, detective stories recount the contest between a criminal and a detective(the good genie and wicked genie, the dragon and fairy prince of the oldstories), whereas a few generations back, they preferred to show an orphanprince or innocent maiden at grips with a \"villain,\"while the fashion of a hundred and fifty years ago was for \"black\" and turgidromances with \"black monks,\" \"Italians,\" \"villains,\" \"abducted maidens,\" \"maskedprotectors,\" and so on, such variations of detail are due to the differentcolouring and turn of popular sentiment; the theme does not change.Obviously, every further step down brings with it a blurring of the conflict andcharacters of the drama as well as a greater number of additions supplied by\"local colour.\" But the patterns that have come down from the distant past neverdisappear; they do not lose the possibility of being brought back to life. Theyretain their point even for the \"modern\" consciousness. To take one of athousand examples: Achilles and S0ren Kierkegaard. Achilles, like many otherheroes, did not marry, though a happy and fruitful life had been predicted forhim had he done so; but in that case he would have given up becoming a hero, hewould not have realized his unique success, would not have gained immortality.Kierkegaard passed through exactly the same existential drama with regard toRegina Olsen; he gave up marriage to remain himself, unique, that he might hopefor the eternal by refusing the path of a happy life with the general run ofmen. He makes this clear in a fragment of his private Journal: \"I should behappier, in a finite sense, could I drive out this thorn I feel in my flesh; butin the infinite sense, I should be lost.\" In this way a mythical pattern canstill be realized, and is in fact realized, on the plane of existentialexperience, and, certainly in this case, with no thought of or influence fromthe myth.The archetype is still creative even though sunk to lower and lower levels. So,for instance, with the myth of the Fortunate Islands or that of the EarthlyParadise, which obsessed not only the imagination of the secular mind, butnautical science too right up to the great age of seafaring discoveries. Almostall navigators, even those bent on a definite economic purpose (like the Indianroute), also hoped to discover the Islands of the Blessed or the EarthlyParadise. And we all know that there were many who thought they had actuallyfound the Island of Paradise. From the Phoenicians to the Portuguese, all thememorable geographical discoveries were the result of this myth of the land ofEden. And these voyages, searches, and discoveries were the only ones to acquirea spiritual meaning, to create culture. If the memory of Alexander's journey toIndia never faded it was because, being classed with the great myths, itsatisfied the longing for \"mythical geography\"—the only sort of geography mancould never do without. The Genoese commercial ventures in Crimea and theCaspian Sea, and the Venetian in Syria and in Egypt, must have meant a veryadvanced degree of nautical skill, and yet the mercantile routes in question\"have left no memory in the history of geographical discovery.\" On the otherhand, expeditions to discover the mythical countries did not only createlegends: they also brought an increase of geographical knowledge.These islands and these new lands preserved their mythical character long aftergeography had become scientific. The \"Isles of the Blessed\" survived tillCamoens, passed through the age of enlightenment and the romantic age, and havetheir place even in our own day. But the mythical island no longer means thegarden of Eden: it is Camoens' Isle of Love, Daniel Defoe's island of the \"goodsavage,\" Eminescu's Island of Euthanasius, the \"exotic\" isle, a land ofdreams with hidden beauties, or the island of liberty, or perfect rest—or idealholidays, or cruises on luxury steamers, to which modern man aspires in themirages offered to him by books, films or his own imagination. The function ofthe paradisal land of perfect freedom remains unchanged; it is just that man'sview of it has undergone a great many displacements—from Paradise in thebiblical sense to the exotic paradise of our contemporaries' dreams. A decline,no doubt, but a very prolific one. At all levels of human experience, howeverordinary, archetypes still continue to give meaning to life and to create\"cultural values\": the paradise of modern novels and the isle of Camoens are assignificant culturally as any of the isles of medieval literature.In other words man, whatever else he may be free of, is forever the prisoner ofhis own archetypal intuitions, formed at the moment when he first perceived hisposition in the cosmos. The longing for Paradise can be traced even in the mostbanal actions of the modern man. Man's concept of the absolute can never becompletely uprooted: it can only be debased. And primitive spirituality lives onin its own way not in action, not as a thing man can effectively accomplish, butas a nostalgia which creates things that become values in themselves: art, thesciences, social theory, and all the other things to which men will give thewhole of themselves.NOTESGuide to PronunciationSanskrit vowels are pronounced very much like Italian vowels, with the exceptionof the short a which is pronounced like the u in the English word 'but'; long ais pronounced like the a in 'father'. As for the consonants, a reasonableapproximation will be obtained by pronouncing c as in 'church', j as in'jungle', s as in 'shun', s as in 'sun', and s as something half-way between theother two s's. The aspirated consonants should be pronounced distinctly: th asin goat-herd, ph as in top-hat, gh as in dog-house, dh as in mad-house, bh as incab-horse, r is a vowel, pronounced mid-way between 'ri' as in 'rivet' and er'as in 'father'.Unit IIn the Beginning: Origins of Man and MythThe Moon and Its MystiqueMIRCEA ELIADEIn this selection Mircea Eliade identifies the mythic patterns associated withlunar symbolism, rain, fertility, the feminine, the serpent, death, andregeneration. He shows that these symbols have meaning only as parts of thepattern in which they exist, thus demonstrating to the reader that both thesymbols and the 7nyths are transformed through time. Eliades distinction betweenmasculine and feminine principles is basic to understanding myths throughmetaphor.THE MOON AND TIME1 he sun is always the same, always itself, never in any sense \"be- *^ coming.\"The moon, on the other hand, is a body which waxes, wanes and disappears, a bodywhose existence is subject to the universal law of becoming, of birth and death.The moon, like man, has a career involving tragedy, for its failing, like man's,ends in death. For three nights the starry sky is without a moon. But this\"death\" is followed by a rebirth: the \"new moon.\" The moon's going out, in\"death,\" is never final. One Babylonian hymn to Sin sees the moon as \"a fruitgrowing from itself.\" It is reborn of its own substance, in pursuance of its owndestined career.This perpetual return to its beginnings, and this ever-recurring cycle make themoon the heavenly body above all other s concern ed with the rhythms of life. Itis not surprising, then, that it governs all those spheres oi nature that fallunder the law of recurring cycles: waters, rain, plant life, fertility. Thephases of the moon showed man time in the concrete sense—as distinct fromastronomical time which certainly only came to be realized later. Even in theIce Age the meaning of the moon's phases and their magic powers were clearlyknown. We find the symbolism of spira ls, snakes and lightning—all of themgrowing ou t of the notion o f the moon as the measure of rhythmic change andfertility— TnTfie^^ Siberian cultures of the Ice Age. Time was quite certainlymeasured everywhere by the phases of the moon. Even to-day there are nomadtribes living off what they can hunt and grow who use only the lunar calendar.The oldest Indo-Aryan root connected with the heavenly bodies is the one thatmeans \"moon\": it is the root me, which in Sanskrit becomes mami, \"I measure.\"The moon becomes the universal measuring gauge. All the words relating to themoon in the Indo-European languages comefrom that root: mas (Sanskrit), mah(Avestic), mah (Old Prussian), menu (Lithuanian), mena (Gothic), mene (Greek),mensis (Latin). The Germans used to measure time by nights. Traces of thisancient way of reckoning are also preserved in popular European traditions;certain feasts are celebrated at night as, for instance, Christmas night,Easter, Pentecost, Saint John's Day and so on.Time as governed and measured by the phases of the moon might be called \"living\"time. It is bound up with the reality of life and nature, rain and the tides,the time of sowing, the menstrual cvcle. A whole series of phenomena belongingto totally flitifcrent \"rn<;mir levpls\" a re ordered according, to the rhythmsof rh p moon^or are under their influence. The \"primitive mind,\" once havinggrasped the \"powers\" of the moon, then establishes connections of response andeven interchange between the moon and those phenomena. Thus, for instance, fromthe earliest times, certainly since the Neolithic Age, with the discovery ofagriculture, the same symbolism has linked together the moon, the sea waters,rain, the fertility of women and of animals, plant life, man's destiny afterdeath and the ceremonies of initiation. The mental syntheses made possible bythe realization of the moon's rhythms connect and unify very varied realities;their structural symmetries and the analogies in their workings could never havebeen seen had not \"primitive\" man intuitively perceived the moon's law ofperiodic change, as he did very early on.The moon measures, but it also unifies. Its \"forces\" or rhythms are what one maycall the \"lowest common denominator\" of an endless number of phenomena andsymbols. The whole universe is seen as a pattern, subject to certain laws. Theworld is no longer an infinite space filled with the activity of a lot ofdisconnected autonomous creatures: within that space itself things can be seento correspond and fit together. All this, of course, is not the result of areasoned analysis of reality, but of an ever clearer intuition of it in itstotality. Though there may be a series of ritual or mythical side-commentarieson the moon which are separate from the rest, with their own somewhatspecialized function (as, for instance, certain mythical lunar beings with onlyone foot or one hand, by whose magic power one can cause rain to fall), therecan be no symbol, ritual or myth of the moon that does not imply all the lunarvalues known at a given time. There can be no part without the whole. Thespiral, for instance, which was taken to be a symbol of the moon as early as theIce Age, relates to the phases of the moon, but also includes erotic elementsspringing from the vulva-shell analogy, water elements (the moon = shell), andsome to do with fertility (the double volute, horns and so on). By wearing apearl as an amulet a woman is united to the powers of water (shell), the moon(the shell a symbol of the moon; created by the rays of the moon, etc.),eroticism, birth and embryology. A medicinal plant contains in itself thethreefold effectiveness of the moon, the waters and vegetation, even when onlyone of these powers is explicitly present in the mind of the user. Each of thesepowers or \"effectivenesses\" in its turn works on a number of different levels.Vegetation, for instance, implies notions of death and rebirth, of light anddarkness (as zones of the universe), of fecundity and abundance, and so on.There is no such thing as a symbol, emblem or power with only one kind ofmeaning. Everything hangs together, everything is connected, and makes up acosmic whole.THE COHERENCE OF ALL LUNAR EPIPHANIESSuch a whole could certainly never be grasped by any mind accustomed toproceeding analytically. And even by intuition modern man cannot get hold of allthe wealth of meaning and harmony that such a cosmic reality (or, in fact,sacred reality) involves in the primitive mind. To the primitive, a lunarsymbol, (anamulet or iconographic sign) does not merely contain in itself all the lunarforces at work on every level of the cosmos—but actually, by the power of theritual involved, places the wearer himself at the centre of those forces,increasing his vitality, making him more real, and guaranteeing him a happierstate after death. It is important to keep stressing this fact that everyreligious act (that is, every act with a meaning) performed by primitive man hasa character of totality, for there is always a danger of our looking upon thefunctions, powers and attributes of the moon as we discuss them in this chapterin an analytic and cumulative manner. We tend to divide what is and must remaina whole. Where we use the words \"because,\" and \"therefore,\" the mind of theprimitive man would phrase it perhaps as \"in the same way\" (for instance, I say:because the moon governs the waters, plants are subject to it, but it would bemore correct to say: plants and the waters are subject to it in the same way . ..).The \"powers\" of the moon are to be discovered not by means of a succession ofanalytical exercises, but by intuition; it reveals itself more and more fully.The analogies formed in the primitive mind are as it were orchestrated there bymeans of symbols; for instance, the moon appears and disappears; the snail showsand withdraws its horns; the bear appears and disappears with the seasons; thus,the snail becomes the scene of a lunar theophany, as in the ancient religion ofMexico in which the moon god, Tecciztecatl, is shown enclosed in a snail'sshell; it also becomes an amulet, and so on. The bear becomes the ancestor ofthe human race, for man, whose life is similar to that of the moon, must havebeen created out of the very substance or by the magic power of that orb ofliving reality.The symbols which get their meaning from the moon are at the same time the moon.The spiral is both a lunar hierophany—expressing the light-darkness cycle—and asign by which man can absorb the moon's powers into himself. Lightning, too, isa kratophany of the moon, for its brightness recalls that of the moon, and itheralds rain, which is governed by the moon. All these symbols, hierophanies,myths, rituals, amulets and the rest, which I call lunar to give them oneconvenient name, form a whole in the mind of the primitive; they are boundtogether by harmonies, analogies, and elements held in common, like one greatcosmic \"net,\" a vast web in which every piece fits and nothing is isolated fromthe rest. If you want to express the multiplicity of lunar hierophanies in asingle formula, you may say that they reveal life repeating itself rhythmically.All the values of the moon, whether cosmological, magic or religious, areexplained by its modality of being: by the fact that it is \"living,\" andinexhaustible in its own regeneration. In the primitive mind, the intuition ofthe cosmic destiny of the moon was equivalent to the first step, the foundationof an anthropology. Man saw himself reflected in the \"life\" of the moon; notsimply because his own life came to an end, like that of all organisms, butbecause his own thirst for regeneration, his hopes of a \"rebirth,\" gainedconfirmation from the fact of there being always a new moon.It does not matter to us a great deal whether, in the innumerable beliefscentring upon the moon, we are dealing with adoration of the moon itself, of adivinity inhabiting it, or of a mythical personification of it. Nowhere in thehis-tory of religions do we find an adoration of any natural object in itself. Asacred thing, whatever its form and substance, is sacred because it reveals orshares in ultimate reality. Every religious object is always an \"incarnation\" ofsomething: of the sacred. It incarnates it by the quality of its being (as forinstance, the sky, the sun, the moon or the earth), or by its form (that is,symbolically: as with the spiral-snail), or by a hierophany (a certain place, acertain stone, etc. becomes sacred; a certain object is \"sanctified\" or\"consecrated\" by a ritual, or by contact with another sacred object or person,and so on).Consequently, the moon is no more adored in itself than any other object, but inwhat it reveals of the sacred, that is, in the power centred in it, in theinexhaustible life and reality that it manifests. The sacred reality of the moonwas recognized either immediately, in the lunar hierophany itself, or in theforms created by that hierophany over the course of thousands of years—that isin the representations to which it had given birth: personifications, symbols ormyths. The differences between these various forms are not the concern of thischapter. After all, what we are seeking here is mainly to explain the hierophanyof the moon and all that it involves. There is no need even to confine ourselvesto evidence that is obviously \"sacred,\" lunar gods, for example, and the ritualsand myths consecrated to them. To the primitive mind, I repeat, everything thathad a meaning, everything connected with absolute reality, had sacred value. Wecan observe the religious character of the moon with as much precision in thesymbolism of the pearl or of the lightning as we can by studying a lunardivinity like the Babylonian Sin or the goddess Hecate.THE MOON AND THE WATERSBoth because they are sub j ect to rhythms (rain and tides), and because thevsponsor the growth of living things, waters are subject to thejn oxui- \"The moonis in the waters ' and \"rain comes from the moon\"; those are two leitmotiven inIndian thought. Apam napat, \"the son of water,\" was in primitive times the nameof a spirit of vegetation, but was later applied also to the moon and to thenectar of the moon, soma. Ardvisura Anahita, the Iranian goddess of water, was alunar being; Sin, the Babylonian moon god, also governed the waters. One hymnbrings out how fruitful his theophany is: \"When thou floatest like a boat on thewaters . . . the pure river Euphrates is filled with water to the full. . . .\"One text of the \"Langdon Epic\" speaks of the place \"whence the waters flow fromtheir source, from the moon's reservoir.\"All the moon divinities preserve more or less obvious water attributes orfunctions. To certain American Indian tribes, the moon, or the moon god, is atthe same time the god of water. (This is true in Mexico, and among the Iroquois,to name two instances.) One tribe in central Brazil call the moon-god's daughter\"Mother of the Waters.\" Hieronymo de Chaves said (in 1576), speaking of ancientMexican beliefs concerning the moon, \"the moon makes all things grow andmultiply . . .\" and \"all moisture is governed by it.\" The link between the moonand the tides which both the Greeks and the Celts observed, was also knownK^<&\\S*>picture2 [images/picture2.jpg]to the Maoris of New Zealand and the Eskimos (whose moon divinities govern thetides).From the earliest times it was recognized that rainfall followed the phases ofthe moon. A whole series of mythical characters, belonging to cultures as variedas the Bushman, Mexican, Australian, Samoyed and Chinese, were marked by theirpower to cause rain and by having only one foot or only one hand. Hentzeestablishes quite fully that they are lunar in essence. And, too, there arenumerous moon symbols in all images of them, and all their various rites andmyths have a definite lunar character. While the waters and the rain aregoverned by the moon, and normally follow a fixed order—that is, they follow thephases of the moon—all disasters connected with them, on the other hand, displaythe moon's other aspect, as the periodic destroyer of outworn \"forms\" and, wemay say, of effecting regeneration on the cosmic scale.Flood corresponds to the three days of darkness, or \"death,\" of the moon. It isa cataclysm, but never a final one, for it takes place under the seal of themoon and the waters, which are pre-eminently the sign of growth andregeneration. A flood destroys simply because the \"forms\" are old and worn out,but it is always followed by a new humanity and a new history. The vast majorityof deluge myths tell how a single individual survived, and how the new race wasdescended from him. This survivor—man or woman—occasionally marries a lunaranimal, which thus becomes ancestor to the race. So, for instance, one Dyaklegend tells how a woman was the only survivor of a flood which followed uponthe slaying of an immense boa constrictor, a \"lunar animal,\" and gave birth to anew humanity by mating with a dog (or, in some variants, with a stick forfiring, found next to a dog).Of the numerous variants on the Deluge myth we will look at one—an Australianversion (that of the Kurnai tribe). One day all the waters were swallowed by animmense frog, Dak. In vain the parched animals tried to make her laugh. Notuntil the eel (or serpent) began to roll about and twist itself round did Dakburst out laughing, and the waters thus rushed out and produced the flood. Thefrog is a lunar animal, for a great many legends speak of a frog to be seen inthe moon and it is always present in the innumerable rites for inducing rain.Father Schmidt explains the Australian myth by the fact that the new moon haltsthe flow of the waters (Dak swallowing them). And Winthuis, who disagrees withSchmidt's interpretation, discerns an erotic meaning in this frog myth; but thatwould not, of course, disprove its lunar nature, nor the anthropogonic functionof the deluge (which \"creates\" a new, regenerated, humanity).Again in Australia we find another variant on the watery disaster produced bythe moon. The moon asked man one day for some oppossum skins to wear at night asit was cold, and man refused; to avenge itself, the moon caused torrents of rainto fall and flood the whole area. The Mexicans also believed that the mooncaused the disaster, but under the guise of a young and beautiful woman.However, there is one thing to note with all these catastrophes induced by themoon (most of them provoked by some insult paid to it, or by ignorance of someritual prohibition—that is, by a \"sin\" indicating that man is backslidingspiritually, abandoning law and order, putting the rhythms of nature out ofjoint): and thatis the myth of regeneration, and the appearance of a \"new man.\" This myth fitsin perfectly, as we shall see, with the redemptive functions of the moon and thewaters.THE MOON AND VEGETATIONThat there was a connection between the moon, rain and plant life was realizedbefore the discovery of agriculture. The plant world comes from the same sou rceof univprsal fe rtility, and is subject to the same recurring cycles governedhythp mnrm'c rr^ yements^ Qne Iranian text says that plants grow by its warmth.Some tribes in Brazil call it \"mother of grasses\" and in a great many places(Polynesia, Moluccas, Melanesia, China, Sweden, etc.) it is thought that grassgrows on the moon. French peasants, even today, sow at the time of the new moon;but they prune their trees and pick their vegetables when the moon is on thewane, presumably in order not to go against the rhythm of nature by damaging aliving organism when nature's forces are on the upward swing.The organic connection between the moon and vegetation is so strong that a verylarge number of fertility gods are also divinities of the moon; for instance theEgyptian Hathor, Ishtar the Iranian Anaitis, and so on. In almost all the godsof vegetation and fecundity there persist lunar attributes or powers—even whentheir divine \"form\" has become completely autonomous. Sin is also the creator ofthe grasses; Dionysos is both moon-god and god of vegetation; Osiris possessesall these attributes—moon, water, plant life and agriculture. We can discern themoon-water-vegetation pattern particularly clearly in the religious nature ofcertain beverages of divine origin, such as the Indian soma, and the Iranianhaoma; these were even personified into divinities—autonomous, though lessimportant than the major gods of the Indo-Iranian pantheon. And in this divineliquor which confers immortality on all who drink it, we can recognize thesacredness that centres round the moon, water and vegetation. It is supremelythe \"divine substance,\" for it transmutes life into absolute reality—orimmortality. Amrta, ambrosia, soma, haoma and the rest all have a celestialprototype drunk only by gods and heroes, but there is a similar power in earthlydrinks too—in the soma the Indians drank in Vedic times, in the wine of theDionysiac orgies. Furthermore, these earthly drinks owe their potency to theircorresponding celestial prototype. Sacred inebriation makes it possible toshare—though fleetingly and imperfectly—in the divine mode of being; itachieves, in fact, the paradox of at once possessing the fulness of existence,and becoming; of being at once dynamic and static. The metaphysical role of themoon is to live and yet remain immortal, to undergo death, but as a rest andregeneration, never as a conclusion. This is the destiny which man is trying toconquer for himself in all the rites, symbols and myths—rites, symbols and mythsin which, as we have seen, the sacred values of the moon exist together withthose of water and of vegetation, whether the latter derive their sacrednessfrom the moon, or constitute autonomous hierophanies. In either case we arefaced with an ultimate reality, a source of power and of life from which allliving forms spring, either of its substance, or as a result of its blessing.The connections seen between the different cosmic levels that the moongoverns—rain, plant life, animal and human fecundity, the souls of the dead—enter into even as primitive a religion as that of the Pygmies of Africa. Theirfeast of the new moon takes place a little before the rainy season. The moon,which they call Pe, is held to be the \"principle of generation, and the motherof fecundity.\" The feast of the new moon is reserved exclusively for the women,just as the feast of the sun is celebrated exclusively by the men. Because themoon is both \"mother and the refuge of ghosts\" the women honour it by smearingthemselves with clay and vegetable juices, thus becoming white like ghosts andmoonlight. The ritual consists in preparing an alcoholic liquid from fermentedbananas, which the women drink when they are wearied by their dancing, and ofdances and prayers addressed to the moon. The men do not dance, nor evenaccompany the ritual on their tom-toms. The moon, \"mother of living things,\" isasked to keep away the souls of the dead and to bring fertility, to give thetribe a lot of children, and fish, game and fruit.THE MOON AND FERTILITYThe fertility of animals, as well as that of plants, is subject to the moon. Therelationship between the moon and fecundity occasionally becomes somewhatcomplicated owing to the appearance of new religious \"forms\"—like theEarth-Mother, and the various agricultural divinities. However, there is oneaspect of the moon that remains permanently evident, however many religioussyntheses have gone towards making up these new \"forms;\" and that is theprerogative of fertility, of recurring creation, of inexhaustible life. Thehorns of oxen, for instance, which are used to characterize the great divinitiesof fecundity, are an emblem of the divine Magna Mater. Wherever they are to befound in Neolithic cultures, either in iconography, or as part of idols in theform of oxen, they denote the presence of the Great Goddess of fertility. And ahorn is always the image of the new moon: \"Clearly the ox's horn became a symbolof the moon because it brings to mind a crescent; therefore both horns togetherrepresent two crescents, or the complete career of the moon.\" And also in theiconography of the prehistoric Chinese cultures of Kansu and Yang-kao you willoften find symbols of the moon and symbols of fertility together—stylized hornsare framed by a pattern of lightning-flashes (signifying the rain and the moon)and lozenges (which are a symbol of femininity).Certain animals become symbols of even \"presences\" of the moon because theirshape or their behaviour is reminiscent of the moon's. So with the snail whichgoes in and out of its shell; the bear, which disappears in midwinter andreappears in the spring; the frog because it swells up, submerges itself, andlater returns to the surface of the water; the dog, because it can be seen inthe moon, or because it is supposed in some myths to be the ancestor of therace; the snake, because it appears and disappears, and because it has as manycoils as the moon has days (this legend is also preserved in Greek tradition);or because it is \"the husband of all women,\" or because it sloughs its skin(that is to say, is periodically reborn, is \"immortal\"), and so on. Thesymbolism of the snake is somewhatconfusing, but all the symbols are directed to the same central idea: i t isimmortal because it is continually reborn, and therefore it is a moon \"for ^p, \"and a<; ^ r-h can bestow fecundity, knowledge (that is. prophecy) and evenimmortality. There are innumerable myths telling the disastrous story of how theserpent stole the immortality given to man by his god. But they are all latervariants on a primitive myth in which the serpent (or a sea monster) guarded thesacred spring and the spring of immortality (the Tree of Life, the Fountain ofYouth, the Golden Apples).I can only mention here a few of the myths and symbols connected with theserpent, and only those which indicate its character of a lunar animal. In thefirst ^L (_ ^ place, its connection with women and with fecundity: the moon isthe source of ^ all fertility, and also governs the menstrual cycle. It ispersonified as \"the master CA^ /v|ic of women.\" A great many peoples used tothink—and some think it to this day— |fnP \\^ that the moon, in the form of aman, or a serpent, copulates with their women. That is why, among the Eskimosfor instance, unmarried girls will not look at the moon for fear of becomingpregnant. The Australians believe that the moon comes down to earth in the formof a sort of Don Juan, makes women pregnant and then deserts them. This myth isstill current in India.Since the serpent is an epiphany of the moon, it fulfills the same function.Even today it is said in the Abruzzi that the serpent copulates with all women.The Greeks and Romans also believed it. Alexander the Great's mother, Olym-pia,played with snakes. The famous Aratus of Sicyon was said to be a son ofAesculapius because, according to Pausanias, his mother had conceived him of aserpent. Suetonius and Dio Cassius tell how the mother of Augustus conceivedfrom the embrace of a serpent in Apollo's temple. A similar legend was currentabout the elder Scipio. In Germany, France, Portugal, and elsewhere, women usedto be afraid that a snake would slip into their mouths when they were asleep,and they would become pregnant, particularly during menstruation. In India, whenwomen wanted to have children, they adored a cobra. All over the East it wasbelieved that woman's first sexual contact was with a snake, at puberty orduring menstruation. The Komati tribe in the Mysore province of India use snakesmade of stones in a rite to bring about the fertility of the women. ClaudiusAelianus declares that the Hebrews believed that snakes mated with unmarriedgirls; and we also find this belief in Japan. A Persian tradition says thatafter the first woman had been seduced by the serpent, she immediately began tomenstruate. And it was said by the rabbis that menstruation was the result ofEve's relations with the serpent in the Garden of Eden. In Abyssinia it wasthought that girls were in danger of being raped by snakes until they weremarried. One Algerian story tells how a snake escaped when no one was lookingand raped all the unmarried girls in a house. Similar traditions are to be foundamong the Mandi Hottentots of East Africa, in Sierra Leone and elsewhere.Certainly the menstrual cycle helps to explain the spread of the belief that themoon is the first mate of all women. The Papoos thought menstruation was a proofthat women and girls were connected with the moon, but in their iconography(sculptures on wood) they pictured reptiles emerging from their genital organs,which confirms that snakes and the moon are identified. Among the Chiriguanoes,various fumigations and purifications are performed after awoman's first menstrual period, and after that the women of the house drive awayevery snake they come upon, as responsible for this evil.^Tgffcat many tribeslook upon the snake as the cause of the menstrual cycle. Itslphallic Character,which Crawley was one of the first ethnologists to demonstsaj^far from excludingits connection with the moon, only confirms it. A great deal of theiconographical documentation which remains—both of the Neolithic civilizationsof Asia (such as the idol of the Panchan culture, at Kansu, and the sculpturedgold of Ngan-Yang) and of the Amerindian civilizations (such as the bronze discsof Calchaqui)—show the double imagery of the snake decorated with lozenges(symbolizing the vulva). The two together undoubtedly have an erotic meaning,but the coexistence of the snake (phallus) and lozenges also expresses an ideaof dualism and reintegration which is a supremely lunar notion, for we find thatsame motif in the lunar imagery of \"rain,\" of \"light and darkness,\" and therest.THE MOON, WOMAN, AND SNAKESThe moon then can also be personified as reptile and masculine, but suchpersonifications (which often break away from the original pattern and follow apath of their own in myth and legend), are still fundamentally based on thenotion of the moon as source of living reality, and basis of all fertility andperiodic regeneration. Snakes are thought of as producing children; inGuatemala, for instance, in the Urabunna tribe of central Australia (who believethemselves to be descended from two snakes which travelled about the world andleft maiaurli, or \"the souls of children\" wherever they stopped), among theTogos in Africa (a giant snake dwells in a pool near the town of Klewe, andreceiving children from the hands of the supreme god Namu, brings them into thetown before their birth). In India, from Buddhist times (cf the Jatakas), snakeswere held to be the givers of all fertility (water, treasures). Some of theNagpur paintings depict the mating of women with cobras. A mass of beliefs inpresent day India evince the beneficent and fertilizing power of snakes: theyprevent women from being sterile and ensure that they will have a large numberof children.There are a great many different woman-snake relationships, but none of them canbe fully explained by any purely erotic symbolism. The snake has a variety ofmeanings, and I think we must hold its \"regeneration\" to be one of the mostimportant. The snake is an animal that \"changes.\" Gressman tried to see in Eve aprimitive Phoenician goddess of the underworld, personified by a snake. TheMediterranean deities are represented with snakes in their hands (the ArcadianArtemis, Hecate, Persephone, and so on), or with snakes for hair (the Gorgon,Erinyes and others). And there are some central European superstitions to theeffect that if, when a woman is under the moon's influence (that is, when she ismenstruating), you pull out some of her hair and bury it, the hairs will turninto snakes.One Breton legend says the hair of a witch turns into snakes. This cannottherefore happen to ordinary women, except when under the influence of themoon, when sharing in the magic power of \"change.\" There is a great deal ofethnological evidence to show that witchcraft is a thing bestowed by the moon(either directly, or through the intermediary of snakes). To the Chinese, forinstance, snakes are at the bottom of all magic power, while the Hebrew andArabic words for magic come from words that mean \"snakes.\" Because snakes are\"lunar\"—that is, eternal—and live underground, embodying (among many otherthings) the souls of the dead, they know all secrets, are the source of allwisdom, and can foresee the future. Anyone, therefore, who eats a snake becomesconversant with the language of animals, and particularly of birds (a symbolwhich can also have a metaphysical meaning: access to the transcendent reality);this is a belief held by a tremendous number of races, and it was accepted evenby the learned of antiquity.The same central symbolism of fertility and regeneration governed by the moon,and bestowed by the moon itself or by forms the same in substance (magna mater,terra mater) explains the presence of snakes in the imagery and rites of theGreat Goddesses of universal fertility. As an attribute of the Great Goddess,the snake keeps its lunar character (of periodic regeneration) in addition to atelluric one. At one stage the moon was identified with the earth and itselfconsidered the origin of all living forms. Some races even believe that theearth and the moon are formed of the same substance. The Great Goddesses shareas much in the sacred nature of the moon as in that of the earth. And becausethese goddesses are also funeral goddesses (the dead disappear into the groundor into the moon to be reborn and reappear under new forms), the snake becomesvery specially the animal of death and burial, embodying the souls of the dead,the ancestor of the tribe, etc. And this symbolism of regeneration also explainsthe presence of snakes in initiation ceremonies.LUNAR SYMBOLISMWhat emerges fairly clearly from all this varied symbolism of snakes isJii eij:l unar chara cter—that is^thei rpowers of fertility, of regeneration^oLimmortality, through metamorphosis. We could, of course, look at a series oftheir attributes or functions and conclude that all these various relationshipsand significations have developed one from another by some method of logicalanalysis. You can reduce any religious system to nothing by methodicallybreaking it down to its component parts and studying them. In reality, all themeanings in a symbol are present together, even when it may look as if only someof them are effective. The intuition of the moon as the measure of rhythms, asthe source of energy, of life, and of rebirth, has woven a sort of web betweenthe various levels of the universe, producing parallels, similarities andunities among vastly differing kinds of phenomena. It is not always easy to findthe centre of such a \"web;\" secondary centres will sometimes stand out, lookinglike the most important, or perhaps the oldest starting point. Thus the eroticsymbolism of snakes has in its turn \"woven\" a system of meanings andassociations which in some cases at least push its lunar connections into thebackground. What in fact we are faced with isa series of threads running parallel to or across each other, all fittingtogether, some connected directly with the \"centre\" on which they all depend,others developing within their own systems.Thus the whole pattern ismoon-rain-fertility-woman-serpent-death-periodic-regeneration, but we may bedealing with one of the patterns within a pattern such asSerpent-Woman-Fertility, or Serpent-Rain-Fertility, or perhapsWoman-Serpent-Magic, and so on. A lot of mythology has grown up around thesesecondary \"centres,\" and if one does not realize this, it may overshadow theoriginal pattern, though that pattern is, in fact, fully implicated in even thetiniest fragments. So, for instance, in the snake-water (or rain) binomial, thefact that both these are subject to the moon is not always obvious. Innumerablelegends and myths show snakes or dragons governing the clouds, dwelling in poolsand keeping the world supplied with water, f he link between snakes and springsand streams has been kept to this day in the popular beliefs of Europe. InAmerican Indian iconography, the serpent-water connection is very often found;for instance, the Mexican rain-god, Tlaloc, is represented by an emblem of twosnakes twisted together; in the same Borgia Codex a snake wounded by an arrowmeans rainfall; the Dresden Codex shows water in a vessel shaped like a reptile;the Codex-Tro-Cortesianus shows water flowing from a vase in the shape of asnake, and there are many more examples.Hentze's researches have quite conclusively proved that this symbolism is basedon the fact that the moon supplies the rains. Sometimes the Moon-Snake-Rainpattern has even been kept in the ritual: in India, for instance, the annualceremony of venerating the snake (sarpabali), as it is given in the Grhyasutras,lasts for four months; it starts at the full moon in Sravana (the first month ofthe rainy season) and finishes at the full moon in Margasirsa (the first monthof winter). The sarpabali thus includes all three elements of the originalpattern. Yet it is not quite right to think of them as three separate elements:it is a triple repetition, a \"concentration\" of the moon, for the rain and thesnakes are not merely things that follow the rhythms of the moon, but are infact of the same substance. Like every sacred thing, and every symbol, thesewaters and snakes achieve that paradox of being at once themselves and somethingother —in this case the moon.THE MOON AND DEATHAs E. Seler, the student of Americana, wrote long ago, the moon is the firs t ofthe dead.. For three nights the sky is dark; but as the moon is reborn on thefourth night, so shall the dead achieve a new sort of existence. Death, as weshall see later, is not an extinction, but a change—and generally a provisionalone—of one's level of existence. Death belongs to another kind of \"life.\" Andbecause what happens to the moon, and to the earth (for as people discovered theagricultural cycle they came to see the Earth as related to the Moon) provesthat there is a \"life in death\" and gives the idea meaning, the dead either goto the moon or return to the underworld to be regenerated and to absorb theforces needed to start a new existence. That is why so many lunar divinities arein addition chthonian and funereal divinities (Min, Persephone, probably Hermes,and so on). And why, too, so many beliefs see the moon as the land of the dead.Sometimes the privilege of repose on the moon after death is reserved topolitical or religious leaders; that is what the Guaycurus believe, and thePolynesians of Tokelau and others. This is one of those aristocratic, or heroicsystems, which concede immortality only to the privileged rulers or theinitiated (\"magicians\"), which we also find elsewhere.This journey to the moon after death was also preserved in highly developedcultures (India, Greece, Iran), but something else was added. To the Indians, itis the \"path of the manes\" (pitrydna), and souls reposed in the moon whileawaiting reincarnation, whereas the sun road or \"path of the gods\" (devaydna)was taken by the initiated, or those set free from the illusions of ignorance.In Iranian tradition, the souls of the dead, having passed the Cinvat bridge,went towards the stars, and if they had been good they went to the moon and theninto the sun, and the most virtuous of all entered the garotman, the infinitelight of Ahura Mazda. The same belief was kept in Manicheeism and existed in theEast as well. Pythagorism gave astral theology a further impulse by popularizingthe idea of the empyrean: the Elysian Fields, where heroes and Caesars wentafter death, were in the moon. The \"Isles of the Blessed,\" and all the mythicalgeography of death, were set in the sky utilizing the moon, the sun, the MilkyWay. Here, of course, we have clearly got formulae and cults impregnated withastronomical speculation and eschatological gnosis. But even in such latedevelopments as that it is not hard to identify the traditional key ideas: themoon as land of the dead, the moon as receiver and regenerator of souls.The lunar sphere was only one stage in an ascension including several others(the sun, the Milky Way, the \"outer sphere\"). The soul rested in the moon, butas in the Upanisad tradition, only to await reincarnation, and a return to theround of life. That is why the moon has the chief place in forming organisms,but also in breaking them apart: \"Omnia animantium corpora et concepta procreatet generata dissolvit.\" Its task is to \"reabsorb\" forms and recreate them. Onlywhat is beyond the moon is beyond becoming: \"Supra lunam sunt aeterna omnia.\" ToPlutarch, who believed man to be made up of three parts, body (soma), soul(psyche), and mind (nous), this meant that the souls of the just were purifiedin the moon while their bodies were given back to the earth and their minds tothe sun.To the duality of soul and mind correspond the two different itineraries afterdeath to the moon and sun, rather like the Upanisad tradition of the \"path ofsouls\" and the \"path of the gods.\" The path of souls is a lunar one because the\"soul\" has not the light of reason, or in other words, because man has not cometo know the ultimate metaphysical reality: Brahman. Plutarch wrote that man hadtwo deaths: the first took place on earth, in the domain of Demeter, when thebody became cut off from the psyche and the nous and returned to dust (which iswhy the Athenians called the dead demetreioi); the second takes place in themoon, in the domain of Persephone, when the psyche separates from the nous andreturns into the moon's substance. The soul, or psyche, remains in the moon,though holding on to dreams and memories of life for some time. The righteousare soon reabsorbed; the souls which have been ambitious, self-willed, or toofond of their own bodies are constantly drawn towards earth and it is a longtime before they can be reabsorbed. The nous is drawn towards the sun, whichreceives it, to whose substance it corresponds. The process of birth is theexact reverse: the moon receives sun from the nous, and, coming to fruitionthere, it gives birth to a new soul. The earth furnishes the body. Note thesymbolism of the moon rendered fertile by the sun, and its relation to theregeneration of the nous and psyche, the first integration of the humanpersonality.Cumont thinks that the dividing of the mind into nous and psyche comes from theEast and is Semitic in nature, and he reminds us that the Jews believed in a\"vegetative soul\" (nephesh), which continued to dwell on earth for some time anda \"spiritual soul\" (ruah) which departed from the body immediately after death.He finds a confirmation of his theory in eastern theology as it becamepopularized under the Roman Empire, which describes the influences exercised bythe layers of atmosphere, the sun and the moon on a soul coming down from theempyrean to the earth. It may be objected to this hypothesis that this dualityin the soul and its destiny after death is to be found, in embryo at least, inthe oldest Hellenic traditions. Plato held both the duality of the soul (Phaedo)and its separation later into three. With regard to the astral eschatology, thesuccessive journeys of nous and psyche and its elements from moon to sun andback cannot be found in the Timaeus, and probably comes from some Semiticinfluence. But what we are specially concerned with at the moment is theconception of the moon as the dwelling-place of the souls of the dead, which wefind expressed iconographically in the carvings of the Assyrians andBabylonians, the Phoenicians, the Hittites and the Anatolians, and which waslater used in funeral monuments all over the Roman Empire. Everywhere in Europethe half-moon is to be found as a funeral symbol. This does not mean that itcame in with the Roman and Eastern religions fashionable under the Empire; forin Gaul for instance, the moon was a local symbol in use long before any contactwith the Romans. The \"fashion\" merely brought primitive notions up to date byformulating in new language a tradition older than history.THE MOON AND INITIATIONDeath, however, is not final—for the moon's death is not. \"As the moon dieth andcometh to life again, so we also, having to die, will again rise,\" declare theJuan Capistrano Indians of California in ceremonies performed when the moon isnew. A mass of myths describe a \"message\" given to men by the moon through theintermediary of an animal (hare, dog, lizard or another) in which it promisesthat \"as I die and rise to life again, so you shall also die and rise to lifeagain.\" From either ignorance or ill-will, the \"messenger\" conveys the exactopposite, and declares that man, unlike the moon, will never live again once heis dead. This myth is extremely common in Africa, but it is also tp be found inFiji, Australia, among the Ainus and elsewhere. It justifies the concrete factthat man dies, as well as the existence of initiation ceremonies. Even withinthe framework of Christian apologetics, the phases of the moon provide a goodexemplar for our belief in resurrection. \"Luna per omnes menses nascitur,crescit, perficitur, minuitur, consumitur, innovatur,\" wrote Saint Augustine.\"Quod inluna per menses, hoc in resurrectione semel in toto tempore.\" It is thereforequite easy to understand the role of the moon in initiations, which consistprecisely in undergoing a ritual death followed by a \"rebirth,\" by which theinitiate takes on his true personality as a \"new man.\"In Australian initiations, the \"dead man\" (that is, the neophyte), rises from atomb as the moon rises from darkness. Among the Koryaks of north-easternSiberia, the Gilyaks, Tlingits, Tongas and Haidas, a bear—a \"lunar animal\"because it appears and disappears with the seasons—is present in the initiationceremonies, just as it played an essential part in the ceremonies of Paleolithictimes. The Porno Indians of Northern California have their candidates initiatedby the Grizzly Bear, which \"kills\" them and \"makes a hole\" in their backs withits claws. They are undressed, then dressed in new clothes, and they then spendfour days in the forest while ritual secrets are revealed to them. Even when nolunar animals appear in the rites and no direct reference is made to thedisappearance and reappearance of the moon, we are driven to connect all thevarious initiation ceremonies with the lunar myth throughout the area ofsouthern Asia and the Pacific, as Gahs has shown in a yet unpublished monograph.In certain of the shaman initiation ceremonies, the candidate is \"broken inpieces\" just as the moon is divided into parts (innumerable myths represent thestory of the moon being broken or pulverized by God, by the sun and so on). Wefind the same archetypal model in the osirian initiations. According to thetradition recorded by Plutarch, Osiris ruled for twenty-eight years and waskilled on the seventeenth of the month, when the moon was on the wane. Thecoffin in which Isis had hidden him was discovered by Set when he was hunting bymoonlight; Set divided Osiris' body into fourteen and scattered the piecesthroughout Egypt. The ritual emblem of the dead god is in the shape of the newmoon. There is clearly an analogy between death and initiation. \"That is why,\"Plutarch tells us, \"there is such a close analogy between the Greek words fordying and initiating. If mystical initiation is achieved through a ritual death,then death can be looked upon as an initiation. Plutarch calls the souls thatattain to the upper part of the moon \"victorious,\" and they wear the same crownon their heads as the initiate and the triumphant.THE SYMBOLISM OF LUNAR \"BECOMING\"\"Becoming\" is the luna r nrqW of things. Whether it is taken as the playing-outof a drama (the birth, fulness and disappearance of the moon), or given thesense of a \"division\" or \"enumeration,\" or intuitively seen as the \"hempen rope\"of which the threads of fate are woven, depends, of course, on the myth-makingand theorizing powers of individual tribes, and their level of culture. But theformulas used to express that \"becoming\" are heterogeneous on the surface only.The moon \"divides,\" \"spins,\" and \"measures;\" or feeds, makes fruitful, andblesses: or receives th e smils of the dead, initi ates and purifies—because itis' living, and therefore in a perpetual state of rhythmic becoming This rhythmalways enters into lunar rituals. Sometimes the ceremonial will're-enact thephases of the moon as a whole, as does for instance the Indian pujd introducedbyTantrism. The goddess Tripurasundari must, says one Tantric text, be consideredas actually being in the moon. One Tantric writer, Bhaskara Raja, statesdefinitely that the goddess' puja must begin on the first day of the new moon,and last for the whole fifteen days of moonlight; this calls for sixteenBrahmans, each representing one aspect of the goddess (that is, one phase of themoon, one tithi). Tucci notes quite rightly that the presence of the Brahmanscan only be a recent innovation, and that in the primitive puja, other figuresrepresented the \"becoming\" of the moon goddess. And, indeed, in Rudrayamala, atreatise of undoubted authority, we find the description of the traditionalceremony, kumari-puja, or \"the adoration of a maiden.\" And that puja alwaysstarted at the new moon and lasted fifteen nights. But instead of the sixteenBrahmans, there must be sixteen kumarl to represent the sixteen tithi of themoon. The adoration is vrddhibhedana, that is, in order of age, and the sixteenmaidens must be aged from one to sixteen. Each evening the puja represents thecorresponding tithi of the moon. Tantric ceremonial in general gives tremendousimportance to woman and to female divinities; in this case the parallel betweenthe lunar form and the feminine is complete.That the moon \"measures\" and \"divides\" is shown by primitive classifications aswell as etymologies. In India, again, the Brhadarahyaka Upanisad says that\"Prajapati is the year. It has sixteen parts; the nights are fifteen of them,the sixteenth is fixed. It is by night that it grows and decreases\" and so on.The Chandogya Upanisad tells us that man is made up of sixteen parts and growsat the same time as food does. Traces of the octaval system abound in India:eight mala, eight murti, etc.; sixteen kala, sixteen sakti, sixteen mdtrika,etc.; thirty-two sorts of diksa, etc.; sixty-four yogini, sixty-four upacara,etc. In Vedic and Brahman literature the number four prevails. Vac (the \"logos\")is made up of four parts, purusa (\"man,\" the \"macanthrope\") also.The phases of the moon give rise to the most complex relationships in laterspeculative thought. Stuchen devoted a whole book to a study of the relationsbetween the letters of the alphabet and the phases of the moon as conceived bythe Arabs. Hommel has shown that ten or eleven Hebrew characters indicate phasesof the moon (for instance, aleph, which means \"bull\" is the symbol of the moonin its first week and also the name of the sign of the zodiac where the moon'smansions begin, and so on). Among the Babylonians, too, there is a relationshipbetween graphic signs and the phases of the moon, and among the Greeks andScandinavians (the twenty-four runes are divided into three sorts or aettir,each containing eight runes). One of the clearest and most completeassimilations of the alphabet (as a collection of sounds, that is, not aswritten) with the phases of the moon is to be found in a scholium of DionysiusThrax, in which the vowels correspond to the full moon, the hard consonants tothe half moon (the quarters), and the soft consonants to the new moon.COSMO-BIOLOGY AND MYSTICAL PHYSIOLOGYThese assimilations do not simply serve a function of classification. They areobtained by an attempt to integrate man and the universe fully into the samedivine rhythm. Their meaning is primarily magic and redemptive; by taking tohimself the powers that lie hidden in \"letters\" and \"sounds,\" man places himselfin various central points of cosmic energy and thus effects complete harmonybetween himself and all that is. \"Letters\" and \"sounds\" do the work of images,making it possible, by contemplation or by magic, to pass from one cosmic levelto another. To give only one example: in India, when a man is going to make adivine image, he must first meditate, and his meditation will include, amongothers, the following exercise (in which the moon, mystical physiology, thewritten symbol and the sound value together form a pattern of consummatesubtlety): \"Conceiving in his own heart the moon's orb as developed from theprimal sound [prathamasvara-parinatam, i.e., evolved from the letter 'A'], lethim visualize therein a beautiful blue lotus, within its filaments the moon'sunspotted orb, and thereon the yellow seed-syllable Tarn. . . .\"Clearly, man's integration into the cosmos can only take place if he can bringhimself into harmony with the two astral rhythms, \"unifying\" the sun and moon inhis living body. The \"unification\" of the two centres of sacred and naturalenergy aims—in this technique of mystical physiology—at reintegrating them inthe primal undifferentiated unity, as it was when not yet broken up by the actthat created the universe; and this \"unification\" realizes a transcendence ofthe cosmos. In one Tantric text, an exercise in mystical physiology seeks tochange \"vowels and consonants into bracelets, the sun and moon into rings.\" TheTantric and Hathayoga schools developed to a very high degree these complexanalogies between the sun, the moon and various \"mystical\" centres or arteries,divinities, blood and semen virile, etc. The point of these analogies is firstof all to unite man with the rhythms and energies of the cosmos, and then tounify the rhythms, fuse the centres and finally effect that leap into thetranscendent which is made possible when all \"forms\" disappear and the primalunity is re-established. A technique like this is of course the polished productof a long mystical tradition, but we find the rudimentary groundwork of it asoften among primitive peoples as in the syncretist periods of the Mediterraneanreligions (the moon influences the left eye and the sun the right: the moon andthe sun in funeral monuments as a symbol of eternity; and so on).By its mode of being, the moon \"binds\" together a whole mass of realities anddestinies. The rhythms of the moon weave together harmonies, symmetries,analogies and participations which make up an endless \"fabric,\" a \"net\" ofinvisible threads, which \"binds\" together at once mankind, rain, vegetation,fertility, health, animals, death, regeneration, after-life, and more. That iswhy the moon is seen in so many traditions personified by a divinity, or actingthrough a lunar animal, \"weaving\" the cosmic veil, or the destinies of men. Itwas lunar goddesses who either invented the profession of weaving (like theEgyptian divinity Neith), or were famous for their ability to weave (Athenepunished Arachne, for daring to rival her, by turning her into a spider), orwove a garment of cosmic proportions (like Proserpine and Harmonia), and so on.It was believed in medieval Europe that Holda was patroness of weavers, and wesee beyond this figure to the chthonian and lunar nature of the divinities offertility and death.We are obviously dealing here with extremely complex forms in which myths,ceremonials and symbols from different religious structures are crystallized,and they have not always come directly from the intuition of the moon asthe measure of cosmic rhythms and the support of life and death. On the otherhand, we find in them the syntheses of the moon and Mother Earth with all thatthey imply (the ambivalence of good and evil, death, fertility, destiny).Similarly, you cannot always limit every mythological intuition of a cosmic\"net\" to the moon. In Indian thought, for instance, the universe was \"woven\" bythe air just as breath (prana) \"wove\" human life. Corresponding to the fivewinds that divide the Cosmos and yet preserve its unity, there are five breaths(pranas) \"weaving\" human life into a whole (the identity of breath and wind canbe found as early as in Vedic writings). What we have got in these traditions isthe primitive conception of the living whole—whether cosmic or microcosmic—inwhich the different parts are held together by a breathing force (wind orbreath) that \"weaves\" them together.THE MOON AND FATEThe moon, however, simply because she is mistress of all living things and sureguide of the dead, has \"woven\" all destinies. Not for nothing is she envisagedin myth as an immense spider—an image you will find used by a great manypeoples. For to weave is not merely to predestine (anthropologically), and tojoin together differing realities (cosmologically) but also to create, to makesomething of one's own substance as the spider does in spinning its web. And themoon is the inexhaustible creator of all living forms. But, like everythingwoven, the lives thus created are fixed in a pattern: they have a destiny. TheMoirai, who spin fates, are lunar divinities. Homer calls them \"the spinners,\"and one of them is even called Clotho, which means \"spinner.\" They probablybegan by being goddesses at birth, but the later development of thought raisedthem to the position of personifications of fate. Yet their lunar nature wasnever totally lost to view. Porphyry said the Moirai were dependent on theforces of the moon, and an Orphic text looks on them as forming part (ta mere)of the moon. In the old Germanic languages, one of the words for fate (Old HighGerman wurt, Old Norse, urdhr, Anglo-Saxon wyrd) comes from an Indo-Europeanverb uert, \"turn,\" whence we get the Old High German words wirt, wirtel,\"spindle,\" \"distaff,\" and the Dutch worwelen, \"turn.\"Needless to say, in those cultures in which Great Goddesses have absorbed thepowers of the moon, the earth and vegetation, the spindle and distaff with whichthey spin the fates of men become two more of their many attributes. Such is thecase of the goddess with the spindle found at Troy, dating from the periodbetween 2000 and 1500 B.C. This iconographic figure is common in the East: wefind a distaff in the hand of Ishtar, of the Hittite Great Goddess, of theSyrian goddess Atargatis, of a primitive Cypriot divinity, of the goddess ofEphesus. Destiny, the thread of life, is a long or short period of time. TheGreat Goddesses consequently become mistresses of time, of the destinies theycreate according to their will. In Sanskrit Time is kdla, and the word is veryclose tb the name of the Great Goddess, Kali. (In fact, a connection has beensuggested between the two words.) Kdla also means black, darkened, stained. Timeis black because it is irrational, hard, merciless. Those who live under thedominion of time are sub-ject to every kind of suffering, and to be set free consists primarily in theabolition of time, in an escape from the law of change. Indian tradition has itthat mankind is at present in the Kdli-yuga, that is, \"the dark era,\" the periodof total confusion and utter spiritual decadence, the final stage in thecompletion of a cosmic cycle.LUNAR METAPHYSICSWe must try to get a general picture of all these lunar hierophanies. What dothey reveal? How far do they fit together and complement each other, how far dothey make up a \"theory\"—that is, express a succession of \"truths\" which, takentogether, could constitute a system? The hierophanies of the moon that we havenoted may be grouped round the following themes: (a) fertility (waters,vegetation, women; mythological \"ancestor\"); (b) periodic regeneration (thesymbolism of the serpent and all the lunar animals; \"the new man\" who hassurvived a watery catastrophe caused by the moon; the death and resurrection ofinitiations; etc.); (c) time and destiny (the moon \"measures,\" or \"weaves\"destinies, \"binds\" together diverse cosmic levels and heterogeneous realities);(d) change, marked by the opposition of light and darkness (full moon—new moon;the \"world above\" and the \"underworld;\" brothers who are enemies, good andevil), or by the balance between being and non-being, the virtual and the actual(the symbolism of hidden things: dusky night, darkness, death, seeds andlarvae). In all these themes the dominant idea is one of rhythm carried out by asuccession of contraries, of \"becoming\" through the succession of opposingmodalities (being and non-being; forms and hidden essences; life and death;etc.). It is a becoming, I need hardly add, that cannot take place without dramaor pathos; the sub-lunar world is not only the world of change but also theworld of suffering and of \"history.\" Nothing that happens in this world underthe moon can be \"eternal,\" for its law is the law of becoming, and no change isfinal; every change is merely part of a cyclic pattern."},{"pageContent":"The phases of the moon give us, if not the historical origin, at least themythological and symbolic illustration of all dualisms. \"The underworld, theworld of darkness, is typified by the waning moon (horns = crescents, the signof the double volute = two crescents facing the opposite way, placed one on topof the other and fastened together = lunar change, a decrepit and bony old man).The higher world, the world of life and of growing light, is typified by a tiger(the monster of darkness and of the new moon) letting humanity, represented by achild, escape its jaws (the child being the ancestor of the tribe, likened tothe new moon, the 'Light that returns').\" These images come from the culturalarea of primitive China, but light and darkness symbols were complementarythere; the owl, a symbol of darkness, is to be found beside the pheasant, symbolof light. The cicada, too, is at once related to the demon of darkness and tothe demon of light. At every cosmic level a \"dark\" period is followed by a\"light,\" pure regenerate period. The symbolism of emerging from the \"darkness\"can be found in initiation rituals as well as in the mythology of death, and thelife of plants (buried seed, the \"darkness\" from which the \"new plant\"(neophyte)arises), and in the whole conception of \"historical\" cycles. The \"dark age,\"Kdll-yuga, is to be followed, after a complete break-up of the cosmos,(mahdpralaya) , by a new, regenerate era. The same idea is to be found in allthe traditions that tell of cosmic historic cycles, and though it does not seemto have first entered the human mind with the discovery of the moon's phases, itis undoubtedly illustrated perfectly by their rhythm.It is in this sense that we can talk of the positive value of periods of shadow,times of large-scale decadence and disintegration; they gain a suprahistoricalsignificance, though in fact it is just at such times that \"history\" is mostfully accomplished, for then the balance of things is precarious, humanconditions infinitely varied, new developments are encouraged by thedisintegration of the laws and of all the old framework. Such dark periods are asort of darkness, of universal night. And as such, just as death represents apositive value in itself, so do they; it is the same symbolism as that of larvaein the dark, of hibernation, of seeds bursting apart in the earth so that a newform can appear.It might be said that the moon shows man his true human condition; that in asense man looks at himself, and finds himself anew in the life of the moon. Thatis why the symbolism and mythology of the moon have an element of pathos and atthe same time of consolation, for the moon governs both death and fertility,both drama and initiation. Though the modality of the moon is supremely one ofchange, of rhythm, it is equally one of periodic returning; and this pattern ofexistence is disturbing and consoling at the same time—for though themanifestations of life are so frail that they can suddenly disappear altogether,they are restored in the \"eternal returning\" regulated by the moon. Such is thelaw of the whole sublunary universe. But that law, which is at once harsh andmerciful, can be abolished, and in some cases one may \"transcend\" this periodicbecoming and achieve a mode of existence that is absolute. We saw how, incertain Tantric techniques, an attempt is made to \"unify\" the moon and the sun,to get beyond the opposition between things, to be reintegrated in the primevalunity. This myth of reintegration is to be found almost everywhere in thehistory of religion in an infinity of variations—and fundamentally it is anexpression of the thirst to abolish dualisms, endless returnings and fragmentaryexistences. It existed at the most primitive stages, which indicates that man,from the time when he first realized his position in the universe, desiredpassionately and tried to achieve concretely (i.e., by religion and by magictogether) a passing beyond his human status (\"reflected\" so exactly by themoon's). We shall be dealing with myths of this nature elsewhere, but I notethem here, for they mark man's first attempt to get beyond his \"lunar mc>de ofbeing.\"The Emergence of MankindJOSEPH CAMPBELLJoseph Campbell identifies the four functions of myth in this selection. Heestablishes the historical and geographical factors that are involved with therise and diffusions of specific myths and mythological systems. An understandingof the four functions of mythology enables the reader to understand how and whatmyths mean in a given culture. This selection explains the basic need of mythsto be transformed through time since the function that myths serve, althoughconstant in their universal implications, must change with the changingspecifics in various cultures.W hat, then, are the earliest evidences of the mythological thinking of mankind?As already remarked, among the earliest evidences we can cite today of emergentmanlike creatures on this earth are the relics recently unearthed in the OlduvaiGorge of East Africa by Dr. L. S. B. Leakey: distinctly humanoid jaws and skullsdiscovered in earth strata of about 1,800,000 years ago. That is a long, longdrop into the past. And from that period on, until the rise in the Near East ofthe arts of grain agriculture and domestication of cattle, man was dependentabsolutely for his food supply on foraging for roots and fruit and on huntingand fishing. In those earliest millenniums, furthermore, men dwelt and movedabout in little groups as a minority on this earth. Today we are the greatmajority, and the enemies that we face are of our own species. Then, on theother hand, the great majority were the beasts, who, furthermore, were the\"old-timers\" on earth, fixed and certain in their ways, at home here, and manyof them extremely dangerous. Only relatively rarely would one community ofhumans have to face and deal with another. Normally, it would be with animalsthat their encounters—desperate and otherwise—would occur. And as we todayconfront our human neighbors variously with fear, respect, revulsion, affection,or indifference, so also then—for all those millenniums of centuries—it wasnormally animal neighbors that were thus experienced. Moreover, as we today haveunderstandings with our neighbors—or at least imagine that we have—so also thoseearliest ape-men seem to have imagined that there were certain mutualunderstandings which they shared with the animal world.Our first tangible evidences of mythological thinking are from the period ofNeanderthal Man, which endured from c. 250,000 to c. 50,000 B.C.; and thesecomprise, first, burials with food supplies, grave gear, tools, sacrificedanimals, and the like; and second, a number of chapels in high-mountain caves,where cave-bear skulls, ceremonially disposed in symbolic settings, have beenpreserved. The burials suggest the idea, if not exactly of immortality, then atleast ofsome kind of life to come; and the almost inaccessible high-mountain bear-skullsanctuaries surely represent a cult in honor of that great, upright, manlike,hairy personage, the bear. The bear is still revered by the hunting and fishingpeoples of the far North, both in Europe and Siberia and among our NorthAmerican Indian tribes; and we have reports of a number among whom the heads andskulls of the honored beasts are preserved very much as in those earlyNeanderthal caves.Particularly instructive and well reported is the instance of the bear cult ofthe Ainu of Japan, a Caucasoid race that entered and settled Japan centuriesearlier than the Mongoloid Japanese, and are confined today to the northernislands, Kokkaido and Sakhalin—the latter now, of course, in Russian hands.These curious people have the sensible idea that this world is more attractivethan the next, and that godly beings residing in that other, consequently, areinclined to come pay us visits. They arrive in the shapes of animals, but, oncethey have donned their animal uniforms, are unable to remove them. Theytherefore cannot return home without human help. And so the Ainu do help— bykilling them, removing and eating the uniforms, and ceremonially bidding thereleased visitors bon voyage.We have a number of detailed accounts of the ceremonials, and even now one mayhave the good fortune to witness such an occasion. The bears are taken whenstill cubs and are raised as pets of the captor's family, affectionately nursedby the womenfolk and allowed to tumble about with the youngsters. When they havebecome older and a little too rough, however, they are kept confined in a cage,and when the little guest is about four years old, the time arrives for him tobe sent home. The head of the household in which he has been living will preparehim for the occasion by advising him that although he may find the festivities abit harsh, they are unavoidably so and kindly intended. \"Little divinity,\" thecaged little fellow will be told in a public speech, \"we are about to send youhome, and in case you have never experienced one of these ceremonies before, youmust know that it has to be this way. We want you to go home and tell yourparents how well you have been treated here on earth. And if you have enjoyedyour life among us and would like to do us the honor of coming to visit again,we in turn shall do you the honor of arranging for another bear ceremony of thiskind.\" The little fellow is quickly and skillfully dispatched. His hide isremoved with head and paws attached and arranged upon a rack to look alive. Abanquet is then prepared, of which the main dish is a chunky stew of his ownmeat, a lavish bowl of which is placed beneath his snout for his own last supperon earth; after which, with a number o: farewell presents to take along, he issupposed to go happily home.Now a leading theme, to which I would call attention here, is that of theinvitation to the bear to return to earth. This implies that in the Ainu viewthere is no such thing as death. And we find the same thought expressed in thefinal instructions delivered to the departed in the Ainu rites of burial. Thedead are not to come back as haunts or possessing spirits, but only by theproper natural course, as babies. Moreover, since death alone would be nopunishment for an Ainu, their extreme sentence for serious crimes is death bytorture.A second essential idea is that of the bear as a divine visitor whose animalbody has to be \"broken\" (as they say) to release him for return to hisother-world home. Many edible plants, as well as hunted beasts, are believed tobe visitors of this kind; so that the Ainu, killing and eating them, are doingthem no harm, but actually a favor. There is here an obvious psychologicaldefense against the guilt feelings and fears of revenge of a primitive huntingand fishing folk whose whole existence hangs upon acts of continual mercilesskilling. The murdered beasts and consumed plants are thought of as willingvictims; so that gratitude, not malice, must be the response of their liberatedspirits to the \"breaking and eating\" of their merely provisional materialbodies.There is a legend of the Ainu of Kushiro (on the southeastern coast of Hokkaido)which purports to explain the high reverence in which the bear is held. It tellsof a young wife who used to go every day with her baby to the mountains tosearch for lily roots and other edibles; and when she had gathered her fill, shewould go to a stream to wash her roots, removing the baby from her back andleaving it wrapped in her clothes on the bank, while she went naked into thewater. One day thus in the stream she began to sing a beautiful song, and whenshe had waded to shore, still singing, commenced dancing to its tune, altogetherenchanted by her own dance and song and unaware of her surroundings, until,suddenly, she heard a frightening sound, and when she looked, there was thebear-god coming. Terrified, she ran off, just as she was. And when the bear-godsaw the abandoned child by the stream, he thought: I came, attracted by thatbeautiful song, stepping quietly, not to be heard. But alas! Her music was sobeautiful it moved me to rapture and inadvertently I made a noise.The infant having begun to cry, the bear-god put his tongue into its mouth tonourish and to quiet it, and for a number of days, tenderly nursing it this way,never leaving its side, contrived to keep it alive. When, however, a band ofhunters from the village approached, the bear took off, and the villagers,coming upon the abandoned child alive, understood that the bear had cared forit, and, marveling, said to one another, \"He took care of this lost baby. Thebear is good. He is a worthy deity, and surely deserving of our worship.\" Sothey pursued and shot him, brought him back to their village, held a bearfestival, and, offering good food and wine to his soul, as well as loading itwith fetishes, sent him homeward on his way in wealth and joy.Since the bear, the leading figure of the Ainu pantheon, is regarded as amountain god, a number of scholars have suggested that a like belief may accountfor the selection of lofty mountain caves to be the chapels of the oldNeanderthal bear cult. The Ainu too preserve the skulls of the bears theysacrifice. Moreover, signs of fire hearths have been noted in the highNeanderthal chapels; and in the ocurse of the Ainu rite the fire-goddess Fuji isinvited to share with the sacrificed bear the banquet of his meat. The two, thefire-goddess and the mountain god, are supposed to be chatting together whiletheir Ainu hosts and hostesses entertain them with song the night long, and withfood and drink. We cannot be certain, of course, that the old Neanderthalers ofsome two hundred thousand years ago had any such ideas. A number ofauthoritative scholars seriously question the propriety of interpretingprehistoric remains by referenceto the customs of modern primitive peoples. And yet, in the present instance theanalogies are truly striking. It has even been remarked that in both contextsthe number of neck vertebrae remaining attached to the severed skulls isgenerally two. But in any case, we can surely say without serious doubt that thebear is in both contexts a venerated beast, that his powers survive death andare effective in the preserved skull, that rituals serve to link those powers tothe aims of the human community, and that the power of fire is in some mannerassociated with the rites.The earliest known evidences of the cultivation of fire go back to a period asremote from that of Neanderthal Man as is his dim day from our own, namely, thatof Pithecanthropus, some five hundred thousand years ago, in the dens of theravenous low-browed cannibal known as Peking Man, who was particularly fond,apparently, of brains a la nature, gobbled raw from freshly opened skulls. Hisfires were not used for cooking. Neither were those of the Neanderthalers. Forwhat, then? To furnish heat? Possibly! But possibly, also, as a fascinatingfetish, kept alive in its hearth as on an altar. And this conjecture is the morelikely in the light of the later appearance of domesticated fire, not only inthe high Neanderthal bear sanctuaries but also in the context of the Ainu bearfestivals, where it is identified explicitly with the manifestation of agoddess. Fire, then, may well have been the first enshrined divinity ofprehistoric man. Fire has the property of not being diminished when halved, butincreased. Fire is luminous, like the sun and lightning, the only such thing onearth. Also, it is alive: in the warmth of the human body it is life itself,which departs when the body gets cold. It is prodigious in volcanoes, and, as weknow from the lore of many primitive traditions, it has been frequentlyidentified with a demoness of volcanoes, who presides over an afterworld wherethe dead enjoy an everlasting dance in marvelously dancing volcanic flames.The rugged race and life style of Neanderthal Man passed away and even out ofmemory with the termination of the Ice Ages, some forty thousand years ago; andthere appeared then, rather abruptly, a distinctly superior race of man, Homosapiens proper, which is directly ancestral to ourselves. It is with thesemen—significantly—that the beautiful cave paintings are associated of the FrenchPyrenees, French Dordogne, and Spanish Cantabrian hills; also, those littlefemale figurines of stone, or of mammoth bone or ivory, that have beendubbed—amusingly—paleolithic Venuses and are, apparently, the earliest worksever produced of human art. A worshiped cave-bear skull is not an art object,nor is a burial, or a flaked tool, in the sense that I am here using the term.The figurines were fashioned without feet, because they were intended to bepressed into the earth, set up in little household shrines.And it seems to me important to remark that, whereas when masculine figuresappear in the wall paintings of the same period they are always clothed in somesort of costume, these female figurines are absolutely naked, simply standing,unadorned. This says something about the psychological and consequently mythicalvalues of, respectively, the male and the female presences. The woman isimmediately mythic in herself and is experienced as such, not only as the sourceand giver of life, but also in the magic of her touch and presence. The accordof her seasons with the cycles of the moon is a matter of mystery too.Whereas the male, costumed, is one who has gained his powers and represents somespecific, limited, social role or function. In infancy—as both Freud and Junghave pointed out—the mother is experienced as a power of nature and the fatheras the authority of society. The mother has brought forth the child, provides itwith nourishment, and in the infants imagination may appear also (like the witchof Hansel and Gretel) as a consuming mother, threatening to swallow her productback. The father is, then, the initiator, not only inducting the boy into hissocial role, but also, as representing to his daughter her first and foremostexperience of the character of the male, awakening her to her social role asfemale to male. The paleolithic Venuses have been found in the precincts alwaysof domestic hearths, while the figures of the costumed males, on the other hand,appear in the deep, dark interiors of the painted temple-caves, among thewonderfully pictured animal herds. They resemble in their dress and attitudes,furthermore, the shamans of our later primitive tribes, and were undoubtedlyassociated with rituals of the hunt and of initiation.Let me here review a legend of the North American Blackfoot tribe that I havealready recounted in The Masks of God, Volume 1, Primitive Mythology; for itsuggests better than any other legend I know the manner in which theartist-hunters of the paleolithic age must have interpreted the rituals of theirmysteriously painted temple-caves. This Blackfoot legend is of a season when theIndians found themselves, on the approach of winter, unable to lay up a supplyof buffalo meat, since the animals were refusing to be stampeded over thebuffalo fall. When driven toward the precipice, they would swerve at the edge toright or left and gallop away.And so it was that, early one morning, when a young woman of the hungeringvillage encamped at the foot of the great cliff went to fetch water for herfamily's tent and, looking up, spied a herd grazing on the plain above, at theedge of the precipice, she cried out that if they would only jump into thecorral, she would marry one of them. Whereupon, lo! the animals began comingover, tumbling and falling to their deaths. She was, of course, amazed andthrilled, but then, when a big bull with a single bound cleared the walls of thecorral and came trotting in her direction, she was terrified. \"Come along!\" hesaid. \"Oh no!\" she answered, drawing back. But insisting on her promise, he ledher up the cliff, onto the prairie, and away.That bull had been the moving spirit of the herd, a figure rather of mythic thanof material dimension. And we find his counterparts everywhere in the legends ofprimitive hunters: semi-human, semi-animal, shamanistic characters (like theserpent of Eden), difficult to picture either as animal or as man; yet in thenarratives we accept their parts with ease.When the happy people of the village had finished slaughtering their windfall,they realized that the young woman had disappeared. Her father, discovering hertracks and noticing beside them those of the buffalo, turned back for his bowand quiver, and then followed the trail on up the cliff and out onto the plain.It was a considerable way that he had walked before he came to a buffalo wallowand, a little way off, spied a herd. Being tired, he sat down and, whileconsidering what to do, saw a magpie flying, which descended to the wallow closeby and began picking about.\"Ha!\" cried the man. \"You handsome bird! As you fly around, should you see mydaughter, would you tell her, please, that her father is here, waiting for herat the wallow?\"The beautiful black and white bird with long graceful tail winged away directlyto the herd and, seeing a young woman there, fluttered to earth nearby andresumed his picking, turning his head this way and that, until, coming veryclose to her, he whispered, \"Your father is waiting for you at the wallow.\"She was frightened and glanced about. The bull, her husband, close by, wasasleep. \"Sh-h-h! Go back,\" she whispered, \"and tell my father to wait.\"The bird returned with her message to the wallow, and the big bull presentlywoke.\"Go get me some water,\" the big bull said, and the young woman, rising, pluckeda horn from her husband's head and proceeded to the wallow, where her fatherroughly seized her arm. \"No, no!\" she warned. \"They will follow and kill usboth. We must wait until he returns to sleep, when I'll come and we'll slipaway.\"She filled the horn and walked back with it to her husband, who drank but oneswallow and sniffed. \"There is a person close by,\" said he. He sipped andsniffed again; then stood up and bellowed. What a fearful sound!Up stood all the bulls. They raised their short tails and shook them, tossedtheir great heads, and bellowed back; then pawed the dirt, rushed about in alldirections, and finally, heading for the wallow, trampled to death that poorIndian who had come to seek his daughter: hooked him with their horns and againtrampled him with their hoofs, until not even the smallest particle of his bodyremained to be seen. The daughter was screaming, \"Oh, my father, my father!\" Andher face was streaming with tears.\"Aha!\" said the bull harshly. \"So you're mourning for your father! And so now,perhaps, you will understand how it is and has always been with us. We have seenour mothers, fathers, all our relatives, killed and butchered by your people.But I shall have pity on you and give you just one chance. If you can bring yourfather back to life, you and he can return to your people.\"The unhappy girl, turning to the magpie, begged him to search the trampled mudfor some little portion of her father's body; which he did, again pecking aboutin the wallow until his long beak came up with a joint of the man's backbone.The young woman placed this on the ground carefully and, covering it with herrobe, sang a certain song. Not long, and it could be seen that there was a manbeneath the robe. She lifted a corner. It was her father, not yet alive. She letthe corner down, resumed her song, and when she next took the robe away he wasbreathing. Her father stood up, and the magpie, delighted, flew round and roundwith a marvelous clatter. The buffalo were astounded.\"We have seen strange things today,\" said the big bull to the others of hisherd. \"The man we trampled to death is again alive. The people's power isstrong.\"He turned to the young woman. \"Now, before you and your father go, we shallteach you our own dance and song, which you are never to forget.\" For these wereto be the magical means by which the buffalo killed by the people inthe future would be restored to life, as the man killed by the buffalo had beenrestored.All the buffalo danced; and, as befitted the dance of such great beasts, thesong was slow and solemn, the step ponderous and deliberate. And when the dancewas ended, the big bull said, \"Now go to your home and do not forget what youhave seen. Teach this dance and song to your people. The sacred object of therite is to be a bull's head and buffalo robe: all who dance the bulls are towear a bull's head and buffalo robe when they perform.\"It is amazing how many of the painted figures of the great paleolithic cavestake on new life when viewed in the light of such tales of the recent huntingraces. One cannot be certain, of course, that the references suggested arealtogether correct. However, that the main ideas were much the same is almostcertainly true. And among these we may number that of the animals killed asbeing willing victims, that of the ceremonies of their invocation asrepresenting a mystic covenant between the animal world and the human, and thatof song and dance as being the vehicles of the magical force of such ceremonies;further, the concept of each species of the animal world as a kind of multipliedindividual, having as its seed or essential monad a semi-human, semi-animal,magically potent Master Animal; and the idea related to this, of there being nosuch thing as death, material bodies being merely costumes put on by otherwiseinvisible monadic entities, which can pass back and forth from an invisibleother world into this, as though through an intangible wall; the notions, also,of marriages between human beings and beasts, of commerce and conversationsbetween beasts and men in ancient times, and of specific covenanting episodes inthose times from which the rites and customs of the peoples were derived; thenotion of the magical power of such rites, and the idea that, to retain theirpower, they must be held true to their first and founding form—even theslightest deviation destroying their spell.So much, then, for the mythic world of the primitive hunters. Dwelling mainly ongreat grazing lands, where the spectacle of nature is of a broadly spreadingearth covered over by an azure dome touching down on distant horizons and thedominant image of life is of animal societies moving about in that spaciousroom, those nomadic tribes, living by killing, have been generally of a warlikecharacter. Supported and protected by the hunting skills and battle courage oftheir males, they are dominated necessarily by a masculine psychology,male-oriented mythology, and appreciation of individual valor.In tropical jungles, on the other hand, an altogether different order of natureprevails, and, accordingly, of psychology and mythology as well. For thedominant spectacle there is of teeming vegetable life with all else more hiddenthan seen. Above is a leafy upper world inhabited by winged screeching birds;below, a heavy cover of leaves, beneath which serpents, scorpions, and manyother mortal dangers lurk. There is no distant clean horizon, but anever-continuing tangle of trunks and leafage in all directions wherein solitaryadventure is perilous. The village compound is relatively stable, earthbound,nourished on plant food gathered or cultivated mainly by the women; and the malepsyche is consequently in bad case. For even the primary psychologicaltask for the young male of achieving separation from dependency on the mother ishardly possible in a world where all the essential work is being attended to, onevery hand, by completely efficient females.It is therefore among tropical tribes that the wonderful institution originatedof the men's secret society, where no women are allowed, and where curioussymbolic games flattering the masculine zeal for achievement can be enjoyed insecurity, safe away from Mother's governing eye. In those zones, furthermore,the common sight of rotting vegetation giving rise to new green shoots seems tohave inspired a mythology of death as the giver of life; whence the hideous ideafollowed that the way to increase life is to increase death. The result hasbeen, for millenniums, a general rage of sacrifice through the whole tropicalbelt of our planet, quite in contrast to the comparatively childish ceremoniesof animal-worship and -appeasement of the hunters of the great plains: brutalhuman as well as animal sacrifices, highly symbolic in detail; sacrifices alsoof fruits of the field, of the firstborn, of widows on their husbands' graves,and finally of entire courts together with their kings. The mythic theme of theWilling Victim has become associated here with the image of a primordial beingthat in the beginning offered itself to be slain, dismembered, and buried; andfrom whose buried parts then arose the food plants by which the lives of thepeople are sustained.In the Polynesian Cook Islands there is an amusing local variant of this generalmyth in the legend of a maiden named Hina (Moon) who enjoyed bathing in acertain pool. A great big eel, one day, swam past and touched her. This occurredagain, day after day, until, on one occasion, it threw off its eel costume and abeautiful youth, Te Tuna (the Eel), stood before her, whom she accepted as herlover. Thereafter he would visit her in human form, but become an eel when heswam away, until one day he announced that the time had come for him to leaveforever. He would pay her one more visit, arriving in his eel form in a greatflood of water, when she should cut off his head and bury it. And so indeed hecame. And Hina did exactly as she was told. And every day thereafter she visitedthe place of the buried head, until a green sprout appeared that grew into abeautiful tree, which in the course of time produced fruits. Those were thefirst coconuts; and every nut, when husked, still shows the eyes and face ofHina's lover.Art As A RevelationJOSEPH CAMPBELLJoseph Campbell, in this selection, identifies the changes in the mythologicthinking of different cultures and explains the particular associations thathave been made with such symbols as the bear, fire, and women. By explaining theinfluence of the environment on the mythology of a particular culture, Campbellhelps the reader to understand how particularities of myth and mythicalperspectives are necessarily transformed.PALEOLITHIC ROCK PAINTINGS1 hat an abrupt expansion of human consciousness occurred toward the close ofthe last glacial age, some 30,000 years ago, is evident in the appearance atthat time in southwestern France and northern Spain of the earliest known worksof visual art—both the rock paintings of the vast temple caves of the men'shunting ceremonials, and the numerous nude female figurines that have been foundassociated chiefly with dwelling sites. Evidence of the skulls suggests that anevolutionary advance from the mentality of Neanderthal to that of Cro-Magnon Man(\"archaic\" to \"modern\" Homo sapiens) is what unleashed this creative explosion—to borrow a term from a recent study of the period by John E. Pfeiffer.According to Pfeiffer's interpretation of the phenomenon: There had been at thattime an increase in population density with an associated social problem ofconflict control, to which (in Pfeiffer's words) impressive institutions andoccasions had to be addressed incorporating symbolic figurations, through whichthe regulations of a corpus of socially constructive rituals were pictoriallyencoded for storage and transmission through generations—which may be all verywell as far, at least, as the sociological aspect of the remarkable occasion isconcerned. The question remains, however, as to the originating source and senseof those affective symbolic figurations, which, when thus socially encoded byway of a \"creative explosion\" of literally thousands of magnificent masterworksof an unprecedented form of human expression, remained for some 20,000 years inforce (c. 30,000 to 10,000 B.C.) as the founding mythological revelation forunnumbered generations of hunting tribes, whose lives and way of life wereutterly dependent, not only on the physical support, but also on the spiritualinstruction, of the animals thus displayed and celebrated in their subterraneanchambers of initiation and invocation.Andre Leroi-Gourhan, the present leading authority on the cavern art ofPaleolithic Europe, has found through a comparative study and computerized countof the animals depicted in the caves, that the number of species represented ismuch lower than the number of species known to have existed at the time.\"Paleolithic artists,\" he writes, \"did not portray just any animal, but animalsof certain species, and these did not necessarily play a part in their dailylife. . . . The main actors,\" he discovered, \"are the horse and the bison, theanimals next in importance being the hinds, the mammoths, the oxen, the ibexes,and the stags. . . . Bears, lions, and rhinoceroces play an important part, butas a rule there is only one representation of each per cave, and they are by nomeans represented in every cave.\"Such, then, were the animals selected by the Paleolithic master artists from thebounty of their environment for depiction in the galleries of their subterraneancorridors and chambers, as being in some way significant of a mystic dimensionof their landscape perceived by the eye of the mind, not the eyes of thephysical look of things. One may compare their number to that of the masqueradeof metaphorical birds and beasts selected by the Kwakiutl of the North AmericanNorth Pacific Coast from the bounty of their environment, as shown in thephotograph by Edward Curtis here reproduced, to be evoked to life in seasonaldances.As Leroi-Gourhan discovered further in this comparative study of the paintedcaves, certain animals turned up next to each other \"too often for suchassociations to be explained only as chance\": oxen or bison next to horses, forexample, or bisons next to mammoths. \"The fundamental principle,\" he concluded,\"is that of pairing. . . . Starting with the earliest figures, one has theimpression of being faced with a system polished in the course of time—notunlike the older religions of our world, wherein there are male and femaledivinities whose actions do not overtly allude to sexual reproduction, but whosemale and female qualities are indispensably complementary.\"Moreover, as he also found, there is an architectural order in the distributionof the symbolic beasts and signs throughout the geographical as well ashistorical range of this earliest known, recorded testament to a system ofideas. \"What constituted for Paleolithic men the special heart and core of thecaves,\" he discovered, \"is clearly the panels in the central part, dominated byanimals from the male category and male signs. The entrance to the sanctuary,usually a narrow part of the cave, is decorated with male symbols, eitheranimals or signs; the back of the cave, often a narrow tunnel, is decorated withthe same signs, reinforced by horned men and the rarer animals (cave lion orrhinoceros). Although crowded with images this framework is quite simple; yet itleaves us completely in the dark concerning what we should like to know aboutthe rites, and let us say, about an underlying metaphysics. However, it rulesout any simplistic idea concerning the religious system of Paleolithic men.\"This important statement from an unimpeachable authority confirms and validatesthe impression which immediately overtakes even the ill prepared visitor to sucha sanctuary of Stone Age faith and hope as, say, the magnificently conceivedgrotto of Lascaux: which is, namely, of an ordered system of metaphoricalreflections preserved from an age beyond our horizon of time in the pictorialscript of this truly amazing Stone Age testament. It is certainly not a meremindless arrangement of accurately observed animal forms, expertly delineated bya school of accomplished artists striving for decorative optical effects. Thesense of an intelligible metaphorical statement is incontestable.Comparably, on entering such a relatively modern sacred space as, for example,the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, or the temple in Nara, Japan, ofthe Great Sun Buddha, Vairochana, the visitor, the stranger from afar, willimmediately know that he has entered an area where everything is not onlymetaphorical, but intelligibly related to everything else. And the reader of thepresent volume, likewise, on viewing the photograph by Edward Curtis, willsurely have realized that the array of bizarre physical shapes there broughttogether and arranged for the cameras eye adumbrates a mythological ordervisible only to the eye of the informed mind, signifying a way of understandingand relating to the universe.The universe viewed by the physical eye alone is but an array of shapes, somealive, some not, all changing either rapidly or slowly, which though linkedalong chains of cause and effect, are seen as distinct and separate from eachother. In this phenomenal field, an Aristotelian logic prevails: a is not not-a.Moreover, except for the miracle of fire (and today, the electric bulb), theobserved forms are not self-luminous. They are visible only by daylight to thedaylight mind, when awake and outwardly cognitive, attentive to objectsapprehended as apart from, and other than itself. As quoted by Ananda K.Coom-araswamy from a sermon by the medieval Rhineland mystic and theologianMeister Eckhart: \"Subtract the mind, and the eye is open to no purpose.\"By night, however, when the sun has set, the mind turns inward and, togetherwith its universe, which is now a reflex of itself, \"doth change Into somethingrich and strange.\" The forms now beheld are self-luminous and in definitionambiguous, unsubstantial yet insuppressibly affective. For not-a is nowindistinguishable from a. The beholding mind and the objects beheld are of thesame, non-dual, dreaming consciousness and of an intimately suggestive yetelusive import of some kind.As defined, classified and described in the Indian Upanishads (first millenniumB.C.), these contrasting states of consciousness in waking and in dream areknown, respectively, as Vaisvdnara, meaning \"Common to all Men,\" and Tai-jasa,\"Originating from and consisting oftejas ('light').\" They are identified,furthermore, with the first and second elements of the sacred syllable AUM or OM(a and u being in Sanskrit pronounced together as o), the concluding element, M,being then identified with the state of deep dreamless sleep.As described in the Mdndukya Upanishad:1. \"OM! This perishable sound is all. As further explained: it is the Past, thePresent, the Future, all that has become, is becoming, and is yet to be.Moreover, whatever transcends this three-fold Time: that also isOM.2. \"For verily, this all is brahman (the Imperishable). One's Self, too, isbrahman. The Self (atman) is of four conditions:3. \"The Waking State (jagarita-sthana), outwardly cognitive, experiencing thegross enjoyments common to all men (sthulabhug-vaisvanara) by way of the body,its senses, organs of action, vital energies, and aspects of mind: this is thefirst condition of the Self.4. \"The Dreaming State (svapna-sthdna), inwardly cognitive, experiencing inexquisite solitude luminous enjoyments (praviviktabhuk-taijasa) by way of thebody, its senses, organs of action, vital energies, and aspects of mind. This isthe second condition.5. \"Where one asleep has no desires whatsoever, sees no dream whatsoever: thatis deep sleep. The Deep Sleep State (sushupta-sthdna) is at one with itself(eklb-huta), an involuted cognitional mass (prajndnaghana), alone (eva),ensheathed in bliss (dnandamaya), enjoying bliss (dnandabhuj), the portal toknowledge [of the other two states]. Of the Knower (prdjna) this is the thirdcondition.6. \"This, verily, is the all-knowing Lord of all, Indweller and Controller; theMatrix (yoni) of all; the Beginning and End (prabhavdpyayau) of all beings.7. \"What is thought of as the fourth condition of the Self—cognitive neitherinward, outward, nor of the intermediate state; not a uniform cognitional mass;neither knowing nor unknowing (naprajnam-ndprajnam); unseen (adrshta); detached(avyavahdrya); incomprehensible (agrdhya); without characteristics (alakshana);beyond thought (acintya); indescribable (avyapadesya); the essence of theassurance of a state of identity with the Self (ekdtmya-pratyaya-sdra); thecessation of manifestation (prapancopasama), at peace (sdnta); felicitous (siva)and non-dual (advaita) —that is the Self (dtman) to be realized.8. \"This then is the Self (dtman) in the sense of the elements of theimperishable syllable. The elements are the four conditions and the fourconditions are the elements: namely, A, U, M [and the Fourth, the Silencebefore, after, and supporting the sounding of the syllable OM].9. \"The Waking State, the Common to all Men, is the A-sound, the first element,for its comprehensiveness and priority. He who knows this obtains verily all hisdesires and becomes preeminent.10. \"The Dreaming State, Self-Luminous, is the U sound, the second element, forits eminence and intermediacy. He who knows this becomes verily a fountain ofknowledge equal to any. In his family no one is born ignorant of brahman.11. \"The Deep Sleep State, of Intuitive Wisdom (prdjna), is the M sound, thethird element, as being the measure (miti), the termination or quenching (apiti)wherein all become one. He who knows this measures and comprehends all inhimself.12. \"Transcendent, unsounded, beyond action (avyavahdrya), is the Fourth, of nophenomenal existence, supremely blissful and without a second. Thus OM is indeeddtman, the Self. He who knows this enters through the Self into the Self—yea, hewho know this.\"Sigmund Freud, treating of the dreaming state in the early masterwork by whichhis reputation wa> established, Die Traumdeutung (The Interpretation of Dreams,published 1899 but dated 1900), distinguishes two sources of the impulsescontributing to the instigation of dreams:(1) wish-impulses originating in waking consciousness (Cs.) but carried into thedream state by way of what he termed the \"Preconscious\" (Pes.), and then(2) wish-impulses arising from the Unconscious (Ucs.) system.\"In general, I am of the opinion,\" he states, \"that unfulfilled wishes of theday are insufficient to produce a dream in adults. I will readily admit that thewish-impulses originating in consciousness contribute to the instigation ofdreams, but they probably do no more. The dream would not occur if thepre-conscious wish were not reinforced from another source.\"That source is the unconscious. I believe that the conscious wish becomeseffective in exciting a dream only when it succeeds in arousing a similarunconscious wish which reinforces it. ... I believe that these unconsciouswishes are always active and ready to express themselves whenever they find anopportunity of allying themselves with an impulse from consciousness, andtransferring their own greater intensity to the lesser intensity of the latter.It must, therefore, seem that the conscious wish alone has been realized in thedream; but a slight peculiarity in the form of the dream will put us on thetrack of the powerful ally from the unconscious. . . .\"The thought-impulses continued into sleep may be divided into the followinggroups:1. Those which have not been completed during the day owing to some accidentalcause.2. Those which have been left uncompleted because our mental powers have failedus, i.e., unsolved problems.3. Those which have been turned back and suppressed during the day. This isreinforced by a powerful fourth group:4. Those which have been excited in our Ucs. during the day by the workings ofthe Pes.; and finally we may add a fifth, consisting of:5. The indifferent impressions of the day, which have therefore been leftunsettled.\"We need not underrate the psychic intensities introduced into sleep by theseresidues of the day's waking life, especially those emanating from the group ofthe unsolved issues. ... I cannot say what change is produced in the Pes. systemby the state of sleep, but there is no doubt that the psychologicalcharacteristics of sleep are to be sought mainly in the cathectic changesoccuring in just this system. . . . On the other hand, I have found nothing inthe psychology of dreams to warrant the assumption that sleep produces any butsecondary changes in the conditions of the Ucs. system. Hence, for the nocturnalexcitations in the Pes. there remains no other path than that taken by thewish-excitations from the Ucs.; they must seek reinforcement from the Ucs., andfollow the detours of the unconscious excitations.\"But what is the relation of the preconscious day-residues to the dream? Thereis no doubt that they penetrate abundantly into the dream; that they utilize thedream-content to obtrude themselves upon consciousness even during the night;indeed, they sometimes even dominate the dream-content, and compel it tocontinue the work of the day; it is also certain that the day-residues may justas well have any other character as that of wishes.\"And so, returning to India with this 19th-century European insight into thenature of what Freud called the \"dream work\" in mind, we find that the Vedantictheologian Sankara (c. a.d. 700-750), treating, in his commentary on Mdn-dukyaUpanishad verse 4, of the intermediate Dream State between Waking and DeepDreamless Sleep, was already fully aware of the interplay there of (1) thepreconscious day-residues, and (2) what in India is recognized as the \"innerlight\" (taijasa) of the Self.\"Waking consciousness,\" we read in Sankara's discussion, \"being associated withmany manners of relationship and seemingly conscious of objects as external(although in reality they are nothing but states of mind), leaves in the mindcorresponding impressions. That the mind in dream, maintaining none of theexternal connections, yet possessed of these impressions left upon it by thewaking consciousness, like a piece of canvas with pictures painted upon it,should experience the dream state as though it were a waking state, is due toits being under the influence of ignorance (avidya), desire (kama), and impulseto action (karma). Thus it is said in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. ninthcentury B.C.):\"'When, on falling asleep, one takes along the material (indtra) of thisall-containing world, tears it apart and builds it up, oneself, and by one's ownlight dreams: that person becomes self-illuminated.\"'There are no chariots there, no spans, no roads. Yet he projects from himselfchariots, spans, and roads. There are no blisses there, no pleasures, nodelights. Yet he projects from himself, blisses, pleasures, and delights. Thereare no tanks there, no lotus-pools, no streams. Yet he projects from himselftanks, lotus-pools, and streams. For he is a creator.\"'To this point there are the following verses:'\"Striking down in sleep what is bodily, Sleepless, he looks down upon thesleeping senses. Having taken to himself light, he has returned to his ownplace: That Golden Person (hircinmaya purusha), the Lone Wild Gander (ekahamsa).Guarding with his breath his low nest, Out of that next the Immortal goes forth.He goes wherever he pleases, that Immortal, The Golden Person, the Unique WildGander.In the State of Sleep, soaring high and low,A god, he puts forth for himself innumerable forms:Now, as it were, enjoying pleasure with women;Now, as it were, laughing, or beholding even terrifying sights.People see his pleasure ground; Him no one sees at all. \"Just what overpowering transpersonal experiences and associated thoughtsinformed the minds and moved the practiced hands of the artists of the LatePaleolithic, we shall of course never directly know, since no word of whateverspeech may have been theirs has come down to us. From the Bushmen of the SouthAfrican Kalahari Desert, however, whose rock art has been practiced (apparentlywithout interruption) since the close of the last glacial age, verbal accountshave been recorded, not only of the mythology, but also of the out-of-bodyexperiences in trance state, from which their spirited representationshave been taken of an intelligible sphere, known to the eye of the mind, unseenby the light of day.Certainly one of the most vivid accounts of such a visionary adventure yetrecorded from any quarter of the globe is that from the report of an experiencedKung trance dancer, as delivered to Marguerite Anne Biesele scarcely more than adecade ago. Bearing in mind the image of the Self as the Lone Wild Gander inflight, let us here recall the circumstances of that remarkable out-of-bodyadventure, which is such, apparently, as occurs nearly every night among theBushmen of the Kalahari.A little cluster of women, who have lighted a large fire and are seated on theground, has begun intoning a wordless chant while steadily clapping time.Eventually, a few of the men stray in behind them, to circle with short heavystamps in a single line, which turns about, from time to time, to circle theother way. Their rhythms are complex, built into 5- and 7-beat phrases, andtheir body postures tight, hunched forward, arms close to the sides, slightlyflexed. Others join the round, and as the night runs on, those approachingtrance begin to concentrate intently. A climax strikes when one or another ofthem breaks and passes into the state known as half-death, while his spiritflies and climbs along threads of spider silk to the sky.\"When people sing,\" declared Marguerite Biesele's trance dancer, \"I dance. Ienter the earth. I go in at a place like a place where people drink water. Itravel a long way, very far. When I emerge, I am already climbing. I'm climbingthreads, the threads that lie over there in the south. I climb one and leave it,then I climb another one. Then I leave it and climb another. . . . And when youarrive at God's place you make yourself small. You have become small. You comein small to God's place. You do what you have to do there. Then you return towhere everyone is, and you hide your face. You hide your face so you won't seeanything. You come and come and come and finally you enter your body again. Allthe people who have stayed behind are waiting for you—they fear you. You enter,enter the earth, and you return to enter the skin of your body . . . And you say'he-e-e-e!' That is the sound of your return to your body. Then you begin tosing. The nfwm-masters are there around. They take powder and blow it— Phew!Phew!—in your face. They take hold of your head and blow about the sides of yourface. This is how you manage to be alive again. Friends, if they don't do thatto you, you die. . . . You just die and are dead. Friends, this is what it does,this ntum that I do, this ntum here that I dance.\"The term ntum has been explained as a supernatural power that in theMythological Age of the Beginning was put by the creator god into a number ofthings: medicine songs, ostrich eggs, certain plants and fruits, the sun,falling stars, rain, bees, honey, giraffes, aardvarks, blood, redwingpartridges, and fires made in certain situations; also into certain persons, whomay function as medicine men and healers.Ntum varies in force in the various things it informs: beneficent in some,always strong, but in some things dangerously so. Ntum is so strong in the greatgod Gauwa that should he approach an ordinary mortal, like a lightning bolt hisntum would kill the man. The Kung call ntum a \"death thing\"; also, a \"fight.\"As discussed at length in my chapter on the Bushman trance dance and its mythicground, the supreme occasion for the activation of ntum is the trance dance. Theexertion of the tirelessly circling dancers heats their medicine power, which,as reported in the writings of Lorna Marshall and Richard B. Lee, theyexperience as a physical substance in the pit of the stomach. The women'ssinging, the men say, \"awakens their hearts,\" and eventually their portion ofntum becomes so hot that it boils. \"The men say it boils up their spinal columnsinto their heads, and is so strong when it does this,\" Lorna Marshall reports,\"that it overcomes them and they lose their senses.\"One of the very greatest Indian Godmen of the last century, Sri Ramakrishna(1836-1886), once described to a circle of his devotees the physical sensationof the unfolding ascent up his spine of the charge of psychic energy known inIndia as the Kundalinl, the \"Coiled Serpent Power.\" In Ramakrishna's words:\"Sometimes the Spiritual Current rises through the spine, crawling like an ant.Sometimes, in sainddhi [ecstasy in full trance], the soul swims joyfully in theocean of divine ecstasy, like a fish. Sometimes, when I lie down on my side, Ifeel the Spiritual Current pushing me like a monkey and playing with mejoyfully. I remain still. The Current, like a monkey, suddenly with one jumpreaches the Sahasrdra [the supreme spiritual center, envisioned as athousand-petalled lotus at the crown of the head]. That is why you see me jumpwith a start. Sometimes, again, the Spiritual Current rises like a bird hoppingfrom one branch to another. The place where it rests feels like fire. . . .Sometimes the Spiritual Current moves up like a snake. Going in a zigzag way, atlast it reaches the head and I go into samadhi. A man's spiritual consciousnessis not awakened until his Kun-dalini is aroused.\"In the Indian Vedantic manner of speech, such a consummate holy man as wasRamakrishna is known as a Paramaharhsa, \"Paramount of Supreme Wild Gander,\" inrecognition of his having realized in life the ultimate Vedantic goal ofcomplete self-identification with the Self; which is to say, with thatmetaphorical \"Lone Wild Gander\" whose invisible flight throughout the world ofhis creation has been described in the above-quoted lines from theBrihaddranyaka Upanishad.It is relevant to recall at this point, that in Bushman rock paintings thereleased spirits of the trance dancers, as well as of the dead, are representedas flying antelope men, called in the literature, alites, or \"flying bucks.\"Also to be noticed again is the shamanic figure pictured in the most sacredrecess of the cavern of Lascaux, lying in trance before the vision of aneviscerated bull, wearing a bird mask, and with the figure of a bird on the topof what appears to be a shamanic staff at his side.The image of a bird in flight is a well-nigh universal sign of the Holy Spirit,whether as in the Christian figure of the Holy Ghost descending in the form of adove, both at the moment of Mary's conception of the Word, and again, at thetime of the baptism of her Son, when the heavens opened \"and he saw the Spiritof God descending like a dove and alighting on him\" (Matthew 3:16); or as in themetaphorical Indian figure of the Lone Wild Gander (ekahamsa), as signifyingthe non-dual ground of all being (brahman) which is in each and every thing theone enlivening Self (atman).\"Striking down in sleep what is bodily,Sleepless, he looks down upon the sleeping senses.'Such is the experience of the knowing subject released in trance to the rapturesof the untrammeled eye of vision. Suddenly unloaded of the material weight ofcommitments to the field of waking consciousness:\"A god, he puts forth for himself innumerable forms.\"The leading reference of the Upanishad here is, of course, to the Self (atman)as identical with the sole, non-dual ground of all being and becoming (brahman),putting forth the phenomenal universe in a continuous act of creation. Alsoimplied, however, as recognized in Sankara's application of the passage, is areference to the microcosmic aspect of the Self, as the indwelling immortal partof each and every living being, enjoying in each in the Dreaming State acreative life analogous to that of the macrocosmic creator. The two creations,though analogous, are not exactly comparable, since the field of manifestationof the microcosmic Self is confined to the mental sphere of the dreamer, whereasthat of the macrocosmic Creator extends to the grossly visible pleasure groundof the daylight consciousness that is \"Common to All Men.\" Moreover, thechariots, spans and roads, blisses, pleasures and delights, envisioned by themicrocosmic Self are not original to its inward field of exquisitemanifestations, but have been imprinted, carried and recollected from an outwardfield of already manifest gross phenomena. And still further, the inward eye ofthe mind by which those forms are beheld is not of the immortal, creative,universally indwelling Self (atman), but of an intervening, historicallyconditioned ego (aham-kara: \"making the sound I\"), which is not only bounded byignorance (avidya) of their true nature, but also attached to them with desires(kama) and impulses to action (karma).Freud's name for the same ground and source of all human willing is the id, the\"It,\" which he characterized (as summarized by his authorized translator A. A.Brill), as \"an unorganized chaotic mentality . . . the sole aim of which is thegratification of all needs, the alleviation of hunger, self-preservation andlove, the preservation of the species. ... As the child grows older,\" Brill'sexplication continues, \"that part of the id which comes in contact with theenvironment through the senses learns to know the inexorable reality of theouter world and becomes modified into what Freud calls the ego. This ego,possessing awareness of the environment, henceforth strives to curb the lawlessid tendencies whenever they attempt to assert themselves incompatibly.\" Aneurosis may result from \"a conflict between the ego and the id,\" or from \"aconflict between the ego and the super-ego [the internalized parental warningsand ethical laws of a local society].\" In a psychosis, the illness results from\"a conflict between the ego and the outer world.\"\"Psychoanalysis,\" we are informed in Freud's classic essay on The Ego and the Id(published 1923), \"is an instrument to assist the ego in its progressiveconquest of the id.\" \"The id is completely amoral, the ego is striving to becomemoral; the super-ego can become hypermoral and as ferocious then as the id.\"In contrast, according to Sankara's view and in general throughout thephilosophical and yogic systems of India, no functional conflict of this kindbetween id and ego is recognized. Freud's id corresponds to the Indianreincarnating will to life, the so-called jiva (compare Latin vivo, \"I live, amalive, have life\"; English vivacious and Greek bios, \"life\"), that chaoticbundle of motivating desires (kama), impulses to action (karma), and ignoranceof the true nature of being (avidya) which \"puts on bodies and puts them off asa man puts on and puts off clothing\" (Bhagavad Gita 2.22). Freud's super-ego isthe Indian dharma: the body of local laws and customs that has becomeinternalized as constituting the dreamer's sense of his duties to society; andFreud's ego, understood as that part of the id which has become conscious of\"the inexorable reality of the outer world,\" is known in Sanskrit, also, as\"ego,\" aham —except that in India its commitment to what Freud regarded as \"theinexorable reality of the outer world\" is recognized as itself the maintainingcause of that state of ignorance (avidya) of the jiva which it is the functionof yoga and philosophy to illuminate and dissolve. The compulsive force ofdharma will then also be annulled. And so, in diametric contrast to the Freudianformula of \"where there is id there shall be ego,\" is Sankara's ideal, as statedin his Vedantic classic, \"The Crest Jewel of Discrimination\":\"Shedding the activities of ego and its adjuncts, abandoning all attachments inrealization of the Highest Truth (paramartha), be released from dualitiesthrough enjoyment of the bliss of the Self (atman) and rest in brahman; for thouhast there attained thy full Self-Nature unqualified (purnatmana brahmaninirvikalpa).In contrast to this opening of ego (aham) to the light and force of its ownlarger reality in the Self (atman), the psychoanalytic Freudian approach to theinterpretation of dreams, and therewith of mythology and the arts, remainsenclosed in a tight horizon of egocentric day-residues from both the recent andmost distant past.For not only is the Preconscious (Pes.) motivated bywish-impulses from the Waking State (jdgarita-sthdna), but so too is theUnconscious (Ucs.), since, as diagnosed by Freud, this occult source of allspiritual afflictions is but a manifold of libidinous desires and fearsrepressed from infancy and reflecting the individual's earliest Waking-Stateexperiences of a mother and a father (Oedipus Complex). Freudian psychotherapy,therefore, is fixated in the past, its method being to uncover, not the zone ofinfinite light from which the energies of the psyche derive, but thosesuppressed infantile memories of specific traumatic scenes and events throughwhich the light has been, so to say, deflected and occluded, the ideal ofego-enlightenment being of adjustment to the inexorable demands of both thelocal moral order (superego) and the \"outer world.\"Carl G. Jung, in his approach to the interpretation of dreams and the imagery ofmyth, recognized two distinct spheres of relevancy, as functional of twoorders or levels of the unconscious: (1) a historically and biographicallyconditioned personal unconscious, corresponding to the Freudianid-to-ego-bounded system, and (2) a transpersonal, instinctive, biologicallygrounded collective unconscious, matching Sankara's understanding of the forceof the Wild Gander, the macrocosmic atman, in the sphere of consciousness ofDeep Dreamless Sleep (sushupta-sthdna).\"There are present,\" states Jung, \"in every individual, besides his personalmemories, the great 'primordial' images, as Jacob Burckhardt once aptly calledthem, the inherited powers of human imagination as it has been since timeimmemorial. The fact of this inheritance explains the truly amazing phenomenonthat certain motifs from myths and legends repeat themselves the world over inidentical forms. It also explains why it is that our mental patients canreproduce exactly the same images and associations that are known to us from theold texts.\"\"The collective unconscious is a part of the psyche,\" he states further, \"whichcan be negatively distinguished from a personal unconscious by the fact that itdoes not, like the latter, owe its existence to personal experience andconsequently is not a personal acquisiton. While the personal unconscious ismade up essentially of contents which have at one time been conscious but whichhave disappeared from consciousness through having been forgotten or \"repressed,the contents of the collective unconscious have never been in consciousness andtherefore have never been individually acquired, but owe their existenceexclusively to heredity. Whereas the personal unconscious consists for the mostpart of complexes, the content of the collective unconscious is made upessentially of archetypes.\"The concept of the archetype, which is an indispensable correlate of the ideaof the collective unconscious, indicates the existence of definite forms in thepsyche which seem to be present always and everywhere. Mythological researchcalls them 'motifs'; in the psychology of primitives they correspond toLevy-Bruhl's concept of'representations collectives,' and in the field ofcomparative religion they have been defined by Hubert and Mauss as 'categoriesof the imagination.' Adolf Bastian long ago called them 'elementary' or'primordian thoughts.' From these references it should be clear enough that myidea of the archetype—literally a pre-existent form—does not stand alone but issomething that is recognized and named in other fields of knowledge.\"And with respect, then, to the imagery specifically of the Dream State(svapnasthana): \"The inner image,\" states Jung, \"is a complex structure made upof the most varied material from the most varied sources. It is no conglomerate,however, but a homogeneous product with a meaning of its own. The image is acondensed expression of the psychic situation as a whole, and not merely, noreven predominantly, of unconscious content pure and simple. It undoubtedly doesexpress unconscious contents, but not the whole of them, only those that aremomentarily constellated. This constellation is the result of the spontaneousactivity of the unconscious on the one hand and of the momentary conscioussituation on the other, which always stimulates the activity of relevantsubliminal material and at the same time inhibits the irrelevant. Accordinglythe image is an expression of the unconscious as well as the conscious situationof themoment. The interpretation of its meaning, therefore, can start neither from theconscious alone nor from the unconscious alone, but only from their reciprocalrelationship.\"I call the image primordial when it possesses an archaic character. I speak ofits archaic character when the image is in striking accord with familiarmythological motifs. It then expresses material primarily derived from thecollective unconscious, and indicates at the same time that the factorsinfluencing the conscious situation of the moment are collective rather thanpersonal. A personal image has neither an archaic character nor a collectivesignificance, but expresses contents of the personal unconscious and apersonally conditioned conscious situation.\"The primordial image, elsewhere also termed archetype, is always collective,i.e., it is at least common to entire peoples or epochs. In all probability themost important mythological motifs are common to all times and races; I have, infact, been able to demonstrate a whole series of motifs from Greek mythology inthe dreams and fantasies of purebred Negroes suffering from mental disorders.\"The transformations of consciousness that occur when the mind, disengaged fromits normal state of attachment to forms of the past, is through identificationwith luminous apparitions of the intermediate dreaming state transported towarda realization of non-duality in infinite being, are in the Upanishad termed,respectively, A. Visva or Vaisvanara, \"Pervasive, Prevailing,\" or \"Common to allMen\"; U. Taijasa, \"Originating from and Consisting oitejas, 'Light'\"; and M.Prajna, the \"Knower.\" As stated by the sage Guadapada (c. a.d. seventh century):\"Visva is he who cognizes with the senses; Taijasa, he who cognizes in the mind;Prajna, he who constitutes the infinite space (akasa) in the heart. Thus the oneSelf (atman) is [experienced as] threefold in the body.\"The condition of Prajna has been described in the Upanishad as \"en-sheathed inbliss\" (anandamaya), \"enjoying bliss\" (anandabhuj). Hence, when the minddisengaged from the \"gross enjoyments\" of the Waking State (jagarita-sthana),transported by way of the luminous enjoyments of the Dreaming State(svapnasthana), approaches in exquisite solitude the condition oiPrajha, innon-dual identification with the atman, it is overtaken by a surpassing rapturewhich is of the order of a trance-revelation. And it typically is out ofecstatic transports of this kind that works of visionary arts derive.Unit IIWhere People Lived Legends: American Indian Myths_ MythogenesisJOSEPH CAMPBELLIn this selection, Joseph Campbell is concerned with the architecture of myth.He relates a story by Black Elk, an Oglala Sioux medicine man, to show how thetales timeless, placeless theme can also be found in Greek mythology and in theOld and New Testaments. Thereby, he demonstrates that such myths and themetaphors on which they are based, are transformed through time, but theunderlining structures of the myth remain constant.AN AMERICAN INDIAN LEGENDIf an authority on architecture, looking at the buildings of New York, were toobserve that most of the older ones were of brick, then, viewing the ruins ofancient Mesopotamia, remarked that the buildings were all of brick, and finally,visiting Ceylon, made the point that many of the early temples were of brick,should we say that this man had an eye for architecture? It is true that bricksappear in many parts of the world; true, also, that a study might be made of thedifferences between the bricks of Ceylon, those of ancient Sumer, those, say ofthe Roman aqueducts still standing in southern France, and those of the city ofNew York. However, these observations about brick are not all that we shouldlike to hear about the architecture of the cities of the world.Now let me suggest a problem in the architecture of myth.Early one morning, long ago, two Sioux Indians with their bows and arrows wereout hunting on the North American plains; and as they were standing on a hill,peering about for game, they saw in the distance something coming toward them ina strange and wonderful manner. When the mysterious thing drew nearer, theyperceived that it was a very beautiful woman, dressed in white buckskin, bearinga bundle on her back, and one of the men immediately became lustful. He told hisfriend of his desire, but the other rebuked him, warning that this surely was noordinary woman. She had come close now and, setting her bundle down, called tothe first to approach her. When he did so, he and she were covered suddenly by acloud and when this lifted there was the woman alone, with the man nothing butbones at her feet, being eaten by terrible snakes. \"Behold what you see!\" shesaid to the other. \"Now go tell your people to prepare a large ceremonial lodgefor my coming. I wish to announce to them something of great importance.\"The young man returned quickly to his camp; and the chief, whose name wasStanding Hollow Horn, had several tepees taken down, sewn together, and madeinto a ceremonial lodge. Such a lodge has twenty-eight poles, of which thecentral pole, the main support, is compared to the Great Spirit, Wakan Tanka,the supporter of the universe. The others represent aspects of creation; for thelodge itself is a likeness of the universe.\"If you add four sevens,\" said the old warrior priest, Black Elk, from whom thislegend was derived, \"you get twenty-eight. The moon lives twenty-eight days andthis is our month. Each of these days of the month represents something sacredto us: two of the days represent the Great Spirit; two are for Mother Earth;four are for the four winds; one is for the Spotted Eagle; one for the sun; andone for the moon; one is for the Morning Star; and four are for the four ages;seven for our seven great rites; one is for the buffalo; one for the fire; onefor the water; one for the rock; and finally, one is for the two-legged people.If you add all these days up you will see that they come to twenty-eight. Youshould know also that the buffalo has twenty-eight ribs, and that in our warbonnets we usually wear twenty-eight feathers. You see, there is a significancefor everything, and these are the things that are good for men to know and toremember.\"This wonderful old Oglala Sioux priest explained to the young scholar, JosephEpes Brown, who had come to the Pine Ridge Reservation (South Dakota) expresslyto gain knowledge first hand of the mystic dimension of American Indianmythology, the image of the man consumed by snakes. \"Any man who is attached tothe senses and things of this world,\" he said, \"is one who lives in ignoranceand is being consumed by the snakes that represent his own passions.\"One is reminded by this Indian image of the Greek legend of the young hunterActaeon, who, in quest of game, following a forest stream to its source,discovered there the goddess Artemis bathing, perfectly naked, in a pool: andwhen she saw that he looked lustfully upon her, she transformed him into a stagthat was then pursued by his own hounds, torn to pieces, and consumed. And notonly are the two legends comparable, but the old Sioux priest's interpretationof his own accords with the sense of the Greek. Moreover, his interpretation ofthe symbolism of the ceremonial lodge suggests a number of themes familiar to usas well: so that we are moved to wonder what the explanation of these accordsmight be.When the people of Black Elk's legend had made their large ceremonial lodge thatwas symbolically a counterpart of the universe, they all gathered within it,extremely excited, wondering who the mysterious woman could be and what shewished to say to them. Suddenly, she appeared in the door, which was facingeast, and proceeded sunwise around the central pillar: south, west, north, andagain east. \"For is not the south the source of life?\" the old teller of thetale explained. \"And does not man advance from there toward the setting sun ofhis life? Does he not then arrive, if he lives, at the source of light andunderstanding, which is the east? And does he not return to where he began, tohis second childhood, there to give back his life to all life, and his flesh tothe earth whence it came? The more you think about this,\" he suggested, \"themore meaning you will see in it.\"This sturdy old son of the American earth, now nearly blind, had been born inthe early eighteen-sixties, fought as a young man at the battle of the LittleBighorn and the battle of Wounded Knee, had known the great chiefs, SittingBull, Crazy Horse, Red Cloud, and American Horse, and at the time of thisretelling of his legend, the winter of 1947-1948, was Keeper of the Sacred Pipe.He had received the treasured talisman, together with its legend, from theearlier Keeper, Elk Head, who had prophesied at that time that as long as thepipe was used and its legend known, the Oglala Sioux would live, but as soon asthe legend was forgotten, they would lose their center and perish.The pipe and its legend, then, were of indeterminate age, anonymous, practicallytimeless. Yet actually, more closely regarded, they could not have been mucholder than a couple of hundred years; for the Oglala Sioux did not migrate tothe plains and become buffalo hunters there until the end of the seventeenthcentury—1680 or so. They had formerly been a forest folk of the UpperMississippi, a region of lakes and marshes, where they traveled in birchbarkcanoes. And yet, as already remarked, although we may never have heard before ofthe Sacred Pipe of the Oglala Sioux, or have numbered the buffalo's ribs, allthe elements of this myth are curiously familiar. We recognize the bricks, so tosay, though the way in which they have been put together is surprising.The ceremonial lodge is exactly comparable to a temple, oriented to thequarters, with its central pole symbolic of the world axis. \"We have establishedhere the center of the earth,\" the nearly blind old medicine man explained tohis attentive listener, \"and this center, which in reality is everywhere, is thedwelling place of Wakan Tanka.\" But this figure of the \"center\" that is\"everywhere\" is a counterpart, exactly, of that of the hermetic twelfth-century\"Book of the Twenty-four Philosophers,\" from which Nicholas Cusanus and a numberof other distinguished European thinkers—Alan de Lille, Rabelais, GiordanoBruno, Pascal, and Voltaire, for example—derived their definition of God as \"anintelligible sphere, whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere.\" Itis amazing indeed to catch the echo of such a metaphysical statement as thisfrom the lips of an absolutely illiterate old Sioux, living out his fading dayas the guardian of an aboriginal Amerindian fetish and its myth.What are we to think of all these coincidences? Whence come these timeless,placeless themes?Shall we join our voice to those who write of a great Perennial Philosophy,which, from time out of mind, has been the one, eternally true wisdom of thehuman race, revealed somehow from on high? How came this, then, with all itssymbols, to the Sioux? Or shall we seek our answer, rather, in somepsychological theory, like many of the most distinguished nineteenth-centuryethnologists—Bastian, for instance, Tylor, and Frazer—attributing suchcross-cultural accords to \"the effect,\" as Frazer put it, \"of similar causesacting alike on the similar constitution of the human mind in differentcountries and under different skies\"? Do such images, that is to say, take formnaturally in the psyche? Can they be assumed and even expected to appearspontaneously, in dreams, in visions, in mythological figurations, any place onearth, wherever man has made his home?Or must it be said, on the contrary, that, since mythological orders—likearchitectural orders—serve specific, historically conditioned culturalfunctions, where any two can be shown to be homologous they must be assumed tobe historically related? Can the Greeks and the Sioux, that is to say, besupposed tohave received any part or parts of their mythological heritages from a commonsource?Or, finally, shall we simply set aside this whole question of shared motifs(whether religiously, psychologically, or historically explained) as unworthy ofa scientist's speculation, since—as a number of important field-anthropologistsnow hold—myths and rituals are functions of local social orders, hencemeaningless out of context and, consequently, not to be abstracted and comparedacross cultural lines? Comparisons of that sort, enjoyed by dilettantes andamateurs, are, according to this view, neither significant nor of interest to aproperly tutored scientific intelligence.Let us look further, with an uncommitted eye, and try to judge for ourselves.We note in Black Elk's commentary to his legend the formula four times seven,giving twenty-eight supports of the universe, the numbers four and seven beingstandard symbols of totality in the iconographies of both the Orient and theOccident; and this game of sacred numbers itself is a shared trait worthremarking. One of the twenty-eight supports is in the center of the great tepee,as the axis, the pivot of the universe. The number surrounding it then istwenty-seven: three times nine: three times three times three. One thinks of thepsychologist C. G. Jung's numerous discussions of the symbolism of the four andthree. One thinks of the nine choirs of angels (three times three) that surroundand celebrate the central throne of the Trinity. Three is the number of time:past, present, and future; four is the number of space: east, south, west, andnorth. Space (four) and time (three) constitute the field—the universe—in whichall phenomenal forms become manifest and disappear. (Another way would be tothink of the vertical—above, here, and below—plus the four directions: whichagain yields three plus four.) The number four recurs in the \"sacred turn,\" theclockwise circumambulation of the center, which is here associated not only withthe four directions but also with the life stages of the individual, so that thesymbolism is applied as well to the microcosm as to the macrocosm: the two beingtied by the related number twenty-eight to the cycle of the moon, which dies andis resurrected and is accordingly a sign of the cycle of renewal.Furthermore, as we are told, the buffalo has twenty-eight ribs and is thereforehimself a counterpart of the moon—and the universe. Do not the buffaloes returnevery year, miraculously renewed like the moon? We think of the Moon Bull of thearchaic Near East, the animal-vehicle of Osiris, Tammuz, and, in India, ofShiva. The horns of the moon suggest those of the moon-god Sin, after whom MountSinai was named, so that it should represent the cosmic mountain at the centerof the world, from the summit of which Moses descended. And his face then shonewith horns of light, like the moon, so that when he stood before the people hehad to wear a veil (Exodus 34:29-35)—like the veils of archaic kings who, forcenturies before his time, had been revered as incarnations of the self-renewingpower of the moon. At the foot of Mount Sinai, the High Priest Aaron was foundconducting a festival of the Moon Bull in the image of a golden calf, whichMoses angrily committed to the fire, ground to bits, mixed with water, andcaused the people to drink, in a kind of communion meal (Exodus32:1-20). And—remarkably—it was only after this sacrifice that, returning to themountaintop (where the earth-goddess and heaven-god are joined in eternalconnubium), he received the full assignment of the Law and promise of thePromised Land, not for himself—for he was now, himself, to become thesacrifice—but for the Holy Race.In the mythology of Christ crucified, three days in the tomb and resurrected,there is implicit the same symbolism of the moon that is three days dark. TheSacrificial Lamb, the Sacrificial Bull, and the Cosmic Buffalo: their symbol-ogywas perfectly interpreted by the old Sioux medicine man, Black Elk, when heexplained that the buffalo was symbolic of the universe in its temporal, lunaraspect, dying yet ever renewed, but also (in its twenty-eighth rib) of the GreatSpirit, which is eternal, the center that is everywhere and around which allrevolves.Chief Standing Hollow Horn—as Black Elk recounted in his tale—was seated at thewest of the lodge, the seat of honor, when the beautiful woman entered: becausethere he faced the door, the east, whence comes the light, namely wisdom, whicha leader must possess. And the woman, arriving before him, lifted the bundlefrom her back and held it out to him with both hands.\"Behold this bundle,\" she said, \"and always love it! It is lela wakan [verysacred], and you must treat it as such. No impure man should ever be allowed tosee it; for within this bundle there is a very holy pipe. With this pipe youwill, during the years to come, send your voices to Wakan Tanka, your Father andGrandfather.\"She drew forth the pipe and with it a round stone, which she placed on theground. Holding the pipe with its stem to the heavens, she said: \"With thissacred pipe you will walk upon the Earth; for the Earth is your Grandmother andMother, and she is sacred. Every step that is taken upon her should be as aprayer. The bowl of this pipe is of red stone; it is the Earth. Carved in thestone and facing the center is a buffalo calf, who represents all the quadrupedswho live upon your Mother. The stem of the pipe is of wood, and this representsall that grows upon the Earth. And these twelve feathers that hang here, wherethe stem fits into the bowl, are feathers of the Spotted Eagle. They representthat eagle and all the winged things of the air. When you smoke this pipe allthese things join you, everything in the universe: all send their voices toWakan Tanka, the Great Spirit, your Grandfather and Father. When you pray withthis pipe you pray for and with all things.\"The proper use of the pipe, as expounded by its guardian priest, required thatit should be ceremonially identified with both the universe and oneself. Fromthe fire in the center of the lodge, the fire symbolic of Wakan Tanka, anattendant with a split stick lifted a coal, which he placed before the Keeper ofthe Pipe. The latter, holding in his left hand the pipe, took with his right apinch of a sacred herb, and elevating this to heaven four times, prayed:\"O Grandfather, Wakan Tanka, I send you, on this sacred day of yours, thisfragrance that will reach to the heavens above. Within this herb is the Earth,this great island; within it is my Grandmother, my Mother, and all four-legged,winged, and two-legged creatures who walk in a holy [wakan] manner. Thefragrance of this herb will cover the entire universe. O Wakan Tanka, bemerciful to all.\"The bowl of the pipe was then held over the burning aromatic herb in such a waythat the fragrant smoke, entering, passed through the stem and out the end,toward heaven. Thus Wakan Tanka was the first to smoke, and the pipe, by thatact, was purified. It was then filled with tobacco that had been offered in thesix directions: to the west, north, east, and south, to heaven, and to earth.\"In this manner,\" said the medicine man, \"the whole universe is placed in thepipe.\" And, finally, the man who fills the pipe should identify it with himself.There is a prayer in which this identity is described. It runs as follows:These people had a pipe,Which they made to be their body.O my Friend, I have a pipe that I have made to be my body;If you also make it to be your body,You shall have a body free from all causes of death.Behold the joint of the neck, they said,That I have made to be the joint of my own neck.Behold the mouth of the pipe, That I have made to be my mouth.Behold the right side of the pipe,That I have made to be the right side of my body.Behold the spine of the pipe,That I have made to be my own spine.Behold the left side of the pipe,That I have made to be the left side of my body.Behold the hollow of the pipe,That I have made to be the hollow of my body. . . .Use the pipe as an offering in your supplications, And your prayers shall bereadily granted.This game, this holy game of purifying the pipe, expanding the pipe to includethe universe, identifying oneself with the pipe, and igniting it in symbolicoffering, is a ritual act of the kind represented, also, in Vedic Brahmanicceremonials, where the altar and every implement of the sacrifice is identifiedallegorically with both the universe and the sacrificing individual. \"He who isin the fire,\" we read in the Maitri Upanishad, for example, \"he who is here inthe heart, and he who is yonder in the sun: he is one.\" Likewise, in the greatChan-dogya: \"Now the light that shines higher than this heaven, on the backs ofall, on the backs of everything, in the highest worlds, than which there are nohigher— verily, that is the same as this light which is here within a person. .. .\"One should reverence the mind as brahman. —Thus with reference to oneself. Andnow, with reference to the gods: One should reverence space asbrahman. —That is the two-fold instruction with reference to oneself and withreference to the gods.\"That brahman has four quarters. One quarter is speech. One quarter is breath.One quarter is the eye. One quarter is the ear.—Thus with reference to oneself.And now, with reference to the gods: One quarter is Fire. One quarter is Wind.One quarter is the Sun. One quarter is the quarters of the sky.—That is thetwofold instruction with reference to oneself and with reference to the gods.\"Now, as we have heard, the feathers of the sacred pipe are those of the spottedeagle, which is the highest-flying bird in North America and thereforeequivalent to the sun. Its feathers are the solar rays—and their number istwelve, the number, exactly, that we too associate with the cycle of the sun inthe months of the solar year and twelve signs (three times four) of the zodiac.There is a verse in a sacred song of the Sioux: \"The Spotted Eagle is coming tocarry me away.\" Do we not think here of the Greek myth of Ganymede transportedby Zeus, who came in the form of an eagle to carry him away? \"Birds,\" declaresDr. Jung in one of his dissertations on the process of individuation, \"arethoughts and flights of the mind. . . . The eagle denotes the heights ... it isa well-known alchemistic symbol. Even the lapis, the rebis [the PhilosophersStone], made out of two parts, and thus often hermaphroditic, as a coalescenceof Sol and Luna, is frequently represented with wings, in this way standing forpremonition—intuition. All these symbols in the last analysis depict that stateof affairs that we call the Self, in its role of transcending consciousness.\"Such a reading nicely accords with the part played by our North American spottedeagle in the rites of the Indian tribes. It explains, also, the wearing of eaglefeathers. They are counterparts of the golden rays of a European crown. They arethe rays of the spiritual sun, which the warrior typifies in his life.Furthermore—as we have been told—their number in the war bonnet is twenty-eight,the number of the lunar cycle of temporal death and renewal, so that here Soland Luna have again been joined.There can be no doubt whatsoever that this legend of the Sioux is fashioned ofat least some of the same materials and thoughts as the great mythologies of theOld World—Europe, Africa, and Asia. The parallels both in sense and in imageryare too numerous and too subtle to be the consequence of mere accident. And wehave not yet finished!For when the holy woman, standing before Chief Standing Hollow Horn, had taughthim how to use the pipe, she touched its bowl to the round stone that she hadplaced upon the ground. \"With this pipe you will be bound,\" she said, \"to allyour relatives: your Grandfather and Father, your Grandmother and Mother.\"The Great Spirit, the medicine man explained, is our Grandfather and Father; theEarth, our Grandmother and Mother. As Father and Mother, they are the producersof all things; as Grandfather and Grandmother, however, beyond ourunderstanding. These suggest the two modes of considering God that Rudolf Otto,in The Idea of the Holy, has termed the \"ineffable\" and the \"rational\": thesame, as Joseph Epes Brown points out in his commentary on Black Elk's rite,that are referred to in India as nirguna and saguna brahman, the \"Absolutewithout Qualities\" and the \"Absolute with Qualities,\" respectively That beyondnames, forms, and relationships, and That personified as \"God.\"\"This round rock,\" the very beautiful woman continued, \"which is made of thesame red stone as the bowl of the pipe, your Father Wakan Tanka has also givento you. It is the Earth, your Grandmother and Mother, and it is where you willlive and increase. This Earth which he has given to you is red, and thetwo-legged people who live upon the Earth are red; and the Great Spirit has alsogiven to you a red day, and a red road.\"\"The 'red road,'\" Joseph Brown explains, \"is that which runs north and south andis the good or straight way, for to the Sioux the north is purity and the southis the source of life. . . . On the other hand, there is the 'blue' or 'blackroad' of the Sioux, which runs east and west and which is the path of error anddestruction. He who travels on this path, Black Elk has said, is 'one who isdistracted, who is ruled by his senses, and who lives for himself rather thanfor his people. \" The latter was the road followed by the man at the opening ofthe story, who was eaten by snakes. And so we notice now that even the ethicalpolarity that we recognize between the bird and serpent as allegoric of thewinged flight of the spirit and the earth-bound commitment of the passions, hasbeen suggested here, as well.\"These seven circles that you see upon the red stone,\" the woman said,\"represent the seven rites in which the pipe will be used. ... Be good to thesegifts and to your people; for they are wakan [holy]. With this pipe thetwo-legged people will increase and there will come to them all that is good.\"She described the rites and then turned to leave. \"I am leaving now, but I shalllook back upon your people in every age; for, remember,\" she said, \"in me thereare four ages: and at the end I shall return.\"Passing around the lodge, in the sunwise way, she left, but after walking ashort distance, looked back toward the people and sat down. When she got upagain, they were amazed to see that she had turned into a young red and brownbuffalo calf. The calf walked a little distance, lay down and rolled, lookedback at the people, and when she got up was a white buffalo. This buffalo walkeda little distance, rolled upon the ground, and when it rose was black. The blackbuffalo walked away, and when it was far from the people it turned, bowed toeach of the four directions, and disappeared over a hill.The wakan woman had thus been the feminine aspect of the cosmic buffalo itself.She herself was the earthly red buffalo-calf represented on the pipe bowl, butalso its mother, the white buffalo, and its grandmother, the black. She had goneto be restored to her eternal portion, having rendered to man those sacredthoughts and visible things by which he was to be joined to his own eternity,which is here and now, within him and all things, in this living world._ The Metaphorical JourneyJOSEPH CAMPBELLIn this selection, Joseph Campbell discusses the symbols of an important Navajosand painting in terms of its impact on the entire society. He identifiesuniversal symbols as distinguished from local and historical transformations ofmetaphorical images. He explains the extent to which myths have been transformedthrough time.in the Navaho sand painting the bounded area is equivalent to the interior of atemple, an Earthly Paradise, where all forms are to be experienced, not in termsof practical relationships, threatening or desirable, evil or good, but as themanifestations of powers supporting the visible world and which, though notrecognized in practical living, are everywhere immediately at hand and of one'sown nature. The painting is used in a blessing ceremony, for healing, or toimpart the courage and spiritual strength requisite to the endurance of someordeal, or for the performance of some difficult task. The dry painting is ofcolored sand strewn (with amazing skill and speed) upon the dirt floor of anative dwelling, or hogan. Neighbors and friends have assembled, and for aperiod of one to five (in many other rituals, nine) continuous nights and daysof chanting, prayer, and metaphorical acts, the patient or initiate isceremonially identified in mind and heart and costume with the mythologicalprotagonist of the relevant legend. He or she actually enters physically intothe painting, not simply as the person whose friends and neighbors havesolicitously assembled, but equally as a mythic figure engaged in an archetypaladventure of which everyone present knows the design. For it is the archetypaladventure of them all in the knowledge of their individual lives as grounded andparticipative in a beloved and everlasting pattern. Moreover, all the charactersrepresented in the ceremonial are to be of the local landscape and experience,become mythologized, so that through a shared witnessing of the ceremonial theentire company is renewed in accord with the nature and beauty of theirspiritually instructive world.The conformity of the imagery of this particular sand painting to the sense andsymbolized experiences of the yogic sushumna is certainly astonishing, but notmore so than many other concordancies in the myths and ritual arts of peoplesacross the world. The axial Great Corn Plant corresponds here to the sushumna;the footprints represent a spiritual ascent along the mystic way known to theNavaho as the Pollen Path. There is a verse from a sacred chant:In the house of life I wander On the pollen path, With a god of cloud I wanderTo a holy place.With a god ahead I wander And a god behind. In the house of life I wander On thepollen path.The Great Corn Plant's upper half is marked by a lightning flash, whichimmediately suggests the oriental vajra (\"thunderbolt of enlightenment\") ofHindu and Buddhist iconography. It strikes to the exact center of the way, whichcorresponds (if we count the leaf-marked stages, the tassel above, and the rootbelow) exactly to the fourth chakra, andhata, where the sound is heard that isnot made by any two things striking together. In Navaho myths and legends thegod known as Sun Bearer, Tsohanoai, possesses lightning-arrows. His domicile isabove, in the sky, and when his twin sons, conceived of him by an earthlyvirgin, Changing Woman, arrived to receive from him the power and weapons withwhich to rid the world of monsters, the solar power of which they then becamepossessed was so great that when they returned to earth it had to be modified bya deity known as Hastyeyalti (Talking God), maternal grandfather of thepantheon, in whom male and female powers are combined. In the sand painting therealm of operation of this second god is represented by a modified rainbow oftwo colors, red and blue (here reproduced brick red and blue-gray), symbolicrespectively of solar energy and of water and the moon. The high place ontowhich the Twins descended from the heavenly house of their father to earth wasthe central mountain of the world (locally, Mt. Taylor in New Mexico; height,11,302 feet) and the corresponding station in the painting is at Chakra 4,andhata. Moreover, the root of the corn plant is threefold, like Yuktatrivenl inthe mul-ddhdra. The pollen path commences lower right and is of two colors, likethe modified rainbow (or like the moon, which is of both matter and light). Butat the turn between the Spirit Bringers the path becomes yellow and single (likethe fire of the blended breaths, exploding to ascend the sushumnd); after which,in a sacred way, to an accompaniment of chants and prayer, the sanctuary isentered.The parallelism of the tantric visionary ascent of the sushumnd and theritu-ally controlled transit of the Navaho Pollen Path is not simple to explain.We know that in Tibetan tantric colleges such as Gyudto in Lhasa, a strictlycontrolled tradition of ritualized sand painting was practiced until thecalamity of 1959. We know also that the Navaho are a people of Athapascan stock,from northwesternmost North America, who migrated to the Southwest some timearound the twelfth century a.d. The Athapascans of the Canadian Northwest,however, do not practice sand painting. The Navaho seem to have acquired the artfrom the Pueblo tribes around whose villages they settled. Any relationshipbetween the Pueblos of New Mexico and the great monasteries of Lhasa isimpossible, not only to document, but even to imagine. We are thrown back,therefore, for the present at least, upon the academically unpopularpsychological explanation of the undeniable parallelism of these two visionaryjourneys, one, of an ecstatic, immediately visionary kind, the other, by way ofa tribal ceremonial.That the experience of an ascent of the sushumnd is of a psychological order ishardly questionable. And that the visions are culturally conditioned (as are allvisions and all dreams) is certain; for every petal of the envisioned lotuses,from the four petals of the miilddhdra to the two oiajiia and thousandsofsahasrdra, bears a letter of the Sanskrit alphabet. Yet descriptions of thelotuses by those who have experienced them carry the conviction of a reality,not indeed of a gross material (sthula), but of a subtle (sukshma), dreamlike,visionary kind.\"They are formed of Consciousness,\" said Ramakrishna, \"like a tree made ofwax—the branches, twigs, fruits, and so forth all of wax.\" \"One cannot see themwith the physical eyes. One cannot take them out by cutting open the body.\"\"Just before my attaining this state of mind,\" he told his company of followers,\"it had been revealed to me how the Kundalini is aroused, how the lotuses of thedifferent centers blossom forth, and how all this culminates in samadhi. This isa very secret experience. I saw a boy twenty-two or twenty-three years old,exactly resembling me, enter the sushumna nerve and commune with the lotuses,touching them with his tongue. He began with the center at the anus and passedthrough the centers at the sexual organ, navel, and so on. The different lotusesof those centers—four-petalled, six-petalled, ten-petalled, and so forth—hadbeen drooping. At his touch they stood erect.\"When he reached the heart—I distinctly remember it—and communed with the lotusthere, touching it with his tongue, the twelve-petalled lotus, which was hanginghead down, stood erect and opened its petals. Then he came to thesixteen-petalled lotus in the throat and the two-petalled lotus in the forehead.And last of all, the thousand-petalled lotus in the head blossomed. Since then Ihave been in this state.\"In the sand painting of the pollen path, the two colors of the \"female\" and the\"male,\" lunar and solar powers, having become one on passing between theguardian Spirit Bringers at the entrance to the sanctuary, the path, which isnow of the single color of pollen, runs to the base of the World Tree, wherethree roots or ways of entrance are confronted. Those to right and to left pointseparately to the separated Spirit Bringers, whose arms and hands gesturetogether toward the portal of the middle way. The lower half, then, of the axialcorn plant, which is to represent the graded stages of an initiation, is foundsignalized by a rainbow of the same two colors that were already of theinitiate's pollen path of virtue before its right turn to the Spirit Bringer'scall.Now a rainbow is an insubstantial apparition composed of both matter and light,formed opposite the sun by reflection and refraction of the sun's rays in dropsof rain. Thus it is at once material and immaterial, lunar and solar, as thematched colors, blue and red, here suggest. One thinks of the words of Goethe'sFaust at the end of the opening scene of Faust, Part II, where, bedded on aflowery turf, Faust wakes to an alpine sunrise and beholds across the valley arainbow spread across the face of a mighty waterfall. The sun behind him beingtoo powerful to contemplate directly, his eyes dwell, \"with rapture evergrowing,\" upon the beauty of the insubstantial image formed of the sun's lightrefracted in the whirling spray of the tumbling torrent, and he exclaims, \"Sobleibe denn die Sonne mir im Riicken! ['So let the sun remain then behind me!'].. . . Am farbigen Abglanz haben wir das Leben ['Our living is in the colorfulreflection']\"; for he is stationed at the crucial turning point of Chakra 4,andhata,where he must choose whether to pass, like an Indian yogi, to extinction in thefull blast of the sun or to rest engaged in the field of action, held to therecognition of the play of the sun's light through all the forms given life byits power!The rainbow of the sand painting ends exactly midway of the path. There thelightning strikes, and to right and to left two apparitions appear. These are ofa spiritual messenger-fly known to the Navaho as Dontso, \"Big Fly,'' and in hissecond aspect, \"Little Wind.\" In art and myth this little figure holds aprominent place, and like everything else in Navaho mythology, he is atransformation into metaphor of an actual feature of the environment. There is,namely, a local ta-chinid fly, of the species Hystricia pollinosa van der Wulp,which has the habit of lighting on a person's shoulder or on the chest just infront of the shoulder. In this role it has been admitted to the pantheon as abringer of news and guidance and as a messenger of the spirit. In its present,dual apparition, black and pale yellow, it represents separately the male andfemale energies, which in the rainbow are united. For both black and red, in thecolor system of this painting, are symbolic of male energy, while both yellowand blue are female. Black is sinister and threatening to life, yet alsoprotects. The lightning flash here is black, and Black Wind (which here appearsin the form of the black Dontso) is the power of the sun. Yellow represents, incontrast, fructification, pollen, and the powers of vegetation. Women originatedfrom a yellow corn ear, and yellow is the color of an inexhaustible food bowlsymbolizing sustenance. The black zigzag line of the lightning flash is single,whereas in the rainbow, where the male power has been tempered to the femalepower, the male is red and the female blue. Red is the color of danger, war, andsorcery, but also of their safeguards; for it is the color, as well, of blood,flesh, and nourishing meat. Blue is a color associated by the Navaho with thefructifying power of the earth, with water and with sky. Combined as here in arainbow, the two are known as \"The Sunray\" and said to stand for \"light raysemerging from a cloud when the sun is behind it. . .\"The cornstalk of this painting is blue, and upon the central corn tassel at itstop there is a bird, also blue, symbolic, it is said, of dawn, happiness, andpromise. The only ears of corn to be seen are at nodes corresponding (by analogywith sushumna) to Chakras 3 and 4, manipura and andhata, both of which areassociated with powers and realizations of the period, in a lifetime, ofmaturity: mastery and illumination, which may or may not be by coincidence.For the artist to whom we owe the reproduction of this precious document of anorally communicated tradition that is rapidly disappearing did not receive fromthe Singer (the Medicine Man) from whose Blessing Rite it was drawn aninterpretation of its symbols. We now have, however, an ample resource ofwell-collected materials authoritatively interpreted, assembled by scholarschiefly of the 1930s and 1940s (when the normal Navaho household was said tohave comprised a father and mother, one child and two anthropologists), out ofwhose publications a substantially acceptable reading of such an iconographicwork can be confidently reconstructed.My own researches in the material were undertaken in those same years of the1930s and 1940s in connection, partly, with my task of editing, for the openingof the Bollingen Series, Maud Oakes' collection of paintings from the warceremonial of the old Navaho warrior and medicine man Jeff King(1852/60(?)-1964, now buried with honors in Arlington National Cemetery), \"Wherethe Two Came to Their Father,\" published in 1943. At the same time I was at workwith Henry Morton Robinson on A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake (1944), besideshelping Swami Nikhilananda with his translation from Bengali of The Gospel ofSri Ramakrishna (1942), having just commenced the twelve-year task of editingfor the Bollingen Series four publications from the posthumous papers of mydeceased friend Heinrich Zimmer: Myths and Symbols in Indian Art andCivilization, The King and the Corpse, Philosophies of India, and The Art ofIndian Asia, in 2 volumes.My distinct impression throughout those years was that I was at work only onseparate chapters of a single mythological epic of the human imagination.Moreover, the epic was the same as that to which I had been introduced twentyyears before in my graduate studies at Columbia University in Anthropology andEuropean romantic and medieval literatures; in Paris at the Sorbonne on theProvencal poets and Arthurian romance; and at the University of Munich inSanskrit and Far Eastern Buddhist art. Adolf Bastian's theory of a concordthroughout the mythologies of the world of certain Elementargedanken,\"elementary ideas\" was confirmed for me beyond question by these apparentlyfar-flung researches. The first task of any systematic comparison of the mythsand religions of mankind should therefore be (it seemed to me) to identify theseuniversals (or, as C. G. Jung termed them, archetypes of the unconscious) and asfar as possible to interpret them; and the second task then should be torecognize and interpret the various locally and historically conditionedtransformations of the metaphorical images through which these universals havebeen rendered.Since the archetypes, or elementary ideas, are not limited in theirdistributions by cultural or even linguistic boundaries, they cannot be definedas culturally determined. However, the local metaphors by which they have beeneverywhere connoted, the local ways of experiencing and applying their force,are indeed socially conditioned and defined. Bastian termed such localfigurations \"ethnic ideas,\" Volkergedanken, and Mircea Eliade has termed them\"hiero-phanies\" (from hieros-, \"powerful, supernatural, holy, sacred,\" plusphainein, \"to reveal, show, make known\").\"The very dialectic of the sacred,\" Eliade declares, \"tends to repeat a seriesof archetypes, so that a hierophany realized at a certain 'historical moment' isstructurally equivalent to a hierophany a thousand years earlier or later.\"Furthermore, \"hierophanies have the peculiarity of seeking to reveal the sacredin its totality, even if the human beings in whose consciousness the sacred'shows itself fasten upon only one aspect or one small part of it. In the mostelementary hierophany everything is declared. The manifestation of the sacred ina stone or a tree is neither less mysterious nor less noble than itsmanifestation as a 'god.' The process of sacralizing reality is the same; theforms taken by the process in man's religious consciousness differ.\"The Elementary Idea is grounded in the psyche; the Ethnic Idea through which itis rendered, in local geography, history, and society. A hierophany occurs whenthrough some detail, whether of a local landscape, artifact, social custom,historical memory, or individual biography, a psychological archetypeor elementary idea is reflected. The object so informed becomes therebysacra-lized, or mythologized. Correspondingly, a religious experience will berealized when there is felt an immediate sense of identification with therevelation. The sense of a mere relationship is not the same. In popular cultthe experience of relationship is frequently all that is intended. Thereby asense of social solidarity may be rendered. Through identification, however, atransformation of character is effected.METAPHORICAL IDENTIFICATIONIn the Blessing Ceremony of the Navaho the psychosomatic healing of spiritualinitiation is accomplished by means of an identification, ritually induced, ofthe patient or initiate with the mythological adventure of the pollen path inits threshold crossings into and through a sacred space and out into the worldtransformed. We have not been told by what specific prayers, chants, andmetaphorical acts the adventure is conducted. The pictorial statement of thepainting, however, indicates the transformative stages.Footprints of white cornmeal mark the path of the initiate throughout. Asalready noticed, they approach along a road that is of the two symbolic colorsof the male and female powers, fire and water, sunlight and cloud, which at theplace of the Spirit Bringers abruptly blend to one golden yellow of the color ofpollen. The same color of pollen then appears bordering the outspread sacredspace, which in this way opens to a display of the indwelling powers of pollen.There are no footprints on this part of the path. To be assumed is a thresholdpassage of the mind as it turns from secular anxieties, identifications, andexpectations, to a game of make believe (\"as if; ah oh, recalling Kant),assuming an intentionally metaphorical, mythological cast of hierophanticpersonifications. The Navaho have a number of procedures to effect thisindispensable alteration of consciousness: sweat baths, solemn recitations ofthe names of the gods to be represented in the rite, heraldic face and bodypainting, with an investiture of ornaments such as the god with whom thecandidate is to identify would be wearing. The ordeal is an act of sacrifice.The mind is to abandon forever the whole way of relating to life which is of theknowledge of the two powers of the path only as distinct from each other, redand blue. Beyond the exit gate, returning to the world, the path is to be nolonger red and blue, but of the one color of pollen. The neighbors and friendswho have gathered to witness the occasion will experience an exaltation, butthen return to the world along the path by which they came; for theirparticipation will have been, not of identification, but of arelationship—something comparable to the attendance by a Roman Catholic familyat holy mass, whereas the initiate, nearly naked and decorated as a god, willhave become identified with the adventure, as in the way of the words of Jesusreported in the Thomas Gospel: \"Whoever drinks from My mouth shall become as Iam and I myself will become he, and the hidden things shall be revealed to him.\"When footprints reappear in the painting they are already in or on thecornstalk, and Dontso has appeared as at once female and male, yellow and black,in two aspects: the one as two and the two as one. Moreover, the path of blueandred is now beheld in the luminous form of the Sunray, no longer of solid matter,but of light and cloud.In the Hindu ascent of the sushumnd, the chakras of the lower centers areidentified, respectively, as of the elements Earth, Water, and Fire, theassociated divinities being Brahma the Creator, Vishnu as Preserver and Lover,and Shiva as the Destroyer of Obstructions to Illumination. The involved yogibecomes to such a degree absorbed in these morphogenetic archetypes that as thekundalinl ascends, the whole body below the center of concentration goes cold.As stated by Sir John Woodroffe: \"There is one simple test whether the Shakti[the energy as kundalinl] is actually aroused. When she is aroused intense heatis felt at that spot, but when she leaves a particular center the part so leftbecomes as cold and apparently lifeless as a corpse. The progress upwards maythus be externally verified by others. When the Shakti (Power) has reached theupper brain (Sahasrara) the whole body is cold and corpse-like; except the topof the skull, where some warmth is felt, this being the place where the staticand kinetic aspects of Consciousness unite.\"Kundalinl yoga practiced in this outright way, in other words, is not a game of\"as if\" and make believe, but an actual experience of psychological absorptionin a metaphysical ground of some kind, a morphogenetic field that has not yet,as far as I know, been scientifically recognized in the West except by C. G.Jung and, lately, by the physicist Rupert Sheldrake, whose works, according toone concerned scientific reviewer, ought to be burned. Ramakrishna, who surelyknew whereof he spoke, warned (as we have already learned), that this form ofyoga, not only is extremely difficult, but also should not be practiced by thelovers of God, since (in his words): \"To one who follows it even the divine playin the world becomes like a dream and appears unreal; his T also vanishes.\" AtChakra 4, andhata, where the sound OM is first heard that is not made by any twothings striking together, the element into which the yogi is absorbed is Air(vdyu, the life-breath; prdna, spiritus, pure spirit); while at Chakra 5 hedevolves into dkdsa, Space. \"Boundless am I as Space!\" exclaims the ancientsage, Ash-tavakra. \"The phenomenal world is like an empty jar [enclosing Space,which nevertheless is boundless]. Thus known, phenomenality need be neitherrenounced, accepted, nor destroyed.\"In Dante's Divina Commedia the corresponding stage of spiritual exaltationextends through all but the last three cantos of the Paradiso (I-XXX), tellingof the visionary's ecstatic ascent, led by the spirit of Beatrice (Dante'sShakti), from the garden of the Earthly Paradise on the summit of MountPurgatory, through all the ranges of space to the outermost sphere of the PrimumMobile, by which the heavens are revolved.A Light is thereabove which makes the Creatorvisible to every creature that hashis peace only in beholding Him. It spreads so wide a circle that thecircumference would be too largea girdle for the sun.Its whole expanse is made by a rayreflected from the summit of the Primum Mobile, which therefrom takes its lifeand potency.The comparable figure in the Indian system is of the ndda, the creative sound OMof the energy of the light, ever resounding in the dkdsa: beyond which \"space,\"both in Dante's concluding cantos (Paradiso XXX1-XXXIII) and in the stations sixand seven of the Indian sushumnd, the culminating experiences are, first, of thevision of one's image of God and, then, of a transcendent Light which is theenergy of the living world.In oriental art, the image, whether of the Buddha, of Brahma, of Vishnu, or ofShiva, is normally shown seated or standing upon a lotus. In Dante's vision, theTrinity with the whole heavenly host is beheld within the corolla of a radiant,pure white rose. In the Navaho sand painting the final image above and beyondthe enclosed white space of the pollen-framed ceremonial field is of a symbolicbird perched on the central tassel at the top of the sacred corn plant. Noticingthat the tassels are three, as are also the roots of the plant in the earthbelow, one is reminded that in Dante's Divina Commedia his vision of a Trinityabove is matched by his Satan in the bowels of the earth, whose head shows threefaces: the left face black, the right between white and yellow, and the middlered, signifying, respectively, in Dante's intention, ignorance, hatred, andimpotent rage, in express contrast to the wisdom, love, and omnipotence of theGodhead.In the Old Norse image of the World Ash, Yggdrasil, upon which Othin hunghimself for nine days and nights in a sacrifice of himself to Himself to gainthe wisdom of the runes (the scripture of the gods), there is an eagle perchedon the topmost branch, and beneath, a dragon gnawing at the roots, of whichthere are three. The bird is a universal symbol of the spirit and spiritualflight, as is the feather of spiritual power. In India the wild gander, harhsa,is symbolic of the dtman, the Self, and such a perfected saint as Ramakrishna isknown as a Para-mahamsa, (\"Paramount or Supreme Wild Gander\"). Jesus at themoment of his baptism saw a dove descending from the heavens. Zeus approachedLeda in the aspect of a swan. Serpents and dragons, in contrast, are of theearth, its dynamism, urges, and demonic wisdom.\"The Pharisees and the Scribes have received the keys of Knowledge,\" said theGnostic Jesus to St. Thomas and the disciples, \"they have hidden them. They didnot enter, and they did not let those enter who wished. But you, become wise asserpents and innocent as doves.\"For the two modes of consciousness are of the one life, whereas the cherubim andflaming sword have forbidden entrance, even of the \"justified,\" to the earthlygarden where the two become again one.Accordingly, in Dante's vision, Heaven and Hell are still separate, and thelower power (ethically judged) has been eternally condemned. The descent of thespirit is a fall. The life-giving demon has become a devil. The axial tree ofthe universe, around which all revolves, that is to say, is still cut in two, asit was in Yahweh's Eden of the two trees, one, of the Knowledge of Good andEvil, and the other, of the Knowledge of Eternal Life. Whereas in theunreformed,primeval archetype of the World Tree, such as appears in the Old NorseYggdra-sil and in the Navaho Blue Corn Stalk the life-giving roots and thepollen-bearing flowerings, or tassels, are of a single, organically intact,mythological image.In the metaphorical Promised Land or Earthly Paradise of the Navaho sandpainting (paradise, from the Greek paradeisos, \"enclosed park\"; Old Persianpairi, \"around,\" and daeza, \"wall,\" giving pairidaeza, \"enclosure\"), the rainbowcurve, springing red and blue from the root, covers the zone of the first threechakras to the node of the second fruiting, where lightning strikes, flashingfrom the summit. The white footprints of the ceremonial path do not identify theinitiate with either the rainbow or the lightning, only with the middle way;which is to say, apparently, that there is to be no absorption of the individualin identifications either with the gross matter of the world or with theunembodied light of sheer spirit. Both are recognized, evidently, as attributesof the Pollen Path. But the ordeal is to hold to the way between; so that evenon coming to and passing the station of the Bluebird (Paramahamsa), the path,now the color of pollen (which is the color by which the garden is enclosed),does not ascend to the sky, but turning abruptly again to the right, bears thefootprints back to the dwelling from which they came.How Many Sheep Will It Hold?BARRE TOELKENIn this selection, Barre Toelken encourages the reader to \"see\" as NativeAmericans \"see\" in order to understand that there are various alternativepatterns of perceptions. These different perceptions are important becauselearning about Navajo religion requires the learning of a whole new set ofconcepts, codes, patterns and assumptions. To understand any particularmythology and its metaphors we must learn to look carefully at the underliningassumptions of the culture \"before we can see.\"1 here are some things that one knows already if he or she has read very muchabout the native Americans. One of the most important is that there is almostnothing that can be said about \"the Indians\" as a whole. EJvery tribe isdifferent from every other in some respects, and similar in other respects, sothat nearly everything one says normally has to be qualified by footnotes. WhatI am about to say here does not admit room for that. I propose, therefore, togive a fewexamples from the Navajo culture and make some small glances at other Indiancultures that I know a little bit about; that is simply a device to keep myobservations from appearing as though they were meant to be generally applicableto Indians of the whole country.It is estimated that there were up to 2,000 separate cultures in the Northernhemisphere before the advent of the white man. Many of these groups spokemutually unintelligible languages. Anthropologists estimate that there were asmany as eighty such languages in the Pacific Northwest alone. In terms oflanguage and traditions, these cultures were very much separated from eachother; and although they have been lumped into one category by whites ever since(and that is the source of some of our problems), any given Indian will have afew things in common with some other tribes and many things not in common withothers. My generalizations are made with this in mind from the start. But onemust start somewhere in an attempt to cope with the vast conceptual gulf whichlies between Anglos in general and natives in general, for it is a chasm whichhas not often been bridged, especially in religious discussion.I do not claim, either, to be one of those rare people who have succeeded inmaking the leap—an insider, a confidant, a friend of the Red Man's CouncilFire—in short, one of those Tarzans even more rare in reality than one wouldconclude from their memoirs. But I did have the good fortune to be adopted by anold Navajo, Tsinaabaas Yazhi (\"Little Wagon\"), in southern Utah in themid-fifties during the uranium rush. I moved in with his family, learned Navajo,and lived essentially a Navajo life for roughly two years. Of course I have goneback since then on every possible occasion to visit my family, although myadopted father is now dead, as is his wife and probably 50 percent of the peopleI knew in the fifties. If one has read the Navajo statistics he knows why. Thisis not intended to be a tale of woe, however; I simply want it understood that Iwas not a missionary among the Navajo. Nor was I an anthropologist, a teacher, atourist, or any of the other things that sometimes cause people to come to knowanother group briefly and superficially. Although, indeed, at one time I had itin my mind to stay with them forever, it is probably because my culture did nottrain me to cope with almost daily confrontation with death that I was unable todo so. I learned much from them, and it is no exaggeration to say that a goodpart of my education was gained there. It was probably the most important part.\"Culture shock\" attended my return to the Anglo world even though I left theNavajos as \"un-Navajo\" as when I arrived.With that for background, though, I think I can say something about howdifferently we see things, envision things, look at things, how dissimilarlydifferent cultures try to process the world of reality, which, for many nativeAmerican tribes, includes the world of religion. In Western culture, religionseems to occupy a niche reserved for the unreal, the Otherworld, a referencepoint that is reached only upon death or through the agency of the priest. Manynative American tribes see religious experience as something that surrounds manall the time. In fact, my friends the Navajos would say that there is probablynothing that can be called nonreligious. To them, almost anything anyone islikely to do has some sort of religious significance, and many other tribesconcur.Procedurally, then, our problem is how to learn to talk about religion, even inpreliminary ways, knowing perfectly well that in one society what is consideredart may in another be considered religion, or that what is considered as healthin one culture may be religion in another. Before we can proceed, in otherwords, we need to reexamine our categories, our \"pigeonholes,\" in order to \"see\"things through someone else's set of patterns. This is the reason for the oddtitle: \"Seeing with a Native Eye.\"Through our study of linguistics and anthropology we have learned that differentgroups of people not only think in different ways, but that they often \"see\"things in different ways. Good scientific experiments can be provided, forexample, to prove that if certain ideas are offered to people in patterns whichthey have not been taught to recognize, not only will they not understand them,they often will not even see them. We see things in \"programmed\" ways. Of courseProfessor Whorf was interested in demonstrating the pervasiveness of this theorywith respect to language, and many anthropologists and linguists have hadreservations about his theories. But the experimentation continues, and there issome interesting and strong evidence that a person will look right throughsomething that he or she is not trained to see, and that different culturestrain people in different ways. I will not get into the Jungian possibilitiesthat we may be born with particularized codes as well; this is beyond my area ofexpertise. But it is clear that when we want to talk about native Americanreligion, we want to try to see it as much as possible (if it is possible) withthe \"native eye.\" That is to say, if we talk about native American religionsusing the categories of Western religions, we are simply going to see what wealready know is there. We will recognize certain kinds of experiences asreligious, and we will cancel out others. To us, for example, dance may be anart form, or it may be a certain kind of kinesis. With certain native Americantribes, dance may be the most religious act a person can perform. Thesedifferences are very significant; on the basis of this kind of culturalblindness, for example, Kluckhohn classified the Navajo coyote tales as\"secular\" primarily because they are humorous.The subtitle of this paper comes from my adopted Navajo father. My firstsignificant educational experience came when I was trying to educate him to whatthe outside world looked like. Here was an eighty- or ninety-year-old man in the1950s who had never seen a paved road or a train; he had seen airplanes flyingoverhead and was afraid of them. He had seen almost nothing of what you and Iexperience as the \"modern, advanced world.\" I decided I would try to cushion theshock for him by showing him pictures, and then I would invite him into townwith me sometime when I went to Salt Lake City. I felt he needed somepreparation for the kind of bombardment of the senses one experiences in thecity after living out in the desert.I showed him a two-page spread of the Empire State Building which appeared inLife that year. His question was, immediately, \"How many sheep will it hold?\" Ihad to admit that I didn't know, and that even if I did know, I couldn't countthat high in Navajo; and I tried to show him how big a sheep might look if youheld it up against one of those windows, but he was interested neither in myexcuses nor in my intent to explain the size of the building. When I told himwhat it was for, he was shocked. The whole concept of so many people filedtogether in one big drawer—of course he would not have used those terms—wasshocking to him. He felt that people who live so close together cannot live avery rich life, so he expected that whites would be found to be spirituallyimpoverished and personally very upset by living so close together. I tried toassure him that this was not so. Of course I was wrong. Little by little onelearns.The next episode in this stage of my learning occurred about six months later,when I was at the trading post and found a magazine with a picture of the latestjet bomber on it. I brought that to him to explain better what those things werethat flew over all the time. He asked the same question in spite of the factthere were lots of little men standing around the plane and he could see verywell how big it was. Again he said, \"How many sheep will it carry?\" I started toshrug him off as if he were simply plaguing me, when it became clear to me thatwhat he was really asking was, \"What is it good for in terms of something that Iknow to be valid and viable in the world?\" (That, of course, is not his wordingeither.) In effect, he was saying that he was not willing even to try tounderstand the Empire State Building or the bomber unless I could give thoseparticular sensations to him in some kind of patternings from which he couldmake some assessment. He was not really interested in how big they were, he wasinterested in what they were doing in the world. When I told him what the jetbomber was for, he became so outraged that he refused ever to go to town, and hedied without ever having done so as far as I know. He said that he had heardmany terrible things about the whites, but the idea of someone killing that manypeople by dropping the bomb and remaining so far out of reach that he was not indanger was just too much!The only other thing that approached such outrage, by the way, was when Iexplained to him about the toilet facilities in white houses, and I mentionedindoor toilet functions. He could hardly believe that one. \"They do that rightin the house, right inside where everyone lives?\" \"No, no, you don't understand.There is a separate room for it.\" That was even worse—that there could be aspecial place for such things. A world so neatly categorized and put in boxesreally bothered him, and he steadfastly refused to go visit it. At the time Ithought he was being what we call primitive, backward—he was dragging his feet,refusing to understand the march of science and culture. What I \"see\" now isthat, as a whole, he was simply unable to—it did not \"compute\" in the way wemight put it today; he did not \"see\" what I meant. In turn, he was trying tocall my attention to that fact, and I was not receiving the impression.I bring these matters up not because they are warm reminiscences, but becausedifficulties in communicating religious ideas are parallel to these examples.When my adopted father asked, \"How many sheep will it hold?\" he was asking,\"What is it doing here, how does it function? Where does it go? Why do suchthings occur in the world?\" We might consider the Pueblo view that in thespringtime Mother Earth is pregnant, and one does not mistreat her any more thanone might mistreat a pregnant woman. When our technologists go and try to getPueblo farmers to use steel plows in the spring, they are usually rebuffed. Forus it is a technical idea—\"Why don't you just use plows? You plow, and you get Yresults from doing so.\" For the Pueblos this is meddling with a formal religiousidea (in Edward Hall's terms). Using a plow, to borrow the Navajophrase, \"doesn't hold any sheep.\" In other words, it does not make sense in theway in which the world operates. It is against the way things really go. SomePueblo folks still take the heels off their shoes, and sometime the shoes offtheir horses, during the spring. I once asked a Hopi whom I met in that country,\"Do you mean to say, then, that if I kick the ground with my foot, it will botcheverything up, so nothing will grow?\" He said, \"Well, I don't know whether thatwould happen or not, but it would just really show what kind of person you are.\"One learns slowly that in many of these native religions, religion is viewed asembodying the reciprocal relationships between people and the sacred processesgoing on in the world. It may not involve a god. It may not be signified bypraying or asking for favors, or doing what may \"look\" religious to people inour culture. For the Navajo, for example, almost everything is related tohealth. For us health is a medical issue. We may have a few home remedies, butfor most big things we go to a doctor. A Navajo goes to the equivalent of apriest to get well because one needs not only medicine, the Navajo would say,but one needs to reestablish his relationship with the rhythms of nature. It isthe ritual as well as the medicine which gets one back \"in shape.\" The medicinemay cure the symptoms, but it won't cure you. It does not put you back in stepwith the things, back in the natural cycles—this is a job for the \"singer.\"Considering the strong psychological and spiritual role of such a person, itshould not come as a surprise that it is on spiritual (magic?) grounds, notmedicinal, that some medicinal materials are not used. For example, PeteCatches, a Sioux medicine man (who practices the Eagle \"way\" of the SacredPipe), knows about but will not employ abortion-producing plants, for such usewould run counter to and thus impede the ritualistic function of the pipeceremony, a good part of which is to help increase the live things in the world.In the reciprocative life pattern, death is not a proper ingredient.I want to go a little further into this, because these patterns, these cycles,these reciprocations that we find so prominently in native American religions,are things which for our culture are not only puzzling but often consideredabsolutely insane. It is the conflict or incongruency in patterning that oftenimpedes our understanding. Let me give a few examples of this patterning. InWestern culture—I suppose in most of the technological cultures—there has been atremendous stress on lineal patterning and lineal measurements, grid patterns,straight lines. I think one reason for this is that technological cultures havefelt that it is not only desirable but even necessary to control nature. We knowthere are very few straight lines in nature. One of the ways people can tell ifthey are controlling nature is to see that it is put in straight lines—we haveto put things \"in order.\" And so we not only put our filing cases and our booksin straight lines and alphabetical \"order,\" we also put nature in straight linesand grid patterns— our streets, our houses, our acreage, our lives, ourmeasurement of time and space, our preference for the shortest distance betweentwo points, our extreme interest in being \"on time.\"Those who have read the works of Hall and other anthropologists on theanthropology of time and space are familiar with these ideas. Each culture has akind of spatial system through which one knows by what he sees as he grows uphow close he can stand to someone else, how he is to walk in public and inprivate, where his feet are supposed to fall, where things are supposed to go.These patterns show up in verbal expressions too—we have to \"get thingsstraightened out,\" \"get things straight between us,\" make someone \"toe theline.\" We also arrange classrooms and auditoriums in some sort of lineal order(other groups might want these to be arranged in a circle). To us, having things\"in order\" means lining things up, getting things in line. We talk about\"getting straight with one another,\" looking straight into each other's eyes,being \"straight shooters.\" We even talk about the \"straight\" people vs. the\"groovy\" people. Notice how we often depict someone who is crazy with a circularhand motion around the ear. Someone who does not speak clearly \"talks incircles,\" or uses circuitous logic. We think of logic itself as being instraight lines: A plus B equals C. We look forward to the conclusion of things,we plan into the future, as though time were a sort of straight track alongwhich we move toward certain predictable goals.If one knows much about native Americans of almost any tribe, he realizes that Iam choosing, intentionally, certain lineal and grid patterns which are virtuallyunmatched in native American patterns. We learn to find each other in the houseor in the city by learning the intersection of straight lines—so many doors downthe hallway is the kitchen, or the bathroom, and we are never to confuse them.We separate them. One does not cook in the bathroom—it is ludicrous to get themmixed up. We have it all neatly separated and categorized. For most nativeAmerican groups, almost the reverse is true—things are brought together. Insteadof separating into categories of this sort, family groups sit in circles,meetings are in circles, dances are often—not always—in circles, especially thedances intended to welcome and include people. With the exception of a fewtribes such as the Pueblo peoples, who live in villages which have many straightlines, most of the tribes usually live (or lived) in round dwellings like thehogan of the Navajo, the tipi of the plains Indians, the igloo of the Eskimo.The Eastern Indians and some Northwestern tribes sometimes lived in long houses,but the families or clans sat in circles within.There is, then, a \"logical\" tendency to recreate the pattern of the circle atevery level of the culture, in religion as well as in social intercourse. Ithink the reason for it is that what makes sense, what \"holds sheep\" for manytribes, is the concept that reciprocation is at the heart of everything going onin the world. I have had Pueblo people tell me that what they are doing whenthey participate in rain dances or fertility dances is not asking help from thesky; rather, they are doing something which they characterize as a hemispherewhich is brought together in conjunction with another hemisphere. It is aparticipation in a kind of interaction which I can only characterize as sacredreciprocation. It is a sense that everything always goes this way. We are alwaysinteracting, and if we refuse to interact, or if some taboo action has caused abreak in this interaction, then disease or calamity comes about. It is assumedthat reciprocation is the order of things, and so we will expect it to keepappearing in all forms.I think that it makes anthropological and linguistic sense to say that anyculture will represent things religiously, artistically, and otherwise, the wayits members \"see\" things operating in the world. But here is where the trickcomes in. When we from one culture start looking at the patterns of anotherculture, wewill often see what our culture has trained us to see. If we look at a Navajorug, for example, we are inclined to say that Navajos use many straight lines intheir rugs. And yet if we talk to Navajos about weaving, the gesture we oftensee is a four-way back-and-forth movement; and they talk about the interactionwithin the pattern—a reciprocation. Most often the Navajo rug reciprocates itspattern from side to side and from end to end, creating mirror images. Myadopted sister, who is a very fine weaver, always talks about this kind ofbalance. She says, \"When I am thinking up these patterns, I am trying to spinsomething, and then I unspin it. It goes up this way and it comes down thatway.\" And she uses circular hand gestures to illustrate. While we are trained tosee the straight lines, and to think of the rug in terms of geometric patterns,she makes the geometrical necessities of weaving—up one, over one—fit a kind ofcircular logic about how nature works and about how man interacts with nature.If we are going to talk about her beliefs with respect to rugs, we need somehowto project ourselves into her circles.Let me give a couple of other examples. These, by the way, are not intended tobe representative, but are just some things that I have encountered. They aresimply illustrative of the way a Navajo might explain things. There is a speciesof beads that one often finds in curio shops these days. They are called \"ghost\"beads by the whites, though I do not know any Navajos who call them that exceptwhen talking to whites (they feel they ought to phrase it the way the whiteswill understand it). The brown beads in these arrangements are the inside of theblue juniper berries, which the Navajo call literally \"junipers eyes.\" In themost preferred way of producing these necklaces, Navajos search to find wherethe small ground animals have hidden their supply of juniper seeds. Usually asmall girl, sometimes a boy, will look for likely hiding places, scoop them allout when she finds them, and look for the seeds that have already been brokenopen, so as not to deprive the animals of food. She puts all the whole seedsback, and takes only the ones that have a hole in one end. She takes them home,cleans them, punches a hole in the other end with a needle, and strings themtogether. I do not know any Navajo in my family or among my acquaintances whoever goes without these beads on him somewhere, usually in his pocket.My Navajo sister says that the reason these beads will prevent nightmares andkeep one from getting lost in the dark is that they represent the partnershipbetween the tree that gives its berries, the animals which gather them, andhumans who pick them up (being careful not to deprive the animals of theirfood). It is a three-way partnership—plant, animal, and man. Thus, if you keepthese beads on you and think about them, your mind, in its balance with nature,will tend to lead a healthy existence. If you are healthy by Navajo standards,you are participating properly in all the cycles of nature, and thus you willnot have bad dreams. Bad dreams are a sign of being sick, and getting lost is asign of being sick. So these beads are not for warding off sickness itself;rather, they are reminders of a frame of mind which is essentially cyclic, inthe proper relationship with the rest of nature—a frame of mind necessary to themaintenance of health.Again, using the weaving of rugs as an example, I want to explain thesignificance of the spindle and the yarn. The yarn comes from the sheep, ofcourse. The Navajos explain the relationship there not in terms of the rug, theend product—which, of course, is what our culture is interested in—but in terms of therelationship with the yarn and with the sheep, and with the spinning of theyarn, which has to be done in a certain direction because it goes along witheverything else that is spinning. Everything for the Navajos is moving; anarbitrary term in English such as east is phrased in Navajo, \"something roundmoves up regularly.\" When one spins the yarn, then, one does not just twist itto make string out of it; one twists it in the right direction (sunwise) witheverything else (otherwise, the thread will ravel). Thus, the yarn itselfbecomes a further symbol of man's interaction with the animal on the one hand,and with the whole of the cosmos on the other. When one works with yarn one isworking with something that remains a symbol of the cyclic or circularinteraction with nature. Even the spindle can be seen as an agency of, or afocal point in, a religious view of man and nature.In a recent experiment by an anthropologist and a moviemaker, some young Navajoswere given cameras and encouraged to make their own movies. One girl made amovie called \"Navajo Weaving.\" It lasts, as I recall, almost forty-five minutes,but there are only a few pictures of rugs in it. Most of the film is aboutpeople riding horseback, wandering out through the sagebrush, feeding the sheep,sometimes shearing them, sometimes following them through the desert, sometimespicking and digging the roots from which the dyes are made. Almost the entirefilm is made up of the things that the Navajo find important about making rugs:human interaction with nature. That is what rugmaking is for the Navajos.Something which for us is a secular craft or a technique is for these people apart or extension of the reciprocations embodied in religion."},{"pageContent":"Religious reciprocity extends even into the creation of the rug's design. MyNavajo sister wove a rug for me as a gift, the kind which the traders call yei(yei means something like \"the holy people\"). The pattern in this particular rugis supposed to represent five lizard people. The two on opposite ends are thesame color, and the next two inward the same color, and the one in the middle adistinctly different color. The middle one is the dividing line, so that thepattern reciprocates from end to end of the rug. When my sister gave it to me,she said, \"These represent your five children.\" Of course I was moved to inquireof her why she should represent my five children as lizards (I had private ideasabout why she might). I wondered what her reasoning was, and I certainly knewchildren are not \"holy people\"—far from it. She pointed out, \"Your oldest andyoungest are girls, and they are represented by the two opposite figures on eachend. Then you have twin boys—they are the two white ones, because they arealike. Then there is another boy, who doesn't have a mate in your family, so heis the center point of the family, even though he isn't that in terms of age.\"She made the pattern reciprocate from one end to the other not only in terms ofrepresenting my family but in terms of color. All the dyes were from particularplants which were related in her mind to good health. Lizards representlongevity, and by making my children congruent with the lizard people, she wasmaking a statement of, an embodiment of, their health and longevity. This is awish that any Navajo might want to express, because, as noted above, health andlongevity are central to Navajo religious concerns. If I knew more about thesymbolic function of certain colors in the rug, or the use of the dye-producingplants inNavajo medicine, I have no doubt that I would have still more to say about thereligious expression intended therein.Reciprocity is central to the production of many other Navajo items, especiallyso in the making of moccasins. My brother-in-law, Yellowman, when he goeshunting for skins to put on the body, tries to produce what the Navajos call\"sacred deerskin.\" It is supposed to be produced from a deer whose hide is notpunctured in the killing. If one wants the deer for meat, it can be simply shot(Yellowman, though he is in his early sixties, still hunts with a bow andarrow). But when he hunts deer for moccasins, or for cradle boards for hisfamily (the deerskin helps to surround the baby), then he wants skin of thesacred kind. To obtain sacred deerskin in the old fashion, one runs the deerdown until it is exhausted, and then smothers it to death.It is done in this manner: one first gathers pollen, which he carries with himin a small pouch. He then gets the deer out into open country and jogs alongbehind it, following until it is totally exhausted. Deer run very rapidly forawhile but soon get tired. The man who is good at jogging can keep it up forsome distance. Still, it is no easy job, as you can imagine if you have evervisited the desert of the Monument Valley area. When the deer is finally caught,he is thrown to the ground as gently as possible, his mouth and nose are heldshut, and covered with a handful of pollen so that he may die breathing thesacred substance. And then—I am not sure how widespread this is with theNavajos— one sings to the deer as it is dying, and apologizes ritually fortaking its life, explaining that he needs the skin for his family. The animal isskinned in a ritual way, and the rest of the deer is disposed of in a ritualmanner (I do not feel free to divulge the particulars here).The deerhide is brought home and tanned in the traditional way. The colorationis taken from particular kinds of herbs and from parts of the deer (includingits brains). Then the moccasins are made by sewing the deerhide uppers togetherwith cowhide soles. In many cases they are buried in wet sand until the personfor whom they are designed comes by. He puts them on and wears them until theyare dry. In so doing, of course, he wears his footprints into them. You canalways tell when you have on someone else's moccasins, if that mistake shouldever occur, because they hurt. Your own toe prints are in your own moccasins,for they have become part of you. It is no accident that the word for moccasinor shoe is shi ke, \"my shoe,\" which is exactly the same word for \"my foot.\"Religiously speaking, what happens is that the deerskin becomes part of us, andthis puts us in an interactive relationship with the deer. The whole event isritualized, carried out in \"proper\" ways, because it falls into a formalreligious category, not a mere craft. The moccasin is more than something tokeep the foot warm and dry: it is symbolic of that sacred relation andinteraction with the plants and the animals that the Navajo sees as so centralto \"reality.\"Also central to Navajo religion is the restoration of health when it has beenlost. The hogan is the round dwelling the Navajos live in. The fire is in themiddle of the floor, and the door always faces east. One of the reasons forthis, as my adopted father told me, was to make sure that people always liveproperly oriented to the world of nature. The door frames the rising sun at acertain time of the year. The only light that comes in is either through thesmokehole on thetop, or through the door, if it happens to be open. Healing rituals involving\"sandpainting\" are usually enacted inside the hogan, and are oriented to thefour directions. When the patient takes his or her place on the sandpainting,ritually they are taking their place within the world of the \"holy people,\"related to all the cycling and reciprocation of the universe. It is partly thatorientation which cures one.Yellowman still hunts for meat with bow and arrow. His arrowheads are made outof ordinary carpenters' nails pounded out between rocks, although he has a wholedeerskin bag of stone arrowheads that he has picked up on the desert. When Iasked him why he did not use those nice stone points on his own arrows, helooked at me very strangely. (I knew that the Navajos put them in the bottom ofmedicine containers when they are making medicine, but I thought that perhaps heknew how to make them himself given the proper kind of rock.) I asked whether heknew how the oldtimers used to make them. He looked at me as if I wereabsolutely insane. He finally answered, \"Men don't make them at all; lizardsmake arrowheads.\" For him, stone arrowheads, such as one might find, are sacreditems, and they fall into the same category as lizards, lightning, and cornpollen. Lizards, as I mentioned earlier, are related to long life and goodhealth. When one finds a lizard or an arrowhead, he picks it up and holds itagainst the side of his arm or over his heart, the same places where pollen isplaced during a ceremony. Clearly, stone arrowheads are for curing, not killing;or, more properly, they are for killing diseases. Thus, even arrowheads have todo with special sacred medicinal categories, not with the kinds of practicalcategories our culture might see. In other words, learning about Navajo religionand daily life requires the learning of a whole new set of concepts, codes,patterns, and assumptions.A student of mine paraphrased an old proverb this way: \"If I hadn't believed itI never would have seen it.\" This is essentially what I am saying about viewingreligion in other cultures. Our usual approach is in terms of pictures,patterns, gestures, and attitudes that we already know how to see. For example,when some dance specialists went to Tucson a couple of years ago to watch theYaqui Easter ceremonies, all they saw were the dances. They did not see that ona couple of occasions, several people very prominent in the ritual were simplysitting next to the altar for extremely long periods of time. I talked to almostevery person at that conference, and only a few of them had seen those peoplesitting there. There wasn't any dancing going on there, and so the dance peopleweren't \"seeing.\" And yet it was probably a very important part of the dance. Ido not pretend to have understood this part, but the point is that the strangershad not even seen it; they were watching for what they as Anglos and dancespecialists could recognize as dance steps. I would not accuse them ofstupidity, ignorance, or narrowmindedness. Rather, they had not been taught to\"read,\" to see other kinds of patternings than their own.To complicate matters further, many tribes feel the real world is not one thatis most easily seen, while the Western technological culture thinks of this asthe real world, the one that can be seen and touched easily. To many nativeAmericans the world that is real is the one we reach through special, religiousmeans, the one we are taught to \"see\" and experience via ritual and sacredpatterning.Instead of demanding proof for the Otherworld, as the scientific mind does, manynative Americans are likely to counter by demanding proof that this one existsin any real way, since, by itself, it is not ritualized.What the different cultures are taught to see, and how they see it, are thusworlds apart (although not, I think, mutually exclusive). One culture looks fora meaning in the visible, one looks for a meaning beyond the visible. The \"cues\"are different because the referents and the connotations are different. Add tothis basic incongruency the fact that the patterning of one is based onplanning, manipulation, predictability, competition, and power, while the otheris based in reciprocation, \"flowering,\" response to situation, andcooperation—and who would be surprised to find that the actual symbols andmeanings of the two religious modes will be perceived and expressed in quitecontrastive forms? We must seek to understand the metaphor of the nativeAmerican, and we must be willing to witness to the validity of its sacredfunction, or else we should not pretend to be discussing this religion. Beforewe can see, we must learn how to look.The Shadow of a Vision YonderSAM D. GILLIn this selection, Sam D. Gill demonstrates how Native American people apprehendreality. In his discussion of the Navajo sand painting, he points out thatreality is dynamic for the Native American and that the concepts of being andbecoming are communicated through the changing use of symbols. Through hisdiscussions of the Hopi use of the Kachina mask, he shows how ordinary materialswhen presented in the proper ritual context, are transformed into the sacred andthereby, given their meaning.Several summers ago while my family and I were living with a Navajo family northof Tuba City, Arizona, I witnessed an ordinary social event that at the time Ithought to be curious but of little consequence. Since then I have foundoccasion to reflect upon that event. From it I think I learned something aboutthe Navajo way of life, even something about their religion, which is thesubject I had gone there to pursue. I confess that I went to the Navajoreservation not very well prepared to do fieldwork. I had not done enoughhomework to afford me the clearest view of my contact with Navajo people. As aresult, much of what I was to learn came to me through insightful flashbackssometime after I had left Navajo country.By midsummer we had become well enough acquainted with our Navajo family to betrusted with some of their work. I considered it an honor to be asked to helphoe the weeds in the cornfield they had planted in the valley below thebeautiful mesa on which we lived. Being from a farming family in Kansas, Iwillingly accepted the invitation and replied that I would gladly hoe the corn.To my dismay our Navajo friends expressed alarm. I am sure they were consideringhow they could retract the invitation as they told me, \"Oh no, we don't hoe thecorn, we hoe the weeds!\" I assured them that I really did know the differencebetween corn plants and the unwanted weeds and that it was just the way wedescribed the job back home. It was simply a product of the peculiarity of myown language, not theirs.After getting the younger children on their way with the sheep, we headed forthe cornfield early the next morning. Under cautious eyes, I set about provingthat I not only knew the difference between weeds and corn, but that I was noslouch with a hoe. Of course, I was never to know the extent of my success. Theweight of my experience with the Navajo people is that their quiet dignityalways prevails.With my flashing hoe gradually slowing to match the ordered, rhythmic movementof the other hoes—the native hoes—I was relieved when late in the morning it wastime to stop for lunch. Moving to the arbor or \"shade,\" a small partly enclosedbrush structure, we took lunch. Then we prepared to rest for several hoursduring the heat of the day. It was in the shade that I was to observe the eventon which I want to reflect.The shade was perhaps half a mile from a narrow dirt road. In that part of thecountry the traffic is not what one would call heavy. During the quiet restperiod after lunch, I was aroused from my drowsiness a couple of times by a softbut excited discussion of whatever motor vehicle, usually a pickup truck, passedby on the road. I noticed that all present expressed interest in the traffic.They arose and peered through the open areas in the brush on the side of theshade facing the road. I recalled the many times I had driven up to a Navajodwelling, finding absolutely no sign of human activity.What surprised me was the response my friends made when one of the passingpickups turned off the road and headed toward our shade. Watching with raptattention, my Navajo friends carefully timed it so that as the truck pulled upto the shade and stopped, every member of the family was actively occupied. Thegrandmother sat on the ground with her back to the entrance near the truck andbegan her spinning. The children played a game in the dirt of the shade floor.Others sat about, gazing across the landscape, always in a direction away fromthe truck. This directed all attention away from the presence of the visitors.The visitors in the truck were Navajos and knew how to respond. They sat in thetruck for some minutes. It seemed like a very long time to me. Then quietly, theman, his wife and young daughter left their truck to enter the edge of theshade. There they sat upon the ground. The man quietly restrained the eagernessof the little girl to play with the other children. Again some minutes passedwhile my family continued their spinning, playing, and gazing. Finally, the manspoke a few soft words to the grandmother, who gently, almost inaudibly,responded without turning her head toward him. In a few moments he spoke again.This quiet conversation continued for some time, then the visitors arose andmoved about the shade, talking softly to each of us, including me, extendingtheir hands for a handshake and speaking the Navajo greeting, \"yadt'eeh.\" Nextmy friends arose and began to intermingle with the visitors. I was informed thatthey were going to the trading post some ten miles away to get water andsupplies to prepare a meal for the visitors. The entire proceedings had takenmore than a quarter of an hour.The insight that has come to me through continued reflection is that theincident illustrates the \"way\" of Navajo religion. I had witnessed theperformance of a formal ritual for purposes of establishing certain kinds ofsocial relationships, in this instance, between Navajo families. The ritualreflects the quiet dignity and the patient and formal manner of the Navajopeople. And by its simplicity it helps place the almost infinite complexity ofNavajo ceremonies in a better perspective. It also gives clues regarding thenature of Navajo religion, wherein relationships are established orreestablished with the holy ones.Notice that the situation had been carefully analyzed by my Navajo friends. Theyfollowed proper conduct with deliberateness and patience. This resulted in thesuccessful establishing of a relationship between two families. Each party madesome sign to show that it understood its obligations and was committing itselfto their fulfillment. The guests offered their hands as a sign of their entranceinto the relationship. My family proceeded to meet their first obligation of therelationship by offering a meal to the guests.It is commonly observed that Navajo religion centers largely upon the rituals bywhich an individual who is suffering a malady is healed. The sufferer isattended to by an individual called a \"singer.\" The \"singer\" directs the ritualactivities and is responsible for knowing the songs, prayers, and the order ofthe ritual processes. A Navajo ceremony is not performed unless it is calledfor. But when it is called for, the family of the sufferer must arrange with a\"singer\" to perform the ceremony. This requires making a formal relationshipthrough social and ritual acts not unlike those characteristic of theintroduction to which I have made reference. In both settings the relationshipis bonded through a formal sign. In this case the \"singer\" receives payment inmaterial goods or in cash in return for performing the ceremony. David Aberlehas analyzed this exchange and has convincingly shown that the \"fee\" is notreally payment for services rendered, but is a sign of the establishment of areciprocity relationship. The \"singer\" is thus obliged to respond by conductingthe requested ceremonial.In the performance of Navajo ceremonies, the observer is struck by the materialinsignificance of the ritual objects. He also cannot help but notice the extremecare and formality with which these objects are treated. A singer's medicinebundle consists of nothing more precious than an odd assortment of sticks,feathers, bags of colored sands and vegetal materials, rocks, and so on. Thesethings appear so common, even crude, that it makes one wonder how they couldhave any religious significance. But in the context of ritual the same objectsare carefully handled, described in song, explicated in prayer, and manipulatedin ritual. Their significance is developed to such a magnitude that theyinfinitely■Stk,surpass their material content in signifying that which the Navajo regards asbeing holy.This is in keeping with the story of creation in Navajo mythology. The storyutilizes common objects in describing the process of bringing life to the world.First Man, who directed the creation, had a medicine bundle containing bits ofcolored rocks, called \"jewels.\" First Man carefully placed these \"jewels\" uponthe floor of the creation hogan to designate the life forces of the things whichwere to be created. All life forms were represented in these mundane substances,and their distinguishing characteristics were understood to be exemplified inthe shapes of the jewels. Furthermore, the relative place where each was laid onthe floor of the creation hogan designated the place each was to occupy in theworld, together with the relationship each was to have to all other livingthings. These material representations of life were then clothed in a layer ofcolored sands to represent the outward appearance they would have in the createdworld. After the preparation of this symbolic microcosm has been completed,prayers were uttered to transform the symbolic creation into the more visibleeveryday world of the Navajos. This is the way in which the Navajos conceive theprocess of the creation of their world. When creation was completed the worldwas beautiful. All things were formed and set in a place, and properrelationships existed between them.In both the creation of the world and in the creation of the socialrelationships formalities dominate. The formal enactment of ritual brings thingsto their proper place and serves to interconnect them by establishing bindingrelationships. Ritual acts are understood to be essential to the establish ingof proper ^relationships. Navajo life depends upon such relationships.Scholarly interpretation doesn't always catch the significance of this.Frequently, the interpretation of Navajo religion has called attention to theperformance of \"magical\" acts. They are called \"magical\" to indicate that thereis no ordinary causal principle which connects the acts performed with theexpected results. I would never want to dismiss the presence of mystery andmagic in Navajo religion. Yet it seems to me that the more significant factor isthe process by which the visions and great conceptions are communicated by theformal manipulation of mundane objects. Let me illustrate the difference. Themost common scholarly interpretation of the sandpainting rite is that itcontains a kind of magical osmosis. The sandpainting is prepared upon the floorof the ceremonial hogan, the patient enters and sits upon the sandpainting, andthe singer applies sands from the figures represented in the sandpainting to thepatient. At the conclusion of the rite, the sandpaintings are formally destroyedand removed from the ceremonial hogan. According to the \"magical osmosis\"explanation, the sandpainting is understood to absorb the illness, or the evilcause of the illness, taking it from the patient and replacing it with goodnessfrom the sandpainting. This explanation focuses attention on the removal of thesands after the rite, for it resembles and builds upon similarities between thisact and the removal of sands into which one vomits in emetic rites.In my view, this \"magical osmosis\" interpretation is partial. I would proposeinstead that sandpainting rites are meaningful curing acts because of theNavajos' recognition of the performative powers of symbolic representation. Inpreparing the sandpainting, the Navajos follow the precedent established in theprocesses of world creation. In Navajo mythology it is said that \"in thebeginning\" the forces of life were set forth in material form by arrangingcommon objects of several colors upon the floor of a ceremonial hogan. Thus, inphysical representations using ordinary materials, Navajos express theirconception of the profound nature of life. In a healing ceremony thesandpaintings are closely associated with the elements identified with the causeof the illness suffered. As is told in the mythology of each ceremonial, thesandpaintings are revealed to the mythic hero as he is being cured of anillness. In most cases the illness is due to the fact that something is out ofits proper place. For example, a ghost who will not remain in its domain, aperson who has made contact with the dead, a deity who has been angered oroffended by a person who has trespassed or violated a taboo, or a witch who hasgained power by being out of bounds. The causal agep t rather than {he illnesssuffered determin es the nature of the ceremoni al cure^ The ritual presents theforces of life in thlTshapeand lelallVe places assigned to them by sacredhistory as recounted in the myths. The identification of the patient with thesandpainting by touching the sands of the parts of the body of the paintedfigures to the corresponding parts of the patient is a gesture of communicatingproper relationships to the patient. This is very similar to the acts performedto place the forces of life represented on the floor of the creation hoganwithin the representations of the outward forms they were to take in the realworld. And, as in the case of the process of world creation, the formal removalof the sandpaintings designates a transition from the world of ritual to theworld thus represented. This transition illustrates that reality is dynamic andwill not always be contained in symbolic form.Relationships are central to the Navajo way of life. Lifes _interrelationshirjs_ are not casual.

Inthe Navajo conception, lite and good health are noFso inuelfa matteFofsubstance—for all things belong to the earth—as they are a matter of form andplace with respect to the rest of the created world.

This identity, place, and way must behonored and carefully maintained.The Navajo way of life can be characterized at one level as a kind of symbolicformalism, although Navajos would not describe it in these terms. The Navajos'own appreciation of symbolization becomes particularly compelling in theirbelief about the curative power of the healing rites. Here the symbols presentedare appreciated for having the power to cure physical illness; and the Navajohave in mind something quite different from our common reduction of theirreligion to a kind of primitive psychology. In the symbols of their religionthey recognize a power to change the shape of things in the world, even when thematerials which compose the symbols are mundane. This perforrtiative power stemsfrom a religious tradition that takes form in ritual acts. Such acts makeearthly elements into a vehicle disclosing the deepest forces of life.XNavaio symbols within sandpainting rites are comparable to the shaking of ha ndsto seal a soc ial relatio nship. Both ot these acts refle ct the sametemperament. Both indicate the way in which Navajos appr ehend reality. In bothcases, mundane ingredients find deeper symbolic significance. Theieis nothingspecial in the handshake, for example. But in the context of the formal ritualof establishing relationships, handshak ing performs an essential role byassuring each party of the acceptance of the privileges and obligations of therelationship. It marks transformation from a relationship discussed to arelations hip e stabl ished and made operative . Similarly, in Navajosandpainting rites the substance of the colored sands is not as important as theshapes which they form. Properly prepared and used, the sandp ainting has thepower to cure. It reestablishes the patient with the fo rces of life on whichhis healt h and happiness depend . In this regard, one of the most importantcomponents ot native American religions is the process by which concepts ofbeing and becoming are represented and communicated through the use of symbols.I have cited one instance of this in Navajo religion. We can find the samephenomenon when we turn to Hopi culture.I remember feeling confused when I learned that Hopi children witness an eventwhich they find shocking and bitterly disappointing at the conclusion of theirfirst religious initiation. I am referring to the conclusion of the initiationinto the kachina cult which is composed of two societies, the Kachina Societyand the Powamu Society. Formally, this initiation begins the religious life ofall Hopi children, boys and girls alike. The event occurs as a part of the BeanDance which concludes the annual celebration of Powamu, a late winter ceremonialto prepare for the agricultural cycle. The newly initiated children are escortedinto a kiva, an underground ceremonial chamber, there to await the entrance ofthe kachinas, the masked dancers they have come to know as Hopi gods. Prior tothis time, the already initiated go to great efforts to keep the children fromdiscovering that kachinas are masked male members of their own village.Announcing that they are kachinas, the dancers enter the kiva where the childrenare eagerly awaiting them. But they appear for the first time to the newinitiates without their masks. The children immediately recognize the identityof the dancing figures. Their response is shock, disappointment, and bitterness.Don Talayesva, an old Oraibi Hopi, recalled his feelings at the time of hisinitiation in his autobiography Sun Chief.When the Katcinas entered the kiva without masks, I had a great surprise. Theywere not spirits, but human beings. ... I had been told all my life that theKatcinas were gods. I was especially shocked and angry when I saw all my uncles,fathers, and clan brothers dancing as Katcinas.It would seem to me that this concluding event in the Powamu ceremonial leavesthe children in a peculiarly unstable state as new initiates. I would haveexpected the purpose of the initiation to reveal clearly the full nature of thekachinas to the children. But it appears that the initiation rites accomplishonly the destruction of the belief in the identity of the kachina figures asgods, as it was held by thechildren prior to initiation. I understand that Margaret Mead likened this eventto the European-American child learning of the identity of Santa Claus, which isoften accompanied by the same kind of bitter disappointment. There are surfacesimilarities, but this is not a satisfactory explanation. Nor should we acceptanother scholarly interpretation that it is inevitable the children learn thatkachinas are \"not real gods, but men dressed as gods.\" We may find some force inthis argument, since, as outside occasional observers, we can easily recognizethat the kachina dancers are masked mortals. Even when we hear a Hopi say thatwhen in donning the kachina mask he \"becomes the kachina,\" we tend to offer acritical interpretation. Another older position dismisses the statement asprimitive nonsense, regarding it as a product of a primitive mentality notskilled in precise distinctions. Then too, a play theory has been advanced. Thisposition argues that the Hopi acts \"as if\" he were a kachina and makes thestatement while he is so pretending. But all of these interpretations are foundwanting.Instead, it is important that we take seriously what the initiated Hopi says. Wemust recognize that he actually means what he says, that in putting on thekachina mask he really becomes a god. This is a clear statement on his part. Itis in light of this statement that we should attempt to see how at theconclusion of the initiation the shadow cast upon the kachina figures serves toreveal to the children the true nature of the kachinas. The ceremony appears tobe deliberately calculated to engender the disappointment the children feel.A fuller review of the contextual events is necessary. Prior to the initiationinto the kachina cult, the children largely under the age of ten are carefullyguided into the development of a particular kind of relationship with thekachinas. The kachinas, who frequent the villages during only half of the year,have a wide range of contacts with the children. Many of them are kind andbenevolent to the children, presenting them with gifts. Others are frighteningogres who discipline naughty children by threatening to eat them. And some aresilly clowns who entertain the children with their antics. In all these contactsthe uninitiated children are protected against seeing kachinas unmasked or themasks unoccupied. They are also guarded against hearing anything which mightdisclose the masked character of the kachina figures. The children are told thatthe kachinas are gods who come to the village from their homes far away tooverlook and direct the affairs of the Hopi people. They are taught that theytoo will become kachinas when they die. Prior to the initiation events, thechildren grow to accept the familiar kachina figures as being exactly what theyappear to be.The perspective nurtured in the children is given its final stage of developmentin the kachina cult initiation rites. During the Powamu ceremonial to which theinitiation rites are attached, the initiates are given special attention by thekachinas. They come into closer contact. The kachina give the children specialgifts. They are instructed in kachina lore. All of this seems to be carefullycalculated to intensify the shock the children will feel when they observe theunmasked appearance of the kachinas during the Bean Dance.When the kachinas enter the kiva, in one sharp and sudden blow the expectationsso carefully nurtured are forever shattered. For the moment only pain\\and bitterness take its place, as is evident in the statement of a Hopi womanquoted by Dorothy Eggan in her 1943 study of Hopi adjustment.I cried and cried into my sheepskin, that night, feeling I had been made a foolof. How could I ever watch the Kachinas dance again? I hated my parents andthought I would never believe what the old folks said, wondering if Gods hadever danced for the Hopi as they said and if people really lived after death.But even with the disappointment life goes on, and the initiated is given theprivilege to participate in religious events. In time, the initiated can enterother religious societies and enjoy expanded privileges of participation. Butonce initiated into the kachina cult, religious events can never again be viewednaively. Unforgettably clear to the children is the realization that some thingsare not what they appear to be. This realization precedes the appreciation ofthe full nature of reality.Professor Alfonso Ortiz, anthropologist and Tewa Indian, has pointed out that inthe Pueblo worldview \"all things are thought to have two aspects, essence andmatter.\" In the sh a dow cast bv the destruction of their naivete, the initiatedchildren are made aware of the \"essence\" or saerality ot things thev had unti lthen seen only as \"matter.\" Thus, the initiation serves to bring the children tothe thresh o ld of religiou s awareness and as a consequence initiates theirreligious lives. Once begun, the litetime ol the Hopi is a gradual progressionin the acquisition of knowledge and the appreciation of the nature of \"space,time, being, and becoming,\" to use the subtitle of Ortiz's book The Tewa World.This brings us back to the question of truth regarding the Hopi statement thatwhen one dons the kachina mask he becomes a kachina. Given the appreciation bythe initiated Hopi of the full nature of reality in both its material andessential aspects, the truth of the statement can be more clearly understood.£v^ r^r,r>i n cr f nr j^^u^o ™-,ri „ Mr>pi n^voc; ljf P an H ar tion to themask, thus making the kachina essen ce present in material form. M ircea Eliadeilluminates this point in his book The Sacred and the Profane: \"by manifestingthe sacred, any object becomes something else, yet it continues to remainitself.\" The anomaly we observe in the Hopi statement that he becomes a kachinais but an expression of the paradox of sacredness; but, in this case, the sacredobject is the Hopi himself. By wearing the kachina mask, the Hopi manifests thesacred. He becomes the sacred kachina. yet continues to be himself. We, asuninitiated outsiders, observe only the material form. The spirit, or essence,of the kachina is present as well but that can be perceived only by theinitiated. The material presence without the spiritual is but mereimpersonation—a dramatic performance, a work of art. The spiritual without thematerial remains unmanifest; it leaves no object for thought or speech oraction. The spiritual must reside in some manifest form to be held in common bythe community. The view, often taken, that the kachinas are \"merelyimpersonations\" fails to recognize the full religious nature of the kachinaperformances. It also fails to take into account the truth of the statement. Ifthe kachinas are not present in both material and essential form, the eventscould scarcely be called religious.Both Navajo and Hopi religions evidence an appreciation for the power ofsymbolization. Only through symbolization is the sacred manifest; the subtletiesare many. On the one hand, the mundane materials which comprise religioussymbols must never be taken as being more than the simple ordinary earthyelements they are. This fact is driven home in the disenchantment with thematerial appearance of the kachinas experienced by the children undergoinginitiation. It is also evident in the example of the sandpainting rite fromNavajo culture. On the other hand, the ordinary materials when presented in theproper form manifest the sacred. Both Navajo sandpaintings and Hopi kachinashave the power to order and affect the world in a very profound way.I think that this deep appreciation for the process of the manifestation of thesacred is broadly held among native Americans. One of the best formulations ofit I know is found in the wisdom of the Oglala Sioux, Black Elk, as told to JohnNeihardt in Black Elk Speaks. As a youth, Black Elk was the recipient of aremarkable vision which he looked to as a guide throughout his life. For manyyears he kept the vision to himself, fearing to tell others. But as time wenton, he found rising within him an even greater fear. Part of the message givenhim was that he was to enact the vision in ritual form for the people to see.This was a common practice among the Dakota. An old medicine man from whom BlackElk sought guidance warned him that if the vision were not performed, somethingvery bad would happen to him.Under Black Elk's direction, preparations were immediately begun so that thevision could be enacted by the people. Black Elk recalls how he experienced theenactment of his vision.I looked about me and could see that what we then were doing was like a shadowcast upon the earth from yonder vision in the heavens, so bright it was andclear. I knew the real was yonder and the darkened dream of it was here.There is a sense in which the Navajo sandpaintings, the Hopi kachina masks, andmany other native American ritual acts share the properties of a shadow of avision yonder. I have stressed that it is the form more than the substance thatis important in manifesting the sacred forces of life. Certainly this ischaracteristic of shadows. Further, there is a \"thinness\" to ritual objects andacts which finds them to be real and meaningful only when cast in the light of\"the yonder vision.\" This fragility is illustrated in the Navajo sandpaintingswhich are destroyed in the very acts by which they are of service. All of thisis a constant reminder that the material symbols exist and are meaningful onlyin the degree to which they manifest the sacred. Were it not for these shadowscast by the vision yonder, American Indian religion would be confined to theexperience of rarified mystical moments. The shadow may appear bright and clearas it did to Black Elk, or dark and foreboding as it does to Hopi kachina cultinitiates, but the shadows integrate American Indian religion with a distinctiveway of living and interpreting life.In The BeginningALFONSO ORTIZAlfonso Ortiz is a social anthropologist and a native of the San Juan Pueblo,the largest of the surviving Tewa villages in New Mexico. In his writings hebrings together his perspective as a social anthropologist and his experienceand knowledge as a participant in the Pueblo culture. In this selection, Ortizpresents the \"myth of origin and the early migrations of the Tewa.\"1 he Tewa were living in Sipofene beneath Sandy Place Lake far to the north. Theworld under the lake was like this one, but it was dark. Super-naturals, men,and animals lived together at this time, and death was unknown. Among thesupernaturals were the first mothers of all the Tewa, known as \"Blue Corn Woman,near to summer,\" or the Summer mother, and \" White Corn Maiden, near to ice,\"the Winter mother.These mothers asked one of the men present to go forth and explore the way bywhich the people might leave the lake. Three times the man refused, but on thefourth request he agreed. He went out first to the north, but saw only mist andhaze; then he went successively to the west, south, and east, but again saw onlymist and haze. After each of these four ventures he reported to the corn mothersand the people that he had seen nothing, that the world above was still ochu,\"green\" or \"nnrip f\" \\AtyONext the mothers told him to go to the above. On his way he came upon an openplace and saw all the tsiwi (predatory mammals and carrion-eating birds)gathered there. There were mountain lions and other species of cat; wolves,coyotes, and foxes; and vultures and crows. On seeing the man these animalsrushed him, knocked him down, and scratched him badly. Then they spoke, tellinghim: \"Get up! We are your friends.\" His wounds vanished immediately. The animalsgave him a bow and arrows and a quiver, dressed him in buckskin, painted hisface black, and tied the feathers of the carrion-eaters on his hair. Finallythey told him: \"You have been accepted. These things we have given you are whatyou shall use henceforth. Now you are ready to go.\"When he returned to the people he came as Mountain Lion, or the Hunt chief. Thisis how the first Made person came into being. On approaching the place where thepeople awaited, he announced his arrival by calling out like a fox (de). This ishis call. The people rejoiced, saying, \"We have been accepted.\"The Hunt chief then took an ear of white corn, handed it to one of the othermen, and said, \"You are to lead and care for all of the people during thesummer.\" To another man he handed another ear of white corn and told him, \"Youshall lead and care for the people during the winter.\" This is how, according tothe103picture3 [images/picture3.jpg]myth, the Summer and Winter chiefs were instituted. They joined the Hunt chiefas Made People.Among the people were also six pairs of brothers called Towa e, literally\"persons.\" To the first pair, who were blue, the newly appointed chiefs said:\"Now you shall go forth to the north and tell us what you see.\" They went withthe older one in the lead, but could not walk very far because the earth wassoft. All they saw was a mountain to the north. They returned and reported theirobservations to the people. Next the yellow pair were sent out to the west,followed by the red ones who went south, the white ones who went east, and thedark (nuxu in) ones who went to the zenith. Each successive pair returned andreported that the earth was still soft. The yellow, red and white brothersreported seeing mountains in each direction, while the dark pair who went abovereported seeing agoyo nuxu, a large star in the eastern sky. The first fourpairs each picked up some mud and slung it toward each of the cardinaldirections, thereby creating four tsin, or flat-topped hills.Finally, the last pair of Towa e, the all-colored (tsege in) ones of the nadir,were sent out. They found that the ground had hardened somewhat, and they saw arainbow in the distance. When they returned and reported this, the people madepreparations to leave the lake. The Summer chief led the way, but as he steppedon the earth it was still soft and he sank to his ankles in the mud. Then theWinter chief came forth, and as he stepped on the ground there was hoarfrost.The ground became hard, and the rest of the people followed. The original cornmothers and other supernaturals, the predatory mammals, and the carrion-eatersremained beneath the lake. The Towa e, or brothers, went to the mountains of thedirections to stand watch over the people.As the people started southward many began to fall ill. The Winter and Summerchiefs decided that they were not yet complete; something else was needed. Allreturned once again to the home under the lake, and there the Hunt chief openedup Summer chiefs corn mother. He discovered that the hollow core was filled withpebbles, ashes, and cactus spines. The Hunt chief replaced these with seeds anddeclared that one among the people was \"of a different breath,\" or a witch, forthe items discovered in the corn mother were recognized as items of witchcraft.This, then, marked the beginning of witchcraft and other forms of evil. In orderto combat these and to make the people well, the Ke (medicine man) was createdas the fourth Made person. The people then started out once again.Before they proceeded very far south, they all had to return to the lake threetimes more, because the chiefs felt they were still not complete. At eachsubsequent return the Kossa and Kwirana (clowns), the Scalp chief, and theKwiyoh (Women's society) were instituted, in that order. The Kossa and Kwiranawere created to entertain the people when they grew tired and unhappy, the Scalpchief to insure success in warfare, and the Women's society to care for thescalps and to assist the Scalp chief. The people at last felt they werecomplete, and prepared to proceed southward once again.Before doing so, the Hunt chief divided the people between the Summer chief andthe Winter chief. Those who were to follow the Summer chief wouldproceed south along the mountains on the west side of the Rio Grande. The Winterchief and his group would proceed along the mountains on the east side of theriver. The Summer People, as the former group came to be called, subsisted byagriculture and by gathering wild plant foods, while the Winter People subsistedby hunting. Each group \"took twelve steps\" (made twelve stops) on this journey,and after each step they built a village and stayed for a day. \"In that time oneday was one year.\" Those who died along the way—for death was now known—wereburied near the village and stones piled over the graves.At the twelfth step the two groups rejoined and founded a village called Posi,near present day Ojo Caliente. The village grew and prospered, and the peopleremained there for a long while. In time, however, an epidemic struck and theelders decided to abandon the village. Six different groups left and founded thesix Tewa villages we know today. San Juan was founded first, so it became the\"mother pueblo\" for the other five. Each of the six departing groups includedboth Winter and Summer people, so the chiefs and other Made People werereplicated in each village. The origin and migration myth ends with aninformant's observation:In the very beginning we were one people. Then we divided into Summer people andWinter people; in the end we came together again as we are today. But you cansee we are still Summer people and Winter people.Unit IIIAnd We Washed Our Weapons in the Sea: Gods and Goddesses of the Neolithic PeriodArchaeoastronomy and ItsComponentsANTHONY F. AVENIAnthony F. Aveni is known for his work in archeaoastronomy, a combination ofastronomy and archaeological and ethnological research, especially in the areaof pre-Colomhian skywatching in the New World. In this selection, he indicatesthe uses of astronomy throughout the ancient world and explains howarchaeologists today are coming to understand the complexity of that ancientuse.\". . . Maya astronomy is too important to be left to the astronomers.\"— Sir Eric ThompsoniVll developing civilizations exhibit a reverence for the sky and its contents.The cyclic movement of the sun, moon, planets, and stars represents a kind ofperfection unattainable by mortals. The regular occurrence of sunrise andmoonset provided the ancients with something dependable and orderly, a stablepillar to which their minds could be anchored.Today we no longer have need of practical astronomy in our daily lives. Unlikeour ancestors, we spend most of our time in a regulated climate with controlledlighting; we are detached almost totally from the natural environment.Technology has created an artificial backdrop against which we play out ourlives. Any need we once had to watch carefully for celestial events has becomelost. Who knows the time the sun rose today or the current phase of the moon?The clocks by which we pace our daily activities give us a distorted view of thedependence of real time periods upon circumstances transpiring in the heavens.Though we may try, we cannot really appreciate the degree to which the minds ofthe ancients were preoccupied with astronomical pursuits. Modern science andtechnology have flavored our way of thought so as to rob us of any realsensitivity to the nature of the ancients' relation to the cosmos. The heavenstouched nearly every aspect of their culture; consequently, we find ancientastronomy woven into myth, religion, and astrology. So great was the reliance ofthe ancients upon the sun and moon that they deified them. Representations ofthese luminaries adorned their temples as objects of worship and they weresymbolized in sculpture and other works of art. The ancients followed the sungod wherever he went, marking his appearance and disappearance with great care.His return to a certain place on the horizon told them when to plant the crops,when the river would overflow its banks, or when the monsoon season wouldarrive. The planning and harvesting of crops could be regulated by celestialevents. The important days of celebration and festivity could be markedeffectively using the celestial calendar. Equipped with a knowledge ofmathematics and a method of keeping records, the ancients could refine andexpand their knowledge of positional astronomy. After several generations, withthe advantage of a \"written\" record, they could learn to predict such celestialphenomena as eclipses well in advance. What a powerful advantage thepriest-ruler would have over his followers with this bit of trickery in hisrepertoire.We are continually amazed at the seemingly impossible accomplishments of ourancient ancestors. How did they erect the great pyramids, the statues on EasterIsland, or the huge Olmec heads? In disbelief, some of us turn toextraterrestrial zoo keepers for the source of ancient wisdom and ability.According to one popular account, \"the past teemed with unknown gods who visitedthe primeval earth in manned spaceships. Incredible technical achievementsexisted in the past. There is a mass of know-how which we have only partiallyrediscovered today.\"Though the last part is substantially true, such a statement is uttered in totalignorance of the ways of ancient people. One of the goals of this text will beto show that the sophisticated astronomical and mathematical achievements of thepeople of ancient Mesoamerica followed logically in the evolutionary developmentof a civilization which intensely worshipped the heavens and steadfastlyassociated the phenomena they witnessed in the celestial environment with thecourse of human affairs.Since the ancients expended considerable effort paying tribute to theircelestial deities, we should not be surprised to find that, in many instances,astronomical principles played a role in the design of the ceremonial centerswhere they worshipped their gods. Stonehenge is perhaps the most famous exampleof an ancient structure believed to have served an astronomical function. In1964, astronomer Gerald Hawkins wrote Stonehenge Decoded, thus rekindling anidea made popular at the end of the nineteenth century by Sir Norman Lockyer.Hawkins hypothesized that the megaliths standing for five thousand years on theplain of southern Great Britain constituted a calendar in stone, each componentsituated deliberately and precisely to align with astronomical events takingplace along the local horizon. Detailed works by Alexander Thorn and a culturalsynthesis by Euan MacKie have since solidified the basis of our understanding ofancient megalithic astronomy and have elevated it to a level of scholarlyrespectability.The Stonehenge controversy has been responsible for the resurgence of interestin the interdisciplinary field of astroarchaeology, a term first coined byHawkins to encompass the study of the astronomical principles employed inancient works of architecture and the elaboration of a methodology for theretrieval and quantitative analysis of astronomical alignment data. An alternateterm, \"archaeoastronomy,\" embodies the study of the extent and practice ofastronomy among ancient civilizations. Such a definition fits the disciplinewhich classicists call the \"history of astronomy,\" except that the latter hasdealt traditionally with the literate Western society and focuses largely onanalyses of nota-tional schemes in the Western style (i.e., ancient scriptures,Egyptian hieroglyphs, cuneiform tablets). Being somewhat less confined bytradition and oftenhandicapped by the sparsity of a written record, archaeoastronomy has developedinto a broader interdiscipline drawing upon the written as much as thearchaeological and iconographic record. Consequently, discussions ofastronomical symbolism and astronomical precision are often intermixed.Though much emphasis has been placed on the megalithic sites in Europe, anincreased interest has recently arisen in the study of astronomical buildingorientations in other parts of the world, particularly the Americas. Aerialphotography has revealed that the remarkably straight lines etched across thePeruvian desert at Nazca continue up and down the steep sides of mountains fordistances of several miles. Many of these lines are oriented to the risingpositions of the sun at the solstices. Large figures at their intersection mayhave symbolized the constellations. In Central Mexico, the plan of the greatceremonial center of Teotihuacan seems to have been organized to harmonize withthe positions of the sun and certain fundamental stars. Astronomicalorientations have also been discovered in the Maya area of the peninsula ofYucatan. The so-called Group E structures at Uaxactun, Guatemala, represent theprototype of a series of sun watcher's stations found in that region. TheCaracol at Chichen Itza in Yucatan, an observatory in the shape of a roundtower, contains horizontal sight tubes directed to positions of astronomicalsignificance.Anthropologists have become interested in studying relationships between theastronomical knowledge of civilizations of Mesoamerica and that of the nativetribes of North America. Did cosmological ideas diffuse among the cultures andwhich concepts developed independently? Ceremonial mounds near St. Louis,Missouri, and in central Kansas probably functioned as solstice registers tomark the extreme positions of the rising sun. The Big Horn Medicine Wheel, aspoked wheel formed out of boulders in the mountains of Wyoming, also appears tohave functioned as an astronomical observatory. Far to the south, theinterconnected lines of the ceque system surrounding the ancient city of Cuzcoin Peru may represent a calendar on the landscape which has astronomical,religious, and even political attributes.In the Americas, a number of investigators from widely divergent fields haveturned their attention to archaeoastronomical pursuits. As a result of theunique cooperation among them, there has been added to the literature anincreasing body of evidence relating to the role of astronomy in the lives ofthe ancient people of this hemisphere. After a decade of progress on severalfronts, it is time to begin the slow process of synthesis of the new materialinto the mainstream of human intellectual history.This book is about ;he people of ancient Mexico and Central America and what weknow of their system of astronomy. In studying them we have an enormousadvantage over Thorn, Hawkins, and their predecessors, for we know from thewritten record, the art, and the sculpture that the civilizations whichdeveloped in the New World before the arrival of Columbus were already highlyadvanced by the time of his arrival. Only within the last half-century have webegun to gain a full appreciation of the magnitude and sophistication of ancientNew World civilizations. The ancient American calendric documents reveal thatmathematics and astronomy were among their intellectual hallmarks; in fact,they were fanatically devoted to these disciplines. For them, time was anintricate natural system, each day being ticked off in a complex maze of endlesscycles. But quite unlike our modern astronomy, the raison d'etre ofMesoameri-can, particularly Maya, astronomy was ritualistic and divinatory innature.To have accomplished as much as they did, the ancient Americans must have beenkeen observers of the heavens. Were they also brilliant theoreticians? To answersuch a question we must assemble, all in one place, the material which isrelevant to an objective assessment of the depth and extent of theirastronomical knowledge. I have set such a goal in the production of this volume.In attempting to achieve it, I have necessarily ventured a few steps out of myown field in different directions in order to form canals between pools ofmaterial in disciplines usually regarded as unrelated. Any trueinterdisciplinary synthesis requires that such steps be taken. In cutting thepath, I have made a special effort to tread softly, accepting the generousguidance of interested colleagues in allied fields.Because an interdisciplinary approach to archaeoastronomy has developed, theserious scholar must become acquainted with certain segments of establishedfields which border upon it. What are these segments of knowledge? It seemsclear that an understanding of basic positional astronomy is indispensable ifone wishes to master the complexities of ancient astronomy. Maya archaeologistSir Eric Thompson once suggested that one could understand Maya astronomy onlyby getting into the skin of the Maya priest-astronomer. In other words, aknowledge of the history and culture of the Native American people is vital toan understanding of their astronomical systems. Input from the archaeologicaldiscipline is important since it represents a large part of the record whichsurvives. Pre-Columbian astronomy was strongly wedded to astrology and religion.Those of us trained in the modern sciences must be careful not to slant our viewtoo much toward the present. We cannot assume that the Maya were always lookingfor the same celestial events which matter to us. Some astronomers, with a poorgrasp of pre-Columbian thought, have made assertions about the Maya calendarwhich are strongly at odds with the facts gleaned from the anthropologists'studies.Too often discussions of ancient astronomical systems have been couched inone-sided dialogue. The twentieth-century Western scientists are accused offashioning their ancestors after their own image; they frame their arguments inthe scientific jargon of their profession. As a result, the anthropologistseither blindly accept their propositions out of awe and reverence for thecomplexity of their language and scientific method or refuse to consider theargument because they cannot comprehend the intricacies of positional astronomydelineated in tracts that were never intended for the nonscientific audience.Conversely, many outrageous astronomical statements have been uttered byuntrained anthropologists, who, with a little understanding of elementaryastronomy, could have carried their theories a long way.The Prehistoric GoddessANNE L. BARSTOWAnne L. Barstow teaches medieval history and women's religious history at SUNYCollege at Old Westbury, New York. She is the author of a feminist study Joan ofArc: Heretic, Mystic, Shaman and Married Priests and the Reforming Papacy: theEleventh Century Debate. In this article, Barstow provides the reader withinsight into the earliest manifestations of the goddess, showing that thegoddess is the deity of death as well as of life. She also shows that theattributes of the goddess and the predominance of female values and experience,although transformed by time, are still expressed by women today.vjoddesses have been worshiped since earliest times, far longer than have maledeities. Evidence of female figurines placed in sacred settings, as in circlesof stones found on floors of caves, dates as far back as ca. 25,000 B.C. Tracesof this worship have been found from Siberia to southern Africa, from the Industo Ireland, and all over the New World as well. In caves, on mountaintops, athome altars, and in the earliest shrines, the goddess appeared, carved fromstone, modeled from clay, etched in plaster.Because these manifestations of the worship of a female deity begin long beforerecorded history, we call her the prehistoric goddess. She was the forerunner ofthe great goddess familiar to us from the written records of ancient Egypt andMesopotamia, of ancient Greece and Rome. Because her worship antedates theinvention of writing, we learn about her through archaeology. Who was she andwhy was she worshiped? The answer lies in archaeological records that revealmany richly varied and complex cults.\"She\" is many goddesses: from the settings in which her likenesses are found weknow that she was worshiped variously as the guardian of childbirth, the sourceof wisdom, the dispenser of healing, the Lady of the Beasts, the fount ofprophecy, the spirit who presided over death. But preeminently she was thesymbol of fertility, the guarantor of crops, animals, and humans. In this roleshe was the great mother, the earth mother, whose magical powers assured thefood supply and the continuance of the human race.Since evidence of her worship is found across the world, she must have beenknown by many names, of which our earliest written records give us hints—Cybele,Inanna, Isis. But despite her various names and her different purposes, she is asingle goddess. The multiple roles created for her can be seen as differentfacets of one power, as expressions of one basic belief of these early Stone Agesocieties: that the female represented the principle of creativity and of powerover both life and death. Prehistoric people expressed their deepest questionsabout life by constructing various cults that centered around a female deity.What was she like? Were there common characteristics among the goddess figurinesof the many cults over the centuries? Yes, despite differences in style, one candiscern common traits. The goddess was faceless, as if to accentuate heruniversality, her ability to \"stand for\" the power of the female. Lacking feet,she appeared to come straight up out of the earth, with which she wasidentified. Unclothed, her very body seemed to have an efficacy. Often—but notalways— she was big-breasted, and her hands were frequently placed under herbreasts as if to display them. Many figurines show her entire body as ample,with huge breasts, belly, and buttocks, as if the very plenitude of her bodywould insure plentiful crops and herds. Sometimes she is pregnant, her enlargedbelly emphasized by special markings. Sometimes she was sculpted nursing achild. Then again, she may be slender, the emphasis falling not on herprocreative potency but on her sexual powers. In this case, her genitalsreceived particular emphasis. In other representations she appears in a regalpose, often holding or supported by an animal or wearing jewelry, perhapsindicating that she was patroness of artisans. But regardless of manifestationor setting, it is clear that she was seen as a chief magical source of power,both spiritual and material.I became interested in the prehistoric goddess when I first asked myself, \"Whatwould a religion created, at least in part, by women be like? What values wouldit express? What needs would it meet?\" I knew that the Western religioustradition in which I had been raised, with its narrow patriarchalism, did notmeet my spiritual needs, but I had no knowledge of alternative religious ideas.Although I was drawn to the ancient female figurines as expressions of femalepower, I could not appropriate them as meaningful symbols in my own religiouslife because they were from cultures totally alien to my own. The hunting andgathering groups and the early agricultural settlements that had produced thecults of the goddess were unknown to me. I discovered that I needed tounderstand the societies that had produced these female cults before I couldappropriate the meaning of the prehistoric goddess for myself.One must start with the question of women's roles in prehistoric cultures, atopic which, given the lack of textual evidence, is controversial amongscholars. How much power did women wield in prehistoric societies, in theearlier hunting and gathering economies or the later agricultural settlementsthat emerged in the Neolithic period?It has been argued widely that although artifact and myth may suggest thatfemales held important roles in early societies, the actual power of women wasillusory. It has been contended in addition that the projection of female images(by men, presumably) can be in itself a sign of women's subjugation. Whetherwoman is depicted as a sex object (Astarte or Eve) or as a magical virgin mother(the cult of Mary, for instance), the symbol serves as the projection of maleneeds, not as the expression of female experience or values.Some scholars have agreed that women have never held dominant positions in anysociety, and thus have never been able to shape institutions to their own needs.I maintain that, although this analysis is true for many cultures, including ourown, it may not apply to all early societies. In the first place, we simply donot know enough about the political organization of prehistoric groups to sayforsure what was the balance of power between the genders. It seems premature,therefore, to close the door on the possibility that prehistoric women mighthave had the power to express themselves in an autonomous way in some areas oftheir lives.It should be clear, however, that I am not talking about matriarchy. Inacknowledging that matriarchy was a myth, we are free to ask a more realisticquestion about prehistoric societies: Did men and women perhaps relate in waysother than dominance/subjection? Male-dominant modes of social organization,after all, may not be the only types that humans have devised. Eleanor Leacock,for example, has shown that in some hunting and gathering societies women sharepolitical authority when they have control over economic resources, a pointpertinent to the study of Neolithic women because the new wealth of that societywas based on agriculture, domestication of animals, weaving, and potterymaking—all activities associated in some degree with women's invention andcontrol.Our problem lies, at least in part, in the word dominance, for it is, in fact,foolish to judge this material by our common definitions of power. When we applythe usual Western concept of centralized power or of \"power over\" to tribal orearly urban societies, we may well be led to ask the wrong questions. Power canbe seen as power with rather than power over, and it can be used for competenceand cooperation, rather than dominance and control. In reflecting on thedependence on nature that prehistorical people had to contend with, it occurredto me that a cooperative use of power may have been necessary, indeed crucial,for them: it is this different concept of power which I want to use. It ispossible that neither patriarchy nor matriarchy describes the methods of earlycommunity control, and that these terms, which come from nineteenth-centurycomparative religious studies, are useless in analyzing many preliteratecultures.However the issue of gender relations is decided, an understanding of the rolesprehistoric women played is essential to an analysis of their religion,dominated as it was by powerful female imagery. We must learn what we can abouttheir economic roles and their family arrangements, matters which variedaccording to the natural resources and level of technology of each society. Forthis reason, rather than surveying goddess cults over the centuries and vastgeographical areas in which they were found, I will focus on the evidence for afemale cult in one society, an early urban center of Anatolia that thrivedduring the sixth millennium B.C. This site, called Qatal Hiiyuk and rich inevidence of a female cult, was excavated by the British archaeologist JamesMellaart. By studying its burial customs, its family organization, the sourcesof its wealth, its shrine decorations and carved figurines, we will be able toreconstruct much of the social, economic, and religious life in a Neolithictown. Then, and only then, can we answer whether it was possible for women thereto assert themselves autonomously, that is, to express their spiritual needsdirectly through the public channels of power.What was this culture like? To begin to answer this question, one must firstpicture a town built like a beehive: no streets, no large plaza, no palace; thehomes were one-story abodes entered from the roof by a ladder and showed verylittle variation in wealth or possessions. Inside each one-room mud-brick housewas a hearth and an oven. Every house had a large sleeping platform, alwaysalong the east wall, accentuated by wooden posts painted red; the skeletons ofwomen and of some of the children were buried under this platform. Smallerplatforms were scattered about the room in varying positions, children buriedunder some, men under others, but never children and men together. The houseswere kept immaculately clean; refuse and sewage were disposed of in smallcourtyards.This tightly constructed mass of housing was apparently a perfect defense: thereis no evidence of invasion or violent destruction in the entire 1,000-yearperiod of occupation.The textiles and pottery found on the site are the earliest known and indicate aremarkably high level of specialization. Weaving of wool, flax, and grass;chipping and polishing of stone tools and weapons; and manufacture of beads,copper, lead jewelry, fine wooden vessels, and simple pottery were performedwith such artistry that Mellaart assumes they were carried out by speciallytrained workers. Only gold and silver are missing from the materials he hadhoped to find.Trade was carried on far and wide in order to bring these raw materials to QatalHuyuk. Timber was imported from the Taurus Mountains, shells from theMediterranean, obsidian from the volcanic peaks near (Jatal Huyuk, flint fromsouth of the Taurus. But the wealth of these people lay primarily in theirabundant farm produce. They ate plentifully from their crops of barley, peas,wheat, almonds, apples, and pistachios; they may have had yogurt and honey. Theymade wine from the hackberry and procured both milk and meat from domesticatedsheep, cows, and goats.Impressive as the economic production is, what is most extraordinary about thisNeolothic town is that it has revealed a surprising number of shrines, one forevery four or five homes in the area so far excavated. Because they are sonumerous, they were most likely family shrines for extended family groups. Wecan identify them as sanctuaries by the ritual themes painted on their walls,their extravagant decorations of bulls' horns, bulls' heads, plaster goddessreliefs, cult statues, and evidence of elaborate burials. The practices ofpainting a handprint on sacred objects (the child's handprint on the breast of agoddess, for instance) and of destroying the sacred objects when a shrine fellinto disuse offer conclusive proof that these buildings were set aside for acultic purpose. However, there are no provisions for sacrifice, no altars orpits for blood or bones, such as later Bronze Age sites would lead us to expect.Although offerings were made to the deity—gifts of grain, stamp-seals, weapons,and votive figurines—there were no burnt offerings. Whatever the cult was, itwas not bloody. What then was the religion that was celebrated here? Can wespeculate without written records? Mellaart believes not only that we canspeculate but that we must. He bases his decision on the wall paintings, whichare the earliest-known frescoes painted on constructed walls. Admitting thedifficulty of understanding thesereliefs without an accompanying text, he maintains that we must interpret them,for if ever an early society tried to communicate through its art, this societytried, through these lively, natural, lifelike figures.The earliest shrines have no goddesses, but are dominated by animal paintingsand bulls' horns. Mellaart assumes that the hunt was then still an importantfood source and was seen as the great, magical source of power in the people'slives. Then, around 6200 B.C., the first goddess appears, in plaster outline onthe wall, her legs spread wide, giving birth; below her, rows of plasterbreasts, nipples painted red, are molded over animal skulls or jaws thatprotrude through the nipples. Already at her first appearance she is the deityof both life and death. She is the goddess of crops as well, as is suggested bythe many statuettes of the goddess found in grain bins. Mellaart concurs withscholars who claim that women were the primary discoverers of agriculture andassumes therefore that women controlled this activity. He concludes that atQatal Huyuk, agriculture was replacing hunting as the preeminent source of foodand wealth, that the women controlled the new form of wealth and status, andthat they introduced the new female religious images.The goddess is faceless, usually naked, sometimes covered with a robe. She maybe shown as a maiden (that is, not pregnant) who is running or dancing andwhirling, her hair streaming behind her in the wind. Many times she is shownbig-bellied with pregnancy, or actually giving birth. She is portrayed as thetwin goddess, one of whom gives birth to an enormous bull. A human figure ispictured doing homage to a triple-goddess figure, the human covering her face asshe approaches the deity. We may ask if the goddess shrines were specialsanctuaries for women having difficulty in childbirth, for in one shrine, theskeletons of a woman and a baby were found buried together, and the body of aprematurely born child was carefully deposited nearby. One of the shrines isdecorated entirely with floral patterns or textile designs, indicating that thegoddess was the patroness of weaving. As the goddess of wild animals, she isshown flanked by leopards or holding leopard cubs.As is true of many early goddesses, she is the deity of death as well as oflife. Statues show her as a grim-faced goddess accompanied by a vulture. Many ofthe shrine wall paintings portray huge vultures attacking small headless humanfigures. In one such mural, painted above a row of four human skulls, thevulture in the painting appears to have human legs. Mellaart speculates fromthis that \"priestesses\" dressed themselves as vultures in order to preside overfuneral rites. Because the care with which the dead were deposited indicates abelief in life after death, the goddess of death is in reality the goddess ofanother kind of life.Mellaart is convinced that there was a priestly class at (Jatal Hiiyuk, and thatmany of its practitioners were female. He observed that many abodes in what hecalls the priestly quarter did not contain the usual equipment for weaving,spinning, reaping grain, or chipping stone. Lacking these standard tools, theoccupants must have purchased essential items ready-made from the bazaar. Hecalls this professional priestly caste \"elegant sophisticates.\"0Further evidence for a priesthood lies in the wall paintings, in which women andmen dressed in leopard skins are shown chasing and dancing around deer andbulls. Mellaart assumes that only special persons could dress in rare leopardskins, and so concludes that some persons were set aside as priests andpriestesses. His strongest evidence, however, comes from burials within shrines,where skeletons were buried with more care and with somewhat finer gifts thanmost of the home burials, although without indication of a wide differential inwealth. A number of the female skeletons are painted with red ochre (this doesnot occur outside shrines) are buried with costly obsidian mirrors. Males areaccompanied by belt-fasteners, perhaps those born with the leopard-skincostumes. These burials represent a privileged class of people, possibly apriestly class. The majority of these shrine burials are of females.Statues of male gods, found only outside shrines, show either a very young or abearded male, usually riding on or standing beside bulls or leopards. But exceptfor these figurines, the male is not depicted; he is represented only by bulls'or rams' horns. Mellaart assumes that the bull or ram was considered \"a moreimpressive exponent of male fertility\" than the human form. Another statue showstwo scenes: on one side, two figures embracing, and on the other, a womanholding a child. Mellaart interprets the child as the product of the embrace andsurmises that the population of Qatal Hiiyiik understood the role of the male inhuman conception. Although the male is represented in far fewer carvings(usually in connection with hunting) and although he appears to be strictlysubordinate to the goddess, Mellaart believes that the male deity was still anobject of \"confidence, pride, and virility\" at (Jatal Hiiyuk. He may have beenboth the goddess's son and her consort, but he was not sacrificed—the dying godwas probably not yet known in neolithic Anatolia. Mellaart concludes that men atQatal Hiiyiik were figures still to be reckoned with, and that whatever forms ofcommunity control existed were shared by women and men.Some statues show the goddess with a daughter, others show a son. Her daughtermay be her successor; there may have been a religious hierarchy of females.In the last period in which (Jatal Hiiyiik was occupied, a shrine devoted to thehunt, decorated with hunt murals, was painted over with white paint. A bit laterit was destroyed in order to build over it a shrine dedicated to agriculture andweaving, containing nine statuettes of the goddess. Mellaart speculates:Sometime in the fifty-eighth century B.C. agriculture finally triumphed over theage-old occupation of hunting and with it the power of the woman increased: thismuch is clear from the almost total disappearance of male statues in the cult, aprocess [observable elsewhere in Anatolia later. ]What conclusions, then, can be drawn about the roles of women in this society?Looking at women in the family, Mellaart interprets the family burial customs,in which the woman is always, the man never, buried under the main platform, tomean that the family centered around the woman, was matrilocaland probably matrilineal, and that women chose their mates. In the publicsphere, the usual public leadership roles appear not yet to have existed: thereis no evidence of central political organization, no major role for the military(no evidence of warfare whatever for a one-thousand-year period), and finally,no hunting ritual. Therefore, the positions of power that men usually hold didnot exist. But in contrast to our lack of knowledge about male authority, wehave evidence that women exercised certain kinds of power at (Jatal Huyiik,because its chief source of wealth was agriculture and women were in charge ofits development. They controlled the home and the economy, and eventually theymolded the religion, incorporating into it their concerns about the fertility ofcrops and humans.Mellaart makes a case for an impressive female status in this Neolithic society,a status that enabled women not necessarily to control the society but toexpress their own values and experiences in it. One of Mellaart s arguments forfemale creation of the religion is a bit farfetched. He posits that eroticism inart is \"inevitably connected with male impulse and desire\"—a dubious premise—andthat because the art shows no erotic symbolism, no phallus or vulva, but insteadstresses breasts, navel, and pregnant belly, it must have been commissioned bywomen. Whatever may have seemed erotic to the people of Qatal Huyiik, male orfemale, my own feelings are that the female representations convey a sense ofdignity and great strength, more like objects of awe than sex objects. I agreewith Mellaart, therefore, that the artwork does not appear to be erotic, and Iwould add that, with the exception of the ambiguous vultures, it does not relateto the demonic; it does not, therefore, express two of the themes commonlyassociated with the female in art. It is, rather, a celebration of fecundity andrebirth, and of the beauty and strength of textiles, animals, and women. And itis powerful.More convincing is Mellaart's argument that (Jatal Huyiik women created QatalHuyiik religion by performing or controlling many of the economic tasks. In thatway women gained authority in the community and became predominant in thepriestly class. From this base they created the community's religion, a religiondevoted to the conservation of life in all forms, devoted to the mysteries ofbirth and nourishment and life after death.I know what I felt when I first saw the ruins of a shrine at (Jatal Huyiik: thegoddess figure above the rows of breasts and bulls' horns, her legs stretchedwide, giving birth, was a symbol of life and creativity such as I had not seenin the Western church. But fertility symbols are no longer a sufficient imagefor twentieth-century women, just as the impressive agricultural society thatproduced those symbols no longer relates to our day. We cannot, therefore, goback to the ancient goddess cults.But neither can we ignore these alternatives to the images of Western religions.Here is ample evidence that female deities were predominant in the religiouslives of many people for millennia, and they raise the possibility that femalevalues and experiences were expressed in the cults. They are thus an inspirationto women today who struggle to take their lives seriously (that is, gaineconomic independence) and to express their spirituality in new ways.— The Goddesses and Gods of Old EuropeMARIJA GIMBUTASMarija Gimbutas is professor of European archaeology at the University ofCalifornia at Los Angeles and curator of Old World Archaeology at the UCLAMuseum of Cultural History. In this selection, Gimbutas describes imageryassociated with the goddess and shows how that imagery expresses the basicassumptions of the cultures in which it was found. By understanding the imageryof the goddess as reflected in various cultures, the reader can begin tounderstand how that imagery and the myths of the goddess have been transformedfrom the earliest times.INTRODUCTION1 he tradition of sculpture and painting encountered in Old Europe wastransmitted from the Palaeolithic era. In art and mythical imagery it is notpossible to draw a line between the two eras, Palaeolithic and Neolithic, justas it is not possible to draw a line between wild and domestic plants andanimals. Much of the symbolism of the early agriculturists was taken over fromthe hunters and fishers. Such images as the fish, snake, bird, or horns are notNeolithic creations; they have roots in Palaeolithic times. And yet, the art andmyths of the first farmers differed in inspiration and hence in form and contentfrom those of the hunters and fishers.Clay and stone figurines were being fashioned long before pottery was first madearound 6500 B.C. The vast increase in sculptures in Neolithic times and theextent to which they departed from Palaeolithic types was not caused bytechnological innovations, but by the permanent settlement and growth ofcommunities. A farming economy bound the villages to the soil, to the biologicalrhythms of the plants and animals upon which their existence wholly depended.Cyclical change, death and resurrection, were ascribed to the supernaturalpowers and in consequence special provision was made to protect the capriciouslife forces and assure their perpetuation. As early as the seventh millenniumB.C. traits associated with the psychology and religion of the farmer are acharacteristic feature of sculptural art. This art was not consciously imitativeof natural forms but sought rather to express abstract conceptions.About 30,000 miniature sculptures of clay, marble, bone, copper or gold arepresently known from a total of some 3000 sites of the Neolithic andChalcolithic era in southeastern Europe. Enormous quantities of ritual vessels,altars, sacrificial equipment, inscribed objects, clay models of temples, actualtemples and pictorial paintings on vases or on the walls of shrines, alreadyattest a genuine civilization.The three millennia saw a progressive increase in stylistic diversity, producingever greater variety of individual forms. Simultaneously, a more naturalisticexpression of anatomical generalities gradually emancipated itself from aninitial subordination to the symbolic purpose. The study of these morearticulated sculptures, their ideograms and symbols and the highly developedvase painting enabled the author to distinguish the different types of goddessesand gods, their epiphanies, their devotees, and the cult scenes with which theywere associated. Thus, it is possible to speak of a pantheon of gods, and toreconstruct the various costumes and masks, which throw much light on ritualdrama and life as it was then lived.Through the deciphering of stereotype images and signs with the help ofquantitative and qualitative analyses it becomes clear that these earlyEuropeans expressed their communal worship through the medium of the idol. Inthe miniature sculptures of Old Europe the emotions are made manifest in ritualdrama involving many actors, both gods and worshippers. Much the same practiceseems to have been current in Anatolia, Syria, Palestine and Mesopotamia in thecorresponding periods, but only in southeastern Europe is such a quantity offigurines available for a comparative study.The shrines, cult objects, magnificent painted and black pottery, costumes,elaborate religious ceremonialism, and a rich mythical imagery far more complexthan was hitherto assumed, speak of a refined European culture and society. Nolonger can European Neolithic-Chalcolithic developments be summed up in the oldaxiom, Ex oriente lux.When the magnificent treasures of the Minoan civilization were unravelled in thebeginning of the twentieth century, Sir Arthur Evans wrote: \"I venture tobelieve that the scientific study of Greek civilization is becoming less andless possible without taking into constant account that of the Minoan andMycenaean world that went before it.\" While his remark was amply justified, thequestion of what went before the Minoan civilization remained to be posed. Nowit is becoming less and less possible to understand the Minoan civilizationwithout the study of the culture which preceded it. The study of this culture,to which I have applied the name \"Old Europe,\" reveals new chronologicaldimensions and a new concept of the beginning of European civilization. It wasnot a single small legendary island claimed by the sea some 9000 years ago thatgave rise to the fabulous civilization of Crete and the Cyclades, but aconsiderable part of Europe surrounded by the eastern Mediterranean, Aegean andAdriatic Seas. The many islands were an aid to navigation and facilitatedcommunication with Anatolia, Levant and Mesopotamia. Fertile river valleys luredthe first farmers deeper inland into the Balkan Peninsula and Danubian Europe.Old Europe is a product of hybridization of Mediterranean and Temperatesoutheast-European peoples and cultures.European civilization between 6500 and 3500 B.C. was not a provincial reflectionof Near Eastern civilization, absorbing its achievements through diffusion andperiodic invasions, but a distinct culture developing a unique identity. Manyaspects of this culture remain to be explored. One of the main purposes of thisbook is to present, as it were, the spiritual manifestations of Old Europe.Mythical imagery of the prehistoric era tells us much about humanity—itsconcepts of the structure of the cosmos, of the beginning of the world and ofhuman, plant and animal life, and also its struggle and relations with nature.It cannot be forgotten that through myth, images and symbols man comprehendedand manifested his being.SCHEMATISMShorthandIn the earliest level of the Vinca mound, representing the Neolithic Star-cevocomplex, a ceramic figurine usually described as a \"seated goddess with largebuttocks and cylindrical neck\" was found. For a female representation it has anextremely reduced form, with no distinction between head and torso, and only acylindrical neck adjoining the buttocks. Its general shape suggests a bird butthere is no indication of wings, beak or bird-legs. Even as a hybrid, perhapshalf-woman and half-bird, it needlessly lacks naturalistic detail.This means that we are confronted with the problem of determining the artist'sultimate intention. In the first place we must decide what the sculpturepresents, its subject matter; beyond this, we must also try to understand itssymbolic content, for only in this way can we hope to comprehend thepsychosocial dynamic that inspired its production.Satratigraphical evidence shows that this figurine dates from roughly 6000 B.C.,and there are many like it in sites of the same period. Some figurines are evenmore reduced, rendering the merest outline of human or bird form. Excavation ofNeolithic sites has yielded numerous 'bumpy' figurines, often little more thantwo centimetres long, which archaeologists classify only as indeterminate orambiguous objects. Examined as isolated, individual pieces they remainenigmatic, their role unknown; but once we identify these miniatures asbelonging to a single homogeneous group of figures, they can be recognized asvastly reduced versions of the larger \"steatopygous\" figurine-type which will befully described in later chapters. With these and many larger figures lacking indetail, it is evident that the sculptor was not striving for aesthetic effects;he was producing sculptural \"shorthand,\" an abstract symbolic conceptual art,images that were emblematic of the divine regardless of the extent of theirschematization. The true meaning of the figures can best be sought in the moredetailed, less abstracted figurines which reveal the naturalistic detail thatbetrays subject matter and so brings us closer to understanding the content ofthe work.Sculptural \"shorthand,\" unthinking and repetitive, illustrates the conservativenature of the tradition within which the sculptor worked; each culturetranslates its basic explanatory assumptions into equivalent form structures andcreativity is only expressed in subtle variations from the socially prescribednorms. For the sociocultural historian it is more important to examine theconventional than the few and slight deviations from it, since his work is tocomprehend the inherited and collective—rather than the individual—psyche.The Neolithic Artist's Reality — Not a Physical RealityBoth figurine subject matter and the formal repetition of the collectivelyapproved style give an insight into the content and purpose of figurine art. Artreveals man's mental response to his environment, for with it he attempts tointerpret and subdue reality, to rationalize nature and give visual expressionto his mythologizing explanatory concepts. The chaotic forms of nature,including the human form, are disciplined. While the Cycladic figurines of thethird millennium B.C. are the most extremely geometricized, rigid constraint ofthis kind, though less marked, characterizes most of the groups of Old EuropeanNeolithic and Chalcolithic figures. The artist's reality is not a physicalreality, though he endows the concept with a physical form, which istwo-dimensional, constrained and repetitive. Supernatural powers were conceivedas an explanatory device to induce an ordered experience of nature'sirregularities. These powers were given form as masks, hybrid figures andanimals, producing a symbolic, conceptual art not given to physical naturalism.The primary purpose was to transform and spiritualize the body and to surpassthe elementary and corporeal.It follows, then, that formal reduction should not be ascribed to the technicalinability of the Neolithic artist to model in the round but to requirementsdictated by deeply implanted concepts and beliefs. Nevertheless, since we aredealing with an art that has often been termed \"primitive\" in a partiallypejorative sense, it is necessary to digress briefly in defence of the Neolithicsculptor's ability and to stress that he was not limited to unnaturalistic formsby the inadequacy of his manual skills, the nature of his raw materials or thelack of necessary techniques. In short, old European figurine art was theoutcome of skilled craftsmanship, conforming to matured traditions.The beginnings of pottery manufacture are blurred in the archaeological record,for the earliest clay vessels and artifacts were unbaked and have not survived.The earliest fired ceramics, including fine burnished and painted wares from thelate seventh millenium B.C., are articulately modelled and reveal a completemastery of ceramic technology. Stone and bone was finely carved and ground:Proto-Sesklo and Starcevo villagers in the Aegean area and central Balkansfashioned beau jful spoons of bone and painstakingly ground miniature stoneornaments such as perforated pendants and buttons. The serpentine toad from thesite of Nea Nikomedeia in Macedonia is an outstanding work of art of the seventhmillennium B.C.Stone and bone sculptures are few compared to those of clay, but they show alike degree of stylization, though one might expect them to be, if anything,more schematic still. Two sculptures have been selected to demonstrate this: atypical Early Vinca clay figurine with a triangular masked head, bump for anose, slanting incised eyes, stump-arms, projecting buttocks andnaturalistically modelled breasts and navel; and the marble figurine fromGradac, also of the EarlyVinca period. The different raw materials do dictate a differing expression butthe figures are alike in style and detail. Both comprise masked heads, armstumps and inarticulate legs. Other marble sculptures are still more reduced,lacking all facial features. During the fifth millennium, carving in marblebecame more self-conscious and emancipated itself from the influence ofclay-modelling. Bone figures were entirely schematic. A fifth-millennium exampleof a stylized human figure carved out of bone from a grave in the cemetery ofCernica near Bucharest is a case in point. Its head is broken. The two roundedprotuberances apparently portray folded arms. The abdominal and pubic area isemphasized. Although drastically reduced, this little sculpture is probably aportrayal of a Great Goddess in a rigid position, standing in the nude withfolded arms, a type encountered in graves throughout the Old European period andin the Cyclades of the third millennium B.C. Almost all of the known figurinesof copper and gold are schematic, two-dimensional silhouettes of the human body,cut from a flat piece of material.Throughout the seventh and sixth millennia B.C. figurine art was clearlydominated by abstract forms such as cylindrical pillar-like necks and a hybridtorso of female buttocks and a bird's body, but at the same time other quitedifferent forms were produced, some of them strikingly naturalistic. Anexceptional female figurine assigned to the Sesklo period in Thessaly sits in arelaxed position with her legs to one side, her hands resting on her thighs. Inprofile the nose is exaggerated and beaked but the head and body arenaturalistically proportioned, dispensing with the pillar-like neck of earliersculptures.The Trend Towards More Naturalistic Sculpture in the Chalcolithic EraThe gradual trend toward more naturalistic sculpture can be traced in the Vincastatuary. The Vinca mound and other Vinca settlements provide a large group offigurines combining schematization of the upper part of the body with almostnaturalistic modelling below. A sculpture from SeleVac in central Yugoslaviaprovides a classic example in this series: the figure has exquisitely modelledabdomen and hips, the legs merging to provide a stable base. The head isschematized, pentagonal, with semi-globular plastic eyes: the arms arerepresented by perforated stumps. One of the most exquisite sculptures from theVinca site is a perfectly proportioned squatting woman, unfortunately headless.Another remarkable Vinca sculpture, also headless, from the site of Fafos,depicts a man with knees drawn tightly to his chest, his hands placed on themand his back bent slightly forward. His life-like posture, with theexceptionally accurate modelling of the arms and the hands tightly grasping theknees, is unique in European art of c. 5000 B.C.An exquisite rendering of the rounded parts of a female body, especially abdomenand buttocks, occurs occasionally in all parts of Old Europe. An extraordinaryseries of male sculptures, each individually seated on a stool, is distinguishedfor perfection in portrayal of the male body, particularly the slightly curvingback.The excavation of the Butmir site yielded several finely executed heads,remarkable for their realism; the conventional masked features are here replacedby a well-modelled forehead, eyebrows, nose, lips, chin and ears. Unmasked humanheads modelled in the round occasionally occur in other cultural groups; even inthe Cucuteni area, in which figurine art reached an extreme of schematicsymbolism, a few naturalistically rendered human heads were discovered, witheyes, nostrils and mouth shown by impressed holes. Figurines with unmasked headsand human facial features comprise the rarest category of Neolithic andChalcolithic sculptures.The finest sculpture was certainly the product of exceptionally gifted membersof society, though the varying intensity of individual motivation would also bereflected in the quality of the artifact. Nevertheless the cruder figurineswhich were the norm were no less rich in symbolic content.Hekate and Artemis: Survival of the Old European Great Goddess in Ancient Greeceand Western AnatoliaThe question now arises as to what happened to the prehistoric goddess after thethird millennium B.C. Did she disappear after the advent of the patriarchalIndo-European world or did she survive the dramatic change?In Minoan (non-Indo-European) Crete the Great Goddess is seen in representationson frescoes, rings and seals. She is shown in association with bulls, orbull-horns, \"double-axes\" (butterflies), he-goats or lions. On a stamp fromKnossos she appears as a lady of nature untamed on top of a mountain flanked bytwo lions and a male human worshipper. On a gold ring from Isopata near Knossosthe butterfly- or bee-headed goddess is, as we have seen, surrounded byworshippers in festive garments wearing insect masks. She is represented onfrescoes accompanied by worshippers, women or men in festive garments withupraised arms. Gigantic dogs portrayed on steatite vases or on cylinder sealsare probably the companions of the same goddess. She or her animals,particularly the bulls, dominate the ritualistic scenes throughout the Palaceperiod of Minoan Crete.In Greece, as in India, the Great Goddess survived the superimposedIndo-European cultural horizon. As the predecessor of Anatolian and GreekHekate-Artemis (related to Kubaba, Kybebe/Cybele) she lived through the BronzeAge, then through Classical Greece and even into later history in spite oftransformations of her outer form and the many different names that were appliedto her. The image of Hekate-Artemis of Caria, Lydia and Greece, based ondescriptions of early Greek authors, vase paintings, and finds in actualsanctuaries dedicated to this multifunctional goddess, supplement and verify ourunderstanding of the appearance and functions of the prehistoric goddess.Written sources pour blood into her veins of stone, clay, bone or gold.In name and character she is a non-Greek, a non-Indo-European goddess. The nameof Artemis is known from Greek, Lydian and Etruscan inscriptions and texts. Itsantiquity is demonstrated by the appearance of the words A-ti-mi-te andA-ti-mi-to, the dative and genetive case of her name, on Linear B tablets fromPylos. Hekate (Hekabe) was Asiatic, not known to the Greeks in name. She wasEnodia in Thessaly, perhaps an earlier name later replaced by Hekate. WhetherArtemis and Hekate appear as two goddesses or as one, they bothikbelong to the moon cycle. Hekate, gruesome and linked with death; Artemis,youthful and beautiful, reflecting the purity of untouched nature and linkedwith motherhood.In Caria (western Turkey) Hekate was the primary goddess. Mysteries and gameswere performed in her sanctuary at Lagina. In Colophon, dogs were sacrificed toher and she herself could turn into a dog. West of Lagina was Zerynthos, fromwhich Hekate derived her name of Zerynthia. In Samothrace, there was a cavecalled Zerynthos associated with Hekate. Dogs were sacrificed there andmysteries and orgiastic dances were performed. Hekate and her dogs are describedas journeying over the graves of the dead and above the sacrificed blood. In thedays of Aristophanes and Aischylos she is the mistress of the night road wholeads travellers astray, of cross ways, of fate, and of the world of the dead,being known by both names, Hekate and Artemis. As Queen of the Ghosts, Hekatesweeps through the night followed by her baying hounds; as Enodia she is theguardian of crossroads and gates. Her sanctuaries stood at the gate to ahill-fort or at the entrance to a house. Pregnant women sacrificed to Enodia toensure the goddess' help at birth. There is no mention in Aischylos ofHekate-Artemis assisting at birth. Clay figurines of the goddess in a seatedposition were sacrificed to her. A terracotta medallion found in the AthenianAgora portrays a triple-bodied Hekate-Artemis with stag and dog flanking her.She holds a torch, whip and bow-and-arrow. Sophocles in Antigone mentions Enodiaas Persephone, the ruler of the dead. The torch of the goddess probably relatesto the fertilizing power of the moon since Hekate's torches were carried aroundthe freshly sown fields to promote their fertility. Statues of Roman Diana showher crowned with the crescent and carrying a raised torch. Hekate is responsiblefor lunacy and, on the positive side, is Giver of Vision.The Lady of free and untamed nature and the Mother, protectress of weaklings, adivinity in whom the contrasting principles of virginity and motherhood arefused into the concept of a single goddess, was venerated in Greece, Lydia,Crete and Italy. She appears as Aretemis and under many local names: Dik-tynna,Pasiphae, Europa (\"the wide-glancing one\"), Britomartis (\"the sweet virgin\") inCrete, Laphria in Aetolia, Kallisto (\"the beautiful\") in Arkadia, or Agrotera(\"the wild\"), and Diana in Rome. She, 'the pure and strong one', was surroundedby nymphs, flanked by animals, and as huntress dominated the animal world. Gameswith bulls were among the rituals of this goddess. She was present everywhere innature, above all in hills, forests, meadows, and fertile valleys, and often wastherioform, appearing as a bear or doe. The Arkadian Kallisto, her companion anddouble, was said to have assumed the form of a bear. The stag is her standingattribute in plastic art; she is called 'stag-huntress' in the Homeric Hymns.Her companion Taygete was transformed into a doe and in the legend of the Alodaeshe herself assumes that form. Pausanias' records that in the temple of Despoinain Arcadia her statue was clothed with deer pelt. Near Colophon lay a smallisland sacred to Artemis to which it was believed pregnant does swam in order tobear their young. Well-bred Athenian girls of marriageable age danced as bearsin honour of Artemis of Brauronia, and during rites of cult-initiation girls'became bears, arktoi. In paintings on vases, the worshippers ofArtemis wore animals masks while dancing. The girls and women of Lake-demoniaperformed orgiastic dances to glorify Artemis. Fat men, padded and masked ascomic actors, participated in fertility dances for Artemis. We can recognizetheir ancestors in the masked and padded men of the Vinca culture ofc. 5000 B.C.Offerings to Artemis include phalli and all species of animals and fruits, forshe was protector of all life, bestowing fertility on humans, animals andfields, and the sacrifice of any living thing was appropriate to her. Accordingto the legend adapted by Sophocles, the most beautiful girl of the year,Iphigeneia, had to be sacrificed to the goddess. The possibility of humansacrifice is suggested by the fact that Artemis herself is called Iphigeneia inHermione and Ageira and that human sacrifice was performed for Laphria who wasalso Artemis. Mutilated beasts, from which \"a member was cut off,\" weresacrificed to Artemis in Boeotia, Euboea and Attica. In Asia Minor, in the greatspring festival of Cybele, the shorn genitals of her priests were consecrated toher. He-goat and stag were particularly appreciated sacrificial animals, andalso the hare, a moon animal. In nearly all shrines dedicated to Artemisspindle-whorls, loom weights, shuttles and kallatoi have been found and frominscriptions in sanctuaries it is known that woollen and linen clothes andthreads wound on spools were offered as gifts to her. On Corinthian vases,Artemis and her priestesses are seen holding a spindle.She appeared at births as the birth-giving goddess, Artemis Eileithyia(\"Child-bearing\"). Figurines in a seated position were sacrificed to her. Dianaalso presided over childbirth and was called \"Opener of the Womb.\" As theBear-Mother she nursed, reared and protected the newly born with the pietasma-terna of a bear. Tithenidia, the festival of nurses and nurslings in Sparta,honoured her name.This goddess, as Otto poetically observed, mirrors the divine femininity ofnature. Unlike the Earth-Mother who gives birth to all life, sustains it, and inthe end receives it back into her bosom, she reflects the virginity of naturewith its brilliance and wildness, with its guiltless purity and its strangeness.And yet, intertwined with this crystal-clear essence were the dark roots ofsavage nature. Artemis of Brauronia aroused madness. Her anger caused the deathof women in childbirth.It is no mere coincidence that the venerated goddess of the sixth and fifthcenturies in Ancient Greece resembles the Goddess of Life and Death of the sixthand fifth millennii B.C. Mythical images last for many millennia. In her variousmanifestations—strong and beautiful Virgin, Bear-Mother, and Life-giver andLife-taker—the Great Goddess existed for at least five thousand years before theappearance of Classical Greek civilization. Village communities worship her tothis day in the guise of the Virgin Mary. The concept of the goddess in bearshape was deeply ingrained in mythical thought through the millennia andsurvives in contemporary Crete as \"Virgin Mary of the Bear.\" In the cave ofAcrotiri near ancient Kydonia, a festival in honour of Panagia (Mary)Ar-koudiotissa ('she of the bear') is celebrated on the second day of February.In European folk beliefs, she still moves within pregnant women in the shape ofawandering uterus or a toad. Each of her feminine aspects, virginity,birth-giving and motherhood, as well as her Terrible Mother aspect, is wellrepresented in figurine art throughout the Neolithic and Chalcolithic eras ofOld Europe.CONCLUSIONSIn figurine art and pictorial painting the agricultural ancestors recreatedtheir mythical world and the worship of their gods. Primordial events, principalpersonalities of the pantheon with their innumerable epiphanies, worshippers andparticipants in ritual ceremonies, all seem to have a life of their own in theirvarious representations.Myths and seasonal drama must have been enacted through the medium of the idol(the figurine), each with a different intention and with the invocation ofappropriate divinities. The multiplicity of purpose and design is shown bysanctuaries, sacrifices, festive attire, masks, figures in dancing or leapingpostures, musical instruments, shrine equipment, ladles and drinking cups, andother numerous and varied representations of objects and events which made upthe context of these religious festivals. In making images of gods, worshippersand actors of the drama, man assured the cyclic returning and renewal of life.Many figurines were ex-votos and like the words of prayer were dedicated to theGreat Goddess, the Bird or Snake Goddess, the Vegetation Goddess, or the MaleGod, a prototype of Dionysus, the daemon of vegetation.Female snake, bird, egg, and fish played parts in creation myths and the femalegoddess was the creative principle. The Snake Goddess and Bird Goddess createthe world, charge it with energy, and nourish the earth and its creatures withthe life-giving element conceived as water. The waters of heaven and earth areunder their control. The Great Goddess emerges miraculously out of death, out ofthe sacrificial bull, and in her body the new life begins. She is not the Earth,but a female human, capable of transforming herself into many living shapes, adoe, dog, toad, bee, butterfly, tree or pillar.The task of sustaining life was the dominating motif in the mythical imagery ofOld Europe, hence regeneration was one of the foremost manifestations.Naturally, the goddess who was responsible for the transformation from death tolife became the central figure in the pantheon of gods. She, the Great Goddess,is associated with moon crescents, quadripartite designs and bull's horns,symbols of continuous creation and change. The mysterious transformation is mostvividly expressed in her epiphany in the shape of a caterpillar, chrysalis andbutterfly. Indeed, through this symbolism our ancestor proclaims that hebelieves in the beauty of young life. The ubiquity of phallic symbols connotesthe glorification of the spontaneous life powers. Phallicism certainly had noobscene allusion; in the context of religious ritual it was a form of catharsis,not of symbolic procreation. There is no evidence that in Neolithic timesmankind understood biological conception.With the inception of agriculture, farming man began to observe the phenomena ofthe miraculous Earth more closely and more intensively than theprevious hunter-fisher had done. A separate deity emerged, the Goddess ofVegetation, a symbol of the sacral nature of the seed and the sown field, whoseties with the Great Goddess are intimate.Significantly, almost all Neolithic goddesses are composite images with anaccumulation of traits from the pre-agricultural and agricultural eras. Thewater bird, deer, bear, fish, snake, toad, turtle, and the notion ofhybridization of animal and man, were inherited from the Palaeolithic era andcontinued to serve as avatars of goddesses and gods. There was no such thing asa religion or mythical imagery newly created by agriculturists at the beginningof the food-producing period.In Old Europe the world of myth was not polarized into female and male as it wasamong the Indo-European and many other nomadic and pastoral peoples of thesteppes. Both principles were manifest side by side. The male divinity in theshape of a young man or a male animal appears to affirm and strengthen theforces of the creative and active female. Neither is subordinate to the other;by complementing one another, their power is doubled.The central theme in re-enaction of myths obviously was the celebration of thebirth of an infant. The baby as the symbol of a new life and the hope ofsurvival is hugged by masked goddesses, Snake, Bird and Bear. Masked Nursesbearing a sack (the \"hunch-back\" figurines) seem to have played a role asprotectresses of the child who later matures and becomes a young god. The malegod, the primeval Dionysus is saturated with a meaning closely related to thatof the Great Goddess in her aspect of the Virgin Nature Goddess and VegetationGoddess. All are gods of nature's life cycle, concerned with the problem ofdeath and regeneration, and all were worshipped as symbols of exuberant life.The pantheon reflects a society dominated by the mother. The role of woman wasnot subject to that of a man, and much that was created between the inception ofthe Neolithic and the blossoming of the Minoan civilization was a result of thatstructure in which all resources of human nature, feminine and masculine, wereutilized to the full as a creative force.The Old European mythical imagery and religious practices were continued inMinoan Crete. The Minoan culture mirrors the same values, the same manualaptitude in artistic endeavour, the same glorification of the virgin beauty oflife. The Old Europeans had taste and style—whimsical, imaginative andsophisticated; their culture was a worthy parent of the Minoan civilization.Some scholars did in the past classify European prehistory and early historyinto matriarchal and patriarchal eras respectively. \"The beginning of thepsychological-matriarchal age,\" says Neumann, \"is lost in the haze ofprehistory, but its end at the dawn of our historical era unfolds magnificentlybefore our eyes.\" It is then replaced by the patriarchal world with itsdifferent symbolism and its different values. This masculine world is that ofthe Indo-Europeans, which did not develop in Old Europe but was superimposedupon it. Two entirely different sets of mythical images met. Symbols of themasculine group replaced the images of Old Europe. Some of the old elements werefused together as a subsidiary of the new symbolic imagery, thus losing theiroriginalmeaning. Some images persisted side by side, creating chaos in the formerharmony. Through losses and additions new complexes of symbols developed whichare best reflected in Greek mythology. One cannot always distinguish the tracesof the old since they are transformed or distorted. And yet it is surprising howlong the Old European mythical concepts have persisted. The study of mythicalimages provides one of the best proofs that the Old European world was not theproto-Indo-European world and that there was no direct and unobstructed line ofdevelopment to the modern Europeans. The earliest European civilization wassavagely destroyed by the patriarchal element and it never recovered, but itslegacy lingered in the substratum which nourished further European culturaldevelopments. The Old European creations were not lost; transformed, theyenormously enriched the European psyche.The teaching of Western civilization starts with the Greeks and rarely do peopleask themselves what forces lay behind these beginnings. But Europeancivilization was not created in the space of a few centuries; the roots aredeeper—by six thousand years. That is to say, vestiges of the myths and artisticconcepts of Old Europe, which endured from the seventh to the fourth millenniumB.C. were transmitted to the modern Western world and became part of itscultural heritage.Unit IVPharaohs Rule: Egypt, the Exodus and the Myth of OsirisThe Egyptian GodsHENRI FRANKFORTHenri Frankfort taught at the University of Chicago and the University ofLondon. He also did extensive fieldwork in the Near East and led excavations inIraq from 1924 to 1937 for the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.These excavations yielded much information about the early history of Babyloniafrom 4,000 to 2,000 b.c.e. In this selection, Frankfort provides an excellentbackground for the study of Egyptian mythology by discussing the gods and theirsymbols and their relationships to human problems in ancient Egypt.THE GODS AND THEIR SYMBOLSXVeligion as we Westerners know it derives its character and its unity from twocircumstances: it centers on the revelation of a single god, and it contains amessage which must be transmitted. The Torah, the Gospels, and Islam containteachings sufficiently coherent for exposition. The Gospel and Islam must,moreover, be preached to the unconverted. In the whole of the ancient worldthere is only one religion with similar characteristics: the monotheistic cultof the sun introduced by the heretic Pharaoh Akhenaten. And Akhenaten was aheretic precisely in this: that he denied recognition to all but one god andattempted to convert those who thought otherwise. His attitude presents noproblem to us; we acknowledge a conviction too deep for tolerance. But Egyptianreligion was not exclusive. It recognized an unlimited number of gods. Itpossessed neither a central dogma nor a holy book. It could flourish withoutpostulating one basic truth.We find, then, in Egyptian religion a number of doctrines which strike us ascontradictory; but it is sheer presumption to accuse the ancients ofmud-dleheadedness on this score. In a recent book the reason and the meaning ofthis apparent confusion have been explained. I can only summarize the argumenthere in a few sentences. The ancients did not attempt to solve the ultimateproblems confronting man by a single and coherent theory; that has been themethod of approach since the time of the Greeks. Ancient thought—mythopoeic,\"myth-making\" thought—admitted side by side certain limited insights, which wereheld to be simultaneously valid, each in its own proper context, eachcorresponding to a definite avenue of approach. I have called this \"multiplicityof approaches,\" and we shall find many examples of it as we proceed. At themoment I want to point out that this habit of thought agrees with the basicexperience of polytheism.Polytheism is sustained by man's experience of a universe alive from end to end.Powers confront man wherever he moves, and in the immediacy of theseconfrontations the question of their ultimate unity does not arise. There aremany gods—one cannot know how many; a small handbook of Egyptian religionenumerates more than eighty. How, then, are they recognized? Here we may welluse the evidence collected by anthropologists among living believers inpolytheism. It appears that superhuman powers reveal themselves sometimes in acuriously accidental manner. For instance, a West African native is on animportant expedition when he suddenly stumbles over a stone. He cries out: \"Ha!Are you there?\"—and takes the stone with him. The stone had, as it were, given ahint that it was powerful, and the Negro strengthened himself by takingpossession of it. Under normal conditions he might not have taken notice of theobstacle that tripped him up, but the importance of the expedition had createdthe emotional tension which makes man receptive to signs of a supernaturalorder. Note that at the very moment that the stone reveals its imminent power,it acquires the quality of a person, for the native exclaims: \"Are you there?\"The next thing to observe is that such impact on a power in the outside worldmay be experienced as either of fleeting or of lasting significance. It will beof permanent significance especially when the community accepts it as valid anda cult is consequently established. For instance, an Ewe Negro enters the bushand finds there a piece of iron. Returning home he falls ill, and the priestsexplain that a divinity is manifesting its potency in the iron and thathenceforth the village should worship it.It seems to me that these examples throw some light upon the fact that Egyptknew a large number of gods and an astonishing variety of cult-objects. But ourexamples do not answer the question why certain experiences acquired a lastingsignificance (the iron) while others (the stone) did not. They show that we neednot expect to be able to answer this question in relation to Egyptian cults, andwe should do well to retain from our excursion among modern savages a certainskepticism as to the value of symbols and sacred objects as indicators of themeaning which the gods designated may have had for their worshipers. If many ofthe sacred objects seem devoid of mystery or meaning to us, it may well be thatthey were originally connected with the cult in a loose and accidental manner,mere adjuncts to an emotional reality from which the cult continued to draw itslife but which we can neither recapture nor reconstruct. On the other hand,certain sacred objects possessed a deeper, a truly symbolical significance, andin such a case the relation between the deity and the object is capable of beingunderstood. This is so, for instance, when the name of the goddess Isis iswritten as if it simply meant \"throne,\" while she is also depicted with thethrone as her distinctive attribute.We know that many peoples consider the insignia of royalty to be charged withthe superhuman power of kingship. Among these objects the throne occupies aspecial place: the prince who seats himself upon it at the coronation arisesking. The throne \"makes\" the king—the term occurs in Egyptian texts— and so thethrone, Isis, is the \"mother\" of the king. This expression might be viewed as ametaphor, but the evidence shows that it was not. The bond between the king andthe throne was the intimate one between his person and the power which made himking. Now a power was not recognized objectively, as the result of anintellectual effort on the part of man. We have seen that the power revealsitself; it is recognized in the relationship of \"I and thou;\" it has the qualityof a person.The throne which \"made\" the king is comprehended as a mother, and thus it may bethe object of profound and complex feelings. If we should try to resolve thecomplexity, we should merely be falsifying the evidence. We can neither say thatIsis was originally the throne personified, nor that the throne acquired atranscendental quality because it was conceived as a mother. The two notions arefundamentally correlated, and mythopoeic thought expresses such a bond as'identity. The throne made manifest a divine power which changed one of severalprinces into a king fit to rule. The awe felt before this manifestation of powerbecame articulate in the adoration of the mother-goddess. There is no questionof any evolution from a simpler to a complex notion. Complexity is of theessence of the relationship between man and deity. As early as the First Dynastya Pharaoh calls himself \"son of Isis.\" We do observe a historical development,but that concerns not the goddess but her cult. Originally Isis was significantonly in her relation to the king; subsequently—and especially through the mythof Osiris, which we shall discuss later—she brought consolation to all men, andthree thousand years after the first appearance of her name in Egypt, monumentswere being erected to her throughout the Roman Empire, up to its very borders onthe Rhine and the Danube.Our discussion of Isis illustrates one possible relationship between the godsand their symbols. Another possibility, as we have said already, is that thesymbol lacks all deeper significance. This thought is especially disturbingbecause the symbols loom very large in our sources; in fact, they constitute inthe case of many a god all—or almost all—we know about him. Moreover, sincesymbols are definite and distinct, they offer a delusive hold to modernresearch. And so one talks glibly of fetishes, sungods, ram-gods, falcon-gods,and so forth—as if the precision of those terms had any reference to the godsthemselves! We must not generalize in this manner. Sometimes the symbol tells ussomething about a god, sometimes it does not; and mostly the evidence on handdoes not allow us to decide one way or the other. But in any case the use ofclassificatory or generic terms in connection with the gods bars the road tounderstanding; for this can only be reached, if at all, by a circumspectinterpretation of each individual case.SACRED ANIMALS AND OTHERNESSThere is one generic term which is most difficult to avoid when we discussEgyptian religion. That is the word \"animal-gods.\" It should not be used, as weshall show in a moment. But we must admit—and the Greek, Roman, and earlyChristian writers too were struck by the fact—that animals play an altogetherunusual role in Egyptian religion. We cannot evade the issue by referring backto what we said a moment ago, namely, that the origin of cults is beyond our kenand that we shall never know how certain gods came to be associated with certainanimals. There are too many gods showing such an association and their cult istoo widespread for us to pretend to understand Egyptian religion without atleast a tentative explanation of this its most baffling, most persistent, and tous most alien feature.It is wrong to say that the worship of animals is a survival from a primitivestratum of Egyptian religion. This view is often encountered and is supported bysome plausible arguments. It is said that these cults are often of purely localsignificance; that they sometimes center on quite insignificant creatures likethe centipede or the toad: and that we must therefore place the sacred animalson a par with certain sacred objects, like the crossed arrows of the goddessNeith. and consider all these symbols as mere emblems of—and means of promoting—tribal unity. Some scholars have even interpreted them as totems. But thecharacteristic features of totemism. such as the claim of descent from thetotem, its sacrifice for a ceremonial feast of the clan, and exogamy, can not befound in Egyptian sources. Moreover, any treatment of the sacred animals whichstresses their local or political significance at the expense of their religiousimportance flies in the face of the evidence. It is undeniable that there issomething altogether peculiar about the meaning which animals possessed for theEgyptians. Elsewhere, in .Africa or North America, for example, it seems thateither the terror of animal strength, or the strong bond, the mutual dependenceof man and beast in the case of cattle cults, for instance . explains animalworship. But in Egypt the animal as such, irrespective of its specific nature,seems to possess religious significance: and the significance was so great thateven the mature speculation of later times rarely dispensed with animal forms inplastic or literary images referring to the gods.But there was nothing metaphorical in the connection between god and animal inEgypt. It is not as if certain divine qualities were made articulate by thecreature, in the way the eagle elucidates the character of Zeus. We observe, onthe contrary, a strange link between divinity and actual beast, so that in timesof decadence animal worship may gain a horrible concreteness. Then one findsmummified cats. dogs, falcons, bulls, crocodiles, and so forth, buried by thehundreds in vast cemeteries which fill the Egyptologist with painfulembarrassment—for this, we must admit, is polytheism with a vengeance.Nevertheless, these are grotesque but significant symptoms of a characteristictrait in Egyptian religion.To understand this trait, we should first realize that the relation between agod and his animal may vary greatly. If Horus is said to be a falcon whose eyesare sun and moon and whose breath is the cooling north wind, we may think thatthis was a mere image to describe an impressive god of the sky. But the god wasdepicted as a bird from the earliest times and was apparently believed to bemanifest either in individual birds or in the species. Thoth was manifest in themoon, but also in the baboon and in the ibis, and we do not know whether anyrelations were thought to exist between these different symbols, and if so. whatthey were. The relation between the Mnevis bull and the sun-god Re. and betweenthe Apis bull and the earth-god Ptah. was different again. Ptah was neverdepicted as a bull or believed to be incarnate in a bull: but the Apis bull wascalled \"The living Apis, the herald of Ptah. who carries the truth upwards tohim of the lovely face Ptah .\" The Mnevis bull bore a similar title inconnection with Re. We have to deal here, moreover, not with a speciesconsidered sacred, but with one individual identified by certain marks, not asthe incarnation, but as the divine servant of the god. Other deities wereregularly imagined in animal shapes but even in their case the incarnation didnot limit—it did not even define—their powers. Anubis. for instance, was mostcommonly shown as areclining jackal but he was by no means a deified animal. Already in theearliest texts in which he is mentioned, he appears as the god of the desertcemeteries. He ensured proper burial and when mummification became common hecounted as the master of embalmment. The god was depicted in papyri and reliefswith a human body and a jackal's head.Such hybrid forms are common in Egyptian art and the usual evolutionary theoryexplains them as \"transitional forms,\" intermediate between the \"crude\" cult ofanimals and the anthropomorphic gods of a more enlightened age. This theoryignores the fact that the earliest divine statues which have been preservedrepresent the god Min in human shape. Conversely, we find to the very end ofEgypt's independence that gods were believed to be manifest in animals. Thegoddess Hathor appears, for instance, in late papyri and even in royal statuesas a cow. Yet she was rendered already in the First Dynasty, on the Palette ofNarmer, with a human face, cow's horns, and cow's ears. This early appearance ofhuman features was to be expected, for a god is personified power, andpersonification need not, but easily may, call up the human image. In any case,the gods were not confined to a single mode of manifestation. We have seen thatThoth appeared as moon, baboon, and ibis. He was also depicted as an ibis-headedman. To speak here of a transitional form seems pointless. There was no need fora transition. The god appeared as he desired, in one of his knownmanifestations. On the other hand, there was a definite need to distinguishdeities when they were depicted in human shape, and in such an array theibis-headed figure identified Thoth. I suspect that the Egyptians did not intendtheir hybrid designs as renderings of an imagined reality at all and that weshould not take the animal-headed gods at their face value. These designs wereprobably picto-grams, not portraits. Hathor, usually depicted as a cow, awoman's face with cow's ears, or as a woman wearing a crown of cow's horns,appears very rarely as a cow-headed woman; the meaning would be: This is thegoddess who is manifest in the cow. The animal-headed figures are quiteunorganic and mechanical; it makes no difference whether a quadruped's head, anibis' neck, or a snake's forepart emerge from the human shoulder. That againwould be easily explained if they were only ideograms, and this interpretationis corroborated by the truly vital character of the few monsters invented by theEgyptians: Taurt, for instance, is convincing even though she is composed ofincongruous parts: the head of a hippopotamus, the back and tail of a crocodile,the breasts of a woman, and the claws of a lion.Our rapid survey of the various relationships between gods and animals in Egyptdoes not clarify the role of the latter. But the very absence of a general ruleand the variety of the creatures involved suggests, it seems to me, that what inthese relationships became articulate was an underlying religious awe feltbefore all animal life; in other words, it would seem that animals as suchpossessed religious significance for the Egyptians. Their attitude might wellhave arisen from a religious interpretation of the animals' otherness. Arecognition of otherness is implied in all specifically religious feeling, asOtto has shown. We assume, then, that the Egyptian interpreted the nonhuman assuperhuman, in particular when he saw it in animals—in their inarticulatewisdom, their cer-tainty, their unhesitating achievement, and above all in their static reality.With animals the continual succession of generations brought no change; and thisis not an abstract and far-fetched argument but something which suggested itselfalso to Keats for instance; in the \"Ode to a Nightingale\" he writes:Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird! No hungry generations tread theedown; The voice I hear this passing night was heard In ancient days by emperorand clown . . .The animals never change, and in this respect especially they would appear toshare—in a degree unknown to man—the fundamental nature of creation. We shallsee in the following chapters that the Egyptians viewed their living universe asa rhythmic movement contained within an unchanging whole. Even their socialorder reflected this view; in fact, it determined their outlook to such anextent that it can only be understood as an intuitive—and thereforebinding—interpretation of the world order. Now humanity would not appear toexist in this manner; in human beings individual characteristics outbalancegeneric resemblances. But the animals exist in their unchanging species,following their predestined modes of life, irrespective of the replacement ofindividuals. Thus animal life would appear superhuman to the Egyptian in that itshared directly, patently, in the static life of the universe. For that reasonrecognition of the animals' otherness would be, for the Egyptian, recognition ofthe divine.This interpretation of the animal cults of Egypt requires qualification in tworespects; it depends, of course, on the strength which the vision of anunchanging universe can be proved to have possessed in Egypt, and it requirestherefore the cumulative evidence of the subsequent chapters. And, furthermore,even if it is true that animals in general were capable of inspiring allEgyptians with a feeling of religious awe, that feeling assumed definite anddifferent forms in each of the ensuing cults. Their variety is reflected in therelationships which were claimed to exist between gods and animals, whetherindividuals or whole species.The Gods of the EgyptiansE. A. WALLIS BUDGEE. A. Walks Budge, one of the foremost Egyptologists of this century, was Keeperof the Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the British Museum and author of anextensive study of the religious and mythological texts of Ancient Egypt. Inthis selection, he explains the relationship of the gods to nature and discussesthe elements of magic that were prevalent in ancient Egyptian ritual.THE GODS OF EGYPT1 he Greek historian Herodotus affirms that the Egyptians were \"beyond measurescrupulous in all matters appertaining to religion,\" and he made this statementafter personal observation of the care which they displayed in the performanceof religious ceremonies, the aim and object of which was to do honour to thegods, and of the obedience which they showed to the behests of the priests whotransmitted to them commands which they declared to be, and which were acceptedas, authentic revelations of the will of the gods. From the manner in which thiswriter speaks it is clear that he had no doubt about what he was saying, andthat he was recording a conviction which had become settled in his mind. He wasfully conscious that the Egyptians worshipped a large number of animals, andbirds, and reptiles, with a seriousness and earnestness which must have filledthe cultured Greek with astonishment, yet he was not moved to give expression towords of scorn as was Juvenal, * for Herodotus perceived that beneath the actsof apparently foolish and infatuated worship there existed a sincerity whichbetokend a firm and implicit belief which merited the respect of thinking men.It would be wrong to imagine that the Egyptians were the only people ofantiquity who were scrupulous beyond measure in religious matters, for we knowthat the Babylonians, both Sumerian and Semitic, were devoted worshippers oftheir gods, and that they possessed a very old and complicated system ofreligion; but there is good reason for thinking that the Egyptians were morescrupulous than their neighbours in religious matters, and that they always borethe character of being an extremely religious nation. The evidence of themonuments of the Egyptians proves that from the earliest to the latest period oftheir history the observance of religious festivals and the performance ofreligious duties in connexion with the worship of the gods absorbed a very largepart of the time and energies of the nation, and if we take into considerationthe funeral ceremonies and services commemorative of the dead which wereperformed by them at the tombs, a casual visitor to Egypt who did not know howto look below the surface might be pardoned for declaring that the Egyptianswere a nation of men who were wholly given up to the worship of beasts and thecult of the dead.138The Egyptians, however, acted in a perfectly logical manner, for they believedthat they were a divine nation, and that they were ruled by kings who werethemselves gods incarnate; their earliest kings, they asserted, were actuallygods, who did not disdain to live upon earth, and to go about and up and downthrough it, and to mingle with men. Other ancient nations were content tobelieve that they had been brought into being by the power of their godsoperating upon matter, but the Egyptians believed that they were the issue ofthe great God who created the universe, and that they were of directly divineorigin. When the gods ceased to reign in their proper persons upon earth, theywere succeeded by a series of demi-gods, who were in turn succeeded by theManes, and these were duly followed by kings in whom was enshrined a divinenature with characteristic attributes. When the physical or natural body of aking died, the divine portion of his being, i.e., the spiritual body, returnedto its original abode with the gods, and it was duly worshipped by men uponearth as a god and with the gods. This happy result was partly brought about bythe performance of certain ceremonies, which were at first wholly magical, butlater partly magical and partly religious, and by the recital of appropriatewords uttered in the duly prescribed tone and manner, and by the keeping offestivals at the tombs at stated seasons when the appointed offerings were made,and the prayers for the welfare of the dead were said. From the earliest timesthe worship of the gods went hand in hand with the deification of dead kings andother royal personages, and the worship of departed monarchs from some aspectsmay be regarded as meritorious as the worship of the gods. From one point ofview Egypt was as much a land of gods as of men, and the inhabitants of thecountry wherein the gods lived and moved naturally devoted a considerableportion of their time upon earth to the worship of divine beings and of theirancestors who had departed to the land of the gods. In the matter of religion,and all that appertains thereto, the Egyptians were a \"peculiar people,\" and inall ages they have exhibited a tenacity of belief and a conservatism whichdistinguish them from all the other great nations of antiquity.But the Egyptians were not only renowned for their devotion to religiousobservances, they were famous as much for the variety as for the number of theirgods. Animals, birds, fishes, and reptiles were worshipped by them in all ages,but in addition to these they adored the great powers of nature as well as alarge number of beings with which they peopled the heavens, the air, the earth,the sky, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the water. In the earliest times thepredy-nastic Egyptians, in common with every half-savage people, believed thatall the various operations of nature were the result of the actions of beingswhich were for the most part unfriendly to man. The inundation which rose toohigh and flooded the primitive village, and drowned their cattle, and destroyedtheir stock of grain, was regarded as the result of the working of an unfriendlyand unseen power; and when the river rose just high enough to irrigate the landwhich had been prepared, they either thought that a friendly power, which wasstronger than that which caused the destroying flood, had kept the hostile powerin check, or that the spirit of the river was on that occasion pleased withthem.140 E. A. Wallis BudgeThey believed in the existence of spirits of the air, and in spirits ofmountain, and stream, and tree, and all these had to be propitiated with gifts,or cajoled and wheedled into bestowing their favour and protection upon theirsuppliants.It is very unfortunate that the animals, and the spirits of natural objects, aswell as the powers of nature, were all grouped together by the Egyptians andwere described by the word neteru; which, with considerable inexactness, we areobliged to translate by \"gods.\" There is no doubt that at a very early period intheir predynastic history the Egyptians distinguished between great gods andlittle gods, just as they did between friendly gods and hostile gods, but eithertheir poverty of expression, or the inflexibility of their language, preventedthem from making a distinction apparent in writing, and thus it happens that indynastic times, when a lofty conception of monotheism prevailed among thepriesthood, the scribe found himself obliged to call both God and the lowest ofthe beings that were supposed to possess some attribute of divinity by one andthe same name, i.e., Neter. Other nations of antiquity found a way out of thedifficulty of grouping all classes of divine beings by one name by inventingseries of orders of angels, to each of which they gave names and assignedvarious duties in connexion with the service of the Deity. Thus in the Kur'an itis said that God maketh the angels His messengers and that they are furnishedwith two or three, or four pairs of wings, according to their rank andimportance; the archangel Gabriel is said to have been seen by Muhammad theProphet with six hundred pairs of wings! The duties of the angels, according tothe Muhammadans, were of various kinds. Thus nineteen angels are appointed totake charge of hell fire; eight are set apart to support God's throne on the Dayof Judgment; several tear the souls of the wicked from their bodies withviolence, and several take the souls of the righteous from their bodies withgentleness and kindness; two angels are ordered to accompany every man on earth,the one to write down his good actions and the other his evil deeds, and thesewill appear with him at the Day of Judgment, the one to lead him before theJudge, and the other to bear witness either for or against him. Muhammadantheologians declare that the angels are created of a simple substance of light,and that they are endowed with life, and speech, and reason; they are incapableof sin, they have no carnal desire, they do not propagate their species, andthey are not moved by the passions of wrath and anger; their obedience isabsolute. Their meat is the celebrating of the glory of God, their drink is theproclaiming of His holiness, their conversation is the commemorating of God, andtheir pleasure is His worship. Curiously enough, some are said to have the formof animals. Four of the angels are Archangels, viz. Michael, Gabriel, Azrael,and Israfel, and they possess special powers, and special duties are assigned tothem. These four are superior to all the human race, with the exception of theProphets and Apostles, but the angelic nature is held to be inferior to humannature because all the angels were commanded to worship Adam. The above and manyother characteristics might be cited in proof that the angels of the Muhammadanspossess much in common with the inferior gods of the Egyptians, and though manyof the conceptions of the Arabs on this point were undoubtedly borrowed from theHebrews and their writings, a great many must have descended to them from theirown early ancestors.AClosely connected with these Muhammadan theories, though much older, is thesystem of angels which was invented by the Syrians. In this we find the angelsdivided into nine classes and three orders, upper, middle, and lower. The upperorder is composed of Cherubim, Seraphim, and Thrones; the middle order of Lords,Powers, and Rulers; and the lower order of Principalities, Archangels, andAngels. The middle order receives revelations from those above them, and thelower order are the ministers who wait upon created things. The highest andforemost among the angels is Gabriel, who is the mediator between God and Hiscreation. The Archangels in this system are described as a \"swift operativemotion,\" which has dominion over every living thing except man; and the Angelsare a motion which has spiritual knowledge of everything that is on earth and inheaven. The Syrians, like the Muhammadans, borrowed largely from the writings ofthe Hebrews, in whose theological system angels played a very prominent part. Inthe Syrian system also the angels possess much in common with the inferior godsof the Egyptians."},{"pageContent":"The inferior gods of the Egyptians were supposed to suffer from many of thedefects of mortal beings, and they were even thought to grow old and to die, andthe same ideas about the angels were held by Muhammadans and Hebrews. Accordingto the former, the angels will perish when heaven, their abode, is made to passaway at the Day of Judgment. According to the latter, one of the two greatclasses of angels, i.e., those which were created on the fifth day of creation,is mortal; on the other hand, the angels which were created on the second day ofcreation endure for ever, and these may be fitly compared with the unfailing andunvarying powers of nature which were personified and worshipped by theEgyptians; of the angels which perish, some spring from fire, some from water,and some from wind. The angels are grouped into ten classes, i.e., the Erelim,the Ishim, the Bene Elohim, the Malachim, the Hashmalim, the Tarshishim, theShishanim, the Cherubim, the Ophannim, and the Seraphim; among these weredivided all the duties connected with the ordering of the heavens and the earth,and they, according to their position and importance, became the interpreters ofthe Will of the Deity. A comparison of the passages in Rabbinic literature whichdescribe these and similar matters connected with the angels, spirits, etc., ofancient Hebrew mythology with Egyptian texts shows that both the Egyptians andJews possessed many ideas in common, and all the evidence goes to prove that thelatter borrowed from the former in the earliest period.In comparatively late historical times the Egyptians introduced into theircompany of gods a few deities from Western Asia, but these had no effect inmodifying the general character either of their religion or of their worship.The subject of comparative Egyptian and Semitic mythology is one which has yetto be worked thoroughly, not because it would supply us with the original formsof Egyptian myths and legends, but because it would show what modifications suchthings underwent when adopted by Semitic peoples, or at least by peoples who hadSemitic blood in their veins. Some would compare Egyptian and Semiticmythologies on the ground that the Egyptians and Semites were kinsfolk, but itmust be quite clearly understood that this is pure assumption, and is only based142 E. A. Wallis Budgeon the statements of those who declare that the Egyptian and Semitic languagesare akin. Others again have sought to explain the mythology of the Egyptians byappeals to Aryan mythology, and to illustrate the meanings of important Egyptianwords in religious texts by means of Aryan etymologies, but the results arewholly unsatisfactory, and they only serve to show the futility of comparing themythologies of two peoples of different race occupying quite different grades inthe ladder of civilization. It cannot be too strongly insisted on that all theoldest gods of Egypt are of Egyptian origin, and that the fundamental religiousbeliefs of the Egyptians also are of Egyptian origin, and that both the gods andthe beliefs date from predynastic times, and have nothing whatever to do withthe Semites or Aryans of history.Of the origin of the Egyptian of the Palaeolithic and early Neolithic Periods,we, of course, know nothing, but it is tolerably certain that the Egyptian ofthe latter part of the Neolithic Period was indigenous to North-East Africa, andthat a very large number of the great gods worshipped by the dynastic Egyptianwere worshipped also by his predecessor in predynastic times. The conquerors ofthe Egyptians of the Neolithic Period who, with good reason, have been assumedto come from the East and to have been more or less akin to the Proto-Semites,no doubt brought about certain modifications in the worship of those whom theyhad vanquished, but they could not have succeeded in abolishing the various godsin animal and other forms which were worshipped throughout the length andbreadth of the country, for these continued to be venerated until the time ofthe Ptolemies.We have at present no means of knowing how far the religious beliefs of theconquerors influenced the conquered peoples of Egypt, but viewed in the light ofwell-ascertained facts it seems tolerably certain that no great change tookplace in the views which the indigenous peoples held concerning their gods asthe result of the invasion of foreigners, and that if any foreign gods wereintroduced into the company of indigenous, predynastic gods, they were eitherquickly assimilated to or wholly absorbed by them. Speaking generally, the godsof the Egyptians remained unchanged throughout all the various periods of thehistory of Egypt, and the minds of the people seem always to have had a tendencytowards the maintenance of old forms of worship, and to the preservation of theancient texts in which such forms were prescribed and old beliefs wereenshrined. The Egyptians never forgot the ancient gods of the country, and it istypical of the spirit of conservatism which they displayed in most things thateven in the Roman Period pious folk among them were buried with the same prayersand with the same ceremonies that had been employed at the burial of Egyptiansnearly five thousand years before. The Egyptian of the Roman Period, like theEgyptian cf the Early Empire, was content to think that his body would bereceived in the tomb by the jackal-headed Anubis; that the organs of hiscorruptible body would be presided over and guarded by animal-headed gods; thatthe reading of the pointer of the Great Scales, wherein his heart was weighed,would be made known by an ape to the ibis-headed scribe of the gods, whom weknow by the name of Thoth; and that the beatified dead would be introduced tothe god Osiris by a hawk-headed god called Horus, son of Isis, who in manyrespects was the counterpart of the god Heru-ur, the oldest of all the gods ofEgypt,whose type and symbol was the hawk. From first to last the indigenous Egyptianpaid little heed to the events which happened outside his own country, andneither conquest nor invasion by foreign nations had any effect upon hispersonal belief. He continued to cultivate his land diligently, he worshippedthe gods of his ancestors blindly, like them he spared no pains in makingpreparations for the preservation of his mummified body, and the heaven which hehoped to attain was fashioned according to old ideas of a fertile homestead,well stocked with cattle, where he would enjoy the company of his parents, andbe able to worship the local gods whom he had adored upon earth. The priestlyand upper classes certainly held views on these subjects which differed fromthose of the husbandman, but it is a significant fact that it was not thereligion and mythology of the dynastic Egyptian, but that of the indigenous,predynastic Egyptian, with his animal gods and fantastic and half-savagebeliefs, which strongly coloured the religion of the country in all periods ofher history, and gave to her the characteristics which were regarded withastonishment and wonder by all the peoples who came in contact with theEgyptians.The predynastic Egyptians in the earliest stages of their existence, like mostsavage and semi-savage peoples, believed that the sea, the earth, the air, andthe sky were filled to overflowing with spirits, some of whom were engaged incarrying on the works of nature, and others in aiding or obstructing man in thecourse of his existence upon earth. Whatsoever happened in nature was attributedby them to the operations of a large number of spiritual beings, the life ofwhom was identical with the life of the great natural elements, and theexistence of whom terminated with the destruction of the objects which they weresupposed to animate. Such spirits, although invisible to mental eyes, were veryreal creatures in their minds, and to them they attributed all the passionswhich belong to man, and all his faculties and powers also. Everything in naturewas inhabited by a spirit, and it was thought possible to endow arepresentation, or model, or figure of any object with a spirit or soul,provided a name was given to it; this spirit or soul lived in the drawing orfigure until the object which it animated was broken or destroyed. The objects,both natural and artificial, which we consider to be inanimate were regarded bythe predynastic Egyptians as animate, and in many respects they were thought toresemble man himself. The spirits who infested every part of the visible worldwere countless in forms, and they differed from each other in respect of power;the spirit that caused the Inundation of the Nile was greater than the one thatlived in a canal, the spirit that made the sun to shine was more powerful thanthe one that governed the moon, and the spirit of a great tree was mightier thanthe one that animated an ear of corn or a blade of grass. The difference betweenthe supposed powers of such spirits must have been distinguished at a very earlyperiod, and the half-savage inhabitants of Egypt must at the same time have madea sharp distinction between those whose operations were beneficial to them, andthose whose actions brought upon them injury, loss, or death. It is easy to seehow they might imagine that certain great natural objects were under thedominion of spirits who were capable of feeling wrath, or displeasure, and ofmaking it manifest to man. Thus the spirit of the Nile would be regarded asbeneficent and friendly when the waters of the river rose sufficiently duringthe period of the Inundation to ensure an abundant crop144 E. A. Wallis Budgethroughout the land; but when their rise was excessive, and they drowned thecattle and washed away the houses of the people, whether made of wattles or mud,or when they rose insufficiently and caused want and famine, the spirit of theNile would be considered unfriendly and evil to man. An ample and sufficientInundation was regarded as a sign that the spirit of the Nile was not displeasedwith man, but a destructive flood was a sure token of displeasure. The samefeeling exists to this day in Egypt among the peasant-farmers, for severalnatives told me in 1899, the year of the lowest rise of the Nile of thenineteenth century, 2 that \"Allah was angry with them, and would not let thewater come\"; and one man added that in all his life he had never before knownAllah to be so angry with them.The spirits which were always hostile or unfriendly towards man, and wereregarded by the Egyptians as evil spirits, were identified with certain animalsand reptiles, and traditions of some of these seem to have been preserved untilthe latest period of dynastic history. Apep, the serpent-devil of mist,darkness, storm, and night, of whom more will be said later on, and his fiends,the \"children of rebellion,\" were not the result of the imagination of theEgyptians in historic times, but their existence dates from the period whenEgypt was overrun by mightly beasts, huge serpents, and noxious reptiles of allkinds. The great serpent of Egyptian mythology, which was indeed a formidableopponent of the Sun-god, had its prototype in some monster serpent on earth, ofwhich tradition had preserved a record; and that this is no mere theory isproved by the fact that the remains of a serpent, which must have been ofenormous size, have recently been found in the Fayyum. The vertebrae are said toindicate that the creature to which they belonged was longer than the largestpython known. 3 The allies of the great serpent-devil Apep were as hostile toman as was their master to the Sun-god, and they were regarded with terror bythe minds of those who had evolved them. On the other hand, there were numbersof spirits whose actions were friendly and beneficial to man, and some of thesewere supposed to do battle on his behalf against the evil spirits.Thus at a very early period the predynastic Egyptian must have conceived theexistence of a great company of spirits whose goodwill, or at all events whoseinaction, could only be obtained by bribes, i.e., offerings, and cajolery andflattery; and of a second large company whose beneficent deeds to man he waswont to acknowledge and whose powerful help he was anxious to draw towardshimself; and of a third company who were supposed to be occupied solely withmaking the sun, moon, and stars to shine, and the rivers and streams to flow,and the clouds to form and the rain to fall, and who, in fact, were alwaysengaged in carrying out diligently the workings and evolutions of all naturalthings, both small and great. The spirits to whom in predynastic times theEgyptians ascribed a nature malicious or unfriendly towards man, and who wereregarded much as modern nations have regarded goblins, hobgoblins, gnomes,trolls, elves, etc., developed in dynastic times into a corporate society, withaims, and intentions, and acts wholly evil, and with a government which wasdevised by the greatest and most evil of their number. To these, in process oftime, were joined the spirits of evil men and women, and the prototype of hellwas formed by assumingthe existence of a place where evil spirits and their still more evil chiefslived together. By the same process of imagination beneficent and friendlyspirits were grouped together in one abode under the direction of rulers whowere well disposed towards man, and this idea became the nucleus of the laterconception of the heaven to which the souls of good men and women were supposedby the Egyptian to depart, after he had developed sufficiently to conceive thedoctrine of immortality. The chiefs of the company of evil spirits subsequentlybecame the powerful devils of historic times, and the rulers of the company ofbeneficent and good spirits became the gods; the spirits of the third company,i.e., the spirits of the powers of Nature, became the great cosmic gods of thedynastic Egyptians. The cult of this last class of spirits, or gods, differed inmany ways from that of the spirits or gods who were supposed to be concernedentirely with the welfare of man, and in dynastic times there are abundantproofs of this in religious texts and compositions. In the hymns to the Sun-god,under whatsoever name he is worshipped, we find that the greatest wonder isexpressed at his majesty and glory, and that he is apostrophised in terms whichshow forth the awe and fear of his devout adorer. His triumphant passage acrossthe sky is described, the unfailing regularity of his rising and setting ismentioned, reference is made to the vast distance over which he passes in amoment of time, glory is duly ascribed to him for the great works which heperforms in nature, and full recognition is given to him as the creator of menand animals, of birds and fish, of trees and plants, of reptiles, and of allcreated things; the praise of the god is full and sufficient, yet it is alwaysthat of a finite being who appears to be overwhelmed at the thought of the powerand might of an apparently infinite being. The petitions lack the personalappeal which we find in the Egyptian's prayers to the man-god Osiris, and showthat he regarded the two gods from entirely different points of view. It isimpossible to say how early this distinction between the functions of the twogods was made, but it is certain that it is coeval with the beginnings ofdynastic history, and that it was observed until very late times.The element of magic, which is the oldest and most persistent characteristic ofthe worship of the gods and of the Egyptian religion, generally belongs to theperiod before this distinction was arrived at, and it is clear that it datesfrom the time when man thought that the good and evil spirits were beings whowere not greatly different from himself, and who could be propitiated withgifts, and controlled by means of words of power and by the performance ofceremonies, and moved to action by hymns and addresses. This belief was presentin the minds of the Egyptians in all ages of their history, and it exists in amodified form among the Muhammadan Egyptians and Sudani men to this day. It istrue that they proclaim vehemently that there is no god but God, and thatMuhammad is His Prophet, and that God's power is infinite and absolute, but theytake care to guard the persons of themselves and their children from the EvilEye and from the assaults of malicious and evil spirits, by means of amulets ofall kinds as zealously now as their ancestors did in the days before theexistence of God Who is One was conceived. The caravan men protect their camelsfrom the Evil Eye of the spirits of the desert by fastening bright-colouredbeads between the eyes of their beasts, and by means of long fringes which hangfrom their mahlufas, or146 E. A. Wallis Budgesaddles, and in spite of their firm belief in the infinite power of God, theyselect an auspicious day on which to set out on a journey, and they neverattempt to pass certain isolated caves, or ravines, or mountains, in the nighttime. All the members of the great family of the Jinn are to them as real to-dayas their equivalents were to the ancient Egyptians, and, from the descriptionsof desert spirits which are given by those who have been fortunate enough to seethem, it is clear that traditions of the form and appearance of ancient Egyptianfiends and evil spirits have been unconsciously preserved until the present day.The modern Egyptians call them by Arabic names, but the descriptions of themagree well with those which might be made of certain genii that appear inancient Egyptian mythological works treating of the Underworld and itsinhabitants.NOTESiThat the crocodile, ibis, dog-headed ape, and fish of various kinds werevenerated in Egypt is true enough; they were not, however, venerated in dynastictimes as animals, but as the abodes of gods. In certain localities peculiarsanctity was attributed to the leek and onion, as Juvenal suggests, but neithervegetable was an object of worship in the country generally; and there is nomonumental evidence to show that the eating of human flesh was practised, for itis now known that even the predynastic Egyptians did not eat the flesh of thedead and gnaw their bones, as was once rashly asserted. Juvenal's statements areonly partly true, and some of them are on a par with that of a learned Indianwho visited England, and wrote a book on this country after his return toBombay. Speaking of the religion of the English he declared that they were allidolators, and to prove this assertion he gave a list of churches in which hehad seen a figure of a lamb in the sculpture work over and about the altar, andin prominent places elsewhere in the churches. The Indian, like Juvenal, andCicero also, seems not to have understood that many nations have regardedanimals as symbols of gods and divine powers, and still do so.2 In October, 1899, the level of the water of Lake Victoria was 2 ft. below thenormal, and in December the level at Aswan was 5 ft. 8 ins. below the average ofprevious years.3 \"If the proportions of this snake were the same as in the existing Pythonseboe it probably reached a length of thirty feet.\" C. W. Andrews.The Osirianization of the HereafterJAMES HENRY BREASTEDJames Henry Breasted (1865-1935), considered the foremost influence inintroducing Americans to the culture of ancient Egypt, was founder in 1919 ofthe Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago. In this selection, Breasteddiscusses the rituals that are described in the Pyramid Texts, the purpose ofwhich was to help the deceased enter the world beyond. Breasted's work enablesthe reader to become aware of the way in which the Osiris myth transformed theHorus myth and became syncretized with it.Xrobably nothing in the life of the ancient Nile-dwellers commends them moreappealingly to our sympathetic consideration than the fact that when the Osirianfaith had once developed, it so readily caught the popular imagination as tospread rapidly among all classes. It thus came into active competition with theSolar faith of the court and state priesthoods. This was especially true of itsdoctrines of the after life, in the progress of which we can discern the gradualOsirianization of Egyptian religion, and especially of the Solar teachingregarding the hereafter.There is nothing in the Osiris myth, nor in the character or later history ofOsiris, to suggest a celestial hereafter. Indeed clear and unequivocal survivalsfrom a period when he was hostile to the celestial and Solar dead are stilldiscoverable in the Pyramid Texts. We recall the exorcisms intended to restrainOsiris and his kin from entering the pyramid, a Solar tomb, with evil intent.Again we find the dead king as a star in the sky, thus addressed: \"Thou lookestdown upon Osiris commanding the Glorious ( = the dead). There thou standest,being far from him, (for) thou art not of them (the dead), thou belongest notamong them.\" Likewise it is said of the Sun-god: \"He has freed king Teti fromKherti, he has not given him to Osiris.\" It is perhaps due to an effort toovercome this difficulty that Horus, the son of Osiris, is represented as one\"who puts not this Pepi over the dead, he puts him among the gods, he beingdivine.\" The prehistoric Osiris faith, probably local to the Delta, thusinvolved a forbidding hereafter which was dreaded and at the same time wasopposed to celestial blessedness beyond. To be sure, the Heliopolitan group ofgods, the Divine Ennead of that city, makes Osiris a child of Nut, theSky-goddess. But his father was the Earth-god Geb, a very natural result of thecharacter of Osiris as a Nile-god and a spirit of vegetable life, both of whichin Egyptian belief came out of the earth. Moreover, the celestial destinythrough Nut the Sky-goddess is not necessarily Osirian. It is found, along withthe frequent and non-Osirian or even pre-Osirian co-ordination of Horus and Set,associated in the service of the dead. The appearance of these two togetherassisting the dead cannot be Osirian. To be protected and assisted by Nut,therefore, does not necessarily imply that she is doing this for the dead king,because he is identified with Osiris, her son. It is thus probable that as aSky-goddess intimately associated with Re, Nut's functions in the celestial lifehereafter were originally Solar and at first not connected with the Osirianfaith.When Osiris migrated up the Nile from the Delta, we recall how he was identifiedwith one of the old mortuary gods of the South, the \"First of the Westerners\"(Khenti-Amentiu), and his kingdom was conceived as situated in the West, orbelow the western horizon, where it merged into the Nether World. He became kingof a realm of the dead below the earth, and hence his frequent title, \"Lord ofDewat,\" the \"Nether World,\" which occurs even in the Pyramid Texts. It is aslord of a subterranean kingdom of the dead that Osiris later appears. 1As there was nothing then in the myth of the offices of Osiris to carry him tothe sky, so the simplest of the Osirian Utterances in the Pyramid Texts do notcarry him thither. There are as many varying pictures of the Osirian destiny asin the Solar theology. We find the dead king as a mere messenger of Osirisannouncing the prosperous issue and plentiful yield of the year, the harvestyear, which is associated with Osiris. That group of incidents in the myth whichproves to be especially available in the future career of the dead king is hisrelations with Horus, the son of Osiris, and the filial piety displayed by theson toward his father. We may find the dead king identified with Horus andmarching forth in triumph from Buto, with his mother, Isis, before him andNephthys behind him, while Upwawet opened the way for them. More often, however,the dead king does all that Osiris did, receiving heart and limbs as did Osiris,or becoming Osiris himself. This was the favorite belief of the Osiris faith.The king became Osiris and rose from the dead as Osiris did. This identity beganat birth and is described in the Pyramid Texts with all the wonders andprodigies of a divine birth.The waters of life that are in the sky come;The waters of life that are in the earth come.The sky burns for thee,The earth trembles for thee,Before the divine birth.The two mountains divide,The god becomes,The god takes possession of his body.The two mountains divide,This king Neferkere becomes,This king Neferkere takes possession of his body.Osiris as Nile is thus born between the two mountains of the eastern and westernNile shores, and in the same way, and as the same being, the king is born. Hencewe find the king appearing elsewhere as the inundation. It is not the mereassumption of the form of Osiris, but complete identity with him, which is setforth in this doctrine of the Pyramid Texts. \"As he (Osiris) lives, this kingUnis lives; as he dies not, this king Unis dies not; as he perishes not, thisking Unis perishes not.\" These asseverations are repeated over and over, andaddressed to every god in the Ennead, that each may be called upon to witnesstheir truth. Osiris himself under various names is adjured, \"Thy body is thebody of this king Unis, thy flesh is the flesh of this king Unis, thy bones arethe bones of this king Unis.\" Thus the dead king receives the throne of Osiris,and becomes, like him, king of-i *the dead. \"Ho! king Neferkere (Pepi II)! How beautiful is this! How beautiful isthis, which thy father Osiris has done for thee! He has given thee his throne,thou rulest those of the hidden places (the dead), thou leadest their augustones, all the glorious ones follow thee.\" 2The supreme boon which this identity of the king with Osiris assured the deadPharaoh was the good offices of Horus, the personification of filial piety. Allthe pious attentions w T hich Osiris had once enjoyed at the hands of his sonHorus now likewise become the king's portion. The litigation which the mythrecounts at Heliopolis is successfully met by the aid of Horus, as well asThoth, and, like Osiris, the dead king receives the predicate \"righteous ofvoice,\" or \"justified,\" an epithet which was later construed as meaning\"triumphant.\" Over and over again the resurrection of Osiris by Horus, and therestoration of his body, are likewise affirmed to be the king's privilege.\"Horus collects for thee thy limbs that he may put thee together without anylack in thee.\" Horus then champions his cause, as he had done that of hisfather, till the dead king gains the supreme place as sovereign of all. \"OOsiris king Teti, arise! Horus comes that he may reclaim thee from the gods.Horus loves thee, he has equipped thee with his eye. . . . Horus has opened forthee thy eye that thou mayest see with it. . . . The gods . . . they love thee.Isis and Nephthys have healed thee. Horus is not far from thee; thou art his ka.Thy face is gracious unto him. . . . Thou hast received the word of Horus, thouart satisfied therewith. Hearken unto Horus, he has caused the gods to servethee. . . . Horus has found thee that there is profit for him in thee. Horussends up to thee the gods; he has given them to thee that they may illuminatethy face. Horus has placed thee at the head of the gods. He has caused thee totake every crown. . . . Horus has seized for thee the gods. They escape not fromthee, from the place where thou hast gone. Horus counts for thee the gods. Theyretreat not from thee, from the place which thou hast seized. . . . Horusavenged thee; it was not long till he avenged thee. Ho, Osirisking Teti! thouart a mighty god, there is no god like thee. Horus has given to thee hischildren that they might carry thee. He has given to thee all gods that they mayserve thee, and thou have power over them.\" A long series of Utterances in thePyramid Texts sets forth this championship of the dead king as Osiris by his sonHorus. In all this there is little or no trace of the celestial destiny, or anyindication of the place where the action occurs. Such incidents and suchUtterances are appropriated from the Osirian theology and myth, with little orno change. But the Osirian doctrine of the hereafter, absorbed into these royalmortuary texts by the priesthood of Heliopolis, could not, in spite of itsvigorous popularity, resist the prestige of the state (or Solar) theology. Evenin the Osirian Utterances on the good offices of Horus just mentioned we twicefind the dead king, although he is assumed to be Osiris, thus addressed: \"Thouart a Glorious One (Y'hwty) in thy name of'Horizon (Y'ht) from which Re comesforth.'\" The Osirian hereafter was thus celestialized, as had been the Osiriantheology when it was correlated with that of Heliopolis. We find the Sky-goddessNut extending to the Osirian dead her protection and the privilege of enteringher realm. Nut \"takes him to the sky, she does not cast him down to the earth.\"The ancient hymn in praise of the Sky-goddess embedded in the Pyramid Texts hasreceived an introduction, in which the king as Osiris is commended to herprotection, and the hymn is broken up by petitions inserted at intervals cravinga celestial destiny for the dead king, although this archaic hymn had originallyno demonstrable connection with Osiris, and was, as far as any indication itcontains is concerned, written before the priestly theology had made Osiris theson of the Sky-goddess. Similarly Anubis, the ancient mortuary god of Siut,\"counts Osiris away from the gods belonging to the earth, to the gods dwellingin the sky;\" and we find in the Pyramid Texts the anomalous ascent of Osiris tothe sky: \"The sky thunders (lit. speaks), earth trembles, for fear of thee,Osiris, when thou makest ascent. Ho, mother cows yonder! Ho, suckling mothers(cows) yonder! Go ye behind him, weep for him, hail him, acclaim him, when hemakes ascent and goes to the sky among his brethren, the gods.\" His transitionto the Solar and celestial destiny is effected in one passage by a piece ofpurely mortuary theologizing which represents Re as raising Osiris from thedead. Thus is Osiris celes-tialized until the Pyramid Texts even call him \"lordof the sky,\" and represent him as ruling there. The departed Pharaoh is ferriedover, the doors of the sky are opened for him, he passes all enemies as he goes,and he is announced to Osiris in the sky precisely as in the Solar theology.There he is welcomed by Osiris, and he joins the \"Imperishable Stars, thefollowers of Osiris,\" just as in the Solar faith. In the same way he emerges asa god of primeval origin and elemental powers. \"Thou bearest the sky in thyhand, thou layest down the earth with thy foot.\" Celestials and men acclaim thedead, even \"thy wind is incense, thy north wind is smoke,\" say they.While the Heliopolitan priests thus solarized and celestialized the Osirianmortuary doctrines, although they were essentially terrestrial in origin andcharacter, these Solar theologians were in their turn unable to resist thepowerful influence which the popularity of the Osirian faith brought to bearupon them. The Pyramid Texts were eventually Osirianized, and the steadyprogress of this process, exhibiting the course of the struggle between theSolar faith of the state temples and the popular beliefs of the Osirian religionthus discernible in the Pyramid Texts, is one of the most remarkable survivalsfrom the early world, preserving as it does the earliest example of such aspiritual and intellectual conflict between state and popular religion. Thedying Sun and the dying Osiris are here in competition. With the people thehuman Osiris makes the stronger appeal, and even the wealthy and subsidizedpriesthoods of the Solar religion could not withstand the power of this appeal.What we have opportunity to observe in the Pyramid Texts is specifically thegradual but irresistible intrusion of Osiris into the Solar doctrines of thehereafter and their resulting Osirianization.Even on his coffin, preserved in the pyramid sepulchre, the departed king iscalled \"Osiris, lord of Dewat.\" The Osirian influence is superficially evidentin otherwise purely Solar Utterances of the Pyramid Texts where the Osirianeditor has inserted the epithet \"Osiris\" before the king's name, so that we have\"Osiris king Unis,\" or \"Osiris king Pepi.\" This was at first so mechanicallydone that in the offering ritual it was placed only at the head of eachUtterance. In the earliest of our five versions of the Pyramid Texts, that ofUnis, we find \"Osiris\" inserted before the king's name wherever that name standsat the head of the Utterance, but not where it is found in the body of the text.Evidently the Osirian editor ranhastily and mechanically through the sections, inserting \"Osiris\" at the head ofeach one which began with the king's name, but not taking the trouble to gothrough each section seeking the king's name and to insert \"Osiris\" wherevernecessary in the body of the text also.In this way the whole Offering Ritual was Osirianized in Unis's pyramid, but theeditor ceased this process of mechanical insertion at the end of the ritual. Asimilar method may be observed where the same Utterance happens to be preservedin two different pyramids, one exhibiting the mechanical insertion of \"Osiris\"before the king's name, while the other lacks such editing. This is especiallysignificant where the content of the Utterances is purely Solar.But the Osirianization of the Pyramid Texts involves more than such mechanicalalteration of externals. We find one Utterance in its old Solar form, without asingle reference to Osiris or to Osirian doctrine, side by side with the sameUtterance in expanded form filled with Osirian elements. The traces of theOsirian editor's work are evident throughout, but they are interestinglydemonstrable in a series of five stanzas each addressed to a different god,whose name begins the stanza. The last stanza of the five begins with two gods'names, however, the second being \"Sekhem, son of Osiris,\" although in theapostrophe, which constitutes this fifth stanza, the two gods are addressed bypronouns in the singular number! It is evident that, like the other fourstanzas, the fifth also began with the name of a single god, but that theOsirian editor has inserted the name of an Osirian god as a second name,forgetting to change the pronouns. The insertion is enhanced in significance bythe fact that all five gods in these five stanzas are Solar gods, and the lastone, after which the name of Osiris was inserted, is identified with Re.The process was carried so far that it was sometimes applied to passages totallyat variance with the Osirian doctrine. In the old Solar teaching we notinfrequently find Horus and Set side by side on an equal basis, and bothrepresented as engaged in some beneficent act for the dead. Now whenthe deadking is identified with Osiris, by the insertion of the name \"Osiris\" beforethat of the king, we are confronted by the extraordinary assumption that Setperforms pious mortuary offices for Osiris, although the Osiris myth representsSet as mutilating the body of the dead Osiris and scattering his limbs far andwide. Thus an old purification ceremony in the presence of the gods and noblesof Heliopolis (and hence clearly Solar) represents the dead as cleansed by thespittle of Horus and the spittle of Set. This ceremony had, of course, nothingto do with the Osirian ritual, but when the ritual introducing this ceremony wasOsirianized, we find King Osiris, this Pepi\" inserted before the formula ofpurification, thus assuming that Osiris was purified by his arch-enemy, the foulSet! Similarly, Set may appear alone in old Solar Utterances on familiar andfriendly terms with the dead king, so that the king may be addressed thus: \"Hecalls to thee on the stairway of the sky; thou ascendest to the god; Setfraternizes with thee,\" even though the king has just been raised as Osiris fromthe dead!The ladder leading to the sky was originally an element of the Solar faith. Thatit had nothing to do with Osiris is evident, among other things, from the factthat one version of the ladder episode represents it in charge of Set. TheOsirianization of the ladder episode is clearly traceable in four versions ofit, whichare but variants of the same ancient original. The four represent a period ofnearly a century, at least of some eighty-five years. In the oldest formpreserved to us, in the pyramid of Unis, dating from the middle of thetwenty-seventh century, the Utterance opens with the acclamation of the gods asUnis ascends. \"'How beautiful to see, how satisfying to behold,' say the gods,when this god ascends to the sky, when Unis ascends to the sky. . . .' The godsin the sky and the gods on earth come to him; they make supports for Unis ontheir arm. Thou ascendest, O Unis, to the sky. Ascend upon it in this its nameof'Ladder.' The sky is given to Unis, the earth is given to him by Atum.\" Suchis the essential substance of the Utterance. 3 The ladder here barely emergesand the climber is the Pharaoh himself, though Atum is prominent. A generationlater, in the pyramid of Teti the ladder is more developed and the originalclimber is Atum, the Sun-god; but the Osirian goddesses, Isis and Nephthys, areintroduced. Finally, in the pyramid of Pepi I, at least eighty-five years afterthat of Unis, the opening acclamation of the old gods as they behold the ascentof the Pharaoh is put into the mouths of Isis and Nephthys, and the climber hasbecome Osiris. Thus Osiris has taken possession of the old Solar episode andappropriated the old Solar text. This has taken place in spite of embarrassingcomplications. In harmony with the common coordination of Horus and Set in theservice of the dead, an old Solar doctrine represented them as assisting him atthe ascent of the ladder which Re and Horus set up. But when the ascending kingbecomes Osiris, the editor seems quite unconscious of the incongruity, as Set,the mortal enemy and slayer of Osiris, assists him to reach his celestial abode!NOTESiThe situation of Dewat is a difficult problem. As the Nile flows out of it,according to later texts, especially the Sun-hymns, and the common designationof the universe in the Empire is \"sky, earth, and Dewat,\" it is evident that itwas later understood to be the Nether World. In the Pyramid Texts it isevidently in the sky in a considerable number of passages. It can be understoodin no other way in passages where it is parallel with \"sky,\" like the following:The sky conceived thee together with Orion; Dewat bears thee together withOrion.Or againWho voyages the sky with Orion, Who sails Dewat with Osiros.Similarly \"Dewat seizes thy hand, (leads thee) to the place where Orion (= thesky); and Orion and Sothis in the \"horizon\" are encircled by Dewat. Here Dewatis in the horizon, and likewise we find the dead \"descends among\" the dwellersin Dewat after he has ascended to the sky. It was thus sufficiently accessiblefrom the sky, so that the dead, after he ascended, bathed in the \"lake ofDewat,\" and while in the sky he became a \"glorious one dwelling in Dewat.\" Whenhe has climbed the ladder of Re, Horus and Set take him to Dewat. It is parallelwith 'kr, wheie 'kr is a variant of Geb, the earth, which carries it down toearth again. It might appear here that Dewat was a lower region of the sky, inthe vicinity of the horizon, below which it also extended. It is notable that inthe Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom there appears a \"lower Dewat.\" Thedeceased says: \"My place is in the barque of Re in the middle of lower Dewat.\"Dewat thus merged into the Nether World, with which it was ultimatelyidentified, or, being originally the Nether World, it had its counterpart in thesky.2 There is little distinction between the passages where the dead king receivesthe throne of Osiris, because identified with him and others in which hereceives it as the heir of Osiris. He may take it even from Horus, heir ofOsiris.3 The brief intimation of a mysterious enemy plotting against the life of theking, appended at the end of the Utterance, is perhaps an intrusive Osirianreference; but it does not affect the clearly celestial and Solar character ofthe Utterance. It is omitted in Ut. 480, but appears more fully developed in theOsirianized Utterances 572 and 474, but in none of the Utterances to which it isappended is the name of Osiris mentioned, while the epithet which is employed,\"Ymnw (Hidden one?) of the Wild Bull,\" is usually Solar.Unit VThe Sacred Source: The Perennial Philosophy of the EastA History of Indian PhilosophySURENDRANATH DASGUPTASurendranath Dasgupta is a world renowned modern interpreter of Indianphilosophy to the English-speaking world. His five-volume study of Indianphilosophy is the source for this selection on Samkhya. Samkhya philosophy is,perhaps, the earliest formal philosophical system developed in India, severalcenturies before the Common Era. Because of its analysis of the Soul (Purusha)and Matter (Prakriti), later philosophies took the concepts and terminology ofSamkhya into account in working out fresh interpretations. In order to followthe discussions about any Hindu philosophical system, it is important to knowthe basic concepts of Samkhya.THE SAMKHYA AND THE YOGA DOCTRINE OF SOUL OR PURUSA1 he Samkhya philosophy as we have it now admits two principles, souls andprakrti, the root principle of matter. Souls are many, like the Jaina souls, butthey are without parts and qualities. They do not contract or expand accordingas they occupy a smaller or a larger body, but are always all-pervasive, and arenot contained in the bodies in which they are manifested. But the relationbetween body or rather the mind associated with it and soul is such thatwhatever mental phenomena happen in the mind are interpreted as the experienceof its soul. The souls are many, and had it not been so (the Samkhya argues)with the birth of one all would have been born and with the death of one allwould have died.The exact nature of soul is however very difficult of comprehension, and yet itis exactly this which one must thoroughly grasp in order to understand theSamkhya philosophy. Unlike the Jaina soul possessing anantajnana, anantadarsana,anantasukha, and anantavlryya, the Samkhya soul is described as being devoid ofany and every characteristic; but its nature is absolute pure consciousness(cit). The Samkhya view differs from the Vedanta, firstly in this that it doesnot consider the soul to be of the nature of pure intelligence and bliss(ananda). Bliss with Samkhya is but another name for pleasure and as such itbelongs to prakrti and does not constitute the nature of soul; secondly,according to Vedanta the individual souls (jiva) are but illusory manifestationsof one soul or pure consciousness the Brahman, but according to Samkhya they areall real and many.The most interesting feature of Samkhya as of Vedanta is the analysis ofknowledge. Samkhya holds that our knowledge of things are mere ideationalpictures or images. External things are indeed material, but the sense data andimages of the mind, the coming and going of which is called knowledge, are alsoin some sense matter-stuff, since they are limited in their nature like theexternalthings. The sense-data and images come and go, they are often the prototypes, orphotographs of external things, and as such ought to be considered as in somesense material, but the matter of which these are composed is the subtlest.These images of the mind could not have appeared as conscious, if there were noseparate principles of consciousness in connection with which the wholeconscious plane could be interpreted as the experience of a person. We know thatthe Upanisads consider the soul or atman as pure and infinite consciousness,distinct from the forms of knowledge, the ideas, and the images. In our ordinaryways of mental analysis we do not detect that beneath the forms of knowledgethere is some other principle which has no change, no form, but which is like alight which illumines the mute, pictorial forms which the mind assumes. The selfis nothing but this light. We all speak of our \"self but we have no mentalpicture of the self as we have of other things, yet in all our knowledge we seemto know our self. The Jains had said that the soul was veiled by karma matter,and every act of knowledge meant only the partial removal of the veil. Samkhyasays that the self cannot be found as an image of knowledge, but that is becauseit is a distinct, transcendent principle, whose real nature as such is behind orbeyond the subtle matter of knowledge. Our cognitions, so far as they are mereforms or images, are merely compositions or complexes of subtle mind-substance,and thus are like a sheet of painted canvas immersed in darkness; as the canvasgets prints from outside and moves, the pictures appear one by one before thelight and are illuminated. So it is with our knowledge. The specialcharacteristic of self is that it is like a light, without which all knowledgewould be blind. Form and motion are the characteristics of matter, and so far asknowledge is mere limited form and movement it is the same as matter; but thereis some other principle which enlivens these knowledge-forms, by virtue of whichthey become conscious. This principle of consciousness (cit) cannot indeed beseparately perceived per se, but the presence of this principle in all our formsof knowledge is distinctly indicated by inference. This principle ofconsciousness has no motion, no form, no quality, no impurity 1 . The movementof the knowledge-stuff takes place in relation to it, so that it is illuminatedas consciousness by it, and produces the appearance of itself as undergoing allchanges of knowledge and experiences of pleasure and pain. Each item ofknowledge so far as it is an image or a picture of some sort is but a subtleknowledge-stuff which has been illumined by the principle of consciousness, butso far as each item of knowledge carries with it the awakening or the enliveningof consciousness, it is the manifestation of the principle of consciousness.Knowledge-revelation is not the unveiling or revelation of a particular part ofthe self, as the Jains supposed, but it is a revelation of the self only so faras knowledge is pure awakening, pure enlivening, pure consciousness. So far asthe content of knowledge or the image is concerned, it is not the revelation ofself but is the blind knowledge-stuff.The Buddhists had analysed knowledge into its diverse constituent parts, and hadheld that the coming together of these brought about the conscious states. Thiscoming together was to them the point of the illusory notion of self, since thisunity or coming together was not a permanent thing but a momentary collocation.With Samkhya however the self, the pure cit, is neither illusory nor156 SURENDRANATH DASGUPTAan abstraction; it is concrete but transcendent. Coming into touch with it givesunity to all the movements of the knowledge-composites of subtle stuff, whichwould otherwise have remained aimless and unintelligent. It is by coming intoconnection with this principle of intelligence that they are interpreted as thesystematic and coherent experience of a person, and may thus be said to beintelligized. Intelligizing means the expression and interpretation of theevents or the happenings of knowledge in connection with a person, so as to makethem a system of experience. This principle of intelligence is called purusa.There is a separate purusa in Samkhya for each individual, and it is of thenature of pure intelligence. The Vedanta atman however is different from theSamkhya purusa in this that it is one and is of the nature of pure intelligence,pure being, and pure bliss. It alone is the reality and by illusory maya itappears as many.THOUGHT AND MATTERA question naturally arises, that if the knowledge forms are made up of somesort of stuff as the objective forms of matter are, why then should the purusailluminate it and not external material objects. The answer that Samkhya givesis that the knowledge-complexes are certainly different from external objects inthis, that they are far subtler and have a preponderance of a special quality ofplasticity and translucence (sattva), which resembles the light of purusa, andis thus fit for reflecting and absorbing the light of the purusa. The twoprincipal characteristics of external gross matter are mass and energy. But ithas also the other characteristic of allowing itself to be photographed by ourmind; this thought-photograph of matter has again the special privilege of beingso translucent as to be able to catch the reflection of the cit —thesuper-translucent transcendent principle of intelligence. The fundamentalcharacteristic of external gross matter is its mass; energy is common to bothgross matter and the subtle thought-stuff. But mass is at its lowest minimum inthought-stuff, whereas the capacity of translucence, or what may be otherwisedesignated as the intelligence-stuff, is at its highest in thought-stuff. But ifthe gross matter had none of the characteristics of translucence that thoughtpossesses, it could not have made itself an object of thought; for thoughttransforms itself into the shape, colour, and other characteristics of the thingwhich has been made its object. Thought could not have copied the matter, if thematter did not possess some of the essential substances of which the copy wasmade up. But this plastic entity (sattva) which is so predominant in thought isat its lowest limit of subordination in matter. Similarly mass is not noticed inthought, but some such notions as are associated with mass may be discernible inthought; thus the images of thought are limited, separate, have movement, andhave more or less clear cut forms. The images do not extend in space, but theycan represent space. The translucent and plastic element of thought (sattva) inassociation with movement (rajas) would have resulted in a simultaneousrevelation of all objects; it is on account of mass or tendency of obstruction(tamas) that knowledge proceeds from image to image and discloses things in asuccessive manner. The buddhi(thought-stuff) holds within it all knowledge immersed as it were in utterdarkness, and actual knowledge comes before our view as though by the removal ofthe darkness or veil, by the reflection of the light of the purusa. Thischaracteristic of knowledge, that all its stores are hidden as if lost at anymoment, and only one picture or idea comes at a time to the arena of revelation,demonstrates that in knowledge there is a factor of obstruction which manifestsitself in its full actuality in gross matter as mass. Thus both thought andgross matter are made up of three elements, a plasticity of intelligence-stuff(sattva), energy-stuff (rajas), and mass-stuff (tamas), or the factor ofobstruction. Of these the last two are predominant in gross matter and the firsttwo in thought.FEELINGS, THE ULTIMATE SUBSTANCESAnother question that arises in this connection is the position of feeling insuch an analysis of thought and matter. Samkhya holds that the threecharacteristic constituents that we have analyzed just now are feelingsubstances. Feeling is the most interesting side of our consciousness. It is inour feelings that we think of our thoughts as being parts of ourselves. If weshould analyze any percept into the crude and undeveloped sensations of which itis composed at the first moment of its apperance, it comes more as a shock thanas an image, and we find that it is felt more as a feeling mass than as animage. Even in our ordinary life the elements which precede an act of knowledgeare probably mere feelings. As we go lower down the scale of evolution theautomatic actions and relations of matter are concomitant with crudemanifestations of feeling which never rise to the level of knowledge. The lowerthe scale of evolution the less is the keenness of feeling, till at last therecomes a stage where matter-complexes do not give rise to feeling reactions butto mere physical reactions. Feelings thus mark the earliest track ofconsciousness, whether we look at it from the point of view of evolution or ofthe genesis of consciousness in ordinary life. What we call matter-complexesbecome at a certain stage feeling-complexes and what we call feeling-complexesat a certain stage of descent sink into mere matter-complexes with matterreaction. The feelings are therefore the things-in-themselves, the ultimatesubstances of which consciousness and gross matter are made up. Ordinarily adifficulty might be felt in taking feelings to be the ultimate substances ofwhich gross matter and thought are made up; for we are more accustomed to takefeelings as being merely subjective, but if we remember the Samkhya analysis, wefind that it holds that thought and matter are but two different modificationsof certain subtle substances which are in essence but three types of feelingentities. The three principal characteristics of thought and matter that we havenoticed in the preceding section are but the manifestations of three types offeeling substances. There is the class of feelings that we call the sorrowful,there is another class of feelings that we call pleasurable, and there is stillanother class which is neither sorrowful nor pleasurable, but is one ofignorance, depression (visada) or dullness. Thus corresponding to these threetypes of manifestations as pleasure, pain, and dullness, and materially asshining (prakasa), energy158 SURENDRANATH DASGUPTA(pravrtti), obstruction (niyama), there are three types of feeling-substanceswhich must be regarded as the ultimate things which make up all the diversekinds of gross matter and thought by their varying modifications.THE GUNASThese three types of ultimate subtle entities are technically called guna inSamkhya philosophy. Guna in Sanskrit has three meanings, namely (1) quality, (2)rope, (3) not primary. These entities, however, are substances and not merequalities. But it may be mentioned in this connection that in Samkhya philosophythere is no separate existence of qualities; it holds that each and every unitof quality is but a unit of substance. What we call quality is but a particularmanifestation or appearance of a subtle entity. Things do not possess quality,but quality signifies merely the manner in which a substance reacts; any objectwe see seems to possess many qualities, but the Samkhya holds that correspondingto each and every new unit of quality, however fine and subtle it may be, thereis a corresponding subtle entity, the reaction of which is interpreted by us asa quality. This is true not only of qualities of external objects but also ofmental qualities as well. These ultimate entities were thus called gunasprobably to suggest that they are the entities which by their variousmodifications manifest themselves as gunas or qualities. These subtle entitiesmay also be called gunas in the sense of ropes because they are like ropes bywhich the soul is chained down as if it were to thought and matter. These mayalso be called gunas as things of secondary importance, because though permanentand indestructible, they continually suffer modifications and changes by theirmutual groupings and regroupings, and thus not primarily and unalterablyconstant like the souls (purusa). Moreover the object of the world process beingthe enjoyment and salvation of the purusas, the matter-principle could notnaturally be regarded as being of primary importance. But in whatever senses wemay be inclined to justify the name guna as applied to these subtle entities, itshould be borne in mind that they are substantive entities or subtle substancesand not abstract qualities. These gunas are infinite in number, but inaccordance with their three main characteristics as described above they havebeen arranged in three classes or types called sattva (intelligence-stuff),rajas (energy-stuff) and tamas (mass-stuff). An infinite number of subtlesubstances which agree in certain characteristics of self-shining or plasticityare called the sattva-gunas and those which behave as units of activity arecalled the rajo-gunas and those which behave as factors of obstruction, mass ormateriality are called tamo-gunas. These subtle guna substances are united indifferent proportions (e.g. a larger number of sattva substances with a lessernumber of rajas or tamas, or a larger number of tamas substances with a smallernumber of rajas and sattva substances and so on in varying proportions), and asa result of this, different substances with different qualities come into being.Though attached to one another when united in different proportions, theymutually act and react upon one another, and thus by their combined resultantproduce new characters, qualities and substances.There is however one and only one stage in which the gunas are not compounded invarying proportions. In this state each of the guna substances is opposed byeach of the other guna substances, and thus by their equal mutual oppositioncreate an equilibrium, in which none of the characters of the gunas manifestthemselves. This is a state which is so absolutely devoid of all characteristicsthat it is absolutely incoherent, indeterminate, and indefinite. It is aqualitiless simple homogeneity. It is a state of being which is as it werenon-being. This state of the mutual equilibrium of the gunas is called prakrti 1. This is a state which cannot be said either to exist or to non-exist for itserves no purpose, but it is hypo-thetically the mother of all things. This ishowever the earliest stage, by the breaking of which, later on, allmodifications take place.NOTES1 It is important to note that Samkhya has two terms to denote the two aspectsinvolved in knowledge, viz. the relating element of awareness as such (cit), andthe content (buddhi) which is the form of the mind-stuff representing thesense-data and the image. Cognition takes place by the reflection of the formerin the latter.The Legacy of the Indus CivilizationF. R. ALLCHINF. R. Allchin, a well-known student of Indian religion, specializes ininterpreting the earliest period of Indian civilization, linked to the IndusValley located in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. There in thethird millennium b.c.e., the two cities of Mohenjodaro and Harappa were builtand became the main centers of a widespread culture. The following selectiondiscusses the recent interpretation of the Indus Valley culture, both as regardsits origin and the legacy it left to the subsequent history of the region thatis today's India and Pakistan.PART ONEL erhaps the most significant discoveries of the past two decades have beenthose relating to the spread of peasant settlements in the Indus Valley inPre-Harappan (or as one should prefer to call them, Early Indus) and evenearlier Neolithic times. Among the excavated sites of this group are Amri, KotDiji, Gumla, Harappa and Kalibangan. In the north an extension to the foothillsis indicated by the discovery of Sarai Khola near Taxila. The development musthave resulted from the initial exploitation of the rich flood plain of the Indusand160 F. R. Allchinits tributaries, and must have spread outward with the expansion of thepopulation this produced. It seems to have been accompanied throughout by atendency toward cultural convergence, and it provides the unequivocal basis interms of human, technical and cultural resources on which the succeeding Maturestage of Indus Civilization is based. From the present point of view thematurity of the civilization must be seen as the climax of an organicdevelopmental process starting in the early Indus times, if not yet earlier.Acceptance of this model suggests profoundly important analogies between it andthe luminous words of Robert Redfield respecting the special character of IndianCivilization as indigenous, having \"developed out of the precivilized people ofthat very culture, converting them into the peasant half of the sameculture-civilization,\" so that \"the continuity with their own nativecivilization has persisted,\" peasant tradition affects the doctrine of thelearned, and there is continuing interaction between the learned and folklevels. In short, while there is no reason to neglect the possibility that theIndus Civilization arose as a partial result of stimuli applied from outside,either from the uplands to the west, or more distantly from the Persian Gulf orMesopotamia in the Early Dynastic or Sargonid times, or from Central Asia, andthat these stimuli may have involved the arrival of men as well as ideas, itsactual emergence must be seen primarily as a dynamic socioeconomic process,taking place on Indian soil, and not as something implanted from outside. Thisis profoundly significant for subsequent developments, since it implies that thelegacy of the Indus Civilization may be sought in the life style of the commonpeople of India and Pakistan, as much as in the learned tradition. This isexemplified by such things as the identity of ploughing patterns in the fieldsof Pre-Harappan Kalibangan and of the modern peasant population of the region;or by the direct analogy of one of the distinctive types of terracotta modelcarts from Mohenjodaro to a type which today survives only in upper Sind. Thesethings can only mean that there is a direct and unbroken craft tradition ortradition of agricultural practice linking the two periods, and this in turnimplies a continuum of population and a direct and unbroken rural life stylefrom the Early Indus times forward.Another important set of discoveries has provided evidence that thehunter-gatherers, using a stone technology and generally spoken of asMesolithic, or Late Stone Age, had spread widely across the Subcontinent longbefore the emergence of the Indus Civilization. The current excavations of theFrench Archaeological Mission at Mehrgarh near Sibi have added a new perspectiveto the knowledge of the antecedents of the Indus Civilization, and may beexpected in particular to throw ver> important light on the earliest stages ofthe development of settled agriculture in the Indian Subcontinent. This in turnis likely to contribute to the understanding of relations of the firstagricultural communities to such groups of hunter-gatherers. Further, it isbeginning to emerge that, at least in those places where evidence is available,groups of these people continued to live predominantly as stone-usinghunter-gatherers, sometimes driven into areas of relative isolation, long afterthe use of metals had become common in the more advanced communities. It is nowapparent that even before the emergence of the Indus Civilization in manyregions of South Asia peasant or pastoral communities had appeared, and that insome cases these groups may have enjoyediAsocial, economic or political relations of one kind or another with thePre-Harappan settlements. How far both these and the settled communities aroseas the result of the age-old tendency of peoples to move into the Subcontinentfrom the less hospitable lands to the west or north, and how far they arose by aprocess of local evolution from among the existing tribal populations has yet tobe established. Probably both tendencies played their parts. But it is in suchearly settlements that the first localized cultural characters of some of theregions can be distinguished. The coexistence of groups at differentsocioeconomic and cultural levels, in close association with each other, oftenover long periods of time, may already at this stage be clearly distinguished.Both these tendencies were to play a significant role in the subsequentlifestyle of the regions of the Subcontinent. Thus they deserve to be borne inmind while considering the transmission of the legacy of the Indus Civilization.It has been suggested that already during the Early Indus stage there was aperiod of rapid expansion of settled population throughout the Indus Valley andthat it was accompanied by an outward spread towards less densely settled butattractive areas. This process may have involved both the establishment of newsettlements in regions hitherto largely unsettled (i.e., populated by groups ofhunters and collectors, or by primarily nomadic or seminomadic pastoralists);and the conquest or colonization of areas which already had a settledagricultural population. In some cases it may have involved the establishment ofnew settlements among the settlements of the already existing regional culture.Such variations in the pattern of culture contact are likely to be recognizablein the archaeological record, once their hypothetical existence is admitted. Ata certain point this process triggered off changes resulting in the formation ofcities, and the development of a new set of socioeconomic relations—the IndusCivilization. One must expect the same processes of growth and spread to havecontinued thereafter, and hence one would expect to find an outward spread ofthe Mature Urban Culture into areas hitherto peopled by tribal and/or peasantcommunities. Evidence to support this hypothesis appears to be forthcoming inseveral regions. In Saurashtra and Gujarat, Harappan settlements seem to bedispersed among those of a regional peasant culture, and this must be presumedto have led to contacts between the two at various levels. In East Punjab, inthe Drishad-vati and Sarasvati Valleys, and even further east in theGanga/Yamuna Doab, there are somewhat similar indications. Dr. Suraj Bhan hasreported sites related to the Early Indus stage at Kalibangan, and theircontinued occupation alongside sites which may more properly be called Harappan.This suggests the sort of culture contact situations to be found in the areas inwhich this spread was taking place. It is interesting to notice how theRajasthan desert seems to have acted as a barrier to expansion, even thoughthere was already a population of tribal people of mixed economy (as at Bagor)and perhaps also of agricultural settlements in parts of the region, and findsof Mesolithic tools suggest that such people were widely distributed there. Onemay expect that they enjoyed some sort of contacts with the Harappansprospecting for ores or raw materials and trading with them in such things asmetal tools.Within the area embraced by the Early and Mature Indus Civilization two opposingtendencies may be noticed: one convergent and the other divergent.162 F. R. AllchinThe first is the more prominent: It has long been apparent that one of theconcomitants of the change from the Early to Mature Indus Cultures was theestablishment of an extraordinary degree of cultural uniformity over a vastarea. This convergent tendency is indeed already clearly visible during theEarly Indus Period, and as this fact becomes more apparent it makes the changeof style from Early to Mature Indus times all the more remarkable. Sir JohnMarshall discussed this aspect at length, and others have generally agreed withhim. What was involved in terms of the population as a whole can only be partlyguessed at, but it seems that the convergent tendency reached a new height withthe growth of Mohenjodaro as a city, and therefore that the tendency may well goback to the foundation of that city whenever it may have been, perhaps towardsthe end of the second quarter of the third millennium. Presumably it would havemore or less coincided with the first development of a full system of writingand the manufacture of inscribed seals. This seems to have been the signal for arapid and wholesale diffusion of traits recognizable in the archaeologicalrecord, suggesting the spread or imposition of a common lifestyle which in timeextended throughout the entire Harappan Culture region. The means for thisspread remain unclear. That it was assisted by an unprecedented extension ofinternal trade in all manner of raw materials and commodities may be safelyinferred, and that it witnessed a distribution of the specialist craft productsof the cities is probable. Among trade goods one may cite the stone blades whichappear to have been obtained and manufactured at such centers as the vastfactories at Rohri, the similar indications of centralized manufacture ofvarious classes of metal objects, of shell bangles and carnelian beads. Anaspect of the mechanism by which this trade was carried on has been discussed bymy wife (B. Allchin 1979). It seems certain that the emergence of urbanism musthave also involved the extension of a single unifying socioeconomic pattern,including government and administration, and of a common pattern of beliefs andideology. In sum it must have witnessed the promulgation of what one may callthe Indus lifestyle, with all that went with it. The fact that the geographicalconfines of this culture region embraced an area far greater than that of anyother of the great civilizations of the third millennium makes the process allthe more remarkable. It may also be stated with certainty that the lifestyleincorporated not only popular matters but also the learned or 'great' traditionof the Indus Civilization. It is from among these things that scholars havefound, or at least believed that they found, all manner of traits ancestral tothose of later, even of modern, Indian civilization.However, while recognizing the convergent tendency in the Indus Civilization,one must not neglect to notice the indications of regionalism or culturaldivergence within the greater Indus system, leading to what may even be seen asseparate culture provinces. One would expect there to be several kinds ofdivergence. First, the very real differences which already begin to emergeduring the Neolithic stage, and later within the provinces of the early IndusCulture regions between such sites as Amri, Kot Diji, Gumla or Kalibangan,evidently continued to a certain extent, even after the imposition of the Indusstyle, reflecting no doubt these earlier differences. Second, even during thecomparatively short life of the Mature Indus Civilization one may expect thatthere wouldhave been a further general tendency towards separate development in certainrespects in the different provinces, due to all sorts of possible causes. Thedivergences could in part reflect local reactions against the convergenttendency. A third possible cause could be the arrival in a given region of newgroups who established some sort of power over, or relationship with, theexisting population and proceeded in one way or another to influence the finalstages of the Indus Culture therein. This aspect is crucially important in termsof legacy, and it must be considered further. A fairly circumscribed regionaldevelopment appears to be represented by the Cemetery H Phase at Harappa andprobably at related sites (at Bara and sites of East Punjab, in Bahawalpur,etc.). One is inclined to follow Vats in seeing this phase as a final stage inthe Indus Culture representing the arrival of some sort of \"Aryan\" invaders inthe region and their interaction with the existing population, leading to adegree of cultural synthesis. Another set of data which suggests something ofthe same kind is provided by the apparent contrast between certain sites atwhich stone or terracotta linga are reported, notably at Mohenjodaro, atHarappa, and at Surkotada, and other sites (or perhaps a phase at some sites) atwhich \"ritual\" fire altars are reported. Such altars are expressly absent atSurkotada, and also apparently at Mohenjodaro and Harappa, but are reported atKalibangan from the beginning of the Harappan Period. Here several types ofhearth are found; among them one is distinguished from the normal domestic typesby the excavators. The \"ritual\" hearth, with a brick or clay \"pillar\" in itscenter occurs in three locations: on the top of a brick platform in the walledbrick \"Citadel\" enclosure a row of seven were found, associated with a brick pitcontaining animal bones and with a well; single examples of the same type occurin small rooms in domestic houses, perhaps used for domestic rituals; andseveral more were found in a square brick enclosure outside the east wall of thelower city. These three contexts suggest that fire rituals formed a part of thereligious life of the town, at a civic, domestic and popular level. They arealso highly suggestive of an Indo-Iranian, if not more specifically Indo-Aryan,element in the culture of the period covered by these excavations.Thus, if enough evidence of this sort were forthcoming, the regional divergencesmight in some instances be associated with the meeting of indigenous Induspopulations and intrusive Indo-Iranian or Aryan elements, and with some sort ofresulting cultural synthesis. This would clearly be of great significance forany discussion of legacy. It is of course wholly possible that similar intrusivegroups may also have moved into the southern Indus provinces, but if they did sothey seem to have coincided with a more or less complete extinction of thecentralized urban authority rather than with its late stages, and theircontribution to the legacy may be expected to have been therefore mainly at thevillage level. Thus there is likely to have been a major difference between thesituation in the northern and southern parts of the Harappan Culture region.One must now consider certain aspects of the civilization which resulted fromthis transformation of existing peasant and tribal social elements. The accessof new data has already revealed much and doubtless much more awaits bothdiscovery and analysis, but some aspects remain, and are long likely to, elusivefor the archaeologist. Thus while one is learning more about the town planning,and such things as house plans, plant and animal foods, technology164 F. R. Allchinand crafts, one still has only rudimentary indications as to the meaning of allthese in terms of social and economic relations. Similarly, while there areseals and art objects which reveal a clearly defined body of symbols and myths,there is still surprisingly little definite knowledge of the religious beliefsor ideology of their makers, although here one is beginning to gain an importantnew dimension from finds in the Early Indus Cultures. The reading of the scriptwill almost certainly throw new light on trade and economics, and perhapsmarginally on ideology, but even so the absence of longer inscriptions must meanthat many topics will remain essentially speculative. This point is made mainlybecause it is just in these fields, in economic and social relations, inreligious beliefs and ideology, that an important part of the Harappan legacy islikely to be most strongly evident in later Indian culture, and if one cannotpositively identify such things at their source, how far is one entitled tospeak of the legacy at all? This prompts one again to stress the importance ofthe framing of general hypotheses, as without them the contexts of individualfacts, or groups of data, may be difficult to establish.PART TWOThere is still much room for divergent views about the end of the IndusCivilization, but as this event provides, in a sense, with a terminus forconsideration of the legacy, as opposed to the nature of the civilizationitself, one must try to establish a satisfactory general hypothesis. Thecivilization has been thought of as a social, economic and cultural phenomenonproduced as a consequence of the build up of population on the fertile plains ofthe Indus and the Punjab. It involved a delicate balance of internal relationsbetween cities, towns and villages, and of external relations with neighboringpeasant societies and with more distant urban societies. The end of thecivilization probably arose from some major upsetting of this balance. Thiscould have been produced by a variety of causes, acting either singly or incombination. It is possible, although there is as yet little supportingevidence, that there was a deterioration of climate; but as the main foodproduction depended upon exploiting the Indus river's flood plain inundationthis is unlikely to have been sufficient cause. It is possible too that therewas a \"wearing out\" of the land, due to overcultivation; but in the light of theenduring fertility of the soils of the Indian Subcontinent over subsequentmillennia of intensive cultivation this too seems unlikely. One acceptsLam-brick's 1967 demonstration of the implausibility of the theory thatMohenjodaro was engulfed in a vast flood, and one is inclined to agree with hiswell-argued case that there may have been disastrous changes in the course ofthe Indus, resulting in the desiccation of areas which were essential for thefeeding of the city's population, as a more likely cause of the end of thatcity. Such an event would lead to depredations by tribesmen from the nearbyhills, and might well have brought about the desertion of the city and ofoutlying settlements. But would it have been a sufficient shock to upset thewhole balance? This is a more difficult question, even if it is assumed, as itis more and more, that Mohenjodaro was in some way the \"epicenter\" around whichthe whole structure was held inbalance. Would the attackers have been Aryan? This one cannot tell, but both interms of the probable date of the event, and of the history of the dispersal ofthe Indo-European language family, there is no inherent impossibility in such athing. If this was the state in Sind, what of the Punjab? Here too there aresuggestions that there may have been major changes in the channels of rivers,due in part no doubt to tectonic events; but there is no very clear evidencethat any of these coincided with the end of Harappa and Kalibangan. Moreover ashas been seen at both sites there are suggestions that there may have been aperiod of coexistence of the population with conquering \"Aryan\" elements.Nevertheless, whatever may have been the cause or causes of the end of thecivilization, what is of primary concern is that at a certain point in time itcame to an end.One must now proceed to consider \"what was lost\" and \"what survived.\" Clearlythe postulated central power and authority, together with whateveradministrative machinery it possessed, must have been the first to go; and withthem the economic organization and the highly organized trade or exchange ofgoods. All of these would seem to have followed upon the abandonment of theurban nucleus at Mohenjodaro, if this were the primary cause of the breakdown.But there need not, indeed there is most unlikely to have been, a comparable orsimultaneous abandonment at all the other centers. Even if there is a marked andabrupt break in the material culture, this need not indicate desertion of asite, followed by reoccupation, but it may indicate no more than a withdrawal ofthe centrally imposed \"urban\" uniformity, and a return to (even reemergence of)the regional peasant styles. In some cases the break may indicate the arrival ofconquerors, and the imposition of new elements upon the existing style. Theuniformity of the Indus period is replaced by a whole series of local culturepatterns; and at the socioeconomic level the breakdown of the centrally imposedauthority must have been marked.These things one may expect to have disappeared in their entirety. But what wasretained or at least partly retained? First, many of the crafts and technicalskills which were flourishing also at village level, and for which there wouldhave been a continuing demand, would have persisted; while certain specializedurban or luxury crafts, including seal making, would have disappeared. Someparts of the urban lifestyle may have partly survived. For example, writing andthe uniform system of weights and measures would almost certainly have gone ascoherent systems, but must surely have left certain signs or convenient units ofweight or measure in use. Many domestic aspects of the Indus lifestyle, thehouse plans, disposition of water supply, hearth and kitchen types, attention tobathing, etc. would survive in the settlements, and much could have beenabsorbed by newly arrived barbarian conquerors. There would be a very widesurvival of traits pertaining to ideology and religious belief, particularly ofthose which were in common acceptance and which involved domestic practice.The religious beliefs of the Indus Civilization would have been maintained inseveral ways: first, in the cities there must have been a class of specialistexponents or priests (who may also have constituted, or been closely associatedwith, the administrative group). Such people would be among those more likely tointermarry with a new ruling class, or in other ways to win for themselves166 F. R. Allchinpositions of power or influence in a new order. Such a pattern was oftenwitnessed much later, during the centuries of early Muslim conquest. Thus theywould find themselves in a position to maintain an important body of their ownbeliefs, and to pass it on to their children, if not to their conquerors. At thepopular level, tradition must also have been passed on within the family, inmuch the way as it has continued to be in India down to modern times. Throughthese two channels the cult of sacred places, rivers or trees, of sacredanimals, and of symbols or myths would have survived; as too might a large partof the cosmology, philosophy and other parts of the learned tradition, evenafter the end of the cities. The strength and maintenance of the tradition wouldbe greatly enhanced if, as one is inclined to believe, the initial period of\"Aryan\" settlement in the north coincided with the survival, at least for atime, of more or less full urban life under foreign rule, and with a situationsuch as that which one has surmised the Cemetery H Phase to have witnessed. Thisperiod of coexistence would have provided an opportunity for the priests oradministrators to acquire the language of the conquerors and to have begunintegrating the ideologies of the two groups. Here too the rapid acquisitionfirst of Persian, later of English, by higher castes may suggest an appropriatemodel from recent times. Thus from the meeting of the two a new amalgam, anIndian or Indo-Aryan cultural tradition was born. This hypothesis does notdemand \"armies\" of invaders. One would expect rather small bands, whose horsesmade them relatively mobile, and who may often have achieved whatever power theyacquired by means other than open warfare. It is still not possible to decide atwhat precise stage groups ancestral to the authors of the Rigveda arrived, butone believes that there was a period during which there was a generalrestlessness, and it may well be that a whole series of waves drifted into theIndus Valley and the Punjab over succeeding centuries. This, after all, had beena pattern which continued through the historical period also. It is not evennecessary that all the groups should have been Indo-Aryan speaking, or evenIndo-Iranian. But it may be imagined that the closer were the ties of languageand ancestry between such groups, the more marked would have been their ownsolidarity, and the polarity between them and the indigenous population.Thus one can see that the survival and onward transmission of the Harappanlegacy must have been at several different levels and of several differentkinds. First, a widespread survival of the way of life among the common peopleparticularly in the villages, in each of the main areas of settlement; andassociated with this there would have been the survival of a series of littletraditions in the several culture regions into which the peasant societies ofPost-Harappan times devolved. With the removal of the urban authority thedifference between the structure of village societies within and without theconfines of the civilization would have been considerably reduced, and roughlysimilar structures would appear throughout. At the same time there would be atendency for older, distinctive, culture traits to reemerge regionally. Hence,in all these regions one may expect the Harappan legacy to be passed down at thefolk level, and to spread with the continuing expansion of the peasant society.Indeed this was probably the time when the village assumed the dominant role inIndian societywhich it has continued to occupy henceforward; so that while cities may havecome and gone, the villages have survived with their own special Indianlifestyle. But at this level the surviving elements would be mainly thoseappropriate for the folk or village society, and many others of distinctly urbancharacter would tend to disappear.A second kind of transmission of the legacy must have been at the level of thegreat or learned tradition and would presumably have been much more restrictedgeographically, being mainly confined to those areas in which there was alreadya synthesis of Indus urban and \"Aryan\" ruling elements, during the later stagesof the civilization. This sort of transmission probably developed in the Punjaband spread eastwards with the expansion of population and settlements into theDoab and Ganges Valley. Already by the time of a compilation of the VedicSamhitas the process must have been providing an increasingly distinct elementof the ideology, which one may now begin to call Indian, or culturallyIndo-Aryan, as distinct from either Indus or Aryan. This is not the place todiscuss the interesting and important question of which among the several groupsof possible Aryans constituted the first arrivals in the Indus culture region;whether they were \"Pre-Vedic\" or \"Non-Sanskritic,\" or \"Proto-Rigvedic.\" Thismatter has recently been discussed by Dr. Parpola and I have touched on it inanother paper (F. Allchin in press). But one has long been of the view that theymust be regarded as culturally at least the direct ancestors of the VedicAryans. In these areas of course the transmission at the folk or village levelalso took place, and this in turn would have facilitated at a later date thesecondary spread of the great tradition to other regions sharing the legacy atthose levels. This hypothesis does not altogether preclude a similar survival ofelements of the great tradition in other regions, notably in the South, in Sindor Saurashtra and beyond, but one believes that there it would be relativelymuch less powerful than in the North.If the legacy thus transmitted was partly at the level of the great tradition,it is unlikely that it was done without considerable attenuation. The use ofwriting seems to have vanished, indeed one does not know how far it was used inHarap-pan times for purposes other than narrowly commercial, and probably muchelse with it. But the newly emerging Indian tradition must have receivedcontinuing enrichment from the folk level, and much may have survived at thatlevel, to be later reabsorbed into the learned tradition.The period following the end of the Harappan cities was one of continuingeastward expansion of Indo-Aryan Culture, now associated with the cultivation ofrice and with an unprecedented growth of population. One may expect that alreadyin the East (and for that matter the South) there were distinctive peasantsocieties in existence, each with its own cultural tradition, and thus thespread of the Indo-Aryan great tradition would have coincided with itsencountering them. These factors led to the rapid expansion of settlements inthe upper, middle and lower Ganges Valley and paved the way to the reemergenceof cities there. These, like their Indus predecessors, were the products oftheir social and economic bases. But it is important to note that they were notthe centers for the emergence of the early Indian tradition. This tradition wasthere before the168 F. R. Allchincities, in the shape of the Vedic Samhitas, the accompanying schools ofexegesis, and all that went with them; and also at the level of a more or lessrelated series of little traditions, transmitted at the folk level. The newcities produced, however, a profound, even traumatic, reformulation of receivedtradition and ideology, and witnessed the development of Buddhism, Jainism andthe other new \"city\" religious movements, notably Vaishnavism. But throughoutthis reformulation the prior existence of a tradition, from which to borrow andagainst which to react, can be clearly recognized. Thus while the life style ofthe Gangetic cities is also in many ways new, it embodies an incalculably largeelement which is very old, and which survived in one way or another from theearlier cities of the Indus.The hypothesis advanced must be tested against the available data. For example,the presence of lingas or of an iconographic type suggestive of Siva-Pasupati inthe Indus cities, has often been seen as anticipating the later \"emergence\" ofRudra-Siva in the Vedic-late Vedic literature. One may now postulate thatSiva-Mahadeva was a central concept of the Indus religion, which survived inboth the great and folk traditions and developed as the process of theIndianization advanced. A problematic gulf appears to separate the narrowIndo-Iranian, polytheistic ideology postulated by philologists as that of theearly Vedic hymns, from both the mature \"Indian\" character of the \"late\" hymnsof the first and tenth Mandalas of the Rigveda, and their remarkably constantinterpretation in Indian tradition thereafter. Although the gulf may be partlyillusory, it undoubtedly exists. Just how early this shift began would depend,in terms of this hypothesis, upon the date at which the cultural synthesis ofthe two groups began. It is also worth considering whether the decline of theAsuras and the rise to eminence of the Devas, which seems to be happening in thebody of the Rigveda, and to be looked back on as something already complete insuch hymns as X.124, may indicate not so much a divergence of beliefs amongseparated Indo-Iranian groups, but rather—by this time—the process ofIndianization in action.One does not propose to anticipate objections to this hypothesis, but one iswell aware that at more than one point the data are not available from whicheven a probable conclusion may be drawn, and where therefore it is possible topropose various alternative hypotheses. One such point concerns the moment when\"Aryan\" influence first began to exert itself on the Indus Civilization. Forinstance, one possible version would be that it was the arrival of Indo-Aryanspeakers which provided the initial stimulus needed to tip the scales towardscity life, and thus that the whole Indus Civilization from the start may havehad a dominant Aryan strain. This hypothesis, attractive as in some ways it is,can only be sustained in the face of formidable objections, but it must not betoo lightly dismissed. At the other extreme it is possible to argue that therewas a final and irrevocable gap between the end of the cities and the arrival ofthe ancestors of the authors of the Rigveda. This raises almost insuperableproblems of interpretation, not least in terms of the transmission of theHarappan legacy. Thus one is led to prefer a hypothesis which lies somewherebetween the two extremes, that is, bringing the first Aryans into contact withthe still flourishing Mature Indus society.To sum up the main points of this essay—The Indus Civilization arose on Indiansoil as an organic process: it was not primarily superimposed from outside, evenif external stimuli may have contributed. Because of this there was already thenecessary basis of continuity between the peasant and urban communities topermit the sort of persistence of the lifestyle which Robert Redfield remarked.An outward spread of peasant cultures from the Indus system had already begun inPre-Harappan times, and the lifestyle spread with the continuation of thatprocess both during the Mature Indus Civilization and after. Within the EarlyIndus and Mature Indus Civilization the tendency towards cultural convergenceimplies the emergence of a central ideology and learned tradition, and this onemay call the Indus great tradition. In the north of the region there was anappearance of Indo-Aryan speaking people even during the life of thecivilization, and this permits one to postulate a degree of synthesis betweenthe exponents of the Indus great tradition and those of the arriving conquerors.This process is of enormous significance in terms of the onward transmission ofthe legacy, and of the translation of the Indus tradition into a unified Indianor culturally Indo-Aryan tradition. The end of the Indus Civilization appears tohave been brought about by an upsetting of the delicate balance which maintainedits social and economic life, and was probably linked with the abandonment atMo-henjodaro. The Indus legacy survived and was passed on most widely at thefolk or village level, in almost all regions, while the learned tradition mainlysurvived in the Punjab, whence it spread eastwards with the spread ofsettlements in Post-Harappan times. The surviving tradition, an amalgam of Indusand Aryan elements was already active before the reemergence of cities in theGanges Valley and in North India more generally during the first millenniumB.C., and served as the ideological basis upon which the cities produced theirown distinctive ideology. Therefore, to paraphrase an old saying: \"if you seek alegacy, look about vou.\"RevelationELIOT DEUTSCH and J. A. B.

She has written broadly onthe Hindu system of myths. As she says, they deal \"with every subject under thesun.\" How to make sense out of the great number and variety of these myths isthe purpose of the following selection. The book from which this selection istaken is a study of the great Hindu god Shiva. Studying this selection will helpthe reader understand how the mythic imagination, which is akin to thecollective unconscious, weaves its web of relations and meanings.THE CHALLENGE OF HINDU MYTHOLOGY1 hat which cannot be found here exists nowhere\"—this was the boast of theauthor of the great Hindu epic, the Mahdbharata, and it is an excellentdescription of the Puranas, encyclopedic compendia of hundreds of thousands ofSanskrit verses dealing with every subject under the Indian sun. Here are founddynastic histories of obscure kings, detailed recipes for ritual offerings,hair-splitting philosophical arguments, tedious discussions of caste law, and,imbedded in the midst of all of this (\"like a lotus in the mud,\" as the Hindussay), countless sublimely beautiful myths.It is a time-consuming task to sift through the Puranas in search of the myths,but none of it is wasted labour, for the mud is as valuable as the lotus whichit nourishes: the myths come alive only in the context of history, ritual,philosophy, and social law. Hidden somewhere in this maze is the key to theHindu world view, vivid, startling, fascinating, and complex. The mythology ofSiva forms only a small part of the material of the Puranas, but it is an idealmodel which reveals a pattern which pertains to the material as a whole. Siva isnot only an extremely important Hindu god; he is in many ways the most uniquelyIndian god of them all, and the principles which emerge from an intensive studyof his mythology lie at the very heart of Hinduism.Can the mythologv of Siva be used to reveal a still more general, perhapsuniversal, truth? Questions of this sort have long tempted the student ofmythology. It is an old maxim that we often find our home truths in foreignlands. The great Indologist, Heinrich Zimmer, once tried to explain his love forIndian myths by citing the Hassidic tale of the old Jew who travelled fromCracow to Prague only to learn from a young Christian soldier (who did notbelieve or understand the words that he spoke in jest and mockery) that atreasure of gold was buried under the stove in the old man's home, back inCracow. As Zimmer remarks,Now the real treasure, to end our misery and trials, is never far away. . . .But there is the odd and persistent fact that it is only after a faithfuljourney to a distant region, a foreign country, a strange land, that the meaningof the inner voice that is to guide our quest can be revealed to us.Yet the more reasonable goal—and the more rewarding—is simply to understand themyths in situ, to use methods which reveal the meanings that the Hindus saw inthem, to enjoy them as the exotic and delightful creations that they are.To extract these meanings without reducing the myths in any way is no simpletask. The dilemma is at first complicated, but ultimately resolved, by the factthat there are many \"meanings\" in a Hindu myth: \"Hindu mythology is much like aplum pudding. If you do not like the plums in the slice you have, or have beendeprived of a favour, you may always cut another one. The first plum is thestory itself, usually a rather good story, occasionally of the shaggy-dogvariety but frequently with an immediately recognizable point on at least onelevel, which might be termed the narrative level. Closely related is the divinelevel, which concerns mythology as it used to be understood by scholars of theclassics: the metaphorical struggles of divine powers and personalities. Abovethis is the cosmic level of the myth, the expression of universal laws andprocesses, of metaphysical principles and symbolic truths. And below it, shadingoff into folklore, is the human level, the search for meaning in human life, theproblems of human society.No one meaning can be labelled the deepest or the truest. . . . The best wordsare ambiguous, and the more richly ambiguous the more suitable for the poet's orthe myth-maker's job. Hence there is no end to the number of meanings which canbe read into a good myth.The various levels are simultaneous rather than alternative:Each level always refers to some other level, whichever way the myth is read. .. . We can only choose between various degrees of enlargement: each one revealsa level of organization which has no more than a relative truth and, while itlasts, excludes the perception of other levels.In my analyses, I have certainly not exhausted all the meanings of each myth; Ihave not even mentioned all the meanings that I personally see in them. I haveonly discussed those themes in each myth which play a part in the basic schemaof the corpus. This may seem a Procrustean method—to select one theme and thento maintain that it is uniquely important—but it is justified by the materials:I have selected that one theme because it is central. As one reads through theenormous mass of Puranic mythology, certain recurrent elements clearly emerge;myths which at first appeared obscure suddenly become obvious; one senses whatthe myths are about. No single myth contains the key, which is given only by thetotality of variations. The pattern which they form involves a finite number ofelements but will be seen to apply equally well toother (theoretically infinite) groups of myths, for the pattern is basic toHindu thought. The completed model reveals that the apparent contradictions inindividual variants are merely incomplete views of the whole, like the varyingopinions of the blind men grasping the different parts of an elephant (\"It is arope,\" \"It is a wall,\" \"It is a snake\"): it is, in fact, unmistakably anelephant. Although the themes in terms of which I have chosen to analyse theSaiva cycle are not the only themes present in the myths, they are certainlyextremely significant. This is evident from the impressive frequency with whichtheir patterns recur, the ease and simplicity with which they account forotherwise puzzling idio-syncracies in the texts, and the convincing number ofexplicit discussions (within the myths and in other Indian materials) of theproblems which they represent.A further note of caution must be voiced here on the subject of arbitraryselection. Not only are the myths and themes themselves selected, but the veryepisodes and words of the myths are necessarily slanted as well. The SanskritPuranas are extremely garrulous and digressive, and in order to include as widea selection of myths as possible I have summarized rather than translated,omitting large bodies of material superfluous to the present study, such ashymns of praise, ritual instructions, detailed descriptions, and philosophicaldiscourses. This extraneous material is not only unwieldy but would have tendedto obscure the patterns which emerge from a more selective treatment. I havealso omitted those portions of the text which seem hopelessly corrupt, and insome instances where the meaning seems quite clear in spite of the garbled textI have given the best sense I could make of it. I have not (knowingly) addedanything that is not in the text, but I may have omitted in one version certaindetails that occur in another, thus inadvertently disguising an actualcorrespondence in the text. In other circumstances I may translate in similarwords two sentences which differ in the wording of the originals, thussuggesting a correspondence which does not in fact exist. I have omittednonrecurring proper names and I have standardized epithets throughout mytranslations. (Secondary sources have been quoted literally unless enclosed inbrackets to indicate my own summary.) A general indication of the degree towhich any particular citation has been compressed may be obtained by comparingthe length of the English version with the length of the Sanskrit text asindicated in the bibliographic note. In taking these liberties I hope I have notdistorted the meanings of the myth, and in so doing I take heart from the wordsof Claude Levi-Strauss, who has said that while poetry may be what is lost intranslation, \"the mythical value of myths remains preserved through the worsttranslations.\"These measures, which are particularly necessary in a method of analysis whichrelies upon numerous different versions of a myth, have been defended byLevi-Strauss:To avoid making the demonstration too unwieldy, I had to decide which myths touse, to opt for certain versions, and in some measure to simplify the variants.Some people will accuse me of having adapted the subject matter of my inquiry tosuit my own purposes.He answers these objections by arguing that, although the selection is to someextent arbitrary, further incidents would only be variants of those selected.A certain stage of the undertaking having been reached, it becomes clear thatits ideal object has acquired sufficient consistency and shape for some of itslatent properties, and especially its existence as an object, to be definitelyplaced beyond all doubt.That the selected themes are mutually reinforcing and fully integrated is takenas evidence of their significance. These criteria are necessary but notsufficient. The recurrence of the isolated themes in other myths, as well as inother texts, iconography, and ritual, is further proof of their importance.THE CENTRAL PARADOX OF SAIVA MYTHOLOGYThe wise applicability of the recurrent supplementary themes from the Pur-aniccorpus is evident from the role that they play in one of the enduring problemsof Hindu mythology, the paradox of Siva the erotic ascetic. This problem hasoften been noted and by now is sometimes accepted as a matter of fact: the greatascetic is the god of the phallus (the lihga). The meaning of this paradox,however, has never been properly explored.The character of Siva has always been an enigma to Western scholars. Only asmall portion of the corpus of ancient Saiva mythology has been translated fromthe Sanskrit; with this inadequate representation, it is not surprising that themythology of Siva was considered contradictory and paradoxical by scholars whosaw only the two ends of the spectrum. Siva the Creator and Destroyer, Life andDeath, the coincidentia oppositorum —this much was accepted as consistent withIndian metaphysical thought, and the apparent sexual ambiguity of the god wasregarded as simply one more aspect of a basically ambiguous character or aresult of the chance historical assimilation of two opposing strains, a processwell known in Indian religion. In the absence of critical editions of the SaivaPuranas (medieval Sanskrit texts containing numerous myths), the problem wasnever properly considered, and the very fact of its paradoxical nature was takenas an accepted quality of Saiva thought, a property upon which furtherspeculation could be based.At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Abbe J. A. Dubois described withshocked disbelief the seemingly contradictory concept of sexuality exemplifiedby the forest-dwelling ascetics:By one of those contradictions which abound in Hindu books, side by side withthe account of the punishments inflicted on a hermit for his inability toconquer his sensual passions, we find, related with expressions of enthusiasmand admiration, the feats of debauchery ascribed to some of their munis [asceticsages]—feats that lasted without interruption for thousands of years; and(burlesque idea!) it is to their pious asceticism that they are said to owe thisunquenchable virility.This very \"burlesque idea\" is the core of the nature of Siva, who is the god ofascetics, but out of its mythological context it could have no significance. Norhas contemporary scholarship found a satisfactory solution to the enduringenigma of Siva: \"Permanently ithyphallic, yet perpetually chaste: how is one toexplain such a phenomenon?\"The problem was intensified by uncertainties regarding Siva's place in thehistorical development of Hinduism. Failure to connect him with the Vedic godsIndra, Prajapati, and Agni led to the assumption that the sexual elements of hiscult were \"non-Aryan\" or at least non-Vedic, and obvious correspondences betweenSaiva myths and Tantric cult led some scholars to seek the origins of Siva'ssexual ambiguity in this comparatively late development. Yet what is strikingabout the problem is that it extends from the period of the Vedas (c. 1200 B.C.)and even earlier, from the prehistoric civilization of the Indus Valley (c. 2000B.C.), through the development of Tantrism, to the religion of present-dayIndia.The ancient Hindus themselves attempted to explain the Saiva phenomenon. ASanskrit poem dating from perhaps A.D. 900 muses upon Siva:If he is naked what need then has he of the bow? If armed with bow then why theholy ashes? If smeared with ashes what needs he with a woman? Or if with her,then how can he hate Love?In the Puranas, the nature of Siva is often a source of worry for gods andmortals who become involved with him. When Himalaya learns that his daughter isto marry Siva, he says, \"It is said that Siva lives without any attachments andthat he performs asceticism all alone. How then can he interrupt his trance tomarry?\" Explicit reasons for Siva's behaviour are given in the course of themyths, but the metaphysical arguments are both secondary and subsequent to thestory. If philosophy could express the problem, there would be no need for themyth to mediate between the two opposed facets; the myth takes over wherephilosophy proves inadequate. Siva himself is said to be troubled by theambivalence in his character, for when Kama, the god of desire, wounds him,shattering his trance and stirring his desire, Siva muses, 1 dwell ever inasceticism. How is it then that I am enchanted by Parvati?' Only involvement inthe eternal cycle of the myth can reveal—even to the god himself—the answer tothis question.The Resolution within the TextsThe solution is not .in arbitrary construction of armchair scholarship,meaningless to the creators and preservers of the myths. Throughout Hindumythology, even from the time of the Vedas, the so-called opposing strands ofSiva's nature have been resolved and accepted as aspects of one nature. They maybe separated in certain contexts, and are frequently confused and misunderstoodeven by the tellers of the tales, but in every age there have been notableexamples of satisfactory resolution. The Siva of Brahmin philosophy ispredominantly ascetic; the Siva of Tantric cult is predominantly sexual. Buteven in each of these, elements of the contrasting nature are present, and inthe myths—whichform a bridge between rational philosophy and irrational cult—Siva appears farmore often in his dual aspect than in either one or the other.As early as the Atharva Veda hymn to the brahmacdrin (a young student who hasundertaken a vow of chastity), there is a detailed description of a sage who hasbeen identified with Siva himself, the great brahmacdrin but also the greatZmgA-bearer, who spills his seed upon the earth. The first explicit reference toSiva's ambiguous sexuality appears in the Mahdbhdrata (c. 300 B.C.), in a hymnin praise of Siva:Whose semen was offered as an oblation into the mouth of Agni, and whose semenwas made into a golden mountain? Who else can be said to be a naked brahmacdrinwith his vital seed drawn up? Who else shares half his body with his wife andhas been able to subjugate Kama?The seed spilt creatively and contained in chastity, the ultimate act of desireand the conquest of desire—the essence of Saiva mythology is in this passage.Statements of resolution persist throughout the Puranas. Siva says that if hemarries, his wife must be a yoginl (female ascetic) when he does yoga, and alustful mistress (kdminl) when he is full of desire. The sage Narada describesSiva:On Kailasa mountain, Siva lives as a naked yogi. His wife ParvatI is the mostbeautiful woman in the universe, capable of bewitching even the best of yogis.Though Siva is the enemy of Kama and is without passion, he is her slave when hemakes love to her.And constantly, in less explicit ways, the two aspects of the god are equated orinterchanged. It is said that Siva is a great yogi, but in his meditation hefixes his mind upon his wife. Devi (the Goddess, who becomes incarnate as Satiand ParvatI) says:Ever since I killed myself, Siva has thought of me constantly, unable to bearhis separation from me. He wanders naked, and has become a yogi, abandoning hispalace, wearing unconventional clothing. Miserable because of me, he hasabandoned the highest pleasure that is born of desire. He is tortured by longingand can find no peace as he wanders everywhere, weeping and behaving like alover in distress.In this passage, the two roles are enacted simultaneously: Siva wears the garbof a yogi, but his behaviour is that of a lover in separation. In fact, he is ayogi because he is a lover. This may be read as a contradiction butpsychologically it is entirely logical. So completely are the roles of asceticand lover combined that the myth-makers themselves often confuse them. The SevenSages say to ParvatI, \"How can you enjoy the pleasures of the body with anascetic [yati] like him, so terrifying and disgusting?\" But in another versionof the same text they say, \"How can you enjoy the pleasures of the body with ahusband [pati] like him, so terrifying and disgusting? The sense remains thesame in both readings, for the two roles are being compared and in factinterchanged.The Pine Forest sages say, \"If we have served Siva from our birth with tapas[asceticism], then let the lihga of this libertine [Siva in disguise] fall tothe earth.\" Thus they swear by Siva the ascetic in order to destroy Siva theerotic, not realizing that the two are one. This dualism is implicit in otherversions of the Pine Forest myth as well, for the sages use the tapas of Siva(their fiery curse) against the lust of Siva (his lihga), and they must betaught the unity of the two powers. The contrasting aspects of Siva are artfullycombined in a late poem of praise which invokes him first as the three-eyed god(ascetic, the third eye having burnt Kama), then as the clever dancer (erotic),then as the wandering beggar (ambiguous, as in the Pine Forest), then as therider on the bull (erotic), the poison-eater (ascetic), and finally as the godwhose lihga is worshipped by yoga (ambiguous).For the yogi himself, using Siva as his model, the god might appear in eitheraspect according to the worshipper's need: \"The yogi who thinks of Siva asdevoid of passion himself enjoys freedom from passion. The yogi who meditatesupon Siva as full of passion himself will certainly enjoy passion.\" Nor was thischoice limited to the initiated; a popular hymn to Siva in Orissa says, \"He isthe much beloved husband of Gauri [Parvatl] and the only object of adoration bythe ascetic.\" This dualism is taken for granted even in a modern English novelbased upon the Siva myth:Siva . . . had two simultaneous identities. There was Siva austere on theHimalaya, rambling down granite causeways . . . and yet at the same time a youngbuck around town, boyish, eager, with a shock of black hair over his eyes, and agirl on either arm. For it is possible \"to comprehend flowering and fadingsimultaneously . . .\"Thus it would seem that this ambiguity has been comprehended and accepted by menof various ages and beliefs, notwithstanding its apparent logical contradictionand the difficulties which arise when its implications are literally applied toan actual or mythological social situation.The Iconic Resolution of the Paradox: The Ithyphallic YogiIn many texts, Siva is said to be ithyphallic (with an erect phallus), an imagewhich would certainly seem to be unambiguous sexually but for its particularlyHindu connotations, which tie it to the world of asceticism as strongly as it isnaturally related to the realm of eroticism. Of all the characteristics of Siva,this is perhaps the most basically iconic; images and paintings of Sivafrequently incorporate aspects described in the myths, but the image of theerect phallus preceded the myths related about it. The study of the ambiguity ofthe image, therefore, begins with the study of its earliest iconic form.Sir John Marshall noted in the prehistoric Indus Valley civilization a seal onwhich was depicted a male god whom he identified as a prototype of Siva; thegod, seated in a position of yoga, has an exposed, erect phallus. More recently,Sir Mortimer Wheeler has suggested that another Indus Valley figure, the dancingtorso from Harappa, also apparently ithyphallic, may be a prototype of SivaNataraja (Lord of the Dance). So specific an identification of cult cannot bemade with certainty, but there is evidence in the Indus Valley of yogicpractices as wellas of the phallic worship mentioned by the Rg Veda itself as characteristic ofthe enemies of the Aryans. Thus even at this early time there is a connectionbetween the postures of yoga and of sexuality. The interrelation of asceticismand desire in the medieval Puranas, then, cannot be explained by any historicalsynthesis, but must be accepted as a unified concept which has been central toIndian thought from prehistoric times.Ithyphallic images are as early as any Siva images, and the Gudimallam lihga, anerect phallus on which an image of Siva is carved, has been called the earliestknown Hindu sculpture. Many images of ithyphallic yogis represent Lakulisa (\"TheLord of the Club\"), an incarnation of Siva. Siva mounted upon his bull should beithyphallic, according to one textbook of aesthetics, and \"the end of thephallus must reach the limit of the navel.\" Similarly, Siva is ithyphallic asNataraja, as the androgyne, and frequently when sitting in a yogic posturebeside Parvati, whose hand sometimes touches his erect phallus. Even Ganesa, theson of Siva, has the urdhvalihga (erect phallus) when he dances the dance ofdeath (tandava) in imitation of his father. It has been suggested that severalof the bearded figures portrayed on the Saiva temples at Khajuraho are yogisparticipating in ritual orgies, and that some of their more convoluted posesrepresent \"sexo-yogic\" attitudes or esoteric yogic asanas (postures). If thisinterpretation is accepted, the domain of the ithyphallic yogi is widelyextended, even within purely Saiva limits.The ambiguity of ithyphallicism is possible because, although the erect phallusis of course a sign of priapism, in Indian culture it is a symbol of chastity aswell. Siva is described as ithyphallic, particularly in the Pine Forest, andthis condition is often equated with a state of chastity. \"He is calledurdhvalihga because the lowered lihga sheds its seed, but not the raised lihga\"The basic Sanskrit expression for the practice of chastity is the drawing up ofthe seed (urdhvaretas), but, by synecdoche, the seed is often confused with thelihga itself, which is \"raised\" in chastity. The raised seed is a natural imageof chastity; only Parvati can transform Siva from one whose seed is drawn upinto one whose seed has fallen. His seed \"falls\" when he begets Skanda, yet heis described as urdhvaretas even at the moment when he gives Agni his seed. Thecommentator glosses this term as urdhvagamiviryah, \"with his seed movingupwards,\" which may describe either the drawing up of the seed in chastity orthe motion of the seed shed in the absence of chastity. Thus Siva is both thegod whose seed is raised up and the god whose lihga is raised up. Even withoutthis confusion, the image of the erect phallus is in itself accepted asrepresentative of chastity. When the seed is drawn up, Siva is a pillar (sthanu)of chastity, yet the pillar is also the form of the erect lihga: \"It is in thisform of the Lord of Yogins that he becomes Sthanu or of lihga form.\" Since, inthe context of the Hindu attitude toward sexual powers, Siva's chastity is hispower of eroticism, the erect phallus can represent both phases:In many of his icons he [Siva] is ithyphallic; often he appears with hisconsort. At the same time he is the patron deity of yogis. . . . This is notinconsistent with his sexual vitality. For the source of the yogi's power is hisown divine sexuality, conserved and concentrated by asceticism.The ithyphallic condition has been attributed by some not to priapism but to theTantric ritual of seminal retention. To a certain extent, this technique may beconsidered a manifestation of yogic chastity, but Siva's raised lihga issymbolic of the power to spill the seed as well as to retain it.Shiva, the god of eroticism, is also the master of the method by which thevirile force may be sublimated and transformed into a mental force, anintellectual power. This method is called Yoga, and Shiva is the great yogi, thefounder of Yoga. We see him represented as an ithyphallic yogi. . . . Assumingthe various postures of Yoga, Shiva creates the different varieties of beings. .. . Then in the posture of realisation (siddhdsana) he reintegrates into himselfall the universe which he has created. It is in this posture that he is mostoften represented. His erect phallus is swollen with all the potentialities offuture creations.The yogi here gathers up his creative powers, retaining the promise ofprocreation in the form of the erect phallus, the embodiment of creative tapas.The raised lihga is the plastic expression of the belief that love and death,ecstasy and asceticism, are basically related.For the image retains its primary, more natural significance; it may symbolizeactual, as well as potential or sublimated eroticism. This is clear from thestatues of the ithyphallic Siva embraced by Parvati. The wives of the PineForest sages touch Siva's erect phallus, which is adorned with red chalk andbright white charcoal or with many bracelets, the latter a characteristic towhich Daksa particularly objects. In a tribal myth it is said that a woman foundan amputated phallus, and, \"thinking it to be Mahadeo's [Siva's] lihga, took ithome and worshipped it. At night she used to take it to bed with her and use itfor her pleasure.\" In a similar manner, a female figure carved on the temple atKonarak is obviously using a stone Siva-lihga as a dildo, an act which seems tobe explicitly prohibited in the lawbooks. In a variant of the episode in whichSiva tempts Parvati to abandon her tapas, he sends a flood to wash away the sandlihga which she is worshipping, and she protects the lihga by embracing it andsmothering it with her breasts. Here lihga worship replaces the usual episode oftapas with an image of unmistakable eroticism. In this way, the image of theithyphallic yogi, simultaneously representative of chastity and sexuality,retains its ambiguities in myth, icon, and cult.PROBLEMS AND METHODSThe paradox thus clearly represented in Indian art and explicitly discussed inphilosophical texts also underlies the great corpus of Saiva mythology, whichcombines the image and the idea. When this central pivot is selected, it ispossible to balance the subsidiary themes around it in such a way that theybecome mutually illuminating. At this point we must reconsider the problem ofmythological analysis.Various Methods of Mythological AnalysisJust as there are many meanings in a myth, many themes that may be extracted, sothere are many theories of interpretation that have been or might be applied toHindu myths: There is the nature interpretation of the nineteenth-century Germanschool (Rudra is the storm; Brahma's daughter is the dawn), and, in reaction tothis oversimplification, the school which \"tried to reduce the meaning of mythsto a moralizing comment on the situation of mankind\" (Rudra is death, Kama islove). There is the metaphysical interpretation of the Hindu theologians (Indrais the soul; the gods are the objects of the senses) and the ritualinterpretation of the Hindu priests (Daksa is the sacrificial goat) and ofcertain anthropologists (Daksa's goat-head is the totemistic symbol of theclan). There is the Euhemerist or historical theory, often favoured by Hindus asit lends a 'scientific' air to tales once scoffed at by Europeans (the battlebetween Indra and the serpent Vrtra represents the Aryan conquest of Naga tribesin 1500 B.C.), and the related Marxist view (the battle represents thesupplanting of an agrarian economy by a martial proletariat). There is theetiological method (the myth explains why the eclipse of the moon takes place);the psychological interpretations of Freud, Jung, and Rank; the comparativemythology of Sir James Frazer; Stith Thompson's attempt to index the entirespectrum of world-wide mythological and folk motifs; the structural methods ofVladimir Propp and Levi-Strauss; and the text-historical method, which'explains' a myth by finding its earliest known sources.The text-historical method is the one which has been most frequently applied toIndian mythology. Scholars attempted to discount apparently incongruous elementsof a myth by tracing them back to originally unrelated \"Ur-texts\"; thepersistence of such elements in an inappropriate context in the later myth wasthus attributed to an accidental historical conflation of several myths. If, onthe other hand, these elements could not be found in any C/r-text, they wereignored as modern accretions, irrelevant to the analysis of the 'essential'myth. This technique is generally unrewarding when applied to the Sanskritsources, which are extremely difficult to date with any accuracy, and MadeleineBiardeau has commented on the unsuitability of the text-historical approach toPurana material of this nature: \"The approach of historical philology will neverbe suitable for an oral tradition, which has no essential reference to itshistorical origin.\" Moreover, the historical method is misleading even when itsucceeds; for the question to ask is not where the disparate elementsoriginated, but why they were put together, and why kept together. It is whenthe combination seems most contradictory and arbitrary that it is most rewardingto analyse it as a combination—for only a strong emotional bond can bridge awide logical gap. Levi-Strauss uses the image of the hricoleur, the handyman whouses whatever tools and scraps are at hand, to describe the method of themyth-maker who uses pre-constrained images and actions. The interesting questionis not where the tools came from but why the hricoleur persists in combiningcertain tools in certain ways once he has them. One of the first Europeans tostudy Indian mythology complained, \"Hindu mythology is . . . very confused andcontradictory,and almost any two things may be mythologically assimilated,\" but this is nottrue. Only those things are persistently assimilated which have some basicrelationship in the Hindu view.For these reasons, among others, the structuralists have rejected thetext-historical emphasis on chronology, and Levi-Strauss treats all versions ofa myth, including what are usually called interpretations, as equally relevantor authentic. I have used \"versions\" of the Siva myths written by modern Hinduauthors (R. K. Narayan, Nirad Chaudhuri), eighteenth-century European scholars,and even one contemporary Western novelist (David Stacton). As Mary Douglas hasremarked of this technique, \"This challenging idea is not merely for the fun ofshocking the bourgeois mythologist out of his search for original versions.\" TheHindu myths are part of an oral tradition extending through thousands of years.No one teller of a myth would include all the details that he might have known,and so a later version may express an idea which has been current in thetradition for a long time. Sometimes quite late versions make explicit what ispresent in an obscure form in a very early version: \"These later sequences areorganized in schemata which are at the same time homologous to those which havebeen described and more explicit than them.\" Even when later versions seem tocontradict earlier ones, the pattern of the earlier myth will often persist. Inmany cases the explicit meaning of the myth will contradict the pattern whichcomparison with other versions will reveal in it; in such instances, the patternis usually more basic to the myth than the superficial meaning. Similarly, theexplicit intention of a character may contradict his actual behaviour, andcomparison with other versions usually reveals the action to be older than theintention. In this way the new wine of later versions will often reveal theshape of the old bottles, and all variants may be considered on an equal basis.Thus the text-historical method is of limited value in determining the patternof the myth as a whole. It is, however, extremely useful in illuminating theindividual elements of that pattern, the themes and motifs. For example, noVedic \"C/r-text\" exists to clarify the episode in which Agni interrupts Siva'slove-play in order to take away Siva's seed. However, once having isolated thesignificant motifs by means of a number of modern variants, having establishedthat Agni usually assumes the form of a bird to steal the seed, we may then cometo understand the motif better in the light of the history of the Vedicsymbolism of the bird and the seed.I have followed a modified text-historical method in tracing the historicalbackgrounds of the Siva myths in the Vedas and Epics and the subsequentdevelopment of the motifs within the Purana myths. The reader may trace thehistory of each motif through the citations in the index of motifs, bearing inmind the fact that, although it is impossible to 'date' any particular Puranictext, it is reasonable to postulate several broad areas of Indian mythology: RgVeda (c. 1200 B.C.), Brahmanas and Atharva Veda (900 B.C.), Upanisads (700B.C.), Mahabharata (300 B.C.-a.d. 300), Ramdyana (200 b.c.-a.d. 200), earlyPuranas (Brahmanda, Mdrkandeya, Matsya, Vayu, and Visrai, 300 b.c.-a.d. 500),middle Puranas (Kurma, Lihga, Vamana, Varaha, Agni, Bhagavata, Brahmavaivarta,Saura, Skanda, and Devi, A. D.500-1000), late Puranas (all others, a.d.1000-1500), andmmodern Hindu texts. In analysing the meaning of the myths as a whole, however, Ihave ignored chronology.Almost every one of the traditional methods is applicable to some portion ofsome myth, though none can explain them all:There is some truth in almost all theories—as that is primitive philosophy orscience, that its inner meaning is sexual, agricultural or astrological, that itis a projection of unconscious psychic events, and that it is a consciouslyconstructed system of allegories and parables. No one of these theories accountsfor all myths, and yet I do not doubt that each accounts for some.The mythologist, like the myth-maker himself, cannot be too proud to acceptdiverse scraps from dubious sources. It is interesting to take note of Freudianovertones in analysing certain parts of the Hindu cycle, such as the castrationmyths; Levi-Strauss himself, though objecting to the widespread Jungianinterpretation of mythological functions in absolute terms, nevertheless(according to Edmund Leach) assumes that a myth is a kind of collective dreamexpressing unconscious wishes. Similarly, one need not stubbornly refuse theassistance of the ritualists in analysing other myths (such as the destructionof Daksa's sacrifice). Each has its place."},{"pageContent":"It may seem perverse to ignore the work of Frazer when analysing myths withobvious parallels in other cultures (such as the myth of primeval incest, or theandrogyne), yet I have done so almost without exception. There seems littlepoint in drawing attention to the parallels in primitive or Greek myths; readerswho are familiar with those materials may draw their own parallels, while toothers such comparisons would be cumbersome and meaningless. Only in a fewparticularly striking and obscure cases have I indicated the correlations, wherethese might help to elucidate the Hindu meaning of the myth. I had originallyplanned to key my entire analysis to Stith Thompson's index of world folkloremotifs, in order to enable folklorists to identify motifs of other cultures, butI soon abandoned this plan when I discovered that, even on a superficial level,well over a thousand motifs of his index occurred in my material. A more seriousobjection, however, lay in the misleading nature of this use of the index, for agreat many of these motifs were in fact cited by Thompson as known only fromIndian folklore; thus a list of motifs from my corpus which appeared in theThompson index would often suggest, wrongly, that a motif of purely Indianoccurrence was a \"world-wide\" motif. The final objection, however, was one ofbasic method and philosophy: such a random and minute identification of motifsadded nothing to one's understanding of the myths. As Levi-Strauss has oftenpointed out, the motifs mean nothing in any abstract sense until they are placedin the context of the myth, in a structural relationship with other motifs.The prevalence of certain of the Saiva motifs—such as fire and water—innon-Indian cultures obviates the possibility of explaining them only in terms ofIndian beliefs. But patterns within the Indian context reveal a particularmeaning that the motifs do not have in any other cultures and may even serve toclarify some meanings in those cultures. In general, it seems to rne that theuniversalelements of the myth are precisely the least important elements, that the pointof the myth is to be sought in those areas in which the Hindu myth diverges fromthe general pattern. Betty Heimann has expressed this opinion:India can only be explained through its own nature. . . . Seeminglycorresponding details that invite comparison are essentially unrelated as theysprang from different sources, and their seeming similarity is actuallyincidental, a common basis being lacking.Even Levi-Strauss has granted that a myth can be properly analysed only in thecontext of the culture of the listeners and tellers:I claim the right to make use of any manifestation of the mental or socialactivities of the communities under consideration which seem likely to allow me,as the analysis proceeds, to complete or explain the myth. . . . You cannot makemythology understood by somebody of a different culture without teaching him therules and particular traditions of that culture.Indeed, purely structural, Levi-Strauss-inspired analyses of Indian tribalmythology have yielded interesting results; the authors have tried to relatethese myths to the Hindu ritual materials at their disposal, but had they beenable to make use of the full range of Sanskrit myths upon which the tribalstories are based, their conclusions might have been more subtle, if notnecessarily more sound.The validity of the method of analysis utilizing non-mythological materials forbackground is further supported by the manner in which characters within themyths actually cite Hindu lawbooks and philosophical works; the student of themyth seems justified in emulating their example. Once the Hindu myths have beenset forth and analysed in their own right, it is possible to use them as thebasis of more universal theories of myth, proceeding from the particular to thegeneral, just as the general theories serve to illuminate the particular myths.Yet the myth cannot be explained by ethnography alone, for if this were so, themyth could not add anything to the knowledge available in the ethnography.Moreover, the ambiguous relationship between myth and reality (the fact that themyth sometimes expresses a real situation by describing the reversal of actualconditions) produces yet another logical circle, for \"ethnographic observationmust decide whether the image [of a myth] corresponds to the facts.\" For thesereasons, ethnographic commentary, though necessary, is not sufficient, nor is itable to compensate for certain shortcomings of the structural approach: \"We soonfind that the ethnographic commentary merely underlines even more sharply thoseaspects of the myth which cannot be further interpreted by this 'semanticprocedure'.\"Variants and MultiformeThe main source of explanatory material for any myth is not in ethnography butin other related myths: \"A myth derives its significance not from contemporaryor archaic institutions of which it is a reflection, but from its relation toother myths within a transformation group.\" A myth must be analysed in terms ofitsrelationship to the \"total myth structure\" of the culture: \"Each myth takenseparately exists as the limited application of a pattern, which is graduallyrevealed by the relation of reciprocal intelligibility discerned between severalmyths.\" This theory is particularly well adapted to the variants of Hindu myths:The orthodox Hindu consciousness has always found it . . . easy to accept widevariations in the texts. Any scientific study should first of all preserve thesevariations and determine the kind of socio-religious idea they conveyed topeople.The latent structure of the myths can only be grasped by working through a largecorpus of myths which express in many different ways certain similarities ofstructure, the repetition itself emphasizing the form behind the slightvariations. \"The ultimate conclusion of the analysis is not that 'all the mythssay the same thing' but that 'collectively the sum of what all the myths say isnot expressly said by any of them.\" Thus each myth within the cycle is a variantof every other myth.The very delimitations of the episodes and symbols can only be identified by thecomparison of several versions: integral units are those which appear in oneversion but not in another, on the principle of minimal pairs. As in algebra,the more terms (characters, episodes, symbols) involved in a myth, the more\"equations\" (variant myths) required to isolate the terms:Divergence of sequences and themes is a fundamental characteristic ofmythological thought, which manifests itself as an irradiation; by measuring thedirections and angles of the rays, we are led to postulate their common origin,as an ideal point on which those deflected by the structure of the myth wouldhave converged had they not started, precisely, from some other point andremained parallel throughout their entire course.The Saiva myths involve many terms, and many permutations of each, so thatliterally hundreds of myths, all interrelated through their mutual charactersand episodes, are required to elucidate even a relatively short sequence.Moreover, one version may explain a particular element that is unclear inanother:If one aspect of a particular myth seems unintelligible, it can be legitimatelydealt with, in the preliminary stage and on the hypothetical level, as atransformation of the homologous aspect of another myth, which has been linkedwith the same group for the sake of argument, and which lends itself morereadily to interpretation.Biardeau has applied this method to Hindu mythology, with considerablesuccess:As our text sheds very little light on this point, we may look for some similarstories where the symbolic meaning would be made more explicit. What appears tomany people as an unmanageable overgrowth of myths in epics and puranas isactually an invaluable source of information for a betterunderstanding of each of them. . . . The regional variants are all authentic aslong as the overall significance of the epic remains. . . . The major variationsin the text are likely each to have its own significance fitting into the whole.This technique employed by the mythologist is justified by the theory that it issimply the mirror image of the technique employed by the myth-maker in the firstplace. Leach compares a myth with a message transmitted over a great distance(in time and space) and therefore repeated several times, with differentwordings, so that when the different versions are reunited \"the mutualconsistencies and inconsistencies will make it quite clear what is 'really'being said.\" The mythologist is merely reassembling what the culture as a wholehas fragmented.Repetition enables the mythologist not only to separate the discrete units butto distinguish the more important elements from the trivial. The essentialthemes in a myth, impossible to identify from a simple reading of one version,emerge upon consideration of a number of other versions of that myth in which,despite various changes and reversals, certain elements persist. What isimportant is what is repeated, reworked to fit different circumstances,transformed even to the point of apparent meaninglessness, but always retained.In this way an element which occupies a relatively small part of a particularmyth may be shown, in the context of the mythology as a whole, to be at theheart of that myth.Multiple variants have a special importance in the analysis of myths which, likethe Saiva cycle, deal with contradictions. Myths which contain an insolubleproblem are particularly prone to proliferate into many versions, each strivingtoward an infinitely distant solution, no one version able to confess itsfailure outright. The perplexing point, the crux, is constantly reworked in avain attempt to find an emotional or logical resolution. This is apparent on thesimple linguistic level as well, where false readings, alternative phrases, andblatantly corrupt or incorrect Sanskrit terms betray a point which themyth-maker did not himself understand but was unwilling to omit altogether,knowing it to be somehow essential.For all of the foregoing reasons, it should be clear why it was necessary toinclude what may at first glance appear to be an overwhelming number of almostidentical versions of certain myths. In the first place, they are not identical,and it is the seemingly insignificant minor variation that holds the key to theisolation of a motif, which in turn contributes to the final reconstruction ofthe total symbolism of the cycle. Every version adds an essential detail, thesignificance of which only becomes apparent when the entire cycle has beenanalysed.The use of multiple variants, and the analogy of an imperfectly transmittedmessage, are supported by the irrefutable evidence that the ancient Hindumyth-makers were in fact well aware of the existence of these variants. Althoughit is possible that no one person knew all the versions of a particular myth (atheoretically infinite amount of material), it is likely that each author wasacquainted with at least more than one version, and consciousness of thesevariants is demonstrated explicitly from time to time in the Puranas. Many mythsare cited by characters within other myths or by the Pauranika (the bardreciting the Purana) as apt examples or parallel situations. A frequent deviceused to accom-modate multiple versions of a myth is the reference to multiple aeons of cosmicdevelopment. The seven variants of the birth of the Maruts describe how in sevenformer eras the Maruts were born, each time in a different way; a similar seriesof different versions of the birth of Rudra, in different eras, is narrated inanother text. One passage refers explicitly to this technique: \"Because of thedistinction between eras, the birth of Ganesa is described in different ways.\"Another text reveals an even more overt awareness of the use of this technique:the bard recites a myth in which a sage forgives his enemies; the audience theninterrupts, saying, \"We heard it told differently. Let us tell you: the sagecursed them in anger. Explain this.\" The bard then replies, \"That is true, butit happened in a different era. I will tell you.\" And he narrates the secondversion of the myth. Similar references are often made to incidents occurring ina series of incarnations.In addition to these, there are frequent variations of a different sort within asingle myth, where an entire episode is told and then retold in a slightlydifferent form as an expansion of the original theme, producing a series ofmultiforms similar to the multiforms of episodes in different myths. Leach haspointed out the redundancies of this type in the Bible:It is common to all mythological systems that all important stories recur inseveral different versions. Man is created in Genesis (chapter I, verse 27) andthen he is created all over again (II, 7). And, as if two first men were notenough, we also have Noah in chapter VIII. Likewise in the New Testament, whymust there be four gospels each telling \"the same\" story yet sometimes flatlycontradictory on details of fact? ... As a result of redundancy, the believercan feel that, even when the details vary, each alternative version of a mythconfirms his understanding and reinforces the essential meaning of all theothers.This is a common artifice used in the composition of oral poetry, and it isappropriate to the rather florid style of the Puranas, which tend constantly toincorporate additional details and incidental material. In this way, forexample, one Pauranika was forced to invent an elaborate episode to act as abridge in order to include two different versions of the way in which Parvatiaccumulated her ascetic power (tapas): after narrating the first version, thePurana states that Siva then appeared in the form of a water demon andthreatened to devour a small child unless Parvati transferred her tapas to him;Parvati agreed and then had to start all over again to accumulate her tapas;(there then follows the second version, which the Pauranika was loath to omit).A similar example of multiforms within the myth may be seen in a version of thePine Forest story which distributes three different variants of the visit ofSiva to the forest in three different visits, each incorporating certain newdetails. One Purana gives two multiforms of the birth of Skanda from Siva'sseed, one following immediately after the other but transferred from Skanda toGanesa, Siva's other son; another Purana gives two different versions of thestory of Jalandhara, one clearly conscious of the other.By comparing these variants and multiforms it is possible to isolate the basicthemes and motifs out of which further versions, when and if they might befound or created, would be built as well, for the number of possibilities isinfinite. The so-called repetitions are never exactly the same; beneath theapparent symmetry of structure is a fluctuation of detail, like the variationsin a Persian carpet. We never reach a point when 'all the variants' have beenconsidered, yet we may establish a reasonably complete basic vocabulary:There is no real end to mythological analysis, no hidden unity to be graspedonce the breaking-down process has been completed. Themes can be split up adinfinitum. Just when you think you have disentangled and separated them, yourealize that they are knitting together again in response to the operation ofunexpected affinities.This resistance against logical fragmentation leads the mythologist from onevariant to another. \"Myths are translations of one another, and the only way youcan understand a myth is to show how a translation of it is offered by adifferent myth.\" The final \"reconstruction\" of the myth, once it has beendissected into some of its components, is simply a re-reading of the corpus interms of these basic units. Thus I have constructed a chart of the basic motifs(see below), arranged according to the levels on which they occur (motifs ofstructure, symbolic motifs, ascetic/erotic motifs, and motifs of theinterrelationships of Siva with other characters), and reintroduced these motifs(designated by number) in the margins of all the myths I have cited. Moreover,after treating the component motifs as they occur in the principle myths of theSiva cycle, I have discussed more general themes of function and structure whichapply to the mythology on a broader scale.There are many myths dealing with each theme, and many themes within each myth.There is no way to begin with any \"basic\" myth or any 'basic' theme, for theentire corpus interlocks and feeds back so that the total fabric resembles apiece of chain-mail rather than the brachiated, family-tree structure sought bythe text-historical analysts and some structuralists. I have, therefore,selected certain myths best suited to illustrate certain motifs, whileindicating in the margin other motifs which also occur therein. At some pointthe reader will have to re-read myths cited before their component motifs havebeen discussed; the chicken must precede the egg, and vice versa.The final \"explanation\" of the myth cycle is thus the cycle itself, reread witha richer awareness of at least some of the resonances and harmonies behind theflickering images. It is to be hoped that the reader will not be disappointedwith this 'explanation,' but rather, as Levi-Strauss suggests,will find himself carried toward that music which is to be found in myth andwhich, in the complete versions, is preserved not only with its harmony andrhythm but also with that hidden significance that I have sought so laboriouslyto bring to light, at the risk of depriving it of the power and majesty thatcause such a violent emotional response when it is experienced in its originalstate, hidden away in the depths of a forest of images and signs and still freshwith a bewitching enchantment, since in that form at least nobody can claim tounderstand it.The present analysis has been patched up and amended and revised in successiveincarnations until it became obvious that, unchecked, it would continue togenerate new variants, like a myth itself, \"until the final deluge,\" as theHindus say. Paul Valery once wrote that a poem is never finished; it is merelyabandoned. Perhaps this is also true of any work of research in the arts;certainly it is true of any analysis of a body of mythology. For my part, I havehad to force myself to abandon this opus for the moment; but it is of courseunfinished.Hindu Myths: A SourcebookTranslated from the SanskritWENDY DONIGER O'FLAHERTYThe selection that follows is from a collection of essays by Professor Doniger OFlaherty, compiled to illustrate the wealth of Hindu myths. The subtle themes oferoticism and asceticism are here cast against the background of the universe sfertility, with its consequences of life, death, and rebirth, for which Shiva isthe antidote, the symbol of the highest god, or of the universal principle ofbeing beyond all forms.FROM THE VAMANA PURANA1 he twice-born sage Marikanaka, the mind-born son of Kasyapa, set out to bathein his bark garment, and the celestial nymphs, Rambha and the others, who werepleasing to look upon, shining, affectionate, and flawless, bathed there withhim. Then the sage, whose ascetic power was great, became excited and shed hisseed in the water; he collected that seed in a pot, where it became divided intoseven parts, from which were born seven sages who are known as the bands of theMaruts: Wind-speed, Wind-force, Wind-destroyer, Wind-circle, Wind-flame,Wind-seed, and Wind-disc, whose heroic power is great. These seven sons of theseer support the universe, moving and still.Once, long ago, the Siddha Marikanaka was wounded in the hand by the tip of ablade ofkusa grass, and plan; sap flowed from that wound—so I have heard. Whenhe saw the plant sap, he was filled with joy, and he started to dance; and theneverything that was moving or still started to dance; the universe started todance, for it was bewitched by his energy. When Brahma and the other gods andthe sages rich in ascetic power saw this, they reported to the great god Sivaabout the sage: \"You should do something so that he does not dance, O god.\" Whenthe Great God saw that the sage was filled with joy to excess, he spoke to himfor thesake of the welfare of the gods, saying, \"Best of twice-born sages, what is thereason that has occasioned this joy in you who are an ascetic stationed on thepath of dharma?\" \"Why, brahmin,\" said the sage, \"do you not see the plant sapflowing from my hand? When I saw it I began to dance with joy.\"The god laughed at the sage who was deluded by passion, and he said to him, \"Iam not amazed, priest. Look at this,\" and when Bhava, the god of gods, of greatlustre, had said this to the eminent sage, he struck his own thumb with the tipof his finger, and from that wound ashes shining like snow came forth. When thepriest saw this he was ashamed, and he fell at Siva's feet and said, \"I thinkthat you are none other than the noble god who holds the trident in his hand,the best in the universe moving and still, the Trident-bearer. Brahma and theother gods appear to be dependent upon you, faultless one. You are the first ofthe gods, the great one who acts and causes others to act. By your grace all thegods rejoice and fear nothing.\" When the sage had thus praised the great god, hebowed and said, \"O lord, by your favour let my ascetic power not be destroyed.\"Then the god was pleased, and he answered the sage, \"Your ascetic power willincrease a thousand-fold by my favour, O priest, and I will dwell in thishermitage with you for ever. Any man who bathes in the Saptasarasvata andworships me will find nothing impossible to obtain in this world and in theother world, but he will certainly go to the Sarasvata world and, by the graceof Siva, he will obtain the highest place.\"Unit VIThe Way toEnlightenment:BuddhismHinayana and MahayanaHEINRICH ZIMMERIn this selection, Heinrich Zimmer examines the characteristic differencebetween the Hinayana (or Theravada) and the Mahayana. The development ofBuddhist thought in this exposition rests upon the problem created by theBuddha's assertion that there is no soul (anatta). The Buddhist metaphysiciansof Hinayana and Mahayana had to translate that assertion into an explanationthat would fit all the cases of human experience of self mind, and Nirvana. Thesplits between Hinayana and Mahayana reflected the disagreements that arose inthe attempt to interpret the meaning of \"no soul.\" All Buddhists, however, agreethat the goal of existence is the cessation of dukkha or suffering to reachemancipation or Nirvana. Geographical distance as well as disagreements onphilosophical points have kept the two expressions of Buddhism apart.1 he village life of India was little modified by the rise and fall of thedynasties. The conquerors—even the complacent Greeks—soon recognized the virtuesof the native way of being civilized. Alexander took to himself, as guru, theJaina saint Kalanos, whom he invited to fill the vacancy of his old boyhoodtutor Aristotle; while under the Kusana warrior-kings both Buddhist art andBuddhist philosophy moved into a new and richly documented period. TheHellenistic Buddhist sculpture of Gandhara, as well as the more spiritual andvigorous contemporary native Jaina and Buddhist art of Mathura, gives ampleevidence that under the protection of their foreign overlords the Indianreligious systems were continuing to evolve. And we have the testimony oftradition for the statement that at the great Buddhist council assembled byKaniska (the \"Fourth Buddhist Council,\" held according to some reports atJalandhar in the eastern Punjab, according to others at Kundalavana in Kashmir),the representatives of no less than eighteen Buddhist sects were in attendance.The authenticity of the reports of this council has been questioned.Nevertheless it is obvious from many trains of evidence that a critical shift ofweight took place in Buddhist teachings about this time. The religious practicesof bhakti, which were already evident in the popular art and royal edicts ofAsoka's reign, began to receive the mature support of Buddhist philosophers. Acanonical Buddhist literature in Sanskrit (no longer Pali, the language of theearlier canon treasured in Ceylon) dating from the period of Kaniska stands forthe view (already represented in Buddhist popular art) that the Buddha is to bereverenced as a divine being, and furthermore that numerous Buddhas (Buddhas ofthe past, Buddhas of the future) assist the devotee in his attempt to realizethe Buddhahood latent within him. For whereas the earlier orthodox view had rep-HlNAYANA AND MAHAYANA 197resented individual enlightenment (arhatship) as the goal to be attained, andthis only by means of a literal imitation of the rigorous world-renunciation ofthe historical princely monk, Gautama Sakyamuni, the newer teaching was thatBuddhahood (the status of a World Redeemer) is mans proper end, and furthermorethat since all things in reality are Buddha-things, all things potentially andactually are Saviors of the World.\"It is as if a certain man went away from his father and betook himself to someother place. He lives there in foreign parts for many years, twenty or thirty orforty or fifty. In the course of time the father becomes a great man, but theson is poor; seeking a livelihood, he roams in all directions.\" The father isunhappy, having no son, but one day, while sitting at the gate of his palacetransacting great affairs, he beholds his son, poor and tattered. The sonthinks: \"Unexpectedly have I here fallen in with a king or grandee. People likeme have nothing to do here; let me go; in the street of the poor I am likely tofind food and clothing without much difficulty. Let me no longer tarry in thisplace, lest I should be taken to do forced labor or should incur some otherinjury.\" The father orders his son brought to him, but, before revealing hisbirth to him, employs him for some years at all kinds of work, first at themeanest kinds, and then at the most important. The father treats his son withpaternal kindness, but the son, although he manages all his father's property,lives in a thatched cottage and believes himself to be poor. At last, when hiseducation is completed, he learns the truth.In the same way we are the sons of the Buddha, and the Buddha says to us today,\"You are my sons.\" But, like the poor man, we had no idea of our dignity, noidea of our mission as future Buddhas. Thus the Buddha has made us reflect oninferior doctrines. We have applied ourselves to them, seeking as payment forour day's work only nirvana, and finding that it is already ours. Meanwhile theBuddha has made us dispensers of the knowledge of the Buddhas, and we havepreached it without desiring it for ourselves. At last, however, the Buddha hasrevealed to us that this knowledge is ours, and that we are Buddhas, likehimself.This is the doctrine that has been termed, somewhat complacently, \"The BigFerryboat\" (mahayana), the ferry in which all may ride, in contrast to \"TheLittle Ferryboat\" (hinayana), the way of those lonely ones, \"lights untothemselves,\" who steer the difficult strait of individual release. The BigFerryboat, with its pantheons of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, prayer-wheels,incense, gongs, and graven images, rosaries and muttered syllables, has beendisparaged generally by modern Occidental critics as a vulgar popularization ofthe Buddha's doctrine furthered by the advent into the northwestern provinces ofbarbaric peoples (not the Greeks, of course, but the Sakas and Yueh-chi), andyet, if anything is clear it is that the entire meaning of the paradox implicitin the very idea of Buddhahood has here come to manifestation. Nagarjuna (c. 200a. d.), the founder of the Madhyamika school of Buddhist philosophy, which isthe supreme statement of the Mahayana view, was by no means a vulgarizer but oneof the subtlest metaphysicians the human race has yet produced. While Asahga andhis brother Vasubandhu (c. 300 A.D.), the developers of the Yogacara school ofthe Mahayana, likewise merit the respect of whatever thinker sets himself thetask of really comprehending their rationalization of Nagarjuna's doctrine ofthe Void.And Asvaghosa, the haughty contemporary of Kaniska (c. 100 A.D.), can have beenno truckler to barbarians, even though his epic of the life of the Buddha,Buddhacarita, is graced with many unmonkish charms.Fa Hsien (c. 400 A.D.). a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim to whom we owe much of ourknowledge of the classic Gupta period, states that he found four Buddhistphilosophic systems fully developed in India. Two of these, the Madhyamika andYogacara, represented the Mahayana, while the others—Vaibhasika andSautrantika—were of the older Hmayana school. Fa Hsien declares that atPataliputra, the ancient capital of King Asoka, the Mahayanists had onemonastery and the Hinayanists another, with some six or seven hundred monksbetween them. His account of the cities further west reveals that at Mathura theBodhisattvas Manjusri and Avalokitesvara received worship as divinities—which isa Mahayana feature. The texts that he brought home with him were of bothpersuasions. And we learn, furthermore, from a second Chinese pilgrim twocenturies later, Hsiian Tsang (629-640), that the two schools were then still incombat with each other. Relations between Buddhism and Hinduism were peaceful,but between the Mahayana and the Hmayana scholastic debate and mutual abuse, onthe verbal level, were at such a pitch that the Buddha himself, had he returned,must certainly have been compelled to cry out piteously, as eleven centuriesbefore: \"The Order is divided! The Order is divided!\"The seeds of the conflict are in the words of the Buddha as recorded in thecanon. The unsystematized epistemological, metaphysical, and psychologicalimplications implicit in the program of spiritual therapy prescribed by himwhose own one-pointedness had carried him beyond the sphere of simpleratiocination rankled in the minds of those still caught in the nets of thought;or one might say perhaps, in the minds of those who had been originally Brahmans(rather than Ksatriyas, like Gautama) and were therefore more disposed than heto adhere to the ways of thought, the way of jiiana, the processes of thinkingproblems through. Many, it is clear, attained Enlightenment; their formulae arenot the vain scrimshaw of unreposeful intellects, but profoundly inspired,original renditions in philosophical terms of the realization promised by theBuddha's cure. Thus we find that just as the Doctrine, when rendered accordingto the dispositions of the bhakta, yielded a Buddhist art of broad popularappeal, so when apprehended by the Brahman intellect, its implications openedinto the most wonderfully subtle systems of metaphysical philosophy. The Wheelof the Law indeed was turning—churning the whole nature of man to newfulfillment. The Mahayana, the big ferryboat, and the Hmayana, the little,whether side by side or far apart, have together carried the millions of theOrient through centuries of transformations, secure in the understanding thatthe Buddha, somehow, in the most intimate, dependable way—no matter what theirpath of approach to him—was their indestructible, all-embracing Refuge.\"The ocean of tears shed by each being, wandering through life after life,without beginning,\" we are told, \"is vaster than the Four Oceans together.\"The bones of the bodies that a man has worn in countless births, when heapedtogether would form a hill far larger than the lofty summits of the mountainsthat strike his eves with awe.\"HlNAYANA AND MAHAYANA 199This is the beginning of the wisdom of release. All life is sorrowful—and thereis no beginning or end to it in this vale of tears; yet how substantial, howdeep, how real, is this universal sorrow?A parable is given in the Pali Stanzas of the Sister Elders. There was a mother,we read, who had lost six children; one remained, a daughter. But eventuallythis child too died, and the mother was disconsolate. The Buddha came to her;and he said: \"Many hundreds of children have we buried, you and I, hosts ofkindred, in the times that are gone. Do not lament for this dear littledaughter; four and eighty thousand with the same name have been burned on thefuneral pyre by you before. Which among them is the one for whom you mourn?\"Obviously, there is here implicit an ontological problem; for in what sense canthe woman with all the children, the man with all the bones, or the being withall the tears be said to have lived through multitudes of lives, if we are toaccept as truth the Buddha's fundamental teaching: \"All things are without aself (an-atta)\"?The philosophers of the Hinayana schools sought to solve the difficulty bycontending that the ego-process consists of a series (santana, santati) ofmoments (ksana) of transient entities (dharmas). There is nothing that abides.Not only are all the particles of being perishable (anitya), but their durationis infini-tesimally short. \"All things are as brief as winks\" (yat sat tatksanikam). Their springing into existence is almost their ceasing to be. Yetthey follow each other in chains of cause and effect that are without beginningand will go on for eternity. These chains, made up of momentary dharmas, arewhat appear to others, and in some cases to themselves also, asindividuals—gods, animals, oceans, men, stones, and trees. Every phenomenalbeing is to be regarded as such a flux of particles that are themselvesephemeral. Throughout the transformations of birth, growth, old age, death, andthe endless chain of rebirths, the so-called individual is no more than thevortex of such a causal sequence—never quite what is was a moment ago or what itis just about to be, and yet not different either. The simile is given of theflame of a lamp. During the first, the middle, and the last watches of thenight, the flame is neither the same flame nor a different flame.Or the simile is given of a bride who was bought from her father by the paymentof the bride price when she was a little girl. The buyer thought that when shegrew up she would become his wife, but he then went forth on a business voyage,and was away for many years. The girl grew up, came to marriageable age and,according to Indian custom, had to be supplied with a husband. The father,coming to a difficult decision, determined to accept a second bride price from asecond suitor, and this man then became the actual husband of the girl.Presently, however, the first returned; and he demanded that the wife, now amature woman, should be returned to him. But the husband replied: \"This womanwhom I have married is not your bride. The little girl of long ago is not thesame as this adult woman who is today my wife.\" And so it is indeed! Throughoutthe series of our existences, bounded by death and birth, just as through thediffering stages of our present biography, we are both identical with and notidentical with ourselves.The problem, that is to say, was resolved in the schools of the Hinayana by theassertion that what are usually taken to be permanent entities do not exist. Allthat can be said to exist—really—are the dharmas: small and brief realities,which, when grouped in aggregates and chains of cause and effect, create animpression of pseudo-individuals. There is no thinker, there is only thought; noone to feel, but only feelings; no actor, but only visible actions. This is adoctrine of phenomenalism, maintaining the nonexistence of substances andindividuals while insisting on the reality of infinitesimal units, of which theworld illusion is said to be compounded. The soul, the individual, is no morethan a complex of momentary entities; and these are the only reality. Nirvana,the attainment of release, therefore, is simply the cessation of the thoughtthat all these phenomenal effects that we behold and feel constitute the realitythat they appear to constitute. The extinction of that wrong idea—which is theleading thought and error of our lives—breaks off the entrainment of falselygrounded hopes and anxieties, life-plans, desires, and resentments. The arhat,the enlightened one, is simply a vortex no longer deluded about itself or aboutthe phenomenality of other names and forms: in him knowledge concerning theconditions of phenomenality has released what once regarded itself as an entityfrom the consequences of the general delusion. But as to what more might be saidabout nirvana—this is something the Hinayana philosopher does not attempt toface. The term nirvana is by him treated strictly as a negative; for as apositive it would fall immediately under the ban of his basic formula, yat sattat ksanikam: whatever is, is momentary—like a wink.The once extremely widespread Hinayana group known as Sarvastivadins, or\"realists\" (sarva, \"all\"; asti, \"exist\"; vada, \"saying\"), distinguishseventy-five dharmas, or \"categories,\" under which, as they declare, everythought and form of being can be comprised. All are \"real with regard to theirsubstance\" (dra-vyato santi); i.e., all exist as substance even though asephemeral manifestations they are ever-changing and utterly perishable. Theyexist in a continuous series of births, durations, and destructions, whichterminates when true knowledge puts an end to the restless movements of thiscontingent process, dissolving it in the quietness of extinction (nirvana). Thistheory marked the climax of the earlier Hinayana, and supplied the basis for thespeculations of the later Hinayana schools.The question as to how suffering can be experienced in this world when there areno egos in which the suffering comes to pass, is answered by the thinkers of thelater schools in different ways. The Sautrantikas, for example, attempt toexplain the situation in terms of their basic contention that our processes ofthought do not represent a direct picture of external reality but follow eachother in a thought series of their own—under pressure, as it were, from without,but otherwise autonomously. On the basis of our internal experiences it is to beinferred that external objects exist; yet this does not mean that those objectscorrespond in character to the internal thoughts generated under theirinfluence. There is no chain of causation from outside to inside by which thesuffering is produced that is felt within. The pains of hell, delights ofheaven, and mixed blessings of the world, are all equally thoughts, broughtabout by precedent mental causes, not by outer facts, each chain of thoughtsrepresenting theHlNAYANA AND MAHAYANA 201force—more or less enduring—of a particular kind of ignorance or enthrall-ment.What imagines itself to be a suffering ego is only the continuity of thesuffering itself. The continuous sequence of similar mental dharmas goes onsimply as a reflex of its own imperfection.The Vaibhasikas, on the other hand, object to this doctrine as \"contradictorychatter\" (viruddhd bhasa). They regard it as absurd to speak of inferences aboutthe outer world on the basis of a thought series not in touch with it. For them,the world is open to direct perception. Occasionally, external objects may beknown to exist by inference, but as a rule perception is what reveals to ustheir existence. Hence the objects of experience are of two kinds: 1. sensibleor perceived and 2. cogitable or inferred. The laws that govern the causalsequences in these two realms are different, and yet the two interact upon eachother. Suffering, for example, represents an actual impingement of the outerworld upon the world within, even though the normal inference that an enduringindividual is what is undergoing the ordeal is a thought without basis in fact.For whatever the mental stream presents as external does indeed existwithout—though not in the mode of substances and enduring entities, as isgenerally inferred.According to both of these late Hlnayana schools of reasoning, the aggregates ofexperience—whether external or internal—are ephemeral yet real. In the Mahayana,on the other hand, they are not even real. A metaphysical substratum of allphenomenality is admitted, but the entire sphere of phenome-nality itself(whether mental or physical, inferential or perceived, long-enduring or ofbriefest moment) is regarded as without substance. The philosophers of theMahayana liken the universe to a magical display, a mirage, a flash oflightning, or the ripple of waves on the sea. The sea itself, the reality beyondand within the rippling forms, cannot be measured in terms of the ripples.Comparably, the objects in the world are of one reality and in reality thereforeone; but this reality is beyond description in terms of phenomenality. This onereality, in its ontologi-cal aspect, can be termed only bhuta-tathata, \"thesuchness of beings, the essence of existence.\" In its relation to knowledge itis known as bodhi (\"wisdom\") and nirvana.That is to say, by treating positively the term and problem to which theHlnayana philosophers accorded only a negative description, the Mahayana schoolstranscended the comparatively naive positivism of their associates andapproached the nondualism of the contemporary Vedanta. The Hlnayana thinkers, inshort, never really faced the question of the degree or nature of theirso-called \"reality.\" Precisely in what sense were their dharmas and chains ofcauses and effects being declared to \"exist\"? How much was being said, afterall, when it was insisted that the dharmas were ultimately \"real\"? The Mahayanaphilosophers, turning their attention to this question, distinguished threeaspects in terms of which the reality of any object could be considered: (1)quintessence, (2) attributes, (3) activities. The quintessence of a jar is earthor clay; its attributes, the coarseness or fineness, fragility or strength,beauty or ugliness, etc. of the form; while its activities are the receiving,holding, and discharging of water. Both attributes and activities are subject tolaws of change, but quintessence is absolutely indestructible. The waves of thesea may be high or low, but the water itself neither increases nor decreases.And so it is that though all thingsare born to die—whether as long-lived individuals, or as infinitesimal momentaryparticles—the quintessence of them all remains unchanged. The universe, theentire world of names and forms, has both its phenomenal and its enduringaspect, but only the latter, this substratum of all things, is what can be knownas bhuta-tathata, the \"suchness or essence of existence.\"According to the basic argument of this metaphysical philosophy (which takes itsstand, so to say, in nirvana) every dharma is pratitya-samutpanna, \"dependent onothers.\" It cannot be explained by reference either to itself or to somethingelse, or by bringing the two sets of references into a relationship. Everysystem of notions terminates in inconsistencies and is therefore simply void.And yet, to assert that all is \"non-existent\" (abhdva) would not be propereither; for that would be only another act of dialectical reasoning, whereastrue wisdom is neither an affirmation or a negation. \"Nothing is abandoned,nothing annihilated (na kasyacit prahanam, ndpi kasyacin nirodhah)!'The only final truth, then, is the void—an ineffable entity, the state of \"beingthus\" (tathata), which is realized as opposed to the ever-changing mirage ofcontingent notions. This, and this alone, is the absolute that persiststhroughout all space and time as the essence of things. Things in theirfundamental nature cannot be named or explained; they cannot be discussed; theyare beyond the range of perception; they are possessed of absolute sameness;they have no distinctive features; they are subject to neither transformationnor destruction. The realm of their reality is that of \"absolute truth\"(paramdrtha-tattva), not of \"relative truth\" (samvrti-tattva) —in other words,precisely what in the Upanisads is known as brahman; though the negative asopposed to the positive formulation here, in Buddhism, conduces to a differentattitude and a different style of thought and teaching.Nagarjuna (second or third century A.D.) is regarded as the great master of thisdoctrine. He is described (in a biography that a Hindu sage named Kumara-jivatranslated into Chinese about a.d. 405) as a Brahman of southern India, who,while a mere boy, studied the four Vedas and became adept in all sciences,including those of magic. In his earliest youth he made himself and threefriends invisible so that they might slip into the royal seraglio, but the fourhad hardly begun to take advantage of their situation when they wereapprehended. The friends were condemned to die, but Nagarjuna was allowed toelect the other death, namely, that of the monastic vow.In ninety days he studied and mastered the whole of the Buddhist Pali canon.Then he proceeded northward, in quest of further knowledge, until he came to theHimalayas, where a monk of immense age committed to him the Mahayana sutras;after which a serpent king (ndgardja) disclosed an authentic commentary on thosepages. All these sacred writings had been preserved in secret—so the storygoes—for centuries. They were, in fact, authentic revelations of the doctrine,which the Buddha himself had regarded as too profound for his contemporaries andhad therefore put into the keeping of competent guardians. Mankind had requiredliterally hundreds of years of preliminary training (the training of theHinayana) in preparation for this higher law. But now that the world was ready,Nagarjuna was permitted to spread the final Buddhist teachingof \"The Great Ferryboat\" throughout the land of India. And he did so (so runsthe legend) for three hundred years.The foundation of the Mahayana is thus in legend ascribed to Nagarjuna. Theevidence, however, now seems to show that the basic principles were formulatedwell before his century. Though practically the whole of the so-calledPrajna-paramita literature is attributed to him, it now appears that some ofthese texts preceded, while others followed, his lifetime. And yet it iscertain, in spite of the fabulous details of his biography, that Nagarjuna wasan actual character, and, moreover, a brilliant, crystallizing, and energizingphilosophical spirit. Throughout northern India they still speak of him as \"theBuddha without his characteristic marks.\" And the works ascribed to him arerevered equally with \"the sutras from the Buddha's own mouth.\"The Doctrine of No-Soul: AnattaWALPOLA SRI RAHULAWalpola Sri Rahula is a Buddhist-scholar monk from Sri Lanka who taught for manyyears as a professor at Northwestern University. This selection discusses anattaor \"no soul\" which is essential to the understanding of Buddhism, a religionthat is unique in stating that there is no separate self or soul whose salvationis the goal and purpose of existence. The human Guatama (Buddha) understood theheroic quest for the secret to abolish rebirth and suffering for all sentientbeings. When he experienced Nirvana, he also discovered the truth of \"no soul\"W hat in general is suggested by Soul, Self, Ego, or to use the Sanskritexpression Atman, is that in man there is a permanent, everlasting and absoluteentity, which is the unchanging substance behind the changing phenomenal world.According to some religions, each individual has such a separate soul which iscreated by God, and which, finally after death, lives eternally either in hellor heaven, its destiny depending on the judgment of its creator. According toothers, it goes through many lives till it is completely purified and becomesfinally united with God or Brahman, Universal Soul or Atman, from which itoriginally emanated. This soul or self in man is the thinker of thoughts,feeler of sensations, and receiver of rewards and punishments for all itsactions good and bad. Such a conception is called the idea of self.Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existenceof such a Soul, Self, or Atman. According to the teaching of the Buddha, theidea of self is an imaginary, false belief which has no corresponding reality,and it produces harmful thoughts of \"me\" and \"mine,\" selfish desire, craving,attachment, hatred, ill-will, conceit, pride, egoism, and other defilements,impurities and problems. It is the source of all the troubles in the world frompersonal conflicts to wars between nations. In short, to this false view can betraced all the evil in the world.Two ideas are psychologically deep-rooted in man: self-protection andself-preservation. For self-protection man has created God, on whom he dependsfor his own protection, safety and security, just as a child depends on itsparent. For self-preservation man has conceived the idea of an immortal Soul orAtman, which will live eternally. In his ignorance, weakness, fear, and desire,man needs these two things to console himself. Hence he clings to them deeplyand fanatically.The Buddha's teaching does not support this ignorance, weakness, fear, anddesire, but aims at making man enlightened by removing and destroying them,striking at their very root. According to Buddhism, our ideas of God and Soulare false and empty. Though highly developed as theories, they are all the sameextremely subtle mental projections, garbed in an intricate metaphysical andphilosophical phraseology. These ideas are so deep-rooted in man, and so nearand dear to him, that he does not wish to hear, nor does he want to understand,any teaching against them.The Buddha knew this quite well. In fact, he said that his teaching was \"againstthe current\" (patisotagdmi), against man's selfish desires. Just four weeksafter his Enlightenment, seated under a banyan tree, he thought to himself: \"Ihave realized this Truth which is deep, difficult to see, difficult tounderstand . . . comprehensible only by the wise ... Men who are overpowered bypassions and surrounded by a mass of darkness cannot see this Truth, which isagainst the current, which is lofty, deep, subtle and hard to comprehend.\"With these thoughts in his mind, the Buddha hesitated for a moment, whether itwould not be in vain if he tried to explain to the world the Truth he had justrealized. Then he compared the world to a lotus pond: In a lotus pond there aresome lotuses still under water; there are others which have risen only up to thewater level; there are still others which stand above water and are untouched byit. In the same way in this world, there are men at different levels ofdevelopment. Some would understand the Truth. So the Buddha decided to teach it.The doctrine of Anatta or No-Soul is the natural result of, or the corollary to,the analysis of the Five Aggregates and the teaching of Conditioned Genesis(Paticca-samuppdda).We have seen earlier, in the discussion of the First Noble Truth (Dukkha), thatwhat we call a being or an individual is composed of the Five Aggregates, andthat when these are analysed and examined, there is nothing behind themwhich can be taken as \"I,\" Atman, or Self, or any unchanging abiding substance.That is the analytical method. The same result is arrived at through thedoctrine of Conditioned Genesis which is the synthetical method, and accordingto this nothing in the world is absolute. Everything is conditioned, relative,and interdependent. This is the Buddhist theory of relativity.Before we go into the question of Anatta proper, it is useful to have a briefidea of the Conditioned Genesis. The principle of this doctrine is given in ashort formula of four lines:When this is, that is (lmasmim sati idam hoti); This arising, that arises(Imassuppddd idam uppajjati); When this is not, that is not {lmasmim asati idamna hoti); This ceasing, that ceases (Imassa nirodha idam nirujjhati). 1On this principle of conditionality, relativity and interdependence, the wholeexistence and continuity of life and its cessation are explained in a detailedformula which is called Paticca-samuppdda \"Conditioned Genesis,\" consisting oftwelve factors:1. Through ignorance are conditioned volitional actions or karma-formations(Avijjdpaccayd samkhdrd).2. Through volitional actions is conditioned consciousness (Samkhdrapaccaydvinndnam).3. Through consciousness are conditioned mental and physical phenomena(Vinndnapaccayd ndmarupam).4. Through mental and physical phenomena are conditioned the six faculties(i.e., five physical sense-organs and mind) (Ndmarupapaccayd saldyatanam).5. Through the six faculties is conditioned (sensorial and mental) contact(Sal-dyatanapaccayd phasso).6. Through (sensorial and mental) contact is conditioned sensation(Phassapac-cayd vedand).7. Through sensation is conditioned desire, 'thirst' (Vedandpaccayd tanhd).8. Through desire ('thirst') is conditioned clinging (Tanhdpaccayd updddnam).9. Through clinging is conditioned the process of becoming (Updddnapaccaydbhavo).10. Through the process of becoming is conditioned birth (Bhavapaccayd jdti) .11. Through birth are conditioned (12) decay, death, lamentation, pain, etc.(Jdtipaccayd jardmaranam . . .).This is how life arises, exists and continues. If we take this formula in itsreverse order, we come to the cessation of the process:Through the complete cessation of ignorance, volitional activities orkarma-formations cease; through the cessation of volitional activities,consciousness ceases; . . . through the cessation of birth, decay, death,sorrow, etc., cease.It should be clearly remembered that each of these factors is conditioned(paticcasamuppanna) as well as conditioning (paticca saamuppdda) . Thereforethey are all relative, interdependent and interconnected, and nothing isabsolute or independent; hence no first cause is accepted by Buddhism as we haveseen earlier. Conditioned Genesis should be considered as a circle, and not as achain.The question of Free Will has occupied an important place in Western thought andphilosophy. But according to Conditioned Genesis, this question does not andcannot arise in Buddhist philosophy. If the whole of existence is relative,conditioned and interdependent, how can will alone be free? Will, like any otherthought, is conditioned. So-called \"freedom\" itself is conditioned and relative.Such a conditioned and relative \"Free Will\" is not denied. There can be nothingabsolutely free, physical or mental, as everything is interdependent andrelative. If Free Will implies a will independent of conditions, independent ofcause and effect, such a thing does not exist. How can a will, or anything forthat matter, arise without conditions, away from cause and effect, when thewhole of existence is conditioned and relative, and is within the law of causeand effect? Here again, the idea of Free Will is basically connected with theideas of God, Soul, justice, reward and punishment. Not only is so-called freewill not free, but even the very idea of Free Will is not free from conditions.According to the doctrine of Conditioned Genesis, as well as according to theanalysis of being into Five Aggregates, the idea of an abiding, immortalsubstance in man or outside, whether it is called Atman, \"I,\" Soul, Self, orEgo, is considered only a false belief, a mental projection. This is theBuddhist doctrine oiAnatta, No-Soul or No-Self.In order to avoid a confusion it should be mentioned here that there are twokinds of truths: conventional truth (sammuti-sacca, Skt. samvrti-satya) andultimate truth (paramattha-sacca, Skt. paramdrtha-satya). When we use suchexpressions in our daily life as \"I,\" \"you,\" \"being,\" \"individual,\" etc., we donot lie because there is no self or being as such, but we speak a truthconforming to the convention of the world. But the ultimate truth is that thereis no \"I\" or \"being\" in reality. As the Mahdydna-sutrdlahkdra says: \"A person(pudgala) should be mentioned as existing only in designation (prajnapti) (i.e.,conventionally there is a being), but not in reality (or substance dravya)!'\"The negation of an imperishable Atman is the common characteristic of alldogmatic systems of the Lesser as well as the Great Vehicle, and, there is,therefore, no reason to assume that Buddhist tradition which is in completeagreement on this point has deviated from the Buddha's original teaching.\"It is therefore curious that recently there should have been a vain attempt by afew scholars to smuggle the idea of self into the teaching of the Buddha, quitecontrary to the spirit of Buddhism. These scholars respect, admire, and veneratethe Buddha and his teaching. They look up to Buddhism. But they cannot imaginethat the Buddha, whom they consider the most clear and profound thinker, couldhave denied the existence of an Atman or Self which they need so much. Theyunconsciously seek the support of the Buddha for this need for eternalexistence—of course not in a petty individual self with small s, but in the bigSelf with a capital S.It is better to say frankly that one believes in an Atman or Self. Or one mayeven say that the Buddha was totally wrong in denying the existence of an At-man. But certainly it will not do for any one to try to introduce into Buddhisman idea which the Buddha never accepted, as far as we can see from the extantoriginal texts.Religions which believe in God and Soul make no secret of these two ideas; onthe contrary, they proclaim them, constantly and repeatedly, in the mosteloquent terms. If the Buddha had accepted these two ideas, so important in allreligions, he certainly would have declared them publicly, as he had spokenabout other things, and would not have left them hidden to be discovered only 25centuries after his death.People become nervous at the idea that through the Buddha's teaching of Anatta,the self they imagine they have is going to be destroyed. The Buddha was notunaware of this.A bhikkhu once asked him: \"Sir, is there a case where one is tormented whensomething permanent within oneself is not found?\"\"Yes, bhikkhu, there is,\" answered the Buddha. \"A man has the following view:'The universe is that Atman, I shall be that after death, permanent, abiding,ever-lasting, unchanging, and I shall exist as such for eternity.' He hears theTathagata or a disciple of his, preaching the doctrine aiming at the completedestruction of all speculative views . . . aiming at the extinction of'thirst,'aiming at detachment, cessation, Nirvana. Then that man thinks: 'I will beannihilated, I will be destroyed, I will be no more.' So he mourns, worrieshimself, laments, weeps, beating his breast, and becomes bewildered. Thus, Obhikkhu, there is a case where one is tormented when something permanent withinoneself is not found.\"Elsewhere the Buddha says: \"O bhikkhus, this idea that I may not be, I may nothave, is frightening to the uninstructed worldling.\"Those who want to find a 'Self in Buddhism argue as follows: It is true that theBuddha analyses being into matter, sensation, perception, mental formations, andconsciousness, and says that none of these things is self. But he does not saythat there is no self at all in man or anywhere else, apart from theseaggregates.This position is untenable for two reasons:One is that, according to the Buddha's teaching, a being is composed only ofthese Five Aggregates, and nothing more. Nowhere has he said that there wasanything more than these Five Aggregates in a being.The second reason is that the Buddha denied categorically, in unequivocal terms,in more than one place, the existence of Atman, Soul, Self, or Ego within man orwithout, or anywhere else in the universe.NOTEl To put it into a modern form: When A is, B is; A arising, B arises; When A isnot, B is not; A ceasing, B ceases.Some Buddhist Concepts of Kuan YinJOHN BLOFELDJohn Blofeld, an Englishman who settled in the Far East as a young man beforeWorld War II, dedicated his life's work to studying Chinese religion andphilosophy. This selection, based upon Blofeld's interviews with the Chinese,presents Chinese attitudes toward Kuan Yin. Kuan Yin is the counterpart of themale Avalokiteshvara, prominent in ancient times in India and continuously inTibet. One of the most popular features of Chinese Buddhism is devotion to thefemale Bodhisattva Kuan Yin. The secret of Kuan Yin meditation is to find theBodhisattva within oneself. The search for the Bodhisattva Kuan Yin's realm hasbeen a primary goal of Chinese Buddhism for many centuries.To the perfection of her merits, Worshipping, we bow our heads Lotus Sutra1 have always been intrigued by those masterpieces of Chinese ivory carvingcomprising a large number of exquisitely carved balls revolving one withinanother. Being intricately decorated, the outer layers largely conceal thosewithin; though one gazes long and hard, it is not easy to discern the innermostball or even to distinguish clearly one middle layer from another. So it waswith my perception of Kuan Yin, some of her more and less materialistic aspectsseeming to be inextricably intertwined. This was especially true of the levelsof understanding at which she gradually exchanges her goddess-like attributesfor those of a Bodhisattva. The guise she wears for those who burn incense toher in wayside shrines and mountain grottoes or in the temples of thefisher-folk and boat-dwellers undergoes no startling change when she presentsherself to the less erudite members of Chinese and Japanese Buddhistcommunities. True, they know her by her proper title, Bodhisattva, but somewould be hard put to it to explain in what manner gods and Bodhisattvas differ.The Mahayana sutras chiefly prized by the Pure Land Sect to which many of herdevotees belong do not easily yield their hidden meaning. Indeed, they resemblethe profound tan-trie works revered by Tibetans in that, if taken literally inthe absence of oral instruction from a Mascer, they may repel rather thanattract most Western students of the Way, who may deem them too full of marvelsto merit serious attention.Were the approach taken here to understanding Kuan Yin's true significance to bemade fully consistent, it would be necessary to set forth the Pure Land teachingand practices as they appear to the uninstructed and reserve their esotericmeaning for a later chapter. However, that is not quite how I came upon themmyself; thanks to the guidance of some Chinese friends, I began to have at leasta vague conception of the esoteric meaning while still near the outset of mystudies and I have ordered my exposition accordingly. Like a fair number ofother Western Buddhists, I began by shying away from what could be seen of PureLand practice all about me in South China, being unable as yet to reconcile itwith the Buddhist teaching familiar to me. Though its manifestations were alwaysbeautiful, I did not believe they had much relation to reality.Briefly, the doctrine in its literal form is that the Buddha, foreseeing theonset of a decadent age (in the midst of which we now find ourselves today) andrecognising how difficult it would be for the beings born in that age to pursueEnlightenment by the means he had expounded hitherto, compassionately presenteda much easier way. He delivered some sutras (discourses) anent celestial Buddhassuch as Amitabha and Bodhisattvas such as Kuan Yin, each of whom had mentallycreated a spiritual realm (Pure Land) wherein all beings who aspired to itearnestly could secure rebirth under conditions ideally suited to makingprogress towards Enlightenment. Profiting by the vast merits of the creator oftheir chosen Pure Land, such beings, however great their demerits, could easilyattain rebirth in, for example, Kuan Yin's Potala and thus escape the drearyround of birth, suffering and death endlessly renewed which is samsara.Furthermore, those celestial Buddhas and Bodhisattvas were portrayed as wieldingmiraculous powers wherewith they could instantly avert danger or affliction fromany being who called upon them with absolute sincerity; thus, even should one bekneeling beneath an executioner's sword already raised to strike, a singleheart-felt cry to Kuan Yin Bodhisattva would cause the blade to fall shatteredto the ground!Well, this teaching, though couched in terms of the utmost beauty, struck me astoo good to be true, too redolent of primitive conceptions of heaven and offairy godmother tales like Cinderella. However, my Chinese friends advised menot to dismiss the teaching out of hand, but rather to seek its inner purport.Soon after my arrival in the East, I had struck up a warm friendship with a mostunusual man, a Chinese physician and keen Buddhist about ten years my senior. Iwas immediately attracted to him for several reasons, not the least of which washis fondness for tradition as exemplified by his garb—instead of a Western-stylebusiness suit, a mode of dress already becoming common in Hong Kong, he wore agraceful silken robe surmounted by an old-fashioned skull-cap of stiff blacksatin with a tiny scarlet bobble at the crown. Being fond of the more esotericforms of Buddhism, he had first mastered the Shingon form recently brought backto China from Japan and then embarked on a life-long study of the Vajrayanataught by Tibetan lamas; and, with regard to the Pure Land Sect and others, heretained the typically Chinese attitude which the Venerable T'ai Hsu once summedup in the words: \"All the sects are like beads on one rosary.\" It was to Ta Hai,my physician friend, that I took some doubts about the Pure Land teaching whichpersisted despite my feeling a special affinity to Kuan Yin.\"Elder Brother, since having that odd experience, I have been thinking muchabout Kuan Yin,\" I said one day, handing him an opened copy of the Heart ofGreat Compassion Dharani Sutra and pointing to the words: \"Should any beingrecite and cleave to the sacred Dharani of Great Compassion and yet not bereborn in my Buddhaland, I vow not to enter upon Supreme Enlightenment. \"\"As you know,\" I continued, \"there are many passages in the sutras which statethat one who calls upon her name with great sincerity or recites her mantra fromhis heart will surely be reborn in her sacred Potala and there be trained toachieve Enlightenment. Does that not strike you as too easy to be true?Elsewhere the sutras stress again and again that the seed of Enlightenmentlatent in every being must be watered by self-cultivation, that no teacher,human or divine, can do the work on our behalf. Granted that those descriptionsof Pure Lands full of jewelled trees, gem-studded lotus pools and birds warblingthe sacred teaching can be understood figuratively and putting aside the factthat such descriptions come oddly from the lips of people who share our beliefin the Mind Only doctrine, there is another obstacle. How can you reconcile theneed for self-power (tzu-li) with the Pure Land Sect's reliance on other-power(t'a-li)? It seems so very illogical.\"Ta Hai laughed delightedly. \"I think, Ah Jon, you are still foreign-devil-manand cannot learn to think like Chinese. Why you care about logical, not logical?Truth have plenty faces. As you see things, so things are. As you expect things,so things come. Why? Because your mind make them so. You dream long time ofjewelled paradise, you surely take rebirth there. You think wisdom help youreach formless world, you surely take rebirth there. You have learnt to reciteHeart Sutra, yes? So you know very well 'Form is void and void is form; form notdiffer from void, void not differ from form.' Then why you worry these nonsensethings? I and my friends tell you and tell you and tell you that appearances areall in mind. Why you not understand? Outside mind—nothing!\"\"Yes, but—\"\"Listen, Ah Jon. Pure Land teacher say fix mind on sacred name or speak sacredmantra many, many times, then your mind become still, yes? All obscurationsdisappear. That way, you know, plenty people get objectless awareness which isfirst step to Enlightenment. That is very good, no? So why you care how they getit? All of us Buddhists are looking for goal higher than man can see or imagine.You agree? Good. Suppose my picture of goal is dull and your picture seems toyou much clearer, you know quite well that both those pictures must be a long,long way—a million miles and more—from truth picture. We go one million milewalk; you start one inch in front of me not help you much, Ah Jon. Your talkabout tzu-li and t'a-li sound very good, very clever, very wise to you? To me,all nonsense! You want to study Buddha Dharma, you must study mind. Only mind isreal, but now you try to put front door and back door on it! Self? Other?Inside? Outside? How can be? Some people look for Enlightenment in mind. Somepeople look for Bodhisattva. You find them different? Never can be! Why? Becausewhole universe live inside your bony skull. Nowhere else at all. Amitabha Buddhain your skull. Kuan Yin Bodhisattva in your skull. Ch'an (Zen) followers seekEnlightenment from mind. Pure Land followers seek it in Pure Land. Whatdifference? Two thoughts; one Source. You are philosopher, so think one way.Your friend just love Kuan Yin, so think another. Different, yes! Whatdifference? Two faint ideas, same shining truth.\"You seek stirring of compassion in mind, soon you find. Seek shiningcompassion-being like Kuan Yin, soon you find. Suppose you run out in streetnow, tell everybody must use self-power, not other-power; you think theyunderstand? Or they stand there gaping? You ought to welcome compassionateBuddha's thousand ways of teaching thousand kinds of people.\"I believe I learned more from Ta Hai than from any other man, but it was not allplain sailing. His English was worse than I have represented it here and myCantonese no better at that time. We managed to tackle all kinds of abstrusesubjects, helping out the words with gestures, drawings and Chinese writtencharacters, but relying greatly on the kind of telepathic understanding by whichclose friends can surmount most language barriers. With others of our group itwas often easier, as some spoke English very well indeed. Asked why many PureLand followers seemed to prefer evoking Kuan Yin rather than Amitabha Buddha ofwhom she is but an emanation, one of them replied:\"Like you, they feel drawn to her. It is because of your nature. If you were ahorse, you would be sure to invoke the Horse-Headed Hayagrlva, who is also KuanYin. If a lobster, you would choose a lobster deity, just as nagas invokeserpent divinities. Picturing compassion in the form of a lovely woman is areasonable thing to do. Amitabha Buddha is compassion seen as a noble quality,shining and majestic; Kuan Yin is compassion seen as intimate and a counterpartof gentle pity. Not having many heads in the Indian manner nor necessarilysharing Amitabha's vastness, she appeals to humanists like you and me and fitsin well with our Chinese conception of divinity.\"From all of this I began drawing a conclusion that proved absolutely wrong, forwhen I voiced it they opposed it vehemently and I perceived that the waters wehad entered were deeper than they seemed.\"Do you mean,\" I asked, \"that Amitabha, Kuan Yin and their vows to succoursentient beings are really myths used to persuade unlearned people toconcentrate upon their names and thus achieve one-pointedness of mind eventhough unable to perceive its proper purpose?\"Before the words were well out of my mouth, I realised I had uttered anenormity. They glanced at one another in consternation—not, I think, becauselike Jovians in a similar situation they expected a shower of thunderbolts togreet this blasphemy, but because they were aghast that their way of puttingthings had led me so far astray, or perhaps they were just bewildered by myobtuseness.\"Make no mistake,\" cried old Mr. Lao sharply, speaking in Cantonese in hiseagerness to set the record straight. \"The Buddhas, the Bodhisattvas and theirvows are real. If you doubt it, you will be beyond their help!\"\"But—\"\"Look at this blackwood desk. Is it real, do you think?\"\"Yes, of course—real in the limited sense that any phenomenon is real. You cansee and touch it.\"\"Good. How about, say, justice? We are told, for example, that Britain's legalsystem ensures you people a greater measure of justice than is to be had in HongKong. Is justice real?\"\"Ye-es. If you put it that way. Justice can be quantified to some extent andseen to exist in one place but not in another. It would make sense to say thatall justice had been banished from such-and-such a country.\"\"Excellent. Though you cannot hurt your hand by banging it against justice, youdo agree it is real. But why is it real? Because mind conceives it. If humanbeings were mindless entities like motor-cars, there could be no such thing asjustice. Whatever the mind conceives thereby achieves reality. Suppose it werefound that, after all, our national sage, Confucius, had no historicalexistence, would it alter the fact of his overwhelming influence on our country?Conceived of in the way he is, he would have become a reality and his reportedwords and actions, as the causes of great effects, would also have reality. Besure that Kuan Yin's vow is real, that if you earnestly desire rebirth in herPotala paradise, you will take birth there.\"Such were the conversations Ta Hai and his friends most enjoyed and great was mybewildered admiration of their wisdom. The questions and answers reported abovemay seem obscure unless one has a background knowledge of Ma-hayana Buddhism.The crux of the matter is as follows:According to that teaching, it is not profitable to spend time on such questionsas whether there was ever a beginning to the succession of universes that havebeen arising and reaching their end for innumerable aeons, or why sentientbeings must revolve endlessly from life to life in this sad realm of samsara.What is needed is to direct one's attention to the present, thinking: \"This ishow things are; what is to be done about them?'' It is taught that reality hastwo aspects—the realms of Void and form—but that, due to obscurations arisingfrom primordial ignorance and from evil karma accumulated in past lives, we failto see that nothing can exist independently of everything else, that allentities (including people) are transient, mutable, unsatisfying and lacking inown-being. It is the illusion of possessing an ego that leads to suchobscurations as passion, lust and inordinate desire. From these in turn spring alonging for continued individual existence which keeps beings revolving in theround of birth and death, reaping over and over again sorrow, frustration,disappointment, grief, adversity. Could one but be rid of all ego-borndelusions, he would see himself as a shadow pursuing shadows and eagerly seek anend to the round—not in extinction, but in Nirvana, the glorious apotheosis inwhich illusory egos are no more. The way out lies within each sentient being'smind in the form of latent wisdom-compassion energy (Bodhi). This is so becauseso-called individual minds are not truly apart from Mind, the Plenum in whicheverything exists forever and forever in the form of 'no thing/ When entitiesvanish, nothing is lost, for they had no ultimate existence in the first place,being nevertheless real because not divorced from the Void.Liberation is achieved by Enlightenment, the fruit of transcending allego-delusion. A powerful technique for attaining it is meditation (better calledcontemplation) which results in a turning over of the mind upon itself, theexpulsion of obscurations and recognition of oneself and all beings as beingwholly without self or anything describable as own-being. Thus the effort has tobe self-effort. No wise guru, no high divinity can accomplish this revolution onone's behalf; it must occur of itself. Now comes the surprise and seemingcontradiction. Adherents of the Pure Land School seek a way out through rebirthin a \"Pure Land\" where they can give themselves over to the great task ofseeking Enlightenmentunder ideal conditions, there being no hindrances, but only powerfullyfavourable influences. Exoterically it is taught that the Buddha Amitabha (likesome others such as Kuan Yin) vowed to save all beings who call upon himwholeheartedly by admitting them to a Pure Land, this being his compassionatemeans of assisting those weak in self-power or too ignorant to understand how touse it. Esoterically it is recognised that the Pure Land is no other than PureMind, the condition of all minds when purged of ego-born obscurations. But thisdistinction between the exoteric and esoteric understanding of the doctrine isnot simple or sharp-cut. Even exceedingly erudite Buddhists such as Ta Hai holdthat the various Pure Lands, including Kuan Yin's Potala, do in a sense exist asplaces, since mind has thus conceived them. This seemingly startling departurefrom logic is somewhat less puzzling if one accepts that all entities are mentalcreations, none ultimately more or less real than any other.A devotional approach, like that of Pure Land followers, is currently out offavour in the West, being too reminiscent of the Christian and Jewish faithswhich many people no longer find acceptable. Few Asians share this antipathy.Even Theravada (southern) Buddhism has a greater element of devotional practicethan is generally recognised by Westerners. The same is true of Chan (Zen)Buddhism, many of whose most ardent followers (including the great DaisetsSuzuki) have affirmed the validity of the Pure Land doctrine and regard PureLand practices as a particularly efficient means of attaining Enlightenment.Even today, the Pure Land School has a much greater following among JapaneseBuddhists than any other, as it had in China prior to the submergence of allreligion beneath the waters of the Red flood. Under present circumstances, PureLand practice may not be well suited to the West; nevertheless, its criticsamong Western Buddhists would do well to ponder the implications of Mahayanaphilosophy more deeply before dismissing Pure Land teachings, as they sometimesdo, as being contrary to the spirit of traditional Buddhism. As Asian Buddhistshave always understood, different kinds of people need to make widely differentapproaches to the same truth. This is possible because one is not dealing withunderstanding, which is to some extent governed by the rules of logic, but witha practice that, if properly performed, will achieve results however one mayinitially conceive of it. A man who presses an electric light switch willsucceed in turning on the light, even if he happens to be under the impressionthat he is switching on the radio.To return to Kuan Yin. I believe my friend's point about invoking theBodhisattva embodying wisdom-compassion in a form well suited to a people'scultural traditions was a good one; but, in my opinion, there may also beanother reason for the preference given to Kuan Yin by people whose beliefs aregenerally in line with those of the Pure Land School. The visualisationprescribed for meditators in the Amitayus Sutra is very difficult to perform incomparison with the popular manner of meditating upon Kuan Yin. When engaged inthe sutra-type meditation, one has to build up a complicated picture involving,for example, the mental creation of eight pools flowing into fourteen channels,each with the radiant colours of seven jewels; in each pool there are 600,000lotuses, each with seven jewels and each possessing a girth twelve times thedistance coveredby an army in a day's march! Amitabha's height equals that same distancemultiplied by the number of sand-grains in sixty thousand million million riverseach of them the size of the Ganges! It is written that all this, and very muchelse besides, has to be visualised as clearly as one sees his hand before hiseyes! The mind boggles—which is just what is intended, for, as with Chan (Zen)koans, the purpose is to exhaust the mind to the point where it is jerked into anew dimension. When successfully performed, this type of visualisation leads toa sudden transformation of consciousness, thereby opening up new realms hithertofar beyond the uttermost bounds of perception. Still, the task is daunting. Thesimple contemplation of Kuan Yin described in the chapter on meditation mayperhaps be less effective, but is certainly better suited to the limitedcompetence of ordinary meditators.This view of the matter was suggested to me by a pamphlet I discovered in thevery embryonic library of the school-room for novices in the Hua T'ing Monasterynear Kunming. Locally printed, it was the work of a strange-looking man whooccasionally paid us visits. Carelessly dressed, much given to laughter atunexpected moments, he would have impressed me as slightly demented, but for hisreputation for wisdom—a great many holy men in China's history are reputed tohave made just such an impression of daftness on their more staidcontemporaries. Unable to recall more than the general purport of the pamphlet,I have had to fill in the details from my imagination, but my version isfaithful in spirit to the original.It began with some information regarding the writer's identity, birth-place,family and so forth, and then proceeded on the following lines:\"My father and grandfather, Confucian scholars of the old school, looked onBuddhists with disfavour, believing them to delude people with lurid tales ofmagic. It was through my mother—an unusually highly literate woman from avillage near Ta Li—that I came upon the profound doctrine known as 'thevoid-ness of non-void.' Not that she herself had much interest in suchprofundities. A devoted follower of the Pure Land School, she cared nothing formetaphysics, but it was her custom to buy whatever Buddhist works the pedlar whosupplied us happened to bring. As a small child I learned to recite the sacredformula, Hail to Amitabha Buddha! many hundreds of times a day, though always insecret for fear of my father's anger. My mother believed that one-pointedrepetition of this formula was enough in itself to ensure liberation from theround of birth and death. Once when my classmates in the middle school heard mesoftly invoking Amitabha Buddha they jeered at me so heartily that, to win backtheir esteem, I took to bringing to school Buddhist works which they had toadmit would tax the understanding of erudite scholars. Pretending I understoodthese works myself, I came to study them in all seriousness. I believed thenthat the Pure Land practice was suitable only for women, peasants and similarlyill-educated people, and had turned instead to such works as The PureConsciousness Treatise, the Avatamsaka and Lankavatara Sutras. They availed menothing, their only effect being to disturb my mind, so I returned to invokingAmitabha Buddha, but not without reflecting smugly that my understanding of thispractice was now at a 'higher level' than my mother's! How ignorant I must havepicture4 [images/picture4.jpg]seemed to her! 'Higher' and 'lower,' 'deep' and 'shallow,' what have thesedualisms to do with knowledge, wisdom, understanding?\"Once I went to listen to a lecture on Pure Land contemplation by a famousTripitaka Master who fired me with ambition to visualise scenes of unimaginablevastness. This, too, got me nowhere. Having painfully built up a huge andglittering background of immense, heavily bejewelled trees and lakes, I had toset about creating images of the Three Holy Ones. No sooner had I started onAm-itabha Buddha than the background slipped away; starting on Kuan YinBodhisattva, I lost Amitabha; starting on Mahasthama Bodhisattva, I lost KuanYin. It was all beyond my power. Only conceit hindered me from going back tosimple repetition of the sacred formula, which my mother had never for one dayabandoned.\"One night I dreamed of being shipwrecked, of clinging to a spar in a furiouslyraging sea. Mountainous waves curved about me like writhing dragons until, atlast, I was cast upon a shore of unearthly beauty. Overlooking the rocky coast,a hill of turquoise rose from a forest of jade that was watered by foamingcascades of milk-white purity. The wings of birds and insects had a jewelledsheen; the spotted deer had coats of white and crimson fur. How could I doubtthat I had come upon the seagirt paradise, Potala? Awed, but joyous, I climbedswiftly towards the crest of the hill.\"I had been observed, for a young girl came running down the slope to greet me.Her charming little feet seemed scarcely to touch the rocks over which she sped.When she turned and signalled me to follow her, I had difficulty in keeping upand was irked to notice how torn she was between good manners and an urge toburst out laughing. On our reaching the mouth of a great turquoise cavern, sheran in and soon disappeared from view, leaving me to follow as best I could. Wehad come to this place by skirting a lake of gold-flecked blue, an arm of whichran into the cave, its blue water hidden beneath masses of pink and white lotus.Though no direct sunlight penetrated beyond the entrance, the cave wasilluminated as though by bright sunshine and a delicate fragrance filled theair. In the centre was a throne-shaped rock. Though it had neither cushions noroccupant, I knew it for the Bodhisattva's own and, kneeling, bowed my head tothe gleaming silver sand at its foot. As I did so, my name was spoken by a voiceas melodious as the tinkling of jade ornaments, the syllables distinct and longdrawn out.'\"Cheng-Li, when my vow was uttered many aeons ago, I thought I had made thingssimple. Why do you strive? Let go! The whole Mahayana Canon contains no greaterwisdom than the wisdom of letting go. This is also called ddna, giving.'\"There came a sweetly joyous laugh, then silence. I knew I was now alone in thatshining cave. Already the magical colours were fading into powder-fine colouredsparks that vanished one by one. Darkness followed and, stretching out my hand,I brushed it against the gauze curtains hung around my bed.\"Now I have done with sutras and pious practices. Day and night I recite theBodhisattva's sacred name, rejoicing in the beauty of its sound. Not for me itsrecitation in multiples of a hundred and eight, as though it were a duty. Doesthe runner count his breaths or the poet his words, or the stream its ripples?Yousentient beings who seek deliverance, why do you not—let go? When sad, let go ofthe cause for sadness. When wrathful, let go of the occasion of wrath. Whencovetous or lustful, let go of the object of desire. From moment to moment, befree of self. Where no self is, there can be no sorrow, no desire; no I to weep,no I to lust, no 'being' to die or be reborn. The winds of circumstance blowacross emptiness. Whom can they harm?\"Like many writings of this kind, it concluded with verses conveying the essenceof its meaning. I remember that they were beautiful and made much of the magicalsetting—the gold-flecked lotus pool, the turquoise mountain ringed with a forestof jade leaves and the \"dragon-curving waves.\" The Chinese language lends itselfto poetic descriptions of this sort and its monosyllabic character saves theverses from being heavy or ornate. The verses went on to epitomise the qualitiespertaining to a Bodhi-mind or heart of compassion and, at the end, came somesuch lines as:Wrathful, banish thought of selfhood; Sad, let fall the cause of woe; Lustful,shed lust's mental object; Win all by simply letting go.However, I am sure the original concluding verse was a great deal morearresting.Having received little personal instruction from Tripitaka Masters of the PureLand School, I am not confident of having grasped the profound inner meaning ofits teachings. It does not do to conceive of Kuan Yin and her Potala in thematerialistic terms acceptable to the unlettered, who fully expect to beholdphysical splendours when the Bodhisattva, in response to their frequentinvocations, comes to succour them at the moment of death; but nor should onetreat the Pure Land sutras as wholly allegorical, or suppose that the Pure Landpractice is of value only until the devotee \"enters the Potala\" in the sense ofrecognising it to be his own mind purged of obscurations. One must avoid anover-materialistic concept on the one hand and a purely allegoricalinterpretation on the other. Were you to say that Kuan Yin and her Potala existobjectively, you would be scolded for talking nonsense; but claim that she iswholly a creation of your own mind and you will be taken to task for arroganceor laughingly reminded that the Bodhisattva existed a long time before you wereborn. Pehaps full understanding is a fruit not to be won without intensive PureLand practice, for there is certainly no logical solution to the riddle.A recent exposition of the main practice of the Pure Land Sect—sustainedrecitation of one of the devotional formulas—is to be found in the writings ofthe Venerable Hsiian Hua, Abbot of Gold Mountain Monastery, San Francisco. Itdoes not solve the riddle just discussed, for the Master was not elucidatingthat point, but it does reveal that the purpose of reciting the sacred name isvery different from that underlying most of the theistic practices with which ithas been erroneously confused. Speaking of the recitation of Amitabha Buddha'sname, he says: \"If you maintain your recitation morning and night withoutstopping, you may recite to the point that you do not know you are walking whenyouwalk, you feel no thirst when you are thirsty, you experience no hunger when youare hungry, you do not know you are cold in freezing weather, and you do notfeel warmth when you are warm. People and dharmas (entities) are empty and youand Amitabha become one. 'Amitabha Buddha is me and I am Amitabha Buddha.' Thetwo cannot be separated. Recite single-mindedly and sincerely without erroneousthoughts. Pay no attention to worldly concerns. When you do not know the timeand do not know the day, you may arrive at a miraculous state.\" He also says:\"Day and night we recite the Buddha's name and with each sound we think ofAmitabha. The phrase 'Namo' means 'homage.' To whom are we paying homage?Ultimately we pay homage to ourselves! On the day when you entirely forgetyourself, the Amitabha of your own nature will appear.\" These quotations are ofcourse applicable to the similar invocation offered to Kuan Yin, which must notbe mistaken for a crude endeavour to win a divinity's favour by flattery, butrecognised as a powerful technique for banishing ego-born obscurations andcoming face to face with—Mind.Another illuminating saying by the same Tripitaka Master runs: \"As I have toldyou many times, the Dharma-door of Buddha recitation is false, and so are (thoseof) dyana (Zen) meditation and the Teaching School, the Vinaya (Discipline)School and the Secret (Esoteric) School. You need only believe in it and falsebecomes true; if you do not believe, then the true becomes false. . . .Everything is created from mind alone.\" On the face of it, this seems absurd.How can the false become true just by believing it? Yet to the mystic it makesexcellent sense, for he recognises that any picture of what lies beyond therange of conceptual thought is bound to be too poor an approximation to haveintrinsic worth; therefore all ways of picturing the path and goal are of valueonly as convenient stand-ins for use until direct intuitive perception isattained. Viewing the matter thus, one can more easily understand wherein liesthe efficacy of the rites for invoking Kuan Yin.Yet, even should one concede this point in relation to recitation of the sacredname or of the Dharani of Great Compassion, he may have difficulty in acceptingwhat is written in the Lotus Sutra and also in the sutra expounding that dharaniconcerning Kuan Yin's power to save beings from individual perils such asshipwreck, fire, storm, wild beasts, devils and even litigation. It must ofcourse occur to one that, were these powers real in a literal sense, then asmall body of devout believers, of whom there are many, could have stopped theJapanese invasion of China or the subsequent advance of the Red Army by causingweapons to fall to pieces in the soldiers' hands! So, short of rejecting theclaims made in those sutras, one is tempted to seek some less literalinterpretation.Do those brave words mean perhaps that calling upon Kuan Yin with one-pointedmind makes one impervious to cold, heat, hunger, thirst, etc., and leads to suchtotal freedom from the bonds of \"self,\" such perfect identification of theindividual's mind with Mind, that litigation and death by shipwreck or in atiger's maw are to be feared no more than dreams? This rationalisation isconvenient, but it does not take account of there having been too many instancesof people being literally saved from disaster in the nick of time by calling onKuan Yin for one to be able to discount them all as fabrications. What then? Canit be that absolute faith conjures from within oneself such powerful reserves inthe face ofdanger that seemingly miraculous escapes do in fact occur; or is something moremysterious, more \"magical\" involved?Personally I like to think that the inner purport of the passages about KuanYin's saving powers may be, in part, as follows. Sustained contemplation of theBodhisattva as the embodiment of pure compassion inevitably affects thedevotee's whole being. Seeking no advantages for himself, delighting to puthimself out for others when urged to do so, he comes in some ways to resemblethe Taoist sages of old—men so ungreedy, so easily satisfied with simple joys,so loath to take offence or put themselves forward unless pressed, so farremoved from every kind of aggressive behaviour and factionalism that they wereable to pass their lives in serene obscurity. Attracting no unwelcome attentionsfrom robbers, government authorities or policemen, making no enemies, harbouringno grudges—in short, causing not the least offence to humans, animals or ghosts,they lived from day to day untroubled by savage beasts or extortioners, safefrom the prisoner's manacles and strangers to the glittering horror of theexecutioner's sword. These were the Immortals whom ice could not freeze norsunbeams scorch.' Calamities rarely if ever came their way. But whether thisinterpretation presents more than a fraction of the sutras' true meaning, I donot know.In a commentary on the Dharani Sutra, the Venerable Hsiian Hua relates a typicalstory of Kuan Yin's saving power. A certain devotee of hers was passing thenight at an inn where the landlord was in the habit of administering druggedwine to the wayfarers who sought his hospitality and stealing into their roomsby night to rob and even murder them. This particular guest, however, was toofaithful a Buddhist to touch wine; not being drugged, he awoke to find thelandlord advancing upon him knife upraised; but at that very moment came a heavybanging at the front door. Hurriedly withdrawing, the landlord opened up to finda burly policeman-like individual who politely asked him to convey to one of hisguests—the very one he had been on the point of murdering—that an old friend ofsuch-and-such a name desired him to drop by in the morning. Tremblinglydiscarding his fell intention, he delivered this message soon after it waslight. The wayfarer, though he gave no sign, had no difficulty in recognisingthe syllables of the visitor's \"name\" as a quotation from the Dharani of GreatCompassion. In other words, the policeman-like individual had either been KuanYin herself or a being sent by her to protect a good man who had long made apractice of reciting that dharani!That the Venerable Hsiian Hua should in one place equate the celestial Buddhasand Bodhisattvas with the devotee's own mind and in another relate a factualstory of Kuan Yin's saving power well illustrates the difficulty of arriving ata satisfactory conception of the nature of those celestial beings.Famous Mahayana Parables: BurningHouse, Prodigal SonEDWIN A. BURTTEdwin A. Burtt was the Sage Professor of Philosophy at Cornell University. Theparables from this selection reveal the underlying theory of Mahayana Buddhismwhich is that the Bodhisattva has the goal of leading all beings toemancipation. To accomplish this he or she is motivated by compassion, but mustuse skillful means to attract human beings away from their hypnotic absorptionin the material world. The purpose of the Bodhisattva is to be the leader, theexample, and the savior for others. The Mahayana myths of the Bodhisattva show adevelopment over the earliest theories of Buddhism in which the Bodhisattva wasapparently less prominent.l\\s indicated in the introduction to this section, the main purpose of some ofthe most popular and frequently quoted Mahayana parables was to meet theobjection that according to the ancient sutras Buddha taught Theravada doctrinerather than the Mahayana ideal. This purpose is present in each of the followingparables, although the point of major emphasis varies. The \"burning house'develops the thought that although the Buddha had afar more wonderful truth togive to those who could understand it, he was not deceiving the minds of thebeginners by teaching them Theravada ideas. Such teaching was all they couldreceive and it would lead them in the right direction. In the \"prodigal son\" itis the fear and distrust of the immature seekers that must gradually andpatiently be overcome by the loving Buddha-Father, in order that they may becomeable fully to respond to his love and share in his compassionate service ofothers. The \"rain cloud\" is a beautiful hymn to the grace of the Buddha thatgently spreads over all the world and is able to meet the need of every parchedliving soul, whatever that need may be.These parables are taken from the Lotus of the Wonderful Law. This sutraprovides the basis for the distinctive philosophy of the Tien Tax School ofChinese Buddhism and the Nichiren School in Japan.\"The dull, who delight in petty rules, Who are greedily attached to mortality,Who have not, under countless Buddhas, Walked the profound and mystic Way, Whoare harassed by all the sufferings— To these I (at first) preach Nirvana. Suchis the expedient I employ To lead them to Buddha-wisdom. Not yet could I say tothem,220 Edwin A. Burtt'You all shall attain to Buddhahood,'For the time had not yet arrived.But now the very time has comeAnd I must preach the Great Vehicle. ...\"\"Have I not before said that the Buddhas, the World-honoured Ones, with avariety of reasonings, parables and terms, preach the Law as may be expedient,with the aim of final Perfect Enlightenment? All their teachings are for thepurpose of transforming [their disciples into] bodhisattvas. But Sariputra! Letme again in a parable make this meaning still more clear, for intelligentpeople, through a parable, reach understanding.\"PARABLE OF THE BURNING HOUSE\"Sariputra! Suppose, in a [certain] kingdom, city, or town, there is a greatelder, old and worn, of boundless wealth, and possessing many fields, houses,slaves, and servants. His house is spacious and large, but it has only one door,and many people dwell in it, one hundred, two hundred, or even five hundred innumber. Its halls and chambers are decayed and old, its walls crumbling down,the bases of its pillars rotten, the beams and roof-trees toppling anddangerous. On every side, at the same moment, fire suddenly starts and the houseis in conflagration. The boys of the elder, say ten, twenty, or even thirty, arein the dwelling. The elder, on seeing this conflagration spring up on everyside, is greatly startled and reflects thus: 'Though I am able to get safely outof the gate of this burning house, yet my boys in the burning house arepleasurably absorbed in amusements without apprehension, knowledge, surprise, orfear. Though the fire is pressing upon them and pain and suffering are instant,they do not mind or fear and have no impulse to escape.'\"Sariputra! This elder ponders thus: 1 am strong in my body and arms. Shall Iget them out of the house by means of a flower-vessel, or a bench, or a table?'Again he ponders: 'This house has only one gate, which moreover is narrow andsmall. My children are young, knowing nothing as yet, and attached to theirplace of play; perchance they will fall into the fire and be burnt. I must speakto them on this dreadful matter [warning them] that the house is burning, andthat they must come out instantly lest they are burnt and injured by the fire.'Having reflected thus, according to his thoughts, he calls to his children:'Come out quickly, all of you!'\"Though their father, in his pity, lures and admonishes with kind words, yet thechildren, joyfully absorbed in their play, are unwilling to believe him and haveneither surprise nor fear, nor any mind to escape; moreover, they do not knowwhat is the fire [he means], or what the house, and what he means by being lost,but only run hither and thither in play, no more than glancing at their father.Then the elder reflects thus: 'This house is burning in a great conflagration.If I and my children do not get out at once, we shall certainly be burnt up byit. Let me now, by some expedient, cause my children to escape this disaster.'Knowing that to which each of his children is predisposed, and all the variousattractive playthings and curiosities to which their natures will joyfullyrespond, the father tells them, saying: '[Here are] rare and precious things foryour amusement—if you do not [come] and get them, you will be sorry for itafterwards. So many goat-carts, deer-carts, and bullock-carts are now outsidethe gate to play with. All of you come quickly out of this burning house, and Iwill give you whatever you want.' Thereupon the children, hearing of theattractive playthings mentioned by their father, and because they suit theirwishes, every one eagerly, each pushing the other, and racing one againstanother, comes rushing out of the burning house.\"Then the elder, seeing that his children have safely escaped and are all in thesquare, sits down in the open, no longer embarrassed, but with a mind at easeand ecstatic with joy. Then each of the children says to the father: 'Father!Please now give us those playthings you promised us—goat-carts, deer-carts, andbullock-carts.' Sariputra! Then the elder gives to his children equally each agreat cart, lofty and spacious, adorned with all the precious things, surroundedwith railed seats, hung with bells on its four sides, and covered with curtains,splendidly decorated also with various rare and precious things, draped withstrings of precious stones, hung with garlands of flowers, thickly spread withbeautiful mats, and supplied with rosy pillows. It is yoked with white bullocksof pure [white] skin, of handsome appearance, and of great muscular power, whichwalk with even steps, and with the speed of the wind, and also it has manyservants and followers to guard them. Wherefore? Because this great elder is ofboundless wealth and all his various storehouses are full to overflowing. So hereflects thus: 'My possessions being boundless, I must not give my childreninferior small carts. All these children are my sons, whom I love withoutpartiality. Having such great carts made of the seven precious things, infinitein number, I should with equal mind bestow them on each one withoutdiscrimination. Wherefore? Because, were I to give them to the whole nation,these things of mine would not run short—how much less so to my children!Meanwhile, each of the children rides on his great cart, having received thatwhich he had never before had and never expected to have.'\"Sariputra! What is your opinion? Has that elder, in [only] giving great cartsof the precious substances to his children equally, been in any way guilty offalsehood?\"\"No, World-honoured One!\" says Sariputra. \"That elder only caused his childrento escape the disaster of fire and preserved their bodies alive—he committed nofalsity. Why? He thus preserved their bodies alive, and in addition gave themthe playthings they obtained; moreover, it was by his expedient that he savedthem from that burning house! World-honoured One! Even if that elder did notgive them one of the smallest carts, still he is not false. Wherefore? Becausethat elder from the first formed this intention, 'I will, by an expedient, causemy children to escape.' For this reason he is not false. How much less so seeingthat, knowing his own boundless wealth and desiring to benefit his children, hegives them great carts equally!\"\"Good! Good!\" replies the Buddha to Sariputra. \"It is even as you say.Sariputra! The Tathagata is also like this, for he is the Father of all worlds,who hasforever entirely ended all fear, despondency, distress, ignorance, andenveloping darkness, and has perfected boundless knowledge, strength, andfearlessness. He is possessed of great supernatural power and wisdom-power, hascompletely attained the Paramitas 1 of adaptability and wisdom, and is thegreatly merciful and greatly compassionate, ever tireless, ever seeking thegood, and benefiting all beings. He is born in this triple world, the olddecayed burning house, to save all living creatures from the fires of birth,age, disease, death, grief, suffering, foolishness, darkness, and the ThreePoisons, 2 and teach them to obtain Perfect Enlightenment. He sees how allliving creatures are scorched by the fires of birth, age, disease, death, grief,and sorrow, and suffer all kinds of distress by reason of the five desires andthe greed of gain; and how, by reason of the attachments of desire and itspursuits, they now endure much suffering and hereafter will suffer in hell, oras animals or hungry spirits. Even if they are born in a heaven, or amongst men,there are all kinds of sufferings, such as the bitter straits of poverty, thebitterness of parting from loved ones, the bitterness of association with thedetestable. Absorbed in these things, all living creatures rejoice and taketheir pleasure, while they neither apprehend, nor perceive, are neither alarmed,nor fear, and are without satiety, never seeking to escape, but, in the burninghouse of this triple world are running to and fro, and although they will meetwith great suffering, count it not as cause for anxiety.\"Sariputra! The Buddha, having seen this, reflects thus: 1 am the Father of allcreatures and must snatch them from suffering and give them the bliss of theinfinite, boundless Buddha-wisdom for them to play with.'\"Sariputra! The Tathagata again reflects thus: If I only use supernatural powerand wisdom, casting aside every tactful method, and extend to all livingcreatures the wisdom, power, and fearlessness of the Tathagata, the livingcreatures cannot by this method be saved. Wherefore? As long as all thesecreatures have not escaped birth, age, disease, death, grief, and suffering, butare being burnt in the burning house of the triple world, how can theyunderstand the Buddha-wisdom?'\"Sariputra! Even as that elder, though with strength in body and arms, yet doesnot use it, but only by diligent tact, resolutely saves his children from thecalamity of the burning house, and then gives each of them great carts adornedwith precious things, so is it with the Tathagata. Though he has power andfearlessness, he does not use them, but only by his wise tact does he remove andsave all living creatures from the burning house of the triple world, preachingthe Three-Vehicles, viz. the Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, and Buddha vehicles. Andthus he speaks to them: 'Ye all! Delight not to dwell in the burning house ofthe triple world. Do not hanker after its crude forms, sounds, odours, flavours,and contacts. For if, through hankering, ye beget a love of it, then ye will beburnt by it. Get ye out with haste from the triple world and take to theThree-Vehicles, viz, the Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, and Buddha Vehicles. I nowgive you my pledge for this, and it will never prove false. Be only diligent andzealous!' By these expedients does the Tathagata lure all creatures forth, andagain speaks thus: 'Know ye! All these Three-Vehicles are praised by sages: inthem you will be free and independent, without wanting to rely on aught else.Riding in these Three-Vehicles, by means of perfect faculties, powers,perceptions, ways, concentrations, emancipations, and samadhis, 3 ye will, as amatter of course, be happy and gain infinite peace and joy.'\"Sariputra! If there are living beings who have a spirit of wisdom within and,following the Buddha, the World-honoured One, hear the Law, receive it in faith,and zealously make progress, desiring speedily to escape from the triple worldand seeking Nirvana for themselves—this [type] is called the Sravaka-Vehicle,just as some of those children come out of the burning house for the sake of agoat-cart. If there are living beings who, following the Buddha, theWorld-honoured One, hear the Law, receive it in faith, and zealously makeprogress, seeking self-gained Wisdom, taking pleasure in becoming good and calm,and deeply versed in the causes and reasons of the laws—this type is called thePratyekabuddha-Vehicle, just as some of those children come out of the burninghouse for the sake of a deer-cart. If there are living beings who, following theBuddha, the World-honoured One, hear the Law, receive it in faith, diligentlypractise and zealously advance, seeking the Complete Wisdom, Buddha-Wisdom, theNatural Wisdom, the Masterless Wisdom, and Tathagata knowledge, powers, andfearlessness, who take pity on and comfort innumerable creatures, benefit devasand men, and save all beings—this type is called the Great Vehicle. Becausebodhisattvas seek this vehicle, they are named mahasattvas. They are like thosechildren who come out of the burning house for the sake of a bullock-cart.\"Sariputra! Just as that elder, seeing his children get out of the burning housesafely to a place free from fear, and pondering on his immeasurable wealth,gives each of his children a great cart, so also is it with the Tathagata. Beingthe Father of all living creatures, if he sees infinite thousands of kotis 4 ofcreatures, by the teaching of the Buddha, escape from the suffering of thetriple world, from fearful and perilous paths, and gain the joys of Nirvana, theTathagata then reflects thus: 1 possess infinite, boundless wisdom, power,fearlessness, and other Law-treasuries of Buddhas. All these living creaturesare my children to whom I will equally give the Great Vehicle, so that none willgain an individual Nirvana, but all gain Nirvana by the same Nirvana as theTathagata. All these living creatures who escape the triple world are given theplaythings of Buddhas, viz. concentrations, emancipations, and so forth, all ofthe same pattern and of one kind, praised by sages and able to produce pure,supreme pleasure.\"Sariputra! Even as that elder at first attracted his children by the threecarts, and afterwards gave them only a great cart magnificently adorned withprecious things and supremely comfortable, yet that elder is not guilty offalsehood, so also is it with the Tathagata; there is no falsehood in firstpreaching Three-Vehicles to attract all living creatures and afterwards insaving them by the Great Vehicle only. Wherefore? Because the Tathagatapossesses infinite wisdom, power, fearlessness, and the treasury of the laws,and is able to give all living creatures the Great Vehicle Law; but not all areable to receive it. Sariputra! For this reason know that Buddhas, by theiradaptability, in the One Buddha-Vehicle define and expound the Three. . . .\"Though Buddhas, the World-honoured,Convert by expedient methods,Yet the living they convertAre indeed all bodhisattvas.To such as are of little wit,Deeply attached to desire and passion,The Buddha, for their sake,Preaches the Truth about Suffering,And all the living joyfullyAttain the unprecedented.The Buddha's Truth about Suffering, Is real without distinction. Those livingbeings who Know not the root of suffering, Cling to the cause of suffering,Unable to leave it a moment. Again, for the sake of these, He preaches the Truthwith tact (saying): \"The cause of all suffering Is rooted in desire.\" If desirebe extinguished, Suffering has no foothold. To annihilate suffering Is calledthe Third Truth. For the sake of the Truth of Extinction, To cultivate oneselfin the Way, Forsaking all ties to suffering, This is called Emancipation. Fromwhat then have these people Attained Emancipation? Merely to depart from thefalse They call Emancipation; But in truth that is not yet CompleteEmancipation.So Buddha declares: \"These people Have not reached real extinction; Becausethese people have not yet Gained the Supreme Way, I am unwilling to declare Thatthey have attained extinction. I am the King of the Law, Absolute in regard tothe Law, For comforting all creatures I appear in the world.\"Sariputra! This, My final Seal of the Law, Because of my desire to benefit Allthe world, is now announced; Wherever you may wander,Do not carelessly proclaim it. If there be hearers who joyfully Receive it withdeep obeisance, You may know those people Are Avinivartaniyah. 5 If there be anywho receive This Sutra-Law in faith, These people must already Have seen Buddhasof past times, Revered and worshipped them And listened to this Law. If there beany who are able To believe in your preaching, They must formerly have seen me,And also have seen you, And these bhikshu-monks, As well as these bodhisattvas.\"This Law-Flower Sutra Is addressed to the truly wise; Men shallow of knowledgehearing it, Go astray, not understanding. All the Sravakas, And Pratyekabuddhas,Cannot by their powers Attain unto this Sutra. Sariputra!Even you, into this Sutra Enter only by faith, Much more must the otherSravakas. The other Sravakas, By believing the Buddha's words, Obediently followthis Sutra, Not by wisdom they have of their own.\"THE PRODIGAL SON AND THE SEEKING FATHER\"It is like a youth who, on attaining manhood, leaves his father and runs away.For long he dwells in some other country, ten, twenty, or fifty years. The olderhe grows, the more needy he becomes. Roaming about in all directions to seekclothing and food, he gradually wanders along till he unexpectedly approacheshis native country. From the first the father searched for his son, but in vain,and meanwhile has settled in a certain city. His home becomes very rich; hisgoods and treasures are incalculable; gold, silver, lapis lazuli, corals, amber,crystal, and other gems so increase that his treasuries overflow; many othersand slaves has he, retainers and attendants, and countless elephants, horses,carriages, animals to ride, and kine and sheep. His revenues and investmentsspread to other countries, and his traders and customers are many in theextreme.\"At this time, the poor son, wandering through village after village, andpassing through countries and cities, at last reached the city where his fatherhas settled. Always has the father been thinking of his son, yet, though he hasbeen parted from him over fifty years, he has never spoken of the matter to anyone, only pondering over it within himself and cherishing regret in his heart,as he reflects: 'Old and worn, I own much wealth; gold, silver, and jewels,granaries and treasuries overflowing; but I have no son. Some day my end willcome and my wealth be scattered and lost, for there is no one to whom I canleave it.' Thus does he often think of his son, and earnestly repeats thisreflection: 'If I could only get back my son and commit my wealth to him, howcontented and happy should I be, with never a further anxiety!'\"World-honoured One! Meanwhile the poor son, hired for wages here and there,unexpectedly arrives at his father's house. Standing by the gate, he sees fromafar his father seated on a lion-couch, his feet on a jewelled footstool,revered and surrounded by brahmanas, kshatriyas, 6 and citizens, and withstrings of pearls, worth thousands and myraids, adorning his body; attendantsand young slaves with white chowries wait upon him right and left; he is coveredby a rich canopy from which hang streamers of flowers; perfume is sprinkled onthe earth, all kinds of famous flowers are scattered around, and precious thingsare placed in rows for his acceptance or rejection. Such is his glory, and thehonour of his dignity. The poor son, seeing his father possessed of such greatpower, is seized with fear, regretting that he has come to this place, andsecretly reflects thus: 'This must be a king, or some one of royal rank; it isno place for me to obtain anything for the hire of my labour. I had better go tosome poor hamlet, where there is a place for letting out my labour, and food andclothing are easier to get. If I tarry here long, I may suffer oppression andforced service.'\"Having reflected thus, he hastens away. Meanwhile, the rich elder on hislion-seat has recognized his son at first sight, and with great joy in his hearthas also reflected: 'Now I have some one to whom my treasuries of wealth are tobe made over. Always have I been thinking of this my son, with no means ofseeing him; but suddenly he himself has come and my longing is satisfied. Thoughworn with years, I yearn for him as of old.'\"Instantly he dispatches his attendants to pursue him quickly and fetch himback. Thereupon the messengers hasten forth to seize him. The poor son,surprised and scared, loudly cries his complaint: I have committed no offenceagainst you; why should I be arrested?' The messengers all the more hasten tolay hold of him and compel him to go back. Thereupon, the poor son, thinkingwithin himself that though he is innocent yet he will be imprisoned, and thatnow he will surely die, is all the more terrified; he faints away and fallsprostrate on the ground. The father, seeing this from afar, sends word to themessengers: 'I have no need for this man. Do not bring him by force. Sprinklecold water on his face to restore him to consciousness and do not speak to himany further.' Wherefore? The father, knowing that his son's disposition isinferior, knowing that hisown lordly position has caused distress to his son, yet convinced that he is hisson, tactfully does not say to others: 'This is my son.'\"A messenger says to the son: 'I now set you free; go wherever you will.' Thepoor son is delighted, thus obtaining the unexpected. He rises from the groundand goes to a poor hamlet in search of food and clothing. Then the elder,desiring to attract his son, sets up a device. Secretly he sends two men,doleful and shabby in appearance, saying—'You go and visit that place and gentlysay to the poor man—\"There is a place for you to work here; you will be givendouble wages.\" If the poor man agrees, bring him back and give him work. If heasks what work you wish him to do, then you may say to him—\"We will hire you forscavenging, and we both also will work along with you\".' Then the two messengersgo in search of the poor son and, having found him, place before him the aboveproposal. Thereupon the poor son, having received his wages beforehand, joinswith them in removing a dirt-heap.\"His father, beholding the son, is struck with compassion for, and wonder at,him. Another day he sees at a distance, through a window, his son's figure,gaunt, lean, and doleful, filthy and unclean with dirt and dust; thereupon hetakes off his strings of jewels, his soft attire, and ornaments, and puts on acoarse, torn, and dirty garment, smears his body with dust, takes a dust-hod inhis right hand, and with an appearance fear-inspiring says to the labourers:'Get on with your work, don't be lazy.' By such a device he gets near to hisson, to whom he afterwards says: 'Aye, my man, you stay and work here, do not goagain elsewhere; I will increase your wages; give whatever you need, bowls,utensils, rice, wheat-flour, salt, vinegar, and so on; have no hesitation;besides, there is an old and worn-out servant whom you shall be given if youneed him. Be at ease in your mind; I am, as it were, your father; do not beworried again. Wherefore? I am old and advanced in years, but you are young andvigorous; all the time you have been working, you have never been deceitful,lazy, angry or grumbling; I have never seen you, like the other laborourers,with such vices as these. From this time forth you shall be as my own begottenson.'\"Thereupon the elder gives him a new name and calls him a son. The poor son,though he rejoices at this happening, still thinks of himself as a humblehireling. For this reason, during twenty years he continues to be employed inscavenging. After this period, there grows mutual confidence between them, andhe goes in and out and is at his ease, though his abode is still the originalplace.\"World-honoured One! Then the elder becomes ill and, knowing that he will diebefore long, says to the poor son: 'Now I possess abundance of gold, silver, andprecious things, and my granaries and treasuries are full to overflowing. Thequantities of these things, and the amounts which should be received and given,I want you to understand in detail. Such is my mind, and you must agree to thismy wish. Wherefore? Because, now, I and you are of the same mind. Beincreasingly careful so that there be no waste.'\"The poor son accepts his instruction and commands, and becomes acquainted withall the goods, gold, silver, and precious things, as well as all the228 Edwin A. Burttgranaries and treasuries, but has no idea of expecting to inherit so much as ameal, while his abode is still the original place and he is yet unable toabandon his sense of inferiority.\"After a short time has again passed, the father, knowing that his son's ideashave gradually been enlarged, his aspirations developed, and that he despiseshis previous state of mind, on seeing that his own end is approaching, commandshis son to come, and gathers together his relatives, and the kings, ministers,kshatriyas, and citizens. When they are all assembled, he thereupon addressesthem saying: 'Now, gentlemen, this is my son, begotten by me. It is over fiftyyears since, from a certain city, he left me and ran away to endure lonelinessand misery. His former name was so-and-so and my name was so-and-so. At thattime in that city I sought him sorrowfully. Suddenly in this place I met andregained him. This is really my son and I am really his father. Now all thewealth which I possess entirely belongs to my son, and all my previousdisbursements and receipts ar^ known by this son.'\"World-honoured One! When the poor son heard these words of his father, greatwas his joy at such unexpected news, and thus he thought: 'Without any mind for,or effort on my part, these treasures now come of themselves to me.'\"World-honoured One! The very rich elder is the Tathagata, and we are all as theBuddha's sons. The Tathagata has always declared that we are his sons.World-honoured One! Because of the three sufferings, in the midst of births anddeaths we have borne all kinds of torments, being deluded and ignorant andenjoying our attachment to trifles. To-day the World-honoured One has caused usto ponder over and remove the dirt of all diverting discussions of inferiorthings. In these we have hitherto been diligent to make progress, and have got,as it were, a day's pay for our effort to reach Nirvana. Obtaining this, wegreatly rejoiced and were contented, saying to ourselves: 'For our diligence andprogress in the Buddha-law, what we have received is ample.' But theWorld-honoured One, knowing beforehand that our minds were attached to lowdesires and took delight in inferior things, let us go our own way, and did notdiscriminate for us, saying: 'You shall yet have possession of the treasure ofTathagata-knowledge.' The World-honoured One, in his tactfulness, told of theTathagata-wisdom; but we, though following the Buddha and receiving a day's wageof Nirvana, deemed this a sufficient gain, never having a mind to seek after theGreat Vehicle. We, also, have declared and expounded the Tathagata-wisdom tobodhisattvas, but in regard to this Great Vehicle we have never had a longingfor it. Wherefore? The Buddha, knowing that our minds delighted in inferiorthings, by his tactfulness taught according to our capacity, but still we didnot perceive that we were really Buddha-sons.\"Now we have just realized that the World-honoured One does not grudge even theBuddha-wisdom. Wherefore? From of old we are really sons of Buddha, but haveonly taken pleasure in minor matters; if we had had a mind to take pleasure inthe Great, the Buddha would have preached the Great Vehicle Law to us. Atlength, in this Sutra, he preaches only the One Vehicle; and though formerly, inthe presence of bodhisattvas, he spoke disparagingly of sravakas who werepleased with minor matters, yet the Buddha had in reality been in-structing them in the Great Vehicle. Therefore we say that though we had no mindto hope or expect it, yet now the Great Treasure of the King of the Law has ofitself come to us, and such things as Buddha-sons should obtain, we have allobtained.\"NOTES1 Ideal perfections or virtues.2 Sensual longing, ignorance, desire for continued separate existence.3 Ecstatic contemplation or meditation.4 Huge numbers.5 Such as never return to the realm of mortal existence.6 Members of the second highest caste.The Great RetirementHENRY CLARKE WARRENTranslated from the Introduction to the JatakaHenry Clarke Warrens work was originally published in Harvard University'sclassic series, The Sacred Books of the East. His excellent translations fromthe original Pali give us the opportunity to appreciate one of the primarysources on which the Buddhist tradition is based. The Buddha's \"retirement\" or\"renunciation\" was the turning point or \"life crisis\" in his life. In theprocess of working out this life crisis, Guatama (Buddha) discovered the basicprinciples of Buddhism. \"The Great Retirement\" is the complex event of theBuddha's decision to embark on his heroic quest.IN ow on a certain day the Future Buddha wished to go to the park, and told hischarioteer to make ready the chariot. Accordingly the man brought out asumptuous and elegant chariot, and adorning it richly, he harnessed to it fourstate-horses of the Sindhava breed, as white as the petals of the white lotus,and announced to the Future Buddha that everything was ready. And the FutureBuddha mounted the chariot, which was like to a palace of the gods, andproceeded towards the park.\"The time for the enlightenment of prince Siddhattha draweth nigh,\" thought thegods; \"we must show him a sign:\" and they changed one of theirnumber into a decrepit old man, broken-toothed, gray-haired, crooked and bent ofbody, leaning on a staff, and trembling, and showed him to the Future Buddha,but so that only he and the charioteer saw him.Then said the Future Buddha to the charioteer, in the manner related in theMahapadana,—\"Friend, pray, who is this man? Even his hair is not like that of other men.\"And when he heard the answer, he said, \"Shame on birth, since to every one thatis born old age must come.\" And agitated in heart, he thereupon returned andascended his palace.\"Why has my son returned so quickly?\" asked the king.\"Sire, he has seen an old man,\" was the reply; \"and because he has seen an oldman, he is about to retire from the world.\"\"Do you want to kill me, that you say such things? Quickly get ready some playsto be performed before my son. If we can but get him to enjoying pleasure, hewill cease to think of retiring from the world.\" Then the king extended theguard to half a league in each direction.Again, on a certain day, as the Future Buddha was going to the park, he saw adiseased man whom the gods had fashioned; and having again made inquiry, hereturned, agitated in heart, and ascended his palace.And the king made the same inquiry and gave the same orders as before; and againextending the guard, placed them for three quarters of a league around.And again on a certain day, as the Future Buddha was going to the park, he saw adead man whom the gods had fashioned; and having again made inquiry, hereturned, agitated in heart, and ascended his palace.And the king made the same inquiry and gave the same orders as before; and againextending the guard, placed them for a league around.And again on a certain day, as the Future Buddha was going to the park, he saw amonk, carefully and decently clad, whom the gods had fashioned; and he asked hischarioteer, \"Pray, who is this man?\"Now although there was no Buddha in the world, and the charioteer had noknowledge of either monks or their good qualities, yet by the power of the godshe was inspired to say, \"Sire, this is one who has retired from the world;\" andhe thereupon proceeded to sound the praises of retirement from the world. Thethought of retiring from the world was a pleasing one to the Future Buddha, andthis day he went on until he came to the park. The repeaters of the Digha,however, say that he w?nt to the park after having seen all the Four Signs onone and the same day.When he had disported himself there throughout the day, and had bathed in theroyal pleasure-tank, he went at sunset and sat down on the royal resting-stonewith the intention of adorning himself. Then gathered around him his attendantswith diverse-colored cloths, many kinds and styles of ornaments, and withgarlands, perfumes, and ointments. At that instant the throne on which Sakka wassitting grew hot. And Sakka, considering who it could be that was desirous ofdislodging him, perceived that it was the time of the adornment of a FutureBuddha. And addressing Vissakamma, he said,—\"My good Vissakamma, to-night, in the middle watch, prince Siddhattha will goforth on the Great Retirement, and this is his last adorning of himself. Go tothe park, and adorn that eminent man with celestial ornaments.\"\"Very well,\" said Vissakamma, in assent; and came on the instant, by hissuperhuman power, into the presence of the Future Buddha. And assuming the guiseof a barber, he took from the real barber the turban-cloth, and began to wind itround the Future Buddha's head; but as soon as the future Buddha felt the touchof his hand, he knew that it was no man, but a god.Now once round his head took up a thousand cloths, and the fold was like to acirclet of precious stones; the second time round took another thousand cloths,and so on, until ten times round had taken up ten thousand cloths. Now let noone think, \"How was it possible to use so many cloths on one small head?\" forthe very largest of them all had only the size of a sama-creeper blossom, andthe others that of Kutumbaka flowers. Thus the Future Buddha's head resembled akuyyaka blossom twisted about with lotus filaments.And having adorned himself with great richness,—while adepts in different kindsof tabors and tom-toms were showing their skill, and Brahmans with cries ofvictory and joy, and bards and poets with propitious words and shouts of praisesaluted him,—he mounted his superbly decorated chariot.At this juncture, Suddhodana the king, having heard that the mother of Rahulahad brought forth a son, sent a messenger, saying, \"Announce the glad news to myson.\"On hearing the message, the Future Buddha said, \"An impediment [rahula] has beenborn; a fetter has been born.\"\"What did my son say?\" questioned the king; and when he had heard the answer, hesaid, \"My grandson's name shall be prince Rahula from this very day.\"But the Future Buddha in his splendid chariot entered the city with a pomp andmagnificence of glory that enraptured all minds. At the same moment Kisa Gotami,a virgin of the warrior caste, ascended to the roof of her palace, and beheldthe beauty and majesty of the Future Buddha, as he circumambulated the city; andin her pleasure and satisfaction at the sight, she burst forth into this song ofjoy:—\"Full happy now that mother is, Full happy now that father is, Full happy nowthat woman is, Who owns this lord so glorious!\"On hearing this, the Future Buddha thought, \"In beholding a handsome figure theheart of a mother attains Nirvana, the heart of a father attains Nirvana, theheart of a wife attains Nirvana. This is what she says. But wherein does Nirvanaconsist?\" And to him, whose mind was already averse to passion, the answer came:\"When the fire of lust is extinct, that is Nirvana; when the fires of hatred andinfatuation are extinct, that is Nirvana; when pride, false belief, and allother passions and torments are extinct, that is Nirvana. She has taught me agood lesson. Certainly, Nirvana is what I am looking for. It behooves me thisvery day to quit the household life, and to retire from the world in quest ofNirvana. 1 I will send this lady a teacher's fee.\" And loosening from his neck apearl necklace worth a hundred thousand pieces of money, he sent it to KisaGotaml. And great was her satisfaction at this, for she thought, \"PrinceSiddhat-tha has fallen in love with me, and has sent me a present.\"And the Future Buddha entered his palace in great splendor, and lay on his couchof state. And straightway richly dressed women, skilled in all manner of danceand song, and beautiful as celestial nymphs, gathered about him with all kindsof musical instruments, and with dance, song, and music they endeavored toplease him. But the Future Buddha's aversion to passion did not allow him totake pleasure in the spectacle, and he fell into a brief slumber. And the women,exclaiming, \"He for whose sake we should perform has fallen asleep. Of what useis it to weary ourselves any longer?\" threw their various instruments on theground, and lay down. And the lamps fed with sweet-smelling oil continued toburn. And the Future Buddha awoke, and seating himself cross-legged on hiscouch, perceived these women lying asleep, with their musical instrumentsscattered about them on the floor,—some with their bodies wet with tricklingphlegm and spittle; some grinding their teeth, and muttering and talking intheir sleep; some with their mouths open; and some with their dress fallen apartso as plainly to disclose their loathsome nakedness. This great alteration intheir appearance still further increased his aversion for sensual pleasures. Tohim that magnificent apartment, as splendid as the palace of Sakka, began toseem like a cemetery filled with dead bodies impaled and left to rot; and thethree modes of existence appeared like houses all ablaze. And breathing forththe solemn utterance, \"How oppressive and stifling is it all!\" his mind turnedardently to retiring from the world. \"It behooves me to go forth on the GreatRetirement this very day,\" said he; and he arose from his couch, and coming nearthe door, called out,—\"Who's there?\"\"Master, it is I, Channa,\" replied the courtier who had been sleeping with hishead on the threshold. 2\"I wish to go forth on the Great Retirement to-day. Saddle a horse for me.\"\"Yes, sire.\" And taking saddle and bridle with him, the courtier started for thestable. There, by the light of lamps fed with sweet-smelling oils, he perceivedthe mighty steed Kanthaka in his pleasant quarters, under a canopy of clothbeautified with a pattern of jasmine flowers. \"This is the one for me to saddleto-day,\" though* he; and he saddled Kanthaka.\"He is drawing the girth very tight,\" thought Kanthaka, whilst he was beingsaddled; \"it is not at all as on other days, when I am saddled for rides in thepark and the like. It must be that to-day my master wishes to issue forth on theGreat Retirement.\" And in his delight he neighed a loud neigh. And that neighwould have spread through the whole town, had not the gods stopped the sound,and suffered no one to hear it.Now the Future Buddha, after he had sent Channa on his errand, thought tohimself, \"I will take just one look at my son;\" and, rising from the couch onwhich he was sitting, he went to the suite of apartments occupied by the motherof Rahula, and opened the door of her chamber. Within the chamber was burn-ing a lamp fed with sweet-smelling oil, and the mother of Rahula lay sleeping ona couch strewn deep with jasmine and other flowers, her hand resting on the headof her son. When the Future Buddha reached the threshold, he paused, and gazedat the two from where he stood.\"If I were to raise my wife's hand from off the child's head, and take him up,she would awake, and thus prevent my departure. I will first become a Buddha,and then come back and see my son.\" So saying, he descended from the palace.Now that which is said in the Jataka Commentary, \"At that time Rahula was sevendays old,\" is not found in the other commentaries. Therefore the account abovegiven is to be accepted.When the Future Buddha had thus descended from the palace, he came near to hishorse, and said,—\"My dear Kanthaka, save me now this one night; and then, when thanks to you Ihave become a Buddha, I will save the world of gods and men.\" And thereupon hevaulted upon Kanthaka's back.Now Kanthaka was eighteen cubits long from his neck to his tail, and ofcorresponding height; he was strong and swift, and white all over like apolished conch-shell. If he neighed or stamped, the sound was so loud as tospread through the whole city; therefore the gods exerted their power, andmuffled the sound of his neighing, so that no one heard it; and at every step hetook they placed the palms of their hands under his feet.The Future Buddha rode on the mighty back of the mighty steed, made Channa holdon by the tail, and so arrived at midnight at the great gate of the city.Now the king, in order that the Future Buddha should not at any time go out ofthe city without his knowledge, had caused each of the two leaves of the gate tobe made so heavy as to need a thousand men to move it. But the Future Buddha hada vigor and a strength that was equal, when reckoned in elephant-power, to thestrength often thousand million elephants, and, reckoned in manpower, to thestrength of a hundred thousand million men.\"If,\" thought he, \"the gate does not open, I will straightway grip tight hold ofKanthaka with my thighs, and, seated as I am on Kanthaka's back, and with Channaholding on by the tail, I will leap up and carry them both with me over thewall, although its height be eighteen cubits.\"\"If,\" thought Channa, \"the gate is not opened, I will place my master on myshoulder, and tucking Kanthaka under my arm by passing my right hand round himand under his belly, I will leap up and carry them both with me over the wall.\"\"If,\" thought Kanthaka, \"the gate is not opened, with my master seated as he ison my back, and with Channa holding on by my tail, I will leap up and carry themboth with me over the wall.\"Now if the gate had not opened, verily one or another of these three personswould have accomplished that whereof he thought; but the divinity that inhabitedthe gate opened it for them.At this moment came Mara, 3 with the intention of persuading the Future Buddhato turn back; and standing in the air, he said,—\"Sir, go not forth! For on the seventh day from now the wheel of empire willappear to you, and you shall rule over the four great continents and their twothousand attendant isles. Sir, turn back!\"\"Who are you?\"\"I am Vasavatti.\"\"Mara, I knew that the wheel of empire was on the point of appearing to me; butI do not wish for sovereignty. I am about to cause the ten thousand worlds tothunder with my becoming a Buddha.\"\"I shall catch you,\" thought Mara, \"the very first time you have a lustful,malicious, or unkind thought.\" And, like an ever-present shadow, he followedafter, ever on the watch for some slip.Thus the Future Buddha, casting away with indifference a universal sovereigntyalready in his grasp,—spewing it out as if it were but phlegm,—departed from thecity in great splendor on the full-moon day of the month Asalhl, 4 when the moonwas in Libra. And when he had gone out from the city, he became desirous oflooking back at it; but no sooner had the thought arisen in his mind, than thebroad earth, seeming to fear lest the Great Being might neglect to perform theact of looking back, split and turned round like a potter's wheel. 5 When theFuture Buddha had stood a while facing the city and gazing upon it, and hadindicated in that place the spot for the \"Shrine of the Turning Back ofKanthaka,\" he turned Kanthaka in the direction in which he meant to go, andproceeded on his way in great honor and exceeding glory.For they say the deities bore sixty thousand torches in front of him, and sixtythousand behind him, and sixty thousand on the right hand, and sixty thousand onthe left hand. Other deities, standing on the rim of the world, bore torchespast all numbering; and still other deities, as well as serpents and birds,accompanied him, and did him homage with heavenly perfumes, garlands,sandal-wood powder, and incense. And the sky was as full of coral flowers as itis of pouring water at the height of the rainy season. Celestial choruses wereheard; and on every side bands of music played, some of eight instruments, andsome of sixty,—sixty-eight hundred thousand instruments in all. It was as whenthe storm-clouds thunder on the sea, or when the ocean roars against theYugand-hara rocks.Advancing in this glory, the Future Buddha in one night passed through threekingdoms, and at the end of thirty leagues he came to the river named Anoma.But was this as far as the horse could go? Certainly not. For he was able totravel round the world from end to end, as it were round the rim of a wheellying on its hub, and yet get back before breakfast and eat the food preparedfor him. But on this occasion the fragrant garlands and other offerings whichthe gods and the serpents and the birds threw down upon him from the sky buriedhim up to his haunches; and as he was obliged to drag his body and cut his waythrough the tangled mass, he was greatly delayed. Hence it was that he went onlythirty leagues.And the Future Buddha, stopping on the river-bank, said to Channa,—\"What is the name of this river?\"\"Sire, its name is Anoma [Illustrious].\"\"And my retirement from the world shall also be called Anoma,\" replied theFuture Buddha. Saying this, he gave the signal to his horse with his heel; andthe horse sprang over the river, which had a breadth of eight usabhas, 6 andlandedon the opposite bank. And the Future Buddha, dismounting and standing on thesand> beach that stretched away like a sheet of silver, said to Channa,—\"My good Channa, take these ornaments and Kanthaka and go home. I am about toretire from the world.\"\"Sire, I also will retire from the world.\"Three times the Future Buddha refused him, saying, \"It is not for you to retirefrom the world. Go now!\" and made him take the ornaments and Kanthaka.Next he thought, \"These locks of mine are not suited to a monk; but there is noone fit to cut the hair of a Future Buddha. Therefore I will cut them off myselfwith my sword.\" And grasping a simitar with his right hand, he seized histopknot with his left hand, and cut it off, together with the diadem. His hairthus became two finger-breadths in length, and curling to the right, lay closeto his head. As long as he lived it remained of that length, and the beard wasproportionate. And never again did he have to cut either hair or beard."},{"pageContent":"Then the Future Buddha seized hold of his top-knot and diadem, and threw theminto the air, saying,—\"If I am to become a Buddha, let them stay in the sky; butif not, let them fall to the ground.\"The top-knot and jewelled turban mounted for a distance of a league into theair, and there came to a stop. And Sakka, the king of the gods, perceiving themwith his divine eye, received them in an appropriate jewelled casket, andestablished it in the Heaven of the Thirty-three as the \"Shrine of the Diadem.\"\"His hair he cut, so sweet with many pleasant scents, This Chief of Men, andhigh impelled it towards the sky; And there god Yasava, the god with thousandeyes. In golden casket caught it. bowing low his head.\"Again the Future Buddha thought, \"These garments of mine, made of Benares cloth,are not suited to a monk.\"Now the Maha-Brahma god, Ghatikara, who had been a friend of his in the time ofthe Buddha Kassapa, and whose affection for him had not grown old in the longinterval since that Buddha, thought to himself,—\"To-day my friend has gone forth on the Great Retirement. I will bring him therequisites of a monk.\"\"Robes, three in all, the bowl for alms, The razor, needle, and the belt, Andwater-strainer,—just these eight Are needed by th' ecstatic monk.\"Taking the above eight requisites of a monk, he gave them to him.When the Future Buddha had put on this most excellent vesture, the symbol ofsaintship and of retirement from the world, he dismissed Channa, saying,—\"Channa, go tell my father and my mother from me that I am well.\" And Channa didobeisance to the Future Buddha; and keeping his right side towards him, hedeparted.But Kanthaka, who had stood listening to the Future Buddha while he wasconferring with Channa, was unable to bear his grief at the thought, \"I shallnever see my master any more.\" And as he passed out of sight, his heart burst,and he died, and was reborn in the Heaven of the Thirty-three as the godKanthaka.At first the grief of Channa had been but single; but now he was oppressed witha second sorrow in the death of Kanthaka, and came weeping and wailing to thecity.NOTESJ The Future Buddha puns upon the word \"happy\" in Kisa Gotaml's verses. The wordin Pali is nibbuta, and is in form a past passive participle of a verb whichperhaps does not occur in Pali in any finite form, but which appears in Sanskritas nirvr. Now there is a Pali verb of which the third person singular presentindicative is nibbdyati, and from this verb is formed the verbal noun nibbdna(Sanskrit, Nirvana). Nibbuta is constantly made to do duty as past passiveparticiple to this verb, so that what would be the true form (nibbata) is neverfound. The Future Buddha therefore puns when he pretends that Kisa GotamI wasusing nibbuta as the participle of nibbdyati, and was urging him to Nirvana.The verb nibbdyati means \"to be extinguished,\" as the flame of a candle; and,when used as a metaphysical term, refers to the fires of lust, desire, etc. Andas when fire is extinguished coolness results (a consummation devoutly to bewished in a hot climate like India), the verb acquires the future meaning of \"beassuaged,\" \"become happy.\" And in like manner the verbal noun Nirvana (in Palinibbdna), meaning both literally and metaphorically \"becoming extinguished,\"comes to stand for the summum bonum.I add a retranslation of the passage, to show the punning meanings given by theFuture Buddha to the words, nibbuta, nibbdyati, and Nirvana:—\"Nirvana hath that mother gained, Nirvana hath that father gained, Nirvana haththat woman gained, Who owns this lord so glorious!\"On hearing this, the Future Buddha thought, \"In beholding a handsome form theheart of a mother is made happy (nibbdyati), the heart of a father is madehappy, the heart of a wife is made happy. This is what she says. But whereindoes happiness (nibbuta) consist?\" And to him whose mind was already averse topassion, the answer came: \"When the fire of lust is assuaged (nibbuta), that ishappiness (nibbuta); when the fires of hatred and infatuation are assuaged, thatis happiness; when pride, false belief, and all other passions and torments areassuaged, that is happiness. She has taught me a good lesson. Certainly,happiness (Nirvana) is what I am looking for. It behooves me this very day toquit the household life and to retire from the world in quest of happiness. Iwill send this lady a teacher's fee.\"2 In India it is customary to hang doors at the height of about two feet fromthe ground for the sake of coolnessand ventilation. The threshold is thus exposed even when the door is shut. 3 TheBuddhists recognize no real devil. Mara, the ruler of the sixth and highestheaven of sensual pleasure,approaches the nearest to our Satan. He stands for the pleasures of sense, andhence is The Buddha's naturalenemy.4 About the first of July. 5 I think the conception here is that a round portionof the earth, on which the Future Buddha stood, turnedaround like a modern railroad turn-table, thus detaching itself from the restand turning the Future Buddhawith it.6 An usabha is 140 cubits.Unit VIIFrom Id to the Ego in the Orient: Kundalini Yoga PartiThe Way and the ApparentEroticism of TantrismHERBERT V. GUENTHERHerbert V. Guenther is a well-known authority on Tibetan Buddhism and aspecialist in Buddhist Tantra. In this selection, he discusses a philosophy ofsexuality that he feels is different from that of the West. Tantric views ofsexuality are not bound by the reticence and disdain that characterizetraditional Western views of eroticism. Tantrism was able to affirm the value ofsexuality even in the framework of spiritual transcendence. Guenther offers auseful introduction to the refined erotic theory of Tantric Buddhism andperspective on the difference between Eastern and Western views of the subject.It is not uncommon in Indian discussions of eroticism to see the subject as an\"heroic encounter' between lovers. The pursuit of erotic goals is in theuniversal mythic category of the Indian quest for freedom, perfection, andultimate happiness.1 he attempt to resolve the tension that exists between the feeling offrustration and the sense of fulfilment, between the fictions about man's beingand the awareness of his Being, is termed \"the Way.\" It is not an inert rodlying between two points, nor is it the favouring of one side in the dilemmathat constitutes the human situation, but grounded in Being it is an exercise ofregaining and staying with Being. In other words, it is the actualization ofintrinsic awareness, Mind-as-such (semsnyid), together with or inseparable fromvalue-being (chos-kyi-sku). As this is not the same as the ideas we may haveabout it, the \"Way\" is summarized in the statement:Free from the concepts oimandala and (gana) cakra, Of Karmamudra andJrianamudra.Padma dkap-po explains mandala as the \"bearer\" (rten) of this or that psychicactivity, gana-cakra ibrten), manifesting itself as \"divine\" forces (lha);Karmamudra as a woman (mo) who yields pleasure containing the seed offrustration; and Jrianamudra as a woman who yields a purer, though unstable,pleasure. He goes on to say:By attending to these facets alone we may be able to reach the Akanistha realm,the ultimate in sensuousness, but not the absolute, because not free fromconcretizations, we convert (the real) into un-knowing.Obviously, our conceptualizations and concretizations of some pleasurableexperience may provide a temporary escape, but an escape into sentimentality isnot the solution of mans burning problem to find himself. In the same way, anintel-lectually induced suspension of all mental activity is no answer; nor is theproblem solved by an essentially intellectual negativism, as advocated by thePras-angikas. Sentimentality is compassion divorced from understanding, and theopen dimension of Being divorced from all feeling becomes negativism. ThereforeSaraha said:He who becomes involved with openness without compassion Will never set forth onthe most excellent path. So also by attending to compassion alone He will stayin Samsara, but not become free.Against such one-sided efforts the following statement is directed:Do not negate, do not suspend (the mental working), do not find fault, Do notfix (the mind on something), do not evaluate, but just let be.In other words, the way is not travelled by abrogating the ability to think, bydestroying the inner continuity of one's being and by introducing a divisionwhere there is none, but by preserving the unitary character of Being. Again wemay quote Saraha:He who can combine both (compassion and openness of Being), Stays neither inSamsara nor in Nirvana.Moreover, apart from Being there is no other being that can serve as a way:Friend, since words falsify, give up this infatuation, And to whatever youbecome attached, give that up, too. Once you understand (the real), all turnsout to be It; Nobody knows anything else but this.But it is the tendency of our un-knowing to look for our Being where it cannotbe. So Saraha declares:Where it is presentThere we do not see it.Still, the doctrinaires all explain the textsBut do not understand the Buddha to be in (their) body.Karma Phrin-las-pa explains this verse as referring to the\"togetherness-awareness\" that is present in and with every individual but is notrecognized as such by him who is involved with his propositions. Such anindividual, therefore, is unable to see Being as it is, but by looking outwardhe tries to understand what actually is within him. It is in his own body,speech, and mind, that the individual must understand Buddhahood to reside,though not in the manner of the body being a container, but as therepresentation, the embodiment of Buddhahood. Due to the fact that our concreteexistence is an intricate pattern of interacting forces, not only can it beviewed from different angles, but even moreso experienced on different levels, and since our individual life is our \"Way,\"at every step it partakes of ritual and imagery. This can be seen from thefollowing verse by Saraha and its explanation by Karma Phrin-las-pa:By eating and drinking and by enjoying copulationForever and everywhere one fills the rounds.Thereby the world beyond is reached,And one goes away having crushed the head of infatuation under one's feet.Karma Phrin-las-pa's interpretation is based on the importance which the tactilesense has for the relationship between man and his outer and inner environmentand their corresponding evaluation as well as on the significance of aestheticperception. We must never forget that man is in the world in the sense that itis through his body that there is for him the corporeality of things, and theinteraction between the environment and its impressions on the tactile organs orthe body-surface induces sensations of change and intensity in our physicalcondition. At the same time this experience of materiality and thereby of anobjective reality gives way to a visual world picture which is much wider thanthe limitations imposed by the purely tactile experience, and this is meant bythe use of the word \"beyond,\" which must never be understood as theimpossibility of there being a world other than the one we experience. However,there are wide-spread ramifications of the tactile sense, and the correspondingworld experiences interlace man with the world or nature on the one hand andwith the physiological side of his being on the other. It is this interlacingpattern with various focal points that is termed risa, which we can besttranslate by \"pattern,\" \"structure\" and, in specific localizations as \"focalpoints of experience.\" Because of the importance of the tactile sense whichgives us immediate contact with the world surrounding us, and because of thefact that we are embodied beings, the cognition that is most highly valued isthe aesthetic one, not the one that through its association with conceptsintroduces the painful separation of object and subject. Togetherness andseparateness can best be illustrated by a reference to the place a work of art,particularly sculpture, has in either framework. While the conceptual frameworkwas responsible, as far as our Western tradition is concerned, for removing thework of art from the space and time of our experience and locating it in anideal space, thereby enabling the spectator to look at it coldly from adistance, in aesthetic perception the work of art remains alive; it calls out tobe felt and touched, and each part of it is perceived as if it were for themoment all of the world, unique, desirable, perfect, not needing something otherthan itself in order to be itself. In this experience there is the warmth ofcloseness, not the coldness of distance. Instead of disrupting the unity ofBeing by separating and downgrading the instinctive side, as represented by thetactile experience, from the perceptual side which then becomes over T evaluatedconceptually, the Tantric 'Way' attempts to preserve this unity of sensuousnessand spirituality, the latter being essentially the former's value, by clarifyingthe various aspects. It is in this light that Karma Phrin-las-pa gives differentinterpretations of the above quoted verse by Saraha:Discussing the problem objectively: Having received the (necessary)empowerments, (the person) eats the meat (prepared for) the assemblage anddrinks the beer (or other alcoholic beverage). Then he unites with his partnerhaving the appropriate characteristics, by developing three ideas. In the act ofthe rubbing together of the two organs he concretely fixates and preserves theorigination of the four kinds of delight in an ascending or descending manner astaught by the Guru, and thus forever fills the four focal points in his(existential) pattern by making the (bodhicitta) move downward or by forcing itto move upward. By such an experience he reaches a world-transcending Buddhahoodexperience. Stepping en the head of the worldly people who, not having receivedthe empowerments, are deluded about the maturing effect and, not having receivedguidance, are deluded about the instruction, one crushes this delusion by (theabove) non-delusive method and reaches the level of Buddhahood.Discussing the problem in terms of a subjective experience: He who follows theMantrayoga, eats and drinks the five kinds of nectar in (what is a mixture of)the pure and impure; he unites the motility in (his existential) patterns withthe bodhicitta and he steadies in his being the awareness of the four kinds ofdelight due to attending to the process of unification. Continuously attendingto this experience he fills the focal points, that is, the pure in his body,with the awareness of absolute bliss. Thereby he attains a Nirvana beyond thisworld. Stepping on the head of those who are deluded about the Mantrayana methodand crushing this delusion, he goes to a place superior to their status.Discussing the problem in terms of a mystical experience: 'Eating' means to knowthe world of appearance to be mind, through instruction in the meaning of\"memory;'' \"drinking'' means to know mind to be open, through instruction in themeaning of \"non-memory;\" through instruction in the meaning of unorigination'appearance and mind meet in one flavour and become united; and throughinstruction in the meaning of \"transcendence,\" the self-validating intrinsicawareness rises as spontaneous joy; and by experiencing the ineffable, oneforever and everywhere fills one's noetic being with original awareness, throughan instruction which is like an uninterruptedly on-going effort; through thisexperience he goes to the world beyond.Discussing the problem from the viewpoint of ultimate Being: A follower of theMahamudra teaching takes as his food the world of appearance rising incessantlyin splendour, and has for his drink the open dimension (of Being) merging in theabsoluteness of Being. By experiencing the unity and inseparability ofappearance and openness of Being he is immediately aware with unsurpassable joy.Forever and everywhere making this experience in the above gradation he fillsthe rounds, i.e., the world of the knowable or the whole of appearance andpossibility, with a spontaneous original awareness, and by this (feeling of)unity he goes to the world beyond.This fourfold interpretation represents a growing awareness as a continuousprocess, in which ideas act as functions of unification rather than asseparating agents. This, of course, places a different connotation on ourconcept of ideaswhich is mainly an instrument for perpetuating the gulf between subject andobject and for preventing man from penetrating to his Being which is possibleonly through experience. According to the above fourfold interpretation, theexperience \"A\" is understood by the experience \"B,\" since \"B\" is of a higherorder than \"A.\" To speak, in the last analysis, of an identification of thecognizer with the cognized is another instance of \"misplaced concreteness.\" Whathappens is the emergence of the feeling of unity. The idea as a vehicle ofunification is indicated by gNyis-med Avadhutipa who, in commenting on the firstpart of Saraha's verse, explains Karma Phrin-las-pa's cryptic \"Three ideas.\"They are the idea that the body is a god, speech a mantra, and mind absoluteBeing. To see the body, by which the body as lived by me is meant, as a god isto appreciate it as a value in its own right; similarly speech as mantra is notempty talk, rather it is communication which does not depend on words with theirconventional meaning in usage. Lastly, mind as absolute Being is not theabsolutization of subjectivism, it is rather the cognitiveness of Being-as-suchwhich expresses itself in and through the activity of our Mind.Throughout Tantrism reference is made to the body as lived by me, perceiving,moving, acting, and so on. Taking this reference as our clue we can say thatsexuality is itself a mode of being of the person in question, and is concretelyinterpreted in the stream of lived experience. A human being, whether man orwoman, is in this world with his or her body and the body discloses itself asmeaningful in its attitudes, gestures, and actions. As an embodied being man isembodied with a certain sex, and the sexuality of the body manifests itself in avariety of manners so that it is justifiable to say that sexuality expresses ahuman being's existence in the same way as his existence expresses hissexuality. Thus, if the body expresses Existence, it does so because the bodyactualizes it, and at the same time is its actualization. In other words, thebody is not something external to my existence, but is its concrete realizationand hence both \"expression\" and \"the expressed.\" Another point to be noted isthat the body discloses itself to my experience as being mine and somehowbelonging to me who \"lives\" it. At the same time it is peculiarly ambiguous, andthis ambiguity may be stated as follows: That body over there is simultaneouslya woman herself and not herself; her sex presents me with her, and she asembodied presents me with her sex. In the same way, this body here issimultaneously a man himself and not himself; his sex presents her with himself,and he as embodied presents her with his sex. In terms of subject and object,each individual is both subject and object, but the individual is object in aspecial way, both for himself, as when I speak of my body, and for others as amere body (to be manipulated and controlled). Although human beings are male andfemale and although sexuality is coextensive with life, sexuality cannot bereduced to Being-as-such, nor can the latter be reduced to sexuality. Hencesexuality is the dialectic of lived experience, in which I apprehend the otheras subject or, to put it more cautiously, in which I should apprehend the otheras a subject, which means to recognize the intrinsic value of the other, asindicated by the statement that in the realm of lived experience men and womenare gods and goddesses. The failure to grasp the meaning of'Being,' of'body' and'sexuality' has resulted in a thorough misunderstandingof Buddhist Tantrism. This is mainly due to the difference of'climate'contributing to the development of ideas. Western civilization derives from theearly Mediterranean slave societies with their attendant postulate of acelestial lawgiver who \"legislates\" for both human beings and non-human naturalphenomena, and who \"owns\" the human beings as his chattels, just as a shepherdowns his flock and takes up an active attitude of command. Pastoral dominance,on the one hand, and among seafaring people, the unquestioning obedience to theone in command of a ship, on the other, greatly assisted the development of a\"dominance\" psychology which attempts to rationalize the crave for power,domination, and control. It aims not only at turning the other into an object tobe used or misused at will, but also at making the other feel as an object inthe eyes of the master or postulated super-power. This is, of course, impossiblebecause an object, a slave, cannot give the recognition sought for by the masteras only a subject can do so, and it is precisely the individual's subjectcharacter that the master cannot tolerate and that he attempts to deny. Inasmuchas Hindu Tantrism has been deeply influenced by the dominance psychology of theSamkhya system, professing a dualism ofpurusa who is male, and of prakrti who isfemale and who dances or stops dancing at the bidding of the Lord or purusa,this purely Hinduistic power mentality, so similar to the Western dominancepsychology, was generalized and applied to all forms of Tantrism by writers whodid not see or, due to their being steeped so much in dominance psychology,could not understand that the desire to realize Being is not the same as thecraving for power. Hence Tantrism was equated with 'power.' And since purusa andprakrti involved a sexual symbolism, which was concretized in the sense that thesexual act was the proof of one's masculinity, the paranoid Western conceptionabout Tantrism resulted: it is the paranoid who is obsessed with his sexualpotency and attempts to compel the object to come towards him (the prakrtidances at the bidding of the purusa). He tries to make the other (the woman)responsible for the action of satisfying his needs. At the same time heidentifies himself with his sexuality, and this identification becomes the basisfor his idea of power, preferably of \"omnipotence.\"It is a fact that any dominance psychology inevitably destroys the individual assubject. Its dehumanizing force was keenly felt by those brought up in theWestern world and so they turned to the \"mysterious\" East which was supposed tohold the key to their acquiring the powers that the Western institutions deniedthem. But exchange of one kind of dominance for another does not lead to therealization of Being; it remains a slave's dream of becoming a master.There is another area in which the destruction of the individual as a livingbeing is deeply felt, and where traditional Western religion fails and hasalways failed us. This is the feeling of sex, rigorously excluded from the realmof speech and thought and frowned upon in deeds. This exclusion, too, has a longhistory and is inextricably tied up with the contempt for and fear of the body.The official attitude has been and is in favour of continence, abstinence andasceticism having their root in fear, and while contempt might assist theofficial attitude, it more often has been in opposition to it, particularly inits aspect of defiance. Libertinism did not appear under the auspices ofcommunion and joy, but underthose of arrogance and contempt. To suffer from an obsessive fear of the body isperhaps not so different from a compulsive addiction to sex, be these addictsvirility-provers or seductiveness-provers. The important point to note is thatin all these cases sex is confined to only one dimension, sensual pleasure andexploitation, but the aesthetic experience of joy and through it the enrichmentof ones Being is missed. The use of sex as an instrument of power distorts itsfunction. Instead of being an experience of feeling for the partner, it becomesa manoeuvre to establish one's imaginary superiority. A man who sees himself asa sexual object will imagine himself as \"the great lover,\" and a woman who seesherself as a sexual object believes in the irresistibility of her sex appeal.Both may feel repelled by their body, but they are convinced of its power.Tantrism certainly is not on the side of asceticism, but it would be wrong toconclude that therefore it must of necessity advocate libertinism and that itsappeal to Western man, reared in an atmosphere hostile to women, pleasure, andlife, is due to the fact that Tantrism approves of women and of sex and, byimplication, can serve as the moral justification for the sex addict'scompulsion. It is true, Tantrism recognizes pleasure as valuable and positive,but much more than mere pleasure-seeking is involved. It is equally true that inits Hinduistic form it combines power with pleasure which essentially isappreciation and is meant to lead to aesthetic enjoyment, and so has a positivecontent, unlike Christianity which advocates the impotence of man, denouncespleasure and condemns its source, woman. Buddhist Tantrism dispenses with theidea of power, in which it sees a remnant of subjectivistic philosophy, and evengoes beyond mere pleasure to the enjoyment of being and of enlightenmentunattainable without woman.How can enlightenment be attained in this bodily existence Without thineincessant love, o lovely young girl?Enlightenment is the name for a change in perspective, and Tantrism is thepractical way of bringing about this change. It does not mean that in thischange of perspective something is seen that others cannot see, but that thingsand, above all, persons are seen differently. This is clearly stated by Padmadkar-po:In attending to the vision of (seeing himself as) a god (lha) the yogiapprehends, not incorrectly, what ordinarily appears before his eyes; however,mentally he takes a firm pride in his being a god (lhai sku). This is termedadhisthdnaioga. In this term, adhi means \"superior,\" and sthdna means\"arrangement,\" \"accomplishment,\" \"adornment,\" hence \"to be graced.\" A \"superioraccomplishment\" is termed \"superior feeling of reverence\" from the rootadhimunc.To see oneself as a god is to be aware of one's existence as valuable and asgood; it is not deifying one's shortcomings which are the products of a limitedand selfish vision and hence negative and evil. The emotional quality of thisvalue-perception is the \"feeling of reverence'' which is not contradictory toexaltation or pride; the negative counterpart to pride is arrogance and toreverence, con-tempt and self-debasement. The attempt to see oneself as a god is not yet to beenlightened, but it enfeebles the negative view one takes of oneself. Only bytaking a positive view of oneself can one truly be. The experience of reallybeing is not only felt as blissful but is also an identity-experience. Here manhas found himself and is no longer a \"thing-of-and-in-the-world.\" In order tofind himself man needs the \"other\" who is no intellectual abstraction, but partof himself, needed in order to be himself. Sahajayogini Cinta, speaking of thestate when one spontaneously is oneself, says:Here, in spontaneity which is non-dual and naturally pure, one's Being(bdag-nyid), in order that one may understand one's Being, manifests itself inthe shape of man and woman.The concrete \"other\" person, for me, is whoever enters my life-world and whom Iaccept as one accepting me in order to accept me or her as one who is willing toaccept me as one accepting myself. This complex situation of the interaction ofman and woman is termed Karmamudra and Jnanamudra, the one referring to the\"without,\" the other to the \"within,\" each of them representing an \"encounter\"that changes both partners.Swami Muktananda and theEnlightenment Through Sakti-PatCHARLES S. J. WHITECharles S. J. White is a specialist in Hinduism and professor of religion at theAmerican University. This selection illustrates the way that Tantric ideas andpractices have been brought to bear on an interesting Hindu revitalizationmovement, created by a contemporary \"saint\" of Hinduism named Swami Muktananda.The version of Hinduism taught by Muktananda is called \"Shakti-Pat\" or the WayofShakti. The methods employed by Muktananda in \"awakening the Kundalini\" of hisdisciples are supposed to be typical of Tantric masters' use ofSiddhis oracquired paranormal powers. The appeal of Muktananda's \"Way\" especially duringhis lifetime, extended to Westerners as well as Indians.1 he main burden of proof lying upon the cult of the Indian saint is in the areaof psychic claims, as representing the unusual state in which the saint findshimself when he becomes \"divine.\" The following passage from a biography ofSathya Sai Baba illustrates what we mean: \"His [Sathya Sai Baba's] Omniscienceand Omnipresence are revealed to everyone who meets Him in the Interview Room.He tells the visiting devotee what he has said, has done or has felt; to whom hehas spoken, and on what; what he has feared and plotted, suffered and lost. Ifyou want to consult Him on ten points, He will have answered them and more evenbefore you ask! He might reveal what you actually experienced in your dreams,repeating the very words which in the dream you had heard Him say. He may evenlay bare your history down to the minutest detail, and where there was sorrowand weakness, He will replace it with joy and strength.\"Obviously, it is this kind of \"proof that draws to the feet of the saints themasses of Indians and, with the convenience of fast aerial transportation,increasing numbers of foreigners as well. In what follows I shall be discussinga relatively new cult in Maharashtra: that of the saint, Swami Muktananda ofGaneshpuri—a small viUage about two or three hours distant from Bombay by car.As will be perceived, the saint who resides there is held to have achievedremarkable development, but his cult is different in most particulars from whatI had earlier grasped about the saints stemming from Sai Baba of Shirdi. Mystudy of Muktananda had been inspired originally by the hope of enlarging thescope of analysis of detailed interconnections in the Sai Baba Movement; but Ilearned that there are a number of Maharashtrian saints, similar in some ways toSai Baba of Shirdi (Muktananda among them), whose practices derive from tantricsources. This could not be said, so specifically I believe, of the Sai Babagroup.It was interesting to discover, nevertheless, that the famous Sai Baba hadinspired a number of his own disciples after his own death, through dreams, togo for help to a saint called Swami Nityananda, the preceptor of Muktananda. Forexample, I was told about a neighbor of Amma (the principal devotee ofMuktananda) who some years ago had developed gangrene in his leg from diabetes.In a dream, his wife saw Sai Baba of Shirdi, who told her to go to Gan-eshpurito a temple where Swami Nityananda was accustomed to bathe in the naturally hotspring water of the tank and to follow his example. The man went with his wife,bathed as ordered, and, although the doctors had been preparing to amputate theleg, was healed. Such instances help establish a tie, however tenuous, betweenthe two saintly gaddis of Sai Baba and Nityananda.DEFINITIONThe Saint —The English word \"saint\" comes from the Latin sanctus, which in turnderives from a verb meaning \"to make sacred, ordain, or establish.\" A saint,thus by definition, is related to the sacred or holy and exhibits to the worldthe same qualities associated with terms often used to epitomize the religiousdimension of life in events and places. The saint is a focus of the sacred. Tocombine some of the terminologies accredited to the sacred or holy, we mightexpect that the saint would have unusual power and compelling attributes of themysterium tremendum et fascinans in addition to permeating an environment withnuminous qualities. The question remains, however, whether the term \"saint\"itself is sufficiently precise to exclude other possibilities. It seems likelythat many religious figures—the priest, the prophet, the seer, the healer, notto mention the sorcerer, the medium or the magician, and the shaman and medicineman—have some characteristics in common with \"saint\" so defined. Moreover, weare dealing with a term that has traditional meanings in the Christian West.The care which the Roman Catholic church has taken to safeguard the officialprocesses leading to the recognition of sainthood among its members is wellknown. Yet the bases for final judgment are remarkably similar to those whichact, it would appear, \"automatically\" in the appointment of Hindu saints. Take,for example, the question of miracles. The following incident is recorded inconnection with Saint Therese of Lisieux shortly after her death:Amongst the youthful and critical seminarists of Bayeux . . . was a certain illyoung abbe Anne, whose doctors diagnosed galloping consumption and gave him atmost a few more days to live. A neuvaine to Therese was instantly begun (andthis alone shows how high her reputation already stood), but apparently to noavail: after some days of intercession it was thought that the end would comeduring the night. Forewarned of the probability, the young man, who, for all hispiety, had no wish to die, pressed a relic of the nun to his heart andpassionately invoked her in silent prayer, saying that although he felt sure shewas in Heaven, he was on earth where much work remainedto be done, and that, in a word, she must cure him. An extraordinary changevisibly taking place without delay in the patient, the doctors were summoned inhaste and to their astonishment were obliged to declare that they found himcompletely restored to health. Lest any exaggeration should be suspected, it isas well to give the statement in the words of Lisieux' official chronicler in awork crowned by the French Academy, \"The destroyed and ravaged lungs had beenreplaced by new lungs, carrying out their normal functions and about to revivethe entire organism. A slight emaciation persists, which will disappear within afew days under a regularly assimilated diet.\" The miracle was so wellauthenticated, owing to the attendance and the testimony of the doctors, that itwas later taken as one of the two test cases demanded.For the cult of Therese, miracles substantiate the efficacy of her sainthood;the religiously interested investigator is drawn to considerations of the deepermeaning of the milieu in which such events are recorded as well as to reflectupon the development of religious practices or theology on the basis of suchhappenings.In thinking about the situation in Hinduism, one observes that there the linegrows indistinct at times between the gods and the saints. In the measure thatthe cult theory allows, most saints are considered to be divine and oftenreceive public worship in the manner of divinities. Indeed, it is not beyondpossibility that such great gods of Hinduism as Krsna and Rama in part arosefrom historical figures. The virtual deification of Gautama Sakyamuni is anotherstriking example from India, and we notice parallels in the cases of the populardivinities of the Chinese.No doubt the Christian church, at times the fierce guardian of the uniquedivinity of Jesus Christ, would have to provide both for the extraordinaryphenomena that were identified with canonized persons and at the same timemaintain the theological distinctions among saints in general, the BlessedVirgin Mary, and the Second Person of the Trinity. In Hinduism there is a gooddeal of theological justification for the divinization of historical persons.From Vedic statements onward, the theological expressions of Hinduism reinforcethe concept that God or some profound ontological principle very deeplypenetrates the manifested world. Popular stories repeat the theme thateverything is God, as is everyone—although in the latter case, it is only withconsiderable effort that one becomes a realized person, that is,self-consciously divine.It seems clear that a wide-ranging structure must encompass the concept of sainteven when necessary distinctions are made. The saint is always an exemplaryfigure, and his status is never merely given in the normal course of religiouslife. The appearing of a saint is an unusual event, and the establishment of theclaim of being one, however much longed for in the religious society, is subjectto controls. These controls are such that full acceptance is delayed until thephenomenon can be completely grasped after the saint's death, even thoughpreliminary acknowledgment is often given. The latter is due to the fact thatthe demands of the religious society upon these individuals are so pressing thattheycannot be postponed once some evidence is available. Moreover, the term \"saint,\"as contrasted with any other designations of religious proficiency, must referto the most exalted capacity of all, recognizable in human, historical terms andin the religious cultures where human sensibility can express itself with thegreatest degree of clarity and to a universal constituency. However, the term\"saint\" may not always be the most acceptable one to that constituency if itshould prefer a definition indicating the presence of a divine being. It wouldappear to be difficult to maintain a functional difference between two suchcategories (as saint and god) if other criteria are more or less harmonious.Even though some religions must attempt to maintain such a distinction, we havenoted, this need not cause theological problems for Hinduism and some otherEastern religions.PHENOMENAL ASPECTSAs we have previously discussed, the saints of the Sai Baba Movement were ahomogeneous group to the extent that they appeared to share certain elements incommon in their cult theory or activity. For example, the god Dattatreya,familiar in the cult of saints in Maharashtra, figured in some aspects of thecult of Shirdi Sai Baba, Upasani Baba, and Mata Godavari (the first three inthis series), but not in that of the fourth saint, Sathya Sai Baba. On the otherhand Shirdi Sai Baba and Sathya Sai Baba made use of sacred ash, vibhuti, in theperformance of miracles although the other two saints did not; and this practicelinked them to the Kanphata yogis who have as their patron Dattatreya—andthrough them, at least in the case of Sai Baba of Shirdi, to the Muslim sainttradition. Thus we thought that a set of tautologous relations binds the membersof this group into a kind of system, all of whose elements we cannot reviewhere.It is true that the saints of a given region are united by the many accidentalcircumstances of cultural life such as a common language, a lineage going backthrough hierarchies of preceptors (sometimes to medieval or ancient times), anda sectarian milieu. The homogeneity of Indian cultural life is another factorthat must be taken into account in spite of regional differences, so that thescope of possible forces at work on any particular example of sainthood mustinclude regional as well as national elements. This panoply of influences andconnections becomes staggering to contemplate but no more so than that in otherreligious expressions whose structures we only glimpse with present techniques.I first learned about Swami Muktananda through a letter received from a friend(a New Zealander, a Cambridge graduate, and a candidate for the Ph.D. degree inan Indian university) who had received Sakti Pat initiation:One becomes aware that one has received the dlksha in several ways, according toone's prarabdha. The KundalinI shakti is awakened and immediately starts towork: one's body may shake violently, one may laugh or cry, get overjoyed orvery depressed, develop a temporary illness, start performing yoga asanasautomatically, chant mantras (even without everhaving known a word of Sanskrit—in one case I heard of, the man, an Englishman,actually wrote down Sanskrit shlokas tho he knew no Sanskrit, not evenDevanagari), goes into trances, dances, sees visions, hears locutions, etc. Itvajries with everyone. In my case my body started to shake uncontrollably; Ifelt great upsurges of bhakti so that I felt as tho I had fallen in love, then Ifelt like a woman who had just realised she was pregnant with a new and divinelife, but above all I felt a happiness I had not known in my whole life. Sincethat day I have never been depressed as I used to be. I have full confidence andhope for the future. After a few weeks I started to do a lot of very intensepranayama which gradually subsided into long kumbhakas. I found myself adoptingsome yogic mudras. One day I stood up and danced slowly and gracefully. Allthese things are called Kriyas and their onset and process is callednadl-shuddhi. Everything that happens, no matter how difficult it may seem (likebreath retention) is to be allowed to run its course for they are directed bythe shakti, the cit-shakti, who is supremely intelligent and forces one's bodyto do just those yogic and other exercises which are necessary for thepurification of the sthula sharira. Purified, the cit-shakti moves inward andstarts to operate on the level of the sukshma-sharira, according to one'sprarabdha—the will of God—giving rise to visions, the hearing of the divya nadadhvani, and other psychic phenomena and powers.I subsequently returned to India and was able to gather materials for apreliminary description of Muktananda's history and present activities. I havealso taken this occasion to speculate on the noumenal area of his experience andinfluence. What follows is presented somewhat schematically to give a sense ofthe structure that one might expect to be able to extrapolate, for example, in acomparative study together with other similar data.1. Muktananda was born into a wealthy family in the vicinity of Man galore inMysore State. His mother was a pious woman who had made a pilgrimage toDharmasthala to invoke the aid of a form of Siva, known as Manjunath Ma-hadev,to have a son. She was told afterward by a Sadhu to repeat the mantra, Om NamahSivaya, and her prayer would be granted. (The same mantra is used by thedevotees of Muktananda in the ashram at Ganespuri today to assist in the work ofarousing the Kundalinl.)2. The mother was taken in labor while she was at the washbasin under a tree inthe compound of her house. The baby emerged so swiftly that she did not havetime to catch i* before it fell into the washbasin. The time was dawn on May 16,1908, the full moon day of the month of Vaisakh: very auspicious. They named himKrsna.3. The story goes that as a boy and youth he was stronger, more handsome, andmore aggressive than his peers and bored with formal education but highlyintelligent. \"Nor did any theories or dogmas interest him; for he was one whocould be convinced only by actual observation and direct experience.\" Atfifteen, by chance at a festival, he met Swami Nityananda who was afterward todirect the final stages of his spiritual development. Nityananda embraced Krsnaand gently stroked his cheeks. He then strode away and they did notmeet again for many years. A pious home life had already aroused interest in areligious vocation, so six months after the encounter with Nityananda Krsna leftto become a sadhu.Unlike certain other saints in India his full realization did not occur untilmiddle age, while the process leading up to it included instruction underseveral different gurus.a) Among the saints, siddhas, and sadhus with whom he took training of some sortas a young man—including Sanskrit language, study of the scriptures, yogapractice, and other subjects—his first teacher was Siddharuddha Swami, from whomhe received initiation as sannyasT and his religious name, Muktananda. Thus hisformal entrance into the ascetic life was under the direction of a monk trainedin the disciplines of sakti. In 1929 he began to wander through India, stayinghere and there with various teachers. In all, during this period he mentionshaving met sixty great saints. Besides his first guru, among others there were\"Popat Maharaj at Satana, Upasani Baba at Sakori, Swami Prakashananda at Gondal,Sitaram Bairagi at Dwarkabet, Bhagari Baba at Lasalgaon, Narayan Maharaj atKedgaon, Mauni Baba at Chikhali, Chaitanya Swami at Paithan, Munsoji Baba atVarad, Prembhikshu at Jamnagar, Ramana Maharshi at Tiruvannamalai, JagannathBaba at Ahmedabad and a saint at Howrah (Calcutta) who was known to subsist onstones.\" In the reports about his experiences, in the latter part of his firstphase he received special attention from two saints who noted his impendingrealization. The one, Zipruanna, a naked ascetic who passed his days seated on arefuse heap, healed Muktananda's incessant headaches by licking the latter'shead and, through water that had been poured on Zipruanna's foot, helpedMuktananda to cure a woman in an advanced stage of tuberculosis. Of Muktananda,Zipruanna said, \"Your fame will touch the highest heaven.\" Another saint,Harigiri Baba, said of Muktananda shortly before the last and crucial stage ofthe sadhana began, \"You have now to live in a palatial building. Cast away yourochre clothes and wear silken garments instead. You are no longer a sannyasin,but a maharaja. You shall not ask but only give.\"b) Muktananda has discussed in detail the special relationship that developedbetween himself and the saint known as Bhagavan Nityananda. Nityananda becamefor Muktananda his guru, both in the sense that he received final initiationfrom him and in a very special manner when it became clear that Muktananda wasthe \"chosen disciple.\" The date of his initiation was August 14, 1957. On thatoccasion Nityananda gave his own sandals to him— the closest physical objects tothe lotus feet of the guru. The presentation of the initiatory symbol marked aturning point in the quality of Muktananda's noumenal experience which now beganto conform with that of the Siddha Parampara, the adepts in Kundalinl. He writesof what happened: \"[Nityananda] looked into mv eyes. Watching carefully, I saw aray of light entering me from his pupils. It felt hot, like burning fever. Itslight was dazzling, like that of a high-powered bulb. As that ray emanating fromLord Nityananda's pupils penetrated mine, I was thrilled with amazement, joy andfear. I was beholding its color, and also chanting 'Guru Om.' It was a fullunbroken beamof divine radiance. Its color kept changing from molten gold to saffron, to ashade deeper than the blue of a shining star. I stood utterly transfixed.\"From shortly after the time that this experience occurred, Muktananda lived awayfrom Ganeshpuri in very intense sddhana until his realization was complete.After he returned to Ganeshpuri, when the devotees of Nitya-nanda were preparinga small temple to enshrine an image of their guru to worship after his passing,which they expected would be soon, on November 16, 1956 they were directedinstead to install Muktananda in the temple with ceremonies appropriate to adivinity. Thereafter, the two saints lived side by side in the ashram untilNityananda's death on August 8, 1961. Since then Muktananda has directed theashram and greatly expanded both its size in respect to property holdings andits activities with increasing numbers of devotees.5. In regard to the organization of the ashram and related subjects I havefirsthand kowledge—having visited Ganeshpuri and Shri Gurudev Ashram in July of1971 and having met Swami Muktananda. Moreover, it was possible to engage inextended discussions with several of the devotees who had been initiated. Theashram has attracted people from all over India and among them large numbers ofthe elite of Bombay who come, particularly on weekends, to have darsan ofMuktananda and to join temporarily in the ashram's religious life. There is alsoa considerable group of Western devotees, including several who have been livingin the ashram for a year or more since it was established. The emotionalatmosphere if this sanctuary for those who are experiencing Kundalini awakeningis no doubt very exalted. At the edge of the road with rice fields making ahalf-moon around it and everything, including the little jungle at a distancebehind, washed and hearteningly green in the monsoon rain, to the observer theashram gave a sense of cleanliness, order, and peace. Muktananda rules as GuruMaharaj and demands conformity to the horarium, which is somewhat similar tothat of a monastic house in the West. Seeing him, listening to his remarks,hoping for some favorable sign bestowed on oneself constitute the framework ofthe relationship that the individual devotee develops with the guru.6. We have already mentioned the \"royal\" style of Muktananda. He has beendescribed by some as \"virile,\" and by that is meant that he has a commanding,masculine personality. He speaks directly and even coarselv at times to expresshis ideas, but on the other hand his erudition and skill in expression inwritten form are oft pn commented on as well. In this he contrasts withNitya-nanda who was illiterate; likewise, in his personal habits, Muktanandafavors silken lungis and has taken pains to make the ashram attractive withplants, an enclosed garden, a spacious meditation hall and dining room, and soon. In personal manner Muktananda is often said to be \"restless,\" and oneobserves this in his sudden appearances and disappearances around the grounds,his quick walk, the changing expressions on his face, and his penchant forunexpected excursions to holy places in the region or for calling the people tovary the routine of services during the day with some novel celebration. Heusually wears dark glasses, and it is reported that he does so because heperceivesthe spiritual quality of the world and of the persons who come to see him invarying degrees of a kind of light which hurts the physical eyes. He does nothave the reputation of being able to produce phenomena, or at least he does notparticularly cater to demands that he do such, although the psychic experienceswhich his followers say stem from his powers are remarkable enough.7. There are several persons at the ashram who undoubtedly have a much closerbond with the guru than do others. Chief among these is a very bright woman, aformer professor of Sanskrit, who serves as the leader of the woman devotees andis in charge of some of the other internal operations of the ashram. She iscalled Amma, or Mother, and has written about the tantric sddhana taught byMuktananda. She has been at Ganeshpuri since before the time that the two saintslived together there in the fifties. Since she is a person of great personalrefinement and charm, her allegiance to this saint is an instance of thetestimony of the distinguished disciple to the worthiness of the master. Ayoung, former English professor, Mr. Jain, who serves as Muk-tananda'sinterpreter and has been in the ashram for several years, is also high in theranking of the disciples. Among others of them one might mention an Americangirl, now called Uma, who met Muktananda in New York City during his Americantour and was able, through a combination of seemingly miraculous circumstances,to come to Ganeshpuri to live permanently. Indeed, I was able to talk withseveral young Western men and women, including married couples who felt calledto be followers of Muktananda and reside with him. Reports of the experiences ofsome of the disciples appear in Shree Gurudev-Vani.8. As Muktananda's reputation grows and he becomes known in wider and widercircles, no doubt he will be increasingly called upon to serve in the role ofguru to society. If one might compare him with the somewhat more famous SathyaSai Baba, one would say that his social role is likewise less well developed. Itis difficult to completely clarify these aspects of the demands upon the Hindusaint, but they may be compared with the tasks that some of the clergy inWestern countries, particularly famous prelates or evangelists, are called uponto perform.Beyond such activities, Muktananda is a man who can capture the attention of thereading public. In his own right he has published in Hindi a spiritual memoir,entitled Citsaki Vilas, which was translated and abridged in the Americanversion, Guru. Members of the ashram, but particularly Amma and Mr. Jain, arelikewise skilled writers. In this regard, as compared with the majority of thesaints one would find in India, Muktananda may be thought of as more clearlyemploying his intellectual gifts to reach a literate public. This is true alsoin the question-and-answer series, published from transcriptions ofconversations with the disciples.9. As far as the further development of the cult is concerned, it is clearalready that Muktananda has been adopted as guru and avatar by a proliferatingbody of followers and that he will experience the fame of a national celebrity.Besides the testimonials of both Eastern and Western disciples appearing inashram publications, independent writings of disciples attest to the master'sinfluence. There is a temple, Shree Gurudev Dhyan Mandir, in Johannesburg, SouthAfrica, where devotions are held regularly in honor of Mukta-nanda; and his cultis observed in various places in India and the United States at the presenttime. It should be emphasized that this is happening while the saint is stillalive.NOUMENAL ASPECTSMuktananda in a unique manner has described his inner states both in his Hindiand English writings on the subject. As the devotees point out, what is unusualabout Muktananda's \"way\" is that, for the first time, the secret initiations andexperiences of the Sakti Pat, the yoga of the goddess, of the primordial energyof Siva, is presented openly in a manner suitable to universal acceptance. Weoften speak of this kind of yoga as KundalinI Yoga.When we look through the reports of Muktananda's and his disciples' experiences,we find that there is conformity to the technical theory. For instance, onemight recall the passage quoted previously from the letter of my friend whoexperienced the initiation very emotionally. As regards its further physicaleffects, he goes on in the same letter to say the following:Now when I visit a temple, a samadhi or dargah [Hindu or Muslim saint's tomb,respectively], I become acutely aware of the shakti present there, to the extentthat my body shakes very violently. Near Ganeshpuri is a very old Devitemple—Vajreshvari—and when I visited it, I found myself doing the mula-bandha.Since then I have been doing theuddi-yaha-bandha and the jalandhara-bandha atvarious times. I have found that the samadhi of Dyaneshvar at Aland! isparticularly powerful in this respect. As I approach the temple my body startsto shake and by the time I reach the sanctum sanctorum it is uncontrollable.Dyaneshvar is there for me. The pujarl throws some water on me and my bodytwists and writhes even more— such is the power of the shakti.A devotee writing about his and a friend's experiences after being initiated atthe ashram mentions equally striking results.We sat for meditation after the recitation of the Vishnu Sahasra Nama. Withinhalf an hour I could notice some movements in my body: I was swinging from leftt~> right, and back and forth. My entire body was trembling as if I had receivedan electric shock or there was an earthquake. I felt a heaviness in my head andit touched the ground. I was in that condition for about an hour. I felt a kindof wheel moving or whirling in the stomach at high speed. I had some visions ofLord Ganapati and Lord Dattatreya. My eyes had become red and tears rolled downthe cheeks. Even when I got up my body was trembling and I could not keep 1 mybalance. Shri Zarapakar could sit for about half an hour only and in that periodhe said he saw some colours, a flame, and visions of Lord Dattatreya, SwamiVivekananda and others. He also felt heaviness in his head especially betweenthe two eye-brows. His eyeballs were sometimes rotating and then fixed betweenthe two eyebrows.One soon becomes aware that the underlying current of excitement at Gan-shpuriis directly related to the hope of some who go there to be graced withinitiation, to have these kinds of experiences, and perhaps to aspire after the\"realization\" which is at the basis of Muktananda's claim to be a saint. Duringthe course of the devotions, chanting, and meditations in the prayer hall infront of the shrine of Nityananda, it was not unusual for an observer to witnessthe physical phenomena described above. Among both Eastern and Western devoteesI saw some moving their arms, prostrating, revolving the head, even shriekingand falling to the ground in tears. I traveled and visited for a fortnight withan Indian friend who had received this initiation. As a consequence of it, hedid automatic breath arrest in the manner of the Pranayama of Raja Yoga. He hadsome control over it, but he asserted to me that it was nearly irresistible; hehad become so blissful that he could hardly remain in normal consciousness.Indeed, he appeared to go into trance even in the middle of a conversation,while involuntarily holding his breath for an inordinately long time.Of course it will occur to the reader to ask to what extent these expressionsattest to any particularly real or new thing, or whether they are not hystericalor other types of psychologically abnormal states. The answer, naturally, cannotbe given because we do not have a technique for analyzing psychologicalconditions in respect to spiritual realization. The whole recent trend inscience would be to eliminate anything but \"normal\" states of mind—that is, tobend every effort to retain or return to a \"normal\" state; but apparently thiswould provide a hindrance to the physical and psychic transformations that areheld to appear along the way to Sakti Pat realization.On the other hand, I had, as it were, anticipated the discovery of evidence infavor of the possible widespread character of these experiences when, on anearlier visit to India, I met Mr. Mark Sunder Rao at the Christian Institute forthe Study of Religion and Society in Bangalore. Mr. Rao had converted toChristianity from Hinduism, but his most striking \"Christian\" experienceoccurred in a manner very reminiscent of what we have just been discussing. Hepresented me with a copy of the printed document from which I quote thispassage:In 1951, after attending the episcopal consecration of Bishop Appasamy at ErodeI spent a month at my sisters (a Brahmin) home. There I had the privilege ofmeeting an old friend of the family, a yogin. From 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. withintervals for refreshment and rest, we held conversations on spiritual life andstudied together the Maharashtra saint Jnandev's work Amritanubhava. When it wastime for me to return home, this friend expressed the wish that I should havethe mystic vision and experience. Indeed he said that he coveted it for mebecause of my steadfast studentship and adhikara. Within a few moments of hissaying so I became aware of a strangely attractive mass of brilliant but coollight approaching me from an immense distance. Coming nearer it appeared to be acircle of radiant gold, blue and white, with the head of Jesus Christ at itscentre. Approaching me at great speed this mass seemed to hit me between theeyebrows, penetrate through the skull to the rear brain, when I heard a soundlike that of a camera click, and I lost consciousness of my surroundings whileinternally alert and aware of unutterable oneness with All and inexpressible joy. . .When I came to, there was the senior friend beaming with a smile and tearfuleyes. He told me that his wish had been fulfilled and that we could part withjoy.After the initiatory experience described earlier, Muktananda retired to alonely place in central Maharashtra and underwent the final stages of the SaktiPat sddhana. It is true, he frequently found himself in a condition borderingmadness or complete physical breakdown as a result of the psychic \"tension\" thatbrought him from level to level. He experienced the operation of the sakti uponhim in a primarily visual way. His progress was measured by an evolution throughvisions of unearthly red, white, and even \"black\" light which bore with themecstatic epiphanies of the Hindu deities as well as paranormal \"pre-cognitive\"knowledge. He developed such classical yogic powers as the \"Bindu-Bhed . . . inplace of normal binary vision, the eyes attain a uniform field of perception . .. can see or visualize on all sides.\" The climax of all was the sight of theblue pearl, or nlla hindu, that Muktananda's devotees hope to perceive throughhis help and that he asserts is the symbol or even the vehicle of the highestrealization:while I was gazing at the tiny Blue Pearl, it began to expand in all directions,spreading its blue radiance. The entire region from the earth to the sky becameirradiated. It was a Pearl no longer, having enlarged into the shining,sparkling infinite Light. This has been designated by the scriptural authors orthe seers of the highest Truth as the conscious Light of Chiti. I actually sawthe universe arise from this expanding Light like clouds of smoke from a fire.... I meditate these days also. But I feel certain that there is nothing morefor me to see. The certitude that I have attained the highest arisesspontaneously in meditation. For the extremely subtle, tranquil, all-pervasive,Conscious Blue Light that followed the three visions with the Blue Pearl has notaltered or vanished and still bathes the external universe. Even with closedeyes I perceive it glowing and shimmering, softer than the soft, tenderer thanthe tender, subtler than the subtle. When, I open my eyes, I see the blue raysall around. Whenever I look at anyone, I first see the blue Light and then him.When I look at an object, I first see the honeyed subtle Conscious rays and thenthe object. Regardless of what occupies my mind, I perceive the universe withinthe lustrous mass of Light.TantrismAGEHANANDA BHARATIAgehananda Bharati, a professor of anthropology at Syracuse University, is aWestern convert to Hinduism. In addition to the following selection, he haswritten a full-length hook on Tantra. This selection is a historical survey ofTantra from its origins to the present with special discussions of such featuresas Tantric practices, differences between Hindu and Buddhist Tantrism, andTantric art. Note that this selection is reprinted from the Abingdon Dictionaryof Living Religions— cross-references are to articles within that dictionary.TANTRISM tan' trism (H, B & Ja—Skt.; lit. \"that which extends, spreads\"). 1. Ina general sense, a non-Vedic practice (see Vedas), including rites open to womenand persons not of the Brahmin caste. It also includes the worship of deitiesfor the purpose of specific religious merit or wordly gain. 2. In a narrower butmore popular sense, an esoteric, radical way to achieve Moksa (emancipation fromrebirth and suffering). It includes a large body of scriptural and oral lore,parallel, and in Hinduism and Jainism, marginal to official scriptures. Whileorthodox Hindus view occult powers (see Siddhi) as impediments to the quest formoksa, tantrics court them as proofs of progress. The orthodox view a temperatelife-style as essential to the pursuit of Yoga, but tantrics cultivate thesensuous elements in their psychic makeup.1. Types of tantrism. First is the clandestine, often eroticized version ofyoga. In Tibetan Buddhism it is synonymous with the \"diamond vehicle\" (seeVaj-rayana) and is part of mainstream doctrine and practice. In Hinduism,however, it is peripheral and antagonistic to orthodoxy and orthopraxis. Second,tantrism on the Indian subcontinent is largely identified with shamanisticbehavior, with sorcery and witchcraft. A tantric is a person who commandsextrahuman forces for his own benefit or that of his clients. Third, a learnedconvention among Hindu scholars calls all non-Vedic practice tantric (see VedicHinduism), particularly domestic and women's rites. Practicing tantrics pay lessattention to scripture than to personal transmission from their Guru and topsycho-experimental manipulations.2. Tantric literature. Hindu tantrics are at pains to show that their texts aretruly Vedic. Their apologetic centers almost entirely on asserting Vedicrespectability, because mainstream Hindus kept attributing clandestine andnefarious actions to them. Since Buddhist tantric teachings were absorbed intothe Vajrayana canon, Tibetan tantrics never felt such need for legitimation.Hindu tantric texts are a distinct, less respected, and often censured corpus,having canonical status only for the rather small audience of learnedo258 AGE HAN AN DA Bharatitantrics, few of whom are Brahmins. In fact, tantrism is overtlyanti-brah-manical (though not anti-Vedic) and can be seen as a rebellion againstBrahmin sacerdotalism. 3. History of Tantrism. Although the roots of thistradition are very ancient, the material was reduced to writing only later. Thefirst tantric works were Buddhist, e.g. the Manjusrlmulakalpa \"radicalinstitutions of ManjusrI\" and the Guhyasamdjatantra \"tantra of secretassociation,\" both compiled between A.D. 300 and 600. The first authentic andextant Hindu tantric texts are the Mahdnirvanatantra \"tantra of the greatliberation\" of the eleventh century and the Kauldvalinirnaya \"description of thegarland of adepts\" of approximately the fourteenth century. These texts derivemuch of their raw material from folk sources which may reach back into pre-Vedictimes. The manipulation of chthonic powers, the psychodynamic experimentationunderlying tantrism, is much closer in form and content to what many scholarsnow perceive as Indian contrasting with Aryan on the subcontinent. The robust,extrovert, philosophically naive tenor of the Vedas, the books of the Aryans,differs sharply from tantric style and lore, tantric apologetic notwithstanding.Tantrism became strong in area of late or weak Aryan, Brahmanical penetration.There is some support for the notion that the earliest era (see Indus ValleyCivilization) contained proto-tantric elements like ithyphallic representationsof a fertility god. If there is a connection, the origins of tantrism couldindeed be placed as far back as 2500 B.C. The early portions of the Vedasindicate strong opposition to phallic worship. In later sections, however,phallic ritual was accepted and established (see Linga). By about 1000 B.C.,phallic lore was apparently well established.Since the tantric style originated with non-Aryan segments of the population, itremained identified with low-caste ritual. Tantrics courted, trained, andrevered teachers of low-caste background who were barred from Vedic ceremony.This included women and non-Hinduized tribal groups.In buddhist trantrism being female or of low caste was a positive qualification.In theory at least, Brahmins were disqualified from tantric apprenticeship, butmost of the later commentators on tantric codes were Brahmins, particularly fromBengal, a region where even Brahmins are largely non-vegetarian and often givento the worship of mother-goddesses.After the destruction of two main centers of Buddhist learning by a Muslimchieftain in the eleventh century, tantric Buddhism retained ecclesiastic statusonly in Tibet. \\ few pockets of Vajrayana institutions probably survived intothe fourteenth century in northeastern and southwestern India, after which timeit was defunct in India.Organized Hindu tantrism peaked between the ninth and the fourteenth centuriesunder feudal and royal patronage. The decline of sophisticated, scripturaltantrism coincided with and was accelerated by new rural cults of monotheisticdevotionalism (see Bhakti Hinduism), which shared an anti-erotic, puritanicalideology. To the teachers and followers of these cults, tantrism epitomized allthat was reprehensible, to be shunned and rejected pri-marily because of its sensuous overtones, and secondarily due to its being tiedin the popular mind to magical practices.4. Tantric teachings. The theologies of tantrism are not fundamentally differentfrom those of mainline Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism; it was tantric practicewhich roused the ire of the orthodox.a) Hindu tantrism theologically largely overlaps with the monistic school (seeAdvaita), which postulates a single existent, Brahman (neuter), defined as\"being-consciousness-ecstasy,\" sacciddnanda. Multiplicity is a delusion (seeMaya) and the intuitive, irreversible realization of numerical oneness withBrahman implies liberation. The tantric seeker, however, conceptualizes Brahmanas the union of the male and female principles; namely, Shiva (benign) and Sakti(energy). In this initial polarity the male stands for the quiescent, forcognition, and for wisdom. The female represents action, conation, and theenergetic elan. While Shiva and Sakti belong to the general pantheon, they arehere transmuted into the cosmic principles of cognition and action. \"Theuniverse arises through the copulation of Shiva and Sakti.\" The process isreversed in the experience of the individual adept who by applying the propertechniques realizes that even that cosmic duality is illusion and that theultimate reality is the nondual Brahman. This knowledge dissolves the adept'sego and the impersonal Absolute shines forth. The successful practitioner, whileidentifying with Shiva if he is male and with Sakti if female, eventuallytranscends this partial, albeit divine duality to be the Absolute.b) Buddhist tantrism (see Vajrayana) postulates the exactly obverse polarity.Here the male principle is Buddhahood, active, outgoing, energetic. It is themeans (Skt. upaya) of emancipation and compassion (Skt. karuna) as instantiatedby the numerous Buddhas and Bodhisattvas (see Buddhism) and visualized in sexualembrace with their female counterparts, which represent the quiescent, static,wisdom principle (Skt. prajha). The two poles are symbolically juxtaposed as the\"diamond\" (Skt. vajra, hence Vajrayana), conjoined with the \"bell\" (Skt. ghanta)representing the womb. The intuitive knowledge of their underlying onenesspropels the aspirant from the experimentally fertile yet ephemeral karuna-prajnamodel into the liberating, incontrovertible knowledge of momentariness andvoidness (Skt. sunyata), again in line with mainstream Mahayana doctrines. Theone who interiorizes this knowledge realizes that both worldly being (Samsara)and salvation (Nirvana) have no essence, and that Nirvana and samsara areidentical.c)]aina tantric teachings differ in no way from the atomistic doctrines of theofficial texts (see Jainism). The distinction between orthodox and tantricJainism lies entirely in the tantrics' emphasis on meditations using Mantras,particularly those pertaining to the goddess PadmavatI, the tutelary deity ofJaina tantrics.5. Practice and meditation are ranked far above scriptural and all othertheological knowledge in all tantric schools. The basic difference betweenortho-practical yoga (see patanjali) and other mainstream Hindu, Buddhist, andJaina meditation on the one side, and tantric practice on the other, lies inwhat makes tantrism suspect to the orthodox: its full harnessing rather than therenunciation and rejection of the senses and its maximizing of the sensuouspersonality in contrast to the ascetic style of the official traditions.Hindu tantrism of the \"right hand\" (daksindcdra) is coextensive with allnonbrahmanical ritualistic performance. The critical break with mainstreamHinduism occurs in the \"left way\" (vdma-mdrga) practices. The aspirant mustfirst master the usual techniques of physical control (see Hatha Yoga) beforeproceeding to the more esoteric meditations. \"Hatha Yoga is to tantric yoga whata B.A. is to a Ph.D. degree\" a modern tantric explained. Next, the aspirantlearns to raise the \"dormant power\" (see Kundalini) within himself or herself.It is here that the discipline diverges from orthodox yogic practice, which is asolitary procedure. The neophyte is initiated into a \"circle\" (cakra) of fellowaspirants consisting of an equal number of male and female disciples, guided bya male adept (cakresvara) and his adept female consort (cak-resvarl). All maleparticipants are designated as Shiva, all female ones as Sakti. The latter sitto the left of their male counterparts—hence \"left-handed\" tantra. The conveningof a cakra is controlled by complex astrological and ritualistic preparations.The ritual commences with prolonged chanting of Vedic and tantric texts. Eachparticipant then silently meditates on the special formula (see Mantra) given toher or him by the guru, who may or may not be the cakresvara, while the latterkeeps chanting the requisite hymns. At this stage, the participants imbibeimpressive quanitites of \"victory\" vijayd, a sandhd-term for cannabis sativa(i.e., marijuana) blended with sherbet and sweet milk. This introduces the coresegment of the exercise, namely the seriatim use of the \"five Ms\" (panca-makdra), which stand for the initial letters of the Sanskrit words for the main\"ingredients\" (i.e., fish [mat-sya], meat [mdmsa], parched grain or kidney beanbelieved to be aphrodisiacs [mudrd], liquor [mada], and finally sexual union[maithuna]). All these are highly stylized events with little leeway forinnovation. During the last phase, the Saktis place themselves astride theirShivas and initiate copu-latory movement, in line with the doctrinal notion ofwoman as energy and man as quiescent. Since \"Shiva without Sakti is (like a)corpse,\" no tantric male can achieve emancipation without being thus aided by aSakti.The key technique within this ritual is retention of semen during maithuna. Itis in effect a ritualized coitus reservatus for the avowed purpose of achievingsimultaneous control of mind, breath, and semen. This technique is seen as ashortcut, albeit a dangerous one, to moksa. Tantrics aver that this successfullycontrolled maithuna rushes the kundalini upward into the \"thousand-petalledlotus\" atop the subtle body, merging the Shiva and Sakti principles. Thisexplains, in part at least, the importance and the ubiquity of the phallic shapeof the Shiva icon (see Lin ga) as joined to the pitha \"seat, vulva.\" Shiva mustnot be formally worshiped in any anthropomorphic form like other deities; thelihga-pitha icon is mandatory (see Yoni). Shiva is the tutelary god of allascetics, the \"vanquisher of Cupid.\" The contradiction is only appart theithyphallic representation is nonpriapic. It implies com-plete control as retention of semen at the point of orgasm. The nonejaculatoryunion of the tantric adepts thus reenacts the cosmic resorptive union, just asregular coitus culminating in ejaculation replicates the priapic, procreativeaspect of Shiva and Sakti.6. Buddhist tantric practice (see Vajrayana) is based on similarpsycho-experimental principles, but the actual copulation between thepractitioners is less formalized. In Vajrayana practice today the preliminaryexercises take up a much larger portion than sexual congress; in fact, thelatter element is now often eliminated. Meditation consists in increasinglycomplex visualizations of and gradual identification with divinities of theVajrayana pantheon. (See Mandala.) The advanced practitioners interiorize the\"honorable father and honorable mother\" (Tibetan yah yum) imagery of the deitiesin sexual embrace. Where there is actual copulation, retention of semen isaxiomatic: \"having brought down the vajra into the lotus, let him not eject theknowledge mind.\" Such use of code or \"intentional language\" is a feature sharedby Hindu and Buddhist tantrism. It serves as key terminology for the initiatesand as a means to screen the teachings from outsiders. \"Knowledge-mind\"(bodhicitta) for example, is a code term for semen.Not part of the formal ritual, consumption of alcohol is accepted and evenrecommended by some meditation masters preceding the practice of visualizationand interiorization.7. Places and calendars. Neither Buddhist nor Hindu tantrics adhere to aspecific calendar of festivals and celebrations—there are no tantric festivalsper se. However, certain regional festivals connected with the worship of femaledeities are regarded as auspicious occasions for tantric practice. There is avery large number of such shrines on the subcontinent, but the majority ofpilgrims are hardly aware of the site's tantric significance.8. Tantric art is a term of recent Western origin. Yet is is safe to assume thatmost of the erotic imagery on Hindu shrines, especially in southern andsoutheastern India, is due to tantric inspiration. Muslim chiefs destroyed alarge number of shrines in northern India, which accounts for the virtualabsence of erotic sculpture in that area. Such representations were and areabominations to Muslims, Christian missionaries, and modern puritanical Hindus.Nepalese Hindu temples display an abundance of such imagery. The best known andmost readily accessible shrines are Khajuraho in central India, konarak, Purl,and Bhuvaneshvar in the eastern State of Orissa, and hundreds of shrines in thesouth.Tibetan and Nepalese Vajrayana has generated and continues to produce tantricartifacts in quantity, and some of exquisite craftsmanship as well. Painted silkand paper scrolls (thanka), yah yum bronzes particularly from Nepal, andvajra-ghanta bell metal representations have entered the international market inquantity after the Chinese occupation of Tibet.9. Current trends indicate a steady decline of Hindu tantrism and a strongrevival of Buddhist tantra in the diaspora in North America and Western Europe.India's official culture being puritanical and its threshold of tolerance low,tantrism is virtually blacklisted by administrators. In the late 1950s therewere sporadic police actions against tantric centers like that of Pagli Baba, aneminent tantric in Orissa. Sri Rajneesh, a psychology lecturer turned tantricguru, attracts large Indian and foreign audiences in Bombay. He concocted hisown version of tantrism, incorporating enough general urban Hinduism to make ittolerated in spite of some protest. Yogi Bhajan, a Sikh customs officer turnedguru in California, teaches a blend of hardline Sikhism and kundalini yoga. Hedistinguishes between \"white\" (acceptable) and \"red\" (wicked) tantrism, termsentirely of his own invention. Ananda Marg, whose leader was acquitted of acharge of murder of some renegade disciples, has a large, monastically garbedfollowing in India and chapters on many North American college campuses andrepresents itself as tantrism. (See Hinduism in America 2.)On the popular level, tantric practice has been observed and reported over thepast three decades, and there is no reason to believe that its occurrences havesignificantly increased or decreased. Groups of male tantrics gather in remoteforest areas and meet with women who seek the same powers or who have beenpersuaded to participate \"for pleasure.\" The women divest themselves of theirblouses (hence \"way of the blouse\" for this ritual), which they place on oneheap. The men then approach, each of them picking one blouse. Each man thenenters into a one-night liaison with the owner of the blouse. This guaranteesrandomness, which is part of the tantric notion that the \"other woman\"(para-strl, i.e., either not the practitioner's wife, or another man's wife) ispara-sakti (the highest power), the prefix para meaning both \"other\" and\"highest.\" There is little chanting, except for some preparatory invocations inthe vernacular language, interspersed with some Sanskrit mantras. There is noinsistence on retention of semen during the act. The target of the rite is notliberation, but occult powers. Modern Hindus who hear about these events condemnthem as \"dirty\" and \"superstitious,\" and as things Hinduism must reject if it isto survive in this age of science.The energetic missionary work of a number of learned Tibetan lamas in the Westhas, by contrast, created nuclei of serious Vajrayana practice in Europe andAmerica. The number of expatriate Tibetan monks is on the increase, addingleadership and direction to Occidentals who seek this experience, a thing whichwas totally impossible before Buddhism's forced exit from Tibet. No tantrics areleft in Chinese-occupied Tibet, and the Tibetan refugees settled in India arebound to assume the prevailing Indian mores which frown upon c soteric practice.Unit VIIIFrom Psychology to Spirituality: Kundalini Yoga PartnThe Synthesis of Yogas: Hatha,Raja, and TantraHARIDAS CHAUDHURIHaridas Chaudhuri brought the teachings of Sri Aurobindo, a well-known moderninterpreter ofTantrism in India, to the United States where he taught for manyyears. In this selection, Chaudhuri presents an interpretation of Tantra thatconforms to many modern views of the application of religious theories to thesolution of human problems. In both India and the West many modern seekers forreligious values are motivated by the desire to live a life that is healthier,that liberates one from the anxieties brought about by the pressures ofcontemporary life. Chaudhuri's interpretation of Tantra is, therefore,\"revisionist\" to a certain extent. It offers an approach to Tantra that is notheavily driven by the esoteric and erotic tendencies that, in the classicalIndian tradition itself, were regarded as fully appropriate only for a smallgroup of individuals. Chaudhuri sees aspects of Tantra that are universallyapplicable.Integral Yoga represents the crowning fulfilment of the traditional yoga systemsof India. It takes note of their limitations and one-sided tendencies. And itincorporates their inherent truths in a higher synthesis.Broadly speaking, there are six traditional systems of yoga; Hatha, Raja,Tantra, Jnana, Bhakti, and Karma.HATHA YOGAtlathayoga is the system which starts with the body. Body and mind being closelyinterrelated, it aims at mastery over the mind. Control of nervous and vitalenergies produces control of mental functions. The mind-body complex beingbrought under perfect control, the in-dwelling spirit shines out and the higherself is realized.Hatha is derived from the roots, ha (sun) and tha (moon). Hatha is theequalization and stabilization of the \"sun breath\" (i.e., the breath which flowsthrough the right nostril) and the \"moon breath\" (i.e., the breath which flowsthrough the left nostril;. Hatha also means violence, force. Through theregulation of the physiological processes, Hathayoga forcibly releases thedormant energies of human personality.The principal steps of Hathayoga are dsana and pranayama. Asana consists ofcertain bodily postures such as lotus posture, hero posture, head stand,shoulder stand, etc. They are designed to stimulate the glands, vitalize thebody, and strengthen the nervous system. Purified and strengthened nerves arethe most important pre-requisite of yogic practice.Prdndydma means control of the vital energy through breath-regulation. It aimsat mastery over the vital forces which are operative in the body. Throughcontrol of breath and mobilization of vital forces, it endeavors to secure therelease and free flow of the fundamental psycho-physical energy (kundalini)latent in the human system. This root energy being dynamized, the individual isset on the path leading to his reintegration with the ultimate ground ofexistence.It is believed that one who acquires success in Hathayoga gains supernormalpowers. He enjoys vibrant health, youthfulness and longevity. He attainsspiritual liberation and supernal bliss.The chief merit of Hathayoga lies in its insistence upon the basic importance ofthe body. Various bodily postures and breathing exercises recommended inHathayoga are very effective means of developing the body as a fit and stronginstrument of higher spiritual living. Mystics who have neglected the bodilyfactor, have suffered immensely on the physical plane. They have suffered fromdisease and disability, and have met with premature death. Profound spiritualexperiences put an inordinate strain on the nervous system. They often come withthe impact of a rushing flood. Without a prior bodily training and nervousfirmness, many mystics fail to stand that impact. They are carried off by wavesof emotion; they sing, dance, cry, and roll on the floor, failing to convert theflood of emotion into calm creative energy. Hathayoga can prepare and fortifyone against this kind of mishap.The chief defect of Hathayoga lies in its over-emphasis upon the physical sideof existence. The body is sometimes almost deified. Preoccupation with the bodyproduces excessive self-concern. Acquisition of supernormal powers and the blissof personal salvation loom large on the mental horizon. An indifference to theaffairs of the world and the requirements of society is generated. Not muchinterest is left for higher cultural pursuits. The need for intellectualdevelopment is not sufficiently recognized. The danger of going astray throughselfish appropriation of whatever unusual power is gained is rampant. Thespectacle of Hathayogis making a vainglorious display in public of theirextraordinary bodily control is not an uncommon sight. It is such misguidedpersons who have brought much disrepute upon the fair name of yoga.RAJA YOGAWhereas Hathayoga starts with the body, Rdjayoga starts with the mind. It workswith the mental apparatus considered as a whole. It endeavours to achieve acomplete cessation of all mental functions, so that the light of the indwellingspirit may shine out. It recommends no doubt the methods of bodily posture(asana) and breath-control (prdndydma), but it does not require the practice ofthem in their full elaborateness as developed by Hathayoga. On the contrary itadapts them to its central purpose of mental calmness, balance and equilibrium.Of the numerous forms of bodily posture it specially selects that which keepsthebody motionless in the fittest and most comfortable position helpful to thepractice of breath-control and meditation. It recommends breathing exerciseswith a view to harmonizing the vital forces of the body, so that the obstructiveelements of ignorance, inertia and restlessness may be removed.Prior to the practice of bodily posture and breath-control, Rdjayoga stressesthe need for adequate ethico-religious training. The powers of body and mind arelikely to be abused if the right spiritual foundation has not already been laid.The ethico-religious training recommended in Rdjayoga consists of two steps:moral discipline (yama) and religious observances (niyama).Moral discipline includes the practice of non-violence (ahirhsd), truthfulness(satya), non-stealing (asteya), control of the sexual impulse (brahmacarya), andabstinence from greed or avariciousness involving non-acceptance of unnecessarygifts from those whose motives are questionable (aparigraha). Religiousobservances include the practice of internal and external purity (sauca),contentment implying the principle of plain living and high thinking (santosa),endurance of hardship and adverse circumstances (tapas), devoted study ofspiritually ennobling books (swddhydya) and self-surrender to the Divineilswara-pranidhdna).The fifth important step in Rdjayoga is self-withdrawal (pratydhara). It is thewithdrawal of the senses from their external objects. It is the act oftranscending the natural world. It should not be misconstrued as absolute andfinal world negation. It is the methodological device of temporarily settingaside the world with a view to inquiring with sustained energy into the natureof the spirit. It corresponds to what Edmund Husserl has called \"thephenomenological reduction.\" It is the method of putting into brackets the wholenatural world, without paying any attention to the question whether the world isreal or unreal and without using any \"judgement that concerns spatio-temporalexistence.\" The idea is to gain thereby full freedom and untrammelled energy ininvestigating the field of consciousness. When the question concerning theontological status of the natural world is set aside, the contents and functionsof consciousness can be observed in their essence as pure phenomena.As an aspect of spiritual practice, pratydhara implies a shift in attention fromthe impulsive to the higher values of life. It signifies one's dissatisfactionwith exclusive pre-occupation with material values or with the traditional andconventional mode of living. It involves what Plato has called \"divinediscontent.\" It involves a kind of \"metaphysical rebellion\" against man'scondition in the universe. Pratydhara is one's readiness to plunge into theunchartered sea of deeper self-inquiry and critical investigation into themeaning of life. It is the disengagement of the self from unthinking attachmentto the not-self. It aims at transcending the world of false identifications andillusory projections in a deep search for the unconditioned spiritual reality.In order to achieve the ultimate goal of freedom, pratydhara has to besupplemented by three other processes, namely, concentration (dharand)meditation (dhydna) and self-integration (samddhi).Concentration is the focusing of all mental energies upon one object, onecentral idea, or one relevant truth. It releases latent energies of the psycheandmarshalls all psychic forces in a definite direction. Meditation is the higherphase of concentration. It is the free and uninterrupted flow of thought in onedirection, centering round a definite theme. That theme may be the self, or pureexistence, or the supreme value. It purifies the inner being, thoroughlycleanses the mental apparatus, and removes all unconscious obstructions to theunitary functioning of personality. It prepares the ground for self-integrationor existential self-awareness (samddhi).At first, existential self-awareness takes place on the mental level. This iscalled savikalpa samddhi. At this stage a person sees his own image reflectedclearly and distinctly, as if on a flawless mirror or on the tranquil andtransparent water of a pool. His purified mind, emancipated from the drive ofdesire and the taint of ignorance, is such a mirror. But still what is seen hereis only an image of the self, the self known objectively, not the subjectivereality of the self. So one has to advance still farther. At the next higherstage, the mental level is transcended. All mental functioning comes to a stop.The mirror or the pool disappears. A man now knows himself just by being his owntrue self. It is no more his image in a mirror that is seen, but his innermostreality. This is called nirvikalpa samddhi. This unobstructed and unmediatedself-abiding is the essence of spiritual liberation according to Rdjayoga.Now, integral yoga fully appreciates the perfection of the technique which hasbeen elaborately developed by Rdjayoga. But it points out that the methods ofRdjayoga are tailored to the concept of static realization of the self in itspure transcendence. They are not quite adequate for the purpose of dynamicself-identification with the Divine immanently operative in history. They arenot quite suitable for man's intelligent co-operation with the creative force ofcosmic evolution. For the fulfilment of the latter purpose, an active dedicationfrom the very beginning to the cosmic purpose of existence is imperativelynecessary. Rdjayoga emphasizes the method of mental tranquillization as a meansof attaining static self-realization. The danger of life negation, even thoughnot a necessary sequel, is present in this approach. According to integral yoga,simultaneously with the processes of inward self-purification and mentalserenity, active participation in life is essential. Social, cultural andhumanitarian activities pursued in a spirit of self-offering to the Divine arean indispensable adjunct to the inward processes of concentration andmeditation.TANTRIC YOGATdntric yoga is also known as Kundalinl or Kundall yoga. It has some noteworthycharacteristics of its own.Tdntric yoga is closely connected with the worship of God as the supreme Mother.The Divine has two inseparable aspects: the archetypal masculine (Siva), thearchetypal feminine (Sakti). Siva is pure Being, timeless perfection, eternalwisdom, logos. Sakti is the power of Becoming, the creative energy of time, thejoy and love of self-expression, eros. Sakti is the Divine Mother who mediatesbetween Being and the flux of becoming, between the Absolute and the sphere ofrelativity, between eternal perfection and the ceaseless flow oftime. On the one hand Sakti is the medium of manifestation of the infinite inthe finite. On the other hand she is the medium of self-fulfilment of the finitein the infinite. So the most natural approach for those who desire perfection isto seek the help, guidance and grace of the dynamic Divine.The world as the manifestation of energy is an unceasing process, a perpetualflow. Our life is movement and action. But all movements, acts and processesultimately flow from the universal creative energy, Sakti. This universal energycannot be blind and unconscious. Nor is it conscious in the way in which thehuman mind is conscious. It is infinitely superior to human consciousness indepth of insight and breadth of vision. Having created the human individual,Sakti enters into him and dwells within him as his main support and centre ofgravity. This dynamic nucleus, the central psycho-physical power latent in man,is called Kundalinl, the coiled power (the serpent energy). The serpent whileresting stays in coiled form, and while moving and acting it uncoils itself.Similarly, the creative energy has its dormant and dynamic, static and kineticaspects. Different vital functions such as respiration, digestion, procreation,elimination, etc. are different modes of operation of the Kundalinl. Differentmental functions such as perception, reflection, emotion, volition, etc. arealso modes of manifestation of the Kundalinl. Science teaches us that in thestructure of an atom, there are electrons or negative charges of electricitywhich move round a positive nucleus which is apparently static. Likewise, in thehuman organism there are numerous vital and mental functions which are centrallysupported by the positive nucleus of the Kundalinl.Tantric yoga is the art of splitting the spiritual atom in man. It is thetechnique of releasing the pent-up energies of the human psyche. When the Kundalinl is dynamized, the individual experiences a tremendous upsurge of energyfrom within. He feels it as the power of God working within him. He feels thathe is being guided from within, with infinite patience and love, by the DivineMother. A re-orientation of his outlook towards spiritual values takes place. Adeep longing for the eternal leaps into flame. New vistas of thought are opened.Centres of extra-sensory perception are stimulated. The search for the ultimateis intensified.According to Tantric yoga true spiritual development begins with the awakeningof the Kundalinl. Prior to this awakening, all ethical and religious practicesare in the nature of self-preparation. They purify the heart of the individualand direct his attention to the spiritual destiny of life. After the Kundalinlis awakened, spiritual growth seems to be guided no more by the ego but by adeeper power within. Meditation becomes in a sense effortless and spontaneous. Aprocess of deepening self-awareness and joyful self-expansion sets in.Unconscious motivations are gradually brought to light, and a genuine spirit ofdedication to the Divine begins to permeate the whole being.According to Tantric yoga, the ultimate goal of spiritual effort is the union ofthe dynamic and static aspects of personality. We have noted that Tantra affirmsthe reality of God as the unity of timeless perfection (Siva) and the dynamismof time (Sakti). Man who is an image of God is also essentially the unity of thepower of becoming and the perfection of being. Through social, cultural, ethicalandreligious activities, man prepares himself for the fulfilment of his spiritualdestiny. The practice of yoga, which involves self-energizing andself-transcending, advances him to a higher phase of spiritual growth. Thisprocess of growth is carried to perfection when the timeless dimension ofexistence is discovered. In Kundalini yoga union with the timeless is believedto be total and complete. It is not simply union through the intellect or theheart. It is a kind of total psychophysical union. It is the union of one'stotal self-energy with the timeless ground of being. Symbolically, it isrepresented as a sort of mystic marriage (ma-hdmaithuna) between the feminineand the masculine aspects of personality— between the principles of basic energyand pure existence. A flood of delight is released from this mystic union. Onall the levels of body and mind indescribable waves of joy are experienced.Tdntric yoga is boldly affirmative in its methodological approach. Other yogasystems have laid much stress upon renunciation and desirelessness as essentialaids to liberation. But Tdntric yoga affirms the need for intelligent andorganized fulfilment of natural desires. In its view there is no basicantagonism between nature and spirit. Nature is the creative power of spirit inthe objective sphere. Nobody therefore can enter the kingdom of spirit withoutfirst obtaining a passport from nature. Practice of austerity, asceticism andself-mortification is an insult to nature. It creates more difficulties than itcan solve. By weakening the body and producing inner conflicts and tensions, itundermines balanced and healthy development. It is only by following the spiritof nature that one can swim with the current and capture the kingdom of heavenby storm.Worship of the Divine Mother implies appreciation of the presence of profoundwisdom in nature, both external and internal. There is a principle of cosmicintelligence operative in external nature. It controls the process of cosmicevolution. Similarly, there is deep wisdom inherent in man's inner nature, inhis unconscious psyche. It secretly determines his inner evolution. If a personintelligently follows the bent of his own nature, his desires become more andmore refined and lofty. Base desires gradually yield place to noble desires.Lower impulses are replaced by higher impulses. When a child's natural desire toplay with toys is duly satisfied, it is soon outgrown yielding place to a keeninterest in books or living playmates. When a man's natural desire for sex islawfully satisfied, it gives rise to a growing interest in social welfare orhumanitarian service. When his desire for enjoying the world is duly satisfiedon the basis of intelligent self-organization, one day it gives rise to a deeperlonging for Transcendence.So Tdntric yoga prescribes what is called desireful prayer and worship isakdmaupdsand). All natural desires are accepted as modes of manifestation of thecreative spirit of nature. The problem is to organize them intelligently with aview to the maximum satisfaction and fulfilment of one's nature. There is divinesanction behind such self-fulfilment. One can also invoke divine blessings insuch self-fulfilment. One places one's desires before God, and then, with God'ssanction and sanctification, proceeds to fulfil them in a spirit ofself-offering to the Divine. This brings about an increasing refinement andspiritual transformation of one's desire-nature. A constructive channelling ofthe libido towards the higher ends of existence takes place.Tantra believes in the principle of'like cures like.' When a person suffers fromwater in his ears, the doctor injects more water into his ear drums so that allthe accumulated water comes out. When a person gets sick on account of a certainkind of poison inside his body, the doctor may prescribe for him the same kindof poison to be taken in the right dose in medicinal form. When a person fallsdown to the ground, it is with the support of the ground that he jumps to hisfeet again. Similarly, it is with the help of passion that the problem ofpassion can be solved. Sensuous desires and personal ambitions are usuallycondemned as impediments to spiritual progress. Cravings for delicacies, forsex, for stimulants, etc., as well as longings for wealth, social position,political power, etc., are often regarded by religion as temptations of thedevil. But Tantra says: \"All these desires ultimately come from the divine will.In the final analysis they are aids to the process of evolution and progress.The important thing is to fulfil them with that understanding in a spirit ofco-operation with the creative force of evolution. The creative force ofevolution is no other than the divine will immanent in the world process. Themore a person co-operates with the evolutionary impetus, the more his desiresare purged of the egotistic taint and are transmuted into the pure flame ofaspiration for divine life.\" This is the underlying truth of the Tantric theoryof the five Ms. Such ingredients as wine (Madya), meat (Mamsa), fish (Matsya),parched cereal (Mudra), and sexual union (Mai-thuna) are considered valuableaids to vigorous growth and development. They represent different modes ofmanifestation of energy. Those who can make profitable use of them, in unionwith the supreme creative power, towards the ends of harmonious self-developmentand social progress, belong to the heroic type of yogi.It may be observed here that the affirmative approach of Tantric yoga contains aprecious element of truth. It is a protest against the extreme tendencies ofasceticism, self-mortification, world and life negation, etc. It affirms natureas the dynamism of spirit. It affirms life as the diversified expression oftranscendence. But it has often the tendency to carry the spirit of affirmationtoo far. Over-emphasis upon life affirmation may prove as misleading as overemphasis upon ascetic renunciation. The balanced spiritual ideal lies midwaybetween these two extremes. When people develop a strong ascetic tendency, it isnecessary to tell them about the positive significance of life, nature andsociety. On the other hand, when people become too affirmative in following theway of nature, it is desirable to tell them about the transcendent glory of thespirit. Otherwise, one may get lost in the labyrinth of desire and practiseself-deception in the name of religion. That is why we find that a huge amountof malpractice came in course of time to be associated with Tantric yoga. Sexualpromiscuity is sometimes sanctioned as a mode of concerted power worship. Blackmagic puts on the religious mask. Ruthless slaughter of animals is approved assymbolic self-sacrifice to God.Even though Tantric yoga is affirmative in its method and approach, it differslittle from asceticism with regard to the ultimate goal of spiritual effort. TheTantric method of life affirmation is also designed oftener than not tostaticallyblissful union with the formless consciousness of the eternal. It has been said:\"When Kundali 'sleeps' man is awake to this world. When she 'awakes' he sleeps,that is, loses all consciousness of the world and enters his causal body. InYoga he passes beyond to formless Consciousness.\" Thus here again we come acrossthe ideal of static and transcendent realization inherent in traditionalmysticism. At this point integral yoga wishes to remind us emphatically thatstatic and formless consciousness is not the ultimate goal. The formlessnontemporal is only one aspect of Being. The evolving world of endless forms isanother no less important aspect of Being. Our goal is to join forces with theevolution of higher forms and values in union with the formless depth of Being.The concept of total union with the eternal is a very significant contributionof Tantra. We have to be integrated with Being not only by way of contemplationor devotion or love. Our entire existence including the physical and theunconscious has to be lifted up to the thrilling touch of the eternal. Theconscious and unconscious aspects of our being have to be unified. The staticand dynamic aspects of our personality have to be harmonized. But this notion oftotal union could not be developed in Tantra to its furthest logical sequel onaccount of limitations imposed by medieval metaphysics. Medieval metaphysicsconceived of the inmost essence of Being in terms of transcendence and eternity.It had no adequate comprehension of the ontological significance of evolutionand history.In conformity with the metaphysical outlook of the age, total union is envisagedin Tantra as the union of a man's entire personality with formless eternity. Thecentral psycho-physical energy (Kundali) is awakened so that with his wholebeing the yogi may experience the transcendent bliss of the absolute, havingcompletely withdrawn himself from the world of form and change. Now, strictlyspeaking, this is not total union in the full sense of the term. The eternal isincomplete without the historical. Perfection is incomplete without evolution.The creative flow of time is an essential factor in the structure of eternity.So total union must imply that while we are anchored in the timeless foundationof Being, we have to act in our historical situations as dynamic centres ofBeing. The ultimate purpose of the transformation of our physical and vitalnature is to prepare us for the supreme task of life. That task is to establishhigher values in society and to manifest the glories of eternity in time.Thus in integral yoga the notion of total union develops into integral union. Itis the union of the total self with total reality. It implies union with thecreative force of evolution as well as union with the immutable joy of eternity.Contact with the eternal brings supreme wisdom and joy and love into our being.But wisdom, joy and love cannot be divorced from action. To know God is to loveGod. To love God is to serve God. To glimpse the will of God is to act for theglory of God in the world. Such action is co-operation with the creative forceof evolution, because the latter is another name for the will of God operativein the world process. Enlightened action is indeed of the very essence of humanreality. Through such action we joyfully participate in the movement of time,anchored in the serenity of the timeless. So it may be stated that integralunion is the union of wisdom, love and action. It is union with historv as wellas with transcendence.TantraHEINRICH ZIMMERThe following selection from Heinrich Zimmers major work on Indian philosophywas edited by Joseph Campbell, who, like Zimmer, was familiar with the specialrole played by the Bengali saint of the nineteenth century, Sri Ramakrishna, inthe revitalization of Hinduism. Ramakrishna was the quintessential Hindu and yethe opened up Hinduism to its vocation to become a universal religion in a waythat no one else did. He saw that the truths of religion are universal and thatHinduism was uniquely equipped to express that universalism because of itstradition of a multiplicity of \"paths\" to the final goal of spiritualemancipation.WHO SEEKS NIRVANA?1 he later Buddhist change of attitude toward the final goal is paralleledexactly by the contemporary Hindu development. As we have seen, in Hinayanausage the term bodhisattva denoted a great being on the point of becoming aBuddha and so passing from time to nirvana, an archetype of the Buddhistlay-initiate escaping from the world, whereas in the Mahayana the concept wastranslated into a time-reaffirming symbol of universal saviorship. Throughrenouncing Buddhahood the Bodhisattva made it clear that the task of moksa,\"release, liberation, redemption from the vicissitudes of time,\" was not thehighest good; in fact, that moksa is finally meaningless, samsara and nirvanabeing equally of the nature of sunyata, \"emptiness, the void.\" In the samespirit the Hindu Tantric initiate exclaims: \"Who seeks nirvana?\" \"What is gainedby moksa?\" \"Water mingles with water.\"This point of view is rendered in many of the conversations of Sri Ramakrishnawith his lay disciples.\"Once upon a time,\" he told them one evening, \"a sannyasin entered the temple ofJagganath. As he looked at the holy image he debated within himself whether Godhad a form or was formless. He passed his staff from left to right to feelwhether it touched the image. The staff touched nothing. He understood thatthere was no image before him; he concluded that God was formless. Next hepassed the staff from right to left. It touched the image. The sannyasinunderstood that God had form. Thus he realized that God has form and, again, isformless.\"\"What is vijnana?\" he said on another occasion. \"It is knowing God in a specialway. The awareness and conviction that fire exists in wood is jnana, knowledge.But to cook rice on that fire, eat the rice, and get nourishment from it isvijnana. To know by one's inner experience that God exists is jnana. But to talkto Him, to enjoy Him as Child, as Friend, as Master, as Beloved, is vijnana. Therealization that God alone has become the universe and all living beings isvijnana.\"And with respect to the ideal of becoming annihilate in Brahman, he wouldsometimes say, quoting the poet Ramprasad, \"I love to eat sugar, I do not wantto become sugar.\"The Mahayana Bodhisattva tastes unending saviorship by devoting himself withabsolute selflessness to his teaching task in the vortex of the world; in thesame spirit, the Hindu Tantric initiate, by persevering in the dualisticattitude of devotion (bhakti), enjoys without cease the beatitude of theknowledge of the omnipresence of the Goddess.\"The Divine Mother revealed to me in the Kalmi temple that it was She who hadbecome everything,\" Sri Ramakrishna told his friends. \"She showed me thateverything was full of Consciousness. The Image was Consciousness, the altar wasConsciousness, the water-vessels were Consciousness, the doorsill wasConsciousness, the marble floor was Consciousness—all was Consciousness. I foundeverything inside the room soaked, as it were, in Bliss—the Bliss ofSatcid-ananda. 1 I saw a wicked man in front of the Kali temple; but in him alsoI saw the Power of the Divine Mother vibrating. That was why I fed a cat withthe food that was to be offered to the Divine Mother.\"\"The jrianl, sticking to the path of knowledge,\" he explained again, \"alwaysreasons about the Reality, saying, 'Not this, not this.' Brahman is neither'this' nor 'that'; It is neither the universe nor its living beings. Reasoningin this way, the mind becomes steady. Then it disappears and the aspirant goesinto sam-adhi. This is the Knowledge of Brahman. It is the unwavering convictionof the jriaT that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory, like a dream.What Brahman is cannot be described. One cannot even say that Brahman is aPerson. This is the opinion of the jrianls, the followers of Vedanta philosophy.\"But the bhaktas accept all the states of consciousness. They take the wakingstate to be real also. They don't think the world to be illusory, like a dream.They say that the universe is a manifestation of God's power and glory. God hascreated all these—sky, stars, moon, sun, mountains, ocean, men, animals. Theyconstitute His glory. He is within us, in our hearts. Again, He is outside. Themost advanced devotees say that He Himself has become all this—the twenty-fourcosmic principles, the universe, and all living beings. The devotee of God wantsto eat sugar, not to become sugar. (All laugh.)\"Do you know how the lover of God feels?\" Ramakrishna continued. \"His attitudeis 'O God, Thou are the Master, and I am Thy servant. Thou are the Mother, and Iam Thy child.' Or again: 'Thou art my Father and Mother. Thou art the Whole, andI am a part.' He doesn't like to say, 'I am Brahman.'\"The yogi seeks to realize the Paramatman, the Supreme Soul. His idea is theunion of the embodied soul and the Supreme Soul. He withdraws his mind fromsense-objects and tries to concentrate it on the Paramatman. Therefore, duringthe first stage of his spiritual discipline, he retires into solitude and withundivided attention practices meditation in a fixed posture.\"But the Reality is one and the same. The difference is only in name. He who isBrahman is verily Atman, and again, He is the Bhagavan, the Blessed Lord. He isBrahman to the followers of the path of knowledge, Paramatman to the yogis, andBhagavan to the lovers of God.\"The jrianis, who adhere to the nondualistic philosophy of Vedanta, say that theacts of creation, preservation, and destruction, the universe itself and all itsliving beings, are the manifestations of Sakti, the Divine Power. If you reasonit out, you will realize that all these are as illusory as a dream. Brahmanalone is the Reality, and all else is unreal. Even this very Sakti isunsubstantial, like a dream.\"But though you reason all your life, unless you are established in samadhi, youcannot go beyond the jurisdiction of Sakti. Even when you say, 'I ammeditating,' or 'I am contemplating,' still you are moving in the realm ofSakti, within Its power.\"Thus Brahman and Sakti are identical. If you accept the one, you must acceptthe other. It is like fire and its power to burn. If you see the fire, you mustrecognize its power to burn also. You cannot think of fire without its power toburn, nor can you think of the power to burn without fire. You cannot conceiveof the sun's rays without the sun, nor can you conceive of the sun without itsrays.\"What is milk like? Oh, you say, it is something white. You cannot think of themilk without the whiteness, and again, you cannot think of the whiteness withoutthe milk.\"Thus one cannot think of Brahman without Sakti, or of Sakti without Brahman.One cannot think of the Absolute without the Relative, or of the Relativewithout the Absolute.\"The Primordial Power is ever at play. She is creating, preserving, anddestroying in play, as it were. This Power is called Kali. Kali is verilyBrahman, and Brahman is verily Kali. It is one and the same Reality. When wethink of It as inactive, that is to say, not engaged in the acts of creation,preservation, and destruction, then we call It Brahman. But when It engages inthese activities, then we call It Kali or Sakti. The Reality is one and thesame; the difference is in name and form.''This introductory exposition of the Tantric point of view was given on the deckof a little excursion-steamer, sailing up and down the Ganges, one beautifulautumn afternoon in 1882. Keshab Chandra Sen (1838-84), the distinguished leaderof the semi-Hindu, semi-Christian Brahmo Samaj, had come with a number of hisfollowing, to visit Sri Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar, a suburb of the modern cityof Calcutta, where the saintly teacher was serving as priest in a templededicated to the Black Goddess, Kali. Keshab was a modern, occiden-talized Hindugentleman, with a cosmopolitan outlook, and a sattvic, humanistic, progressivereligious philosophy—not unlike that of his New England contemporary, theTranscendentalist (and student of the Bhagavad Gita), Ralph Waldo Emerson.Ramakrishna, on the other hand, was a thorough Hindu— intentionally ignorant ofEnglish, nurtured in the traditions of his motherland, long-practiced in thetechniques of introverted contemplation, and filled with the experience of God.The coming together of these two religious leaders was a meeting of the modern,timely India and the timeless—the modern consciousness of India with thehalf-forgotten divine symbols of its own unconscious. Noteworthy, moreover, isthe fact that on this occasion the teacher was not the Western-educated,tailored gentleman, who had been entertained in London by the Queen, but theyogi in his loincloth, speaking of the traditional Indian Gods out of his owndirect experience.Keshab (with a smile): \"Describe to us, sir, in how many ways Kali, the DivineMother, sports in this world.\"Sri Ramakrishna (also with a smile): \"Oh, She plays in different ways. It is Shealone who is known as Maha-Kall [\"The Great Black One\"], Nitya-Kali [\"TheEverlasting Black One\"], Smasana-Kali [\"Kali of the Cremation Ground\"],Raksa-Kali [\"Goblin Kzmali\"], and Syama-Kall [\"Dark Kali\"]. Maha-Kali andNitya-Kali are mentioned in the Tantra Philosophy. When there were neither thecreation, nor the sun, the moon, the planets, and the earth, and when darknesswas enveloped in darkness, then the Mother, the Formless One, Maha-Kali, theGreat Power, was one with Maha-Kala [this is the masculine form of the samename], the Absolute.\"Syama-Kall has a somewhat tender aspect and is worshiped in the Hinduhouseholds. She is the Dispenser of boons and the Dispeller of fear. Peopleworship Raksa-Kali, the Protectress, in times of epidemic, famine, earthquake,drought, and flood. Smasana-Kali is the embodiment of the power of destruction.She resides in the cremation ground, surrounded by corpses, jackals, andterrible female spirits. From Her mouth flows a stream of blood, from Her neckhangs a garland of human heads, and around Her waist is a girdle made of humanhands.\"After the destruction of the universe, at the end of a great cycle, the DivineMother garners the seeds for the next creation. She is like the elderly mistressof the house, who has a hotch-potch-pot in which she keeps different articlesfor the household use. (All laugh.) Oh, yes! Housewives have pots like that,where they keep sea-foam, blue pills, small bundles of seeds of cucumber,pumpkin, and gourd, and so on. They take them out when they want them. In thesame way, after the destruction of the universe, my Divine Mother, theEmbodiment of Brahman, gathers together the seeds for the next creation. Afterthe creation the Primal Power dwells in the universe itself. She brings forththis phenomenal world and then pervades it. In the Vedas creation is likened tothe spider and its web. The spider brings the seb out of itself and then remainsin it. God is the container of the universe and also what is contained in it.\"Is Kali, my Divine Mother, of a black complexion? She appears black because Sheis viewed from a distance; but when intimately known She is no longer so. Thesky appears blue at a distance; but look at air close by and you will find thatit has no color. The water of the ocean looks blue at a distance, but when yougo near and take it in your hand, you find that it is colorless.\"Sri Ramakrishna, filled with love for the Goddess, then sang to her two songs ofthe Bengali devotee and yogi Ramprasad, after which he resumed his talk.\"The Divine Mother is always sportive and playful. This universe is Her play.She is self-willed and must always have her own way. She is full of bliss. Shegives freedom to one out of a hundred thousand.\"A Brahmo Devotee: \"But, sir, if She likes She can give freedom to all. Why,then, has She kept us bound to the world?\"Sri Ramakrishna: \"That is Her will. She wants to continue playing with Hercreated beings. In a game of hide-and-seek the running about soon stops if inthe beginning all the players touch the 'granny.' If all touch her, then how canthe game go on? That displeases her. Her pleasure is in continuing the game.\"It is as if the Divine Mother said to the human mind in confidence, with a signfrom Her eye, 'Go and enjoy the world.' How can one blame the mind? The mind candisentangle itself from worldliness if, through her grace, She makes it turntoward Herself.\"Singing again the songs of Ramprasad, Sri Ramakrishna interrupted his discourse,but then continued. \"Bondage is of the mind, and freedom is also of the mind. Aman is free if he constantly thinks: 1 am a free soul. How can I be bound,whether I live in the world or in the forest? I am a child of God, the King ofKings. Who can bind me?' If bitten by a snake, a man may get rid of its venom bysaying emphatically, 'There is no poison in me.' In the same way, by repeatingwith grit and determination, 1 am not bound, I am free,' one really becomes so—one really becomes free.\"Once someone gave me a book of the Christians. I asked him to read it to me. Ittalked about nothing but sin. (To Keshab Chandra Sen:) Sin is the only thing onehears of at your Brahmo Samaj, too. The wretch who constantly says, 1 am bound,I am bound,' only succeeds in being bound. He who says day and night, 1 am asinner, I am a sinner,' really becomes a sinner.\"One should have such burning faith in God that one can say: 'What? I haverepeated the name of God, and can sin still cling to me? How can I be a sinnerany more? How can I be in bondage any more?'\"If a man repeats the name of God, his body, mind, and everything become pure.Why should one talk about sin and hell, and such things? Say but once, 'O Lord,I have undoubtedly done wicked things, but I won't repeat them.' And have faithin his name.\"Sri Ramakrishna sang:If only I can pass away repeating Durga's name; How canst Thou then, O BlessedOne, Withhold from me deliverance, Wretched though I may be? . . .Then he said: \"To my Divine Mother I prayed only for pure love, I offeredflowers at Her Lotus Feet and prayed to Her: 'Mother, here is Thy virtue, hereis Thy vice. Take them both and grant me only pure love for Thee. Here is Thyknowledge, here is Thy ignorance. Take them both and grant me only pure love forThee. Here is Thy purity, here is Thy impurity. Take them both, Mother, andgrant me only pure love for Thee. Here is Thy dharma, here is Thy adharma. Takethem both, Mother, and grant me only pure love for Thee.\"In Tantra the theistic attitude practically obliterates the abstract ideal ofthe Formless Brahman (nirguna brahman) in favor of Brahman-in-the-Gunas (sagunabrahman) —the Lord (isvara), the personal God; and the latter is represented bythe Tantrics preferably in the female aspect, since in this the nature ofMaya-Sakti is most immediately affirmed. The Tantric development supported thereturn to power in popular Hinduism of the figure of the Mother Goddess of theinnumerable names—Devi, Durga, Kali, Parvatl, Uma, SatI, Padma, Candi,Tripura-sundari, etc.—whose cult, rooted in the Neolithic past, had beenovershadowed for a period of about a thousand years by the male divinities ofthe patriarchal Aryan pantheon. The Goddess began to reassert herself in theperiod of the later Upanisads. She is today the chief divinity again. All theconsorts of the various gods are her manifestations, and, as the sakti or\"power\" of their husbands, represent the energy that has brought the latter intomanifestation. Moreover, as Mahamaya, the Goddess personifies the WorldIllusion, within the bounds and thralldom of which exist all forms whatsoever,whether gross or subtle, earthly or angelic, even those of the highest gods. Sheis the primary embodiment of the transcendent principle, and as such the motherof all names and forms. \"God Himself,\" states Ramakrishna, \"is Mahamaya, whodeludes the world with Her illusion and conjures up the magic of creation,preservation, and destruction. She has spread this veil of ignorance before oureyes. We can go into the inner chamber only when She lets us pass through thedoor.\" It is entirely possible that in this reinstatement of the Goddess, bothin the popular cults and in the deep philosophy of the Tantra, we have anothersign of the resurgence of the religiosity of the non-Aryan, pre-Aryan,matriarchal tradition of Dravidian times.NOTE1 Brahman as Being (sat), Consciousness (cit), and Bliss (ananda).Yoga: Immortality and FreedomMIRCEA ELIADEMircea Eliade had a distinguished career as professor at the Divinity School ofthe University of Chicago and has been highly regarded as one of the foremostinterpreters of religion in the modern period. His formative work in the fieldwas done in India, where he went as a young man to study in Calcutta. In thefollowing selection, a direct result of that early period of field study inIndia, Eliade clearly presents the theory of the Chakras and their relation tothe concept ofKundalini, central to Tantric practices. Eliade s work, based onthorough scientific principles, is an exposition of the reality of the classicaltheory of Tantra and Kundalini, rather than a new interpretation of it such ascan be found in the earlier selection by Chaudhuri.THE CAKRASAccording to Hindu tradition, there are seven important cakras, which someauthorities refer to the six plexuses and the sutura frontalis.1. The muladhara (mula = root) is situated at the base of the spinal column,between the anal orifice and the genital organs (sacrococcygeal plexus). It hasthe form of a red lotus with four petals, on which are inscribed in gold theletters v, s, s, and s. In the middle of the lotus is a yellow square, emblem ofthe element earth (prthivi); at the center of the square is a triangle with itsapex downward, symbol of the yoni, and called Kamarupa; at the center of thetriangle is the svayambhu-linga (the linga existing by itself), its head asbrilliant as a jewel. Coiled eight times (like a serpent) around it, asbrilliant as lightning, sleeps Kundalini, blocking the opening of the linga withher mouth (or her head). In this way Kundalini obstructs the brahmadvara (the\"door of Brahman\") and access to the susumna. The muladhara cakra is related tothe cohesive power of matter, to inertia, the birth of sound, the sense ofsmell, the apana breath, the gods Indra, Brahma, Dakini, Sakti, etc.2. The svadhisthana cakra, also called jalamandala (because its tattva is jala =water) and medhradhara (medhra = penis), is situated at the base of the malegenital organ (sacral plexus). Lotus with six vermilion petals inscribed withthe letters, b, bh, m, r, I. In the middle of the lotus, a white half-moon,mystically related to Varuna. In the middle of the moon, a bija-mantra, at thecenter of which is Visnu flanked by the goddess Cakini. The svadhisthana cakrais related to the element water, the color white, the prqna breath, the sense oftaste, the hand, etc.3. The manipura (mani = jewels; pura = city) or nabhisthana (nabhi = umbilicus),situated in the lumbar region at the level of the navel (epigastric plexus).Blue lotus with ten petals and the letters d, dh, n, t, th, d, dh, n, p.ph. In the middle of the lotus, a red triangle and on the triangle the godMaharudra, seated on a bull, with Lakini Sakti (blue in color) beside him. Thiscakra is related to the element fire, the sun, rajas (menstrual fluid), thesamana breath, the sense of sight, etc.4. The anahata (anahahata sahd is the sound produced without contact between twoobjects; i.e., a mystical sound); region of the heart, seat of the prana and ofthe jlvatman. Color, red. Lotus with twelve golden petals (letters k, kh, g, gh,etc.). In the middle, two interlaced triangles forming a Solomon's seal, in thecenter of which is another golden triangle enclosing a shining linga. Above thetwo triangles is Isvara with the KakinI Sakti (red in color). The anahata cakrais related to the element air, the sense of touch, the phallus, the motor force,the blood system, etc.5. The visuddha cakra (the cakra of purity); region of the throat (laryngeal andpharyngeal plexus, at the junction of the spinal column and the medullaoblongata), seat of the udana breath and of the hindu. Lotus with sixteen petalsof smoky purple (letters a, a, i, u, u, etc.). Within the lotus a blue area, inthe center of which is a white circle containing an elephant. On the elephantrests the blja-mantra h (Hang), supporting Sadasiva, half silver, half golden,for the god is represented under his androgynous aspect (ardhanarisvara). Seatedon a bull, he holds in his many hands a multitude of objects and emblems properto him (vajra, trident, bell, etc.). One half of his body constitutes the SadaGauri, with ten arms and five faces (with three eyes each). The visuddha cakrais related to the color white, the ether (akasa), sound, the skin, etc.6. The ajna ( = order, command) cakra, situated between the eyebrows (cavernousplexus). White lotus with two petals bearing the letters h and ks. Seat of thecognitive faculties: buddhi, ahamkara, manas, and the indryas ( = the senses) intheir \"subtle\" modality. In the lotus is a white triangle, apex downward (symbolof the yoni); in the middle of the triangle a white linga, called itara (the\"other\"). Here is the seat of Paramasiva. The bija-mantra is OM. The tutelarygoddess is HakinT; she has six faces and six arms and is seated on a whitelotus.7. The sahasrara cakra: at the top of the head, represented under the form of athousand-petaled lotus (sahasrd = thousand), head down. Also calledbrahmasthana, brahmarandhra, nirvana cakra, etc. The petals bear all thepossible articulations of the Sanskrit alphabet, which has fifty letters (50 X20). In the middle of the lotus is the full moon, enclosing a triangle. It ishere that the final union (unmani) of Siva and Sakti, the final goal of tantricsadhana, is realized, and here the kundalinl ends its journey after traversingthe six cakras. We should note that the sahasrara no longer belongs to the planeof the body, that it already designates the plane of transcendence—that thisexplains why writers usually speak of the doctrine of the \"six\" cakras.There are other cakras, of less importance. Thus, between the muladhara and thesvadhisthana is the yonisthdna; this is the meeting place of Siva and Sakti, aplace of bliss, also called (like the muladhara) kamarupa. It is the source ofdesire and, on the carnal level, an anticipation of the union Siva-Sakti, whichisaccomplished in the sahasrdra. Near the ajna cakra are the manas cakra and thesoma cakra, related to the intellective functions and to certain yogicexperiences. Near the ajna cakra again is the kdrana-rupa, seat of the seven\"causal forms,\" which are held to produce and constitute the \"subtle\" and the\"physical\" bodies. Finally, other texts refer to a number oiadhdras ( =supports, receptacles), situated between the cakras or identified with them.The Buddhist tantras speak of only four cakras, situated respectively in theumbilical, cardiac, and laryngeal regions and the cerebral plexus; this lastcakra, the most important, is called usnlsa-kamala (lotus of the head) andcorresponds to the sahasrdra of the Hindus. The three lower cakras are the sitesof the three kdyas (bodies): nirmdna-kdya in the umbilical cakra, dharma-kdya inthe cakra of the heart, sambhoga-kdya in the cakra of the throat. But there areanomalies and contradictions in regard to the number and locations of thesecakras. As in the Hindu traditions, the cakras are associated with mudrds andgoddesses: Locana, Mamaki, Pandara, and Tara. In connection with the fourcakras, the Hevajra-tantra gives a long list of quaternities: four tattvas, fourangas, four moments, four noble truths (drya-sattva), etc.Viewed in projection, the cakras constitute a mandala whose center is marked bythe brdhmarandhra. It is in this \"center\" that the rupture of plane occurs, thatthe paradoxical act of transcendence—passing beyond samsdra, \"emerging fromtime\"—is accomplished. The symbolism of the mandala is also a constituentelement of Indian temples and sacred edifices in general: viewed in projection,a temple is a mandala. We may, then, say that any ritual ambulation isequivalent to an approach to the center and that entrance into a temple repeatsthe initiatory entrance into a mandala or the passage of the kundalinl throughthe cakras. Then again, the body is transformed both into a microcosm (withMount Meru as center) and into a pantheon, each region and each \"subtle\" organhaving its tutelary divinity, its mantra, its mystical letter, etc. Not onlydoes the disciple identify himself with the cosmos; he also rediscovers thegenesis and destruction of the universe in his own body. As we shall see,tantric sddhana comprises two stages: (1) cosmicization of the human being and(2) transcendence of the cosmos—that is, its destruction through the unificationof opposites (\"sun\"— \"moon,\" etc.). The pre-eminent sign of this transcendenceis found in the final act of the kundalims ascent—its union with Siva, at thesummit of the skull, in the sahasrdra.KUNDALINISome aspects of the kundalinl have already been mentioned; it is described atonce under the form of a snake, of a goddess, and of an \"energy.\" TheHatha-yogapradlpikd (III, 9) presents it in the following terms: \"Kutilangi('crooked bodied'), Kundalinl, BhujangI (a she-serpent'), Sakti, Isvari,Kundall, ArundhatT— all these words are synonymous. As a door is opened with akey, so the Yog! opens the door of mukti (deliverance) by opening Kundalinl bymeans of Hatha Yoga.\" When the sleeping goddess is awakened through the grace ofthe guru, all the cakras are quickly traversed. Identified with Sabdabrahman,with OM,Kundalinl possesses all the attributes of all gods and all goddesses. Under theform of a snake, it dwells in the midpoint of the body (dehamadhyayd) of allcreatures. Under the form of Parasakti, kundalinl manifests itself at the baseof the trunk (ddhdra); under the form of Paradevata, it dwells in the middle ofthe knot at the center of the ddhdra, whence the nddls issue. Kundalinl moves inthe susumnd by the force aroused in the inner sense (nianas) by the prdna, is\"drawn upward through the susumnd as a needle draws a thread.\" Kundalinl isawakened by asanas and kumbhakas; \"then the Prana becomes absorbed in Sunya\"(the Void).The awakening of the kundalinl arouses an intense heat, and its progress throughthe cakras is manifested by the lower part of the body becoming as inert andcold as a corpse, while the part through which the kundalinl passes is burninghot. The Buddhist tantras even more strongly emphasize the fiery nature of thekundalinl. According to the Buddhists, the Sakti (also called Candali, Dombi,Yogini, Nairamani, etc.) lies sleeping in the ninndna-kaya (umbilical region);the adept wakes her by producing the bodhicitta in that region, and herawakening is revealed by the sensation of a \"great fire.\" The Hevajra-t antrasays that \"the Candali burns in the navel,\" and that when everything is burned,the moon (situated in the forehead) lets fall drops of nectar. A poem ofGunjaripada's presents the phenomenon in veiled terms: \"The lotus and thethunder meet together in the middle and through their union Candali is ablaze;that blazing fire is in contact with the house of the Dombi—I take the moon andpour water. Neither scorching heat nor smoke is found, but it enters the skythrough the peak of Mount Meru.\" We shall return to the signification of thissymbolic vocabulary. But let us now note the following fact: according to theBuddhists, the secret force lies asleep in the umbilical region; through yogicpractice, it is kindled and, like a fire, reaches the two higher cakras (dharmaand sambhoga), enters them, reaches the usnlsa-kamala (corresponding to thesahasrdra of the Hindus), and, having \"burned\" everything in its path, returnsto the ninndna-kaya. Other texts explain that this heat is obtained by the\"transmutation\" of sexual energy.The relations between the kundalinl (or the Candali) and fire, the production ofinner fire by the ascent of the kundalinl through the cakras, are factsrequiring emphasis at this point. The reader will remember that, according tosome myths, the goddess Sakti was created by the fiery energies of all the gods.Then, too, it is well known that the production of \"inner heat\" is a very old\"magical\" technique, which reached its fullest development in shamanism. We maynote here and now that tantrism adheres to this universal magical tradition,although the spiritual content of its principal experience—the \"fire\" kindled bythe ascent of the kundalinl —is on quite another plane than that of magic orshamanism. In any case, we shall have occasion, again in connection with theproduction of \"inner heat,\" to examine the symbiosis tantrism-shamanism attestedin certain Himalayan practices.It is impossible to set about waking the kundalinl without the spiritualpreparation implied by all the disciplines we have just discussed. But itsactual awakening and its journey through the cakras are brought about by atechnique whose essential element is arresting respiration (kumbhaka) by aspecial bodilyposition (dsana, mudra). One of the most frequently used methods of arrestingthe breath is that prescribed by the khecarimudrd: obstructing the cavum byturning the tongue back and inserting the tip of it into the throat. l Theabundant salival secretion thus produced is interpreted as celestial ambrosia(amrta) and the flesh of the tongue itself as the \"flesh of the cow\" that theyogin \"eats.\" This symbolical interpretation of a \"physiological situation\" isnot without interest; it is an attempt to express the fact that the yoginalready participates in \"transcendence\": he transgresses the strictest of Hinduprohibitions (eating cow flesh)— that is, he is no longer conditioned, is nolonger in the world; hence he tastes the celestial ambrosia.This is but one aspect of the khecarimudrd; we shall see that the obstruction ofthe cavum by the tongue and the arrest of breathing that follows are accompaniedby a sexual practice. Before presenting it, we shall add that the awakening ofthe kundalinl brought about in this way is only the beginning of the exercise;the yogin further endeavors both to keep the kundalinl in the median \"duct\"(susumnd) and to make it rise through the cakras to the top of the head. Now,according to the tantric authors themselves, this effort is rarely successful.We quote the following enigmatic passage from the Tdrdkhanda (it also occurs inthe Tantrasdra): \"Drinking, drinking, again drinking, drinking fall down uponearth; and getting up and again drinking, there is no re-birth.\" This is anexperience realized during total arrest of respiration. The commentaryinterprets: \"During the first stage of Shatchakra Sadhana [ = penetration of thecakras], the Sadhaka [disciple] cannot supress his breath for a sufficientlylong time at a stretch to enable him to practice concentration and meditation ineach centre of Power [cakra]. He cannot therefore, detain Kundalini within theSushumna longer than his power of Kumbhaka [arresting respiration] permits. Hemust, consequently, come down upon earth—that is the Muladhara Chakra—which isthe center of the element, earth, after having drunk of the heavenly ambrosia[which can be understood in various ways, and especially as the copioussalivation provoked by obstruction of the cavum]. The Sadhaka must practice thisagain and again, and by constant practice the cause of re-birth ... is removed.\"To hasten the ascent of the kundalini, some tantric schools combined corporalpositions (mudra) with sexual practices. The underlying idea was the necessityof achieving simultaneous \"immobility\" of breath, thought, and semen. TheGoraksa Samhitd (61-71) states that during the khecarimudrd the bindu ( = sperm)\"does not fall\" even if one is embraced by a woman. And, \"while the binduremains in the body, there is no fear of Death. Even if the bindu has reachedthe fire (is ejaculated) it straightway returns, arrested ... by the yonimudrd.\"The Hathayogapradlpikd (III, 82) recommends the vajrollmudrd for the samepurpose. Milk and an \"obedient woman\" are required. The yogin \"should draw backup again with the medhra (the bindu discharged in mai-thuna)\" and the same actof reabsorption must also be performed by the woman. \"Having drawn up his owndischarged bindu [the Yogi] can preserve (it). ... By the loss of bindu (comes)death, from its retention, life.\" All these texts insist upon theinterdependence between the breath, psychomental experience, and the semenvirile. \"So long as the air (breath) moves, bindu moves; (and) it be-comes stationary (when the air) ceases to move. The Yogi should, therefore,control the air and obtain immovability. As long as prdna remains in the body,life (jlva) does not depart.\"We see, then, that the bindu is dependent upon the breath and is in some sorthomologized to it; for the departure of the one as of the other is equivalent todeath. The bindu is also homologized to the citta, and thus there is finallyhomology of the three planes on which either \"movement\" or \"immobility\" areexercised: prdna, bindu, citta. As the kundalini is weakened by a violentstoppage— whether of respiration or of seminal emission—it is important to knowthe structure and ramifications of the homology among the three planes. The moreso as the texts do not always make it clear to which plane of reference theyapply.NOTESl To succeed, the frenum of the tongue must be cut beforehand._ Buddhist Texts Through the AgesEDWARD CONZEEdward Conze was the foremost interpreter of Buddhism to the West in the postWorld War II period. Among his many publications, this volume of excerpts fromBuddhist texts is one of the most useful short introductions to the primarysources of the Buddhist tradition. The examples ofTantric texts that followintroduce the reader to the theological aspects ofTantra and its practice inKundalini Yoga, as well as to theories of the mandala and the use of mantra inmeditation. In these theologies and practices, the physical body itself becomes\"divinized\" through the \"magical\" means of the meditation technique. These arestriking features ofTantra theory and practice that distinguish it from the yogapractices of other Hindu and Buddhist traditions.THE ATTAINMENT OF THE REALIZATION OF WISDOM AND MEANS by AnangavajraSalutation to Vajrasattva!.Having made salutation again and again to him who consists of Wisdom and Means,of him I now speak, in whom there arises the threefold body of Buddhahood: thematchless Dharma-Body, pure in essence and untrammelled by the whole veil ofunreal phenomena, the Sambhoga-Body which is the basis for the spreading of theGood Law, the Nirmana-Body which is effected in diverse forms. Of him IAnangavajra shall now briefly speak for the benefit of all beings who areignorant of his true nature.The wise explain phenomenal existence, that deluder of simple minds, as theresult of a false construction, the essence of which is the notion of existence.Thence there arises continually and under varying forms a whole mass ofdefilements, so hard to bear, and a vast accumulation of karma. For those whoseminds thus cling to falsehood these two produce perpetual suffering of diversekinds, of which the chief are death and birth. So long as the notion ofexistence remains the fixation of men who tarry in the prison of phenomenallife, what good can they do themselves or others in such deprivation of wisdom?And so the wise who desire to bring jcy to the triple world and remove their ownmental confusion must abandon altogether the fixation of this notion ofexistence. But having abandoned the fixation of existence, the wise man shouldnot conceive a state of non-existence, for if indeed he should discriminatebetween these two, his conceits are not destroyed. Far preferable is aconception of existence, but never the conceit of non-existence; a burning lampmay be extinguished, but if it is already extinguished, then what course shouldone pursue? So long as one conceives of existence, one remains aware ofexistence (and there is always the possibility of realizing its true nature),but there can be no realization of the end of space which has here no beginning,and nothing can be realized as mere nonexistence, for it would be deprived ofall means. It would be useless to oneself"},{"pageContent":"and others, for it would be as non-existent as flowers that grow in the sky.Thus those who desire the fruit of Buddhahood should renounce the notion ofexistence because it is deluding like a magical display, but they should alsorenounce the notion of non-existence, for it is non-existent. O Wise Ones, do yenow hearken, for in so far as one renounces both extremes, the state in whichone abides is neither Samsara nor Nirvana, for one has renounced these two.The non-substantiality of things which is realized by reflection and bydiscriminating between the act of knowing and what is known, is called theessence of Wisdom.Because one is passionately devoted to all beings who have failed to extricatethemselves from a whole flood of suffering, this passionate devotion of whichtheir suffering is the cause is known as Compassion. In that one thereby bringsa man to the desired end by a combination of appropriate measures; it is alsocalled the Means.The mingling of both, which is like that of water and milk, is known asWisdom-Means in a union free of duality. It is the essence of Dharma, to whichnothing may be added and from which nothing may be withdrawn. It is free fromthe two notions of subject and object, free from being and non-being, fromcharacterizing and characteristics; it is pure and immaculate in its own nature.Neither duality nor non-duality, calm and tranquil it consists in all things,motionless and unflurried; such is Wisdom-Means which may be known intuitively.It is this that is called the supreme and wondrous abode of all Buddhas, theDharma-sphere, the divine cause of the perfection of bliss. It is NirvanaIndeterminate (apratisthitanirvana) and is frequented by the Buddhas of thePast, Present and Future; it is the blissful stage of self-consecration(svadhisthana), the beatitute of the Perfection of Wisdom. The threeBuddha-bodies, the three Buddhist vehicles, mantras in their innumerablethousands, mudras and mandala-circles, phenomenal existence and that whichtranscends it, all arise from the same source; gods and asuras and men,disembodied spirits and whatever else exists, all spring from her and returnhere to their cessation. It abides always in all things like a wish-grantinggem; it is the final stage of Enjoyment and Release. It is here that the BlessedOnes met in times past and so became Buddhas, and it is here that those intenton the good of the world become Buddhas now and will always do so in future. Itis called the Great Bliss, for it consists of bliss unending; it is the SupremeOne, the Universal Good, the producer of Perfect Enlightenment. The great sagesdefine this truth, which is the supreme bliss of self and others, as the unionof limitless Compassion which is intent alone on the destruction of all theworld's suffering, and of perfect Wisdom which is free from all attachment andis an accumulation of knowledge which may not be reckoned, so great is itsdiversity.IIAnd now in order that the jewel of this truth may be obtained, I Ananga-vajra,my mind penetrated with compassion, will discourse a little concerning theMeans, but briefly, for it is just as has been taught by the Buddhas of old. Itshould benefit all those who are bewildered by the delusion of phenomenalexistence which is so hard to destroy. But even Buddhas may not speak on thismatter, saying that this is thus, for since it must be realized intuitively, itcannot be contained in words. And so it has been revealed as a process by meansof the practices of many sutras and mantras by those Buddhas of the Past,Present and Future who have brought joy to the world. But this process itselfcan in no wise express the actual knowledge of tradition and so on, and sincethere is no connection between the sound and the true meaning, it merely showsthe characteristics of a particular treatise. So a wise man must resort to agood master, for without him the truth cannot be found even in millions of ages.And if truth is not found, the final goal can never be reached, just as withouta seed a plant will not grow even in the best and clearest of fields. So when inthe course of life one comes upon masters with this truth, those who areteachers of Wisdom-Means, firm in line of succession, wondrous as awish-granting gem and established in the path that is free from querulousthought, one should honour them to the best of one's ability if final perfectionof the self is really one's aim. It is by means of their splendour that thebliss of infinite enlightenment is gained which is the highest goal possible forall beings in this triple world of moving and motionless things. So good men whodesire their own perfection always pay with their whole being full honour totheir master, who is the bestower of infinite rewards. They abandon envy andmalignancy, and pride and self-conceit, their determination set on enlightenmentand the concept of weariness renounced, and thus they always honour their guru,master of the world, who bestows sucess in all things. They are zealous inconduct and unwavering in mind and without thought for their own affairs theybow with head to his feet three times with great devotion. Thereby they gain bythe grace of their guru and without any obstruction that truth supreme which istaught by all the Buddhas. It is eternal, resplendent and pure, the abode of theconquerors, the divine substance in all things and the source of all things.Just as a sun-stone shines brightly from the proximity of the sun-light whichdispels the enclosing darkness, even so does the jewel of a pupil's mind, freedfrom the murkiness of impurity, light up from the proximity of a world-teacherwho is bright with the fire of the practice of truth. As soon as he becomes thusenlightened, ablaze with the jewel of truth, this happy pupil is quicklyapproached by the Buddhas of the ten directions whose thoughts are pervaded withcompassion, and by them he is firmly consecrated as a perfect Buddha. From theconsecration of these Buddhas he becomes himself the equal of all Buddhas.Thus those who abandon the cloak of pride and envy and deceit, and firm in theirresolve serve with unequalled faith their master who embodies the traditionalsuccession, they certainly shall gain the jewel of truth, which is the abode ofall Buddha-qualities, for they have won supreme enlightenment which is thepossession of all the Blessed Ones.IllNow the rite of consecration, the basis of the triple world, shall be expoundedfor the benefit of all practisers who aim to reach the stage of Vajrasattva.When a wise man is consecrated in the tradition of the way of mantras, all Bud-dhas become manifest to him in the mandala which is their abode. So thethoughtful man who fears the loss of this sacramental experience does not let goof the Lord of the realms of endless worlds, when once he has attained theprocess of self-consecration. By perfected Buddhas it is taught that in themantra-way there exists in its absolute aspect that sacramental experience ofVajrasattva and the other divine beings which is so hard to withstand. And so ason of the Conquerors for the sake of this consecration strives with all hismight, and with the observation of all due ceremony approaches his vajraguru,that ocean of all good qualities. Having found a yogini with wondrous eyes andendowed with youth and beauty, he should deck her with fair raiment, andgarlands and the scent of sandal-wood, and commit her to his master, andtogether with her he should honour and praise him with all his might, usingscents and garlands and milk and other kinds of offerings. Then placing in allfaith his knees upon the ground, he should beseech his master with this hymn ofpraise, stretching forth his hands in supplication:\"Hail to thee, womb of the Void, who art free of all conceits, omniscient one,thou mass of knowledge, knowledge personified, all hail to thee!\"Thou, teacher of the pure essence of truth which makes an end of worldlyknowledge, O Vajrasattva, born of the nonsubstantiality of all things, hail tothee!\"From you, O Lord, there ever rise into existence Buddhas and Bodhisatt-vas, whopossess as their good qualities the great perfections, O Thought ofEnlightenment, hail to thee!\"From you, O Lord of the world, come the Three Jewels and the Great Way and thewhole triple world with its moving and motionless things. All hail to thee!\"Thou art wondrous as a wish-granting gem for producing the welfare of theworld; O Buddha-Son, most blessed, who dost command all the blessed ones, allhail to thee!\"It is by your grace, O ocean of good qualities, that I have known the truth,and now, O Omniscient One, may thou favour me with the vajra-consecration.\"Do thou favour me with the secret of all Buddhas, even as it has been taught bythe Supreme Vajra of Thought, embodiment of the Vajra of the Dharma.\"If once I leave your lotus-feet, I have no other way to go. Therefore do thou,Lord, conqueror of the foe which is samsara, have compassion.\"Then the worthy vajra-guru, filled with sympathy and intent on good, makesmanifest his compassion and calls the pupil into the mandala. It is strewn withthe five kinds of delectable things resplendent with a canopy spread above; itresounds with bells and cymbals, and is pleasant with flowers and incense andgarlands and heavenly perfumes; it is the most wondrous resort of Vajrasattvaand other divine beings and is prepared for union with the yogini. Then joiningwith the yogini the most worthy master places the Thought of Enlightenment inthe lotus-vessel, which is the abode of the Buddhas. Next he consecrates thepupil, now joined with the yogini, with chowries and umbrellas held high andwith propitious songs and verses. Having thus bestowed upon him theconsecration, that excellent gem, he should give him the fivefold sacrament,delightful, divine, essentially pure. It consists of the precious jewel, withcamphor, redsandal-wood and vajra-water, and as fifth component the empowering mantra. \"Thisis your sacrament, Beloved, prescribed by former Buddhas. Do thou protect italways, and hearken now to the vow you must keep. Never must you take life, andnever abandon the Three Jewels, and never abandon your master. This is the vowyou transgress at your peril.\"Then he should give leave of departure to that pupil, who having been thusconsecrated with the Thought of Enlightenment, has become freed from his evilways and is now the foremost son of the Buddhas. \"O best of beings, until youenter final enlightenment, cause the excellent wheel of the Law to revolveeverywhere throughout all the quarters. He who is the essence of Wisdom-Means issaid to be like a wish-granting gem, for he is free of suffering and free ofattachment, so serve now the cause of living beings!\"Having thus received the consecration and his leave to depart, joyful andcontent, he should pronounce pleasant words, which cause joy to the world.\"Today my birth has proved fruitful, and fruitful is now my life. Today I amborn in the Buddha-family, and I am now a son of the Buddhas. Thou, O Lord, hastrescued me from the ocean of ages, vast in its terror, and disturbed with thewaves which are our births, from the mud of molestations, which is so hard tocross. I know that it is by your grace that I have emerged; I know that I amfree from desire, and that all past influences are cast away.\" Then falling withdevotion at his master's feet, his eyes wide-open with joy, he adds: \"And maythou please inform me whatever thing thou desirest most.\" Then spontaneously hiscompassionate master should accept the offer, for it will tend to thedestruction of the pupil's acquisitiveness and will be for his good. Thus thepupil, having gained the prize he sought, should present his gift with praiseand worship, and once again should supplicate his master: \"Now upon me hasdescended your favour, O foremost of Buddhas, and by this favour of yours Iachieve the highest enlightenment, such as is your possession. And having gainedhighest Buddha-hood, that stage which is praised by all pre-eminent ones, thereI shall establish all beings who wander in the triple world.\"Having understood in one's heart a pupil's aspiration, one should grant himconsecration in conformity with the methods prescribed, and then in one's owndevotion to a discipline so vast and profound, one should give him, alsoverbally, the jewel of consecration. And he, now a true yogin, who has receivedthe great consecration of the Thought of Enlightenment, which is the matchlessenjoyment of perfection of the Bearer of the Vajra, the acquisition of Lakshmi,having received his leave of departure and with his mind set on gaining victoryover that evil foe which is the triple world, should raise his thought toenlightenment and pursue the great and immaculate way.Note on the MandalaThe Mandala is a circle of symbolic forms, which is either just mentallyproduced for special purposes of meditation, or actually marked out on theground for the purpose of special ritual. Its function is always the same,namely as a means towards the reintegration of the practitioner.EastNorthSouthWestThe Five Buddhas and the Four Goddesses and some of the Elements of the Universethey symbolizeThere is a vast variety of different sets of symbolic forms, but they all followthe same fundamental pattern: that is to say, one symbol at the centre, whichrepresents absolute truth itself, and other symbols arranged at the variouspoints of the compass, which represent manifested aspects of this same truth.The simplest set of such symbolic forms consists of the group of the FiveBuddhas or Tathagatas, who in the extract that now follows are conceived of asemanating from their respective seed-syllables (for they are each associatedwith a particular sound, the correct intoning of which will conjure them forth),and taking up their positions to the centre, east, south, north and west. Itwill also be seen that they are each associated with one of the five skandhas,with one of the five fundamental evils (wrath, passion, envy, malignity anddelusion), with one of the five Wisdoms, with a particular taste, with aparticular season, with a particular time of the day and with a particularsubstance used for sacramental purposes.They serve therefore as symbols not only of the final perfection that is thegoal of the aspirant, but also as symbols of those very evils which bind him toexistence and also of his own fivefold personality and of the fivefold sacramentemployed in the rite. The set of five symbolizes then both the condition ofnirvana and the condition of samsara, as well as the means towards therealization of their essential identity, which is the aim of all this endeavour.The condition of perfect identity is represented by a sixth Buddha, Yajrasattva,who here appears in the head-dress of Akshobhya, the central Buddha.These six Buddhas are associated with the various watches of the day and thedifferent seasons, for they comprehend not only all space, but also all time.At the intermediate points of the compass are manifested four goddesses, whorepresent the four material elements, earth, fire, water and air, the basicconstituents of material things. This set is completed with a fifth goddess atthe centre, who represents space, but is also identical in essence withYajrasattva, for at the centre, which is the absolute, the Perfection of Wisdomitself, no distinctions can be made whatsoever.It will be noted that she is identified with the Sanskrit vowel-series, whilethe Buddhas between them make up the whole Sanskrit consonantal series. Themandala therefore symbolizes all sound in addition to all the things alreadymentioned above, for the right employment of intoned sound has now become a veryimportant part of Buddhist practice at this stage.This short note should serve as a sufficient guide to the extract that follows.THE FIVEFOLD MANIFESTATIONHaving made obeisance to Yajrasattva, unevolved and supreme, I shall expound inbrief for the welfare of my pupils the fivefold manifestation.With the mantra: OM AH HUM one ensures protection for the site, for oneself andtor the performance. Then upon this site which has been prepared with perfumesand so on one should worship the Five Buddhas and the Five Yoginis in the centreof the four-sided mandala.There in the centre one envisages the syllable PAM of many colours. This turnsinto a fair eight-petalled lotus of many colours with the red syllable RAM atits centre. This becomes a solar disk, upon which is a dark-blue HUM whencearises Akshobhya with one face and two arms, in the crossed-legged-posture andmaking the \"earth-touching\" gesture. His body exhibits the 32 major and the 80minor marks of perfection, for it is the repository of the whole host ofexcellent qualities, the ten powers, fearlessness and the rest. It is withoutapertures, flesh or bone, for it is neither true nor false like pure lightreflected in a mirror. He is black in colour because he is permeated with greatcompassion and his symbol is a black vajra which embodies the five constituentsof the pure absolute. He has no hair on head or body and he is clad in religiousgarb. His head is marked with Vajrasattva, for he is himself the essence ofVajrasattva, where there is no distinction between Void and Compassion. He alsoembodies cause and effect, of which the characteristic is the Void in that itcomprehends all possible forms. He is the Dharma-Body because he is theembodiment of the Buddhas who are unconditioned; he is the Sambhoga-Body becausehe is a pure reflection; he is the Nirmana-Body because he represents the truenature of constructive consciousness; he is the Self-Existing Body (svabhavika)because this is the single flavour of those three bodies. So it is said:\"Dharma is mind unconditioned; Sambhoga is characterized by reciprocalenjoyment; Nirmana is that which is variously created; Svabhavika is that whichis innate in everything.\"As he is undefiled by discriminating thought and so on, he is of theVajra-family, and the Vajra-family is undefiled by worldlings. His external andinternal bases of symbolization are: wrath, vajra-water, midday, pungency,revealed knowledge, space, sound, the CA-series of consonants. His mantra is: OMAH VAJRADHRKHUM.Vajrasattva, born of the syllable HUM, is pure white with two arms and one face;he holds a vajra and a bell. He is the true nature of mind. He representsastringency, Autumn, the consonantal series YA RA LA VA and the second half ofthe night up to dawn. He is another name of the absolute.Then on the eastern petal on a lunar disk appears Vairocana, born of thesyllable OM; he is white in colour with a white disk as his symbol and makes thegesture indicating enlightenment. He embodies the skandha of form and the natureof delusion; he is symbolized by dung; he is of the Tathagata-family; heconsists in the Mirror-like Knowledge, he represents Winter, sweetness, theKA-series of consonants and the morning watch. His mantra is: OM AH JINAJIK HUM.Then on the southern petal on a solar disk appears Ratnasambhava, born of thesyllable TR\\M. yellow in colour with a gem as his symbol and making the gestureof giving. He embodies the skandha of feeling and the nature of malignity(paisunya); he is symbolized by blood; he is of the Gem-family; he consists inthe Knowledge of Sameness; he represents Spring, saltiness, the TA-series ofconsonants and the third watch. His mantra is: OM AH RATNADHRK HUM.292 Edward ConzeThen on the western petal on a solar disk appears Amitabha, born of the syllableHRIH, red in colour with a lotus as his symbol and in the pose of contemplation.He embodies the skandha of perception and the nature of passion; he issymbolized by seed; he is of the Lotus-family; he consists in PerceptualKnowledge; he represents Summer, bitterness, the TA-series of consonants and theevening watch. His mantra is: OM AH AROLIK HUM.Then on the northern petal on a solar disk appears Amoghasiddhi, born of thesyllable KHAM, dark-green in colour with a crossed vajra as his symbol andmaking the gesture of protection. He embodies the skandha of impulses and thenature of envy (irsya); he is symbolized by flesh; he is of the Karma-family; heconsists in the Knowledge of Needful Activity; he represents the season of therains, the hot taste, the PA-series of consonants and the first watch of thenight. His mantra is: OM AH PRAJNADHRK HUM. These are all seated in thecross-legged posture with two arms and one face, wearing the Ushuisha but withno hair on head or body; they are clad in religious garb and exhibit the 32major and 80 minor marks of physical perfection, for they are repositories ofthe whole host of excellent qualities, the ten powers, fearlessness and therest. Theirs are Sambhoga-Bodies, free of apertures, flesh and bones, pure lightand naught else, like reflections in a mirror and free from such concepts astruth and falsehood. But these four, Vairocana, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha andAmoghasiddhi, who embody the constituents of Form, Feeling, Perception andImpulses, possess indistinguishably the Dharma-Body which is the unconditionedessence of Buddhas, and the Body of Constructive Consciousness, for they allcomprise the Self-Existing Body which is the single flavour of the other threebodies. Thus in order to show that they are all mere consciousness they aresigned on the head with the sign of Akshobhya, and in order to show thatconsciousness, which is non-substantial, is the essence of Void and Compassion,Akshobhya is signed with Vajrasattva. Thereby it is asserted that the worldconsists of cause and effect, which is just the single flavour of Samsara andNirvana. So it is said:\"When thought is realized as Void and Compassion indistinguishable, that indeedis the teaching of the Buddha, of the Law, of the Assembly. As sweetness is thenature of sugar and heat of fire, so voidness is the nature of all elements.\"And so it is said: \"Thorough knowledge of Samsara is Nirvana.\"On the south-eastern petal on a lunar disk appears Locana, born of a whitesyllable LOM, white in colour and with a disk as her symbol. She represents theelement earth, belongs to the Tathagata-family and is affected by delusion. Hermantra is: OM AH LOM HUM SVAHA.To the south-west on a lunar disk appears Mamaki, born of a black syllable MAM,black in colour and with a black vajra as her symbol. She represents the elementwater, belongs to the Vajra-family and is affected by wrath. Her mantra is: OMAH MAM HUM SVAHA.To the north-west on a lunar disk appears Panduravasini, born of the syllablePAM, red in colour and with a lotus as her symbol. She represents the elementfire, belongs to the Lotus-family and is affected by passion. Her mantra is: OMAH PAM HUM SVAHA.To the north-east on a lunar disk appears Tarini, born of the syllable TAM whichis gold and dark-green in colour, herself dark-green and with a dark-coloured lotus as her symbol. She represents the element air, belongs to theKarma-family and is affected by Envy.These four are sixteen years old, endowed with uncommon loveliness and youth asthough they were beauty herself. Like the Buddhas they are possessed of theessence of the four Buddha-bodies; they are ravishing to the mind, therepository of the qualities of all the Buddhas and of the very nature of theFive Tathagatas.In their midst is Nayika, the essence of ALI (the vowel series); she possessesthe true nature of Vajrasattva and is Queen of the Vajra-realm. She is known asthe Lady, as Suchness, as Void, as Perfection of Wisdom, as Limit of Reality, asAbsence of Self.Unit IXThe Descent to Heaven: The Tibetan Book of the DeadBirth, Marriage, Sickness, and DeathGIUSEPPE TUCCIGiuseppe Tucci is one of the leading Tibetologists of our period. He was anexpert in Tibetan language and explaining special characteristics of Tibetanreligion, such as the Mandala which he interpreted in the Indian context aswell. The following selection presents Tucci's insights into the popularreligion of Tibet through The Tibetan Book of the Dead, which explains in apriestly style the fate of the life-stream entity. The concepts behind the textare the common beliefs of traditional Tibetan society. This selection alsointroduces the reader to other related beliefs and religious practices.Pamily life followed the same pattern everywhere, varied only by those momentsof joy, sadness or worry known to all of us. Birth, marriage, sickness and deathwere accompanied by their special customs, differing a little from place toplace and according to the wealth of the family involved.Childbirth was attended by none of the care and concern known in westerncountries. Birth was regarded as a completely natural function, and the physicalstrength necessary to the mother was not weakened by worries about hygiene.Prayers and talismans would help to make the birth safe and easy, according toage-old custom, and the intervention of the exorcist or the village lama wouldfrequently be requested, but doctors and midwives were unknown. The woman wasleft to herself, and only in rich families would she stay in bed, or be lookedafter, for a week or so. In the country she would resume her normal activitiesafter two or three days. Neither would the new-born child receive the care andprotection given in our society. It might be washed once in a while, and sincefuel was scarce and expensive the water would as likely as not be cold, or elsebe slightly warmed by the mother, who would take a mouthful at a time andsprinkle it over the baby's body. Much faith was placed in the talismans andchantings of the lamas summoned to welcome the new-born child, but infantmortality was very high. Accurate information is difficult to come by, as therewere no registrar's offices and no statistics, but it is probably noexaggeration to say that, up to the tenth year of life, it was over fifty percent.Male children were the favourites in Tibet, but owing to the high status enjoyedby women, the birth of a girl was in the end as joyful an occasion as the birthof a boy. Three or four days after the birth would come the celebration. Friendsand relations would visit the family, bringing gifts of food and the usual silkor gauze scarf, a necessary part of any ceremony. But a few days later a muchmore important event occurred, the casting of the baby's horoscope. There wasusually an astrologer, or tsipa, in every village. If by any chance there wasnone,the nearest one would be sent for. The hour, date and month of the birth werenoted, so that the horoscope could be carefully cast, and the favourable andunfavourable moments in the life of the child accurately foretold, according tothe influences of the Elements. Sometimes, especially in families of the poorerclasses, the day when the child was born would give it its first name: forexample, a boy born on Friday would be called Pasang, the Tibetan word forFriday. Other more personal names with an auspicious meaning might then betaken, such as Tondrup, \"he whose aims shall be achieved\" or \"he who hasfulfilled the wishes of his parents,\" a name having the double advantage ofevoking that of the Buddha Sakyamuni who was called Sarvarthasiddha, itsSanskrit equivalent. These names were changed if later the boy entered amonastic order. Then a religious name would be given him, probably chosen fromthose of the great teachers of the sect he joined.The giving of a name and the casting of the horoscope were celebrated with muchsolemnity, not only because of the Tibetan's natural enjoyment of festivities,but also in order to create a happy and therefore auspicious atmosphere at themoment when the new-born child was assuming his proper place and asserting hisown identity in the world.Marriage was of course another event to be celebrated with solemnity. It must benoted that Tibetan women enjoyed considerable freedom and, in practice if not intheory, lived on the same level as the men. They were never segregated orexpected to be bashful in the way law or custom decreed in other parts of theEast. They were also fortunate in possessing marked practical ability. Manywomen helped their husbands in business affairs or even acted on their ownaccount, and were more likely to increase the family fortunes than to squanderthem, because of this business sense. It was not unheard of for a civil servantto find some excuse to stay at home and direct his own affairs, sending his wifeoff to the office to do his work in his absence. I have myself frequently metthe wives of local governors who were temporarily carrying out their husbands'duties, and I have always admired the strictly ordered way in which they rantheir own houses as well as the way in which they conducted their businessaffairs. In the family, the mother had great authority, being responsible forthe upbringing of the children and the household expenditure. Even when the sonsof the family brought home wives, the mother would remain the central figure.Much has been written on the subject of polyandry, or the practice of a womantaking more than one husband by marrying not only the man she has been betrothedto but also his brothers. This custom did exist in every part of Tibet, but itwas not as common as is generally believed. Many explanations for it have beengiven; perhaps it arose because more females than males died in infancy, or manywomen as well as men entered monastic orders, or because it was desirable tokeep the family and the property undivided, especially among the richerfamilies. But monogamous marriages were the rule in all classes of society. Thechildren of a polyandrous union were considered to be the issue of the eldestbrother, to whom the mother was first married, and his brothers, even if theywere in fact the fathers of some of the children, would be called uncle by all.In such a union it was generally arranged so that only one of the brothers wasat home at any one time, the others being absent on business or for otherreasons. In some parts of Tibet, when the wife retired with one of the men, hisboots were left outside the door.Because of the position of women and the flexibility of family life, youngcouples were always acquainted before marriage, although the consent of theparents was a necessary formality. Girls being free to go out and meet young menin the course of the day's work or at a celebration, the choice of a partnerrested with the young people and depended on mutual attraction. Sometimes thegirl was already a mother. In the case of rich families, however, marriagebecame more of a contract as the financial interests of the parents wereinvolved, as well as the feelings of the couple, and the desire to save aheritage in peril could override the preferences of the children.The marriage ceremony had none of the complexity found in India. The lamasparticipated, but only because their presence was necessary on all occasions inlife. The wedding itself was perhaps the most secular event of all, accompaniedby no religious rites. Certain preliminaries were necessary. First of all, ithad to be established that there was no close kinship between the two families.Marriage between cousins was frowned on, causing a scandal when it did occur,but a man could marry his brother's widow, or even his father's, provided, ofcourse, that she was not his mother. Many of the rules which so severely governmarriage in India were completely absent in Tibet. The horoscopes of the couplewere studied to ensure that they were not incompatible: in the case of anyserious clashes the marriage would not take place. There were, however, certaindifficulties that could be smoothed over by consulting astrological manuals. Theastrologer was all-important during this preliminary phase, and when the firstdecisions had been taken, the intermediary was called in. He was either a memberof the family or a professional go-between, and his duty was to obtain thepermission of the bride's family, to negotiate her dowry and to establish thekind of presents, jewels and clothes that the bridegroom would give on the dayof the wedding. When agreement had been reached, the bride's family would acceptthe chhang which the intermediary had brought with him to offer at this moment.This meeting did no more than confirm an already existing agreement but it gavean air of solemnity to the proceedings. The intermediary's job was sometimesdeliberately made to appear more difficult than it was in fact, as this treatingbetween the two families, the long discussions, the banquets and the exchangingof chhang were a welcome break in the monotony of everyday life and no one wasanxious to hasten things unduly. Sometimes the discussions were spread over anumber of days, difficulties and obstacles being artificially created to give anair of drama. Chhang was of importance throughout the negotiations and had analmost religious significance at the wedding ceremony. Words which could bringto mind others, similar but with a different, unlucky meaning, were carefullyavoided at this time, but objects with auspicious names were freely exchanged,so that a joyful harmonious atmosphere was preserved. It was seen that nosterile woman approached during the ceremonies as her presence could be unluckyand mean that the couple would be childless.The wedding day was chosen by the astrologer and the eve spent in banqueting anddrinking chhang, friends of the two families and the intermediary allparticipating. The bride's mother would put the finishing touches to herdaughter's dress and the necessary rites were performed to ensure that thephuklha would not desert the bride's family and follow her to her new dwelling.In addition to the advice and warnings given to the bride by her mother, in richfamilies long sermons on the duties of married life were often delivered by someeloquent lama.The marriage procession started off at dawn, led by a man dressed in white,mounted on a white horse and carrying the si pa ho to ward off evil. This was asquare sheet of paper bearing a picture of a tortoise with its limbs clasping acircle. In the circle, symbols would be drawn to show the course of time andastrological combinations causing good or evil events. The position of theplanets at the bride's birth was also shown, so as to identify her place in thecosmic order and portend the favourable or unfavourable events in her life. Thencame the bride, also on horseback, dressed magnificently in many colouredgarments and wearing her finest trinkets, but with her face covered by a whitescarf as a sign of the modesty every girl of good family was supposed to show ather wedding. It was customary for her to weep as she left her family, while theprocession set off, with everyone shouting \"Trashi-delek,\" \"May it be auspiciousand well.\" The procession stopped outside the bridegroom's house. Now came themost dramatic moment of all. The house was locked and barred and a long dialogueensued during which questions and answers were exchanged in order to establish astate of complete mutual trust so that the uncertainty of the waiting periodmight be replaced by one of calm and happiness. Finally the door was opened andthe bride admitted, to be received by her parents-in-law and to take her placeon the chair reserved for her. The contract was sealed by the exchange ofscarves and copious servings of chhang and celebrations were soon in full swing.The bride had not come to live in the house of the bridegroom for good, however.She remained there for three to seven days after the ceremony, and then returnedto her parents' home. There was no fixed time for her to take up permanentresidence with her husband, this depending on the age of the couple and localcustom.Considering the absence of a binding civil or religious marriage ceremony andthe freedom of Tibetan women, it is hardly surprising that divorce was notuncommon, taking place by mutual consent. Long discussions were necessary toresolve the most important problem, the division of the property. The woman, ifno blame was attached to her, would ask for the return of her dowry, and wasentitled to claim some of the husband's possessions if she took the children ofthe marriage with her, as was her right. The village buzzed momentarily with thegossip, but it was soon forgotten since such events were not unexpected.A man is a man the world over, and the Tibetan did not take it kindly if hiswife committed adultery, for all the independence she might have. On discoveringthat his wife was unfaithful, the husband had the right to cut off the tip ofher nose. The victim would try to heal the wound by putting a black coveringover it.It was, therefore, customary to say, when something arousing scorn took place,\"It's a case for cutting noses.\" Wife-murder was not infrequent; but in thiscase the law took over and the culprit had to pay blood-money.The Tibetan approached illness with a mixture of religious convictions and abelief in magic together with the most advanced medical ideas from India, Chinaand Iran—and even Galen had been heard of—all countries where research intomedicine and pharmacology had been pursued in a constructive fashion. In Indiathere is a substantial body of writings on medicine, which reached Tibettogether with sacred literature and aroused widespread interest. Variousmanuals, which also included treatments and theories from China, helped todisseminate medical knowledge.But medicines, drugs and surgery were effective only up to a point. If the rightprayers were not said and divine intervention was refused, then no medicinewould bring about a cure. At the end of every book on medicine, as itsconclusion, there was a section on the \"mantras,\" or phrases to be recited bythe sick man himself or by the lama, to invoke divine power to enter the patientand the drugs he was taking. The medical manuals state that cures can beeffected by the use of medicine, dieting, courses of treatment, bleeding andexorcisms and religious ceremonies, thus affirming that the psychologicalelement was an essential one for the Tibetan. No clear demarcation was madebetween the body and the soul; the two were one, so that the soul, helped by theright religious and magic utterances, was able to act on the body andre-establish the right balance of humours, the disturbance of which had causedthe illness in the first place. My friend, Lopsang Tenpa, the president of theMentsikhang Medical College in Lhasa, once told me that in his opinion westernmedicine, which he knew a little about from his travels in India, was of courseincomplete, as it was built entirely on human knowledge and discoveries whichwere frequently misunderstood. \"But our own,\" he continued with great certainty,\"has the advantage of being revealed to us. The Great Physician, the Doctor whocures body and soul at once, the Buddha, who is a manifestation of cosmicconsciousness and absolute wisdom, has shown it to man.\"The famous medical school of Chakpori in Lhasa was therefore primarily a temple,with images ranged on the altars around the \"God of the colour of lapis-lazuli,\"the chief of eight divinities called the Mentha. These were the supreme doctors,since they taught men how to cure sin, the most powerful disharmony causingphysical infirmity.At Mentsikhang there was an extensive array of herbs and drugs of all kinds,roots, powders and plants, some from India and China as well as from Tibetitself. Medicines were usually made up in the form of pills, which wereappropriately blessed before being distributed to those in need of them, withinstructions not only on the dose to be taken, but on the times of day they wereto be swallowed and the prayers that were to be said with them. Medicine did notisolate man from the universe but he was considered to be so bound up with theelements that any treatment which did not take these into account would be notonly ineffective but positively harmful. Cosmic harmony had to be preserved, asthe most important factor in good health.Most of the herbs used as medicine were gathered on a mountain to the north ofLhasa, near the monastery of Sera. This mountain was the Garden of Aesculapiusto Tibetan doctors and great care was taken in the choice of the plants, whichcould be beneficial or harmful, more or less effective, depending on the season,or whether they grew on sunlit or northern slopes. Not all medicines wereextracted from herbs: sometimes metals, particularly gold, silver, zinc, ironand mercury, or stones, were used, as was the custom in India. Other remedieswere based on the belief in strange analogies between certain substances andparts of the body, as in the folk-medicine of any other country. So the gall ofoxen was used to treat weaknesses of the eyes, the spleen for abscesses, thetongue of a dog was often used to heal wounds and the liver of a dog was aremedy for leprosy.The basis of Tibetan medicine was the Indian theory of Humours, which in turnsprings from the ethical concept that physical imbalance is associated withspiritual imbalance. In other words, it is the work of karma, which controls thecourse of human life. Sickness, which originates in sin, is born with karma, andas soon as sin begins to trouble the human conscience, tainting man's originalinnocence and serenity, evil gives rise to illness. Karma operates under threeguises, as greed, wrath and torpor. These three defects have their parallels inthe three humours, wind, bile and phlegm. The theory and practice of medicinewere based on this fundamental scheme, and by means of endless classificationsand ramifications the whole system of interconnected causes, signs, symptoms andcures of the various kinds of sickness could be shown.These three humours permeate the whole body, but they govern, above all, thebrain, the abdomen and the bowels respectively. When one of the humours prevailsover the others, illness results. Wind influences the bones, ears, skin, fleshand arteries; bile governs the blood, sweat, eyes, liver and intestines; andphlegm has its effect on the chyle, flesh, fat, marrow and semen, the nose,tongue, lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, stomach and bladder.Surgery was rarely resorted to, and then only in the case of wounds, abscessesand the like. Even here it was necessary to establish the cause of thedisability. Cauterization was the treatment for malfunctioning of wind,bloodletting and cold compresses for disorders of the bile, cauterization andhot compresses for disorders of phlegm. Surgical instruments were few; thelance, the cautery, the mebum —a vessel in which paper was burnt and which wasthen applied to the part of the body to be bled—and the \"sucking-horn,\" whichdrew blood off by suction.The time comes when no medicine is effective, meaning that the patient is thevictim of his karma, and the sum of his sins is overtaking him, or else thatdemons have gained possession of him, amongst them the planets, always believedto be hostile. Some diseases are, in fact, caused exclusively by them, forinstance, epilepsy and apoplexy. The lu and the sadak, spirits from beneath theearth, are also easily offended and most vindictive. A slight upset, eveninvoluntary,can call down extreme wrath on man. Then medicine is no use and the doctorbecomes an exorcist.The reading of any book whose subject matter seemed particularly apt, or ofsacred texts in general, helped in such cases, for they represented the Buddha's\"verbal plane,\" embodied in sounds. The mere recitation of these writings had astrange but positive magical power, as of light dispelling darkness. Monks fromthe temple or the village lama were called to the sick man's bedside to read ormurmur the recommended books, the comprehension of which was immaterial. Eventhe lama did not always fully understand the text he was reading. The act ofreciting the appropriate words was, in itself, effective through the magicalpower of the sound produced. In this way the divine presence was evoked andhealing would result. Another method was to buy from the butcher a goat or asheep about to be slaughtered. The animal was then set free after a red ribbonhad been tied round its neck. As long as the ribbon lasted, the animal was safefrom recapture, and the saving of life in this way was also the saving of thesick man.The moment of death was a decisive one, governing the future destiny of thevictim. In case there was no immediate attainment of nirvana there was a limitof forty-nine days between the end of one life and the beginning of another, andthe dying man's fate depended on his clear awareness in the moments precedinghis end. Acts are important according to Buddhism, but only conscious acts, asconsciousness gives responsibility to the action, and this responsibility willbring the action to fruition. An involuntary action can bring no positiveresult. Buddhism acknowledges no soul, but in Tibet certain old beliefspersisted and it was thought that a certain spiritual entity analogous with thesoul existed, so that Buddhism there was occasionally tinged with thesesuperstitions among some people of lower doctrinal experience. The continuanceof our personality, which is destined to dissolve at death, is entrusted to thenampurshe, or consciousness. This preserves within itself the karmic remains ofpast existences, modified according to the kind of life led, which havedetermined the conditions of our present life. This consciousness, enriched byits new experiences, orders our future life at the moment of death, for it thenhas the power to project itself into a new set of components of the physicalpersonality, such as every living being possesses. Whether these are real orillusory is a question for the Buddhist metaphysicians.This new future depends on us, on our karma. So, on his deathbed, it wasnecessary to draw the dying man's attention, or rather, that of hisconsciousness, which contains his personality, to a consideration of what wasabout to befall him. There were existences far worse than that of a human beingin store for sinners: rebirth as an animal, descent into various hells, orbecoming one of the yidak, wretched beings who perpetually wander through space,tormented by thirst and hunger.Terrible visions of hell, where the damned suffer indescribable torments, hadbeen brought from India. It was thought that these wretched beings believed theysuffered, rather than that they suffered in fact, for everything is merely aproduct of the imagination, though to the uninitiated it has the value ofreality. The Tibetan, with his tendency to the macabre, drew an even grimmerpicture of hot and cold hells and frightful tortures, which are dwelt on atlength in a hair-raising literature, the delo. This is a series of accountsgiven by those who, on the brink of death, caught a glimpse of life beyond thetomb, but then returned to tell of the terrifying things they saw.An idea prevalent in Indian religious thinking is found also in Tibet. Theluminous awareness of what we are and what awaits us acts, at the moment ofdeparture, as a factor for our salvation since, as we see in the Song of theBlessed One, \"the dying man attains the same level as his thoughts occupied inhis last moment.\" To this end, a lama specialized in these rites would read anappropriate book, whispering the words into the ear of the dying man or of thecorpse. It mattered little if the man was already dead or not, as hisconsciousness would remain hovering about his body for several days. The book iscalled the Bardo-thodrol, \"the book whose mere recitation, when heard by thedead man during the period of his intermediate existence between the life he hasleft and the one he is to enter in forty-nine days' time, will lead him tosalvation.\" None of this applied, of course, to the saintly who, at the momentof death, were absorbed, in full consciousness, into the wonderful clear lightwhich is the Absolute itself made manifest, or who vanished into the sky in thesplendour of a rainbow.For more ordinary beings the intermediate state with its attendant dangersbegan. Apparitions were perceived by the dead man's consciousness, the mostexalted being flashes of contrasting light, which dazzled or invited him, atumultuous roaring, shapes which frightened or allured him. Then came seven daysduring which the five primary forces were revealed in the form of the fivesupreme Buddhas, the fivefold source of everything that exists. The five Buddhaseach appear with a \"Mother,\" coupled with whom they become manifest in theuniverse with all its variety. They were arranged in the form of a cross,representing infinite space, divided by two intersecting axes to mark the fivedirections of divine experience: the centre, east, south, west and north. Thesecret of their mysterious works was revealed and the dead man's consciousnesswas made aware of their true meaning. The forces thus represented are present inall of us and go to make up our personality of which they form the underlyingpattern; they are therefore also the means of salvation, when our gnosis, onunderstanding their nature, absorbs them. This is the knowledge thatannihilates, bringing us back from the apparent to the real, a return to ourorigin.When this salvation through recognition did not take place, a progressivedecline set in; visions of deities, which the dead man should think of asspringing from his own body, would appear. He must win the conviction that allimages, including the divine, are the creation of his own mind, emerging fromand returning to himself. The man who was not saved by such recognition wouldthen see six lights which corresponded to six kinds of existence, those of gods,of men, of demons, of animals, of ghosts (yidak) and of beings in hell. Theselights are pleasing and attractive; and he who surrendered to their persuasion,unmindful of what they represented, would be caught up in that existence whoselight most forcefully struck or attracted him. This happened because desirewould take over in this welter of images and volition, unless the purifying ofgnosis intervened; what we are is the effect of the ideas in which we believe.The fearsome gods would appear and had to be disposed of in the same way. Whenrecognition was absent, such visions would be regarded as the god of death, anddeath would be believed to be a reality, and the dead man caught up in thesucceeding phases of the karmic process, since all events are caused by our ownwill. Whatever can death be, let alone the god of death, in a philosophy whichreduces everything to a nebulous set of images? How can there be anyone thatdies, or causes to die, from the point of view of this doctrine, according towhich everything dissolves into the colourless, motionless light of cosmicconsciousness?After the thirteenth day, the dead man's consciousness, which up to now hadstayed in the vicinity of the corpse, harried by the wind of karma, andoccupying a slender body in a state of unrest, began to wander about in profoundgrief. After trying nine times in vain to re-enter the recently abandoned body,it vainly attempted to enter another. Frightening visions disturbed it andchased it from place to place. Liberation must be found in the knowledge thatthese visions too are illusory. Divine mercy had only to be invoked for them toflee away, provided that the mind could remain in a state of completetranquility during the ordeal.Many creatures would be saved, but many others would be led by their karma toembark on a new incarnation. In this case new visions of rebirth now appearedbefore the consciousness and corresponded to the four continents into which theworld is divided according to Indo-Tibetan cosmology. So a man had to be able todistinguish the signs of Jambudvipa, the continent blessed with regularappearances of the Buddha, from those of the other worlds where the teachings ofthe Buddha have not spread. He could, alternatively, allow himself to be drawntowards the heavens, the habitation of the gods, but would have to flee thedeceitful images of the world of the demons, of animals, the hungry ghosts, orhell. And he would have to be alert and wary, as karma would call up frighteningvisions to tempt him to take refuge in caves or lotus flowers, where he mightexpect to find escape from the turmoil surrounding him and the demons pursuinghim. These places of shelter would only be the entrances to unhappy forms ofexistence, during which he would have to expiate his past misdeeds.But not all was lost even in this sad situation since, by composing one's mindand meditating on the god Tamdrin, there were still two courses open: one was toreach a paradise of the Buddha, the other, the choice of the womb. The firstgoal was attained by concentrating the will towards this miraculous rebirth withcomplete and undivided faith. The second course was embarked on after thecontinent had been chosen, and it was not impossible to be born into a goodfamily, so as to live to the advantage of one's fellow-creatures, if this wasdesired with real sincerity and determination. No further effort was to be made,and a desire for one particular womb or a feeling of aversion for another wereavoided, as such feelings could reflect badly on the coming existence and wouldfavour the development of karma. Once the wish had been formed, the mind wasleft to rest in the thought of the three Sacred Gems, the Buddha, the Law, andthe Monastic Community.Such then was the way of salvation, except in the case of saints. Theconsciousness left the body through a tiny hole at the point where the cranialbones meet on the top of the head, the lama pulling out a hair to provide theway of escape. Since it was believed that the consciousness wandered in thevicinity for several days, the corpse was left in the house for a period ofthree to seven days, or even longer. The dead man was dressed in his bestclothes and placed in a sitting position, his hands crossed on his lap. Only thebodies of highly esteemed lamas were washed, and then this was done with watermade fragrant with herbs. The dead man was not left in the room where he diedbut was taken to another room where the picture of his personal deity (yi dam)was hung above him. He could not be touched for three days. If a member of thefamily were to touch his feet, for example, the deceased would run the risk ofgoing to hell. A lama would remain near him for several days, reading aloud froma sacred book and reciting the prayers for the dead: the rich would send forseven or fourteen monks from the nearest monastery to perform this rite. Thosewho were very wealthy would make a generous gift to the monastery, so that afuneral service could be held with the participation of all the monks, and almswould be given to the poor. Meanwhile the astrologer would establish the mostappropriate time for the burial, after consulting the dead man's horoscope andeach day a funeral meal would be eaten by the members of the family, friends,and the officiating lama. Some of the food was put in front of the corpse or hisimage. This food offering was placed before the image of the dead man forforty-nine days, the whole of the period of the intermediate existence. Theimage itself consisted of a piece of paper with the Sanskrit syllable nri(\"man\") and the word tsheledepa (dead) written on it, followed by the name ofthe deceased. Every seven days the piece of paper was burnt and another put inits place, and from the colour of the flames the lama was able to infer what newform of existence the dead man was progressing towards. The ashes were carefullycollected and mixed with water to make little conical stupas, like the tshatshamentioned previously, and put on the household altar or in a place set aside forthe purpose. On the appointed day, the corpse was taken to the cemetery. Afurther banquet brought the family together again and the last prayers weresaid, while the dead man was warned not to come near the house any more nor tobring misfortune to other members of the family. In some places a white scarfwas tied to the corpse's feet, the other end being held by the lama. Then thebody was carried out of the house by the Ragyapas, whose job it was to see tothe last funeral rites.There was no general method of disposing of the body, the custom varying fromplace to place and with the climate. In places where fuel was scarce one commonmethod was to take the body to the top of a mountain reserved for the purpose.It was then left to the vultures or beasts of prey, after the Ragyapas had cutit up to make it easier for the animals to consume. They even stripped off theflesh with their large knives, and threw it to the crows and vultures, or brokethe bones in pieces. A few days later the area was visited again and theremaining bones were crushed to a powder so that nothing of the body was left.In places where fuel was plentiful, the corpse was cremated; in other parts itwas thrown306 W. Y. Evans-Wentzinto a river. This is an old custom and sometimes, where the body was disposedof on a mountain-top, an effigy was made of the dead man, which was clothed andthrown into the river in place of the actual corpse.In the case of venerated lamas and also the Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas, theremains were placed in the hollow interior of chhortens.The lama would assist the members of the dead man's family to purify the house,death being a contamination, calling down supernatural, harmful forces. Therewas also a danger that the dead man himself might return to his earthly home totake vengeance for some offence, but the lamas performed the necessary rites torestore sanctity to the house and put everything to rights.The Bardo of the Moments of DeathW. Y. EVANS-WENTZW. Y. Evans-Wentz was an English scholar, educated at Oxford, where he alsotaught. He dedicated an important part of his life's work to Indian religioussubjects. His translation of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, published incollaboration with a Tibetan-scholar Lama, has entered world literature as anoriginal classic often compared to The Egyptian Book of the Dead, whichconcerned itself with the voyage of the \"soul\" into the underworld. Comparisonsare sometimes invidious, but C. G. Jung in his introduction to the text had thefollowing to say about the two texts: \"Unlike The Egyptian Book of the Dead,which always prompts one to say too much or too little, The Bardo Thodol offersone an intelligible philosophy addressed to human beings rather than to gods. .. .\" Reading the selection from The Bardo, the reader becomes familiar with oneof the most important Eastern religious texts.[Instructions on the symptoms of death, or the first stage of the Chikhai Bardo;the primary clear light seen at the moment of death]1 he first, the setting-face-to-face with the Clear Light, during theIntermediate State of the Moments of Death, is:Here [some there may be] who have listened much [to religious instructions] yetnot recognized; and [some] who, though recognizing, are, nevertheless, weak infamiliarity. But all classes of individuals who have received the practicalteachings [called] Guides will, if this be applied to them, be set face toface with the fundamental Clear Light; and, without any Intermediate State, theywill obtain the Unborn Dharma-Kdya, by the Great Perpendicular Path. 1The manner of application is:It is best if the guru from whom the deceased received guiding instructions canbe had; but if the guru cannot be obtained, then a brother of the Faith; or ifthe latter is also unobtainable, then a learned man of the same Faith; or,should all these be unobtainable, then a person who can read correctly anddistinctly ought to read this many times over. Thereby [the deceased] will beput in mind of what he had [previously] heard of the setting-face-to-face andwill at once come to recognize that Fundamental Light and undoubtedly obtainLiberation.As regards the time for the application [of these instructions]:When the expiration hath ceased, the vital-force will have sunk into thenerve-centre of Wisdom 2 and the Knower 3 will be experiencing the Clear Lightof the natural condition. 4 Then, the vital-force, 5 being thrown backwards andflying downwards through the right and left nerves, 6 the Intermediate Statemomentarily dawns.The above [directions] should be applied before [the vital-force hath] rushedinto the left nerve [after first having traversed the navel nerve-centre].The time [ordinarily necessary for this motion of the vital-force] is as long asthe inspiration is still present, or about the time required for eating a meal.7Then the manner of the application [of the instructions] is:When the breathing is about to cease, it is best if the Transference hath beenapplied efficiently; if [the application] hath been inefficient, then [addressthe deceased] thus:O nobly-born (so and so by name), the time hath now come for thee to seek thePath [in reality]. Thy breathing is about to cease. Thy guru hath set thee faceto face before with the Clear Light; and now thou art about to experience it inits Reality in the Bardo state, wherein all things are like the void andcloudless sky, and the naked, spotless intellect is like unto a transparentvacuum without circumference or centre. At this moment, know thou thyself; andabide in that state. I, too, at this time, am setting thee face to face.Having read this, repeat it many times in the ear of the person dying, evenbefore the expiration hath ceased, so as to impress it on the mind [of the dyingone].If the expiration is about to cease, turn the dying one over on the right side,which posture is called the \"Lying Posture of a Lion.\" The throbbing of thearteries [on the right and left side of the throat] is to be pressed.If the person dying be disposed to sleep, or if the sleeping state advances,that should be arrested, and the arteries pressed gently but firmly. 8 Therebythe vital-force will not be able to return from the median-nerve 9 and will besure to pass out through the Brahmanic aperture. 10 Now the realsetting-face-to-face is to be applied.At this moment, the first [glimpsing] of the Bardo of the Clear Light ofReality, which is the Infallible Mind of the Dharma-Kdya, is experienced by allsentient beings.308 W.

Evans-WentzThe interval between the cessation of the expiration and the cessation of theinspiration is the time during which the vital-force remaineth in themedian-nerve. 11The common people call this the state wherein the consciousness-principle 12hath fainted away. The duration of this state is uncertain. [It dependeth] uponthe constitution, good or bad, and [the state of] the nerves and vital-force. Inthose who have had even a little practical experience of the firm, tranquilstate of dhydna, and in those who have sound nerves, this state continueth for along time. 13In the setting-face-to-face, the repetition [of the above address to thedeceased] is to be persisted in until a yellowish liquid beginneth to appearfrom the various apertures of the bodily organs [of the deceased].In those who have led an evil life, and in those of unsound nerves, the abovestate endureth only so long as would take to snap a finger. Again, in some, itendureth as long as the time taken for the eating of a meal.In various Tantras it is said that this state of swoon endureth for about threeand one-half days. Most other [religious treatises] say for four days; and thatthis setting-face-to-face with the Clear Light ought to be persevered in [duringthe whole time].The manner of applying [these directions] is:If [when dying] one be by one's own self capable [of diagnosing the symptoms ofdeath], use [of the knowledge] should have been made ere this. 14 If [the dyingperson be] unable to do so, then either the guru, or a shishya, or a brother inthe Faith with whom the one [dying] was very intimate, should be kept at hand,who will vividly impress upon the one [dying] the symptoms [of death] as theyappear in due order [repeatedly saying, at first] thus: 15Now the symptoms of earth sinking into water are come. 16When all the symptoms [of death] are about to be completed, then enjoin upon[the one dying] this resolution, speaking in a low tone of voice in the ear:O nobly-born (or, if it be a priest, O Venerable Sir), let not thy mind bedistracted.If it be a brother [in the Faith], or some other person, then call him by name,and [say] thus:O nobly-born, that which is called death being come to thee now, resolve thus:\"O this now is the hour of death. By taking advantage of this death, I will soact, for the good of all sentient beings, peopling the illimitable expanse ofthe heavens, as to obtain the Perfect Buddhahood, by resolving on love andcompassion towards [them, and by directing my entire effort to] the SolePerfection.\"Shaping the thoughts thus, especially at this time when the Dharma-Kdya of ClearLight [in the state] after death can be realized for the benefit of all sentientbeings, know that thou art in that state; [and resolve] that thou wilt obtainthe best boon of the State of the Great Symbol, 17 in which thou art, [asfollows]:\"Even if I cannot realize it, yet will I know this Bardo, and, mastering theGreat Body of Union in Bardo, will appear in whatever [shape] will benefit [allbeings] whomsoever: 18 I will serve all sentient beings, infinite in number asare the limits of the sky.\"Keeping thyself unseparated from this resolution, thou shouldst try to rememberwhatever devotional practices thou wert accustomed to perform during thylifetime. 19In saying this, the reader shall put his lips close to the ear, and shall repeatit distinctly, clearly impressing it upon the dying person so as to prevent hismind from wandering even for a moment.After the expiration hath completely ceased, press the nerve of sleep firmly;and, a lama, or a person higher or more learned than thyself, impress in thesewords, thus:Reverend Sir, now that thou art experiencing the Fundamental Clear Light, try toabide in that state which now thou art experiencing.And also in the case of any other person the reader shall set him face-to-facethus:O nobly-born (so-and-so), listen. Now thou art experiencing the Radiance of theClear Light of Pure Reality. Recognize it. O nobly-born, thy present intellect,20 in real nature void, not formed into anything as regards characteristics orcolour, naturally void, is the very Reality, the All-Good. 21Thine own intellect, which is now voidness, yet not to be regarded as of thevoidness of nothingness, but as being the intellect itself, unobstructed,shining, thrilling, and blissful, is the very consciousness, 22 the All-goodBuddha. 23Thine own consciousness, not formed into anything, in reality void, and theintellect, shining and blissful,—these two,—are inseparable. The union of themis the Dharma-Kdya state of Perfect Enlightenment. 24Thine own consciousness, shining, void, and inseparable from the Great Body ofRadiance, hath no birth, nor death, and is the Immutable Light— Buddha Amitabha.25Knowing this is sufficient. Recognizing the voidness of thine own intellect tobe Buddhahood, and looking upon it as being thine own consciousness, is to keepthyself in the [state of the] divine mind 26 of the Buddha. 27Repeat this distinctly and clearly three or [even] seven times. That will recallto the mind [of the dying one] the former [i.e. when living]setting-face-to-face by the guru. Secondly, it will cause the nakedconsciousness to be recognized as the Clear Light; and, thirdly, recognizingone's own self [thus], one becometh permanently united with the Dharma-Kdya andLiberation will be certain.[Instructions concerning the second stage of the Chikhai Bardo: the secondaryclear light seen immediately after death]Thus the primary Clear Light is recognized and Liberation attained. But if it befeared that the primary Clear Light hath not been recognized, then [it cancertainly be assumed] there is dawning [upon the deceased] that called the310 W. Y. Evans-Wentzsecondary Clear Light, which dawneth in somewhat more than a mealtime periodafter that the expiration hath ceased. 29According to one's good or bad karma, the vital-force floweth down into eitherthe right or left nerve and goeth out through any of the apertures [of thebody]. Then cometh a lucid condition of the mind. 30To say that the state [of the primary Clear Light] endureth for a meal-timeperiod [would depend upon] the good or bad condition of the nerves and alsowhether there hath been previous practice or not [in the setting-face-to-face].When the consciousness-principle getteth outside [the body, it sayeth toitself], \"Am I dead, or am I not dead?\" It cannot determine. It seeth itsrelatives and connexions as it had been used to seeing them before. It evenheareth the waitings. The terrifying karmic illusions have not yet dawned. Norhave the frightful apparitions or experiences caused by the Lords of Death 31yet come.During this interval, the directions are to be applied [by the lama or reader]:There are those [devotees] of the perfected stage and of the visualizing stage.If it be one who was in the perfected stage, then call him thrice by name andrepeat over and over again the above instructions of setting-face-to-face withthe Clear Light. If it be one who was in the visualizing stage, then read out tohim the introductory descriptions and the text of the Meditation on his tutelarydeity, 32 and then say,O thou of noble-birth, meditate upon thine own tutelary deity.—[Here the deity'sname is to be mentioned by the reader. 33 ] Do not be distracted. Earnestlyconcentrate thy mind upon thy tutelary deity. Meditate upon him as if he werethe reflection of the moon in water, apparent yet inexistent [in itself].Meditate upon him as if he were a being with a physical body.So saying, [the reader will] impress it.If [the deceased be] of the common folk, say,Meditate upon the Great Compassionate Lord. 34By thus being set-face-to-face even those who would not be expected to recognizethe Bardo [unaided] are undoubtedly certain to recognize it.Persons who while living had been set face to face [with the Reality] by a guru,yet who have not made themselves familiar with it, will not be able to recognizethe Bardo clearly by themselves. Either a guru or a brother in the Faith willhave to impress vividly such persons. 35There may be even those who have made themselves familiar with the teachings,yet who, because of the violence of the disease causing death, may be mentallyunable to withstand illusions. For such, also, this instruction is absolutelynecessary.Again [there are those] who, although previously familiar with the teachings,have become liable to pass into the miserable states of existence, owing tobreach of vows or failure to perform essential obligations honestly. To them,this [instruction] is indispensable.If the first stage of the Bardo hath been taken by the forelock, that is best.But if not, by application of this distinct recalling [to the deceased], whilein the second stage of the Bardo, his intellect is awakened and attainethliberation.While on the second stage of the Bardo, one's body is of the nature of thatcalled the shining illusory-body. 36Not knowing whether [he be] dead or not, [a state of] lucidity cometh [to thedeceased.]. 37 If the instructions be successfully applied to the deceased whilehe is in that state, then, by the meeting of the Mother-Reality and theOffspring-Reality, 38 karma controlleth not. 39 Like the sun's rays, forexample, dispelling the darkness, the Clear Light on the Path dispelleth thepower of karma.That which is called the second stage of the Bardo dawneth upon thethought-body. 40 The Knower hovereth within those places to which its activitieshad been limited. If at this time this special teaching be applied efficiently,then the purpose will be fulfilled; for the karmic illusions will not have comeyet, and, therefore, he [the deceased] cannot be turned hither and thither [fromhis aim of achieving Enlightenment].NOTESiText: Yar-gyi-sang-thal-chen-po: the \"Great Straight Upward Path.\" One of theDoctrines peculiar to Northern Buddhism is that spiritual emancipation, evenBuddhahood, may be won instantaneously, without entering upon the Bardo Planeand without further suffering on the age-long pathway of normal evolution whichtraverses the various worlds of sangsdric existence. The doctrine underlies thewhole of the Bardo Thodol. Faith is the first step on the Secret Pathway. Thencomes Illumination; and, with it, Certainty; and, when the Goal is won,Emancipation. But here again success implies very unusual proficiency in yoga,as well as much accumulated merit, or good karma, on the part of the devotee. Ifthe disciple can be made to see and to grasp the Truth as soon as the gurureveals it, that is to say, if he has the power to die consciously, and at thesupreme moment of quitting the body can recognize the Clear Light which willdawn upon him then, and become one with it, all sangsdric bonds of illusion arebroken asunder immediately: the Dreamer is awakened into Reality simultaneouslywith the mightly achievement of recognition.2 Here, as elsewhere in our text, \"nerve-centre\" refers to a psychicnerve-centre. The psychic nerve-centre of Wisdom is located in the heart.3 Text: Shespa (pron. Shepa): \"Mind,\" \"Knower,\" i.e., the mind in its knowing,or cognizing, functions.4 Text: Sprosbral (pron. Todal): \"devoid of formative activity;\" i.e., the mindin its natural, or primal, state. The mind in its unnatural state, that is tosay, when incarnate in a human body, is, because of the driving force of thefive senses, continuously in thought-formation activity. Its natural, ordiscarnate, state is a state of quiescence, comparable to its condition in thehighest of dhydna (or deep meditation) when still united to a human body. Theconscious recognition of the Clear Light induces an ecstatic condition ofconsciousness such as saints and mystics of the West have called Illumination.5 Text: rlung (pron. lung): \"vital-air,\" or \"vital-force,\" or psychic-force.\"6 Text: risa-gyas-gyon (pron. tsa-yay-yon): \"right and left [psychic] nerves;\"Skt. Pingdla-nddl (right [psychic] nerve) and Idd-nddl (left [psychic] nerve).7 When this text first took form the reckoning of time was, apparently, yetprimitive, mechanical time-keeping appliances being unknown. A similar conditionstill prevails in many parts of Tibet, where the period of a meal-time isfrequently mentioned in old religious books—a period of from twenty minutes tohalf an hour in duration.8 The dying person should die fully awake and keenly conscious of the process ofdeath; hence the pressing of the arteries.9 Skt. of text: dhutih (pron. duti), meaning \"median-nerve,\" but lit.\"trijunction.\" V. S. Apte's Sanscrit-English Dictionary gives dhiiti as the onlysimilar word, defined as \"shaking\" or \"moving,\" which, if applied to our text,may refer to the vibratory motion of the psychic force traversing themedian-nerve as its channel.\"— Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup.\"Duti may also mean 'throwing away,' or 'throwing out,' with reference to theoutgoing of the consciousness in the process of death.\"—Sj. Atal Bihari Ghosh.10 If non-distracted, and alertly conscious, at this psychological moment, thedying person will realize, through the power conferred by the reading of theThodol, the importance of holding the vital-force in the median-nerve till itpasses out thence through the Aperture of Brahma.11 After the expiration has ceased, the vital-force (lit. \"inner-breath\") isthought to remain in the median-nerve so long as the heart continues to throb.312 W. Y. Evans-Wentz12 Text: rnam-shes (pron. man-she): Skt. vijnana or, preferably, chaitanya:\"conscious-principle\" or \"object-knowing principle.''13 Sometimes it may continue for seven days, but usually only for four or fivedays. The consciousness-principle, however, save in certain conditions oftrance, such as a yogi, for example, can induce, is not necessarily resident inthe body all the while; normally it quits the body at the moment called death,holding a subtle magnetic-like relationship with the body until the statereferred to in the text comes to an end. Only for adepts in yoga would thedeparture of the consciousness-principle be accomplished without break in thecontinuity of the stream of consciousness, that is to say, without the swoonstate referred to.The death process is the reverse of the birth process, birth being theincarnating, death the discarnating of the consciousness-principle; but, in bothalike, there is a passing from one state of consciousness into another. And,just as a babe must wake up in this world and learn by experience the nature ofthis world, so, likewise, a person at death must wake up in the Bardo world andbecome familiar with its own peculiar conditions. The Bardo body, formed ofmatter is an invisible or ethereal-like state, is an exact duplicate of thehuman body, from which it is separated in the process of death. Retained in theBardo body are the consciousness-principle and the psychic nerve-system (thecounterpart, for the psychic or Bardo body, of the physical nerve-system of thehuman body).14 The full meaning implied is that not only should the person about to diediagnose the symptoms of death as they come, one by one, but that he shouldalso, if able, recognize the Clear Light without being set face to face with itby some second person.15 Compare the following instructions, from Ars Moriendi (fifteenth century),Comper's ed. \"When any of likelihood shall die [i.e., is likely to die], then itis most necessary to have a special friend, the which will heartily help andpray for him, and therewith counsel the sick for the weal [i.e., health] of hissoul.\"16 The three chief symptoms of death (which the text merely suggests by namingthe first of them, it being taken for granted that the reader officiating willknow the others and name them as they occur), with their symbolicalcounterparts, are as follows: (1) a bodily sensation of pressure, \"earth sinkinginto water;\" (2) a bodily sensation of clammy coldness as though the body wereimmersed in water, which gradually merges into that of feverish heat, \"watersinking into fire;\" (3) a feeling as though the body were being blown to atoms,\"fire sinking into air.\" Each symptom is accompanied by visible external changesin the body, such as loss of control over facial muscles, loss of hearing, lossof sight, the breath coming in gasps just before the loss of consciousness,whereby lamas trained in the science of death detect, one by one, theinterdependent psychic phenomena culminating in the release of the Bardo bodyfrom its human-plane envelope. The translator held that the science of death, asexpounded in this treatise, has been arrived at through the actual experiencingof death on the part of learned lamas, who, when dying, have explained to theirpupils the very process of death itself, in analytical and elaborate detail.17 In this state, realization of the Ultimate Truth is possible, providingsufficient advance on the Path has been made by the deceased before death.Otherwise, he cannot benefit now, and must wander on into lower and lowerconditions of the Bardo, as determined by karma, until rebirth.18 The Tibetan of the text is here unusually concise. Literally rendered it is,'will appear in whatever will subdue [for beneficial ends] whomsoever.' Tosubdue in this sense any sentient being of the human world, a form which willappeal religiously to that being is assumed. Thus, to appeal to a Shaivitedevotee, the form of Shiva is assumed; to a Buddhist, the form of the BuddhaShakya Muni; to a Christian, the form of Jesus; to a Moslem, the form of theProphet; and so on for other religious devotees; and for all manners andconditions of mankind a form appropriate to the occasion—for example, forsubduing children, parents, and vice versa; for shishyas, gurus, and vice versa;for common people, kings or rulers; and for kings, ministers of state.19 Compare the following, from The Book of the Craft of Dying, in Bodleian MS.423 (circa fifteenth century): \"Also, if he that shall die have long time andspace to be-think himself, and be not taken with hasty death, then may be readafore him, of them that be about him, devout histories and devout prayers, inthe which he most delighted in when he was in heal [i.e. health].\"20 Text: Shes-rig (pron. She-rig) is the intellect, the knowing or cognizingfaculty.21 Text: Chos-nyid Kun-tu-bzang-po (pron.Cho-nyid Kiintu-zang-po), Skt.Dhanna-Dhatu Samanta-Bhadra, the embodiment of the Dharma-Kaya, the first stateof Buddhahood. Our Block-Print text, in error here, gives for the All-Good(Kuntu-Zang-po meaning \"All-Good Father\") Kuntu-Zang-mo, which means \"All-GoodMother.\" According to the Great Perfectionist School, the Father is that whichappears, or phenomena, the Mother is that which is conscious of the phenomena.Again, Bliss is the Father, and the Voidness perceiving it, the Mother; theRadiance is the Father, and the Voidness perceiving it, the Mother; and, as inour text here, the intellect is the Father, the Voidness the Mother. Therepetition of \"void\" is to emphasize the importance of knowing the intellect tobe in reality void (or of the nature of voidness), i.e., of the unborn,uncreated, unshaped Primordial.22 Text: Rig-pa, meaning \"consciousness\" as distinct from the knowing faculty bywhich it cognizes or knows itself to be. Ordinarily, rig-pa and shes-rig aresynonymous; but in an abstruse philosophical treatise, as herein, rig-pa refersto the consciousness in its purest and most spiritual (i.e., supramundane)aspect, and shes-rig to the consciousness in that grosser aspect, not purelyspiritual, whereby cognizance of phenomena is present.In this part of the Bardo Thodol the psychological analysis of consciousness ormind is particularly abstruse. Wherever the text contains the word rig-pa wehave rendered it as \"consciousness,\" and the word shes-rig as \"intellect,\" orelse, to suit the context, rig-pa as \"consciousness\" and shes-rig as\"consciousness of phenomena,\" which is \"intellect.^Text: Kun-tu-bzang-po: Skt. Samanta (\"All\" or \"Universal\" or \"Complete.\" Bhadra(\"Good\" or \"Beneficent In this state, the experiencer and the thing experiencedare inseparably one and the same, as, for example, the yellowness of gold cannotbe separated from gold, nor saltness from salt. For the normal human intellectthis transcendental state is beyond comprehension.24 From the union of the two states of mind, or consciousness, implied by thetwo terms rig-pa and shes-rig, and symbolized by the All-Good Father and theAll-Good Mother, is born the state of the Dharma-Kaya, the state of PerfectEnlightenment, Buddhahood. The Dharma-Kaya (\"Body of Truth\") symbolizes thepurest and the highest state of being, a state of supramundane consciousness,devoid of all mental limitations or obscurations which arise from the contact ofthe primordial consciousness with matter.25 As the Buddha-Samanta-Bhadra state is the state of the All-Good, so theBuddha-Amitabha state is the state of the Boundless Light; and, as the textimplies, both are, in the last analysis, the same state, merely regarded fromtwo viewpoints. In the first, is emphasized the mind of the All-Good, in thesecond, the enlightening Bodhi power, symbolized as Buddha Amitabha thepersonification of the Wisdom faculty), Source of Life and Light.26 Text: dgongs-pa pron. gong-pa*: \"thoughts\" or \"mind.\" and, being in thehonorific form, \"divine mind.\"27 Realization of the Son-Sangsara. which is the Yoidness. the Unbecome. theInborn, the Unmade, the Unformed, implies Buddhahood. Perfect Enlightenment—thestate of the Divine Mind of the Buddha. Compare the following passage, from TheDiamond [or Immutable] Sutra, with its Chinese commentary: \"Even form or qualityof phenomena is transient and illusive. When the mind realizes that thephenomena of life are not real phenomena, the Lord Buddha may then be clearlyperceived.\"— (Chinese Annotation: \"The spiritual Buddha must be realized withinthe mind, otherwise there can be no true perception of the Lord Buddha.\"2S If. when dying, one be familiar with this state, in virtue of previousspiritual ior yogic) training in the human world, and have power to winBuddhahood at this all-determining moment, the Wheel of Rebirth is stopped, andLiberation instantaneously achieved. But such spiritual efficiency is so veryrare that the normal mental condition of the person dying is unequal to thesupreme feat of holding on to the state in which the Clear Light shines; andthere follows a progressive descent into lower and lower states of the Bardoexistence, and then rebirth. The simile of a needle balanced and set rolling ona thread is used by the lamas to elucidate this condition. So long as the needleretains its balance, it remains on the thread. Eventually, however, the law ofgravitation affects it, and it falls. In the realm of the Clear Light,similarly, the mentality of a person dying momentarily enjoys a condition ofbalance, or perfect equilibrium, and of oneness. Owing to unfamiliarity withsuch a state, which is an ecstatic state of non-ego, of subliminalconsciousness, the consciousness-principle of the average human being lacks thepower to function in it; karmic propensities becloud the consciousness principlewith thoughts of personality, of individualized being, of dualism, and, losingequilibrium, the consciousness-principle falls away from the Clear Light. It isideation of ego. of self, which prevents the realization of Sirvana which is the\"blowing out of the flame of selfish longing\"); and so the Wheel of Lifecontinues to turn.29 Immediately after the passing of the vital-force into the median-nerve, theperson dying experiences the Clear Light in its primitive purity, theDharma-Kaya unobscured; and, if unable to hold fast to that experience, nextexperiences the secondary Clear Light, having fallen to a lower state of theBardo, wherein the Dharma-Kaya is dimmed by karmic obscurations.^Text: shes-pa. rendered here as \"mind.\" The translator has added the followingcomment: \"The vital-force, passing from the navel psychie-nerve centre, and theprinciple of consciousness, passing from the brain psychic-nerve centre, unitein the heart psychie-nerve centre, and in departing thence from the body,normally through the Aperture of Brahma, produce in the dying person a state ofecstasy of the greatest intensity. The succeeding stage is less intense. In thefirst, or primary, stage, is experienced the Primary Clear Light, in the secondstage, the Secondary Clear Light. A ball set bounding reaches its greatestheight at the first bound; the second bound is lower, and each succeeding boundis still lower until the ball comes to rest. Similarly is it with theconsciousness-principle at the death of a human body. Its first spiritual bound,directly upon quitting the earth-plane body, is the highest: the next is lower.Finally, the force of karma having spent itself in the after-death state, theconsciousness-principle comes to rest, a womb is entered, and then comes rebirthin this world.\"31 Text: Gshin-rje (pron.

So with those who have been taught the theory of how to act in the time ofdeath and have not applied, through yogic practices, the theory: they cannotmaintain unbroken continuity of consciousness: they grow bewildered at thechanged conditions; and fail to progress or to take advantage of the opportunityoffered by death, unless upheld and directed by a living guru.

He lived therefor a considerable period of time and wrote a muchacclaimed travel book about his adventures in what was then a rarely visitedregion of the world. In this selection, Harrer tells about his experiencesrevisiting Tibet in 1982 and how despite the fact that much had changed, he wasable to rediscover familiar landmarks and also renew friendships with Tibetanshe had not seen for thirty years. The selection puts in context the tremendouschanges that are taking place in Tibetan culture and the great sense of lossthese changes provoked in a European devoted to the Tibetan people and their wayof life.It was the spring of 1982. Thirty years later. I was back in Lhasa, and alone atlast. I had risen early and could go wherever I wished. Without a chaperon—whatbliss! My time was precious and I wanted to miss as little as possible. First Istrolled to Lingkhor, an eight-kilometre (five-mile) pilgrimage road aroundLhasa; today it survives in sections only. I recalled our arrival in Lhasa overthirty years ago, when we were paying our courtesy calls. That time we had alsogone to see the monk-minister on Lingkhor, and I now remembered his words: \"Inour ancient writings there is a prophecy that a great power from the north willmake war on Tibet, destroy religion, and make itself master of the whole world.. . .\"Lingkhor no longer exists in its old form—running through gardens full offlowers and past picturesque corners. I was surprised to see that on anasphaltedroad, with buses and lorries circulating, pilgrims were prostrating themselves—until I realized that I was on Lingkhor already. I saw a few stonemasonschiselling figures of deities, and some incense-burners were alight in the roadaround a place of offerings canopied by prayer-flags and guarded by an old monk.I strolled on along the transformed Lingkhor and discovered a still delightfulspot by a tributary of the Kyichu. I knew the spot well from the past, and Iknew that the 'Blue Buddha' was here reflected in the water's surface. Severaltimes on this trip I asked myself if I was really in the country which for sevenyears had been my home—but at this spot, for the first time, I felt that,outwardly at least, nothing had changed. The faithful passing this freshlyrepainted rock relief touch the sacred rock with their foreheads, their backsand their hands—just as they had done in the past.I stopped for a long time, until scarcely anyone was in sight. Lhasa was faraway, long and weary shadows were already slipping down the rocks, and thelittle stream was rushing along melodiously. I discovered some left-overs of theNew Year—old tins with the green sprouts of barley. I gazed up at the BlueBuddha, his left hand gripping a thunderbolt, a symbol of immutability andindestructibility. Numerous other incarnations from the lamaist pantheonsurround the central divine figure, among them, enthroned, the eleven-headedChenrezi, the \"god of mercy,\" whose incarnation is the Dalai Lama. In the duskthe many prayer-flags were weaving among the trees, and I did not find itdifficult to believe that the spot was still inhabited by the spirits whichguard the religion and the gods. Unlike the old days, there were hardly anybeggars; only ducks beating their wings, as they had always done, whenever oneof the few pilgrims fed them at this last romantic spot in Lhasa.As I returned to that city an almost spectral silence hung over houses andstreets. A few nomads were approaching; they asked me for a picture of the DalaiLama and told me they had been on the move for five months; they would stay aweek in Lhasa. I went on until I came to Barkhor, the inner ring-road enclosingthe Tsuglagkhang, the most sacred of Tibetan temples. In the old days the city'sentire life was concentrated on Barkhor, where most of the shops were. I hadthen written in my diary:Barkhor has its heyday at the New Year. Here all religious ceremonies andprocessions begin and end. In the evenings, especially on holy days, thefaithful move along Barkhor in huge numbers; they mumble their prayers, and manyof them measure out the distance by flinging their bodies to the ground. Yetthis inner ring-road also has a less pious aspect: pretty young women theredisplay their colourful costumes, their turquoise and coral jewellery, theyflirt with the nobles, and the local beauties of easier virtue also find therewhat they are after. The centre of commerce, of social life and of gossip—thatis Barkhor.The Mani and lama singers no longer exist. They used to sit on the ground in theold days, a thangka would hang on the wall, illustrating the life of some saint,and in a sing-song voice they would relate to their listeners the most wondroustales, all the while turning their prayer-wheels.This time, too, Barkhor was swarming with people whose features radiatedcontentment. Many of the older women recognized me, started to cry, and asked ifI could tell them anything about the Dalai Lama, or if I had a picture of himfor them. I asked them how many Tibetans were still nangpa after thirty years ofcommunism. Nangpa means \"within\" and it denotes people within the Buddhistfaith. \"About 100 per cent,\" was their brief answer. \"What's become of Po-la,the one with the beard, surely there were two of you?\" They meant PeterAufschnai-ter. They offered me pots and ritual vessels of copper, brass andbronze, old and beautiful ones, which they wanted to sell for very little money,for 50 to 100 yuan, about the same number of Swiss francs. Dozens of youngTibetans, who could not have known me from the past, soon crowded around us.They were astonished and amused to find a stranger speaking their Lhasa dialect.In reply to a question from me our Chinese guide had told me: \"Of course you canbuy those things.\" But everyone knew that it was forbidden, and I felt fairlysure the pots would be taken away from us before our departure. A pity, sinceboth sides would have benefited from the transaction. And the example of othercountries has shown what a blessing it was that Europeans purchased or carriedoff artistic treasures which would otherwise have been destroyed. Thus a fewmuseums at least can testify today to the culture of the Tibetan people.Here on Barkhor, at the foot of the Potala, one could just about visualize howenchanting this city was in the past. The Tibetans invariably used only stoneand timber to erect their beautiful buildings. Just imagine: those blocks ofgranite were joined together without any cement, only with clay, and thegigantic Potala, constructed in this manner, has withstood all earthquakes.But now the \"modern age\" has arrived. Following the Chinese invasion, everythingwas transformed except the small inner kernel of the city. All round, as far asthe eye can roam, there is now a sea of hideous tin roofs. I stood on the roofof the Potala and was blinded by the ugly tin; I had to shut my eyes. The wholeatmosphere of the city was gone. I talked about it to Wangdii, who is presentlyresponsible for the maintenance of the Potala. I reminded him of the many timeswe had talked about building a new Lhasa with a great canal, with fresh waterbetween Norbulingka and the Tolung valley. Aufschnaiter and I had already drawnup plans and made drawings. All the banks were to be covered with flowers, likethe hanging-gardens of Babylon, and trees were to be planted in front of thepalace. Instead, there is now this sad wasteland of tin roofs. Wangdiiremembered our plans perfectly well; he assured me he would use his influence tohave all the hideousness removed and instead have traditional timber-and-stonehouses erected at the foot of the Potala.The vast part of Shugtri-Lingka is also irretrievably lost. It started at thedense cluster of houses in the little village of Sho, below the Potala, wherethe Dalai Lama's state printing-press and stabling were located, as well as theprison, and extended all the way to the Kyichu. At the centre of the park stooda stone throne, Shugtri, which for certain rare ceremonies served the Dalai Lamaas a seat. Here I used to walk with the Nepalese ambassador, twice a year, inorder—as mentioned before—to pick asparagus. Now this too is a sea of cheaphutments and tinroofed houses.The Potala, the emblem of Lhasa, has survived everything—the centuries, severalearthquakes and, worst of all, the destructive fury of the Red Guards. Maybe itsspacious internal courtyard, where the fantastic black-hatted dancers used toperform, will again be the scene of similar events for the benefit of tourists.But never again will spectators sit at different levels of the palace, robed inprecious brocade and brilliant shimmering silk: on the top floor the Dalai Lamawith his three attendants; on the floor below him the solemn figure of theRegent; next the ministers, the parents of the Lama-king and the rest of hisrelations; finally among them, in those days, myself—staring respectfully atTibet's high dignitaries.Instead of brocade and silk, future spectators will wear blue-and-greenuniforms, and identical caps on their heads. My unforgettable impressions of thevarious colourful hats, the splendid variety of garments and furs now belong tothe past—only in museums will people be able to admire that pomp. There is nodoubt that intelligent tourists can do something to preserve these ancientcultural values. One would need to support the Tibetans tactfully andsensitively, assuring them that it is of the utmost importance that ancientcustoms and rites are preserved before—as might so easily happen—it is too late.We Europeans have also frequently been late—sometimes, unfortunately, toolate—in realizing the importance of cultivating and safeguarding our culturalheritage.Buddhism: Mantrayanaand VajrayanaFOKKE SIERKSMAThe following selection by Fokke Sierksma places the Tantric material in adifferent context from that of such writers as Eliade, Zimmer and Campbell.Sierksma views Tantra as the development of an antinomian religious movement ofspecial appeal to those elements in Hindu-Buddhist society that were\"disenfranchised\" by the dominant social groups. This selection offers aninsight into the way religious movements develop in response to social andpsychological pressures. This view does not invalidate the religious or mysticalclaims of Tantra, but rather helps to explain the constituency that was preparedto accept its novel viewpoint.Jome three or four centuries after its inception between 200 and 100B.C.,magical formulas penetrated into the Mahayana, which could serve to commandgood or evil forces. If mysticism is the most international form ofspiritualised religion, magic is the most international form of religiondirected towards material ends. Spells and magical means of killing an enemy ata distance, finding a treasure, making a woman fall in love, or identifyingwitches and rendering them harmless, are to be found in practically allprimitive or complex cultures. Those who would defend the principle thatBuddhism always remained the same, may point out traces of magic even in theearliest texts, but that does not alter the fact that in the third phase of thisreligion the stream of spells becomes a deluge. Magic became an integral part ofBuddhism. In the fourth century a.d. Hsi Ts'o-chih wrote so enthusiasticallyabout one particular Chinese Mahayana monastery, where fasting and study was notshirked, and where no magic was performed, that one can only conclude he haddiscovered an exception to the general rule.India would not be India, if it had not been attempted to make something of thisdevelopment also and to raise it to a higher level. The magic spells— mantras—were not only used for profane ends such as the death of an enemy or the loveof a woman, tttey were also used in mystic, magic rituals, in which the adeptvisualised a god in the yogic manner, and then identified himself with him, inorder to obtain by the quick way that liberation which in the Mahayana couldonly be procured through moral purification and philosophical knowledge. Thetext of these rituals is found in the tantras, whose magic character forms acontrast with the sutras of the first two phases of Buddhism. This was theorigin of Tantrism or Mantrayana. Thus the vehicle of magic spells includes boththe secret formulas for compassing deserving and undeserving profane ends, andthe liturgical and yogic texts leading to speedy liberation. For that matter,these two aims were by no means mutually exclusive. That they should be pursuedtogether was extremely characteristic of the great pressure obviously exerted bythe people, and remained typical of the third phase right into Tibet. One mightsay of the Hinayana elite, who sought their own salavation and took it forgranted that they should be maintained by the laity in the mean time, that theywanted to have their cake and eat it. In the Mantrayana this could be applied tothe people, who wanted speedy and complete spiritual liberation while wishing toobtain material advantages by the same magical mystical way.This was not yet the end of the concessions. Around the 7th century A.D. thecult of Siva, already discussed in the first part of this chapter, became aredoubtable foe of Buddhism. The adherents of this god attempted to obtain theirdesire by violent means, as an Indian philosopher puts it. The manner in whichthey professed their faith is a clear protest against their society, which theyconfronted in a way calculated to shock: they went naked, carrying a club as asymbol of sexuality and aggressivity, jabbered nonsense, made obscene gesturesin the presence of women, drank wine from human skulls, and meditated incemeteries. Caste was not acknowledged by them, from which one may conclude thattheir action was a continual protest on the part of outcasts and other victimsof India's social organisation. If in the beginning of this chapter Siva wascalled an explosion of autochthonous religion, here he must also be termed anoutburst of social rebellion. In both cases he is the rude and untutoredrepresentative of the natural appetites. The fact that he is also the greatyogin, shows that outcasts too are people with their own ideas of human dignity.Siva had a female partner, who became increasingly important in this periodowing to the influence of Saktism. The followers of this sect were of opinion,that God was a woman and expressed this by contemplation of the female genitalorgan, either in effigy or in actuality. This short-cut identifying mind andnature was most probably also a form of social protest, and at the same time areactivation of autochthonous religion in stirring times of social and politicalunrest. The sect entered into partnership with Saivism, bringing Siva's femalecompanion, the Devi, into high honour. We even find indications that there weredifferences of opinion as to whether Siva or his wife was the more important.The later philosophical and mystic Saivism resolves the matter thus: the Devi isthe active sakti — i.e. , creative energy—of the spiritual Creator Siva whorests in himself, and thus she forms the link between the God and his world andworshippers. The less philosophical and more drastic followers of the god wouldon occasion solve the problem by copulating with women in cemeteries. The womanwas then the sakti of the man. Outside cemeteries also, sacral coitus and saktiplayed a more and more important part in Saivism as it was popular.As Siva was the great, divine yogin and many yogins were to be counted among hisfollowers, the practice of yoga was also influenced by the sexualisingtendencies in religious life. But the yogin did not require a corporeal woman,for since ancient times yoga was just as self-sufficient as early Buddhism,which has sometimes been termed pure yoga. \"What need have I of any outer woman?I have an inner woman within myself.\" The name of this inner woman isKun-dalini, and the yogin who practices this form of yoga imagines her as acoiled snake situated in the lowermost \"lotus-centre\" of his body, about at thelevel of the genitals. The uppermost centre is located in the brain, and thereSiva rests in himself. Between these two there are five other lotus-centres.After the physical320 FOKKE SlERKSMAand mental training indispensable to all yoga, the yogin must now concentrateall his psychical and mental forces on doing what a fakir does with a realsnake: \"arousing\" the Kundalini-snake and inducing it to stretch itself upward.He leads Kundalini upwards in such a way that she penetrates the variouslotus-centres— in authentic yoga each centre signifies a new and higher state ofconsciousness— until in the brain-centre she unites herself with her lord andconsort Siva, and the yogin attains the highest enlightenment. A psychologicalcommentary upon this matter would require a separate volume, so that here thereis only place for those few remarks strictly necessary to our purpose. A goddesswho raises herself up as a snake and pierces lotus flowers, who at the beginningand the end of her \"course\" envelops the sweet lihga of Siva with her mouth anddrinks nectar, is an evident symbol of bisexuality. As sexual symbols are notonly expressions of sexuality, but not infrequently also express structures andtrends of human nature, bisexuality equals autarky, certainly so in thisinstance, where a man consciously strives to unite nature and mind—phallus andbrain, his virility and the woman in himself—within his own body and mind. Thiswill towards autarky is also made evident in the fact, that the yogin's semen orthe power of his semen is considered to rise up and descend again transformedinto the nectar of Siva's union. The clearest proof is found in the powerobtained by the yogin, to destroy and re-create the world. For as he leadsKundalini upwards, he simultaneously demolishes the visible world step by step,so that at the union of Siva and his consort it vanishes completely. Then asKundalini is led back centre by centre— i.e., when the yogin systematicallyreturns to normal consciousness—the world is built up again. If the yogin wereto become angry, writes a commentator, he would be able to destroy all theworlds. The difference with mysticism, including Buddhist mysticism, is evident:the mystic comes to non-being or blows out like a flame, the Saiva yogin seekspower, the power of God himself. Not seldom, he imagines himself to be God. Itis significant for our subject that this God in apprehension beholds, in thevarious states of consciousness he creates, both peaceable and terrifying gods,and that the latter are the \"lords of dissolution,\" those who preside over thedestruction of the world. In this yoga both sexuality and aggressivity serve thelust of power, assuming itself capable of destroying the world and building itanew, like the great god Siva himself. This means that aggressivity dominatesover sexuality in an autism, which recognises mysticism as a danger and conquersit. Yoga and magic often go together. When the Buddha met a yogin who proudlydeclared that after many years of effort he could walk over the river, the rephwas: what a pity to spend so much effort; a little further on they will take youacross for a penny. This yoga stands between mysticism and magic, as the latterwas described in connection with the Mantrayana.The people, themselves fond of employing magic, held the yogins in high honour.Greedy for marvels, their imagination added numerous miracles to the yogins'actual achievements, and so 84 yogins became the legendary 84 Siddhas ormiracle-workers. It is significant, that both Saivism and Tantric Buddhism knewthe 84 Siddhas, and that a number of names were the same in both lists. Thisshows that for wandering yogins and their admirers and followers of that milieu,the line of dei; rcation between Buddhism and Saivism was growing faint at thattime. Other facts too point in the direction of a syncretism in whichparticularly Buddhism was the loser. The boundaries between the practices ofwandering yogins and the yogic \"communal\" rituals in these circles are often notclear either. A tantra translated by Sir John Woodroffe gives a good impressionof the spirit and practice of a community of the Saiva milieu. The symbolism isnot only sexual, but also sensual. The tantra breathes an aggressively sectarianspirit. Wine, meat, fish, parched corn and coition have a central role. Wine isvery important for the union of Siva and his partner, and the Praise of Wine,which is sung, contains the obvious and thereby rather dubious argument that itis not the quantity of wine, but its effect upon the drinker that counts. Almostcomical is the rule with regard to sexual continence: in the daytime one mustabstain, but at night one is free. Intolerance is very great. Whoever practisesa different religion is sure of death and hell, and the fierce and terrifyinggods are dancing in delight at the thought of the flesh and bones of scoffingunbelievers whom they will devour. The background of this barely sublimatedsexuality and aggressivity is evidently of a social nature. A protest againstthe caste system is clearly audible. No wonder these unfortunate outcasts seekcompensation for their sense of inferiority. The members of this church areelevated far above society and its morals. Secrets and secrecy shelter thevulnerability of this proud consciousness of self.In connection with our subject, two matters claim attention: the Terrifying Godsand the social background of such religious milieus. The terrifying aspect ofthe god Siva is the night-side of his aspect of fertility and salvation, andtogether these form the numinous unity of contrast which characterises everygreat god, though the stress laid on his demonic activity is probably due to thecontempt and enmity the Aryan rulers felt at first for the native god. InKundalinl-yoga the lords of dissolution are symbols of the power of the yoginwho can destroy the world. Though far more personal than in the case of Sivahimself, this aggressivity is yet sublimated to a very great degree, and isentirely consonant with the system of yoga engaged in. In the sect describedabove, whose members practised no more than a weak infusion of yoga, theterrifying deities are the signs of an understandable, nevertheless petty-mindedhatred. Within their own circle they practised a scantly spiritualisedsexuality, externally they ventilated a furious aggressivity. There is noquestion of any relation between these two forces in human life. One can onlythink of a hypothesis in child and adolescent psychology, according to which achild can only love certain people if it first hates others. It has to hatethese, because otherwise it would simultaneously love and hate its parents andothers, and would itself succumb in the conflict.In social respect we have here the milieu of what Max Weber called \"plebeianreligions,\" which are to be found in various complex cultures. They are thereligions of the \"underdogs,\" who cannot assert themselves and who take theirrevenge by regarding themselves as the true elite in their religion, \"far betterthan the rest.\" Among themselves they are most fraternal, linked by the samefate, and towards the outside world they are extremely aggressive, in thisinstance attacking the castes and the monks! Naturally they do not recogniserank and class, any more than the system of values of the existing social order,and this is formulated as being above good and evil. To these characteristics,studied by322 FOKKE SlERKSMAWeber and set in a wider context by Muhlmann we may add, in a word, that allthese religions are dominated by the psychology of resentment. One finds thesame thing with non-white peoples under white colonial rule: he who feelsinferior wants to eat his cake and have it, wants, for instance, to remain aPapuan and to become white, to remain outcast and to have a religion of aphilosophical tint. Much would-be philosophising in the tantras should, I think,be seen in this light. The true proportions are easily seen, when one hears thatthe tantras, which announce themselves as composed for great minds, are writtenin an abominable style.It is not yet certain how things went exactly, but everything points to it thatthis social protest, manifested in a secret religion with a strong sexualelement, also impressed a not inconsiderable part of the Mantrayana Buddhists.Though fiercely opposed by other milieus of the Mantrayana, it managed to gain awide acceptance, and so the Mantrayana was converted into the Vajrayana. TantricBuddhism, then, is a general term for this phase of Buddhism as expressed in thetantras, Mantrayana indicates more particularly the magical, and Vajrayana themagico-sexual trend. It is extremely improbable that—as Govinda and othersthink—the sexually directed magic and the sexual mysticism of the tantras shouldhave originated in Buddhist circles. Already in prehistoric times India, likemany other cultures, was acquainted with the zestful and frank adoration ofsexual symbols and mother goddesses whose sexual aspect predominated. The Aryanrulers could not in the end prevent this autochthonous religion from reassertingitself, as it did in the religions of Siva and Visnu. The social underdogsseized upon these indigenous elements to oppose the existing society and toshock it. For evident reasons, the disposition to shock was coupled with adesire for secrecy, so that in Saivism and Saktism sex and the sexual act, inthemselves capable of filling man with awe and leading him to the numinous, notinfrequently acquired a dubious character. The close connection between the tworeligions also points to a Hindu origin of saktism in the milieu concerned,while the resistance of Mantrayana circles to the Vajrayana rounds off theargument. Sexual conceptions and practices were of indigenous origin, andpenetrated into Saivism and also into that sector of Buddhism where the faithfulwere sensitive to such a form of rebellion and protest.The popularity of Saktism must have compelled the Buddhist leaders to adoptthese conceptions, if they did not want to lose their followers to their greatcompetitor, Saivism. Thus one can read in many texts of the Vajrayana thatbud-dhahood lies in the vagina. In some places the frontiers between Buddhismand Hinduism must have been very vague indeed at this time, between the seventhand eighth century a.d. The common opposition to the higher classes, to thebrahmans and to the Mahayana monks with their ritualistic and theologicalparaphernalia will certainly have carried more weight than religioussubtilities. Meanwhile Buddhism, essentially asocial, seems always to haveretained something of this character, and to have had a special attraction forthose who were asocial by necessity of choice. Only Buddhism produced Zen,profound as it is eccentric, and that comes from China, where \"mad monks\" were afamiliar phenomenon. The Vajrayana in India did not only draw its adherents fromthe lowest classes, many Vajrayana teachers were of good family, but had comedownthrough addiction to wine and women. Perhaps this asocial character—even moreasocial, for anti-hindu, than Saivism—was one of the reasons why Buddhism didnot disappear in the sexualistic dark, where all cats are gray. Another factormay have been, that particularly social underdogs fight out group rivalry in theideological field, because they simply have no other battle-ground and ideologyis their only sign of status. However this may be, the Buddhist faithful and, ortheir yogic leaders managed to keep their identity and in spite of allHinduistic intrusions they have given the Vajrayana a clear Buddhist stamp.Naturally, there was a great resemblance between these Buddhist milieus and theHinduist, particularly the Saivan circles. Not an interminable, century-longwrestling after salvation in the endless chain of reincarnation (and socialmisery!), but liberation here and now by the so-called short path was craved. Itwas not only dislike of theologians, priests and monks, but also their ownreligious \"haste\" and illiteracy, which caused these people to despise the wayof knowledge and insight and give vent to the magical desire for action in therituals. Tantrism is ritualism. The urgent, intolerable longing after liberationfound an outlet in the sexuality of Saktism. The Mahayana theory, that thebuddha-spark glows latent in every human being, formed a useful starting-pointfor the tantric thesis, that salvation and liberation are found in the body.Much stress was laid on coitus reservatus, coition without ejaculation, but inthe tantric twilight one need not have a \"dirty mind\" to suppose that there weretwo possibilities, and that many of the faithful simply did not have the timeand the capacity for strict practice of yoga. Sexually also these people adheredto the magical theory of like by like, the body was to be redeemed by the body.Samsara = Nirvana!—thus the Buddhist Tantrists. For much the greater part of thefaithful, the goal of even seriously practised yoga was not the unio mystica butimmortality, and magical power in this life was the highest good. Usually yogawas practised more as an attempt, the good intention counting more than theresult. When the Hevajra tantra enjoins \"Try it one fortnight with zeal,\" onecan hardly take this seriously, though Snellgrove does. Even an Occidental cansee that a fortnight's yoga is too much like the quick courses for this, thatand the other that are advertised nowadays. Most results are founded onauto-suggestion. The yoga of the tantric laymen should be regarded in the samelight as their conviction that they are the spiritual elite, that the badlywritten tantras are literature for highly developed minds, etc. Their jealoussecrecy alone betrays that they have stuck half-way between actual inferiorityand imagined superiority, half-way between natural sexuality and sublimatedmysticism, in ritualism and magic. This is not ridiculous or contemptible.Humanly speaking, it is saddening, almost tragic, and completely understandable,like that \"aping the white man\" of primitives who have not the possibility andthe means truly to follow him. Scientifically, however, it is a phenomenon to beobserved and stated. Very convincing are in this respect the following wordsfrom a list of tantric code-terms: passion, power, corpse, naked, ejaculation,semen, coition, brain-pan, food, faeces, urine, blood.Buddhism remained true to its anti-hinduist tradition though, and impressed itsown mark upon the new religious forms. Although the Vajrayana is such aheterogeneous collection of spells, magic, ritualism, yoga, speculation, sexual324 FOKKE SlERKSMAsymbolism and practice that it almost defies definition, they succeeded byholding fast to a few basic concepts. When the rituals were written down, thisprocess was already going on. Indeed, in the tantras one finds gross magicbeside Buddhist passages. Later on monasteries and universities produced manycommentaries in which this tantrism, which could be taken either way, wasinterpreted entirely in the spiritual and mystic sense. Although magicalelements seldom disappeared entirely, so that it is often to be defined as amysticism ofilluminati, Buddhism attained in many of these commentaries to thevery heights of religious life. For comparison, the theological and mysticalcommentaries of Christianity upon the Israelitic eroticism of the Song of Songsmay be mentioned, even if the case is not quite the same.In the first place, the concept of buddhahood was maintained and the idea, thatevery human being is to become a buddha. Even if this is ultimately a matter ofform, it yet remains evidence of deliberate continuity, which made it possiblethat also the Hinayana and the Mahayana writings were afterwards profoundlystudied in Tibet. Then they held to Voidness as the final mystery and thefoundation of all that is. Although not an original Buddhist concept, it couldfairly often come to sound like the Buddha's anatmata: the doctrine, that thereis no self and no immortal soul. How the cool Buddhist analysis could sometimesrevert to keen aggressivity, may be shown in passing by the words of a marginalfigure: the spirit which creates the illusory world in which we move, must bekilled like a rat. The concept of Voidness was particularly fitted to bringorder into the chaos of buddhas, bodhisattvas, gods, rituals and symbols,because thus this chaos was brought sub specie aeternitatis and could berecognised as essentially void—a point of view which can also be shared in thetwentieth century. Tucci very aptly uses the word gnosis for the mysticism andpseudo-mysticism of the Vajrayana. There are striking resemblances withgnosticism, as also with kabbalism, so that a comparative study might yieldinteresting results. The symbol of Voidness became the vajra, from which thisform of Buddhism derives its name. Originally the thunderbolt of the Vedic godIndra, it also appeared in Hinduism as the weapon of Siva. The Vajrayana did notsimply take over this symbol, but interpreted it anew as the pure,indestructible diamond of Voidness, so that Vajrayana is best translated as thediamond vehicle. If enlightenment was considered as the mystic union of the maleand female principle, the vajra symbolised man and penis, the lotus (in theritual also a bell) woman and vagina.Another difference is the Buddhist reinterpretation of the union with the sakti,who in Hinduism symbolised the active energy which created the phenomenal world,while the male god was regarded as the passive spiritual principle, resting initself. Now whether this mystic union was imagined as a normal copulation, or asa yogic coitus reservatus, or as the symbol of a purely spiritual mystic union,in Buddhism the sakti was not active, but passive, and did not symbolise energy,but insight, the supreme wisdom, embraced by the male as a symbol of his desirefor insight and good works. Zimmer already drew attention to thisreinterpretation, and Snellgrove and Govinda have made it quite a matter ofprinciple. Justly so indeed, for it cannot be denied that the Buddhists usuallyregarded the union of god and goddess, of man and sakti, as the union of theactive impulse towards salvation, manifested in good works and ritual actions,with the passive, quiescent knowledge or wisdom, of updya with prajnd. But theywere certainly not consistent in this respect. Bhattacharyya speaks here, forinstance, of \"Lord Mind and Lady Vacuity,\" which agrees with the reversal of theactive and passive roles, but not with the interpretation of the male ascompassion and good works. Besides, in Tibet we shall meet with interpretationsthat are closer to Saivism than to Buddhism. Altogether the concept of saktiwith its original background does not seem to have entirely disappeared. Not totrespass against the Buddhist reinterpretation of the union of compassion andwisdom, however, the sakti will henceforth be called mudrd (= seal), when awoman of flesh and blood is meant, and yum (= mother) when referring to agoddess appearing in a vision, in imagination or as a work of art.In meditation and contemplation the Buddhist also differed clearly from theSaivite. The latter felt to the last a difference and a distance between himselfand his god. In the Buddhist liturgies, the sddhanas, the worshipper identifieshimself with his god so completely, that one may really speak of identity. Herean essential piece of Buddhism proves to have been preserved. The completeindifference of the Buddha towards the gods, who are illusions like all livingbeings, has been slightly intensified under the influence of the philosophy ofVoidness and the ideas concerning the creative and destructive power of theyogin, and become a unique kind of atheism: the gods exist, in so far as mandoes not control them. The followers of the Vajrayana \"conceived of a god inknowledge of his non-existence,\" as it is formulated in the Hevajra tantra.Typical of the Buddhism of those who adhered to the diamond vehicle was also thecreation of new gods. The Hevajra already referred to is simply the hypostasisof an invocation, upon the principle oinomina numina: he vajra. But the scalewas turned by their god Yamantaka, who conquered the Hindu god of death Yama,and took his place. Nothing affords better proof of their withdrawal from andhatred of Hinduism, including Saivism, than the liquidation and completenegation of no one less than the god of death, known and feared by all Hindus.Just as the visualising of a god in knowledge of his non-existence determinesthe Buddhist character of the Vajrayana from the religious aspect, so thatcharacter is sharply underlined in a social respect by Yamantaka's liquidationof Yama, who for centuries had ruled as king of the dead, in the Vedic religion,in Hinduism, in Hinayana and Mahayana, with the particular function of judgingthe dead and inexorably, but justly, determining their next rebirth.Finally, mention must be made of the work of the theologians. They not onlyinterpreted the sexual and other material symbols and practices mystically in agnostic fashion—for instance, coition is mystic union, killing an enemy iskilling the illusion of the self, one's mother or sister as mudra meansdifferent levels of truth—in their great and flourishing universities they alsointroduced a systematic order into the continually increasing pantheon ofbuddhas, bodhisat-tvas and gods who do not exist, but are real in man as long ashe has not transcended himself and thereby the gods. At the head of the fivefamilies, to which the gods had been assigned, stood Vajradhara or Vajrasattva,who is Voidness. The326 FOKKE SlERKSMAheads of the five separate families, which correspond to the five components ofthe human body, are the buddhas Vairocana, Aksobhya, Ratnasambhava, Am-itabha,and Amoghasiddhi. In view of the subject of this book, Aksobhya calls forparticular attention, for his family includes all the terrifying deities (withone exception), and his bodhisattva is Vajrapani. His family is that of thevajra, its colour is blue, the sin assigned to this family and which can beconquered by it is wrath, and the corresponding component of the body isconsciousness. These associations will be considered later, for the moment wemay point out that, entirely in agreement with the spirit of ancient Buddhism,they are rather of a psychological than of a theological nature. It is at onceevident, that e.g., the correspondence between components of the body and godsadmits of a theory of religious projection, and a mystic way whereby insight canbe gained with regard to the non-entity of both body and gods, and theinexpressible Voidness realised. As it is not possible to give a complete sketchof the Vajrayana, it will be best to close the chapter with a concrete example,which may convey more than a too summary and too abstract expose. InSnellgrove's translation of the Hevajra tan-tra, much praised by specialists,there is a passage which sounds emotional. Here the author of this mostimportant tantra seems to let himself go for a moment, and as people often saymore in such a sally than in collected argument, this passage may perhaps bemore typical than others. The god Hevajra himself speaks, in part, as follows:\"Without bodily form how should there be bliss? Of bliss one could not speak.The world is pervaded by bliss, which pervades and is itself pervaded. Just asthe perfume of a flower depends upon the flower, and without the flower becomesimpossible, likewise without form and so on, bliss would not be perceived. I amexistence, I am non-existence, I am the Enlightened One for I am enlightenedconcerning what things are. But me they do not know, those fools, afflicted byindolence. I dwell in the Sukhavati, in the vagina of the Vajra Woman, in thatplace which is symbolized by the syllable E, in that casket of buddha-gems. I amthe teacher, and I am the doctrine, I am the disciple endowed with goodqualities. I am the goal, and I am the trainer. I am in the world andsupramundane. My nature is that of Innate Joy and I come at the end of the Joythat is Perfect and at the beginning of the Joy of Cessation. So be assured, myson, it is like a lamp in darkness. I am the Master with the thirty-two marks,the Lord with the eighty characteristics and I dwell in the Sukhavati, in thevagina of the female in the name of semen. Without it—the semen—there is nobliss and again without bliss it—the semen—cannot be. Since they are ineffectiveone without th c other, bliss is found in union with the divinity. So theEnlightened One is neither existence nor non-existence; he has a form with armsand faces and yet in highest bliss is formless. So the whole world is theInnate, for the Innate is its essence. Its essence too is nirvana when the mindis in a purified state. The divine form consists of just something born, for itis a repository of arms and faces and colours, and moreover arises by the normalinfluence of past actions. With the very poison, a little of which would killany other being, a man who understands poison would dispell another poison. Justas a man who suffers with flatulence is given beans to eat, so that wind mayovercome wind in the way of a homeopathic cure, so existence is purified byexistence in the countering ofdiscursive thought by its own kind. Just as water entered in the ear is drawnout again by water, so also the notion of existing things is purified byappearances. Just as those who have been burned by fire must suffer again byfire, so those who have been burned by the fire of passion must suffer the fireof passion. Those things by which men of evil conduct are bound, others turninto means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion theworld is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical buddhists thispractice of reversals is not known.\"This mystical-seeming pantheism of the body, which for a moment appears apantheism of the semen, makes the impression of a medley of sexuality—of arather drastic kind in a religious context—, philosophical speculation andcomparisons which are clear, but not always delicate. The aggressive sallyagainst the fools who understand nothing of this religious homoeopathy, ischaracteristic, also in that it is directed against heretical buddhists.Heretics are of course always the others. It is rather piquant, that the latercommentators always use the term \"fools\" for those who take the tantrasliterally, whilst here it is those who do not do so, who are called fools. Forthough a mystical interpretation is certainly possible—one need only think ofthe commentaries on the Song of Songs— there can be little doubt that here it isthe redemption of the body by the body that is preached, and in a high strain.Without the body there is no bliss and, to be exact, this bliss depends on thesemen. The world is pervaded by bliss and the god himself is this world. Thenature and the essence of the god is the innate joy, which comes at the end ofthe joy that is perfect, and at the beginning of the joy of cessation. Thereader who might find the essential nature of this god obscure, will easilyunderstand the sequence 1) joy, 2) perfect joy, 3) innate joy and 4) joy ofcessation, if he considers that it is an analysis of cohabitation as experiencedby the male. The commentators interpret these four phases as four yogicconditions of consciousness. They have a perfect right to do so, all the more asthey do it subtly and consistently. But it is clear that tantrism is a verydifferent thing in its origin and in its mystical re-interpretation, and thatthe tantras, which themselves already make the impression of having been workedover, do indeed offer an ambiguous choice. To speak with Snellgrove: it wasindeed the razor's edge.If we turn off the flood-lights of the commentaries, then Hevajra stands beforeus in this tantra as a tight-rope dancer who slips more than once, and that onthe carnal side of his rope. To take an instance, there is his description of afair mudra, whose charms include a sweet breath and whose pudenda are fragrantas lotus flowers, who is calm and resolute and delightful, and his comment onthis description: \"By vulgar men, indeed, she would be classed as first-rank.\"The fact that the thought can arise, how vulgar men would judge of the beautifulwoman destined for the ritual, is somewhat curious. Many a man will prefersimply to be vulgar in this respect. In the part called the Manifestation ofHevajra, he sinks into the bliss of union with his beloved, whereupon the othergoddesses of his court begin calling on him to arise. One of them cries:\"Embrace me in the union of great bliss, and abandon the condition of Voidness.\"Even if we leave a very wide margin for the secret language of mysticism, no onefamiliar with it will believe in this polygamous mysticism, which is a mereprojection of328 FOKKE SlERKSMAthe ritual celebrated by a yogin who is provided with a number of so-calledtantric assistants. As this tantra also contains directions for a magical riteto gain the favours of a woman, we may with good reason suppose this yoga tocarry an uneasy conscience. What is propagated here, is actually a copulatingform of religion, either factual or imaginary. The only condition ispurification of the spirit. In view of the very sensebound symbolism and magic,it is to be supposed that in most cases this purity was rather a matter ofintention than of fact. The Hevajra tantra is too much impregnated with ranklingresentment, sensuous-ness and sensuality, to give credit to a high level ofsublimation. In such cases a secret language is not a sign of profundity, but ofambiguousness.That there can be no question of mysticism, not even of spurious mysticism orauthentic yoga, becomes apparent when Hevajra awakens from his sweet slumber inthe lap of Nairatmya. For then he plants his feet firmly on the ground, andthreatens gods and titans in a terrible way, quite without provocation.Mysticism seeks permanent liberation from the self, Hevajra uses sex andaggressivity for the unbounded inflation of his self, in line with the I, I, I,in the quotation given above, This aggressivity is a mixture of the quick angeroften manifested by the yogins, so easily offended because their appetite forpower is never sate, and the rankling resentment felt by social underdogs, asthe tantric Buddhists originally were. Some fortnight's practice of yoga by thefaithful will probably have caused both factors to coalesce. It must have beensatisfying for outcasts to be able to say: \"One is oneself the Destroyer, theCreator, the King, the Lord.\" Psychologically, this aggressive urge to power isincompatible with sexuality and love, in and outside mysticism. Division andunion, destruction and synthesis, maintaining and losing the self, magic andmysticism are unlinked and irreconcilable opposites here. While the Buddhataught, that affective ties with the phenomenal world must be cut, to becomefree from the illusion of the self, the voluptuous enjoyment of power and sexalternate here, making the ties with the world as thick as cables in magic ofmystic pretension, and inflating the ego till it becomes the Lord of Creationhimself. So when Hevajra says he is black and terrible, but that peace rules inhis heart, one simply does not believe him. One would like to know whether themystic commentators refer to this, and if so what they said, but most of theirwork is still unpublished and untranslated. Govinda says the true Buddhist doesnot seek power, and then Hevajra is a deplorable Buddhist. If Buddhismmaintained its identity in essential points, this was not the case in allpoints. Siva, the great destroyer and re-creator, had more influence on Hevrjraand his followers in point of mysticism than the Buddha. It was necessary to gointo this matter, for it was figures like this Hevajra who brought Buddhism toTibet, figures like one of the 84 Siddhas, who \"makes butter with his sakti,\"and who flamed into anger like their Terrifying Gods. If the reader,unaccustomed to such material, should be confused by the pluriform content ofthis chapter, he will at any rate sympathise with the farmers and herdsmen ofTibet, who also had to work through this strange, bizarre world. To put it quitesimply, the Tibetans must have been pretty much taken aback, when yogins of theHevajra type came to preach a new religion to them, a religion in whichcomplicated theories justified mens vagrancy in company with women,and explained as representative of a higher order the commerce of the sexes,which the Tibetans had regarded as belonging to the natural human and animalworld (several sexual words in their language refer to humans and animals both,as seems perfectly natural to any herdsman or farmer). Tibet did not easily givein. And afterwards, when the Vajrayana had gained currency there, it was foundthat the Tibetans had resolved many dubious matters into their component partsby realistic analysis. However many complications the process of acculturationcaused, one's general impression is, that the cool and realistic outlook inTibet at any rate considerably desexualised the Vajrayana. Tibet was inclined tocall a spade a spade, and to set limits. Much was to happen, however, beforethis was attained.Unit XFrom Darkness to Light: The Mystery Religion of Ancient GreeceThe BacchaeEURIPIDESEuripides (480-406 b.c.e.) wrote Prometheus Bound, The Trojan Women and TheBacchae. Reprinted here is the last section of The Bacchae in which Pentheusplots the disruption of Dionysus's rituals and Dionysus plots his revenge onPentheus. This selection offers a good glimpse of the Bacchic orgies themselvesas well as the attitudes of many of the characters toward the mysterious rites.DIONYSUS: Women! this man is in our net; he goes To find his just doom 'mid theBacchanals. Dionysus, to thy work! thou'rt not far off; Vengeance is ours.Bereave him first of sense; Yet be his frenzy slight. In his right mind He neverhad put on a woman's dress; But now, thus shaken in his mind, he'll wear it. Alaughing-stock I'll make him to all Thebes, Led in a woman's dress through thewide city, For those fierce threats in which he was so great. But I must go, andPentheus—in the garb Which wearing, even by his own mother's hand Slain, he goesdown to Hades. Know he must Dionysus, son of Zeus, among the gods Mightiest, yetmildest to the sons of men.StropheCHORUS: O when, through the long night,With fleet foot glancing white, Shall I go dancing in my revelry,My neck cast back, and bareUnto the dewy air, Like sportive fawn in the green meadow's glee?Lo, in her fear she springsOver th' encircling rings, Over the well-woven nets far off and fast;While swift along her trackThe huntsman cheers his pack, With panting toil, and fiery storm-wind haste.Where down the river-bank spreads the wide meadow,Rejoices she in the untrod solitude. Couches at length beneath the silent shadowOf the old hospitable wood.What is wisest? what is fairest, Of god's boons to man the rarest? With theconscious conquering hand Above the foeman's head to stand. What is faireststill is dearest.AntistropheSlow come, but come at length,In their majestic strength, Faithful and true, the avenging deities:And chastening human folly,And the mad pride unholy, Of those who to the gods bow not their knees.For hidden still and mute,As glides their printless foot, The impious on their winding path they hound.For it is ill to know,And it is ill to do, Beyond the law's inexorable bound. 'Tis but light cost inhis own power sublimeTo array the godhead, whoso'er he be; And law is old, even as the oldest time,Nature's own unrepealed decree.What is wisest? what is fairest, Of god's boons to man the rarest? With theconscious conquering hand Above the foeman's head to stand. What is faireststill is rarest.EpodeWho hath 'scaped the turbulent sea, And reached the haven, happy he! Happy hewhose toils are o'er, In the race of wealth and power! This one here, and thatone there, Passes by, and everywhere Still expectant thousands over Thousandhopes are seen to hover. Some to mortals end in bliss;Some have already fled away: Happiness alone is hisThat happy is to-day. DIONYSUS: Thou art mad to see that which thou shouldst notsee. And covetous of that thou shouldst not covet.Pentheus! I say, come forth! Appear before me, Clothed in the Bacchic Maenads'womanly dress; Spy on thy mother and her holy crew, Come like in form to one ofCadmus' daughters.(Enter pentheus.)pentheus: Ha! now indeed two suns I seem to see, A double Thebes, twoseven-gated cities; Thou, as a bull, seemest to go before me, And horns havegrown upon thine head. Art thou A beast indeed? Thou seem'st a very bull.DIONYSUS: The god is with us; unpropitious once, But now at truce: now seestthou what thou shouldst see?PENTHEUS: What see I?

There was a rock-walled glen, watered by astreamlet, And shadowed o'er with pines; the Maenads there Sate, all their handsbusy with pleasant toil; And some the leafy thyrsus, that its ivy Had droppedaway, were garlanding anew; Like fillies some, unharnessed from the yoke;Chanted alternate all the Bacchic hymn. Ill-fated Pentheus, as he scarce couldsee That womanly troop, spake thus: \"Where we stand, stranger, We see not wellthe unseemly Maenad dance: But mounting on a bank, or a tall tree, Clearly shallI behold their deeds of shame.\"A wonder then I saw that stranger do. He seized an ash-tree's highheaven-reaching stem, And dragged it down, dragged, dragged to the low earth;And like a bow it bent. As a curved wheel Becomes a circle in the turner'slathe, The stranger thus that mountain tree bent down To the earth, a deed ofmore than mortal strength. Then seating Pentheus on those ash-tree boughs,Upward he let it rise, steadily, gently Through his hands, careful lest it shakehim off; And slowly rose it upright to its height, Bearing my master seated onits ridge.There was he seen, rather than saw the Maenads,More visible he could not be, seated aloft.The stranger from our view had vanished quite.Then from the heavens a voice, as it should seemDionysus, shouted loud, \"Behold! I bring,O maidens, him that you and me, our rites,Our orgies laughed to scorn; now take your vengeance.And as he spake, a light of holy fireStood up, and blazed from earth straight up to heaven.Silent the air, silent the verdant groveHeld its still leaves; no sound of living thing.They, as their ears just caught the half-heard voice,Stood up erect, and rolled their wondering eyes.Again he shouted. But when Cadmus' daughtersHeard manifest the gods awakening voice,Forth rushed they, fleeter than the winged dove,Their nimble feet quick coursing up and down.Agave first, his mother, then her kin,The Maenads, down the torrent's bed, in the grove,From crag to crag they leaped, mad with the god.And first with heavy stones they hurled at him,Climbing a rock in front; the branches someOf the ash-tree darted; some like javelinsSent their sharp thyrsi through the sounding air,Pentheus their mark: but yet they struck him not;His height still baffled all their eager wrath.There sat the wretch, helpless in his despair.The oaken boughs, by lightning as struck off,Roots torn from the earth, but with no iron wedge,They hurled, but their wild labours all were vain.Agave spake, \"Come all, and stand around,And grasp the tree, ye Maenads; soon we will seizeThe beast that rides thereon. He will ne'er betrayThe mysteries of our god.\" A thousand handsWere on the ash, and tore it from the earth:And he that sat aloft, down, headlong, downFell to the ground, with thousand piteous shrieks,Pentheus, for well he knew his end was near.His mother first began the sacrifice,And fell on him. His bonnet from his hairHe threw, that she might know and so not slay him,The sad Agave. And he said, her cheekFondling, \"I am thy child, thine own, my mother!Pentheus, whom in Echion's house you bare.Have mercy on me, mother! For his sins,Whatever be his sins, kill not thy son.\"She, foaming at the mouth, her rolling eyeballs Whirling around, in herunreasoning reason, By Bacchus all possessed, knew, heeded not. She caught himin her arms, seized his right hand, And, with her feet set on his shrinkingside, Tore out the shoulder—not with her own strength: The god made easy thattoo cruel deed. And Ino laboured on the other side, Rending the flesh: Autonoe,all the rest, Pressed fiercely on, and there was one wild din— He groaning deep,while he had breath to groan, They shouting triumph; and one bore an arm, One astill-sandalled foot; and both his sides Lay open, rent. Each in her bloody handTossed wildly to and fro lost Pentheus' limbs. The trunk lay far aloof, neaththe rough rocks Part, part amid the forest's thick-strewn leaves, Not easy to befound. The wretched head, Which the mad mother, seizing in her hands, Had on athyrsus fixed, she bore aloft All o'er Cithaeron, as a mountain lion's, Leadingher sisters in their Maenad dance. And she comes vaunting her ill-fated chaseUnto these walls, invoking Bacchus still, Her fellow-hunter, partner in herprey, Her triumph—triumph soon to end in tears! I fled the sight of that darktragedy, Hastening, ere yet Agave reached the palace. Oh! to be reverent, toadore the gods, This is the noblest, wisest course of man, Taking dread warningfrom this dire event.(Exit MESSENGER.)CHORUS: Dance and sing In Bacchic ring, Shout, shout the fate, the fate ofgloom, Of Pentheus, from the dragon born; He the woman's garb hath worn,Following the bull, the harbinger, that led him to his doom. O ye ThebanBacchanals! Attune ye now the hymn victorious,The hymn all glorious, To the tear, and to the groan!O game of glory! To bathe the hands besprent and gory, In the blood of her ownson.But I behold Agave, Pentheus' mother Nearing the palace with distorted eyes Hailwe the ovation of the Evian god.(Enter agave, mad, bearing Pentheus' head.)agave: O ye Asian Bacchanals! CHORUS: Who is she on us who calls? agave: Fromthe mountains, lo! we bear To the palace gateOur new-slain quarry fair.

Go ye, and make your boast, Trusting to the spear-maker's uselesscraft: We with these hands have ta'en our prey, and rent The mangled limbs ofthis grim beast asunder.Where is mine aged sire? Let him draw near! And where is my son Pentheus? Lethim mount On the broad stairs that rise before our house; And on the triglyphnail this lion's head, That I have brought him from our splendid chase.(Enter cadmus and attendants, with Pentheus' body.)CADMUS: Follow me, follow, bearing your sad burden, My servants—Pentheus'body—to our house; The body that with long and weary search I found at length inlone Cithaeron's glens; Thus torn, not lying in one place, but wide Scatteredamid the dark and tangled thicket. Already, as I entered in the city With oldTeiresias, from the Bacchanals, I heard the fearful doings of my daughter.

Justly—too justly, hath King Bromius Destroyed us, fatal kindred to ourhouse.agave: Oh! how morose is man in his old age, And sullen in his mien. Oh! were myson More like his mother, mighty in his hunting, When he goes forth among theyouth of Thebes Wild beasts to chase! But he is great alone, In warring on thegods. We two, my sire, Must counsel him against his evil wisdom. Where is he?Who will call him here before us That he may see me in my happiness?CADMUS: Woe! woe!

Appears there not a change?AGAVE: Tis brighter, more translucent than before.Cadmus: Is there the same elation in thy soul?AGAVE: I know not what thou mean'st; but I become Conscious—my mind is settlingdown.CADMUS: Canst thou attend, and plainly answer me?agave: I have forgotten, father, all I said.CADMUS: Unto whose bed wert thou in wedlock given?agave: Echion's, him they call the Dragon-born.CADMUS: Who was the son to thy husband thou didst bear?agave: Pentheus, in commerce twixt his sire and me.CADMUS: And whose the head thou holdest in thy hands?agave: A lion's; thus my fellow-hunters said.CADMUS: Look at it straight: to look on't is no toil.agave: What see I?

Late I learn it.CADMUS: Mocked with dread mockery; no god ye held him.AGAVE: Father! Where's the dear body of my son?CADMUS: I bear it here, not found without much toil.agave: Are all the limbs together, sound and whole? And Pentheus, shared he inmy desperate fury?CADMUS: Like thee he was, he worshiped not the god. All, therefore, are en wraptin one dread doom. You, he, in whom hath perished all our house, And I who,childless of male offspring, see This single fruit—O miserable!—of thy womb Thusshamefully, thus lamentably dead— Thy son, to whom our house looked up, the stayOf all our palace he, my daughter's son, The awe of the whole city. None woulddare Insult the old man when thy fearful face He saw, well knowing he would paythe penalty. Unhonoured now, I am driven from out mine home; Cadmus the great,who all the race of Thebes Sowed in the earth, and reaped that harvest fair. Obest beloved of men, thou art now no more, Yet still art dearest of my childrenthou! No more, this grey beard fonding with thine hand, Wilt call me thine owngrandsire, thou sweet child, And fold me round and say, \"Who doth not honourthee? Old man, who troubles or afflicts thine heart? Tell me, that I may vengethy wrong, my father!\" Now wretchedest of men am I. Thou pitiable— More pitiablethy mother—sad thy kin.0 if there be who scorneth the great gods,Gaze on this death, and know that there are gods.CHORUS: Cadmus, I grieve for thee. Thy daughter's son Hath his just doom—just,but most piteous.agave: Father, thou seest how all is changed with me:1 am no more the Maenad dancing blithe,I am but the feeble, fond, and desolate mother. I know, I see—ah, knowledge bestunknown! Sight best unseen!—I see, I know my son, Mine only son!—alas! no moremy son. O beauteous limbs, that in my womb I bare! O head, that on my lap wastwont to sleep! O lips, that from my bosom's swelling fountDrained the delicious and soft-oozing milk!O hands, whose first use was to fondle me!O feet, that were so light to run to me!O gracious form, that men wondering beheld!O haughty brow, before which Thebes bowed down!O majesty! O strength! by mine own hands—By mine own murderous, sacrilegious hands—Torn, rent asunder, scattered, cast abroad!O thou hard god! was there no other wayTo visit us? Oh! if the son must die,Must it be by the hand of his own mother?If the impious mother must atone her sin,Must it be but by murdering her own son?Mysteries and AsceticismWALTER BURKERTWalter Burkert is a renowned scholar of the classics. In this selection, Burkertdiscusses the general background of Greek mystery religions and then turns hisattention to the particular mysteries ofEleusis, Bacchus, Orpheus, andPythagoras. Burkert emphasizes the individual aspect of the mysteries.MYSTERY SANCTUARIESGeneral ConsiderationsV^reek religion, bound to the polis, is public religion to an extreme degree.Sacrificial processions and communal meals, loud prayers and vows, templesvisible from afar with splendid votive displays—this is the image of euseheia,this guarantees the integration of the individual into the community. Whoeverrefuses to take part incurs suspicions of aseheia. Yet at the same time therewere always secret cults, accessible only through some special, individualinitiation, the mysteries. In Greek to initiate is myein or else telein, theinitiate is called mystes, and the whole proceedings mysteria, while telesterionis the special building where initiations take place. The ceremony can also becalled telete, but this word is also used for religious celebrations generally.Orgia too is a word for ritual which is used especially for mysteries: tocelebrate in exaltation, having been transformed to a higher status byinitiation, is orgiazein. Most famous and best known, were the mysteries ofEleusis; for the Athenians the Eleusinianfestival was quite simply ta mysteria. But this evidently was just the mostprominent exemplar of a widespread class of similar institutions.Secrecy was radical, though it remained an open question whether in mysteriesthe sacred was forbidden, aporrheton, or unspeakable, arrheton in an absolutesense. The image which epitomizes the mysteries is the basket closed with a lid,the cista mystica: only the initiate knows what this kiste conceals; the snakewhich curls around the kiste or protrudes from under the lid points tounspeakable terror. Pagan authors never went beyond circumspect allusions, andthe Christian writers who strove to tear off the veil of secrecy were seldomable to produce more than vague insinuations. It is by happy coincidence thatone Gnostic writer has revealed a few essential details about Eleusis.The scholar will attempt to draw tangents, as it were, around the hidden centre,making use of the totality of those allusions. First, there is the aspect ofinitiation as such. Initia is the Latin equivalent for mysteria. Secretsocieties are known from many civilizations; they all have their initiations,whereby the degree of solidarity achieved is in direct relation to the hardshipsof access. It is possible that mysteries arose from puberty initiations. InEleusis, with the exception of the \"child from the hearth,\" only adults areinitiated, and at an earlier stage access was probably limited to Atheniancitizens. Yet Greek mysteries only exist in the true sense if and insofar asinitiation is open to both sexes and also to non-citizens. Second, there is theagrarian aspect. Demeter and Dionysus are gods of important mysteries; thedrinking of the barley potion or the drinking of wine are central ceremonies.Yet to derive mysteries from agrarian magic is at best a conjecture aboutprehistory. For the Athenians as we know them, mysteries and corn stand side byside as the two gifts of Demeter; but, on the other hand, the wine festival ofthe Anthesteria or the seed magic of the Thesmophoria, the agrarian celebrationsof Proerosia or Kalamaia, are not mysteries. It may rather be asked, evenwithout the prospect of a certain answer, whether at the basis of mysteriesthere were prehistoric drug rituals, some festival of immortality which, throughthe expansion of consciousness, seemed to guarantee some psychedelic Beyond. Athird and undeniable aspect of the mysteries is the sexual aspect: genitalsymbols, exposures, and occasionally veritable orgies, in the common sense, areattested. Puberty initiation, agrarian magic, and sexuality may unite in thegreat experience of life overcoming death. Finally, there is the aspect of myth:mysteries are accompanied by tales—some of which may be secret, hieroi logoi—mostly telling of suffering gods. The mystai in turn do suffer something in theinitiation. Yet the assertion that the mystes himself suffers the fate of thegod who would thus himself be the first mystes does not hold true generally.Suffering easily goes together with the initiation aspect. Deadly terrorprovoked and dispelled in ritual can be experienced and interpreted asanticipation and overcoming of death. The concept of rebirth admittedly appearsonly in late Hellenism. In the background there appears once more the sacreddeed in general, the encounter with death in sacrifice as such. Precisely forthis reason mysteries do not constitute a separate religion outside the publicone; they represent a special opportunity for dealing with gods within themultifarious framework of polytheistic polis religion. In Crete, we are told,the very rituals which were absolutely secret in Samothrace or Eleusis wereperformed in public.That for the mystes death will lose its terror, that he gains the guarantee of ablessed life in another world, is not expressly stated in all of the mysterieswe know about, but this promise stands very much to the fore in many of them.Here the different aspects are seen to fuse with one another: the certainty oflife attained by intoxication and sexual arousal goes together with insight intothe cycle of nature. At the same time the special status attained throughinitiation is claimed to be valid even beyond death: the orgiastic festival ofthe mystai continues to be held in the afterlife. Yet if the chance ofinitiation has been let slip in this life, it is impossible to make up for theomission after death. Impressive mythical images bring home this impossibility:Oknos, hesitation personified, is an old man who sits in Hades plaiting a cordwhich his ass immediately eats away; the uninitiated are carrying water insieves up to a leaking vessel, aimlessly and endlessly.Secret societies and initiations are doubtless very ancient institutions. ANeolithic basis for the mysteries may be assumed. Both the Demeter and Di-onysosmysteries show specific relations to the ancient Anatolian Mother Goddess. Andyet that which is older than the developed polis system could also lead beyondit. The discovery of the individual is the great event that is seen to occur inGreece in the seventh and sixth centuries. Personalities such as Archilochus,Alcaeus and Sappho are the first to exhibit their self-conscious ego inliterature. The capability of individual decision and the search for privatefulfilment in life are not absent from religion either. Alongside participationin the polis festivals as fixed by the calendar there emerges the interest insomething special, chosen by oneself, and hence in additional initiations andmysteries. At the same time individual death, which is built into the system ofcommunal life as an unquestionable fact, becomes a personal problem more thanbefore; thus promises of help extending over and beyond one's own death are sureto find attentive ears. Some dynamic movement seems to enter the static systemof religion. .After 600 various mysteries are seen to arise or come into theforeground. Over and above the ancient type of clan and family initiations,special sanctuaries such as Sam-othrace and Eleusis gain increasing influence ina society becoming more and more mobile. At the same time, movements which arenot bound to established sanctuaries and their ancestral customs are seen topress even more radical claims; this is true of the Bakchika and Orphika. Theautonomy of the individual attains its peak when collective ritual is leftbehind and rules are set for a life on one's own responsibility.EleusisTheir secrecy notwithstanding, the mysteries of Eleusis are more extensivelydocumented than any other single Greek cult. This is true whether one considersthe archaeological evidence of the sanctuary buildings, the epigraphi-calevidence of sacred laws and other relevant inscriptions, the prosopography ofthe priests, the iconography of the gods and heroes, or the many reflections inliterature, both poetry and philosophy. From the earliest testimony, theEleusi-nian section of the Homeric Hyjnn to Demeter, to the proscription of thecult by Theodosius and the destruction of the sanctuary- by the Goths about 400A. D., wesurvey a period of a thousand years. During this time the cult drew men andwomen from all of Greece and later from the whole of the Roman Empire and, as isaffirmed over and over again, brought them happiness and comfort. According toDiodorus, it was the great age and the untouchable purity of the cult thatconstituted its special fame. The unique position of Athens in Greek literatureand philosophy made this fame spread everywhere.The secret which was open to thousands every year was, of course, profanedrepeatedly. Yet the sources available to us, both iconography and texts, keep tothe rule that only allusions are admitted. We are told that Demeter found andmet with her daughter in Eleusis; this is the mythical disguise of what happenedat the mysteries. Only Christian writers strove to violate the rules. Clement ofAlexandria gives the password, synthema, of the Eleusinian mystai, and a Gnosticwriter records a proclamation of the hierophant and names what was shown as thehigh point of the celebration: an ear of corn cut in silence. There is no reasonto doubt his testimony.The celebration of the mysteries was in the hands of two families, theEu-molpidai, who provide the hierophant and the Kerykes who provide the torchbearer, dadouchos, and the sacred herald, hierokeryx. In addition there is apriestess of Demeter who lives permanently in the sanctuary. The firsttele-sterion proper, the hall for initiations, was built in the time ofPisistratus on the site of a temple-like structure from the time of Solon. Thecult on the site, however, can be traced back into the Geometric Age and indeedto Mycenaean predecessors.The initiation, myesis, was an act of individual choice. Most but not allAthenians were initiated. Women, slaves, and foreigners were admitted. The firstpart of the initiation could take place at various times, either in Eleusis orat the affiliated sanctuary, the Eleusinion above the Agora of Athens. The firstact was the sacrifice of a young pig. Each mystes had to bring his piglet.According to one description the mystes took a bath in the sea together with hispiglet. He gives the animal in his stead to its death. Myth associated the deathof the pig with Persephone sinking into the earth, just as at the Thesmophoriafestival.There follows a purification ceremony for which the Homeric Hymn has Demeterherself set the example. Without speaking a word she sits down on a stool whichis covered by a ram fleece, and she veils her head. Thus reliefs show Heraclesat his initiation, veiled and sitting on a ram fleece, while either a winnowingfan is held over him or a torch is brought up close to him from beneath. Inancient interpretation this would be purification by air and by fire; for theblindfolded mystes these must be disquieting, threatening experiences. On thereliefs there follows the encounter with Demeter, Kore, and the kiste. Thisprobably points to the festival proper: \"As long as you have not reached theAnaktoron, you are not initiated.\"The synthema gives information on successive stages of the initiation rites, yetin veiled terms such as one initiate would use to another to let him know thathe has fulfilled all that is prescribed: \"I fasted, I drank from the kykeon, Itook out of the kiste, worked, placed back in the basket (kalathos) and from thebasket into the kiste\" Clement himself apparently was unable to give furtherdetails,but intimated that this must be something obscene. This has led scholars to makeguesses about genital symbols contained in kalathos and kiste. Yet there is anallusion in Theophrastus to the tools of working, of grinding corn, that earlymen \"consigned to secrecy and encountered as something sacred,\" evidently inDemeter mysteries. This indicates that mortar and pestle were hidden in thebasket, the instruments, in fact, for preparing the kykeon. This is a barleydrink, a kind of barley-groat broth seasoned with pennyroyal.There was also some tradition of the mysteries by word of mouth, explanationsprobably in the form of myths of which we know nothing. Aristotle states,however, that the important thing was not to learn anything but to suffer orexperience (pathein) and to be brought into the appropriate state of mindthrough the proceedings.The Mysteria proper are a major festival which has its fixed place in thecalendar, in the autumn month of Boedromion. The main public event is the greatprocession from Athens to Eleusis along the Sacred Way, a distance of overthirty kilometers. This took place on the 19th of Boedromion. Prior to this, onthe 14th day of the month, the \"sacred things\" had been brought from Eleusis tothe Eleusinion in Athens by the epheboi. The hierophant opened the festal periodwith the pronouncement, prorrhesis, that those \"who are not of pure hands orspeak an incomprehensible tongue\" should keep away. According to the generalinterpreatation this excluded murderers and barbarians. It is characteristic ofan archaic tradition that no mention is made of purity of heart. On the 16th ofthe month the mystai went together to the sea in the bay of Phaleron in order topurify themselves by bathing. On the 18th they remained at home, probablyobserving a fast.The procession which sets off towards Eleusis on the 19th, escorting the sacredthings which priestesses carry in closed kistai, is pervaded by a mood ofdancing, indeed almost ecstasy. The rhythmic shout Iakch' o lakche, resoundsagain and again and articulates the movement of the crowd. In this shout one candiscern the name of a divine being, Iakchos, a daimon of Demeter, as it wassaid, or rather an epithet of Dionysus, as many believed. Bundles of branchescalled bakchoi were swung to the rhythm. In 480 after the Persians had conqueredthe mainland, a Greek witnessed a cloud of dust, as if from 30,000 men, out ofwhich the Iakchos shout resounded, rising from Eleusis and moving towardsSalamis where the Greek army was stationed: the festival prevented by the warwas miraculously celebrating itself, as it were, and from it came strength andvictory to the Athenians.When the procession reached the boundary between Athens and Eleusis where therewere some small streams, a piece of grotesque buffoonery called gephyrismoi wasenacted on one of the bridges: masked figures made fun of the passing mystaiwith mockery and obscene gestures. Thus in myth Iambe or Baubo had cheered upDemeter. As soon as the stars became visible the mystai broke their fast; theappearance of the stars signals the beginning of the night which is reckoned asbelonging to the following day, the 20th of the month. .Meanwhile the processionhad arrived at the sanctuary. The temples of Artemis and Poseidon, sacrificialaltars, and a \"fountain of beautiful dances,\" Kallichoron,could all still be visited freely, but behind them lay the gateway to theprecinct which, on pain of death, no one but the initiates might enter.The gates were open to the mystai. We know that immediately beyond the entrancethere is a grotto, though this is not a great marvel of nature and hence couldscarcely have been the starting-point of the cult on the site as a whole. It wasdedicated to Pluto, Lord of the Underworld, whom the mystai thus approached. Thecelebration proper took place in the Telesterion, a quite unique kind ofbuilding. Whereas the appeal of a normal Greek temple lies primarily in itsexterior facade with the dark interior simply housing the cult image, theTelesterion is built to hold several thousand people at a time, watching as thehierophant showed the sacred things. Two classes of celebrants weredistinguished, the mystai who took part for the first time, and the epoptai,watchers, who were present for at least the second time. They saw what themystai did not yet see; perhaps the latter had to veil themselves at certainphases of the celebration. Each mystes had his mystagogos who escorted him intothe sanctuary. In the centre was the Anaktoron, a rectangular, oblong, stoneconstruction with a door at the end of one of its longer sides; there the throneof the hierophant was placed. He alone might pass through the door into theinterior of this building. The Anaktoron remained unmoved throughout the variousphases of the construction of the temple and initiation halls; a piece ofnatural unhewn rock was left exposed inside. There was no true entrance to thenether world, no chasm, no possibility of acting out a journey into theunderworld. The great fire under which the hierophant would officiate obviouslyburned on top of the Anaktoron. Accordingly the roof of the Telesterion had akind of skylight, opaion, as an outlet for the smoke. Thus the Anaktoronproperly belongs in the class of altars with pit chambers, and it may also becompared to the megaron of Lykosoura: Even at Eleusis the mysteries wereprobably celebrated in the open air around a fire, before the buildingactivities of the Solonian and Pisistratean epoch.Darkness shrouded the crowd thronged in the hall of mysteries as the priestsproceeded to officiate by torchlight. Dreadful, terrifying things were shownuntil finally a great light shone forth \"when the Anaktoron was opened\" and thehierophant \"appeared from out of the Anaktoron in the radiant nights of themysteries.\" We do not know the true course of events and have difficulty inco-ordinating the various allusions. Was there a sacred marriage of hierophantand priestess? In myth, Demeter places the son of the king of Eleusis into thefire on the hearth, so that the horrified mother is led to believe that thechild is being burned, whereas the goddess is actually bestowing immortality onthe child. In ritual, one child, pais, is always initiated from the hearth, arole which was regarded as a great distinction. A badly damaged relief showsDemeter sitting enthroned while beside her two figures hold out torches towardsa cowering child. Apotheosis by fire seems to be indicated; what is present isdestruction. In ritual animals were probably killed and burned, with certainmanipulations of the sacrificial remains.Yet it was not terror, but the assurance of blessing that had to prevail. Theblessings of the mysteries are expressed in three ways. The mystes sees Kore,who is called up by the hierophant by strokes of a gong; as the underworld opensup, terror gives way to the joy of reunion. Then the hierophant announces adivine birth: \"The Mistress has given birth to a sacred boy, Brimo the Brimos.\"Finally, he displays the ear of corn cut in silence. The question as to who theboy was and who his mother was seems to have been answered in different ways:either Iakchos-Dionysos, son of Persephone, or Plutos, Wealth, son of Demeter.Wealth proper is the produce of the corn harvest that banishes poverty andhunger. Vase paintings from the fourth century show a boy with a horn of plentybetween the Eleusinian goddesses, surrounded in one case by sprouting cornears—Plutos personified. The child can easily be identified with the ear ofcorn, yet cutting or mowing has a further association, that of castration.Growing, thriving, blossoming is brought to a halt with the cutting of theharvester's sickle; and yet in the ear of corn cut down there lies the force fornew life.Further festal activities surround the celebration of the mysteries, dances, anda great bull sacrifice which the epheboi execute in the court of the sanctuaryand which surely provides a rich meal, as in Andania. Finally, two specialvessels, plemochoai, are filled and poured out, one towards the west, the othertowards the east, while people, looking up to the sky, shout \"rain!\" and,looking down to the earth, \"conceive!\" In Greek this is a magical rhyme, hye —kye. Perhaps there were dances across the Rharian field where according to myththe first corn grew.What, in the tribal mysteries and in the case of the gods of Samothrace, isperhaps implied but not explicitly stated becomes the true and universal claimof Eleusis: the mysteries, taking from death its terror, are the guarantee of abetter fate in the afterworld. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter, Pindar, andSophocles all leave no doubt about this. The words of the Hymn are \"blessed ishe who has seen this among earthly men; but he who is unitiated in the sacredrites and who has no portion, never has the same lot once dead down in the murkydark.\" Pindar says \"Blessed is he who has seen this and thus goes beneath theearth; he knows the end of life, he knows the beginning given by Zeus,\" andSophocles: \"Thrice blessed are those mortals who have seen these rites and thusenter into Hades: for them alone there is life, for the others all is misery.\"In the prose of Isocrates, this becomes the statement that the mystai \"have morepleasing hopes for the end of life and for all eternity.\" Simply butemphatically the same message is repeated on the funeral inscription of ahierophant of the Imperial Age: he had shown to the mystai \"that death is not anevil but something good.\"The formula thrice blessed must have been part of the Eleusinian liturgy. Whenceit could draw its force of conviction remains a mystery to us. If there was adoctrine or myth of Eleusis on which this faith was explicitly based it has beenlost. The images of a blessed afterworld that appear in literature, thesymposium of the hosioi and a gentle sun shining in the underworld, are notspecifically Eleusinian, but elaborations in narrative and poetry of quitedifferent levels and without any official authority. Alongside there was thetradition; which Athenians assiduously spread, that Demeter had given corn tomankind and thus founded civilization at Eleusis. The pictures of Triptolemossetting out in his winged chariot to bestow Demeter's gift on the entire worldbegin in the middle of the sixth century. The Athenians were bold enough todemand officially that first fruit offerings from the whole world be sent toEleusis. Thus the importanceof Eleusis seems to be transposed to this world, but it is not exhausted in it.There are conjectures about shocking events behind the secret, notably orgiesand drugs. Yet precisely the analogy of the Indo-Iranian drug ritual, theSoma/Haoma festival shows that a ritual can persist when the original drug haslong been forgotten and replaced by harmless substances. Perhaps the night ofthe mysteries was not so very different from an Orthodox Easter festival or aWestern Christmas. It is remarkable that the concept of immortality is nevermentioned in connection with Eleusis. Death remains a reality, even if it is notan absolute end, but at the same time a new beginning. There is another kind oflife, and this, at all events, is good. Attention has been drawn to the sayingfrom St. John's Gospel that a grain of wheat must die if it is to bring forthfruit. For \"from the dead comes nourishment and growth and seeds.\" The ear ofcorn cut and shown by the hierophant can be understood in this way. Euripideshas one character in his play Hypsipyle comment on the death of a child in thesewords: \"One buries children, one gains new children, one dies oneself; and thismen take heavily, carrying earth to earth. But it is necessary to harvest lifelike a fruit-bearing ear of corn, and that the one be, the other not.\" This maybe seen as a deeper level of worldly piety than that attained by vows andsacrifice in normal, self-interested eusebeia.Bacchic MysteriesThe cult of Dionysos is very ancient in Greece, and yet it is seen to be in aprocess of continual change. It is no coincidence that outburst and revolutionbelong to the very essence of this god. Revolutionary innovations can bediscerned from the middle of the seventh century. Archilochus, who boasts how hecan strike up the dithyrambos for Lord Dionysos, is made in legend the founderof Dionysiac phallic processions. About 600, burlesque scenes set in anatmosphere of Dionysian revelry spread like wildfire in Corinthian vasepainting, Fat Dancers, whose mummery suggests a grotesque nakedness, are showndancing, drinking wine, and playing all sorts of tricks. According to traditionit was Arion who at just this time invented the dithyrambos in Corinth. We knowthat in Corinth the family clan of the Bacchiadai, who traced their ancestryback to Dionysos himself, was overthrown in the same period by the tyrantKypselos who was succeeded by his son Periandros. Accordingly, a new and popularform fitted to the milieu of craftsmen, seems to have taken the place of theold, gentili-cial Dionysos cult. Almost simultaneously the tyrant Cleisthenes ofSikyon developed the cult of Dionysos at the expense of a traditional cult ofAdrastos. The Athenian innovations in the age of the tyrants followed shortlyafterwards—the Great Dionysia with the dithyrambos, the tragodoi of Thespis andthe satyroi of Pratinas of Phleius, that is, tragedy and the satyr play. Around530/20 the iconography of the Dionysiac thiasos with satyrs and maenads achievedits fixed, canonical form, while dithyramb and tragedy became part of highliterature. Behind these innovations there is clearly an impulse directedagainst the nobility, which comes from the lower classes of craftsmen andpeasants from whom the tyrants drew their support.Societies of raving women, maenads, and thyiades, are no doubt also veryancient, even if direct evidence is available only from later periods. Theybreakout of the confines of their women's quarters and make their way to themountain. Characteristically the social roles are fixed, as is the calendar: thewomen of a given city rave at a given time, at the annual festival of Agrioniaor Lenaia, which often gives its name to the month—there is also a month Thyiosin some calendars—or else they rave every second year at the trieteric festival.True ecstasy, though, remains incalculable: \"the narthex bearers are many, thebak-choi are few.\"Dionysos is the god of the exceptional. As the individual gains in independence,the Dionysos cult becomes a vehicle for the separation of private groups fromthe polis. Alongside public Dionysiac festivals there emerge private Dionysosmysteries. These are esoteric, they take place at night; access is through anindividual initiation, telete. As a symbolic Beyond, closed and mysterious, theBacchic grotto or cave appears. The role of the sexes becomes less important:there are male as well as female mystai. In contrast to the mysteries of Demeterand the Great Gods, these mysteries are no longer bound to a fixed sanctuarywith priesthoods linked to resident families; they make their appearancewherever adherents can be found. This presupposes a new social phenomenon ofwandering priests who lay claim to a tradition of orgia transmitted in privatesuccession.The oldest testimony to bakchoi and mystai is in Heraclitus; Herodotus'description of the fate of the hellenized Scythian King Skyles refers to themiddle of the fifth century: in the Greek city of Olbia, Skyles had himselfinitiated (telein) \"to Dionysos Bakcheios\" at his own wish, even though a divinesign should have warned him against it \"as he was on the point of taking uponhimself the initiation (telete).\" He \"completed the initiation'' and proceededto rave through town with the thiasos of the god. Scythians observed him doingthis, and it cost him his throne and his life. Here Bacchic initiations areneither a spontaneous outburst nor a public festival; admission rests onpersonal application, there is a preparatory period, a tradition of sacredrites, and finally the integration into the group of the initiates. A man, aforeigner no less, is admitted for initiation.Herodotus, who with this story directs some scarcely concealed criticism againsta cult he knows, expressly refers to Miletus as the mother city of Olbia. Thesame cult of Dionysos Baccheios appears in a third-century inscription fromMiletus. Both men and women, we learn, are initiated, but the initiations shouldbe undertaken separately for each sex by priests and priestesses respectively.Omophagy, the eating c-f raw flesh, which in myth appears as the gruesome highpoint of Dionysiac frenzy, is mentioned. Oreibasia, the procession to themountain, is also attested in Miletus. The polis asserts its precedence in thatno one is allowed to make sacrifice before the polis.Euripides in his Bacchae is dramatizing the old myth which has all the women ofthe city spontaneously overcome by the god. And yet he also has men going to themountain, and the leader of the thiasos is a man—in reality, as the spectatorsknow, the god Dionysos in person. This man boasts of having received the orgiafrom the god himself. His duty is to show them and to pass them on. This processis secret; nothing of it may be divulged to someone who does not present himselfto the bakcheia. Even the advantage to be gained, which attractsthe initiates, remains secret. The celebrations are nocturnal. Here, therefore,the mythical uprising of the women overlaps with the practice of secretcelebrations indifferent to sex and resting on personal initiation. To theseBacchic mysteries belongs a blessing rivalling Eleusis: \"O blessed he who knowsthe initiations of the gods.\"For Plato, finally, Dionysos is master of the telestic madness which is to bedistinguished from prophetic, musical, and erotic-philosophical madness. The godacts through purifications (katharmoi) and initiations (teletai), bringingrelease from \"illness and grievous affliction\" which manifest themselves in afamily on account of an ancient wrath. One must surrender to the madness andallow oneself to be seized by the god in order to become free and well, not onlyfor the present but for all the future.Dionysiac initiation is fulfilled in raving, baccheia. The initiate is turnedinto a bacchos. This state of frenzy is blessedness, compellingly expressed inthe entrance song of Euripides' Bacchae: earth is transformed into a paradisewith milk, wine, and honey springing from the ground; maenads offer theirbreasts to a fawn. Yet at the very centre of this paradise there is murderoussavagery when the frenzied ones become irresistible hunters of animal and manstriving towards the climax of dismemberment, the \"delight of eating raw flesh.\"An atavistic spring of vital energy breaks through the crust of refined urbanculture. Man, humbled and intimidated by normal everyday life, can free himselfin the orgies from all that is oppressive and develop his true self. Ravingbecomes divine revelation, a centre of meaning in the midst of a world that isincreasingly profane and rational.True ecstasy has its own laws and sources, even if dance and rhythmic music canpromote it to a special degree; this is evident in the play of Euripides.Nevertheless, there are two very specific stimulants that belong to Dionysos,which cannot have been missing even in the secret celebrations: alcohol andsexual excitement, the drinking of wine and phallos symbolism. Two complexesfrom the Hellenistic age reveal details about the further development of Bacchicmysteries: the infamous Bacchanalia that were suppressed in Italy by Rome in 186B.C. with extreme brutality, and the magnificent frescoes of the Villa deiMisteri in Pompeii that date from the time of Caesar. Whereas in regard to theBacchanalia it is asserted that the initiation consisted inter alia in sufferinga homosexual act, in the frescoes a large, erect phallos in a winnowing basketis depicted next to the god; a woman is present to unveil it; blows with a rodare to be suffered too. The forms of Bacchic initiation probably varied a greatdeal from group to group, and from period to period, with the extent of thesevariations stretching from outdoor picnics to an existential turning-point inlife, from sublime symbolism to downright orgies. It is possible that old formsof puberty initiation were still preserved in sexual initiation; not virgins,but only women could be bacchai, and married couples could be initiatedtogether. Usually the purer forms of religion have better chances of longevitythan orgies in the modern sense.Liberation from former distress and from the pressures of everyday life, anencounter with the divine through an experience of the force and meaning oflife, are present in Dionysiac initiation. But hopes for the future, for deathandthe afterlife were no less a part of the secret advantage promised to those whoknew. This is shown above all by the gold leaf from Hipponion which came tolight only in 1969.Bacchic Hopes for an AfterlifeGold leaves from tombs in southern Italy, Thessaly, and Crete, with hexametertexts that give instruction to the dead about the path to be followed in theother world, have long been known and much discussed. The oldest and mostextensive text comes from Hipponion-Vibo Valentia and is dated with certainty toabout 400 B.C. by its archaeological context. The beginning is barelyintelligible and probably corrupt; then it runs:In the house of Hades there is a spring to the right, by it stands a whitecypress; here the souls, descending, are cooled. Do not approach this spring!Further you will find cool water flowing from the lake of recollection.Guardians stand over it who will ask you in their sensible mind why you arewandering through the darkness of corruptible Hades. Answer: I am a son of theearth and of the starry sky; but I am desiccated with thirst and am perishing:therefore give me quickly cool water flowing from the lake of recollection. Andthen the subjects of the Chthonian King (?) will have pity and will give you todrink from the lake of recollection . . . And indeed you are going a long,sacred way which also other mystai and bacchoi gloriously walk.This last statement is only in the text from Hipponion, while the main part, thescene before the guardians at the lake, is attested, with minor variations, inseveral other specimens.Mystai and bacchoi walk a sacred way, the goal of which is eternal bliss, indeedthe Island of the Blessed; Pindar calls this \"the path of Zeus.\" \"You will rulewith the other heroes,\" says another text. Knowledge and certainty of this isgained through initiation. \"Blessed are they all by the part they have in theinitiations that release from affliction,\" is said again in Pindar, in amourning song which points to the lot of the pious. To the sacred way which themystai walk there corresponds in this world the path to the mountain, theoreibasia: afterlife is repetition of the mysteries. Accordingly, in the FrogsAristophanes has the chorus of mystai in the underworld continue to celebratethe Iakchos procession on the Sacred Way to Eleusis. In parallel to this we findBacchic mysteries too aiming at a blessed state in the afterworld.The scenery of the underworld drawn in these texts is both impressive andenigmatic: the white cypress at the dangerous spring, the guardians at the coolwater, the password with which the initiate claims cosmic status: \"son of heavenand earth.\" The guardians at the water, and the question and answer havestriking parallels in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. To recollection someforgetting must correspond. Plato's myth tells of the \"plain of Lethe\" where thesouls drink from the river Ameles, Indifference, before reincarnation. Whetherreincarnation is also presupposed by the gold-leaf texts or whether, in aHomeric manner, a gloomy Hades of unconsciousness is threatening those who donot know, mustremain an open question. Recollection at any rate guarantees the better lot.\"Awake recollection of the sacred initiation in the mystai\" the goddess ofMemory is implored in a late Orphic hymn; in Plato, forgetting what the soul hasseen at the high point of its initiation makes it fall into the depths.Recollection, memory is valued highest among Pythagoreans.Herodotus reports that Egyptians do not bury their dead in woollen cloths, butin linen, and he adds: \"This corresponds to the so-called Orphica and Bac-chicawhich are in fact Egyptian and Pythagorean. The Bacchic cult prescription whichhas to do with death and burial is thus at the same time placed under the nameof Orpheus. Herodotus is writing in southern Italy about 430 B.C.; he thereforeis quite close to the text of Hipponion in time and place, a text which likeHerodotus speaks of Bacchic expectations in a funerary context; even thereferences to Egyptians and Pythagoreans fit remarkably well with what emergesfrom the gold leaves.From a grave precinct at Cumae in southern Italy comes an inscription that haslong been known: \"It is not permitted that someone should lie here who has notbeen made to celebrate as a bacchos.\" The special graveyard for thebe-bachcheumenoi openly corresponds to their exceptional lot in the other world.The initiation is not reserved for one sex: both the inscription and theHipponion text use the general, masculine form, but in the tomb of Hipponion awoman was buried.One detail of Bacchic ritual relating to the underworld appears in literature:\"Those who were initiated into the Bacchica were garlanded with poplar, becausethis plant is chthonic, and so is Dionysos the son of Persephone.\" The poplar,it is said, grows on the Acheron, and it was a wreath of poplar twigs thatHeracles put on after he had conquered Cerberus. Thus myth and ritual giveexpression to the bond with the nether world and the conquest of death at thesame time; this is explicitly connected with the chthonic Dionysos, son ofPersephone.Thus gold leaves, the inscription, and the literary texts fit together: by thefifth century at the latest there are Bacchic mysteries which promiseblessedness in the afterlife. Implied is the concept oibaccheia that designatesecstasy in the Dionysiac orgia, in which reality, including the fact of death,seems to dissolve. Our knowledge of the accompanying rites, myths, anddoctrines, remains, of course, very fragmentary.Bacchic hopes for an afterlife are hinted at in a veiled form by funerary gifts,as found in graves from the fourth century onwards. At Derveni not far fromThessaloniki the ashes of a noble Macedonian were buried about 330 B.C. in amagnificent gilt bronze krater, which is richly decorated with Dionysiac scenes;at another burial at the same place an Orphic book, part of which is preserved,was burnt along with the corpse. More modest yet more abundant and continuous isthe evidence which comes from the funeral vases of southern Italy. Again andagain the dead man and his grave are placed in a Dionysiac atmosphere; in onecase Orpheus is clearly portrayed as mediator of other worldly blessedness.Later Greek-Punic grave steles from Lilybaeum show the heroicized deadsurrounded by the emblems of the Dionysiac orgia-tympanon, kymbala, krotala, ivyleaf, and both kiste and kalathos, the true badge of mysteries. Plutarch, too,was a Dionysiac mystes and could still find a source of comfort in this at thedeath of a child. In all this we can discern, however faintly, an incalculablereligious current that is not to be underestimated. It would, however, be aninadmissible generalization to claim that all bacchic teletai were concernedexclusively or even primarily with the afterlife. There is no evidence at allfor a unified organization; the teletai remained as multiform as their god.There is a second group of gold leaves which were found exclusively in twoextraordinary grave mounds in Thurioi in southern Italy; they date to the fourthcentury B.C. In one of them several people, who had probably died by lightning,had been buried successively; death by heavenly fire seemed to announce anextraordinary status in the afterworld. In the texts from this grave the deadman proclaims: \"I come pure from the pure, queen of the chthonic, Eukles,Eu-buleus and you other immortal gods; for I am proud to be myself also of yourblessed race.\" Two texts added: \"I have paid penance for works not just,\" whilethe third adds some especially imaginative verses: \"I flew away from the circleof heavy grief and pains. I stepped with swift feet on the longed-for wreath. Idived beneath the lap of the mistress, the chthonic queen.\" There follows ablessing with the unprecedented claim: \"Happy and blessed one, god will you beinstead of a mortal;\" then an enigmatic conclusion: \"Kid I fell in the milk.\" Asimilar text comes from the larger grave mound in which a single man was buried,to whom ritual worship was paid: \"Be glad that you have suffered what you neversuffered before. A god you have become from a man. Kid you fell in the milk.\"The proclamation of beatitude, the suffering, and the code word of the kid mostprobably refer to some initiation ritual; Persephone, queen of the dead, plays aspecial role in these mysteries. The rest remains obscure: does the kid who fellin the milk point to a proverb or an initiation sacrifice? Does the lap of thegoddess hint at a ritual of rebirth? With the promise of apotheosis these textsgo beyond everything else that is known from Greek mysteries of the ClassicalAge. The order of what is set down and apportioned, Themis and Moira, seems todissolve. Here indeed mysteries infringe upon the system of traditional Greekreligion. Yet this seems to have remained an isolated case for a long time.The Hymn to DemeterGEORGE DEFOREST LORDIn this selection, George deForest Lord, distinguished Bodman Professor ofEnglish at Yale University, translates the Hymn to Demeter. The Hymn was putinto writing about 600 b.c.e. It tells the story of the abduction and rape ofPersephone and thus of the origin ofEleusis as a sacred place. Eleusis was thelocation of the reunion of Demeter and Persephone, mother and daughter. Thispoem is the best existing evidence for the nature of the mysteries at Eleusis.I sing now of fair-haired Demeter, reverend goddess, of her and her trim-ankleddaughter whom Hades carried away, a gift from Zeus, the Thunderer, theall-seeing as she was playing far from her mother, lady of the golden blade andshining fruit, with the ripe daughters of Ocean, gathering flowers through thesoft meadow—roses, crocuses, fair violets, irises also and hyacinths and thenarcissus Earth put forth by the will of Zeus to please the Host of Many, asnare for the blooming girl and a radiant wonder.It was a marvel for immortals or mortal men to see: from its root sprang ahundred blooms, and its fragrance made heaven and the whole earth and the saltswell of the sea laugh for joy. Astounded, the girl stretched forth both handsto seize the lovely plaything;but earth with its wide paths yawned there, in the plain of Nysa, and the Hostof Many, son of Kronos, with his immortal horses, sprang upon her, he who hasmany names.He seized her unwilling and lamenting and bore her off on his golden car, andshe called on her father, the glorious son of Kronos, on high. Neither god normortal heard her voice, nor did the rich-fruited olive trees. Only gentleHecate, Persaeus' shining-haired daughter, heard her from her cave, and LordHelios, Hyperion's splendid son, as she called.But her father sat aloof and apart from the gods in his prayer-thronged templereceiving sweet offerings from mortal men. So he, that son of Kronos, of manynames, hostand ruler of many, bore her off by Zeus's leave,his own brother's child, all unwilling, on his immortal car.As long as she still saw earth and starry heaven and the flowing sea, wherefishes shoal, and the rays of the sun, as long as she still hoped to see hermother and the race of immortals, hope calmed her great mind despite her grief.. . . Mountain heights and the sea's depths echoed her immortal voice, and herqueenly mother heard her.A pang pierced her heart, and she ripped the fine veil from her shining hair,cast off her dark cloak, and flew like a bird over firm land and yielding sea,searching. But no god or mortal wished to speak the truth; no birds of omen cameas true messengers. Nine days the lady Deo roamed the earth with flaming torchesin her hands, so grieved she never tasted ambrosia or drank sweet nectar orsprinkled water on her body. The tenth dawn, Hecate met her, holding a torch,and spoke to her aloud and told the news:\"Lady Demeter, bringer of seasons and bright gifts, what god or mortal seizedPersephone and pierced your loving heart with sorrow? I heard a voice but whoseI could not tell, but let me tell you briefly what I know.\"So, then, spoke Hecate. The daughter of fair-haired Rhea answered not a word,but sped away with her, holding bright torches. They came to Helios, watcher ofgods and men. Standing before his horses Demeter, shining goddess, asked of him:\"Helios, pay regard to me, goddess as I am, if ever I did anything to cheer yourheart and spirit. Through the fruitless air I heard the piercing cries of thelovely daughter I bore, sweet scion of my body, as if seized by force, but I sawnothing. But you, surveying the whole earth and sea, casting your rays throughthe bright air, Tell me truly if you have seen my dear child anywhere. What godor mortal has seized her against her will and mine, and so made off?\"So she asked. And the son of Hyperion answered, \"Queen Demeter, daughter offair-haired Rhea,you shall know, for I greatly reverence and pity youin your grief for your slim-ankled child.No other immortal is to blame but Zeus,the cloud-gatherer, who gave her to Hades,his own brother, to be his blooming wife.Hades took her crying aloud with his steedsdown to the misty darkness. But, Goddess,cease your lamentations; you mustn't beRelentless in your anger. Aidoneus, Host of Many,is no unfitting husband among immortals for your child,being your own brother from the same seed.As for honor, he has a third share inthat triple division made in the beginning,and is lord over all those he dwells among.\"So he spoke, and called his horses; at his word they whirled the swift chariotoff like long-winged birds.But grief more terrible and wild gripped Demeter's heart; so enraged was she atdark-clouded Kronides that she shunned the gods' gatherings and high Olympus,and went among the towns and fields of men and their rich labors, long hidingher form. No man or low-girt woman knew who she was until she reached the houseof wise Celeus, lord of Eleusis, a town rich in sacrifices. In deep sorrow shesat by the road near the Maiden Well, where local women drew water, a shadyplace above which an olive bush grew. She looked like an ancient woman pastchildbearing and the gifts of wreath-loving Aphrodite, the kind that nurses thechildren of kings who deal justice, or like the housekeepers in their echoinghalls. There the daughters of Celeus, Eleusis' son, saw her as they came to drawwater easily and bear it in bronze pitchers to their dear father's house. Therewere four of them, like goddesses in the flower of girlhood: Callidice,Cleisidice, lovely Demo, and Callithoe, the eldest. They knew her not— it ishard for mortals to recognize gods— but standing near her they spoke wingedwords: \"Old woman, whence and who are you of folk born long ago? Why have youleft the city and not approached a house?In their shady halls are women just your age, and others younger, who wouldwelcome you.\"... \"I am the honored Demeter, the greatest help of gods and men. But now letthe people build me a great temple and beneath it an altar below the steep wallson a rising hill above Kallichoron. I myself shall introduce rites so that lateryou may propitiate me by their performance.\"At these words the goddess changed her size and form and sloughed off old age,and a lovely scent came from her robes, and from her body and her golden hairradiance, like lightning, filled the house. And so she left the palace.Metaneira staggered and was speechless for a while and failed to lift herlate-born son from the ground. But his sisters heard him wailing pitifully andsprang down from their couches, and one took him in her bosom, another revivedthe fire, while a third sped on tender feet to rouse her mother from thefragrant chamber. So they gathered round the squirming child and washed him andsqueezed him lovingly. He was not comforted because much less skillful nursesheld him now.All night, quaking with fear, they tried to appease the glorious goddess, but asdawn appeared they told great Celeus all that had happened, as fair-crownedDemeter had ordered. So Celeus summoned the multitudes to meet and told them tobuild a fine temple for rich-haired Demeter and an altar on a hillock. Theyobeyed his commands swiftly, and the temple grew by divine decree. As for thechild, he grew like an immortal.Now when they had finished building and ceased their work, they all went home.But fair-haired Demeter stayed apart from the blessed gods, wasted with yearningfor her buxom daughter. Then she brought on mankind a cruel year overall-nourishing earth: the seed didn't sprout, for rich-haired Demeter suppressedit; in the fields the oxen drew their curved ploughs in vain, and in vain didwhite barley-seed fall to earth. So, with famine she would have destroyedthe whole race of men and robbed Olympiansof their due gifts and sacrifices,had not Zeus perceived this and pondered in his heart.First, he sent Iris of the golden wings to summon fair-haired Demeter, thebeautiful. Gladly she obeyed dark-clouded Kronides and sped through interveningspace. She reached Eleusis rich in sacrifice, a city fragrant and strong. Shefound veiled Demeter in her temple and spoke winged words:\"Demeter, Father Zeus, whose wisdom never fails, bids you join the company ofimmortals; come, then, and let not his bidding pass unheeded.\" Thus Irisimplored. Demeter was unmoved.Then the Father sent all the blessed Olympians, and, one by one, they came,hailing her and offering lovely gifts and whatever rights she might choose amongthe deathless gods. Yet no one could move her in her strong wrath. Adamant, sherejected their pleas: Never, she swore, would she set foot on Olympus nor letfruit spring from the ground, not until she saw her lovely daughter with her owneyes.When he heard this, all-seeing Zeus the Thunderer, sent Hermes of the goldenwand to Erebus to win over Hades with soft words that he might lead chastePersephone up from the misty gloom to join the gods, so her mother might see herand give up her wrath.Promptly Hermes left the house of Olympus and sped down to the depths of earth.He found Lord Hades at home, seated on a couch, his shy, reluctant bride besidehim, yearning for her mother. But she was far off, brooding on her plan, apartfrom the gods. The strong slayer of Argos drew near and said: \"Dark-hairedHades, king of the departed, Zeus bids me bring noble Persephone from Erebus soher mother can see her and so give up her anger at the gods. For now she plotsan awful deed, to kill off the feeble tribes of men by hiding the seed beneaththe earth, extinguishing the honorsdue the undying gods. Her anger is terrible. She shuns the gods and sequestersherself in her fragrant temple in Eleusis' rocky hold.\"So he said. And Ai'doneus, ruler of the dead, smiled a grim smile and yielded toKing Zeus. He urged Persephone the wise to go, saying: \"Go now, Persephone, toyour dark-robed mother, go with a gentle spirit, be not cast down. I shall be nounfitting husband for you among immortals. Father Zeus is my brother. While youare here you shall rule all that lives and moves. Any who defraud you or fail toappease your power by due rites and rich gifts shall suffer forever.\"At this Persephone sprang up, rejoicing. But, surreptitiously, he gave her aseed of pomegranate to eat, taking care that she stay not forever with graveDemeter of the dark robe.Then Ai'doneus, Host of Many, harnessed his deathless horses to the goldenchariot. Persephone mounted and Argeiphontes took reins and whip and sped fromthe hall. Quickly they covered their course: neither sea nor rivers nor grassyglens nor peaks of mountains checked the undying steeds, and they clove the deepair as they went.When Demeter saw them she rushed like a Maenad down mountain thickets, while onher side Persephone leapt from the chariot and ran to her mother and hugged herpassionately. But while Demeter held her child her heart misgave her, fearingsome trick, so she stopped caressing her and asked right off: \"Surely, child,you touched no food while you were below? Tell me all. If you have not, youshall return from loathsome Hades to live with me and your father, dark-cloudedZeus, son of Kronos, honored by the deathless ones, but if you have tastedanything you must go back down to the secret places of the earth, to dwell therea third of the revolving year. Even so, for the rest, you shall be with me andthe other deathless gods. When the earth blooms with fragrant flowers of allkinds, from your dark kingdom you shall arise again as a marvel to gods and men.Tell me now how he took you away to his realm of gloomy darkness. What trick didthe strong Host of Many beguile you with?\"Lovely Persephone replies, \"Mother, here is the plain truth. When Hermes camewith the message from Zeus, my father, and the other sons of Heaven, bidding mecome back from Erebus so you might see me and give up your anger with the gods,I leaped for joy; but secretly he put a pomegranate seed into my mouth and mademe taste it against my will.\"I'll tell you also how he snatched me away by the deep plot of my father, sonof Kronos, and carried me down to the depths of the earth.\"We were all playing in a lovely meadow, Leucippe and Phaeno and Electra and Ianthe, Melita also and Iache with Rhodea and Callirhoe, and Melobosis and Tycheand Ocyrhoe, fair as a blossom, Chryseis, Ianeira, Acaste, Rhodope and Pluto andcharming Calypso. Styx was there and Urania and fair Calaxaura with warlikePallas and Artemis, who loves arrows. We were playing and gathering sweetblossoms in our hands—soft crocuses mixed with iris and hyacinths and roses andlilies, marvelous to see, and the narcissus wide earth made grow yellow ascrocus. That one I plucked, ravished with delight, but the earth split open. Thestrong Lord, Host of Many,sprang forth and bore me off unwilling in his car of gold beneath the earth. Icried piercingly. This is all true, much as it grieves me to tell the tale.\"So, with one heart, they cheered each other with many embraces, and their griefchanged to joy. Then bright-coifed Hecate came and embraced holy Demeter'sdaughter again and again; from that time Hecate was her companion and mentor.And Zeus, who knows it all, sent rich-haired Rhea as messenger to bringdark-cloaked Demeter to join the family of gods, and he promised to grant herwhatever rights she chose among the immortal gods and agreed that their daughtershould descend to the dark gloomfor a third of the revolving year; the restshe should spend with her mother and the other immortals.So he decreed, and the goddess complied, rushing from the heights of Olympus.She came to the Rharian Plain, once fertile corn-land, now dry, bare andleafless, since by Demeter's design the grass was hid. But as spring waxed itwas soon to be alive with long-eared wheat, its furrows filled with the mowers'work soon to be bound in sheaves. There she first landed from the fruitlessether, and the goddesses rejoiced when they saw each other. Then bright-hairedRhea said to Demeter, \"Come, my daughter. Far-seeing Zeus the Thunderer callsyou to join the family of gods and has sworn to grant whatever rights you chooseamong them and has agreed on allotting the time your daughter will spend inchthonic gloom and the time she shall spend with you and the other deathlessgods. Come, daughter, obey; don't be adamant in your anger. Increase for menlife-giving harvests.\"So spoke Rhea, and crowned Demeter did not refuse.Promptly she made fruit spring from the rich land so the whole wide earth wasladen with leaves and flowers. Then she went to the kings who deal justice,Triptolemos, Diocles the horseman, strong Eumolpus and Celeus, leader of thepeople, and taught them how to conduct her rites and showed them all hermysteries as well—awful mysteries that none may pry into or utter or transgressin any way, for deep awe of the gods seals their lips. Blessed is he among menon earth who has seen these mysteries, but those uninitiated, who have no partin them, do not prosper; once dead they waste away down in the dark gloom.When the bright goddess had taught them all, they went to the gathering of theother immortals on Olympus. And there they dwell beside Zeus, who loves tothunder, awful and reverend goddesses.Happy indeed is the man they freely love, for they send Ploutos as a guest inhis house, Ploutos who gives mortals wealth.And now, queen of the sweet Eleusinian land and sea-girt Paros and rocky Antron,Lady, giver of good gifts, bringer of seasons, queen Deo, be gracious, you andyour daughter Persephone, and for my song grant me heartwarming substance.The Teachings of PythagorasOVIDIn mathematics, music, astrology, and every other science Pythagoras sought themystical unity of all things in the world. In this selection from Ovid,Pythagoras presents what might well be the insight or mystic knowledge (gnosis)of one who had passed through the initiation rituals ofEleusis. Pythagoras'svision of the world is a rational explanation of the mystical enlightenment.There was a man here, Samian born, but heHad fled from Samos, for he hated tyrantsAnd chose, instead, an exile's lot. His thoughtReached far aloft, to the great gods in Heaven,And his imagination looked on visionsBeyond his mortal sight. All things he studiedWith watchful eager mind, and he brought homeWhat he had learned and sat among the peopleTeaching them what was worthy, and they listenedIn silence, wondering at the revelationsHow the great world began, the primal cause,The nature of things, what God is, whence the snowsCome down, where lightning breaks from, whether windOr Jove speaks in the thunder from the clouds,The cause of earthquakes, by what law the starsWheel in their courses, all the secrets hiddenFrom man's imperfect knowledge. He was firstTo say that animal food should not be eaten,And learned as he was, men did not alwaysBelieve him when he preached \"Forbear, O mortals,To spoil your bodies with such impious food!There is corn for you, apples, whose weight bears downThe bending branches; there are grapes that swellOn the green vines, and pleasant herbs, and greensMade mellow and soft with cooking; there is milkAnd clover-honey. Earth is generousWith her provision, and her sustenanceIs very kind; she offers, for your tables,Food that requires no bloodshed and no slaughter.Meat is for beasts to feed on, yet not allAre carnivores, for horses, sheep, and cattleSubsist on grass, but those whose dispositionIs fierce and cruel, tigers, raging lions,And bears and wolves delight in bloody feasting.Oh, what a wicked thing it is for fleshTo be the tomb of flesh, for the body's cravingTo fatten on the body of another,For one live creature to continue livingThrough one live creature's death. In all the richnessThat Earth, the best of mothers, tenders to us,Does nothing please except to chew and mangleThe flesh of slaughtered animals? The CyclopsCould do no worse! Must you destroy anotherTo satiate your greedy-gutted cravings?There was a time, the Golden Age, we call it,Happy in fruits and herbs, when no men taintedTheir lips with blood, and birds went flying safelyThrough the air, and in the fields the rabbits wanderedUnfrightened, and on little fish was everHooked by its own credulity: all thingsWere free from treachery and fear and cunning,And all was peaceful. But some innovator,A good-for-nothing, whoever he was, decided,In envy, that what lions ate was better.Stuffed meat into his belly like a furnace,And paved the way for crime. It may have beenThat steel was warmed and dyed with blood through killingDangerous beasts, and that could be forgivenOn grounds of self-defense; to kill wild beasts Is lawful, but they never shouldbe eaten.One crime leads to another: first the swineWere slaughtered, since they rooted up the seedsAnd spoiled the season's crop; then goats were punishedOn vengeful altars for nibbling at the grape-vines.These both deserved their fate, but the poor sheep,What had they ever done, born for man's service,But bring us milk, so sweet to drink, and clothe usWith their soft wool, who give us more while livingThan ever they could in death? And what had oxen,Incapable of fraud or trick or cunning,Simple and harmless, born to a life of labor,What had they ever done? None but an ingrate,Unworthy of the gift of grain, could everTake off the weight of the yoke, and .with the axeStrike at the neck that bore it, kill his fellowWho helped him break the soil and raise the harvest.It is bad enough to do these things; we makeThe gods our partners in the abomination,Saying they love the blood of bulls in Heaven.So there he stands, the victim at the altars,Without a blemish, perfect (and his beautyProves his own doom), in sacrificial garlands,Horns tipped with gold, and hears the priest intoning:Not knowing what he means, watches the barleySprinkled between his horns, the very barleyHe helped make grow, and then is struckAnd with his blood he stains the knife whose flashingHe may have seen reflected in clear water.Then they tear out his entrails, peer, examine,Search for the will of Heaven, seeking omens.And then, so great man's appetite for foodForbidden, then, O human race, you feed,You feast, upon your kill. Do not do this,I pray you, but remember: when you tasteThe flesh of slaughtered cattle, you are eatingYour fellow-workers.\"Now, since the god inspires me, I follow where he leads, to open Delphi, Thevery heavens, bring you revelation Of mysteries, great matters never traced Byany mind before, and matters lost Or hidden and forgotten, these I sing.There is no greater wonder than to range The starry heights, to leave theearth's dull regions, To ride the clouds, to stand on Atlas' shoulders, And see,far off, far down, the little figures Wandering here and there, devoid ofreason, Anxious, in fear of death, and so advise them, And so make fate an openbook.\"O mortals, Dumb in cold fear of death, why do you tremble At Stygian rivers,shadows, empty names, The lying stock of poets, and the terrors Of a falseworld? I tell you that your bodies Can never suffer evil, whether fire Consumesthem, or the waste of time. Our souls Are deathless; always, when they leave ourbodies, They find new dwelling-places. I myself, I well remember, in the TrojanWar Was Panthous' son, Euphorbus, and my breast Once knew the heavy spear ofMenelaus. Not long ago, in Argos, Abas' city, In Juno's temple, I saw the shieldI carried On my left arm. All things are always changing, But nothing dies. Thespirit comes and goes, Is housed wherever it wills, shifts residence From beaststo men, from men to beasts, but always It keeps on living. As the pliant wax Isstamped with new designs, and is no longer What once it was, but changes form,and still Is pliant wax, so do I teach that spirit Is evermore the same, thoughpassing always To ever-changing bodies. So I warn you, Lest appetite murderbrotherhood, I warn you By all the priesthood in me, do not exile What may bekindred souls by evil slaughter. Blood should not nourish blood.\"Full sail, I voyage Over the boundless oc^an, and I tell you Nothing ispermanent in all the world. All things are fluent; every image forms, Wanderingthrough change. Time is itself a river In constant movement, and the hours flowby Like water, wave on wave, pursued, pursuing, Forever fugitive, forever new.That which has been, is not; that which was not, Begins to be; motion and momentalwaysIn process of renewal. Look, the night,Worn out, aims toward the brightness, and sun's glorySucceeds the dark. The color of the skyIs different at midnight, when tired thingsLie all at rest, from what it is at morningWhen Lucifer rides his snowy horse, beforeAurora paints the sky for Phoebus' coming.The shield of the god reddens at early morning,Reddens at evening, but is white at noondayIn purer air, farther from earth's contagion.And the Moon-goddess changes in the nighttime,Lesser today than yesterday, if waning,Greater tomorrow than today, when crescent.Our bodies also change. What we have been,What we now are, we shall not be tomorrow.There was a time when we were only seed,Only the hope of men, housed in the womb,WTiere Nature shaped us, brought us forth, exposed usTo the void air, and there in light we lay,Feeble and infant, and were quadrupedsBefore too long, and after a little wobbledAnd pulled ourselves upright, holding a chair,The side of the crib, and strength grew into us,And swiftness; youth and middle age went swiftlyDown the long hill toward age, and all our vigorCame to decline, so Milon, the old wrestler,Weeps when he sees his arms whose bulging musclesWere once like Hercules', and Helen weepsTo see her wrinkles in the looking glass:Could this old woman ever have been ravished,Taken twice over? Time devours all thingsWith envious Age, together. The slow gnawingConsumes all things, and very, very slowly.Not even the so-called elements are constant.Listen, and I will tell you of their changes.There are four of them, and two, the earth and water,Are heavy, and their own weight bears them downward,And two, the air and fire (and fire is purerEven than air) are light, rise upwardIf nothing holds them down. These elementsAre separate in space, yet all things comeFrom them and into them, and they can changeInto each other. Earth can be dissolvedTo flowing water, water can thin to air,And air can thin to fire, and fire can thickenTo air again, and air condense to water,And water be compressed to solid earth.Nothing remains the same: the great renewer,Nature, makes form from form, and, oh, believe meThat nothing ever dies. What we call birthIs the beginning of a difference,No more than that, and death is only ceasingOf what had been before. The parts may vary,Shifting from here to there, hither and yon,And back again, but the great sum is constant.The earth has something animal about it,Living almost, with many lungs to breathe through,Sending out flames, but the passages of breathingAre changeable; some caverns may be closedAnd new ones open whence the fire can issue.Deep caves compress the violent winds, which driveRock against rock, imprisoning the matterThat holds the seeds of flame, and this bursts blazingIgnited by the friction, and the cavesCool when the winds are spent. The tars and pitches,The yellow sulphur with invisible burning,Are no eternal fuel, so volcanoes,Starved of their nourishment, devour no longer,Abandon fire, as they have been abandoned.Far to the north, somewhere around Pallene, The story goes, there is a lakewhere men Who plunge nine times into the chilly waters Come out with downyfeathers over their bodies. This I do not believe, nor that the women Of Scythiasprinkle their bodies with magic juices For the same purpose and effect.\"However, There are stranger things that have been tried and tested And these wemust believe. You have seen dead bodies, Rotten from time or he^t, breed smallercreatures. Bury the carcasses of slaughtered bullocks, Chosen for sacrifice (allmen know this), And from the putrid entrails will come flying The flower-cullingbees, whose actions prove Their parenthood, for they are fond of meadows, Arefond of toil, and work with hopeful spirit. The horse, being warlike, after heis buried Produces hornets. Cut a sea-crab's claws, Bury the rest of the body,and a scorpionComes from the ground. And worms that weave cocoonsWhite on the leaves of the trees, as country people,Know well, turn into moths with death's-head marking.The mud holds seeds that generate green frogs,Legless at first, but the legs grow, to swim with,And take long jumps with, later. And a bear-cub,New-born, is not a bear at all, but onlyA lump, hardly alive, whose mother gives itA licking into shape, herself as model.The larvae of the honey-bearing bees,Safe in hexagonal waxen cells, are nothingBut wormlike bodies; feet and wings come later.Who would believe that from an egg would comeSuch different wonders as Juno's bird, the peacock,Jove's eagle, Venus' dove, and all the fliers?Some people think that when the human spineHas rotted in the narrow tomb, the marrowIs changed into a serpent.\"All these things Have their beginning in some other creature, But there is onebird which renews itself Out of itself. The Assyrians call it the phoenix. Itdoes not live on seeds nor the green grasses, But on the gum of frankincense andjuices Of cardamon. It lives five centuries, As you may know, and then it buildsitself A nest in the highest branches of a palm-tree, Using its talons and cleanbeak to cover This nest with cassia and spikes of spikenard, And cinnamon andyellow myrrh, and there It dies among the fragrance, and from the body A tinyphoenix springs to birth, whose years Will be as long. The fledgling, gainingstrength To carry burdens, lifts the heavy nest, His cradle and the old one'stomb, and bears it Through the thin air to the city of the Sun And lays it as anoffering at the doors Of the Sun-god's holy temple.\"Wonders, wonders!

India, conquered, GaveBacchus, tendril-crowned, the tawny lynxes Whose urine, when it met the air, washardenedBecoming stone; so coral also hardensAt the first touch of air, while under waterIt sways, a pliant weed.\"The day will end, The Sun-god plunge tired horses in the ocean Before I havethe time I need to tell you All of the things that take new forms. We see Theeras change, nations grow strong, or weaken, Like Troy, magnificent in men andriches, For ten years lavish with her blood, and now Displaying only ruins andfor wealth The old ancestral tombs. Sparta, Mycenae, Athens, and Thebes, allflourished once, and now What are they more than names? I hear that Rome Isrising, out of Trojan blood, established On strong and deep foundations, wherethe Tiber Comes from the Apennines. Rome's form is changing Growing togreatness, and she will be, some day, Head of the boundless world; so we aretold By oracles and seers. I can remember When Troy was tottering ruinward, aprophet, Helenus,' son of Priam, told Aeneas In consolation for his doubts andweeping0 son of Venus, if you bear in mindMy prophecies, Troy shall not wholly perish While you are living: fire and swordwill give you Safe passage through them; you will carry on Troy's relics, till aland, more friendly to you Than your own native soil, will give asylum.1 see the destined city for the TrojansAnd their sons' sons, none greater in all the ages, Past, present, or to come.Through long, long eras Her famous men will bring her power, but one, Sprungfrom lulus' blood, will make her empress Of the whole world, and after earth hasused him The heavens will enjoy him, Heaven will be His destination.' WhatHelenus told Aeneas, I have told you, I remember, and I am happy That for ourkin new walls, at last, are rising, That the Greek victory was to such goodpurpose.We must not wander far and wide, forgettingThe goal of our discourse. Remember this:The heavens and all below them, earth and her creatures,All change, and we, part of creation, alsoMust suffer change. We are not bodies only,But winged spirits, with the power to enterAnimal forms, house in the bodies of cattle.Therefore, we should respect those dwelling-placesWhich may have given shelter to the spiritOf fathers, brothers, cousins, human beingsAt least, and we should never do them damage,Not stuff ourselves like the cannibal Thyestes.An evil habit, impious preparation,Wicked as human bloodshed, to draw the knifeAcross the throat of the calf, and hear its anguishCry to deaf ears! And who could slayThe little goat whose cry is like a baby's,Or eat a bird he has himself just fed. JOne might as well do murder; he is onlyThe shortest step away. Let the bull plowAnd let him owe his death to length of days;Let the sheep give you armor for rough weather,The she-goats bring full udders to the milking.Have done with nets and traps and snares and springes,Bird-lime and forest-beaters, lines and fish-hooks.Kill, if you must, the beasts that do you harm,But, even so, let killing be enough;Let appetite refrain from flesh, take onlyA gentler nourishment.\"Unit XIWhere There Was No Path: Arthurian Legends and the Western WayDe Excidio et Conquestu BritanniaeGILDASGildas was a Welshman who, like many others at the time, fled Britain andsettled in Brittany on the northern coast of France. This selection from DeExcidio et Conquestu Britanniae (\"The Cutting-Up and Conquest of Britain\"),written about 540, is the oldest surviving reference to Arthur. Gildaschronicles the invasions of the Anglo-Saxons, whom from this selection it isclear that Gildas hates.FROM CHAPTER 25And thus some of the wretched remnants [of the Britons], caught in themountains, were slaughtered in large numbers; others, weakened by hunger, cameforward and surrendered to their enemies [the Saxons] to be slaves forever, iffor all that they were not immediately cut to pieces, which was the greatestkindness that remained to them; others went to lands across the sea with loudlamentation, just as if in the manner of the chief oarsman intoning in this wayunder the billows of the sails: \"Thou hast made us like sheep for slaughter, andhas scattered us among the nations\" [Psalms 44:11]; others, entrusting lifealways with suspicious mind to the mountainous country, overhanging hills, steepfortified places, densest forests, and sea caverns, stood firm on their nativesoil, although in a state of fear. Then, some time intervening, when these mostcruel plunderers had gone back home, under the leader Ambrosius Aurelianus, amoderate man, who by chance alone of the Roman nation had survived in the shockof so great a calamity—his parents, undoubtedly of royal rank, having perishedin the same disaster, his progeny today having very much degenerated from theexcellence of their ancestors—[the remnants of the Britons] gained strength andchallenging the conquerors to battle, by God's favor the victory fell to them.FROM CHAPTER 26Since that period, at one time our countrymen, at another the enemy, werevictorious ... up to the year of the besieging of Mount Badon, when almost thelast but not the least slaughter of these hangdogs took place, and which, as Iknow, begins the forty-fourth year (one month having passed already), which isalso the year of my birth.Historia BrittonumNENNIUSIn this selection from Historia Brittonum, Nennius, an Anglo-Saxon, describesthe customs and legends of the Britons before and during the Anglo-Saxonconquest. Nennius wrote in the year 800 after the conversion of Britain toChristianity and thus makes Arthur a Christian.FROM CHAPTER 56At that time the Saxons grew powerful in great numbers and increased in Britain.But now that Hengist was dead, his son Octha crossed over from the left side ofBritain to the kingdom of the Kentishmen, and from him are sprung the kings ofthe Kentishmen. Then Arthur fought against them [the Saxons] in those daystogether with the kings of Britain, but he was himself the leader of battles.The first battle was at the mouth of the river which is called Glein; thesecond, third, fourth, and fifth on another river, which is called Dub-glas andis in the region of Linnuis; the sixth battle on a river which is called Bassas.The seventh was the battle in the wood of Celidon, that is Cat Coit Celidon. Theeighth was the battle at the castle Guinnion, in which Arthur carried the imageof Saint Mary, the perpetual Virgin, on his shoulders and the pagans were put toflight on that day, and there was great slaughter of them by the virtue of ourLord, Jesus Christ, and by the virtue of Saint Mary the Virgin, His Mother. Theninth battle was fought in the city of the Legion. The tenth battle he fought onthe shore of the river, which is called Tribruit. The eleventh was the battlewaged on the mountain, which is called Agned. The twelfth was the battle atMount Badon, in which on one day nine hundred and sixty men fell to the groundduring one onset of Arthur; and no one overthrew them save himself alone, and inall the battles he emerged the victor.FROM CHAPTER 73There is another marvelous thing in the region which is called Buelt. There isat that place a pile of stones and one stone placed over and above this heapwith the footprint of a dog on it. When he was hunting the boar Troynt, Cabal,who was the dog of Arthur the soldier, impressed his footprint on the stone, andArthur afterwards gathered together a pile of stones under the one on which wasthe footprint of his dog, and it is called Cam Cabal. And men come and carry thestone away in their hands for the space of a day and a night, and on the nextday it is found back on its pile.There is another marvel in the region which is called Ercing. There is found atthat place a tomb near a fountain, which is called Licat Anir, and the name ofthe man who is buried in the sepulchral mound was thus designated Anir. He wasthe son of Arthur the soldier, and he was the one who killed him in the sameplace and buried him. And men come to measure the sepulchral mound, sometimessix, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen feet in length.Whatever way you measure it in alternation, the second time you will not findits measurement the same, and I have tested it myself.Historia Regum BritanniaeGEOFFREY OF MONMOUTHGeoffrey of Monmouth (1100-1154) was a Welsh clerk from a minor religious order,who spent most of his life in Oxford before returning to Wales in 1151 as Bishopof St. Assaph. As is obvious from this selection, Geoffrey was a Welshman, aCelt, and fiercely nationalistic. In his book Historia Regum Britanniae (TheHistory of the Kings of Britain), Geoffrey attempts to trace the history of theBriton people to the royal family of Troy and provides the first fully developedaccount of Arthur. The book was written in 1136 and translated by Bobert Waceinto French in 1155, which brought the story of Arthur to France. This selectionpresents many of the familiar characters of romance such as Uther Pendragon,Merlin, Kay, and Bedevere.BOOK I, CHAPTER 1Epistle Dedicatory to Bobert, Earl of GloucestervJftentimes in turning over in mine own mind the many themes that might besubject-matter of a book, my thoughts would fall upon the plan of writing ahistory of the Kings of Britain, and in my musings thereupon me-seemed it amarvel that, beyond such mention as Gildas and Bede have made of them in theirluminous tractate, nought could I find as concerning the kings that had dwelt inBritain before the Incarnation of Christ, nor nought even as concerning Arthurand the many others that did succeed him after the Incarnation, albeit thattheir deeds be worthy of praise everlasting and be as pleasantly rehearsed frommemory by word of mouth in the traditions of many peoples as though they hadbeen written down. Now, whilst I was thus thinking upon such matters, Walter,Archdeacon of Oxford, a man learned not only to the art of eloquence, but in thehistories of foreign lands, offered me a certain most ancient book in theBritish language that did set forth the doings of them all in duesuccession and order from Brute, the first King of the Britons, onward toCad-wallader, the son of Cadwallo, all told in stories of exceeding beauty. Athis request, therefore, albeit that never have I gathered gay flowers of speechin other men's little gardens, and am content with mine own rustic manner ofspeech and mine own writing-reeds, have I been at the pains to translate thisvolume into the Latin tongue. For had I besprinkled my page with high-flownphrases, I should only have engendered a weariness in my readers by compellingthem to spend more time over the meaning of the words than upon understandingthe drift of my story.Unto this my little work, therefore, do thou, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, showfavour in such wise that it may be so corrected by thy guidance and counsel asthat it may be held to have sprung, not from the poor little fountain ofGeoffrey of Monmouth, but rather from thine own deep sea of knowledge, and tosavour of thy salt. Let it be held to be thine own offspring, as thou thyselfart offspring of the illustrious Henry, King of the English. Let it be thine, asone that hath been nurtured in the liberal arts by philosophy, and called untothe command of our armies by thine own inborn prowess of knighthood; thine, whomin these our days Britain haileth with heart-felt affection as though in theeshe had been vouchsafed a second Henry.CHAPTER 19After this victory Uther marched unto the city of Dumbarton and made ordinancefor settling that province, as well as for restoring peace everywhere. He alsowent round all the nations of the Scots, and made that rebellious people layaside their savage ways, for such justice did he execute throughout the lands asnever another of his predecessors had ever done before him. In his days didmisdoers tremble, for they were dealt punishment without mercy. At last, when hehad stablished his peace in the parts of the North, he went to London and badethat Octa and Eosa should be kept in prison there. And when the Easter festivaldrew nigh, he bade the barons of the realm assemble in that city that he mightcelebrate so high holiday with honour by assuming the crown thereon. All obeyedaccordingly, and repairing thither from the several cities, assembled togetheron the eve of the festival. The King, accordingly, celebrated the ceremony as hehad proposed, and made merry along with his barons, all of whom did make greatcheer for that the King had received them in such joyful wise. For all thenobles that were there had come with their wives and daughters as was meet on soglad a festival. Among the rest, Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, was there, with hiswife Igerna, that in beauty did surpass all the other dames of the whole ofBritain. And when the King espied her amidst the others, he did suddenly wax sofain of her love that, paying no heed unto none of the others, he turned all hisattention only upon her. Only unto her did he send dainty tit-bits from his owndish; only unto her did he send the golden cups with messages through hisfamiliars. Many a time did he smile upon her and spake merrily unto her withal.But when her husband did perceive all this, straightway he waxedwroth and retired from the court without leave taken. Nor was any that mightrecall him thither, for that he feared to lose the one thing that he lovedbetter than all other. Uther, waxing wroth hereat, commanded him to return andappear in his court that he might take lawful satisfaction for the affront hehad put upon him. And when Gorlois was not minded to obey the summons, the Kingwas enraged beyond all measure and sware with an oath that he would ravage hisdemesnes so he hastened not to make him satisfaction. Forthwith, the quarrelbetwixt the two abiding unsettled, the King gathered a mighty army together andwent his way into the province of Cornwall and set fire to the cities andcastles therein. But Gorlois, not daring to meet him in the field for that hehad not so many armed men, chose rather to garrison his own strong places untilsuch time as he obtained the succour he had besought from Ireland. And, for thathe was more troubled upon his wife's account than upon his own, he placed her inthe Castle of Tintagel on the seacoast, as holding it to be the safer refuge.Howbeit, he himself betook him into the Castle of Dimilioc, being afeared thatin case disaster should befall him both might be caught in one trap. And whenmessage of this was brought unto the King, he went unto the castle whereinGorlois had ensconced him, and beleaguered him and cut off all access unto him.At length, at the end of a week, mindful of his love for Igerna, he spake untoone of his familiars named Ulfin of Rescraddeck: \"I am consumed of love forIgerna, nor can I have no joy, nor do I look to escape peril of my body save Imay have possession of her. Do thou therefore give me counsel in what wise I mayfulfil my desire, for, and I do not, of mine inward sorrow shall I die.\" Untowhom Ulfin: \"And who shall give thee any counsel that may avail, seeing thatthere is no force that may prevail whereby to come unto her in the Castle ofTintagel? For it is situate on the sea, and is on every side encompassedthereby, nor none other entrance is there save such as a narrow rock dothfurnish, the which three armed knights could hold against thee, albeit thou wertstanding there with the whole realm of Britain beside thee. But, and if Merlinthe prophet would take the matter in hand, I do verily believe that by hiscounsel thou mightest compass thy heart's desire.\"The King, therefore, believing him, bade Merlin be called, for he, too, had comeunto the leaguer. Merlin came forthwith accordingly, and when he stood inpresence of the King, was bidden give counsel how the King's desire might befulfilled. When he found how sore tribulation of mind the King was suffering, hewas moved at beholding the effect of a love so exceeding great, and saith he:\"The fulfilment of thy desire doth demand the practice of arts new and unheardof in this thy day. Yet know I how to give thee the semblance of Gorlois by myleechcrafts in such sort as that thou shalt seem in all things to be his veryself. If, therefore, thou art minded to obey me, I will make thee like unto himutterly, and Ulfin will I make like unto Jordan of Tintagel his familiar. I alsowill take upon me another figure and will be with ye as a third, and in suchwise we may go safely unto the castle and have access unto Igerna.\" The Kingobeyed accordingly, and gave heed strictly unto that which Merlin enjoined him.At last, committing the siege into charge of his familiars, he did entrusthimself unto the artsand medicaments of Merlin, and was transformed into the semblance of Gorlois.Ulfin was changed into Jordan, and Merlin into Brithael in such sort as thatnone could have told the one from the other. They then went their way towardTint-agel, and at dusk hour arrived at the castle. The porter, weening that theDuke had arrived, swiftly unmade the doors, and the three were admitted. Forwhat other than Gorlois could it be, seeing that in all things it seemed as ifGorlois himself were there? So the King lay that night with Igerna and enjoyedthe love for which he had yearned, for as he had beguiled her by the falselikeness he had taken upon him, so he beguiled her also by the feigneddiscourses wherewith he did full artfully entertain her. For he told her he hadissued forth of the besieged city for naught save to see to the safety of herdear self and the castle wherein she lay, in such sort that she believed himevery word, and had no thought to deny him in aught he might desire. And uponthat same night was the most renowned Arthur conceived, that was not only famousin after years, but was well worthy of all the fame he did achieve by hissurpassing prowess.CHAPTER 20In the meantime, when the beleaguering army found that the King was not amongstthem, they did unadvisedly make endeavour to breach the walls and challenge thebesieged Duke to battle. Who, himself also acting unadvisedly, did straightwaysally forth with his comrades in arms, weening that his handful of men werestrong enow to make head against so huge a host of armed warriors. But when theymet face to face in battle, Gorlois was amongst the first that were slain, andall his companies were scattered. The castle, moreover, that they had besiegedwas taken, and the treasure that was found therein divided, albeit not by faircasting of lots, for whatsoever his luck or hardihood might throw in his way dideach man greedily clutch in his claws for his own. But by the time that thisoutrageous plundering had at last come to an end messengers had come unto Igernato tell her of the Duke's death and the issue of the siege. But when they beheldthe King in the likeness of the Duke sitting beside her, they blushed scarlet,and stared in amazement at finding that he whom they had just left dead at theleaguer had thus arrived hither safe and sound, for little they knew what themedicaments of Merlin had accomplished. The King therefore, smiling at thetidings, and embracing the countess, spake saying: \"Not slain, verily, am I, forlo, here thou seest me alive, yet, natheless, sore it irketh me of thedestruction of my castle and the slaughter of my comrades, for that which nextis to dread is lest the King should overtake us here and make us prisoners inthis castle. First of all, therefore, will I go meet him and make my peace withhim, lest a worst thing befall us.\" Issuing forth accordingly, he made his wayunto his own army, and putting off the semblance of Gorlois again became UtherPen-dragon. And when he understood how everything had fallen out, albeit that hewas sore grieved at the death of Gorlois, yet could he not but be glad thatIgerna was released from the bond of matrimony. Returning, therefore, toTintagel, hetook the castle, and not the castle only, but Igerna also therein, and on thiswise fulfilled he his desire. Thereafter were they linked together in no littlemutual love, and two children were born unto them, a son and a daughter, whereofthe son was named Arthur and the daughter Anna.BOOK IX, CHAPTER 1After the death of Uther Pendragon, the barons of Britain did come together fromthe divers provinces unto the city of Silchester, and did bear on hand Dubric,Archbishop of Caerleon, that he should crown as king, Arthur, the late King'sson. For sore was need upon them; seeing that when the Saxons heard of Uther'sdeath they had invited their fellow-countrymen from Germany, and under theirDuke Colgrin were bent upon exterminating the Britons. They had, moreover,entirely subdued all that part of the island which stretcheth from the riverHumber, as far as the sea of Caithness. Dubric, therefore, sorrowing over thecalamities of the country, assembled the other prelates, and did invest Arthurwith the crown of the realm. At that time Arthur was a youth of fifteen years,of a courage and generosity beyond compare, whereunto his inborn goodness didlend such grace as that he was beloved of well-nigh all the peoples in the land.After he had been invested with the ensigns of royalty, he abided by his ancientwont, and was so prodigal of his bounties as that he began to run short ofwherewithal to distribute amongst the huge multitude of knights that made repairunto him. But he that hath within him a bountiful nature along with prowess,albeit that he be lacking for a time, natheless in no wise shall poverty be hisbane for ever. Wherefore did Arthur, for that in him did valour keep companywith largesse, make resolve to harry the Saxons, to the end that with theirtreasure he might make rich the retainers that were of his own household. Andherein was he monished of his own lawful right, seeing that of right ought he tohold the sovereignty of the whole island in virtue of his claim hereditary.Assembling, therefore, all the youth that were of his allegiance, he made firstfor York. And when Colgrin was ware of this, he got together his Saxons, Scots,and Picts, and came with a mighty multitude to meet him nigh the river Douglas,where, by the time the battle came to an end, the more part of both armies hadbeen put to the sword. Natheless, Arthur won the day, and after pursingColgrin's flight as far as York, did beleaguer him within that city. Thereupon,Baldulf, hearing of his brother's flight, made for the besieged city with sixthousand men to relieve him. For, at the time his brother had fought the battle,he himself was upon the seacoast awaiting the arrival of Duke Cheldric, who wasjust coining from Germany to their assistance. And when he had come within tenmiles of the city, he was resolved to make a night march and fall upon them bysurprise. Howbeit, Arthur was ware of his purpose, and bade Cador, Duke ofCornwall, go meet him that same night with six hundred horse and three thousandfoot. He, choosing a position on the road whereby the enemy were bound to march,surprised them by an assault on the sudden, and cutting up and slaying theSaxons, drave Baldulf off in flight. Baldulf, distressed beyond measure that hecould convey no succour to his brother, took counsel with himself in what wisehe might have speech of%him, for he weened that so he might get at him, they might together devise someshift for the safety of them both. Failing all other means of access unto him,he shaved off his hair and his beard, and did upon him the habit of a jongleurwith a ghittern, and walking to and fro within the camp, made show as had hebeen a minstrel singing unto the tunes that he thrummed the while upon hisghittern. And, for that none suspected him, by little and little he drew nighunto the walls of the city, ever keeping up the disguise he had taken upon him.At last he was found out by some of the besieged, who thereupon drew him up withcords over the wall into the city and brought him unto his brother, who,overjoyed at the sight of him, greeted him with kisses and embraces. At last,after talking over every kind of shift, when they had fallen utterly intodespair of ever issuing forth, the messengers they had sent into Germanyreturned, bringing with them unto Scotland six hundred ships full of stoutwarriors under Duke Cheldric; and when Arthur's counsellors heard tell of theircoming, they advised him to hold the leaguer no longer, for that sore hazardwould it be to do battle with so mighty a multitude of enemies as had nowarrived.CHAPTER 2Arthur, therefore, in obedience to the counsel of his retainers, retired himinto the city of London. Hither he summoned all the clergy and chief men of hisallegiance and bade them declare their counsel as to what were best and safestfor him to do against this inroad of the Paynim. At last, by common consent ofthem all, messengers are sent unto King Hoel in Brittany with tidings of thecalamitous estate of Britain. For Hoel was sister's son unto Arthur, born untoBudicius, King of the Bretons. Where, so soon as he heard of the invasionwherewith his uncle was threatened he bade fit out his fleet, and musteringfifteen thousand men-at-arms, made for Southampton with the first fair wind.Arthur received him with all honour due, and the twain embraced the one theother over and over again.CHAPTER 3A few days later they set forth for the city of Kaerliudcoit, then besieged bythe Paynim already mentioned, the which city lieth upon a hill betwixt tworivers in the province of Lindsey, and is otherwise called Lincoln. Accordingly,when they had come thither with their whole host, they did battle with theSaxons and routed them with no common slaughter, for upon that day fell sixthousand of them, some part drowned in the rivers and some part smitten ofdeadly weapons. The residue, in dismay, forsook the siege and fled, but Arthurstinted not in pursuit until they had reached the forest of Caledon, whereinthey assembled again after the fight and did their best to make a stand againsthim. When the battle began, they wrought sore havoc amongst the Britons,defending themselves like men, and avoiding the arrows of the Britons in theshelter afforded by the trees. When Arthur espied this he bade the trees aboutthat part of the forest be felled, and the trunks set in a compass around themin such wise asthat all ways of issuing forth were shut against them, for he was minded tobeleaguer them therein until they should be starven to death of hunger. Thisdone, he bade his companies patrol the forest, and abode in that same placethree days. Whereupon the Saxons, lacking all victual and famishing to death,besought leave to issue forth upon convenant that they would leave all theirgold and silver behind them so they might return unto Germany with nought buttheir ships only. They promised further to give them tribute from Germany and toleave hostages for the payment thereof. Arthur, taking counsel thereupon, agreedunto their petition, retaining all their treasure and the hostages for paymentof the tribute, and granting only unto them bare permission to depart.Natheless, whilst that they were ploughing the seas as they returned homeward,it repented them of the covenant they had made, and tacking about, they returnedinto Britain, making the shore at Totnes. Taking possession of the country, theydevastated the land as far as the Severn sea, slaying the husbandmen with deadlywounds. Marching forth from thence they made for the country about Bath andbesieged that city. When word of this was brought unto the King, astonied beyondmeasure at their wicked daring, he bade judgment be done upon their hostages andhanged them out of hand, and, abandoning the expedition whereby he intended torepress the Picts and Scots, hurried away to disperse the leaguer. Howbeit, thatwhich did most sorely grieve him in this strait was that he was compelled toleave his nephew Hoel behind him lying sick in the city of Dumbarton. When atlast he arrived in the province of Somerset, and beheld the leaguer nigh athand, he spake in these words: \"For that these Saxons, of most impious andhateful name, have disdained to keep faith with me, I, keeping my faith unto myGod, will endeavour me this day to revenge upon them the blood of my countrymen.To arms, therefore, ye warriors, to arms, and fall upon yonder traitors likemen, for, of a certainty, by Christ's succour, we cannot fail of victory!\"CHAPTER 4When he had thus spoken, the holy Dubric, Archbishop of Caerleon, went up on tothe top of a certain mount and cried out with a loud voice:\"Ye men that be known from these others by your Christian profession, take heedye bear in mind the piety ye owe unto your country and unto yourfellow-countrymen, whose slaughter by the treachery of the Paynim shall be untoye a disgrace everlasting save ye press hardily forward to defend them. Fight yetherefore for your country, and if it be that death overtake ye, suffer itwillingly for your country's sake, for death itself is victory and a healingunto the soul, inasmuch as he that shall have died for his brethren doth offerhimself a living sacrifice unto God, nor is it doubtful that herein he dothfollow in the footsteps of Christ who disdained not to lay down His own soul forHis brethren. Whosoever, therefore, amongst ye shall be slain in this battle,unto him shall that death be as full penance and absolution of all his sins, ifso be he receive it willingly on this wise.\"Forthwith, thus cheered by the benison of the blessed man, each one hastened toarm him to do his bidding, and Arthur himself doing upon him a habergeon worthyof a king so noble, did set upon his head a helm of gold graven with thesemblance of a dragon. Upon his shoulders, moreover, did he bear the shield thatwas named Pridwen, wherein, upon the inner side, was painted the image of holyMary, Mother of God, that many a time and oft did call her back unto his memory.Girt was he also with Caliburn, best of swords, that was forged within the Isleof Avallon; and the lance that did grace his right hand was called by the nameRon, a tall lance and a stout, full meet to do slaughter withal. Then,stationing his companies, he made hardy assault upon the Saxons that after theirwont were ranked wedge-wise in battalions. Natheless, all day long did theystand their ground manfully maugre the Britons that did deliver assault uponassault against them. At last, just verging upon sundown, the Saxons occupied ahill close by that might serve them for a camp, for, secure in their numbers,the hill alone seemed all the camp they needed. But when the morrow's sunbrought back the day, Arthur with his army clomb up to the top of the hill,albeit that in the ascent he lost many of his men. For the Saxons, dashing downfrom the height, had the better advantage in dealing their wounds, whilst theycould also run far more swiftly down the hill than he could struggle up.Howbeit, putting forth their utmost strength, the Britons did at last reach thetop, and forthwith close with the enemy hand to hand. The Saxons, fronting themwith their broad chests, strive with all their endeavour to stand their ground.And when much of the day had been spent on this wise, Arthur waxed wroth at thestubbornness of their resistance, and the slowness of his own advance, anddrawing forth Caliburn, his sword, crieth aloud the name of Holy Mary, andthrusteth him forward with a swift onset into the thickest press of the enemy'sranks. Whomsoever he touched, calling upon God, he slew at a single blow, nordid he once slacken in his onslaught until that he had slain four hundred andseventy men singlehanded with his sword Caliburn. This when the Britons beheld,they followed him up in close rank dealing slaughter on every side. Colgrin andBaldulf his brother fell amongst the first, and many thousands fell besides.Howbeit, as soon as Cheldric saw the jeopardy of his fellows, he turned to fleeaway.CHAPTER 5The King having won the victory, bade Cador, Duke of Cornwall, pursue the enemy,while he himself hastened his march into Scotland, for word had thence beenbrought him that the Scots and Picts were besieging Hoel in the city ofDumbarton, wherein, as I have said, he was lying afflicted of grievous sickness,and sore need it was he should come swiftly to his succour lest he should betaken by the barbarians along with the city. The Duke of Cornwall, accordingly,accompanied by ten thousand men, was not minded, in the first place, to pursuethe fleeing Saxons, deeming it better to make all speed to get hold of theirships and thus forbid their embarking therein. As soon as he had takenpossession of the ships, he manned them with his best soldiers, who could betrusted to takeheed that no Paynim came aboard, in case they should flee unto them to escape.Then he made best haste to obey Arthur's orders by following up the enemy andslaying all he overtook without mercy. Whereupon they, who but just now hadfallen upon the Britons with the all fury of a thunderbolt, straightway sneakoff, faint of heart, some into the depths of the forest, others into themountains and caves, any whither so only they may live yet a little longer. Atlast, when they found all shelter failing, they march their shattered companiesinto the Isle of Thanet. Thither the Duke of Cornwall follows hard upon theirheels, smiting them down without mercy as was his wont; nor did he stay his handuntil after Cheldric had been slain. He compelled them to give hostages for thesurrender of the whole residue.CHAPTER 6Having thus established peace, he marched towards Dumbarton, which Arthur hadalready delivered from the oppression of the barbarians. He next led his armyinto Moray, where the Scots and Picts were beleaguered, for after they hadthrice been defeated in battle by Arthur and his nephew they had fled into thatprovince. When they had reached Loch Lomond, they occupied the islands that betherein, thinking to find safe refuge; for this lake doth contain sixty islandsand receiveth sixty rivers, albeit that but a single stream doth flow fromthence unto the sea. Upon these islands are sixty rocks plain to be seen,whereof each one doth bear an eyrie of eagles that there congregating year byyear do notify any prodigy that is to come to pass in the kingdom by uttering ashrill scream all together in concert. Unto these islands accordingly the enemyhad fled in order to avail them of the protection of the lake. But small profitreaped they thereby, for Arthur collected a fleet and went round about theinlets of the rivers for fifteen days together, and did so beleaguer them asthat they were famished to death of hunger by thousands. And whilst that he wasserving them out on this wise arrived Gillamaur, King of Ireland, with a mightyhost of barbarians in a fleet, to bring succour unto the wretched islanders.Whereupon Arthur left off the leaguer and began to turn his arms against theIrish, whom he forced to return unto their own country, cut to pieces withoutmercy. When he had won the victory, he again gave all his thoughts to doing awayutterly the race of the Scots and Picts, and yielded him to treating them with acruelty beyond compare. Not a single one that he could lay hands on did hespare, insomuch as that at last all the bishops of the miserable countryassembled together with all the clergy of their obedience, and came unto himbarefoot, bearing relics of the saints and the sacred objects of the church,imploring the King's mercy for the safety of their people. As soon as they cameinto his presence, they prayed him on their bended knees to have pity on thedown-trodden folk, for that he has visited them with pains and penalties enow,nor was any need to cut off the scanty few that still survived to the last man.Some petty portion of the country he might allot unto them whereon they might beallowed to bear the yoke ofperpetual bondage, for this were they willing to do. And when they had besoughtthe King on this wise, he was moved unto tears for very pity, and, agreeing untothe petition of the holy men, granted them his pardon.CHAPTER 12When the high festival of Whitsuntide began to draw nigh, Arthur, filled withexceeding great joy at having achieved so great success, was fain to hold highcourt, and to set the crown of the kingdom upon his head, to convene the Kingsand Dukes that were his vassals to the festival so that he might the moreworshipfully celebrate the same, and renew his peace more firmly amongst hisbarons. Howbeit, when he made known his desire unto his familiars, he, by theircounsel, made choice of Caerleon wherein to fulfil his design. For, situate in apassing pleasant position on the river Usk in Glamorgan, not far from the Severnsea, and abounding in wealth above all other cities, it was the place most meetfor so high a solemnity. For on the one side thereof flowed the noble riveraforesaid whereby the Kings and Princes that should come from oversea might beborne thither in their ships; and on the other side, girdled about with meadowsand woods, passing fair was the magnificence of the kingly palaces thereof withthe gilded verges of the roofs that imitated Rome. Howbeit, the chiefest gloriesthereof where the two churches, one raised in honour of the Martyr Julius, thatwas right fair graced by a convent of virgins that had dedicated them unto God,and the second, founded in the name of the blessed Aaron, his companion, themain pillars whereof were a brotherhood of canons regular, and this was thecathedral church of the third Metropolitan See of Britain. It had, moreover, aschool of two hundred philosophers learned in astronomy and in the other arts,that did diligently observe the courses of the stars, and did by true inferencesforetell the prodigies which at that time were about to befall unto King Arthur.Such was the city, famed for such abundance of things delightsome, that was nowbusking her for the festival that had been proclaimed. Messengers were sentforth into the divers kingdoms, and all that owed allegiance throughout theGauls and the neighbour islands were invited unto the court. Came accordinglyAngusel, King of Albany, that is now called Scotland; Urian, King of them ofMoray; Cadwallo Lawirh, King of the Venedotians, that now be called the NorthWelsh; Stater, King of the Demeti, that is, of the South Welsh; Cador, King ofCornwell; the Archbishops of the three Metropolitan Sees, to wit, of London andYork, and Dubric of Caerleon. He, Primate of Britain and Legate of the ApostolicSee, was of so meritorious a piety that he could make whole by his prayers anythat lay oppressed of any malady. Came also the Earls of noble cities; Morvid,Earl of Gloucester; Mauron of Worcester; Anaraut of Salisbury; Arthgal ofCargueir, that is now called Warwick; Jugein from Leicester; Cursalem fromCaichester; Kimmarc, Duke of Canterbury; Galluc of Salisbury; Urbgennius fromBath; Jonathal of Doreset; Boso of Rhydychen, that is Oxford. Besides the Earlscame champions of no lesser dignity, Donaut map Papo; Cheneus mapCoil; Peredur map Eridur; Grifuz map Nogoid; Regin map Claud; Eddelein mapCledauc; Kincar map Bangan; Kimmarc; Gorbonian map Goit; Clofaut; Run map Neton;Kimbelin map Trunat; Cathleus map Catel; Kinlith map Neton, and many anotherbeside, the names whereof be too long to tell. From the neighbour islands camelikewise Gillamaur, King of Ireland; Malvasius, King of Iceland; Doldavius, Kingof Gothland; Gunvasius, King of the Orkneys; Loth, King of Norway; Aschil, Kingof the Danes. From the parts oversea came also Holdin, King of Flanders;Leodegar, Earl of Boulogne; Bedevere the Butler, Duke of Normandy; Borel ofMaine; Kay the Seneschal, Duke of Anjou; Guitard of Poi-tou; the Twelve Peers ofthe Gauls whom Guerin of Chartres brought with him; Hoel, Duke of Brittany, withthe Barons of his allegiance, who marched along with such magnificence ofequipment in trappings and mules and horses as may not easily be told. Besidesall these, not a single Prince of any price on this side Spain remained at homeand came not upon the proclamation. And no marvel, for Arthur's bounty was ofcommon report throughout the whole wide world, and all men for his sake werefain to come.CHAPTER 13When all at last were assembled in the city on the high day of the festival, thearchbishops were conducted unto the palace to crown the King with the royaldiadem. Dubric, therefore, upon whom the charge fell, for that the court washeld within his diocese, was ready to celebrate the service. As soon as the Kinghad been invested with the ensigns of kingship, he was led in right comely wiseto the church of the Metropolitan See, two archbishops supporting him, the oneupon his right hand side the other upon his left. Four Kings, moreover, to wit,those of Scotland, Cornwall, and North and South Wales, went before him, bearingbefore him, as was their right, four golden swords. A company of clerics in holyorders of every degree went chanting music marvellous sweet in front. Of theother party, the archbishops and pontiffs led the Queen, crowned with laurel andwearing her own ensigns, unto the church of the virgins dedicate. The fourQueens, moreover, of the four Kings already mentioned, did bear before heraccording to wont and custom four white doves, and the ladies that were presentdid follow after her rejoicing greatly. At last, when the procession was over,so manifold was the music of the organs and so many were the hymns that werechanted in both churches, that the knights who were there scarce knew whichchurch they should enter first for the exceeding sweetness of the harmonies inboth. First into the one and then into the other they flocked in crowds, nor,had the whole day been given up to the celebration, would any have felt amoment's weariness thereof. And when the divine services had been celebrated inboth churches, the King and Queen put off their crowns, and doing on lighterrobes of state, went to meat, he to his palace with the men, she to anotherpalace with the women. For the Britons did observe the ancient custom of theTrojans, and were wont to celebrate their high festival days, the men with themen and the women with the women severally. And when all were set at tableaccording as the rank ofeach did demand, Kay the Seneschal, in a doublet furred of ermines, and athousand youths of full high degree in his company, all likewise clad inermines, did serve the meats along with him. Of the other part, as many indoublets furred of vair did follow Bedevere the Butler, and along with him didserve the drinks from the divers ewers into the manifold-fashioned cups. In thepalace of the Queen no less did numberless pages, clad in divers brave liveries,offer their service each after his office, the which were I to go about todescribe I might draw out my history into an endless prolixity. For at that timewas Britain exalted unto so high a pitch of dignity as that it did surpass allother kingdoms in plenty of riches, in luxury of adornment, and in the courteouswit of them that dwelt therein. Whatsoever knight in the land was of renown forhis prowess did wear his clothes and his arms all of one same colour. And thedames, no less witty, would apparel them in like manner in a single colour, norwould they deign have the love of none save he had thrice approved him in thewars. Wherefore at that time did dames wax chaste and knights the nobler fortheir love.King Arthur and His KnightsSIR THOMAS MALORYSir Thomas Malory, who died in the year 1472, was the last medieval romancewriter. Malory was a knight who spent most of his life in prison for pettycrimes and vandalism. In King Arthur and His Knights, Malory attempts to bringtogether and synthesize all the legends surrounding Arthur. It is a magnificentwork. These selections recount the birth, the rise to power, and the death ofArthur. The first selection, \"Merlin,\" covers much of the same material coveredby Geoffrey of Monmouth. The second selection, \"The Day of Destiny,\" recountsthe theme that Arthur will come again.MERLINIt befell in the days of Uther Pendragon, when he was king of all England and soreigned, that there was a mighty duke in Cornwall that held war against him longtime, and the duke was called the duke of Tintagel. And so by means King Uthersent for this duke, charging him to bring his wife with him, for she was calleda fair lady and a passing wise, and her name was called Igraine. So when theduke and his wife were come unto the king, by the means of great lords they wereaccorded both. The king liked and loved this lady well, andhe made them great cheer out of measure, and desired to have lain by her. Butshe was a passing good woman and would not assent unto the king. And then shetold the duke her husband, and said,\"I suppose that we were sent for that I should be dishonoured. Wherefore,husband, I counsel you that we depart from hence suddenly, that we may ride allnight unto our own castle.\"And in like wise as she said so they departed, that neither the king nor none ofhis council were ware of their departing. Also soon as King Uther knew of theirdeparting so suddenly, he was wonderly wroth; then he called to him his privycouncil and told them of the sudden departing of the duke and his wife. Thenthey advised the king to send for the duke and his wife by a great charge:\"And if he will not come at your summons, then may ye do your best; then have yecause to make mighty war upon him.\"So that was done, and the messengers had their answers; and that was this,shortly, that neither he nor his wife would not come at him. Then was the kingwonderly wroth; and then the king sent him plain word again and bade him beready and stuffhim and garnish him, for within forty days he would fetch him outof the biggest castle that he hath.When the duke had this warning, anon he went and furnished and garnished twostrong castles of his, of the which the one hight Tintagel, and the other castlehight Terrabil. So his wife Dame Igraine he put in the castle of Tintagel, andhimself he put in the castle of Terrabil, the which had many issues and posternsout. Then in all haste came Uther with a great host and laid a siege about thecastle of Terrabil, and there he pight many pavilions. And there was great warmade on both parties and much people slain.Then for pure anger and for great love of fair Igraine the king Uther fell sick.So came to the King Uther Sir Ulfius, a noble knight, and asked the king why hewas sick.\"I shall tell thee,\" said the king, \"I am sick for anger and for love of fairIgraine, that I may not be whole.\"\"Well, my lord,\" said Sir Ulfius, \"I shall seek Merlin and he shall do youremedy, that your heart shall be pleased.\"So Ulfius departed and by adventure he met Merlin in a beggar's array, and thereMerlin asked Ulfius whom he sought, and he said he had little ado to tell him.\"Well,\" said Merlin, \"I know whom thou seekest, for thou seekest Merlin;therefore seek no farthe \\ for I am he. And if King Uther will well reward meand be sworn unto me to fulfil my desire, that shall be his honour and profitmore than mine, for I shall cause him to have all his desire.\"\"All this will I undertake,\" said Ulfius, \"that there shall be nothingreasonable but thou shalt have thy desire.\"\"Well,\" said Merlin, \"he shall have his intent and desire. Arid therefore,\" saidMerlin, \"ride on your way, for I will not be long behind.\"Then Ulfius was glad and rode on more than a pace till that he came to KingUther Pendragon and told him he had met with Merlin.\"Where is he?\" said the king.\"Sir,\" said Ulfius, 'he will not dwell long.\"Therewithal Ulfius was ware where Merlin stood at the porch of the pavilion'sdoor, and then Merlin was bound to come to the king. When King Uther saw him hesaid he was welcome.\"Sir,\" said Merlin, \"I know all your heart every deal. So ye will be sworn untome, as ye be a true king anointed, to fulfil my desire, ye shall have yourdesire.\"Then the king was sworn upon the four Evangelists.\"Sir,\" said Merlin, \"this is my desire: the first night that ye shall lie byIgraine ye shall get a child on her; and when that is born, that it shall bedelivered to me for to nourish thereas I will have it; for it shall be yourworship and the child's avail as mickle as the child is worth.\"\"I will well,\" said the king, \"as thou wilt have it.\"\"Now make you ready,\" said Merlin. \"This night ye shall lie with Igraine in thecastle of Tintagel. And ye shall be like the duke her husband, Ulfius shall belike Sir Brastias, a knight of the duke's, and I will be like a knight thathight Sir Jordanus, a knight of the duke's. But wait ye make not many questionswith her nor her men, but say ye are diseased, and so hie you to bed and risenot on the morn till I come to you, for the castle of Tintagel is but ten milehence.\"So this was done as they devised. But the duke of Tintagel espied how the kingrode from the siege of Terrabil. And therefore that night he issued out of thecastle at a postern for to have distressed the king's host, and so through hisown issue the duke himself was slain or ever the king came at the castle ofTintagel. So after the death of the duke King Uther lay with Igraine, more thanthree hours after his death, and begat on her that night Arthur; and or daycame, Merlin came to the king and bade him make him ready, and so he kissed thelady Igraine and departed in all haste. But when the lady heard tell of the dukeher husband, and by all record he was dead or ever King Uther came to her, thenshe marvelled who that might be that lay with her in likeness of her lord. Soshe mourned privily and held her peace.Then all the barons by one assent prayed the king of accord betwixt the ladyIgraine and him. The king gave them leave, for fain would he have been accordedwith her; so the king put all the trust in Ulfius to entreat between them. So bythe entreaty at the last the king and she met together.\"Now will we do well,\" said Ulfius. \"Our king is a lusty knight and wifeless,and my lady Igraine is a passing fair lady; it were great joy unto us all an itmight please the king to make her his queen.\"Unto that they all well accorded and moved it to the king. And anon, like alusty knight, he assented thereto with good will, and so in all haste they weremarried in a morning with great mirth and joy.And King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney then wedded Margawse that was Gawain'smother, and King Nentres of the land of Garlot wedded Elaine. All this was doneat the request of King Uther. And the third sister, Morgan le Fay, was put toschool in a nunnery, and there she learned so much that she was a great clerk ofnecromancy. And after she was wedded to King Uriens of the land of Gore, thatwas Sir Ywain le Blanchemain's father.Then Queen Igraine waxed daily greater and greater. So it befell after withinhalf a year, as King Uther lay by his queen, he asked her, by the faith sheowed to him, whose was the child within her body. Then was she sore abashed togive answer.\"Dismay you not,\" said the king, \"but tell me the truth, and I shall love youthe better, by the faith of my body!\"\"Sir,\" said she, \"I shall tell you the truth. The same night that my lord wasdead, the hour of his death, as his knights record, there came into my castle ofTintagel a man like my lord in speech and in countenance, and two knights withhim in likeness of his two knights Brastias and Jordanus, and so I went unto bedwith him as I ought to do with my lord; and the same night, as I shall answerunto God, this child was begotten upon me.\"\"That is truth,\" said the king, \"as ye say, for it was I myself that came in thelikeness. And therefore dismay you not, for I am father of the child;\" and therehe told her all the cause how it was by Merlins counsel. Then the queen madegreat joy when she knew who was the father of her child.Soon came Merlin unto the king and said,\"Sir, ye must purvey you for the nourishing of your child.\"\"As thou wilt,\" said the king, \"be it.\"\"Well,\" said Merlin, \"I know a lord of yours in this land that is a passing trueman and a faithful, and he shall have the nourishing of your child; and his nameis Sir Ector, and he is a lord of fair livelihood in many parts in England andWales. And this lord, Sir Ector, let him be sent for for to come and speak withyou, and desire him yourself, as he loveth you, that he will put his own childto nourishing to another woman and that his wife nourish yours. And when thechild is born let it be delivered to me at yonder privy postern unchristened.\"So like as Merlin devised it was done. And when Sir Ector was come he madefiaunce to the king for to nourish the child like as the king desired; and therethe king granted Sir Ector great rewards. Then when the lady was delivered theking commanded two knights and two ladies to take the child bound in a cloth ofgold, \"and that ye deliver him to what poor man ye meet at the postern gate ofthe castle.\" So the child was delivered unto Merlin, and so he bare it forthunto Sir Ector, and made an holy man to christen him, and named him Arthur. Andso Sir Ector's wife nourished him with her own pap.Then within two years King Uther fell sick of a great malady. And in themeanwhile his enemies usurped upon him and did a great battle upon his men andslew many of his people.\"Sir,\" said Merlin, \"ye may not lie so as ye do, for ye must to the field,though ye ride on an horse-litter. For ye shall never have the better of yourenemies but if your person be there, and then shall ye have the victory.\""},{"pageContent":"So it was done as Merlin had devised, and they carried the king forth in anhorse-litter with a great host towards his enemies, and at St. Albans there metwith the king a great host of the North. And that day Sir Ulfius and SirBrastias did great deeds of arms, and King Uther's men overcame the Northernbattle and slew many people and put the remnant to flight; and then the kingreturned unto London and made great joy of his victory.And then he fell passing sore sick, so that three days and three nights he wasspeechless; wherefore all the barons made great sorrow and asked Merlin whatcounsel were best.\"There is none other remedy,\" said Merlin, \"but God will have His will. But lookye all barons be before King Uther to-morn, and God and I shall make him tospeak.\"So on the morn all the barons with Merlin came tofore the king. Then Merlin saidaloud unto King Uther,\"Sir, shall your son Arthur be king after your days of this realm with all theappurtenance?\"Then Uther Pendragon turned him and said in hearing of them all,\"I give him God's blessing and mine, and bid him pray for my soul, andrighteously and worshipfully that he claim the crown upon forfeiture of myblessing;\" and therewith he yielded up the ghost. And then was he interred aslonged to a king, wherefore the queen, fair Igraine, made great sorrow, and allthe barons.Then stood the realm in great jeopardy long while, for every lord that wasmighty of men made him strong, and many weened to have been king. Then Merlinwent to the Archbishop of Canterbury and counselled him for to send for all thelords of the realm and all the gentlemen of arms, that they should to Londoncome by Christmas upon pain of cursing, and for this cause, that Jesu, that wasborn on that night, that He would of His great mercy show some miracle, as Hewas come to be King of mankind, for to show some miracle who should be rightwiseking of this realm. So the Archbishop, by the advice of Merlin, sent for all thelords and gentlemen of arms that they should come by Christmas even unto London;and many of them made them clean of their life, that their prayer might be themore acceptable unto God.So in the greatest church of London, whether it were Paul's or not the Frenchbook maketh no mention, all the estates were long or day in the church for topray. And when matins and the first mass was done there was seen in thechurchyard, against the high altar, a great stone four square, like unto amarble stone, and in midst thereof was like an anvil of steel a foot on high,and therein stuck a fair sword naked by the point, and letters there werewritten in gold about the sword that said thus: \"whoso pulleth out this sword ofthisSTONE AND ANVIL IS RIGHTWISE KING RORN OF ALL ENGLAND.\" Then the peoplemarvelled and told it to the Archbishop.\"I command,\" said the Archbishop, \"that ye keep you within your church and prayunto God still; that no man touch the sword till the high mass be all done.\"So when all masses were done all the lords went to behold the stone and thesword. And when they saw the scripture some essayed, such as would have beenking, but none might stir the sword nor move it.\"He is not here,\" said the Archbishop, \"that shall achieve the sword, but doubtnot God will make him known. But this is my counsel,\" said the Archbishop, \"thatwe let purvey ten knights, men of good fame, and they to keep this sword.\"So it was ordained, and then there was made a cry that every man should essaythat would for to win the sword. And upon New Year's Day the barons let make ajousts and a tournament, that all knights that would joust or tourney theremight play. And all this was ordained for to keep the lords together and the394 Sir Thomas Malorycommons, for the Archbishop trusted that God would make him known that shouldwin the sword.So upon New Year's Day, when the service was done, the barons rode unto thefield, some to joust and some to tourney. And so it happed that Sir Ector, thathad great livelihood about London, rode unto the jousts, and with him rode SirKay, his son, and young Arthur that was his nourished brother; and Sir Kay wasmade knight at All Hallowmass afore. So as they rode to the jousts-ward Sir Kayhad lost his sword, for he had left it at his father's lodging, and so he prayedyoung Arthur for to ride for his sword.\"I will well,\" said Arthur, and rode fast after the sword.And when he came home the lady and all were out to see the jousting. Then wasArthur wroth, and said to himself, \"I will ride to the churchyard and take thesword with me that sticketh in the stone, for my brother Sir Kay shall not bewithout a sword this day.\" So when he came to the churchyard Sir Arthur alightand tied his horse to the stile, and so he went to the tent and found no knightsthere, for they were at the jousting. And so he handled the sword by thehandles, and lightly and fiercely pulled it out of the stone, and took his horseand rode his way until he came to his brother Sir Kay and delivered him thesword.And as soon as Sir Kay saw the sword he wist well it was the sword of the stone,and so he rode to his father Sir Ector and said,\"Sir, lo here is the sword of the stone, wherefore I must be king of this land.\"When Sir Ector beheld the sword he returned again and came to the church, andthere they alight all three and went into the church, and anon he made Sir Kayto swear upon a book how he came to that sword.\"Sir,\" said Sir Kay, \"by my brother Arthur, for he brought it to me.\"\"How gat ye this sword?\" said Sir Ector to Arthur.\"Sir, I will tell you. When I came home for my brother's sword I found nobody athome to deliver me his sword, and so I thought my brother Sir Kay should not beswordless, and so I came hither eagerly and pulled it out of the stone withoutany pain.\"\"Found ye any knights about this sword?\" said Sir Ector.\"Nay,\" said Arthur.\"Now,\" said Sir Ector to Arthur, \"I understand ye must be king of this land.\"\"Wherefore I?\" said Arthur, \"and for what cause?\"\"Sir,\" said Ector, \"for God will have it so, for there should never man havedrawn out this sword but he that shall be rightwise king of this land. Now letme see whether ye can put the sword thereas it was and pull it out again.\"\"That is no mastery,\" said Arthur, and so he put it in the stone. TherewithalSir Ector essayed to pull out the sword and failed.\"Now essay,\" said Sir Ector unto Sir Kay. And anon he pulled at the sword withall his might, but it would not be.\"Now shall ye essay,\" said Sir Ector to Arthur.\"I will well,\" said Arthur, and pulled it out easily.And therewithal Sir Ector kneeled down to the earth and Sir Kay.\"Alas!\" said Arthur, \"my own dear father and brother, why kneel ye to me?\"\"Nay, nay, my lord Arthur, it is not so. I was never your father nor of yourblood, but I wot well ye are of an higher blood than I weened ye were,\" and thenSir Ector told him all, how he was betaken him for to nourish him and by whosecommandment, and by Merlin's deliverance.Than Arthur made great dole when he understood that Sir Ector was not hisfather.\"Sir,\" said Ector unto Arthur, \"will ye be my good and gracious lord when ye areking?\"\"Else were I to blame,\" said Arthur, \"for ye are the man in the world that I ammost beholding to, and my good lady and mother your wife that as well as her ownhath fostered me and kept. And if ever it be God's will that I be king as yesay, ye shall desire of me what I may do, and I shall not fail you. God forbid Ishould fail you.\"\"Sir,\" said Sir Ector, \"I will ask no more of you but that ye will make my son,your foster brother Sir Kay. seneschal of all your lands.\"\"That shall be done.\" said Arthur, \"and more, by the faith of my body, thatnever man shall have that office but he while he and I live.\"Therewithal they went unto the Archbishop and told him how the sword wasachieved and by whom. And on Twelfth-day all the barons came thither and toessay to take the sword who that would essay, but there afore them all theremight none take it out but Arthur. Wherefore there were many lords wroth, andsaid it was great shame unto them all and the realm to be overgoverned with aboy of no high blood born. And so they fell out at that time, that it was putoff till Candlemas, and then all the barons should meet there again; but alwaysthe ten knights were ordained to watch the sword day and night, and so they seta pavilion over the stone and the sword, and five always watched.So at Candlemas many more great lords came hither for to have won the sword, butthere might none prevail. And right as Arthur did at Christmas he did atCandlemas, and pulled out the sword easily, whereof the barons were soreaggrieved and put it off in delay till the high feast of Easter. And as Arthursped afore so did he at Easter. Yet there were some of the great lords hadindignation that Arthur should be king, and put it off in a delay till the feastof Pentecost. Then the Archbishop of Canterbury, by Merlin's providence, letpurvey then of the best knights that they might get, and such knights as UtherPendragon loved best and most trusted in his days, and such knights were putabout Arthur as Sir Baudwin of Britain, Sir Kaynes, Sir Ulfius, Sir Brastias;all these with many other were always about Arthur day and night till the feastof Pentecost.And at the feast of Pentecost all manner of men essayed to pull at the swordthat would essay, but none might prevail but Arthur, and he pulled it out aforeall the lords and commons that were there. Wherefore all the commons cried atonce,\"We will have Arthur unto our king! We will put him no more in delay, for we allsee that it is God's will that he shall be our king, and who that holdethagainst it we will slay him!\"And therewithal they kneeled at once, both rich and poor, and cried Arthur mercybecause they had delayed him so long. And Arthur forgave them. and took thesword between both his hands and offered it upon the altar where the Archbishopwas, and so was he made knight of the best man that was there.396 Sir Thomas MaloryAnd so anon was the coronation made, and there was he sworn unto his lords andthe commons for to be a true king, to stand with true justice from thenceforththe days of this life. Also then he made all lords that held of the crown tocome in and to do service as they ought to. And many complaints were made untoSir Arthur of great wrongs that were done since the death of King Uther, of manylands that were bereaved lords, knights, ladies, and gentlemen; wherefore KingArthur made the lands to be given again unto them that ought them.When this was done, that the king had stablished all the countries about London,then he let make Sir Kay seneschal of England; and Sir Baudwin of Britain wasmade constable, and Sir Ulfius was made chamberlain, and Sir Brastias was madewarden to wait upon the North from Trent forwards, for it was that time the mostparty the king's enemies. But within few years after Arthur won all the North,Scotland and all that were under their obeissance, also Wales. A part of it heldagainst Arthur, but he overcame them all as he did the remnant, through thenoble prowess of himself and his knights of the Round Table.THE DAY OF DESTINYAs Sir Mordred was ruler of all England, he let make letters as though that theyhad come from beyond the sea, and the letters specified that King Arthur wasslain in battle with Sir Lancelot. Wherefore Sir Mordred made a parliament, andcalled the lords together, and there he made them to choose him king. And so washe crowned at Canterbury, and held a feast there fifteen days.And afterward he drew him unto Winchester, and there he took Queen Guinevere,and said plainly that he would wed her (which was his uncle's wife and hisfather's wife). And so he made ready for the feast, and a day prefixed that theyshould be wedded; wherefore Queen Guinevere was passing heavy, but spake fair,and agreed to Sir Mordred's will.And anon she desired of Sir Mordred to go to London to buy all manner thingsthat longed to the bridal. And because of her fair speech Sir Mordred trustedher and gave her leave; and so when she came to London she took the Tower ofLondon and suddenly in all haste possible she stuffed it with all manner ofvictual, and well garnished it with men, and so kept it.And when Sir Mordred wist this he was passing wroth out of measure. And shorttale to make, he laid a mighty siege about the Tower and made many assaults, andthrew engines unto them, and shot great guns. But all might not prevail, forQueen Guinevere would never, for fair speech neither for foul, never to trustunto Sir Mordred to come in his hands again.Then came the Bishop of Canterbury, which was a noble clerk and an holy man, andthus he said unto Sir Mordred:\"Sir, what will ye do? Will you first displease God and sithen shame yourselfand all knighthood? For is not King Arthur your uncle, and no farther but yourmother's brother, and upon her he himself begat you, upon his own sister?Therefore how may you wed your own father's wife? And therefore, sir,\" said theBishop, \"leave this opinion, other else I shall curse you with book, bell andcandle.\"\"Do thou thy worst,\" said Sir Mordred, \"and I defy thee!\"\"Sir,\" said the Bishop, \"and wit you well I shall not fear me to do that meought to do. And also ye noise that my lord Arthur is slain, and that is not so,and therefore ye will make a foul work in this land!\"\"Peace, thou false priest!\" said Sir Mordred, \"for an thou chafe me any more, Ishall strike off thy head.\"So the Bishop departed, and did the cursing in the most orgulust wise that mightbe done. And then Sir Mordred sought the Bishop of Canterbury for to have slainhim. Then the Bishop fled, and took part of his goods with him, and went nighunto Glastonbury. And there he was a priest-hermit in a chapel, and lived inpoverty and in holy prayers; for well he understood that mischievous war was athand.Then Sir Mordred sought upon Queen Guinevere by letters and sonds, and by fairmeans and foul means, to have her to come out of the Tower of London; but allthis availed nought, for she answered him shortly, openly and privily, that shehad liefer slay herself than be married with him.Then came there word unto Sir Mordred that King Arthur had araised the siegefrom Sir Lancelot and was coming homeward with a great host to be avenged uponSir Mordred; wherefore Sir Mordred made write writs unto all the barony of thisland, and much people drew unto him. For then was the common voice among themthat with King Arthur was never other life but war and strife, and with SirMordred was great joy and bliss. Thus was King Arthur depraved and evil said of;and many there were that King Arthur had brought up of nought, and given themlands, that might not then say him a good word.Lo ye Englishmen, see ye not what a mischief here was? For he that was the mostking and noblest knight of the world, and most loved the fellowship of nobleknights, and by him they all were upholden, and yet might not these Englishmenhold them content with him. Lo thus was the old custom and the usages of thisland, and men say that we of this land have not yet lost that custom. Alas! thisis a great default of us Englishmen, for there may no thing us please no term.And so fared the people at that time: they were better pleased with Sir Mordredthan they were with the noble King Arthur, and much people drew unto Sir Mordredand said they would abide with him for better and for worse. And so Sir Mordreddrew with a great host to Dover, for there he heard say that King Arthur wouldarrive, and so he thought to beat his own father from his own lands. And themost party of all England held with Sir Mordred, for the people were sonewfangle.And so as Sir Mordred was at Dover with his host, so came King Arthur with agreat navy of ships and galleys and carracks, and there was Sir Mordred readyawaiting upon his landing, to let his own father to land upon the land that hewas king over.And anon King Arthur drew him with his host down by the seaside westward, towardSalisbury. And there was a day assigned betwixt King Arthur and Sir Mordred,that they should meet upon a down beside Salisbury, and not far from theseaside. And this day was assigned on Monday after Trinity Sunday, whereof KingArthur was passing glad that he might be avenged upon Sir Mordred.Then Sir Mordred araised much people about London, for they of Kent, Sussex andSurrey, Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk held the most party with Sir Mordred. Andmany a full noble knight drew unto him and also to the king; but they that lovedSir Lancelot drew unto Sir Mordred.So upon Trinity Sunday at night King Arthur dreamed a wonderful dream, and inhis dream him seemed that he saw upon a chafflet a chair, and the chair was fastto a wheel, and thereupon sat King Arthur in the richest cloth of gold thatmight be made. And the king thought there was under him, far from him, anhideous deep black water, and therein was all manner of serpents and worms andwild beasts, foul and horrible. And suddenly the king thought that the wheelturned up-so-down, and he fell among the serpents, and every beast took him by alimb. And then the king cried as he lay in his bed, \"Help! help!\"And then knights, squires and yeomen awaked the king, and then he was so amazedthat he wist not where he was. And then so he awaked until it was nigh day, andthen he fell on slumbering again, not sleeping nor thoroughly waking. So theking seemed verily that there came Sir Gawain unto him with a number of fairladies with him. So when King Arthur saw him he said,\"Welcome, my sister's son, I weened ye had been dead. And now I see thee onlive, much am I beholden unto Almighty Jesu. Ah, fair nephew, what been theseladies that hither be come with you?\"\"Sir,\" said Sir Gawain, \"all these be ladies for whom I have foughten for, whenI was man living. And all these are those that I did battle for in righteousquarrels, and God hath given them that grace at their great prayer, because Idid battle for them for their right, that they should bring me hither unto you.Thus much hath given me leave God for to warn you of your death: for an ye fightas to-morn with Sir Mordred, as ye both have assigned, doubt ye not ye shall beslain, and the most party of your people on both parties. And for the greatgrace and goodness that Almighty Jesu hath unto you, and for pity of you andmany more other good men there shall be slain, God hath sent me to you of Hisespecial grace to give you warning that in no wise ye do battle as to-morn, butthat ye take a treatise for a month-day. And proffer you largely, so thatto-morn ye put in a delay. For within a month shall come Sir Lancelot with allhis noble knights, and rescue you worshipfully, and slay Sir Mordred and allthat ever will hold with him.\"Then Sir Gawain and all the ladies vanished, and anon the king called upon hisknights, squires, and yeomen, and charged them mightly to fetch his noble lordsand wise bishops unto him. And when they were come the king told them of hisavision: that Sir Gawain had told him and warned him that an he fought on themorn he should be slain. Then the king commanded Sir Lucan the Butler and hisbrother Sir Bedivere the Bold, with two bishops with them, and charged them inany wise to take a treatise for a month-day with Sir Mordred:\"And spare not, proffer him lands and goods as much as you think reasonable.\"So then they departed and came to Sir Mordred where he had a grim host of anhundred thousand. And there they entreated Sir Mordred long time, and at thelast Sir Mordred was agreed for to have Cornwall and Kent by King Arthur's days;and after that all England, after the days of King Arthur. Then were theycondescended that King Arthur and Sir Mordred should meet betwixt both theirhosts, and every each of them should bring fourteen persons. And so they camewith this word unto Arthur. Then said he,\"I am glad that this is done,\" and so he went into the field.And when King Arthur should depart he warned all his host that an they see anysword drawn, \"look ye come on fiercely and slay that traitor, Sir Mordred, for Iin no wise trust him.\" In like wise Sir Mordred warned his host that \"an ye seeany manner of sword drawn look that ye come on fiercely and so slay all thatever before you standeth, for in no wise I will not trust for this treatise.\"And in the same wise said Sir Mordred unto his host: \"for I know well my fatherwill be avenged upon me.\"And so they met as their pointment was, and were agreed and accorded thoroughly.And wine was fette, and they drank together. Right so came out an adder of alittle heathbush, and it stang a knight in the foot. And so when the knight felthim so stung, he looked down and saw the adder; and anon he drew his sword toslay the adder, and thought none other harm. And when the host on both partiessaw that sword drawn, then they blew beams, trumpets, and horns, and shoutedgrimly, and so both hosts dressed them together. And King Arthur took his horseand said, \"Alas, this unhappy day!\" And so rode to his party, and Sir Mordred inlike wise.And never since was there seen a more dolefuller battle in no Christian land,for there was but rushing and riding, foining and striking, and many a grim wordwas there spoken of either to other, and many a deadly stroke. But ever KingArthur rode throughout the battle of Sir Mordred many times and did full nobly,as a noble king shold do, and at all times he fainted never. And Sir Mordred didhis devour that day and put himself in great peril.And thus they fought all the long day, and never stinted till the noble knightswere laid to the cold earth. And ever they fought still till it was near night,and by then was there an hundred thousand laid dead upon the earth. Then wasKing Arthur wood wroth out of measure, when he saw his people so slain from him.And so he looked about him and could see no mo of all his host, and good knightsleft no mo on live but two knights: the tone was Sir Lucan de Butler and hisbrother, Sir Bedivere; and yet they were full sore wounded.\"Jesu mercy!\" said the king, \"where are all my noble knights become? Alas, thatever I should see this doleful day! For now,\" said King Arthur, \"I am come tomine end. But would to God,\" said he, \"that I wist now where were that traitorSir Mordred that hath caused all this mischief.\"Then King Arthur looked about and was ware where stood Sir Mordred leaning uponhis sword among a great heap of dead men.\"Now, give me my spear,\" said King Arthur unto Sir Lucan, \"for yonder I haveespied the traitor that all this woe hath wrought.\"\"Sir, let him be,\" said Sir Lucan, \"for he is unhappy. And if ye pass thisunhappy day ye shall be right well revenged. And, good lord, remember ye of yournight's dream and what the spirit of Sir Gawain told you to-night, and yet Godof His great goodness hath preserved you hitherto. And for God's sake, mylord, leave off this, for, blessed be God, ye have won the field: for yet webeen here three on live, and with Sir Mordred is not one of live. And therefore,if ye leave off now, this wicked day of Destiny is past!\"\"Now tide me death, tide me life,\" said the king, \"now I see him yonder alone,he shall never escape mine hands! For at a better avail shall I never have him.\"\"God speed you well!\" said Sir Bedivere.Then the king gat his spear in both his hands, and ran toward sir Mordred,crying and saying,\"Traitor, now is thy death-day come!\"And when Sir Mordred saw King Arthur he ran until him with his sword drawn inhis hand, and there King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield with a foinof his spear throughout the body more than a fathom. And when Sir Mordred feltthat he had his death wound he trust himself with the might that he had up tothe burr of King Arthur's spear, and right so he smote his father, King Arthur,with his sword holding in both his hands, upon the side of the head, that thesword pierced the helmet and the tay of the brain. And therewith Mordred dasheddown stark dead to the earth.And noble King Arthur fell in a swough to the earth, and there he swoonedoftentimes, and Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere oftentimes hove him up. And so weaklybetwixt them they led him to a little chapel not far from the sea, and when theking was there, him thought him reasonably eased.Then heard they people cry in the field.\"Now go thou, Sir Lucan,\" said the king, \"and do me to wit what betokens thatnoise in the field.\"So Sir Lucan departed, for he was grievously wounded in many places; and so ashe rode he saw and harkened by the moonlight how that pillers and robbers werecome into the field to pille and to rob many a full noble knight of brooches andbees and of many a good ring and many a rich jewel. And who that were not deadall out, there they slew them for their harness and their riches.When Sir Lucan understood his work he came to the king as soon as he might, andtold him all what he had heard and seen.\"Therefore by my rede,\" said Sir Lucan, \"it is best that we bring you to sometown.\"\"I would it were so,\" said the king, \"but I may not stand, my head works so . .. Ah, Sir Lancelot!\" said King Arthur, \"this day have I sore missed thee! Andalas, that ever I was against thee! For now have I my death, whereof Sir Gawainme warned in my drea n.\"Then Sir Lucan took up the king the tone party and Sir Bedivere the other party,and in the lifting up the king swooned, and in the lifting Sir Lucan fell in aswoon, that part of his guts fell out of his body; and therewith the nobleknight his heart brast. And when the king awoke he behold Sir Lucan, how he layfoaming at the mouth and part of his guts lay at his feet.\"Alas,\" said the king, \"this is to me a full heavy sight, to see this noble dukeso die for my sake, for he would have holpen me that had more need of help thanI! Alas, that he would not complain him, for his heart was so set to help me.Now Jesu have mercy upon his soul!\"Then Sir Bedivere wept for the death of his brother.\"Now leave this mourning and weeping, gentle knight,\" said the king, \"for allthis will not avail me. For wit thou well an I might live myself, the death ofSir Lucan would grieve me evermore. But my time passeth on fast,\" said the king.\"Therefore,\" said King Arthur unto Sir Bedivere, \"take thou here Excalibur, mygood sword, and go with it to yonder water's side; and when thou comest there, Icharge thee throw my sword in that water, and come again and tell me what thouseest there.\"\"My lord,\" said Sir Bedivere, \"your commandment shall be done, and lightly bringyou word again.\"So Sir Bedivere departed. And by the way he beheld that noble sword, and thepomell and the haft was all precious stones. And then he said to himself, \"If Ithrow this rich sword in the water, thereof shall never come good, but harm andloss.\" And then Sir Bedivere hid Excalibur under a tree, and so soon as he mighthe came again unto the king and said he had been at the water and thrown thesword into the water.\"What saw thou there?\" said the king.\"Sir,\" he said, \"I saw nothing but waves and winds.\"\"That is untruly said of thee,\" said the king. \"And therefore go thou lightlyagain, and do my commandment as thou art to me lief and dear: spare not butthrow it in.\"Then Sir Bedivere returned again and took the sword in his hand; and yet himthought sin and shame to throw away that noble sword. And so eft he hid thesword and returned again and told the king that he had been at the water anddone his commandment.\"What sawest thou there?\" said the king.\"Sir,\" he said, \"I saw nothing but waters wap and waves wan.\"\"Ah, traitor unto me and untrue,\" said King Arthur, \"now hast thou betrayed metwice! Who would ween that thou who has been to me so lief and dear, and alsonamed so noble a knight, that thou would betray me for the riches of this sword?But now go again lightly; for thy long tarrying putteth me in great jeopardy ofmy life, for I have taken cold. And but if thou do now as I bid thee, if ever Imay see thee, I shall slay thee mine own hands, for thou wouldest for my richsword see me dead.\"Then Sir Bedivere departed and went to the sword and lightly took it up, and sohe went unto the water's side. And there he bound the girdle about the hilt, andthrew the sword as far into the water as he might. And there came an arm and anhand above the water, and took it and cleight it, and shook it thrice andbrandished, and then vanished with the sword into the water.So Sir Bedivere came again to the king and told him what he saw.\"Alas!\" said the king, \"help me hence, for I dread me I have tarried over long.\"Then Sir Bedivere took the king upon his back and so went with him to thewater's side. And when they were there, even fast by the bank hoved a littlebarge with many fair ladies in it, and among them all was a queen, and all theyhad black hoods. And all they wept and shrieked when they saw King Arthur.\"Now put me into that barge,\" said the king.And so he did softly, and there received him three ladies with great mourning.And so they set him down, and in one of their laps King Arthur laid his head.And then the queen said,\"Ah, my dear brother! Why have you tarried so long from me? Alas, this wound onyour head hath caught overmuch cold!\"And anon they rowed fromward the land, and Sir Bedivere beheld all those ladiesgo fromward him. Then Sir Bedivere cried and said,\"Ah, my lord Arthur, what shall become of me, now ye go from me and leave mehere alone among mine enemies?\"Comfort thyself,\" said the king, \"and do as well as thou mayst, for in me is notrust for to trust in. For I must into the vale of Avalon to heal me of mygrievous wound. And if thou hear nevermore of me, pray for my soul!\"But ever the queen and ladies wept and shrieked, that it was pity to hear. Andas soon as Sir Bedivere had lost sight of the barge he wept and wailed, and sotook the forest and went all that night.And in the morning he was ware, betwixt two holts hoar, of a chapel and anhermitage. Then was Sir Bedivere fain, and thither he went, and when he cameinto the chapel he saw where lay an hermit grovelling on all fours, fast therebya tomb was new graven. When the hermit saw Sir Bedivere he knew him well, for hewas but little tofore Bishop of Canterbury, that Sir Mordred fleamed.\"Sir,\" said Sir Bedivere, \"what man is there here interred that you pray so fastfor?\"\"Fair son,\" said the hermit, \"I wot not verily but by deeming. But this samenight, at midnight, here came a number of ladies and brought here a dead corseand prayed me to inter him. And here they offered an hundred tapers, and gave mea thousand besants.\"\"Alas,\" said Sir Bedivere, \"that was my lord King Arthur, which lieth heregraven in this chapel.\"Then Sir Bedivere swooned, and when he awoke he prayed the hermit that he mightabide with him still, there to live with fasting and prayers:\"For from hence will I never go,\" said Sir Bedivere, \"by my will, but all thedays of my life here to pray for my lord Arthur.\"\"Sir, ye are welcome to me,\" said the hermit, \"for I know you better than yeween that I do: for ye are Sir Bedivere the Bold, and the full noble duke SirLucan de Butler was your brother.\"Then Sir Bedivere told the hermit all as you have heard tofore, and so he beleftwith the hermit that was beforehand Bishop of Canterbury. And there Sir Bedivereput upon him poor clothes, and served the hermit full lowly in fasting and inprayers.Thus of Arthur I find no more written in books that been authorised, neithermore of the very certainty of his death heard I never read, but thus was he ledaway in a ship wherein were three queens; that one was King Arthur's sister,Queen Morgan le Fay, the tother was the Queen of North Galis, and the third wasthe Queen of the Waste Lands.Now more of the death of King Arthur could I never find, but that these ladiesbrought him to his grave, and such one was interred there which the hermit barewitness that sometime Bishop of Canterbury. But yet the hermit knew not incertain that he was verily the body of King Arthur; for this tale Sir Bedivere,a knight of the Table Round, made it to be written.Yet some men say in many parts of England that King Arthur is not dead, but hadby the will of our Lord Jesu into another place; and men say that he shall comeagain, and he shall win the Holy Cross. Yet I will not say that it shall be so,but rather I would say: here in this world he changed his life. And many men saythat there is written upon the tomb this:HIC IACET ARTHURUS REX QUONDAM REXQUE FUTURESAnd thus leave I here Sir Bedivere with the hermit that dwelled that time in achapel beside Glastonbury, and there was his hermitage. And so they lived inprayers and fastings and great abstinence.And when Queen Guinevere understood that King Arthur was dead and all the nobleknights, Sir Mordred and all the remnant, then she stole away with five ladieswith her, and so she went to Amesbury. And there she let make herself a nun, andweared white clothes and black, and great penance she took upon her, as ever didsinful woman in this land. And never creature could make her merry, but ever shelived in fasting, prayers and alms-deeds, that all manner of people marvelledhow virtuously she was changed.The Development of ArthurianRomanceROGER SHERMAN LOOMISRoger Sherman Loomis taught at Columbia University and is a leading Arthurianscholar. In these two essays, he discusses the ways in which early accounts ofArthur and Celtic myths spread to France and became transformed into Arthurianromance. Loomis s concern is with the prototypes for the major characters of theArthurian romances.THE MABINOGIONIn 1849 Lady Charlotte Guest, the literary wife of a steel magnate, completedthe publication of twelve Welsh tales in prose, together with a translationwhich became a minor English classic and inspired two of Tennyson's Idylls ofthe King, as well as Peacock's rollicking burlesque, the Misfortunes of Elphin.The title which Lady Guest gave to the collection, the Mabinogion (pronouncedMabinog-yon), does not mean, as she supposed, \"tales for children,\" but \"talesof a hero's birth, infancy, and youth.\" There is, however, a wide variety in thenature of the narratives, and only three conform to the correct definition. Tocomplicate matters still further, the first four tales are called the FourBranches of the Mabinogi, though only one of these, relating the birth andboyhood of Gwri of the Golden Hair, seems to deserve the title.The Four Branches were probably composed by a single author about 1060, andrepresent a blending of various strands of Celtic myth which had, to begin with,little or no connection with each other. Matthew Arnold recognized in hisLectures on Celtic Literature both the charm and the true nature of thematerial: \"Who is the mystic Arawn, the king of Annwn, who changed semblance fora year with Pwyll, prince of Dyved, and reigned in his place? These are nomedieval personages; they belong to an older mythological world.\" And again:\"The very first thing that strikes one in reading the Mabinogion is howevidently the medieval storyteller is pillaging an antiquity of which he doesnot fully possess the secret; he is like a peasant building his house on thesite of Ilalicarnassus or Ephesus.\" The researches of the last hundred yearshave fully confirmed Arnold's impression and have demonstrated that in the FourBranches, along with myths of British origin, there are similar elementsdirectly borrowed from Ireland.Very few scholars have realized the great importance of the Four Branches of theMabinogi for the study of Arthurian romance. Since Arthur himself is absent andnone of the prominent knights and ladies of his court is easily recognizable,the tales until lately have been generally ignored. But take the very firstepisode—the compact of friendship beween Arawn, the supernatural hunts-man, and Pwyll; Pwyll's lying with Arawn's wife in Arawn's shape; his fidelityand chastity under temptation. While, on the one hand, there is a clear affinityto the Irish story of Manannan and Fiachna's wife, there is an even moreremarkable relationship to the experiences of Gawain at the Green Knight'scastle in the English poetic masterpiece. Not that this Welsh text of theeleventh century was the literary source, even at several removes, of thefourteenth-century English poem; but both were indebted, apparently, to awell-known Welsh tradition of the temptation of a hero by the wife of thehuntsman king, Arawn. In other supernatural figures of the Four Branches, wehave the prototypes of the enchantress Vivien, who beguiled Merlin, and of theMaimed King of the Grail romances, Wagner's Amfortas. Originally, of course,these mythical personages had no relationship to the tales circulating aboutArthur, but by the twelfth century they had been attracted into his orbit.The earliest surviving story in which the heroic Arthur is surrounded by figuresdrawn from this primitive world and by others assembled from folklore andhistory is included in the Mabinogion under the title Kulhwch and Olwen.Probably copied down about 1100, it might be called a mabinogi (though it is notone of the Four Branches), for it recounts the fortunes of a prince from birthto marriage, and frequently refers to him as a mab; that is, a boy or youth. Onthe other hand, it foreshadows distinctly the typical romance of two centurieslater: the hero is a near kinsman of Arthur; love is the impelling force; questsform the staple of his adventures; and his reward is the hand of a beautifulbride. Arthur, at last elevated to the rank of \"sovereign prince of thisisland,\" presides over a host of warriors, and when Kulhwch names them we arenot surprised to meet again our previous acquaintances: Kei, Bedwir, Lluch(spelled Llwch), Mabon son of Modron, and Manawidan son of Llyr.Kulhwch and Olwen differs markedly from the Four Branches in the comparativepaucity of strictly mythological elements. The main plot is known to folkloristsas the \"Giant's Daughter,\" and it is not hard to discern a likeness in outlineto a famous example of the type: the Greek romance of Jason, Medea, and theGolden Fleece. Prince Kulhwch is put under a taboo by his stepmother never tomarry anyone except Olwen, daughter of the Giant Ysbaddaden. Filled withlonging, although he has never seen her, he seeks the help of Arthur and all hishost, naming each one. Never was a more heterogeneous company. Together withthose already mentioned there were Gildas the saint, Taliesin the bard, andseveral \"helpful companions,\" like those who joined the Argonauts. There was Earson of Hearer, who though buried seven fathoms below ground could hear an antrising in the morning fifty miles away. There was the Tracker, who could trackdown the swine which had been carried off seven years before he was born.Accompanied by a troop of Arthur's men, Kulhwch entered Ysbaddaden's hall.\"Where are those rascal servants and those ruffians of mine?\" said the giant.\"Raise up the forks under my eyelids that I may see my future son-in-law.\" Butonly after Kulhwch has flung a poisoned spear through his eyeball willYsbaddaden state the conditions under which he will consent to Kulhwch sbecoming his son-in-law; namely, thirty-nine tasks which must be performed inorder toprovide a suitable wedding feast and to enable Ysbaddaden to appear properlyshaved and groomed for the occasion. With the aid of Arthur and his men,Kulh-wch carries out the tasks, one by one, and obtains scissors, a comb, and arazor from between the ears of the savage boar, Twrch Trwyth. He then presentshimself before the giant; Cadw of Pictland shaves him, cutting off at the sametime the flesh and the ears, and Goreu chops off his head. \"That night Kulhwchslept with Olwen, and she was his only wife.\" Thus ends this curious medley ofthe grotesque, the gruesome, and the romantic.Fitted into the main plot of the \"Giant's Daughter\" are many traditionalstories. We have already met Twrch Trwyth as the boar Troit in Nennius's list ofmirabilia; and Arthur's hunting of the beast from its lair in Ireland, across StGeorge's Channel, over a devious course through South Wales, and down intoCornwall is represented as one of the most perilous of the tasks assigned toKulhwch, and it is treated with extraordinary geographical precision. Similarly,the raid of Arthur on Annwn to procure a magic cauldron, which was the subjectof the cryptic poem treated in the first chapter, is converted into another ofthe tasks imposed by Ysbaddaden. Here the strange glamour has been dispelled,and we have only a prosaic account of an attack on the King of Ireland's stewardto obtain a cauldron to boil meat for Kulhwch s wedding banquet.But the general impression is one of ebullient vigour and wide-ranging fancy.And there are passages of poetic charm such as the description of Olwen, whosehair was yellower than the flower of the broom, whose skin whiter than the foamof the wave, and whose eye was fairer than that of the thrice-mewed falcon. Andlook at Kulhwch as he canters off to Arthur's court. \"A gold-hilted sword was athis thigh, the blade of which was of gold, and he carried a gold-chased bucklerwith the colour of heaven's lightning in it, and the boss was of ivory. Beforehim were two brindled, white-breasted greyhounds, having strong collars ofrubies about their necks, reaching from the shoulder to the ear. The one thatwas on the left side bounded across to the right side, and the one on the rightto the left, and like two sea-swallows sported around him.\"Although the tale of Kulhwch could not have been read outside Wales, Cornwall,and Brittany, and was not the source of any French romance, one should notoverlook the fact that Chretien de Troyes, who wrote the first French Arthurianromances, used two of the situations already employed by his Welsh predecessor.One has only to read the account of Kulhwch's arrival and reception at Arthur'scourt, and then turn to Chretien's story of Perceval's arrival and reception atthe same court, in order to perceive that here is no accidental resemblance,that here we have two versions of the same Welsh tradition. Likewise thedialogue between Kulhwch and a herdsman has its counterpart in Chretien's Ivain.The most sophisticated effort in Lady Guest's collection is the Dram ofRhonabwy. Composed at least a hundred years later than Kulhwch, it was designedto create the phantasmagoric effect of a dream, and also to serve as a memorytest for a reciter, as the last sentence proclaims: \"No one, neither bard norstory-teller, knows the Dream without a book because of the number of coloursthat were on the horses and all the different kinds of rare colours both on thearms and the panoply, and on the precious mantles and the magic stones.\"The opening scene offers a deliberate contrast to this opulence and splendour.One stormy night Rhonabwy, a man of Powys, took refuge in a filthy, smokycow-barn and went to sleep on an ox-hide. He dreamed that he was riding with twocompanions towards a ford of the Severn where it passed from Wales into England,and was pursued and overtaken by a youth clad in green and yellow and mounted ona green-and-yellow horse. Rhonabwy learned that his pursuer had deliberatelyprovoked the battle of Camlann, in which, as we remember, Arthur and Medraut(Modred) fell. But, with a dreamlike indifference to chronology, when Rhonabwyreached the ford, he saw Arthur still alive, apparently of huge size, seated onan island in the river, attended by a bishop and a white-skinned youth costumedin black. Arthur smiled grimly when Rhonabwy and his companions approached,because such \"little fellows\" as these were now the defenders of Britain. Troopafter troop of horsemen, each troop uniformly garbed in a single colour, rodeup, and we learn with astonishment that they were mustering for the battle ofBadon, to take place at midday.The army now set out along the valley of the Severn, and w r as joined by aScandinavian troop led by King Mark and a Danish troop under Edern. Before thewalls of Caer Baddon, here equated with Bath, the host dismounted. Kai camedashing into the midst, he and his horse clad in mail as white as thewater-lily, with rivets as red as blood.There follows a scene of dreamlike irrelevance. Arthur started playing a gamewith Owain (Malory's Uwaine) son of Urien on a board of silver with gold pieces.Messengers, each minutely described, arrived one after another to complain thatArthur's squires were wounding and killing Owain's ravens, and though Owainprotested Arthur refused each time to restrain the squires. At last, in a fury,Owain commanded that his standard be raised, whereupon the ravens recoveredtheir magical powers, swooped on the squires, and tore them to pieces. It wasnow Arthur's turn to beg Owain to intervene, but in vain. Only when Arthurcrushed the golden pieces on the board did Owain cause his standard to belowered and peace returned.The impending battle of Baddon did not take place, for Arthur's prospective foe,Osla, the Octa of Nennius, sent horsemen to ask for a truce. A council was held,the truce was agreed to, Kai rose to urge all who chose to follow Arthur to bewith him that night in Cornwall. With the consequent commotion Rhonabwy awoke.Quite different in character from Kulhwch and the Dream of Rhonabwy is a groupof three Arthurian romances, Geraint, the Lady of the Fountain, and Peredur. Ineach the sequence of incidents corresponds more or less closely to that in oneof three poems by Chretien de Troves, who wrote in the latter half of thetwelfth century; in each, mythological and primitive elements are much lessconspicuous; and the geography of the Lady of the Fountain and Peredur evincesnone of that precise knowledge of Wales and its borders as do the two talespreviously discussed. There has been a long and heated controversy about whethertheir resemblance to Cretien's famous romances is due to rather hazy andinaccurate reminiscences or to the indebtedness of both to a common French orAnglo-Norman source. On grounds of antecedent probability onemight guess that the Welsh tales are re-tellings of Chretien's celebratedstories. But a detailed examination of the resemblances and differences does notsupport this conjecture. Geraint and the Lady of the Fountain seem rather to bebased on the lost work of a single author who wrote in French about the middleof the twelfth century two extraordinarily realistic and cleverly constructednovelettes dealing with love and marriage. Geraint, as readers of Tennyson'sIdylls will remember, won his beautiful bride Enid by his victory over theKnight of the Sparrowhawk, was moved by a false suspicion of her fidelity to puther through a series of severe tests, and at the same time demonstrated hisprowess anew; and so, his faith in her and her pride in him restored, they livedhappily thereafter. The Lady of the Fountain is cast in a similar mould. Owainson of Urien won his beautiful bride by his victory over the Knight of theFountain, but, after a brief honeymoon, lost her love by his absorption inknightly sports. Only after a period of estrangement did he win his lady'sforgiveness by his prowess, and live with her thereafter at Arthur's court tillthe end of her days. Though in each of these romances there are stillsupernatural features—the dwarf king in one, the storm-making spring in theother—the natural motivation and the concern with practical problems of conductshow that the unknown author lived in a very different world from that inhabitedby the author of Kulhwch. It should not be forgotten that Geraint and the Ladyof the Fountain are not translations from a written text but rather re-tellingsbased on memory, and the conclusions especially have suffered as a result.The Mabinogion, then, consists of four different strata in the development ofArthurian fiction: 1) the Four Branches, made up largely of mythical material,Welsh and Irish, as yet unattached to Arthur; 2) Kulhwch, in which we find aslight amount of this same material, together with a preponderance of widespreadfolktale motifs, the whole being attracted into the orbit of Arthur; 3) theDream ofRhonabwy, a highly successful experiment in combining very archaictraditions about Arthur and Owain with recent pseudo-historical additions, togive the vivid impression of a dream; 4) three romances which, thoughincorporating much material of ultimate Welsh and Irish origin, have theirimmediate sources in French or Anglo-Norman compositions of the twelfth century.Still the continuity of the tradition may be discerned sometimes dimly,sometimes clearly, in its variegated manifestations. And Arthur, who hadvanished from this earthly scene in the early sixth century, an obscure figure,remembered only by his fellow Britons, has become for their descendants, sevencenturies later, not merely a glorious king, jut an emperor, and for the Frenchand Ango-Normans the centre of the most adventurous circle of knights that theworld had ever seen.THE INTERMEDIARIESA perusal of the previous chapter leads inevitably to the conclusion that somepowerful forces had been at work between the eleventh and the thirteenthcenturies to transform Arthur from an insular into an international figure, fromthe subject of a purely Welsh and Cornish legend into a king whose literary famerivalled that of Charlemagne, even in France itself. It is the function of thischapter to determine what these forces were.Though the problem has been confused by plausible guesses and unwarrantedclaims, the evidence points clearly to two main agents in the establishment ofArthur's prestige and the popularization outside Celtic lands of what is calledthe Matter of Britain. The first was the wide-ranging activity of professionalBreton story-tellers, conteurs, who, speaking French, were welcomed asentertainers wherever that language was understood. The second was the sensationproduced by the History of the Kings of Britain of Geoffrey of Monmouth, first,in its Latin form, among the learned, and then, in French translation, among thecourtly classes.It will be remembered that in the course of the Anglo-Saxon occupation of whatwas to be England, thousands of Britons fled from their island home southwardsacross the sea, and there in what is now called Brittany their descendantsmultiplied and flourished. Through contact with their French-speaking neighboursmany of them became bilingual. They still kept in touch, though, with theircousins, the Welsh and Cornish, across the Channel, and as the Arthurian legenddeveloped and expanded in Wales into a multitude of such prose tales as Kulhwch,so the Bretons took them up. A class of wandering minstrels, with histrionictalents, found that this novel material captivated barons and their ladies, notonly in Brittany but wherever French was understood. More and more they adaptedthe fantastic tales to French tastes, manners, and standards of rationality,costumed their characters according to the latest mode, and introduced all thepageantry of chivalry. Their audiences, somewhat bored by a monotonous diet ofepics dealing with the quarrels and wars of Charlemagne and his paladins, werefascinated by the new and various tales of love and marvel and adventure, andwere easily persuaded to accept the Breton image of Arthur as the nonpareil ofkings.The Norman Conquest opened up new territory. After 1066 William awarded manyfiefs all over England to Breton knights who had helped him on the field ofSenlac; and, of course, in these transplanted Breton households, as well as inAnglo-Norman halls, the Breton entertainers were welcome. It was thus by way ofBrittany that Arthur returned, as it were, to reconquer the land of his historicexploits and become a hero for the Anglo-Normans. And it was as a result of theenormous popularity enjoyed by the Breton tales told in French that we findFrench romances of Arthur and his knights rendered into Welsh, as we saw in thelast chapter; namely, Geraint, the Lady of the Fountain, and Peredur.There is a rival theory which at first glance seems very plausible. After 1066there were many direct contacts between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh,especially in South Wales, and relations were sometimes friendly. What morenatural and even inevitable than that tales resembling Kulhwch should betransmitted directly across the border to England, without any Bretonintermediaries? But so far no one has produced contemporary testimony to directtransmission of Arthurian stories from the Welsh to the Anglo-Normans; there isno close affinity between Kulhwch and the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, on theone hand, and Anglo-Normans and Middle English romances, on the other; andthese last, most of them derived from French sources, betray in theirnomenclature traces of Breton transmission.To be sure, a certain story-teller named Bleheris or Breri (Welsh Bleddri)enjoyed a prodigious reputation, both in Britain and in France, for his tales ofGawain, the Round Table, and the Grail, and it seems that, having become expertin French, he excelled the Bretons at their own game. But it is unlikely that heever committed his tales to parchment, and it is impossible to find, even in theFrench poems which cite his authority, any strain of pure Welsh tradition. Thesolitary instance of Bleheris does not disprove the preponderant share of theBreton minstrels in the dissemination of Arthurian matter both on the Continentand in England. This oral tradition continued well into the thirteenth century,long after French writers had been busy drawing on this reservoir of story fortheir own experiments in prose and verse. In brief, the Breton conteurs were thedirect inspirers, the immediate progenitors, of French Arthurian romance. Oncegrasp this fact, and you have the answer to many puzzles.Geoffrey of Monmouth, was the second great intermediary between the Celticpeoples and the non-Celts in spreading the renown of Arthur. The latestauthorities believe that he was born of Breton parents who had settled atMonmouth, and that he obtained an excellent education, probably at Oxford,which, though not yet the seat of a university, was already attracting scholars.He was certainly living there between 1129 and 1151, and, as the title magistersuggests, may have been himself a sort of classics don. Ordained a priest in1152, he was promptly elevated to the bishopric of St Asaph in North Wales. In1153 he witnessed at Westminster a charter assuring to Henry of Anjou thesuccession to the English throne, and in 1155 he died. His literary patrons andpresumably his friends were two successive bishops of Lincoln and the powerfulillegitimate son of Henry I, Robert Earl of Gloucester. Evidently Geoffrey wason familiar terms with some of the highest ecclesiastical and political figuresof his day.Though Geoffrey was destined to wear the mitre, he never displayed any religiousfeeling nor any deep concern about the Church. He was ambitious, as hisflattering dedications prove; and he was quite unscrupulous, for the History ofthe Kings of Britain, which he claimed to have translated from an ancient bookimported from Brittany, was one of the world's most brazen and successfulfrauds.Shortly before completing it, he indulged in another piece of mystification, alittle book in Latin containing alleged prophecies of Merlin. For centuriesprevious a poet named Myrddin had been famous in Wales as a soothsayer, and hisreputation had spread to Anglo-Norman circles. About 1134 Geoffrey set out tosatisfy curiosity about the mage, and boldly composed a set of predictions, notonly covering in cryptic style the period up to his own time but also extendinginto a future filled with lurid catastrophes. Merlin's prediction about Arthurshows that Geoffrey had at least sketched in his mind a glorious career ofconquest for the British hero. \"The Boar of Cornwall shall bring succour [to theBritons] and shall trample the necks [of the Saxons] under his feet. The islandsofthe ocean shall be subdued to his power, and he shall possess the forests ofGaul. The house of Romulus shall dread his fierceness, and his end shall bedoubtful. In the mouths of peoples he shall be celebrated, and his deeds shallbe food to the tellers of tales.\" Highly significant are the cautious remarkabout the possibility of Arthur's survival and the reference to story-tellerswho found in him a subject which provided them with their daily bread.When, about 1136, Geoffrey completed and published the History he included theProphecies of Merlin as the seventh book. In the preface to the larger work heagain alluded to the deeds of Arthur and other kings of Britain as proclaimed bymany peoples from memory. He then cites as his source an old book in the Britishlanguage, dealing with these kings, from Brutus, the first, to Cad-walader, thelast. If there was any such ancient tome Geoffrey could not have taken much fromit—at most, the names of apocryphal early British rulers, such as Leir; but thestory of King Leir and his daughters is Geoffrey's own clever remodelling of theBuddhist parable of a man and his three friends which reached the West in theeleventh century as part of Barlaam and Josaphat. Needless to say, the Historycontains a considerable amount of veracious chronicling when the material isdrawn from Julius Caesar, Bede, Henry of Huntingdon, etc. But even when Geoffreyhad reliable material he used it with cynical ingenuity to create fiction. Whenhe composed his elaborate description of Arthur's second coronation atCaerleon-on-Usk, and found that Welsh Arthurian tradition, as known to him, didnot supply enough names of guests for so august an occasion, he picked at randomnames from ancient Welsh genealogies. And when he could find no record of thekings who succeeded Arthur he arbitrarily took the names from Gildas's invectiveagainst several kings reigning simultaneously in Britain, and strung them alongseriatim.It is interesting to observe what the wily \"historian\" did with Nennius. Fromthat source Geoffrey lifted the meagre notion that the first conqueror andcolonizer of Albion was a Trojan named Brutus, and he then proceeded to stretchit out into a prose Aeneid, with Brutus as the hero. The story of Vortigern'stower and the clairvoyant boy also came from Nennius. Geoffrey arbitrarilyidentified the boy with the youthful Merlin. The name of Uther Pendragon isknown to genuine Welsh tradition, but it was probably the misinterpretation of apassage in Nennius which led Geoffrey to make him the father of Arthur. Thebattles with the Saxons derive from the same source, but their number has beenreduced from twelve to three, and these have been treated with much imaginarydetail and with much attention to the geography of the campaign. For the supremevictory of Badon, arbitrarily equated with Bath, Arthur armed himself with hisshield Pridwen, the sword Caliburn, and the spear Ron—names derived more or lessdirectly from Wales. Apparently to avoid monotony, Geoffrey inserted in themidst of this campaigning an account from Nennius of the marvels of Loch Lomondand of a Welsh whirlpool.Three of the most important elements in Arthur's career Geoffrey derived fromthe oral tradition of the conteurs, though he may well have met them in writtenform. For the begetting of the future conqueror by Uther on Gorlois'swife in Tintagel castle he found ready to his hand a local Cornish legend. Asfor the great climax, Arthurs victory over the Emperor Lucius Hiberus and thelegions of Rome, and as for Gawain's (Walwanus's) part in it, there is evidencethat an old Welsh tradition of a war between Arthur and his vassal Lluch, ofwhich there are other traces, came to Geoffrey in a Breton-French form. Quitearbitrarily he exalted Lluch to the imperial throne in order to make Arthur'striumph the more splendid. The ironic reversal of fortune, the treachery ofMod-red, Arthurs nephew, the forced marriage of Guenevere, the pursuit of Modredinto Cornwall, and the fatal battle on the River Camel—all this, we may safelybelieve, represents the tradition which had grown up about the battle ofCam-lann, first recorded, as we know, in the Annals of Wales. To the statementthat even the renowned King Arthur was mortally wounded, Geoffrey added thecontradictory belief of the Bretons that he was borne away to the isle of Avalonfor the healing of his wounds. Evidently on the burning issue of Arthur'ssurvival the Oxford scholar could be quoted on either side. However ardently hisBreton friends desired Arthur's messianic return, his Anglo-Norman patrons wouldfind it embarrassing.Literary and traditional sources provided the great bulk of Geoffrey's matter,but he drew some scenes from life. There can be little doubt that hisdescription of the coronation ceremony at Caerleon and the sports which followedwas a clever adaptation of the festivities at the crowning of King Stephen. Andmost striking is this additon: \"The women . . . esteemed no one worthy of theirlove but such as had given proof of their valour in three several battles. . . .Thus the ladies were made chaste and the knights more noble because of theirlove. . . . The knights engaged in a game on horseback in imitation of a battle;the ladies, looking on from the top of the walls, excited in them wild flames oflove as is customary in such sports.\" Here, then, is the first reference inEngland to a tournament, the first reference to ladies \"whose bright eyes raininfluence and judge the prize,\" and, even more momentous, the earliest assertionin medieval literature that love between the sexes was an ennobling and refiningforce. Not that this faker of history was the inventor of what we may callromantic love, any more than he invented the tournament, but evidently hebelieved in making Arthur's court a mirror of the latest fashions in sport andsentiment.The more one studies the History of the Kings of Britain and the methods of itscomposition, the more one is astonished at the author's impudence, and the moreone is impressed with his cleverness, his art. Written in a polished but notornate style, displaying sufficient harmony with learned authorities andaccepted traditions, free from the wilder extravagances of the conteurs, foundedostensibly on a very ancient manuscript, no wonder Geoffrey's magnum opusdisarmed scepticism and was welcomed by the learned world. To be sure, at theend of the twelfth century William of Newburgh, with extraordinary perspicacity,accused Geoffrey of disguising under the honourable name* of history the fablesabout Arthur which he took from the ancient fictions of the Britons andaugmented out of his own head, and of writing to please the Bretons, of whom themajority are said to be brutishly stupid that they look still for Arthur as ifhe would return, and will not listen to anyone who says that he is dead. But fewreaders of Geoffrey's History had such acumen. The kings of England could begrateful to a historian who provided them with a predecessor who had conqueredall of western Europe except Spain, and whose ancestors, Belinus, Con-stantine,and Maximian, had seized even Rome itself. For three and a half centuries theHistory of the Kings of Britain was accepted as authoritative, not only inEngland but on the Continent as well. Manuscripts multiplied; translations weremade into Welsh, French, and Norwegian. Contrary to the claims of some scholars,it had very little influence on the French romances of the twelfth century;indeed, the gap in matter and manner between the History and the poems couldhardly be wider. Only in the French prose romances of the thirteenth century didGeoffrey's version of Arthur's birth, the war with Rome, and the final strugglewith Modred exert a strong influence on fiction.Unit XIIA Noble Heart: The Courtly Love of Tristan and IsoldeTristanGOTTFRIED VON STRASSBURGGottfried Von Strassburg, a German clerk, wrote the Tristan story in about theyear 1210. It is said to be the most perfect form of the romance. Thetranslation here is that of A. T Hatto and includes the ending (missing fromGottfried's version) by Thomas of Britain. Selections include the love scene ofTristans parents, his falling in love with Isolde, the love potion, the cave oflovers, the final battle, and the death of the two lovers. You will note thatthe spelling of the names changes in the last selections. Isolde becomes Ysolt.This is because Gottfried's poem is incomplete and the ending comes from Thomasof Britain who wrote in Norman-French rather than Gottfried's German.PROLOGUEIf I spend my time in vain, ripe for living as I am, my part in society willcontinue to fall short of what my experience requires of me. Thus I haveundertaken a labour to please the polite world and solace noble hearts—thosehearts which I hold in affection, that world which lies open to my heart. I donot mean the world of the many who (as I hear) are unable to endure sorrow andwish only to revel in bliss. (Please God to let them live in their bliss!) WhatI have to say does not concern that world and such a way of life; their way andmine diverge sharply. I have another world in mind which together in one heartbears its bitter-sweet, its dear sorrow, its heart's joy, its love's pain, itsdear life, its sorrowful death, its dear death, its sorrowful life. To this lifelet my life be given, of this world let me be part, to be damned or saved withit. I have kept with it so far and with it have spent the days that were tobring me counsel and guidance through a life which has moved me profoundly. Ihave offered the fruits of my labour to this world as a pastime, so that with mystory its denizens can bring their keen sorrow half-way to alleviation and thusabate their anguish. For if we have something before us to occupy our thoughtsit frees our unquiet soul and eases our heart of its cares. All are agreed thatwhen a man of leisure is overwhelmed by love's torment, leisure redoubles thattorment and if leisure be added to languor, languor will mount and mount. And soit is a good thing that one who harbours love s pain and sorrow in his heartshould seek distraction with all his mind—then his spirit will find solace andrelease. Yet I would never advise a man in search of pleasure to follow anypursuit that would ill become pure love. Let a lover ply a love-tale with hisheart and lips and so while away the hour.Therefore, whoever wants a story need go no further than here.—I will story himwell with noble lovers who gave proof of perfect love:'A man, a woman; a woman, a man: Tristan, Isolde; Isolde, Tristan.416RIVALIN AND BLANCHEFLORThere was a lord in Parmenie of tender years, as I read. In birth (so his storytruly tells us) he was the peer of kings, in lands the equal of princes, inperson fair and charming, loyal, brave, generous, noble: and to those whom itwas his duty to make happy this lord all his days was a joy-giving sun. He was adelight to all, a paragon of chivalry, the glory of his kinsmen, the firm hopeof his land. Of all the qualities which a lord should have he lacked not one,except that he overindulged himself in pleasures dear to his heart and didentirely as he pleased. For this he had to suffer in the end, since, alas, it isthe way of the world, and ever was, that oncoming youth and ample fortune bearfruit in arrogance. It never occurred to him to overlook a wrong, as many do whowield great power; but returning evil for evil, matching force with force: tothis he gave much thought.Now when Mark's festival was over and the nobles had dispersed, news came to himthat a king, an enemy of his, had invaded Cornwall in such force that unless hewere soon repelled he would destroy all he overran. There and then Mark summoneda mighty army and met him in great strength. He fought with him and defeatedhim, killing and taking so many of his men that those who got away or survivedon the field did so by great good fortune. There noble Rivalin was run throughthe side with a spear and so severely wounded that his friends bore him home toTintagel in great grief as one half dead. They set him down, a dying man. Atonce it was rumoured that Rivalin of Canoel had been struck in battle andmortally wounded. This gave rise to doleful laments, at court and in thecountry. Those who knew of his good qualities deeply mourned his undoing. Theyregretted that his prowess, his handsome person, his tender youth, his admiredhigh temper and breeding, should pass away so soon with him and have so untimelyan end. His dear friend Mark lamented him with a heart-rending vehemence he hadnever felt before for any man. Many a noblewoman wept for Rivalin, many a ladylamented him; and all who had ever seen hini were moved to pity by his plight.But whatever the sorrow they all felt for his disaster, it was his Blanchefloralone, that faultless, noble lady, who in utter steadfastness, with eyes andheart, bewept and bewailed her dear love's pain. And indeed, when she was aloneand able to vent her sorrow, she laid violent hands on herself. A thousand timesshe beat with them there and only there, there where she was troubled, above herheart— there the lovely girl struck many a blow. Thus did this charming ladytorment her sweet young lovely body in such an access of grief that she wouldhave bartered away her life for any death that did not come of love. In anyevent, she would have perished and died of her sorrow, had not hope refreshedher and expectancy buoyed her up, set as she was on seeing him, however, thatmight be: and once having seen him she would gladly suffer whatever might be instore for her. With such thoughts she held on to life, till she regained hercomposure and considered means of seeing him, as her sufferings required. Inthis way her thoughts turned to a certain nurse of hers who had sole charge ofher upbringing and never let her out of her keeping. She drew this woman asideand went to aprivate place and there made her sad complaint to her, as those in her positionhave always done and still do today. Her eyes brimmed over, the hot tears fellthick and fast down her gleaming cheeks.\"Ah, woe is me,\" she said, clasping her hands and holding them out imploringly.\"Ah,\" she said, \"woe, woe is me! Oh dearest nurse, prove your devotion now, ofwhich you have such a fund. And since you are so good that my whole happinessand deliverance rest on your aid alone, relying on your goodness I will tell youwhat troubles my heart. I shall die if you do not help me!\"\"Tell me, my lady, what distresses you so and makes you complain so bitterly?\"\"Darling, dare I tell you?\"\"Yes, dear mistress, come tell it now.\"\"This dead man Rivalin of Parmenie is killing me. I would very much like to seehim, if that were possible and if I knew how to go about it before he is quitedead—for alas! he is past recovery. If you can help me to this I will deny younothing as long as I live.\"\"If I allow this thing,\" her nurse reflected, \"what harm can come of it? Halfdead already, this man will die tomorrow or even today, and I shall have savedmy lady's life and honour and she will always love me more than other women.Sweet mistress,\" she said, \"my pet, your misery saddens my heart, and if I canavert your sufferings by any act of mine, never doubt that I shall do so. I willgo down myself and see him, and then return at once. I will spy out the wholesituation, how and where he is bedded, and also take stock of his suite.\"And so, pretending to go and mourn his sufferings, Blancheflor's nurse gainedadmittance and secretly informed him that her mistress would much like to seehim, if he would allow it in accordance with honour and decorum. This done, shereturned with the news. She took the girl and dressed her as a beggar-woman.Masking her lovely face in the folds of heavy veils, she took her mistress bythe hand and went to Rivalin. He, for his part, had packed his people off oneafter another and was alone, after impressing it on them all that solitudebrought him relief. For her part Blancheflor's nurse declared that she hadbrought a physician-woman, and she succeeded in getting her admitted to him. Shethen thrust the bolt across the door.\"Now, madam,\" she said, \"go and see him!\" And Blancheflor, lovely girl, went upto him, and when she looked into his eyes, \"Alas,\" she said, \"alas for this dayand evermore! Oh that I was ever born! How all my hopes are dashed!\"Rivalin with great difficulty inclined his head in thanks as much as a dying manmight. But Blancheflor scarcely noticed it and paid no attention, but merely satthere unseeing, and laid her cheek on Rivalin's, till for joy but also forsorrow her strength deserted her body. Her rosy lips grew wan, the hue of herflesh quite lost the glow that dwelt in it before. In her clear eyes the dayturned dark and sombre as night. Thus she lay senseless in a swoon for a longtime, her cheek on his cheek, as though she were dead. And when she had rallieda little from this extremity she took her darling in her arms and laying hermouth to his kissed him a hundred thousand times in a short space till her lipshad fired his sense androused his mettle for love, since love resided in them. Her kisses made him gay,they brought him such vigour that he strained the splendid woman to hishalf-dead body, very tenderly and close. Nor was it long before they had theirway and the sweet woman received a child from him. As to Rivalin he was all butdead, both of the woman and love. But for God's helping him from this dire passhe could never have lived; yet live he did, for so it was to be.Thus it came about that Rivalin recovered, and Blancheflor's heart was burdenedand unburdened of two different kinds of pain. She left great sorrow alongsidethe man and bore greater sorrow away. She left the anguish of a lovelorn heart,but what she bore away was death. She left her anguish when love came; death shereceived with the child. Yet, however it was she recovered, in whichever way shehad been burdened and unburdened by him (on the one hand to her loss, on theother to her gain), she regarded nothing else but dear love and the man who wasdear to her. Of the child or tragic death within her she knew nothing: but loveand the man she did know, and behaved as a living person should and as a loverdoes. Her heart, her mind, her desire, were centred entirely on Rivalin, and hisin return on her and on the passion she inspired in him. Between them they hadin their minds but one delight and one desire. Thus he was she, and she was he.He was hers and she was his. There Blancheflor, there Rivalin! There Rivalin,there Blancheflor! There both, and there true love!Their life was now intimately shared. They were happy with each other andheartened one another with much kindness shared in common. And when they coulddecently arrange a rendezvous, their worldly joy was so entire, they felt soappeased and contented, that they would not have give this life of theirs forany heavenly kingdom.MOROLDWhat fresh matters shall I now set in train? When landless Tristan arrived inCornwall he heard a rumour which greatly displeased him; that mighty Morold hadcome from Ireland and was demanding tribute from both Cornwall and England underthreat of armed combat. In the matter of the tribute things stood thus. As Iread the history and as the authentic story says, the man who was king ofIreland was called Gurmun the Gay and he was a scion of the house of Africa,where his father was king. When the latter died, his country passed into thepossession of Gurman and Gurmun's brother, who was co-heir with him. But Gurmunwas so ambitious and high-tempered that he disdained to share anything withanybody—his heart insisted that he should rule as monarch. And so he began tochoose strong and steadfast men, the best that were known for desperateencounters, both knights and sergeants, whom he was able to attach to himself byhis wealth or his charm; and he left all his land to his brother there and then.Quickly forsaking those parts, Gurmun obtained leave and authority in writing ofthe mighty, illustrious Romans that he should have possession of all hecould subdue, yet concede them some right and title to it. Nor did he delay anylonger, but ranged over land and sea till he came to Ireland and conquered thatcountry and compelled its people, despite themselves, to take him as lord andking; after which they came round to helping him to harry their neighbours atall times with battles and assaults. In the course of these events he subduedCornwall and England, too. But Mark was a boy at the time and irresolute in war,as children are, and so lost his power and became tributary to Gurmun. Itfurther helped Gurmun greatly and added to his power and prestige that hemarried Morold's sister. This led to his being much feared. Morold was a dukeand would have liked to rule a country of his own, for he was very bold andpossessed lands, much wealth, a good person, and resolute spirit. He wasGurmun's champion.Now I will tell you truly and precisely what tribute it was that was sent fromCornwall and England to Ireland. In the first year they sent them three hundredmarks of bronze and no more; in the second silver; in the third gold. In thefourth year Morold the Strong arrived from Ireland armed both for battle andsingle combat. Barons and their peers were summoned before him from all overCornwall and England, and in his presence they drew lots as to which shouldsurrender to him such of their children as were capable of service and ashandsome and acceptable in their appearance as courtly usage required. Therewere no girls, only boys. Of the latter there were to be thirty from eitherland, and there would be no way of opposing such degradation other than bysingle combat or by a battle between peoples. Now the Cornish and English wereunable to obtain justice by means of open warfare since their lands had declinedin strength. On the other hand Morold was so strong, pitiless, and harsh thatscarcely anyone he looked in the face dared risk his life against him more thanwould a woman. And when the tribute had been sent back to Ireland and the fifthyear had come round again, at the solstice they had always to send to Rome suchenvoys as were acceptable to her to learn what instructions her mighty Senatewould dispatch to each subject land. For each year there was proclaimed to themhow they were to dispense the laws and statutes of the land in the manner of theRomans, and how conduct their courts of justice. And indeed, they had to live instrict accordance with the directions they received in Rome. Thus every fifthyear these two lands submitted their Presentation and statutory tribute to Rome,their noble mistress. Yet they did her this honour less as a due, either in lawor religion, than by command of Gurmun.Let us now return to the story. Tristan had heard all about this infamy inCornwall; and the pact t>y which this tribute was levied was well known to himbefore. Yet, from the talk of the people, he heard every day of the country'sshame and suffering wherever he rode past castles or towns. And when he returnedonce more to court at Tintagel, I tell you he witnessed such woeful scenes onthe roads and in the streets that he was deeply angered. The news of Tristan'sarrival quickly reached Mark and his court, and they were all glad of it—I meanas glad as their sorrowful state would allow; for the greatest lords of allCornwall were, as you have heard, now assembled at court for their dishonour.The noble peers of the realm were resorting to drawing lots for the ruin oftheir sons! And itwas thus that Tristan found them all, kneeling and at prayer, each man on hisown. but openly and without shame, with streaming eyes, and in an agony of bodyand soul, as he begged the good God to shield his race and offspring.Tristan went up to them while they were all at their prayers. How was hereceived? You are easily answered. To tell the truth, Tristan was not welcomedby a single soul of all the household, not even by Mark, as affectionately as hewould have been had this annoyance left them free. But Tristan overlooked it andboldly went to where the lots were being apportioned and where Mark and Moroldwere seated. \"You lords, one and all,\" he said, \"to name you all by one name,who hasten to draw lots and sell your noble blood, are you not ashamed of thedisgrace you are bringing on this land? Brave as you always are in all things,every one of you, you ought by rights to make yourselves and your countryhonoured and respected, and advance its glory! But you have laid your freedom atthe hands and feet of your enemy by means of this shameful tribute, and, as inthe past, you give your noble sons into serfdom and bondage, who ought to beyour joy, your delight, your very life! And yet you cannot show who is forcingyou to do so, or what necessity compels it, but for a duel and one man! No othernecessity is involved. Nevertheless, you cannot hit on one among you all who iswilling to put his life against a single man to try whether he shall fall orprevail. Now assuming that he falls, well then, a quick death and thislong-lived tribulation are valued differently in Heaven and on earth. But if hewins and the unjust cause is overthrown, he will have honour in this world andGod's regard in the next for ever. .After all, fathers should give their livesfor their children, since their lives are one and indivisible: this is to gowith God. But it is utterly against God's commandments when a man yields theliberty of his sons up to serfdom, when he hands them over as bondsmen andhimself lives on in freedom! If I may advise you on a course that would befitting both in piety and in honour, my counsel is that you choose a man,wherever you can find him among the people of this country, who is fit forsingle combat and willing to leave it to fortune whether he survives or no. Andall of you pray for him in God's name, above all, that the Holy Ghost grant himhonour and a happy outcome, and that he fear not Mo-rold's strength and statureovermuch. Let him place his trust in God, who has never yet deserted any manthat had right on his side. Take counsel quickly, deliberate with speed how toavert this disgrace and save yourselves from but a single man! Dishonour yourbirth and good names no more!\"\"Oh, sir!\" they all replied, \"it is not like that with Morold—none can face himand live!\"\"Enough of that!\" said Tristan. \"For God's sake, consider who you are! By birthyou are peers of all kings, and equals of all emperors, and you mean to barteraway and disown your noble sons, who are just as noble as you, and turn theminto bondsmen? If it is a fact that you cannot inspirit anyone so far that hedares to fight in God's name and in a just cause against that one man for thewrong suffered by you all and the plight of this land, and if you would be goodenough to leave it to God and to me, then indeed, my lords, in God's name I willgive my young life as a hostage to fortune and undertake the combat for you! Godgrant it turn out well for you and restore you to your rights. Moreover, ifsomehow I should fare otherwise than well in this battle, your case will not beharmed. If I fall in this duel it will neither avert nor bring on, reduce orincrease the distress of a single one of you. Matters will stand as before. Butif it turns out happily, then indeed God willed it so and God alone will bethanked for it. For the man I shall face single-handed (as I am well aware) isone whose strength and spirit have long stood the test of warfare, whereas mypowers are just developing and I am not so eligible for deeds of arms as ourpresent need requires, except that I have two victory-bringing aids inbattle—God and our just cause! They shall go into battle with me. I have awilling heart, too, and that is also good for duelling. So that, if these threehelp me, I feel sure that I shall not succumb to one man, however untried I maybe in other respects.\"Meanwhile a battle-ground had been appointed for the champions, an islet in thesea, yet near enough to the shore for the crowd to see with ease what happenedthere. It was further agreed that apart from these two men none should set footon it till the battle was over. And indeed this was well honoured. Accordingly,two pontoons were sculled along for them, of which each could ship a man and ahorse in armour. The boats were waiting. Morold boarded one and, taking thesweep, ferried himself across. Arriving at the island he quickly beached theboat and made it fast. He mounted at once, took hold of his spear, and wheeledand galloped his horse at full tilt in grand style over the length and breadthof the island. The charges he delivered with lowered lance within thatbattle-ground were as light and sportive as if it were a game.When Tristan had embarked in his craft and taken his gear—that is, his horse andhis lance—on board with him, he stationed himself in the bows. \"Your Majesty,\"he said, \"my lord Mark, do not be over-anxious for me or for my safety. Let usleave it in God's hands. Our fears are of no avail. What if we fared better thanwe are led to believe? Our victory and good fortune would be due not to skill inarms but to the power of God alone. Leave all your dreads and fears, for I mayyet emerge unscathed. As to me, this affair weighs lightly on me. So let it bewith you. Take heart! It will fall out only as it must. But whatever turn myaffairs should take, whatever the end in store for me, commend your land thisday to Him on whom I rely. May God himself go with me to the duelling-ground andrestore justice to its own. God must either win or suffer defeat with me! May Hewatch over the issue!\"With these words he gave them the sign of the cross and, pushing off in hispontoon, left in God's name. Many lips now commended his life to God, many handssent tender farewells after him.When he had landed on the farther shore he set his craft adrift and quicklymounted his charger. Morold was there in an instant.\"Tell me,\" asked Morold, \"what does this mean, what had you in mind when you setyour boat adrift?\"\"I did it for this reason. Here are two men and a boat. It is certain thatunless both fall one of them will be killed, so that the victor's needs will bemet by this one boat which brought you to the island.\"\"Clearly there can be no turning back from this duel,\" answered Morold. \"If youwere to stop it even at this late hour and we parted company amicably on theunderstanding that my dues from these lands were confirmed to me, I would thinkyou fortunate, for indeed I should be very sorry if it fell to me to kill you.No knight that I ever set eyes on has pleased me as much as you.\"\"If peace is to be made between us the tribute must be abolished,\" was Tristan'sspirited answer.\"Take my word for it,\" said the other, \"peace will not be made on those terms!We shall not make friends that way. The tribute must go with me!\"\"Then we are wasting our time parleying. Since you say you are so sure to killme, Morold, defend yourself, if you wish to live—there is no other way aboutit!\"Tristan threw his horse round, flattened the curve into a dead straight line,and galloped right ahead with lowered spear with all the zest of which his heartwas capable. With thighs that beat like wings, with spurs and ankles, he tookhis horse by the flanks. Why should the other man dally, whose life was now atstake? He did as all men do whose minds are resolved on prowess. At his heart'sbidding he, too, wheeled rapidly away and more rapidly back again, raising andlowering his lance. And now he came spurring along like one drawn by the Devil.Horse and rider, they came flying at Tristan swifter than a merlin, and Tristanwas as eager for Morold. They flew along with equal dash and keenness so thatthey broke their spears, which shivered in their shields into a thousand pieces.Then swords were snatched from sides and they went at it hand to hand from thesaddle. God himself would have joyed to see it!Morold gave him no chance to look up, such a rain of blows did he deal him. Andso Morold went on hacking at him till he mastered him with blows, and Tristan,hard put to it to meet them, thrust out his shield too far and held his guardtoo high, so that finally Morold struck him such an ugly blow through the thigh,plunging almost to the very life of him, that his flesh and bone were laid barethrough hauberk and jambs, and the blood spurted out and fell in a cloud on thatisland.\"What now?\" asked Morold. \"Will you own yourself beaten? You can see foryourself by this that you should never plead an unjust cause. The wrongness ofyour case is now clearly revealed. If you wish to live, think how it can bedone, while you still have the time. For believe me, Tristan, your plight mustirrevocably end in your death! Unless I alone avert it you will never be curedby man or woman—the sword that has wounded you is bated with deadly poison! Nophysician or medical skill can save you from this pass, save only my sisterIsolde, Queen of Ireland. She is versed in herbs of many kinds, in the virtuesof all plants, and in the art of medicine. She alone knows the secret, and noother in the world. If she does not heal you, you will be past all healing. Ifyou will listen to me and admit your liability for tribute, I will get my sisterthe Queen herself to cure you. I will share all I have with you in friendshipand deny you nothing you fancy.\"\"I shall not abandon my oath and my honour either for you or your sister. I havebrought here in my free hand the freedom of two countries, and back itshall go with me, else I must suffer greater harm for them, even death itself]Know that I am not driven to such straits by a single wound, so that all muststand or fall by it. We are still very far from having decided this duel. Thetribute will end in your death or mine, there is no help for it!\" With this,Tristan attacked him again.And when Morold had collected himself somewhat from his fall and was making forhis horse, Tristan was already upon him and in a flash had struck his helmet ablow that sent it flying. At this, Morold took a run at him and struck off aforeleg of his horse above the knee clean through the barding, so that the beastsank on its haunches beneath him, while Morold was content to leap aside. Then,moving his shield onto his back as his seasoned instincts prompted him, the wilyman groped down and retrieved his helmet. In the light of his experience hecalculated that when he was back in the saddle he would don his helmet andattack Tristan again. And now that he had collected it, had run to his mount andcome near enough to seize the bridle, thrust his left foot home into the stirrupand grasp the saddle with his hand—Tristan had overtaken him. He struck Moroldacross the pommel so that his sword and his right hand, mail and all, fell uponthe sand. And as it fell, Tristan struck him another blow, high upon the coif,and the blow went home so deeply that, when Tristan jerked back his sword, thewrench left a fragment embedded in Morold's skull. (This, as it turned outlater, drove Tristan to fear and desperation. It all but proved the death ofhim.)THE LOVE-POTIONWhen this affair had been concluded the King announced to the knights andbarons, the companions of the realm, throughout the Palace that the man beforethem was Tristan. He informed them, in the terms which he had heard, why Tristanhad come to Ireland and how the latter had promised to give him guarantees inall the points which he, Gurmun, had stipulated, jointly with Mark's grandees.The Irish court was glad to hear this news. The great lords declared that it wasfitting and proper to make peace; for long-drawn enmity between them, as timewent on, brought nothing but loss. The King now requested Tristan to ratify theagreement, as he had promised him, and Tristan duly did so. He and all hissovereign's vassals swore that Isolde should have Cornwall for her nuptialdower, and be mistress of all England. Hereupon Gurmun solemnly surrenderedIsolde into the hands of Tristan her enemy. I say \"enemy\" for this reason: shehated him now as before.Tristan laid his hand upon Isolde: \"Sire,\" he said, \"lord of Ireland, we askyou, my lady and I, for her sake and for mine, to deliver up to her any knightsor pages that were surrendered to this land as tribute from Cornwall andEngland; for it is only right and just that they should be in my lady's charge,now that she is Queen of their country.\"\"With pleasure,\" said the King, \"it shall be done. It has our royal approvalthat they should all depart with you!\" This gave pleasure to many.Tristan then ordered a ship to be procured in addition to his own, to bereserved for Isolde and himself and any others he might choose. And when it hadbeen supplied, he made ready for the voyage. Wherever any of the exiles weretraced, up and down the land, at court or in the country, they were sent for atonce.While Tristan and his compatriots were making ready, Isolde, the prudent Queen,was brewing in a vial a love-drink so subtly devised and prepared, and endowedwith such powers, that with whomever any man drank it he had to love her aboveall things, whether he wished it or no, and she love him alone. They would shareone death and one life, one sorrow and one joy.The wise lady took this philtre and said softly to Brangane: \"Brangane, dearniece, do not let it depress you, but you must go away with my daughter. Frameyour thoughts to that, and listen to what I say. Take this flask with itsdraught, have it in your keeping, and guard it above all your possessions. Seeto it that absolutely no one gets to hear of it. Take care that nobody drinksany! When Isolde and Mark have been united in love, make it your strict concernto pour out this liquor as wine for them, and see that they drink it all betweenthem. Beware lest anyone share with them—this stands to reason—and do not drinkwith them yourself. This brew is a love-philtre! Bear it well in mind! I mostdearly and urgently commend Isolde to your care. The better part of my life isbound up with her. Remember that she and I are in your hands, by all your hopesof Paradise! Need I say more?\"\"Dearest lady,\" answered Bragane, \"if you both wish it, I shall gladly accompanyher and watch over her honour and all her affairs, as well as ever I can.\"Tristan and all his men took their leave, in one place and another. They leftWexford with jubilation. And now, out of love for Isolde, the King and Queen andthe whole court followed him down to the harbour. The girl he never dreamt wouldbe his love, his abiding anguish of heart, radiant, exquisite Isolde, was thewhole time weeping beside him. Her mother and father passed the brief hour withmuch lamenting. Many eyes began to redden and fill with tears. Isolde broughtdistress to many hearts, for to many she was a source of secret pain. They weptunceasingly for their eyes' delight, Isolde. There was universal weeping. Manyhearts and many eyes wept there together, both openly and in secret.And now that Isolde and Isolde, the Sun and her Dawn, and the fair Full Moon,Brangane, had to take their leave, the One from the Two, sorrow and grief weremuch in evidence. That faithful alliance was severed with many a pang. Isoldekissed the pair of them many; many times.When the Cornishmen and the ladies' Irish attendants had embarked and saidgood-bye, Tristan was last to go on board. The dazzling young Queen, the Flowerof Ireland, walked hand in hand with him, very sad and dejected. They bowedtowards the shore and invoked God's blessing on the land and on its people. Thenthey put to sea, and, as they got under way, began to sing the anthem \"We sailin God's name\" with high, clear voices, and they sang it once again as they spedonward on their course.Now Tristan had arranged for a private cabin to be given to the ladies for theircomfort during the voyage. The Queen occupied it with her ladies-in-waiting andno others were admitted, with the occasional exception of Tristan.He sometimes went in to console the Queen as she sat weeping. She wept and shelamented amid her tears that she was leaving her homeland, whose people sheknew, and all her friends in this fashion, and was sailing away with strangers,she neither knew whither nor how. And so Tristan would console her as tenderlyas he could. Always when he came and found her sorrowing he took her in his armsgently and quietly and in no other way than a liege might hand his lady. Theloyal man hoped to comfort the girl in her distress. But whenever he put his armround her, fair Isolde recalled her uncle's death.Meanwhile the ships sped on their course. They both had a favourable wind andwere making good headway. But the fair company, Isolde and her train, wereunused to such hard going in wind and water. Quite soon they were in raredistress. Their Captain, Tristan, gave orders to put to shore and lie idle for awhile. When they had made land and anchored in a haven, most of those on boardwent ashore for exercise. But Tristan went without delay to see his radiant ladyand pass the time of day with her. And when he had sat down beside her and theywere discussing various matters of mutual interest he called for something todrink.Now, apart from the Queen, there was nobody in the cabin but some very youngladies-in-waiting. \"Look,\" said one of them, \"here is some wine in this littlebottle.\" No, it held no wine, much as it resembled it. It was their lastingsorrow, their never-ending anguish, of which at last they died! But the childwas not to know that. She rose and went at once to where the draught had beenhidden in its vial. She handed it to Tristan, their Captain, and he handed it toIsolde. She drank after long reluctance, then returned it to Tristan, and hedrank, and they both of them thought it was wine. At that moment in cameBrangane, recognized the flask, and saw only too well what was afoot. She was soshocked and startled that it robbed her of her strength and she turned as paleas death. With a heart that had died within her she went and seized that cursed,fatal flask, bore it off and flung it into the wild and raging sea!\"Alas, poor me,\" cried Brangane, \"Alas that ever I was born! Wretch that I am,how I have ruined my honour and trust! May God show everlasting pity that I evercame on this journey and that death failed to snatch me, when I was sent on thisill-starred voyage with Isolde! Ah, Tristan and Isolde, this draught will beyour death!\"Now when the maid and the man, Isolde and Tristan, had drunk the draught, in aninstant that arch-disturber of tranquility was there, Love, way-layer of allhearts, and she had stolen in! Before they were aware of it she had planted hervictorious standard in their two hearts and bowed them beneath her yoke. Theywho were two and divided now became one and united. No longer were they atvariance: Isolde's hatred was gone. Love, the reconciler, had purged theirhearts of enmity, and so joined them in affection that each was to the other aslimpid as a mirror. They shared a single heart. Her anguish was his pain: hispain her anguish. The two were one both in joy and in sorrow, yet they hid theirfeelings from each other. This was from doubt and shame. She was ashamed, as hewas. She went in doubt of him, as he of her. However blindly the craving intheir hearts was centred on one desire, their anxiety was how to begin. Thismasked their desire from each other.When Tristan felt the stirrings of love he at once remembered loyalty andhonour, and strove to turn away. \"No, leave it, Tristan,\" he was continuallythinking to himself, \"pull yourself together, do not take any notice of it.\" Buthis heart was impelled towards her. He was striving against his own wishes,desiring against his desire. He was drawn now in one direction, now in another.Captive that he was, he tried all that he knew in the snare, over and overagain, and long maintained his efforts.The loyal man was afflicted by a double pain: when he looked at her face andsweet Love began to wound his heart and soul with her, he bethought himself ofHonour, and it retrieved him. But this in turn was the sign for Love, his liegelady, whom his father had served before him, to assail him anew, and once morehe had to submit. Honour and Loyalty harassed him powerfully, but Love harassedhim more. Love tormented him to an extreme, she made him suffer more than didHonour and Loyalty combined. His heart smiled upon Isolde, but he turned hiseyes away: yet his greatest grief was when he failed to see her. As is the wayof captives, he fixed his mind on escape and how he might elude her, andreturned many times to this thought: \"Turn one way, or another! Change thisdesire! Love and like elsewhere!\" But the noose was always there. He took hisheart and soul and searched them for some change: but there was nothing therebut Love—and Isolde.And so it fared with her. Finding this life unbearable, she, too, made ceaselessefforts. When she recognized the lime that bewitching Love had spread and sawthat she was deep in it, she endeavoured to reach dry ground, she strove to beout and away. But the lime kept clinging to her and drew her back and down. Thelovely woman fought back with might and main, but stuck fast at every step. Shewas succumbing against her will. She made desperate attempts on many sides, shetwisted and turned with hands and feet and immersed them ever deeper in theblind sweetness of Love, and of the man. Her limed senses failed to discover anypath, bridge, or track that would advance them half a step, half a foot, withoutLove being there too. Whatever Isolde thought, whatever came uppermost in hermind, there was nothing there, of one sort or another, but Love, and Tristan.This was all below the surface, for her heart and her eyes were at variance—Modesty chased her eyes away, Love drew her heart towards him. That warringcompany, a Maid and a Man, Love and Modesty, brought her into great confusion;for the Maid wanted the Man, yet she turned her eyes away: Modesty wanted Love,but told no one of her wishes. But what was the good of that? A Maid and herModesty are by common consent so fleeting a thing, so shortlived a blossoming,they do not long resist. Thus Isolde gave up her struggle and accepted hersituation. Without further delay the vanquished girl resigned herself body andsoul to Love and to the man.Isolde glanced at him now and again and watched him covertly, her bright eyesand her heart were now in full accord. Secretly and lovingly her heart and eyesdarted at the man rapaciously, while the man gave back her looks with tenderpassion. Since Love would not release him, he too began to give ground. Wheneverthere was a suitable occasion the man and the maid came together to feast eachother's eves. These lovers seemed to each other fairer than before—such is Love's law, such is the way with affection. It is so this year, it wasso last year and it will remain so among all lovers as long as Love endures,that while their affection is growing and bringing forth blossom and increase ofall lovable things, they please each other more than ever they did when it firstbegan to burgeon. Love that bears increase makes lovers fairer than at first.This is the seed of Love, from which it never dies.Love seems fairer than before and so Love's rule endures. Were Love to seem thesame as before, Loves rule would soon wither away.THE CAVE OF LOVERSTristan had long known of a cavern in a savage mountainside, on which he hadchanced when his way had led him there out hunting. The cavern had been hewninto the wild mountain in heathen times, before Corynaeus' day, when giantsruled there. They used to hide inside it when, desiring to make love, theyneeded privacy. Wherever such a cavern was found it was barred by a door ofbronze, and bore an inscription to Love— lafossiure a la gent amant, which is tosay \"The Cave of Lovers.\"The name was well suited to the thing. The story tells us that this grotto wasround, broad, high, and perpendicular, snow-white, smooth, and even, throughoutits whole circumference. Above, its vault was finely keyed, and on the keystonethere was a crown most beautifully adorned with goldsmiths' work and encrustedwith precious stones. Below, the pavement was of smooth, rich, shining marble,as green as grass. At the centre there was a bed most perfectly cut from a slabof crystal, broad, high, well raised from the ground, and engraved along itssides with letters, announcing that the bed was dedicated to the Goddess ofLove. In the upper part of the grotto some small windows had been hewn out tolet in the light, and these shone in several places.Where one went in and out there was a door of bronze. Outside, above the door,there stood three limes of many branches, but beyond them not a single one. Yeteverywhere downhill there were innumerable trees which cast the shade of theirleafy boughs upon the mountainside. Somewhat apart, there was a level gladethrough which there flowed a spring—a cool, fresh brook, clear as the sun. Abovethat, too, there stood three limes, fair and very stately, sheltering the brookfrom sun and rain. The bright flowers and the green grass, with which the gladewas illumined, vied with each other most delightfully, each striving to outshinethe other. At their due times you could hear the sweet singing of the birds.Their music was so lovely—even lovelier here than elsewhere. Both eye and earfound their pasture and delight there: the eye its pasture, the ear its delight.There were shade and sunshine, air and breezes, both soft and gentle. Away fromthe mountain and its cave for fully a day's journey there were rocks unrelievedby open heath, and wilderness and wasteland. No paths or tracks had been laidtowards it of which one might avail oneself. But the country was not so roughand fraught with hardship as to deter Tristan and his beloved from halting thereand making their abode within that mountaincave.Some people are smitten with curiosity and astonishment, and plague themselveswith the question how these two companions, Tristan and Isolde, nourishedthemselves in this wasteland? I will tell them and assuage their curiosity. Theylooked at one another and nourished themselves with that! Their sustenance wasthe eye's increase. They fed in their grotto on nothing but love and desire. Thetwo lovers who formed its court had small concern for their provender. Hiddenaway in their hearts they carried the best nutriment to be had anywhere in theworld, which offered itself unasked ever fresh and new. I mean pure devotion,love made sweet as balm that consoles body and sense so tenderly, and sustainsthe heart and spirit—this was their best nourishment. Truly, they neverconsidered any food but that from which the heart drew desire, the eyes delight,and which the body, too, found agreeable. With this they had enough. Love droveher ancient plough for them, keeping pace all the time, and gave them anabundant store of all those things that go to make heaven on earth. Their highfeast was Love, who gilded all their joys; she brought them King Arthur's RoundTable as homage and all its company a thousand times a day! What better foodcould they have for body or soul? Man was there with Woman, Woman there withMan. What else should they be needing? They had what they were meant to have,they had reached the goal of their desire.Now some people are so tactless as to declare (though I do not accept it myself)that other food is needed for this pastime. I am not so sure that it is. Thereis enough here in my opinion. But if anyone has discovered better nourishment inthis world let him speak in the light of his experience. There was a time whenI, too, led such a life, and I thought it quite sufficient.Now I beg you to bear with me while I reveal to you on account of what hiddensignificance that cave was thus constructed in the rock.It was, as I said, round, broad, high, and perpendicular, snow-white, smooth,and even, throughout its whole circumference. Its roundness inside betokensLove's Simplicity: Simplicity is most fitting for Love, which must have nocorners, that is, Cunning or Treachery. Breadth signifies Love's Power, for herPower is without end. Height is Aspiration that mounts aloft to the clouds:nothing is too great for it so long as it means to climb, up and up, to wherethe molten Crown of the Virtues gathers the vault to the keystone. The Virtuesare invariably encrusted with precious stones, inlaid in filigree of gold and soadorned with praise, that we who are of lower aspiration—whose spirits flag andflutter over the pavement and neither settle nor fly—we gaze up intently at themasterpiece above us, which derives from the Virtues and descends to us from theglory of those who float in the clouds above us and send their refulgence downto us!— we gaze at them and marvel! From this grow the feathers by which ourspirit takes wing and, flying, brings forth praise and soars in pursuit of thoseVirtues.The wall was white, smooth, and even: such is Integrity's nature. Her brilliantand uniform whiteness must never be mottled with colour, nor should Suspicionfind any pit or ridge in her. In its greenness and firmness the marble floor islike Constancy; this meaning is the best for it in respect of colour andsmoothness. Constancy should be of the same fresh green as grass, and smooth andgleaming as glass.At the centre, the bed of crystalline Love was dedicated to her name mostfittingly. The man who had cut the crystal for her couch and her observance haddivined her nature unerringly: Love should be of crystal—transparent andtranslucent!Overhead, three little windows in all had been hewn through the solid rock intothe cave, very secretly and neatly, through which the sun would shine. The firststood for Kindness, the second for Humility, the third for Breeding. Throughthese three, the sweet light, that blessed radiance, Honour, dearest of allluminaries, smiled in and lit up that cave of earthly bliss.It also has its meaning that the grotto was so secluded in the midst of thiswild solitude, in that one may well compare it with this—that Love and herconcerns are not assigned to the streets nor yet to the open country. She ishidden away in the wilds, the country that leads to her refuge makes hard andarduous going—mountains are strewn about the way in many a massive curve. Thetracks up and down are so obstructed with rocks for us poor sufferers that,unless we keep well to the path, if we make one false step we shall never getback alive. But whoever is so blessed as to reach and enter that solitude willhave used his efforts to most excellent purpose, for he will find his heart'sdelight there. Whatever the ear yearns to hear, whatever gratifies the eye, thiswilderness is full of it. He would hate to be elsewhere.I know this well, for I have been there. I, too, have tracked and followed afterwildfowl and game, after hart and hind in the wilderness over many a woodlandstream and yet passed my time and not seen the end of the chase. My toils werenot crowned with success. I have found the lever and seen the latch in that caveand have, on occasion, even pressed on to the bed of crystal—I have danced thereand back some few times. But never have I had my repose on it. However hard thefloor of marble beside it, I have so battered the floor with my steps that, hadit not been saved by its greenness, in which lies its chiefest virtue, and fromwhich it constantly renews itself, you would have traced Love's authentic trackson it. I have also fed my eyes on the gleaming wall abundantly and have fixed mygaze on the medallion, on the vault and on the keystone, and worn out my eyeslooking up at its ornament, so bespangled with Excellence! The sun-givingwindows have often sent their rays into my heart. I have known that cave since Iwas eleven, yet I never set foot in Cornwall.THE POISONED SPEARMy lords, this tale is told in many ways, so I shall keep to one version in myrhymes, saying as much as is needed and passing over the remainder. But thematter diverges at this point and I do not wish to keep too much to one account.Those who narrate and tell the tale of Tristran tell it differently—I have heardvarious people do so. I know well enough what each says and what they have putinto writing; but to judge by what I have heard, they do not follow Breri, whoknew all the deeds and stories of all the kings and all the counts that hadlived in Britain. Moreover, mary of us are unwilling to assent to what narratorssay aboutthe dwarf, whose wife Caerdin is supposed to have loved. The dwarf in turn issaid by great guile to have dealt Tristran a poisoned wound, after maimingCaerdin; and because of this wound Tristran sent Guvernal to England to fetchYsolt. Thomas declines to accept this and is ready to prove that it could nothave been the case. Guvernal was a familiar figure in all that region, and itwas known throughout the kingdom that he was a partner in their intrigue andmessenger to Ysolt. The King hated him for it mightily and set his men on thewatch for him. Thus how could Guvernal come to offer the King, the barons, andthe Serjeants his service at court, as if he were a foreign merchant, withoutbeing quickly recognized, so well known was he? I do not know how he could haveavoided detection or fetched Ysolt away. Such narrators have strayed from thestory and departed from the truth, and if they are unwilling to admit it, I haveno mind to wrangle with them—let them hold to theirs and I to mine. The talewill bear me out.Tristran and Caerdin returned to Brittany in good spirits and amused themselveshappily with their friends and followers. One day they were out hunting until itwas time to return. Their companions had gone on ahead of them. There was nonethere but these two. They were traversing La Blanche Lande, keeping the sea totheir right. They observe a knight approaching at the gallop on a piebald steed.He is armed very splendidly: he bears a shield of gold fretted with vair, andhas the lance, pennant, and cognizance of the same tincture. He comes gallopingdown a path, covered and protected by his shield. He is tall and big and veryrobust; he is armed, and a fine knight. Tristran and Caerdin wait to meet him onthe path together, very curious to know who he is. When he sees them he comes ontowards them and then bows to them very courteously. Tristran returns hisgreeting and then asks him where he is going, what his business is, and why heis in such haste.\"Sir,\" replied the knight, \"would you tell me the way to the castle of Tristranthe Amorous?\"\"What do you want with him?\" asked Tristran. \"Who are you? What is your name? Wewill gladly take you to his house; but if you wish to speak with Tristran youneed not go any farther, for Tristran is my name. Now tell me what you want.\"\"This is pleasant news for me,\" answered the other. \"I am called 'DwarfTristran.' I am of the Marches of Brittany and live hard by the Sea of Spain. Ihad a castle there and a fair mistress, whom I love as much as life; but I havelost her through great misadventure. The night before last she was stolen fromme. Es-tult l'Orgillus of Castel Fer has had her carried off by force. He holdsher in his castle and does with her just as he pleases. I suffer such grief inmy heart from it that I am almost dead of sorrow, misery, and anguish. I do notknow what in the world I can do. I cannot find solace without her, for I havelost my happiness, my joy, and my delight, and I value my life now but littleLord Tristran, I have heard say that whoever is bereft of what he most desirescares little for what remains. I have never been so unhappy, and this is why Ihave come to you. You are feared and held in great dread and are altogether thebest knight, the noblest, the most just and, of all who ever lived, he that hasloved most! So I beg you to have pity, sir, I call upon your magnanimity andimplore you to accompany me on this taskand win me back my mistress. I will do homage and allegiance to you, if you willhelp me to accomplish this thing!\"\"Indeed I will help you all I can, my friend,\" answered Tristran. \"But now letus go home. We shall start out towards daybreak and execute our business.\"He sends for his arms and equips himself, and then rides away with DwarfTristran. They go to lie in wait for Estult l'Orgillus of Castel Fer, to killhim. They have travelled until they have found his strong castle. They dismountat the skirts of a wood and there await events.Estult l'Orgillus was very haughty, and he had six brothers who were knights,bold, valiant, and excellent warriors; but in valour he surpassed them all. Twoof these were returning from a tournament, and the two Tristrans lay in wait forthem by the wood. They quickly shouted their challenge to them and then struckat them fiercely. The two brothers were killed there. The cry was raised throughthe countryside, and the lord heard the alarm. Those in the castle mounted andattacked the two Tristrans with impetuous onslaught. The latter were excellentknights, and skilled at bearing arms. They defended themselves against all asbold and valiant knights. They did not cease from fighting till they had slainthe four. Tristran the Dwarf was struck down dead, the other Tristran waswounded through the loins by a lance bated with venom. Stung to anger, he tookample vengeance, for he killed the man who wounded him. And now all sevenbrothers are slain, one Tristrain is dead and the other in evil case, in that heis severely wounded in his body.Tristran has turned back with great difficulty because of the anguish that gripshim. By great effort he reaches home and has his wounds dressed. He sends fordoctors to aid him and many are sent to him. But none can cure him of thepoison, for they do not recognize it, and so they are all misled. They cannotmake any plaster that will cast or draw it out. They bruise and pound rootsenough, they cull herbs and make medicines, but fail to do him any good.Tristran only grows worse. The venom spreads all over his body and makes itswell up, both inside and out. He grows black and discoloured, he losesstrength, his bones now show through the skin. He now knows that he will losehis life unless he is succoured at once, and he sees that none can cure him andtherefore he must die. No one knows any medicine for this malady: and yet, ifQueen Ysolt knew that he had this great ill and were at his side, she would healhim completely. But he is unable to go to her or to suffer the hardship of thesea. Moreover, he fears that country, since he has many enemies there. And Ysoltcannot come to him either, so fee does not know how he may be healed. He suffersgreat sorrow at heart; for his slow torment, his malady, and the stench of hiswound distress him. He laments his lot and is deeply afflicted, for the poisoncruelly torments him.CAERDIN'S MISSIONTristran sends for Caerdin privately in the wish to reveal his sorrow to him; hehad a loyal affection for Caerdin, and Caerdin loved him in return. He had thechamber in which he lay cleared of people, he would let none but themselvesremain in the house while they took counsel together. But Ysolt of the WhiteHands wonders in her heart what it can be that he wishes to do, whether he meansto forsake the world and turn monk or canon. She is greatly perturbed by this.She goes and stands beside the wall outside his chamber, opposite his bed, forshe wants to listen to what they say. She gets a friend to stand guard for herfor as long as she stays by the wall. With great effort Tristran has managed tolean on his elbow against the wall. Caerdin sits beside him and the two of themare weeping and lamenting piteously and that their good fellowship, their love,and their friendship will be severed after so brief a space. In their heartsthey have pity and sorrow, anguish, affliction, and pain. Each is sad for theother. They weep and make much lamentation, since now their affection, which hasbeen so loyal and true, must be parted.Tristran addresses Caerdin. \"Listen, fair friend,\" he says, \"I am in a foreigncountry. Fair companion, I have no friend or relation but you. I have had nopleasure or happiness here apart from the comfort you have given me. I amconvinced that, if I were in my own country, I could get help to cure me. Butbecause I have no aid here I am dying, my fair, sweet friend. Without aid I mustdie; for apart from Queen Ysolt no human being can cure me. She can cure me ifshe wishes: she has the power and the remedy, and she has the wish, if only sheknew of my wound. But, dear friend, I do not know what to do—by what strate-gemshe may know of it. For I am sure that she could help me with this illness andheal my wound with her skill, if she but knew of it.—But how can she come here?If I knew anyone who would go and take my message to her, she would give me somegood help as soon as she learned of my great need. I trust her so well that I amquite sure that she would let nothing prevent her from helping me in mydistress, so firm is the love she bears me. I certainly cannot help myself. Forthis reason, my friend, I appeal to you: out of friendship and generosity,undertake this service for me! Bear me this message for the sake of ourcompanionship and by the pledge you gave with your hand when Ysolt bestowedBreng-vein on you, and I will give you my own pledge here that, if you willundertake this journey for me, I will become your liege man and love you aboveall else!\"Caerdin sees Tristran weeping, he hears him lament and despair and it makes himvery sad, so that he replies with tender affection. \"Dear companion,\" he says,\"do not weep, and I will do all you wish. Believe me, my friend, to make youwell I shall go very close to death and into mortal danger to win your comfort.By the loyalty which I owe you, it will not be my fault or for want of anythingthat I can do or for any distress or hardship if I fail to exert all my strengthto carry out your wish. Tell me the message that you wish me to take to her, andI will go and make ready.\"\"Thank you,\" answered Tristran. \"Now listen to what I shall tell you. Take thisring with you—it is our secret token. And when you come to that country, go tocourt, pretend to be a merchant, and carry fine cloths of silk with you. Be surethat she sees this ring; for as soon as she has set eyes on it and recognizedyou, she will seek a subtle pretext for talking with you when she can. Greet herand wish her health from me, for without her there is none in me. I send her somany wishes for her well-being that none remains with me. My heart salutes herin hopes of healing, since, without her, health will not return to me. I senther allmy health. I shall never have succour in my life, or health or healing, unlessshe bring them. If she does not bring me health or succour me with her own lips,then my health will remain with her and I shall die of my great pain. In fine,tell her I am dead, unless I have comfort of her! Make my distress plain to her,and the malady of which I am languishing, and tell her to come and succour me.\"THE DEATH OF TRISTRAN AND YSOLTTristran lies on his bed languishing of his wound. He can find no succour inanything. Medicine cannot avail him; nothing that he does affords him any aid.He longs for the coming of Ysolt, desiring nothing else. Without her he can haveno ease—it is because of her that he lives so long. There, in his bed, he pinesand he waits for her. He has high hopes that she will come and heal his malady,and believes that he will not live without her. Each day he sends to the shoreto see if the ship is returning, with no other wish in his heart. And many isthe time that he commands his bed to be made beside the sea and has himselfcarried out to it, to await and see the ship—what way she is making, and withwhat sail? He has no desire for anything, except for the coming of Ysolt: hiswhole mind, will, and desire are set on it. Whatever the world holds he rates ofno account unless the Queen is coming to him. Then he has himself carried backagain from the fear which he anticipates, for he dreads that she may not come,may not keep her faith with him, and he would much rather hear it from anotherthan see the ship come without her. He longs to look out for the ship, but doesnot wish to know it, should she fail to come. There is anguish in his heart, andhe is full of desire to see her. He often laments to his wife but does not tellher what he longs for, apart from Caerdin, who does not come. Seeing him delayso long Tristran greatly fears that Caerdin has failed in his mission.While they are happily sailing, there is a spell of warm weather and the winddrops so that they can make no headway. The sea is very smooth and still, theship moves neither one way nor the other save so far as the swell draws it. Theyare also without their boat. And now they are in great distress. They see theland close ahead of them, but have no wind with which to reach it. And so up anddown they go drifting, now back, now forward. They cannot make any progress andare very badly impeded. Ysolt is much afflicted by it. She sees the land she haslonged for and yet she cannot reach it: she all but dies of her longing. Thosein the ship long for lane*, but the wind is too light for them. Time and again,Ysolt laments her fate. Those on the shore long for the ship, but they have notseen it yet. Thus Tristran is wretched and sorrowful, he often laments and sighsfor Ysolt, whom he so much desires. The tears flow from his eyes, he writhesabout, he all but dies of longing.While Tristran endures such affliction, his wife Ysolt comes -and stands beforehim. Meditating great guile she says: \"Caerdin is coming, my love! I have seenhis ship on the sea. I saw it making hardly any headway but nevertheless I couldsee it well enough to know that it is his. God grant it brings news that willcomfort you at heart!\"Tristran starts up at this news. \"Do you know for sure that it is his ship, mydarling?\" he asks. \"Tell me now, what sort of sail is it?\"\"I know it for a fact!\" answered Ysolt. \"Let me tell you, the sail is all black!They have hoisted it and raised it up high because they have no wind!\"At this Tristran feels such pain that he has never had greater nor ever will,and he turns his face to the wall and says: \"God save Ysolt and me! Since youwill not come to me I must die for your love. I can hold on to life no longer. Idie for you, Ysolt, dear love! You have no pity for my sufferings, but you willhave sorrow of my death. It is a great solace to me that you will have pity formy death.\"Three times did he say \"Dearest Ysolt.\" At the fourth he rendered up his spirit.Thereupon throughout the house the knights and companions weep. Their cries areloud, their lament is great. Knights and Serjeants rise to their feet and bearhim from his bed, then lay him upon a cloth of samite and cover him with astriped pall.And now the wind has risen on the sea. It strikes the middle of the sailyard andbrings the ship to land. Ysolt has quickly disembarked, she hears the greatlaments in the street and the bells from the minsters and chapels. She askspeople what news? and why they toll the bells so? and the reason for theirweeping? Then an old man answers: \"My lady, as God help me, we have greatersorrow than people ever had before. Gallant, noble Tristran, who was a source ofstrength to the whole realm, is dead! He was generous to the needy, a greatsuccour to the wretched. He has died just now in his bed of a wound that hisbody received. Never did so great a misfortune befall this realm!\"As soon as Ysolt heard this news she was struck dumb with grief. So afflicted isshe that she goes up the street to the Palace in advance of the others, withouther cloak. The Bretons have never seen a woman of her beauty; in the city theywonder whence she comes and who she may be. Ysolt goes to where she sees hisbody lying, and, turning towards the east, she prays for him piteously.\"Tristran, my love, now that I see you dead, it is against reason for me to livelonger. You died for my love, and I, love, die of grief, for I could not come intime to heal you and your wound. My love, my love, nothing shall ever console mefor your death, neither joy nor pleasure nor any delight. May this storm beaccursed that so delayed me on the sea, my sweetheart, so that I could not come!Had I arrived in time, I would have given you back your life and spoken gentlyto you of the love there was between us. I should have bewailed our fate, ourjoy, our rapture, and the great sorrow and pain that have been in our loving. Ishould have reminded you of this and kissed you and embraced you. If I hadfailed to cure you, then we could have died together. But since I could not comein time and did not hear what had happened and have come and found you dead, Ishall console myself by drinking of the same cup. You have forfeited your lifeon my account, and I shall do as a true lover: I will die for you in return!\"She takes him in her arms and then, lying at full length, she kisses his faceand lips and clasps him tightly to her. Then straining body to body, mouth tomouth, she at once renders up her spirit and of sorrow for her lover dies thusat his side.Tristran died of his longing, Ysolt because she could not come in time.Tris-tran died for his love; fair Ysolt because of tender pity.Here Thomas ends his book. Now he takes leave of all lovers, the sad and theamorous, the jealous and the desirous, the gay and the distraught, and all whowill hear these lines. If I have not pleased all with my tale, I have told it tothe best of my power and have narrated the whole truth, as I promised at thebeginning. Here I have recounted the story in rhyme, and have done this to holdup an example, and to make this story more beautiful, so that it may pleaselovers, and that, here and there, they may find some things to take to heart.May they derive great comfort from it, in the face of fickleness and injury, inthe face of hardship and grief, in the face of all the wiles of Love.The Knight of the CartSIR THOMAS MALORYThis is Malory's English version of Chretien de Troyes's Knight of the Cart.Chretien wrote many of the Arthurian legends in the court of Marie de Champagne.This story is also known as Lancelot, the main character of the story. Whilepreserving all of the essentials, it is much shorter than Chretiens romance,which is 7,000 lines in length.Jo it befell in the month of May, Queen Guinevere called unto her ten knights ofthe Table Round, and she gave them warning that early upon the morn she wouldride on-maying into woods and fields besides Westminster:\"And I warn you that there be none of you but he be well horsed, and that ye allbe clothed all in green, either in silk other in cloth. And I shall bring withme ten ladies, and every knight shall have a lady by him. And every knight shallhave a squire and two yeomen; and I will that all be well horsed.\"So they made them ready in the freshest manner, and these were the names of theknights: Sir Kay le Seneschal, Sir Agravain, Sir Braundiles, Sir Sagramore leDesirous, Sir Dodinas le Savage, Sir Ozanna le Cure Hardy, Sir Ladinas of theForest Savage, Sir Persaunt of Inde, Sir Ironside, that was called the Knight ofthe Red Launds, and Sir Pelleas the Lover. And these ten knights made them readyin the freshest manner to ride with the queen.An so upon the morn or it were day, in a May morning, they took their horseswith the queen, and rode on-maying in woods and meadows as it pleased them, ingreat joy and delights. For the queen had cast to have been again with KingArthur at the furthest by ten of the clock, and so was that time her purpose.Then there was a knight which hight Sir Mellyagaunce, and he was son unto KingBagdemagus, and this knight had that time a castle of the gift of King Arthurwithin seven mile of Westminster. And this knight Sir Mellyagaunce lovedpassingly well Queen Guinevere, and so had he done long and many years. And thebook saith he had lain in await for to steal away the queen, but evermore heforbare for because of Sir Lancelot; for in no wise he would meddle with thequeen an Sir Lancelot were in her company other else an he were near-hand.But this knight Sir Mellyagaunce had espied the queen well and her purpose, andhow Sir Lancelot was not with her, and how she had no men of arms with her butthe ten noble knights all rayed in green for maying. Then he purveyed him atwenty men of arms and an hundred archers for to distress the queen and herknights; for he thought that time was best season to take the queen.So as the queen was out on-maying with all her knights, which were bedashed withherbs, mosses and flowers in the freshest manner, right so there came out of awood Sir Mellyaguance with an eight score men, all harnessed as they shouldfight in a battle of arrest, and bade the queen and her knights abide, formaugre their heads they should abide.\"Traitor knight,\" said Queen Guinevere, \"what cast thou to do? Wilt thou shamethyself? Bethink thee how thou art a king's son, and a knight of the TableRound, and thou thus to be about to dishonour the noble king that made theeknight! Thou shamest all knighthood and thyself and me. And I let thee wit thoushalt never shame me, for I had liefer cut mine own throat in twain rather thanthou should dishonour me!\"\"As for all this language,\" said Sir Mellyagaunce, \"be as it be may. For wit youwell, madam, I have loved you many a year, and never or now could I get you atsuch avail. And therefore I will take you as I find you.\"Then spake all the ten noble knights at once and said,\"Sir Mellyagaunce, wit thou well thou art about to jeopardy thy worship todishonour, and also ye cast to jeopardy your persons. Howbeit we be unarmed andye have us at a great advantage, for it seemeth by you that ye have laid watchupon us, but rather than ye should put the queen to a shame and us all, we hadas lief to depart from our lives, for an we otherways did we were shamedforever.\"Then said Sir Mellyaguance:\"Dress you as well ye can, and keep the queen!\"Then the ten knights of the Round Table drew their swords and these other letrun at them with their spears. And the ten knights manly abode them, and smoteaway their spears, that no spear did them no harm. Then they lashed togetherwith swords, and anon Sir Kay, Sir Sagramore, Sir Agravain, Sir Do-dinas, SirLadinas, and Sir Ozanna were smitted to the earth with grimly wounds. Then SirBraundiles and Sir Persaunt, Sir Ironside, and Sir Pelleas fought long, and theywere sore wounded, for these ten knights, or ever they were laid to the ground,slew forty men of the boldest and the best of them.So when the queen saw her knights thus dolefully wounded and needs must be slainat the last, then for very pity and sorrow she cried and said,\"Sir Mellyaguance, slay not my noble knights, and I will go with thee upon thiscovenant: that thou save them and suffer them no more to be hurt, with this438 Sir Thomas Malorythat they be led with me wheresomever thou leadest me. For I will rather slaymyself than I will go with thee, unless that these noble knights may be in mypresence.''\"Madam,'' said Sir Mellyagauance, \"for your sake they shall be led with you intomine own castle, with that ye will be ruled and ride with me.\"Then the queen prayed the four knights to leave their fighting, and she and theywould not depart.\"Madam,\" said Sir Pelleas, \"we will do as ye do, for as for me I take no forceof my life nor death.\"For, as the French book saith, Sir Pelleas gave such buffets there that nonearmour might hold him.Then by the queen's commandment they left battle and dressed the wounded knightson horseback, some sitting and some overthwart their horses, that it was pity tobehold. And then Sir Mellyagaunce charged the queen and all her knights thatnone of all her fellowship should depart from her, for full sore he dread SirLancelot du Lake, lest he should have any knowledging. And all this espied thequeen, and privily she called unto her a childe of her chamber which was swiftlyhorsed of a great advantage.\"Now go thou,\" siad she, \"when thou seest thy time, and bear this ring unto SirLancelot du Lake, and pray him as he loveth me that he will see me and rescueme, if ever he will have joy of me. And spare not thy horse,\" said the queen,\"nother for water nother for land.'So the child espied his time, and lightly he took his horse with spurs anddeparted as fast he might. And when Sir Mellyagaunce saw him so flee, heunderstood that it was by the queen's commandment for to warn Sir Lancelot. Thenthey that were best horsed chased him and shot at him, but from them all thechilde went deliverly.And then Sir Mellyaguance said unto the queen,\"Madam, ye are about to betray me, but I shall ordain for Sir Lancelot that heshall not come lightly at you.\"And then he rode with her and all the fellowship in all the haste that theymight. And so by the way Sir Mellyagaunce laid in bushment of the best archersthat he might get in his country, to the number of a thirty, to await upon SirLancelot, charging them that if they saw such a manner a knight come by the wayupon a white horse, \"that in any wise ye slay his horse, but in no manner haveye ado with him bodily, for he is overhardy to be overcome.\" So this was done,and they were come to his castle; but in no wise the queen would never let noneof the ten knights and her ladies out of her sight, but always they were in herpresence. For the book saith Sir Mellyagaunce durst make no masteries, for dreadof Sir Lancelot, insomuch he deemed that he had warning.So when the childe was departed from the fellowship of Sir Mellyagaunce, withina while he came to Westminster, and anon he found Sir Lancelot. And when he hadtold his message and delivered him the queen's ring,\"Alas!\" said Sir Lancelot, \"now am I shamed for ever, unless that I may rescuethat noble lady from dishonour.\"Then eagerly he asked his arms. And ever the childe told Sir Lancelot how theten knights fought marvellously, and how Sir Pelleas, and Sir Ironside, SirBraundiles, and Sir Persaunt of Inde fought strongly, but namely Sir Pelleas,there might none harness hold him; and how they all fought till they were laidto the earth, and how the queen made appointment for to save their lives and togo with Sir Mellyagaunce.\"Alas,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"that most noble lady, that she should be sodestroyed! I had liefer,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"than all France that I had beenthere well armed.\"So when Sir Lancelot was armed and upon his horse, he prayed the childe of thequeen's chamber to warn Sir Lavain how suddenly he was departed, and for whatcause. \"And pray him as he loveth me, that he will hie him after me, and that hestint not until he come to the castle where Sir Mellyagaunce abideth. Forthere,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"he shall hear of me an I be a man living, and thenshall I rescue the queen and the ten knights the which he traitorly hath taken,and that shall I prove upon his head, and all of them that hold with him.\"Then Sir Lancelot rode as fast as he might, and the book saith he took the waterat Westminster Bridge, and made his horse swim over the Thames unto Lambeth. Andso within a while he came to that same place thereas the ten noble knightsfought with Sir Mellyagaunce. And then Sir Lancelot followed the track untilthat he came to a wood, and there was a strait way, and there the thirty archersbade Sir Lancelot turn again, \"and follow no longer that track.\"\"What commandment have ye,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"to cause me, that am a knight ofthe Round Table, to leave my right way?\"\"These ways shalt thou leave, other else thou shalt go it on thy foot, for witthou well thy horse shall be slain.\"\"That is little mastery,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"to slay mine horse! But as formyself, when my horse is slain I give right nought of you, not an ye were fivehundred more!\"So then they shot Sir Lancelot's horse and smote him with many arrows. And thenSir Lancelot avoided his horse and went on foot, but there were so many ditchesand hedges betwixt them and him that he might not meddle with none of them.\"Alas, for shame!\" said Sir Lancelot, \"that ever one knight should betrayanother knight! But it is an old said saw, 'A good man is never in danger butwhen he is in the danger of a coward. \"Then Sir Lancelot walked on a while, and was sore acumbered of his armour, hisshield, and his spear. Wit you well he was full sore annoyed! And full loath hewas for to leave anything that longed unto him, for he dread sore the treason ofSir Mellyagaunce.Then by fortune there came by him a chariot that came thither to fetch wood.\"Say me, carter,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"what shall I give thee to suffer me toleap into thy chariot, and that thou will bring me unto a castle within this twomile?\"\"Thou shalt not enter this chariot,\" said the carter, \"for I am sent for tofetch wood.\"\"Unto whom?\" said Sir Lancelot.\"Unto my lord, Sir Mellyagaunce,\" said the carter.\"And with him would I speak,\" said Sir Lancelot.\"Thou shalt not go with me!\" said the carter.When Sir Lancelot leapt to him and gave him backward with his gauntlet arearmain that he fell to the earth stark dead, then the other carter, hisfellow, was afeared, and weened to have gone the same way. And then he said,\"Fair lord, save my life, and I shall bring you where ye will.\"\"Then I charge thee,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"that thou drive me and this chariotunto Sir Mellyagaunce gate.\"\"Then leap ye up into the chariot,\" said the carter, \"and ye shall be thereanon.\"So the carter drove on a great wallop, and Sir Lancelot's horse followed thechariot, with more than forty arrows in him.And more than an hour and an half Queen Guinevere was awaiting in a bay window.Then one of her ladies espied an armed knight standing in a chariot.\"Ah, see, madam,\" said the lady, \"where rideth in a chariot a goodly armedknight, and we suppose he rideth unto hanging.\"\"Where?\" said the queen.Then she espied by his shield that it was Sir Lancelot, and then she was warewhere came his horse after the chariot, and ever he trod his guts and his paunchunder his feet.\"Alas,\" said the queen, \"now I may prove and see that well is that creature thathath a trusty friend. A ha!\" said Queen Guinevere, \"I see well that ye were hardbestead when ye ride in a chariot.\" And then she rebuked that lady that likenedSir Lancelot to ride in a chariot to hanging: \"Forsooth, it was foul-mouthed,\"said the queen, \"and evil-likened, so for to liken the most noble knight of theworld unto such a shameful death. Ah! Jesu defend him and keep him,\" said thequeen, \"from all mischievous end!\"So by this was Sir Lancelot comen to the gates of that castle, and there hedescended down and cried, that all the castle might ring:\"Where art thou, thou false traitor, Sir Mellyagaunce, and knight of the TableRound? Come forth, thou traitor knight, thou and all thy fellowship with thee,for here I am, Sir Lancelot du Lake, that shall fight with you all!\"And therewithal he bare the gate wide open upon the porter, and smote him underthe ear with his gauntlet, that his neck brast in two pieces. When SirMellyagaunce heard that Sir Lancelot was comen he ran unto the queen and fellupon his knee and said:"},{"pageContent":"\"Mercy, madam, for now I put me wholly in your good grace.\"So Sir Lancelot had great cheer with the queen. And then he made a promise withthe queen that the same night he should come to a window outward toward agarden, and that window was barred with iron, and there Sir Lancelot promised tomeet her when all folks were on sleep.So then came Sir Lavain driving to the gates, saying, \"Where is my lord, SirLancelot?\" Anon he was sent for, and when Sir Lavain saw Sir Lancelot, he said,\"Ah, my lord, I found how ye were hard bestead, for I have found your horse thatwas slain with arrows.\"\"As for that,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"I pray you, Sir Lavain, speak ye of othermatters and let this pass, and right it another time an we may.\"Then the knights that were hurt were searched, and soft salves were laid totheir wounds, and so it passed on till supper time. And all the cheer that mightbe made them there was done unto the queen and all her knights. And whenseason was they went unto their chambers, but in no wise the queen would notsuffer her wounded knights to be from her, but that they were laid inwithdraughts by her chamber, upon beds and pallets, that she herself might see untothem that they wanted nothing.So when Sir Lancelot was in his chamber which was assigned unto him, he calledunto him Sir Lavain, and told him that night he must speak with his lady, QueenGuinevere.\"Sir,\" said Sir Lavain, \"let me go with you an it please you, for I dread mesore of the treason of Sir Mellyagaunce.\"\"Nay,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"I thank you, but I will have nobody with me.\"Then Sir Lancelot took his sword in his hand and privily went to the place wherehe had spied a ladder toforehand, and that he took under his arm, and bare itthrough the garden and set it up to the window. And anon the queen was thereready to meet him.And then they made their complaints to other of many divers things, and then SirLancelot wished that he might have comen in to her.\"Wit you well,\" said the queen. \"I would as fain as ye that ye might come in tome.\"\"Would ye so, madam,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"with your heart that I were with you?\"\"Yea, truly,\" said the queen.\"Then shall I prove my might,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"for your love.\"And then he set his hands upon the bars of iron and pulled at them with such amight that he brast them clean out of the stone walls. And therewithal one ofthe bars of iron cut the brawn of his hands throughout to the bone. And then heleapt into the chamber to the queen.\"Make ye no noise,\" said the queen, \"for my wounded knights lie here fast byme.\"So, to pass upon this tale, Sir Lancelot went to bed with the queen, and took noforce of his hurt hand, but took his pleasaunce and his liking until it was thedawning of the day; for wit you well he slept not, but watched. And when he sawhis time that he might tarry no longer, he took his leave and departed at thewindow, and put it together as well as he might again, and so departed unto hisown chamber. And there he told Sir Lavain how he was hurt. Then Sir Lavaindressed his hand and staunched it, and put upon it a glove, that it should notbe espied. And so they lay long abed in the morning till it was nine of theclock.Then Sir Mellyagaunce went to the queen's chamber and found her ladies thereready clothed.\"Ah, Jesu mercy,\" said Sir Mellyagaunce, \"what ails you, madam, that ye sleepthis long?\"And therewithal he opened the curtain for to behold her. And then was he warewhere she lay, and the head-sheet, pillow and over-sheet was bebled of the bloodof Sir Lancelot and of his hurt hand. When Sir Mellyagaunce espied that bloodthen he deemed in her that she was false to the king, and that some of thewounded knights had lain by her all that night.\"A ha, madam,\" said Sir Mellyagaunce, \"now I have found you a false traitressunto my lord Arthur, for now I prove well it was not for nought that ye laidthese wounded knights within the bounds of your chamber. Therefore I call you oftreason before my lord King Arthur. And now I have proved you, madam, with ashameful deed; and that they been all false, or some of them, I will make itgood, for a wounded knight this night hath lain by you.\"\"That is false,\" said the queen, \"that I will report me unto them.\"But when the ten knights heard of Sir Mellyagaunce's words, and then they spakeall at once, and said,\"Sir Mellyagaunce, thou falsely beliest my lady the queen, and that we will makegood upon thee, any of us. Now chose which thou list of us, when we are whole ofthe wounds thou gavest us.\"\"Ye shall not! Away with your proud language! For here ye may all see that awounded knight this night hath lain by the queen.\"Then they all looked and were sore ashamed when they saw that blood. And wit youwell Sir Mellyagaunce was passing glad that he had the queen at such advantage,for he deemed by that to hide his own treason.And so in this rumour came in Sir Lancelot and found them at a great affray.\"What array is this?\" said Sir Lancelot.Then Sir Mellagaunce told them what he had found, and so he showed him thequeen's bed.\"Now, truly,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"ye did not your part nor knightly, to touch aqueen's bed while it was drawn and she lying therein. And I dare say,\" said SirLancelot, \"my lord King Arthur himself would not have displayed her curtains,and she being within her bed, unless that it had pleased him to have lain himdown by her. And therefore, Sir Mellyagaunce, ye have done unworshipfully andshamefully to yourself.\"\"Sir, I wot not what ye mean,\" said Sir Mellyagaunce, \"but well I am sure therehath one of her hurt knights lain with her this night. And that will I provewith mine hands, that she is a traitress unto my lord King Arthur.\"\"Beware what ye do,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"for an ye say so, and will prove it, itwill be taken at your hands.\"\"My lord Sir Lancelot,\" said Sir Mellyagaunce, \"I read you beware what ye do;for though ye are never so good a knight, as I wot well ye are renowned the bestknight of the world, yet should ye be advised to do battle in a wrong quarrel,for God will have a stroke in every battle.\"\"As for that,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"God is to be dread! But as to that, I say nayplainly, that this night there lay none of these ten knights wounded with mylady Queen Guinevere, and that will I prove with mine hands that ye say untrulyin that. Now, what say ye?\" said Sir Lancelot.\"Thus I say,\" said Sir Mellyagaunce, \"here is my glove, that she is a traitressunto my lord King Arthur, and that this night one of the wounded knights laywith her.\"\"Well, sir, and I receive your glove,\" said Sir Lancelot.And anon they were sealed with their signets, and delivered unto the tenknights.And then Sir Lancelot and Sir Mellyagaunce dressed them together with spears asthunder, and there Sir Lancelot bare him quit over his horse's croup.And then Sir Lancelot alight and dressed his shield on his shoulder, and tookhis sword in his hand, and so they dressed to each other and smote many greatstrokes together. And at the last Sir Lancelot smote him such a buffet upon thehelmet that he fell on the one side to the earth. And then he cried upon himloud and said,\"Most noble knight, Sir Lancelot, save my life! For I yield me unto you, and Irequire you, as ye be a knight and fellow of the Table Round, slay me not, for Iyield me as overcomen; and whether I shall live or die I put me in the king'shand and yours.\"Then Sir Lancelot wist not what to do, for he had liefer than all the good inthe world he might be revenged upon him. So Sir Lancelot looked upon the queen,if he might espy by any sign or countenance what she would have done. And anonthe queen wagged her head upon Sir Lancelot, as who saith, \"Slay him!\" And fullwell knew Sir Lancelot by her signs that she would have him dead. Then SirLancelot bade him,\"Arise for shame, and perform this battle with me to the utterance.\"\"Nay,\" said Sir Mellyagaunce, \"I will never arise until that ye take me asyolden and recreant.\"\"Well, I shall proffer you a large proffer,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"that is for tosay I shall unarm my head and my left quarter of my body, all that may beunarmed as for that quarter, and I will let bind my left hand behind me there itshall not help me, and right so I shall do battle with you.\"Then Sir Mellyagaunce start up and said on hight,\"Take heed, my lord Arthur, of this proffer, for I will take it. And let him bedisarmed and bounden according to his proffer.\"\"What say ye?\" said King Arthur unto Sir Lancelot. \"Will ye abide by yourproffer?\"\"Yea, my lord,\" said Sir Lancelot, \"for I will never go from that I have oncesaid.\"Then the knights' partners of the field disarmed Sir Lancelot, first his headand then his left arm and his left side, and they bound his left arm to his leftside fast behind his back, without shield or anything. And anon they yodetogether.Wit you well there was many a lady and many a knight marvelled of Sir Lancelotthat would jeopardy himself in such wise.Then Sir Mellyagaunce came with sword all on hight, and Sir Lancelot showed himopenly his bare head and the bare left side. And when he weened to have smittenhim upon the bare head, then lightly he devoided to the left leg and the leftside, and put his hand and his sword to that stroke, and so put it on side withgreat sleight. And then with great force Sir Lancelot smote him on the helmetwith such a buffet that the stroke carved the head in two parties.Then there was no more to do, but he was drawn out of the field, and at thegreat instance of the knights of the Table Round the king suffered him to beinterred, and the mention made upon him who slew him and for what cause he wasslain.And then the king and the queen made more of Sir Lancelot, and more he wascherished than ever he was aforehand.. . . And so I leave here of this tale and overleap great books of Sir Lancelot,what great adventures he did when he was called Le Chevalier de Chariot. For, asthe French book saith, because of despite that knights and ladies called him\"the knight that rode in the chariot,\" like as he were judged to the gibbet,therefore, in the despite of all them that named him so, he was carried in achariot a twelvemonth; but for little after that he had slain Sir Mellyagauncein the queen's quarrel he never of a twelvemonth come on horseback. And as theFrench book saith, he did that twelvemonth more than forty battles.The Art of Courtly LoveANDREAS CAPELLANUSLike Chretien de Troyes, Andreas (or Andrew the Chaplain) was in service toMarie de Champagne and this book was written at her request. It gives afascinating portrait of life at the court of Queen Eleanor in the last decadesof the twelfth century. The original Latin title is De Arte Honeste Amandi [theart of honest or honourable love]. That would certainly be a more accurate titlesince Andreas advocates a love that comes from the heart and not from economicconvenience as was common for medieval marriage. But the term \"courtly love\" hasbeen generally used since the nineteenth century. Andreas s book gained a greatdeal of fame throughout Europe as a serious treatment of love, until it wascondemned as immoral and heretical by the Bishop of Paris in 1277.BOOK ONEIntroduction to the Treatise on LoveW e must first consider what love is, whence it gets its name, what the effectof love is, between what persons love may exist, how it may be acquired,retained, increased, decreased, and ended, what are the signs that one's love isreturned, and what one of the lovers ought to do if the other is unfaithful.Chapter 1. What Love IsLove is a certain inborn suffering derived from the sight of and excessivemeditation upon the beauty of the opposite sex, which causes each one to wishabove all things the embraces of the other and by common desire to carry out allof love's precepts in the other's embrace.That love is suffering is easy to see, for before the love becomes equallybalanced on both sides there is no torment greater, since the lover is always infear that his love may not gain its desire and that he is wasting his efforts.He fears, too, that rumors of it may get abroad, and he fears everything thatmight harm it in any way, for before things are perfected a slight disturbanceoften spoils them. If he is a poor man, he also fears that the woman may scornhis poverty; if he is ugly, he fears that she may despise his lack of beauty ormay give her love to a more handsome man; if he is rich, he fears that hisparsimony in the past may stand in his way. To tell the truth, no one can numberthe fears of one single lover. This kind of love, then, is a suffering which isfelt by only one of the persons and may be called \"single love.\" But even afterboth are in love the fears that arise are just as great, for each of the loversfears that what he has acquired with so much effort may be lost through theeffort of someone else, which is certainly much worse for a man than if, havingno hope, he sees that his efforts are accomplishing nothing, for it is worse tolose the things you are seeking than to be deprived of a gain you merely hopefor. The lover fears, too, that he may offend his loved one in some way; indeedhe fears so many things that it would be difficult to tell them.That this suffering is inborn I shall show you clearly, because if you will lookat the truth and distinguish carefully you will see that it does not arise outof any action; only from the reflection of the mind upon what it sees does thissuffering come. For when a man sees some woman fit for love and shaped accordingto his taste, he begins at once to lust after her in his heart; then the more hethinks about her the more he burns with love, until he comes to a fullermeditation. Presently he begins to think about the fashioning of the woman andto differentiate her limbs, to think about what she does, and to pry into thesecrets of her body, and he desires to put each part of it to the fullest use.Then after he has come to this complete meditation, love cannot hold the reins,but he proceeds at once to action; straightway he strives to get a helper and tofind an intermediary. He begins to plan how he may find favor with her, and hebegins to seek a place and a time opportune for talking; he looks upon a briefhour as a very long year, because he cannot do anything fast enough to suit hiseager mind. It is well known that many things happen to him in this manner. Thisinborn suffering comes, therefore, from seeing and meditating. Not every kind ofmeditation can be the cause of love, an excessive one is required; for arestrained thought does not, as a rule, return to the mind, and so love cannotarise from it.Chapter III. Where Love Gets Its NameLove gets its name (amor) from the word for hook (amus), which means \"tocapture\" or \"to be captured,\" for he who is in love is captured in the chains ofdesire and wishes to capture someone else with his hook. Just as a skillfulfisherman tries to attract fishes by his bait and to capture them on his crookedhook, so the man who is a captive of love tries to attract another person by hisallurements and exerts all his efforts to unite two different hearts with anintangible bond, or if they are already united he tries to keep them so forever.Chapter IV. What the Effect of Love IsNow it is the effect of love that a true lover cannot be degraded with anyavarice. Love causes a rough and uncouth man to be distinguished for hishandsomeness; it can endow a man even of the humblest birth with nobility ofcharacter; it blesses the proud with humility; and the man in love becomesaccustomed to performing many services gracefully for everyone. O what awonderful thing is love, which makes a man shine with so many virtues andteaches everyone, no matter who he is, so many good traits of character! Thereis another thing about love that we should not praise in few words: it adorns aman, so to speak, with the virtue of chastity, because he who shines with thelight of one love can hardly think of embracing another woman, even a beautifulone. For when he thinks deeply of his beloved the sight of any other woman seemsto his mind rough and rude.I wish you therefore to keep always in mind, Walter my friend, that if love wereso fair as always to bring his sailors into the quiet port after they had beensoaked by many tempests, I would bind myself to serve him forever. But becausehe is in the habit of carrying an unjust weight in his hand, I do not have fullconfidence in him any more than I do in a judge whom men suspect. And so for thepresent I refuse to submit to his judgment, because \"he often leaves his sailorsin the mighty waves.\" But why love, at times, does not use fair weights I shallshow you more fully elsewhere in this treatise.Chapter VII. Various Decisions in Love CasesNow then, let us come to various decisions in cases of love:I. A man who was greatly enamoured of a certain woman devoted his whole heart tothe love of her. But when she saw that he was in love with her, she absolutelyforbade him to love. When she discovered that he was just as much in love withher as ever, she said to him one day, \"I know it is true that you have striven avery long time for my love, but you can never get it unless you are willing tomake me a firm promise that you will always obey all my commands and that if youoppose them in any way you will be willing to lose my love completely.\" The mananswered her, \"My lady, God forbid that I should ever be so much in error as tooppose your commands in anything; so since what you ask is very pleasing, Igladly assent to it.\" After he had promised this she immediately ordered him tomake no more effort to gain her love and not to dare to speak a good word of herto others. This was a heavy blow to the lover, yet he bore it patiently. But oneday when this lover and some other knights were with some ladies he heard hiscompanions speaking very shamefully about his lady and saying things about herreputation that were neither right nor proper. He endured it for a while with anill grace, but when he saw that they kept on disparaging the lady he burst outviolently against them and began to accuse them of slander and to defend hislady's reputation. When all this came to her ears she said that he ought to loseher love completely because by praising her he had violated her commands.This point the Countess of Champagne explained as follows in her decision. Shesaid that the lady was too severe in her command, because she was not ashamed tosilence him by an unfair sentence after he had wholly submitted himself to herwill and after she had given him the hope of her loveby binding him to her with a promise which no honorable woman can break withouta reason. Nor did the aforesaid lover sin at all when he tried to deliver awell-deserved rebuke to those who were slandering his lady. For although he didmake such a promise in order the more easily to obtain her love, it seems unfairof the woman to lay upon him the command that he should trouble himself no morewith love for her. II. Again. Another man, although he was enjoying the embracesof a most excellent love, asked her for permission to obtain the embraces of adifferent woman. Having received this he went away and refrained longer thanusual from the solaces of the first lady. But after a month had elapsed he cameback to the first one and said that he had never received any solaces from theother lady, nor had he wished to receive them, but he had merely wanted to testthe constancy of his loved one. This woman refused him her love on the groundthat he was unworthy, saying that for him to ask and receive such permission wasreason enough for her to deprive him of her love. But the opinion of QueenEleanor, who was consulted on the matter, seems to be just the opposite of thiswoman's. She said, \"We know that it comes from the nature of love that those whoare in love often falsely pretend that they desire new embraces, that they maythe better test the faith and constancy of their co-lover. Therefore a womansins against the nature of love itself if she keeps back her embraces from herlover on this account or forbids him her love, unless she has clear evidencethat he has been unfaithful to her.\"III. There were two men who were equal in birth and life and morals andeverything else except that one happened to have more property than the other,so that many wondered which was preferable as a lover. From this case came thedictum of the Countess of Champagne, who said, \"It would not be right for one toprefer a vulgar rich man to a noble and handsome poor one. Indeed a handsomepoor man may well be preferred to a rich nobleman if both are seeking the loveof a rich woman, since it is more worthy for a woman who is blessed with anabundance of property to accept a needy lover than one who has great wealth.Nothing should be more grievous to all good men than to see worth overshadowedby poverty or suffering from the lack of anything. It is right, therefore, formen to praise a wealthy woman who disregards money and seeks a needy lover whomshe can help with her wealth, for nothing seems so praiseworthy in a lover ofeither sex as to relieve the necessities of the loved one so far as may be. Butif the woman herself is in need, she is more ready to accept the rich lover; forif both lovers are oppressed by poverty there is little doubt that their lovewill be of short duration. Poverty brings a great feeling of shame to allhonourable men and gives them many an anxious thought and is even a greatdisturber of quiet sleep; so as a result it commonly puts love to flight.IX. A certain man asked the same lady to make clear where there was the greateraffection—between lovers or between married people. The lady gave him a logicalanswer. She said: \"We consider that marital affection and the true love oflovers are wholly different and arise from entirely different sources, and sothe ambiguous nature of the word prevents the comparison of the things and wehave to place them in different classes. Comparisons ofmore or less are not valid when things are grouped together under an ambiguousheading and the comparison is made in regard to that ambiguous term. It is notrue comparison to say that a name is simpler than a body or that the outline ofa speech is better arranged than the delivery. X. The same man asked the samelady this question. A certain woman had been married, but was now separated fromher husband by a divorce, and her former husband sought eagerly for her love. Inthis case the lady replied: \"If any two people have been married and afterwardsseparate in any way, we consider love between them wholly wicked.\" XVII. Again.A certain knight was in love with a woman who had given her love to another man,but he got from her this much hope of her love—that if it should ever happenthat she lost the love of her beloved, then without a doubt her love would go tothis man. A little while after this the woman married her lover. The otherknight then demanded that she give him the fruit of the hope she had grantedhim, but this she absolutely refused to do, saying that she had not lost thelove of her lover. In this affair the Queen gave her decision as follows: \"Wedare not oppose the opinion of the Countess of Champagne, who ruled that lovecan exert no power between husband and wife. Therefore we recommend that thelady should grant the love she has promised.\" XVIII. A certain knight shamefullydivulged the intimacies and the secrets of his love. All those who were servingin the camp of Love demanded that this offense should be most severely punished,lest if so serious a transgression went unavenged, the example might giveoccasion to others to do likewise. A court of ladies was therefore assembled inGascony, and they decided unanimously that forever after he should be deprivedof all hope of love and that in every court of ladies or of knights he should bean object of contempt and abuse to all. And if any woman should dare to violatethis rule of the ladies, for example by giving him her love, she should besubject to the same punishment, and should henceforth be an enemy of all honestwomen.Chapter VIII. The Rules of LoveLet us come now to the rules of love, and I shall try to present to you verybriefly those rules which the King of Love is said to have proclaimed with hisown mouth and to have given in writing to all lovers. These are the rules.I. Marriage is no real excuse for not loving.II. He who is not jealous cannot love.III. No one can be bound by a double love.IV. It is well known that love is always increasing or decreasing.V. That which a lover takes against the will of his beloved has no relish. VI.Boys do not love until they arrive at the age of maturity. VII. When one loverdies, a widowhood of two years is required of thesurvivor. VIII. No one should be deprived of love without the very best ofreasons.IX. No one can love unless he is impelled by the persuasion of love. X. Love isalways a stranger in the home of avarice. XI. It is not proper to love any womanwhom one would be ashamed toseek to marry. XII. A true lover does not desire to embrace in love anyoneexcept his beloved.XIII. When made public love rarely endures.XIV. The easy attainment of love makes it of little value; difficultv ofattainment makes it prized.XV. Every lover regularly turns pale in the presence of his beloved. XVI. When alover suddenly catches sight of his beloved his heart palpitates. XVII. A newlove puts to flight an old one. XVIII. Good character alone makes any man worthyof love. XIX. If love diminishes, it quickly fails and rarely revives. XX. A manin love is always apprehensive. XXI. Real jealousy always increases the feelingof love. XXII. Jealousy, and therefore love, are increased when one suspects hisbeloved. XXIII. He whom the thought of love vexes eats and sleeps very little.XXIV Every act of a lover ends in the thought of his beloved. XXV. A true loverconsiders nothing good except what he thinks will please his beloved. XXVI. Lovecan deny nothing to love.XXVII. A lover can never have enough of the solaces of his beloved. XXVIII. Aslight presumption causes a lover to suspect his beloved. XXIX. A man who isvexed by too much passion usually does not love. XXX. A true lover is constantlyand without intermission possessed by thethought of his beloved. XXXI. Nothing forbids one woman being loved by two menor one man by two women.AUnit XIIIIn Search of the Holy Grail: The Parzival LegendParzivalWOLFRAM VON ESCHENBACHWolfram von Eschenbach, a German knight of the late twelfth century, wrote thegreat medieval romance Parzival. These selections include the love of Gahmuretand*Behcane, ParzivaTs first visit to the Grail Castle, the teachingsofTevrizent, the fight between Parzival and Feirefiz, the Healing of Amfortasand the reunion of Parzival and Condwiramurs.CHAPTER IIf vacillation dwell with the heart the soul will rue it. Shame and honour clashwhere the courage of a steadfast man is motley like the magpie. But such a manmay yet make merry, for Heaven and Hell have equal part in him. Infidelity'sfriend is black all over and takes on a murky hue, while the man of loyal temperholds to the white.This winged comparison is too swift for unripe wits. They lack the power tograsp it. For it will wrench past them like a startled hare! So it is with adull mirror or a blind man's dream. These reveal faces in dim outline: but thedark image does not abide, it gives but a moment's joy. Who tweaks my palm wherenever a hair did grow? He would have learnt close grips indeed! Were I to cry\"Oh!\" in fear of that it would mark me as a fool. Shall I find loyalty where itmust vanish, like fire in a well or dew in the sun?On the other hand I have yet to meet a man so wise that he would not gladly knowwhat guidance this story requires, what edification it brings. The tale neverloses heart, but flees and pursues, turns tail and wheels to the attack anddoles out blame and praise. The man who follows all these vicissitudes andneither sits too long nor goes astray and otherwise knows where he stands hasbeen well served by mother wit.Feigned friendship leads to the fire, it destroys a man's nobility like hail.Its loyalty is so short in the tail that if it meet in the wood with gadflies itwill not quit a bite in three.These manifold distinctions do not all relate to men. I shall set these marks asa challenge to women. Let any who would learn from me beware to whom she takesher honour and good name, beware whom she makes free of her love and preciousperson, lest she regret the loss of both chastity and affection. With God as mywitness I bid good women observe restraint. The lock guarding all good ways ismodesty—I need not wish them any better fortune. The false will gain a name forfalsity. —How lasting is thin ice in August's torrid sun? Their credit will passas soon away. The beauty of many has been praised far and wide; but if theirhearts be counterfeit I rate them as I should a bead set in gold. But I do notreckon it a tawdry thing when the noble ruby with all its virtues is fashionedinto base brass, for this 1 would liken to the spirit of true womanhood. When awomanacts to the best of her nature you will not find me surveying her complexion orprobing what shields her heart: if she be well proofed within her breast hergood name is safe from harm.CHAPTER 5Whoever cares to hear where the knight is arriving whom Dame Adventure sent onhis travels, can now take note of marvels unparalleled. Let the son of Gahmuretride on. True-hearted people everywhere will wish him luck, since he is destinednow to suffer great anguish, but at times also honour and joy. One thing wasdistressing him—that he was far from the woman than whom none was ever said bybook or tale to have been more virtuous or fairer. Thoughts of the Queen beganto unsettle his wits, and had he not been a stout-hearted man he must have lostthem quite. His charger trailed his reins impetuously through bog and overfallen trees, for no man's hand was guiding it. The tale informs us that a birdwould have been hard put to it to fly the distance he rode that day. Unless mysource has deceived me, the journey he made on the day when he killed Ither withhis javelin, and later when he reached the land of Brobarz from Graharz, wasshorter by far.Would you now like to hear how he is faring?In the evening he came to a lake. Some sportsmen whose lake it was had anchoredthere. When they saw him ride up they were near enough to the shore to hearanything he said. One of those he saw in the boat was wearing clothes of suchquality that had he been lord of the whole earth they could not have been finer.His hat was of peacock's feathers and lined inside. Parzival asked the Angler inGod's name and of his courtesy to tell him where he could seek shelter for thenight, and thus did that man of sorrows answer: \"Sir,\" he said, \"I know of nohabitation beside the lake or inland for thirty miles. Nearby stands a lonemansion. I urge you to go there. What other place could you reach beforenightfall? After passing the rock-face, turn right. When you come up to themoat, where I suspect you will have to halt, ask them to lower the drawbridgeand open up the road to you.\"He accepted the Angler's advice and took his leave. \"If you do find the rightway there,\" added the Angler, \"I shall take care of you myself this evening:then suit your thanks to the entertainment you will have received. Takecare—some tracks lead to unknown country, you could miss your path on themountainside, and I would not wish that to happen to you.\"Parzival set off and moved into a brisk trot along the right path as far as themoat. There he found the drawbridge raised. Nothing had been spared to make animpregnable stronghold: it stood smooth and rounded as though from a lathe.Unless attackers were to come on wings or be blown there by the wind, no assaultcould harm it. Clusters of towers and numerous palaces stood there marvellouslyembattled. Had all the armies in the world assailed it, the hurt they would haveinflicted would not have ruffled the defenders once in thirty years.454 Wolfram von EschenbachA page attended to asking him w hat he wanted and where he had journeyed from.\"The Angler sent me here, he answered. \"I thanked him in the hope of findingbare shelter for the night. He asked for the drawbridge to be lowered and toldme to ride in to you.\"\"Seeing that it was the Angler who said so, you are wlecome. sir! said the page.\"You shall be honoured and have comfortable quarters for the sake of the man whosent you here. And he let down the drawbridge.The bold knight rode into the fortress and on to a spacious courtyard. Its greenlawn had not been trampled down in chivalric sport, for there was no vying atthe bohort there, jousters never rode over it with pennants flying as they doover the meadow at Abenberg. Zestful deeds had not been done there for many aday, for they had come to know heartfelt grief.Parzival was not made to feel this in any way. He was welcomed by knights youngand old. A crowd of very young gentlemen ran forward to take his bridle, eachtrying to seize it first. They held his stirrup, so down he had to come from hishorse. Knights invited him to step forward and they then conducted him to hisroom. They unarmed him swiftly but decorously, and when they set eyes on thebeardless young man and saw how charming he was. they declared him rich inFortunes favours.The young man asked for water and had soon washed the rusty grime from hands andface, with the result that it seemed to them as though another day were dawningfrom him. with such refulgence did he sit there, the perfect image of a handsomeyoung consort.They brought him a cloak of cloth-of-gold of Araby. which the good-lookingfellow put on—not lacing it to—which earned him many compliments.\"My lady the Princess Repanse de Schoye was wearing it. said the discreet Masterof the Wardrobe. \"It is lent to you from oft her person, for as yet no clotheshave been cut for you. I could decently ask it of her since, if I judge youcorrectly, you are a man of worth.\"\"May God reward you, sir. for saying so. If you have judged me rightly I amindeed fortunate. The power of God bestows such reward.\"They filled his cup and entertained him in such a way that despite their griefthey shared his pleasure. They treated him with honour and esteem. And indeedthere was greater store of meat and drink there than he found at Belrepeirebefore delivering it from its plight.They took his equipment away, a thing he was soon to regret when a prank tookhim unawares. For a man deft in speech summoned our mettlesome guest to court tojoin his host overfreely. with a show of anger, and for this almost lost hislife at the hands of young Parzival. Not finding his splendid sword there.Parzival clenched his fist so hard that the blood shot through his nails andsplashed his sleeve.\"Hold, sir!\" cried the knights. \"This man is licensed to jest, however dismal wemay be. Bear with him. as a gentleman.—You were merely meant to understand thatthe Angler is here. Go and join him—he esteems you a noble guest— and shakeoffvour load rfanger.\"They mounted the stairs to a hall where a hundred chandeliers were hanging withmany candles set upon them high over the heads of the company, and withcandle-dips round its walls. On the floor he saw a hundred couches with as manyquilts laid over them, furnished by those who had that duty, each seating fourcompanions and with spaces in between and a round carpet before it. KingFrimutel's son could well afford it. One thing was not omitted there: they hadnot thought it too extravagant to have three square andirons in marble masonryon which was the element of fire burning wood of aloes. Here at Wildenberg noneever saw such great fires at any time. Those were magnificent pieces ofworkmanship!The lord of the castle had himself seated on a sling-bed over against the middleof the fireplace. He and happiness had settled accounts with each other, he wasmore dead than alive. Parzival with his radiant looks now entered the hall andwas well received by him who had sent him there—his host did not keep himstanding but bade him approach and be seated \"... close beside me. Were I toseat you a way off it would be treating you too much as a stranger!\" Such werethis sorrowful lord s words.Because of his ailment his lordship maintained great fires and wore warm clothesof ample cut, with sable both outside and in the lining both of his pellice andthe cloak above it. Its meanest fur would have been highly prized, being of theblack-with-grey variety. On his head he wore a covering of that same fur, sablebought at great price, doubled upon itself. Around its top it had an Arabianorphrey, and at the centre a button of translucent ruby.A great company of grave knights were sitting where they were presented with asad spectacle. A page ran in at the door, bearing—this rite was to evoke grief—aLance from whose keen steel blood issued and then ran down the shaft to his handand all but reached his sleeve.At this there was weeping and wailing throughout that spacious hall, theinhabitants of thirty lands could not have wrung such a flood from their eyes.The page carried the Lance round the four walls back to the door and then ranout again, whereupon the pain was assuaged that had been prompted by the sorrowthose people had been reminded of.If it will not weary you I will set about taking you to where service wasrendered with all due ceremony.At the far end of the Palace a steel door was thrown open. Through it came apair of noble maidens such—now let me run over their appearances for you— thatto any who had deserved it of them they would have made Love's payment in full,such dazzling young ladies were they. For head-dress each wore a garland offlowers over her hair and no other covering, and each bore a golden candelabra.Their long flaxen hair fell in locks, and the lights they were carrying weredazzling-bright. But let us not pass over the gowns those young ladies madetheir entry in! The gown of the Countess of Tenabroc was of fine brown scarlet,as was that of her companion, and they were gathered together above the hips andfirmly clasped by girdles round their waists.Then there came a duchess and her companion, carrying two trestles of ivory.Their kips glowed red as fire. All four inclined their heads, and thenthe two set up their trestles before their lord. They stood there together in agroup, one as lovely as the other, and gave him unstinting service. All fourwere dressed alike.But see, four more pairs of ladies have not missed their cue! Their function wasthat four were to carry large candles whilst the other four were to applythemselves to bringing in a precious stone through which the sun could shine byday. Here is the name it was known by—it was a garnet-hyacinth! Very long andbroad it was, and the man who had measured it for a tabletop had cut it thin tomake it light. The lord of this castle dined at it as a mark of opulence. Withan inclination of their heads all eight maidens advanced in due order into theirlord's presence, then four placed the table on the trestles of snow-white ivorythat had preceded it, and decorously returned to stand beside the first four.These eight ladies were wearing robes of samite of Azagouc greener than grass,of ample cut for length and breadth, and held together at their middles by longnarrow girdles of price. Each of these modest young ladies wore a dainty garlandof flowers above her hair.The daughters of Counts Iwan of Nonel and Jernis of Ryl had been taken many amile to serve there, and now these two princely ladies were seen advancing inravishing gowns! They carried a pair of knives keen as fish-spines, on napkins,one apiece, most remarkable objects.—They were of hard white silver, ingeniouslyfashioned, and whetted to an edge that would have cut through steel! Nobleladies who had been summoned to serve there went before the silver, fourfaultless maidens, and bore a light for it. And so all six came on.Now hear what each of them does. They inclined their heads. Then two carried thesilver to the handsome table and set it down, and at once returned mostdecorously to the first twelve, so that if I have totted it up correctly weshould now have eighteen ladies standing there.Just look! You can now see another six advancing in sumptuous gowns, halfcloth-of-gold, half brocade of Niniveh. These and the former six alreadymentioned were wearing their twelve gowns cut parti-wise, of stuffs that hadcost a fortune.After these came the Princess. Her face shed such refulgence that all imaginedit was sunrise. This maiden was seen wearing brocade of Araby. Upon a greenachmardi she bore the consummation of heart's desire, its root and itsblossoming—a thing called \"The Gral,\" paradisal, transcending all earthlyperfection! She whom the Gral suffered to carry itself had the name of Repansede Schoye. Such was the nature of the Gral that she who had the care of it wasrequired to be of perfect chastity and to have renounced all things false.Lights moved in before the Gral—no mean lights they, but six fine slender vialsof purest glass in which balsam was burning brightly. When the young ladies whowere carrying the vials with balsam had come forward to the right distance, thePrincess courteously inclined her head and they theirs. The faithful Princessthen set the Gral before his lordship. (This tale declares that Par-zival gazedand pondered on that lady intently who had brought in the Gral, and well hemight, since it was her cloak that he was wearing.) Thereupon the seven went andrejoined the first eighteen with all decorum. They then openedtheir ranks to admit her who was noblest, making twelve on either side of her,as I am told. Standing there, the maiden with the crown made a most elegantpicture.Chamberlains with bowls of gold were appointed at the rate of one to every fourof the knights sitting there throughout the hall, with one handsome pagecarrying a white towel. What luxury was displayed there!A hundred tables were fetched in at the door, each of which was set up beforefour noble knights and carefully spread with white table-linen.The host—the man crippled in his pride—washed hands, as did Parzival too, whichdone, a count's son hastened to offer them a fine silk towel on bended knee.At every table there were pages with orders to wait assiduously on those whowere seated at them. While one pair knelt and carved, the other carried meat anddrink to table and saw to the diners' other needs.Let me tell you more of their high living. Four trolleys had been appointed tocarry numerous precious drinking-cups of gold, one for each knight sittingthere. They drew the trolleys along the four walls. Knights were seen by foursto stretch out their hands and stand the cups on their tables. Each trolley wasdogged by a clerk whose job it was to check the cups on to the trolley againafter supper. Yet there is more to come.A hundred pages were bidden to receive loaves into white napkins held with duerespect before the Gral. They came on all together, then fanned out on arrivingat the tables. Now I have been told and I am telling you on the oath of eachsingle one of you—so that if I am deceiving anyone you must all be lying withme—that whatever one stretched out one's hand for in the presence of the Gral,it was waiting, one found it all ready and to hand—dishes warm, dishes cold,new-fangled dishes and old favourites, the meat of beasts both tame and wild . ..\"There never was any such thing!'' many will be tempted to say. But they wouldbe misled by their ill temper, for the Gral was the very fruit of bliss, acornucopia of the sweets of this world and such that it scarcely fell short ofwhat they tell us of the Heavenly Kingdom.In tiny vessels of gold they received sauces, peppers, or pickles to suit eachdish. The frugal man and the glutton equally had their fill there served to themwith great ceremony.For whichever liquor a man held out his cup, whatever drink a man could name, beit mulberry wine, wine or ruby, by virtue of the Gral he could see it there inhis cup. The noble company partook of the Gral's hospitality.Parzival well observed the magnificence and wonder of it all, yet, true to thedictates of good breeding, he refrained from asking any question.\"Gurnemanz advised me with perfect sincerity against asking many questions,\" hethought. \"What if I stay here for as long as I stayed with him? I shall thenlearn unasked how matters stand with this household.\" While he was musing thus apage approached carrying a sword whose sheath was worth a thousand marks andwhose hilt was a ruby, whilst its blade could have been a source of marvels. Hislordship bestowed it on his guest.\"Sir,\" he said, \"I took this into the thick of battle on many a field before Godcrippled my body. Let it make amends for any lack of hospitality you havesuffered here. You will wear it to good effect always. Whenever you put it tothe test in battle it will stand you in good stead.\"Alas that he asked no Question then! Even now I am cast down on his account! Forwhen he was given the sword it was to prompt him to ask a Question! I mourn toofor his gentle host, who is dogged by misfortune from on high of which he couldbe rid by a Question.Enough had been dispensed there. Those whose function it was, set to work andremoved the tables after the four trolleys had received their loads again. Andnow in reverse order of entry, each lady performs her service. They againassigned their noblest, the Princess, to the Gral, and she and all the youngladies bowed gracefully to both their lord and Parzival, and so carried backthrough the door what they had brought in with such ceremony.Parzival glanced after them. On a sling-bed in a chamber, before the doors hadbeen shut behind them, Parzival glimpsed the most handsome old man he had everseen or heard of, whose hair I can assert without exaggeration was more silveryeven than hoar-frost.As to who that old man was, you shall learn the story later. And I shall alsotell you the names of the lord, his castle and lands hereafter, when the timehas come to do so, in all detail, authoritatively, and without playing on yourcuriosity.CHAPTER 9\"Open!\"\"To whom? Who is there?\"\"I wish to enter your heart.\"\"Then you want too narrow a space.\"\"How is that? Can't I just squeeze in? I promise not to jostle you. I want totell you marvels.\"\"Can it be you, Lady Adventure? How do matters stand with that fine fellow?—Imean with noble Parzival, whom with harsh words Cundrie drove out to seek theGral, a quest from which there was no deterring him, despite the weeping of manyladies. He left Arthur the Briton then: but how is he faring now? Take up thetale and tell us whether he has renounced all thought of happiness or hascovered himself with glory, whether his fame has spread far and wide or hasshrivelled and shrunk. Recount his achievements in detail. Has he seenMunsalvaesche again and gentle Anfortas, whose heart was so fraught with sighs?Please tell us—how it would console us!—whether he has been released fromsuffering? Let us hear whether Parzival has been there, he who is your lord asmuch as mine. Enlighten me as to the life he has been leading. How has sweetHerzeloyde's child, Gahmuret's son, been faring? Tell us whether he has won joyor bitter sorrow in his battles. Does he hold to the pursuit of distant goals?Or has he been lolling in sloth and idleness? Tell me his whole style ofliving.\"Now the adventure tells us that Parzival has ranged through many lands onhorseback and over the waves in ships. None who measured his charge againsthim kept his seat, unless he were compatriot or kinsman—in such fashion does hedown the scales for his opponents and, whilst making others fall, raise his ownrenown! He has defended himself from discomfiture in many fierce wars and so farspent himself in battle that any man who wished to lease fame from him had to doso in fear and trembling.Herzeloyde's child rides on. His manly discipline enjoined modesty andcompassion in him. Since young Herzeloyde had left him a loyal heart, remorsenow began to stir in it. Only now did he ponder Who had brought the world intobeing, only now think of his Creator and how mighty He must be. \"What if God hassuch power to succour as would overcome my sorrow?\" he asked himself. \"If Heever favoured a knight and if any knight ever earned His reward or if shield andsword and true manly ardour can ever be so worthy of His help that this couldsave me from my cares and if this is His Helpful Day, then let Him help, if helpHe can!\"He turned back in the direction whence he had ridden. They were still standingthere, saddened by his departure, for they were loyal-hearted people. The youngladies followed him with their eyes, while he in turn confessed in his heartthat they pleased his eyes—for their bright looks declared them beautiful.\"If God's power is so great that it can guide horses and other beasts andpeople, too, then I will praise His power. If the wisdom of God disposes of thathelp, let it guide my castilian to the best success of my journey—then in Hisgoodness He will show power to help! Now go where God chooses!\" He laid thereins over his horse's ears and urged him on hard with his spurs.The beast made for Fontane la Salvassche, where Orilus had received the oath.This was the abode of the austere Trevrizent, who ate miserably many a Mondayand no better all through the week. He had forsworn wine, mulberry and bread.His austerity imposed further abstinence: he had no mind for such food as fishor meat or anything with blood. Such was the holy life he led. God had inspiredthis gentleman to prepare to join the heavenly host: He endured much hardshipfrom fasting. Self-denial was his arm against the Devil.From Trevrizent, Parzival is about to learn matters concerning the Gral thathave been hidden. Those who questioned me earlier and wrangled with me for nottelling them earned nothing but shame. Kyot asked me to conceal it because hissource forbade him to mention it till the story itself reached that pointexpressly where it has to be spoken of.Despite the snow on the ground Parzival recognized a spot where once upon a timedazzling flowers had stood. It was at the foot of an escarpment where, with hismanly right hand, he had made Orilus relent towards Lady Jeschute, and Orilus'sanger had evaporated. But the tracks did not let him stop there: Fontane laSalvaesche was the locality towards which his journey tended. Parzival found itslord at home, and he received him.\"Alas, sir,\" said the hermit, \"that you should be in this condition atHoly-tide. Was it some desperate encounter that forced you into this armour? Orhad you no fighting to do?—In which case other garb would have been seemlier ifyour pride permitted it. Pray dismount, sir—I fancy you will have noobjection—and warm yourself beside the fire. If thirst for adventure has broughtyou out with an eye to winning Love s reward and it is True Love you favour,then love as Love is now in season, and in keeping with the Love of this Day!After that, serve women for their favour. But please do dismount, if I mayinvite you.\"The warrior Parzival alighted at once and stood before him with great courtesy.He told him of the people who had pointed out the way and how they had praisedhis guidance.\"Sir,\" he said, \"guide me now: I am a sinner.\"In answer to these words the good man said: \"I shall give you guidance. Now tellme who directed you here to me.\"\"Walking towards me in the forest, sir, there came a grey-haired man. He salutedme kindly, as did his retinue. That same honest person sent me here to you, andI rode along his tracks till I found you.\"\"That was Gabenis,\" said his host. \"He is versed to perfection in noble ways.The Prince is a Punturteis, the mighty King of Kareis married his sister. Nofruit of human body was ever purer than his daughters who came walking towardsyou in the forest! The Prince is of royal line. He visits me here each year.\"\"When I saw you standing in my path, were you at all afraid as I rode up toyou?\" Parzival asked his host. \"Did my coming irk you?\"\"Believe me, sir,\" replied the hermit, \"bears and stags have startled me moreoften than man. I can tell you truly: I fear nothing of human kind, since I,too, possess human ability. If you will not think me boastful, I declare I neverfled the field; nor am I innocent of love. My heart never knew the villainy ofturning tail in battle. While I bore arms I was a knight like you and strove towin the love of noble ladies. From time to time I paired chaste with sinfulthoughts. I lived in dazzling style to win a lady's favour. But I have forgottenthese things. Give me your bridle. Your horse shall rest at the foot of thatcliff. Then, soon, we shall go and gather some young fir-tips and bracken forhim—I have no other fodder. Nevertheless we shall keep him in good fettle.\"Parzival made as though to prevent him from taking the bridle.\"Your good manners do not permit you to struggle with your host short oflowering themselves,\" said the good man. And so Parzival yielded the bridle tohis host, who then led the horse beneath the overhanging rock where the rays ofthe sun never came—a wild stable indeed! A waterfall gushed down through it. Aweak man would have been hard put to it, wearing armour where the bitter coldcould strike him in this fashion. His host led Parzival into a grotto, wellprotected from the wind and with a fire of glowing charcoal which the strangercould well put up with! The master of the house lit a candle, and the warriorremoved his armour and reclined on a bed of straw and ferns, while all his limbsgrew warm and his skin shone clear. No wonder he was weary from the forest,since he had ridden along few roads and passed the night with no roof over hishead till day-break, and many another, too. But now he had found a kind host.There was a coat lying there. The hermit lent it him to put on and then took himto another grotto, where the austere man kept the books he read. An altar-stoodthere bare of its cloth, in keeping with the Good Friday rite. On it a reliquarycould be seen which was instantly recognized—Parzival had laid his hand on it toswear an unsullied oath on the occasion when Lady Jeschute's suffering waschanged to joy, and her happiness took an upward turn.\"I know this casket, sir,\" said Parzival to his host, \"for I once swore an oathon it when passing by. I found a painted lance beside it. Sir, I took that lanceand was told later that I advanced my reputation with it. I was so absorbed inthoughts of my wife that I lost my self-awareness. I rode two mighty jousts withit—I fought them both in utter obliviousness! Honour had not yet deserted me.But now I have more cares than were seen in any man. Kindly tell me how long isit since the time I took the lance from here?\"\"My friend Taurian left it behind,\" replied the good man. \"He told me he missedit, later. It is now four-and-a-half years and three days since you took it. Ifyou care to listen I will reckon it out for you.\" And from his psalter he readhim the full count of the years and weeks that had elapsed in the meantime.\"Only now,\" said Parzival, \"do I realize how long I have been wandering with nosense of direction and unsustained by any happy feelings. Happiness for me isbut a dream: I bear a heavy pack of grief. And I will tell you more. All thistime I was never seen to enter any church or minster where God's praise wassung. All I sought was battle. I am deeply resentful of God, since He standsgodfather to my troubles: He has lifted them up too high, while my happiness isburied alive. If only God's power would succour me, what an anchor my happinesswould be, which now sinks into sorrow's silt! If my manly heart is wounded—canit be whole when Sorrow sets her thorny crown on glory won by deeds of arms fromformidable foes?—then I set it down to the shame of Him who has all succour inHis power, since if He is truly prompt to help He does not help me—for all thehelp they tell of Him!\"His host sighed and looked at him. \"Sir,\" he said, \"if you have any sense youwill trust in God. He will help you, since help He must. May God help both ofus! You must give me a full account, sir—but do sit down first! Tell me soberlyhow your anger began so that God became the object of your hatred. Yet kindlybear with me while I tell you He is innocent, before you accuse Him in myhearing. His help is always forthcoming.\"Although I was a layman I could read and indite the message of the Scriptures:that to gain His abundant help mankind should persevere in God's service, Whonever wearied of giving His steadfast aid against the soul's being plunged intoHell. Be unswervingly constant towards Him, since God Himself is perfectconstancy, condemning all falsity. We should allow Him to reap the benefit ofhaving done so much for us, for His sublime nature took on human shape for oursakes. God is named and is Truth, He was Falsity's foe from the Beginning. Youshould ponder this deeply. It is not in Him to play false. Now school yourthoughts and guard against playing Him false.\"You can gain nothing from Him by anger. Anyone who sees you hating Him wouldthink you weak of understanding. Consider what Lucifer and his comradesachieved! As angels they had no gall: so where in God's name did they find themalice that makes them wage ceaseless war, whose reward in Hell is so bitter?Astiroth and Belcimon, Belet and Radamant and others I could name— this brightheavenly company took on a hellish hue as the result of their malice and envy.\"When Lucifer made the descent to Hell with his following, a Man succeeded him.For God made noble Adam from earth. From Adam's body He thenbroke Eve, who consigned us to tribulation by not listening to her Maker andthus shattered our bliss. Through birth these two had progeny. One son wasdriven by his discontent and by vainglorious greed to deflower his grandmother.Now it might please many to ask, before they understood this account, how thisis possible? It nevertheless came to pass, and sinfully.\"\"I doubt that it ever happened,\" interposed Parzival. \"From whom was the mandescended by whom, according to you, his grandmother lost her maidenhead? Youought never to have said such a thing.\"\"I will remove your doubts,\" his host replied. \"If I do not tell the unvarnishedtruth you must object to my deceiving you! The earth was Adam's mother, by herfruits Adam was nourished. The earth was still a virgin then. It remains for meto tell you who took her maidenhead. Adam was father to Cain, who slew Abel fora trifle. When blood fell upon the pure earth her virginity was gone, taken byAdam's son. This was the beginning of hatred among men, and thus it has enduredever since.\"There is nothing in the whole world so pure as an honest maiden. Consider thepurity of maidens: God Himself was the Virgin's child. Two men were born ofvirgins: God Himself took on a countenance like that of the first virgin's son,a condescension from His sublimity. With Adam's race there began both sorrow andjoy, for he whom all angels see above them does not deny our consanguinity, andhis lineage is a vehicle of sin; so that we, too, have to bear our load of it.May the power of Him Who is compassionate show mercy here! Since His faithfulHumanity fought faithfully against unfaithfulness you should put your quarrelwith Him by. Unless you wish to forfeit your heavenly bliss admit penance foryour sins. Do not be so free of word or deed—let me tell you the reward of onewho slakes his anger in loose speech. He is damned by his own mouth! Take oldsayings for new, if they teach you constancy. In ancient times the vates Platoand Sibyl the Prophetess truly foretold beyond all error that a surety wouldcome to us for greatest debts. In His divine love He that is highest of allreleased us in Hell and left the wicked inside.\"These glad tidings tell of the True Lover. He is a light that shines throughall things, unwavering in His love. Those to whom He shows His love findcontentment in it. His wares are of two sorts: He offers the world love andanger. Now ask yourself which helps more. The unrepentant sinner flees God'slove: but he that atones for his sins serves Him for His noble favour.\"He that passes through men's thoughts bears such Grace. Thoughts keep out therays of the sun, thoughts are shut away without a lock, are secure from allcreatures. Thoughts are darkness unlit by any beam. But of its nature, theGodhead is translucent, it shines through the wall of darkness and rides with anunseen leap unaccompanied by thud or jingle. And when a thought springs fromone's heart, none is so swift but that it is scanned ere it pass the skin—andonly if it be pure does God accept it. Since God scans thoughts so well, alas,how our frail deeds must pain him!\"When a man forfeits God's benevolence so that God turns away in shame, to whosecare can human schooling leave him? Where shall the poor soul find refuge? Ifyou are going to wrong God, Who is ready with both Love and Wrath,you are the one who will suffer. Now so direct your thoughts that He willrequite your goodness.''\"Sir, I shall always be glad that you have taught me about Him Who leavesnothing unrewarded, whether virtue or misdeed,\" said Parzival. \"I have spent myyouth in care and anxiety until this day and endured sorrow for the sake ofloyalty.\"\"Unless you do not wish to divulge them, I should like to hear your sins andsorrows,\" replied his host. \"If you will let me judge of them I might well beable to give advice you could not give yourself.\"\"My deepest distress is for the Gral,\" replied Parzival. \"After that it is formy wife, than whom no fairer creature was ever given suck by mother. I languishand pine for them both.\"\"You are right, sir,\" said his host. \"The distress you suffer is as it shouldbe, since the anguish you give yourself comes from longing for the wife that isyours. If you are found in holy wedlock, however you may suffer in Purgatory,your torment shall soon end, and you will be loosed from your bonds immediatelythrough God's help. You say you long for the Gral? You foolish man—this I mustdeplore! For no man can win the Gral other than one who is acknowledged inHeaven as destined for it. This much I have to say about the Gral, for I know itand have seen it with my own eyes.\"\"Were you there?\" asked Parzival.\"Indeed, sir,\" was his host's reply.Parzival did not reveal to him that he, too, had been there, but asked to betold about the Gral.\"It is well known to me,\" said his host, \"that many formidable fighting-mendwell at Munsalvaesche with the Gral. They are continually riding out on sortiesin quest of adventure. Whether these same Templars reap trouble or renown, theybear it for their sins. A warlike company lives there. I will tell you how theyare nourished. They live from a Stone whose essence is most pure. If you havenever heard of it I shall name it for you here. It is called 'Lapsit exillis'.By virtue of this Stone the Phoenix is burned to ashes, in which he isreborn.—Thus does the Phoenix moult its feathers! Which done, it shines dazzlingbright and lovely as before! Further: however ill a mortal may be, from the dayon which he sees the Stone he cannot die for that week, nor does he lose hiscolour. For if anyone, maid or man, were to look at the Gral for two hundredyears, you would have to admit that his colour was as fresh as in his earlyprime, except that his hair would grey!—Such powers does the Stone confer onmortal men that their flesh and bones are soon made young again. This Stone isalso called 'The Gral.'\"Today a Message alights upon the Gral governing its highest virtue, for todayis Good Friday, when one can infallibly see a Dove wing its way down fromHeaven. It brings a small white Wafer to the Stone and leaves it there. TheDove, all dazzling white, then flies up to Heaven again. Every Good Friday, as Isay, the Dove brings it to the Stone, from which the Stone receives all that isgood on earth of food and drink, a paradisal excellence—I mean whatever theearth yields. The Stone, furthermore, has to give them the flesh of all the wildthings that live below the aether, whether they fly, run or swim—suchprebend does the Gral, thanks to its indwelling powers, bestow on the chivalricBrotherhood.\"As to those who are appointed to the Gral, hear how they are made known. Underthe top edge of the Stone an Inscription announces the name and lineage of theone summoned to make the glad journey. Whether it concern girls or boys, thereis no need to erase their names, for as soon as a name has been read it vanishesfrom sight! Those who are now full-grown all came here as children. Happy themother of any child destined to serve there! Rich and poor alike rejoice if achild of theirs is summoned and they are bidden to send it to that Company! Suchchildren are fetched from many countries and forever after are immune from theshame of sin and have a rich reward in Heaven. When they die here in this world,Paradise is theirs in the next.\"When Lucifer and the Trinity began to war with each other, those who did nottake sides, worthy, noble angels, had to descend to earth to that Stone which isforever incorruptible. I do not know whether God forgave them or damned them inthe end: if it was His due He took them back. Since that time the Stone has beenin the care of those whom God appointed to it and to whom He sent his angel.This, sir, is how matters stand regarding the Gral.\"\"If knightly deeds with shield and lance can win fame for one's earthly self,yet also Paradise for one's soul, then the chivalric life has been my onedesire!,\" said Parzival. \"I fought wherever fighting was to be had, so that mywarlike hand has glory within its grasp. If God is any judge of fighting He willappoint me to that place so that the Company there know me as a knight who willnever shun battle.\"\"There of all places you would have to guard against arrogance by cultivatingmeekness of spirit,\" replied his austere host. \"You could be misled byyouth-fulness into breaches of self-control.—Pride goes before a fall!\" Thus hishost, whose eyes filled with tears as he recalled the story he was now to tellin full.\"Sir, there was a king who went by the name of Anfortas, as he does today,\" hesaid. \"The agony with which he was punished for his pride should move you andwretched me to never-ending pity! His youth and wealth and pursuit of lovebeyond the restraints of wedlock brought harm to the world through him. Suchways do not suit the Gral. In its service knights and squires must guard againstlicentiousness: humility has always mastered pride. A noble Brotherhood livesthere, who by force of arms have warded off men from every land, with the resultthat the Gral has been revealed only to those who have been summoned toMunsalvaesche to join tho Gral Company. Only one man ever came there withoutfirst having been assigned. He had not reached years of discretion! He went awaysaddled with sin in that he said no word to his host on the sad plight in whichhe saw him. It is not for me to blame anyone: but he will be bound to pay forhis sin of failing to inquire about his host's hurt. For Anfortas bore a load ofsuffering, the like of which had never been seen. Before this man's visit, KingLahelin had ridden to Brumbane. Here the noble knight Lybbeals of Prien-lascorshad waited to joust with him, and by joust had met his death. Lahelin led thewarrior's charger away, thus plainly despoiling the dead.\"Sir, are you Lahelin? In my stable there is a horse of the same coat as thosebelonging to the Gral Company. The horse comes from Munsalvaesche because itssaddle shows the Turtledove, the device which Anfortas gave for horses whenhappiness was still his, though their shields have always borne it. Titurelhanded it down to his son King Frimutel, who, brave knight, was displaying itwhen he lost his life in a joust. Frimutel loved his wife so dearly that no wifewas ever loved more by husband, I mean with such devotion. You should renew hisways and love your spouse with all your heart. Follow his example—you bear him aclose resemblance! He was also Lord of the Gral. Ah, sir, from where have youjourneyed? Kindly tell me from whom you are descended.\"Each looked the other in the eyes.\"I am the son of a man who, impelled by knightly ardour, lost his life in ajoust,\" Parzival told his host. \"I beg you to include him in your prayers, sir.My father's name was Gahmuret, and by birth he was an Angevin. Sir, I am notLahelin. If I ever stripped a corpse it was because I was dull of understanding.However, I did this thing, I confess myself guilty of the crime. I slew Ither ofCucumerlant with my sinful hand, I stretched him out dead on the grass and tookwhat there was to take.\"\"Alas, wicked World, why do you so?\" cried his host, saddened by this news. \"Yougive us more pain and bitter sorrow than ever joy! So this is the reward youoffer, such is the end of your song? Dear nephew,\" he went on, \"what counsel canI give you now? You have slain your own flesh and blood. If you take thismisdeed unatoned to the Judgment into the presence of God and He judges you withstrict justice, it will cost you your own life, since you and Ither were of oneblood. What payment will you make Him for Ither of Gaheviez? God had mademanifest in him the fruits of true nobility which enhanced life's quality. Allwrong-doing saddened him who was the very balm of constancy! All obloquy of thisworld fought shy of him, all that is noble made its way into his heart! Worthyladies ought to hate you for the loss of his lovable person. His service of themwas so entire that when they saw the charming man their eyes shone. May God havepity on it that you were ever the cause of such distress! Add to that, yourmother, my sister Herzeloyde, died of anguish for you!\"\"Oh no, good sir!\" cried Parzival. \"What are you saying now? Were that so and Iwere Lord of the Gral it could not console me for what you have just told me! IfI am your nephew, do as all sincere people do and tell me straight: are thesetwo things true?\"\"It is not in me to deceive,\" answered the good man. \"No sooner had you leftyour mother than she died—that was what she had for her love. You were the Beastshe suckled, the Dragon that flew away from her. It had come upon her as sheslept, sweet lady, before giving birth to you. I have a brother and a sisterliving. My sister Schoysiane bore a child and died bearing that fruit. Herhusband was Duke Kyot of Katelangen, who henceforth renounced all happiness. Hislittle daughter Sigune was entrusted to your mother's care. Schoysiane's deathafflicts me utterly—how could it fail to? Her womanly heart was so virtuous, itmight have been an ark afloat on the flood of wantonness! A sister ofmine is as yet unwed and keeps her chastity. She is Repanse de Schoye and hascharge of the Gral, which is so heavy that sinful mortals could not lift it fromits place. Her brother and mine is Anfortas, who was Lord of the Gral byheredity and so remains. Alas, happiness lies far beyond his reach, apart fromhis firm hope that his sufferings will earn him bliss eternal! Things came tothis sad pass in a way scarce short of marvellous, as I shall tell you, nephew.If you have a good heart you will be moved to pity by his sorrows.\"When my father Frimutel lost his life, his eldest son was summoned to the Gralas King and Lord Protector both of the Gral and its Company. This was my brotherAnfortas, who was worthy of the Crown and its dominion. At that time we werestill quite small. But when my brother approached the age at which the firstbristles begin to show, Love assailed him, as is her way with striplings—shepresses her friends so hard that one may call it dishonourable of her. But anyLord of the Gral who seeks love other than that allowed him by the Writing willinevitably have to pay for it with pain and suffering fraught with sighs.\"As the object of his attentions my lord and brother chose a lady whom he judgedof excellent conduct—as to who she was, let it rest. He served her withunflinching courage, and many shields were riddled by his fair hand. Asknight-errant the charming, comely youth won fame so exalted that he ran no riskof its being surpassed by any in all the lands of chivalry. His battle-cry was'Amor,' yet that shout is not quite right for humility.\"One day—his nearest and dearest did not at all approve—the King rode out aloneto seek adventure under Love's compulsion and joying in her encouragement.Jousting, he was wounded by a poisoned lance so seriously that he neverrecovered, your dear uncle—through the scrotum. The man who was fighting thereand rode that joust was a heathen born of Ethnise, where the Tigris flows outfrom Paradise. This pagan was convinced that his valour would earn him the Gral.His name was engraved on his lance. He sought chivalric encounters in distantcountries, crossing seas and lands with no other thought than to win the Gral.As a result of his prowess, our happiness vanished. Yet your uncle's prowessmust be commended too. He carried the lance-head away with him in his body, andwhen the noble youth returned to his familiars his tragic plight was clear tosee. He had slain that heathen on the field—let us not waste our tears on him.\"When the King returned to us so pale, and drained of all his strength, aphysician probed his wound till he found the lance-head and a length of bambooshaft which was also bured there. The physician recovered them both. I fell onmy knees in prayer and vowed to Almighty God that I would practise chivalry nomore, in the hope that to His own glory He would help my brother in his need. Ialso foreswore meat, bread and wine, and indeed promised that I would neveragain relish anything else that had blood. I tell you, dear nephew, parting withmy sword was another source of sorrow to my people. 'Who is to be Protector ofthe Gral's secrets?' they asked, while bright eyes wept.\"They lost no time in carrying the King into the presence of the Gral for anyaid God would give him. But when the King set eyes on it, it came as a secondaffliction to him that he might not die. Nor was it fitting he should after Ihaddedicated myself to a life of such wretchedness, and the dominion of our noblelineage had been reduced to such frailty.\"The King's wound had festered. None of the various books of medicine weconsulted furnished a remedy to reward our trouble. All that was known by way ofantidotes to asp, ecidemon, ehcontius, lisis, jecis and meatris—these viciousserpents carry their venom hot—and other poisonous snakes, all that the learneddoctors extract from herbs by the art of physic—let me be brief—were of noavail: it was God Himself who was frustrating us. We called in the aid of Gehon,Phison, Tigris and Euphrates, and so near to Paradise from which the four riversflow that their fragrance was still unspent, in the hope that some herb mightfloat down in it that would end our sorrow. But this was all lost effort, andour sufferings were renewed. Yet we made many other attempts. We obtained thatsame twig to which the Sibyl referred Aeneas, to ward off the hazards of Helland Phlegethon's fumes, not to name other rivers flowing there. We devoted timeto possessing ourselves of that twig as a remedy, in case the sinister lancethat slays our happiness had been envenomed or tempered in Hellflre: but it wasnot so with that lance.\"There is a bird called Pelican. When it has young it loves them to excess.Instinctive love impels it to pick through its own breast and let the blood flowinto its chicks' mouths. This done, it dies. We obtained some blood of this birdto see if its love would be efficacious, and anointed the wound to the best ofour ability: but it helped us not at all.\"There is a beast called Monicirus, which esteems virginal purity so highly thatit falls asleep in maiden's laps. We acquired this animal's heart to assuage theKing's pain. We took the carbuncle-stone on this beast's brow where it grows atthe base of its horn. We stroked the wound with it at the front, then completelyimmersed the stone in it: but the wound kept its gangrened look. This mortifiedthe King and us.\"We then took a herb called trachonte—it is said to grow from any dragon that isslain and to partake of the nature of air—in order to discover whether therevolution of the Dragon would avail against the planets' return and the changeof the moon, which caused the pain of the wound: but the sublime virtue of thisherb did not serve our purpose.\"We fell on our knees before the Gral, where suddenly we saw it written that aknight would come to us and were he heard to ask a Question there, our sorrowswould be at an end; but that if any child, maiden or man were to forewarn him ofthe Question it would fail in its effect, and the injury would be as it was andgive rise to deeper pain. 'Have you understood?' asked the Writing. 'If youalert him it could prove harmful. If he omits the Question on the first evening,its power will pass away. But if he asks his Question in season he shall havethe Kingdom, and by God's will the sorrow shall cease. Thereby Anfortas will behealed, but he shall be King no more.'\"In this way we read on the Gral that Anfortas's agony would end when theQuestion came to him. We anointed his wound with whatever might soothe it— thegood salve nard, whatever is decocted with theriac, and the smoke of lign-aloes:yet he was always in pain. I then withdrew to this place. Scant happiness isall my passing years afford me. Since then a knight rode that way, and it wouldhave been better had he not done so—the knight I told you of before. All that heachieved there was shame, for he saw all the marks of suffering yet failed toask his host 'Sire, what ails you?' Since youthful inexperience saw to it thathe asked no Question, he let slip a golden opportunity.\"CHAPTER 16Anfortas and his people were still suffering an agony of grief. From loyal lovethey left him in his plight. For he often asked them to let him die and indeedwould soon have done so had they not, as often, shown him the potent Gral.The King often kept his eyes shut tight for as many as four days on end. Thenthey carried him to the Gral whether he liked it or not, and with the maladyracking him to the point where he had to open his eyes, he was made to liveagainst his will and not die. This was how they proceeded with him until the daywhen Parzival and particoloured Feirefiz rode joyfully to Munsalvaesche.The newcomers found a great multitude of people there: fine old knights innumber, noble pages, many men-at-arms. The mournful Household had good cause torejoice at their coming! Feirefiz Angevin and Parzival were well received on theflight of steps leading up to the Palace, into which they then all went.Here, according to custom, lay a hundred large round carpets, each with acushion of down on it and a long quilt of samite. If the pair went about ittactfully they could find seats somewhere or other till their armour was takenfrom them . . .A chamberlain now went up to them bringing them robes of equal splendour. Allthe knights present sat down, and many precious cups of gold— not glass—were setbefore them. After drinking, Feirefiz and Parzival went to the sorrowfulAnfortas.You have already heard all about his reclining instead of sitting, and howrichly his bed was adorned. Anfortas now received the pair joyfully, yet withsigns of anguish, too.\"I have suffered torments of expectation, wondering if you were ever going torestore me to happiness. Now, the last time, you left me in such a way that ifyours is a kind and helpful nature you will show remorse for it. If you are aman of reputation and honour, ask the knights and maidens here to let me die,and so end my agony. If you are Parzival, keep me from seeing the Gral for sevennights and eight days—then all my sorrows will be over! I dare not prompt youotherwise. Happy you, if people were to say you succoured me! Your companionhere is a stranger: I am not content that he should stand in my presence. Why doyou not let him go to take his ease?\"Parzival wept. \"Tell me where the Gral is,\" he said. \"If the goodness of Godtriumphs in me, this Company here shall witness it!\" Thrice did he genuflect inits direction to the glory of the Trinity, praying that the affliction of thisman of sorrows be taken from him. Then, rising to his full height, he added:\"Dear Uncle, what ails you?\"He Who for St Sylvester's sake bade a bull return from death to life and go, andLazarus stand up, now helped Anfortas to become whole and well again. Thelustre which the French call \"fleur\" entered his complexion—Parzival's beautywas as nothing beside it, and that of Absalom son of David, and Vergulaht ofAscalun, and of all who were of handsome race, and the good looks conceded toGahmuret when they saw the delightful sight of him marching into Kanvoleiz— thebeauty of none of these was equal to that which Anfortas carried out from hisillness. God's power to apply his artistry is undiminished today.No other Election was made than of the man the Gral Inscription had named to betheir lord. Parzival was recognized forthwith as King and Sovereign. If I am anyjudge of wealth, I imagine no one would find a pair of men as rich as Parzivaland Feirefiz in any other place. The Lord and Master and his guest were servedassiduously.I do not know how many leagues Condwiramurs had ridden by then towardsMunsalvaesche in happy mood.—She had learnt the truth earlier on, a message hadcome to her that her sad state of deprivation was over. Duke Kyot and many otherworthy men had thereupon conducted her thence into the forest at Terresalvaesche, where Segramors had been felled by a lance-thrust and the snow andblood had so resembled her. There Parzival was to fetch her, an excursion hecould well endure!A Templar reported to him as follows. \"A group of courtly knights have broughtthe Queen with all ceremony.\" Parzival decided to take some of the Gral Companyand ride out to Trevrizent's, whose heart rejoiced at the news that Anfortas sfortunes now stood at the pont where he was not to die of his lance-wound, andthe Question had won him peace.\"God has many mysteries,\" Trevrizent told Parzival. \"Whoever sat at His councilsor who has fathomed His power? Not all the Host of Angels will ever get to thebottom of it. God is Man and His Father's Word, God is both Father and Son, HisSpirit has power to bring great succour. A greater marvel never occurred, inthat, after all, with your defiance you have wrung the concession from God thatHis everlasting Trinity has given you your wish. I lied as a means ofdistracting you from the Gral and how things stood concerning it. Let me atonefor my error—I now owe you obedience, Nephew and my lord. You heard from me thatthe banished angels were at the Gral with God's full support till they should bereceived back into His Grace. But God is constant in such matters: He neverceases to war against those whom I named to you here as forgiven. Whoeverdesires to have reward from God must be in feud with those angels. For they areeternally damned and chose their own perdition. But I am very sorry you had sucha hard time. It was never the custom that any should battle his way to the Gral:I wished to divert you from it. Yet your affairs have now taken another turn,and your prize is all the loftier! Now guide your thoughts towards humility.\"\"I wish to see the woman I have not seen once in five years,\" said Parzival tohis uncle. \"When we were together she was dear to me, as she indeed still is.—Of course I wish to have your advice as long as we are both alive: you advisedme well in the past, when I was in great need. Now I wish to ride and meet mywife who, as I have heard, has reached a place on the Plimizoel on her way tome.\"Parzival asked Trevrizent for leave to go, and the good man commended him toGod.Parzival rode through the night, for the Forest was well-known to hiscompanions. When it dawned, he was approaching a place where many tents had beenpitched, a find that pleased him greatly. Many pennants of the land of Brobarzhad been planted there, with many shields that had marched behind them. Theywere the Princes of his own country who were encamped there. Parzival inquiredwhere the Queen herself was quartered, and if she had her own separate ring, andthey showed him where she lay surrounded by tents in a sumptuous ring.Now Duke Kyot of Katelangen had risen early. Parzival and his men were ridingup. The ray of dawn was still silver-grey, yet Kyot at once recognized the Gralescutcheon worn by the company, for they were displaying nothing butTurtle-doves. The old man fetched a sigh when he saw it, since his chasteSchoy-siane had won him great happiness at Munsalvaesche and then died givingbirth to Sigune.Kyot went up to Parzival and received him and his people kindly. He sent a pageto the Queen's Marshal to ask him to provide good lodgment for whatever knightshe saw had reined in there. Parzival himself he led by the hand to where theQueen's wardrobe stood, a small tent of buckram. There they unarmed himcompletely.Of this the Queen as yet knew nothing. In a tall and spacious pavilion in whichnumerous fair ladies were lying, here, there, and everywhere, Parzival foundLoherangrin and Kardeiz beside her, and—joy perforce overwhelmed him!—Kyotrapped on the coverlet and told the Queen to wake up and laugh for sheerhappiness. She opened her eyes and saw her husband. She had nothing on her buther shift, so she swung the coverlet round her and sprang from the bed on to thecarpet, radiant Condwiramurs! As to Parzival, he took her into his arms, and Iam told they kissed.\"Welcome! Fortune has sent you to me, my heart's joy,\" she said. \"Now I ought toscold you, but I cannot. All honour to this day and hour that have brought methis embrace, banishing all my sadness! I have my heart's desire. Care will getnothing from me!\"The boys Kardeiz and Loherangrin, who lay there naked in the bed, now woke up.Parzival, nothing loth, kissed them affectionately. Tactful Kyot then had theboys carried out. He also hinted to those ladies that they should leave thepavilion, and this they did after welcoming their lord back from his longjourney. Kyot then courteously commended the Queen's husband to her and led theyoung ladies away. It vvas still very early. The chamberlains closed the flaps.If ever on a past occasion the company of his wits had been snatched away fromhim by blood and snow (he had in fact seen them on this very meadow!),Condwiramurs now made amends for such torment: she had it there. He had neverreceived Love's aid for Love's distress elsewhere, though many fine women hadoffered him their love. As far as I know, he disported himself there tilltowards mid-morning.Balin or the Knight with theTwo SwordsSIR THOMAS MALORYThis story is largely Malory's invention in order to explain the origin of theWasteland. It differs sharply from the origin in Chretien, Wolfram, and theQueste del Saint Graal. Malory is more analytic; he presents Balin, asuper-socialized knight whose over-zealous desire to accomplish sociallydetermined goals, as opposed to searching for his own path, destroys every landhe visits.After the death of Uther reigned Arthur, his son, which had great war in hisdays for to get all England into his hand; for there were many kings within therealm of England and of Scotland, Wales and Cornwall.So it befell on a time when King Arthur was at London, there came a knight andtold the king tidings how the King Rions of North Wales had reared a greatnumber of people, and were entered in the land and brent and slew the king'strue liege people.\"If this be true,\" said Arthur, \"it were great shame unto mine estate but thathe were mightily withstood.\"\"It is truth,\" said the knight, \"for I saw the host myself.\"\"Well,\" said the king, \"I shall ordain to withstand his malice.\"Then the king let make a cry that all the lords, knights and gentlemen of armsshould draw unto the castle called Camelot in those days, and there the kingwould let make a council-general and a great jousts. So when the king was comethither with all his baronage and lodged as they seemed best, also there wascome a damsel the which was sent from the great Lady Lyle of Avalon. And whenshe came before King Arthur she told from whence she came, and how she was senton message unto him for these causes. Then she let her mantle fall that wasrichly furred, and then was she girt with a noble sword, whereof the king hadmarvel and said,\"Damsel, for what cause are ye girt with that sword? It beseemeth you nought.\"\"Now shall I tell you,\" said the damsel. \"This sword that I am girt withal dothme great sorrow and cumbrance, for I may not be delivered of this sword but by aknight, and he must be a passing good man of his hands and of his deeds, andwithout villainy other treachery, and without treason. And if I may find such aknight that hath all these virtues, he may draw out this sword out of thesheath.\"Then it befell so that time there was a poor knight with King Arthur that hadbeen prisoner with him half a year for slaying of a knight which was cousin untoKing Arthur. And the name of this knight was called Balin, and by good means ofthe barons he was delivered out of prison, for he was a good man named of hisbody, and he was born in Northumberland. And so he went privily into the courtand saw this adventure whereof it raised his heart, and would essay as otherknights did. But for he was poor and poorly arrayed, he put himself not far inpress. But in his heart he was fully assured to do as well, if his grace happedhim, as any knight that there was. And as the damsel took her leave of Arthurand of all the barons, so departing, this knight Balin called unto her and said,\"Damsel, I pray you of your courtesy suffer me as well to essay as these otherlords. Though that I be poorly arrayed yet in my heart meseemeth I am fullyassured as some of these other, and meseemeth in mine heart to speed rightwell.\"This damsel then beheld this poor knight and saw he was a likely man; but forhis poor arrayment she thought he should not be of no worship without villainyor treachery. And then she said unto that knight,\"Sir, it needeth not you to put me to no more pain, for it seemeth not you tospeed thereas all these other knights have failed.\"\"Ah, fair damsel,\" said Balin, \"worthiness and good tatches and also good deedsis not only in arrayment, but manhood and worship is hid within a man's person;and many a worshipful knight is not known unto all people. And therefore worshipand hardiness is not in arrayment.\"\"By God,\" said the damsel, \"ye say sooth, therefore ye shall essay to do what yemay.\"Then Balin took the sword by the girdle and sheath and drew it out easily; andwhen he looked on the sword it pleased him much. Then had the king and all thebarons great marvel that Balin had done that adventure; many knights had greatdespite at him.\"Certes,\" said the damsel, \"this is a passing good knight and the best that everI found, and most of worship without treason, treachery, or felony. And manymarvels shall he do. Now, gentle and courteous knight, give me the sword again.\"\"Nay,\" said Balin, \"for this sword will I keep but it be taken from me withforce.\"\"Well,\" said the damsel, \"ye are not wise to keep the sword from me, for yeshall slay with that sword the best friend that ye have and the man that ye mostlove in the world, and that sword shall be your destruction.\"\"I shall take the adventure,\" said Balin, \"that God will ordain for me. But thesword ye shall not have at this time, by the faith of my body!\"\"Ye shall repent it within short time,\" said the damsel, \"for I would have thesword more for your advantage than for mine; for I am passing heavy for yoursake, for an ye will not leave that sword it shall be your destruction, and thatis great pity.\"So at that time there was a knight the which was the king's son of Ireland, andhis name was Lanceor, the which was an orgulous knight and accounted himself oneof the best of the court. And he had great despite at Balin for the achieving ofthe sword, that any should be accounted more hardy or more of prowess, and heasked King Arthur license to ride after Balin and to revenge the despite that hehad done.\"Do your best,\" said Arthur. \"I am right wroth with Balin. I would he were quitof the despite that he hath done unto me and my court.\"Then this Lanceor went to his ostry to make him ready. So in the meanwhile cameMerlin unto the court of King Arthur, and anon was told him the adventure of thesword and the death of the Lady of the Lake.\"Now shall I say you,\" said Merlin; \"this same damsel that here standeth, thatbrought the sword unto your court, I shall tell you the cause of her coming. Sheis the falsest damsel that liveth—she shall not say nay! For she hath a brother,a passing good knight of prowess and a full true man, and this damsel lovedanother knight that held her as paramour. And this good knight, her brother, metwith the knight that held her to paramour, and slew him by force of his hands.And when this false damsel understood this she went to the Lady Lyle of Avalonand took her his sword and besought her of help to be revenged on her ownbrother.\"And so this Lady Lyle of Avalon took her this sword that she brought with her,and told there should no man pull it out of the sheath but if he be one of thebest knights of this realm, and he should be hardy and full of prowess; and withthat sword he should slay his brother. This was the cause, damsel, that ye cameinto this court. I know it as well as ye. God would ye had not come here; but yecame never in fellowship of worshipful folk for to do good, but always greatharm. And that knight that hath achieved the sword shall be destroyed throughthe sword; for which will be great damage, for there liveth not a knight of moreprowess than he is. And he shall do unto you, my lord Arthur, great honour andkindness; and it is great pity he shall not endure but a while, for of hisstrength and hardiness I know him not living his match \"So this knight of Ireland armed him at all points and dressed his shield on hisshoulder and mounted upon horseback and took his glaive in his hand, and rodeafter a great pace as much as his horse might drive. And within a little space,on a mountain, he had a sight of Balin, and with a loud voice he cried,\"Abide, knight! for else ye shall abide whether ye will either no! And theshield that is tofore you shall not help you,\" said this Irish knight,\"therefore come I after you.\"\"Peradventure,\" said Balin, \"ye had been better to have hold you at home. Formany a man weeneth to put his enemy to a rebuke, and oft it falleth on himself.Out of what court be ye come from?\" said Balin.\"I am come from the court of King Arthur,\" said the knight of Ireland, \"that amcome hither to revenge the despite ye did this day unto King Arthur and to hiscourt.\"\"Well,\" said Balin, \"I see well I must have ado with you; that me forthinkeththat I have grieved King Arthur or any of his court. And your quarrel is fullsimple,\" said Balin, \"unto me; for the lady that is dead did to me great damage,and else I would have been loath as any knight that liveth for to slay a lady.\"\"Make you ready,\" said the knight Lanceor, \"and dress you unto me, for that oneshall abide in the field.\"Then they feautred their spears in their rests and came together as much astheir horses might drive. And the Irish knight smote Balin on the shield thatall went to shivers off his spear. And Balin smote him again through the shield,andthe hauberk perished, and so bore him through the body and over the horsecrupper; and anon turned his horse fiercely and drew out his sword, and wist notthat he had slain him.Then he saw him lie as a dead corpse, he looked about him and was ware of adamsel that came riding full fast as the horse might drive, on a fair palfrey.And when she espied that Lanceor was slain she made sorrow out of measure andsaid,\"Ah! Balin, two bodies thou hast slain in one heart, and two hearts in one body,and two souls thou hast lost.\"x\\nd therewith she took the sword from her love that lay dead, and fell to theground in a swough. And when she arose she made great dole out of measure, whichsorrow grieved Balin passingly sore. And he went unto her for to have taken thesword out of her hand; but she held it so fast he might not take it out of herhand but if he should have hurt her. And suddenly she set the pommel to theground, and rove herself throughout the body.When Balin espied her deeds he was passing heavy in his heart and ashamed thatso fair a damsel had destroyed herself for the love of his death. \"Alas!\" saidBalin, \"me repenteth sore the death of this knight for the love of this damsel,for there was much true love betwixt them.\" And so for sorrow he might no longerbehold them, but turned his horse and looked toward a fair forest.And then was he ware by his arms that there came riding his brother Balan. Andwhen they were met they put off their helms and kissed together and wept for joyand pity. Then Balan said,\"Brother, I little weened to have met you at this sudden adventure, but I amright glad of your deliverance of your dolorous prisonment: for a man told me inthe Castle of Four Stones that ye were delivered, and that man had seen you inthe court of King Arthur. And therefore I came hither into this country, forhere I supposed to find you.\"And anon Balin told his brother of his adventure of the sword and the death ofthe Lady of the Lake, and how King Arthur was displeased with him.\"Wherefore he sent this knight after me that lieth here dead. And the death ofthis damsel grieveth me sore.\"\"So doth it me,\" said Balan, \"but ye must take the adventure that God willordain you.\"\"Truly,\" said Balan, \"I am right heavy that my lord Arthur is displeased withme, for he is the most worshipfullest king that reigneth now in earth; and hislove I will get other else I will put my life in adventure. For King Rions liethat the siege of the Castle Terrabi 1 , and thither will we draw in all goodlyhaste to prove our worship and prowess upon him.\"\"I will well,\" said Balan, \"that ye do so; and I will ride with you and put mybody in adventure with you, as a brother ought to do.\"\"Now go we hence,\" said Balin, \"and well we be met.\"The meanwhile as they talked there came a dwarf from the city of Camelot onhorseback as much as he might, and found the dead bodies; wherefore he madegreat dole, and pulled his hair for sorrow, and said,\"Which of two knights have done this deed?\"\"Wherebv asketh thou?\" said Balan.\"For I would wit,\" said the dwarf.\"It was I,\" said Balin, \"that slew this knight in my defendant; for hither hecame to chase me, and either I must slay him either he me. And this damsel slewherself for his love, which repenteth me. And for her sake I shall owe all womenthe better will and service all the days of my life.\"\"Alas!\" said the dwarf, \"thou hast done great damage unto thyself. For thisknight that is here dead was one of the most valiant men that lived. And trustwell, Balin, the kin of this knight will chase you through the world till theyhave slain you.\"\"As for that,\" said Balin, \"them I fear not greatly; but I am right heavy that Ishould displease my lord, King Arthur, for the death of this knight.\"So as they talked together there came a king of Cornwall riding, which hightKing Mark. And when he saw these two bodies dead, and understood how they weredead by the two knights above-said, then made the king great sorrow for the truelove that was betwixt them, and said, \"I will not depart till I have on thisearth made a tomb.\" And there he pight his pavilions and sought all the countryto find a tomb, and in a church they found one was fair and rich. And then theking let put them both in the earth, and laid the tomb upon them, and wrote thenames of them both on the tomb, how \"here lieth Lanceor, the king's son ofIreland, that at his own request was slain by the hands of Balin,\" and how \"thislady Columbe and paramour to him slew herself with his sword for dole andsorrow.\"And so departed King Mark unto Camelot to King Arthur.And Balin took the way to King Rions, and as they rode together they met withMerlin disguised so that they knew him nought.\"But whitherward ride ye?\" said Merlin.\"We had little ado to tell you,\" said these two knights.\"But what is thy name?\" said Balin.\"At this time,\" said Merlin, \"I will not tell.\"\"It is an evil sign,\" said the knights, \"that thou art a true man, that thouwilt not tell thy name.\"\"As for that,\" said Merlin, \"be as it be may. But I can tell you wherefore yeride this way: for to meet with King Rions. But it will not avail you without yehave my counsel.\"\"Ah,\" said Balin, \"ye are Merlin! We will be ruled by your counsel!\"\"Come on,\" said Merlin, \"and ye shall have great worship. And look that ye doknightly, for ye shall have need.\"\"As for that,\" said Balin, \"dread you not, for we will do what we may.\"Then there lodged Merlin and these two knights in a wood among the leaves besidethe highway, and took off the bridles of their horses and put them to grass, andlaid them down to rest till it was nigh midnight. Then Merlin bade them rise andmake them ready: \"for here cometh the king nighhand, that was stolen away fromhis host with a three score horses of his best knights, and twenty of them rodetofore the lord to warn the Lady de Vaunce that the king was coming.\" For thatnight King Rions should have lain with her.\"Which is the king?\" said Balin.\"Abide\" said Merlin, \"for here in a strait way ye shall meet with him.\" Andtherewith he showed Balin and his brother the king.And anon they met with him, and smote him down and wounded him freshly, and laidhim to the ground. And there they slew on the right hand and on the left handmore than forty of his men; and the remnant fled. Then went they again unto KingRions and would have slain him, had he not yielded him unto their grace. Thensaid he thus:\"Knights full of prowess, slay me not! For by my life ye may win, and by mydeath little.\"\"Ye say sooth,\" said the knights, and so laid him on a horse-litter.So with that Merlin vanished, and came to King Arthur aforehand and told him howhis most enemy was taken and discomfit.\"By whom?\" said King Arthur.\"By two knights,\" said Merlin, \"that would fain have your lordship. And tomorrowye shall know what knights they are.\"So anon after came the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother, and broughtwith them King Rions of North Wales, and there delivered him to the porters, andcharged them with him.And so they two returned again in the dawning of the day.Then King Arthur came to King Rions and said,\"Sir king, ye are welcome. By what adventure came ye hither?\"\"Sir,\" said King Rions, \"I came hither by a hard adventure.\"\"Who won you?\" said King Arthur.\"Sir,\" said he, \"the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother, which are twomarvellous knights of prowess.\"\"I know them not,\" said Arthur, \"but much am I beholding unto them.\"\"Ah, sir,\" said Merlin, \"I shall tell you. It is Balin that achieved the swordand his brother Balan, a good knight: there liveth not a better of prowess,nother of worthiness. And it shall be the greatest dole of him that ever I knewof knight; for he shall not long endure.\"\"Alas,\" said King Arthur, \"that is great pity; for I am much beholding unto him,and I have evil deserved it again for his kindness.\"\"Nay, nay,\" said Merlin, \"he shall do much more for you, and that shall ye knowin haste.\"Then they rode three or four days and never met with adventure. And so byfortune they were lodged with a gentleman that was a rich man and well at ease.And as they sat at supper Balin heard one complain grievously by him in achamber.\"What is this noise?\" said Balin.\"Forsooth,\" said his host, \"I will tell you. I was but late at a jousting andthere I jousted with a knight that is brother unto King Pellam, and twice Ismote him down. And then he promised to quit me on my best friend. And so hewounded thus my son that cannot be whole till I have of that knight's blood. Andhe rideth all invisible, but I know not his name.\"$\"Ah,\" said Balin, \"I know that knight's name, which is Garlon, and he hath slaintwo knights of mine in the same manner. Therefore I had liefer meet with thatknight than all the gold in this realm, for the despite he hath done me.\"\"Well,\" said his host, \"I shall tell you how. King Pellam of Listenoise hathmade do cry in all the country a great feast that shall be within these twentydays, and no knight may come there but he bring his wife with him other hisparamour. And that your enemy and mine ye shall see that day.\"\"Then I promise you,\" said Balin, \"part of his blood to heal your son withal.\"\"Then we will be forward to-morn,\" said he.So on the morn they rode all three toward King Pellam, and they had fifteendays' journey or they came thither. And that same day began the great feast. Andso they alight and stabled their horses and went into the castle, but Balin'shost might not be let in because he had no lady. But Balin was well received andbrought unto a chamber and unarmed him. And there was brought him robes to hispleasure, and would have had Balin leave his sword behind him.\"Nay,\" said Balin, \"that will I not, for it is the custom of my country a knightalways to keep his weapon with him. Other else,\" said he, \"I will depart as Icame.\"Then they gave him leave with his sword, and so he went into the castle and wasamong knights of worship, and his lady afore him. So after this Balin asked aknight and said,\"Is there not a knight in this court which his name is Garlon?\"\"Yes, sir, yonder he goeth, the knight with the black face, for he is themarvellest knight that is now living. And he destroyeth many good knights, forhe goeth invisible.\"\"Well,\" said Balin, \"is that he?\" Then Balin advised him long, and thought: \"IfI slay him here, I shall not escape. And if I leave him now, peradventure Ishall never meet with him again at such a steven, and much harm he will do an helive.\"And therewith this Garlon espied that Balin visaged him, so he came and slappedhim on the face with the back of his hand and said,\"Knight, why beholdest thou me so? For shame, eat thy meat and do that thou comefor.\"\"Thou sayest sooth,\" said Balin, \"this is not the first spite that thou hastdone me, and therefore I will do that I come for.\" And rose him up fiercely andclave his head to the shoulders.\"Now give me the truncheon, said Balin to his lady, \"that he slew your knightwith.\"And anon she gave it him, for always she bore the truncheon with her. Andtherewith Balin smote him through the body and said openly,\"With that truncheon thou slewest a good knight, and now it sticketh in thybody.\" Then Balin called unto his host and said, \"Now may ye fetch blood enoughto heal your son withal.\"So anon all the knights rose from the table for to set on Balin. And King Pellamhimself arose up fiercely and said,\"Knight, why hast thou slain my brother? Thou shalt die therefore or thoudepart.\"\"Well,\" said Balin, \"do it yourself.\"\"Yes,\" said King Pellam, \"there shall be no man have ado with thee but I myself,for the love of my brother.\"Then King Pellam caught in his hand a grim weapon and smote eagerly at Balin,but he put his sword betwixt his head and the stroke, and therewith his swordbrast in sunder. And when Balin was weaponless he ran into a chamber for to seeka weapon, and from chamber to chamber, and no weapon could he find. And alwaysKing Pellam followed after him. And at last he entered into a chamber which wasmarvellously dight and rich, and a bed arrayed with cloth of gold, the richestthat might be, and one lying therein. And thereby stood a table of clean goldwith four pillars of silver that bore up the table, and upon the table stood amarvellous spear strangely wrought.So when Balin saw the spear he got it in his hand and turned to King Pellam andfelled him and smote him passingly sore with that spear, that King Pellam felldown in a swough. And therewith the castle broke, roof and walls, and fell downto the earth. And Balin fell down and might not stir hand nor foot, and for themost party of that castle was dead through the Dolorous Stroke.Right so lay King Pellam and Balin three days.Then Merlin came thither, and took up Balin and gat him a good horse, for hiswas dead, and bade him void out of that country.\"Sir, I would have my damsel,\" said Balin.\"Lo,\" said Merlin, \"where she lieth dead.\"And King Pellam lay so many years sore wounded, and might never be whole tillthat Galahad the Haut Prince healed him in the quest of the Sank-greall. For inthat place was part of the blood of Our Lord Jesu Christ, which Joseph ofArimathea brought into this land. And there himself lay in that rich bed. Andthat was the spear which Longius smote Our Lord with to the heart. And KingPellam was nigh of Joseph his kin, and that was the most worshipfullest man onlife in those days, and great pity it was of his hurt, for through that strokeit turned to great dole, tray and teen.Then departed Balin from Merlin, \"for,\" he said, \"never in this world we partneither meet no more.\" So he rode forth through the fair countries and citiesand found the people dead and slain on every side, and all that ever were onlive cried and said,\"Ah, Balin! Thou has done and caused great damage in these countries! For theDolorous Stroke thou gave unto King Pellam these three countries are destroyed.And doubt not but the vengeance will fall on thee at the last!\"\"O knight Balin, why have ye left your own shield? Alas! ye have put yourself ingreat danger, for by your shield ye should have been known. It is great pity ofyou as ever was of knight, for of thy prowess and hardiness thou hast no fellowliving.\"\"Me repenteth,\" said Balin, \"that ever I came within this country, but I may notturn now again for shame, and what adventure shall fall to me, be it life ordeath, I will take the adventure that shall come to me.\"And then he looked on his armour and understood he was well armed, and therewithblessed him and mounted upon his horse. Then afore him he saw come riding out ofa castle a knight, and his horse trapped all red, and himself in the samecolour. When this knight in the red beheld Balin, him thought it should be hisbrother Balin because of his two swords, but because he knew not his shield hedeemed it was not he.And so they aventred their spears and came marvellously fast together, and theysmote other in the shields, but their spears and their course were so big thatit bare down horse and man, that they lay both in a swoon; but Balin was bruisedsore with the fall of the horse, for he was weary of travel. And Balan was thefirst that rose on foot and drew his sword, and went toward Balin, and he aroseand went against him; but Balan smote Balin first, and he put up his shield andsmote him through the shield and tamed his helm. Then Balin smote him again withthat unhappy sword, and well-nigh had felled his brother Balan, and so theyfought there together till their breaths failed.Then Balin looked up to the castle and saw the towers stand full of ladies. Sothey went unto battle again, and wounded everych other dolefully, and then theybreathed ofttimes, and so went unto battle that all the place thereas theyfought was blood red. And at that time there was none of them both but they hadeither smitten other seven great wounds, so that the least of them might havebeen the death of the mightiest giant in this world.Then they went to battle again so marvellously that doubt it was to hear of thatbattle for the great blood-shedding, and their hauberks unnailed, that nakedthey were on every side. At the last Balan, the younger brother, withdrew him alittle and laid him down. Then said Balin le Savage,\"What knight art thou? For or now I found never no knight that matched me.\"\"My name is,\" said he, \"Balan, brother unto the good knight Balin.\"\"Alas,\" said Balin, \"that ever I should see this day!\" and therewith he fellbackward in a swoon.Then Balan yode on all four, feet and hands, and put off the helm of hisbrother, and might not know him by the visage, it was so full hewn and bled; butwhen he awoke he said,\"O Balan, my brother! Thou hast slain me and I thee, wherefore all the wideworld shall speak of us both.\"\"Alas,\" said Balan, \"that ever I saw this day, that through mishap I might notknow you! For I espied well your two swords, but because ye had another shield Ideemed ye had been another knight.\"\"Alas,\" said Balin, \"all that made an unhappy knight in the castle, for hecaused me to leave mine own shield to our both's destruction. And if I mightlive I would destroy that castle for ill customs \"\"That were well done,\" said Balan, \"for I had never grace to depart from themsyn that I came hither, for here it happed me to slay a knight that kept thisisland, and syn might I never depart. And no more should ye, brother, and yemight have slain me as ye have and escaped yourself with the life.\"Right so came the lady of the tower with four knights and six ladies and sixyeomen unto them, and there she heard how they made their moan either toother and said, \"We came both out ol one womb, that is to say one mother sbelly, and so shall we lie both in one pit. So Balan prayed the lady of hergentleness for his true service that she would bury them both in that same placethere the battle was done, and she granted them, with weeping, it should be donerichly in the best manner.\"Now, will ye send for a priest, that we may receive our sacrament, and receivethe blessed body of Our Lord Jesu Christ?\"\"Yea,\" said the lady, \"it shall be done;\" and so she sent for a priest and gavethem their rites.\"Now,\" said Balin, \"when we are buried in one tomb, and the mention made over ushow two brethren slew each other, there will never good knight nor good man seeour tomb but they will pray for our souls.\" And so all the ladies andgentlewomen wept for pity.Then anon Balan died, but Balin died not till the midnight after. And so werethey buried both, and the lady let make a mention of Balan how he was thereslain by his brother's hands, but she knew not Balin's name.In the morn came Merlin and let write Balin's name on the tomb with letters ofgold, that here lieth balin le savage that was the knight withTHE TWO SWORDS, AND HE THAT SMOTE THE DOLOROUS STROKE. Also Merlin letmake there a bed, that there should never man lie therein but he went out of hiswit. Yet Lancelot du Lake forbid that bed through his noblesse.And anon after Balin was dead Merlin took his sword and took off the pommel andset on another pommel. So Merlin bade a knight that stood before him to handlethat sword, and he essayed it and might not handle it. Then Merlin laughed.\"Why laugh ye?\" said the knight.\"This is the cause,\" said Merlin: \"there shall never man handle this sword butthe best knight of the world, and that shall be Sir Lancelot other else Galahad,his son. And Lancelot with this sword shall slay the man that in the world heloveth best, that shall be Sir Gawain.\"And all this he let write in the pommel of the sword.Then Merlin let make a bridge of iron and steel into that island, and it was buthalf a foot broad, \"and there shall never man pass that bridge, nother havehardiness to go over it but if he were a passing good man and a good knightwithout treachery or villainy.\" Also the scabbard of Balin's sword Merlin leftit on this side the island, that Galahad should find it. Also Merlin let make byhis subtlety that Balin's sworo was put in a marble stone standing upright asgreat as a millstone, and hoved always above the water, and did many years. Andso by adventure it swam down the stream to the City of Camelot, that is inEnglish called Winchester. And the same day Galahad the Haute Prince came withKing Arthur, and so Galahad brought with him the scabbard and achieved the swordthat was in the marble stone hoving upon the water. And on Whitsunday heachieved the sword, as it is rehearsed in The Book of the Sankgreall.Soon after this was done Merlin came to King Arthur and told him of the DolorousStroke that Balin gave King Pellam, and how Balin and Balan foughttogether the most marvellous battle that ever was heard of, and how they wereburied both in one tomb.\"Alas!\" said King Arthur, \"this is the greatest pity that ever I heard tell oftwo knights, for in this world I knew never such two knights.\"THUS ENDETH THE TALE OF BALIN AND OF BALAN, TWO BRETHREN THAT WERE BORN INNORTHUMBERLAND, THAT WERE TWO PASSING GOOD KNIGHTS AS EVER WERE IN THOSE DAYS.Confrontation with the UnconsciousCARL G. JUNGIn this selection from his autobiography, Carl G. Jung, the famous psychiatrist,recounts his discovery of his own path in psychoanalysis after leaving thediscipleship of Sigmund Freud. Earlier in the autobiography, Jung compares hislife at this stage to the Grail Quest: \"In the period following these dreams Idid a great deal of thinking about the mysterious figure of the knight. But itwas only much later, after I had been meditating on the dream for a long time,that I was able to get some idea of its meaning. ... I had an inkling that agreat secret lay hidden behind those stories. Therefore it seemed quite naturalto me that the dream should conjure up the world of the Knights of the Grail andtheir quest — for that was, in the deepest sense, my own world, which hadscarcely anything to do with Freud's. My whole being was seeking for somethingstill unknown which might confer meaning upon the banality of my life.\"After the parting of the ways with Freud, a period of inner uncertainty beganfor me. It would be no exaggeration to call it a state of disorientation. I felttotally suspended in mid-air, for I had not yet found my own footing. Above all,I felt it necessary to develop a new attitude toward my patients. I resolved forthe present not to bring any theoretical premises to bear upon them, but to waitand see what they would tell of their own accord. My aim became to leave thingsto chance. The result was that the patients would spontaneously report theirdreams and fantasies to me, and I would merely ask, \"What occurs to you inconnection with that?\" or, \"How do you mean that, where does that come from,what do you think about it?\" The interpretations seemed to follow oftheir own accord from the patients replies and associations. I avoided alltheoretical points of view and simply helped the patients to understand thedream-images by themselves, without application of rules and theories.Soon I realized that it was right to take the dreams in this way as the basis ofinterpretation, for that is how dreams are intended. They are the facts fromwhich we must proceed. Naturally, the aspects resulting from this method were somultitudinous that the need for a criterion grew more and more pressing— theneed, I might also put it, for some initial orientation.About this time I experienced a moment of unusual clarity in which I looked backover the way I had traveled so far. I thought, \"Now you possess a key tomythology and are free to unlock all the gates of the unconscious psyche.\" Butthen something whispered within me, \"Why open all gates?\" And promptly thequestion arose of what, after all, I had accomplished. I had explained the mythsof peoples of the past; I had written a book about the hero, the myth in whichman has always lived. But in what myth does man live nowadays? In the Christianmyth, the answer might be, \"Do you live in it?\" I asked myself. To be honest,the answer was no. For me, it is not what I live by. \"Then do we no longer haveany myth?\" \"No, evidently we no longer have any myth \" \"But then what is yourmyth—the myth in which you do live?\" At this point the dialogue with myselfbecame uncomfortable, and I stopped thinking. I had reached a dead end.Then, around Christmas of 1912, I had a dream. In the dream I found myself in amagnificent Italian loggia with pillars, a marble floor, and a marblebalustrade. I was sitting on a gold Renaissance chair; in front of me was atable of rare beauty. It was made of green stone, like emerald. There I sat,looking out into the distance, for the loggia was set high up on the tower of acastle. My children were sitting at the table too.Suddenly a white bird descended, a small sea gull or a dove. Gracefully, it cameto rest on the table, and I signed to the children to be still so that theywould not frighten away the pretty white bird. Immediately, the dove wastransformed into a little girl, about eight years of age, with golden blondhair. She ran off with the children and played with them among the colonnades ofthe castle.I remained lost in thought, musing about what I had just experienced. The littlegirl returned and tenderly placed her arms around my neck. Then she suddenlyvanished; the dove was back and spoke slowly in a human voice. \"Only in thefirst hours of the night can I transform myself into a human being, while themale dove is busy with the twelve dead.\" Then she flew off into the blue air,and I awoke.I was greatly stirred. What business would a male dove be having with twelvedead people? In connection with the emerald table the story of the TabulaSmaragdina occurred to me, the emerald table in the alchemical legend of HermesTrismegistos. He was said to have left behind him a table upon which the basictenets of alchemical wisdom were engraved in Greek.I also thought of the twelve apostles, the twelve months of the year, the signsof the zodiac, etc. But I could find no solution to the enigma. Finally I had togive it up. All I knew with any certainty was that the dream indicated anunusual activation of the unconscious. But I knew no technique whereby I mightget to the bottom of my inner processes, and so there remained nothing for me todo but wait, go on with my life, and pay close attention to my fantasies.One fantasy kept returning: there was something dead present, but it was alsostill alive. For example, corpses were placed in crematory ovens, but were thendiscovered to be still living. These fantasies came to a head and weresimultaneously resolved in a dream.I was in a region like the Alyscamps near Aries. There they have a lane ofsarcophagi which go back to Merovingian times. In the dream I was coming fromthe city, and saw before me a similar lane with a long row of tombs. They werepedestals with stone slabs on which the dead lay. They reminded me of old churchburial vaults, where knights in armor lie outstretched. Thus the dead lay in mydream, in their antique clothes, with hands clasped, the difference being thatthey were not hewn out of stone, but in a curious fashion mummified. I stoodstill in front of the first grave and looked at the dead man, who was a personof the eighteen-thirties. I looked at his clothes with interest, whereupon hesuddenly moved and came to life. He unclasped his hands; but that was onlybecause I was looking at him. I had an extremely unpleasant feeling, but walkedon and came to another body. He belonged to the eighteenth century. Thereexactly the same thing happened: when I looked at him, he came to life and movedhis hands. So I went down the whole row, until I came to the twelfthcentury—that is, to a crusader in chain mail who lay there with clasped hands.His figure seemed carved out of wood. For a long time I looked at him andthought he was really dead. But suddenly I saw that a finger of his left handwas beginning to stir gently.Of course I had originally held to Freud's view that vestiges of old experiencesexist in the unconscious. But dreams like this, and my actual experiences of theunconscious, taught me that such contents are not dead, outmoded forms, butbelong to our living being. My work had confirmed this assumption, and in thecourse of years there developed from it the theory of archetypes.The dreams, however, could not help me over my feeling of disorientation. On thecontrary, I lived as if under constant inner pressure. At times this became sostrong that I suspected there was some psychic disturbance in myself. ThereforeI twice went over all the details of my entire life, with particular attentionto childhood memories; for I thought there might be something in my past which Icould not see and which might possibly be the cause of the disturbance. But thisretrospection led to nothing but a fresh acknowledgment of my own ignorance.Thereupon I said to myself, \"Since I know nothing at all, I shall simply dowhatever occurs to me.\" Thus I consciously submitted myself to the impulses ofthe unconscious.The first thing that came to the surface was a childhood memory from perhaps mytenth or eleventh year. At that time I had had a spell of playing passionatelywith building blocks. I distinctly recalled how I had built little houses andcastles, using bottles to form the sides of gates and vaults. Somewhat later Ihad used ordinary stones, with mud for mortar. These structures had fascinatedme for a long time. To my astonishment, this memory was accompanied by a gooddeal of emotion. \"Aha,\" I said to myself, \"there is still life in these things.The small boy is still around, and possesses a creative life which I lack. Buthow can I make my way to it?\" For as a grown man it seemed impossible to me thatI should be able to bridge the distance from the present back to my eleventhyear. Yet if I wanted to re-establish contact with that period, I had no choicebut to return to it and take up once more that child's life with his childishgames. This moment was a turning point in my fate, but I gave in only afterendless resistances and with a sense of resignation. For it was a painfullyhumiliating experience to realize that there was nothing to be done except playchildish games.Nevertheless, I began accumulating suitable stones, gathering them partly fromthe lake shore and partly from the water. And I started building: cottages, acastle, a whole village. The church was still missing, so I made a squarebuilding with a hexagonal drum on top of it, and a dome. A church also requiresan altar, but I hesitated to build that.Preoccupied with the question of how I could approach this task, I was walkingalong the lake as usual one day, picking stones out of the gravel on the shore.Suddenly I caught sight of a red stone, a four-sided pyramid about an inch and ahalf high. It was a fragment of stone which had been polished into this shape bythe action of the water—a pure product of chance. I knew at once: this was thealtar! I placed it in the middle under the dome, and as I did so, I recalled theunderground phallus of my childhood dream. This connection gave me a feeling ofsatisfaction.I went on with my building game after the noon meal every day, whenever theweather permitted. As soon as I was through eating, I began playing, andcontinued to do so until the patients arrived; and if I was finished with mywork early enough in the evening, I went back to building. In the course of thisactivity my thoughts clarified, and I was able to grasp the fantasies whosepresence in myself I dimly felt.Naturally, I thought about the significance of what I was doing, and askedmyself, \"Now, really, what are you about? You are building a small town, anddoing it as if it were a rite!\" I had no answer to my question, only the innercertainty that I was on the way to discovering my own myth. For the buildinggame was only a beginning. It released a stream of fantasies which I latercarefully wrote down.In order to seize hold of the fantasies, I frequently imagined a steep descent.I even made several attempts to get to very bottom. The first time I reached, asit were, a depth of about a thousand feet; the next time I found myself at theedge of a cosmic abyss. It was like a voyage to the moon, or a descent intoempty space. First came the image of a crater, and I had the feeling that I wasin the land of the dead. The atmosphere was that of the other world. Near thesteep slope of a rock I caught sight of two figures, an old man with a whitebeard and a beautiful young girl. I summoned up my courage and approached themas though they were real people, and listened attentively to what they told me.The old man explained that he was Elijah, and that gave me a shock. But the girlstaggered me even more, for she called herself Salome! Shewas blind. What a strange couple: Salome and Elijah. But Elijah assured me thathe and Salome had belonged together from all eternity, which completelyastounded me. . . . They had a black serpent living with them which displayed anunmistakable fondness for me. I stuck close to Elijah because he seemed to bethe most reasonable of the three, and to have a clear intelligence. Of Salome Iwas distinctly suspicious. Elijah and I had a long conversation which, however,I did not understand.Naturally I tried to find a plausible explanation for the appearance of Biblicalfigures in my fantasy by reminding myself that my father had been a clergyman.But that really explained nothing at all. For what did the old man signify? Whatdid Salome signify? Why were they together? Only many years later, when I knew agreat deal more than I knew then, did the connection between the old man and theyoung girl appear perfectly natural to me.In such dream wanderings one frequently encounters an old man who is accompaniedby a young girl, and examples of such couples are to be found in many mythictales. Thus, according to Gnostic tradition, Simon Magus went about with a younggirl whom he had picked up in a brothel. Her name was Helen, and she wasregarded as the reincarnation of the Trojan Helen. Klingsor and Kundry, Lao-tzuand the dancing girl, likewise belong to this category.I have mentioned that there was a third figure in my fantasy besides Elijah andSalome: the large black snake. In myths the snake is a frequent counterpart ofthe hero. There are numerous accounts of their affinity. For example, the herohas eyes like a snake, or after his death he is changed into a snake and reveredas such, or the snake is his mother, etc. In my fantasy, therefore, the presenceof the snake was an indication of a hero-myth.Salome is an anima figure. She is blind because she does not see the meaning ofthings. Elijah is the figure of the wise old prophet and represents the factorof intelligence and knowledge; Salome, the erotic element. One might say thatthe two figures are personifications of Logos and Eros. But such a definitionwould be excessively intellectual. It is more meaningful to let the figures bewhat they were for me at the time—namely, events and experiences.Soon after this fantasy another figure rose out of the unconscious. He developedout of the Elijah figure. I called him Philemon. Philemon was a pagan andbrought with him an Egypto-Hellenistic atmosphere with a Gnostic coloration. Hisfigure first appeared to me in the following dream.There was a blue sky, like the sea, covered not by clouds but by flat brownclods of earth. It looked as if the clods were breaking apart and the blue waterof the sea were becoming visible between them. But the water was the blue sky.Suddenly there appeared from the right a winged being sailing across the sky. Isaw that it was an old man with the horns of a bull. He held a bunch of fourkeys, one of which he clutched as if he were about to open a lock. He had thewings of the kingfisher with its characteristic colors.Since I did not understand this dream-image, I painted it in order to impress itupon my memory. During the days when I was occupied with the painting, I foundin my garden, by the lake shore, a dead kingfisher! I was thunderstruck, forkingfishers are quite rare in the vicinity of Zurich and I have neversince found a dead one. The body was recently dead—at the most, two or threedays—and showed no external injuries.Philemon and other figures of my fantasies brought home to me the crucialinsight that there are things in the psyche which I do not produce, but whichproduce themselves and have their own life. Philemon represented a force whichwas not myself. In my fantasies I held conversations with him, and he saidthings which I had not consciously thought. For I observed clearly that it washe who spoke, not I. He said I treated thoughts as if I generated them myself,but in his view thoughts were like animals in the forest, or people in a room,or birds in the air, and added, \"If you should see people in a room, you wouldnot think that you had made those people, or that you were responsible forthem.\" It was he who taught me psychic objectivity, the reality of the psyche.Through him the distinction was clarified between myself and the object of mythought. He confronted me in an objective manner, and I understood that there issomething in me which can say things that I do not know and do not intend,things which may even be directed against me.Psychologically, Philemon represented superior insight. He was a mysteriousfigure to me. At times he seemed to me quite real, as if he were a livingpersonality. I went walking up and down the garden with him, and to me he waswhat the Indians call a guru.Whenever the outlines of a new personification appeared, I felt it almost as apersonal defeat. It meant: \"Here is something else you didn't know until now!\"Fear crept over me that the succession of such figures might be endless, that Imight lose myself in bottomless abysses of ignorance. My ego felt devalued—although the successes I had been having in worldly affairs might have reassuredme. In my darknesses (horridas nostrae mentis purga tenebras —\"cleanse thehorrible darknesses of our mind\"—the Aurora Consurgens says) I could have wishedfor nothing better than a real, live guru, someone possessing superior knowledgeand ability, who would have disentangled for me the involuntary creations of myimagination. This task was undertaken by the figure of Philemon, whom in thisrespect I had willy-nilly to recognize as my psychagogue. And the fact was thathe conveyed to me many an illuminating idea.More than fifteen years later a highly cultivated elderly Indian visited me, afriend of Gandhi's, and we talked about Indian education—in particular, aboutthe relationship between guru and chela. I hesitantly asked him whether he couldtell me anything about the person and character of his own guru, whereupon hereplied in a matter-of-fact tone, \"Oh yes, he was Shankaracharya.\"\"You don't mean the commentator on the Vedas who died centuries ago?\" I asked.\"Yes, I mean him,\" he said, to my amazement.\"Then you are referring to a spirit?\" I asked.\"Of course it was his spirit,\" he agreed.At that moment I thought of Philemon.\"There are ghostly gurus too,\" he added. \"Most people have living gurus. Butthere are always some who have a spirit for teacher.\"This information was both illuminating and reassuring to me. Evidently, then, Ihad not plummeted right out of the human world, but had only experienced thesort of thing that could happen to others who made similar efforts.Later, Philemon became relativized by the emergence of yet another figure, whomI called Ka. In ancient Egypt the \"king's ka\" was his earthly form, the embodiedsoul. In my fantasy the ka-soul came from below, out of the earth as if out of adeep shaft. I did a painting of him, showing him in his earth-bound form, as aherm with base of stone and upper part of bronze. High up in the paintingappears a kingfisher's wing, and between it and the head of Ka floats a round,glowing nebula of stars. Ka's expression has something demonic about it—onemight also say, Mephistophelian. In one hand he holds something like a coloredpagoda, or a reliquary, and in the other a stylus with which he is working onthe reliquary. He is saying, \"I am he who buries the gods in gold and gems.\"Philemon had a lame foot, but was a winged spirit, whereas Ka represented a kindof earth demon or metal demon. Philemon was the spiritual aspect, or \"meaning.\"Ka, on the other hand, was a spirit of nature like the Anthroparion of Greekalchemy—with which at the time I was still unfamiliar. Ka was he who madeeverything real, but who also obscured the halcyon spirit, Meaning, or replacedit by beauty, the \"eternal reflection.\"In time I was able to integrate both figures through the study of alchemy.Shortly before this experience I had written down a fantasy of my soul havingflown away from me. This was a significant event: the soul, the anima,establishes the relationship to the unconscious. In a certain sense this is alsoa relationship to the collectivity of the dead; for the unconscious correspondsto the mythic land of the dead, the land of the ancestors. If, therefore, onehas a fantasy of the soul vanishing, this means that it has withdrawn into theunconscious or into the land of the dead. There it produces a mysteriousanimation and gives visible form to the ancestral traces, the collectivecontents. Like a medium, it gives the dead a chance to manifest themselves.Therefore, soon after the disappearance of my soul the \"dead\" appeared to me,and the result was the Septem Sermones. This is an example of what is called\"loss of soul\"—a phenomenon encountered quite frequently among primitives.From that time on, the dead have become ever more distinct for me as the voicesof the Unanswered, Unresolved, and Unredeemed; for since the questions anddemands which my destiny required me to answer did not come to me from outside,they must have come from the inner world. These conversations with the deadformed a kind of prelude to what I had to communicate to the world about theunconscious: a kind of pattern of order and interpretation of its generalcontents.When I look back upon it all today and consider what happened to me during theperiod of my work on the fantasies, it seems as though a message had come to mewith overwhelming force. There were things in the images which concerned notonly myself but many others also. It was then that I ceased to belong to myselfalone, ceased to have the right to do so. From then on, my lifebelonged to the generality. The knowledge I was concerned with, or was seeking,still could not be found in the science of those days. I myself had to undergothe original experience, and, moreover, try to plant the results of myexperience in the soil of reality; otherwise they would have remained subjectiveassumptions without validity. It was then that I dedicated myself to service ofthe psyche. I loved it and hated it, but it was my greatest wealth. Mydelivering myself over to it, as it were, was the only way by which I couldendure my existence and live it as fully as possible.Today I can say that I have never lost touch with my initial experiences. All myworks, all my creative activity, has come from those initial fantasies anddreams which began in 1912, almost fifty years ago. Everything that Iaccomplished in later life was already contained in them, although at first onlyin the form of emotions and images.My science was the only way I had of extricating myself from that chaos.Otherwise the material would have trapped me in its thicket, strangled me likejungle creepers. I took great care to try to understand every single image,every item of my psychic inventory, and to classify them scientifically—so faras this was possible—and, above all, to realize them in actual life. That iswhat we usually neglect to do. We allow the images to rise up, and maybe wewonder about them, but that is all. We do not take the trouble to understandthem, let alone draw ethical conclusions from them. This stopping-short conjuresup the negative effects of the unconscious.It is equally a grave mistake to think that it is enough to gain someunderstanding of the images and that knowledge can here make a halt. Insightinto them must be converted into an ethical obligation. Not to do so is to fallprey to the power principle, and this produces dangerous effects which aredestructive not only to others but even to the knower. The images of theunconscious place a great responsibility upon a man. Failure to understand them,or a shirking of ethical responsibility, deprives him of his wholeness andimposes a painful frag-mentariness on his life.In the midst of this period when I was so preoccupied with the images of theunconscious, I came to the decision to withdraw from the university, where I hadlectured for eight years as Privatdozent (since 1905). My experience andexperiments with the unconscious had brought my intellectual activity to astandstill. After the completion of The Psychology of the Unconscious I foundmyself utterly incapable of reading a scientific book. This went on for threeyears. I felt I could no longer keep up with the world of the intellect, norwould I have been able to talk about what really preoccupied me. The materialbrought to light from the unconscious had, almost literally, struck me dumb. Icould neither understand it nor give it form. At the university I was in anexposed position, and felt that in order to go on giving courses there I wouldfirst have to find an entirely new and different orientation. It would be unfair,to continue teaching young students when my own intellectual situation wasnothing but a mass of doubts.I therefore felt that I was confronted with the choice of either continuing myacademic career, whose road lay smooth before me, or following the laws of myinner personality, of a higher reason, and forging ahead with this curious taskof mine, this experiment in confrontation with the unconscious. But until it wascompleted I could not appear before the public.Consciously, deliberately, then, I abandoned my academic career. For I felt thatsomething great was happening to me, and I put my trust in the thing which Ifelt to be more important sub specie aeternitatis . I knew that it would fill mylife, and for the sake of that goal I was ready to take any kind of risk.What, after all, did it matter whether or not I became a professor? Of course itbothered me to have to give this up; in many respects I regretted that I couldnot confine myself to generally understandable material. I even had moments whenI stormed against destiny. But emotions of this kind are transitory, and do notcount. The other thing, on the contrary, is important, and if we pay heed towhat the inner personality desires and says, the sting vanishes. That issomething I have experienced again and again, not only when I gave up myacademic career. Indeed, I had my first experiences of this sort as a child. Inmy youth I was hot-tempered; but whenever the emotion had reached its climax,suddenly it swung around and there followed a cosmic stillness. At such times Iwas remote from everything, and what had only a moment before excited me seemedto belong to a distant past.The consequence of my resolve, and my involvement with things which neither Inor anyone else could understand, was an extreme loneliness. I was going aboutladen with thoughts of which I could speak to no one: they would only have beenmisunderstood. I felt the gulf between the external world and the interior worldof images in its most painful form. I could not yet see that interaction of bothworlds which I now understand. I saw only an irreconcilable contradictionbetween \"inner\" and \"outer.\""},{"pageContent":"However, it was clear to me from the start that I could find contact with theouter world and with people only if I succeeded in showing—and this would demandthe most intensive effort—that the contents of psychic experience are real, andreal not only as my own personal experiences, but as collective experienceswhich others also have. Later I tried to demonstrate this in my scientific work,and I did all in my power to convey to my intimates a new way of seeing things.I knew that if I did not succeed, I would be condemned to absolute isolation.It was only toward the end of the First World War that I gradually began toemerge from the darkness. Two events contributed to this. The first was that Ibroke with the woman who was determined to convince me that my fantasies hadartistic value; the second and principal event was that I began to understandmandala drawings. This happened in 1918-19. I had painted the first mandala in1916 after writing the Septem Sermones; naturally I had not, then, understoodit. In 1918-19 I was in Chateau d'Oex as Commandant de la Region Anglaise desInternes de Guerre. While I was there I sketched every morning in a notebook asmall circular drawing, a mandala, which seemed to correspond to my innersituation at the time. With the help of these drawings I could observe mypsychic transformations from day to day. One day, for example, I received aletter from that esthetic lady in which she again stubbornly maintained that thefantasies arising from my unconscious had artistic value and should beconsidered art. The letter got on my nerves. It was far from stupid, andtherefore dangerously persuasive. The modern artist, after all, seeks to createart out of the unconscious. The utilitarianism and self-importance concealedbehind this thesis touched a doubt in myself, namely, my uncertainty as towhether the fantasies I was producing were really spontaneous and natural, andnot ultimately my own arbitrary inventions. I was by no means free from thebigotry and hubris of consciousness which wants to believe that any halfwaydecent inspiration is due to one's own merit, whereas inferior reactions comemerely by chance, or even derive from alien sources. Out of this irritation anddisharmony within myself there proceeded, the following day, a changed mandala:part of the periphery had burst open and the symmetry was destroyed.Only gradually did I discover what the mandala really is: \"Formation,Transformation, Eternal Mind's eternal recreation.'' And that is the self, thewholeness of the personality, which if all goes well is harmonious, but whichcannot tolerate self-deceptions.My mandalas were cryptograms concerning the state of the self which werepresented to me anew each day. In them I saw the self—that is, my wholebeing—actively at work. To be sure, at first I could only dimly understand them;but they seemed to me highly significant, and I guarded them like preciouspearls. I had the distinct feeling that they were something central, and in timeI acquired through them a living conception of the self. The self, I thought,was like the monad which I am, and which is my world. The mandala representsthis monad, and corresponds to the microcosmic nature of the psyche.I no longer know how many mandalas I drew at this time. There were a great many.While I was working on them, the question arose repeatedly: What is this processleading to? Where is its goal? From my own experience, I knew by now that Icould not presume to choose a goal which would seem trustworthy to me. It hadbeen proved to me that I had to abandon the idea of the superordinate positionof the ego. After all, I had been brought up short when I had attempted tomaintain it. I had wanted to go on with the scientific analysis of myths which Ihad begun in Wandlungen und Symbole. That was still my goal—but I must not thinkof that! I was being compelled to go through this process of the unconscious. Ihad to let myself be carried along by the current, without a notion of where itwould lead me. When I began drawing the mandalas, however, I saw thateverything, all the patois I had been following, all the steps I had taken, wereleading back to a single point—namely, to the mid-point. It became increasinglyplain to me that the mandala is the center. It is the exponent of all paths. Itis the path to the center, to individuation.During those years, between 1918 and 1920, I began to understand that the goalof psychic development is the self. There is no linear evolution; there is onlya circumambulation of the self. Uniform development exists, at most, only at thebeginning; later, everything points toward the center. This insight gave mestability, and gradually my inner peace returned. I knew that in finding themandala as an expression of the self I had attained what was for me theultimate. Perhaps someone else knows more, but not I.Some years later (in 1927) I obtained confirmation of my ideas about the centerand the self by way of a dream. I represented its essence in a mandala which Icalled \"Window on Eternity.\" The picture is reproduced in The Secret of theGolden Flower. A year later I painted a second picture, likewise a mandala, witha golden castle in the center. When it was finished, I asked myself, \"Why isthis so Chinese?\" I was impressed by the form and choice of colors, which seemedto me Chinese, although there was nothing outwardly Chinese about it. Yet thatwas how it affected me. It was a strange coincidence that shortly afterward Ireceived a letter from Richard Wilhelm enclosing the manuscript of aTaoist-alchemical treatise entitled The Secret of the Golden Flower, with arequest that I write a commentary on it. I devoured the manuscript at once, forthe text gave me undreamed-of confirmation of my ideas about the mandala and thecircumambulation of the center. That was the first event which broke through myisolation. I became aware of an affinity; I could establish ties with somethingand someone.In remembrance of this coincidence, this \"synchronicity,\" I wrote underneath thepicture which had made so Chinese an impression upon me: \"In 1928, when I waspainting this picture, showing the golden, well-fortified castle, RichardWilhelm in Frankfurt sent me the thousand-year-old Chinese text on the yellowcastle, the germ of the immortal body.\"This is the dream I mentioned earlier: I found myself in a dirty, sooty city. Itwas night, and winter, and dark, and raining. I was in Liverpool. With a numberof Swiss—say, half a dozen—I walked through the dark streets. I had the feelingthat there we were coming from the harbor, and that the real city was actuallyup above, on the cliffs. We climbed up there. It reminded me of Basel, where themarket is down below and then you go up through the Totengasschen (\"Alley of theDead\"), which leads to a plateau above and so to the Petersplatz and thePeterskirche. When we reached the plateau, we found a broad square dimlyilluminated by street lights, into which many streets converged. The variousquarters of the city were arranged radially around the square. In the center wasa round pool, and in the middle of it a small island. While everything roundabout was obscured by rain, fog, smoke, and dimly lit darkness, the littleisland blazed with sunlight. On it stood a single tree, a magnolia, in a showerof reddish blossoms. It was as though the tree stood in the sunlight and were atthe same time the source of light. My companions commented on the abominableweather, and obviously did not see the tree. They spoke of another Swiss who wasliving in Liverpool, and expressed surprise that he should have settled here. Iwas carried away by the beauty of the flowering tree and the sunlit island, andthought, \"I know very well why he has settled here.\" Then I awoke.On one detail of the dream I must add a supplementary comment: the individualquarters of the city were themselves arranged radially around a central point.This point formed a small open square illuminated by a larger street lamp, andconstituted a small replica of the island. I knew that the \"other Swiss\" livedin the vicinity of one of these secondary centers.This dream represented my situation at the time. I can still see thegrayish-yellow raincoats, glistening with the wetness of the rain. Everythingwas extremely unpleasant, black and opaque—just as I felt then. But I had had avisionof unearthly beauty, and that was why I was able to live at all. Liverpool isthe \"pool of life.\" The \"liver,\" according to an old view, is the seat oflife—that which \"makes to live.\"This dream brought with it a sense of finality. I saw that here the goal hadbeen revealed. One could not go beyond the center. The center is the goal, andeverything is directed toward that center. Through this dream I understood thatthe self is the principle and archetype of orientation and meaning. Therein liesits healing function. For me, this insight signified an approach to the centerand therefore to the goal. Out of it emerged a first inkling of my personalmyth.Without such a vision I might perhaps have lost my orientation and beencompelled to abandon my undertaking. But here the meaning had been made clear.When I parted from Freud, I knew that I was plunging into the unknown. BeyondFreud, after all, I knew nothing; but I had taken the step into darkness. Whenthat happens, and then such a dream comes, one feels it as an act of grace.Copyrights and AcknowledgmentsINTRODUCTORY UNIT The Hero's Journey: The World of Joseph Campbell2 The Inner Reaches of Outer Space: Myth as Metaphor and as Religion by JosephCampbell.
