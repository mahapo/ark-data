Although this term is u sed by the general public to describe a repulsion from the earth's gra vity, scientific people will know that antigravity would be the oppo site to gravity and would attract the earth's gravity instead of re pelling it. The Inverse-G-Vehicle, using the Searl Effect Generator , creates it's own gravity field. This field is like the earth's field and because of this the two like fields repel each other.

Searl's early days. John's mother, Violet Gertrude Maud Pearce, was bor n of poor parents on De- cember 22nd, 1911 at number 8 Bridge Cottages, Shaw Road, Newbury in the county of Berkshire. Little is known of the origin of his father Robert Henry Searl as no record of his birth can be found. It seems that Vio let and her parents had moved to a farm to work and that Robert had also moved in and worked on that farm. The farm was a poor one and the pay was so little and the co nditions so poor that they became ill. The local council had to rehouse them at the c ouncil houses, Hampstead Norrays, then in Berkshire. But Violet's father, William Ale xander Pearce then age 48, died from his illness which he had gotten from the farm job. This left Robert the only man in the house. Robert was serving in India when Violet and he were married by proxy on April 26th, 1930. He served in India for 2 years and rece ived 2000 rupees for bravery. Their son was born on May 2nd, 1932 at the Downs, Newbury Road, Wantage, then in the county of Berkshire, by the name of John Roy Robert Searl. John was born 1 month early and had black curly hair. The Downs at that t ime was a workhouse, a place of disgrace. It has since been torn down and it's beli eved that John was the last baby to be born there. Today the hospital part of the workh ouse is used for a stable for horses. Robert brought a very heavy shawl back from India t o wrap the baby in. One day John's mom and dad took him for a walk wrapped up i n this shawl. Somewhere along that road, John slipped unnoticed from that shawl, and did a head landing on the road surface. They had walked for over an hour before Vi olet checked to see why the baby was so quiet. John was nowhere to be found. She qui ckly retraced her steps and found John still in the road. After that John suffered fr om \"fits\" and Violet was told by the doctor that if they didn't stop in 2 years he would die. Their second child, Iris, was born at home on June 28th, 1934 while still at the council houses. The last child born to them was Pet er. He was born at 214 Newtown Road, Newbury in Berkshire. They then moved to 86 N orthbrook street, Newbury, Berkshire. Robert claimed that Peter was not his ch ild and one Friday evening he just never came home. After she was abandoned, she could not support the children. As a result, she left the children with her mother and w ent to work on a farm. Now it came to pass that the milkman seeing 4 days milk on the doorstep called the police who broke in and found the 3 children in a bad way. Vio let was sentenced to jail for 3 months for neglect. An order was granted for the cu stody of the 3 children at the Public Assistance Institution until such time as th e N.S.P.C.C. will apply for permis- sion before a Juvenile Court to provide them with p roper care and attention. An inves- tigation ensued and it was found that the children had been left alone and in filthy conditions often. Violet claimed that after her hus band abandoned her she just lost hope. A warrant was issued for Robert but he was ne ver found. An order was made that the children be placed in Dr . Barnardo's Homes until their 18th birthday. John, at the time was 4 years old, and soon lost contact with his brother and sister after that. He was put into fost er homes, and was frequently beaten in some of them. Page 2"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 One account as recalled by John: My foster mother w as very religious and belted my bum daily. Maybe she thought that was whe re the brains are kept. The only good thing that came out of it was my bum could hav e won a prize for being so well developed and firm. For special, she made you take a hot bath for 15 minutes, then made you stand up to have your bum changed from a s mooth surface to a red hot mass of blisters until there was no more room for anothe r blister. His childhood was not pleasant one. John had a series of dreams that started when he wa s 4 1/2 years old and ended when he was 10 years old. Something happened to ope ned his mind to the inspira- tional thinking that has followed him throughout hi s life. Perhaps it had something to do with his head injury as an infant. There have be en cases recorded where an aver- age person suddenly became a genius after sustainin g a blow to the head. This may have caused the person to use more of the previousl y unused portion of his brain. Or the information could have been given to John from an unknown source. Or perhaps John is just an independent free thinker who does n ot accept things at their face value. John has stated that the technology that he has developed goes way beyond his knowledge and learning and that he has been inspire d by some force to accomplish his task. He has used the dreams that were given to him to guide his way. When he comes to a point he cannot figure out he just goes to sle ep at night and by morning he has the answer. Everything in his life has directed him closer to h is goal of saving mankind through the use of his marvelous technology. Things never seemed to come easy though. John knew that his dreams had some special meaning. The dreams started at age four and a half, but he didn't start to interpret these until he was 14. He had two dreams twice a year for six years. His description follows : Dream 1: The mathematical aspect. \"I am playing a game of hop scotch...which of cours e is a set of eight squares...I find myself on square two, my pebble is on square three and I am in the act of going to hop over three into four, but I am instantly frozen wit h my right leg up in the air, and my left leg still firmly on the ground, via the foot o f course. KEY FACTS: 1....2 types of dreams, which are related. 2....There are always 8 squares. 3....I am always standing in square 2 and my feet a re always in the same position. 4....My pebble is always on square 3. 5....There are 4 dreams a year. 6....There are 6 years of dreams. In the first dream it is clear that I shall have so mething to do with very high energy levels of a solid structure, whose action is created by rotation. Because it is a solid structure it belongs to the third state of na ture. Page 3"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 Nature operates here on earth in three prime states , which are: 1....GASES 2....LIQUIDS 3....SOLIDS There is a 4th state in nature, but it is not avail able here on earth. 4....PLASMA Thus in the dream its a pebble, a solid object, and being in square 3, which declares it as being an object of the third state o f nature. Let's look at fact 1 and fact 3. There are 2 types of dreams, and I am always standi ng on square 2. Let us look again at my feet. The right is high to the left...transla tion...The right hand side is high in respect to the left hand side. It could mean that t he right side can be classed as 1 while the left side can be classed a 0. Therefore, nature can only operate in two states, it can only be high or low. In plain talk, nature is binar y in function, because I am about, or at least trying to hop over square 3, which is a fu nction. Why can I not cross over square 3? It is clear that the game has been operat ing quite normal, until this point is reached. To understand this point better, I will no w fill in a bit more detail about this dream. Up to this point, all the children who go to school with me are present and have been playing this game with me. But at this po int they all instantly vanish from my sight. Now, at the same instant an object appear s at the top end of the game, which should not be there, as it has no relationship to t he game. The object took the form of the village steam roller...that being, a large roll er being driven by a steam engine. Only in this case this object was many times larger than normal and is racing towards me. Therefore, I have only got a short time to save myself from being crushed to death. So, we can state the reason why I cannot cross thre e is the fact that it is making an absolute statement as follows: STOP, THINK, ACT You may think that it is myself which is going to b e crushed to death...in this case, you are wrong...re-cap again...at the instant in which I am frozen, all the chil- dren that I know have vanished...I am all alone. Th is means...that my generation will not produce any more generations of children to rep lace them...you automatically say that they have produced them...I agree with you, bu t they will never draw their old age pension, or their children. In other words my g eneration is the end of the road unless we STOP, THINK, AND ACT. In this troubled period I am all alone. Again in dr eam two I am all alone...WHY? Does this mean that I shall be the only person to b e given the knowledge on what must be done to save all life? Does this mean that life as a whole has little chance to survive unless we prepare for the coming onslaught? Does hi story hold any past facts of such events...the answer is a positive, YES! Well develo ped groups have appeared on earth and vanished without a trace as to where they went. All we can conclude is that they were wiped out completely by a natural event. What dream one seems to state, is that Page 4"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 the human race will be wiped out by a pressure forc e many times greater than nor- mal, crushing everything in its path, unless you ac t now to prevent it.\" There is much more explanation given in Prof. Searl 's books \"THE LAW OF THE SQUARES\". There are presently 5 in the series. These dreams came to a four and a half year old boy . I am amazed that they could be remembered and interpreted in the way that Prof. Searl has done. I can't remember dreams clearly from the night before many times, although I have had dreams that I can remember. Prof. Searl's dreams mu st have been vivid and clear. They appear to have been prophetic and made a lasti ng impression on his mind. The message of the dreams has unfolded throughout Searl 's life. Each experience he has had opens new doors through the better understandin g of the message of the dreams. John has told me that everything that has happened in his life has seemed to have a reason and everything seems to be guiding him towar ds his goal. His knowledge of THE LAW OF THE SQUARES has given him an understandi ng of the workings of nature and science. Not the accepted science of the universities, although he has edu- cated himself in many of them, but the science that is in harmony with nature. John works with nature instead of against it. John refus ed to accept things just because he was told that they were true. He had to see for him self. For this reason he has been at odds with \"respectable\" accepted beliefs taught by the establishment. Science has not always been correct in its assumptions or \"Laws\" bu t the scientists of the day always believed that their way was the only way to think. At one time scholars and scientists believed that the world was flat, then, that the ea rth was the center of the solar sys- tem, then, that there were only certain ways to gen erate power, accepted ways, etc.. For this reason he was labeled a trouble maker in h is youth and was labeled a \"quack\" by the scientific community when he tried to bring his technology to the world. He has been fighting the insecurity and irate self-righteo usness of the scientific and engi- neering community because he doesn't have the diplo mas and structured training and education that they have. He is not a member of the ir \"club\". John's education as described by him... \"My education is not good, agreed. I started at an infant school at Thorndon, where I learned absolutely nothing. Well that may b e a little bit of a lie...I did learn what it was like to get your bum spanked by the tea cher, which was much better than when my foster mother did it. Then I moved along to the secondary school at Eye. Here I again learned nothing, well except what the cane felt like in an effort to teach me not to take bombs apart and make fireworks out o f them. I actually learned more from what they were trying to tell me not to do the n what they were trying to tell me to do. Then I continued my education at Russell-Cot es Nautical school where I learned that all the things I had been taught were actually opposite and that the bum could be used for other things besides spanking. I received top marks for seamanship. From there I covered a range of work training from rewiring of electric motors to dispensing doctors prescriptions, to medical tra ining and nursing, including the caring for the elderly. Then onto electrical and el ectronic wiring and repairs, to the prototype wiring work for the atomic works and wiri ng of the VICTOR BOMBERS MK.11 and V.C.10's as a private contractor. To the wiring of the first fully transistor- Page 5"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 ized computer for the four large naval guns of NATO in Norway. I also covered the way to cut keys, fix locks, the building of T.V. and ra dio sets, and repair of them. I also covered everything about mechanical engineering fro m producing the machines from prints, to setup, to operating machines, to inspect ion of the finished product. This work also covered plating and treatment of various materials. Within this 40 years of practical experience, I undertook home courses on e lectronics 1,2,3 and 4 with B.I.E.E. plus 2 years on site training in radio communicatio ns at Reading University and 2 crash courses at the Open University, one of ROBOTI CS FOR INDUSTRY and the other DIGITAL COMPUTERS FOR INDUSTRY. I have undert aken a flying training course to a higher standard than is normally requir ed for private flying. I have experi- mented across a range of structures which the scien tific man rejects as not possible, and proved them wrong. Those structures came from t he LAW OF THE SQUARES. So to date, the best that I could achieve was a mer e honorary degree of PROFESSOR of MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES OF CREATION AND ENERGY. It's nothing much and not important...but at least it acknowledg es my life's time work in the study of life and energy to research and development...ma king me the creator of a new TECH- NOLOGY. The very first in this field of science. So I am sorry that I fail to meet your high standards of knowledge, but from my point of v iew, my knowledge serves all of my requirements to the fullest. I am pleased to sta te that I am learning something new every hour of my life. Agreed, that my knowledge has not arrived from theo ry taught in schools. But it has been achieved by hard work in the practical field. At least I do have a very high practical experience which is worth it's weight in gold. Something that one needs to support ones theory. This puts me in a far better p osition to present my thesis upon a natural prime mover. You people of theory have not been able to put forward any real theory for such a prime mover. Your own statements upon this matter are a disgrace to your education. You may be good at spelling, gra mmar and english, but you are no bloody good at witnessing demonstrations of somethi ng which fails to conform to your knowledge. I may not belong to your world of force to obtain r esults, and pollution, created through greed and destruction and hate. I belong to another world, which knows no hate, is not greedy, where all things in nature are appreciated and not destroyed. In your world you are causing nature to deteriorate an d your square frame is now well and truly over loaded, and will soon collapse. For nature cannot forever continue to support your frame at the expense of other frames. Everything in nature has its' rights, and man is taking away the rights of other frames. Man's superior knowledge over all other creatures tends to make him greedy, with no c are for other frames upon this earth, as long as he can make a quick buck, he does n't care. There is nothing wrong in superior knowledge, if applied sincerely and honest ly to better all mankind, including all creatures and plant life upon this planet. But alas, this is not the case. Far too often man's knowledge destroyed vast numbers of fra mes of other life forms, purely for gain or a kick. It appears to me, that educatio n creates the very opposite of its objectives. Instead of producing products which can appreciate all of nature, it pro- duces products for the destruction of nature. The o ne thing that man forgot is what I Page 6"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 have been telling him since 1946; man will destroy himself, through his own greed. So man will for certain reap the rewards he certainly deserves.\" John has said that he belongs to a world that knows no hate. He has observed organized religions and saw hypocrites. People goin g to church every Sunday, and forgetting everything that there religion teaches a s soon as they go out the front door of the church. John recalls a poem that he heard on ce as a very young child at the infants school... This poem represents his attitude toward life... Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase) Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace, And saw, within the moonlight in his room, Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom, An angel writing in a book of gold: Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold, And to the presence in the room he said, \"What writest thou?\" - The vision raised it's head, And with a look made of all sweet accord, Answered, \"The names of those who love the Lord.\" \"And is mine one?\" said Abou. \"Nay, not so.\" Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low, But cheerily still; and said, \"I pray thee, then, Write me as one that loves his fellow men.\" The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night It came again with a great wakening light, And showed the names whom love of God had blest, And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest. It is John's belief that he may very well be the on ly man in the world able to save all mankind, but that will be explained later in this book.

This is the basis for all the technology that has b een developed by Prof. Searl. This has come to him through his dreams and his study to int erpret them through the years. John has said in his lecture of 1986 in Munich, Ger many that the law of the squares is really a very old technology. He states that when t he Bible was edited by the church, that many books were not included. One man had writ ten 144 books of which only a few survived and those were omitted also because th ey were not understood or ac- cepted by the church of the time. These books conta ined information based on The Law of the Squares. The squares are a numerical representation of matte r and energy. There are three groups of squares and three only. They are: GROUP 1 - ROTATE - All odd numbers belong to this g roup. That means half of all numbers are a group one class. GROUP 2 - OSCILLATE -All even numbers that divide e xactly by 4. That means half of all even numbers belong to this group. GROUP 3 - OSCILLATE EXCEPT FOR THE CENTER CROSS WHI CH ROTATES - Half of all even numbers belong to this group. All even numbers that do not divide exactly by 4. There are numbers which nature does not use in its building blocks. These have been listed in \"THE LAW OF THE SQUARES- BOOK 1 \" The simplest GROUP 1 square that can be shown is a square 3. This consists of a block of three by three numbered squares. It is l evel 1 and includes 0 as its first number. The squares are shown in their original uni form layout and are numbered from top left down in columns from left to right (S ee Fig.l). If you add across any line of numbers you will get a random sum or output. This block of numbered squares can be arranged so t hat all the rows of num- bers, vertical, horizontal, and diagonal will add u p to the same number. This square is called a RANDOM square because the position of the numbers appear random but the output is uniform, where in the original UNIFORM sq uare the position of the num- bers are uniform but the output appears random. In a random square 3, level 1, the sum of any row is 12. 12 is the smallest number for a smooth operation of an electric current. This is shown in the linear motor which us es 12 phases for its drive unit. Since we never use 0 in our work we shall start thi s square and all subsequent squares with Level 2, which starts with the lowest number o f 1. All GROUP 1 squares have a single central square and they are made up of an od d number of squares. Thus they would be 3,5,7,9,11 etc.. If you take many of the s ame RANDOM squares and place them side by side you will see a pattern that conti nuously repeats itself throughout the matrix. GROUP 1's rotate.

The line value can be predetermined by adding the n umbers of the square up on the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right. 2. The center number of a GROUP 1 is equal to the line value divided by the square size. Therefore, the center number of a square 3 le vel 2 would be, 15 divided by 3 or 5. 3. Square 3 consists of 2 squares. The center single n umber being the first square and the next square out or 2nd square consisting of the 8 numbers that surround the center square. The total of the 2nd square can be o btained by multiplying the center square by 8, which is the number of numbers that su rrounds the center square. Thus, the total value of the 2nd square out is 40. 4. There are 8 different ways you can add different li nes to get the line value. They are 3 vertical, 3 horizontal and 2 diagonal. These are called options. Thus, square 3 has 8 options. 5. The total of all the squares in a square is equal t o the line value times the square number. Therefore square 3, level 2 total would be 15 times 3 or 45. Page 10"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 6. The four corner total is equal to the center squ are times 4. As the squares get larger there are additional rules involved but there are a lways numerical links between the parts of the square. With a little practice you can learn the pattern of numbers and then do all group 1 squares by yourself. Prof. Sear l has shown up to square 25 in book 2 of THE LAW OF THE SQUARES. He has figured the squ ares to over square 100. GROUP 2 SQUARES: 1 5 9 13 2 6 10 14 3 7 11 15 4 8 12 16 1 12 8 13 15 6 10 3 14 7 11 2 4 9 5 16 UNIFORM RANDOM Fig. 2 1. Group 2 squares are always even numbered squares, b ut not all even numbered squares are Group 2. Some are Group 3 squares. 2. Group 2 squares oscillate instead of rotating. 3. If you look at a Group 2 square in the Random state you will see that the numbers switch positions throughout the square. This switch ing shows the oscillation of the energy patterns within the square or between atoms. The square is a numerical repre- sentation of the interaction between different atom s within a structured mass. 4. There is a center block of 4 separate squares. This is called the kernel square. Notice that all Group 2 and Group 3 squares have a kernel square. John Searl's dream 1 states that when you are looking at a squar e, you are looking at 2 frames no matter what square you are looking at. (That square s are made from squares.) But the dream states more than that - it states that th ese 2 frames are at right angles to each other and held apart by 2 cross beams. So ther e are 2 prime states and a sec- ondary state. So 3 conditions are present in a squa re. Page 11"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 The three frames of all kernels are: 1....SPACE FRAME 2....TIME FRAME 3....ENERGY FRAME Let's look at the kernel square of a uniform square 4: 6 10 7 11 Now we examine the properties of this square: 1...VERTICAL- left 6+7=13 and right 10+11=21. Then subtract 13 from 21 to get a directional force of 8 to the left. 2...HORIZONTAL- top 6+10=16 and bottom 7+11=18. The n subtract 16 from 18 to get a directional force of 2 upwards. 3...DIAGONAL- top left to bottom right 6+11=17 and top right to bottom left 10+7=17. Then subtract 17 from 17 and get 0 showing that the square's energy is conserved. There is no gain or loss thus this kernel is in har mony. From dream 1 Searl states: \"We will have a lifting force of a value of 2 and a pushing or pulling force equal to the last value of the second column of the unifo rm square. We see that this holds true. We also see that the right hand vertical is m ore positive than the left hand vertical and the horizontal lower is more positive than their upper horizontal.\" In Prof. Searl's book lA he explains this in detail and also shows further switch- ing of numbers to increase the thrust and lift of t he square without changing the basic properties that keep the square in tune with nature . In John's words, \"If a building block conforms to a mathematical kernel and its ene rgy frame is conserved, and that kernel contains 4 different forces conforming to th e requirements above, then if a similar piece of material is placed upon that mater ial, it will experience a lifting force and a pushing/pulling force... For that is the LAW OF THE SQUARES. GROUP 3 SQUARES: This square has the properties of both the Group 1 and Group 2 squares as it both oscillates and rotates. There is a central cro ss which rotates in the Group 3 squares. The remaining squares oscillate. Group 3 squares ar e used to make flying machines as they put out a great amount of power. The central cross is made up of the 2 vertical cent er rows and the 2 horizontal center rows of the square. The first Group 3 square is a square 6. Page 12"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" Fig. 3 Group 3 squares are the most complicated squares to do and explain. As you study the square you will see that there is a rotat ing action of the center cross and the same oscillating action as a Group 2 in the remaini ng 4 corners. You will have to do a little work to see it, but be persistent, you can d o it. The Random squares shown here are not the only answ ers to correcting a square to the Random state. Here are a few squares for you to compare. SQUARE 4 LEVEL 2: Fig. 4 The squares can be solved in many ways but only one way works the best in the construction of an energy producing device. John Se arl developed his first SEARL EFFECT GENERATOR (SEG) back in 1946 at the age of 1 5.

These statements can be seen while studying the Law of the Squares. Some other interesting facts: There are TWO PRIME STATES within nature: ENERGY AND MATTER Energy and matter are reversible. Energy can switch to matter and matter can switch to energy. Nature operates upon TWO PRIME STATES: LOW ..... ......... 0........ NO ........ RED HIGH ...... 1 ........ YES....... GREEN This simple rule of Nature is used by us in many wa ys, but within Nature it's used all the time. Therefore, Nature tends to be BI NARY within its actions. Nature sometimes makes a triangle agreement with it s actions of functions: one input and two outputs or two inputs and one out put. In the first case it's an in- verted Y, it is not a mirror image. In the second c ase it is the original Y. We can see that Nature builds blocks which can be used either original, mirror or inverted. In matter there are THREE PRIME STATES, which are: GAS, LIQUID AND SOLID. Within solids we have three states which are Conductors, Semiconductors and Nonconductors. The elements are the building bl ocks of Nature. Here again we can break them down to Nonmetals, Light Metals and Heavy Metals. In designing, many points have to be accounted for. That applies to Searl as well, as he wants to work with Nature and not against Nature. All matter and all life conforms to THE LAW OF THE SQUARES. These are natures building blocks from the smallest particle to the largest universe. All energy exchange can be explained using this law. From chem ical bonding to the production of natural energy. \"Modern man\" has perverted the laws of nature and h as only limited knowl- edge of how nature works and how man can work with nature, rather than destroy its beauty and balance. Searl's Law of the Squares is the basis for an ener gy producing generator that works with nature and will not consume or harm any part of nature. Indeed it will help nature heal the earth from the damage that man kind has caused.

They are copies of origi- nal manuscripts made by Prof. Searl and have not be en changed or edited in any way. Through these books you will get to know the invent or as well as his technology. In Searl's words \"You have to know the inventor in ord er to understand the invention.\" This book could be termed as a primer to Searl's bo oks on the Law of the Squares as much of it has been taken from the original books. In his book 2 he has shown up to square 25 and give n the Go - No Go tables up to 8774. These tables and squares can be found nowh ere else. Many properties and symmetries are given throughout the books. When you see and understand these you will be able to work out the squares for yourself w ithout having to look at the books. The squares are the key to the SEG (Searl Effect Ge nerator). All the information needed can be taken from the sq uare used for the work. This includes all sizes and dimensions as well as a mounts of different elements used. The SEG is in perfect harmony with the squares and nature. It must be made cor- rectly and it will only operate as a completed unit . Someone once broke one of the magnetic rollers to see what it was made of. In doi ng so he ruined it and the operation of the Searl Effect. The SEG works because of the e xactness of ALL its components, in proportional content and dimensional size and exact frequencies used. These are all taken from the squares. Once completed, the SEG ope rates like a huge laser diode, a solid state device which starts at the atomic valan ce level and ends with an output of energy, both electric and magnetic, and in the flyi ng craft it is also gravitational energy.

John was placed in a foster home when he was still very young. He was a very curious boy and wanted to know how everything that he saw worked and was eager to learn and understand everything he could. I asked J ohn to describe his young days of work starting at age 14. Here is his telling of his early years. John Searl (J.S.) - I started in electrical rewindi ng of motors. Stripping motors and rewiring them. Winding coils. I was actually starti ng a five year apprenticeship. But weeks later I left that and went into pharmacy. Lea rning to dispense doctor's pre- scriptions. And that of course REALLY was a key. Be cause in the time I was in the electrical trade I found out how electrical motors worked. What caused them to work, how they were wired, how to wind the coils, how to insulate them and so on. So I picked up very quick a key thing but you see I coul dn't stay there. Because if I stayed there I'd be locked onto one narrow band. I had to go on to the medicine field to learn how chemicals are mixed together to produce certain results. And then from there I went on to medical training. All these changes occu rred within a short time frame. I was told by my boss at the chemist's shop that I was certainly qualified for something far better, having far more skills than w hat was required of me. He said he was holding me back. So he wrote a doctor to get me to see him, and he did. And he said, \"Yes, I'll put you on the ward for a months t rial,\" to see how I'd get on. So I went on the ward for a month and did so well that he put me in the lab for a month to see how I got along there. I did so well there that the y wanted to pay for six years training at Oxford University. And when I left there I would be a brain surgeon. But my guard- ian stepped in and stopped my training. They put me down to an old people's rest home. There was about 45 old age women, bedridden. And the job was to help the night nurse on nights. Of course I learned a lot. I learned about old age and what problems came along and started questioning these p roblems. Now while at the hospi- tal training, I learned a lot because I came in con tact with the brain, kidneys, liver, heart, unborn babies and more. So I questioned my i nstructors very strongly about things. In fact I wrote an essay and they downed it . And it turned out a few years ago that I was right! They were wrong. John Thomas (J.T.) - That was at the old age home? J.S.- Yes. Now I doctored myself. I went down with the flu, a bronchitis flu, and I went and wrote a prescription and got the medicine and g ot back. And one day the matron went into my room to see if I was keeping it clean and tidy and saw this bottle of medicine and saw what it was. She came to me and as ked how did I get it. I said, \"I got it.\" She said, \"You have no right to any medicine u nless my doctor here says you can have it. This is poison and you shouldn't have it.\" So they called up the Homes, which were my guardians. They came running down and took me to the chemist's shop. The chemist got the prescription out. He said, \"The pre scription is right. Absolutely cor- Page 17"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 rect. I dished it out as stated and there was nothi ng wrong with the prescription and therefore as far as I'm concerned he was the author ized person to pick it up and I gave it to him. So I have not committed any crime.\" So they whipped me off to London. I got fed up with sitting about so I went to the cinema to see a film. I was so impressed with i t because I had just seen a film for the first time. I wanted to know how motion was don e on film. So I went to the man- ager and asked him how do you do this? So he said, \"Would you like to see how it's done?\" So he took me up to the projection room and got the chief projectionist to show me about. And when he opened the arc lamp door he s aid, \"You see the thin rod, carbon rod, and the thick one. The thick one is pos itive and the thin one is negative. And you see that the positive one has got a hole, a crater and the negative has got a point.\" He said, \"The power comes from the positive and goes to the negative.\" And I said, \"You're wrong. It goes from negative to posit ive.\" He said, \"No, I've been in the theater a long time. It goes from positive to negat ive.\" So I said, \"If it goes from posi- tive to negative as you've said and not from negati ve to positive, how do you explain the crater in the positive? You've got a crater the re because something is hitting it hard. It is knocking the stuff out. And it has a po int on the other end because stuff is leaving it from the outside to the inside and it sp lits away.\" So when the boss saw how I was tearing his top man to pieces, and I'm only a kid, he asked me if I wanted a job! So I was given a job right away. But within a couple of months a new law came out th at people under 16 couldn't be in a cinema where X films are being shown. So th at meant that he couldn't employ me on those weeks when they were shown. So he said to me that there was a cinema at Illford which was S class. They have two floor l evels operating and they only show an X film on one floor. So when they show an X film they can always send you up to the next floor. It's got the latest equipment and that should really fascinate you. Of course when I got there, the chap in charge, the chief projectionist, was also a ham operator! He felt sad for me because I was ju st an orphan. So he took me home and introduced me to his family and showed me all h is ham equipment and told me about the things you have to do to become a ham ope rator, and he started teaching me. We got on very well and things started changing. Th ey had a party at the cinema and wanted me to join them after the show to celebrate. And so I asked the Homes permis- sion to stay late. They said, \"You have to be back by 11.\" and well, we had hardly started the party after the show. So what happened was I stayed overnight. I went to sleep on one of the big couches in the lounge. And some of the usherettes slept on the couch as well. The couches were massive. You could get 4 or 5 of us on one of them. And they just threw curtains over us to keep us warm. A nd of course when I got back the next day they went mad, The Homes did. Stopped me f rom working there and things started going all wrong. But as I look back on it today, I can see the pictu re now, when I look back. I was getting into a permanent fix and I musn't. I need a lot of experience across a wide field to do what I've got to do. I not only had to know w hat happened to people, I want to understand how they work, how they function, why th is, why that. About materials, how you can do, what you can do, what part of mater ials will do this and how it func- tions. Page 18"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 So by the time I was about 30 I really knew everyth ing about the atom. What you could do with it and what you can't do with it. I began to realize that a certain law applied. And that law was the SQUARES. These square s define everything. What you can and cannot do in nature. J.T.- It sounds like you've had quite an experience John. J.S.- Oh I had to go through a lot. I even had to t ake up flying. I hit a problem there when we were getting going. Every pilot that came t o answer my advertisement (to test fly the Levity Disc), when they came to see th e model tested, they said, \"Oh, I wouldn't take that up! It turns too fast. Too sharp ! You'll get killed!\" So the question was no financier would back a project which wouldn' t get off the ground. So I had to do something about it. I had to licence myself for fly ing. So that I could fly it. The trouble was it had to be more than just a private licence. So I had to buckle down and really get up to a commercial standard so that I'd be able to test fly it myself. And that's what I did. I hammered it, and hammered it and got the s tandard required. J.T.- You never did get to test fly it though did y ou? J.S.- No, We got the land ready to build a three se ater and then the check promised was stopped by the Prime Minister of New Zealand. I t was in the paper. We have the paper cutting. \"John will have to find his money el sewhere. The prime minister has stopped the check and told the people to invest the money in marsh gas.\" J.T.- Oh well. J.S.- So the check didn't come. So we had to forget it. We did work hard. We got every- thing ready to go ahead. We had to move trees. We h ad to move debris. We had to level the ground off for the building of this three manne d craft. As far as I was concerned, we brought in heavy tackle equipment from miles awa y and it cost quite a packet to get it in and do the job and get it back again. But we couldn't build it. That was the trouble. It was a sad thing. But of course I always get kicked in the pants about it. Everybody said, 'You said you were going to build t his three manned craft and you didn't!\" J.T.- Well what are you going to do without money? J.S.- The point is that they don't look at it in th e proper light. They said, \"You said you were going to do this.\" I said that I'd do it if we had the money. If I'd had the money, I wouldn't have been asking for the money. But the th ing is, today, things are moving slow. But I find that if I try to push people, I lo se everything. They stop because they can't keep up with the pace. And I sit back here fi ddling with my fingers, but annoyed about it myself. I'm annoyed that I'm not racing as I was years back. And time's run- ning out. Page 19"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 John had many jobs and experiences as you can see, and what does he mean by \"Time's running out\"? This will be explained later in the book. I was curious as to when he first started building his first SEARL EFFE CT GENERATOR. In his books he had this technology since 1946. So I asked him t o tell about his first units. This is his reply. J.T.- You said that you were just 15 years old when you made your first SEG? J.S.- Yes, well when we say the first one, it's an object which shot off the table when we started it up. It bashed up against the wall. The s parks flew everywhere, but that was the beginning. I destroyed the house with it eventu ally. When we tried to make them a little bit bigger, it just shot through the ceili ng! The ceiling came all down and it tore through the roof which fell in. We had to move beca use there was so much damage that the house was unfit to live in! J.T.- That must have made a big hit with everybody! J.S.- Yes! It did! Well there were a little later o nes, much bigger, we put up and they got shot at by an RAF (Royal Air Force) chap that s aid I was frightening his pigeons. J.T.- Oh, really! He shot at it? J.S.-Yes! He shot at ME!! J.T.- Oh no. J.S.- Yeah, there were bullet holes in the building . A bullet shot past me. J.T.- That was kinda scary! J.S.-Yes. Oh, we had plenty of fun. I should write everything down that happened. It's shocking that I'm still alive today. J.T.- What building were you living in then? J.S.- We had a shed. The old man who took me in was dying of cancer. The hospital gave him about 6 to 8 weeks to live, so he begged t o go home. So they brought him home and his wife thought it would be nice to have a lodger to help out. And back then I was lucky enough to want an accommodation. I arrived in the area so they took me in. And when I told him about the things I had in my mind, he said \"John if you can make peo ple look up in the sky, that would be a great achievement because everyone who w alks around here, walks with their head down, looking at the ground,\" Well I sai d, \" That should be no problem.\" But I said that I would need a shed and materials. He called his son up and said, \"George, take John down to the market and get every thing he wants.\" And things Page 20"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 really got going and we started building 6 footers and 8 footers and 12 footers. But then we really got down to the job of discovering t hat there was no way of stopping these things from going up! Of course we eventually did learn, but my word, it took some effort! J.T.- So you went down to buy all this stuff. You b ought all the chemicals? J.S.- Yes, he paid for everything. J.T.- So the first one that actually took off, that actually left the ground, was a mag- netic motor. J.S.- Yes. They were all magnetic motors. The troub le was, they weren't intended to fly! That was the bug! J.T.- Yes, I imagine that was quite a surprise!! J.S.- Yes that was a surprise package. There were g ood people who were so excited by it, they paid for more to be done. And slowly we br oke out the problems step by step. If it hadn't been for those good people, well I would have had to give up then because I couldn't afford to carry on - throwing money up in the sky and losing it. I asked John to describe what happened when the fir st units went airborne. FIRST UNITS THAT WENT AIRBORNE J.S.- Well you can't control the little things at a ll. All that happens is that once they get the speed up to get to the superconductor stage , it lifts. And it lifts to a given height. It's hard to determine just how high that i s. It's higher than the buildings around and higher than the trees that were around t here. And then there's what we call a \"rest section\", where they seem to rest. And then suddenly they get very bright. The glow gets brighter and brighter and brighter. I t's obviously getting very supercon- ductive. There is an immense plasma building up all around it. Then electrical appli- ances switch on. Televisions and radios turn on by themselves. This happens all around as the power leaks down cables and aerials and thin gs like that. And suddenly it shoots off. It just goes off, up and up and up, unt il it's lost. You can't see the light glow or anything anymore. So we have to assume that they have gone right out into space. J.T.- And that will go automatically with no load c oils or anything. J.S.- Yes, it will just go on and on until it balan ces out with the forces of the planet. And then it will orbit. So we don't know where the bits have gone to. Someday, who knows, somebody may find them! J.T.- That would be quite a find! Page 21"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 J.S.- Yes, Well of course after we'd done six of th em, the old boy who paid the bills died. So work literally stopped for awhile. So then I for med a party of old retired people who had money, and we started looking at the problem of building the body. Working on the body shape, trying to work out ideas on how we could control this. And then we did. We were successful in the end, because a lot o f things happened while I was experimenting. I found out how it cools an iron dow n which was red hot, and it would turn icy cold. So we learned bit by bit, by shear e xperimentation, chance you could say. Then again most of the big experiments were just ch ances that the inventor hit upon. They were probably looking for something different! And then hit on this and said, \"Oh, that's interesting!\" And then developed it. An d that is really what sort of hap- pened in my case. It was just shear luck that while you were trying something, some- thing else happened. And that gradually let you bui ld up the picture of what was going on! Once we understood what was going on, then it was e asier to try to put together a structure that would allow you to make use of it. I agree, at the time, we could not see how to use it as a domestic power plant. We cou ld see it as a flying machine. And that is what we worked on. But once we mastered the holding of it and we could hold it at low heights and keep it there stationary agai nst all winds. Then you see I was winning! But the thing was, we couldn't stop the mo tor! We were never able to stop that until I was lecturi ng in Canada. And it was on the TV program that I was doing, that the camera ca me forward, and for the first time ever, the rollers stopped. And I was quite embarras sed. And yet it was the greatest miracle of the lot. Because when they pulled back t o show my face, the thing started off again. And then I knew instantly what I had to do. The frequency of the camera was the key to stopping it. Page 22"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 FIRST MAGNETS MADE J.T.- When you made your first magnets, how did you press them? J.S.- Well we were very lucky. It was a big built u p industrial area. There had been ammunition and tanks and bombs and shells. So for p ressing we were lucky because the pressing was not like they do it today but how they used to do it in my young days. So there was everything basically available. All we had to do was find a magnetizer that we required. And that is what the Electric Boa rd had. A magnetizer standing idle. J.T.- Wow, you're kidding! J.S.-And I asked if we could have the head modified . And they said, \"You can take it if you want it!\" But I said, \"I got nowhere to put it! \" But I said, \"If you can keep it in the back shed there and I can have the right of using i t, that would be ideal!\" So that's what happened. They hadn't heard from me for about 8 years, so they got rid of it. J.T.- Oh dear. J.S.- When I eventually went and dropped in on them a few years ago, they told me, \"I'm sorry, we did try to find you to ask you if yo u wanted it, you could take it. But as we couldn't find you we in the end had to dump it.\" J.T.- Oh...And that's the one you had modified with the A.C. windings? J.S.- Yes, yes. Because what we do is not what magn etizing companies want. We do something entirely different and it's a different s urface that we're magnetizing com- pared to what is commonly magnetized. J.T.- What did you use to press the magnets? J.S.- We had hydraulic presses. Hand presses. And p ressed them. We had no trouble in getting it right. Like in our present work. I as ked John to explain what the action was in an SEG. His answer follows: J.S.- There are lots of ways of making mechanical e ffects to demonstrate. In one of the films we have here we show a very simple way which shows a ball running along the wave trough, to and fro. All that's happening is th ere are bars just going up and down. You're converting a vertical motion into a rolling result. You're making a ball roll freely by the action. And it was things like this, when I was 14, that made me realize that the whole thing about free energy is right the re! All the planets work on it and will always work on it. It's simply building up lin es of force and sitting in it. And as the forces move, so you're propelled along at right ang les to the action. And you're made to Page 23"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 spin. The force is forcing you to spin. And if this force is slightly out of unity, the more it's out, the faster you'll go. The greater the sli p the faster you'll move. And when I realized this, I had looked at lots of t hings in industry. The single phased motor, the three phased motor, and then how you come to work a walky-talky of the second world war. That fascinated me. But wh en I saw that we are dealing with phases and frequency...these are key things. It was n't so important...the magnetic thing. It was important to get this frequency and p hases right. And there must be a slip to cause motion to take place. What is happening in my case is the axis of the rol ler rotates. So the roller rotates in itself. In its own right and then it rot ates around the plate because the force of the plate is acting on the rollers force. There' s a slip. And high energy builds up from that slip and makes it move. And because there is no point of balance on that surface it will continue forever as a straight line . When you use a straight bar system, you do have two ends of the bar and that presents a little bit of a problem. But even that, I solved. The roller would jump to the end which is a permanent monopole, D.C., yet it jum ped across that without any signs that there was anything there! And then carried on along the other side and jumped through the bottom end and back. On another occasion John described the workings of the SEG (SEARL EFFECT GENERATOR)...his reply follows: J.S.- Well what you've got is all north on one side and all south on the other, but the south one is off course, it's out of step with the north so they lay diagonal across the bar. So you've got a wave. When the roller operates , you've got a north pole lining up with a south pole but the south pole is not lining up the north pole. It's between 2 south poles. J.T.- So its twisted. J.S.- Yes. The field is twisted. The field on the r ollers is twisted. You've got 2 fields at right angles to each other and because there's a sl ip between these 2 fields a force is generated on the roller so the roller moves. No inp ut is needed to cause rotation. And because you've got magnetic flux available in rotat ion, that means you have a moving flux field. And if you've got a winding you must ha ve electricity. You've got no other choice. J.T.-I was under the miss-impression that your firs t unit was some sort of segmented disc. J.S.- Ya, I don't know who started that rumor but w hat they really mean by that is that the rollers are running around and they appear just like a segmented disc. That is, it is not a whole ring rotating, they're roller s. It's like a ring cut up in sections. J.T.- So the rollers go around the outside of the p late? Page 24"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 J.S.- Yes. You have 3 plates as we call them. You h ave 3 solid rings with rollers in between on the outside of them running around. So t hat means you've got an inner ring with the inner section of rollers running arou nd. The second ring we call the solid ring or the second plate or the middle plate and it s run of rollers and then the third plate with the third set of rollers. You could go o n and on but the cost is not worth it. Now what happens is each ring's set of rollers run at two and half times the speed of the one proceeding. So the middle ring rotates two and half times faster than the inner ring and the outer one is two and half times faster than the middle one. Your kinetic energy is building up, your potential energ y is building up and this is the only engine I know in the world where the potential ener gy and the kinetic energy goes up together. The kinetic energy takes the potential en ergy up fast and brings the poten- tial energy up to an immense level. Page 25"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 DESCRIPTION OF SEG PLATES AND ROLLERS J.T.- Now I was looking at in the old newsletters. It said that in the flying craft only the inner ring was stationary. J.S.- No, either that was printed wrong by the chap who wrote it or he misunderstood. All three plates are stationary. They are part of t he structure. There are two actions in the generator, no matter what generator it is that you make, whether it's gas, electric or whatever it is. You've got to have one fixed par t which can be the field, or the rotor, and a moving magnetic field. Or you can have a stat ionary magnetic field and you can have a rotary conductor. J.T.- Yes, it didn't make any sense to have the pla tes moving. J.S.- Yes, you see they become part of the solid st ructure, the craft. And the rollers have to be shorter to allow free movement. And this is what we've always shown in our demonstrations of the plate and rollers. The roller is shorter by about a quarter of an inch at the ends. So it has complete freedom. It do esn't run off. It doesn't jump off. It just runs along that beam. J.T.- And on the flying craft they have to be small er as you get toward the rim. J.S.- Yes, you make them smaller but you make them thicker. So you've still got the same mass. They are larger in diameter and shorter. But not in a generator. In a generator you keep them all the same size. J.T.- Oh, I see. So you have to refigure your dimen sions because your rollers are going to be fatter. J.S.-Yes, you see as you go outwards you've got to have more mass. So you go up in the level of the square. You've got to go up in any cas e. Even in a domestic power unit you've got to go up for each ring, you've got no ch oice. With the disc, as you go out- wards the height becomes less. Now that's when you' re building a small model, un- manned. When you come on to something big, like Sta rship Ezekiel they would be all the same size, because you've got the space. Why we had to go thicker on the outer ones on the unmanned models is because there wasn't the space. We had to maintain the right weight, the correct weight. It had to be kept there. J.T.-And you had to maintain your seven degree angl e too. (The acute angle at the rim of the craft) J.S.-Yes. So you have to look at that point. People don't think about those things when you're talking to them. They don't think about what is involved. They think, \"Oh that must be simple.\", and there are a lot of problems t hat have to be solved. Page 26"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 SEG IS A PRIME MOVER J.T.- Now you mentioned somewhere in the newsletter s that the SEG is first of all a Prime Mover. J.S.- The prime mover is really the actual generato r itself. The prime mover is the thing that actually does the work. And then you hav e the generator. Now the prime mover is the thing that has got to move to produce electricity. The SEG is a prime mover, not a generator. The generation comes about thru its action. So you don't have a generator separate. It's all housed in. You can't have generation unless you've got the mover. The trouble with all forms of generation is you have got to have a prime mover. It can be a water wheel, a wind mill, an ele ctric motor or any other type of device. Something consuming energy to produce the m otion, to cause the generator to produce power. That is the basic law in physics and science for producing power. J.T.- So the SEG is actually the prime mover. J.S.- The SEG is purely the prime mover but is also the generator. You see it's very difficult to explain the SEG in writing because the y are brought up with the fact that in order to generate power, you've got two precise units. Now the SEG has two precise sections. A stationary plate and a moving plate. Bu t the moving is self-induced, so it is a prime mover. It is moved by the surrounding atmos pheric conditions, the magnetic fields. And that's the bit that no one can understa nd. Nobody can understand why rollers run when you haven't got them coupled up to something to make it run. And I can assure you that scientists, well known men, hav e been sitting there watching it and literally pulling the hair out of their head! T rying to find an explanation. And to explain the explanation to people, they say it acce lerates. And I can assure you John, they never accelerate. And you can prove it if you had a long enough bar and mark off every foot and put time clocks to start instantly w hen the rollers moved, you will see that it took just the same amount of time to get to the first clock as the second clock and the third clock. J.T.- No matter how much load is on it? J.S.- No, it makes no difference. Because the tempe rature changes. J.T.- Oh, I thought the rollers sped up. J.S.- Well they do when you go to fantastic power, but the average person turning on a hght doesn't alter it, only the temperature alters. But if you stuck on an electric cooker with all the plates going and an electric motor, an d then you'll find that she starts to speed up, but she instantly goes to the new speed l evel. The clocks will still show that it has done each step in the same time but in proba bly half the time it was doing it before it had the massive load put on it.

J.S.- What it is, is it's a PRIME MOVER of electron s. You are doing it by the nuclear field being set up in such a way that the forces re acting between themselves is causing a displacement in one direction and giving energy a nd force to passing the electrons. It's quite a simple thing but everyone seems to mis s it. People forget that magnetism turns the whole universe around. It directs all the forces. In an SEG it is a special way that the poles lay up due to the reactions from the nucleus of the elements that causes it to operate. It is that print that makes the roll ers run. The atomic forces have to be lined up correctly and you can only do that from th e squares. When you lay the rollers on the surface, when you l et go of it, it immediately shoots forward. If the print is right it continues on forever. It is an oscillating field. And the rotating field is created when the roller r evolves around its axis as it rotates around the plate. You make a reduction in the size of the atoms as yo u come outwards. The rea- son is you are compressing the electrons passing th rough. You are forcing them to accelerate faster. You are compacting more electron s in a space at the end and this means that when they arrive on the first roller, th e electrons made available to it has multiplied immensely. Then it shoots these onto the next plate so the next plate has an abundance of electrons to give away. These are a ccelerated and built up, then com- press even harder. By the time they get to the next roller they're many times greater in energy level. By the time they get to your third roller, before they're thrown onto your coils, you have terrific energy. That's a smal l engine to do the job of a bigger petrol or diesel engine as a domestic power unit. Y ou've got a small box doing the same job.

We used to call them Levity Discs, but now that we are absolutely certain that gravity inverses we have changed the name. Actually what is happening is the engine has become a super conductor and therefore it is repuls ing the earth. So that's why we call it Inverse. There's so much power from these things . Because, you see, they're so cold when they start over running. That was the problem. I didn't realize that if you design something for a certain level of power, if you exce ed that level the temperature drops. The higher you exceed that power level the colder i t gets. At last it gets so cold it inverses and it lifts. But the trouble is, it lifts with such force that it ruins your ceiling. J.T.- YES! I'm surprised it gets colder rather than hotter. J.S.- Yes, it gets colder and colder, the more powe r you take from it. So, for flying, what we simply do is make an engine that when running id le, as we term it, we're not flying, it's just under overload. There's a load on it just enough to hold it from shooting down in temperature. As soon as we start-up we put a bigger load on and down goes the temperature, the gravity inverses and it lifts. On the flying machine you have got to take it into overload to go airborne. So you see we load the power unit so it is running just under overload when it's on the ground . J.T.- Is that what the load cell is for? J.S.- Well the idea of the load cells is to pass a heavy current thru the elements, top or bottom. And thru the center point, out. So you're d elivering very highly accelerated electrons out. Very highly negative out into the at mosphere. Well when you get a good heavy stream of them, the atmosphere is forced to b end back. So you are producing a bow wave around the craft. And the atmosphere is be ing forced to bend away from the vehicle. And it's the same for any object coming to ward it. The bow wave is forcing it to bend away. J.T.- So do you vary the resistance on the load cel ls? J.S.- Oh yes. You set up the resistance in the cell to depend on how sharp of a rate of change you want. J.T.- But the electron flow is all coming from the SEG and going to atmosphere right? J.S.- Yes, All you're doing is you are causing a co ndition to occur above or below the vehicle and all the time around the vehicle to main tain it at a steady or constant level.

J.S.- That's the first thing we do, but at the same instant you have a plunger that strikes the roller just passing. And that causes th e gyro effects to take place. J.T.- You'd think it would damage the roller. J.S.- No, it doesn't. It's rubber. But the fact tha t it just hits it, because it's in motion at right angles to the impact, it doesn't damage it.

And what we found was that a ll measurements that were showing on the graph, it was a tri-pen recorder, sh owed that the biggest stress on the craft was when it was idle on the ground.

A theory to cover force fields of all types should attribute a fundamental cause to interaction of matter at a distance whether the interaction be gravitational, mag- netic, nucleonic or electrostatic. Present theories include interchange of virtual pho- tons or mesons, and multidimensional distortion of the space-time continuum. What- ever the argument, it will depend basically on the concept of a medium to support the wave motion, flux or distortion. The medium is spac e and the properties of it have never been seriously investigated, neither practica lly nor theoretically, that is except- ing the possibility that it has been overlooked. Th e accepted idea is that space is empty, a place with the absence of matter, devoid of tangi bility. This is taught to our children as being a primary contention, and is in fact wrong and negative thinking. We do not understand it so we turn our backs to it. Physical investigation of \"space\" is impossible, fo r the experimental technique demands use of apparatus which is made of matter wh ich in turn occupies space. One of the fundamentals of the experimental method is that the materials and principles under investigation cannot be included i n the apparatus. This was but one failure of the Michelson-Morley experiment. In its original form, this experiment was set up to test for ether drag due to the passage of the earth through the medium, but has been assumed to have been an experiment to actually test for the existence of an ether. Failure of the experiment to give a positive result made it possible to interpret the negative result as favoring the nonexistence of the ether as Oliver Lodge imagined it. The then-develop- ing materialist philosophies took the opportunity t o discredit the pseudo-scientific reli- gious cult of spiritualism, in which the idea of sp iritualism, in which the idea of an \"etheric existence\" was an important part of the philosophy. As it happened, the two etherics need not have had any connection except in the choice of words. The ether theory was dropped and the spiritualist cult subdued. Today, the Miche lson-Morely experiment has been modi- fied to show Doppler interference between coherent wave trains. One wave travels against, and the other with the direction of rotation of the whole apparatus. Results are in favor of the theory of relativity, but can also be interpret ed in favor of \"ether drag\" within the stationary medium about the apparatus. Page 33"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 A vacuum transmits radiation and force fields, so t o refer to it as being empty is inaccurate. Real emptiness must include in its defi nition reference to its inability to propagate energy. Such may be better termed \"hypers pace\". As to whether hyperspace has the dimensions of space and time or not is a to pic for more thought. It is easier to attribute the dimensions to the space fabric in hyp erspace, the ether. The idea of an energy continuum throughout space oc curred to Dirac. On the basis of his theory, matter particles emerge from a ground state and become physi- cally Observable. Material above the ground state h as a higher energy than the ground state and so requires energy to be dislodged. The e nergy corresponds to the total en- ergy of the particle, its mass energy (mc 2 ) and other potential or kinetic energies. The theory, then, supposes that matter is of the substa nce of the ground state, that is, \"empty space\". In comparison, the Lodge theory supp oses that the ether has a maxi- mum of energy, and matter particles are a lower ene rgy precipitate from the ether. The same idea, but a difference of sign. However, t his implies that the appearance of matter is a preferred state, and that the creative process is a naturally occurring condition. Heisenberg, in formulating the \"unified field theor y\", assumed a space fabric of some nature. To quote from the Lindau Conference, 2 8th June 1962, \"The discovery shows that the different elementary particles are n ot Nature's building bricks, com- pletely independent of each other, but many differe nt forms of a fundamental sub- stance manifest as energy\". From then on, the \"fund amental substance\" is forgotten. \"The multiplicity of these forms corresponds to the multiplicity of the mathematical symmetries of the basic equation\". Sir Oliver Lodge imagined the space fabric as havin g a microcellular structure, each cell being a vortex whose size was of the orde r of the size of the fundamental particles, or even smaller. The medium was friction less and the rotational velocity of the vortices related to the velocity of light. The intrinsic energy of the ether was in the motion in the vortices. This attributed an ultimate energy source to space itself. Lodge also imagined that the ether had an enormous inerti a and density. The inertia in mass was due to the ether in it, and solidarity of matte r was virtual. A similar idea occurred to Karl Schappeller of Cast le Aurolzmunster in Inviertel, Austria (died 1947). According to his philosophy, a change in the space fabric (static potential) gave rise to so-called primary magnetism which may be interpreted as a type of autogravitation. This primary magnetism cau sed a gathering of the surround- ing space fabric and from it issued more fundamenta l energy as an intensification of the primary magnetism. At a certain stage, the syst em reached an equilibrium gath- ering space fabric, and from it precipitated energy . When the energy density reached a required level, matter would be produced. The sys tem would take up a spherical form in the \"natural\" state and become what Schappe ller called \"glowing magnetism\". Glowing magnetism, he claimed, constituted the core of all planets and suns, the gravi- tational core of which was due to the glowing magne tism at its core. How this theory fits the universal law of gravitation is at first d ifficult to see. We must remember that the universal law of gravitat ion is base don Kepler's Laws, which were derived from astronomical observat ions of the planets. The masses of these bodies can only be determined from their g ravitational interaction, not from Page 34"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 their inertial properties. Hence for cosmic bodies the term m in the derived formula is not necessarily related to the inertial mass of these bodies, but the gravity of them. Gravity cannot be proved to be due to the mass content of these bodies by astronomical observation only. Further, n o convincing experiments have been conducted to prove that static inert matter ha s any gravitational field. Experi- ments, like that of Airies, which use the earth as a mass, are questionable on the basis that the gravity may be due to the earth's field al one. Boys' and Cavendish's experi- ments showed only that masses in relative motion ha ve a force between them, since in both experiments the masses were in torsional vibra tion suspended by a beam. The force could be attributed to an inductive or relati vistic effect between the charged particles constituting the masses. Hoyle, from his work on quasars, has deduced that v ast cosmic masses could undergo gravitational collapse leading to a singula rity and that the converse was pos- sible. A singularity could explode into a creation field. This is much the same idea as that of Schappeller, though on the basis of his the ory the creation process is much less dramatic. Hoyle's creation field arises from nothin g, whereas that of Schappeller, glow- ing magnetism, arises from the space fabric. Which is the more plausible? Physical evidence for the existence of glowing magn etism may be available. The source of energy in comets has long been a prob lem. How a comet can give off so much radiant energy and continually dissipate its m atter in the tail, yet despite its apparent lack of substance survives to return after many years, is difficult to explain in terms of conventional science. The usual explana tion is, of course, the energy is reradiated sun's energy. Who has proved it? The exi stence of \"ball lightening\" has now been accepted but as yet eluded explanation, except that attempts have been made without the usual mathematical substantiation. The peculiar anti-gravitational ef- fect, the inductive effects and the fantastic energ y of ball lightning fits neatly in with Schappeller's theory of glowing magnetism. The glow ing ball of polarized space fabric is precipitated by enormous static fields or high c urrent pulses in thunder storms. At a center of glowing magnetism, the space fabric is modified and the energy condensate comes off as magnetic fields and radiati on. The consumed fabric is re- placed by an influx of the surrounding space. Matte r particles in the surrounding space would experience a force towards the center. This would be a gravitational field. Lodge imagined that the ether would be near incompr essible with a very high elastic- ity. A small inhomogeneity would give rise to a rel atively big effect. Also the ether flux would be at the velocity of light and bunched in mu ch the same way as magnetic fields bunch at high intensity. Thus the maximum velocity of a matter particle would be that of the velocity of light and the approach to t hat velocity, an exponential. Can the theory then explain cosmic gravitation? If so, ther e must always be a magnetic effect associated with it. The name \"glowing magnetism\" implies that Schappell er considered this to be of prime importance. In fact, he maintained that th e magnetic field produced by a glowing core was different from the familiar type o f field in that it was a dynamic field, not static. This is consistent for an energy source with indefinite energy could produce a continually expanding flux. Such a dynami c flux would be capable of induc- Page 35"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 ing a D.C. in conductors. As a secondary effect, th e currents would produce a static magnetic field of the usual type. A cord of a cosmi c body then would produce dynomagnetism which would be absorbed by matter to produce a magnetic field. This field would have to be a function of the gravity of the theory is any good. As it happen, a reference to related work can be fo und. Prof. P.M.S. Brackett, quoting from the works of Schuster, Sutherland and H.A. Wilson, showed that the magnetic moment P and angular momentum U of the ear th and sun are related by the equation: where P = 1 c is the velocity of light and G the universal grav itation constant. The relationship holds for Bohr magnetrons, and support for it appea rs in DeBroglie's equations for mass waves. It is interesting to note that the form ula also includes rotational motion. Particularly, the equation relates angular momentum , magnetic field and gravity. Angular momentum is known to be related to gyroscop ic restoring couples. Although gyroscopic action can be dealt with mathematically, no physical explanation exists for it. In view of the fact that a vector is required a long the axis of rotation, might this not suggest that rotating matter generates a field alon g this axis? As yet, it can only be postulated that the field couples the gyro in a fix ed orientation in the space fabric. This direction sensitivity suggests isotropic quali ties of the space fabric. Lodge imag- ined that this might be so. Magnetism at one time was regarded as separate from electricity until the elec- tromagnetic effect was discovered. Then the problem was: \"Is electricity a form of magnetism or is magnetism a form of electricity?\" E instein showed, however, that magnetism was a relativistic effect due to the move ment of charge, thereby identify- ing magnetism as being a form of electricity. From thence sprung the concept of elec- tron spin which fit a good theory to explain perman ent magnetism. Much work is being done on spin resonance which further supports the theory. However, the discov- ery of magnetic monopoles indicates the possible ex istence of magnetism without charge and that magnetic lines of force need not be contin uous. This raises questions as to the exactness of the Theory of Relativity and Electroma gnetic theory in their present form. Schappeller regarded magnetism as more fundamental than electric current, and that current was flowing magnetism in the condu ctor. The field of influence sur- rounding a wire was an externalization of the flux within the wire. The field, there- fore, must be regarded as flowing parallel to the \" current\" in the conductor. The math- ematical treatment of such a configuration leads to the same practical results as the conventional idea of magnetic flux as being perpend icular to the current flow. The actual nature of current and magnetism, being one a nd the same, may be visualized as large scale flux interspaced between the Lodge m icrovorticies. Such a flux must result from the breakup of the microvorticies and t herefore will appear as a form of energy potential. Conventional magnetic field may b e regarded a form of potential energy. Page 36"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 If we accept that magnetism is more fundamental, th en a consistent explana- tion must be found for static potential, induced E. M.F. and electrochemical potential. A conductor forced through a magnetic field interac ts with the macroflux of the ether ahead of it and absorbs the flux in a direction dep ending on the direction of the macroflux. This constitutes the current in the cond uctor. The flowing magnetism in the conductor reconstitutes the macroflux behind it , the energy being derived from that which forces the conductor. If the conductor i s open circuit, an E.M.F. is set up. This is like electrostatic potential, in that it is static magnetism, the polarity depend- ing on an excess of ether at the point at higher po tential compared with that at lower potential. Since the ether tends towards uniformity , then an ether flow will occur under suitable conditions to relieve the strain. Th is constitutes flowing magnetism which is current. The flow in the conductor affects the surrounding ether, giving up some energy to it, creating macrovortices, which is a magnetic field. An electrochemical E.M.F. is an expression of the e nergy available from an exo- thermic reaction but in a potential form. When curr ent flows, the reaction takes place and the potential chemical energy is dissipated. Sc happeller regarded chemical bonds as a static form of magnetism in the same way that static electricity could be regarded as immobile magnetism. Matter particles being an et her precipitate cause permanent density irregularities in the ether. Chemical bondi ng or particle bonding lowers the stressed condition of the ether releasing the retai ned ether, or static magnetism, as some form of ether disturbance. This could be ether waves (radiation), macrovortices (magnetic field) or flowing magnetism (current), wh ich are all forms of energy. Looking back over the theory, it is seen that in gl owing magnetism the space fabric is destroyed as microvorticies and the resul tant residual flux appears as large scale flow patterns in magnetic fields or macrovort ices. If this primary magnetism reaches high values, the flux interferes with the s urrounding space fabric to produce matter particles, so being partially reabsorbed. Ra diation can only be produced by matter particles, so that once matter has formed, e nergy may leave the creation field as radiation from the particles which are stimulate d by the magnetism. The primary magnetic field of the Schappeller glowi ng core is different in a very fundamental way from the usual type of field. In a perfect conductor, if the E.M.F. is maintained, the current increases and hence the magnetic field. That is, as long as energy is supplied to the system the field expands. In a resistance, the energy is dissi- pated as heat and the field is constant. In the Sch appeller primary field, the flux is continually supplied as the energy is created, and therefore the field continually ex- pands. This is dynomagnetism and an ordinary magnet ometer is insensitive to the field. A conductor in the field will have an induce d current and thereby produce a detectable static field. The instrument to detect a dynomagnetic field must consist of a loop conductor with a magnetometer at its center. If, as Schappeller states, the earth has glowing ma gnetism as its core, then it should produce dynomagnetism. Most of this would be absorbed in the material of the planet and produce the static field. If any of the dynomagnetic field did penetrate the surface, it would be difficult to detect against th e background of atmospheric distur- bance and static field. In his early experiments, R iech did detect and accumulate en- ergy from the earth which was other than natural ra diation. A core of glowing magne- Page 37"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 tism would be and would have been in the process of producing matter. The earth would have been expanding from the center since it first formed. This was the best explanation for \"continental drift\", but a reason f or the expanding earth could not be found. Geographers would welcome the idea, for the land masses have been shown to fit neatly together on a sphere of about half the s ize of the earth. The creation fields or glowing magnetic cores at th e center of cosmic bodies must somehow originate. Schappeller's argument as t o the origin is more difficult to follow, because of terminology, than the rest of th e theory. It seems, however, that when a sun becomes large enough to form a crust, th e very process of doing so causes a focusing of the various fields which starts up a new flowing core making the center of the new sun. The old sun has its supply of ether cut down and the glowing core is subdued but not snuffed out. It becomes a planet of the new sun with an apparent reduce mass due to the drop of gravity and reduced size as it initially cools and con- tracts. The core of the planet is not yet finished, for it continues until the crust be- comes very thick and finally cuts off the ether sup ply. Then the core does die and the planet loses its gravity. Only molecular forces rem ain to hold the planet material to- gether and if the internal pressure is high the pla net can explode. This clashed with the conventional ideas, but thoug ht out in detail equally ex- plains observation. It does go one better in that i t adequately explains some facts not covered by the conventional theory, the asteroids, for example. Other than providing a fundamental explanation for the organized universe, Schappeller went as far as to design a device using and converting the fundamental substance into useful energy. It was designed to pr oduce a glowing magnetic core in a vacuum which then is self-sustaining. Basically it consists of a pair of coils wound on to a hollow ceramic form, shaped spherically and co ntained in an iron sphere. The coils are of copper tubing packed with a permanent electret material. This constitutes the dynomagnetic generator. To convert the energy i nto mechanical energy, a rotor is used, also made from copper tube packed with electr et. The sphere functions only after the electret material is polarized. Because of the terminology in the Schappeller theor y, to is naturally difficult to follow, that is, apart from the strangeness of the concepts. After several readings, one might conclude that \"glowing magnetism\", or ether p recipitation, starts if the electric and/or the magnetic fields reach enormous values at a given point. It seems that this is the function of the stator device outlined above . The arrangement of the fields must be such that a reduction in the density of the ethe r occurs instantaneously. An imme- diate influx of ether occurs which continues under its own inertia. The resultant com- pression then causes the production of energy which appears as (radiation and) mag- netism. By this process it would seem that an oscil latory state is set up. This may be so and the frequency related to the size of the glo wing core. One might expect some sort of longitudinal ether wave to be set up which would be entirely different to the transverse waves of electromagnetic radiation. The wave would cause variations in the ether density which would mean that matter woul d tend to occupy regions of maximum density in the wave and that the velocity o f light would vary slightly be- tween maxima and minima. Page 38"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 In the case of the earth, the Van Allen belts could be taken as an indication of such gravity waves, and for the sun, the obvious fa ct that the planets occupy orbits that are harmonically related. In both cases a stan ding wave is indicated. It might be worthwhile research to look for variations in the v elocity of light in the Van Allen belts. Lodge deals with the problem of inertia by attribut ing the property to the ether itself. Matter, he claims, has no inertia as such, but acquires an induction as it moves though the space fabric, or more correctly, the spa ce fabric moves through it. The induction constitutes a change of energy seen as ki netic energy, and the state of mo- tion lasts as long as the induction lasts. The theo ry also asserts that the ether itself has an enormous inertia and is in a preferred state of rest. Small movements give rise to big effects, for example as in gravitational fie lds. However, small movement does not mean slow movement. The idea that the cellular vortices circulate at the speed of light might be extended to larger fluxes. The concl usion to this is that matter acceler- ated by force fields cannot exceed the speed of lig ht and the approach to it would be exponential. APPLICATION OF THEORY The ultra high potential produced by the Searl ring generator being so much greater than the ionization potential of the air, c auses ionic breakdown of the air at some feet from the craft skin, as this acts as the positive electrode. The negative side of the generator is connected to the periphery of t he disc, and isolated from the skin. The field at the negative terminal is therefore ver y much greater and the air is ionized at a greater distance at the rim. The air at the po sitive terminal loses electrons and the resulting ions are repelled from the terminal w ith high acceleration. The electrons pass through the generator, constituting the curren t in the generator, and provide the charge at the negative terminal to produce negative ions in the air near the rim. The craft therefore is enveloped in a vacuum. In ordinary high voltage generators the maximum pot ential is limited by the ionized breakdown of the air. Flashover occurs and accumulated energy lost. The ge- ometry and the arrangement of the field coils in th e Searl generator is such that flash- over is eliminated until the thing is in a vacuum a nd then is impossible. Energy is required to build up the potential and in itially has to be supplied from an external source. As the vacuum layer increa ses about the craft, less energy is required to maintain the potential. The generator s oon reaches a potential when the Searl Effect takes place and the device produces it s own energy along with the levity phenomenon. On the basis of the theory, at this pot ential the stress on the space fabric cannot be equalized by flowing magnetism (current f low) through the air and craft as a circuit. The space fabric breaks down to provide the magnetism to relieve the stress, but the energy by-product is absorbed by the genera tor which reinforces the field. The generator then must set up an ether flux along the lines of the electric field as is conventionally represen ted. The direction of ether flow is, however, in at the positive and out at the negative . This is deduced from the Schappeller theory. The generator and craft therefore produce t heir own gravitation type field. Page 39"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 The net effect of the craft field plus the earth's gravitation field gives rise to a condi- tion where the ether density below the craft is hig her than that above it. The craft therefore is strongly repelled from the planet. And to stop it from shooting off into space the field of the craft must be intentionally perturbed. In the drive condition, the field is as shown in fig. 4 and the craft is shot o ut of the earth's field like a wet orange pip from between the fingers. The acceleration is e normous, but since all matter asso- ciated with the craft is linked with the field no d istortion of any part, including pas- sengers if any, occurs. The limit to the speed is u nknown but since the craft has no inertia there is possibly no limit. It would be saf e to say, however, that the limit is below the speed of light. Above this speed too much is unknown to take the risk, but since the craft carries its own space with it the t heory of relativity is inapplicable. In fact, the craft does not travel through space but p ast it. It can be seen from the gravity field diagram that a neutral zone appears below the craft as well as the neutral ring above, when t he levity drive is on. If matter becomes located in the zone, then it is held there. In consequence, the Searl craft so far made have left their mark on the countryside in the form of large, neat holes when they suddenly take off. The chunk of earth is taken up with it. The gravity field within the body of the craft is s uch that the center is up and the rim down. If the generator is allowed to \"run u p\", because the polarity is opposite to that of the Schappeller machine, the field is ex pansive and pulls the craft apart. Prior to this, glowing magnetism could start, chara cterized by an orange-yellow glow, but could not become self-sustaining, being expansi ve. The Searl generator runs at low speeds and is unlikely to fly apart by centrifu gal force. Apart from this, the side effect electromagnetic forces help to keep it toget her. As with other gravity fields, the flux favors passage through matter and so the field within the craft may be tailored by appropriately distributing the mass in the craft. T his is of particular convenience in manned craft where the comfort of crew may be impro ved by making the cabin field about one half G. The external field, when the craft is travelling in free space, would resemble that of the combined earth and craft, since it woul d be moving relative to a stationary ether. Collision between the craft and large object s in space is very unlikely except in direct line of flight when such could be seen and t he craft rapidly turned. The field is such that the objects are diverted past the craft, or it past the object. If the object qualifies as a planet or moon having its own gravit y due to a glowing core, then the craft oriented by the interaction of fields is stro ngly repelled away unless measures are taken to alter the field of the craft. Small ob jects such as meteorites are pushed out by the combined electric and dynomagnetic field s. An object entering such a pow- erful static field is at first attracted, then ioni zed and then strongly repelled. The dynomagnetic field induces a magnostatic (ordinary magnetic) field in objects which will interact with the craft magnostatic field at c onsiderable distance (miles) and re- pel it. It should be pointed out that only a very small amo unt of space fabric passes through the craft and an even smaller amount is con verted for energy. However, as previously mentioned, small changes in the ether le ad to large physical effects. Page 40"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 Even in deep space the craft has an electronic flow through the generator which is continuous along the electric field outside the craft. Electrons are picked up and some leave the rim at relativistic velocities. Thes e do not contribute to the drive. So the craft also carries its own negative space charg e. In an atmosphere the electronic flow is much greater, and the generator current muc h higher. The craft therefore func- tions a lot better and has greater flexibility in s pace. In air, the recombination of ions gives rise to a pink to blue glow around the craft and in damp conditions the ions in the air can give rise to condensation. This effect coupled with the output of electrical energy could well precipitate thunderstorms. The only hazard so far observed is that if the craf t hovers for too long low near the ground the soil becomes burnt due to the electr ic currents in it which build up heat. Also the nervous systems of animals are inter fered with by ionizing discharge if they get too near.

DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE SEG I asked John if there were demonstrations of his gene rator. His reply is as follows: We showed all sorts of things. You must have read a n article by Bill Sherwood where he said he saw a demonstration of circular ma gnets that rotated. And as soon as you brought the bar in to close the system they started rotating. There was no input. They were running on there own. J.T.-Are these the rollers that ran completely arou nd the bar? J.S.- They run round yes. They run right around the bar, up one side and right around the corner and down the other side. Gunner Sandberg remarked that he'd never seen rollers run along a bar, turn round the end and dow n the other side and up the other end and around passing thru two right angles at the end without loosing speed. And although the bars have definite magnetic poles at e ach end to hold the roller, you can pick the rollers up on the end of the bar and shake it and they don't come off. Why do Page 43"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 they just pass by and go around and up the other si de past that end and don't stop? They don't stop but they should because you can pic k the rollers up with the bar and shake it and they don't come off. So there are defi nite poles but they're both the same. Each end is the same pole. He remarked on this that it was really hair raising. Now we had a lot of letters from scientists that wrote to other scientists telling them about the demonstration. And they have never seen rollers that simply pass thru two right angles so close together without slowing down or st opping. Page 44"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 THE SEARL EFFECT You see, the Searl effect is only to make the rolle rs rotate. Because until they rotate no energy will move. You've got no moving fl ux. What is happening is you're cutting your lines of conductors by magnetic flux t hat you do in any other generator. There's nothing different there. But the only diffe rence we are doing is we are at the same time inserting electrons into the windings. Wh ereby in normal conventional engines you push them away. You don't insert anythi ng. Therefore every time you switch off a switch you lose an electron or two. Th e light loses an electron or two. In this case every time you switch on or off you're pu tting more electrons into the system. We're putting electrons into the system instead of taking them away. So you're build- ing up the system. We're doing the opposite actuall y to what they do. Of course we're not like other manufacturing companies. It means le ss bulbs will be sold, less cable will be sold, less switches will be sold. But, the way I look at it is this- If people have free energy, then they'll buy things to use on it. If energy gets dearer and dearer each year, less goods are bought to use on it.

How did you ever do that? J.S.- Well the first thing was, I was lucky. I work ed for the Midlands Electricity Board in 1949 and we had all the equipment. Everything wa s there. What it was, the chaps were laughing at me. And when you're in charge of e leven areas, the bosses don't like their bosses being laughed at and mocked. So they s aid to me, \"Well you have three options. First, shut-up. Second, do it, or third, b ugger off.\" I didn't like the idea of buggering off. I didn't like the idea of shutting-u p. Because I somehow knew I was right. And I didn't see why I should shut-up if I w as confident that I was right. They said, \"You got all the equipment here, you just tel l us what you want in material. We'll get it. All you need to do is pay us the bare costs of the material.\" J.T.- Boy, you were lucky there! J.S.-I was lucky. I was placed there by chance. Jus t chance I got that job. What hap- pened was, the landlord I moved in with, he had an old radiogram and it wasn't work- ing. Now I asked him why he didn't use it. He said, \"It doesn't work\". I said, \"Haven't you taken it for repairs?\" He said, \"Yes but it wou ld be cheaper to buy a new one.\" I said, \"Well, do you mind if I look at it then?\" \"No \", he said, \"Go on!\" Well I opened it up and saw what the problem was. And I went down to th e parts shop and got a replace- ment part. It cost me two and six of my own money. Brought it back, plugged it in, switched on. Beautiful. Sound blasted out there so I said to him, \"What's wrong with it?\" He was shocked! It was only two and six pence. So he wrote the Electric Board and said he had a chap lodging with him who seemed very fascinated in electronics. Would they give him an opportunity? Offer him an intervie w. And I got it during an interview and they asked me a lot of questions and were quite satisfied and I moved straight into an upper position job! No bother! J.T.- Boy! Talk about fortunate! J.S.- Yes!

Page 50"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 BASED ON NEWSLETTER DATED JUNE 1,1968 Corrected for accuracy of information. By 1952 the first generator had been constructed. I t was tested in the open by Searl and a friend. The armature was set in motion by a small diesel generator to induce a starting field. The device produced the ex pected electrical power, but at an unexpectedly high potential. At relatively low arma ture speeds a potential of the or- der of 10 to the fifth power volts was produced, as indicated by the static effects on nearby objects. Characteristic crackling and the sm ell of ozone supported the conclu- sion. The really unexpected then occurred. The generator lifted while still speeding up, broke the connection between itself and the gen erator, and rose to a height of some 50 ft. Here it stayed for a while, still speeding u p, and surrounded itself in a pink halo. This indicated ionization of the air at a much redu ced pressure: 10 to the minus three mm Hg. More interesting was the side effect causing local radio receivers to go on of their own accord. This could have been due to ioniz ing discharge from the generator, or electromagnetic induction. Finally, the whole ge nerator accelerated at a fantastic rate and is thought to have gone off into space. Since that day Searl and others have made some tens of small flying craft, some of which have been similarly lost, and developed a form of control. Larger crafts have also been built, some 12 feet and two 30 feet in di ameter. The antics of his machines have given rise to much speculation as to the nature and origin of so-called \"flying saucers.\" One wonde rs why Searl has not come to the notice of scientists and to the public at large. Th e fact is that he has, but, for fear of being ridiculed, people keep the knowledge or inter est to themselves. The public has been educated to scoff at the subject of flying sau cers, and the reported behavior of things that cannot be explained by current scientif ic theory. Such \"difficult to explain\" topics must be given the \"no comment\" treatment, so as not to upset the uncertain structure of present science theory. THE EFFECT: Any theory must explain the various phenomena, some of which have been observed by Searl himself and some by the general p ublic. Associated with the Searl Effect craft are the following: 1) Antigravity or levity. 2) Very high voltage electrical fields. Page 51"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 3) The peculiar magnetic effect. The generator produces a high density electric fiel d with negative polarity at the rim, and positive at the center. There is also a magnetic field which surrounds the craft, and extends out from it. 4) Perpetual motion. Once the machine has passed a certain threshold of potential, the energy out- put exceeds the input. From then on the energy outp ut is virtually limitless. Searl explains this by stating that the machine collects electrons from the space around it. The estimated power output of the generator is some 10 to the 14th power watts. 5) Inertia loss. Above threshold potential, which must be some 10 to the 13th power volts, the generator and attached parts become inertia-free. T his of course goes against accepted concepts of inertia in mass. 6) Drive. By altering the distribution of potential on the su rface of the craft, it is possible to propel it. The preferred direction of travel at ultra high speeds is away from the planet, the plane of the generator being at 90 degr ees to the gravity field. 7) Ionization of the air. This is from the discharge of electrons from the ge nerator. It gives rise to a translucent glow surrounding the craft and glowing trails. The intensity of the field is such that it is capable of excluding the ionized ai r creating a near vacuum around the craft. 8) Matter snatch during acceleration. This occurs when the craft is on the ground and the drive is ground with it, leaving the well-known hole in the ground.

That's all. It's a very small unit. What you must bear in mind that plate one and plate two with their rollers are actually the prime mover. The ring three and its ro llers is the energy producer. So you still got your two stages as you do in normal and c onventional engines, the prime mover then the electric producer. In this case we j ust compressed it and it's still there. You've got the prime mover and you got the energy p roducer. Page 53"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 FLYING DISCS I asked John what causes the discs to fly. J.S.- Temperature drop gets the whole thing going. The unit becomes a superconduc- tor. It's this arrangement which causes the atomic pattern within the matrix to set up in such a manner that the electrons are caused to m ove forward. The slower they go down in the main matrix itself the more power can p ass through. But the force of the separate nucleus causes that force to accelerate to the magnetic field. There's a revolving magnetic field out there. So if you've got a space vehicle, a big craft out there, then the gravity field of the earth must produce the same type of energy as the craft because it's acting just the sa me as the SEG. You are using the gravitational energy of the earth to continue the p ower of the SEG. Everything is linked to one another. Therefore, the craft is very simple to control in outer space for space travel, because you're tapping in on the fiel ds, the gravity fields, of the different planets and this supplies the energy effect on the craft. The generator itself is a re- ceiver. When you leave the earth, the earth is your prime force and your destination is your secondary force. And eventually your secondary force becomes your prime force and the earth becomes your secondary force. The skin of the craft is like giant aerials. The ma gnetic field around the rim of the craft causes the skin of the craft to act like two receiving aerials and act like a magnetic lens to focus on planets. So you've always got something in front of you to be focused on and you always have something behind to be focused on to hold you true. It's a big electrical magnetic lens. On the model at ground level you have a vacuum arou nd the vehicle. The earth pushes. The pressure of the earth itself. The elect rical magnetic field of the earth pushes the vehicle away from it. To stop the model from flying off the earth you have to apply pressure down to balance the forces. The p lanets become a force on you. You've got to consider your craft and everything wi thin it a separate world. The earth is much greater so it is acting on it. But it is ac ting in the reverse. It has a repulsing action. It pushes it away. We are a separate planet as our identity. So we have a force like the earth. Because they are two equal, they ar e pushed apart. J.T.- When you're inside the craft you don't feel t he acceleration do you? J.S.- No, you don't feel a thing. You are at zero o n everything so you rely on your instruments to tell you what's going on outside. Th ere have never been any manned flights because the vehicles were unpressurized and the SEG creates a vacuum. All models were controlled by radio control devices.

J.S.- When we use to start up, we use to introduce a power. But then you see, we found out after, that you didn't need to do this. It was how we had magnetized them that was causing the need of a starting source. Of course an other thing that we discovered in those days is you burned a big ring around it on th e ground. And it tended to pull the earth up. Any earth that wasn't heavy and solid, it simply pulled up and carried up with the craft. J.T.- So what did you do? Put voltage on the outer ring to get the rollers started? J.S.- Yes. Because the field wasn't true. The field didn't come out quite true, you see, and the result was that they couldn't get moving on their own. But we were trying to solve the burning of the ground. What we arrived at was, the forces were focusing at that point where the ring was made. What we needed to do was try to offset the field so the field didn't focus down to the ground. And b y changing the coils around and experimenting, we came up with the change required. But now at the same time, we now had a slip between the fields. And that slip in troduced a force which set the rollers moving on their own! J.T.- Oh, I see. So by changing the frequency by ju st a little bit, you created the slip. J.S.- Yes. Remember, when we started out, there was no information of any kind on this that you could obtain, and everyone said you w ere nuts! J.T.-I see, so what you did was induce a field into the outer coils in order to get the rollers going and once they got going the unit woul d take over on its own. J.S.- Once they really got going it was alright. Th ey produce enough source of their own to carry on. J.T.-I couldn't understand what this little diesel engine was for. It must have been a little diesel generator. Page 56"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 J.S.- Yes. Alittle diesel generator to induce a mag netic field. But that was because the field, the force, instead of being used to push the rollers were actually focusing to the ground and damaging the ground. But when we toy'd a nd experimented to try to cor- rect that, we did ourselves a good favor! Because w e put the poles sufficiently out of line, to create a big slip that would force the rol lers to rotate completely on their own! When we made a new unit we just changed the fields, the magnetizing fields, so that we produced a different arrangement. But the t rouble in those days,...people weren't really interested. They thought you were nu ts. So they just made the things to humor you. But they never carried out any tests wit h the equipment there to verify what was happening. What happened was, we were working completely blind and we weren't given the encouragement that aught to have been given. Th ey said, \"Alright we'll do this to humor him, to shut him up.\" Instead of carrying out some experiments to find out what the field was like. They weren't interested. T hey just made the parts and that's it. And so it wasn't until we just recently did the first experiment...and we struck lucky. I did get everything right and the segment c ame out and for the first time we saw the field. We could take the measurements and l ook at the field. And I was quite surprised at what we had.

The beginni ng of a real Space Business. As you see in the photo, this is a pleasant looking craft in structural shape. It is 10 ft. in diameter. One can see the cumulus clouds and, (as recorded in the very care- fully documented report in my files, along with oth er photo shots of this craft taken from different angles and heights,) a force of 8 is blowing. She holds and handles beyond all that had been hoped, from past work. She exceeds all our dreams. She climbs, holds at a touch, and moves not an inch aga inst the wind. There is no sound. People around rush to hide from us as if we were so me kind of aliens from another world. Yes, they are watching us behind trees and h edges, but none will come near us. They are not trusting us. We are wide open to be se en, yet every one who drops in on us is very quickly in a hurry to get away. It looks quite comical from our viewpoint, watching their reactions.

One minute to go now. I am still sweating heavily b ut my knees are shaking quite heavily with a new fear: what if the craft pulls ou t of the climb before it's clear above the power cables?

All our team with cameras are doing the same as fas t as we can shoot and turn the film. Yes, the craft will clear the power lines with no trouble. I have now stopped taking photos to record what I saw as I looked thro ugh the view finder. I saw the ground appeared to be rocking, yet I could not sens e any such rocking. The pylon behind the craft seems to be flying apart outwards and upwards. I shot my glance over the far side where the two strangers were. What hap pened to them? To me they looked like two poles stuck in the ground, but in fact the y were running for cover in the direction from which they had come,—most likely sca red stiff. Then the call came in: \"She's crossing Cornwall now. Time 1503 hrs. G.M.T. \" We all relaxed except my heart which just would not stop that mad thumping. Our team in Cornwall turned the craft for its run b ack. We went over to the launch point and found that all the small undergrowth had been pulled up with the soil and had left a scooped-out effect where the craft had s tood. There was burnt ring around, and the undergrowth meeting this point was laying b ackwards to the bare section. One thing is now a problem that we must try and sol ve; that is this pulling out of the earth on lift off and this burnt ring mark effect. P-11 did do many flights from the period of August 1968 until December 1968 when she was destroyed, as there was no place to ho use it for safety's sake. The P-11 would fill a book on its own. You might say that th e P-11 is dead. She has been laid to rest in the records of the success story of Starshi p Ezekiel, and was only a small bit of that story. We learned a lot from P-11, but Demo 1 has taught us even more, and is not yet complete. How much more will Demo 1 teach us wh en she's shot up into the blue sky! This time a mass of cameras will record her la unch by slides and photos, cine films, and even TV cameras for the world to see. In a later comment about the P-11 Mr. Searl said, \" Of the thirty-nine crafts flown, probably the most interesting was the P-11. This was launched on June 30,1968, and crossed Cornwall in three minutes. This craft t hen went on to orbit the Earth five hundred times, giving us a great deal of informatio n which has greatly influenced our present and future plans.\" Page 59"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 DEMO 1 J.T.- How big was DEMO 1 ? J.S.- Twenty-one foot diameter and Weighed about 12 tons when it was finished. It was covered with a clear plastic so people could se e that there was no trickery inside. And the cameras could see thru it. J.T.- And it would fly even with the clear plastic on it? I thought you had to charge it on the top and bottom. J.S.- Of course we ran a fine wire grid to act as t he electrical doings. But the plastic had a negative charge. It was selected for this par ticular work. J.T.-I see. So then you ran a thin grid of wire in it to charge up the top and the bottom? J.S.- Charge up the surface. Then you have the flig ht cells at the edge, so you could control the movement of the craft. J.T.- So that was capable of flight. J.S.- Oh yes! It sure was. It could go around the w orld as many times as we wished! It's main objective was to prove to the scientists that such a structure could support itself. And they were wrong by saying it couldn't. And I proved my point. J.T.- How far did you get that one off the ground? J.S.- Well, we had it up 12 or 15 miles. Whipped it around at 1000 miles per hour and brought it down and put it down as though it was no problem. J.T.- Did the DEMO-1 still have the SEG in it when you left it? J.S.- Yes, it was all complete when I left it. I wa s wiring it when Bill Sherwood came with his wife Rhoda and Dr. Kane. We were well into the wiring of it. We had it all complete. J.T.- Oh, so did you have the SEG running all the t ime? Page 60"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 J.S.- Yes, it was running but we could stop it beca use when I was in Canada I found out by accident how to stop it. Up till then we did n't know how to stop it. We could never stop the engine once it started. But while I was demonstrating it in Canada, I was demonstrating it on T.V. I forget what the stat ion was now. I'm still trying to find the copy of the report on it. The original was dest royed. It names all the people who came to the demonstration. Of course millions more saw it through TV. It was seen right through to Washington. In the middle of that demonstration, it stopped. For the first time ever. It stopped. And of course my face was such a shock that the cameras pulled back to look at my face! And as soon as they did that, off it went again. And immediately when that happened, I knew why. The osc illator of that camera was beating an artificial pole on that bar. And it stopped the roller because it could line up with two poles. But as soon as that camera was gone, tha t pole was gone, and away went the roller again because the poles are unbalanced. So I knew the answer. A simple embarrassment produced the answer. Page 61"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 U.S. DEMONSTRATION OF FLYING CRAFT J.T.- Didn't you demonstrate the flying disc to the Unite d States Airforce a long time ago? J.S.- Yes, that was at your Edward's Airforce Base. I used to have the letter from them that said that the technology was outside their acc epted technology. That was one problem. Because they said, \"Your craft doesn't app ear to have inertia. That is con- trary to all our knowledge.\" This was around 1970. And the next thing they said was the speed and the turns were so sharp they doubted anyone could survive. And funny enough, that's exactly is what Freddy Laker said, a nd British Airways said, but they're stupid! Because I tried to explain to them, \"You ar e traveling a damn sight faster right now while you're standing here talking to me! And y ou're not feeling a bit of it! So if that craft is exactly like this earth, it is a worl d of its own. When you are in it, you are related to that craft and not to anything else. J.T.- Who was the officer there? J.S.- It was one of the top scientists there of the flight research department. I'm an- noyed that all of those papers are lost. It may be in one of the old Journals. I think there were two problems with them. I think the majo r problem was, they couldn't believe anyone could live inside a craft at that sp eed making those turns. That was the major thing. And the second major thing was the y couldn't explain why there was no inertia. If they could solve an answer for that, they would have probably took it on. J.T.-I think it was way over their heads. J.S.- Way over their heads! They are born with the fact that everything has inertia. When you apply force, it takes time for the force t o begin to move. It has to overcome this resistance. But this, these rollers immediatel y move and are traveling instantly at a constant speed. Now that is against everything they know. And to take a job on that does that, that they cannot explain that pheno menon, they would look stupid! And the last thing that they will do is to take on anything that will make them look stupid. And that's what it boils down to. Page 62"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 FLYING CRAFT SIZE & USES J.T.- What were the sizes of the flying crafts you made? J.S.- The biggest one was forty feet. We had two at thirty eight feet also. But the one we allowed the media to watch us build, DEMO 1, was twenty one feet in diameter. J.T.- How big was the one in the picture, in flight ? J.S.- The one in flight. That one was twenty one fe et. J.T.- Oh, I thought it was smaller! J.S.- No, it's just because of the distance away. J.T.- Do you have to stay a long way away from it? J.S.- Yes, quite some ways from it. The way they to ok the picture gives the impression that I'm really quite close to it. But that's done really, I think, to try to emphasize to people that it's quite safe in the air even if it's just hovering there. J.T.- What if you brought that down close to say an automobile or something? Could you bring it close to another object? J.S.- Oh yes. If you brought it say to a car, you k now quite naturally that no one is in it, you could lift the car. You wouldn't lift it wi th people in it because there'd probably be no oxygen in the car. J.T.-I see, the field will go around the automobile ? J.S.- Yes it will go around, you can lift the car. The car will cease to have weight. You wouldn't lift it with people in it because they wou ld have no pressure suit on or oxygen supply. J.T.- O.K. I thought the field would repel everythi ng outside of it. Page 63"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 J.S.- No. Only if something was heading towards it. If you came over the top of it, then it doesn't because you've got solid mass holding it from pushing away. Once it's in the vacuum it would be sucked in. But something coming at you like a rocket, it would be twisted away and deflected. It would slowly deflect and by the time it was in line at the rim, it would be turning off by something like forty five degrees away from it. J.T.- Oh, that's a nice feature! J.S.- Yes, it turns away and takes an entirely diff erent route. Just one thing has to be brought to mind, if your racing in a space ship int o space and a great chunk of rock is coming towards you, the craft has to sum up whichev er object has higher kinetic en- ergy. Whether the oncoming object has higher kineti c energy than the craft has. If it has then the craft has to move out of the way. But if it's energy is greater than the energy of the rock then the rock will move out of t he way. It will be deflected. J.T.- Well either way you don't hit it. That's good ! J.S.- We used to rush models towards my home to sho w that it can't hit the building. As soon as it gets close to the building, the field pushes it away. J.T.- Were there ever any manned flights of your cr afts? J.S.- No. None were manned. Because of the vacuum c reated by the machine, it would make life support systems necessary and the cost wa s too much. There were 6 crafts lost before the radio controlled P-11 was flown. J.T.- You had two units, 21 and 22. Were they both in orbit for two years? J.S.- Oh yes! Most of the crafts were really up the re 10 years before we got rid of them. J.T.- You had some up there for 10 years?? J.S.- Yes. Of course once they had done what we wan ted to know we can't really do anything else with them unless we were going to exp ose them. And we couldn't do that until we had enough information that would allow us to man one. You see media are, shall we say, ignorant people, technologically. Whe n they see something going on, they can't see why you can't man them. And if you can't man them, they start giving you bad publicity. And cause governments to stamp down on you. Page 64"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 J.T.-I thought the longest ones in space were 2 yea rs. J.S.- Oh No!! Most of the crafts you can say were c redited with a good ten years of flight time. The two we talk about for 2 years were testing basically the new nylon body material which went into strychnine. And we ha d to discontinue this fiberglass material of those days. J.T.- That was 21 and 22. But all the others stayed up a long time also? J.S.- Well, all the other 40, only two of them ran into trouble and produced strychnine and thus only did two years of time. But what the o thers did was shown. We took many photographs. We were taking photographs here, there and everywhere! We brought the crafts back and had the film developed and we had cine films. J.T.- Did you have them right in orbit or... J.S.- Yes, from the orbit. I knew more about Austra lia than any book ever told me! When I wrote to a chap in Australia who thought he knew a lot and started telling him some facts and figures that I knew, he was surprise d! He wrote back and said, \"I was surprised! I had to go and look for myself! I didn' t know.\" He said, \"You're right. How did you know? Have you been here?\" I wrote back and said, \"No I've never been there.\" J.T.- Drove by!!! J.S.- Yes, but I said, \"You can't tell me much abou t it. I remember a lot from what I saw in the films. You can't kid us about it. I can tell you all the radio points we used to keep ourselves on course.\" So I knew where the vehicle w as. But I said, \"The day will come when I'll be back in the field again. Only this tim e we'll be manned.\" Page 65"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 PUBLICITY J.T.- Was there a lot of publicity for your work? J.S.- We do know is that the BBC has a lot of film. Because they came out every month to continue the story on the work. Now, do you know any other individual that had a regular program on all channels in the U.K. that's 4 channels. Monday in the first week of the month the BBC 1 carried on with the sto ry where they left off. They would show you just a little bit of the story from where they left off. They'd show you just a little bit of the story in a flashback and then car ried on the story as to how much progress had been made over the month. The following week ITV, an independent TV program, came along and did theirs. They'd take you back to what they last showed you, bits of it to bring your mind back to what you've seen, and then they would continue t he story as to how the progress had gone. And we had been doing this for a whole ye ar!! In there, there was some flight shots showing the craft going up through the trees into airborne and they played the music to the movie 2001 to it. They played me a gainst the Americans effort. All the American failures were kind of chipped and worked i n to make it a good comical game, but that was perhaps the bad part about it. It migh t make people laugh at American failures and we're racing away with a complete new technology. They were playing on this and of course when you eventually went to the moon, we were only 3 months away from proceeding with a manned flight.

They switched the wrong plates on, and the twins, our twins, got up in the corner at the back of the boiler where they were playing. And I was wondering how the pot of oil I had on was warming, getting hot enough for a job I wanted to do. And wh en I got there I was amazed. This tank was red hot. It actually was red. The metal wa s red hot. The kids were playing there. I had to rush and pull them out of the way a nd told them to get outside as far as they can out up the garden and I rushed the doors o pen and the windows open and then I went to lift the tank to bring it outside. S o if it was going to blow, it wouldn't damage the house. But just as I was walking past an open window to get to the door, a draft of air caught it and it went like a bomb. I t took all the paint off right through to the bricks, about 10 layers of paint. It took the c eiling off. It disintegrated the lamp shade and cables. It disintegrated the fuse box and disintegrated the electric meter. It ripped everything out! It stripped the whole bui lding down to bare bricks. J.T.- It's amazing you weren't killed! J.S.- Yes, and the clothes hanging on the line dryi ng all went, line-lot, everything disappeared. My hair was on fire. Nobody moved to d o anything to help! We had a big chest freezer, so I had to dive into that. And all my neck was burnt, blood was pouring out the juggler vein and I had to strap myself. And nobody would ring the doctor. I had to ring the doctor myself. They dressed me all up b ut 24 hours later. I was in real agony. I had to be rushed to the hospital and gangr ene was forming in my neck. J.T.- Oh no. J.S.-And you could see the blood gush out as they t ook the dressing off. They said the doctor put the wrong stuff on. He shouldn't have us ed that type of dressing. So they had to pump penicillin into me and dressed me up. I looked like an Egyptian mummy! It was for about 8 weeks and then the Sherwoods, (B ill and Rhoda) arrived and Dr. Cain arrived. I was just undressed apart from the n eck. The neck still presenting a bit of a problem. That was covered. The doctors at the hospital said that my face would be permanently marked, but the Sherwoods were shocked when my face had been just uncovered.

This segment is taken from the SEARL NATIONAL SPACE RESEARCH CON- SORTIUM newsletter of September 1,1971. In it John Searl gives his views and pro- jections for the future. April 1961 saw the first manned spacecraft launched from Baikonur in central Asia. It was then followed by the first American on e, launched from Cape Kennedy. Such is the pace of space progress, that today many different types of spacecraft exist, or are under development. I know that, when this st atement is made by others, the Levity Disc is generally not included. Why not? It, too, is a construction of a space program. It's merits exceed those of the rocket by far, and I say this with no disrespect to the rocket designers. Why, then, should it not b e included among spacecraft under development? Is it simply that America has already made a number of manned flights to the moon? To that type of argument, I say, (if y ou will excuse the term), \"Rubbish!\" You are comparing one man's progress against the mi ghty resources of finance and manpower available to the governments of those coun tries involved in space work. Remember also that nearly twenty years was spent on costly research before they succeeded in their achievement. By contrast, I have spent only three and a half years on Space Project Swallow, much of the work be ing done in spare time or in time stolen from normal sleeping hours, and all of the f inancing coming out of my own pocket, or from the support of a few interested fri ends. So if you wish to compare hours times manpower times finance, I have, (you might sa y), thousands of years to go be- fore I catch up to the amount already spent by the Americans! I am sure that long before then, we shall have visited the moon, Mars, Venus, and all the planets of our solar system, and will have launched exploratory cr aft deep into the Milky Way Gal- axy, outstripping the American and Russian rocket s ystem completely. I say this in absolute faith. Man stands at the threshold of fantastic new explor ations deep into interplan- etary space. Only now has it been possible to asses s the achievement of man in space, and in our newsletters the facts of both the Russia n and American space achieve- ments will be given, as well as our own progress so far. You may have read many of the current articles in b ooks, journals, etc., on the subject of space, or have received programs and int erviews on radio and TV. I too have had programs on radio and TV, as well as press writ e-ups. However, these have too often been presented from a humorous rather than a serious point of view, which of course has been more of a hindrance to our work tha n a help. Some have been critical of the estimated costs of our project. May I say th at the cost of the development of the Levity Disc will be only a fraction of the cost of one Saturn Rocket. The money spent on the advancement of knowledge thr ough research is seldom wasted. Given time, the investment nearly always re aps a rich reward, often in the most unexpected direction. Astronautics, the scienc e and technology of space flight, is likely to be no exception. Especially is this so in the case of the Levity Disc, since its constructional and operational costs are so small c ompared to those of the rocket sys- tem. Page 72"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 Combining as it does almost every scientific and te chnical discipline, space progress has already become a \"spearhead technology \", stimulating the development of new materials and processes of manufacture. The benefits will most certainly ac- crue to the Levity Disc in terms both of time and e xpense. Space progress may be expected to produce a steady advancement in such ba sic fields as metals, ceramics, plastics, microelectronics, power generation, indus trial management, and many more. The effects on industry in general are revolutionar y and to a large extent unforesee- able, but they may be expected to have the widest s ignificance for twentieth-century man. Space progress will also produce important medical benefits. The close atten- tion now being paid to the workings of the human bo dy under space conditions is resulting in the collection of more data on vital p hysiological functions, particularly in the reaction of the circulatory system to stress , than in decades of conventional medicine. Techniques learned in space, such as monitoring bod ily functions, (heart-rate, respiration, etc.) by telemetric sensors, are direc tly applicable to the work that we will be doing in the development of the Levity Disc. The se developments are revolutioniz- ing medical instrumentation in hospitals, and we in tend to make full use of them on Starship Ezekiel. Thus she will be virtually a semi -automated space hospital, where a patient's physiological reactions are automatically reported to master consoles, which in turn telemeter the information back to consoles on planet Earth, which both alert the medical staff and provide computerized data on the patient's condition. However, new and perhaps even more exciting opportu nities are about to open up. Medical research could benefit from the close a ttention that space scientists are paying to the living cell in probing for the essent ial conditions for life to develop on other planets. What most people do not appreciate i s the fact that the space effort presents man with a golden opportunity to open his mind up from a narrow path to a much broader path, so that he can understand more a bout himself and his total envi- ronment. Nothing before ever so stimulated man to d ig deeply for new knowledge as the prospect of the actual exploration of space, wh ich first appeared about twenty years ago. The automated biological laboratory which the Ameri can Voyager spacecraft is to land on Mars in the 1970's will have both soil s ampling and air sampling apparatus for checking on the presence of bacteria and report ing findings to Earth. Equipment which will be used by Starship Ezekiel to do work o f this type will be constructed more quickly and cheaply as a consequence. In this area of advanced biology, the interests of space science and medical research may merge, to the benefit of mankind- for a greater understanding of the properties of the living cell is fundamental to win ning the battle against malignant disease. It is interesting and vitally significant that important experiments concern- ing the structure of living matter are now taking p lace in research centers devoted to space problems. If these are some of the \"hidden\" benefits of space research, there are others more obvious, that are almost taken for granted. On e is the relay satellite, which allows television to span continents and oceans. Page 73"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 We in England watched Apollo 15 on television trans mitted from America. The pictures were extremely good in quality, when you c onsider that they had traveled from the moon via America to us. I was unable to se e much of this transmission be- cause I was too busy working on the construction of Demonstration Craft No. 1 at that time, but I did see the bit about the Hadley Rille. I might comment that I was rather disappointed. A lot was said about what we were goi ng to see, but when the time came, nothing at all showed up to tell the differen ce between the surface and the rille itself. As far as I could tell, it was almost as le vel as the ground the astronauts were walking on. Aside from this, the pictures were very good. I did see the lift off from the Moon's surface, and to me that was well within what I expected to see. Many expected to see large gusts of flames, but I had already calculated a different picture, which looked more l ike what we saw. There were a few things which spoiled the whole effort to some exten t. These were not necessarily the fault of the astronauts, but of those who planned t he program they were to accomplish and the tools which they were given to use. We will take this up in another letter, in which we discuss how we plan to conduct experiments on the lunar surface. The development of satellite communications in the first decade of the space age has been a little short of miraculous. When we see programs on our television screens relayed across the Atlantic, we think of th e small box of high-grade electronics working unattended in the hostile environment of sp ace that makes it all possible. Very few people could have imagined the standards o f reliability now being achieved in space electronics. Yet during 1952 I had stated that a crystal-type solid state com- ponent would be developed which would make space tr avel possible, even if the tube could not perform its functions with reliability ov er a long time, or withstand the environment. The achievement, of course, extends far beyond comm unications. As an example, satellites warning of the approach of hurricanes an d typhoons, as well as performing routine global weather survey, are in regular opera tion. And the future is bright, for the combination of these systems in the form of mul tipurpose spacecraft such as the Levity Disc should cut the cost to a small fraction of today's rocket costs, thus enabling man to devote more of his energies towards serving his fellow man and protecting him from death and destruction in the wake of natural d isasters. If so much progress has been achieved in the last t wenty years, using only rocket systems, then what will happen in the next t wenty or thirty years if the Levity Disc were developed to replace the rocket? It is no t difficult to predict that our planet will be covered by networks of space communication satellites serving the interests of government, trade and industry. Computer-controlled information banks, flashing the most up-to-date data of all kinds by satellite to a ll subscribers around the world, have already been suggested. Again, the Levity Disc is i deal for implementing such a pro- gram, offering rich opportunities for commerce and education. One other important development has been accomplish ed. This is the direct- broadcasting satellite poised in geostationary orbi t, beaming radio and television sig- nals directly to control centers, and in the forese eable future, to home antennas. Such powerful satellites, dispensing with costly ground terminals and cross-country relay stations, will depend on inexpensively produced dis h-antennas pointed skyward to Page 74"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 intercept the signals coming to them directly from space. In this way programs beamed to a satellite from a single ground transmitter wil l be retransmitted over a vast area. Apart from the utility of such satellites in develo ped parts of the world, consider their effectiveness for bringing education to community c enters in emerging countries. The growth of supersonic air travel, first over the Atlantic and then the Pacific, is also likely to depend heavily on satellites for air traffic control, in order to assure maximum safety for the international commuter. This will be increasingly true as Levity Discs become the accepted means of high spee d travel across the face of the globe, and as the benefits of the economy of this m ode of transportation are increas- ingly realized. None of these techniques demand radical advances fr om systems already de- veloped in the first space decade, and their influe nce is likely to be much wider than we can imagine at present. But even this is not the limit of the space age potential. Those who strive to build the science of the space age, astronautics, (and we are cer- tainly doing our share to interest others at a high business level), whatever their country, being filled with a desire to promote a de eper understanding of the universe through interplanetary exploration, have always reg arded ourselves as members of a greater international family. It is therefore heart ening that space activity, rather than adding to the human burden in terms of armaments, w ill actually tend to reduce international tensions and promote cooperation. In a very real sense, space travel is sweeping asid e national boundaries, mak- ing closed societies more difficult and breaking do wn international distrust. Eventu- ally the space race that grew out of the East-West rivalries of the fifties must give way to collaboration. When it does, it may well bring a bout the climate for at least a degree of disarmament. Already the United Nations Treaty on Outer Space, s igned in 1967 by countries of both East and West, bans weapons of mass destruc tion from outer space and pro- vides for equal access to the moon and other celest ial bodies by all nations. (In regard to this treaty, I would like to make the comment th at, although not a signator, we will undertake to honor all that is good within the trea ty, and intend to make a full state- ment as to what we agree to, as soon as we have an opportunity to study it thor- oughly.) Out of this could grow collaboration in th e exploration of the moon. When it becomes technically possible, in principle there is nothing to prevent the countries of the world, under an agreed program, from combining in a joint logistics operation to carry prefabricated parts to the moon, (or to any p lanet), for the development of an international lunar base. We heartily concur with a statement made by the lat e President Kennedy be- fore the U.N. General Assembly on September 20, 196 3. He said: \"Why...should man's first flight to the moon be a matter of internation al competition? Why should the United States and the Soviet Union, in preparing su ch expeditions, become involved in immense duplications of research?\"...But I am af raid this is exactly what has hap- pened. In our case, we are traveling on an entirely different road. Whereas they have duplicated much construction and expenditure, I sta te that surely we should explore the possibilities of cooperative effort on the part of scientists and astronauts of all countries, so that we might someday send to the Moo n, not the representatives of a Page 75"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 single nation, but the representatives of planet Ea rth. This is our approach. Those who make the first journey on Starship Ezekiel will be listed in our records as repre- sentatives of the human race. We urge others working on some radically new approa ch to space travel to join with us. Individual effort, however laudable, can n ever be as effective as cooperative effort. Alone, you will not achieve much, but a col laborated attack on many different ideas will yield results more quickly and cheaply, and avoid wasteful duplication. That is why we are progressing so well. United under one center that directs the fields of study, we pool all results back to the center, wher e it is arranged into systems. Why is it that the suggestion of international coop eration in space development still lacks a formula for combining the resources o f both East and West, yet expresses the feelings of so many people? In Space Project Sw allow, everything possible is done to maintain an ease of approach to joining, and to encourage the different countries to produce a sub-journal to translate our work back to their people. And the pooling of information is working very well indeed. At some fu ture stage, in an atmosphere of reduced international tensions, it may be possible to achieve a degree of technological cooperation. Possibly the best chances lie in the d irection of expensive projects involv- ing logistics supply, the lunar base, and manned in terplanetary exploration. As a first step, it might be possible to develop an international orbiting labora- tory. This would involve not the assembly of a sing le space station in earth-orbit, but rather the orbital grouping of a number of spacecra ft in conjunction with a \"dormi- tory\" module. The various components, put up from launch centers throughout the world, would serve different functions. For example, one c ould work in astronomy, one in biology, and another in meteorology and Earth conse rvation. Each would benefit from the others in terms of logistics support, equipment repair and astronaut safety. This is how we planned our efforts. The first Starship Ezekiel will be an all-round bas ic research and study craft, mapping the basic facts. These, in turn, are teleme tered back to Earth. Next, another craft is designed and constructed on the findings o f Starship Ezekiel, which in turn moves on to another mission, (possibly an unexplore d planetary surface), again telemetering basic information back to Earth. If th e second craft is capable of han- dling all the work it will have to do, no other wil l be needed. If not, another craft will be designed to cover the fields which the second cr aft could not. Thus the craft arriv- ing on a planetary surface will be equipped only to cover the basic findings of Starship Ezekiel, in order to complete a comprehensive scien tific report. Time and money will thereby be conserved to the fullest extent. Astronaut-scientists would move between the differe nt vehicles in a kind of \"space-taxi\", which would be a Levity Disc of the S earl system, using a docking tech- nique. Such methods have already been seen in the G emini and Apollo programs of America. At a later date we shall study modular ass embly of an orbiting laboratory. The prospects for this type of development are cons iderable, for scientific satellites and space probes could be placed into position by Levity Discs at a price that could not be equalled by the rocket , which has already begun to revolu- tionize our understanding of the universe. Cameras and spectral sensors turned towards the Ear th have shown the prom- ise of new opportunities for assessing the world's natural resources. The National Page 76"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 Aeronautics and Space Administration has defined mo re than 200 Earth-related ex- periments that could be performed from a manned orb iting laboratory, including car- tography, (mapping), geology, oceanography, water m anagement, ice survey, agricul- ture, meteorology, and other studies unique to the space environment. All this could be undertaken by specially designed Levity Discs, e conomically and efficiently. Dr. Wernher Von Braun, technical director of the Ma rshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, U.S.A., has written enthusi astically about these prospects, I am told. Wherever man goes, he cuts trees, tills soil, build s houses, factories and roads. All this diverse activity is detectable from space. As information collated with Earth- based information, it can be used to assess the wor ld's burgeoning population and their future needs. From the vantage point of space , it should be possible to detect crop disease in time to initiate corrective action. Black stain rust, for instance, is difficult to detect in its early stages. Remote sen sors can spot the rust several days earlier than a man who is standing on the ground. T his is an example of one of the major areas of work where space development will ma ke a contribution. Using similar remote sensing techniques, it should be possible to discover wa- ter and mineral imbalance in the soil, leading to b etter use of land in agriculture. By measuring minute differences in soil temperature, i t may be possible to detect under- ground rivers, or measure snowfall and spring thaws helpful to the management of water in storage lakes. Life patterns in the seas a nd feeding grounds for fish may also be discernible. Let me assure you of this: man's future on this pla net will depend on how well he learns to use the planet for his ends. Otherwise the planet will see man's end, and sooner than most of us are able to appreciate. Many of these remote sensing tech- niques are possible because of the prior developmen t of military reconnaissance sur- veillance satellites. Observations made by the astr onauts themselves have contrib- uted important information. Will such craft as Starship Ezekiel be restricted t o one country? My answer is \"no\". Nor do I think that only the rich countries o f the Earth will do research with these craft. I can envision grants being establishe d on the pattern of Antarctic explo- ration, whereby graduate scientists of all counties could qualify after special training, to conduct research aboard a space vehicle like Sta rship Ezekiel. Whether or not this degree of cooperation comes abo ut after the \"space race\" is over, only time will tell. At least we at the Natio nal Space Research Consortium have made a start towards it. Whether it will catch on o r not is up to you. I make this offer to you in good faith: join with u s now and we will pull together to speed the success of Space Project Swallow. I tr uly believe that, despite differences in ideology, the nations of the world can work toge ther in cooperation, not competi- tion, on the routine and arduous task of exploring space and the planets for scientific and economic purposes. If so, then the best hopes o f those who laid the foundations of astronautics will have been realized. Mr. J.R.R. Searl, M. ins. P.I.

What did you mean by th at? J.S.- Oh, that's an article in the latest book, whe re it told about when the electric board removed all our power. Back then we moved fro m the Midlands down to Berk- shire and while I was up there at their headquarter s I purchased all the switch gear and cable and the cooker and things because I knew the house we were going to had no electricity. So I wired up the place and when that electric board came to connect the power they said they wouldn't connect it because th e switch gear did not comply to their requirements. And I was REALLY angry because it was all the electric boards property that I had purchased, and they were refusi ng to connect it because I hadn't bought it from THEIR show room. So when they refuse d, I connected it. After three months they came and took the power off . So I went down and told them. I said, \"You've got exactly 24 hours to put t hat power back on, or I will stop all power for the whole area! And it will keep off unti l you put the power cables back!\" And they said to me that I can't take the law into my own hands. I said, \"You just try me and see! I have the technology and I'll USE it!\" By the time I got back, the cables were back on. So they realized that I meant busines s. J.T.- When they finally let you out of jail, did th ey give you any money? Did you sue them? J.S.- No. No. I had no home or anywhere to go to. N othing. The home was gone... everything. J.T.- What did they charge you with? J.S.- Well I had built and installed an SEG to supp ly my home with electricity. They charged me with stealing electricity. They called i t stealing electricity because, elec- tricity was supplied to your house and you weren't using it. But you had electricity. But you were supposed to be using THEIR electricity . But today, I assume, that if you put up a power generator of any kind, you could ask them to take off their electric. But you couldn't in the time we're talking about. You h ad to use their electricity if it was there. You couldn't use your own. It was forbidden. A man by the name of Devon E. Tassen said to me whe n I was there with him, that he came to Scotland and put in a water generat or, a power generator, and he had a hell of time. They broke him! He had to do this, he had to do that. The electric board fought him. He said we've fit these everywhere, wit h no trouble. But in England they were really making sure that we didn't make a penny 's profit out of it. They made us do this and made us do that. Things that weren't ne eded. But you had to do it in order to be able to do the contract. Page 78"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 J.T.- So they came and told you, you were stealing their electricity even though you were generating it with your own SEG. J.S.- Yes, because you had to use their electric. T hey were \"all powerful.\" J.T.- On that SEG that you had running your house, what was the output? J.S.- That was a very old SEG. I made that back in 1952. J.T.- Oh, did you make the coils so that they put o ut the exact right voltage? J.S.- Yes, 240 volts A.C. and up to 11 kilowatts. J.T.- Oh, alright, so you didn't have to transform it or anything? J.S.- No. No. I set it into the wall as part of the wall structure. And just brought the power up to the fuse box and from then on it was ju st normal house wiring. J.T.- Now did your voltage stay constant even when the load changed? J.S.- Oh Yes! It makes no difference. Because, you see, is as soon as there's a larger current, the rollers run faster, and the machine go es cooler, so the power is improved. J.T.- You would think that it would cause your volt age to go up. J.S.- No, What happens is that your coils are reall y your resistance block. But remem- ber, as the coils get colder, there is less resista nce. So more current is available. J.T.- Oh, so you're just drawing more current witho ut a voltage rise. J.S.- Yes, because you're going into a superconduct ive state. And as you take more and more current, the nearer you are getting to the sup erconductor state. But it's when you get to the superconductor state, is when you ge t into trouble! Because it goes airborne. So you know you've got the superconductiv e state. J.T.- Ya, you know you've got it then! J.S.- Yes, but at the time we didn't realize what w as happening. It just shot off into the air! We know now that the reaction of a superconduc tive state will pull away from a magnetic field. It will lift away from it. The eart h is a magnetic field, so the object is going to go away from the earth.

She planned then that she would do so mething to stop all this work, and stop it for good. J.T.- Gee, You'd think she would like that! J.S.- Oh she got everything destroyed, legally. 5 m illion pounds of property. The pub- lics money. And on top of that a lot of people had been very nice to her. Bill Sherwood and his wife Rhoda brought presents to her and the children. Dr. Kane had her hair all done up and paid for it. He bought me shoes because he knew I wouldn't buy any and my feet were out of the shoes I had. He told Rev. G eorge Nichelson, \"Take this money and get him shoes because if I give it to him he'll put it on the spacecraft.\" The Japa- nese that came by the hundreds all brought presents . Not one of them came without a present. So it wasn't that she was hard done by thi s thing, she wasn't. And I think Bill will tell you if you ask him, that the children and the wife didn't suffer. We were hard up, yes. Because I was working nights to keep us go ing and working days to get the work done. And that was hard work. J.T.- How did she manage to get your work destroyed ? J.S.- Well she got together with the power company and they arrested me on the charge that I was stealing power from them. You see I was running my house on an SEG and was not using their power. The police and the power company people ripped out all the wiring in the house and confiscated the SEG. I was unjustly thrown into prison and while I was imprisoned she called the police and as ked if she could get rid of all my papers and equipment? They said that she could do w hatever she wanted as she was my wife, the things could be considered hers also. There were also books kept by John at his house of all the people who had witnessed his work. Each person would sign the book and put down their thoughts. Gunner Sandberg was asked to go to John's home whil e he was imprisoned and get those books. He went to the house but did not get t he books. He was sent to get certain information from the house. One of the things he wa s asked to get was the book that was signed by everyone of the people who witnessed the demonstrations of the SEG and levity discs. He said that there was too much t here and he was going to go back for it later. Meanwhile the authorities burned all the papers in John's home.

After you got out of prison? J.S.- No, later while I was in the Midlands. Well, what happened was Luis Jarillo was advertising for me in the papers and magazines for accommodations, preferably in the London area. The idea was that if I came to London, he could help me to try to recover the past information and rebuild again. And that wa s supposed to have been the rea- son. J.T.- That was after you got out of prison and were looking for a place. J.S.- Yes, But I met lot's of people from all parts of the world. They were all divorcees, they just wanted a good time and therefore I wasn't compatible. And in the end Luis rung me to say that there was a girl who rung up th at said she worked nights. And she sleeps during the day until about 4 o'clock or 5. A nd if I'd like to ring her, she'd like to tell me something about herself. If I'm interested I could come down to meet her. So Luis gave me her number. So I rang her and she said, \"Well, you can come dow n and see me.\" Oh, first she said, \"I'm black, do you mind?\" I said, \"Well have you got a heart?\" I said, \"That is the important thing. I've had a wife with no heart. And I want somebody with a heart.\" And she said, \"Yes.\" So I came down and stayed the night with Luis, and we both came down late in the afternoon to meet her here. And I stayed. She asked me if I wanted to stay and I stayed. And that was on a Saturday and o n Sunday I went back. On Monday, a week later I paid for her to come up t o me in the Midlands and she stayed the weekend. And then I came down here again and took her down to the coast for the weekend and came back . And she came 2 more times to the Midlands and I said, \"Well if you're prepared, I'll move in with you and bring some of my stuff down.\" But I said, \"This work may mean a lot of people calling. A lot of phone calls. A lot of articles and no doubt the day will come when the press and the media will come flooding in. It's all this you'll h ave to put up with.\" She didn't seem to mind. So I came down and put a lot of stuff in stores and came down here. And when I went back to get the stuff much later, I was very ill, I had just got operated on. I was in a lot of pain. That was another thing she had to put up with because I couldn't hardly move. I had twice the pain I had before I we nt in for the operation. Then after a year she said to me, \"Look, I'm not going to talk to you anymore until you go and see a doctor. You can't keep on like this.\" And in the end I went to the doctor and said, \"Well my land lady said that if I don't come down a nd see you, she won't talk to me ever again.\" I said, \"Well I can't have that.\" He t ook one quick look and said, \"I can't do anything for you, you have to see a surgeon. I'll w rite a letter of urgency. You'll have to go in. They'll have to open you up to find out what 's wrong.\" And a month later I was in and they operated. At least the added half of pa in since I had the operation was gone when I came out the second time. Page 83"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 J.T.- What was the operation for? J.S.- Well the first operation was to remove the ga ll bladder. And when I came out of the operation I had TWICE the pain. But they didn't take any notice. No matter how much I complained. And then in 3 days thrombosis se t in. They were on the run then. They had me completely stripped. They had me lie on top of the bed while two fans just blasted cold air at me day and night. Then the y had to find a drug that would break the blood up without doing too much damage. A nd that took a few days of tests and experiments to get the right drug and the right dose. And for about eight months I was on this treatment. But still they did nothing about that pain I kept telling them that I was in. And in the end I moved down here and of course I didn't bother to try to get any help until Susan said she wouldn't talk to me anymore unless I saw the doctor. \"You can't go on like that. You can't hardly move. You can't get your socks on. You can't get your shoes on. You've got to see the doctor.\" J.T.- So what did they finally find? J.S.- Well when they opened me up they found that a hole had occurred and that fat had been pushing through it. And that's what was ca using the pain. So in other words, they nicked something when they were cutting and di dn't notice it. And after sealing me up, fat started pushing through and pressing on nerves causing quite some pain. It was agonizing. And of course I came out with double pneumonia so they were banging me to get the stuff out of my chest. And I was in a ll that pain. And they kept saying, \"You've got to cough! You've got to cough the stuff out.\" And how could you. You couldn't. You were in so much pain. They said, \"You'll die if you don't!\" I said, \"I can't. How can I cough when I'm in such pain?\" So when I went for the second operation I told them what happened. I came out with double pneumonia and thro mbosis. So they gave me treat- ment before I went in for the operation to stop the thrombosis and hopefully any pneumonia attack. And I came out and didn't have th is trouble because they were aware of what could happen. J.T.- So they finally got you straightened around. J.S.- Well, they have, except they haven't stopped the original pain. The original pain from the first operation is still there on the same side as the operation. But still, the way I look at it, I think personally I've done very well. The house shows for a person with no natural balance who depends on shear force and energy on his part to do it. At my age I'm still doing very well and I think I can match most people. Anyone who is really arguing whether at my age I am capable of do ing something like STARSHIP EZIKIEL would, if they come here, realize that I'm quite capable of doing it, because they wouldn't want to try to do what I've done here . A number of people that have come here say, \"God I don't know where you got the patience.\" J.T.- It's amazing. I don't know how you carry on s ometimes.

Of course we had a bit of a job to fi nd the place, but in the end we found it. We went up to the house and we couldn't see the DEM O 1, so I knocked on the door. A lady came and I said,\" I've come to see the flying saucer.\" So she said, \"Ah!, It's gone. It was moved four months ago. You just missed it!

J.S.- No everything's gone. I've found some of the stuff in Birmingham, in a shop. And I went in the shop and said that's my name on those things. I recognized those things as I walked by. I say, \"You just lift them up. Open it, you'll see my name.\" I told him what it was. He says, \"I'm sorry mate, I paid for t his stuff.\" J.T.- What was it? J.S.- It was some of the equipment that I used for the flying side. There was a radar unit, there was the oscillator that controlled the speed, which I could control the speed of the motor and some of the equipment that can be seen in the film that we have that the television sent out, that was used for the timi ng of the takeoff. We found these in different shops in the Midlands! I was shocked! In fact the girl I was with said to me, \"That's funny. Come back to the shop. I've just see n something that you've been telling me about.\" We headed back to the shop. She said, \"T here. That's what you've been telling me about!\" And I looked and said, \"Yes!

Many readers know of others, who have had ideas and technologies, who have been \"slapped down\" by the established money contro llers of the day. These people have stopped progress and new ideas throughout hist ory in the name of science and religion and government security. Many of the peopl e that we revere today as great scholars and scientists were at one time persecuted as cranks or heretics to the teach- ings of the church. How much knowledge has been los t to us through the ignorance and greed of people who are only interested in them selves and their own interests? Most people who are \"slapped down\" by the establish ment never recover. They give up on humanity or are persecuted to the point that the y can no longer give their ideas or views to anyone. No one will listen. This book is about one man who has not given up on humanity and refuses to be stopped by the greedy, corrupt people who would try to prevent his work from becom- ing a reality. If we as an intelligent people want technology such as this, we must fight for it. It will not be presented on a silver plater to you like a new toy on the market. There will be resistance to this new technology, bu t if you want it, it is here for the asking. Prof. Searl is 61 years old as of 1993. This will b e the last time he will be able to offer this to the world. Do you want it? That is th e question. Only you can supply the answer.

J.S.- Yes, now nine years to twelve years away. J.T.- You say that that is in 2003? J.S.- From the third of May 2000 to the fifth of Ma y 2003. This is the period where we can expect drastic changes due to the pole shift. J.T.- Now where did you get this? J.S.- Well we've been looking at all satellite data for why the earth has had pole shifts before. J.T.- How often does this occur? J.S.- We've had them seven times before. They will happen again and again and again because it's a natural phenomenon. What happens is when a top spins, things do sometimes build up on a spot. Now as it builds up u nderneath, and you can do this to any top you like - any big top. If you spin it befo re you put some nice heavy little lump on some spot underneath, and watch how long it wobb les before it falls, you'll see that it takes a long time. But now build a little weight , like lead, put a lump of lead under- neath at one spot. And now see that it only takes a few wobbles for it to fall and it will fall in the direction of that bump. Now the earth has such a bump building by thousands of gallons at one spot called \"Little America\" in Antarctica. And that bum p will cause the earth to tumble quicker than normal. Normally every eleven years Ju piter passes in back of the Sun. The Sun spews out a mass of activity and it spins t he earth up. Now the problem is, if the earth is heating up and things are getting unba lanced, the earth is slowing down quicker than it should be. Jupiter's impact will be pretty strong, but the one thing that we have never had modern science around to che ck is what happens when two giants come together behind the Sun. Which will tak e place around the third of May in the year 2000. If Jupiter could do all this dama ge to us, will two do twice as much damage? In fact where do these two forces have to b e to apply the maximum effort on the earth? With such an impact hitting the earth wh en it's at it's peak wobble, it will knock it completely over. So it just keeps turning over and over and over in space and everything will get destroyed. Or will it just knoc k it over to a new pole shift position? J.T.- Well even a small shift would be catastrophic ! J.S.- Oh yes! You're going to whip up winds of over 500 miles per hour or 1000 miles per hour for about four years. Page 89"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 J.T.- Boy! I hope we can get these things built bef ore then. J.S.- Well we want to. Because we're looking at lot s of areas except the equator belt, suffering immense winds. There will be lots of plac es with water that will suddenly have no water. Volcanos being disturbed. Earthquake s. J.T.- Yes, there are a lot more of them going on no w. J.S.- Yes, we're looking at something which no mode rn records have been able to ever see before. Man's records of the past were so badly destroyed that we cannot get enough facts but we didn't know what was causing it. A lot of theories came up but now I think the one I put forward the last few years is probabl y the true one. J.T.- That must be in your new book. J.S.- Yes. I've looked at all sorts of things. But the dreams says that I will live to see life all around me gone, destroyed. And that I will see fires greater than anything before by ordinary man of the present time has seen . But I have no need to worry. I shall be lifted from it. I think what it means is t hat the flying machine, manned one, will be built in time. J.T.- Do you think that that's the only escape? J.S.- That would be my escape route. Now everything about the dream has come out true. The mathematics in the dream have come out tr ue telling you how to do the squares. It must be that the dream is true. I am to see this great destruction of this planet and witness it. J.T.- We still don't know the exact date do we? J.S.- Well I know that in two and a half years time the beginning of the run that will lead to the start of the end. And then in the year 2000, that is where we expect the peak. J.T.- So you think it's 2000 rather than 2003? J.S.- Yes, the change will be weather due to pole s hift. J.T.- Do you think the pole shift will be gradual? J.S.- No it will go suddenly when it goes. We have that record of the pharaoh who used to watch the sun set in the East. And he wrote, \"I walked my usual evening walk to see the sun set in the east. And after the sun set I tu rned to go back and I was surprised to see that the sun began to rise again in the east.\" So the earth at his point had swung 180 degrees in a split of a second. And because he was at the center point he didn't feel Page 90"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 the effects. But one thing we are certain of. That the Antarctic froze instantly, freezing all the creatures. Mammals eating tropical plants a nd such. So we know at that time, up to that point, some people probably lived there. People certainly traveled there and drew up the area for maps. And we know from animals that have turned up by the thawing that's been going on that they were taken b y surprise. They were instantly frozen. Because they had tropical plants in their m outh. There were tons of tropical plants around. So it was quite a hot place. Now sud denly it was covered in ice and we know that the ice is mounting very fast because bac k in 1928 those great high radio towers, 110 foot, were put up for broadcasting from the people who went there to study. There's only one left that shows a couple of feet or so above the snow. All the others are covered under snow. It's done it in that time. Millions and millions of gal- lons of fresh water, all frozen there. And although the ice is melting at an alarming rate at the moment, what people forget is that in L ittle America, where these towers are, that's more the center of the icing period. So it is the edging which is folding back towards i t. And at this rate the sea must have increased its height. And we know this is so because some islands have disappeared and other islands are threatened. So we know that the ice cap is certainly shrinking. We know on the north pole side the ice i s moving towards New York. It's slowly increasing so I think what we're looking at is the method by which the earth replenishes an area, then freezes it to rest it so it recovers. And it moves about like this. And this is how the earth keeps on replenishi ng its energy. J.T.- Like a cycle. J.S.- Like a cycling event. The other thing too. Wh at we often forget. We always talk about our orbit around the sun as elliptical. It is elliptical but it moves out of shape every so often and forms a circle. It goes around.. .and it takes about ten thousand years to switch from elliptical to round and back t o elliptical again. So when you go round it means your periods of heat and cool changes com- pletely. These points or levels will be at a precis e point and constant. And when you slip into an elliptical they change dramatically. S o you get this swinging. But the trouble is we shoot away with statements scientific ally certified and we never stop really, to decide whether this statement is absolut ely true or have we accepted what we think is true and made it true. And that is ofte n the problem. That is what is happening. Then some years later things don't match the pictur e. But even in the ancient times they always talked about this great destructi on. But I think the most interest- ing thing is when you start looking at things like past ice ages. Mammals suddenly disappearing off the face of the earth. Then you st art looking at why these things happen. No real scientific explanation can be given . Then you have to ask yourself, \"If there's no scientific evidence that can support the reason for this we must look outside of the earth for some explanation. J.T.- Well the alignment is coming in the year 2000 , I can see that. Page 91"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 J.S.- Yes, so we are looking for an alignment whose forces may cause our sun to put out more energy than normal. And this energy would be t he destructive force. This is what I feel is more realistic. It sounds more realistic based on what happens ever y time Jupiter passes the back of the sun. So if you get two massive electric al magnetic forces piling on the back of the sun, it is likely to make the sun spew out n ot just double the amount of energy, but probably treble or quadruple the energy at the earth. And this may be enough to set off volcanos and earthquakes and cause the eart h's atmosphere to get so thick and packed with dust that the temperature just drops su ddenly. Or it can knock the pole into the reverse position, and if it does you've go t an instant ice age in the new area. J.T.- Do you think it will go 90 degrees instead of 180 degrees? J.S.- Well it's always difficult. All I know is at this time the earth is really rolling slowly and it's really wobbling bad. And I know fro m experiments with tops, an im- mense amount of research, is that if it troubles to o much and you suddenly hit with a force it falls completely. It can only pick up spee d and race off again if you catch it before it reaches a given wobble point. And I was j ust wondering, the wobble may be alright for just Jupiter passing in back of the sun but it may be too much for two giants to pass in back of the sun. And it might cau se the earth to tumble. J.T.- Yes that would explain what happened to Antar ctica. What can we do to protect ourselves during the shift? J.S.- We're meeting a lot of new firms now in desig ning new products ready for this technology. The new house we'll design will withsta nd the highest wind you will ever get on this earth. It takes all the energy of natur e and converts it to useful energy for you to use. It's germ proof, weather proof, sound p roof, burglar proof and fire proof. There's nothing about this building which you can s ay looks ugly. It's design is very pleasing to look at and it could probably stand lon ger than the pyramids stood. And yet I don't expect it to cost any more than a regul ar house to build. But with an ordi- nary house, it is not expected to withstand winds o f 200 to 300 miles per hour which are coming. They're not designed to withstand immen se cold. They don't prevent pol- lution from coming in. Burglars can get in. Fire ca n destroy them, and repair work has to be done. Well this house, when built, will have no repair work that has to be done. Of course you will have to replace an electric lamp when it blows or element in a heater, but the structure itself does not deteriora te. Page 92"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 METEORITE COMING J.T.- You had mentioned that some meteorite is coming. Wh ere did you here that? J.S.- Yes that is a big meteorite coming and that w ill hit the earth. But that is about 2025. That was measurements made by NASA. It was lo cated by that big radio tele- scope that they are doing a scan of the sky with. O f course everybody thinks they are looking for UFO's. But they said that if there are any UFO's around th at they'll find them. But what they want to know is precisely what is out the re. And they're scanning a massive area and they hit on this boulder that's racing tow ards us and will impact on the earth in the year of about 2025. They are trying to work out a system of rockets with nuclear war heads to try to break it up before it reaches t he earth. They are working on some laser work to see if they can smash it with lasers to break it up so it won't damage the earth so much. J.T.- Oh, I haven't heard anything like that here. J.S.- Yes, it's quite a big scare on in NASA. They' re really worried about it. They're scanning to see if there's any more. J.T.- It must be really big! J.S.- Yes it's a real \"biggin\". I forget what the s ize was, but they did give an estimate that if it hit London, it would wipe out most of Eu rope. J.T.- Well if you had Starship Ezekiel you could go right out there and turn it. J.S.- Yes, if you had Starship Ezekiel, you could g o right out there and de-accelerate it using the field of the craft. Then you could push i t out and away. You may choose not to believe that there is going t o be a pole shift in the near future, but Prof. Searl does, and he is trying to d o something about it. Whether or not the pole shift is coming, his design s for a new style house that will protect its inhabitants would be a boon for ma nkind. His design for the home generator would be the answer to our energy needs w ithout pollution. His Levity Disc, or Inverse G vehicle, as it is now called, would op en the doorway to safe and inexpen- sive space travel as well as opening up efficient f ast transportation here on earth. Whatever Prof. Searl's motives are, he is offering a better future for all mankind. All we have to do is accept it. Page 93"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 In today's world there is an economy that runs thin gs and this economy is based on profit. There is much greed and corruption invol ved. Who among you can say that we as a nation, or for that matter, a world, are li ving in the future that we wanted as a child? Governments have been influenced by the gr eed of big business. Big business runs the world and their prime objective is not the betterment of mankind, rather it is the objective of making more money which translates into power. Thus we are still plagued by wars and unrest. The \"haves\" fighting ag ainst the \"have nots\". No one wants wars, but they have been with us since record ed history with no end in sight. Perhaps in the face of a common threat, such as a p ole shift or another natural catastrophe the world would pull together and ignor e our differences so that we, as people of the earth, could survive and prosper. We should not have to wait for this type of catastrophe or be driven by it. Children are tol d by their parents, \"Get along with each other and stop the fighting. Do something cons tructive for a change!\" We as a people have fallen into the same type of pattern as these children. We all want what the other has. We want to all be first. We want to have more than anybody else has. Some of you will say, \"We need competition to keep from boredom and compla- cency\". I say we have a great task to fulfill in th is world. One that will take all the energy and innovation of everyone in the world. Thi s task is to rise above the greed of the world for the betterment of all not just the fe w. This would not mean giving up anything, only adding to the whole. We know that industry has sometimes held back new p roducts or processes so that they could sell more of what they have for sal e now. Then when the market is saturated, they come out with the new item or proce ss. This way they capitalize on the people rather than providing for them. This slows p rogress immensely. They seem to be building more things with built in obsolescence so they can sell more of the same item. This is most evident in automobiles. We are n o longer in the industrial age but have slipped into an age of making the rich richer and powerful more powerful. Science has made many strides towards the future wi th the space program and in medicine. Most of these strides have been made a s a product of the strife for mili- tary supremacy both on earth and in space. It is ti me to move ahead with a new motive and goal for mankind. We must abandon the fe ars of new products and new ways of doing things. Progress in new fields will i ncrease jobs, not decrease them. The manufacturers of buggy whips fought the new automob iles that would put them out of business, but there are far more people working on automobiles than ever made buggy whips or horse shoes or horse drawn wagons. The sma rt manufacturers changed with the times and benefited from the new products of th e time. In the research that I have done, I have come acros s many people who have had what the scientific community calls free energy dev ices. Some were capable of flight. All were capable of producing energy with no discer nible input. These units all used unconventional means, using existing laws of physic s, to achieve their results. Most of these devices were either destroyed or discredited by the big money that would lose immediate income. The only man who got any press co verage, as biased as it may have been, is John R.R. Searl. There was no denying that his remote controlled Levity Discs were real. There they were, in the air, for a ll to see. There were thousands of feet of film taken of his various crafts in the air duri ng public demonstrations.

It is no surprise to me that he was stopped and an effort made to discredit him and his marvelous work. The work being done today is done in secret because of this. What happened in the past must not be allowed to happen again. The w orld is in trouble and needs this technology badly. Public support and backing is nee ded now. Let us not stay in dark- ness to please and feed the greed of big business a nd corrupt officials who prosper at our expense. We can move into a new age if we choos e it, but we must choose it. It can not be forced upon you. You must want it and pursue it yourself. We have been led by the nose too long. What exactly would the production of the SEG and th e Inverse G Vehicle do for us now? The home SEG generator would supply enough power for the entire home with no need for fuel of any kind. This would mean free electricity for any need or use you choose. This would include heating the home so there would be no need for burn- ing of any fuel. The SEG generator can be made in a ny size required so it could be used for factories and high rises as well as for th e individual home. There would be no need for conventional electric power that is presen tly being generated by the burning of fossil fuels, nuclear fission reactors and water power. To put the SEG to use imme- diately, a large unit could supply an entire city u sing the existing power lines. The SEG could also be incorporated into an automobi le to power an electric motor. This same principle could be incorporated in to any form of transportation ve- hicle on land or sea. This would include trains, su bways, buses, ships, boats and etc.. Anything that can be run with electricity can be ru n on the Searl Effect Generator. Aircraft that is powered by an SEG called an INVERS E-G-VEHICLE would replace the jets of today. Flight times would be cu t drastically using this new vehicle. There would be no sonic booms because of the way th e unit operates. It does not cut through the air but directs it around the craft wit h a field of energy. There would be no need for long runways at the air ports as the Disc can land in an area slightly larger than its diameter. Once inside the craft you are no longer subject to the existing laws of inertia on the earth as you are now within your own sphere of relativity, that is to say you are within your own separate planet. As suc h you will be able to travel at extreme acceleration rates with no side effects. An artificial gravity is formed within the craft of about one half that of earth so comfor t is insured. This holds true for travel outside the earth's atmosphere as well. This is how you will be able to travel to the moon or another planet at extreme speeds with no di scomfort. The need for cranes for lifting objects will no lon ger be needed. Once an object is within the field of the craft it looses its' weight and can be moved easily. This method could be employed to lift extremely heavy items or lift things from hard to get at places much the same as our helicopters do today. There would be many uses for this device as you can see but the most important effect it would have on the earth is that it is pol lution free. Because of the nature of the propulsion system it would actually help \"heal\" the ozone layer that has been damaged. We would be working with nature instead of against nature. It is time we the people of earth started to heal this world and stop destroying it. Page 95"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"PROF. JOHN R.R.
