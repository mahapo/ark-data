The town had organized afire department for the very first time. The firefighters trained hard to learnto work together. But it was the fire pump that everyone wanted to see. It was areally big deal. The pump let firefighters move water from the local river anddirect it onto flames, in order to put out fires quickly.The leaders of the town organized a celebration to show off the fire pump.Everyone in Gospić (say: GAH-spich) put on their best Sunday clothes. Theygathered around when the machine was brought down to the river. There was aceremony, and several people gave speeches. Then came the big moment: ademonstration to show how the pump could spray water.The new machine was painted black and red. It needed sixteen men to work it.They took their positions, turned on the hose, and . . . nothing! No water cameout. The pump didn’t work![../image/nikola_tesla1-10-art2.jpg]None of the grown-ups was sure what to do. But young Nikola (say: NEEK-oh-la)had an idea. “I know what to do, mister,” he told one of the men in charge. “Youkeep pumping.” Nikola jumped into the water and felt for the hose. There was nopressure. He tried to picture the reason in his mind. He thought something mightbe blocking it.Quickly, Nikola found the problem. The hose had bent sharply in one spot andstopped the pressure from pushing the water out. He straightened out the line,and water surged through the hose! The crowd cheered. Many of the people gotwet! But they didn’t mind. Nikola was a hero. They carried him on theirshoulders.[../image/nikola_tesla1-10-art3.jpg]Before Nikola jumped into the river that day in the early 1860s, he didn’t knowanything about fire pumps or water pressure. He just knew there was some reasonthe machine was not working properly—and he knew he could figure out a way tofix it.Nikola never lost his gift for figuring things out. He grew up to be one of themost important inventors in the history of the world! He helped create thetechnology that led to radios and remote-control devices. He imagined cellphones and the Internet many years before anyone heard of such things. Hecreated a motor that helped power machines around the world. And he is mostfamous for helping to bring electricity into homes everywhere.Nikola had a talent for picturing a problem in his mind and figuring out a wayto fix it. Luckily for us, he loved to develop new and better ways of makingthings work."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1LEARNING EXPERIENCESYoung Nikola Tesla was a very smart boy who one day did something not verysmart: He tried to fly. He went out to the barn at his family’s farm carrying anumbrella. He climbed to the roof of the barn, opened the umbrella, and jumpedoff. Not surprisingly, Nikola fell directly to the ground with a thud.Fortunately, he didn’t break any bones. He spent several weeks recovering fromthe fall. Then he was as good as new.[../image/nikola_tesla1-10-art4.jpg]Nikola wasn’t even six years old at the time. There was no such thing as anairplane then. He didn’t know about gravity or lift or the forces that allowthings to fly. He didn’t know it was not possible to fly simply by holding anumbrella in the air! The only thing Nikola knew was that he could picturehimself floating through the air with his umbrella. And if he could picturesomething in his mind, he believed he could make it work.The Tesla family farm where Nikola tried to fly that day was in a village knownas Smiljan. That’s where Nikola had been born in 1856. Smiljan is in what is nowknown as the country of Croatia. But Nikola’s family was Serbian. Serbia is aneighboring country.[../image/page_6.jpg]Nikola’s father was Milutin (say: mil-YOU-tin), the priest in the local SerbianOrthodox Church. Orthodox priests can be married and have children. Milutinwanted Nikola to be a priest just like he was. Nikola’s mother was named Djouka(say: DYOH-kah). She ran the family farm and had never gone to school. Djoukahad never even learned to read or write. Her mother had become blind when Djoukawas still a young girl and—as the eldest daughter in the family—she took overrunning the household. There had been no time for school.[../image/nikola_tesla1-10-art6.jpg]But Djouka was a very intelligent woman who had an incredible memory. Word forword, she could remember stories from the Bible and poems she had heard. Herhusband was an educated man who wrote poetry, owned many books, and spoke Germanand Italian in addition to his native Serbian-Croatian language. Milutinprobably recited many of his books to her.Djouka worked tirelessly from dawn until dark around the farm. She often usedtools that she invented herself, such as a mechanical eggbeater. “I must traceto my mother’s influence whatever inventiveness I possess,” Nikola once wrote.Nikola had two older sisters, Milka and Angelina, and one younger sister,Marica. He also had a brother, Dane, who was seven years older. Tragically, hewas killed in an accident involving the family horse when he was only twelveyears old. Like Nikola, Dane had been very smart.[../image/nikola_tesla1-10-art7.jpg]Nikola’s birthday was July 10. Most accounts say he was born just as the clockstruck midnight, turning July 9 into July 10. Outside, a thunderstorm flashedlightning in the sky.The flare of lightning at his birth was appropriate, because electricity soonfascinated Nikola. When he was three years old, he loved to play with Macak, thefamily cat. One cold, dry day while he stroked Macak’s fur, he saw littlesparks. Nikola was amazed! He didn’t understand what the sparks were at thetime, but he knew he wanted to find out. “It’s electricity,” his fatherexplained. “The same thing you see through trees in a storm.”[../image/nikola_tesla1-10-art8.jpg][../image/nikola_tesla1-10-art9.jpg]Nikola followed his mother’s example by experimenting and coming up with his ownideas. When he was four, he developed his first “invention.” One day, the otherboys in the village went fishing, but they didn’t take Nikola with them.Determined not to miss out on all the fun, Nikola made his own fishing line witha hook on the end of a string. He didn’t have bait to tempt the fish. Hishomemade line didn’t work. But while Nikola was trying to figure out what wentwrong, a frog leaped at the hook. Nikola grabbed him. It turned out that hisfishing line was really a frog-catcher! He returned to the farm with nearly twodozen frogs that day. All the boys in the neighborhood liked to play with frogs.His friends hadn’t caught a single fish! But they were happy to learn Nikola’ssecret for catching frogs.When he was five, Nikola began going to school in the village. He studied math,religion, and German. Outside the classroom, he was always learning, too. Once,when Nikola was playing down by a stream in the village, he noticed a smallslice of a tree trunk shaped like a circle. Nikola cut a hole through the centerof the wood. He found a tree branch and pushed that through the hole. Then herested the ends of the branch on the opposite banks of the stream. The slice ofthe tree trunk was partly in the water. The wheel began to spin! The force ofthe water made the wheel turn round and round. Nikola had taken energy fromnature (the stream) and generated enough power to spin the wheel around![../image/nikola_tesla1-10-art10.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2SCIENTIFIC MIND[../image/nikola_tesla11-20-art11.jpg]The Tesla farm had many types of animals, including chickens, sheep, and geese.Nikola especially liked to watch the geese. In perfect formation, they flew offeach morning to their feeding grounds. In perfect formation, they came back atsundown.It was a shock to seven-year-old Nikola when the family moved to the nearby townof Gospić. His father had been sent there by his church to become the pastor ofthe town’s Orthodox parish. A pastor is the religious leader of a certain regionor community. Gospić was only a few miles away from Smiljan. But for Nikola, itwas a world of difference.Gospić was much bigger than his cozy village had been. And many more peoplelived there. The Tesla family lived in a house in Gospić, not on a farm. Nikolahad loved going into the woods of Smiljan. He liked to play by the stream,experimenting with his waterwheels. But in this new town, Nikola was too shy towander from the house much at all. “I would rather have faced a roaring lionthan one of the city dudes who strolled about,” he said.[../image/nikola_tesla11-20-art12.jpg][../image/nikola_tesla11-20-art13.jpg]But Nikola was required to go to his father’s church every Sunday. He was gladto be given the job of ringing the bells before and after each service. It meantgoing up into the bell tower, called a belfry, away from the “city dudes.”Before the church service began, Nikola would race up the steps to the belfry toring the bell. After the service was over and everyone had left the church, heraced back down the steps.One day, Nikola didn’t realize that not quite everyone had left the church. Awealthy woman in a fancy dress was making her way outside. She had stopped totalk with Milutin. Nikola barreled down the steps, three at a time. He took hislast leap and, to his dismay, saw that he was heading straight for the long edgeof the woman’s dress that trailed behind her as she walked. It was a direct hit.The back of the dress tore off with such a great ripping sound that many of thechurchgoers rushed back inside to see what had happened. The woman was furious.Milutin was embarrassed. And Nikola was in trouble.[../image/nikola_tesla11-20-rev2art14.jpg]After that, Nikola felt as if no one in town wanted to even talk to him! Heworried about it for a long time. He didn’t feel forgiven until he became thehero of the day for being smart enough to fix the hose on the new fire pump.In Gospić, Nikola completed his elementary schooling during the day. At night,he read the books in his father’s library. “Of all things, I liked books thebest,” he said. Nikola would stay up late into the night reading. His fatherthought Nikola was going to ruin his eyesight. Milutin thought that maybe Nikolaliked books a little too much! He took away the candles Nikola needed to read atnight.[../image/nikola_tesla11-20-revart3-15.jpg]So Nikola went to his room and made his own candles. He blocked the spaceunderneath the door and the keyhole so no light could be seen from the outside.Sometimes, he stayed up all night reading, until his mother began her morningchores.In one book, Nikola read about a place in North America called Niagara Falls.Nikola pictured in his mind a giant waterwheel like the one he had built in hissmall village stream. He pictured it at the base of Niagara Falls. If his littlehomemade waterwheel could work, how much power could a huge wheel powered by theFalls make! Even then, he was imagining technology that didn’t yet exist.[../image/nikola_tesla11-20-art16.jpg]Nikola showed his uncle Josip a picture of Niagara Falls. One day, Nikola toldhis uncle, he would travel to America and make his idea work.When he was ten years old, Nikola entered the Real Gymnasium in town. In Europe,a gymnasium is another name for a school. Real Gymnasium was Nikola’s middleschool. The way Nikola did math problems in his head amazed his teachers. Theythought he might be cheating. He wasn’t, though. When Nikola was given aproblem, he easily saw the solution in his mind. To him, visualizing figures inhis head was no different than working them out on the board or a piece ofpaper.[../image/nikola_tesla11-20-art18.jpg]NIAGARA FALLSNiagara Falls is on the border between Canada and the state of New York in theUnited States. It was formed when glaciers melted at the end of the last IceAge, about twelve thousand years ago.Niagara Falls is actually three waterfalls named the Horseshoe Falls, theAmerican Falls, and the Bridal Veil Falls. The Horseshoe Falls is the highest(167 feet) and the widest (2,600 feet). Together, the three waterfalls drop3,160 tons of water every second![../image/nikola_tesla11-20-art17.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3HIS OWN PATHIn 1866, when Nikola started at Real Gymnasium, it was a “new and fairly wellequipped institution,” he said. Its classrooms had scientific equipment that wasmodern for the times. Nikola liked it most when his teachers conductedelectrical and mechanical experiments. He enjoyed his four years there, and hecompleted the program with high marks. The town leaders in Gospić wereimpressed. After graduation, they asked him to make a list of all the books theyhad in the local library.[../image/nikola_tesla11-20-revart3-19.jpg][../image/nikola_tesla11-20-art20.jpg]Before Nikola could get the job done, though, he became very sick. He was forcedto stay in bed for weeks at a time. His doctors feared he might die. Nikolaspent his time reading books from the library. One day, he discovered acollection of books by Mark Twain. His stories made Nikola laugh. He enjoyedthem so much they almost made him forget how sick he was! Mark Twain’s bookshelped Nikola make “the miraculous recovery that followed,” he said.MARK TWAIN (1835–1910)Mark Twain is the pen name of Samuel Clemens, an American author and humoristwho wrote twenty-eight books and many short stories and essays. At the height ofhis career, Twain was one of the most famous men in the world.[../image/nikola_tesla21-30-revart21.jpg]His two best-known novels are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and Adventuresof Huckleberry Finn (1884).[../image/nikola_tesla21-30-art22.jpg][../image/nikola_tesla21-30-art23.jpg]In 1870, after Nikola had recovered, he moved to the city of Karlovac to livewith his aunt and uncle. He attended the Higher Real Gymnasium (high school)there. Unfortunately, Karlovac was a swampy area with lots of mosquitoes. Nikolahadn’t been there long before he became sick again. This time he had malaria—aninfection caused by mosquito bites.Nikola’s aunt and uncle took care of him, and he got better. He liked his auntand uncle, but he liked school even more! And as usual, when Nikola likedsomething, he threw himself into it completely. He worked so hard that it tookhim only three years to finish the four-year program.At Higher Real Gymnasium, he was especially impressed with his science classesand science experiments. Every time his professor finished an experiment,Nikola’s mind raced with a thousand questions.[../image/nikola_tesla21-30-art24.jpg]Nikola decided he wanted to learn everything he could. He wanted to do his ownresearch. His mind was made up. He was going to become an electrical engineer.An engineer is someone who designs or builds engines. An electrical engineerdesigns or builds them to work with electricity. He had just one problem,though: His father still wanted him to become a priest. Nikola knew that Milutinwouldn’t like it, but he needed to choose his own career path.Nikola thought it was best to return to Gospić and break the news to Milutin andDjouka. But when Nikola wrote to them, his parents told him not to come. That’sstrange, Nikola thought. He figured they would be happy he had finished hisstudies a year early. Milutin encouraged him to go on a long hunting trip withsome friends. That’s really strange, Nikola thought. A hunting trip was notsomething that would interest him, and his parents knew it.[../image/nikola_tesla21-30-art25.jpg]So Nikola traveled the ninety miles to Gospić. What his parents hadn’t told himwas there was a cholera epidemic in town at the time. Cholera is a seriousillness that is caused by bacteria. It is very contagious. And in Nikola’s time,it often was deadly.On his very first day home, Nikola got cholera! He spent the next nine months inbed, and it appeared he would not survive. His parents, who already had losttheir son Dane, were stricken with grief. What could they do?Nikola was near death one day, and his father rushed to his side. “Perhaps I mayget well if you will let me study engineering,” Nikola said.His father begged his son to fight for his life. “You will be an engineer,”Milutin told him. “Do you hear me? You will go to the best engineering school inthe world and you will be a great engineer.”Nikola knew his father meant what he said. And with that to look forward to, hestarted getting better almost immediately. Less than a week later, he wassitting up in bed. Less than a week after that, he was walking around. He soonrecovered, then spent the next year getting stronger.[../image/nikola_tesla21-30-art26.jpg]In September 1875, when he was nineteen, Nikola traveled to Graz, Austria, morethan two hundred miles from his home. He began his studies in engineering atPolytechnic Institute, now known as Graz University of Technology.[../image/nikola_tesla21-30-art27.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4SCHOOL DAYS[../image/nikola_tesla21-30-art28.jpg]Nikola—as always—worked tirelessly at Polytechnic Institute. On a typical day,he woke up at three o’clock in the morning. He didn’t go to bed until eleveno’clock at night—twenty hours later! Even then, he didn’t go right to sleep, butread until he nodded off. Throughout his entire life, Nikola claimed he sleptonly about two to three hours a night.Nikola needed all those waking hours. In his first year at the university, hetook nine courses, four more than was normal. He studied math, physics, botany,chemistry, and several languages. He never missed a lecture, got the highestgrades possible in all of his classes, and even started a school club on Serbianculture. His teachers worried that he was going to overwork himself. One of hisprofessors wrote to Milutin back in Gospić, saying, “Your son is a star of thefirst rank,” but making it clear that Nikola was endangering his health byworking too much and sleeping too little.In his second year at Polytechnic Institute, Nikola concentrated on engineering,limiting his classes to physics, mechanics, and math. On his own time, hestudied machines such as dynamos, which produce electricity, and motors, whichproduce motion or power.Early in Nikola’s second year, a machine arrived at the university from Paris.Nikola’s professor demonstrated it to the class. The machine forced anelectrical current to move in only one direction, called direct current (DC).Nikola argued that it would be better to let the current flow back and forthbecause direct current loses more and more power the farther away it gets fromits source. A back-and-forth current could keep its same level of powerthroughout the system. This was called alternating current (AC). It was nothingnew, but no one had yet figured out how to make alternating current power amotor.[../image/nikola_tesla21-30-rev2art29.jpg]AC/DCCurrent is the flow of an electric charge through a wire. In a direct current(DC), the charge moves in only one direction. In an alternating current (AC),the charge reverses direction, traveling back and forth across the wire.[../image/nikola_tesla21-30-art30_2.jpg]Direct currentThis is important because the voltage (the intensity of the electrical current)of alternating current can be controlled and regulated by a transformer. Thevoltage stays the same in direct current, but only over a short distance.Alternating current, then, is more useful. A transformer can take a less intenseAC current and turn it into a high-voltage current to travel a long distance. Atthe end of that distance, a transformer can turn the high-voltage current backinto a low-voltage current for safe use in homes and businesses.[../image/nikola_tesla21-30-art30.jpg]Alternating current[../image/nikola_tesla31-40-art31.jpg]Nikola’s professor devoted an entire lecture to why Nikola’s theory could notwork. “Mr. Tesla will accomplish great things, but he certainly never will dothis,” he said, speaking about the superiority of DC.At first, Nikola figured he must be wrong because the professor had to know moreabout machines than he did. But the more he thought about it, the more hebelieved he was right. “I could not demonstrate my belief at that time,” hesaid, “but it came to me through what I might call instinct.” Once again, Nikolawas smart enough to see things that others couldn’t![../image/nikola_tesla31-40-art32.jpg]Nikola began building complete machines in his mind. He imagined every nut,bolt, coil, and brush. “The images I saw were perfectly real,” he said. Heworked on his theory the rest of his second year at the university. But he couldnot make it work. He became frustrated. In his third year at PolytechnicInstitute, Nikola stopped regularly attending his lectures. Then, he dropped outof school.[../image/nikola_tesla31-40-art33.jpg]In 1879, Milutin died at age sixty. Nikola knew that his father had wanted himto finish school. But he needed to work to help support his mother. He decidedthat he wouldn’t go back to school, and Nikola never earned a college degree."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5COMING TO AMERICANikola immediately began looking for work. His uncle Pajo told him about afriend in Budapest, Hungary. The friend, Uncle Pajo said, was building atelephone exchange. In the early days of the telephone, callers were connectedto each other by an operator. The operator pushed electrical cords into slots ona board to make the connection. The machine was called a switchboard. A wholenetwork of switchboards made up a telephone exchange.[../image/nikola_tesla31-40-art34.jpg]Nikola left for Budapest. When he arrived, he found out there was no telephoneexchange. His uncle’s friend was still trying to build it! There was no job forNikola. Instead, Nikola went to work for the local telegraph office.[../image/nikola_tesla31-40-art35.jpg]Telegraph machineEventually, the telephone exchange was built. Nikola worked as its chiefengineer. He made many improvements to the company’s equipment, even impressingthe inventor of the machinery himself. But Nikola was still more interested infiguring out how to perfect his alternating-current theory.He imagined a world in which his AC invention powered machines in every factoryand in every home. In the early 1880s, very few places had electricity. Not manypeople understood this mysterious current. It seemed like magic, or likesomething out of a science-fiction book. Nikola could see a future in whichalternating current made electricity an everyday part of life. His AC motorwould make that a reality—if he could just make it work!In February 1882, Nikola was walking in a park in Budapest with a friend. He wasreciting poetry when he stopped in his tracks. “See my engine here!” heexclaimed to his friend. “Watch me reverse it!”[../image/nikola_tesla31-40-art36.jpg]His friend had no idea what Nikola was talking about. He meant that he could nowimagine using magnets to reverse the direction of an electric current so thatthey could produce a turning force in a motor! Nikola excitedly began scratchingin the dirt with a stick. He was drawing what had appeared in his mind: theplans for what would become a kind of alternating-current motor called aninduction motor.[../image/nikola_tesla31-40-art37.jpg]It could be done. Nikola had been right all along. His professor had been wrong.Nikola was very excited. “For a while I gave myself up entirely to the intenseenjoyment of picturing machines,” he said. Over the next two months, he imaginedall the designs for an alternating-current system—every nut and bolt, fordynamos, motors, transformers, and more.In April that year, Nikola went to work for the Compagnie Continentale Edison inParis. It was the French office of the Continental Edison Company, which hadbeen created by the great American inventor Thomas Alva Edison. One of Nikola’sjobs was installing a lighting system at the Paris Opera House. He traveled towork on other lighting systems in Germany and France, too. All of them were DCelectrical systems, the only system in use at the time.[../image/nikola_tesla31-40-revart38.jpg]In his spare time, Nikola finally built a model of the AC motor he hadenvisioned months earlier. It worked—just as he knew it would. However, he couldnot find anyone willing to invest the money he needed to build an entire system.No one but Nikola seemed to realize how important it was.[../image/nikola_tesla31-40-art40.jpg]THOMAS ALVA EDISON (1847–1931)[../image/nikola_tesla31-40-revart39.jpg]Thomas Edison was an American inventor and businessman. In a long career thatbegan when he started his first business in 1869, he created hundreds ofinventions.Nicknamed “The Wizard of Menlo Park” (Menlo Park was the town in New Jerseywhere his laboratory was located), his inventions were among the most importantin the world. He created the first practical lightbulb and the phonograph, theworld’s first record player. He also worked to improve other inventions such asthe motion-picture camera and the typewriter. Edison’s work helped change theway people live.One of Nikola’s bosses in Paris was sent by the company to work for ThomasEdison in New York. He suggested that Nikola do the same. So Nikola made plansto travel by boat to the United States. But shortly before leaving Paris, he wasrobbed of his money and most of his luggage.Nikola arrived in New York on June 6, 1884, with four cents in his pocket and anote of introduction from Tivadar Puskás, a Hungarian inventor, to give toThomas Edison. “I know two great men, and you are one of them,” Puskás wrote toEdison. “The other is this young man.”[../image/nikola_tesla41-50-art41_rev.jpg]Thomas Edison hired Nikola to work at Edison Machine Works and nicknamed him“the Parisian.” He was impressed by Nikola’s dedication to his work. In fact,his long hours were much like Edison’s. Edison was famous for working around theclock, sometimes stopping only to nap in his clothes for a few hours right inhis laboratory.One day, Edison was leaving the office at five o’clock in the morning afterworking all night. “Here is our Parisian running around at night,” Edison joked.But Nikola wasn’t running around. He had spent the entire night fixing thedynamos—the electricity generators—Edison’s company had installed on board aship called the SS Oregon. It was one of the first ships with an electriclighting system. Edison was very impressed.Not long after, Edison gave Nikola the task of redesigning the company’sdirect-current generators—the machines that actually produced all of theirelectricity. It was a huge job that involved designing more than twentydifferent machines. If Nikola could do it, he was told, he would be paid a$50,000 bonus![../image/nikola_tesla41-50-rev2art42.jpg]A ship worker adjusting the dynamo on the SS OregonNikola worked from ten thirty in the morning until five o’clock the next morningevery day for nearly a year. When he finally completed the work, Edison toldNikola that he had been kidding! Talk of the big bonus was all just a joke. “Youdon’t understand our American humor,” Edison said. Nikola didn’t find it veryfunny. He had worked day and night to redesign the generators.Nikola knew it was time to leave Edison Machine Works.[../image/nikola_tesla41-50-revart3-43.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6FAME AND FORTUNE[../image/nikola_tesla41-50-art44.jpg]The mid-1880s were an exciting time in New York City. Skyscrapers were beingbuilt. The Statue of Liberty arrived as a gift from France in 1885. And parts ofManhattan were being lit by the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of NewYork.It was a difficult time for Nikola, however. He was unemployed and broke. He wasalso alone. His family was halfway around the world. He needed to find a way toput food on the table. Nikola wondered if all his years studying science andmechanics, reading books, and endlessly working through problems in his mind hadbeen a waste of time.Then Nikola got the chance to earn two dollars per day digging ditches. Itturned out to be his big break! The foreman on the job overheard Nikola talkingabout his AC motor. He said he knew a man who was an expert electrician. Thatman’s name was Alfred Brown.[../image/nikola_tesla41-50-art45.jpg]When Mr. Brown met Nikola, he was impressed by Nikola’s ideas on alternatingcurrent. Together with a lawyer named Charles Peck, Brown and Tesla formed theTesla Electric Company. They opened a laboratory in New York City in autumn1886, and worked to develop patents on alternating-current technology. A patentprotects the inventor from someone else copying the idea. It creates anauthentic record of the date, time, and place of each invention.[../image/nikola_tesla41-50-rev46.jpg]That same year, the US government granted Nikola his first patents. In 1888, hepresented his system of alternating-current motors and transformers to theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers at Columbia University in New York.As usual, he had a clear vision for the future of electricity before anyone elsedid.[../image/nikola_tesla41-50-revart47.jpg]George WestinghouseNikola’s patented ideas got the attention of George Westinghouse, the owner ofthe Westinghouse Electric Company. George was a direct competitor of ThomasEdison’s. Nikola explained how his patents could beat Edison in the electricitybusiness.Edison had brought electricity to parts of Manhattan in 1882, but most Americanswere still more than forty years away from having electricity. They still usedgas lamps and candles to light their homes. Direct current couldn’t travel veryfar before losing power, so Edison’s DC system required many, many power plants.Nikola’s AC system could supply electricity to thousands of people with a singlepower plant.[../image/nikola_tesla41-50-art48.jpg]George Westinghouse wanted to buy Nikola’s alternating-current patents. Thatgave him the right to use Nikola’s ideas as if they were his own. Westinghouseoffered a huge amount for the patents. Some reports say Tesla received about$60,000 for nearly 30 patents. That’s about $1.5 million in today’s money!Nikola also was to receive payments—called royalties—every time the technologywas used in a new system.[../image/nikola_tesla41-50-art49.jpg]Only a few days before his thirty-second birthday in 1888, Nikola acceptedWestinghouse’s offer. Suddenly, he was a rich man! He sent money home to hismother and his sisters. And he paid the men who had helped him set up the TeslaCompany. Nikola had enough left over to do what he really wanted: go back to hislab and work on his ideas.Nikola had been living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, trying to help theWestinghouse Company make his technology work. But in 1889, he returned to NewYork. He opened a new laboratory on Grand Street and moved into the fancy AstorHouse hotel in New York City.[../image/nikola_tesla41-50-art50.jpg]Nikola invited celebrities and scientists to watch demonstrations of hisexperiments. He was quite a showman in the lab. He amazed his guests withdemonstrations that looked like magic. In one, he held a glass tube in one handand a wire coursing with alternating current in the other. The current traveledacross his body and into the tube, making it glow with a beautiful light![../image/nikola_tesla51-60-art52.jpg]ASTOR HOUSEAstor House was the first luxury hotel in New York. It was built of granite andtook up an entire block on Broadway. It had more than three hundred guest roomson its six floors. And every floor had a bath and toilet—an incredible luxury atthe time.Astor House was built by John Jacob Astor, a wealthy American businessman, in1836. Eighteen different US presidents stayed there, including Abraham Lincoln,who stopped over for one night on the way to his inauguration in 1861.Astor House closed in 1913.[../image/nikola_tesla51-60-art51.jpg]Nikola worked on many ideas in his New York lab, including something called theTesla coil. The Tesla coil took a low-voltage alternating current and built itup to a very high-voltage current. Then it released that intense current througha spark that looked like lightning. The spark created an electrical field allaround it.[../image/nikola_tesla51-60-art53.jpg]Nikola’s amazing imagination was the key to his genius. It made him differentfrom just about every other engineer. Most inventors build a model of a machineand tinker with it until it works. Nikola, however, first pictured the machinein his mind, down to the very smallest details and exact measurements. Hementally conducted trial operations. He was even able to inspect the machineweeks later, simply by imagining any wear and tear! Only when he absolutely knewit could work did he actually build it.[../image/nikola_tesla51-60-rev2art55.jpg]Much of the time, Nikola worked by himself. But he was not a loner. He not onlyinvited people to his laboratory, he also entertained groups of importantscientists at dinner parties. He had many friends who were not scientists, too,including some of the most famous people of his time, such as writers Mark Twainand Rudyard Kipling, and John Jacob Astor IV, the great-grandson of the man whobuilt the Astor House.THE QUIRKY INVENTORNikola lived alone for many years. He worked very long hours. And he developedsome unique habits.He only slept two hours each day—but he made sure to find time to do his toecurls in the evenings. He believed that one hundred toe curls for each foothelped the brain.He avoided coffee, tea, and tobacco.He ate dinner at exactly the same time every night: 8:10 p.m. After each meal,he wiped every dish and piece of silverware with a clean napkin.Late in life, he would eat only milk, honey, and bread, and drink only vegetablejuice.Strangely, Nikola could not stand the sight of pearls. He would never touchanother person’s hair. And he was so afraid of germs that he tried not to shakehands with anyone—ever![../image/nikola_tesla51-60-art54.jpg]Nikola always dressed well at his dinner parties. He insisted on wearing whitegloves and a good suit. He believed a person needed to look successful to besuccessful.Women were very attracted to the blue-eyed genius who stood over six feet tall.Nikola never married, though. He didn’t believe an inventor could devote enoughattention to his work if he also had a wife. He once told a newspaper reporterthat having a wife would take too much time and energy away from an inventor’sduty. But then he added, “It’s a pity, too, for sometimes we feel so lonely.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7WAR OF THE CURRENTSIn 1890, the Westinghouse Corporation was in trouble. It was losing money.To help his friend George Westinghouse, Nikola did something remarkable: He toreup the royalty clause in his contract. That meant he would never earn more moneyfrom Westinghouse. Nikola didn’t mind. He was more interested in his inventionshelping people get electricity than in making more money.[../image/nikola_tesla51-60-art56rev.jpg]Nikola’s partnership with Westinghouse was a big problem for Thomas Edison. Atthe time, very few homes in the United States had electricity. The average citymight have had streetlamps. But people in the countryside wouldn’t have evenseen them yet. Electrical lines had not yet been set up. There was no way tocarry electricity over great distances from the generators. But it was clearthat whatever company could find a way to bring electricity to homes in theUnited States was going to make a lot of money.Nikola and Westinghouse believed alternating current was the best method. Itcould travel great distances at high voltage from a large power plant, then betransformed to a lower, safer voltage for homes. Since direct current couldn’tbe transformed, it could only travel short distances at a safe voltage. Directcurrent would require a small power plant to be built every mile or so.[../image/nikola_tesla51-60-revart58.jpg]Thomas Edison had already started building those power plants. His first DCpower station had opened in New York City in 1882. He knew if AC becamestandard, he would lose a lot of money on his direct-current stations. So hetried to convince the public that using alternating current—Tesla’s big idea—wasa bad and dangerous thing. He worked hard to spread the lie.[../image/nikola_tesla51-60-art59.jpg]Edison distributed thousands of pamphlets that said alternating current wasdeadly. And horribly, he teamed up with an electrical engineer to electrocutestray dogs with alternating current. And it worked. Investors and publicofficials became scared of the AC technology. Nikola knew that anyelectricity—alternating current or direct current—could be dangerous. How couldhe and Westinghouse prove AC was just as safe as DC?[../image/nikola_tesla51-60-art60.jpg]In 1891, the year Nikola became a citizen of the United States, he gave anotherlecture before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on alternatingcurrent. The next year, he gave talks in London and Paris. While in Paris in1892, Nikola received a telegram from his uncle Petar saying that his mother wassick. “I made the long journey home without an hour of rest,” Nikola said. Hismother died several weeks later on April 4.Back in the United States, George Westinghouse scored a huge victory by winningthe contract to power the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.Westinghouse got the job because he offered to provide the electricity for lessmoney than Edison did. The first all-electric fair in history was the bestchance to show the world that alternating current was safe and effective.[../image/nikola_tesla61-70-art61.jpg][../image/nikola_tesla61-70-art62.jpg]More than two hundred thousand lightbulbs showcased the power of alternatingcurrent at the Columbian Exposition. In the Great Hall of Electricity, Nikolawowed onlookers with demonstrations like the ones he had given in his New YorkCity laboratory.WORLD’S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITIONThe World’s Columbian Exposition, sometimes called the Chicago World’s Fair, washeld from May 1 to October 30, 1893. It celebrated the four hundredthanniversary of Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the New World in 1492.Nearly two hundred temporary buildings were erected over more than six hundredacres to house 65,000 exhibitors from all over the world! Fourteen buildingssurrounded a giant pool that represented Columbus’s voyage from Spain.More than 25 million people attended the fair. There were thousands of fun andinteresting exhibits. And there were also many new products on display,including Cracker Jack popcorn, Juicy Fruit gum, and Shredded Wheat cereal. Andup to 38,000 people a day—more than 1.4 million people in all by the end of thefair—rode the world’s first Ferris wheel.[../image/nikola_tesla61-70-art63.jpg]By the end of the six-month exposition, Westinghouse had won over the public.Visitors to the fair could see for themselves how safe and useful the AC lightswere. Alternating current soon became the standard technology for deliveringelectricity to consumers in the United States.[../image/nikola_tesla61-70-art64.jpg]But winning over the public was only a part of the battle in the war of ACversus DC. Actually getting electricity into people’s homes would be the moredifficult part. Nikola looked to Niagara Falls for answers. Ever since Nikolaread about Niagara Falls as a boy, he had been intrigued by hydroelectricity—theforce of falling or flowing water to produce power. The rushing force of thefast-moving water turns a wheel called a turbine. The spinning turbine turns ametal shaft in the motor that generates electricity.Other scientists and engineers long had talked about using the power of NiagaraFalls to create electrical energy. However, nothing had ever come of it. Thesuccess of AC technology at the World’s Columbian Exposition convinced stateofficials in New York that it just might work. Before the exposition was over,they had awarded Westinghouse Corporation a contract to build turbines andgenerators for Niagara Falls using Nikola’s patents and alternating-currenttechnology![../image/nikola_tesla61-70-art65.jpg]The first generator was tested in April 1895. The next year, the world’s firstlarge-scale hydroelectric power plant officially opened. It immediately begandelivering electric power to Buffalo, New York, around twenty miles away. Withinjust a few years, the range extended all the way to New York City, a distance ofover four hundred miles!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8WIRELESS DREAMS[../image/nikola_tesla61-70-revart66.jpg]Alexander Graham BellNow the East Coast had light! And Nikola had helped open the door to theavailability of electrical power for people throughout the United States. By1925, half of all Americans would be living in the modern age of electricity.Long before then, however, Nikola turned his attention to his next goal:wireless communication.The telephone had been invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, but it neededwires, of course.[../image/nikola_tesla61-70-art67.jpg]Samuel F. B. MorseAnd even before Nikola was born, people had been able to communicate longdistances by sending signals over a wire. A machine at one end could send anelectrical current to a receiver at the other end. The receiver could take theseries of short taps (called “dots”) and longer taps (“dashes”) and use a codeto translate them into words. This machine was the telegraph, and the code wasthe Morse code. It was named for American Samuel F. B. Morse, an inventor of thetelegraph.But what about the places where there were no wires? What if a ship in themiddle of the ocean needed help and wanted to signal ashore? Nikola knew thatthe air is filled with invisible electromagnetic waves called radio waves.Instead of using wires to carry those signals of dots and dashes, Nikolapictured using radio waves to carry them.In 1895, just as thirty-nine-year-old Nikola was preparing to transmit a signalby radio waves for a distance of fifty miles, Guglielmo Marconi sent andreceived his first signals without wires and was awarded a patent for radiotechnology! Nikola had been so close to perfecting his transmissions. But a firehad ruined his New York laboratory.[../image/nikola_tesla61-70-art68.jpg]Guglielmo MarconiNikola had been giving lectures about using radio waves to send messages andsound since the early 1890s. He demonstrated a remote-controlled boat usingradio waves in New York in 1898. The people who watched it were amazed! Nikolahad to take the boat apart to show there were no tricks hidden inside.[../image/nikola_tesla61-70-art69.jpg][../image/nikola_tesla61-70-art70.jpg]Nikola talked about a wireless world in which “we shall be able to communicatewith each other instantly, irrespective of distance.” And the device? “A manwill be able to carry one in his vest pocket.” How right Nikola was! That soundslike a modern cell phone!Nikola had missed his chance to be the first to send a wireless signal a longdistance. But why stop at sending a small amount of information such as themessage Marconi sent? Why not use those waves to send large amounts ofinformation? Information such as pictures, music, and voices. That sounds a lotlike the Internet!As usual, Nikola’s ideas were way ahead of his time. But technology had to catchup to those ideas first. To help create the technology, he conducted bigger andbigger experiments. And Nikola’s high-voltage, high-frequency experiments werebecoming too large and too dangerous for his New York City lab.In 1899, Nikola moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he built a largelaboratory. It included a gigantic Tesla coil fifty-two feet in diameter! Itcreated an enormous electrical field that allowed Nikola to light lamps manymiles away without wires.[../image/nikola_tesla71-80-rev2art71.jpg]In 1900, Nikola returned to New York. He built a 187-foot-high tower at his labon Long Island, in an area called Wardenclyffe. He hoped the tower would be thefirst to send signals—and power—wirelessly to anywhere in the world.[../image/nikola_tesla71-80-art72.jpg]Wardenclyffe TowerNikola’s plan for Wardenclyffe didn’t work. In 1905, he was forced to close downhis laboratory.[../image/nikola_tesla71-80-art74.jpg]Nikola was still only forty-nine years old. But after Wardenclyffe closed, heseemed to disappear from the scientific community. In May 1917, though, he waspresented the Edison Medal, the highest honor presented by the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers. In 1919, Nikola wrote the first of a seriesof articles for Electrical Experimenter magazine. An editor later combined thearticles into a Tesla autobiography called My Inventions.Nikola continued to work on projects that interested him. In 1920, he designed atype of aircraft that could take off vertically like a helicopter but would flylike an airplane. It was only a design, but, like everything else, Nikola wascertain it would work because he already had “tested” it in his mind. Onceagain, Nikola was ahead of his time. Years later, a very similar aircraft wasbuilt by the US military.WHO INVENTED RADIO?[../image/nikola_tesla71-80-art73.jpg]Guglielmo MarconiAt 12:30 p.m. on December 12, 1901, Italian inventor and electrical engineerGuglielmo Marconi listened intently on his earphone at a desk in Newfoundland,Canada. He heard a series of three dots. That is the Morse code for the letters. The message had been sent from a transmitting station Marconi built inCornwall, England, more than two thousand miles away. It was the first radiotransmission to cross the Atlantic Ocean.Marconi formed a wireless telegraph company and began improving his ability tosend messages via radio signal. But his transmitters needed a Tesla coil towork.Nikola sued Marconi a couple of years later for using his technology. The USPatent Office ruled in Nikola’s favor in 1903. But it reversed its decision in1904. Marconi is credited as the inventor of radio transmission, although infact it was a combined effort of many people, especially Nikola Tesla.As he got older, Nikola lived a more solitary life. He spent his days takinglong walks in New York and feeding the pigeons in Bryant Park. He moved fromhotel to hotel—sometimes because the maids complained about the pigeons hebrought back to the room, and sometimes because he was unable to pay the bills.[../image/nikola_tesla71-80-art75.jpg][../image/nikola_tesla71-80-art76.jpg]Finally, the Westinghouse Corporation, perhaps out of gratitude for when Nikolatore up his royalty contract many years before, agreed to pay for his room atthe Hotel New Yorker.On his birthday each year, Nikola invited reporters to the hotel to talk abouthis new ideas and plans. But his ideas were getting stranger and stranger. Oneyear, he talked about a “death ray” machine that he believed would end all wars.Another year, he spoke about his contact with other planets. He also hinted at amajor new power source he might be developing.[../image/nikola_tesla71-80-art77.jpg]Because his decision to tear up his royalty contract with Westinghouse cost himmillions of dollars, Nikola was broke. When he died at age eighty-six in 1943,he was also alone. His decision not to get married meant that he had no familyat his side.Even though this sounds like a very sad ending, Nikola’s reputation grew afterhis death, and people began to honor him for his brilliance and his manyscientific developments.In 1943, a US Supreme Court decision confirmed that Nikola had contributed tothe invention of radio. In 1960, a unit of measurement (to describe the strengthof a magnetic field) was named the tesla. And in 1975, Nikola was inducted intothe National Inventors Hall of Fame. He was honored on a US postage stamp in1983. His face appeared on both the five-dinar bill and the five-million-dinarbill in Yugoslavia, as well as the Serbian hundred-dinar bill.[../image/nikola_tesla71-80-art78.jpg][../image/nikola_tesla71-80-art79.jpg]Tesla coils are on display in places such as the Griffith Observatory in LosAngeles and the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. Tesla, Inc. is a lineof luxury electric cars named in his honor. Many modern technological advances,like cell phones, Internet, GPS, radio, television, radar, and neon signs, arebuilt on Nikola’s groundbreaking work and ideas.Part creative genius, part mad scientist, and completely ahead of his time,Nikola Tesla made the electric age possible.[../image/nikola_tesla71-80-art80rev.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"TIMELINE OF NIKOLA TESLA’S LIFE1856 — Nikola Tesla is born on July 10 in Smiljan, in what is modern-day Croatia1870 — Moves to Karlovac and begins studying at Higher Real Gymnasium1882 — Invents alternating-current motor1884 — Moves to New York and begins working for Thomas Edison1885 — Applies for his first US patent, on an improved arc lamp1888 — Sells alternating-current patents to George Westinghouse1891 — Becomes a US citizen1893 — Working with the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, provides electricityfor the Columbian Exposition (the World’s Fair) in Chicago1895 — The power station he designed at Niagara Falls begins operating1896 — Patents inventions relating to radio1898 — Demonstrates remote-controlled boat in New York City1907 — Elected to the New York Academy of Sciences1917 — Receives 1916 Edison Medal from the American Institute of ElectricalEngineers1919 — Begins writing his autobiography, My Inventions, in ElectricalExperimenter magazine1943 — Dies of a heart attack in New York City on January 7"},{"pageContent":"TIMELINE OF THE WORLD1860 — Abraham Lincoln is elected the sixteenth president of the United States1861 — The American Civil War begins, and lasts until 18651876 — Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone1877 — Thomas Edison invents the phonograph1880 — Wabash, Indiana, becomes the first American city to use electricstreetlights1886 — The Statue of Liberty is dedicated in New York1892 — Ellis Island opens in New York Harbor1903 — The Wright brothers fly a plane at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina1912 — The ocean liner Titanic sinks on its first voyage1914 — World War I begins in Europe, and lasts until 19181919 — A major flu epidemic, which began in 1918, kills as many as fifty millionpeople worldwide1929 — The New York stock market crashes, and the Great Depression begins1932 — Franklin Delano Roosevelt is elected president of the United States forthe first of a record four terms1941 — The United States enters World War II after Pearl Harbor in Hawaii isattacked"},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHY*Books for young readersCarlson, W.
