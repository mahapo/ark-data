[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"PowerPedia:Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity From PESWiki The following is alternative informatio n pertaining to the Dynamic Theory of Gravity published at Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/w iki/Dynamic_theory_of_gravity). This Dynamic Theory of Gravity neither appears nor is mentioned anywhere in standard Tesla informative sites and is still classified, with literally thousands and thousands of other pages he wrote. Luckily, through his collected articles and lectures one can still catch his re ferences to his mainstream work and dream, which was, contrary to what many believe, the development of an ultimate flying machine (check \"My In ventions\"). The typical misinformation is that his flying machine was an aerodynamic one, due to a patent on a VTOL aircraft he presented (\"method of aerial transportation Jan 3, 1928\") which even if unique and first of it's kind, was not his real \"Flivver\". The \"veritable rope of air\" he refers to in one of his interv iews was a direct analogy to the ether carriers bringing in \"tubes of force\" to maintain his flying machine exactly where he wanted it or to move it in any direction at incredible speed and incredible acceleration. It is imperative to understand Tesla's life as a \"whole\", not only study his work. He was continuously busy with further developing his theories and bringing them into practi ce and would not be satisfied until he reached a practical status. His rotating magnetic field or \"alternator\" coupled with his bladeless turbine and his high vo ltage coils were all developed for this p urpose. He said himself, while he was at college that he conceived of this flying machine, but had not yet discove red a way to power and propel it (a \"prime mover of sufficiently great activ ity\"). He took his first step with his rotating magnetic field and understo od intuitively that the laws of electromagnetics were somehow connected to gravity: the passage from Goethe's Faust clearly spells it out. On that occasion , he not only solved his alternating magnetic field problem, but took the first step into understanding \"nature's wheelwork\". Amaz ingly, when he arrived in the U.S.---after being robbed of his money and suit case---he still had in his possession, tightly kept under his arm, his drawings not only of his AC motor (which he had built and tested in Paris prior to his departure), but most importantly drawings and plans for his flying machine. Tesla said he had fully developed his Dynamic Theory of Gravity and \"worked it out in all its details\" in 1893-94. This ether-based theory explained gravity and directly linked it to electromagnetic phenomena, explaining also that the sun and all stars emit \"primary solar rays\" (which produce secondary radiations). Tesla demonstrated that a ll bodies have electrical content and as such, are all moving charges as our earth hurls through space at incredible speed (hence 'dynamic'). He demonstrated, through the use of his particular evacuated tubes and high voltage coils powered by special HF alternators, how earth emanates \"microwaves\" and how it behaves as a charged sphere. Based on these discoveries and their confirmatio n at Colorado Springs, he developed and tested his first electromagnetic flying machine that could fly \"devoid of Pa g e 1 of 4 PowerPedia:Tesla's D y namic Theor y of Gravit y -PESWiki 14.8.2005 mhtml:file://C:\\PowerPediaTesla's%20D y namic%20Theor y %20of%20Gravit y %20-%2..."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"sustaining wings, propellers or gas bags\". It is important to understand Tesla's ether concept which was unique. Tesla's ether is in fact a medium, \"a perfect fl uid\" that wets everything in which are immersed \"independent carri ers\". It behaves as a solid to light (high frequency) and is transparent to matter. Tesla de monstrated how this ether could be \"polarized\" and made \"rigid\" through a particular HF alternator and single terminal coil (ex. 1892 lecture in London) and 2 metal plates which he \"suspended\" in the air making the space between them rigid \"privately\" on one another. In 1894 he invented a special bulb which augmented this technology to created what he called \"veritable ropes of air\" which were \"tubes of force\" which could suspend or accelerated his ship in any direction. Another important Tesla concept connecte d to his ether theory and DToG are his \"primary solar rays\". Grossolaneously, the sun acts as a \"generator\" for our solar system. It emits enor mous amounts of radiation which Tesla calls primary solar rays. These rays in tu rn, hit various particles in space which give rise to secondary radiation which is much weak er. The primary solar rays reach the various planets imparting momentum to them which are constantly at right angles in respect to their trajectory from the sun (this explains why planets revolve around stars, a theory later proven by Hannes Alfven). Tesla often repeated that nothing in the universe is standing still (this is why he called his theory \"dynamic\") because if it were, a ll matter would \"decay\" back to the ether (we are hurling through space at incredib le speed sitting on our planet). In fact, Tesla stated that if we could shield a ny radioactive element from these rays, it would cease to be radioactive. This in turn underlines one of his ma jor discoveries that put him in direct contrast with the re-emerg ing Relativity theory, whic h is that energy does not directly originate from matter or vice versa, but that matter behaves as a medium for forces to act upon or to ac t through, and that w ithout matter there is no Energy (nor Force) and vice versa (he said a body without force is like a b ody without a mind). All this energy (m ore modernly viewed as \"ZPE\") comes from the environment (through ether) an d reverts back to the environment giving life to matter, a \"closed circuit\" in one way or the other (more efficiently or less). It is omnipresent, day or night, and is \"re-emitted\" by every star in our universe (which naturally includes our sun). Tesla knew every \"body\" had an electrical content, and as such , interacted with the surrounding ether. The earth is lik e a charged sphere hurling through space (thus a current, hence magnetic field), around the sun, powered by it's primary rays (and giant electric currents alo ng \"frozen magnetic lines of force\", according to the works of Alfven mentioned in \"The Big Bang Never Happened\" by Lehrner). We can observe the effects of solar fl ares through earth's magnetic field and auroras at the poles and we experience high voltage distribution overloads in certain areas due to high en ergy/radiation \"bursts\". While we rotate and revolve around our sun at great speed, a portion of the ether is polarized (is \"rigidified\" by \"rapidly varying electrostatic forces \" emitted by the earth) and carried along by the electric field of the earth which decreases with the inverse square of the distance from the earth. Tesla measured these electrostatic emissions with a Pa g e 2 of 4 PowerPedia:Tesla's D y namic Theor y of Gravit y -PESWiki 14.8.2005 mhtml:file://C:\\PowerPediaTesla's%20D y namic%20Theor y %20of%20Gravit y %20-%2..."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"special tube. Here come into play the \"t ubes of force\" (Faraday, Lord Kelvin, Maxwell, J.J. Thomson) that---due to our independent charge ratio depending on our density and electrical content---are absorbed by our bodi es and impart a downward momentum creating the sensation of a \"g ravity field\". It is the interaction between the electrical content of every \"dynamic\" body with ether carriers (comprising tubes of force) that results in momentum being imparted to a body (an electromagnetic to mechanical interc onversion). It is an endless \"circuit loop\" that continuously keeps everything in motion in our universe (Tesla's \"Wheelwork of Nature\") which if unders tood can give us the ability to achieve \"any desired result\". This \"carrier exchange\" is constant, bu t can be artificially manipulated using HV DC and HV HF AC potentials in orde r to block or reduce it (Tesla's Flying Machine[1] ( http://www.pritchard school.com/Teslas_Flying_Machine.pdf )). Every moving body in our universe tran sverses this omni-directional radiation and interacts with the ether since all bod ies have electrical content. The most important fact of all is that we can use the ether to convert the weaker, mechanical force, to the much strong er electromagnetic one (2*10E40 times stronger). This holds the key to doing mu ch more \"work\" in the same period of time. This exchange is constantly occurri ng in our universe and is it's unlimited \"prime mover\". Tesla never referred to \"space-time\". He considered time as a mere man-made \"measure\" of the rate at which events occur such as a distance travelled (in miles or kms) in a certain period of time, for a frame of reference. He considered the \"curving\" of space to be absurd (putting it in gentle terms) saying humorously that a if a moving body curved space the \"equal and opposite\" reaction of space on the body would \"straighten space back out\". One must keep in mind that Einstein was \"playing around\" with the ether theories of the time (he had access to patents and documentation as he worked as a library clerk at the Swiss patent office since 1902) and certainly gave a good look at them, before the Relativistic theory popped up for the second time (this theory dates back to R. Boscovich, 1711-1787). Einstein himself said \"The secret to creativity is knowing how to hi de your sources\". He has been \"caught\" more than once (even recently) plagiari zing other's people work without giving any credit. Ether is the \"ultimate\" medium (Tesla often interchanged th e term \"medium\" with \"ether\") - being a perfect fluid an d transporting independent carriers. Tesla said that electromagnetic radiation w as propagated \"like sound waves in the ether\". I will continue to update this page un til I feel that my expose' sufficiently resembles Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity based on my research. I thank William Lyne for his major effo rts in uncovering Nikola Tesla's major achievement through his two books Pent agon Aliens and Occult Ether Physics which provide a vast amount of informat ion on this subject and for helping me in editing this document.
