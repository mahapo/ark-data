If you decide to build this motor / engine, build it for your own use only and keep it from family, friends and the News Media. The Fuelless Engine is a spin off of the Ed Grey Motor as well as a combination of our own designs as well as The Newman design. This motor is like no other electric motor in the world. You can run this motor on 300 to 1,000 volts dc, (using a special coil design as well as the designs included in these plans.) Please Keep all of this information to yourself! When Free Energy Electric Motors are allowed to be manufactured here in the USA we will show you how to get even more free energy from your motor than ever thought possible! But for security and Patent reasons we can not reveal to you all our secretes But we will keep your on file and let you know of any updates we can safely share. You c an make the outer shell case out of just about anything you want to. But we suggest you use steel tubing or aluminum tubing for anything over 100 hp. Anything below that you can use ½”plywood box. What most of our customers use is green 1/4” x 14” diameter PVC sewer pipe.

If make the magnets or your air core magnets about 4 to 6” long, it will be much easier to turn on a slow rpm drill press. I find that wrapping the coil with #31 wire at about 150 rpms works best, 250 rpms is a little fast but can be done. We strongly suggest you first build a one Hp or less DC fuelless motor first.

If you need technical help please contact us by E-mail only, we will try our best to get back to you and help you as quick as we can. T o Start: An Automobile engine can be converted into a fuel-less engine for free energy , but it should not be done! Yo u will still have some of the same troubles a gas engine has. Such as wear and tear on all mechanical moving parts, oil rings, gaskets, pistons, etc... too many to name! To do it you will need to remove the lifters and head assembly, and redesign the head. it will take two high voltage magnets per piston one attaches directly to piston via a metal angled extension and one magnet positioned on top of that one, north and north poles of magnets facing each other. Then you must hook up the capacitor banks and use the distributor timing for each piston to ignite each piston. The magnets repulse each other taking place of the explosion which takes place in a internal combustion engine. Just like any car engine you will eventually need to have it rebuilt or repaired.       Yo u    don't    need    a    cooling    system,    or    oil    system.    The    only    parts    you    will    need    to    replace    are    the    spark    plugs    or commutators if you decide to use a commutator system , spark plug wires and the 2 ball bearings that the shaft rides on. We estimate replacement time every 25 to 30 years. If you build your magnets right they will never break down. This is no common ordinary electric engine / motor, there is nothing else like it that I know of in the entire world. The output is free energy which is used to help rerun the motor by recharging the batteries. every HV Electromagnet creates it own energy after power is taken off of it. This electrical phenomenon is called , and another type of energy I can not tell you about, But for your knowledge is not needed. This free energy . But The Fuel less Engine (motor) will never die!

Page 2"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" HOW IT WORKS; THE FUEL-LESS ENGINE puts out far more than it takes to run it! It is considered a Free Energy Perpetual motion machine. It uses high voltage AC at 60 kHz ( 300 to 1 ,000 volts ) in the milliamps. The high voltage is then converted into DC (direct current) through the use of diodes which are rated at twice the voltage of the input voltage. Then the HV dc is directed to a HV CAP ACITOR BANK, See page 1. Without the invention of the capacitor this engine would not be possible, High voltage in the milliamps can do nothing to a HV electromagnet with out the capacitors. The capacitors quickly store the electrons and so produce a great output of free amperage... There is something else that we found that happens that we can not explain,.. something extra is produced by the high voltage that causes this engine to work. ? So then the electrolytic capacitor bank is now fully charged and the spark plug gap is set to fire at 1,000 volts, It then ignites and a complete circuit is made to the magnets which are facing one another north pole to north pole, An explosive amount of magnetic power then takes place and both magnets repel one another, Yo u can use that power to do work, to power a generator to keep up the batteries and to supply power to your entire home.. Yo u know the first time I tried this I was skeptical, I started out using just two electro magnets that I made myself , We placed them on the table and I held down the top magnet just in case it did work. I didn't want my magnet to get damaged. So with all I could, I held and pressed down on the magnet with one hand and connected the + wire lead to the 12 volt battery, then POW! It ignited and almost broke my arm off, and I still couldn't keep the magnet from flying thru the air. That's an experiment that I will never forget. It is impossible to get this much power from a low milliamp source using any other electrical DC store bought motor. NOTE: The more voltage you use the more power your engine (Motor) will have, as well as rpms. But anything over 1 ,600 volts will have to be well insulated. Y our soft iron cores of your electro magnets will have to be dipped in paint and allowed to drip dry for 3 days. Or you can simply buy a 10 LB roll of #30 or so double or triple coated copper wire.... also buy the square type you will get more power.... and be sure to wrap wire as tight as you can, side by side as close as you can... But our motor will do it! WARNING HIGH V OLT AGE CAN KILL YOU: DO NOT A TTEMPT TO WORK WITH HIGH VOL TAGE IF YOU ARE NOT A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL. ALW A YS WEAR RUBBER GLOVES AND SHOES, RESPECT HIGH VOL TAGE, DON'T ASSUME JUST BECAUSE IT'S YOUR PROJECT IT'S O.K.. ALW A YS DISCHARGE ALL CAP ACITORS BEFORE WORKING AROUND OR ON THEM, EVEN IF THE AC 10 MILLIAMPS MIGHT NOT KILL, IT WILL ONCE THEY HA VE ENTERED INTO A CAP ACITOR. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING IN THESE PLANS OR WHA T YOU DO WITH THEM. YOU BUILD AND EXPERIMENT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

By using copper coated wire #27 and winding t his wire around a soft iron core, your motor will be using more voltage and le ss amperage! this is very important! By adding more or longer electromagnets you can inc rease the hors epow er to an y size you want, example from 100 to 350 hp. Now back to the Fuelle ss Engine. EX AMPLE: by using #27 wire it is like using a small thin water hose, how much water do you think will pass through it? If you use a large 1 /4\" w ater ho se mor e water p asses through i t. it is the same thin g with electrons / current, the larger gauge wire you use t he more amperage you will use and the less volta ge you will need, th is is the way most elec trical motor s are used today, these mot ors I like to call amp erage ho gs! They waste energy! and they are not designed to use the back emfofeach coil of wire. this is a waste' The fuelless engine uses #27 wire which uses less amperage and hi gher voltages, which by using higher voltages you get more free energy effects! A sim ple experiment will help you understand this more: You will need two soft iron cores, the first iron core use # 18 copper coated wire with 200 turns, the second iron core use #27 co pper coated wire with 2,000 turns, now you will need a 1000 vdc x 47 micro farads capacitor or capacitor bank. place a volt meter on the capacitor and charge the capacitor to 1000 volts, the negative wire of the capacitor should be co nnected to the coil of the first and second iron core electromagnets that you have made. now conn ect the plus wir e coming from the 1000 v cap and connect it o ff and on to each magnet one at a time. as y ou will see the first ma gnet will take on ly 1 to 2 hits before th e voltage of the cap acitor hits - 0 - , the second magnet will take about 7 to 10 hits be fore it reaches the - 0 - voltage mark. so do you see it yet. the second magnet that is using the #27 wire uses less energy to run than does the first mag net (the amperage HOG!).

The HV Electromagnets: Use # 27 copper coated wire. You may already have a supplier in your area for wire that they sell in spools. Check your yellow pages phone book for Electric Motor repair shops, they may sell you some or they can tell you where to buy it in your area, if you still can’t find it, you can buy it on the internet, there are tons of wire companies on the net. Turn your #27 wire around an air core bobbin or a soft iron core. The more turns the better. If you do not know how to build these type of HV Electromagnets, we do sell the plans or you could try your local Library. Basically this is a large DC Motor Generator that puts out free energy from the coils and caps. It works as so: A 1,000 vdc repulsive explosion takes place at the 12:00 and 6:00 positions, the rotor arm is then forced to the 9:00 and 3:00 positions. The 1,000 volts is switched on and off and is controlled by our easy to build homemade copper pipe commutator. When timing is adjusted just right, the inner rotor arm and shaft will spin very fast! This is much more than just an electric motor, this motor outputs free energy just as well as Solar Cells can do.

It is considered a Free Energy Perpetual motion machine. It uses high voltage AC at 60 kHz ( 300 to 1 ,000 volts ) in the milliamps. The high voltage is then converted into DC (direct current) through the use of diodes which are rated at twice the voltage of the input voltage. Then the HV dc is directed to a HV CAP ACITOR BANK, See page 1. Without the invention of the capacitor this engine would not be possible, High voltage in the milliamps can do nothing to a HV electromagnet with out the capacitors. The capacitors quickly store the electrons and so produce a great output of free amperage... There is something else that we found that happens that we can not explain,.. something extra is produced by the high voltage that causes this engine to work. ? So then the electrolytic capacitor bank is now fully charged and the spark plug gap is set to fire at 1,000 volts, It then ignites and a complete circuit is made to the magnets which are facing one another north pole to north pole, An explosive amount of magnetic power then takes place and both magnets repel one another, Yo u can use that power to do work, to power a generator to keep up the batteries and to supply power to your entire home.. Yo u know the first time I tried this I was skeptical, I started out using just two electro magnets that I made myself , We placed them on the table and I held down the top magnet just in case it did work. I didn't want my magnet to get damaged. So with all I could, I held and pressed down on the magnet with one hand and connected the + wire lead to the 12 volt battery, then POW! It ignited and almost broke my arm off, and I still couldn't keep the magnet from flying thru the air. That's an experiment that I will never forget. It is impossible to get this much power from a low milliamp source using any other electrical DC store bought motor. NOTE: The more voltage you use the more power your engine (Motor) will have, as well as rpms. But anything over 1 ,600 volts will have to be well insulated. Y our soft iron cores of your electro magnets will have to be dipped in paint and allowed to drip dry for 3 days. Or you can simply buy a 10 LB roll of #30 or so double or triple coated copper wire.... also buy the square type you will get more power.... and be sure to wrap wire as tight as you can, side by side as close as you can... But our motor will do it! WARNING HIGH V OLT AGE CAN KILL YOU: DO NOT A TTEMPT TO WORK WITH HIGH VOL TAGE IF YOU ARE NOT A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL.

The center Rotor, Rotates with in the Stator Housing as so: after you turn it on and each capacitor bank powers up to it's firing spark potential then all you need to do is start it by spinning the shaft by hand or starter motor and lets say when you start it's in the 12:00 position it then ignites pushing it to the 9:00 position and the brush timing contacts hit and ignites all 4 magnets again pushing it to the 6:00 position and so on. Of course this all happens so fast and with so much power that you can't see it. To give you an idea about what is happening flip a bicycle on its back and spin the front tire as fast as you can repeatedly with as much power as you can. Y ou see a little of what happens inside this engine but with 100 times more power made by the repulsion of the magnets , the weight of the magnets and rotor and the inertia. Note: the rotor can be made with just one magnet and a counter balance, it will work just fine but with less horse power. The best motor to build is the 1 hp type, which we have included in these plans. For more horse power simply scale it up. Using air core electro magnets are by far the best way to go. The finer the wire you use and the more turns of wire, the more free energy output you will have, but motor input voltage must go up. Using the fine wire will cause the motor to run with very little amperage at all, and then the Free Energy back EMF can then be used to replenish the 12 volt battery or batteries. The finer the wire the harder it is to turn. Hair thin wire breaks very easy.

Study it carefully . Timing the Fuel less Engine: 1,000 vdc is applied to the brush assembly , the brush assembly acts as an on and off switch for each set of magnets. The brush assembly can be made in many ways. The timing takes place in two places, the spark plug caps or the commutator brush collar assembly. Y ou will only need one 1,000 vdc charging and firing system that is rated at 1 to 3 amps, the more amps the better, but the more danger to you during assembly. Y ou can experiment around with a low milliamp cap bank and power supply, 10 ma is safe to use. Y ou will need two spark plugs, two sets of capacitor banks or capacitors and one or two diode banks. One diode bank is for the Positive side and optional a 2nd is for the negative side. When the rotor arm magnets #5 & 6 are in the 12:00 position contact should be made to fire #1, #5, #6 & #3 magnets all at the same time. Wire these magnets so they are north pole to north pole, or north to south which will cause motor to then be an attraction motor. Many think that an attraction motor is better? But if you are using this as a repelling motor then time the firing when the arm #5 is just 1/16” past the center of #1 stator magnet. This will insure that the rotor arm will be pushed and rotated to the left and rotate counter clock wise. If timing as an attraction motor, you will want #5 to fire at about 3 to 4 inches before it gets to #1 magnet. This motor can be times to run clock wise as well. Collect all back emf per coil using a diode and capacitor per magnet, on the negative side outputs. It is strongly recommened that you build our 1 hp motor to get more understanding of how to build this motor. If you choose to use a spark plug, you can gap the spark plug to fire a little early which will cause your power up time tobe less, But you will have less shaft torque (HP). In other words you will have more RPMs but with some what less Horse Power, Now this is not real bad because it depends on what kind of generator you're going to use. Please NOTE: the engine must be timed just right so the rotor magnets do not repulse each other too soon. Repulsion must take place at center or 1/16\" past left or right. ( This prototype uses a 115 volt AC generator, Please note: This engine design rotates to the left only , ( counter clock wise.) Y ou can design it to rotate both ways. Also Note: A & B Magnets connect to the same + & - Brush Rotor Assembly. Update: See our new and easy way to make a homemade commutator which should be included with these plans.

Y ou now need to fill the copper pipe with Epoxy, so slowly squeeze out enough J-B Epoxy to fill the inside of the copper pipe, follow all directions on the J-B Instructions, Mix the 2 parts very well and start placing the epoxy inside of the copper pipe. Let dry 24 hrs, I prefer to wait 40 hrs, but the instruction do not tell you that. We use J-B Epoxy because it is the best on the market and can stand up to 600 degrees. Now you must find the exact center of the pipe and score it with a sharp punch. You will be scoring or punching a small hole into the top of the epoxy. Now you are going to need a drill press. Place the copper pipe up as you see in figure #3, Make sure bottom surface is very flat, if it is not the hole will be crooked and the commutator will ride with the shaft crooked and cause a off balance at high speeds. start off with the smallest drill bit you have and work your way up until you have a hole the same size as your shaft rods outer diameter. STEP FIVE Now using a fine point marker, mark your cut marks on the outside of the copper pipe piece. As shown in figure #4. Use a fine tooth hacksaw to cut. Cut a long center cut all the way around the copper pipe leaving a 3/4” space. Cut all the way through the copper and just up to the hardened epoxy fill. Do not to deep into the epoxy fill. # 362-R C Rick’s DC Motor / Generator 3/4” separates the brushes from contacting each other. Cut all the way around pipe. STEP ONE STEP TWO STEP THREE ST EP FO UR Use a very fine hacksaw blade to cut spacers, fill spacers with epoxy and sand smooth. 1 1/8” 1 3/8” 1 3 /8” Page 19 BUILDING THE COMMUT A TOR COMMUT A TOR Cut a piece of 3/4” Diameter” x 1 3/8” length copper pipe that you can buy at any hardware store. Use a pipe cutter to cut a piece 1 3/8” long. Next using rough sand paper , sand the inside of the copper pipe really good. And then clean with laquer thinner. Surface must be free from dirt. This is a homemade Commutator designed by Rick and Dave, This DC Commutator is used to turn off the incoming DC voltage to the HV V oltage or Low V oltage Magnetic Coil. We are going to create a junction bar that rotates and as it rotates it will slide onto the 2 carbon DC motor brushes and cause a complete connection causing DC current to flow into the Electromagnetic coil. We are going to give you 2 options in making a DC m otor commutator. Pick which one is easiest for you. Fill in the cuts with epoxy, let dry 24 hrs then sand down until smooth. Now take a 5/16” steel shaft and place it back into the epoxy hole, now place a steel 5/16” shaft collar onto the steel rod and epoxy it to the end of your new commutator, ( remove the plastic end first. ) OPTION ONE Figure #3 Acts as a Junction Bar Figure #4 Copyright 2003 Patent Pending"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"# 362 Rick’s DC Motor / Generator P ART “F” B R U S H H O L D E R B R U S H H O L D E R C C o p y ri g h t 2 0 0 2 Page 20 ASSEMBLY #1 #2 PART “ G” PART “ G” 1 5/16” ½” ½” Cut two 1 5/16” x ½” x ½” x 1/16” Square steel. 1 1/4” 1/4” 2” Fill with PC 7 Epoxy or J - B weld about 1/4” deep.

This is a research device, Capacitor and diode ratings depend on the voltage input vs what size coil wire used and # of winds. If you use a coil that is wound several thousands of times with number 38 or 36 copper coated wire, you are going to need to use voltages from 1000 to 3,500 vdc input. The back emf will be great. # 38 wire is hair thin and hard to wind but it is the best to use for a PVC air core type magnet. Output to load or back to battery Using # 36 or 32 copper coated wire is much easier to work with. Make several coils out of old transformer iron cores. You will need to do a little cutting. This will be a great learning experience for you when you go to build a larger unit. Make one coil with #18 copper coated wire which should come out to be about 90 to 100 turns, you will notice that free energy can be collected but the coil and commutators run hot, heat loss = energy loss. # 18 wire will take voltages from 12 to 24 vdc. #38 wire will take voltages from 200 to 3,500 vdc. And will run very cool and use very little amperage from your DC power supply, use a 12 vdc battery with a small 100 watt dc to ac inverter."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Page 24"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"For this motor you will need 2 powerful ceramic permanent magnets, you can buy these from Radio Shack or search the internet for magnet suppliers. If you want to increase your horsepower then you must add more magnets to your shaft, on this motor you can get 2 pair. Make sure to redesign your magnetic coil structure to be longer. Y ou can also design a large HP motor with Radio shack magnets by buying a hex shaped metal rod, and glueing 24 magnets to it. This will also Insure that your permanent magnets will last a very long time.

Use #16 gauge or #18 Gauge copper coated wire to make a Spiral. demonstrates an amperage hog motor , Place this Spiral under the motor shaft. Run test and note what happens. To make a Spiral coil, use two pieces of flat plexi glass or MDO board, drill a center hole in both, sandwich the 2 pieces together leaving a metal or cardboard spacer in between the 2 boards, the spacer washer must be the same size thickness as the wire. Now place a bolt in the center hole and attache a nut. Now drill a small hole nest to center hole so you can run the first part of your wire through, tape it down and begin turning wire. + _ Reversing polarity reverses the poles.
