This energizing phenomenon has been one of the few con tenders for acceleration of cosmic rays (CR), particularly at ultrahigh energies. The recen t \fnding by the AGASA collab oration ( Phys. Rev. Lett. , 81 , 1163, 1998) that the CR energy spectrum does not displa y any signs of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cut-o\u000b (that should be presen t if these CR particles were indeed generated in localized ultrahigh energies CR sources, as e.g., quasars and other highly activ e galactic nuclei), ma y indicate the need for an acceleration mec hanism that is distributed throughout IGS as is the case with the ZPF. Other unexplained phenomena that receiv e an explanation from this mec hanism are the generation of X-ra y and gamma-ra y bac kgrounds and the existence of Cosmic Voids. Ho wever recen tly , a statistical mec hanics kind of challenge to the classical (not the quan tum) version of the zero-p oin t acceleration mec hanism has been posed (de la Pe~ na and Cetto, The Quantum Dic e , 1996). Here we brie\ry examine the consequences of this challenge and a prosp ectiv e resolution. INTR ODUCTION The idea that the vacuum ma y pla y a fundamen tal role in the early dev elopmen t and future evolution of the univ erse has been \\in the air\" for a long time [1]. Both the Steady State and the old (pre-in\ration mo del) Big Bang cosmological scenarios needed to invoke this idea in one way or another [2]. The Steady State prop osed the perennial creation of particles (protons and electrons, presumably from the Dirac vacuum of particle-an tiparticle pairs) throughout the univ erse. The old Big Bang mo del postulated a localized and instan taneous generation of all the matter and energy of the univ erse together with the subsequen t gradual generation of space-time whic h sprang from literally nothing. And the new Big Bang with its more sophisticated In\rationary Cosmological Mo del started from the postulation of an unstable vacuum (the false vacuum) that collapsed, giving rise to the sim ultaneous creation of matter-energy and space-time follo wed by an in\ration whic h pro duces a rapid expansion of space-time [3, 4, 5]. This in\ration [5] was brief but extremely dynamic, and, as new space was actually being created, the pro cess gave the illusion of being sup erluminal. Once this stage terminated, the univ erse entered its much slo wer curren t Hubble expansion [1, 5, 6], the era in whic h we now are and have been for the last 12 \u0000 20 \u0002 10 9 years or so.

Recen t observ ational \fndings by two di\u000beren t teams of astronomers poin t in this direction [7, 8]. It has been disco vered that instead of a decreasing rate of expansion by cosmological gra vitational attraction, as was assumed for man y years, the univ erse actually exp eriences an accelerated rate of expansion. This accelerated rate of expansion ma y be physically explainable in terms of an ongoing involv emen t of the vacuum in energizing the expansion. ACCELERA TED EXP ANSION AND COSMIC VOIDS There is a paucit y of kno wn mec hanisms by whic h the vacuum migh t yield some of its energy to steadily con tribute to an accelerated expansion of the univ erse. Recen tly however within a di\u000beren t astroph ysical con text a mec hanism that could accomplish this was prop osed [9, 10, 11]. Rueda, Haisc h and Cole [11] investigated a mec hanism that could accoun t for the phenomenon of Cosmic Voids [12]. It is now kno wn that the structure of the univ erse presen ts a peculiar distribution of matter in whic h clusters and sup erclusters of galaxies are found in \\sheets\" that surround \\voids\", i.e., large regions of space of typical diameters around 100 Megaparsecs, whic h are practically dev oid of matter and where no galaxies are found [1]. The whole structure ma y be represen ted by a soap-foam-lik e mo del where the particles and magnetic \felds are mainly found on the sheets along with galactic clusters and sup erclusters, surrounding enormous spaces in between in whic h much lower particle densities and much smaller concomitan t magnetic \feld intensities prev ail. It has been prop osed [10, 11] that the ZPF of traditional quan tum electro dynamics (QED), via a well- kno wn mec hanism (discussed belo w), is resp onsible for the e\u000bect. This mec hanism seems also to be involv ed in con tributing to other astroph ysical phenomena: the X-ra y and gamma-ra y bac kgrounds [13] and the acceleration of cosmic rays (CR), particularly at very high energies, E \u0015 10 17 eV (see [9] for an extensiv e review). It is imp ortan t to emphasize that when the ZPF is applied as an energizing entity to pro duce the expansion asso ciated with the Cosmic Voids, automatically an expansion of the univ erse itself must necessarily be pro duced. The ZPF acceleration mec hanism expands the Voids by creating a pressure imbalance, transferring energy to, and thereb y increasing the pressure in, those regions where matter densities happ en to be com- parativ ely lower in the IGS plasma [10, 11]. As a consequence the low-densit y regions tend to expand and to exp el the trapp ed magnetic \felds. It is well kno wn in astroph ysics that space plasma regions of higher densities are colder, while regions of lower densit y are almost exclusiv ely occupied by a highly energetic (hot) plasma of electrons and ionized nuclei, mainly protons [15]. This temp erature-densit y anticorrelation is what occurs in the Voids and it is also what is happ ening in man y places throughout IGS. Moreo ver, suc h a distribution would be a natural outcome of the ZPF acceleration mec hanism when com bined with ordinary radiativ e collisional cooling [9]. THE ZER O-POINT FIELD ACCELERA TION MECHANISM The origins of this mec hanism go bac k to the early work of Einstein and his immediate collab orators [16, 17]. Einstein realized that when a gas of electromagnetically interacting particles a is submitted to the action of a random electromagnetic bac kground (e.g., the case of thermal radiation) two sim ultaneous phenomena tak e place. Due to the action of the random electromagnetic medium, electromagnetically interacting parti- cles become energized, steadily increasing their translational kinetic energy . They perform a random walk in velo city space that tak es them, on average, systematically away from the origin. Sim ultaneously however, as their velo cities increase the particles \fnd themselv es submerged in a random electromagnetic medium that is view ed by eac h of them as Doppler-shifted and thereb y has lost its isotrop y. This causes the random electromagnetic bac kground to app ear distorted and thereb y to pro duce a drag force on the particle that is of a frictional character because it is exactly prop ortional to the velo city ~v , a Einstein restricted his considertion to polarizable particles. Ho wever it can be sho wn that in the case of monop olar particles the mec hanism is even more e\u000bectiv e [9, 18] 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"~ F = \u0000 A \u0014 \u001a ( !;T ) \u0000 1 3 ! @\u001a ( !;T ) @! \u0015 ~v c ; (1) where A is a positiv e constan t.

It originates in quan tum theory from the harmonic oscillator beha vior of the individual cavit y mo des. At T = 0, eac h individual cavit y mo de beha ves as a quan tized harmonic oscillator with minim um, or zero-p oin t, ground state energy \u0016 h!= 2. When the energy in eac h oscillator is multiplied by the densit y of mo des per unit volume ( ! 2 =\u0019 2 c 3 ), one obtains the ZPF spectral energy densit y above. It can be sho wn that suc h ZPF is also presen t in free space, and cogen t argumen ts can be giv en for its realit y [19, 20]. Observ e however, that when the temp erature is set to zero (or close to zero) \u001a ( !;T ) d! ! \u001a 0 ( ! ) d! and because of the ! 3 dep endence, the Einstein-Hopf drag disapp ears. This last fact, \frst realized by Bo yer [21], is at the basis of the ZPF acceleration mec hanism. So, under circumstances in whic h there are negligible particle collisions and negligible am bien t radiation \felds other than the the ZPF, when the temp erature is low or negligible, particles are still translationally energized by the random bac kground ZPF radiation. But the Einstein-Hopf drag due to the ZPF is zer o. In the original form ulation of a ZPF acceleration mec hanism [21, 16], it was assumed for simplicit y that the translational displacemen t of the particle was restricted to a single dimension (sa y, the x -axis) and that the internal dip ole vibrated along a single direction (sa y the z -axis). These restrictions were remo ved by one of us when prop osing this concept as a mec hanism for the actual acceleration of cosmic ray (CR) particles in IGS [14, 9]. Soon after it was realized [18] that monop olar particles could also be accelerated by the ZPF, but in a much more e\u000bectiv e manner than polarizable particles. This conforms with the well-kno wn observ ational constrain t on CR acceleration mec hanisms that restricts the acceleration to fully ionized nuclei [9]. Another well-kno wn constrain t is that electrons app ear in CR only at the very low energies, E \u0014 10 12 eV, and not beyond. This could be explained [22] by the ultrarelativistic Zitterb ew egung that, because of a time dilation e\u000bect, decorrelates the actions of the electric and of the magnetic \felds in the Einstein-Hopf mec hanism. This therefore prev ents the acceleration of electrons to ultrahigh CR energies. This decorrelation does not tak e place in the case of the much more massiv e and sturdy protons that, if allo wed, can be carried up to the highest CR energies beyond 10 20 eV [9]. The ZPF CR acceleration mec hanism can be deriv ed in a quan tum way [23, 24]. It was found that it occurs in a time-symmetric or Wheeler-F eynman version of QED. But acceleration does not occur in the more ordinary time-unidirectional version of QED [24, 9]. Ho wever, as the time-symmetric QED version and the time-unidirectional version are equiv alen t (as long as certain initial boundary conditions are assumed for the radiation in space-time and as those conditions seem to hold in the original univ erse [25]) there is no clear reason for taking one or the other versions of QED: no reason other than the fact that we are more used to the time-unidirectional version. It is moreo ver very interesting to men tion that both the Wheeler-F eynman version of QED and the classical sto chastic theory giv e exactly the same \fnal form for the translational kinetic energy rate of gro wth , namely 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" = 3 5 \u0019 (\u0000 ! 0 ) 2 \u0012 \u0016 h! 0 mc 2 \u0013 (\u0016 h! 0 ) ! 0 (4) where \u0000 is the Abraham-Loren tz parameter (\u0000 = 2 e 2 = 3 mc 3 ), with e the charge and m the mass of the particle (proton). The frequency ! 0 is a parameter that dep ends on other considerations, e.g., what entity really performs the oscillations, whether the whole proton or some comp onen t (lik e quarks, proton vibration mo des, etc.) inside the proton. In the most simplistic case ! 0 comes to be half the proton Compton frequency ( ! 0 = mc 2 = 2\u0016 h ), but this applies only under unrealistic strictly subrelativistic considerations. In practice ! 0 is tak en as a free-parameter to be phenomenologically \ftted by observ ation. The ZPF acceleration mec hanism could be found to satisfy all standard CR observ ational constrain ts [26, 9], certainly at energies E \u0015 10 17 eV. But lower energies could not be immediately excluded, though the situation there was somewhat less certain [9]. The least that we can say then is that the mec hanism, up to now, seems to be one of the strongest con tenders for CR acceleration at ultrahigh E \u0015 10 17 eV energies. CHALLENGE TO THE ZPF ACCELERA TION CONCEPT Recen tly in their 1996 textb ook on the theory of Sto chastic Electro dynamics (SED) and related theories, de la Pe~ na and Cetto [20] have challenged at least some asp ects of the ZPF acceleration concept. In a lucid reanalysis [27] of the Bo yer deriv ation [21] of the translational kinetic energy gro wth, they argue that if an arguably more realistic non-Mark ovian sto chastic pro cess is assumed for the phenomenon in its classical form, no systematic translational kinetic energy gro wth tak es place. This would then rather \ft, according to de la Pe~ na and Cetto, the time-unidirectional version of the QED acceleration mec hanism that indeed yields no systematic translational kinetic energy gro wth [24, 9]. We discuss the de la Pe~ na and Cetto argumen t in the App endix. Formally , of course, and once the non-Mark ovian beha vior is assumed, the argumen t of de la P~ena and Cetto seems faultless. The situation however is far from clear. Time-symmetric QED [25] still giv es the acceleration and there is no certain ty at all that even when a classical viewp oin t is implemen ted, the pro cess has to be non-Mark ovian, i.e., having some memory . Moreo ver, recen t work of Cole [28] strongly suggests the thermo dynamics soundness of the ZPF acceleration mec hanism both in its physical and in its astroph ysical con text. This step is imp ortan t. Before this there remained a thermo dynamic challenge to ZPF acceleration [29]. Apparen tly , ZPF acceleration seemed to violate standard interpretations of the \frst and of the second laws of thermo dynamics. It has been sho wn that this is indeed not the case [28]. DISCUSSION Giv en the overwhelming astroph ysical explanatory possibilities of the ZPF acceleration mec hanism | to men tion a few, accelerated cosmic expansion, ultrahigh energies CR, part of the X-ra y and the gamma-ra y bac kgrounds, Cosmic Voids, etc. | it is of paramoun t imp ortance to clarify the situation and decide if the de la Pe~ na and Cetto challenge is or is not a surmoun table di\u000ecult y. There are also other imp ortan t possibilities for the ZPF acceleration mec hanism. If valid, the mec hanism should eventually pro vide a means to transfer energy , bac k and forth, but most imp ortan tly forth [9], from the vacuum electromagnetic ZPF into a suitable exp erimen tal apparatus. A more far-fetc hed but not tri\ring possibilit y is that a better understanding of the Einstein-Hopf pro cess, that accompanies ZPF acceleration, would lead to an understanding of the recen tly prop osed ZPF con tribution to inertia [30], also presumably to some means for in\ruencing inertia, and by the Einstein Principle of Equiv alence, also gra vit y. This has very interesting prosp ectiv e engineering applications. ACKNO WLEDGEMENTS BH and AR ackno wledge partial supp ort from NASA researc h con tract NASW-5050.

In this App endix, the argumen ts leading to this conclusion are discussed. 1. Dip ole Oscillator Mo del The Bo yer SED approac h to the problem [21] is based up on the mo del originally dev elop ed by Einstein and Hopf [16, 17]. In this mo del, that for simplicit y we follo w here, it is assumed that the internal particle motion is in the x -direction and the oscillator dip ole vibrates along the z -axis. (An extension to fully three-dimensional motions was obtained in [14].) During a time interv al \u000et , this oscillator exp eriences two forces due to electromagnetic radiation, namely the impulse \u0001 transferred to the dip ole via the interaction with the \ructuating \feld, and the force of resistance Rp due to the anisotrop y of the \feld as seen by the mo ving particle. Then, if at time t , the momen tum of the translational motion of the oscillator is p , after a short time \u000et , its momen tum becomes p + \u0001 \u0000 Rp\u000et . Since in equilibrium the mean-square momen tum has to be constan t in time, we get the equilibrium condition, p 2 \u000b = ( p + \u0001 \u0000 Rp\u000et ) 2 \u000b ; ( A 1) where the impulse \u0001 = R Fdt , and the drag coe\u000ecien t R are giv en resp ectiv ely by \u0001 2 \u000b = * Z t + \u000et t dtez @E z @x ! 2 + = 4 \u001c\u0019 4 c 4 5 ! 2 \u001a 2 ( !;T ) \u000et; ( A 2) and R = 6 \u0019 2 c\u001c 5 m \u0012 \u001a \u0000 1 3 ! @\u001a @! \u0013 : ( A 3) Equation (A1) , when expanded and neglecting the term of second order in \u000et yields \u0001 2 \u000b + 2 h p \u0001 i\u0000 2 R p 2 \u000b \u000et \u0000 2 R h p \u0001 i \u000et = 0 : ( A 4) At T = 0, however, there is no drag force since \u001a 0 is Loren tz-in varian t, so that the above equation yields \u0001 2 \u000b 0 + 2 h p \u0001 i 0 = 0 : ( A 5) This suggests that since h \u0001 2 i 0 6 = 0 due to the presence of the zero-p oin t \feld, the momen tum p and the \ructuation \u0001 have to be correlated, con trary to the assumption h p \u0001 i = 0 correctly made by Einstein and his cowork ers, but only for the case of pure thermal radiation. It is here where de la Pe~ na and Cetto disagree with Bo yer [21] who assumed even when the ZPF is presen t that h p \u0001 i = 0 alw ays. So, de la Pe~ na and Cetto sensibly claim that the \ructuation at a giv en time is not indep enden t of past ones, i.e., the pro cess \u000ep = p \u0000 \u0016 p is not Mark ovian and the system acquires a certain degree of memory in its interactions with the ZPF.

Since both sides reduce to zero at T = 0, it can be argued that h \u0001 2 i 0 is no longer of the form const \u0002 \u000et that was resp onsible for the steady translational kinetic energy gro wth. Hence no acceleration of a free particle due to the zero-p oin t \feld. The averaged square of the \ructuating impulse should be a constan t as in standard theory . 2. Quan tum analysis Our quan tum work [9, 23, 24] does not entirely supp ort this De la Pe~ na and Cetto conclusion. We \fnd that the secular acceleration disapp ears only under ordinary time-unidirectional QED. Ho wever, the secular acceleration mec hanism is resurrected and in full force (with a much more detailed algebraic expression that reduces in a suitable limit to the standard classical case) under the Wheeler-F eynman time-symmetric form of QED. A detailed discussion of this is found in the App endix of [9]. Our new exploration of this sub ject of the secular acceleration mec hanism involv es among other things a reanalysis of these results and a comparison of the classical Mark ovian case of the traditional ZPF SED secular acceleration case, the non-Mark ovian coun terpart of De la Pe~ na and Cetto as well as the corresp onding time-asymmetric and time-symmetric QED versions. We intend to pursue (and have prop osed in a NASA researc h prop osal with D.C. Cole as PI) to perform an exp erimen tal approac h to the problem in order to chec k if the secular acceleration can be validated for example in a Paul trap. REFERENCES [1] Borner, G.
